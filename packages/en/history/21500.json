Of these and similar works of reference,\r\nas well as of a variety of others, treating directly or indirectly on\r\nthe biography, the literature, and the manners of the period, a large\r\ncollection has been placed under the eyes of the author, partly by the\r\nliberality of her publishers, partly by the kindness of friends.\r\n\r\nIn availing herself of their contents, she has had to encounter in full\r\nforce the difficulties attendant on such a task; those of weighing and\r\ncomparing authorities, of reconciling discordant statements, of bringing\r\ninsulated facts to bear upon each other, and of forming out of materials\r\nirregular in their nature and abundant almost to excess, a compact and\r\nwell-proportioned structure.\r\n\r\nHow far her abilities and her diligence may have proved themselves\r\nadequate to the undertaking, it remains with a candid public to decide.\r\nRespecting the selection of topics it seems necessary however to remark,\r\nthat it has been the constant endeavour of the writer to preserve to her\r\nwork the genuine character of Memoirs, by avoiding as much as possible\r\nall encroachments on the peculiar province of history;--that amusement,\r\nof a not illiberal kind, has been consulted at least equally with\r\ninstruction:--and that on subjects of graver moment, a correct sketch\r\nhas alone been attempted.\r\n\r\nBy a still more extensive course of reading and research, an additional\r\nstore of anecdotes and observations might unquestionably have been\r\namassed; but it is hoped that of those assembled in the following pages,\r\nfew will be found to rest on dubious or inadequate authority; and that a\r\ncopious choice of materials, relatively to the intended compass of the\r\nwork, will appear to have superseded the temptation to useless\r\ndigression, or to prolix and trivial detail.\r\n\r\nThe orthography of all extracts from the elder writers has been\r\nmodernized, and their punctuation rendered more distinct; in other\r\nrespects reliance may be placed on their entire fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE COURT OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1533 TO 1536.\r\n\r\nBirth of Elizabeth.--Circumstances attending the marriage of her\r\nparents.--Public entry of Anne Boleyn into London.--Pageants\r\nexhibited.--Baptism of Elizabeth.--Eminent persons present.--Proposal of\r\nmarriage between Elizabeth and a French prince.--Progress of the\r\nreformation.--Henry persecutes both parties.--Death of Catherine of\r\nArragon.--Disgrace of Anne Boleyn.--Her death.--Confesses an obstacle to\r\nher marriage.--Particulars on this subject.--Elizabeth declared\r\nillegitimate.--Letter of lady Bryan respecting her.--The king marries\r\nJane Seymour.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September 1533, at the royal palace of Greenwich in Kent,\r\nwas born, under circumstances as peculiar as her after-life proved\r\neventful and illustrious, ELIZABETH daughter of king Henry VIII. and his\r\nqueen Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\nDelays and difficulties equally grievous to the impetuous temper of the\r\nman and the despotic habits of the prince, had for years obstructed\r\nHenry in the execution of his favourite project of repudiating, on the\r\nplea of their too near alliance, a wife who had ceased to find favor in\r\nhis sight, and substituting on her throne the youthful beauty who had\r\ncaptivated his imagination. At length his passion and his impatience had\r\narrived at a pitch capable of bearing down every obstacle. With that\r\ncontempt of decorum which he displayed so remarkably in some former, and\r\nmany later transactions of his life, he caused his private marriage with\r\nAnne Boleyn to precede the sentence of divorce which he had resolved\r\nthat his clergy should pronounce against Catherine of Arragon; and no\r\nsooner had this judicial ceremony taken place, than the new queen was\r\nopenly exhibited as such in the face of the court and the nation.\r\n\r\nAn unusual ostentation of magnificence appears to have attended the\r\ncelebration of these august nuptials. The fondness of the king for pomp\r\nand pageantry was at all times excessive, and on this occasion his love\r\nand his pride would equally conspire to prompt an extraordinary display.\r\nAnne, too, a vain, ambitious, and light-minded woman, was probably\r\ngreedy of this kind of homage from her princely lover; and the very\r\nconsciousness of the dubious, inauspicious, or disgraceful circumstances\r\nattending their union, might secretly augment the anxiety of the royal\r\npair to dazzle and impose by the magnificence of their public\r\nappearance. Only once before, since the Norman conquest, had a king of\r\nEngland stooped from his dignity to elevate a private gentlewoman and a\r\nsubject to a partnership of his bed and throne; and the bitter\r\nanimosities between the queen's relations on one side, and the princes\r\nof the blood and great nobles on the other, which had agitated the reign\r\nof Edward IV., and contributed to bring destruction on the heads of his\r\nhelpless orphans, stood as a strong warning against a repetition of the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe unblemished reputation and amiable character of Henry's \"some-time\r\nwife,\" had long procured for her the love and respect of the people; her\r\nlate misfortunes had engaged their sympathy, and it might be feared that\r\nseveral unfavorable points of comparison would suggest themselves\r\nbetween the high-born and high-minded Catherine and her present\r\nrival--once her humble attendant--whose long-known favor with the king,\r\nwhose open association with him at Calais, whither she had attended him,\r\nwhose private marriage of uncertain date, and already advanced\r\npregnancy, afforded so much ground for whispered censures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the personal qualities of the king gave him great\r\npower over popular opinion. The manly beauty of his countenance, the\r\nstrength and agility which in the chivalrous exercises of the time\r\nrendered him victorious over all competitors; the splendor with which he\r\nsurrounded himself; his bounty; the popular frankness of his manners,\r\nall conspired to render him, at this period of his life, an object of\r\nadmiration rather than of dread to his subjects; while the respect\r\nentertained for his talents and learning, and for the conscientious\r\nscruples respecting his first marriage which he felt or feigned, mingled\r\nso much of deference in their feelings towards him, as to check all\r\nhasty censures of his conduct. The protestant party, now considerable\r\nby zeal and numbers, foresaw too many happy results to their cause from\r\nthe circumstances of his present union, to scrutinize with severity the\r\nmotives which had produced it. The nation at large, justly dreading a\r\ndisputed succession, with all its long-experienced evils, in the event\r\nof Henry's leaving behind him no offspring but a daughter whom he had\r\nlately set aside on the ground of illegitimacy, rejoiced in the prospect\r\nof a male heir to the crown. The populace of London, captivated, as\r\nusual, by the splendors of a coronation, were also delighted with the\r\nyouth, beauty, and affability of the new queen.\r\n\r\nThe solemn entry therefore of Anne into the city of London was greeted\r\nby the applause of the multitude; and it was probably the genuine voice\r\nof public feeling, which, in saluting her queen of England, wished her,\r\nhow much in vain! a long and prosperous life.\r\n\r\nThe pageants displayed in the streets of London on this joyful occasion,\r\nare described with much minuteness by our chroniclers, and afford ample\r\nindications that the barbarism of taste which permitted an incongruous\r\nmixture of classical mythology with scriptural allusions, was at its\r\nheight in the learned reign of our eighth Henry. Helicon and Mount\r\nParnassus appeared on one side; St. Anne, and Mary the wife of Cleophas\r\nwith her children, were represented on the other. Here the three Graces\r\npresented the queen with a golden apple by the hands of their orator\r\nMercury; there the four cardinal Virtues promised, in set speeches, that\r\nthey would always be aiding and comforting to her.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after her public entry, a day not at this period regarded\r\nas improper for the performance of such a ceremonial, Henry caused his\r\nqueen to be crowned at Westminster with great solemnity; an honor which\r\nhe never thought proper to confer on any of her successors.\r\n\r\nIn the sex of the child born to them a few months afterwards, the hopes\r\nof the royal pair must doubtless have sustained a severe disappointment:\r\nbut of this sentiment nothing was suffered to appear in the treatment of\r\nthe infant, whom her father was anxious to mark out as his only\r\nlegitimate offspring and undoubted heir to the crown.\r\n\r\nShe was destined to bear the auspicious name of Elizabeth, in memory of\r\nher grandmother, that heiress of the house of York whose marriage with\r\nthe earl of Richmond, then Henry VII., had united the roses, and given\r\nlasting peace to a country so long rent by civil discord. The\r\nunfortunate Mary, now in her sixteenth year, was stripped of the title\r\nof princess of Wales, which she had borne from her childhood, that it\r\nmight adorn a younger sister; one too whose birth her interest, her\r\nreligion, and her filial affection for an injured mother, alike taught\r\nher to regard as base and infamous.\r\n\r\nA public and princely christening served still further to attest the\r\nimportance attached to this new member of the royal family.\r\n\r\nBy the king's special command, Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury stood\r\ngodfather to the princess; and Shakespeare, by a fiction equally\r\npoetical and courtly, has represented him as breaking forth on this\r\nmemorable occasion into an animated vaticination of the glories of the\r\n\"maiden reign.\" Happy was it for the peace of mind of the noble\r\npersonages there assembled, that no prophet was empowered at the same\r\ntime to declare how few of them should live to share its splendors; how\r\nawfully large a proportion of their number should fall, or behold their\r\nnearest connexions falling, untimely victims of the jealous tyranny of\r\nHenry himself, or of the convulsions and persecutions of the two\r\ntroubled reigns destined to intervene before those halcyon days which\r\nthey were taught to anticipate!\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of illustrating the truth of this remark, and at the\r\nsame time of introducing to the reader the most distinguished personages\r\nof Henry's court, several of whom will afterwards be found exerting\r\ndifferent degrees of influence on the character or fortunes of the\r\nillustrious subject of this work, it may be worth while to enumerate in\r\nregular order the performers in this august ceremonial. The\r\ncircumstantial Holinshed, to whom we are indebted for their names and\r\noffices, will at the same time furnish some of those minute particulars\r\nwhich serve to bring the whole pompous scene before the eye of fancy.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon, the lord-mayor and corporation of London, who\r\nhad been summoned to attend, took boat for Greenwich, where they found\r\nmany lords, knights, and gentlemen assembled. The whole way from the\r\npalace to the friery was strown with green rushes, and the walls were\r\nhung with tapestry, as was the Friers' church in which the ceremony was\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nA silver font with a crimson canopy was placed in the middle of the\r\nchurch; and the child being brought into the hall, the long procession\r\nset forward. It began with citizens walking two-and-two, and ended with\r\nbarons, bishops, and earls. Then came, bearing the gilt basins, Henry\r\nearl of Essex, the last of the ancient name of Bourchier who bore the\r\ntitle. He was a splendid nobleman, distinguished in the martial games\r\nand gorgeous pageantries which then amused the court: he also boasted of\r\na royal lineage, being sprung from Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of\r\nEdward III.; and perhaps he was apprehensive lest this distinction might\r\nhereafter become as fatal to himself as it had lately proved to the\r\nunfortunate duke of Buckingham. But he perished a few years after by a\r\nfall from his horse; and leaving no male issue, the king, to the disgust\r\nof this great family, conferred the title on the low-bred Cromwel, then\r\nhis favorite minister.\r\n\r\nThe salt was borne by Henry marquis of Dorset, the unfortunate father of\r\nlady Jane Grey; who, after receiving the royal pardon for his share in\r\nthe criminal plot for setting the crown on the head of his daughter,\r\nagain took up arms in the rebellion of Wyat, and was brought to expiate\r\nthis treason on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nWilliam Courtney marquis of Exeter followed with the taper of virgin\r\nwax; a nobleman who had the misfortune to be very nearly allied to the\r\nEnglish throne; his mother being a daughter of Edward IV. He was at this\r\ntime in high favor with the king his cousin, who, after setting aside\r\nhis daughter Mary, had even declared him heir-apparent, to the\r\nprejudice of his own sisters: but three years after he fell a victim to\r\nthe jealousy of the king, on a charge of corresponding with his\r\nproscribed kinsman cardinal Pole: his honors and estates were forfeited;\r\nand his son, though still a child, was detained in close custody.\r\n\r\nThe chrism was borne by lady Mary Howard, the beautiful daughter of the\r\nduke of Norfolk; who lived not only to behold, but, by the evidence\r\nwhich she gave on his trial, to assist in the most unmerited\r\ncondemnation of her brother, the gallant and accomplished earl of Surry.\r\nThe king, by a trait of royal arrogance, selected this lady, descended\r\nfrom our Saxon monarchs and allied to all the first nobility, for the\r\nwife of his base-born son created duke of Richmond; but it does not\r\nappear that the spirit of the Howards was high enough in this reign to\r\nfeel the insult as it deserved.\r\n\r\nThe royal infant, wrapped in a mantle of purple velvet, having a long\r\ntrain furred with ermine, was carried by one of her godmothers, the\r\ndowager-duchess of Norfolk. Anne Boleyn was this lady's\r\nstep-grand-daughter: but in this alliance with royalty she had little\r\ncause to exult; still less in the closer one which was afterwards formed\r\nfor her by the elevation of her own grand-daughter Catherine Howard. On\r\ndiscovery of the ill conduct of this queen, the aged duchess was\r\noverwhelmed with disgrace; she was even declared guilty of misprision of\r\ntreason, and committed to custody, but was released by the king after\r\nthe blood of Catherine and her paramours had quenched his fury.\r\n\r\nThe dowager-marchioness of Dorset was the other godmother at the\r\nfont:--of the four sons of this lady, three perished on the scaffold;\r\nher grand-daughter lady Jane Grey shared the same fate; and the\r\nsurviving son died a prisoner during the reign of Elizabeth, for the\r\noffence of distributing a pamphlet asserting the title of the Suffolk\r\nline to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness of Exeter was the godmother at the confirmation, who had\r\nnot only the affliction to see her husband brought to an untimely end,\r\nand her only son wasting his youth in captivity, but, being herself\r\nattainted of high treason some time afterwards, underwent a long and\r\narbitrary imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn either hand of the duchess of Norfolk walked the dukes of Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk, the only nobles of that rank then existing in England.\r\n\r\nTheir names occur in conjunction on every public occasion, and in almost\r\nevery important transaction, civil and military, of the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., but the termination of their respective careers was strongly\r\ncontrasted. The duke of Suffolk had the extraordinary good fortune never\r\nto lose that favor with his master which he had gained as Charles\r\nBrandon, the partner of his youthful pleasures. What was a still more\r\nextraordinary instance of felicity, his marriage with the king's sister\r\nbrought to him neither misfortunes nor perils, and he did not live to\r\nwitness those which overtook his grand-daughters. He died in peace,\r\nlamented by a sovereign who knew his worth.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Norfolk, on the contrary, was powerful enough by birth and\r\nconnexions to impress Henry with fears for the tranquillity of his son's\r\nreign. The memory of former services was sacrificed to present alarm.\r\nAlmost with his last breath he ordered his old and faithful servant to\r\nthe scaffold; but even Henry was no longer absolute on his death-bed.\r\nFor once he was disobeyed, and Norfolk survived him; but the long years\r\nof his succeeding captivity were poorly compensated by a brief and tardy\r\nrestoration to liberty and honors under Mary.\r\n\r\nOne of the child's train-bearers was the countess of Kent. This was\r\nprobably the widow of the second earl of that title and of the name of\r\nGrey: she must therefore have been the daughter of the earl of Pembroke,\r\na zealous Yorkist who was slain fighting in the cause of Edward IV.\r\nHenry VIII. was doubtless aware that his best hereditary title to the\r\ncrown was derived from his mother, and during his reign the Yorkist\r\nfamilies enjoyed at least an equal share of favor with the Lancastrians,\r\nwhom his father had almost exclusively countenanced.\r\n\r\nThomas Boleyn earl of Wiltshire, the proud and happy grandfather of the\r\nprincely infant, supported the train on one side. It is not true that he\r\nafterwards, in his capacity of a privy councillor, pronounced sentence\r\nof death on his own son and daughter; even Henry was not inhuman enough\r\nto exact this of him; but he lived to witness their cruel and\r\ndisgraceful end, and died long before the prosperous days of his\r\nillustrious grandchild.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the train was borne by Edward Stanley third earl of\r\nDerby. This young nobleman had been a ward of Wolsey, and was carefully\r\neducated by that splendid patron of learning in his house and under his\r\nown eye. He proved himself a faithful and loyal subject to four\r\nsuccessive sovereigns; stood unshaken by the tempests of the most\r\nturbulent times; and died full of days in the possession of great\r\nriches, high hereditary honors, and universal esteem, in 1574.\r\n\r\nA splendid canopy was supported over the infant by four lords, three of\r\nthem destined to disastrous fates. One was her uncle, the elegant,\r\naccomplished, viscount Rochford, whom the impartial suffrage of\r\nposterity has fully acquitted of the odious crime for which he suffered\r\nby the mandate of a jealous tyrant.\r\n\r\nAnother was lord Hussey; whom a rash rebellion brought to the scaffold a\r\nfew years afterwards. The two others were brothers of that illustrious\r\nfamily of Howard, which furnished in this age alone more subjects for\r\ntragedy than \"Thebes or Pelops' line\" of old. Lord William, uncle to\r\nCatherine Howard, was arbitrarily adjudged to perpetual imprisonment and\r\nforfeiture of goods for concealing her misconduct; but Henry was pleased\r\nsoon after to remit the sentence: he lived to be eminent in the state\r\nunder the title of lord Howard of Effingham, and died peacefully in a\r\ngood old age. Lord Thomas suffered by the ambition so frequent in his\r\nhouse, of matching with the blood royal. He formed a secret marriage\r\nwith the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the king; on discovery of\r\nwhich, he was committed to a close imprisonment, whence he was only\r\nreleased by death.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony of baptism had been performed by Stokesly bishop of\r\nLondon, a solemn benediction was pronounced upon the future queen by\r\nCranmer, that learned and distinguished prelate, who may indeed be\r\nreproached with some too courtly condescensions to the will of an\r\nimperious master, and what is worse, with several cruel acts of\r\nreligious persecution; but whose virtues were many, whose general\r\ncharacter was mild and benevolent, and whose errors and weaknesses were\r\nfinally expiated by the flames of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIn the return from church, the gifts of the sponsors, consisting of cups\r\nand bowls, some gilded, and others of massy gold, were carried by four\r\npersons of quality: Henry Somerset second earl of Worcester, whose\r\nfather, notwithstanding his illegitimacy, had been acknowledged as a\r\nkinsman by Henry VII., and advanced to the peerage; lord Thomas Howard\r\nthe younger, a son of the duke of Norfolk who was restored in blood\r\nafter his father's attainder, and created lord Howard of Bindon; Thomas\r\nRatcliffe lord Fitzwalter, afterwards earl of Sussex; and sir John\r\nDudley, son of the detested associate of Empson, and afterwards the\r\nnotorious duke of Northumberland, whose crimes received at length their\r\ndue recompense in that ignominious death to which his guilty and\r\nextravagant projects had conducted so many comparatively innocent\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nWe are told, that on the same day and hour which gave birth to the\r\nprincess Elizabeth, a son was born to this \"bold bad man,\" who received\r\nthe name of Robert, and was known in after-times as earl of Leicester.\r\nIt was believed by the superstition of the age, that this coincidence of\r\ntheir nativities produced a secret and invincible sympathy which secured\r\nto Dudley, during life, the affections of his sovereign lady. It may\r\nwithout superstition be admitted, that this circumstance, seizing on the\r\nromantic imagination of the princess, might produce a first impression,\r\nwhich Leicester's personal advantages, his insinuating manners, and\r\nconsummate art of feigning, all contributed to render deep and\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nThe personal history of Elizabeth may truly be said to begin with her\r\nbirth; for she had scarcely entered her second year when her\r\nmarriage--that never-accomplished project, which for half a century\r\nafterwards inspired so many vain hopes and was the subject of so many\r\nfruitless negotiations, was already proposed as an article of a treaty\r\nbetween France and England.\r\n\r\nHenry had caused an act of succession to be passed, by which his divorce\r\nwas confirmed, the authority of the pope disclaimed, and the crown\r\nsettled on his issue by Anne Boleyn. But, as if half-repenting the\r\nboldness of his measures, he opened a negotiation almost immediately\r\nwith Francis I., for the purpose of obtaining a declaration by that king\r\nand his nobility in favor of his present marriage, and the intercession\r\nof Francis for the revocation of the papal censures fulminated against\r\nhim. And in consideration of these acts of friendship, he offered to\r\nengage the hand of Elizabeth to the duke d'Angouleme, third son of the\r\nFrench king. But Francis was unable to prevail upon the new pope to\r\nannul the acts of his predecessor; and probably not wishing to connect\r\nhimself more closely with a prince already regarded as a heretic, he\r\nsuffered the proposal of marriage to fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of Zwingle and of Luther had at this time made\r\nconsiderable progress among Henry's subjects, and the great work of\r\nreformation was begun in England. Several smaller monasteries had been\r\nsuppressed; the pope's supremacy was preached against by public\r\nauthority; and the parliament, desirous of widening the breach between\r\nthe king and the pontiff, declared the former, head of the English\r\nchurch. After some hesitation, Henry accepted the office, and wrote a\r\nbook in defence of his conduct. The queen was attached, possibly by\r\nprinciple, and certainly by interest, to the antipapal party, which\r\nalone admitted the validity of the royal divorce, and consequently of\r\nher marriage; and she had already engaged her chaplain Dr. Parker, a\r\nlearned and zealous reformist, to keep a watchful eye over the childhood\r\nof her daughter, and early to imbue her mind with the true principles of\r\nreligious knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut Henry, whose passions and interests alone, not his theological\r\nconvictions, had set him in opposition to the old church establishment,\r\nto the ceremonies and doctrines of which he was even zealously attached,\r\nbegan to be apprehensive that the whole fabric would be swept away by\r\nthe strong tide of popular opinion which was now turned against it, and\r\nhe hastened to interpose in its defence. He brought to the stake several\r\npersons who denied the real presence, as a terror to the reformers;\r\nwhilst at the same time he showed his resolution to quell the adherents\r\nof popery, by causing bishop Fisher and sir Thomas More to be attainted\r\nof treason, for refusing such part of the oath of succession as implied\r\nthe invalidity of the king's first marriage, and thus, in effect,\r\ndisallowed the authority of the papal dispensation in virtue of which it\r\nhad been celebrated.\r\n\r\nThus were opened those dismal scenes of religious persecution and\r\npolitical cruelty from which the mind of Elizabeth was to receive its\r\nearly and indelible impressions.\r\n\r\nThe year 1536, which proved even more fertile than its predecessor in\r\nmelancholy incidents and tragical catastrophes, opened with the death of\r\nCatherine of Arragon; an event equally welcome, in all probability, both\r\nto the sufferer herself, whom tedious years of trouble and mortification\r\nmust have rendered weary of a world which had no longer a hope to\r\nflatter her; and to the ungenerous woman who still beheld her, discarded\r\nas she was, with the sentiments of an enemy and a rival. It is\r\nimpossible to contemplate the life and character of this royal lady,\r\nwithout feelings of the deepest commiseration. As a wife, the bitter\r\nhumiliations which she was doomed to undergo were entirely unmerited;\r\nfor not only was her modesty unquestioned, but her whole conduct towards\r\nthe king was a perfect model of conjugal love and duty. As a queen and a\r\nmother, her firmness, her dignity, and her tenderness, deserved a far\r\nother recompense than to see herself degraded, on the infamous plea of\r\nincest, from the rank of royalty, and her daughter, so long heiress to\r\nthe English throne, branded with illegitimacy, and cast out alike from\r\nthe inheritance and the affections of her father. But the memory of this\r\nunhappy princess has been embalmed by the genius of Shakespeare, in the\r\nnoble drama of which he has made her the touching and majestic heroine;\r\nand let not the praise of magnanimity be denied to the daughter of Anne\r\nBoleyn, in permitting those wrongs and those sufferings which were the\r\nprice of her glory, nay of her very existence, to be thus impressively\r\noffered to the compassion of her people.\r\n\r\nHenry was moved to tears on reading the tender and pious letter\r\naddressed to him by the dying hand of Catherine; and he marked by\r\nseveral small but expressive acts, the respect, or rather the\r\ncompunction, with which the recollection of her could not fail to\r\ninspire him. Anne Boleyn paid to the memory of the princess-dowager of\r\nWales--such was the title now given to Catherine--the unmeaning\r\ncompliment of putting on yellow mourning; the color assigned to queens\r\nby the fashion of France: but neither humanity nor discretion restrained\r\nher from open demonstrations of the satisfaction afforded her by the\r\nmelancholy event.\r\n\r\nShort was her unfeeling triumph. She brought into the world a few days\r\nafterwards, a dead son; and this second disappointment of his hopes\r\ncompleted that disgust to his queen which satiety, and perhaps also a\r\ngrowing passion for another object, was already beginning to produce in\r\nthe mind of the king.\r\n\r\nIt is traditionally related, that at Jane Seymour's first coming to\r\ncourt, the queen, espying a jewel hung round her neck, wished to look at\r\nit; and struck with the young lady's reluctance to submit it to her\r\ninspection, snatched it from her with violence, when she found it to\r\ncontain the king's picture, presented by himself to the wearer. From\r\nthis day she dated her own decline in the affections of her husband, and\r\nthe ascendancy of her rival. However this might be, it is certain that\r\nthe king about this time began to regard the conduct of his once\r\nidolized Anne Boleyn with an altered eye. That easy gaiety of manner\r\nwhich he had once remarked with delight, as an indication of the\r\ninnocence of her heart and the artlessness of her disposition, was now\r\nbeheld by him as a culpable levity which offended his pride and alarmed\r\nhis jealousy. His impetuous temper, with which \"once to suspect was once\r\nto be resolved,\" disdained to investigate proofs or to fathom motives; a\r\npretext alone was wanting to his rising fury, and this he was not long\r\nin finding.\r\n\r\nOn May-day, then observed at court as a high festival, solemn justs were\r\nheld at Greenwich, before the king and queen, in which viscount\r\nRochford, the queen's brother, was chief challenger, and Henry Norris\r\nprincipal defender. In the midst of the entertainment, the king suddenly\r\nrose and quitted the place in anger; but on what particular provocation\r\nis not certainly known. Saunders the Jesuit, the great calumniator of\r\nAnne Boleyn, says that it was on seeing his consort drop her\r\nhandkerchief, which Norris picked up and wiped his face with. The queen\r\nimmediately retired, and the next day was committed to custody. Her\r\nearnest entreaties to be permitted to see the king were disregarded, and\r\nshe was sent to the Tower on a charge of treason and adultery.\r\n\r\nLord Rochford, Norris, one Smeton a musician, and Brereton and another\r\ngentleman of the bed-chamber, were likewise apprehended, and brought to\r\ntrial on the accusation of criminal intercourse with the queen. They\r\nwere all convicted; but from the few particulars which have come down to\r\nus, it seems to be justly inferred, that the evidence produced against\r\nsome at least of these unhappy gentlemen, was slight and inconclusive.\r\nLord Rochford is universally believed to have fallen a victim to the\r\natrocious perjuries of his wife, who was very improperly admitted as a\r\nwitness against him, and whose infamous conduct was afterwards fully\r\nbrought to light. No absolute criminality appears to have been proved\r\nagainst Weston and Brereton; but Smeton confessed the fact. Norris died\r\nmuch more generously: he protested that he would rather perish a\r\nthousand times than accuse an innocent person; that he believed the\r\nqueen to be perfectly guiltless; he, at least, could accuse her of\r\nnothing; and in this declaration he persisted to the last. His\r\nexpressions, if truly reported, seem to imply that he might have saved\r\nhimself by criminating the queen: but besides the extreme improbability\r\nthat the king would have shown or promised any mercy to such a\r\ndelinquent, we know in fact that the confession of Smeton did not obtain\r\nfor him even a reprieve: it is therefore absurd to represent Norris as\r\nhaving died in vindication of the honor of the queen; and the favor\r\nafterwards shown to his son by Elizabeth, had probably little connexion\r\nwith any tenderness for the memory of her mother, a sentiment which she\r\ncertainly exhibited in no other circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe trial and condemnation of the queen followed. The process was\r\nconducted with that open disregard of the first principles of justice\r\nand equity then universal in all cases of high treason: no counsel were\r\nassigned her, no witnesses confronted with her, and it does not appear\r\nthat she was even informed of Smeton's confession: but whether, after\r\nall, she died innocent, is a problem which there now exist no means of\r\nsolving, and which it is somewhat foreign from the purpose of this work\r\nto discuss.\r\n\r\nOne part of this subject, however, on account of the intimate relation\r\nwhich it bears to the history of Elizabeth, and the influence which it\r\nmay be presumed to have exercised in the formation of her character,\r\nmust be treated somewhat at large.\r\n\r\nThe common law of England, by an anomaly truly barbarous, denounced,\r\nagainst females only, who should be found guilty of high treason, the\r\npunishment of burning. By menaces of putting into execution this\r\nhorrible sentence, instead of commuting it for decapitation, Anne Boleyn\r\nwas induced to acknowledge some legal impediment to her marriage with\r\nthe king; and on this confession alone, Cranmer, with his usual\r\nsubserviency, gratified his royal master by pronouncing that union null\r\nand void, and its offspring illegitimate.\r\n\r\nWhat this impediment, real or pretended, might be, we only learn from a\r\npublic declaration made immediately afterwards by the earl of\r\nNorthumberland, stating, that whereas it had been pretended, that a\r\nprecontract had subsisted between himself and the late queen, he has\r\ndeclared upon oath before the lords of the council, and taken the\r\nsacrament upon it, that no such contract had ever passed between them.\r\nIn explanation of this protest, the noble historian of Henry VIII.[1]\r\nfurnishes us with the following particulars. That the earl of\r\nNorthumberland, when lord Percy, had made proposals of marriage to Anne\r\nBoleyn, which she had accepted, being yet a stranger to the passion of\r\nthe king; that Henry, unable to bear the idea of losing her, but averse\r\nas yet to a declaration of his sentiments, employed Wolsey to dissuade\r\nthe father of lord Percy from giving his consent to their union, in\r\nwhich he succeeded; the earl of Northumberland probably becoming aware\r\nhow deeply the personal feelings of the king were concerned: that lord\r\nPercy, however, refused to give up the lady, alleging in the first\r\ninstance that he had gone too far to recede with honor; but was\r\nafterwards compelled by his father to form another matrimonial\r\nconnexion. It should appear by this statement, that some engagement had\r\nin fact subsisted between Northumberland and Anne; but there is no\r\nnecessity for supposing it to have been a contract of that solemn nature\r\nwhich, according to the law as it then stood, would have rendered null\r\nthe subsequent marriage of either party. The protestation of the earl\r\nwas confirmed by the most solemn sanctions; which there is no ground for\r\nsupposing him capable of violating, especially as on this occasion, so\r\nfar from gaining any advantage by it, he was likely to give high offence\r\nto the king. If then, as appears most probable, the confession by which\r\nAnne Boleyn disinherited and illegitimatised her daughter was false; a\r\nperjury so wicked and cowardly must brand her memory with everlasting\r\ninfamy:--even should the contrary have been the fact, the transaction\r\ndoes her little honor; in either case it affords ample justification to\r\nthat daughter in leaving, as she did, her remains without a monument and\r\nher conduct without an apology.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Lord Herbert of Chirbury.]\r\n\r\nThe precarious and equivocal condition to which the little Elizabeth was\r\nreduced by the divorce and death of her mother, will be best illustrated\r\nby the following extracts of a letter addressed soon after the event, by\r\nlady Bryan her governess, to lord Cromwel. It may at the same time amuse\r\nthe modern reader to remark the minute details on which, in that day,\r\nthe first minister of state was expected to bestow his personal\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"...My lord, when your lordship was last here, it pleased you to say,\r\nthat I should not mistrust the king's grace, nor your lordship.

He answered, that he would. Rich then\r\ndemanded, why he refused to acknowledge a head of the church so\r\nappointed? \"Because,\" replied More, \"a parliament can make a king and\r\ndepose him, and that every parliament-man may give his consent\r\nthereunto, but a subject cannot be bound so in case of supremacy[3].\"\r\nBold as such doctrine respecting the power of parliaments would now be\r\nthought, it could not well be controverted at a time when examples were\r\nstill recent of kings of the line of York or Lancaster alternately\r\nelevated or degraded by a vote of the two houses, and when the father of\r\nthe reigning sovereign had occupied the throne in virtue of such a\r\nnomination more than by right of birth.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: See Herbert's Henry VIII.]\r\n\r\nBut the obvious inconveniences and dangers attending the exercise of\r\nthis power of choice, had induced the parliaments of Henry VIII. to join\r\nwith him in various acts for the regulation of the succession. It was\r\nprobably with the concurrence of this body, that in 1532 he had declared\r\nhis cousin, the marquis of Exeter, heir to the crown; yet this very\r\nact, by which the king excluded not only his daughter Mary, but his two\r\nsisters and their children, every one of whom had a prior right\r\naccording to the rules at present received, must have caused the\r\nsovereignty to be regarded rather as elective in the royal family than\r\nproperly hereditary--a fatal idea, which converted every member of that\r\nfamily possessed of wealth, talents, or popularity, into a formidable\r\nrival, if not to the sovereign on the throne, at least to his next heir,\r\nif a woman or a minor, and which may be regarded as the immediate\r\noccasion of those cruel proscriptions which stained with kindred blood\r\nthe closing years of the reign of Henry, and have stamped upon him to\r\nall posterity the odious character of a tyrant.\r\n\r\nThe first sufferer by the suspicions of the king was lord Thomas Howard,\r\nhalf-brother to the duke of Norfolk, who was attainted of high treason\r\nin the parliament of 1536, for having secretly entered into a contract\r\nof marriage with lady Margaret Douglas, the king's niece, through which\r\nalliance he was accused of aiming at the crown. For this offence he was\r\nconfined in the Tower till his death; but on what evidence of traitorous\r\ndesigns, or by what law, except the arbitrary mandate of the monarch\r\nconfirmed by a subservient parliament, it would be difficult to say.\r\nThat his marriage was forbidden by no law, is evident from the passing\r\nof an act immediately afterwards, making it penal to marry any female\r\nstanding in the first degree of relationship to the king, without his\r\nknowledge and consent.\r\n\r\nThe lady Margaret was daughter to Henry's eldest sister, the\r\nqueen-dowager of Scotland, by her second husband the earl of Angus. She\r\nwas born in England, whither her mother had been compelled to fly for\r\nrefuge by the turbulent state of her son's kingdom, and the ill success\r\nof her own and her husband's struggles for the acquisition of political\r\npower. In the English court the lady Margaret had likewise been\r\neducated, and had formed connexions of friendship; whilst her brother\r\nJames V. laboured under the antipathy with which the English then\r\nregarded those northern neighbours, with whom they were involved in\r\nalmost perpetual hostilities. It might easily therefore have happened,\r\nin case of the king's death without male heirs, that in spite of the\r\npower recently bestowed on him by parliament of disposing of the crown\r\nby will, which it is very uncertain how he would have employed, a\r\nconnexion with the potent house of Howard might have given the title of\r\nlady Margaret a preference over that of any other competitor. Henry was\r\nstruck with this danger, however distant and contingent: he caused his\r\nniece, as well as her spouse, to be imprisoned; and though he restored\r\nher to liberty in a few months, and the death of Howard, not long\r\nafterwards, set her free from this ill-starred engagement, she ventured\r\nnot to form another, till the king himself, at the end of several years,\r\ngave her in marriage to the earl of Lenox; by whom she became the mother\r\nof lord Darnley, and through him the progenitrix of a line of princes\r\ndestined to unite another crown to the ancient inheritance of the\r\nPlantagenets and the Tudors.\r\n\r\nThe princess Mary, after the removal of Anne Boleyn, who had exercised\r\ntowards her the utmost insolence and harshness, ventured upon some\r\novertures towards a reconciliation with her father; but he would accept\r\nthem on no other conditions than her adopting his religious creed,\r\nacknowledging his supremacy, denying the authority of the pope, and\r\nconfessing the unlawfulness of her mother's marriage. It was long before\r\nmotives of expediency, and the persuasion of friends, could wring from\r\nMary a reluctant assent to these cruel articles: her compliance was\r\nrewarded by the return of her father's affection, but not immediately by\r\nher reinstatement in the order of succession. She saw the child of Anne\r\nBoleyn still a distinguished object of the king's paternal tenderness;\r\nthe new queen was likely to give another heir to the crown; and whatever\r\nhopes she, with the catholic party in general, had founded on the\r\ndisgrace of his late spouse, became frustrated by succeeding events.\r\n\r\nThe death of Catherine of Arragon seemed to have removed the principal\r\nobstacles to an agreement between the king and the pope; and the holy\r\nfather now deigned to make some advances towards a son whom he hoped to\r\nfind disposed to penitence: but they were absolutely rejected by Henry,\r\nwho had ceased to dread his spiritual thunders. The parliament and the\r\nconvocation showed themselves prepared to adopt, without hesitation, the\r\nnumerous changes suggested by the king in the ancient ritual; and\r\nCromwel, with influence not apparently diminished by the fall of the\r\nlate patroness of the protestant party, presided in the latter assembly\r\nwith the title of vicegerent, and with powers unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of monasteries was now carried on with increasing rigor,\r\nand thousands of their unfortunate inhabitants were mercilessly turned\r\nout to beg or starve. These, dispersing themselves over the country, in\r\nwhich their former hospitalities had rendered them generally popular,\r\nworked strongly on the passions of the many, already discontented at the\r\nimposition of new taxes, which served to convince them that the king and\r\nhis courtiers would be the only gainers by the plunder of the church;\r\nand formidable insurrections were in some counties the result. In\r\nLincolnshire the commotions were speedily suppressed by the\r\ninterposition of the earl of Shrewsbury and other loyal noblemen; but it\r\nwas necessary to send into Yorkshire a considerable army under the duke\r\nof Norfolk. Through the dexterous management of this leader, who was\r\njudged to favor the cause of the revolters as much as his duty to his\r\nsovereign and a regard to his own safety would permit, little blood was\r\nshed in the field; but much flowed afterwards on the scaffold, where the\r\nlords Darcy and Hussey, sir Thomas Percy, brother to the earl of\r\nNorthumberland, and several private gentlemen, suffered as traitors.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of these risings strengthened, as usual, the hands of\r\ngovernment, but at the expense of converting into an object of dread, a\r\nmonarch who in the earlier and brighter period of his reign had been\r\nregarded with sentiments of admiration and love.\r\n\r\nIn lord Herbert's narrative of this insurrection, we meet with a passage\r\ntoo remarkable to be omitted. \"But the king, who was informed from\r\ndivers parts, but chiefly from Yorkshire, that the people began there\r\nalso to take arms, and knowing of what great consequence it might be if\r\nthe great persons in those parts, though the rumour were false, should\r\nbe said to join with him, had commanded George earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nThomas Manners earl of Rutland, and George Hastings earl of Huntingdon,\r\nto make a proclamation to the Lincolnshire-men, summoning and commanding\r\nthem on their allegiance and peril of their lives to return; which, as\r\nit much disheartened them, so many stole away,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn this potency of the hereditary aristocracy of the country, and\r\ncomparative feebleness, on some occasions at least, of the authority of\r\nthe most despotic sovereign whom England had yet seen on the throne, we\r\ndiscern at once the excuse which Henry would make to himself for his\r\nseverities against the nobility, and the motive of that extreme\r\npopularity of manners by which Elizabeth aimed at attaching to herself\r\nthe affections of the middling and lower orders of her subjects.\r\n\r\nSoon after these events, Henry confirmed the new impressions which his\r\nsubjects had received of his character, by an act of extraordinary, but\r\nnot unprovoked, severity, which involved in destruction one of the most\r\nancient and powerful houses among the peerage of Ireland, that of\r\nFitzgerald earl of Kildare. The nobleman who now bore this title had\r\nmarried for his second wife lady Elizabeth Grey, daughter of the first\r\nmarquis of Dorset, and first-cousin to the king by his mother; he had\r\nbeen favored at court, and was at this time lord deputy of Ireland. But\r\nthe country being in a very disturbed state, and the deputy accused of\r\nmany acts of violence, he had obeyed with great reluctance a summons to\r\nanswer for his conduct before the king in council, leaving his eldest\r\nson to exercise his office during his absence. On his arrival, he was\r\ncommitted to the Tower, and his son, alarmed by the false report of his\r\nhaving lost his head, broke out immediately into a furious rebellion.\r\nAfter a temporary success, Thomas Fitzgerald was reduced to great\r\ndifficulties: at the same time a promise of pardon was held out to him;\r\nand confiding in it he surrendered himself to lord Leonard Grey, brother\r\nto the countess his step-mother. His five uncles, also implicated in the\r\nguilt of rebellion, were seized by surprise, or deceived into\r\nsubmission. The whole six were then conveyed to England in the same\r\nship; and all, in spite of the entreaties and remonstrances of lord\r\nLeonard Grey, who considered his own honor as pledged for the safety of\r\ntheir lives, were hanged at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nThe aged earl had died in the Tower on receiving news of his son's rash\r\nenterprise; and a posthumous attainder being issued against him, his\r\nlands and goods were forfeited. The king however, in pity to the widow,\r\nand as a slight atonement for so cruel an injustice, permitted one of\r\nher daughters to retain some poor remains of the family plate and\r\nvaluables; and another of them, coming to England, appears to have\r\nreceived her education at Hunsdon palace with the princesses Mary and\r\nElizabeth her relations. Here she was seen by Henry earl of Surry, whose\r\nchaste and elegant muse has handed her down to posterity as the lovely\r\nGeraldine, the object of his fervent but fruitless devotion. She was\r\nmarried first to sir Anthony Brown, and afterwards became the wife of\r\nthe earl of Lincoln, surviving by many years her noble and unfortunate\r\nadmirer.\r\n\r\nThe countess of Kildare, and the younger of her two sons, likewise\r\nremained in England obscure and unmolested; but the merciless rancour of\r\nHenry against the house of Fitzgerald still pursued its destitute and\r\nunoffending heir, who was struggling through a series of adventures the\r\nmost perilous and the most romantic.\r\n\r\nThis boy, named Gerald, then about twelve years old, had been left by\r\nhis father at a house in Kildare, under the care and tuition of Leverous\r\na priest who was his foster-brother. The child was lying ill of the\r\nsmall-pox, when the news arrived that his brother and uncles had been\r\nsent prisoners to England: but his affectionate guardian, justly\r\napprehensive of greater danger to his young charge, wrapped him up as\r\ncarefully as he could, and conveyed him away with all speed to the house\r\nof one of his sisters, where he remained till he was quite recovered.\r\nThence his tutor removed him successively into the territories of two or\r\nthree different Irish chieftains, who sheltered him for about three\r\nquarters of a year, after which he carried him to his aunt the lady\r\nElenor, at that time widow of a chief named Maccarty Reagh.\r\n\r\nThis lady had long been sought in marriage by O'Donnel lord of\r\nTyrconnel, to whose suit she had been unpropitious: but wrought upon by\r\nthe hope of being able to afford effectual protection to her unfortunate\r\nnephew, she now consented to an immediate union; and taking Gerald along\r\nwith her to her new home in the county of Donegal, she there hospitably\r\nentertained him for about a year. But the jealous spirit of the\r\nimplacable king seemed to know no rest while this devoted youth still\r\nbreathed the air of liberty, and he caused a great reward to be offered\r\nfor his apprehension, which the base-minded O'Donnel immediately sought\r\nto appropriate by delivering him up. Fortunately the lady Elenor\r\ndiscovered his intentions in time, and instantly causing her nephew to\r\ndisguise his person, and storing him, like a bountiful aunt, with\r\n\"sevenscore portugueses,\" she put him under the charge of Leverous and\r\nan old servant of his father's, and shipped him on board a vessel bound\r\nfor St. Malo's.\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured his escape, she loftily expostulated with her\r\nhusband on his villainy in plotting to betray her kinsman, whom she had\r\nstipulated that he should protect to the utmost of his power; and she\r\nbid him know, that as the danger of the youth had alone induced her to\r\nform any connection with him, so the assurance of his safety should\r\ncause her to sequester herself for ever from the society of so base and\r\nmercenary a wretch: and hereupon, collecting all that belonged to her,\r\nshe quitted O'Donnel and returned to her own country.\r\n\r\nGerald, in the mean time, arrived without accident in Bretagne, and was\r\nfavorably received by the governor of that province, when the king of\r\nFrance, being informed of his situation, gave him a place about the\r\ndauphin. Sir John Wallop however, the English embassador, soon demanded\r\nhim, in virtue of a treaty between the two countries for the delivering\r\nup of offenders and proscribed persons; and while the king demurred to\r\nthe requisition, Gerald consulted his safety by making a speedy retreat\r\ninto Flanders. Thither his steps were dogged by an Irish servant of the\r\nembassador's; but the governor of Valenciennes protected him by\r\nimprisoning this man, till the youth himself generously begged his\r\nrelease; and he reached the emperor's court at Brussels, without further\r\nmolestation. But here also the English embassador demanded him; the\r\nemperor however excused himself from giving up a fugitive whose youth\r\nsufficiently attested his innocence, and sent him privately to the\r\nbishop of Liege, with a pension of a hundred crowns a month. The bishop\r\nentertained him very honorably, placing him in a monastery, and watching\r\ncarefully over the safety of his person, till, at the end of half a\r\nyear, his mother's kinsman, cardinal Pole, sent for him into Italy.\r\n\r\nBefore he would admit the young Irishman to his presence, the cardinal\r\nrequired him to learn Italian; and allowing him an annuity, placed him\r\nfirst with the bishop of Verona, then with a cardinal, and afterwards\r\nwith the duke of Mantua. At the end of a year and a half he invited him\r\nto Rome, and soon becoming attached to him, took him into his house, and\r\nfor three years had him instructed under his own eye in all the\r\naccomplishments of a finished gentleman. At the end of this time, when\r\nGerald had nearly attained the age of nineteen, his generous patron gave\r\nhim the choice either of pursuing his studies or of travelling to seek\r\nhis adventures. The youth preferred the latter; and repairing to Naples,\r\nhe fell in with some knights of Rhodes, whom he accompanied to Malta,\r\nand thence to Tripoli, a place at that time possessed by the order,\r\nwhence they carried on fierce war against the \"Turks and miscreants,\"\r\nspoiling and sacking their villages and towns, and taking many prisoners\r\nwhom they sold to the Christians for slaves. In these proceedings, the\r\nyoung adventurer took a strenuous and valiant part, much to his profit;\r\nfor in less than a year he returned to Rome laden with a rich booty.\r\n\"Proud was the cardinal to hear of his prosperous exploits,\" and\r\nincreased his pension to three hundred pounds a year. Shortly after, he\r\nentered into the service of Cosmo duke of Florence, and remained three\r\nyears his master of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of Henry's death at length put an end to his exile, and he\r\nhastened to London in the company of some foreign embassadors, and still\r\nattended by his faithful guardian Leverous. Appearing at king Edward's\r\ncourt in a mask, or ball, he had the good fortune to make a deep\r\nimpression on the heart of a young lady, daughter to sir Anthony Brown,\r\nwhom he married; and through the intercession of her friends was\r\nrestored to a part of his inheritance by the young monarch, who also\r\nknighted him. In the next reign, the interest of cardinal Pole procured\r\nhis reinstatement in all the titles and honors of his ancestors. He was\r\na faithful and affectionate subject to queen Elizabeth, in whose reign\r\nhe turned protestant; was by her greatly favored, and finally died in\r\npeace in 1585.[4]\r\n\r\nThat ill-directed restlessness which formed so striking a feature in the\r\ncharacter of Henry VIII. had already prompted him to interfere, as we\r\nhave seen, on more than one occasion, with the order of succession; and\r\nthe dangerous consequences of these capricious acts with respect to the\r\nseveral branches of the royal family have already been observed. To the\r\npeople at large also, his instability on so momentous a point was\r\nharassing and alarming, and they became as much at a loss to conjecture\r\nwhat successor, as what religion, he would at last bequeath them.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, great indeed must have been the joy in the\r\ncourt and in the nation on the occurrence of an event calculated to end\r\nall doubts and remove all difficulties--the birth of a prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThis auspicious infant seemed to strangle in his cradle the serpents of\r\ncivil discord. Every lip hastened to proffer him its homage; every heart\r\nunited, or seemed at least to unite, in the general burst of\r\nthankfulness and congratulation.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: See Chron. of Ireland in Holinshed, _pass_. Collins's\r\nPeerage, by sir E. Brydges, article _Viscount Leinster_.]\r\n\r\nThe zealous papists formed the party most to be suspected of insincerity\r\nin their professions of satisfaction; but the princess Mary set them an\r\nexcellent example of graceful submission to what was inevitable, by\r\nsoliciting the office of godmother. Her sister was happily too young to\r\nbe infected with court-jealousies, or to behold in a brother an\r\nunwelcome intruder, who came to snatch from her the inheritance of a\r\ncrown: between Elizabeth and Edward an attachment truly fraternal sprung\r\nup with the first dawnings of reason; and notwithstanding the fatal blow\r\ngiven to her interests by the act of settlement extorted from his dying\r\nhand, this princess never ceased to cherish his memory, and to mention\r\nhim in terms of affectionate regret.\r\n\r\nThe conjugal felicities of Henry were destined to be of short duration,\r\nand before he could receive the felicitations of his subjects on the\r\nbirth of his son, the mother was snatched away by death. The queen died\r\ndeeply regretted, not only by her husband, but by the whole court, whom\r\nshe had attached by the uncommon sweetness of her disposition. To the\r\nprincess Mary her behaviour had been the reverse of that by which her\r\npredecessor had disgraced herself; and the little Elizabeth had received\r\nfrom her marks of a maternal tenderness. Jane Seymour was accounted a\r\nfavourer of the protestant cause; but as she was apparently free from\r\nthe ambition of interfering in state affairs, her death had no further\r\npolitical influence than what resulted from the king's marriage thus\r\nbecoming once more an object of speculation and court intrigue. It did\r\nnot even give a check to the advancement of her two brothers, destined\r\nto act and to suffer so conspicuously in the fierce contentions of the\r\nensuing minority; for the king seemed to regard it as a point of policy\r\nto elevate those maternal relations of his son, on whose care he relied\r\nto watch over the safety of his person in case of his own demise, to a\r\ndignity and importance which the proudest nobles of the land might view\r\nwith respect or fear. Sir Edward Seymour, who had been created lord\r\nBeauchamp the year before, was now made earl of Hertford; and high\r\nplaces at court and commands in the army attested the favor of his royal\r\nbrother-in-law. Thomas Seymour, afterwards lord high-admiral, attained\r\nduring this reign no higher dignity than that of knighthood; but\r\nconsiderable pecuniary grants were bestowed upon him; and whilst he saw\r\nhis wealth increase, he was secretly extending his influence, and\r\nfeeding his aspiring spirit with fond anticipations of future greatness.\r\n\r\nAll now seemed tranquil: but a discerning eye might already have beheld\r\nfresh tempests gathering in the changeful atmosphere of the English\r\ncourt. The jealousies of the king, become too habitual to be discarded,\r\nhad in fact only received a new direction from the birth of his son: his\r\nmind was perpetually haunted with the dread of leaving him, a\r\ndefenceless minor, in the hands of contending parties in religion, and\r\nof a formidable and factious nobility; and for the sake of obviating the\r\ndistant and contingent evils which he apprehended from this source, he\r\nshowed himself ready to pour forth whole rivers of the best blood of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe person beyond all comparison most dreaded and detested by Henry at\r\nthis juncture was his cousin Reginald Pole, for whom when a youth he had\r\nconceived a warm affection, whose studies he had encouraged by the gift\r\nof a deanery and the hope of further church-preferment, and of whose\r\ningratitude he always believed himself entitled to complain. It was the\r\nlong-contested point of the lawfulness of Henry's marriage with his\r\nbrother's widow, which set the kinsmen at variance. Pole had from the\r\nfirst refused to concur with the university of Paris, in which he was\r\nthen residing, in its condemnation of this union: afterwards, alarmed\r\nprobably at the king's importunities on the subject, he had obtained the\r\npermission then necessary for leaving England, to which he had returned,\r\nand travelled into Italy. Here he formed friendships with the most\r\neminent defenders of the papal authority, now incensed to the highest\r\ndegree against Henry, on account of his having declared himself head of\r\nthe English church; and both his convictions and his passions becoming\r\nstill more strongly engaged on the side which he had already espoused,\r\nhe published a work on the unity of the church, in which the conduct of\r\nhis sovereign and benefactor became the topic of his vehement invective.\r\n\r\nThe offended king, probably with treacherous intentions, invited Pole to\r\ncome to England, and explain to him in person certain difficult passages\r\nof his book: but his kinsman was too wary to trust himself in such\r\nhands; and his refusal to obey this summons, which implied a final\r\nrenunciation of his country and all his early prospects, was\r\nimmediately rewarded by the pope, through the emperor's concurrence,\r\nwith a cardinal's hat and the appointment of legate to Flanders. But\r\nalarmed, as well as enraged, at seeing the man whom he regarded as his\r\nbitterest personal enemy placed in a situation so convenient for\r\ncarrying on intrigues with the disaffected papists in England, Henry\r\naddressed so strong a remonstrance to the governess of the Netherlands,\r\nas caused her to send the cardinal out of the country before he had\r\nbegun to exercise the functions of his legantine office.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, to maintain any intercourse or correspondence with Pole\r\nwas treated by the king as either in itself an act of treason, or at\r\nleast as conclusive evidence of traitorous intentions. He believed that\r\nthe darkest designs were in agitation against his own government and his\r\nson's succession; and the circumstance of the cardinal's still declining\r\nto take any but deacon's orders, notwithstanding his high dignity in the\r\nchurch, suggested to him the suspicion that his kinsman aimed at the\r\ncrown itself, through a marriage with the princess Mary, of whose\r\nlegitimacy he had shown himself so strenuous a champion. What foundation\r\nthere might be for such an idea it is difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nThere is an author who relates that the lady Mary was educated with the\r\ncardinal under his mother, and hints that an early attachment had thus\r\nbeen formed between them[5]: A statement manifestly inaccurate, since\r\nPole was sixteen years older than the princess; though it is not\r\nimprobable that Mary, during some period of her youth, might be placed\r\nunder the care of the countess of Salisbury, and permitted to associate\r\nwith her son on easy and affectionate terms. It is well known that after\r\nMary's accession, Charles V. impeded the journey of Pole into England\r\ntill her marriage with his son Philip had been actually solemnized; but\r\nthis was probably rather from a persuasion of the inexpediency of the\r\ncardinal's sooner opening his legantine commission in England, than from\r\nany fear of his supplanting in Mary's affections his younger rival,\r\nthough some have ascribed to the emperor the latter motive.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: See Lloyd's Worthies, article _Pole_.]\r\n\r\nWhen however it is recollected, that in consequence of Henry's having\r\ncaused a posthumous judgement of treason to be pronounced against the\r\npapal martyr Becket, his shrine to be destroyed, his bones burned, and\r\nhis ashes scattered, the pope had at length, in 1538, fulminated against\r\nhim the long-suspended sentence of excommunication, and made a donation\r\nof his kingdom to the king of Scots, and thus impressed the sanction of\r\nreligion on any rebellious attempts of his Roman-catholic subjects,--it\r\nwould be too much to pronounce the apprehensions of the monarch to have\r\nbeen altogether chimerical. But his suspicion appears, as usual, to have\r\ngone beyond the truth, and his anger to have availed itself of slight\r\npretexts to ruin where he feared and hated.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of his mind when the treachery or weakness of Geffrey\r\nPole furnished him with intelligence of a traitorous correspondence\r\ncarried on with his brother the cardinal by several persons of\r\ndistinction attached to the papal interest, and in which he had himself\r\nbeen a sharer. On his information, the marquis of Exeter, viscount\r\nMontacute, sir Edward Nevil, and sir Nicholas Carew, were apprehended,\r\ntried and found guilty of high treason. Public opinion was at this time\r\nnothing; and notwithstanding the rank, consequence and popularity of the\r\nmen whose lives were sacrificed on this occasion; notwithstanding that\r\nsecret consciousness of his own ill-will towards them, which ought to\r\nhave rendered Henry more than usually cautious in his proceedings,--not\r\neven an attempt was made to render their guilt clear and notorious to\r\nthe nation at large; and posterity scarcely even knows of what designs\r\nthey were accused; to overt acts it is quite certain that they had not\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nHenry lord Montacute was obnoxious on more than one account: he was the\r\nbrother of cardinal Pole; and as eldest son of Margaret, sole surviving\r\nchild of the duke of Clarence and heiress to her brother the earl of\r\nWarwick, he might be regarded as succeeding to those claims on the crown\r\nwhich under Henry VII. had proved fatal to the last-mentioned\r\nunfortunate and ill-treated nobleman. During the early part of this\r\nreign, however, he, in common with other members of the family of Pole,\r\nhad received marks of the friendship of Henry. In 1514, his mother was\r\nauthorized to assume the title of countess of Salisbury, and he that of\r\nviscount Montacute, notwithstanding the attainder formerly passed\r\nagainst the great house of Nevil, from whom these honors were derived.\r\nIn 1521 lord Montacute had been indicted for concealing the treasons,\r\nreal or pretended, of the duke of Buckingham; but immediately on his\r\nacquittal he was restored to the good graces of his sovereign, and, two\r\nyears after, attended him on an expedition to France.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that lord Montacute was popular; he was at least a\r\npartisan of the old religion, and heir to the vast possessions which his\r\nmother derived from the king-making earl of Warwick her maternal\r\ngrandfather; sufficient motives with Henry for now wishing his removal.\r\nIf the plot in which he was charged by his perfidious brother with\r\nparticipating, had in view the elevation of the cardinal to a\r\nmatrimonial crown by his union with the princess Mary, which seems to\r\nhave been insinuated, lord Montacute must at least stand acquitted of\r\nall design of asserting his own title; yet it may justly be suspected\r\nthat his character of representative of the house of Clarence, was by\r\nHenry placed foremost in the catalogue of his offences.\r\n\r\nA similar remark applies still more forcibly to the marquis of Exeter.\r\nSon of Catherine, youngest daughter of Edward IV., and so lately\r\ndeclared his heir by Henry himself, it is scarcely credible that any\r\ninducement could have drawn this nobleman into a plot for disturbing the\r\nsuccession in favour of a claim worse founded than his own; and that the\r\nblood which he inherited was the true object of Henry's apprehensions\r\nfrom him, evidently appeared to all the world by his causing the son of\r\nthe unhappy marquis, a child at this period, to be detained a state\r\nprisoner in the Tower during the remainder of his reign.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Nevil was brother to lord Abergavenny and to the wife of lord\r\nMontacute--a connection likely to bring him into suspicion, and perhaps\r\nto involve him in real guilt; but it must not be forgotten that he was a\r\nlineal descendant of the house of Lancaster by Joan daughter of John of\r\nGaunt. The only person not of royal extraction who suffered on this\r\noccasion was sir Nicholas Carew, master of the horse, and lately a\r\ndistinguished favourite of the king; of whom it is traditionally\r\nrelated, that though accused as an accomplice in the designs of the\r\nother noble delinquents, the real offence for which he died, was the\r\nhaving retorted, with more spirit than prudence, some opprobrious\r\nlanguage with which his royal master had insulted him as they were\r\nplaying at bowls together[6]. The family of Carew was however allied in\r\nblood to that of Courtney, of which the marquis of Exeter was the head.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: See Fuller's Worthies in Surry.]\r\n\r\nBut the attempt to extirpate all who under any future circumstances\r\nmight be supposed capable of advancing claims formidable to the house of\r\nTudor, must have appeared to Henry himself a task almost as hopeless as\r\ncruel. Sons and daughters of the Plantagenet princes had in every\r\ngeneration freely intermarried with the ancient nobles of the land; and\r\nas fast as those were cut off whose connection with the royal blood was\r\nnearest and most recent, the pedigrees of families pointed out others,\r\nand others still, whose relationship grew into nearness by the removal\r\nof such as had stood before them, and presented to the affrighted eyes\r\nof their persecutor, a hydra with still renewed and multiplying heads.\r\n\r\nNot content with these inflictions,--sufficiently severe it might be\r\nthought to intimidate the papal faction,--Henry gratified still further\r\nhis stern disposition by the attainder of the marchioness of Exeter and\r\nthe aged countess of Salisbury. The marchioness he soon after released;\r\nbut the countess was still detained prisoner under a sentence of death,\r\nwhich a parliament, atrocious in its subserviency, had passed upon her\r\nwithout form of trial, but which the king did not think proper at\r\npresent to carry into execution, either because he chose to keep her as\r\na kind of hostage for the good behaviour of her son the cardinal, or\r\nbecause, tyrant as he had become, he had not yet been able to divest\r\nhimself of all reverence or pity for the hoary head of a female, a\r\nkinswoman, and the last who was born to the name of Plantagenet.\r\n\r\nIt is melancholy, it is even disgusting, to dwell upon these acts of\r\nlegalized atrocity, but let it be allowed that it is important and\r\ninstructive. They form unhappily a leading feature of the administration\r\nof Henry VIII. during the latter years of his reign; they exhibit in the\r\nmost striking point of view the sentiments and practices of the age; and\r\nmay assist us to form a juster estimate of the character and conduct of\r\nElizabeth, whose infant mind was formed to the contemplation of these\r\ndomestic tragedies, and whose fame has often suffered by inconsiderate\r\ncomparisons which have placed her in parallel with the enlightened and\r\nhumanized sovereigns of more modern days, rather than with the stern and\r\narbitrary Tudors, her barbarous predecessors.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the protestant party at the court of Henry, so far\r\nfrom gaining strength and influence by the severities exercised against\r\nthe adherents of cardinal Pole and the ancient religion, was evidently\r\nin a declining state. The feeble efforts of its two leaders Cromwel and\r\nCranmer, of whom the first was deficient in zeal, the last in courage,\r\nnow experienced irresistible counteraction from the influence of\r\nGardiner, whose uncommon talents for business, joined to his extreme\r\nobsequiousness, had rendered him at once necessary and acceptable to his\r\nroyal master. The law of the Six Articles, which forbade under the\r\nhighest penalties the denial of several doctrines of the Romish church\r\npeculiarly obnoxious to the reformers, was probably drawn up by this\r\nminister. It was enacted in the parliament of 1539: a vast number of\r\npersons were soon after imprisoned for transgressing it; and Cranmer\r\nhimself was compelled, by the clause which ordained the celibacy of the\r\nclergy, to send away his wife.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Cromwel began to look on all sides for\r\nsupport; and recollecting with regret the powerful influence exerted by\r\nAnne Boleyn in favor of the good cause, and even the gentler and more\r\nprivate aid lent to it by the late queen, he planned a new marriage for\r\nhis sovereign, with a lady educated in the very bosom of the protestant\r\ncommunion. Political considerations favored the design; since a treaty\r\nlately concluded between the emperor and the king of France rendered it\r\nhighly expedient that Henry, by way of counterpoise, should strengthen\r\nhis alliance with the Smalcaldic league. In short, Cromwel prevailed.\r\nHolbein, whom the king had appointed his painter on the recommendation\r\nof sir Thomas More, and still retained in that capacity, was sent over\r\nto take the portrait of Anne sister of the duke of Cleves; and rashly\r\ntrusting in the fidelity of the likeness, Henry soon after solicited her\r\nhand in marriage.\r\n\r\n\"The lady Anne,\" says a historian, \"understood no language but Dutch, so\r\nthat all communication of speech between her and our king was\r\nintercluded. Yet our embassador, Nicholas Wotton doctor of law, employed\r\nin the business, hath it, that she could both read and write in her own\r\nlanguage, and sew very well; only for music, he said, it was not the\r\nmanner of the country to learn it[7].\" It must be confessed that for a\r\nprincess this list of accomplishments appears somewhat scanty; and\r\nHenry, unfortunately for the lady Anne, was a great admirer of learning,\r\nwit and talents, in the female sex, and a passionate lover of music,\r\nwhich he well understood. What was still worse, he piqued himself\r\nextremely on his taste in beauty, and was much more solicitous\r\nrespecting the personal charms of his consorts than is usual with\r\nsovereigns; and when, on the arrival of his destined bride in England,\r\nhe hastened to Rochester to gratify his impatience by snatching a\r\nprivate view of her, he found that in this capital article he had been\r\ngrievously imposed upon. The uncourteous comparison by which he\r\nexpressed his dislike of her large and clumsy person is well known.\r\nBitterly did he lament to Cromwel the hard fortune which had allotted\r\nhim so unlovely a partner, and he returned to London very melancholy.\r\nBut the evil appeared to be now past remedy; it was contrary to all\r\npolicy to affront the German princes by sending back their countrywoman\r\nafter matters had gone so far, and Henry magnanimously resolved to\r\nsacrifice his own feelings, once in his life, for the good of his\r\ncountry. Accordingly, he received the princess with great magnificence\r\nand with every outward demonstration of satisfaction, and was married to\r\nher at Greenwich in January 1540.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Herbert.]\r\n\r\nTwo or three months afterwards, the king, notwithstanding his secret\r\ndissatisfaction, rewarded Cromwel for his pains in concluding this union\r\nby conferring on him the vacant title of earl of Essex;--a fatal gift,\r\nwhich exasperated to rage the mingled jealousy and disdain which this\r\nlow-born and aspiring minister had already provoked from the ancient\r\nnobility, by intruding himself into the order of the garter, and which\r\nserved to heap upon his devoted head fresh coals of wrath against the\r\nday of retribution which was fast approaching. The act of transferring\r\nthis title to a new family, could in fact be no otherwise regarded by\r\nthe great house of Bourchier, which had long enjoyed it, than either as\r\na marked indignity to itself, or as a fresh result of the general Tudor\r\nsystem of depressing and discountenancing the blood of the Plantagenets,\r\nfrom which the Bourchiers, through a daughter of Thomas of Woodstock,\r\nwere descended. The late earl had left a married daughter, to whom,\r\naccording to the customary courtesy of English sovereigns in similar\r\ncircumstances, the title ought to have been continued; and as this lady\r\nhad no children, the earl of Bath, as head of the house, felt himself\r\nalso aggrieved by the alienation of family honors which he hoped to have\r\nseen continued to himself and his posterity.\r\n\r\nIn honor, probably, of the recent marriage of the king, unusually\r\nsplendid justs were opened at Westminster on May-day; in which the\r\nchallengers were headed by sir John Dudley, and the defenders by the\r\nearl of Surry. This entertainment was continued for several successive\r\ndays, during which the challengers, according to the costly fashion of\r\nancient hospitality, kept open house at their common charge, and feasted\r\nthe king and queen, the members of both houses, and the lord-mayor and\r\naldermen with their wives.\r\n\r\nBut scenes of pomp and festivity had no power to divert the thoughts of\r\nthe king from his domestic grievance,--a wife whom he regarded with\r\ndisgust: on the contrary, it is probable that this season of courtly\r\nrevelry encreased his disquiet, by giving him opportunities of beholding\r\nunder the most attractive circumstances the charms of a youthful beauty\r\nwhom he was soon seized with the most violent desire of placing beside\r\nhim on the throne which he judged her worthy to adorn.\r\n\r\nNo considerations of rectitude or of policy could longer restrain the\r\nimpetuous monarch from casting off the yoke of a detested marriage: and\r\nas a first step towards emancipation, he determined to permit the ruin\r\nof its original adviser, that unpopular minister, but vigorous and\r\nserviceable instrument of arbitrary power, whom he had hitherto defended\r\nwith pertinacity against all attacks.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the decline of his favor perceived, and what so quickly\r\nperceived at courts? than the ill-fated Cromwel found himself assailed\r\non every side. His active agency in the suppression of monasteries had\r\nbrought upon him, with the imputation of sacrilege, the hatred of all\r\nthe papists;--a certain coldness, or timidity, which he had manifested\r\nin the cause of religious reformation in other respects, and\r\nparticularly the enactment of the Six Articles during his\r\nadministration, had rendered him an object of suspicion or dislike to\r\nthe protestants;--in his new and undefined office of royal vicegerent\r\nfor the exercise of the supremacy, he had offended the whole body of the\r\nclergy;--and he had just filled up the measure of his offences against\r\nthe nobility by procuring a grant of the place of lord high-steward,\r\nlong hereditary in the great house of the Veres earls of Oxford. The\r\nonly voice raised in his favor was that of Cranmer, who interceded with\r\nHenry in his behalf in a letter eloquent, touching, and even courageous,\r\ntimes and persons considered. Gardiner and the duke of Norfolk urged on\r\nhis accusation; the parliament, with its accustomed subserviency,\r\nproceeded against him by attainder; and having voted him guilty of\r\nheresy and treason, left it in the choice of the king to bring him\r\neither to the block or the stake for whichever he pleased of these\r\noffences; neither of which was proved by evidence, or even supported by\r\nreasonable probabilities. But against this violation in his person of\r\nthe chartered rights of Englishmen, however flagrant, the unfortunate\r\nearl of Essex had forfeited all right to appeal, since it was himself\r\nwho had first advised the same arbitrary mode of proceeding in the cases\r\nof the marchioness of Exeter, of the countess of Salisbury, and of\r\nseveral persons of inferior rank connected with them; on whom capital\r\npunishment had already been inflicted.\r\n\r\nWith many private virtues, Essex, like his great master Wolsey, and like\r\nthe disgraced ministers of despotic princes in general, perished\r\nunpitied; and the king and the faction of Gardiner and of the Howards\r\nseemed equally to rejoice in the free course opened by his removal to\r\ntheir further projects. The parliament was immediately ordered to find\r\nvalid a certain frivolous pretext of a prior contract, on which its\r\nmaster was pleased to demand a divorce from Ann of Cleves; and the\r\nmarriage was unanimously declared null, without any opportunity afforded\r\nto the queen of bringing evidence in its support.\r\n\r\nThe fortitude, or rather phlegm, with which her unmerited degradation\r\nwas supported by the lady Anne, has in it something at once\r\nextraordinary and amusing. There is indeed a tradition that she fainted\r\non first receiving the information that her marriage was likely to be\r\nset aside; but the shock once over, she gave to the divorce, without\r\nhesitation or visible reluctance, that assent which was required of her.\r\nTaking in good part the pension of three thousand pounds per annum, and\r\nthe title of his _sister_ which her ex-husband was graciously pleased to\r\noffer her, she wrote to her brother the elector to entreat him still to\r\nlive in amity with the king of England, against whom she had no ground\r\nof complaint; and she continued, till the day of her death, to make his\r\ncountry her abode. Through the whole affair she gave no indication of\r\nwounded pride; unless her refusal to return in the character of a\r\ndiscarded and rejected damsel, to the home which she had so lately\r\nquitted in all the pomp and triumph of a royal bride, is to be regarded\r\nas such. But even for this part of her conduct a different motive is\r\nwith great plausibility assigned by a writer, who supposes her to have\r\nbeen swayed by the prudent consideration, that the regular payment of\r\nher pension would better be secured by her remaining under the eyes and\r\nwithin the protection of the English nation.\r\n\r\nA very few weeks after this apparently formidable business had been thus\r\nreadily and amicably arranged, Catherine Howard niece to the duke of\r\nNorfolk, and first cousin to Anne Boleyn, was declared queen. This lady,\r\nbeautiful, insinuating, and more fondly beloved by the king than any of\r\nher predecessors, was a catholic, and almost all the members of the\r\ncouncil who now possessed office or influence were attached, more or\r\nless openly, to the same communion. In consequence, the penalties of the\r\nSix Articles were enforced with great cruelty against the reformers; but\r\nthis did not exempt from punishment such as, offending on the other\r\nside, ventured to deny the royal supremacy; the only difference was,\r\nthat the former class of culprits were burned as heretics, the latter\r\nhanged as traitors.\r\n\r\nThe king soon after seized the occasion of a trifling insurrection in\r\nYorkshire, of which sir John Nevil was the leader, to complete his\r\nvengeance against cardinal Pole, by bringing to a cruel and ignominious\r\nend the days of his venerable and sorrow-stricken mother, who had been\r\nunfortunate enough thus long to survive the ruin of her family. The\r\nstrange and shocking scene exhibited on the scaffold by the desperation\r\nof this illustrious and injured lady, is detailed by all our historians:\r\nit seems almost incredible that the surrounding crowd were not urged by\r\nan unanimous impulse of horror and compassion to rush in and rescue from\r\nthe murderous hands of the executioner the last miserable representative\r\nof such a line of princes. But the eyes of Henry's subjects were\r\nhabituated to these scenes of blood; and they were viewed by some with\r\nindifference, and by the rest with emotions of terror which effectually\r\nrepressed the generous movements of a just and manly indignation.\r\n\r\nIn public causes, to be accused and to suffer death were now the same\r\nthing; and another eminent victim of the policy of the English Tiberius\r\ndisplayed in a novel and truly portentous manner his utter despair of\r\nthe justice of the country and the mercy of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nLord Leonard Grey, late deputy of Ireland, was accused of favouring the\r\nescape of that persecuted child his nephew Gerald Fitzgerald, of\r\ncorresponding with cardinal Pole, and of various other offences called\r\ntreasonable. Being brought before a jury of knights, \"he saved them,\"\r\nsays lord Herbert, \"the labour of condemning him, and without more ado\r\nconfessed all. Which, whether this lord, who was of great courage, did\r\nout of desperation or guilt, some circumstances make doubtful; and the\r\nrather, that the articles being so many, he neither denied nor\r\nextenuated any of them, though his continual fighting with the king's\r\nenemies, where occasion was, pleaded much on his part. Howsoever, he had\r\nhis head cut off[8].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Many years after, the earl of Kildare solemnly assured the\r\nauthor of the \"Chronicles of Ireland\" in Holinshed, that lord Leonard\r\nGrey had no concern whatever in his escape.]\r\n\r\nThe queen and her party were daily gaining upon the mind of the king;\r\nand Cranmer himself, notwithstanding the high esteem entertained for him\r\nby Henry, had begun to be endangered by their machinations, when an\r\nunexpected discovery put into his hands the means of baffling all their\r\ndesigns, and producing a total revolution in the face of the court.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of the year 1541 that private information was\r\nconveyed to the primate of such disorders in the conduct of the queen\r\nbefore her marriage as could not fail to plunge her in infamy and ruin.\r\nCranmer, if not exceedingly grieved, was at least greatly perplexed by\r\nthe incident:--at first sight there appeared to be equal danger in\r\nconcealing or discovering circumstances of a nature so delicate, and\r\nthe archbishop was timid by nature, and cautious from the experience of\r\na court. At length, all things well weighed, he judiciously preferred\r\nthe hazard of making the communication at once, without reserve, and\r\ndirectly, to the person most interested; and, forming into a narrative\r\nfacts which his tongue dared not utter to the face of a prince whose\r\nanger was deadly, he presented it to him and entreated him to peruse it\r\nin secret.\r\n\r\nLove and pride conspired to persuade the king that his Catherine was\r\nincapable of having imposed upon him thus grossly, and he at once\r\npronounced the whole story a malicious fabrication; but the strict\r\ninquiry which he caused to be instituted for the purpose of punishing\r\nits authors, not only established the truth of the accusations already\r\nbrought, but served also to throw the strongest suspicions on the\r\nconjugal fidelity of the queen.\r\n\r\nThe agonies of Henry on this occasion were such as in any other husband\r\nwould have merited the deepest compassion: with him they were quickly\r\nsucceeded by the most violent rage; and his cry for vengeance was, as\r\nusual, echoed with alacrity by a loyal and sympathizing parliament.\r\nParty animosity profited by the occasion and gave additional impulse to\r\ntheir proceedings. After convicting by attainder the queen and her\r\nparamours, who were soon after put to death, the two houses proceeded\r\nalso to attaint her uncle, aunt, grandmother, and about ten other\r\npersons, male and female, accused of being accessary or privy to her\r\ndisorders before marriage, and of not revealing them to the king when\r\nthey became acquainted with his intention of making her his consort; an\r\noffence declared to be misprision of treason by an ex post facto law.\r\nBut this was an excess of barbarity of which Henry himself was ashamed:\r\nthe infamous lady Rochford was the only confident who suffered\r\ncapitally; the rest were released after imprisonments of longer or\r\nshorter duration; yet a reserve of bitterness appears to have remained\r\nstored up in the heart of the king against the whole race of Howard,\r\nwhich the enemies of that illustrious house well knew how to cherish and\r\naugment against a future day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1542 TO 1547.\r\n\r\nRout of Solway and death of James V. of Scotland.--Birth of queen\r\nMary.--Henry projects to marry her to his son.--Offers the hand of\r\nElizabeth to the earl of Arran.--Earl of Lenox marries lady M.\r\nDouglas.--Marriage of the king to Catherine Parr.--Her person and\r\nacquirements.--Influence of her conduct on Elizabeth.--Henry joins the\r\nemperor against Francis I.--His campaign in France.--Princess Mary\r\nreplaced in order of succession, and Elizabeth also.--Proposals for a\r\nmarriage between Elizabeth and Philip of Spain.--The duke of Norfolk and\r\nearl of Hertford heads of the catholic and protestant parties.\r\nCircumstances which give a preponderance to the latter.--Disgrace of the\r\nduke.--Trial of the earl of Surry.--His death and character.--Sentence\r\nagainst the duke of Norfolk.--Death of Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of December 1542, shortly after the rout of Solway, in\r\nwhich the English made prisoners the flower of the Scottish nobility,\r\nthe same messenger brought to Henry VIII. the tidings that the grief and\r\nshame of this defeat had broken the heart of king James V., and that his\r\nqueen had brought into the world a daughter, who had received the name\r\nof Mary, and was now queen of Scotland. Without stopping to deplore the\r\nmelancholy fate of a nephew whom he had himself brought to destruction,\r\nHenry instantly formed the project of uniting the whole island under one\r\ncrown, by the marriage of this infant sovereign with the prince his\r\nson. All the Scottish prisoners of rank then in London were immediately\r\noffered the liberty of returning to their own country on the condition,\r\nto which they acceded with apparent alacrity, of promoting this union\r\nwith all their interest; and so confident was the English monarch in the\r\nsuccess of his measures, that previously to their departure, several of\r\nthem were carried to the palace of Enfield, where young Edward then\r\nresided, that they might tender homage to the future husband of their\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nThe regency of Scotland at this critical juncture was claimed by the\r\nearl of Arran, who was generally regarded as next heir to the crown,\r\nthough his legitimacy had been disputed; and to this nobleman,--but\r\nwhether for himself or his son seems doubtful,--Henry, as a further\r\nmeans of securing the important object which he had at heart, offered\r\nthe hand of his daughter Elizabeth. So early were the concerns and\r\ninterests blended, of two princesses whose celebrated rivalry was\r\ndestined to endure until the life of one of them had become its\r\nsacrifice! So remarkably, too, in this first transaction was contrasted\r\nthe high preeminence from which the Scottish princess was destined to\r\nhurl herself by her own misconduct, with the abasement and comparative\r\ninsignificance out of which her genius and her good fortune were to be\r\nemployed in elevating the future sovereign of England.\r\n\r\nBorn in the purple of her hereditary kingdom, the monarchs of France and\r\nEngland made it an object of eager contention which of them should\r\nsucceed in encircling with a second diadem the baby brows of Mary;\r\nwhile the hand of Elizabeth was tossed as a trivial boon to a Scottish\r\nearl of equivocal birth, despicable abilities, and feeble character. So\r\nlittle too was even this person flattered by the honor, or aware of the\r\nadvantages, of such a connection, that he soon after renounced it by\r\nquitting the English for the French party. Elizabeth in consequence\r\nremained unbetrothed, and her father soon afterwards secured to himself\r\na more strenuous ally in the earl of Lenox, also of the blood-royal of\r\nScotland, by bestowing upon this nobleman the hand, not of his daughter,\r\nbut of his niece the lady Margaret Douglas.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by his late severe disappointment Henry was bent on entering\r\nonce more into the marriage state, and his choice now fell on Catherine\r\nParr, sprung from a knightly family possessed of large estates in\r\nWestmoreland, and widow of lord Latimer, a member of the great house of\r\nNevil.\r\n\r\nA portrait of this lady still in existence, exhibits, with fine and\r\nregular features, a character of intelligence and arch simplicity\r\nextremely captivating. She was indeed a woman of uncommon talent and\r\naddress; and her mental accomplishments, besides the honor which they\r\nreflect on herself, inspire us with respect for the enlightened\r\nliberality of an age in which such acquirements could be placed within\r\nthe ambition and attainment of a private gentlewoman, born in a remote\r\ncounty, remarkable even in much later times for a primitive simplicity\r\nof manners and domestic habits. Catherine was both learned herself, and,\r\nafter her elevation a zealous patroness of learning and of\r\nprotestantism, to which she was become a convert. Nicholas Udal master\r\nof Eton was employed by her to translate Erasmus's paraphrase of the\r\nfour gospels; and there is extant a Latin letter of hers to the princess\r\nMary, whose conversion from popery she seems to have had much at heart,\r\nin which she entreats her to permit this work to appear under her\r\nauspices. She also printed some prayers and meditations, and there was\r\nfound among her papers, after her death, a piece entitled \"The\r\nlamentations of a sinner bewailing her blind life,\" in which she\r\ndeplores the years that she had passed in popish observances, and which\r\nwas afterwards published by secretary Cecil.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking proof of the address of this queen, that she\r\nconciliated the affection of all the three children of the king, letters\r\nfrom each of whom have been preserved addressed to her after the death\r\nof their father.\r\n\r\nElizabeth in particular maintained with her a very intimate and frequent\r\nintercourse; which ended however in a manner reflecting little credit on\r\neither party, as will be more fully explained in its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe adroitness with which Catherine extricated herself from the snare in\r\nwhich her own religious zeal, the moroseness of the king, and the enmity\r\nof Gardiner had conspired to entangle her, has often been celebrated.\r\nMay it not be conjectured, that such an example, given by one of whom\r\nshe entertained a high opinion, might exert no inconsiderable influence\r\non the opening mind of Elizabeth, whose conduct in the many similar\r\ndilemmas to which it was her lot to be reduced, partook so much of the\r\nsame character of politic and cautious equivocation?\r\n\r\nHenry discovered by experiment that it would prove a much more difficult\r\nmatter than he had apprehended to accomplish, either by force or\r\npersuasion, the marriage of young Edward with the queen of Scots; and\r\nlearning that it was principally to the intrigues of Francis I., against\r\nwhom he had other causes also of complaint, that he was likely to owe\r\nthe disappointment of this favourite scheme, he determined on revenge.\r\nWith this design he turned his eyes on the emperor; and finding Charles\r\nperfectly well disposed to forget all ancient animosities in sympathy\r\nwith his newly-conceived indignation against the French king, he entered\r\nwith him into a strict alliance. War was soon declared against France by\r\nthe new confederates; and after a campaign in which little was effected,\r\nit was agreed that Charles and Henry, uniting their efforts, should\r\nassail that kingdom with a force which it was judged incapable of\r\nresisting, and without stopping at inferior objects, march straight to\r\nParis. Accordingly, in July 1544, preceded by a fine army, and attended\r\nby the flower of his nobility splendidly equipped, Henry took his\r\ndeparture for Calais in a ship the sails of which were made of cloth of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in safety, and enjoyed the satisfaction of dazzling with his\r\nmagnificence the count de Buren whom the emperor sent with a body of\r\nhorse to meet him; quarrelled soon after with that potentate, who found\r\nit his interest to make a separate peace; took the towns of Montreuil\r\nand Boulogne, neither of them of any value to him, and returned.\r\n\r\nSo foolish and expensive a sally of passion, however characteristic of\r\nthe disposition of this monarch, would not merit commemoration in this\r\nplace, but for the important influence which it unexpectedly exerted on\r\nthe fortune and expectations of Elizabeth through the following train of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, whose long enmity with Henry had taken its rise from what\r\nhe justly regarded as the injuries of Catherine of Arragon his aunt, in\r\nwhose person the whole royal family of Spain had been insulted, had\r\nrequired of him as a preliminary to their treaty a formal\r\nacknowledgement of the legitimacy of his daughter Mary. This Henry could\r\nnot, with any regard to consistency, grant; but desirous to accede as\r\nfar as he conveniently could to the wishes of his new ally, he consented\r\nto stipulate, that without any explanation on this point, his eldest\r\ndaughter should by act of parliament be reinstated in the order of\r\nsuccession. At the same time, glad to relent in behalf of his favorite\r\nchild, and unwilling perhaps to give the catholic party the triumph of\r\nasserting that he had virtually declared his first marriage more lawful\r\nthan his second, he caused a similar privilege to be extended to\r\nElizabeth, who was thus happily restored to her original station and\r\nprospects, before she had attained sufficient maturity of age to suffer\r\nby the cruel and mortifying degradation to which she had been for\r\nseveral years subjected.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, though the act which declared null the marriage of the king\r\nwith Anne Boleyn remained for ever unrepealed, her daughter appears to\r\nhave been universally recognised on the footing of a princess of\r\nEngland; and so completely were the old disputes concerning the divorce\r\nof Catherine consigned to oblivion, that in 1546, when France, Spain and\r\nEngland had concluded a treaty of peace, proposals passed between the\r\ncourts of London and Madrid for the marriage of Elizabeth with Philip\r\nprince of Spain; that very Philip afterwards her brother-in-law and in\r\nadversity her friend and protector, then a second time her suitor, and\r\nafterwards again to the end of his days the most formidable and\r\nimplacable of her enemies. On which side, or on what assigned\r\nobjections, this treaty of marriage was relinquished, we do not learn;\r\nbut as the demonstrations of friendship between Charles and Henry after\r\ntheir French campaign were full of insincerity, it may perhaps be\r\ndoubted whether either party was ever bent in earnest on the completion\r\nof this extraordinary union.\r\n\r\nThe popish and protestant factions which now divided the English court,\r\nhad for several years acknowledged as their respective leaders the duke\r\nof Norfolk and the earl of Hertford. To the latter of these, the painful\r\nimpression left on Henry's mind by the excesses of Catherine Howard, the\r\nreligious sentiments embraced by the present queen, the king's\r\nincreasing jealousy of the ancient nobility of the country, and above\r\nall the visible decline of his health, which brought into immediate\r\nprospect the accession of young Edward under the tutelage of his uncle,\r\nhad now conspired to give a decided preponderancy. The aged duke,\r\nsagacious, politic, and deeply versed in all the secrets and the arts of\r\ncourts, saw in a coalition with the Seymours the only expedient for\r\naverting the ruin of his house; and he proposed to bestow his daughter\r\nthe duchess of Richmond in marriage on sir Thomas Seymour, while he\r\nexerted all his authority with his son to prevail upon him to address\r\none of the daughters of the earl of Hertford. But Surry's scorn of the\r\nnew nobility of the house of Seymour, and his animosity against the\r\nperson of its chief, was not to be overcome by any plea of expedience or\r\nthreatening of danger. He could not forget that it was at the instance\r\nof the earl of Hertford that he, with some other nobles and gentlemen,\r\nhad suffered the disgrace of imprisonment for eating flesh in Lent; that\r\nwhen a trifling defeat which he had sustained near Boulogne had caused\r\nhim to be removed from the government of that town, it was the earl of\r\nHertford who ultimately profited by his misfortune, in succeeding to the\r\ncommand of the army. Other grounds of offence the haughty Surry had also\r\nconceived against him; and choosing rather to fall, than cling for\r\nsupport to an enemy at once despised and hated, he braved the utmost\r\ndispleasure of his father, by an absolute refusal to lend himself to\r\nsuch a scheme of alliance. Of this circumstance his enemies availed\r\nthemselves to instil into the mind of the king a suspicion that the earl\r\nof Surry aspired to the hand of the princess Mary; they also commented\r\nwith industrious malice on his bearing the arms of Edward the\r\nConfessor, to which he was clearly entitled in right of his mother, a\r\ndaughter of the duke of Buckingham, but which his more cautious father\r\nhad ceased to quarter after the attainder of that unfortunate nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe sick mind of Henry received with eagerness all these suggestions,\r\nand the ruin of the earl was determined[9]. An indictment of high\r\ntreason was preferred against him: his proposal of disproving the\r\ncharge, according to a mode then legal, by fighting his principal\r\naccuser in his shirt, was overruled; his spirited, strong and eloquent\r\ndefence was disregarded--a jury devoted to the crown brought in a\r\nverdict of guilty; and in January 1547, at the early age of\r\nseven-and-twenty, he underwent the fatal sentence of the law.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: One extraordinary, and indeed unaccountable, circumstance\r\nin the life of the earl of Surry may here be noticed:--that while his\r\nfather urged him to connect himself in marriage with one lady, while the\r\nking was jealous of his designs upon a second, and while he himself, as\r\nmay be collected from his poem \"To a lady who refused to dance with\r\nhim,\" made proposals of marriage to a third, he had a wife living. To\r\nthis lady, who was a sister of the earl of Oxford, he was united at the\r\nage of fifteen, she had borne him five children; and it is pretty plain\r\nthat they were never divorced, for we find her, several years after his\r\ndeath, still bearing the title of countess of Surry, and the guardian of\r\nhis orphans. Had the example of Henry instructed his courtiers to find\r\npretexts for the dissolution of the matrimonial tie whenever interest or\r\ninclination might prompt, and did our courts of law lend themselves to\r\nthis abuse? A preacher of Edward the sixth's time brings such an\r\naccusation against the morals of the age, but I find no particular\r\nexamples of it in the histories of noble families.]\r\n\r\nNo one during the whole sanguinary tyranny of Henry VIII. fell more\r\nguiltless, or more generally deplored by all whom personal animosity or\r\nthe spirit of party had not hardened against sentiments of compassion,\r\nor blinded to the perception of merit. But much of Surry has survived\r\nthe cruelty of his fate. His beautiful songs and sonnets, which served\r\nas a model to the most popular poets of the age of Elizabeth, still\r\nexcite the admiration of every student attached to the early literature\r\nof our country. Amongst other frivolous charges brought against him on\r\nhis trial, it was mentioned that he kept an Italian jester, thought to\r\nbe a spy, and that he loved to converse with foreigners and conform his\r\nbehaviour to them. For his personal safety, therefore, it was perhaps\r\nunfortunate that a portion of his youth had been passed in a visit to\r\nItaly, then the focus of literature and fount of inspiration; but for\r\nhis surviving fame, and for the progress of English poetry, the\r\ncircumstance was eminently propitious; since it is from the return of\r\nthis noble traveller that we are to date not only the introduction into\r\nour language of the Petrarchan sonnet, and with it of a tenderness and\r\nrefinement of sentiment unknown to the barbarism of our preceding\r\nversifiers; but what is much more, that of heroic blank verse; a noble\r\nmeasure, of which the earliest example exists in Surry's spirited and\r\nfaithful version of one book of the AEneid.\r\n\r\nThe exalted rank, the splendid talents, the lofty spirit of this\r\nlamented nobleman seemed to destine him to a station second to none\r\namong the public characters of his time; and if, instead of being cut\r\noff by the hand of violence in the morning of life, he had been\r\npermitted to attain a length of days at all approaching to the\r\nfourscore years of his father, it is probable that the votary of letters\r\nwould have been lost to us in the statesman or the soldier. Queen Mary,\r\nwho sought by her favor and confidence to revive the almost extinguished\r\nenergies of his father, and called forth into premature distinction the\r\naspiring boyhood of his son, would have intrusted to his vigorous years\r\nthe highest offices and most weighty affairs of state. Perhaps even the\r\nsuspicions of her father might have been verified by the event, and her\r\nown royal hand might itself have become the reward of his virtues and\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, whose maternal ancestry closely connected her with the house\r\nof Howard, might have sought and found, in her kinsman the earl of\r\nSurry, a counsellor and friend deserving of all her confidence and\r\nesteem; and it is possible that he, with safety and effect, might have\r\nplaced himself as a mediator between the queen and that formidable\r\ncatholic party of which his misguided son, fatally for himself, aspired\r\nto be regarded as the leader, and was in fact only the instrument. But\r\nthe career of ambition, ere he had well entered it, was closed upon him\r\nfor ever; and it is as an accomplished knight, a polished lover, and\r\nabove all as a poet, that the name of Surry now lives in the annals of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nOf the five children who survived to feel the want of his paternal\r\nguidance, one daughter, married to the earl of Westmorland, was\r\nhonorably distinguished by talents, erudition, and the patronage of\r\nletters; but of the two sons, the elder was that unfortunate duke of\r\nNorfolk who paid on the scaffold the forfeit of an inconsiderate and\r\nguilty enterprise; and the younger, created earl of Northampton by James\r\nI., lived to disgrace his birth and fine talents by every kind of\r\nbaseness, and died just in time to escape punishment as an accomplice in\r\nOverbury's murder.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Norfolk had been declared guilty of high treason on grounds\r\nequally frivolous with his son; but the opportune death of Henry VIII.\r\non the day that his cruel and unmerited sentence was to have been\r\ncarried into execution, saved his life, when his humble submissions and\r\npathetic supplications for mercy had failed to touch the callous heart\r\nof the expiring despot. The jealousies however, religious and political,\r\nof the council of regency, on which the administration devolved,\r\nprompted them to refuse liberty to the illustrious prisoner after their\r\nweakness or their clemency had granted him his life. During the whole\r\nreign of Edward VI. the duke was detained under close custody in the\r\nTower; his estates were confiscated, his blood attainted, and for this\r\nperiod the great name of Howard disappears from the page of English\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1547 TO 1549.\r\n\r\nTestamentary provisions of Henry VIII.--Exclusion of the Scottish\r\nline.--Discontent of the earl of Arundel.--His character and\r\nintrigues.--Hertford declared protector--becomes duke of\r\nSomerset.--Other titles conferred.--Thomas Seymour made\r\nlord-admiral--marries the queen dowager.--His discontent and\r\nintrigues.--His behaviour to Elizabeth.--Death of the queen.--Seymour\r\naspires to the hand of Elizabeth--conspires against his brother--is\r\nattainted--put to death.--Particulars of his intercourse with\r\nElizabeth.--Examinations which she underwent on this subject.--Traits of\r\nher early character.--Verses on admiral Seymour.--The learning of\r\nElizabeth.--Extracts from Ascham's Letters respecting her, Jane Grey,\r\nand other learned ladies.--Two of her letters to Edward VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry VIII., which took place on January 28th 1547, opened\r\na new and busy scene, and affected in several important points the\r\nsituation of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe testament by which the parliament had empowered the king to regulate\r\nthe government of the country during his son's minority, and even to\r\nsettle the order of succession itself, with as full authority as the\r\ndistribution of his private property, was the first object of attention;\r\nand its provisions were found strongly characteristic of the temper and\r\nmaxims of its author. He confirmed the act of parliament by which his\r\ntwo daughters had been rendered capable of inheriting the crown, and\r\nappointed to each of them a pension of three thousand pounds, with a\r\nmarriage-portion of ten thousand pounds, but annexed the condition of\r\ntheir marrying with the consent of such of his executors as should be\r\nliving. After them, he placed in order of succession Frances marchioness\r\nof Dorset, and Eleanor countess of Cumberland, daughters of his younger\r\nsister the queen-dowager of France by Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk;\r\nand failing the descendants of these ladies he bequeathed the crown to\r\nthe next heir. By this disposition he either totally excluded, or at\r\nleast removed from their rightful place, his eldest and still surviving\r\nsister the queen-dowager of Scotland, and all her issue;--a most absurd\r\nand dangerous indulgence of his feelings of enmity against the Scottish\r\nline, which might eventually have involved the nation in all the horrors\r\nof a civil war, and from which in fact the whole calamitous destinies of\r\nthe house of Suffolk, which the progress of this work will record, and\r\nin some measure also the long misfortunes of the queen of Scots herself,\r\nwill be found to draw their origin. Sixteen executors named in the will\r\nwere to exercise in common the royal functions till young Edward should\r\nattain the age of eighteen; and to these, twelve others were added as a\r\ncouncil of regency, invested however with no other privilege than that\r\nof giving their opinions when called upon. The selection of the\r\nexecutors and counsellors was in perfect unison with the policy of the\r\nTudors. The great officers of state formed of necessity a considerable\r\nportion of the former body, and four of these, lord Wriothesley the\r\nchancellor, the earl of Hertford lord-chamberlain, lord St. John master\r\nof the household, and lord Russel privy-seal, were decorated with the\r\npeerage; but with the exception of sir John Dudley, who had lately\r\nacquired by marriage the rank of viscount Lisle, these were the only\r\ntitled men of the sixteen. Thus it appeared, that not a single\r\nindividual amongst the hereditary nobility of the country enjoyed in a\r\nsufficient degree the favor and confidence of the monarch, to be\r\nassociated in a charge which he had not hesitated to confer on persons\r\nof no higher importance than the principal gentlemen of the bed-chamber,\r\nthe treasurer of Calais, and the dean of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nEven the council reckoned among its members only two peers: one of them\r\nthe brother of the queen-dowager, on whom, since the fall of Cromwel,\r\nthe title of earl of Essex had at length been conferred in right of his\r\nwife, the heiress of the Bourchiers: the other, the earl of Arundel,\r\npremier earl of England and last of the ancient name of Fitzalan; a\r\ndistinguished nobleman, whom vast wealth, elegant tastes acquired in\r\nforeign travel, and a spirit of magnificence, combined to render one of\r\nthe principal ornaments of the court, while his political talents and\r\nexperience of affairs qualified him to assume a leading station in the\r\ncabinet. The loyalty and prudence of the Fitzalans must have been\r\nconspicuous for ages, since no attainder, during so long a period of\r\ngreatness, had stained the honor of the race; and the moderation or\r\nsubserviency of the present earl had been shown by his perfect\r\nacquiescence in all the measures of Henry, notwithstanding his private\r\npreference of the ancient faith: to crown his merits, his blood appears\r\nto have been unmingled with that of the Plantagenets. Notwithstanding\r\nall this, the king had thought fit to name him only a counsellor, not an\r\nexecutor. Arundel deeply felt the injury; and impatience of the\r\ninsignificance to which he was thus consigned, joined to his\r\ndisapprobation of the measures of the regency with respect to religion,\r\nthrew him into intrigues which contributed not a little to the\r\nturbulence of this disastrous period.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless the intention of Henry, that the religion of the\r\ncountry, at least during the minority of his son, should be left\r\nvibrating on the same nice balance between protestantism and popery on\r\nwhich it had cost him so much pains to fix it; and with a view to this\r\nobject he had originally composed the regency with a pretty equal\r\ndistribution of power between the adherents of the two communions. But\r\nthe suspicion, or disgust, which afterwards caused him to erase the name\r\nof Gardiner from the list, destroyed the equipoise, and rendered the\r\nscale of reformation decidedly preponderant. In vain did Wriothesley, a\r\nman of vigorous talents and aspiring mind, struggle with Hertford for\r\nthe highest place in the administration; in vain did Tunstal bishop of\r\nDurham,--no bigot, but a firm papist,--check with all the authority that\r\nhe could venture to exert, the bold career of innovation on which he\r\nbeheld Cranmer full of eagerness to enter; in vain did the catholics\r\ninvoke to their aid the active interference of Dudley; he suffered them\r\nto imagine that his heart was with them, and that he watched an\r\nopportunity to interpose with effect in their behalf, whilst, in fact,\r\nhe was only waiting till the fall of one of the Seymours by the hand of\r\nthe other should enable him to crush the survivor, and rise to\r\nuncontrolled authority on the ruins of both.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of the protestant party in the regency showed their\r\nintentions; its success proved their strength, and silenced for the\r\npresent all opposition. It was proposed, and carried by a majority of\r\nthe executors, that the earl of Hertford should be declared protector of\r\nthe realm, and governor of the king's person; and the new dictator soon\r\nafter procured the ratification of this appointment, which overturned\r\nsome of the most important clauses of the late king's will, by causing a\r\npatent to be drawn and sanctioned by the two houses which invested him,\r\nduring the minority, with all the prerogatives ever assumed by the most\r\narbitrary of the English sovereigns, and many more than were ever\r\nrecognised by the constitution.\r\n\r\nAs if in compensation for any disrespect shown to the memory of the\r\ndeceased monarch by these proceedings, the executors next declared their\r\nintention of fulfilling certain promises made by him in his last\r\nillness, and which death alone had prevented him from carrying into\r\neffect. On this plea, they bestowed upon themselves and their adherents\r\nvarious titles of honor, and a number of valuable church preferments,\r\nnow first conferred upon laymen, the protector himself unblushingly\r\nassuming the title of duke of Somerset, and taking possession of\r\nbenefices and impropriations to a vast amount. Viscount Lisle was\r\ncreated earl of Warwick, and Wriothesley became earl of Southampton;--an\r\nempty dignity, which afforded him little consolation for seeing himself\r\nsoon after, on pretence of some irregular proceedings in his office,\r\nstripped of the post of chancellor, deprived of his place amongst the\r\nother executors of the king, who now formed a privy council to the\r\nprotector, and consigned to obscurity and insignificance for the short\r\nremnant of his days. Sir Thomas Seymour ought to have been consoled by\r\nthe share allotted him in this splendid distribution, for the\r\nmortification of having been named a counsellor only, and not an\r\nexecutor. He was made lord Seymour of Sudley, and soon after, lord\r\nhigh-admiral--preferments greatly exceeding any expectations which his\r\nbirth or his services to the state could properly authorize. But he\r\nmeasured his claims by his nearness to the king; he compared these\r\ninferior dignities with the state and power usurped by his brother, and\r\nhis arrogant spirit disdained as a meanness the thought of resting\r\nsatisfied or appeased. Circumstances soon arose which converted this\r\ngeneral feeling of discontent in the mind of Thomas Seymour into a more\r\nrancorous spirit of envy and hostility against his brother, and\r\ngradually involved him in a succession of dark intrigues, which, on\r\naccount of the embarrassments and dangers in which they eventually\r\nimplicated the princess Elizabeth, it will now become necessary to\r\nunravel. The younger Seymour, still in the prime of life, was endowed in\r\na striking degree with those graces of person and manner which serve to\r\ncaptivate the female heart, and his ambition had sought in consequence\r\nto avail itself of a splendid marriage.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the princess Mary herself was at first the object of his\r\nhopes or wishes: but if this were really the case, she must speedily\r\nhave quelled his presumption by the lofty sternness of her repulse; for\r\nit is impossible to discover in the history of his life at what\r\nparticular period he could have been occupied with such a design.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the death of Henry, he found means to revive with such\r\nenergy in the bosom of the queen-dowager, an attachment which she had\r\nentertained for him before her marriage with the king, that she\r\nconsented to become his wife with a precipitation highly indecorous and\r\nreprehensible. The connexion proved unfortunate on both sides, and its\r\nfirst effect was to embroil him with his brother.\r\n\r\nThe protector, of a temper still weaker than his not very vigorous\r\nunderstanding, had long allowed himself to be governed both in great and\r\nsmall concerns by his wife, a woman of little principle and of a\r\ndisposition in the highest degree violent, imperious, and insolent.\r\nNothing could be more insupportable to the spirit of this lady, who\r\nprided herself on her descent from Thomas of Woodstock, and now saw her\r\nhusband governing the kingdom with all the prerogatives and almost all\r\nthe splendor of royalty, than to find herself compelled to yield\r\nprecedency to the wife of his younger brother; and unable to submit\r\npatiently to a mortification from which, after all, there was no escape,\r\nshe could not forbear engaging in continual disputes on the subject\r\nwith the queen-dowager. Their husbands soon were drawn in to take part\r\nin this senseless quarrel, and a serious difference ensued between them.\r\nThe protector and council soon after refused to the lord-admiral certain\r\ngrants of land and valuable jewels which he claimed as bequests to his\r\nwife from the late king, and the, perhaps, real injury, thus added to\r\nthe slights of which he before complained, gave fresh exasperation to\r\nthe pride and turbulence of his character.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the protector's absence on that campaign in Scotland\r\nwhich ended with the victory of Pinkey, he formed partisans among the\r\ndiscontented nobles, won from his brother the affections of the young\r\nking, and believing every thing ripe for an attack on his usurped\r\nauthority, he designed to bring forward in the ensuing parliament a\r\nproposal for separating, according to ancient precedent, the office of\r\nguardian of the king's person from that of protector of the realm, and\r\nfor conferring upon himself the former. But he discovered too late that\r\nhe had greatly miscalculated his forces; his proposal was not even\r\npermitted to come to a hearing. Having rendered himself further\r\nobnoxious to the vengeance of the administration by menaces thrown out\r\nin the rage of disappointment, he saw himself reduced, in order to\r\nescape a committal to the Tower, to make submissions to his brother. An\r\napparent reconciliation took place; and the admiral was compelled to\r\nchange, but not to relinquish, his schemes of ambition.\r\n\r\nThe princess Elizabeth had been consigned on the death of her father to\r\nthe protection and superintendance of the queen-dowager, with whom, at\r\none or other of her jointure-houses of Chelsea or Hanworth, she usually\r\nmade her abode. By this means it happened, that after the queen's\r\nremarriage she found herself domesticated under the roof of the\r\nlord-admiral; and in this situation she had soon the misfortune to\r\nbecome an object of his marked attention.\r\n\r\nWhat were, at this particular period, Seymour's designs upon the\r\nprincess, is uncertain; but it afterwards appeared from the testimony of\r\neye-witnesses, that neither respect for her exalted rank, nor a sense of\r\nthe high responsibility attached to the character of a guardian, with\r\nwhich circumstances invested him, had proved sufficient to restrain him\r\nfrom freedoms of behaviour towards her, which no reasonable allowance\r\nfor the comparative grossness of the age can reduce within the limits of\r\npropriety or decorum. We learn that, on some occasions at least, she\r\nendeavoured to repel his presumption by such expedients as her youthful\r\ninexperience suggested; but her governess and attendants, gained over or\r\nintimidated, were guilty of a treacherous or cowardly neglect of duty,\r\nand the queen herself appears to have been very deficient in delicacy\r\nand caution till circumstances arose which suddenly excited her\r\njealousy[10]. A violent scene then took place between the royal\r\nstep-mother and step-daughter, which ended, fortunately for the peace\r\nand honor of Elizabeth, in an immediate and final separation.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: It seems that on one occasion the queen held the hands of\r\nthe princess while the lord-admiral amused himself with cutting her gown\r\nto shreds; and that, on another, she introduced him into the chamber of\r\nElizabeth before she had left her bed, when a violent romping scene took\r\nplace, which was afterwards repeated without the presence of the queen.\r\n\r\nCatherine was so unguarded in her own conduct, that the lord-admiral\r\nprofessed himself jealous of the servant who carried up coals to her\r\napartment.]\r\n\r\nThere is no ground whatever to credit the popular rumor that the queen,\r\nwho died in childbed soon after this affair, was poisoned by the\r\nadmiral; but there is sufficient proof that he was a harsh and jealous\r\nhusband; and he did not probably at this juncture regard as unpropitious\r\non the whole, an event which enabled him to aspire to the hand of\r\nElizabeth, though other and more intricate designs were at the same time\r\nhatching in his busy brain, to which his state of a widower seemed at\r\nfirst to oppose some serious obstacles.\r\n\r\nLady Jane Grey, eldest daughter of the marchioness of Dorset, who had\r\nbeen placed immediately after the two princesses in order of succession,\r\nhad also resided in the house of the lord-admiral during the lifetime of\r\nthe queen-dowager, and he was anxious still to retain in his hands a\r\npledge of such importance. To the applications of the marquis and\r\nmarchioness for her return, he pleaded that the young lady would be as\r\nsecure under the superintendance of his mother, whom he had invited to\r\nreside in his house, as formerly under that of the queen, and that a\r\nmark of the esteem of friends whom he so highly valued, would in this\r\nseason of his affliction be doubly precious to him. He caused a secret\r\nagent to insinuate to the weak marquis, that if the lady Jane remained\r\nunder his roof, it might eventually be in his power to marry her to the\r\nyoung king; and finally, as the most satisfactory proof of the sincerity\r\nof his professions of regard, he advanced to this illustrious peer the\r\nsum of five hundred pounds in ready money, requiring no other security\r\nfor its repayment than the person of his fair guest, or hostage. Such\r\neloquence proved irresistible: lady Jane was suffered to remain under\r\nthis very singular and improper protection, and report for some time\r\nvibrated between the sister and the cousin of the king as the real\r\nobject of the admiral's matrimonial projects. But in his own mind there\r\nappears to have been no hesitation between them. The residence of lady\r\nJane in his house was no otherwise of importance to him, than as it\r\ncontributed to insure to him the support of her father, and as it\r\nenabled him to counteract a favorite scheme of the protector's, or\r\nrather of his duchess's, for marrying her to their eldest son. With\r\nElizabeth, on the contrary, he certainly aimed at the closest of all\r\nconnexions, and he was intent on improving by every means the impression\r\nwhich his dangerous powers of insinuation had already made on her\r\ninexperienced heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashley, her governess, he had long since secured in his interests;\r\nhis next step was to gain one Parry, her cofferer, and through these\r\nagents he proposed to open a direct correspondence with herself. His\r\ndesigns prospered for some time according to his desires; and though it\r\nseems never to have been exactly known, except to the parties\r\nthemselves, what degree of secret intelligence Elizabeth maintained with\r\nher suitor; it cannot be doubted that she betrayed towards him\r\nsentiments sufficiently favorable to render the difficulty of obtaining\r\nthat consent of the royal executors which the law required, the\r\nprincipal obstacle, in his own opinion, to the accomplishment of his\r\nwishes. It was one, however, which appeared absolutely insuperable so\r\nlong as his brother continued to preside over the administration with\r\nauthority not to be resisted; and despair of gaining his object by fair\r\nand peaceful means, soon suggested to the admiral further measures of a\r\ndark and dangerous character.\r\n\r\nBy the whole order of nobility the protector, who affected the love of\r\nthe commons, was envied and hated; but his brother, on the contrary, had\r\ncultivated their friendship with assiduity and success; and he now took\r\nopportunities of emphatically recommending it to his principal\r\nadherents, the marquis of Northampton (late earl of Essex), the marquis\r\nof Dorset, the earl of Rutland, and others, to go into their counties\r\nand \"make all the strength\" there which they could. He boasted of the\r\ncommand of men which he derived from his office of high-admiral;\r\nprovided a large quantity of arms for his followers; and gained over the\r\nmaster of Bristol mint to take measures for supplying him, on any sudden\r\nemergency, with a large sum of money. He likewise opened a secret\r\ncorrespondence with the young king, and endeavoured by many accusations,\r\ntrue or false, to render odious the government of his brother. But\r\nhappily those turbulent dispositions and inordinate desires which\r\nprompt men to form plots dangerous to the peace and welfare of a\r\ncommunity, are rarely found to co-exist with the sagacity and prudence\r\nnecessary to conduct them to a successful issue; and to this remark the\r\nadmiral was not destined to afford an exception. Though he ought to have\r\nbeen perfectly aware that his late attempt had rendered him an object of\r\nthe strongest suspicion to his brother, and that he was surrounded by\r\nhis spies, such was the violence and presumption of his temper, that he\r\ncould not restrain himself from throwing out vaunts and menaces which\r\nserved to put his enemies on the track of the most important\r\ndiscoveries; and in the midst of vain schemes and flattering\r\nanticipations, he was surprised on the sudden by a warrant for his\r\ncommittal to the Tower. His principal agents were also seized, and\r\ncompelled to give evidence before the council. Still the protector\r\nseemed reluctant to proceed to extremities against his brother; but his\r\nown impetuous temper and the ill offices of the earl of Warwick\r\nconspired to urge on his fate.\r\n\r\nFar from submitting himself as before to the indulgence of the\r\nprotector, and seeking to disarm his indignation by promises and\r\nentreaties, Seymour now stood, as it were, at bay, and boldly demanded a\r\nfair and equal trial,--the birthright of Englishmen. But this was a boon\r\nwhich it was esteemed on several accounts inexpedient, if not dangerous,\r\nto grant. No overt act of treason could be proved against him:\r\ncircumstances might come out which would compromise the young king\r\nhimself, whom a strong dislike of the restraint in which he was held by\r\nhis elder uncle had thrown pretty decidedly into the party of the\r\nyounger. The name of the lady Elizabeth was implicated in the\r\ntransaction further than it was delicate to declare. An acquittal, which\r\nthe far-extended influence of the lord-admiral over all classes of men\r\nrendered by no means impossible, would probably be the ruin of the\r\nprotector;--and in the end it was decided to proceed against him by the\r\narbitrary and odious method of attainder.\r\n\r\nSeveral of those peers, on whose support he had placed the firmest\r\nreliance, rose voluntarily in their places, and betrayed the designs\r\nwhich he had confided to them. The depositions before the council were\r\ndeclared sufficient ground for his condemnation; and in spite of the\r\nopposition of some spirited and upright members of the house of commons,\r\na sentence was pronounced, in obedience to which, in March 1549, he was\r\nconducted to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe timely removal of this bad and dangerous man, however illegal and\r\nunwarrantable the means by which it was accomplished, deserves to be\r\nregarded as the first of those signal escapes with which the life of\r\nElizabeth so remarkably abounds. Her attachment for Seymour, certainly\r\nthe earliest, was perhaps also the strongest, impression of the tender\r\nkind which her heart was destined to receive; and though there may be a\r\nprobability that in this, as in subsequent instances, where her\r\ninclinations seemed most to favor the wishes of her suitors, her\r\ncharacteristic caution would have interfered to withhold her from an\r\nirrevocable engagement, it might not much longer have been in her power\r\nto recede with honor, or even, if the designs of Seymour had prospered,\r\nwith safety.\r\n\r\nThe original pieces relative to this affair have fortunately been\r\npreserved, and furnish some very remarkable traits of the early\r\ncharacter of Elizabeth, and of the behaviour of those about her.\r\n\r\nThe confessions of Mrs. Ashley and of Parry before the privy-council,\r\ncontain all that is known of the conduct of the admiral towards their\r\nlady during the lifetime of the queen. They seem to cast upon Mrs.\r\nAshley the double imputation of having suffered such behaviour to pass\r\nbefore her eyes as she ought not to have endured for a moment, and of\r\nhaving needlessly disclosed to Parry particulars respecting it which\r\nreflected the utmost disgrace both on herself, the admiral, and her\r\npupil. Yet we know that Elizabeth, so far from resenting any thing that\r\nMrs. Ashley had either done or confessed, continued to love and favor\r\nher in the highest degree, and after her accession promoted her husband\r\nto a considerable office:--a circumstance which affords ground for\r\nsuspicion that some important secrets were in her possession respecting\r\nlater transactions between the princess and Seymour which she had\r\nfaithfully kept. It should also be observed in palliation of the\r\nliberties which she accused the admiral of allowing to himself, and the\r\nprincess of enduring, that the period of Elizabeth's life to which these\r\nparticulars relate was only her fourteenth year.\r\n\r\nWe are told that she refused permission to the admiral to visit her\r\nafter he became a widower, on account of the general report that she was\r\nlikely to become his wife; and not the slightest trace was at this time\r\nfound of any correspondence between them, though Harrington afterwards\r\nunderwent an imprisonment for having delivered to her a letter from the\r\nadmiral. Yet it is stated that the partiality of the young princess\r\nbetrayed itself by many involuntary tokens to those around her, who were\r\nthus encouraged to entertain her with accounts of the admiral's\r\nattachment, and to inquire whether, if the consent of the council could\r\nbe obtained, she would consent to admit his addresses. The admiral is\r\nrepresented to have proceeded with caution equal to her own. Anxious to\r\nascertain her sentiments, earnestly desirous to accomplish so splendid\r\nan union, but fully sensible of the inutility as well as danger of a\r\nclandestine connexion, he may be thought rather to have regarded her\r\nhand as the recompense which awaited the success of all his other plans\r\nof ambition, than as the means of obtaining that success; and it seemed\r\nto have been only by distant hints through the agents whom he trusted,\r\nthat he had ventured as yet to intimate to her his views and wishes; but\r\nit is probable that much of the truth was by these agents suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe protector, rather, as it seems, with the desire of criminating his\r\nbrother than of clearing the princess, sent sir Robert Tyrwhitt to her\r\nresidence at Hatfield, empowered to examine her on the whole matter; and\r\nhis letters to his employer inform us of many particulars. When, by the\r\nbase expedient of a counterfeit letter, he had brought her to believe\r\nthat both Mrs. Ashley and Parry were committed to the Tower, \"her grace\r\nwas,\" as he expresses it, \"marvellously abashed, and did weep very\r\ntenderly a long time, demanding whether they had confessed any thing or\r\nnot.\" Soon after, sending for him, she related several circumstances\r\nwhich she said she had forgotten to mention when the master of the\r\nhousehold and master Denny came from the protector to examine her.\r\n\"After all this,\" adds he, \"I did require her to consider her honor, and\r\nthe peril that might ensue, for she was but a subject; and I further\r\ndeclared what a woman Mrs. Ashley was, with a long circumstance, saying\r\nthat if she would open all things herself, that all the evil and shame\r\nshould be ascribed to them, and her youth considered both with the\r\nking's majesty, your grace, and the whole council. But in no way she\r\nwill not confess any practice by Mrs. Ashley or the cofferer concerning\r\nmy lord-admiral; and yet I do see it in her face that she is guilty, and\r\ndo perceive as yet that she will abide the storms or she accuse Mrs.\r\nAshley.\r\n\r\n\"Upon sudden news that my lord great-master and master Denny was arrived\r\nat the gate, the cofferer went hastily to his chamber, and said to my\r\nlady his wife, 'I would I had never been born, for I am undone,' and\r\nwrung his hands, and cast away his chain from his neck, and his rings\r\nfrom his fingers. This is confessed by his own servant, and there is\r\ndivers witnesses of the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day Tyrwhitt writes, that all he has yet gotten from the\r\nprincess was by gentle persuasion, whereby he began to grow with her in\r\ncredit, \"for I do assure your grace she hath a good wit, and nothing is\r\ngotten off her but by great policy.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after, he expresses to the protector his opinion that there\r\nhad been some secret promise between the princess, Mrs. Ashley, and the\r\ncofferer, never to confess till death; \"and if it be so,\" he observes,\r\n\"it will never be gotten of her but either by the king's majesty or else\r\nby your grace.\" On another occasion he confirms this idea by stating\r\nthat he had tried her with false intelligence of Parry's having\r\nconfessed, on which she called him \"false wretch,\" and said that it was\r\na great matter for him to make such a promise and break it. He notices\r\nthe exact agreement between the princess and the other two in all their\r\nstatements, but represents it as a proof that \"they had set the knot\r\nbefore.\" It appears on the whole, that sir Robert with all his pains was\r\nnot able to elicit a single fact of decisive importance; but probably\r\nthere was somewhat more in the matter than we find acknowledged in a\r\nletter from Elizabeth herself to the protector. She here states, that\r\nshe did indeed send her cofferer to speak with the lord-admiral, but on\r\nno other business than to recommend to him one of her chaplains, and to\r\nrequest him to use his interest that she might have Durham Place for her\r\ntown house; that Parry on his return informed her, that the admiral said\r\nshe could not have Durham Place, which was wanted for a mint, but\r\noffered her his own house for the time of her being in London; and that\r\nParry then inquired of her, whether, if the council would consent to her\r\nmarrying the admiral, she would herself be willing? That she refused to\r\nanswer this question, requiring to know who bade him ask it. He said, No\r\none; but from the admiral's inquiries what she spent in her house, and\r\nwhether she had gotten her patents for certain lands signed, and other\r\nquestions of a similar nature, he thought \"that he was given that way\r\nrather than otherwise.\" She explicitly denies that her governess ever\r\nadvised her to marry the admiral without the consent of the council; but\r\nrelates with great apparent ingenuousness, the hints which Mrs. Ashley\r\nhad thrown out of his attachment to her, and the artful attempts which\r\nshe had made to discover how her pupil stood affected towards such a\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\nThe letter concludes with the following wise and spirited assertion of\r\nherself. \"Master Tyrwhitt and others have told me, that there goeth\r\nrumours abroad which be greatly both against my honor and honesty,\r\n(which above all things I esteem) which be these; that I am in the\r\nTower, and with child by my lord admiral. My lord, these are shameful\r\nslanders, for the which, besides the desire I have to see the king's\r\nmajesty, I shall most humbly desire your lordship that I may come to the\r\ncourt after your first determination, that I may show myself there as I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nThat the cofferer had repeated his visits to the admiral oftener than\r\nwas at first acknowledged either by his lady or himself, a confession\r\nafterwards addressed by Elizabeth to the protector seems to show; but\r\neven with this confession Tyrwhitt declares himself unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nParry, in that part of his confession where he relates what passed\r\nbetween himself and the lord-admiral when he waited upon him by his\r\nlady's command, takes notice of the earnest manner in which the admiral\r\nhad urged her endeavouring to procure, by way of exchange, certain crown\r\nlands which had been the queen's, and seem to have been adjacent to his\r\nown, from which, he says, he inferred, that he wanted to have both them\r\nand his lady for himself. He adds, that the admiral said he wished the\r\nprincess to go to the duchess of Somerset, and by her means make suit to\r\nthe protector for the lands, and for a town house, and \"to entertain her\r\ngrace for her furtherance.\" That when he repeated this to her, Elizabeth\r\nwould not at first believe that he had said such words, or could wish\r\nher so to do; but on his declaring that it was true, \"she seemed to be\r\nangry that she should be driven to make such suits, and said, 'In faith\r\nI will not come there, nor begin to flatter now.'\"\r\n\r\nHer spirit broke out, according to Tyrwhitt, with still greater\r\nvehemence, on the removal of Mrs. Ashley, whom lady Tyrwhitt succeeded\r\nin her office:--the following is the account which he gives of her\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\"Pleaseth it your grace to be advertised, that after my wife's repair\r\nhither, she declared to the lady Elizabeth's grace, that she was called\r\nbefore your grace and the council and had a rebuke, that she had not\r\ntaken upon her the office to see her well governed, in the lieu of Mrs.\r\nAshley. Her answer was, that Mrs. Ashley was her mistress, and that she\r\nhad not so demeaned herself that the council should now need to put any\r\nmo mistresses unto her. Whereunto my wife answered, seeing she did allow\r\nMrs. Ashley to be her mistress, she need not to be ashamed to have any\r\nhonest woman to be in that place. She took the matter so heavily that\r\nshe wept all that night and lowered all the next day, till she received\r\nyour letter; and then she sent for me and asked me whether she was best\r\nto write to you again or not: I said, if she would make answer that she\r\nwould follow the effect of your letter, I thought it well done that she\r\nshould write; but in the end of the matter I perceived that she was very\r\nloth to have a governor; and to avoid the same, said the world would\r\nnote her to be a great offender, having so hastily a governor appointed\r\nher. And all is no more, she fully hopes to recover her old mistress\r\nagain. The love she yet beareth her is to be wondered at. I told her, if\r\nshe would consider her honor and the sequel thereof, she would,\r\nconsidering her years, make suit to your grace to have one, rather than\r\nto make delay to be without one one hour. She cannot digest such advice\r\nin no way; but if I should say my phantasy, it were more meet she should\r\nhave two than one. She would in any wise write to your grace, wherein I\r\noffered her my advice, which she would in no wise follow, but write her\r\nown phantasy. She beginneth now a little to droop, by reason she heareth\r\nthat my lord-admiral's houses be dispersed. And my wife telleth me now,\r\nthat she cannot hear him discommended but she is ready to make answer\r\ntherein; and so she hath not been accustomed to do, unless Mrs. Ashley\r\nwere touched, whereunto she was very ready to make answer vehemently.\"\r\n&c.[11]\r\n\r\n[Note 11: For the original documents relative to this affair see\r\nBurleigh Papers by Haynes, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nParry had probably the same merit of fidelity as Mrs. Ashley; for\r\nthough Tyrwhitt says he was found faulty in his accounts, he was not\r\nonly continued at this time by his mistress in his office of cofferer,\r\nbut raised afterwards to that of comptroller of the royal household,\r\nwhich he held till his death.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of the name of Harrington, then in the admiral's service,\r\nwho was much examined respecting his master's intercourse with the\r\nprincess, and revealed nothing, was subsequently taken by her into her\r\nown household and highly favored; and so certain did this gentleman, who\r\nwas a man of parts, account himself of her tenderness for the memory of\r\na lover snatched from her by the hand of violence alone, that he\r\nventured, several years after her accession to the throne, to present\r\nher with a portrait of him, under which was inscribed the following\r\nsonnet.\r\n\r\n    \"Of person rare, strong limbs and manly shape,\r\n    By nature framed to serve on sea or land;\r\n    In friendship firm in good state or ill hap,\r\n    In peace head-wise, in war, skill great, bold hand.\r\n    On horse or foot, in peril or in play,\r\n    None could excel, though many did essay.\r\n    A subject true to king, a servant great,\r\n    Friend to God's truth, and foe to Rome's deceit.\r\n    Sumptuous abroad for honor of the land,\r\n    Temp'rate at home, yet kept great state with stay,\r\n    And noble house that fed more mouths with meat\r\n    Than some advanced on higher steps to stand;\r\n    Yet against nature, reason, and just laws,\r\n    His blood was spilt, guiltless, without just cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe fall of Seymour, and the disgrace and danger in which she had\r\nherself been involved, afforded to Elizabeth a severe but useful\r\nlesson; and the almost total silence of history respecting her during\r\nthe remainder of her brother's reign affords satisfactory indication of\r\nthe extreme caution with which she now conducted herself.\r\n\r\nThis silence, however, is agreeably supplied by documents of a more\r\nprivate nature, which inform us of her studies, her acquirements, the\r\ndisposition of her time, and the bent of her youthful mind.\r\n\r\nThe Latin letters of her learned preceptor Roger Ascham abound with\r\nanecdotes of a pupil in whose proficiency he justly gloried; and the\r\nparticulars interspersed respecting other females of high rank, also\r\ndistinguished by the cultivation of classical literature, enhance the\r\ninterest of the picture, by affording objects of comparison to the\r\nprincipal figure, and illustrating the taste, almost the rage, for\r\nlearning which pervaded the court of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1550 to his friend John Sturmius, the worthy and erudite\r\nrector of the protestant university of Strasburgh, Ascham has the\r\nfollowing passages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Never was the nobility of England more lettered than at present. Our\r\nillustrious king Edward in talent, industry, perseverance, and\r\nerudition, surpasses both his own years and the belief of men.... I\r\ndoubt not that France will also yield the just praise of learning to the\r\nduke of Suffolk[12] and the rest of that band of noble youths educated\r\nwith the king in Greek and Latin literature, who depart for that\r\ncountry on this very day.\r\n\r\n[Note 12: This was the second duke of the name of Brandon, who died\r\nyoung of the sweating sickness.]\r\n\r\n\"Numberless honorable ladies of the present time surpass the daughters\r\nof sir Thomas More in every kind of learning. But amongst them all, my\r\nillustrious mistress the lady Elizabeth shines like a star, excelling\r\nthem more by the splendor of her virtues and her learning, than by the\r\nglory of her royal birth. In the variety of her commendable qualities, I\r\nam less perplexed to find matter for the highest panegyric than to\r\ncircumscribe that panegyric within just bounds. Yet I shall mention\r\nnothing respecting her but what has come under my own observation.\r\n\r\n\"For two years she pursued the study of Greek and Latin under my\r\ntuition; but the foundations of her knowledge in both languages were\r\nlaid by the diligent instruction of William Grindal, my late beloved\r\nfriend and seven years my pupil in classical learning at Cambridge. From\r\nthis university he was summoned by John Cheke to court, where he soon\r\nafter received the appointment of tutor to this lady. After some years,\r\nwhen through her native genius, aided by the efforts of so excellent a\r\nmaster, she had made a great progress in learning, and Grindal, by his\r\nmerit and the favor of his mistress, might have aspired to high\r\ndignities, he was snatched away by a sudden illness, leaving a greater\r\nmiss of himself in the court, than I remember any other to have done\r\nthese many years.\r\n\r\n\"I was appointed to succeed him in his office; and the work which he had\r\nso happily begun, without my assistance indeed, but not without some\r\ncounsels of mine, I diligently labored to complete. Now, however,\r\nreleased from the throng of a court, and restored to the felicity of my\r\nformer learned leisure, I enjoy, through the bounty of the king, an\r\nhonorable appointment in this university.\r\n\r\n\"The lady Elizabeth has accomplished her sixteenth year; and so much\r\nsolidity of understanding, such courtesy united with dignity, have never\r\nbeen observed at so early an age. She has the most ardent love of true\r\nreligion and of the best kind of literature. The constitution of her\r\nmind is exempt from female weakness, and she is endued with a masculine\r\npower of application. No apprehension can be quicker than her's, no\r\nmemory more retentive. French and Italian she speaks like English;\r\nLatin, with fluency, propriety, and judgement; she also spoke Greek with\r\nme, frequently, willingly, and moderately well. Nothing can be more\r\nelegant than her handwriting, whether in the Greek or Roman character.\r\nIn music she is very skilful, but does not greatly delight. With respect\r\nto personal decoration, she greatly prefers a simple elegance to show\r\nand splendor, so despising 'the outward adorning of plaiting the hair\r\nand of wearing of gold,' that in the whole manner of her life she rather\r\nresembles Hippolyta than Phaedra.\r\n\r\n\"She read with me almost the whole of Cicero, and a great part of Livy:\r\nfrom these two authors, indeed, her knowledge of the Latin language has\r\nbeen almost exclusively derived. The beginning of the day was always\r\ndevoted by her to the New Testament in Greek, after which she read\r\nselect orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of Sophocles, which I\r\njudged best adapted to supply her tongue with the purest diction, her\r\nmind with the most excellent precepts, and her exalted station with a\r\ndefence against the utmost power of fortune. For her religious\r\ninstruction, she drew first from the fountains of Scripture, and\r\nafterwards from St. Cyprian, the 'Common places' of Melancthon, and\r\nsimilar works which convey pure doctrine in elegant language. In every\r\nkind of writing she easily detected any ill-adapted or far-fetched\r\nexpression. She could not bear those feeble imitators of Erasmus who\r\nbind the Latin language in the fetters of miserable proverbs; on the\r\nother hand, she approved a style chaste in its propriety, and beautiful\r\nby perspicuity, and she greatly admired metaphors, when not too violent,\r\nand antitheses when just, and happily opposed. By a diligent attention\r\nto these particulars, her ears became so practised and so nice, that\r\nthere was nothing in Greek, Latin, or English, prose or verse, which,\r\naccording to its merits or defects, she did not either reject with\r\ndisgust, or receive with the highest delight.... Had I more leisure, I\r\nwould speak to you at greater length of the king, of the lady Elizabeth,\r\nand of the daughters of the duke of Somerset, whose minds have also been\r\nformed by the best literary instruction. But there are two English\r\nladies whom I cannot omit to mention; nor would I have you, my Sturmius,\r\nomit them, if you meditate any celebration of your English friends, than\r\nwhich nothing could be more agreeable to me. One is Jane Grey[13], the\r\nother is Mildred Cecil, who understands and speaks Greek like English,\r\nso that it may be doubted whether she is most happy in the possession of\r\nthis surpassing degree of knowledge, or in having had for her preceptor\r\nand father sir Anthony Coke, whose singular erudition caused him to be\r\njoined with John Cheke in the office of tutor to the king, or finally,\r\nin having become the wife of William Cecil, lately appointed secretary\r\nof state; a young man indeed, but mature in wisdom, and so deeply\r\nskilled both in letters and in affairs, and endued with such moderation\r\nin the exercise of public offices, that to him would be awarded by the\r\nconsenting voice of Englishmen the four-fold praise attributed to\r\nPericles by his rival Thucydides--'To know all that is fitting, to be\r\nable to apply what he knows, to be a lover of his country, and superior\r\nto money.'\"\r\n\r\n[Note 13: This lady is commemorated at greater length in another\r\nplace, and therefore a clause is here omitted.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe learned, excellent, and unfortunate Jane Grey is repeatedly\r\nmentioned by this writer with warm and merited eulogium. He relates to\r\nSturmius, that in the month of August 1550, taking his journey from\r\nYorkshire to the court, he had deviated from his course to visit the\r\nfamily of the marquis of Dorset at his seat of Broadgate in\r\nLeicestershire. Lady Jane was alone at his arrival, the rest of the\r\nfamily being on a hunting party; and gaining admission to her apartment,\r\nhe found her reading by herself the Phaedo of Plato in the original,\r\nwhich she understood so perfectly as to excite in him extreme wonder;\r\nfor she was at this time under fifteen years of age. She also possessed\r\nthe power of speaking and writing Greek, and she willingly promised to\r\naddress to him a letter in this language. In his English work 'The\r\nSchoolmaster,' referring again to this interview with Jane Grey, Ascham\r\nadds the following curious and affecting particulars. Having asked her\r\nhow at her age she could have attained to such perfection both in\r\nphilosophy and Greek, \"I will tell you,\" said she, \"and tell you a\r\ntruth, which perchance you will marvel at. One of the greatest benefits\r\nthat ever God gave me is, that he sent me so sharp and severe parents,\r\nand so gentle a schoolmaster. For when I am in presence either of father\r\nor mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand, or go; eat, drink,\r\nbe merry or sad; be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing any thing else, I\r\nmust do it, as it were, in such weight, measure, and number, even so\r\nperfectly, as God made the world, or else I am so sharply taunted, so\r\ncruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips, and bobs\r\nand other ways which I will not name, for the honor I bear them, so\r\nwithout measure misordered, that I think myself in hell, till time come\r\nthat I must go to Mr. Elmer, who teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly,\r\nwith such fair allurements to learning, that I think all the time\r\nnothing while I am with him. And when I am called from him I fall on\r\nweeping, because whatsoever else I do but learning, is full of grief,\r\ntrouble, fear, and whole misliking unto me. And thus my book hath been\r\nso much my pleasure, and bringeth daily to me more pleasure and more,\r\nthat in respect of it, all other pleasures, in very deed, be but trifles\r\nand troubles unto me.\"\r\n\r\nThe epistles from which the extracts in the preceding pages are with\r\nsome abridgement translated, and which are said to be the first\r\ncollection of private letters ever published by any Englishman, were all\r\nwritten during the year 1550, when Ascham, on some disgust, had quitted\r\nthe court and returned to his situation of Greek reader at Cambridge;\r\nand perhaps the eulogiums here bestowed, in epistles which his\r\ncorrespondent lost no time in committing to the press, were not composed\r\nwithout the secret hope of their procuring for him a restoration to that\r\ncourt life which it seems difficult even for the learned to quit without\r\na sigh. It would be unjust, however, to regard Ascham in the light of a\r\nflatterer; for his praises are in most points corroborated by the\r\nevidence of history, or by other concurring testimonies. His\r\nobservations, for instance, on the modest simplicity of Elizabeth's\r\ndress and appearance at this early period of her life, which might be\r\nreceived with some incredulity by the reader to whom instances are\r\nfamiliar of her inordinate love of dress at a much more advanced age,\r\nand when the cares of a sovereign ought to have left no room for a\r\nvanity so puerile, receive strong confirmation from another and very\r\nrespectable authority.\r\n\r\nDr. Elmer or Aylmer, who was tutor to lady Jane Grey and her sisters,\r\nand became afterwards, during Elizabeth's reign, bishop of London, thus\r\ndraws her character when young, in a work entitled \"A Harbour for\r\nfaithful Subjects.\" \"The king left her rich cloaths and jewels; and I\r\nknow it to be true, that in seven years after her father's death, she\r\nnever in all that time looked upon that rich attire and precious jewels\r\nbut once, and that against her will. And that there never came gold or\r\nstone upon her head, till her sister forced her to lay off her former\r\nsoberness, and bear her company in her glittering gayness. And then she\r\nso wore it, as every man might see that her body carried that which her\r\nheart misliked. I am sure that her maidenly apparel which she used in\r\nking Edward's time, made the noblemen's daughters and wives to be\r\nashamed to be dressed and painted like peacocks; being more moved with\r\nher most virtuous example than with all that ever Paul or Peter wrote\r\ntouching that matter. Yea, this I know, that a great man's daughter\r\n(lady Jane Grey) receiving from lady Mary before she was queen good\r\napparel of tinsel, cloth of gold and velvet, laid on with parchment lace\r\nof gold, when she saw it, said, 'What shall I do with it?' 'Mary,' said\r\na gentlewoman, 'wear it.' 'Nay,' quoth she, 'that were a shame, to\r\nfollow my lady Mary against God's word, and leave my lady Elizabeth\r\nwhich followeth God's word.' And when all the ladies at the coming of\r\nthe Scots queen dowager, Mary of Guise, (she who visited England in\r\nEdward's time,) went with their hair frownsed, curled, and doublecurled,\r\nshe altered nothing but kept her old maidenly shamefacedness.\" This\r\nextract may be regarded as particularly curious, as an exemplification\r\nof the rigid turn of sentiment which prevailed at the court of young\r\nEdward, and of the degree in which Elizabeth conformed herself to it.\r\nThere is a print from a portrait of her when young, in which the hair is\r\nwithout a single ornament and the whole dress remarkably simple.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Ascham.--The qualifications of this learned man as a\r\nwriter of classical Latin recommended him to queen Mary, notwithstanding\r\nhis known attachment to the protestant faith, in the capacity of Latin\r\nsecretary; and it was in the year 1555, while holding this station, that\r\nhe resumed his lessons to his illustrious pupil.\r\n\r\n\"The lady Elizabeth and I,\" writes he to Sturmius, \"are reading together\r\nin Greek the Orations of AEschines and Demosthenes. She reads before me,\r\nand at first sight she so learnedly comprehends not only the idiom of\r\nthe language and the meaning of the orator, but the whole grounds of\r\ncontention, the decrees of the people, and the customs and manners of\r\nthe Athenians, as you would greatly wonder to hear.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Elizabeth, Ascham retained his post of Latin\r\nsecretary, and was admitted to considerable intimacy by his royal\r\nmistress. Addressing Sturmius he says, \"I received your last letters on\r\nthe 15th of January 1560. Two passages in them, one relative to the\r\nScotch affairs, the other on the marriage of the queen, induced me to\r\ngive them to herself to read. She remarked and graciously acknowledged\r\nin both of them your respectful observance of her. Your judgement in the\r\naffairs of Scotland, as they then stood, she highly approved, and she\r\nloves you for your solicitude respecting us and our concerns. The part\r\nrespecting her marriage she read over thrice, as I well remember, and\r\nwith somewhat of a gentle smile; but still preserving a modest and\r\nbashful silence.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning that point indeed, my Sturmius, I have nothing certain to\r\nwrite to you, nor does any one truly know what to judge. I told you\r\nrightly, in one of my former letters, that in the whole ordinance of her\r\nlife she resembled not Phaedra but Hippolyta; for by nature, and not by\r\nthe counsels of others, she is thus averse and abstinent from marriage.\r\nWhen I know any thing for certain, I will write it to you as soon as\r\npossible; in the mean time I have no hopes to give you respecting the\r\nking of Sweden.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, after enlarging, somewhat too rhetorically perhaps,\r\non the praises of the queen and her government, Ascham recurs to his\r\nfavorite theme,--her learning; and roundly asserts, that there were not\r\nfour men in England, distinguished either in the church or the state,\r\nwho understood more Greek than her majesty: and as an instance of her\r\nproficiency in other tongues, he mentions that he was once present at\r\ncourt when she gave answers at the same time to three ambassadors, the\r\nImperial, the French, and the Swedish, in Italian, in French, and in\r\nLatin; and all this, fluently, without confusion, and to the purpose.\r\n\r\nA short epistle from queen Elizabeth to Sturmius, which is inserted in\r\nthis collection, appears to refer to that of Sturmius which Ascham\r\nanswers above. She addresses him as her beloved friend, expresses in the\r\nhandsomest terms her sense of the attachment towards herself and her\r\ncountry evinced by so eminent a cultivator of genuine learning and true\r\nreligion, and promises that her acknowledgements shall not be confined\r\nto words alone; but for a further explanation of her intentions she\r\nrefers him to the bearer; consequently we have no data for estimating\r\nthe actual pecuniary value of these warm expressions of royal favor and\r\nfriendship. But we have good proof, unfortunately, that no munificent\r\nact of Elizabeth's ever interposed to rescue her zealous and admiring\r\npreceptor from the embarrassments into which he was plunged, probably\r\nindeed by his own imprudent habits, but certainly by no faults which\r\nought to have deprived him of his just claims on the purse of a mistress\r\nwhom, he had served with so much ability, and with such distinguished\r\nadvantage to herself. The other learned females of this age whom Ascham\r\nhas complimented by addressing them in Latin epistles, are, Anne\r\ncountess of Pembroke, sister of queen Catherine Parr; a young lady of\r\nthe name of Vaughan; Jane Grey; and Mrs. Clark, a grand-daughter of sir\r\nThomas More, by his favorite daughter Mrs. Roper. In his letter to this\r\nlast lady, written during the reign of Mary, after congratulating her on\r\nher cultivation, amid the luxury and dissipation of a court, of studies\r\nworthy the descendant of a man whose high qualities had ennobled England\r\nin the estimation of foreign nations, he proceeds to mention, that he is\r\nthe person whom, several years ago, her excellent mother had requested\r\nto undertake the instruction of all her children in Greek and Latin\r\nliterature. At that time, he says, no offer could tempt him to quit his\r\nlearned retirement at Cambridge, and he was reluctantly compelled to\r\ndecline the proposal; but being now once more established at court, he\r\nfreely offers to a lady whose accomplishments he so much admires, any\r\nassistance in her laudable pursuits which it may be in his power to\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nA few more scattered notices may be collected relative to this period of\r\nthe life of Elizabeth. Her talents, her vivacity, her proficiency in\r\nthose classical studies to which he was himself addicted, and especially\r\nthe attachment which she manifested to the reformed religion, endeared\r\nher exceedingly to the young king her brother, who was wont to call\r\nher,--perhaps with reference to the sobriety of dress and manners by\r\nwhich she was then distinguished,--his sweet sister Temperance. On her\r\npart his affection was met by every demonstration of sisterly\r\ntenderness, joined to those delicate attentions and respectful\r\nobservances which his rank required.\r\n\r\nIt was probably about 1550 that she addressed to him the following\r\nletter on his having desired her picture, which affords perhaps the most\r\nfavorable specimen extant of her youthful style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Like as the rich man that daily gathereth riches to riches, and to one\r\nbag of money layeth a great sort till it come to infinite: so methinks\r\nyour majesty, not being sufficed with so many benefits and gentleness\r\nshewed to me afore this time, doth now increase them in asking and\r\ndesiring where you may bid and command; requiring a thing not worthy the\r\ndesiring for itself, but made worthy for your highness' request. My\r\npicture I mean: in which, if the inward good mind toward your grace\r\nmight as well be declared, as the outward face and countenance shall be\r\nseen, I would not have tarried the commandment but prevented it, nor\r\nhave been the last to grant but the first to offer it. For the face I\r\ngrant I might well blush to offer, but the mind I shall never be\r\nashamed to present. But though from the grace of the picture the colors\r\nmay fade by time, may give by weather, may be spited by chance; yet the\r\nother, nor time with her swift wings shall overtake, nor the misty\r\nclouds with their lowering may darken, nor chance with her slippery foot\r\nmay overthrow.\r\n\r\n\"Of this also yet the proof could not be great, because the occasions\r\nhave been so small; notwithstanding, as a dog hath a day, so may I\r\nperchance have time to declare it in deeds, which now I do write them\r\nbut in words. And further, I shall humbly beseech your majesty, that\r\nwhen you shall look on my picture, you will witsafe to think, that as\r\nyou have but the outward shadow of the body afore you, so my inward mind\r\nwisheth that the body itself were oftener in your presence. Howbeit\r\nbecause both my so being I think could do your majesty little pleasure,\r\nthough myself great good; and again, because I see not as yet the time\r\nagreeing thereunto, I shall learn to follow this saying of Horace,\r\n'_Feras, non culpes, quod vitari non potest_.' And thus I will\r\n(troubling your majesty I fear) end with my most humble thanks;\r\nbeseeching God long to preserve you to his honor, to your comfort, to\r\nthe realms profit, and to my joy.\r\n\r\n(From Hatfield this 15th day of May.)\r\n\r\nYour majesty's most humble sister and servant\r\n\r\nELIZABETH.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn exact memorialist[14] has preserved an instance of the high\r\nconsideration now enjoyed by Elizabeth in the following passage, which\r\nis further curious as an instance of the state which she already assumed\r\nin her public appearances. \"March 17th (1551). The lady Elizabeth, the\r\nking's sister, rode through London unto St. James's, the king's palace,\r\nwith a great company of lords, knights, and gentlemen; and after her a\r\ngreat company of ladies and gentlemen on horseback, about two hundred.\r\nOn the 19th she came from St. James's through the park to the court; the\r\nway from the park gate unto the court spread with fine sand. She was\r\nattended with a very honorable confluence of noble and worshipful\r\npersons of both sexes, and received with much ceremony at the court\r\ngate.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 14: Strype.]\r\n\r\nThe ensuing letter, however, seems to intimate that there were those\r\nabout the young king who envied her these tokens of favor and credit,\r\nand were sometimes but too successful in estranging her from the royal\r\npresence, and perhaps in exciting prejudices against her:--It is\r\nunfortunately without date of year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The princess Elizabeth to king Edward VI.\r\n\r\n\"Like as a shipman in stormy weather plucks down the sails tarrying for\r\nbetter wind, so did I, most noble king, in my unfortunate chance a\r\nThursday pluck down the high sails of my joy and comfort; and do trust\r\none day, that as troublesome waves have repulsed me backward, so a\r\ngentle wind will bring me forward to my haven. Two chief occasions moved\r\nme much and grieved me greatly: the one, for that I doubted your\r\nmajesty's health; the other, because for all my long tarrying, I went\r\nwithout that I came for. Of the first I am relieved in a part, both that\r\nI understood of your health, and also that your majesty's lodging is far\r\nfrom my lord marques' chamber: of my other grief I am not eased; but the\r\nbest is, that whatsoever other folks will suspect, I intend not to fear\r\nyour grace's good will, which as I know that I never deserved to faint,\r\nso I trust will still stick by me. For if your grace's advice that I\r\nshould return, (whose will is a commandment) had not been, I would not\r\nhave made the half of my way the end of my journey.\r\n\r\n\"And thus as one desirous to hear of your majesty's health, though\r\nunfortunate to see it, I shall pray God to preserve you. (From Hatfield\r\nthis present Saturday.)\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's humble sister to commandment,\r\n\r\n\"ELIZABETH.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1549 TO 1553.\r\n\r\nDecline of the protector's authority.--He is imprisoned--accused of\r\nmisdemeanors--loses his office--is liberated--reconciled with Dudley,\r\nwho succeeds to his authority.--Dudley pushes on the reformation.--The\r\ncelebration of mass prohibited.--Princess Mary persecuted.--The emperor\r\nattempts to get her out of the kingdom, but without success--interferes\r\nopenly in her behalf.--Effect of persecution on the mind of\r\nMary.--Marriage proposed for Elizabeth with the prince of Denmark.--She\r\ndeclines it.--King betrothed to a princess of France.--Sweating\r\nsickness.--Death of the duke of Suffolk.--Dudley procures that title for\r\nthe marquis of Dorset, and the dukedom of Northumberland for\r\nhimself.--Particulars of the last earl of Northumberland.--Trial,\r\nconviction, and death of the duke of Somerset.--Christmas festivities of\r\nthe young king.--Account of George Ferrers master of the king's\r\npastimes, and his works.--Views of Northumberland.--Decline of the\r\nking's health.--Scheme of Northumberland for lady Jane Grey's\r\nsuccession.--Three marriages contrived by him for this purpose.--He\r\nprocures a settlement of the crown on the lady Jane.--Subserviency of\r\nthe council.--Death of Edward concealed by Northumberland.--The\r\nprincesses narrowly escape falling into his hands.--Courageous conduct\r\nof Elizabeth.--Northumberland deserted by the council and the\r\narmy.--Jane Grey imprisoned.--Northumberland arrested.--Mary mounts the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was to little purpose that the protector had stained his hands with\r\nthe blood of his brother, for the exemption thus purchased from one\r\nkind of fear or danger, was attended by a degree of public odium which\r\ncould not fail to render feeble and tottering an authority based, like\r\nhis, on plain and open usurpation.\r\n\r\nOther causes conspired to undermine his credit and prepare his\r\noverthrow. The hatred of the great nobles, which he augmented by a\r\nsomewhat too ostentatious patronage of the lower classes against the\r\nrich and powerful, continually pursued and watched the opportunity to\r\nruin him. Financial difficulties pressed upon him, occasioned in great\r\nmeasure by the wars with France and Scotland which he had carried on, in\r\npursuance of Henry's design of compelling the Scotch to marry their\r\nyoung queen to his son. An object which had finally been frustrated,\r\nnotwithstanding the vigilance of the English fleet, by the safe arrival\r\nof Mary in France, and her solemn betrothment to the dauphin. The great\r\nand glorious work of religious reformation, though followed by Somerset,\r\nunder the guidance of Cranmer, with a moderation and prudence which\r\nreflect the highest honor on both, could not be brought to perfection\r\nwithout exciting the rancorous hostility of thousands, whom various\r\nmotives and interests attached to the cause of ancient superstition; and\r\nthe abolition, by authority, of the mass, and the destruction of images\r\nand crucifixes, had given birth to serious disturbances in different\r\nparts of the country. The want and oppression under which the lower\r\norders groaned,--and which they attributed partly to the suppression of\r\nthe monasteries to which they had been accustomed to resort for the\r\nsupply of their necessities, partly to a general inclosure bill\r\nextremely cruel and arbitrary in its provisions,--excited commotions\r\nstill more violent and alarming. In order to suppress the insurrection\r\nin Norfolk, headed by Kett, it had at length been found necessary to\r\nsend thither a large body of troops under the earl of Warwick, who had\r\nacquired a very formidable degree of celebrity by the courage and\r\nconduct which he exhibited in bringing this difficult enterprise to a\r\nsuccessful termination.\r\n\r\nA party was now formed in the council, of which Warwick, Southampton,\r\nArundel, and St. John, were the chiefs; and strong resolutions were\r\nentered into against the assumed authority of the protector. This\r\nunfortunate man, whom an inconsiderate ambition, fostered by\r\ncircumstances favorable to its success, had pushed forward into a\r\nstation equally above his talents and his birth, was now found destitute\r\nof all the resources of courage and genius which might yet have\r\nretrieved his authority and his credit. He suffered himself to be\r\nsurprised into acts indicative of weakness and dismay, which soon robbed\r\nhim of his remaining partisans, and gave to his enemies all the\r\nadvantage which they desired.\r\n\r\nHis committal to the Tower on several charges, of which his assumption\r\nof the whole authority of the state was the principal, soon followed. A\r\nshort time after he was deprived of his high office, which was nominally\r\nvested in six members of the council, but really in the earl of Warwick,\r\nwhose private ambition seems to have been the main-spring of the whole\r\nintrigue, and who thus became, almost without a struggle, undisputed\r\nmaster of the king and kingdom.\r\n\r\nThat poorness of spirit which had sunk the duke of Somerset into\r\ninsignificance, saved him at present from further mischief. In the\r\nbeginning of the ensuing year, 1550, having on his knees confessed\r\nhimself guilty of all the matters laid to his charge, without\r\nreservation or exception, and humbly submitted himself to the king's\r\nmercy, he was condemned in a heavy fine, on remission of which by the\r\nking he was liberated. Soon after, by the special favor of his royal\r\nnephew, he was readmitted into the council; and a reconciliation was\r\nmediated for him with Warwick, cemented by a marriage between one of his\r\ndaughters and the son and heir of this aspiring leader.\r\n\r\nThe catholic party, which had flattered itself that the earl of Warwick,\r\nfrom gratitude for the support which some of its leaders had afforded\r\nhim, and perhaps also from principle, no less than from opposition to\r\nthe duke of Somerset, would be led to embrace its defence, was now\r\ndestined to deplore its disappointment.\r\n\r\nDetermined to rule alone, he soon shook off his able but too aspiring\r\ncolleague, the earl of Southampton, and disgraced, by the imposition of\r\na fine for some alleged embezzlement of public money, the earl of\r\nArundel, also a known assertor of the ancient faith, finally, having\r\nobserved how closely the principles of protestantism, which Edward had\r\nderived from instructors equally learned and zealous, had interwoven\r\nthemselves with the whole texture and fabric of his mind, he resolved\r\nto merit the lasting attachment of the royal minor by assisting him to\r\ncomplete the overthrow of popery in England.\r\n\r\nA confession of faith was now drawn up by commissioners appointed for\r\nthe purpose, and various alterations were made in the Liturgy, which had\r\nalready been translated into the vulgar tongue for church use. Tests\r\nwere imposed, which Gardiner, Bonner, and several others of the bishops\r\nfelt themselves called upon by conscience, or a regard to their own\r\nreputation, to decline subscribing, even at the price of deprivation;\r\nand prodigious devastations were made by the courtiers on the property\r\nof the church. To perform or assist at the performance of the mass was\r\nalso rendered highly penal. But no dread of legal animadversion was\r\ncapable of deterring the lady Mary from the observance of this essential\r\nrite of her religion; and finding herself and her household exposed to\r\nserious inconveniences on account of their infraction of the new\r\nstatute, she applied for protection to her potent kinsman the emperor\r\nCharles V., who is said to have undertaken her rescue by means which\r\ncould scarcely have failed to involve him in a war with England. By his\r\norders, or connivance, certain ships were prepared in the ports of\r\nFlanders, manned and armed for an attempt to carry off the princess\r\neither by stealth or open force, and land her at Antwerp. In furtherance\r\nof the design, several of her gentlemen had already taken their\r\ndeparture for that city, and Flemish light vessels were observed to keep\r\nwatch on the English coast. But by these appearances the apprehensions\r\nof the council were awakened, and a sudden journey of the princess from\r\nHunsdon in Hertfordshire towards Norfolk, for which she was unable to\r\nassign a satisfactory reason, served as strong confirmation of their\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nA violent alarm was immediately sounded through the nation, of foreign\r\ninvasion designed to co-operate with seditions at home; bodies of troops\r\nwere dispatched to protect different points of the coast; and several\r\nships of war were equipped for sea; while a communication on the subject\r\nwas made by the council to the nobility throughout the kingdom, in terms\r\ncalculated to awaken indignation against the persecuted princess, and\r\nall who were suspected, justly or unjustly, of regarding her cause with\r\nfavor. A few extracts from this paper will exhibit the fierce and\r\njealous spirit of that administration of which Dudley formed the soul.\r\n\r\n\"So it is, that the lady Mary, not many days past, removed from Newhall\r\nin Essex to her house of Hunsdon in Hertfordshire, the cause whereof,\r\nalthough we knew not, yet did we rather think it likely that her grace\r\nwould have come to have seen his majesty; but now upon Tuesday last, she\r\nhath suddenly, without knowledge given either to us here or to the\r\ncountry there, and without any cause in the world by us to her given,\r\ntaken her journey from Hunsdon towards Norfolk\" &c. \"This her doing we\r\nbe sorry for, both for the evil opinion the king's majesty our master\r\nmay conceive thereby of her, and for that by the same doth appear\r\nmanifestly the malicious rancour of such as provoke her thus to breed\r\nand stir up, as much as in her and them lieth, occasion of disorder and\r\nunquiet in the realm\" &c. \"It is not unknown to us but some near about\r\nthe said lady Mary have very lately in the night seasons had privy\r\nconferences with the emperor's embassador here being, which councils can\r\nno wise tend to the weal of the king's majesty our master or his realm,\r\nnor to the nobility of this realm. And whatsoever the lady Mary shall\r\nupon instigation of these forward practices further do, like to these\r\nher strange beginnings, we doubt not but your lordship will provide that\r\nher proceedings shall not move any disobedience or disorder--The effect\r\nwhereof if her counsellors should procure, as it must be to her grace,\r\nand to all other good Englishmen therein seduced, damnable, so shall it\r\nbe most hurtful to the good subjects of the country\" &c.[15]\r\n\r\n[Note 15: Burleigh Papers by Haynes.]\r\n\r\nThus did the fears, the policy, or the party-spirit, of the members of\r\nthe council lead them to magnify the peril of the nation from the\r\nenterprises of a young and defenceless female, whose best friend was a\r\nforeign prince, whose person was completely within their power, and who,\r\nat this period of her life \"more sinned against than sinning,\" was not\r\neven suspected of any other design than that of withdrawing herself from\r\na country in which she was no longer allowed to worship God according to\r\nher conscience. Some slight tumults in Essex and Kent, in which she was\r\nnot even charged with any participation, were speedily suppressed; and\r\nafter some conference with the chancellor and secretary Petre, Mary\r\nobeyed a summons to attend them to the court, where she was now to be\r\ndetained for greater security.\r\n\r\nOn her arrival she received a reprimand from the council for her\r\nobstinacy respecting the mass, with an injunction to instruct herself,\r\nby reading, in the grounds of protestant belief. To this she replied,\r\nwith the inflexible resolution of her character, that as to protestant\r\nbooks, she thanked God that she never had read any, and never intended\r\nso to do; that for her religion she was ready to lay down her life, and\r\nonly feared that she might not be found worthy to become its martyr. One\r\nof her chaplains was soon after thrown into prison; and further\r\nseverities seemed to await her, when a message from the emperor,\r\nmenacing the country with war in case she should be debarred from the\r\nfree exercise of her religion, taught the council the expediency of\r\nrelaxing a little the sternness of their intolerance. But the scruples\r\nof the zealous young king on this head could not be brought to yield to\r\nreasons of state, till he had \"advised with the archbishop of Canterbury\r\nand the bishops of London and Rochester, who gave their opinion that to\r\ngive license to sin was sin, but to connive at sin might be allowed in\r\ncase it were neither long, nor without hope of reformation[16].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 16: Hayward's Life of Edward VI.]\r\n\r\nBy this prudent and humane but somewhat jesuitical decision this\r\nperplexing affair was set at rest for the present; and during the small\r\nremainder of her brother's reign, a negative kind of persecution,\r\nconsisting in disfavor, obloquy, and neglect, was all, apparently, that\r\nthe lady Mary was called upon to undergo. But she had already endured\r\nenough to sour her temper, to aggravate with feelings of personal\r\nanimosity her systematic abhorrence of what she deemed impious heresy,\r\nand to bind to her heart by fresh and stronger ties that cherished\r\nfaith, in defence of which she was proudly conscious of having struggled\r\nand suffered with a lofty and unyielding intrepidity.\r\n\r\nIn order to counterbalance the threatened hostility of Spain, and impose\r\nan additional check on the catholic party at home, it was now judged\r\nexpedient for the king to strengthen himself by an alliance with\r\nChristian III. king of Denmark; an able and enlightened prince, who in\r\nthe early part of his reign had opposed with vigor the aggressions of\r\nthe emperor Charles V. on the independence of the north of Europe, and\r\nmore recently had acquired the respect of the whole protestant body by\r\nestablishing the reformation in his dominions. An agent was accordingly\r\ndispatched with a secret commission to sound the inclinations of the\r\ncourt of Copenhagen towards a marriage between the prince-royal and the\r\nlady Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThat this negotiation proved fruitless, was apparently owing to the\r\nreluctance to the connexion manifested by Elizabeth; of whom it is\r\nobservable, that she never could be prevailed upon to afford the\r\nsmallest encouragement to the addresses of any foreign prince whilst\r\nshe herself was still a subject; well aware that to accept of an\r\nalliance which would carry her out of the kingdom, was to hazard the\r\nloss of her succession to the English crown, a splendid reversion never\r\nabsent from her aspiring thoughts.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in this design, Edward lost no time in pledging his own\r\nhand to the infant daughter of Henry II. of France, which contract he\r\ndid not live to complete.\r\n\r\nThe splendid French embassy which arrived in England during the year\r\n1550 to make arrangements respecting the dower of the princess, and to\r\nconfer on her intended spouse the order of St. Michael, was received\r\nwith high honors, but found the court-festivities damped by a visitation\r\nof that strange and terrific malady the sweating sickness.\r\n\r\nThis pestilence, first brought into the island by the foreign\r\nmercenaries who composed the army of the earl of Richmond, afterwards\r\nHenry VII., now made its appearance for the fourth and last time in our\r\nannals. It seized principally, it is said, on males, on such as were in\r\nthe prime of their age, and rather on the higher than the lower classes:\r\nwithin the space of twenty-four hours the fate of the sufferer was\r\ndecided for life or death. Its ravages were prodigious; and the general\r\nconsternation was augmented by a superstitious idea which went forth,\r\nthat Englishmen alone, were the destined victims of this mysterious\r\nminister of fate, which tracked their steps, with the malice and\r\nsagacity of an evil spirit, into every distant country of the earth\r\nwhither they might have wandered, whilst it left unassailed all\r\nforeigners in their own.\r\n\r\nTwo of the king's servants died of this disease, and he in consequence\r\nremoved to Hampton Court in haste and with very few attendants. The duke\r\nof Suffolk and his brother, students at Cambridge, were seized with it\r\nat the same time, sleeping in the same bed, and expired within two hours\r\nof each other. They were the children of Charles Brandon by his last\r\nwife, who was in her own right baroness Willoughby of Eresby. This lady\r\nhad already made herself conspicuous by that earnest profession of the\r\nprotestant faith for which, in the reign of Mary, she underwent many\r\nperils and a long exile. She was a munificent patroness of the learned\r\nand zealous divines of her own persuasion, whether natives or\r\nforeigners; and the untimely loss of these illustrious youths, who seem\r\nto have inherited both her religious principles and her love of letters,\r\nwas publicly bewailed by the principal members of the university.\r\n\r\nBut by the earl of Warwick the melancholy event was rendered doubly\r\nconducive to the purposes of his ambition. In the first place it enabled\r\nhim to bind to his interests the marquis of Dorset married to the\r\nhalf-sister of the young duke of Suffolk, by procuring a renewal of the\r\nducal title in his behalf, and next authorized him by a kind of\r\nprecedent to claim for himself the same exalted dignity.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending Dudley's elevation to the ducal rank are\r\nworthy of particular notice, as connected with a melancholy part of the\r\nstory of that old and illustrious family of the Percies, celebrated\r\nthrough so many ages of English history.\r\n\r\nThe last of this house who had borne the title of earl of Northumberland\r\nwas that ardent and favored suitor of Anne Boleyn, who was compelled by\r\nhis father to renounce his pretensions to her hand in deference to the\r\nwishes of a royal competitor.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment and the injury impressed themselves in indelible\r\ncharacters on the heart of Percy: in common with the object of his\r\nattachment, he retained against Wolsey, whom he believed to have been\r\nactively instrumental in fostering the king's passion, a deep\r\nresentment, which is said to have rendered peculiarly acceptable to him\r\nthe duty afterwards imposed upon him, of arresting that celebrated\r\nminister in order to his being brought to his trial. For the lady to\r\nwhom a barbarous exertion of parental authority had compelled him to\r\ngive his hand, while his whole heart was devoted to another, he also\r\nconceived an aversion rather to be lamented than wondered at.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, she brought him no living offspring; and after a few\r\nyears he separated himself from her to indulge his melancholy alone and\r\nwithout molestation. In this manner he spun out a suffering existence,\r\noppressed with sickness of mind and body, disengaged from public life,\r\nand neglectful of his own embarrassed affairs, till the fatal\r\ncatastrophe of his brother, brought to the scaffold in 1537 for his\r\nshare in the popish rebellion under Aske. By this event, and the\r\nattainder of sir Thomas Percy's children which followed, the earl saw\r\nhimself deprived of the only consolation which remained to him,--that of\r\ntransmitting to the posterity of a brother whom he loved, the titles and\r\nestates derived to him through a long and splendid ancestry. As a last\r\nresource, he bequeathed all his land to the king, in the hope, which was\r\nnot finally frustrated, that a return of royal favor might one day\r\nrestore them to the representatives of the Percies.\r\n\r\nThis done, he yielded his weary spirit on the last day of the same month\r\nwhich had seen the fatal catastrophe of his misguided brother.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the title had remained dormant, till the earl of Warwick,\r\nuntouched by commiseration or respect for the misfortunes of so great a\r\nhouse, cut off for the present all chance of its restoration, by causing\r\nthe young monarch whom he governed to confer upon himself the whole of\r\nthe Percy estates, with the new dignity of duke of Northumberland; an\r\nhonor undeserved and ill-acquired, which no son of his was ever\r\npermitted to inherit.\r\n\r\nBut the soaring ambition of Dudley regarded even these splendid\r\nacquisitions of wealth and dignity only as steps to that summit of power\r\nand dominion which he was resolved by all means and at all hazards to\r\nattain; and his next measure was to procure the removal of the only man\r\ncapable in any degree of obstructing his further progress. This was the\r\nlate protector, by whom some relics of authority were still retained.\r\n\r\nAt the instigation of Northumberland, a law was passed making it felony\r\nto conspire against the life of a privy-counsellor; and by various\r\ninsidious modes of provocation, he was soon enabled to bring within the\r\ndanger of this new act an enemy who was rash, little sagacious, by no\r\nmeans scrupulous, and surrounded with violent or treacherous advisers.\r\nOn October 16th 1551, Somerset and several of his relations and\r\ndependants, and on the following day his haughty duchess with certain of\r\nher favorites, were committed to the Tower, charged with treason and\r\nfelony. The duke, being put upon his trial, so clearly disproved most of\r\nthe accusations brought against him that the peers acquitted him of\r\ntreason; but the evidence of his having entertained designs against the\r\nlives of the duke of Northumberland, the marquis of Northampton, and the\r\nearl of Pembroke, appeared so conclusive to his judges,--among whom\r\nthese three noblemen themselves did not blush to take their seats,--that\r\nhe was found guilty of the felony.\r\n\r\nAfter his condemnation, Somerset acknowledged with contrition that he\r\nhad once mentioned to certain persons an intention of assassinating\r\nthese lords; but he protested that he had never taken any measures for\r\ncarrying this wicked purpose into execution. However this might be, no\r\nact of violence had been committed, and it was hoped by many and\r\nexpected by more, that the royal mercy might yet be extended to preserve\r\nhis life: but Northumberland spared no efforts to incense the king\r\nagainst his unhappy uncle; he also contrived by a course of amusements\r\nand festivities to divert him from serious thought; and on January 21st\r\n1552, to the great regret of the common people and the dismay of the\r\nprotestant party, the duke of Somerset underwent the fatal stroke on\r\nTower-hill.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole interval between the condemnation and death of his\r\nuncle, the king, as we are informed, had been entertained by the nobles\r\nof his court with \"stately masques, brave challenges at tilt and at\r\nbarriers, and whatsoever exercises or disports they could conjecture to\r\nbe pleasing to him. Then also he first began to _keep hall_[17], and the\r\nChristmas-time was passed over with banquetings, plays, and much variety\r\nof mirth[18].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 17: To keep hall, was to keep \"open household with frank\r\nresort to court.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 18: Hayward's Life of Edward VI.]\r\n\r\nWe learn that it was an ancient custom, not only with the kings of\r\nEngland but with noblemen and \"great housekeepers who used liberal\r\nfeasting in that season,\" to appoint for the twelve days of the\r\nChristmas festival a lord of misrule, whose office it was to provide\r\ndiversions for their numerous guests. Of what nature these\r\nentertainments might be we are not exactly informed; they probably\r\ncomprised some rude attempts at dramatic representation: but the taste\r\nof an age rapidly advancing in literature and general refinement,\r\nevidently began to disdain the flat and coarse buffooneries which had\r\nformed the solace of its barbarous predecessors; and it was determined\r\nthat devices of superior elegance and ingenuity should distinguish the\r\nfestivities of the new court of Edward. Accordingly, George Ferrers, a\r\ngentleman regularly educated at Oxford, and a member of the society of\r\nLincoln's inn, was chosen to preside over the \"merry disports;\" \"who,\"\r\nsays Holinshed, \"being of better credit and estimation than commonly his\r\npredecessors had been before, received all his commissions and warrants\r\nby the name of master of the king's pastimes. Which gentleman so well\r\nsupplied his office, both in show of sundry sights and devices of rare\r\ninventions, and in act of divers interludes and matters of pastime\r\nplayed by persons, as not only satisfied the common sort, but also were\r\nvery well liked and allowed by the council, and other of skill in the\r\nlike pastimes; but best of all by the young king himself, as appeared by\r\nhis princely liberality in rewarding that service.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Monday the fourth day of January,\" pursues our chronicler, whose\r\ncircumstantial detail is sometimes picturesque and amusing, \"the said\r\nlord of merry disports came by water to London, and landing at the Tower\r\nwharf entered the Tower, then rode through Tower-street, where he was\r\nreceived by Vause, lord of misrule to John Mainard, one of the sheriffs\r\nof London, and so conducted through the city with a great company of\r\nyoung lords and gentlemen to the house of sir George Burne lord-mayor,\r\nwhere he with the chief of his company dined, and after had a great\r\nbanquet, and at his departure the lord-mayor gave him a standing cup\r\nwith a cover of silver and gilt, of the value of ten pounds, for a\r\nreward, and also set a hogshead of wine and a barrel of beer at his\r\ngate, for his train that followed him. The residue of his gentlemen and\r\nservants dined at other aldermen's houses and with the sheriffs, and\r\nthen departed to the Tower wharf again, and so to the court by water, to\r\nthe great commendation of the mayor and aldermen, and highly accepted,\r\nof the king and council.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time Ferrers became \"a composer almost by profession of\r\noccasional interludes for the diversion of the court[19].\" None of these\r\nproductions of his have come down to posterity; but their author is\r\nstill known to the student of early English poetry, as one of the\r\ncontributors to an extensive work entitled \"The Mirror for Magistrates,\"\r\nwhich will be mentioned hereafter in speaking of the works of Thomas\r\nSackville lord Buckhurst. The legends combined in this collection, which\r\ncame from the pen of Ferrers, are not distinguished by any high flights\r\nof poetic fancy, nor by a versification extremely correct or melodious.\r\nTheir merit is that of narrating after the chronicles, facts in English\r\nhistory, in a style clear, natural, and energetic, with an intermixture\r\nof political reflections conceived in a spirit of wisdom and moderation,\r\nhighly honorable to the author, and well adapted to counteract the\r\nturbulent spirit of an age in which the ambition of the high and the\r\ndiscontent of the low were alike apt to break forth into outrages\r\ndestructive of the public tranquillity.\r\n\r\n[Note 19: See Warton's History of English Poetry, vol. iii. p. 213\r\net seq.]\r\n\r\nHappy would it have been for England in more ages than one, had the\r\nsentiment of the following humble stanza been indelibly inscribed on\r\nthe hearts of children.\r\n\r\n    \"Some haply here will move a further doubt,\r\n    And as for York's part allege an elder right:\r\n    O brainless heads that so run in and out!\r\n    When length of time a state hath firmly pight,\r\n    And good accord hath put all strife to flight,\r\n      Were it not better such titles still to sleep\r\n      Than all a realm about the trial weep?\"\r\n\r\nThis estimable writer had been a member of parliament in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., and was imprisoned by that despot in 1542, very probably\r\nwithout any just cause. He about the same time translated into English\r\nthe great charter of Englishmen which had become a dead letter through\r\nthe tyranny of the Tudors; and he rendered the same public service\r\nrespecting several important statutes which existed only in Latin or\r\nNorman French; proofs of a free and courageous spirit extremely rare in\r\nthat servile age!\r\n\r\nFerrers lived far into the reign of Elizabeth, finishing his career at\r\nFlamstead in his native county of Herts in 1579.\r\n\r\nFrom the pleasing contemplation of a life devoted to those honorable\r\narts by which society is cultivated, enlightened and adorned, we must\r\nnow return to tread with Northumberland the maze of dark and crooked\r\npolitics. By many a bold and many a crafty step this adept in his art\r\nhad wound his way to the highest rank of nobility attainable by a\r\nsubject, and to a station of eminence and command scarcely compatible\r\nwith that character. But no sooner had he reached it, than a sudden\r\ncloud lowered over the splendid prospect stretched around him, and\r\nthreatened to snatch it for ever from his sight. The youthful monarch in\r\nwhom, or over whom, he reigned, was seized with a lingering disease\r\nwhich soon put on appearances indicative of a fatal termination. Under\r\nMary, the next heir, safety with insignificance was the utmost that\r\ncould be hoped by the man who had taken a principal and conspicuous part\r\nin every act of harshness towards herself, and every demonstration of\r\nhostility towards the faith which she cherished, and against whom, when\r\nhe should be no longer protected by the power which he wielded, so many\r\nlawless and rapacious acts were ready to rise up in judgement.\r\n\r\nOne scheme alone suggested itself for the preservation of his authority:\r\nit was dangerous, almost desperate; but loss of power was more dreaded\r\nby Dudley than any degree of hazard to others or himself; and he\r\nresolved at all adventures to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nBy means of the new honors which he had caused to be conferred on the\r\nmarquis of Dorset, now duke of Suffolk, he engaged this weak and\r\ninconsiderate man to give his eldest daughter, the lady Jane Grey, in\r\nmarriage to his fourth son Guildford Dudley. At the same time he\r\nprocured an union between her sister, the lady Catherine, and the eldest\r\nson of his able but mean-spirited and time-serving associate, the earl\r\nof Pembroke; and a third between his own daughter Catherine and lord\r\nHastings, son of the earl of Huntingdon by the eldest daughter and\r\nco-heir of Henry Pole lord Montacute; in whom the claims of the line of\r\nClarence now vested.\r\n\r\nThese nuptials were all celebrated on one day, and with an ostentation\r\nof magnificence and festivity which the people exclaimed against as\r\nhighly indecorous in the present dangerous state of the king's health.\r\nBut it was not on _their_ good will that Northumberland founded his\r\nhopes, and their clamors were braved or disregarded.\r\n\r\nHis next measure was to prevail upon the dying king to dispose of the\r\ncrown by will in favor of the lady Jane. The animosity against his\r\nsister Mary, to which their equal bigotry in opposite modes of faith had\r\ngiven birth in the mind of Edward, would naturally induce him to lend a\r\nwilling ear to such specious arguments as might be produced in\r\njustification of her exclusion: but that he could be brought with equal\r\nfacility to disinherit also Elizabeth, a sister whom he loved, a\r\nprincess judged in all respects worthy of a crown, and one with whose\r\nreligious profession he had every reason to be perfectly satisfied,\r\nappears an indication of a character equally cold and feeble. Much\r\nallowance, however, may be made for the extreme youth of Edward; the\r\nweakness of his sinking frame; his affection for the pious and amiable\r\nJane, his near relation and the frequent companion of his childhood; and\r\nabove all, for the importunities, the artifices, of the practised\r\nintriguers by whom his dying couch was surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Northumberland did not fail to urge, that if one of the\r\nprincesses were set aside on account of the nullification of her\r\nmother's marriage, the same ground of exclusion was valid against the\r\nother. If, on the contrary, the testamentary dispositions of the late\r\nking were to be adhered to, the lady Mary must necessarily precede her\r\nsister, and the cause of religious reformation was lost, perhaps for\r\never.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other claimants who might still be interposed between\r\nJane and the English throne, it was pretended that the Scottish branch\r\nof the royal family was put out of the question by that clause of\r\nHenry's will which placed the Suffolk line next in order to his own\r\nimmediate descendants; as if an instrument which was set aside as to\r\nseveral of its most important provisions was necessarily to be held\r\nbinding in all the rest. Even admitting this, the duchess of Suffolk\r\nherself stood before her daughter in order of succession; but a\r\nrenunciation obtained from this lady by the authority of Northumberland,\r\nnot only of her own title but of that of any future son who might be\r\nborn to her, was supposed to obviate this objection.\r\n\r\nThe right of the king, even if he had attained the age of majority, to\r\ndispose of the crown by will without the concurrence of parliament, was\r\nabsolutely denied by the first law authorities: but the power and\r\nviolence of Northumberland overruled all objections, and in the end the\r\nnew settlement received the signature of all the privy council, and the\r\nwhole bench of judges, with the exception of justice Hales, and perhaps\r\nof Cecil, then secretary of state, who afterwards affirmed that he put\r\nhis name to this instrument only as a witness to the signature of the\r\nking. Cranmer resisted for some time, but was at length won to\r\ncompliance by the tears and entreaties of Edward.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this general concurrence, it is probable that very few\r\nof the council either expected or desired that this act should be\r\nsanctioned by the acquiescence of the nation: they signed it merely as a\r\nprotection from the present effects of the anger of Northumberland, whom\r\nmost of them hated as well as feared; each privately hoping that he\r\nshould find opportunity to disavow the act of the body in time to obtain\r\nthe forgiveness of Mary, should her cause be found finally to prevail.\r\nThe selfish meanness and political profligacy of such a conduct it is\r\nneedless to stigmatize; but this was not the age of public virtue in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nA just detestation of the character of Northumberland had rendered very\r\nprevalent an idea, that the constitution of the king was undermined by\r\nslow poisons of his administering; and it was significantly remarked,\r\nthat his health had begun to decline from the period of lord Robert\r\nDudley's being placed about him as gentleman of the bed-chamber.\r\nNothing, however, could be more destitute both of truth and probability\r\nthan such a suspicion. Besides the satisfactory evidence that Edward's\r\ndisease was a pulmonary consumption, such as no poison could produce, it\r\nhas been well remarked, that if Northumberland were a sound politician,\r\nthere could be no man in England more sincerely desirous, for his own\r\nsake, of the continuance of the life and reign of this young prince. By\r\na change he had every thing to lose, and nothing to gain. Several\r\ncircumstances tend also to show that the fatal event, hastened by the\r\ntreatment of a female empiric to whom the royal patient had been very\r\nimproperly confided, came upon Northumberland at last somewhat by\r\nsurprise, and compelled him to act with a precipitation injurious to his\r\ndesigns. Several preparatory steps were yet wanting; in particular the\r\nimportant one of securing the persons of the two princesses: but this\r\nomission it seemed still possible to supply; and he ordered the death of\r\nthe king to be carefully concealed, while he wrote letters in his name\r\nrequiring the immediate attendance of his sisters on his person. With\r\nMary the stratagem had nearly succeeded: she had reached Hoddesdon on\r\nher journey to London, when secret intelligence of the truth, conveyed\r\nto her by the earl of Arundel, caused her to change her course. It was\r\nprobably a similar intimation from some friendly hand, Cecil's perhaps,\r\nwhich caused Elizabeth to disobey the summons, and remain tranquil at\r\none of her houses in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nHere she was soon after waited upon by messengers from Northumberland,\r\nwho apprized her of the accession of the lady Jane, and proposed to her\r\nto resign her own title in consideration of a sum of money, and certain\r\nlands which should be assigned her. But Elizabeth wisely and\r\ncourageously replied, that her elder sister was first to be agreed with,\r\nduring whose lifetime she, for her part, could claim no right at all.\r\nAnd determined to make common cause with Mary against their common\r\nenemies, she equipped with all speed a body of a thousand horse, at the\r\nhead of which she went forth to meet her sister on her approach to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe event quickly proved that she had taken the right part. Though the\r\ncouncil manifested their present subserviency to Northumberland by\r\nproclaiming queen Jane in the metropolis, and by issuing in her name a\r\nsummons to Mary to lay aside her pretensions to the crown, this leader\r\nwas too well practised in the arts of courts, to be the dupe of their\r\nhollow professions of attachment to a cause unsupported, as he soon\r\nperceived, by the favor of the people.\r\n\r\nThe march of Northumberland at the head of a small body of troops to\r\nresist the forces levied by Mary in Norfolk and Suffolk, was the signal\r\nfor the defection of a great majority of the council. They broke from\r\nthe kind of honorable custody in the Tower in which, from a well-founded\r\ndistrust of their intentions, Northumberland had hitherto held them; and\r\nordering Mary to be proclaimed in London, they caused the hapless Jane,\r\nafter a nominal reign of ten days, to be detained as a prisoner in that\r\nfortress which she had entered as a sovereign.\r\n\r\nNot a hand was raised, not a drop of blood was shed, in defence of this\r\npageant raised by the ambition of Dudley. Deserted by his partisans, his\r\nsoldiers and himself, the guilty wretch sought, as a last feeble\r\nresource, to make a merit of being the first man to throw up his cap in\r\nthe market-place of Cambridge, and cry \"God save queen Mary!\" But on\r\nthe following day the earl of Arundel, whom he had disgraced, and who\r\nhated him, though a little before he had professed that he could wish to\r\nspend his blood at his feet, came and arrested him in her majesty's\r\nname, and Mary, proceeding to London, seated herself without opposition\r\non the throne of her ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1553 AND 1554.\r\n\r\nMary affects attachment to Elizabeth.--Short duration of her\r\nkindness.--Earl of Devonshire liberated from the Tower.--His\r\ncharacter.--He rejects the love of Mary--shows partiality to\r\nElizabeth.--Anger of Mary.--Elizabeth retires from court.--Queen's\r\nproposed marriage unpopular.--Character of sir T.

She caused her to bear her company in her public\r\nentry into London; kindly detained her for a time near her own person;\r\nand seemed to have consigned for ever to an equitable oblivion all the\r\nmortifications and heartburnings of which the child of Anne Boleyn had\r\nbeen the innocent occasion to her in times past, and under circumstances\r\nwhich could never more return.\r\n\r\nIn the splendid procession which attended her majesty from the Tower to\r\nWhitehall previously to her coronation on October 1st 1553, the royal\r\nchariot, sumptuously covered with cloth of tissue and drawn by six\r\nhorses with trappings of the same material, was immediately followed by\r\nanother, likewise drawn by six horses and covered with cloth of silver,\r\nin which sat the princess Elizabeth and the lady Anne of Cleves, who\r\ntook place in this ceremony as the adopted sister of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these fair appearances, the rancorous feelings of\r\nMary's heart with respect to her sister were only repressed or\r\ndisguised, not eradicated; and it was not long before a new subject of\r\njealousy caused them to revive in all their pristine energy.\r\n\r\nAmongst the state prisoners committed to the Tower by Henry VIII., whose\r\nliberation his executors had resisted during the whole reign of Edward,\r\nbut whom it was Mary's first act of royalty to release and reinstate in\r\ntheir offices or honors, was Edward Courtney, son of the unfortunate\r\nmarquis of Exeter. From the age of fourteen to that of six-and-twenty,\r\nthis victim of tyranny had been doomed to expiate in a captivity which\r\nthreatened to be perpetual, the involuntary offence of inheriting\r\nthrough an attainted father the blood of the fourth Edward. To the\r\nsurprise and admiration of the court, he now issued forth a comely and\r\naccomplished gentleman; deeply versed in the literature of the age;\r\nskilled in music, and still more so in the art of painting, which had\r\nformed the chief solace of his long seclusion; and graced with that\r\npolished elegance of manners, the result, in most who possess it, of\r\nearly intercourse with the world and an assiduous imitation of the best\r\nexamples, but to a few of her favorites the free gift of nature herself.\r\nTo all his prepossessing qualities was superadded that deep romantic\r\nkind of interest with which sufferings, long, unmerited, and\r\nextraordinary, never fail to invest a youthful sufferer.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that Courtney speedily became the favorite of the\r\nnation!--what wonder that even the severe bosom of Mary herself was\r\ntouched with tenderness! With the eager zeal of the sentiment just\r\nawakened in her heart, she hastened to restore to her too amiable\r\nkinsman the title of earl of Devonshire, long hereditary in the\r\nillustrious house of Courtney, to which she added the whole of those\r\npatrimonial estates which the forfeiture of his father had vested in the\r\ncrown. She went further; she lent a propitious ear to the whispered\r\nsuggestion of her people, still secretly partial to the house of York,\r\nthat an English prince of the blood was most worthy to share the throne\r\nof an English queen. It is even affirmed that hints were designedly\r\nthrown out to the young man himself of the impression which he had made\r\nupon her heart. But Courtney generously disdained, as it appears, to\r\nbarter his affections for a crown. The youth, the talents, the graces\r\nof Elizabeth had inspired him with a preference which he was either\r\nunwilling or unable to conceal; Mary was left to vent her disappointment\r\nin resentment against the ill-fated object of her preference, and in\r\nevery demonstration of a malignant jealousy towards her innocent and\r\nunprotected rival.\r\n\r\nBy the first act of a parliament summoned immediately after the\r\ncoronation, Mary's birth had been pronounced legitimate, the marriage of\r\nher father and mother valid, and their divorce null and void. A stigma\r\nwas thus unavoidably cast on the offspring of Henry's second marriage;\r\nand no sooner had Elizabeth incurred the displeasure of her sister, than\r\nshe was made to feel how far the consequences of this new declaration of\r\nthe legislature might be made to extend. Notwithstanding the unrevoked\r\nsuccession act which rendered her next heir to the crown, she was\r\nforbidden to take place of the countess of Lenox, or the duchess of\r\nSuffolk, in the presence-chamber, and her friends were discountenanced\r\nor affronted obviously on her account. Her merit, her accomplishments,\r\nher insinuating manners, which attracted to her the admiration and\r\nattendance of the young nobility, and the favor of the nation, were so\r\nmany crimes in the eyes of a sovereign who already began to feel her own\r\nunpopularity; and Elizabeth, who was not of a spirit to endure public\r\nand unmerited slights with tameness, found it at once the most dignified\r\nand the safest course, to seek, before the end of the year, the peaceful\r\nretirement of her house of Ashridge in Buckinghamshire. It was however\r\nmade a condition of the leave of absence from court which she was\r\nobliged to solicit, that she should take with her sir Thomas Pope and\r\nsir John Gage, who were placed about her as inspectors and\r\nsuperintendants of her conduct, under the name of officers of her\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Mary to Philip of Spain was now openly talked of. It was\r\ngenerally and justly unpopular: the protestant party, whom the measures\r\nof the queen had already filled with apprehensions, saw, in her desire\r\nof connecting herself yet more closely with the most bigoted royal\r\nfamily of Europe, a confirmation of their worst forebodings; and the\r\ntyranny of the Tudors had not yet so entirely crushed the spirit of\r\nEnglishmen as to render them tamely acquiescent in the prospect of their\r\ncountry's becoming a province to Spain, subject to the sway of that\r\ndetested people whose rapacity, and violence, and unexampled cruelty,\r\nhad filled both hemispheres with groans and execrations.\r\n\r\nThe house of commons petitioned the queen against marrying a foreign\r\nprince: she replied by dissolving them in anger; and all hope of putting\r\na stop to the connexion by legal means being thus precluded, measures of\r\na more dangerous character began to be resorted to.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Wyat of Allingham Castle in Kent, son of the poet, wit, and\r\ncourtier of that name, had hitherto been distinguished by a zealous\r\nloyalty; and he is said to have been also a catholic. Though allied in\r\nblood to the Dudleys, not only had he refused to Northumberland his\r\nconcurrence in the nomination of Jane Grey, but, without waiting a\r\nmoment to see which party would prevail, he had proclaimed queen Mary in\r\nthe market-place at Maidstone, for which instance of attachment he had\r\nreceived her thanks[20]. But Wyat had been employed during several years\r\nof his life in embassies to Spain; and the intimate acquaintance which\r\nhe had thus acquired of the principles and practices of its court,\r\nfilled him with such horror of their introduction into his native\r\ncountry, that, preferring patriotism to loyalty where their claims\r\nappeared incompatible, he incited his neighbours and friends to\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\n[Note 20: See Carte's History of England.]\r\n\r\nIn the same cause sir Peter Carew, and sir Gawen his uncle, endeavoured\r\nto raise the West, but with small success; and the attempts made by the\r\nduke of Suffolk, lately pardoned and liberated, to arm his tenantry and\r\nretainers in Warwickshire and Leicestershire, proved still more futile.\r\nNotwithstanding however this want of co-operation, Wyat's rebellion wore\r\nfor some time a very formidable appearance. The London trained-bands\r\nsent out to oppose him, went over to him in a body under Bret, their\r\ncaptain; the guards, almost the only regular troops in the kingdom, were\r\nchiefly protestants, and therefore little trusted by the queen; and it\r\nwas known that the inhabitants of the metropolis, for which he was in\r\nfull march, were in their hearts inclined to his cause.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty well ascertained that the earl of Devonshire had received\r\nan invitation to join the western insurgents; and though he appeared to\r\nhave rejected the proposal, he was arbitrarily remanded to his ancient\r\nabode in the Tower.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was naturally regarded under all these circumstances of alarm\r\nwith extreme jealousy and suspicion. It was well known that her present\r\ncompliance with the religion of the court was merely prudential; that\r\nshe was the only hope of the protestant party, a party equally\r\nformidable by zeal and by numbers, and which it was resolved to crush;\r\nit was more than suspected, that though Wyat himself still professed an\r\ninviolable fidelity to the person of the reigning sovereign, and\r\nstrenuously declared the Spanish match to be the sole grievance against\r\nwhich he had taken arms, many of his partisans had been led by their\r\nreligious zeal to entertain the further view of dethroning the queen, in\r\nfavor of her sister, whom they desired to marry to the earl of\r\nDevonshire. It was not proved that the princess herself had given any\r\nencouragement to these designs; but sir James Croft, an adherent of\r\nWyat's, had lately visited Ashridge, and held conferences with some of\r\nher attendants; and it had since been rumored that she was projecting a\r\nremoval to her manor of Donnington castle in Berkshire, on the south\r\nside of the Thames, where nothing but a day's march through an open\r\ncountry would be interposed between her residence and the station of the\r\nKentish rebels.\r\n\r\nPolicy seemed now to dictate the precaution of securing her person; and\r\nthe queen addressed to her accordingly the following letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Right dear and entirely beloved sister,\r\n\r\n\"We greet you well: And whereas certain evil-disposed persons, minding\r\nmore the satisfaction of their own malicious and seditious minds than\r\ntheir duty of allegiance towards us, have of late foully spread divers\r\nlewd and untrue rumours; and by that means and other devilish practises\r\ndo travail to induce our good and loving subjects to an unnatural\r\nrebellion against God, us, and the tranquillity of our realm: We,\r\ntendering the surety of your person, which might chance to be in some\r\nperil if any sudden tumult should arise where you now be, or about\r\nDonnington, whither, as we understand, you are minded shortly to remove,\r\ndo therefore think expedient you should put yourself in good readiness,\r\nwith all convenient speed, to make your repair hither to us. Which we\r\npray you fail not to do: Assuring you, that as you may most safely\r\nremain here, so shall you be most heartily welcome to us. And of your\r\nmind herein we pray you to return answer by this messenger.\r\n\r\n\"Given under our signet at our manor of St. James's the 26th of January\r\nin the 1st year of our reign.\r\n\r\n\"Your loving sister,\r\n\r\n\"MARY, the queen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis summons found Elizabeth confined to her bed by sickness; and her\r\nofficers sent a formal statement of the fact to the privy-council,\r\npraying that the delay of her appearance at court might not, under such\r\ncircumstances, be misconstrued either with respect to her or to\r\nthemselves. Monsieur de Noailles, the French ambassador, in some papers\r\nof his, calls this \"a favorable illness\" to Elizabeth, \"since,\" adds\r\nhe, \"it seems likely to save Mary from the crime of putting her sister\r\nto death by violence.\" And true it is, that by detaining her in the\r\ncountry till the insurrection was effectually suppressed, it preserved\r\nher from any sudden act of cruelty which the violence of the alarm might\r\nhave prompted: but other and perhaps greater dangers still awaited her.\r\n\r\nA few days after the date of the foregoing letter, Wyat entered\r\nWestminster, but with a force very inadequate to his undertaking: he was\r\nrepulsed in an attack on the palace; and afterwards, finding the gates\r\nof London closed against him and seeing his followers slain, taken, or\r\nflying in all directions, he voluntarily surrendered himself to one of\r\nthe queen's officers and was conveyed to the Tower. It was immediately\r\ngiven out, that he had made a full discovery of his accomplices, and\r\nnamed amongst them the princess and the earl of Devonshire; and on this\r\npretext, for it was probably no more, three gentlemen were sent,\r\nattended by a troop horse, with peremptory orders to bring Elizabeth\r\nback with them to London.\r\n\r\nThey reached her abode at ten o'clock at night, and bursting into her\r\nsick chamber, in spite of the remonstrances of her ladies, abruptly\r\ninformed her of their errand. Affrighted at the summons, she declared\r\nhowever her entire willingness to wait upon the queen her sister, to\r\nwhom she warmly protested her loyal attachment; but she appealed to\r\ntheir own observation for the reality of her sickness, and her utter\r\ninability to quit her chamber. The gentlemen pleaded, on the other\r\nside, the urgency of their commission, and said that they had brought\r\nthe queen's litter for her conveyance. Two physicians were then called\r\nin, who gave it as their opinion that she might be removed without\r\ndanger to her life; and on the morrow her journey commenced.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Elizabeth from Ashridge was attended by the tears and\r\npassionate lamentations of her afflicted household, who naturally\r\nanticipated from such beginnings the worst that could befal her. So\r\nextreme was her sickness, aggravated doubtless by terror and dejection,\r\nthat even these stern conductors found themselves obliged to allow her\r\nno less than four nights' rest in a journey of only twenty-nine miles.\r\n\r\nBetween Highgate and London her spirits were cheered by the appearance\r\nof a number of gentlemen who rode out to meet her, as a public testimony\r\nof their sympathy and attachment; and as she proceeded, the general\r\nfeeling was further manifested by crowds of people lining the waysides,\r\nwho flocked anxiously about her litter, weeping and bewailing her aloud.\r\nA manuscript chronicle of the time describes her passage on this\r\noccasion through Smithfield and Fleet-street, in a litter open on both\r\nsides, with a hundred \"velvet coats\" after her, and a hundred others \"in\r\ncoats of fine red guarded with velvet;\" and with this train she passed\r\nthrough the queen's garden to the court.\r\n\r\nThis open countenancing of the princess by a formidable party in the\r\ncapital itself, seems to have disconcerted the plans of Mary and her\r\nadvisers; and they contented themselves for the present with detaining\r\nher in a kind of honorable custody at Whitehall. Here she underwent a\r\nstrict examination by the privy-council respecting Wyat's insurrection,\r\nand the rising in the West under Carew; but she steadfastly protested\r\nher innocence and ignorance of all such designs; and nothing coming out\r\nagainst her, in about a fortnight she was dismissed, and suffered to\r\nreturn to her own house. Her troubles, however, were as yet only\r\nbeginning. Sir William St. Low, one of her officers, was apprehended as\r\nan adherent of Wyat's; and this leader himself, who had been respited\r\nfor the purpose of working on his love of life, and leading him to\r\nbetray his confederates, was still reported to accuse the princess. An\r\nidle story was officiously circulated, of his having conveyed to her in\r\na bracelet the whole scheme of his plot; and on March 15th she was again\r\ntaken into custody and brought to Hampton-court.\r\n\r\nSoon after her arrival, it was finally announced to her by a deputation\r\nof the council, not without strong expressions of concern from several\r\nof the members, that her majesty had determined on her committal to the\r\nTower till the matter could be further investigated. Bishop Gardiner,\r\nnow a principal counsellor, and two others, came soon after, and,\r\ndismissing the princess's attendants, supplied their place with some of\r\nthe queen's, and set a guard round the palace for that night. The next\r\nday, the earl of Sussex and another lord were sent to announce to her\r\nthat a barge was in readiness for her immediate conveyance to the Tower.\r\nShe entreated first to be permitted to write to the queen; and the earl\r\nof Sussex assenting, in spite of the angry opposition of his companion,\r\nwhose name is concealed by the tenderness of his contemporaries, and\r\nundertaking to be himself the bearer of her letter, she took the\r\nopportunity to repeat her protestations of innocence and loyalty,\r\nconcluding, with an extraordinary vehemence of asseveration, in these\r\nwords: \"As for that traitor Wyat, he might peradventure write me a\r\nletter; but on my faith I never received any from him. And as for the\r\ncopy of my letter to the French king, I pray God confound me eternally,\r\nif ever I sent him word, message, token, or letter, by any means.\" With\r\nrespect to the last clause of this disavowal, it may be fit to observe,\r\nthat there is indeed no proof that Elizabeth ever returned any answer to\r\nthe letters or messages of the French king; but that it seems a\r\nwell-authenticated fact, that during some period of her adversity Henry\r\nII. made her the offer of an asylum in France. The circumstance of the\r\ndauphin's being betrothed to the queen of Scots, who claimed to precede\r\nElizabeth in the order of succession, renders the motive of this\r\ninvitation somewhat suspicious; at all events, it was one which she was\r\nnever tempted to accept.\r\n\r\nHer letter did not obtain for the princess what she sought,--an\r\ninterview with her sister; and the next day, being Palm Sunday, strict\r\norders were issued for all people to attend the churches and carry their\r\npalms; and in the mean time she was privately removed to the Tower,\r\nattended by the earl of Sussex and the other lord, three of her own\r\nladies, three of the queen's, and some of her officers. Several\r\ncharacteristic traits of her behaviour have been preserved. On reaching\r\nher melancholy place of destination, she long refused to land at\r\nTraitor's gate; and when the uncourteous nobleman declared \"that she\r\nshould not choose,\" offering her however, at the same time, his cloak to\r\nprotect her from the rain, she retained enough of her high spirit to put\r\nit from her \"with a good dash.\" As she set her foot on the ill-omened\r\nstairs, she said, \"Here landeth as true a subject, being a prisoner, as\r\never landed at these stairs; and before thee, O God! I speak it, having\r\nno other friends but thee alone.\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing a number of warders and other attendants drawn out in order,\r\nshe asked, \"What meaneth this?\" Some one answered that it was customary\r\non receiving a prisoner. \"If it be,\" said she, \"I beseech you that for\r\nmy cause they may be dismissed.\" Immediately the poor men kneeled down\r\nand prayed God to preserve her; for which action they all lost their\r\nplaces the next day.\r\n\r\nGoing a little further, she sat down on a stone to rest herself; and the\r\nlieutenant urging her to rise and come in out of the cold and wet, she\r\nanswered, \"Better sitting here than in a worse place, for God knoweth\r\nwhither you bring me.\" On hearing these words her gentleman-usher wept,\r\nfor which she reproved him; telling him he ought rather to be her\r\ncomforter, especially since she knew her own truth to be such, that no\r\nman should have cause to weep for her. Then rising, she entered the\r\nprison, and its gloomy doors were locked and bolted on her. Shocked and\r\ndismayed, but still resisting the weakness of unavailing lamentation,\r\nshe called for her book, and devoutly prayed that she might build her\r\nhouse upon the rock.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her conductors retired to concert measures for keeping her\r\nsecurely; and her firm friend, the earl of Sussex, did not neglect the\r\noccasion of reminding all whom it might concern, that the king their\r\nmaster's daughter was to be treated in no other manner than they might\r\nbe able to justify, whatever should happen hereafter; and that they were\r\nto take heed to do nothing but what their commission would bear out. To\r\nthis the others cordially assented; and having performed their office,\r\nthe two lords departed.\r\n\r\nHaving now conducted the heroine of the protestant party to the dismal\r\nabode which she was destined for a time to occupy, it will be proper to\r\nrevert to the period of Mary's accession.\r\n\r\nLittle more than eight months had yet elapsed from the death of Edward;\r\nbut this short interval had sufficed to change the whole face of the\r\nEnglish court; to alter the most important relations of the country with\r\nforeign states; and to restore in great measure the ancient religion,\r\nwhich it had been the grand object of the former reign finally and\r\ntotally to overthrow. It is the business of the historian to record the\r\nseries of public measures by which this calamitous revolution was\r\naccomplished: the humbler but not uninteresting task, of tracing its\r\neffects on the fortunes of eminent individuals, belongs to the compiler\r\nof memoirs, and forms an appropriate accompaniment to the relation of\r\nthe perils, sufferings and obloquy, through which the heiress of the\r\nEnglish crown passed on safely to the accomplishment of her high\r\ndestinies.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of the state-prisoners confined in the Tower,--an act of\r\ngrace usual on the accession of a prince,--was one which the causes of\r\ndetention of the greater part of them rendered it peculiarly gratifying\r\nto Mary to perform. The enemies of Henry's or of Edward's government she\r\nregarded with reason as her friends and partisans, and the adherents,\r\nopen or concealed, of that church establishment which was to be forced\r\nback on the reluctant consciences of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious of the captives was that aged duke of Norfolk whom\r\nthe tyrant Henry had condemned to die without a crime, and who had been\r\nsuffered to languish in confinement during the whole reign of Edward;\r\nchiefly, it is probable, because the forfeiture of his vast estates\r\nafforded a welcome supply to the exhausted treasury of the young king;\r\nthough the extensive influence of this nobleman, and the attachment for\r\nthe old religion which he was believed to cherish, had served as\r\nplausible pretexts for his detention. His high birth, his hereditary\r\nauthority, his religious predilections, were so many titles of merit in\r\nthe eyes of the new queen, who was also desirous of profiting by his\r\nabilities and long experience in all affairs civil and military. Without\r\nwaiting for the concurrence of parliament, she declared by her own\r\nauthority his attainder irregular and null, restored to him such of his\r\nlands as remained vested in the crown, and proceeded to reinstate him in\r\noffices and honors. On August 10th he took his seat at the\r\ncouncil-board of the eighth English monarch whose reign he had survived\r\nto witness; on the same day he was solemnly reinvested with the garter,\r\nof which he had been deprived on his attainder; and a few days after, he\r\nsat as lord-high-steward on the trial of that very duke of\r\nNorthumberland to whom, not long before, his friends and adherents had\r\nbeen unsuccessful suitors for his own liberation.\r\n\r\nThere is extant a remarkable order of council, dated August 27th of this\r\nyear, \"for a letter to be written to the countess of Surry to send up to\r\nMountjoy Place in London her youngest son, and the rest of her children,\r\nby the earl of Surry, where they shall be received by the duke of\r\nNorfolk their grandfather[21].\" It may be conjectured that these young\r\npeople were thus authoritatively consigned to the guardianship of the\r\nduke, for the purpose of correcting the protestant predilections in\r\nwhich they had been educated; and the circumstance seems also to\r\nindicate, what indeed might be well imagined, that little harmony or\r\nintercourse subsisted between this nobleman and a daughter-in-law whom\r\nhe had formerly sought to deprive of her husband in order to form for\r\nhim a new and more advantageous connexion.\r\n\r\n[Note 21: See Burleigh Papers by Haynes.]\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of the earl of Surry, now in the seventeenth year of his\r\nage, was honored with the title of his father; and he began his\r\ndistinguished though unfortunate career by performing, as deputy to the\r\nduke of Norfolk, the office of earl-marshal at the queen's coronation.\r\nOn the first alarm of Wyat's rebellion, the veteran duke was summoned to\r\nmarch out against him; but his measures, which otherwise promised\r\nsuccess, were completely foiled by the desertion of the London bands to\r\nthe insurgents; and the last military expedition of his life was\r\ndestined to conclude with a hasty and ignominious flight. He soon after\r\nwithdrew entirely from the fatigues of public life, and after all the\r\nvicissitudes of court and camp, palace and prison, with which the lapse\r\nof eighty eventful years had rendered him acquainted, calmly breathed\r\nhis last at his own castle of Framlingham in September 1554.\r\n\r\nThree deprived bishops were released from the Tower, and restored with\r\nhonor to their sees. These were, Tonstal of Durham, Gardiner of\r\nWinchester, and Bonner of London. Tonstal, many of whose younger years\r\nhad been spent in diplomatic missions, was distinguished in Europe by\r\nhis erudition, which had gained him the friendship and correspondence of\r\nErasmus; he was also mild, charitable, and of unblemished morals.\r\nAttached by principle to the faith of his forefathers, but loth either\r\nto incur personal hazard, or to sacrifice the almost princely emoluments\r\nof the see of Durham, he had contented himself with regularly opposing\r\nin the house of lords all the ecclesiastical innovations of Edward's\r\nreign, and as regularly giving them his concurrence when once\r\nestablished. It was not, therefore, professedly on a religious account\r\nthat he had suffered deprivation and imprisonment, but on an obscure\r\ncharge of having participated in some traitorous or rebellious design: a\r\ncharge brought against him, in the opinion of most, falsely, and\r\nthrough the corrupt procurement of Northumberland, to whose project of\r\nerecting the bishopric of Durham into a county palatine for himself, the\r\ndeprivation of Tonstal, and the abolition of the see by act of\r\nparliament, were indispensable preliminaries. This meek and amiable\r\nprelate returned to the exercise of his high functions, without a wish\r\nof revenging on the protestants, in their adversity, the painful acts of\r\ndisingenuousness which their late ascendency had forced upon him. During\r\nthe whole of Mary's reign, no person is recorded to have suffered for\r\nreligion within the limits of his diocess. The mercy which he had shown,\r\nhe afterwards most deservedly experienced. Refusing, on the accession of\r\nElizabeth, to preserve his mitre by a repetition of compliances of which\r\nso many recent examples of conscientious suffering in men of both\r\npersuasions must have rendered him ashamed, he suffered a second\r\ndeprivation; but his person was only committed to the honorable custody\r\nof archbishop Parker. By this learned and munificent prelate the\r\nacquirements and virtues of Tonstal were duly appretiated and esteemed.\r\nHe found at Lambeth a retirement suited to his age, his tastes, his\r\nfavorite pursuits; by the arguments of his friendly host he was brought\r\nto renounce several of the grosser corruptions of popery; and dying in\r\nthe year 1560, an honorable monument was erected by the primate to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWith views and sentiments how opposite did Gardiner and Bonner resume\r\nthe crosier! A deep-rooted conviction of the truth and vital importance\r\nof the religious opinions which he defends, supplies to the persecutor\r\nthe only apology of which his foolish and atrocious barbarity admits;\r\nand to men naturally mild and candid, we feel a consolation in allowing\r\nit in all its force;--but by no particle of such indulgence should\r\nBonner or Gardiner be permitted to benefit. It would be credulity, not\r\ncandor, to yield to either of these bad men the character of sincere,\r\nthough over zealous, religionists. True it is that they had subjected\r\nthemselves to the loss of their bishoprics, and to a severe\r\nimprisonment, by a refusal to give in their renunciation of certain\r\ndoctrines of the Romish church; but they had previously gone much\r\nfurther in compliance than conscience would allow to any real catholic;\r\nand they appear to have stopped short in this career only because they\r\nperceived in the council such a determination to strip them, under one\r\npretext or another, of all their preferments, as manifestly rendered\r\nfurther compliance useless. Both of them had policy enough to restrain\r\nthem, under such circumstances, from degrading their characters\r\ngratuitously, and depriving themselves of the merit of having suffered\r\nfor a faith which might soon become again predominant. They received\r\ntheir due reward in the favor of Mary, who recognised them with joy as\r\nthe fit instruments of all her bloody and tyrannical designs, to which\r\nGardiner supplied the crafty and contriving head, Bonner the vigorous\r\nand unsparing arm.\r\n\r\nThe proud wife of the protector Somerset,--who had been imprisoned, but\r\nnever brought to trial, as an accomplice in her husband's plots,--was\r\nnow dismissed to a safe insignificance. The marchioness of Exeter,\r\nagainst whom, in Henry's reign, an attainder had passed too iniquitous\r\nfor even him to carry into effect, was also rescued from her long\r\ncaptivity, and indemnified for the loss of her property by some valuable\r\ngrants from the new confiscations of the Dudleys and their adherents.\r\n\r\nThe only state prisoner to whom the door was not opened on this occasion\r\nwas Geffrey Pole, that base betrayer of his brother and his friends by\r\nwhose evidence lord Montacute and the marquis of Exeter had been brought\r\nto an untimely end. It is some satisfaction to know, that the\r\ncommutation of death for perpetual imprisonment was all the favor which\r\nthis wretch obtained from Henry; that neither Edward nor Mary broke his\r\nbonds; and that, as far as appears, his punishment ended only with his\r\nmiserable existence.\r\n\r\nNot long, however, were these dismal abodes suffered to remain\r\nunpeopled. The failure of the criminal enterprise of Northumberland\r\nfirst filled the Tower with the associates, or victims, of his guilt.\r\nNearly the whole of the Dudley family were its tenants for a longer or\r\nshorter time; and it was another remarkable coincidence of their\r\ndestinies, which Elizabeth in the after days of her power and glory\r\nmight have pleasure in recalling to her favorite Leicester, that during\r\nthe whole of her captivity in this fortress he also was included in the\r\nnumber of its melancholy inmates.\r\n\r\nThe places of Tonstal, Gardiner, and Bonner, were soon after supplied by\r\nthe more zealous of Edward's bishops, Holgate, Coverdale, Ridley, and\r\nHooper; and it was not long before the vehement Latimer and even the\r\ncautious Cranmer were added to their suffering brethren.\r\n\r\nThe queen made no difficulty of pardoning and receiving into favor those\r\nnoblemen and others, members of the privy-council, whom a base dread of\r\nthe resentment of Northumberland had driven into compliance with his\r\nmeasures in favor of Jane Grey; wisely considering, perhaps, that the\r\nmen who had submitted to be the instruments of his violent and illegal\r\nproceedings, would feel little hesitation in lending their concurrence\r\nto hers also. On this principle, the marquis of Winchester and the earls\r\nof Arundel and Pembroke were employed and distinguished; the last of\r\nthese experienced courtiers making expiation for his past errors, by\r\ncausing his son, lord Herbert, to divorce the lady Catherine Grey, to\r\nwhom it had so lately suited his political views to unite him.\r\n\r\nSir James Hales on the contrary, that conscientious and upright judge,\r\nwho alone, of all the privy-counsellors and crown-lawyers, had persisted\r\nin refusing his signature to the act by which Mary was disinherited of\r\nthe crown, found himself unrewarded and even discountenanced. The queen\r\nwell knew, what probably the judge was not inclined to deny, that it was\r\nattachment, not to her person, but to the constitution of his country,\r\nwhich had prompted his resistance to that violation of the legal order\r\nof succession; and had it even been otherwise, she would have regarded\r\nall her obligations to him as effectually cancelled by his zealous\r\nadherence to the church establishment of the preceding reign. For\r\ndaring to urge upon the grand juries whom he addressed in his circuit,\r\nthe execution of some of Edward's laws in matter of religion, yet\r\nunrepealed, judge Hales was soon after thrown into prison. He endured\r\nwith constancy the sufferings of a long and rigorous confinement,\r\naggravated by the threats and ill-treatment of a cruel jailor. At length\r\nsome persons in authority were sent to propound to him terms of release.\r\nIt is suspected that they extorted from him some concessions on the\r\npoint of religion; for immediately after their departure, retiring to\r\nhis cell, in a fit of despair he stabbed himself with his knife in\r\ndifferent parts of the body, and was only withheld by the sudden\r\nentrance of his servant from inflicting a mortal wound. Bishop Gardiner\r\nhad the barbarity to insult over the agony or distraction of a noble\r\nspirit overthrown by persecution; he even converted his solitary act\r\ninto a general reflection against protestantism, which he called \"the\r\ndoctrine of desperation.\" Some time after, Hales obtained his\r\nenlargement on payment of an arbitrary fine of six thousand pounds. But\r\nhe did not with his liberty recover his peace of mind; and after\r\nstruggling for a few months with an unconquerable melancholy, he sought\r\nand found its final cure in the waters of a pond in his garden.\r\n\r\nNo blood except of principals, was shed by Mary on account of the\r\nproclamation of Jane Grey; but she visited with lower degrees of\r\npunishment, secretly proportioned to the zeal which they had displayed\r\nin the reformation of religion, several of the more eminent partisans\r\nof this \"meek usurper.\" The three tutors of king Edward, sir Anthony\r\nCook, sir John Cheke and Dr. Cox, were sufficiently implicated in this\r\naffair to warrant their imprisonment for some time on suspicion; and all\r\nwere eager, on their release, to shelter themselves from the approaching\r\nstorm by flight.\r\n\r\nCheke, after confiscation of his estate, obtained permission to travel\r\nfor a given time on the continent. Strasburgh was selected by Cook for\r\nhis place of exile. The wise moderation of character by which this\r\nexcellent person was distinguished, seems to have preserved him from\r\ntaking any part in the angry contentions of protestant with protestant,\r\nexile with exile, by which the refugees of Strasburgh and Frankfort\r\nscandalized their brethren and afforded matter of triumph to the church\r\nof Rome. On the accession of Elizabeth he returned with alacrity to\r\nre-occupy and embellish the modest mansion of his forefathers, and\r\n\"through the loopholes of retreat\" to view with honest exultation the\r\nhigh career of public fortune run by his two illustrious sons-in-law,\r\nNicholas Bacon and William Cecil.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened views of society taken by sir Anthony led him to extend\r\nto his daughters the noblest privileges of the other sex, those which\r\nconcern the early and systematic acquisition of solid knowledge. Through\r\nhis admirable instructions their minds were stored with learning,\r\nstrengthened with principles, and formed to habits of reasoning and\r\nobservation, which rendered them the worthy partners of great statesmen,\r\nwho knew and felt their value. The fame, too, of these distinguished\r\nfemales has reflected back additional lustre on the character of a\r\nfather, who was wont to say to them in the noble confidence of\r\nunblemished integrity, \"My life is your portion, my example your\r\ninheritance.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cox was quite another manner of man. Repairing first to Strasburgh,\r\nwhere the English exiles had formed themselves into a congregation using\r\nthe liturgy of the church of England, he went thence to Frankfort,\r\nanother city of refuge to his countrymen at this period; where the\r\nintolerance of his zeal against such as more inclined to the form of\r\nworship instituted by the Genevan reformer, embarked him in a violent\r\nquarrel with John Knox, against whom, on pretext of his having libelled\r\nthe emperor, he found means to kindle the resentment of the magistrates,\r\nwho compelled him to quit the city. After this disgraceful victory over\r\na brother reformer smarting under the same scourge of persecution with\r\nhimself, he returned to Strasburgh, where he more laudably employed\r\nhimself in establishing a kind of English university.\r\n\r\nHis zeal for the church of England, his sufferings in the cause, and his\r\nservices to learning, obtained for him from Elizabeth the bishopric of\r\nEly; but neither party enjoyed from this appointment all the\r\nsatisfaction which might have been anticipated. The courage, perhaps the\r\nself opinion, of Dr. Cox, engaged him on several occasions in opposition\r\nto the measures of the queen; and his narrow and persecuting spirit\r\ninvolved him in perpetual disputes and animosities, which rendered the\r\nclose of a long life turbulent and unhappy, and took from his learning\r\nand gray hairs their due reverence. The rapacity of the courtiers, who\r\nobtained grant after grant of the lands belonging to his bishopric, was\r\nanother fruitful source to him of vexation; and he had actually tendered\r\nthe resignation of his see on very humiliating terms, when death came to\r\nhis relief in the year 1581, the eighty-second of his age.\r\n\r\nIf in this and a few other instances, the polemical zeal natural to men\r\nwho had sacrificed their worldly all for the sake of religion, was\r\nobserved to degenerate among the refugees into personal quarrels\r\ndisgraceful to themselves and injurious to their noble cause, it ought\r\non the other hand to be observed, that some of the firmest and most\r\naffectionate friendships of the age were formed amongst these companions\r\nin adversity; and that by many who attained under Elizabeth the highest\r\npreferments and distinctions, the title of fellow-exile never ceased to\r\nbe regarded as the most sacred and endearing bond of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nOther opportunities will arise of commemorating some of the more eminent\r\nof the clergy who renounced their country during the persecutions of\r\nMary; but respecting the laity, it may here be remarked, that with the\r\nexception of Catherine duchess-dowager of Suffolk, not a single person\r\nof quality was found in this list of conscientious sufferers; though one\r\npeer, probably the earl of Bedford, underwent imprisonment on a\r\nreligious account at home. Of the higher gentry, however, there were\r\nconsiderable numbers who either went and established themselves in the\r\nprotestant cities of Germany, or passed away the time in travelling.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Knowles, whose lady was niece to Anne Boleyn, took the\r\nformer part, residing with his eldest son at Frankfort; Walsingham\r\nadopted the latter. With the views of a future minister of state, he\r\nvisited in succession the principal courts of Europe, where he employed\r\nhis diligence and sagacity in laying the foundations of that intimate\r\nknowledge of their policy and resources by which he afterwards rendered\r\nhis services so important to his queen and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1554 AND 1555.\r\n\r\nArrival of Wyat and his associates at the Tower.--Savage treatment of\r\nthem.--Further instances of Mary's severity.--Duke of Suffolk\r\nbeheaded.--Death of lady Jane Grey--of Wyat, who clears Elizabeth of all\r\nshare in his designs.--Trial of Throgmorton.--Bill for the exclusion of\r\nElizabeth thrown out.--Parliament protects her rights--is\r\ndissolved.--Rigorous confinement of Elizabeth in the Tower.--She is\r\nremoved under guard of Beddingfield--carried to Richmond--offered\r\nliberty with the hand of the duke of Savoy--refuses--is carried\r\nto Ricot, thence prisoner to Woodstock.--Anecdotes of her\r\nbehaviour.--Cruelty of Gardiner towards her attendants.--Verses by\r\nHarrington.--Marriage of the queen.--Alarms of the protestants.--Arrival\r\nof cardinal Pole.--Popery restored.--Persecution begun.--King Philip\r\nprocures the liberation of state prisoners.--Earl of Devon travels into\r\nItaly--dies.--Obligation of Elizabeth to Philip discussed.--She is\r\ninvited to court--keeps her Christmas there--returns to Woodstock--is\r\nbrought again to court by Philip's intercession.--Gardiner urges her to\r\nmake submissions, but in vain.--She is brought to the queen--permitted\r\nto reside without guards at one of the royal seats--finally settled at\r\nHatfield.--Character of sir Thomas Pope.--Notice of the\r\nHarringtons.--Philip quits England.--Death of Gardiner.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now proper to return to circumstances more closely connected with\r\nthe situation of Elizabeth at this eventful period of her life.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks before her arrival in the Tower, Wyat with some of\r\nhis principal adherents had been carried thither. Towards these unhappy\r\npersons, none of those decencies of behaviour were observed which the\r\nsex and rank of Elizabeth had commanded from the ministers of her\r\nsister's severity; and Holinshed's circumstantial narrative of the\r\ncircumstances attending their committal, may be cited as an instructive\r\nexample of the fierce and brutal manners of the age.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Philip Denny received them at the bulwark, and as Wyat passed by,\r\nhe said, 'Go, traitor, there was never such a traitor in England.' To\r\nwhom sir Thomas Wyat turned and said, 'I am no traitor; I would thou\r\nshouldest well know that thou art more traitor than I; it is not the\r\npoint of an honest man to call me so.' And so went forth. When he came\r\nto the Tower gate, sir Thomas Bridges lieutenant took in through the\r\nwicket first Mantell, and said; 'Ah thou traitor! what hast thou and thy\r\ncompany wrought?' But he, holding down his head, said nothing. Then came\r\nThomas Knevet, whom master Chamberlain, gentleman-porter of the Tower,\r\ntook in. Then came Alexander Bret, (captain of the white coats,) whom\r\nsir Thomas Pope took by the bosom, saying, 'O traitor! how couldst thou\r\nfind in thy heart to work such a villainy as to take wages, and being\r\ntrusted over a band of men, to fall to her enemies, returning against\r\nher in battle?' Bret answered, 'Yea, I have offended in that case.' Then\r\ncame Thomas Cobham, whom sir Thomas Poins took in, and said; 'Alas,\r\nmaster Cobham, what wind headed you to work such treason?' And he\r\nanswered, 'O sir! I was seduced.' Then came sir Thomas Wyat, whom sir\r\nThomas Bridges took by the collar, and said; 'O thou villain! how\r\ncouldst thou find in thy heart to work such detestable treason to the\r\nqueen's majesty, who gave thee thy life and living once already,\r\nalthough thou didst before this time bear arms in the field against\r\nher?[22]... If it were not (saith he) but that the law must pass upon\r\nthee, I would stick thee through with my dagger.' To the which Wyat,\r\nholding his arms under his sides and looking grievously with a grim look\r\nupon the lieutenant, said, 'It is no mastery now;' and so passed on.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 22: It is plain that Wyat is here accused of having taken arms\r\nfor Jane Grey; but most wrongfully, if Carte's account of him is to be\r\ncredited, which there seems no reason to disbelieve.]\r\n\r\nOther circumstances attending the suppression of this rebellion mark\r\nwith equal force the stern and vindictive spirit of Mary's government,\r\nand the remaining barbarity of English customs. The inhabitants of\r\nLondon being for the most part protestants and well affected, as the\r\ndefection of their trained bands had proved, to the cause of Wyat, it\r\nwas thought expedient to admonish them of the fruits of rebellion by the\r\ngibbeting of about sixty of his followers in the most public parts of\r\nthe city. Neither were the bodies suffered to be removed till the public\r\nentry of king Philip after the royal nuptials; on which festal occasion\r\nthe streets were cleared of these noisome objects which had disgraced\r\nthem for nearly half a year.\r\n\r\nSome hundreds of the meaner rebels, to whom the queen was pleased to\r\nextend her mercy, were ordered to appear before her bound two-and-two\r\ntogether, with halters about their necks; and kneeling before her in\r\nthis guise, they received her _gracious_ pardon of all offences; but no\r\ngeneral amnesty was ever granted.\r\n\r\nThat the rash attempt of the duke of Suffolk should have been visited\r\nupon himself by capital punishment, is neither to be wondered at nor\r\ncensured; but it was a foul act of cruelty to make this the pretext for\r\ntaking away the lives of a youthful pair entirely innocent of this last\r\ndesign, and forgiven, as it was fondly hoped, for the almost involuntary\r\npart which they had taken in a former and more criminal enterprise. But\r\nreligious bigotry and political jealousy, each perhaps sufficient for\r\nthe effect, combined in this instance to urge on the relentless temper\r\nof Mary; and the lady Jane Grey and Guildford Dudley her husband were\r\nordered to prepare for the execution of the sentence which had remained\r\nsuspended over them.\r\n\r\nEvery thinking mind must have been shocked at the vengeance taken on\r\nGuildford Dudley,--a youth too insignificant, it might be thought, to\r\ncall forth the animadversion of the most apprehensive government, and\r\nguilty of nothing but having accepted, in obedience to his father's\r\npleasure, the hand of Jane Grey. But the fate of this distinguished lady\r\nherself was calculated to awaken stronger feelings. The fortitude, the\r\npiety, the genuine humility and contrition evinced by her in the last\r\nscene of an unsullied life, furnished the best evidence of her\r\nguiltlessness even of a wish to resume the sceptre which paternal\r\nauthority had once forced on her reluctant grasp; and few could witness\r\nthe piteous spectacle of her violent and untimely end, without a thrill\r\nof indignant horror, and secret imprecations against the barbarity of\r\nher unnatural kinswoman.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Devonshire was still detained in the Tower on Wyat's\r\ninformation, as was pretended, and on other indications of guilt, all of\r\nwhich were proved in the end equally fallacious: and at the time of\r\nElizabeth's removal hither this state-prison was thronged with captives\r\nof minor importance implicated in the designs of Wyat. These were\r\nassiduously plied on one hand with offers of liberty and reward, and\r\nsubjected on the other to the most rigorous treatment, the closest\r\ninterrogatories, and one of them even to the rack, in the hope of\r\neliciting from them some evidence which might reconcile to Mary's\r\nconscience, or color to the nation, the death or perpetual imprisonment\r\nof a sister whom she feared and hated.\r\n\r\nTo have brought her to criminate herself would have been better still;\r\nand no pains were spared for this purpose. A few days after her\r\ncommittal, Gardiner and other privy-councillors came to examine her\r\nrespecting the conversation which she had held with sir James Croft\r\ntouching her removal to Donnington Castle. She said, after some\r\nrecollection, that she had indeed such a place, but that she never\r\noccupied it in her life, and she did not remember that any one had moved\r\nher so to do. Then, \"to enforce the matter,\" they brought forth sir\r\nJames Croft, and Gardiner demanded what she had to say to that man? She\r\nanswered that she had little to say to him or to the rest that were in\r\nthe Tower. \"But, my lords,\" said she, \"you do examine every mean\r\nprisoner of me, wherein methinks you do me great injury. If they have\r\ndone evil and offended the queen's majesty, let them answer to it\r\naccordingly. I beseech you, my lords, join not me in this sort with any\r\nof these offenders. And concerning my going to Donnington Castle, I do\r\nremember that master Hobby and mine officers and you sir James Croft had\r\nsuch talk;--but what is that to the purpose, my lords, but that I may go\r\nto mine own houses at all times?\" The earl of Arundel kneeling down\r\nsaid, \"Your grace sayeth true, and certainly we are very sorry that we\r\nhave troubled you about so vain matter.\" She then said, \"My lords, you\r\ndo sift me very narrowly; but I am well assured you shall not do more to\r\nme than God hath appointed, and so God forgive you all.\"\r\n\r\nBefore their departure sir James Croft kneeled down before her,\r\ndeclaring that he was sorry to see the day in which he should be brought\r\nas a witness against her grace. But he added, that he had been\r\n\"marvellously tossed and examined touching her grace;\" and ended by\r\nprotesting his innocence of the crime laid to his charge[23].\r\n\r\n[Note 23: Fox's narrative in Holinshed.]\r\n\r\nWyat was at length, on April 11th, brought to his death; when he\r\nconfounded all the hopes and expectations of Elizabeth's enemies, by\r\nstrenuously and publicly asserting her entire innocence of any\r\nparticipation in his designs.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas Throgmorton was brought to the bar immediately afterwards.\r\nHis trial at length, as it has come down to us in Holinshed's Chronicle,\r\nis one of the most interesting documents of that nature extant. He was\r\nesteemed \"a deep conspirator, whose post was thought to be at London as\r\na factor, to give intelligence as well to them in the West, as to Wyat\r\nand the rest in Kent. It was believed that he gave notice to Wyat to\r\ncome forward with his power, and that the Londoners would be ready to\r\ntake his part. And that he sent a post to sir Peter Carew also, to\r\nadvance with as much speed as might be, and to bring his forces with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"He was said moreover to be the man that excited the earl of Devon to go\r\ndown into the West, and that sir James Croft and he had many times\r\nconsulted about the whole matter[24].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24: Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials.]\r\n\r\nTo these political offences, sir Nicholas added religious principles\r\nstill more heinous in the eyes of Mary. He, with two other gentlemen of\r\nhis family, had been of the number of those who attended to the stake\r\nthat noble martyr Anne Askew, burned for heresy in the latter end of\r\nHenry's reign; when they were bid to take care of their lives, for they\r\nwere all marked men. Since the accession of Mary also he had \"bemoaned\r\nto his friend sir Edward Warner, late lieutenant of the Tower, his own\r\nestate and the tyranny of the times, extending upon divers honest\r\npersons for religion, and wished it were lawful for all of each\r\nreligion to live safely according to their conscience. For the law\r\n_ex-officio_ he said would be intolerable, and the clergy discipline now\r\nmight rather be resembled to the Turkish tyranny than the teaching of\r\nthe Christian religion. Which words he was not afraid at his trial\r\nopenly to acknowledge that he had said to the said Warner[25].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 25: Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials.]\r\n\r\nThe prosecution was conducted with all the iniquity which the corrupt\r\npractice of that age admitted. Not only was the prisoner debarred the\r\nassistance of counsel on his trial, he was even refused the privilege of\r\ncalling a single witness in his favor. He defended himself however under\r\nall these disadvantages, with surprising skill, boldness and presence of\r\nmind; and he retorted with becoming spirit the brutal taunts of the\r\ncrown lawyers and judges, who disgraced themselves on the occasion by\r\nall the excesses of an unprincipled servility. Fortunately for\r\nThrogmorton, the additional clauses to the treason laws added under\r\nHenry VIII. had been abolished under his successor and were not yet\r\nre-enacted. Only the clear and equitable statute of Edward III. remained\r\ntherefore in force; and the lawyers were reduced to endeavour at such an\r\nexplanation of it as should comprehend a kind of constructive treason.\r\n\"If,\" said they, \"it be proved that the prisoner was connected with\r\nWyat, and of his counsel, the overt acts of Wyat are to be taken as his,\r\nand visited accordingly.\" But besides that no participation with Wyat\r\nafter he had taken up arms, was proved upon Throgmorton, the jury were\r\nmoved by his solemn protest against so unwarrantable a principle as that\r\nthe overt acts of one man might be charged as overt acts upon another.\r\nThey acquitted him therefore with little hesitation, to the\r\ninexpressible disappointment and indignation of the queen and her\r\nministers, who then possessed the power of making their displeasure on\r\nsuch an occasion deeply felt. The jury were immediately committed to\r\ncustody, and eight of them, who refused to confess themselves in fault,\r\nwere further imprisoned for several months and heavily fined.\r\n\r\nThe acquitted person himself, in defiance of all law and justice, was\r\nremanded to the Tower, and did not regain his liberty till the\r\ncommencement of the following year, when the intercession of king Philip\r\nobtained the liberation of almost all the prisoners there detained.\r\n\r\nThrogmorton, like all the others called in question for the late\r\ninsurrections, was closely questioned respecting Elizabeth and the earl\r\nof Devon; \"and very fain,\" we are told, \"the privy-councillors employed\r\nin this work would have got out of him something against them. For when\r\nat Throgmorton's trial, his writing containing his confession was read\r\nin open court, he prayed the queen's serjeant that was reading it to\r\nread further, 'that hereafter,' said he, 'whatsoever become of me, my\r\nwords may not be perverted and abused to the hurt of some others, and\r\nespecially against the great personages of whom I have been sundry\r\ntimes, as appears by my answers, examined. For I perceive the net was\r\nnot cast only for little fishes but for great ones[26].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 26: Strype's Memorials.]\r\n\r\nThis generous concern for the safety of Elizabeth in the midst of his\r\nown perils appears not to have been lost upon her; and under the ensuing\r\nreign we shall have the satisfaction of seeing the abilities of sir\r\nNicholas displayed in other scenes and under happier auspices.\r\n\r\nAll manifestations of popular favor towards those whom the court had\r\nproscribed and sought to ruin, were at this juncture visited with the\r\nextreme of arbitrary severity. Two merchants of London, for words\r\ninjurious to the queen, but principally for having affirmed that Wyat at\r\nhis death had cleared the lady Elizabeth and the earl of Devonshire,\r\nwere set in the pillory, to which their ears were fastened with large\r\nnails.\r\n\r\nIt was in fact an object of great importance to the catholic party to\r\nkeep up the opinion, so industriously inculcated, of the princess being\r\nimplicated in the late disturbances; since it was only on this false\r\npretext that she could be detained close prisoner in the Tower while a\r\nfatal stroke was aimed against her rights and interests.\r\n\r\nGardiner, now chancellor and prime minister, the most inveterate of\r\nElizabeth's enemies and the most devoted partisan of the Spanish\r\ninterest, thinking that all was subdued to the wishes of the court,\r\nbrought before the new parliament a bill for declaring the princess\r\nillegitimate and incapable of succeeding:--it was indignantly rejected,\r\nhowever, by a great majority; but the failure only admonished him to\r\nrenew the attack in a more indirect and covert manner. Accordingly, the\r\narticles of the marriage treaty between Mary and the prince of Spain,\r\nartfully drawn with great seeming advantage to England, had no sooner\r\nreceived the assent of the two houses, than he proposed a law for\r\nconferring upon the queen the same power enjoyed by her father; that of\r\nnaming a successor. But neither could this be obtained from a house of\r\ncommons attached for the most part to the protestant cause and the\r\nperson of the rightful heir, and justly apprehensive of the extinction\r\nof their few remaining privileges under the yoke of a detested foreign\r\ntyrant. Nobody doubted that it was the purpose of the queen, in default\r\nof immediate issue of her own, to bequeath the crown to her husband,\r\nwhose descent from a daughter of John of Gaunt had been already much\r\ninsisted on by his adherents. The bill was therefore thrown out; and the\r\nalarm excited by its introduction had caused the house to pass several\r\nspirited resolutions, one of which declared that her majesty should\r\nreign as a sole queen without any participation of her authority, while\r\nthe rest guarded in various points against the anticipated encroachments\r\nof Philip, when Mary thought good to put a stop to the further\r\ndiscussion of the subject by a prorogation of parliament.\r\n\r\nAfter these manifold disappointments, the court party was compelled to\r\ngive up, with whatever reluctance, its deep-laid plots against the\r\nunoffending princess. Her own prudence had protected her life; and the\r\nindependent spirit of a house of commons conscious of speaking the sense\r\nof the nation guarantied her succession. One only resource remained to\r\nGardiner and his faction:--they judged that a long-continued absence,\r\nwhile it gradually loosened her hold upon the affections of the people,\r\nwould afford many facilities for injuring or supplanting her; and it was\r\ndetermined soon to provide for her a kind of honorable banishment.\r\n\r\nThe confinement of the princess in the Tower had purposely been rendered\r\nas irksome and comfortless as possible. It was not till after a month's\r\nclose imprisonment, by which her health had suffered severely, that she\r\nobtained, after many difficulties, permission to walk in the royal\r\napartments; and this under the constant inspection of the constable of\r\nthe Tower and the lord-chamberlain, with the attendance of three of the\r\nqueen's women; the windows also being shut, and she not permitted to\r\nlook out at them. Afterwards she had liberty to walk in a small garden,\r\nthe gates and doors being carefully closed; and the prisoners whose\r\nrooms looked into it being at such times closely watched by their\r\nkeepers, to prevent the interchange of any word or sign with the\r\nprincess. Even a child of five years old belonging to some inferior\r\nofficer in the Tower, who was wont to cheer her by his daily visits, and\r\nto bring her flowers, was suspected of being employed as a messenger\r\nbetween her and the earl of Devonshire; and notwithstanding the innocent\r\nsimplicity of his answers to the lord-chamberlain by whom he was\r\nstrictly examined, was ordered to visit her no more. The next day the\r\nchild peeped in through a hole of the door as she walked in the garden,\r\ncrying out, \"Mistress, I can bring you no more flowers!\" for which, it\r\nseems, his father was severely chidden and ordered to keep his boy out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of her imprisonment orders had been given that the\r\nprincess should have mass regularly said in her apartment. It is\r\nprobable that Elizabeth did not feel any great repugnance to this\r\nrite:--however this might be, she at least expressed none; and by this\r\ncompliance deprived her sister of all pretext for persecuting her on a\r\nreligious ground. But some of her household were found less submissive\r\non this head, and she had the mortification of seeing Mrs. Sands, one of\r\nher ladies, carried forcibly away from her under an accusation of heresy\r\nand her place supplied by another.\r\n\r\nAll these severities failed however of their intended effect: neither\r\nsufferings nor menaces could bring the princess to acknowledge herself\r\nguilty of offending even in thought against her sovereign and sister;\r\nand as the dying asseverations of Wyat had fully acquitted her in the\r\neyes of the country, it became evident that her detention in the Tower\r\ncould not much longer be persisted in. Yet the habitual jealousy of\r\nMary's government, and the apparent danger of furnishing a head to the\r\nprotestants rendered desperate by her cruelties, forbade the entire\r\nliberation of the princess; and it was resolved to adopt as a middle\r\ncourse the expedient sanctioned by many examples in that age, of\r\ncommitting her to the care of certain persons who should be answerable\r\nfor her safe keeping, either in their own houses, or at some one of the\r\nroyal seats. Lord Williams of Thame, and sir Henry Beddingfield captain\r\nof the guard, were accordingly joined in commission for the execution of\r\nthis delicate and important trust.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate prisoner conceived neither hope nor comfort from this\r\napproaching change in her situation, nor probably was it designed that\r\nshe should; for intimidation seems still to have formed an essential\r\nfeature in the policy of her relentless enemies. Sir Henry Beddingfield\r\nentered the Tower at the head of a hundred of his men; and Elizabeth,\r\nstruck with the unexpected sight, could not forbear inquiring with\r\ndismay, whether the lady Jane's scaffold were removed? On being informed\r\nthat it was, she received some comfort, but this was not of long\r\nduration; for soon a frightful rumor reached her, that she was to be\r\ncarried away by this captain and his soldiers no one knew whither. She\r\nsent immediately for lord Chandos, constable of the Tower, whose\r\nhumanity and courtesy had led him to soften as much as possible the\r\nhardships of her situation, though at the hazard of incurring the\r\nindignation of the court; and closely questioning him, he at length\r\nplainly told her that there was no help for it, orders were given, and\r\nshe must be consigned to Beddingfield's care to be carried, as he\r\nbelieved, to Woodstock. Anxious and alarmed, she now asked of her\r\nattendants what kind of man this Beddingfield was; and whether, if the\r\nmurdering of her were secretly committed to him, his conscience would\r\nallow him to see it executed? None about her could give a satisfactory\r\nanswer, for he was a stranger to them all; but they bade her trust in\r\nGod that such wickedness should not be perpetrated against her.\r\n\r\nAt length, on May 19th, after a close imprisonment of three months, she\r\nwas brought out of the Tower under the conduct of Beddingfield and his\r\ntroop; and on the evening of the same day found herself at Richmond\r\nPalace, where her sister then kept her court. She was still treated in\r\nall respects like a captive: the manners of Beddingfield were harsh and\r\ninsolent; and such terror did she conceive from the appearances around\r\nher, that sending for her gentleman-usher, she desired him and the rest\r\nof her officers to pray for her; \"For this night,\" said she, \"I think to\r\ndie.\" The gentleman, much affected by her distress, encouraged her as\r\nwell as he was able: then going down to lord Williams, who was walking\r\nwith Beddingfield, he called him aside and implored him to tell him\r\nsincerely, whether any mischief were designed against his mistress that\r\nnight or no; \"that he and his men might take such part as God should\r\nplease to appoint.\" \"For certainly,\" added this faithful servant, \"we\r\nwill rather die than she should secretly and innocently miscarry.\"\r\n\"Marry, God forbid,\" answered Williams, \"that any such wicked purpose\r\nshould be wrought; and rather than it should be so, I with my men are\r\nready to die at her feet also.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her gloomy apprehensions, the princess was surprised by\r\nan offer from the highest quarter, of immediate liberty on condition of\r\nher accepting the hand of the duke of Savoy in marriage.\r\n\r\nOppressed, persecuted, and a prisoner, sequestered from every friend and\r\ncounsellor, guarded day and night by soldiers, and in hourly dread of\r\nsome attempt upon her life, it must have been confidently expected that\r\nthe young princess would embrace as a most joyful and fortunate\r\ndeliverance this unhoped-for proposal; and by few women, certainly,\r\nunder all the circumstances, would such expectations have been\r\nfrustrated. But the firm mind of Elizabeth was not thus to be shaken,\r\nnor her penetration deceived. She saw that it was banishment which was\r\nheld out to her in the guise of marriage; she knew that it was her\r\nreversion of an independent English crown which she was required to\r\nbarter for the matrimonial coronet of a foreign dukedom; and she felt\r\nthe proposal as what in truth it was;--an injury in disguise.\r\nFortunately for herself and her country, she had the magnanimity to\r\ndisdain the purchase of present ease and safety at a price so\r\ndisproportionate; and returning to the overture a modest but decided\r\nnegative, she prepared herself to endure with patience and resolution\r\nthe worst that her enraged and baffled enemies might dare against her.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was her refusal of the offered marriage made known, than\r\norders were given for her immediate removal into Oxfordshire. On\r\ncrossing the river at Richmond on this melancholy journey, she descried\r\non the other side \"certain of her poor servants,\" who had been\r\nrestrained from giving their attendance during her imprisonment, and\r\nwere anxiously desirous of seeing her again. \"Go to them,\" said she to\r\none of her men, \"and say these words from me, _Tanquam ovis_\" (Like a\r\nsheep to the slaughter).\r\n\r\nAs she travelled on horseback the journey occupied four days, and the\r\nslowness of her progress gave opportunity for some striking displays of\r\npopular feeling. In one place, numbers of people were seen standing by\r\nthe way-side who presented to her various little gifts; for which\r\nBeddingfield did not scruple, in his anger, to call them traitors and\r\nrebels. The bells were every where rung as she passed through the\r\nvillages, in token of joy for her liberation; but the people were soon\r\nadmonished that she was still a prisoner and in disgrace, by the orders\r\nof Beddingfield to set the ringers in the stocks.\r\n\r\nOn the third evening she arrived at Ricot, the house of lord Williams,\r\nwhere its owner, gracefully sinking the character of a watchful\r\nsuperintendant in that of a host who felt himself honored by her visit,\r\nintroduced her to a large circle of nobility and gentry whom he had\r\ninvited to bid her welcome. The severe or suspicious temper of\r\nBeddingfield took violent umbrage at the sight of such an assemblage: he\r\ncaused his soldiers to keep strict watch; insisted that none of the\r\nguests should be permitted to pass the night in the house; and asked\r\nlord Williams if he were aware of the consequences of thus entertaining\r\nthe queen's prisoner? But he made answer, that he well knew what he did,\r\nand that \"her grace might and should in his house be merry.\"\r\nIntelligence however had no sooner reached the court of the reception\r\nafforded to the princess at Ricot, than directions arrived for her\r\nimmediate removal to Woodstock. Here, under the harsher inspection of\r\nBeddingfield, she found herself once more a prisoner. No visitant was\r\npermitted to approach; the doors were closed upon her as in the Tower;\r\nand a military guard again kept watch around the walls both day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe possess many particulars relative to the captivity of Elizabeth at\r\nWoodstock. In some of them we may recognise that spirit of exaggeration\r\nwhich the anxious sympathy excited by her sufferings at the time, and\r\nthe unbounded adulation paid to her afterwards, were certain to produce;\r\nothers bear all the characters of truth and nature.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that her present residence, though less painful and\r\nespecially less opprobrious than imprisonment in the Tower, was yet a\r\nstate of rigorous constraint and jealous inspection, in which she was\r\nhaunted with cares and fears which robbed her youth of its bloom and\r\nvivacity, and her constitution of its vigor. On June 8th such was the\r\nstate of her health that two physicians were sent from the court who\r\nremained for several days in attendance on her. On their return, they\r\nperformed for their patient the friendly office of making a favorable\r\nreport of her behaviour and of the dutiful humility of her sentiments\r\ntowards her majesty, which was received, we are told, with more\r\ncomplacency by Mary than by her bishops. Soon after, she was advised by\r\nsome friend to make her peace with the queen by submissions and\r\nacknowledgements, which, with her usual constancy, she absolutely\r\nrefused, though apparently the only terms on which she could hope for\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances we may give easy belief to the touching\r\nanecdote, that \"she, hearing upon a time out of her garden at Woodstock,\r\na milkmaid singing pleasantly, wished herself a milkmaid too; saying\r\nthat her case was better, and her life merrier than hers.\"\r\n\r\nThe instances related of the severity and insolence of sir Henry\r\nBeddingfield are to be received with more distrust. We are told, that\r\nobserving a chair of state prepared for the princess in an upper chamber\r\nat lord Williams's house, he seized upon it for himself and insolently\r\nordered his boots to be pulled off in that apartment. Yet we learn from\r\nthe same authority that afterwards at Woodstock, when she seems to have\r\nbeen in his sole custody, Elizabeth having called him her jailor, on\r\nobserving him lock the gate of the garden while she was walking in it,\r\nhe fell on his knees and entreated her grace not to give him that name,\r\nfor he was appointed to be one of her officers. It has also been\r\nasserted, that on her accession to the throne she dismissed him from her\r\npresence with the speech, that she prayed God to forgive him, as she\r\ndid, and that when she had a prisoner whom she would have straitly kept\r\nand hardly used, she would send for him. But if she ever used to him\r\nwords like these, it must have been in jest; for it is known from the\r\nbest authority, that Beddingfield was frequently at the court of\r\nElizabeth, and that she once visited him on a progress. If there is any\r\ntruth in the stories told of persons of suspicious appearance lurking\r\nabout the walls of the palace, who sought to gain admittance for the\r\npurpose of taking away her life, the exact vigilance of her keeper, by\r\nwhich all access was barred, might more deserve her thanks than her\r\nreproaches.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that the princess was thus industriously secluded from\r\nconversation with any but the few attendants who had been allowed to\r\nremain about her person, her correspondence was not less watchfully\r\nrestricted. We are told, that when, after urgent application to the\r\ncouncil, she had at length been permitted to write to the queen,\r\nBeddingfield looked over her as she wrote, took the paper into his own\r\nkeeping when she paused, and brought it back to her when she chose to\r\nresume her task.\r\n\r\nYet could not his utmost precaution entirely cut off her communications\r\nwith the large and zealous party who rested upon her all their hopes of\r\nbetter times for themselves or for the country. Through the medium of a\r\nvisitor to one of her ladies, she received the satisfactory assurance\r\nthat none of the prisoners for Wyat's business had been brought to utter\r\nany thing by which she could be endangered. Perhaps it was with\r\nimmediate reference to this intelligence that she wrote with a diamond\r\non her window the homely but expressive distich,\r\n\r\n    \"Much suspected by me\r\n    Nothing proved can be,\r\n    Quoth Elizabeth prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nBut these secret intelligencers were not always fortunate enough to\r\nescape detection, of which the consequences were rendered very grievous\r\nthrough the arbitrary severity of Mary's government, and the peculiar\r\nmalice exercised by Gardiner against the adherents of the princess.\r\n\r\nSir John Harrington, son to the gentleman of the same name formerly\r\nmentioned as a follower of admiral Seymour, thus, in his _Brief View of\r\nthe Church_, sums up the character of this celebrated bishop of\r\nWinchester, with reference to this part of his conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, the plots he laid to entrap the lady Elizabeth, and his\r\nterrible hard usage of all her followers, I cannot yet scarce think of\r\nwith charity, nor write of with patience. My father, for only carrying a\r\nletter to the lady Elizabeth, and professing to wish her well, he kept\r\nin the Tower twelve months, and made him spend a thousand pounds ere he\r\ncould be free of that trouble. My mother, that then served the lady\r\nElizabeth, he caused to be sequestered from her as an heretic, insomuch\r\nthat her own father durst not take her into his house, but she was glad\r\nto sojourn with one Mr. Topcliff; so as I may say in some sort, this\r\nbishop persecuted me before I was born.\"\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth month of his imprisonment, this unfortunate Harrington,\r\nhaving previously sent to the bishop many letters and petitions for\r\nliberty without effect, had the courage to address to him a \"Sonnet,\"\r\nwhich his son has cited as \"no ill verse for those unrefined times;\" a\r\nmodest commendation of lines so spirited, which the taste of the more\r\nmodern reader, however fastidious, need not hesitate to confirm.\r\n\r\n    TO BISHOP GARDINER.\r\n\r\n    1.\r\n    \"At least withdraw your cruelty,\r\n    Or force the time to work your will;\r\n    It is too much extremity\r\n    To keep me pent in prison still,\r\n    Free from all fault, void of all cause,\r\n    Without all right, against all laws.\r\n      How can you do more cruel spite\r\n      Than proffer wrong and promise right?\r\n      Nor can accuse, nor will acquight.\r\n\r\n    2.\r\n    Eleven months past and longer space\r\n    I have abode your dev'lish drifts,\r\n    While you have sought both man and place,\r\n    And set your snares, with all your shifts,\r\n    The faultless foot to wrap in wile\r\n    With any guilt, by any guile:\r\n      And now you see that will not be,\r\n      How can you thus for shame agree\r\n      To keep him bound you should set free?\r\n\r\n    3.\r\n    Your chance was once as mine is now,\r\n    To keep this hold against your will,\r\n    And then you sware you well know how,\r\n    Though now you swerve, I know how ill.\r\n    But thus this world his course doth pass,\r\n    The priest forgets a clerk he was,\r\n      And you that have cried justice still,\r\n      And now have justice at your will,\r\n      Wrest justice wrong against all skill.\r\n\r\n    4.\r\n    But why do I thus coldly plain\r\n    As if it were my cause alone?\r\n    When cause doth each man so constrain\r\n    As England through hath cause to moan,\r\n    To see your bloody search of such\r\n    As all the earth can no way touch.\r\n       And better were that all your kind\r\n       Like hounds in hell with shame were shrined,\r\n       Than you add might unto your mind.\r\n\r\n    5.\r\n    But as the stone that strikes the wall\r\n    Sometimes bounds back on th' hurler's head,\r\n    So your foul fetch, to your foul fall\r\n    May turn, and 'noy the breast that bred.\r\n    And then, such measure as you gave\r\n    Of right and justice look to have,\r\n       If good or ill, if short or long;\r\n       If false or true, if right or wrong;\r\n       And thus, till then, I end my song.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the trials and sufferings which exercised the fortitude of\r\nElizabeth and her faithful followers during her deplorable abode at\r\nWoodstock. Mary, meanwhile, was rapt in fond anticipations of the\r\nfelicity of her married life with a prince for whom, on the sight of his\r\npicture, she is said to have conceived the most violent passion. The\r\nmore strongly her people expressed their aversion and dread of the\r\nSpanish match, the more vehemently did she show herself bent on its\r\nconclusion; and having succeeded in suppressing by force the formidable\r\nrebellion to which the first report of such an union had given birth,\r\nshe judged it unnecessary to employ any of those arts of popularity to\r\nwhich her disposition was naturally adverse, for conciliating to herself\r\nor her destined spouse the good will of her subjects. After many delays\r\nwhich severely tried her temper, the arrival of the prince of Spain at\r\nSouthampton was announced to the expecting queen, who went as far as\r\nWinchester to meet him, in which city Gardiner blessed their nuptials on\r\nJuly the 27th, 1554.\r\n\r\nThe royal pair passed in state through London a few days after, and the\r\ncity exhibited by command the outward tokens of rejoicing customary in\r\nthat age. Bonfires were kindled in the open places, tables spread in the\r\nstreets at which all passers-by might freely regale themselves with\r\nliquor: every parish sent forth its procession singing _Te Deum_; the\r\nfine cross in Cheapside was beautified and newly gilt, and pageants were\r\nset up in the principal streets. But there was little gladness of heart\r\namong the people; and one of these festal devices gave occasion to a\r\nmanifestation of the dispositions of the court respecting religion,\r\nwhich filled the citizens with grief and horror. A large picture had\r\nbeen hung over the conduit in Gracechurch street representing the nine\r\nWorthies, and among them king Henry VIII. made his appearance, according\r\nto former draughts of him, holding in his hand a book on which was\r\ninscribed \"_Verbum Dei_.\" This accompaniment gave so much offence, that\r\nGardiner sent for the painter; and after chiding him severely, ordered\r\nthat a pair of gloves should be substituted for the bible.\r\n\r\nReligion had already been restored to the state in which it remained at\r\nthe death of Henry; but this was by no means sufficient to satisfy the\r\nconscience of the queen, which required the entire restoration in all\r\nits parts, of the ancient church-establishment. It had been, in fact,\r\none of the first acts of her reign to forward to Rome a respectful\r\nembassy which conveyed to the sovereign pontiff her recognition of the\r\nsupremacy of the holy see, and a petition that he would be pleased to\r\ninvest with the character of his legate for England Cardinal Pole,--that\r\nearnest champion of her own legitimacy and the church's unity, who had\r\nbeen for so many years the object of her father's bitterest animosity.\r\n\r\nMary's precipitate zeal had received some check in this instance from\r\nthe worldly policy of the emperor Charles V., who, either entertaining\r\nsome jealousy of the influence of Pole with the queen, or at least\r\njudging it fit to secure the great point of his son's marriage before\r\nthe patience of the people of England should be proved by the arrival of\r\na papal legate, had impeded the journey of the cardinal by a detention\r\nof several weeks in his court at Brussels. But no sooner was Philip in\r\nsecure possession of his bride, than Pole was suffered to proceed on his\r\nmission. The parliament, which met early in November 1554, reversed the\r\nattainder which had laid him under sentence of death, and on the 24th of\r\nthe same month he was received at court with great solemnity, and with\r\nevery demonstration of affection on the part of his royal cousin.\r\n\r\nFrom this period the cause of popery proceeded triumphantly: a reign of\r\nterror commenced; and the government gained fresh strength and courage\r\nby every exertion of the tyrannic power which it had assumed. After the\r\nmarried clergy had been reduced to give up either their wives or their\r\nbenefices, and the protestant bishops deprived, and many of them\r\nimprisoned, without exciting any popular commotion in their behalf, the\r\ncourt became emboldened to propose in parliament a solemn reconciliation\r\nof the country to the papal see. A house of commons more obsequious than\r\nthe former acceded to the motion, and on November 29th the legate\r\nformally absolved the nation from all ecclesiastical censures, and\r\nreadmitted it within the pale of the church.\r\n\r\nThe ancient statutes against heretics were next revived; and the violent\r\ncounsels of Gardiner proving more acceptable to the queen than the\r\nmilder ones of Pole, a furious persecution was immediately set on foot.\r\nBishops Hooper and Rogers were the first victims; Saunders and Taylor,\r\ntwo eminent divines, succeeded; upon all of whom Gardiner pronounced\r\nsentence in person; after which he resigned to Bonner, his more brutal\r\nbut not more merciless colleague, the inglorious task of dragging forth\r\nto punishment the heretics of inferior note and humbler station. In the\r\nmidst however of his barbarous proceedings, of which London was the\r\nprincipal theatre, the bench of bishops thought proper in solemn\r\nassembly to declare that they had no part in such severities; and\r\nPhilip, who shrank from the odium of the very deeds most grateful to his\r\nsavage soul, caused a Spanish friar his confessor to preach before him\r\nin praise of toleration, and to show that Christians could bring no\r\nwarrant from Scripture for shedding the blood of their brethren on\r\naccount of religious differences. But justly apprehensive that so\r\nextraordinary a declaration of opinion from such a person might not of\r\nitself suffice to establish in the minds of the English that character\r\nof lenity and moderation which he found it his interest to acquire, he\r\ndetermined to add some few deeds to words.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the year 1554, sir Nicholas Throgmorton, Robert\r\nDudley, and all the other prisoners on account of the usurpation of Jane\r\nGrey or the insurrection of Wyat, were liberated, at the intercession,\r\nas was publicly declared, of king Philip; and he soon after employed his\r\ngood offices in the cause of two personages still more interesting to\r\nthe feelings of the nation,--the princess Elizabeth and the earl of\r\nDevonshire.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to estimate the value of these boasted acts of\r\ngenerosity. With regard to Courtney it may be sufficient to observe,\r\nthat a close investigation of facts had proved him to have been grateful\r\nfor the liberation extended to him by Mary on her accession, and averse\r\nfrom all schemes for disturbing her government, and that the queen's\r\nmarriage had served to banish from her mind some former grounds of\r\ndispleasure against him. Nothing but an union with Elizabeth could at\r\nthis time have rendered him formidable; and it was easy to guard\r\neffectually against the accomplishment of any such design, without the\r\nodious measure of detaining the earl in perpetual imprisonment at\r\nFotheringay Castle, whither he had been already removed from the Tower.\r\nAfter all, it was but the shadow of liberty which he was permitted to\r\nenjoy; and he found himself so beset with spies and suspicion, that a\r\nvery few months after his release he requested and obtained the royal\r\nlicense to travel. Proceeding into Italy, he shortly after ended at\r\nPadua his blameless and unfortunate career. Popular fame attributed his\r\nearly death to poison administered by the Imperialists, but probably, as\r\nin a multitude of similar cases, on no sufficient authority.\r\n\r\nAs to Elizabeth, certain writers have ascribed Philip's protection of\r\nher at this juncture to the following deduction of consequences;--that\r\nif she were taken off, and if the queen should die childless, England\r\nwould become the inheritance of the queen of Scots, now betrothed to the\r\ndauphin, and thus go to augment the power of France, already the most\r\nformidable rival of the Spanish monarchy. Admitting however that such a\r\ncalculation of remote contingencies might not be too refined to act upon\r\nthe politic brain of Philip, it is yet plainly absurd to suppose that\r\nthe life or death of Elizabeth was at this time at all the matter in\r\nquestion. Secret assassination does not appear to have been so much as\r\ndreamed of, and Mary and her council, even supposing them to have been\r\nsufficiently wicked, were certainly not audacious enough to think of\r\nbringing to the scaffold, without form of trial, without even a\r\nplausible accusation, the immediate heiress of the crown, and the hope\r\nand favorite of the nation. The only question must now have been, what\r\ndegree of liberty it would be advisable to allow her; and a due\r\nconsideration of the facts, that she had already been removed from the\r\nTower, and that after her second release, (that, namely, from\r\nWoodstock), she was never, to the end of the reign, permitted to reside\r\nin a house of her own without an inspector of her conduct, will reduce\r\nwithin very moderate limits the vaunted claims of Philip to her lasting\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nThe project of marrying the princess to the duke of Savoy had doubtless\r\noriginated with the Spanish court; and it was still persisted in by\r\nPhilip, from the double motive of providing for the head of the\r\nprotestant party in England a kind of honorable exile, and of attaching\r\nto himself by the gift of her hand, a young prince whom he favored and\r\ndestined to high employments in his service. But as severity had already\r\nbeen tried in vain to bring Elizabeth to compliance on this point, it\r\nseems now to have been determined to make experiment of opposite\r\nmeasures. The duke of Savoy, who had attended Philip to England, was\r\nstill in the country; and as he was in the prime of life and a man of\r\nmerit and talents, it appeared not unreasonable to hope that a personal\r\ninterview might incline the princess to lend a more propitious ear to\r\nhis suit. To this consideration then we are probably to ascribe the\r\ninvitation which admitted Elizabeth to share in the festivals of a\r\nChristmas celebrated by Philip and Mary at Hampton Court with great\r\nmagnificence, and which must have been that of the year 1554, because\r\nthis is well known to have been the only one passed by the Spanish\r\nprince in England.\r\n\r\nA contemporary chronicle still preserved amongst the MSS of the British\r\nMuseum, furnishes several particulars of her entertainment. On Christmas\r\neve, the great hall of the palace being illuminated with a thousand\r\nlamps artificially disposed, the king and queen supped in it; the\r\nprincess being seated at the same table, next to the cloth of estate.\r\nAfter supper she was served with a perfumed napkin and a plate of\r\n\"comfects\" by lord Paget, but retired to her ladies before the revels,\r\nmasking, and disguisings began. On St. Stephen's day she heard mattins\r\nin the queen's closet adjoining to the chapel, where she was attired in\r\na robe of white satin, strung all over with large pearls; and on\r\nDecember the 29th she sat with their majesties and the nobility at a\r\ngrand spectacle of justing, when two hundred spears were broken by\r\ncombatants of whom half were accoutered in the Almaine and half in the\r\nSpanish fashion.\r\n\r\nHow soon the princess again exchanged the splendors of a court for the\r\nmelancholy monotony of Woodstock does not appear from this document, nor\r\nfrom any other with which I am acquainted; but several circumstances\r\nmake it clear that we ought to place about this period an incident\r\nrecorded by Holinshed, and vaguely stated to have occurred soon after\r\n\"the stir of Wyat\" and the troubles of Elizabeth for that cause. A\r\nservant of the princess's had summoned a person before the magistrates\r\nfor having mentioned his lady by the contumelious appellation of a\r\n_jill_, and having made use of other disparaging language respecting\r\nher. Was it to be endured, asked the accuser, that a low fellow like\r\nthis should speak of her grace thus insolently, when the greatest\r\npersonages in the land treated her with every mark of respect? He added,\r\n\"I saw yesterday in the court that my lord cardinal Pole, meeting her in\r\nthe chamber of presence, kneeled down on his knee and kissed her hand;\r\nand I saw also, that king Philip meeting her made her such obeisance\r\nthat his knee touched the ground.\"\r\n\r\nIf this story be correct, which is not indeed vouched by the chronicler,\r\nbut which seems to bear internal evidence of genuineness, it will go far\r\nto prove that the situation of Elizabeth during her abode at Woodstock\r\nwas by no means that opprobrious captivity which it has usually been\r\nrepresented. She visited the court, it appears, occasionally, perhaps\r\nfrequently; and was greeted in public by the king himself with every\r\ndemonstration of civility and respect;--demonstrations which, whether\r\naccompanied or not by the corresponding sentiments, would surely suffice\r\nto protect her from all harsh or insolent treatment on the part of those\r\nto whom the immediate superintendance of her actions was committed.\r\n\r\nHer enemies however were still numerous and powerful; and it is certain\r\nthat she found no advocate in the heart of her sister. That able, but\r\nthoroughly profligate politician lord Paget, notwithstanding his serving\r\nthe princess with \"comfects,\" is reported to have said, that the queen\r\nwould never have peace in the country till her head were smitten off;\r\nand Gardiner never ceased to look upon her with an evil eye. Lord\r\nWilliams, it seems, had made suit that he might be permitted to take her\r\nfrom Woodstock to his own home, giving large bail for her safe keeping;\r\nand as he was a known catholic and much in favor, it was supposed at\r\nfirst that his petition would be heard; but by some secret influence the\r\nmind of Mary was indisposed to the granting of this indulgence and the\r\nproposal was dropped. But the Spanish counsellors who attended their\r\nprince never ceased, we are told, to persuade him \"that the like honor\r\nhe should never obtain as he should in delivering the lady Elizabeth\"\r\nout of her confinement: and Philip, who was now labouring earnestly at\r\nthe design, which he had entertained ever since his marriage, of\r\nprocuring himself to be crowned king of England, was himself aware of\r\nthe necessity of previously softening the prejudices of the nation by\r\nsome act of conspicuous popularity: he renewed therefore his\r\nsolicitations on this point with a zeal which rendered them effectual.\r\nThe moment indeed was favorable;--Mary, who now believed herself far\r\nadvanced in pregnancy, was too happy in her hopes to remain inflexible\r\nto the entreaties of her husband; and the privy-council, in their\r\nsanguine expectations of an heir, viewed the princess as less than\r\nformerly an object of political jealousy. And thus, by a contrariety of\r\ncause and effect by no means rare in the complicated system of human\r\naffairs, Elizabeth became indebted for present tranquillity and\r\ncomparative freedom to the concurrence of projects and expectations the\r\nmost fatal to all her hopes of future greatness.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of April, 1555, the princess took at length her final\r\ndeparture from Woodstock, and proceeded,--but still under the escort of\r\nBeddingfield and his men,--to Hampton Court. At Colnbrook she was met by\r\nher own gentlemen and yeomen to the number of sixty, \"much,\" says John\r\nFox, \"to all their comforts, which had not seen her of long season\r\nbefore, notwithstanding they were immediately commanded in the queen's\r\nname to depart the town, and she not suffered once to speak to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she reached Hampton Court, and was ushered into the\r\nprince's lodgings; but the doors were closed upon her and guarded as at\r\nWoodstock, and it was a fortnight, according to the martyrologist,\r\nbefore any one had recourse to her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time she was solaced by a visit from lord William\r\nHoward, son of the old duke of Norfolk, and first-cousin to her mother,\r\nwho \"very honorably used her,\" and through whom she requested to speak\r\nto some of the privy-council. Several of its members waited upon her in\r\nconsequence, and Gardiner among the rest, who \"humbled himself before\r\nher with all humility,\" but nevertheless seized the opportunity to urge\r\nher once more to make submission to the queen, as a necessary\r\npreliminary to the obtaining of her favor. Elizabeth, with that firmness\r\nand wisdom which had never, in her severest trials, forsaken her,\r\ndeclared that rather than do so, she would lie in prison all the days of\r\nher life; adding, that she craved no mercy at her majesty's hand, but\r\nrather the law, if ever she did offend her in thought, word, or deed.\r\n\"And besides this,\" said she, \"in yielding I should speak against\r\nmyself, and confess myself an offender, by occasion of which the king\r\nand queen might ever after conceive of me an ill opinion; and it were\r\nbetter for me to lie in prison for the truth, than to be abroad and\r\nsuspected of my prince.\" The councillors now departed, promising to\r\ndeliver her message to the queen. The next day Gardiner waited upon her\r\nagain and told her that her majesty \"marvelled she would so stoutly\r\ncarry herself, denying to have offended; so that it should seem the\r\nqueen had wrongfully imprisoned her grace:\" and that she must tell\r\nanother tale ere she had her liberty. The lady Elizabeth declared she\r\nwould stand to her former resolution, for she would never belie herself.\r\n\"Then,\" said the bishop, \"your grace hath the 'vantage of me and the\r\nother councillors for your long and wrong imprisonment.\" She took God to\r\nwitness that she sought no 'vantage against them for their so dealing\r\nwith her. Gardiner and the rest then kneeled, desiring that all might be\r\nforgotten, and so departed; she being locked up again.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the failure of this last effort of her crafty enemy\r\nto extort some concession which might afterwards be employed to\r\ncriminate her or justify himself, she received a sudden summons from the\r\nqueen, and was conducted by torch-light to the royal apartments.\r\n\r\nMary received her in her chamber, to which she had now confined herself\r\nin expectation of that joyful event which was destined never to arrive.\r\nThe princess on entering kneeled down, and protested herself a true and\r\nloyal subject, adding, that she did not doubt that her majesty would one\r\nday find her to be such, whatever different report had gone of her. The\r\nqueen expressed at first some dissatisfaction at her still persisting so\r\nstrongly in her assertions of innocence, thinking that she might take\r\noccasion to inveigh against her imprisonment as the act of injustice and\r\noppression which in truth it was; but on her sister's replying in a\r\nsubmissive manner, that it was her business to bear what the queen was\r\npleased to inflict and that she should make no complaints, she appears\r\nto have been appeased. Fox's account however is, that they parted with\r\nfew comfortable words of the queen in English, but what she said in\r\nSpanish was not known: that it was thought that king Philip was there\r\nbehind a cloth, and not seen, and that he showed himself \"a very friend\"\r\nin this business. From other accounts we learn, that Elizabeth scrupled\r\nnot the attempt to ingratiate herself with Mary at this interview by\r\nrequesting that her majesty would be pleased to send her some catholic\r\ntractates for confirmation of her faith and to counteract the doctrines\r\nwhich she had imbibed from the works of the reformers. Mary showed\r\nherself somewhat distrustful of her professions on this point, but\r\ndismissed her at length with tokens of kindness. She put upon her\r\nfinger, as a pledge of amity, a ring worth seven hundred\r\ncrowns;--mentioned that sir Thomas Pope was again appointed to reside\r\nwith her, and observing that he was already well known to her sister\r\ncommended him as a person whose prudence, humanity, and other estimable\r\nqualities, were calculated to render her new situation perfectly\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nTo what place the princess was first conveyed from this audience does\r\nnot appear, but it must have been to one of the royal seats in the\r\nneighbourhood of London, to several of which she was successively\r\nremoved during some time; after which she was permitted to establish\r\nherself permanently at the palace of Hatfield in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nFrom this auspicious interview the termination of her prisoner-state may\r\nbe dated. Henceforth she was released from the formidable parade of\r\nguards and keepers; no doors were closed, no locks were turned upon her;\r\nand though her place of residence was still prescribed, and could not,\r\napparently, be changed by her at pleasure, she was treated in all\r\nrespects as at home and mistress of her actions.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Pope was a man of worth and a gentleman; and such were the\r\ntenderness and discretion with which he exercised the delicate trust\r\nreposed in him, that the princess must soon have learned to regard him\r\nin the light of a real friend. It is not a little remarkable at the same\r\ntime, that the person selected by Mary to receive so distinguished a\r\nproof of her confidence, should have made his first appearance in public\r\nlife as the active assistant of Cromwel in the great work of the\r\ndestruction of monasteries; and that from grants of abbey lands, which\r\nthe queen esteemed it sacrilege to touch, he had derived the whole of\r\nthat wealth of which he was now employing a considerable portion in the\r\nfoundation of Trinity college Oxford.\r\n\r\nBut sir Thomas Pope, even in the execution of the arbitrary and\r\nrapacious mandates of Henry, had been advantageously distinguished\r\namongst his colleagues by the qualities of mildness and integrity; and\r\nthe circumstance of his having obtained a seat at the council-board of\r\nMary from the very commencement of her reign, proves him to have\r\nacquired some peculiar merits in her eyes. Certain it is, however, that\r\na furious zeal, whether real or pretended, for the Romish faith, was not\r\namongst his courtly arts; for though strictly enjoined to watch over the\r\ndue performance and attendance of mass in the family of the princess, he\r\nconnived at her retaining about her person many servants who were\r\nearnest protestants.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance unfortunately reached the vigilant ears of Gardiner;\r\nand it was to a last expiring effort of his indefatigable malice that\r\nElizabeth owed the mortification of seeing two gentlemen from the queen\r\narrive at Lamer, a house in Hertfordshire which she then occupied, who\r\ncarried away her favorite Mrs. Ashley and three of her maids of honor,\r\nand lodged them in the Tower.\r\n\r\nIsabella Markham, afterwards the wife of that sir John Harrington whose\r\nsufferings in the princess's service have been already adverted to, was\r\ndoubtless one of these unfortunate ladies. Elizabeth, highly to her\r\nhonor, never dismissed from remembrance the claims of such as had been\r\nfaithful to her in her adversity; she distinguished this worthy pair by\r\nmany tokens of her royal favor; stood godfather to their son, and\r\nadmitted him from his tenderest youth to a degree of affectionate\r\nintimacy little inferior to that in which she indulged the best beloved\r\nof her own relations.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of September 1555 king Philip, mortified by the refusal\r\nof his coronation, in which the parliament with steady patriotism\r\npersisted; disappointed in his hopes of an heir; and disgusted by the\r\nfondness and the jealousy of a spouse devoid of every attraction\r\npersonal and mental, quitted England for the continent, and deigned not\r\nto revisit it during a year and a half. Elizabeth might regret his\r\nabsence, as depriving her of the personal attentions of a powerful\r\nprotector; but late events had so firmly established her as next heir to\r\nthe crown, that she was now perfectly secure against the recurrence of\r\nany attempt to degrade her from her proper station; and her\r\nreconciliation with the queen, whether cordial or not, obtained for her\r\noccasional admission to the courtly circle.\r\n\r\nA few days after the king's departure we find it mentioned that \"the\r\nqueen's grace, the lady Elizabeth, and all the court, did fast from\r\nflesh to qualify them to take the Pope's jubilee and pardon granted to\r\nall out of his abundant clemency[27];\" a trait which makes it probable\r\nthat Mary was now in the habit of exacting her sister's attendance at\r\ncourt, for the purpose of witnessing with her own eyes her punctual\r\nobservance of the rites of that church to which she still believed her a\r\nreluctant conformist.\r\n\r\n[Note 27: Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials.]\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards, the death of her capital enemy, Gardiner,\r\nremoved the worst of the ill instruments who had interposed to aggravate\r\nthe suspicions of the queen, and there is reason to believe that the\r\nprincess found in various ways the beneficial effects of this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1555 TO 1558.\r\n\r\nElizabeth applies herself to classical literature.--Its neglected\r\nstate.--Progress of English poetry.--Account of Sackville and his\r\nworks.--Plan of his Mirror for Magistrates.--Extracts.--Notice of the\r\ncontributors to this collection.--Its popularity and literary\r\nmerits.--Entertainment given to Elizabeth by sir Thomas Pope.--Dudley\r\nAshton's attempt.--Elizabeth acknowledged innocent of his designs.--Her\r\nletter to the queen.--She returns to London--quits it in some disgrace\r\nafter again refusing the duke of Savoy.--Violence of Philip respecting\r\nthis match.--Mary protects her sister.--Festivities at Hatfield,\r\nEnfield, and Richmond.--King of Sweden's addresses to Elizabeth\r\nrejected.--Letter of sir T. Pope respecting her dislike of\r\nmarriage.--Proceedings of the ecclesiastical commission.--Cruel\r\ntreatment of sir John Cheke.--General decay of national\r\nprosperity.--Loss of Calais.--Death of Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the late fortunate change in her situation, Elizabeth\r\nmust have entertained an anxious sense of its remaining difficulties, if\r\nnot dangers; and the prudent circumspection of her character again, as\r\nin the latter years of her brother, dictated the expediency of shrouding\r\nherself in all the obscurity compatible with her rank and expectations.\r\nTo literature, the never failing resource of its votaries, she turned\r\nagain for solace and occupation; and claiming the assistance which\r\nAscham was proud and happy to afford her, she resumed the diligent\r\nperusal of the Greek and Latin classics.\r\n\r\nThe concerns of the college of which sir Thomas Pope was the founder\r\nlikewise engaged a portion of her thoughts; and this gentleman, in a\r\nletter to a friend, mentions that the lady Elizabeth, whom he served,\r\nand who was \"not only gracious but right learned,\" often asked him of\r\nthe course which he had devised for his scholars.\r\n\r\nClassical literature was now daily declining from the eminence on which\r\nthe two preceding sovereigns had labored to place it. The destruction of\r\nmonastic institutions, and the dispersion of libraries, with the\r\nimpoverishment of public schools and colleges through the rapacity of\r\nEdward's courtiers, had inflicted far deeper injury on the cause of\r\nlearning than the studious example of the young monarch and his chosen\r\ncompanions was able to compensate. The persecuting spirit of Mary, by\r\ndriving into exile or suspending from the exercise of their functions\r\nthe able and enlightened professors of the protestant doctrine, had\r\nrobbed the church and the universities of their brightest luminaries;\r\nand it was not under the auspices of her fierce and ignorant bigotry\r\nthat the cultivators of the elegant and humanizing arts would seek\r\nencouragement or protection. Gardiner indeed, where particular\r\nprejudices did not interfere, was inclined to favor the learned; and\r\nAscham owed to him the place of Latin secretary. Cardinal Pole also,\r\nhimself a scholar, was desirous to support, as much as present\r\ncircumstances would permit, his ancient character of a patron of\r\nscholars, and he earnestly pleaded with sir Thomas Pope to provide for\r\nthe teaching of Greek as well as Latin in his college; but sir Thomas\r\npersisted in his opinion that a Latin professorship was sufficient,\r\nconsidering the general decay of erudition in the country, which had\r\ncaused an almost total cessation of the study of the Greek language.\r\n\r\nIt was in the department of English poetry alone that any perceptible\r\nadvance was effected or prepared during this deplorable aera; and it was\r\nto the vigorous genius of one man, whose vivid personifications of\r\nabstract beings were then quite unrivalled, and have since been rarely\r\nexcelled in our language, and whose clear, copious, and forcible style\r\nof poetic narrative interested all readers, and inspired a whole school\r\nof writers who worked upon his model, that this advance is chiefly to be\r\nattributed. This benefactor to our literature was Thomas Sackville, son\r\nof sir Richard Sackville, an eminent member of queen Mary's council, and\r\nsecond-cousin to the lady Elizabeth by his paternal grandmother, who was\r\na Boleyn. The time of his birth is doubtful, some placing it in 1536,\r\nothers as early as 1527. He studied first at Oxford and afterwards at\r\nCambridge, distinguishing himself at both universities by the vivacity\r\nof his parts and the excellence of his compositions both in verse and\r\nprose. According to the custom of that age, which required that an\r\nEnglish gentleman should acquaint himself intimately with the laws of\r\nhis country before he took a seat amongst her legislators, he next\r\nentered himself of the Inner Temple, and about the last year of Mary's\r\nreign he served in parliament. But at this early period of life poetry\r\nhad more charms for Sackville than law or politics; and following the\r\nbent of his genius, he first produced \"Gorboduc,\" confessedly the\r\nearliest specimen of regular tragedy in our language; but which will be\r\nnoticed with more propriety when we reach the period of its\r\nrepresentation before queen Elizabeth. He then, about the year 1557 as\r\nis supposed, laid the plan of an extensive work to be called \"A Mirror\r\nfor Magistrates;\" of which the design is thus unfolded in a highly\r\npoetical \"Induction.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet wandering forth on a winter's evening, and taking occasion from\r\nthe various objects which \"told the cruel season,\" to muse on the\r\nmelancholy changes of human affairs, and especially on the reverses\r\nincident to greatness, suddenly encounters a \"piteous wight,\" clad all\r\nin black, who was weeping, sighing, and wringing her hands, in such\r\nlamentable guise, that\r\n\r\n    \"----never man did see\r\n    A wight but half so woe-begone as she.\"\r\n\r\nStruck with grief and horror at the view, he earnestly requires her to\r\n\"unwrap\" her woes, and inform him who and whence she is, since her\r\nanguish, if not relieved, must soon put an end to her life. She answers,\r\n\r\n    \"Sorrow am I, in endless torments pained\r\n    Among the furies in th' infernal lake:\"\r\n\r\nfrom these dismal regions she is come, she says, to bemoan the luckless\r\nlot of those\r\n\r\n    \"Whom Fortune in this maze of misery,\r\n    Of wretched chance most woful Mirrors chose:\"\r\n\r\nand she ends by inviting him to accompany her in her return:\r\n\r\n    \"Come, come, quoth she, and see what I shall show,\r\n    Come hear the plaining and the bitter bale\r\n    Of worthy men by Fortune's overthrow:\r\n    Come thou and see them ruing all in row.\r\n    They were but shades that erst in mind thou rolled,\r\n    Come, come with me, thine eyes shall then behold.\"\r\n\r\nHe accepts the invitation, having first done homage to Sorrow as to a\r\ngoddess, since she had been able to read his thought. The scenery and\r\npersonages are now chiefly copied from the sixth book of the AEneid; but\r\nwith the addition of many highly picturesque and original touches.\r\n\r\nThe companions enter, hand in hand, a gloomy wood, through which Sorrow\r\nonly could have found the way.\r\n\r\n    \"But lo, while thus amid the desert dark\r\n    We passed on with steps and pace unmeet,\r\n    A rumbling roar, confused with howl and bark\r\n    Of dogs, shook all the ground beneath our feet,\r\n    And struck the din within our ears so deep,\r\n    As half distraught unto the ground I fell;\r\n    Besought return, and not to visit hell.\"\r\n\r\nHis guide however encourages him, and they proceed by the \"lothly lake\"\r\nAvernus,\r\n\r\n    \"In dreadful fear amid the dreadful place.\"\r\n\r\n    \"And first within the porch and jaws of hell\r\n    Sat deep Remorse of Conscience, all besprent\r\n    With tears; and to herself oft would she tell\r\n    Her wretchedness, and cursing never stent\r\n    To sob and sigh: but ever thus lament\r\n    With thoughtful care, as she that all in vain\r\n    Should wear and waste continually in pain.\r\n\r\n    Her eyes, unsteadfast rolling here and there,\r\n    Whirled on each place as place that vengeance brought,\r\n    So was her mind continually in fear,\r\n    Tossed and tormented with tedious thought\r\n    Of those detested crimes that she had wrought:\r\n    With dreadful cheer and looks thrown to the sky,\r\n    Longing for death, and yet she could not die.\r\n\r\n    Next saw we Dread, all trembling how he shook\r\n    With foot uncertain proffered here and there,\r\n    Benumbed of speech, and with a ghastly look\r\n    Searched every place, all pale and dead with fear,\r\n    His cap borne up with staring of his hair.\" &c.\r\n\r\nAll the other allegorical personages named, and only named, by Virgil,\r\nas well as a few additional ones, are pourtrayed in succession, and with\r\nthe same strength and fullness of delineation; but with the exception of\r\nWar, who appears in the attributes of Mars, they are represented simply\r\nas _examples_ of Old age, Malady, &c., not as the _agents_ by whom these\r\nevils are inflicted upon others. Cerberus and Charon occur in their\r\nappropriate offices, but the monstrous forms Gorgon, Chimaera, &c., are\r\njudiciously suppressed; and the poet is speedily conducted to the banks\r\nof that \"main broad flood\"\r\n\r\n    \"Which parts the gladsome fields from place of woe.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With Sorrow for my guide, as there I stood,\r\n    A troop of men the most in arms bedight,\r\n    In tumult clustered 'bout both sides the flood:\r\n    'Mongst whom, who were ordained t' eternal night,\r\n    Or who to blissful peace and sweet delight,\r\n    I wot not well, it seemed that they were all\r\n    Such as by death's untimely stroke did fall.\"\r\n\r\nSorrow acquaints him that these are all illustrious examples of the\r\nreverses which he was lately deploring, who will themselves relate to\r\nhim their misfortunes; and that he must afterwards\r\n\r\n    \"Recount the same to Kesar, king and peer.\"\r\n\r\nThe first whom he sees advancing towards him from the throng of ghosts\r\nis Henry duke of Buckingham, put to death under Richard III.: and his\r\n\"Legend,\" or story, is unfortunately the only one which its author ever\r\nfound leisure to complete; the favor of his illustrious kinswoman on her\r\naccession causing him to sink the poet in the courtier, the ambassador,\r\nand finally the minister of state. But he had already done enough to\r\nearn himself a lasting name amongst the improvers of poetry in England.\r\nIn tragedy he gave the first regular model; in personification he\r\nadvanced far beyond all his predecessors, and furnished a prototype to\r\nthat master of allegory, Spenser. A greater than Spenser has also been\r\nindebted to him; as will be evident, I think, to all who compare the\r\ndescription of the figures on the shield of war in his Induction, and\r\nespecially those of them which relate to the siege of Troy, with the\r\nexquisitely rich and vivid description of a picture on that subject in\r\nShakespeare's early poem on Tarquin and Lucretia.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the duke of Buckingham is composed in a style rich, free\r\nand forcible; the examples brought from ancient history, of the\r\nsuspicion and inward wretchedness to which tyrants have ever been a\r\nprey, and afterwards, of the instability of popular favor, might in this\r\nage be accounted tedious and pedantic; they are however pertinent, well\r\nrecited, and doubtless possessed the charm of novelty with respect to\r\nthe majority of contemporary readers. The curses which the unhappy duke\r\npours forth against the dependent who had betrayed him, may almost\r\ncompare, in the energy and inventiveness of malice, with those of\r\nShakespeare's queen Margaret; but they lose their effect by being thrown\r\ninto the form of monologue and ascribed to a departed spirit, whose\r\nagonies of grief and rage in reciting his own death have something in\r\nthem bordering on the burlesque.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Sackville was deeply fraught, as we have seen, with classic\r\nstores; and at a time when England possessed as yet no complete\r\ntranslation of Virgil, he might justly regard it as a considerable\r\nservice to the cause of national taste to transplant into our vernacular\r\npoetry some scattered flowers from his rich garden of poetic sweets.\r\nThus he has embellished his legend with an imitation or rather\r\nparaphrase of the celebrated description of night in the fourth book of\r\nthe AEneid. The lines well merit transcription.\r\n\r\n    \"Midnight was come, when ev'ry vital thing\r\n    With sweet sound sleep their weary limbs did rest;\r\n    The beasts were still, the little birds that sing\r\n    Now sweetly slept besides their mother's breast,\r\n    The old and all were shrowded in their nest;\r\n    The waters calm, the cruel seas did cease;\r\n    The woods, the fields, and all things held their peace.\r\n\r\n    The golden stars were whirled amid their race,\r\n    And on the earth did laugh with twinkling light,\r\n    When each thing nestled in his resting place\r\n    Forgat day's pain with pleasure of the night:\r\n    The hare had not the greedy hounds in sight;\r\n    The fearful deer had not the dogs in doubt,\r\n    The partridge dreamt not of the falcon's foot.\r\n\r\n    The ugly bear now minded not the stake,\r\n    Nor how the cruel mastives do him tear;\r\n    The stag lay still unroused from the brake;\r\n    The foamy boar feared not the hunter's spear:\r\n    All things were still in desert, bush and breer.\r\n    With quiet heart now from their travails ceast\r\n    Soundly they slept in midst of all their rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion to bear-bating in the concluding stanza may offend the\r\ndelicacy of a modern reader; but let it be remembered that in the days\r\nof Mary, and even of Elizabeth, this amusement was accounted \"sport for\r\nladies.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Mirror for Magistrates\" was not lost to the world by the desertion\r\nof Sackville from the service of the muses; for a similar or rather\r\nperhaps the same design was entertained, and soon after carried into\r\nexecution, by other and able though certainly inferior hands.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Mary,--but whether before or after the composition\r\nof Sackville's Induction does not appear,--a certain printer, having\r\ncommunicated to several \"worshipful and honorable persons\" his\r\nintention of republishing Lydgate's translation in verse of Boccacio's\r\n\"Fall of Princes,\" was by them advised to procure a continuation of the\r\nwork, chiefly in English examples; and he applied in consequence to\r\nBaldwyne, an ecclesiastic and graduate of Oxford. Baldwyne declined to\r\nembark alone in so vast a design, and one, as he thought, so little\r\nlikely to prove profitable; but seven other contemporary poets, of whom\r\nGeorge Ferrers has already been mentioned as one, having promised their\r\nassistance, he consented to assume the editorship of the work. The\r\ngeneral frame agreed upon by these associates was that employed in the\r\noriginal work of Boccacio, who feigned, that a party of friends being\r\nassembled, it was determined that each of them should contribute to the\r\npleasure of the company by personating some illustrious and unfortunate\r\ncharacter, and relating his adventures in the first person. A\r\ncontrivance so tame and meagre compared with the descent to the regions\r\nof the dead sketched with so much spirit by Sackville, that it must have\r\npreceded, in all probability, their knowledge at least of his\r\nperformance. The first part of the work, almost entirely by Baldwyne,\r\nwas written, and partly printed, in Mary's time, but its publication was\r\nprevented by the interference of the lord-chancellor,--a trait of the\r\nmean and cowardly jealousy of the administration, which speaks volumes.\r\nIn the first year of Elizabeth lord Stafford, an enlightened patron of\r\nletters, procured a licence for its appearance. A second part soon\r\nfollowed, in which Sackville's Induction and Legend were inserted. The\r\nsuccess of this collection was prodigious; edition after edition was\r\ngiven to the public under the inspection of different poetical revisers,\r\nby each of whom copious additions were made to the original work. Its\r\nfavor and reputation continued during all the reign of Elizabeth, and\r\nfar into that of James; for Mr. Warton tells us that in Chapman's\r\n\"May-day,\" printed in 1611, \"a gentleman of the most elegant taste for\r\nreading and highly accomplished in the current books of the times, is\r\ncalled 'one that has read Marcus Aurelius, Gesta Romanorum, and the\r\nMirror of Magistrates.'[28]\"\r\n\r\n[Note 28: History of English Poetry, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the contributors to this work were lawyers; an order\r\nof men who, in most ages and nations, have accounted it a part of\r\nprofessional duty to stand in opposition to popular seditions on one\r\nhand, and to the violent and illegal exertion of arbitrary power on the\r\nother. Accordingly, many of the legends are made to exemplify the evils\r\nof both these excesses; and though, in more places than one, the\r\nunlawfulness, on any provocation, of lifting a hand against \"the Lord's\r\nanointed\" is in strong terms asserted, the deposition of tyrants is\r\noften recorded with applause; and no mercy is shown to the corrupt judge\r\nor minister who wrests law and justice in compliance with the wicked\r\nwill of his prince.\r\n\r\nThe newly published chronicles of the wars of York and Lancaster by\r\nHall, a writer who made some approach to the character of a genuine\r\nhistorian, furnished facts to the first composers of the Mirror; the\r\nlater ones might draw also from Holinshed and Stow. There is some\r\nprobability that the idea of forming plays on English history was\r\nsuggested to Shakespeare by the earlier of these legends; and it is\r\ncertain that his plays, in their turn, furnished some of their brightest\r\nornaments of sentiment and diction to the legends added by later\r\neditors.\r\n\r\nTo a modern reader, the greater part of these once admired pieces will\r\nappear trite, prosaic, and tedious; but an uncultivated age--like the\r\nchildren and the common people of all ages--is most attracted and\r\nimpressed by that mode of narration which leaves the least to be\r\nsupplied by the imagination of the hearer or reader; and when this\r\ncollection of history in verse is compared, not with the finished labors\r\nof a Hume or a Robertson, but with the prolix and vulgar narratives of\r\nthe chroniclers, the admiration and delight with which it was received\r\nwill no longer surprise.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance more respecting a work so important by the quantity of\r\nhistorical knowledge which it diffused among the mass of readers, and\r\nthe influence which it exerted over the public mind during half a\r\ncentury, deserves to be here adverted to. Baldwyne and his\r\nfellow-laborers began their series from the Norman conquest, and the\r\nsame starting-point had been judiciously chosen by Sackville; but the\r\nfabulous history of Geffrey of Monmouth still found such powerful\r\nadvocates in national vanity, ignorance and credulity, that succeeding\r\neditors found it convenient to embellish their work with moral examples\r\ndrawn from his fictitious series of British kings before the invasion of\r\nthe Romans. Accordingly they have brought forward a long line of\r\nworthies, beginning with king Albanact, son of Brute the Trojan, and\r\nending with Cadwallader the last king of the Britons, scarcely one of\r\nwhom, excepting the renowned prince Arthur, is known even by name to the\r\npresent race of students in English history; though amongst poetical\r\nreaders, the immortal verse of Spenser preserves some recollection that\r\nsuch characters once were fabled. In return for this superfluity, our\r\nSaxon line of kings is passed over with very little notice, only three\r\nlegends, and those of very obscure personages, being interposed between\r\nCadwallader and king Harold. The descent of the royal race of Britain\r\nfrom the Trojans was at this period more than an article of poetical\r\nfaith; it was maintained, or rather taken for granted, by the gravest\r\nand most learned writers. One Kelston, who dedicated a versified\r\nchronicle of the Brutes to Edward VI., went further still, and traced up\r\nthe pedigree of his majesty through two-and-thirty generations, to\r\nOsiris king of Egypt. Troynovant, the name said to have been given to\r\nLondon by Brute its founder, was frequently employed in verse. A song\r\naddressed to Elizabeth entitles her the \"beauteous queen of second\r\nTroy;\" and in describing the pageants which celebrated her entrance into\r\nthe provincial capitals which she visited in her progresses, it will\r\nfrequently be necessary to introduce to the reader personages of the\r\nancient race of this fabled conqueror of our island, who claimed for\r\nhis direct ancestor,--but whether in the third or fourth degree authors\r\ndiffer,--no less a hero than the pious AEneas himself.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the personal circumstances of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe public and splendid celebration of the festivals of the church was\r\nthe least reprehensible of the measures employed by Mary for restoring\r\nthe ascendancy of her religion over the minds of her subjects. She had\r\nbeen profuse in her donations of sacred vestments and ornaments to the\r\nchurches and the monasteries, of which she had restored several; and\r\nthese gaudy trappings of a ceremonial worship were exhibited, rather\r\nindeed to the scandal than the edification of a dejected people, in\r\nfrequent processions conducted with the utmost solemnity and\r\nmagnificence. Court entertainments always accompanied these devotional\r\nceremonies, and Elizabeth seems by assisting at the latter to have\r\npurchased admission to the former. The Christmas festivities in which\r\nshe shared have already been described in the words of a contemporary\r\nchronicler; and from the same source we derive the following account of\r\nthe \"antique pageantries\" with which another season of rejoicing was\r\ncelebrated for her recreation, by the munificence of the indulgent\r\nsuperintendent of her conduct and affairs. \"In Shrove-tide 1556, sir\r\nThomas Pope made for the lady Elizabeth, all at his own costs, a great\r\nand rich masking in the great hall at Hatfield, where the pageants were\r\nmarvellously furnished. There were there twelve minstrels anticly\r\ndisguised; with forty six or more gentlemen and ladies, many of them\r\nknights or nobles, and ladies of honor, apparelled in crimson sattin,\r\nembroidered upon with wreaths of gold, and garnished with borders of\r\nhanging pearl. And the devise of a castle of cloth of gold, set with\r\npomegranates about the battlements, with shields of knights hanging\r\ntherefrom; and six knights in rich harness tourneyed. At night the\r\ncupboard in the hall was of twelve stages mainly furnished with garnish\r\nof gold and silver vessul, and a banquet of seventy dishes, and after a\r\nvoidee of spices and suttleties with thirty six spice-plates; all at the\r\ncharges of sir Thomas Pope. And the next day the play of Holophernes.\r\nBut the queen percase misliked these folleries as by her letters to sir\r\nThomas it did appear; and so their disguisings ceased[29].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 29: See Nichols's \"Progresses,\" vol. i. p. 19.]\r\n\r\nA circumstance soon afterwards occurred calculated to recall past\r\ndangers to the mind of the princess, and perhaps to disturb her with\r\napprehensions of their recurrence.\r\n\r\nDudley Ashton, formerly a partisan of Wyat, had escaped into France,\r\nafter the defeat and capture of his leader, whence he was still plotting\r\nthe overthrow of Mary's government. By the connivance or assistance of\r\nthat court, now on the brink of war with England, he was at length\r\nenabled to send over one Cleberry, a condemned person, whom he\r\ninstructed to counterfeit the earl of Devonshire, and endeavour to raise\r\nthe country in his cause. Letters and proclamations were at the same\r\ntime dispersed by Ashton, in which the name of Elizabeth was employed\r\nwithout scruple. The party had even the slanderous audacity to pretend,\r\nthat between Courtney and the heiress of the crown the closest of all\r\nintimacies, if not an actual marriage, subsisted; and the matter went so\r\nfar that at Ipswich, one of the strong holds of protestantism, Cleberry\r\nproclaimed the earl of Devonshire and the princess, king and queen. But\r\nthe times were past when any advantage could be taken of this\r\ncircumstance against Elizabeth, whose perfect innocence was well known\r\nto the government; and the council immediately wrote in handsome terms\r\nto sir Thomas Pope, directing him to acquaint her, in whatever manner he\r\nshould judge best, with the abominable falsehoods circulated respecting\r\nher. A few days after, the queen herself wrote also to her sister in\r\nterms fitted to assure her of perfect safety. The princess replied, says\r\nStrype, \"in a well penned letter,\" \"utterly detesting and disclaiming\r\nall concern in the enterprise, and declaiming against the actors in it.\"\r\nOf the epistle thus commended, a single paragraph will probably be\r\nesteemed a sufficient specimen.... \"And among earthly things I chiefly\r\nwish this one; that there were as good surgeons for making anatomies of\r\nhearts, that might show my thoughts to your majesty, as there are expert\r\nphysicians of the bodies, able to express the inward griefs of their\r\nmaladies to the patient. For then I doubt not, but know well, that\r\nwhatsoever others should suggest by malice, yet your majesty should be\r\nsure by knowledge; so that the more such misty clouds offuscate the\r\nclear light of my truth, the more my tried thoughts should glister to\r\nthe dimming of their hidden malice.\" &c. It must be confessed that this\r\nerudite princess had not perfectly succeeded in transplanting into her\r\nown language the epistolary graces of her favorite Cicero;--but to how\r\nmany much superior classical scholars might a similar remark be applied!\r\n\r\nThe frustration of Mary's hope of becoming a mother, her subsequent ill\r\nstate of health, and the resolute refusal of the parliament to permit\r\nthe coronation of her husband, who had quitted England in disgust to\r\nattend his affairs on the continent, conferred, in spite of all the\r\nefforts of the catholic party, a daily augmenting importance on\r\nElizabeth. When therefore in November 1556 she had come in state to\r\nSomerset Place, her town-residence, to take up her abode for the winter,\r\na kind of court was immediately formed around her; and she might hope to\r\nbe richly indemnified for any late anxieties or privations, by the\r\nbrilliant festivities, the respectful observances, and the still more\r\nwelcome flatteries, of which she found herself the distinguished\r\nobject:--But disappointment awaited her.\r\n\r\nShe had been invited to court for the purpose of receiving a second and\r\nmore solemn offer of the hand of the duke of Savoy, whose suit was\r\nenforced by the king her brother-in-law with the whole weight of his\r\ninfluence or authority. This alliance had been the subject of earnest\r\ncorrespondence between Philip and the English council; the Imperial\r\nambassadors were waiting in England for her answer; and the\r\ndisappointment of the high-raised hopes of the royal party, by her\r\nreiteration of a decided negative, was followed by her quitting London\r\nin a kind of disgrace early in the month of December.\r\n\r\nBut Philip would not suffer the business to end here. Indignant at the\r\nresistance opposed by the princess to his measures, he seems to have\r\nurged the queen to interfere in a manner authoritative enough to compel\r\nobedience; but, by a remarkable exchange of characters, Mary now\r\nappeared as the protectress of her sister from the violence of Philip.\r\n\r\nIn a letter still preserved, she tells him, that unless the consent of\r\nparliament were first obtained, she fears that the accomplishment of the\r\nmarriage would fail to procure for him the advantages which he expected;\r\nbut that, however this might be, her conscience would not allow her to\r\npress the matter further. That the friar Alphonso, Philip's confessor,\r\nwhom he had sent to argue the point with her, had entirely failed of\r\nconvincing her; that in fact she could not comprehend the drift of his\r\narguments. Philip, it is manifest, must already have made use of very\r\nharsh language towards the queen respecting her conduct in this affair,\r\nfor she deprecates his further displeasure in very abject terms; but yet\r\npersists in her resolution with laudable firmness. Her husband was so\r\nfar, however, from yielding with a good grace a point on which he had\r\ncertainly no right to dictate either to Mary or to her sister, that soon\r\nafterwards he sent into England the duchesses of Parma and Lorrain for\r\nthe purpose of conducting the princess into Flanders:--but this step was\r\nill-judged. His coldness and neglect had by this time nearly\r\nextinguished the fond passion of the queen, who is said to have torn his\r\npicture in a fit of rage, on report of some disrespectful language which\r\nhe had used concerning her since his departure for the continent.\r\nResentment and jealousy now divided her gloomy soul; and Philip's\r\nbehaviour, on which she had doubtless her spies, caused her to regard\r\nthe duchess of Lorrain as the usurper of his heart. The extraordinary\r\ncircumstances of pomp and parade with which this lady, notwithstanding\r\nthe smallness of her revenues, now appeared in England, confirmed and\r\naggravated her most painful suspicions; and so far from favoring the\r\nsuit urged by such an ambassadress, Mary became more than ever\r\ndetermined on thwarting it. She would not permit the duchesses to pay\r\nthe princess a single visit at Hatfield; and her reception gave them so\r\nlittle encouragement to persevere, that they speedily returned to report\r\ntheir failure to him who sent them.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances seem to have produced a cordiality of feeling and\r\nfrequency of intercourse between the sisters which had never before\r\nexisted. In February 1557 the princess arrived with a great retinue at\r\nSomerset Place, and went thence to wait upon the queen at Whitehall; and\r\nwhen the spring was somewhat further advanced, her majesty honored her\r\nby returning the visit at Hatfield. The royal guest was, of course, to\r\nbe entertained with every species of courtly and elegant delight; and\r\naccordingly, on the morning after her arrival, she and the princess,\r\nafter attending mass, went to witness a grand exhibition of\r\n_bear-bating_, \"with which their highnesses were right well content.\" In\r\nthe evening the chamber was adorned with a sumptuous suit of tapestry,\r\ncalled, but from what circumstance does not appear, \"the hangings of\r\nAntioch.\" After supper a play was represented by the choristers of St.\r\nPaul's, then the most applauded actors in London; and after it was over,\r\none of the children accompanied with his voice the performance of the\r\nprincess on the virginals.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Pope could now without offence gratify his lady with another\r\nshow, devised by him in that spirit of romantic magnificence equally\r\nagreeable to the taste of the age and the temper of Elizabeth herself.\r\nShe was invited to repair to Enfield Chase to take the amusement of\r\nhunting the hart. Twelve ladies in white satin attended her on their\r\n\"ambling palfreys,\" and twenty yeomen clad in green. At the entrance of\r\nthe forest she was met by fifty archers in scarlet boots and yellow\r\ncaps, armed with gilded bows, one of whom presented to her a\r\nsilver-headed arrow winged with peacock's feathers. The splendid show\r\nconcluded, according to the established laws of the chase, by the\r\noffering of the knife to the princess, as first lady on the field; and\r\nher _taking 'say_ of the buck with her own fair and royal hand.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of the same year the queen was pleased to invite her\r\nsister to an entertainment at Richmond, of which we have received some\r\nrather interesting particulars. The princess was brought from Somerset\r\nPlace in the queen's barge, which was richly hung with garlands of\r\nartificial flowers and covered with a canopy of green sarcenet, wrought\r\nwith branches of eglantine in embroidery and powdered with blossoms of\r\ngold. In the barge she was accompanied by sir Thomas Pope and four\r\nladies of her chamber. Six boats attended filled with her retinue,\r\nhabited in russet damask and blue embroidered satin, tasseled and\r\nspangled with silver; their bonnets cloth of silver with green feathers.\r\nThe queen received her in a sumptuous pavilion in the labyrinth of the\r\ngardens. This pavilion, which was of cloth of gold and purple velvet,\r\nwas made in the form of a castle, probably in allusion to the kingdom of\r\nCastile; its sides were divided in compartments, which bore alternately\r\nthe fleur de lis in silver, and the pomegranate, the bearing of Granada,\r\nin gold. A sumptuous banquet was here served up to the royal ladies, in\r\nwhich there was introduced a pomegranate-tree in confectionary work,\r\nbearing the arms of Spain:--so offensively glaring was the preference\r\ngiven by Mary to the country of her husband and of her maternal ancestry\r\nover that of which she was a native and in her own right queen! There\r\nwas no masking or dancing, but a great number of minstrels performed.\r\nThe princess returned to Somerset Place the same evening, and the next\r\nday to Hatfield.\r\n\r\nThe addresses of a new suitor soon after furnished Elizabeth with an\r\noccasion of gratifying the queen by fresh demonstrations of respect and\r\nduty. The king of Sweden was earnestly desirous of obtaining for Eric\r\nhis eldest son the hand of a lady whose reversionary prospects, added to\r\nher merit and accomplishments, rendered her without dispute the first\r\nmatch in Europe. He had denied his son's request to be permitted to\r\nvisit her in person, fearing that those violences of temper and\r\neccentricities of conduct of which this ill-fated prince had already\r\ngiven strong indications, might injure his cause in the judgement of so\r\ndiscerning a princess. The business was therefore to be transacted\r\nthrough the Swedish ambassador; but he was directed by his sovereign to\r\nmake his application by a message to Elizabeth herself, in which the\r\nqueen and council were not for the present to participate. The princess\r\ntook hold of this circumstance as a convenient pretext for rejecting a\r\nproposal which she felt no disposition to encourage; and she declared\r\nthat she could never listen to any overtures of this nature which had\r\nnot first received the sanction of her majesty. The ambassador pleaded\r\nin answer, that as a gentleman his master had judged it becoming that\r\nhis first application should be made to herself; but that should he be\r\nso happy as to obtain her concurrence, he would then, as a king, make\r\nhis demand in form to the queen her sister. The princess replied, that\r\nif it were to depend on herself, a single life would ever be her choice;\r\nand she finally dismissed the suit with a negative.\r\n\r\nOn receiving some hint of this transaction, Mary sent for sir Thomas\r\nPope, and having learned from him all the particulars, she directed him\r\nto express to her sister her high approbation of her proper and dutiful\r\nconduct on this occasion; and also to make himself acquainted with her\r\nsentiments on the subject of matrimony in general. He soon after\r\ntransmitted to her majesty all the information she could desire, in the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n\"First after I had declared to her grace how well the queen's majesty\r\nliked of her prudent and honorable answer made to the same messenger; I\r\nthen opened unto her grace the effects of the said messenger's credence;\r\nwhich after her grace had heard, I said, the queen's highness had sent\r\nme to her grace, not only to declare the same, but also to understand\r\nhow her grace liked the said motion. Whereunto, after a little pause\r\ntaken, her grace answered in form following: 'Master Pope, I require\r\nyou, after my most humble commendations to the queen's majesty, to\r\nrender unto the same like thanks that it pleased her highness, of her\r\ngoodness, to conceive so well of my answer made to the same messenger;\r\nand herewithal, of her princely consideration, with such speed to\r\ncommand you by your letters to signify the same unto me: who before\r\nremained wonderfully perplexed, fearing that her majesty might mistake\r\nthe same: for which her goodness, I acknowledge myself bound to honor,\r\nserve, love, and obey her highness during my life. Requiring you also to\r\nsay unto her majesty, that in the king my brother's time there was\r\noffered me a very honorable marriage, or two; and ambassadors sent to\r\ntreat with me touching the same; whereupon I made my humble suit unto\r\nhis highness, as some of honor yet living can be testimonies, that it\r\nwould like the same to give me leave, with his grace's favor, to remain\r\nin that estate I was, which of all others best liked me, or pleased me.\r\nAnd, in good faith, I pray you say unto her highness, I am even at this\r\npresent of the same mind, and so intend to continue, with her majesty's\r\nfavor: and assuring her highness I so well like this estate, as I\r\npersuade myself there is not any kind of life comparable unto it. And as\r\nconcerning my liking the said motion made by the said messenger, I\r\nbeseech you say unto her majesty, that to my remembrance I never heard\r\nof his master before this time; and that I so well like both the message\r\nand the messenger, as I shall most humbly pray God upon my knees, that\r\nfrom henceforth I never hear of the one nor the other: assure you that\r\nif he should eftsoons repair unto me, I would forbear to speak to him.\r\nAnd were there nothing else to move me to mislike the motion, other than\r\nthat his master would attempt the same without making the queen's\r\nmajesty privy thereunto, it were cause sufficient.'\r\n\r\n\"And when her grace had thus ended, I was so bold as of myself to say\r\nunto her grace, her pardon first required, that I thought few or none\r\nwould believe but that her grace could be right well contented to marry;\r\nso that there were some honorable marriage offered her by the queen's\r\nhighness, or by her majesty's assent. Whereunto her grace answered,\r\n'What I shall do hereafter I know not; but I assure you, upon my truth\r\nand fidelity, and as God be merciful unto me, I am not at this time\r\notherwise minded than I have declared unto you; no, though I were\r\noffered the greatest prince in all Europe.' And yet percase, the queen's\r\nmajesty may conceive this rather to proceed of a maidenly\r\nshamefacedness, than upon any such certain determination[30].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 30: The hint of \"some honorable marriage\" in the above letter,\r\nhas been supposed to refer to the duke of Savoy; but if the date\r\ninscribed upon the copy which is found among the Harleian MSS. be\r\ncorrect (April 26th 1558), this could not well be; since the queen,\r\nearly in the preceding year, had declined to interfere further in his\r\nbehalf.]\r\n\r\nThis letter appears to have been the last transaction which occurred\r\nbetween Mary and Elizabeth: from it, and from the whole of the notices\r\nrelative to the situation of the latter thrown together in the preceding\r\npages, it may be collected, that during the three last years of her\r\nsister's reign,--the period, namely, of her residence at Hatfield,--she\r\nhad few privations, and no personal hardships to endure: but for\r\nindividuals whom she esteemed, for principles to which her conscience\r\nsecretly inclined, for her country which she truly loved, her\r\napprehensions must have been continually excited, and too often\r\njustified by events the most cruel and disastrous.\r\n\r\nThe reestablishment, by solemn acts of the legislature, of the Romish\r\nritual and the papal authority, though attended with the entire\r\nprohibition of all protestant worship, was not sufficient for the\r\nbigotry of Mary. Aware that the new doctrines still found harbour in the\r\nbosoms of her subjects, she sought to drag them by her violence from\r\nthis last asylum; for to her, as to all tyrants, it appeared both\r\ndesirable and possible to subject the liberty of thinking to the\r\nregulation and control of human laws.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of her authority as head of the English church,--a title\r\nwhich the murmurs of her parliament had compelled her against her\r\nconscience to resume after laying it aside for some time,--she issued an\r\necclesiastical commission, which wanted nothing of the Spanish\r\ninquisition but the name. The commissioners were empowered to call\r\nbefore them the leading men in every parish of the kingdom, and to\r\ncompel them to bind themselves by oath to give information against such\r\nof their neighbours as, by abstaining from attendance at church or other\r\nsymptoms of disaffection to the present order of things, afforded room\r\nto doubt the soundness of their belief. Articles of faith were then\r\noffered to the suspected persons for their signature, and on their\r\nsimple refusal they were handed over to the civil power, and fire and\r\nfaggot awaited them. By this barbarous species of punishment, about two\r\nhundred and eighty persons are stated to have perished during the reign\r\nof Mary; but, to the disgrace of the learned, the rich, and the noble,\r\nthese martyrs, with the exception of a few distinguished ecclesiastics,\r\nwere almost all from the middling or lower, some from the very lowest\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nAmongst these glorious sufferers, therefore, the princess could have few\r\npersonal friends to regret; but in the much larger number of the\r\ndisgraced, the suspected, the imprisoned, the fugitive, she saw the\r\ngreater part of the public characters, whether statesmen or divines, on\r\nwhose support and attachment she had learned to place reliance.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary cruelties exercised upon sir John Cheke, who whilst he\r\nheld the post of preceptor to her brother had also assisted in her own\r\neducation, must have been viewed by Elizabeth with strong emotion of\r\nindignation and grief.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned, that after his release from imprisonment\r\nincurred in the cause of lady Jane Grey,--a release, by the way, which\r\nwas purchased by the sacrifice of his landed property and all his\r\nappointments,--this learned and estimable person obtained permission to\r\ntravel for a limited period. This was regarded as a special favor; for\r\nit was one of Mary's earliest acts of tyranny to prohibit the escape of\r\nher destined victims, and it was only by joining themselves to the\r\nforeign congregations of the reformed, who had license to depart the\r\nkingdom, or by eluding with much hazard the vigilance of the officers by\r\nwhom the seaports were watched, that any of her protestant subjects had\r\nbeen enabled to secure liberty of conscience in a voluntary exile. It is\r\na little remarkable that Rome should have been Cheke's first city of\r\npilgrimage; but classical associations in this instance overcame the\r\nforce of protestant antipathies. He took the opportunity however of\r\nvisiting Basil in his way, where an English congregation was\r\nestablished, and where he had the pleasure of introducing himself to\r\nseveral learned characters, once perhaps the chosen associates of\r\nErasmus.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1556 he had reached Strasburgh, for it was thence\r\nthat he addressed a letter to his dear friend and brother-in-law sir\r\nWilliam Cecil, who appears to have made some compliances with the times\r\nwhich alarmed and grieved him. It is in a strain of the most\r\naffectionate earnestness that he entreats him to hold fast his faith,\r\nand \"to take heed how he did in the least warp or strain his conscience\r\nby any compliance for his worldly security.\" But such exhortations,\r\nhowever salutary in themselves, did not come with the best grace from\r\nthose who had found in flight a refuge from the terrors of that\r\npersecution which was raging in all its fierceness before the eyes of\r\nsuch of their unfortunate brethren as had found themselves necessitated\r\nto abide the fiery trial. A remark by no means foreign to the case\r\nbefore us! Sir John Cheke's leave of absence seems now to have expired;\r\nand it was probably with the design of making interest for its renewal\r\nthat he privately repaired, soon after the date of his letter, to\r\nBrussels, on a visit to his two learned friends, lord Paget and sir John\r\nMason, then residing in that city as Mary's ambassadors. These men were\r\nrecent converts, or more likely conformists, to the court religion; and\r\nPaget's furious councils against Elizabeth have been already mentioned.\r\nIt is to be hoped that they did not add to the guilt of self-interested\r\ncompliances in matters of faith the blacker crime of a barbarous act of\r\nperfidy against a former associate and brother-protestant who had\r\nscarcely ceased to be their guest;--but certain it is, that on some\r\nsecret intimation of his having entered his territories, king Philip\r\nissued special orders for the seizure of Cheke. On his return, between\r\nBrussels and Antwerp, the unhappy man, with sir Peter Carew his\r\ncompanion, was apprehended by a provost-marshal, bound hand and foot,\r\nthrown into a cart, and so conveyed on board a vessel sailing for\r\nEngland. He is said to have been brought to the Tower muffled, according\r\nto an odious practice of Spanish despotism introduced into the country\r\nduring the reign of Mary. Under the terror of such a surprise the awful\r\nalternative \"Comply or burn\" was laid before him. Human frailty under\r\nthese trying circumstances prevailed; and in an evil hour this champion\r\nof light and learning was tempted to subscribe his false assent to the\r\ndoctrine of the real presence and the whole list of Romish articles.\r\nThis was but the beginning of humiliations: he was now required to\r\npronounce two ample recantations, one before the queen in person, the\r\nother before cardinal Pole, who also imposed upon him various acts of\r\npenance. Even this did not immediately procure his liberation from\r\nprison; and while he was obliged in public to applaud the mercy of his\r\nenemies in terms of the most abject submission, he bewailed in private,\r\nwith abundance of bitter tears, their cruelty, and still more his own\r\ncriminal compliance. The savage zealots knew not how to set bounds to\r\ntheir triumph over a man whom learning and acknowledged talents and\r\nhonorable employments had rendered so considerable.\r\n\r\nEven when at length he was set free, and flattered himself that he had\r\ndrained to the dregs his cup of bitterness, he discovered that the\r\nmasterpiece of barbarity, the refinement of insult, was yet in store. He\r\nwas required, as evidence of the sincerity of his conversion and a token\r\nof his complete restoration to royal favor, to take his seat on the\r\nbench by the side of the savage Bonner, and assist at the condemnation\r\nof his brother-protestants. The unhappy man did not refuse,--so\r\nthoroughly was his spirit subdued within him,--but it broke his heart;\r\nand retiring at last to the house of an old and learned friend, whose\r\ndoor was opened to him in Christian charity, he there ended within a few\r\nmonths, his miserable life, a prey to shame, remorse and melancholy. A\r\nsadder tale the annals of persecution do not furnish, or one more\r\nhumbling to the pride and confidence of human virtue. Many have failed\r\nunder lighter trials; few have expiated a failure by sufferings so\r\nsevere. How often must this victim of a wounded spirit have dwelt with\r\nenvy, amid his slower torments, on the brief agonies and lasting crown\r\nof a courageous martyrdom!\r\n\r\nIt is happily not possible for a kingdom to flourish under the crushing\r\nweight of such a tyranny as that of Mary. The retreat of the foreign\r\nprotestants had robbed the country of hundreds of industrious and\r\nskilful artificers; the arbitrary exactions of the queen impoverished\r\nand discouraged the trading classes, against whom they principally\r\noperated; tumults and insurrections were frequent, and afforded a\r\npretext for the introduction of Spanish troops; the treasury was\r\nexhausted in efforts for maintaining the power of the sovereign,\r\nrestoring the church to opulence and splendor, and re-edifying the\r\nfallen monasteries. To add to these evils, a foreign marriage rendered\r\nboth the queen and country subservient to the interested or ambitious\r\nprojects of the Spanish sovereign. For his sake a needless war was\r\ndeclared against France, which, after draining entirely an already\r\nfailing treasury, ended in the loss of Calais, the last remaining trophy\r\nof the victories by which the Edwards and the Henrys had humbled in the\r\ndust the pride and power of France.\r\n\r\nThis last stroke completed the dejection of the nation; and Mary\r\nherself, who was by no means destitute of sensibility where the honor of\r\nher crown was concerned, sunk into an incurable melancholy. \"When I\r\ndie,\" said she to her attendants who sought to discover the cause of her\r\ndespondency, \"Calais will be found at my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfeeling desertion of her husband, the consciousness of having\r\nincurred the hatred of her subjects, the unprosperous state of her\r\naffairs, and the well founded apprehension that her successor would once\r\nmore overthrow the whole edifice of papal power which she had labored\r\nwith such indefatigable ardor to restore, may each be supposed to have\r\ninfused its own drop of bitterness into the soul of this unhappy\r\nprincess. The long and severe mortifications of her youth, while they\r\nsoured her temper, had also undermined her constitution, and contributed\r\nto bring upon her a premature old age; dropsical symptoms began to\r\nappear, and after a lingering illness of nearly half a year she sunk\r\ninto the grave on the 17th day of November 1558, in the forty-fourth\r\nyear of her age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1558 AND 1559.\r\n\r\nGeneral joy on the accession of Elizabeth.--Views of the nobility--of\r\nthe middling and lower classes.--Flattery with which she is\r\naddressed.--Descriptions of her person.--Her first privy-council.--Parry\r\nand Cecil brought into office.--Notices of each.--Death of cardinal\r\nPole.--The queen enters London--passes to the Tower.--Lord Robert Dudley\r\nher master of the horse.--Notices respecting him.--The queen's treatment\r\nof her relations.--The Howard family.--Sir Richard Sackville.--Henry\r\nCary.--The last, created lord Hunsdon.--Preparations in London against\r\nthe queen's coronation.--Splendid costume of the age.--She passes by\r\nwater from Westminster to the Tower.--The procession described.--Her\r\npassage through the city.--Pageants exhibited.--The bishops refuse to\r\ncrown her.--Bishop of Carlisle prevailed on.--Religious sentiments of\r\nthe queen.--Prohibition of preaching--of theatrical exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever perhaps was the accession of any prince the subject of such keen\r\nand lively interest to a whole people as that of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nBoth in the religious establishments and political relations of the\r\ncountry, the most important changes were anticipated; changes in which\r\nthe humblest individual found himself concerned, and to which a vast\r\nmajority of the nation looked forward with hope and joy.\r\n\r\nWith the courtiers and great nobles, whose mutability of faith had so\r\nhappily corresponded with every ecclesiastical vicissitude of the last\r\nthree reigns, political and personal considerations may well be supposed\r\nto have held the first place; and though the old religion might still be\r\nendeared to them by many cherished associations and by early prejudice,\r\nthere were few among them who did not regard the liberation of the\r\ncountry from Spanish influence as ample compensation for the probable\r\nrestoration of the religious establishment of Henry or of Edward.\r\nBesides, there was scarcely an individual belonging to these classes who\r\nhad not in some manner partaken of the plunder of the church, and whom\r\nthe avowed principles of Mary had not disquieted with apprehensions that\r\nsome plan of compulsory restitution would sooner or later be attempted\r\nby an union of royal and papal authority.\r\n\r\nWith the middling and lower classes religious views and feelings were\r\npredominant The doctrines of the new and better system of faith and\r\nworship had now become more precious and important than ever in the eyes\r\nof its adherents from the hardships which many of them had encountered\r\nfor its sake, and from the interest which each disciple vindicated to\r\nhimself in the glory and merit of the holy martyrs whose triumphant exit\r\nthey had witnessed. With all the fervor of pious gratitude they offered\r\nup their thanksgivings for the signal deliverance by which their prayers\r\nhad been answered. The bloody tyranny of Mary was at an end; and though\r\nthe known conformity of Elizabeth to Romish rites might apparently give\r\nroom for doubts and suspicions, it should seem that neither catholics\r\nnor protestants were willing to believe that the daughter of Anne\r\nBoleyn could in her heart be a papist. Under this impression the\r\ncitizens of London, who spoke the sense of their own class throughout\r\nthe kingdom, welcomed the new queen as a protectress sent by Heaven\r\nitself: but even in the first transports of their joy, and amid the\r\npompous pageantries by which their loyal congratulations were expressed,\r\nthey took care to intimate, in a manner not to be misunderstood, their\r\nhopes and expectations on the great concern now nearest to their hearts.\r\n\r\nPrudence confined within their own bosoms the regrets and murmurs of the\r\npopish clergy; submission and a simulated loyalty were at present\r\nobviously their only policy: thus not a whisper breathed abroad but of\r\njoy and gratulation and happy presage of the days to come.\r\n\r\nThe sex, the youth, the accomplishments, the graces, the past\r\nmisfortunes of the princess, all served to heighten the interest with\r\nwhich she was beheld: the age of chivalry had not yet expired; and in\r\nspite of the late unfortunate experience of a female reign, the romantic\r\nimage of a maiden queen dazzled all eyes, subdued all hearts, inflamed\r\nthe imaginations of the brave and courtly youth with visions of love and\r\nglory, exalted into a passionate homage the principle of loyalty, and\r\nurged adulation to the very brink of idolatry.\r\n\r\nThe fulsome compliments on her beauty which Elizabeth, almost to the\r\nlatest period of her life, not only permitted but required and delighted\r\nin, have been adverted to by all the writers who have made her reign and\r\ncharacter their theme: and those of the number whom admiration and pity\r\nof the fair queen of Scots have rendered hostile to her memory, have\r\ntaken a malicious pleasure in exaggerating the extravagance of this\r\nweakness, by denying her, even in her freshest years, all pretensions to\r\nthose personal charms by which her rival was so eminently,\r\ndistinguished. Others however have been more favorable, and probably\r\nmore just, to her on this point; and it would be an injury to her memory\r\nto withhold from the reader the following portraitures which authorize\r\nus to form a pleasing as well as majestic image of this illustrious\r\nfemale at the period of her accession and at the age of five-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n\"She was a lady of great beauty, of decent stature, and of an excellent\r\nshape. In her youth she was adorned with a more than usual maiden\r\nmodesty; her skin was of pure white, and her hair of a yellow colour;\r\nher eyes were beautiful and lively. In short, her whole body was well\r\nmade, and her face was adorned with a wonderful and sweet beauty and\r\nmajesty. This beauty lasted till her middle age, though it\r\ndeclined[31].\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Note 31: Bohun's \"Character of Queen Elizabeth.\"]\r\n\r\n\"She was of personage tall, of hair and complexion fair, and therewith\r\nwell favored, but high-nosed; of limbs and feature neat, and, which\r\nadded to the lustre of those exterior graces, of stately and majestic\r\ncomportment; participating in this more of her father than her mother,\r\nwho was of an inferior allay, plausible, or, as the French hath it, more\r\ndebonaire and affable, virtues which might suit well with majesty, and\r\nwhich descending as hereditary to the daughter, did render her of a more\r\nsweeter temper and endeared her more to the love and liking of her\r\npeople, who gave her the name and fame of a most gracious and popular\r\nprince[32].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 32: Naunton's \"Fragmenta Regalia.\"]\r\n\r\nThe death of Mary was announced to the two houses, which were then\r\nsitting, by Heath bishop of Ely, the lord-chancellor. In both\r\nassemblies, after the decorum of a short pause, the notification was\r\nfollowed by joyful shouts of \"God save queen Elizabeth! long and happily\r\nmay she reign!\" and with great alacrity the members issued out to\r\nproclaim the new sovereign before the palace in Westminster and again at\r\nthe great cross in Cheapside.\r\n\r\nThe Londoners knew not how to contain their joy on this happy\r\noccasion:--the bells of all the churches were set ringing, bonfires were\r\nkindled, and tables were spread in the streets according to the\r\nbountiful and hospitable custom of that day, \"where was plentiful\r\neating, drinking, and making merry.\" On the following Sunday _Te Deum_\r\nwas sung in the churches; probably an unexampled, however merited,\r\nexpression of disrespect to the memory of the former sovereign.\r\n\r\nElizabeth received the news of her own accession at Hatfield. We are not\r\ntold that she affected any great concern for the loss of her sister,\r\nmuch less did any unbecoming sign of exultation escape her; but,\r\n\"falling on her knees, after a good time of respiration she uttered this\r\nverse of the Psalms; _A Domino factum est istud, et est mirabile oculis\r\nnostris_[33]: which to this day we find on the stamp of her gold; with\r\nthis on her silver, _Posui Deum adjutorem meum_[34].\"[35]\r\n\r\n[Note 33: It is the Lord's doing, it is marvellous in our eyes.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34: I have chosen God for my helper.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35: \"Fragmenta Regalia.\"]\r\n\r\nSeveral noblemen of the late queen's council now repairing to her, she\r\nheld at Hatfield on November the 20th her first privy-council; at which\r\nshe declared sir Thomas Parry comptroller of her household, sir Edward\r\nRogers captain of the guard, and sir William Cecil principal secretary\r\nof state, all three being at the same time admitted to the\r\ncouncil-board. From these appointments, the first of her reign, some\r\npresages might be drawn of her future government favorable to her own\r\ncharacter and correspondent to the wishes of her people.\r\n\r\nParry was the person who had filled for many years the office of her\r\ncofferer, who was perfectly in the secret of whatever confidential\r\nintercourse she might formerly have held with the lord-admiral, and\r\nwhose fidelity to her in that business had stood firm against all the\r\nthreats of the protector and council, and the artifices of those by whom\r\nhis examination had been conducted. That mindfulness of former services,\r\nof which the advancement of this man formed by no means a solitary\r\ninstance in the conduct of Elizabeth, appeared the more commendable in\r\nher, because she accompanied it with a generous oblivion of the many\r\nslights and injuries to which her defenceless and persecuted condition\r\nhad so long exposed her from others.\r\n\r\nThe merit of Cecil was already in part known to the public; and his\r\npromotion to an office of such importance was a happy omen for the\r\nprotestant cause, his attachment to which had been judged the sole\r\nimpediment to his advancement under the late reign to situations of\r\npower and trust corresponding with the opinion entertained of his\r\nintegrity and political wisdom. A brief retrospect of the scenes of\r\npublic life in which he had already been an actor will best explain the\r\ncharacter and sentiments of this eminent person, destined to wield for\r\nmore than forty years with unparalleled skill and felicity, under a\r\nmistress who knew his value, the energies of the English state.\r\n\r\nBorn, in 1520, the son of the master of the royal wardrobe, Cecil early\r\nengaged the notice of Henry VIII. by the fame of a religious dispute\r\nwhich he had held in Latin with two popish priests attached to the Irish\r\nchieftain O'Neal. A place in reversion freely bestowed on him by the\r\nking at once rewarded the zeal of the young polemic, and encouraged him\r\nto desert the profession of the law, in which he had embarked, for the\r\npolitical career.\r\n\r\nHis marriage with the sister of sir John Cheke strengthened his interest\r\nat court by procuring him an introduction to the earl of Hertford, and\r\nearly in the reign of Edward this powerful patronage obtained for him\r\nthe office of secretary of state. In the first disgrace of the protector\r\nhe lost his place, and was for a short time a prisoner in the Tower; but\r\nhis compliant conduct soon restored him to favor: he scrupled not to\r\ndraw the articles of impeachment against the protector; and\r\nNorthumberland, finding him both able in business and highly acceptable\r\nto the young monarch, procured, or permitted, his reinstatement in\r\noffice in September 1550.\r\n\r\nCecil, however, was both too wary and too honest to regard himself as\r\npledged to the support of Northumberland's inordinate schemes of\r\nambition; and scarcely any public man of the day, attached to the\r\nprotestant cause, escaped better in the affair of lady Jane Grey. It is\r\ntrue that one writer accuses him of having drawn all the papers in her\r\nfavor: but this appears to be, in part at least, either a mistake or a\r\ncalumny; and it seems, on the contrary, that he refused to\r\nNorthumberland some services of this nature. It has been already\r\nmentioned that his name appeared with those of the other\r\nprivy-councillors to Edward's settlement of the crown; and his plea of\r\nhaving signed it merely as a witness to the king's signature, deserves\r\nto be regarded as a kind of subterfuge. But he was early in paying his\r\nrespects to Mary, and he took advantage of the graciousness with which\r\nshe received his explanations to obtain a general pardon, which\r\nprotected him from all personal danger. He lost however his place of\r\nsecretary, which some have affirmed that he might have retained by\r\nfurther compliances in religion. This however is the more doubtful,\r\nbecause it cannot be questioned that he must have yielded a good deal on\r\nthis point, without which he neither could nor would have made one of a\r\ndeputation sent to conduct to England cardinal Pole the papal legate,\r\nnor probably would he have been joined in commission with the cardinal\r\nand other persons sent to treat of a peace with France.\r\n\r\nBut admitting, as we must, that this eminent statesman was far from\r\naspiring to the praise of a confessor, he will still be found to deserve\r\nhigh commendation for the zeal and courage with which, as a member of\r\nparliament, he defended the interests of his oppressed and suffering\r\nfellow-protestants. At considerable hazard to himself, he opposed with\r\ngreat freedom of speech a bill for confiscating the property of exiles\r\nfor religion; and he appears to have escaped committal to the Tower on\r\nthis account, solely by the presence of mind which he exhibited before\r\nthe council and the friendship of some of its members.\r\n\r\nHe is known to have maintained a secret and intimate correspondence with\r\nElizabeth during the time of her adversity, and to have assisted her on\r\nvarious trying occasions with his salutary counsels; and nothing could\r\nbe more interesting than to trace the origin and progress of that\r\nconfidential relation between these eminent and in many respects\r\ncongenial characters, which after a long course of years was only\r\nterminated by the hand of death;--but materials for this purpose are\r\nunfortunately wanting.\r\n\r\nThe letters on both sides were probably sacrificed by the parties\r\nthemselves to the caution which their situation required; and among the\r\npublished extracts from the Burleigh papers, only a single document is\r\nfound relative to the connexion subsisting between them during the reign\r\nof Mary. This is a short and uninteresting letter addressed to Cecil by\r\nsir Thomas Benger, one of the princess's officers, in which, after some\r\nmention of accounts, not now intelligible, he promises that he and sir\r\nThomas Parry will move the princess to grant his correspondent's\r\nrequest, which is not particularized, and assures him that as his coming\r\nthither would be thankfully received, so he wishes that all the friends\r\nof the princess entertained the same sense of that matter as he does.\r\nThe letter seems to point at some official concern of Cecil in the\r\naffairs of Elizabeth. It is dated October 24th 1556.\r\n\r\nThe private character of Cecil was in every respect exemplary, and his\r\ndisposition truly amiable. His second marriage with one of the learned\r\ndaughters of sir Anthony Cook conferred upon him that exalted species of\r\ndomestic happiness which a sympathy in mental endowments can alone\r\nbestow; whilst it had the further advantage of connecting him with the\r\nexcellent man her father, with sir Nicholas Bacon and sir Thomas Hobby,\r\nthe husbands of two of her sisters, and generally with the wisest and\r\nmost conscientious supporters of the protestant interest. This great\r\nminister was honorably distinguished through life by an ardor and\r\nconstancy of friendship rare in all classes of men, but esteemed\r\npeculiarly so in those whose lives are occupied amid the heartless\r\nceremonial of courts and the political intrigues of princes. His\r\nattachments, as they never degenerated into the weakness of favoritism,\r\nwere as much a source of benefit to his country as of enjoyment to\r\nhimself; for his friends were those of virtue and the state. And there\r\nwere few among the more estimable public men of this reign who were not\r\nindebted either for their first introduction to the notice of Elizabeth,\r\ntheir continuance in her favor, or their restoration to it when\r\nundeservedly lost, to the generous patronage or powerful intercession of\r\nCecil.\r\n\r\nOn appointing him a member of her council, the queen addressed her\r\nsecretary in the following gracious words:\r\n\r\n\"I give you this charge, that you shall be of my privy-council, and\r\ncontent yourself to take pains for me and my realm. This judgement I\r\nhave of you, that you will not be corrupted with any gift, and that you\r\nwill be faithful to the state, and that, without respect of my private\r\nwill, you will give me that counsel that you think best: And that if you\r\nshall know any thing necessary to be declared to me of secrecy, you\r\nshall show it to myself only, and assure yourself I will not fail to\r\nkeep taciturnity therein. And therefore herewith I charge you[36].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 36: \"Nugae Antiquae.\"]\r\n\r\nCardinal Pole was not doomed to be an eye-witness of the relapse of the\r\nnation into what he must have regarded as heresy of the most aggravated\r\nnature; he expired a few hours after his royal kinswoman: and Elizabeth,\r\nwith due consideration for the illustrious ancestry, the learning, the\r\nmoderation, and the blameless manners of the man, authorized his\r\nhonorable interment at Canterbury among the archbishops his\r\npredecessors, with the attendance of two bishops, his ancient friends\r\nand the faithful companions of his long exile.\r\n\r\nOn November 23d the queen set forward for her capital, attended by a\r\ntrain of about a thousand nobles, knights, gentlemen, and ladies, and\r\ntook up her abode for the present at the dissolved monastery of the\r\nChartreux, or Charterhouse, then the residence of lord North; a splendid\r\npile which offered ample accommodation for a royal retinue. Her next\r\nremove, in compliance with ancient custom, was to the Tower. On this\r\noccasion all the streets from the Charterhouse were spread with fine\r\ngravel; singers and musicians were stationed by the way, and a vast\r\nconcourse of people freely lent their joyful and admiring acclamations,\r\nas preceded by her heralds and great officers, and richly attired in\r\npurple velvet, she passed along mounted on her palfrey, and returning\r\nthe salutations of the humblest of her subjects with graceful and\r\nwinning affability.\r\n\r\nWith what vivid and what affecting impressions of the vicissitudes\r\nattending on the great must she have passed again within the antique\r\nwalls of that fortress once her dungeon, now her palace! She had entered\r\nit by the Traitor's gate, a terrified and defenceless prisoner, smarting\r\nunder many wrongs, hopeless of deliverance, and apprehending nothing\r\nless than an ignominious death. She had quitted it, still a captive,\r\nunder the guard of armed men, to be conducted she knew not whither. She\r\nreturned to it in all the pomp of royalty, surrounded by the ministers\r\nof her power, ushered by the applauses of her people; the cherished\r\nobject of every eye, the idol of every heart.\r\n\r\nDevotion alone could supply becoming language to the emotions which\r\nswelled her bosom; and no sooner had she reached the royal apartments,\r\nthan falling on her knees she returned humble and fervent thanks to that\r\nProvidence which had brought her in safety, like Daniel from the den of\r\nlions, to behold this day of exaltation.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was attended on her passage to the Tower by one who like\r\nherself returned with honor to that place of his former captivity; but\r\nnot, like herself, with a mind disciplined by adversity to receive with\r\nmoderation and wisdom \"the good vicissitude of joy.\" This person was\r\nlord Robert Dudley, whom the queen had thus early encouraged to aspire\r\nto her future favors by appointing him to the office of master of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nWe are totally uninformed of the circumstances which had recommended to\r\nher peculiar patronage this bad son of a bad father; whose enterprises,\r\nif successful, would have disinherited of a kingdom Elizabeth herself no\r\nless than Mary. But it is remarkable, that even under the reign of the\r\nlatter, the surviving members of the Dudley family had been able to\r\nrecover in great measure from the effects of their late signal reverses.\r\nLord Robert, soon after his release from the Tower, contrived to make\r\nhimself so acceptable to king Philip by his courtier-like attentions,\r\nand to Mary by his diligence in posting backwards and forwards to bring\r\nher intelligence of her husband during his long visits to the continent,\r\nthat he earned from the latter several marks of favor. Two of his\r\nbrothers fought, and one fell, in the battle of St. Quintin's; and\r\nimmediately afterwards the duchess their mother found means, through\r\nsome Spanish interests and connexions, to procure the restoration in\r\nblood of all her surviving children. The appointment of Robert to the\r\nplace of master of the ordnance soon followed; so that even before the\r\naccession of Elizabeth he might be regarded as a rising man in the\r\nstate. His personal graces and elegant accomplishments are on all hands\r\nacknowledged to have been sufficiently striking to dazzle the eyes and\r\ncharm the heart of a young princess of a lively imagination and absolute\r\nmistress of her own actions. The circumstance of his being already\r\nmarried, blinded her perhaps to the nature of her sentiments towards\r\nhim, or at least it was regarded by her as a sufficient sanction in the\r\neyes of the public for those manifestations of favor and esteem with\r\nwhich she was pleased to honor him. But whether the affection which she\r\nentertained for him best deserved the name of friendship or a still\r\ntenderer one, seems after all a question of too subtile and obscure a\r\nnature for sober discussion; though in a French \"_cour d'amour_\" it\r\nmight have furnished pleas and counterpleas of exquisite ingenuity,\r\nprodigious sentimental interest, and length interminable. What is\r\nunfortunately too certain is, that he was a favorite, and in the common\r\njudgement of the court, of the nation, and of posterity, an unworthy\r\none; but calumny and prejudice alone have dared to attack the\r\nreputation of the queen.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had no propensity to exalt immoderately her relations by the\r\nmother's side;--for she neither loved nor honored that mother's memory;\r\nbut several of the number may be mentioned, whose merits towards\r\nherself, or whose qualifications for the public service, justly entitled\r\nthem to share in her distribution of offices and honors, and whom she\r\nalways treated with distinction. The whole illustrious family of the\r\nHowards were her relations; and in the first year of her reign she\r\nconferred on the duke of Norfolk, her second-cousin, the order of the\r\ngarter. Her great-uncle lord William Howard, created baron of Effingham\r\nby Mary, was continued by her in the high office of lord-chamberlain,\r\nand soon after appointed one of the commissioners for concluding a peace\r\nwith France. Lord Thomas Howard, her mother's first-cousin, who had\r\ntreated her with distinguished respect and kindness on her arrival at\r\nHampton Court from Woodstock, and had the further merit of being\r\nindulgent to protestants during the persecutions of Mary, received from\r\nher the title of viscount Bindon, and continued much in her favor to the\r\nend of his days.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Sackville, also her mother's first-cousin, had filled\r\ndifferent fiscal offices under the three last reigns; he was a man of\r\nabilities, and derived from a long line of ancestors great estates and\r\nextensive influence in the county of Sussex. The people, who marked his\r\ngrowing wealth, and to whom he was perhaps officially obnoxious,\r\nnicknamed him Fill-sack: in Mary's time he was a catholic, a\r\nprivy-councillor, and chancellor of the court of Augmentations; under\r\nher successor he changed the first designation and retained the two\r\nlast, which he probably valued more. He is chiefly memorable as the\r\nfather of Sackville the poet, afterwards lord Buckhurst and progenitor\r\nof the dukes of Dorset.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Knolles, whose lady was one of the queen's nearest\r\nkinswomen, was deservedly called to the privy-council on his return from\r\nhis voluntary banishment for conscience' sake; his sons gained\r\nconsiderable influence in the court of Elizabeth; his daughter, the\r\nmother of Essex, and afterwards the wife of Leicester, was for various\r\nreasons long an object of the queen's particular aversion.\r\n\r\nBut of all her relations, the one who had deserved most at her hands was\r\nHenry Carey, brother to lady Knolles, and son to Mary Boleyn, her\r\nmajesty's aunt. This gentleman had expended several thousand pounds of\r\nhis own patrimony in her service and relief during the time of her\r\nimprisonment, and she liberally requited his friendship at her first\r\ncreation of peers, by conferring upon him, with the title of baron\r\nHunsdon, the royal residence of that name, with its surrounding park and\r\nseveral beneficial leases of crown lands. He was afterwards joined in\r\nvarious commissions and offices of trust: but his remuneration was, on\r\nthe whole, by no means exorbitant; for he was not rapacious, and\r\nconsequently not importunate; and the queen, in the employments which\r\nshe assigned him, seemed rather to consult her own advantage and that of\r\nher country, by availing herself of the abilities of a diligent and\r\nfaithful servant, than to please herself by granting rewards to an\r\naffectionate and generous kinsman. In fact, lord Hunsdon was skilled as\r\nlittle in the ceremonious and sentimental gallantry which she required\r\nfrom her courtiers, as in the circumspect and winding policy which she\r\napproved in her statesmen. \"As he lived in a ruffling time,\" says\r\nNaunton, \"so he loved sword and buckler men, and such as our fathers\r\nwont to call men of their hands, of which sort he had many brave\r\ngentlemen that followed him; yet not taken for a popular or dangerous\r\nperson.\" Though extremely choleric, he was honest, and not at all\r\nmalicious. It was said of him that \"his Latin and his dissimulation were\r\nboth alike,\" equally bad, and that \"his custom in swearing and obscenity\r\nin speech made him seem a worse Christian than he was.\"\r\n\r\nFuller relates of him the following characteristic anecdote. \"Once, one\r\nMr. Colt chanced to meet him coming from Hunsdon to London, in the\r\nequipage of a lord of those days. The lord, on some former grudge, gave\r\nhim a box on the ear: Colt presently returned the principal with\r\ninterest; and thereupon his servants drawing their swords, swarmed about\r\nhim. 'You rogues,' said my lord, 'may not I and my neighbour change a\r\nblow but you must interpose?' Thus the quarrel was begun and ended in\r\nthe same minute[37].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 37: \"Worthies\" in Herts.]\r\n\r\nThe queen's attachment to such of her family as she was pleased to\r\nhonor with her notice, was probably the more constant because there was\r\nnothing in it of excess or of blindness:--even Leicester in the height\r\nof his favor felt that he must hold sacred their claims to her regard:\r\naccording to Naunton's phrase, he used to say of Sackville and Hunsdon,\r\n\"that they were of the tribe of Dan, and were Noli me tangere's.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few days spent in the Tower, Elizabeth passed by water to\r\nSomerset Place; and thence, about a fortnight after, when the funeral of\r\nher predecessor was over, to the palace of Westminster, where she kept\r\nher Christmas.\r\n\r\nBusy preparation was now making in her good city of London against the\r\nsolemn day of her passage in state from the Tower to her coronation at\r\nWestminster. The usages and sentiments of that age conferred upon these\r\npublic ceremonials a character of earnest and dignified importance now\r\nlost; and on this memorable occasion, when the mingled sense of\r\ndeliverance received and of future favor to be conciliated had opened\r\nthe hearts of all men, it was resolved to lavish in honor of the new\r\nsovereign every possible demonstration of loyal affection, and every\r\nknown device of festal magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe costume of the age was splendid. Gowns of velvet or satin, richly\r\ntrimmed with silk, furs, or gold lace, costly gold chains, and caps or\r\nhoods of rich materials adorned with feathers or ouches, decorated on\r\nall occasions of display the persons not of nobles or courtiers alone,\r\nbut of their crowds of retainers and higher menials, and even of the\r\nplain substantial citizens. Female attire was proportionally sumptuous.\r\nHangings, of cloth, of silk, of velvet, cloth of gold or silver, or\r\n\"needlework sublime,\" clothed on days of family-festivity the _upper\r\nchamber_[38] of every house of respectable appearance; these on public\r\nfestivals were suspended from the balconies, and uniting with the\r\nbanners and pennons floating overhead, gave to the streets almost the\r\nappearance of a suit of long and gayly-dressed saloons. Every\r\ncircumstance thus conspired to render the public entry of queen\r\nElizabeth the most gorgeous and at the same time the most interesting\r\nspectacle of the kind ever exhibited in the English metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Note 38: As long as that style of domestic architecture prevailed\r\nin which every story was made to project considerably beyond the one\r\nbeneath it, the upper room, from its superior size and lightsomeness,\r\nappears to have been that dedicated to the entertainment of guests.]\r\n\r\nHer majesty was first to be conducted from her palace in Westminster to\r\nthe royal apartments in the Tower; and a splendid water procession was\r\nappointed for the purpose. At this period, when the streets were narrow\r\nand ill-paved, the roads bad, and the luxury of close carriages unknown,\r\nthe Thames was the great thoroughfare of the metropolis. The old palace\r\nof Westminster, as well as those of Richmond and Greenwich, the favorite\r\nsummer residences of the Tudor princes, stood on its banks, and the\r\ncourt passed from one to the other in barges. The nobility were\r\nbeginning to occupy with their mansions and gardens the space between\r\nthe Strand and the water, and it had become a reigning folly amongst\r\nthem to vie with each other in the splendor of their barges and of the\r\nliveries of the rowers, who were all distinguished by the crests or\r\nbadges of their lords.\r\n\r\nThe corporation and trading companies of London possessed, as now, their\r\nstate-barges enriched with carved and gilded figures and \"decked and\r\ntrimmed with targets and banners of their misteries.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January 1559 these were all drawn forth in grand array;\r\nand to enliven the pomp, \"the bachelor's barge of the lord-mayor's\r\ncompany, to wit the mercers, had their barge with a _foist_ trimmed with\r\nthree tops and artillery aboard, gallantly appointed to wait upon them,\r\nshooting off lustily as they went, with great and pleasant melody of\r\ninstruments, which played in most sweet and heavenly manner.\" In this\r\nstate they rowed up to Westminster and attended her majesty with the\r\nroyal barges back to the Tower.\r\n\r\nHer passage through the city took place two days after.\r\n\r\nShe issued forth drawn in a sumptuous chariot, preceded by trumpeters\r\nand heralds in their coat-armour and \"most honorably accompanied as well\r\nwith gentlemen, barons, and other the nobility of this realm, as also\r\nwith a notable train of goodly and beautiful ladies, richly appointed.\"\r\nThe ladies were on horseback, and both they and the lords were habited\r\nin crimson velvet, with which their horses were also trapped. Let it be\r\nremarked by the way, that the retinue of fair equestrians constantly\r\nattendant on the person of the maiden queen in all her public\r\nappearances, was a circumstance of prodigious effect; the gorgeousness\r\nof royal pomp was thus heightened, and at the same time rendered more\r\namiable and attractive by the alliance of grace and beauty; and a\r\nromantic kind of charm, comparable to that which seizes the imagination\r\nin the splendid fictions of chivalry, was cast over the heartless parade\r\nof courtly ceremonial.\r\n\r\nIt was a very different spirit, however, from that of romance or of\r\nknight-errantry which inspired the bosoms of the citizens whose\r\nacclamations now rent the air on her approach. They beheld in the\r\nprincess whom they welcomed the daughter of that Henry who had redeemed\r\nthe land from papal tyranny and extortion; the sister of that young and\r\ngodly Edward,--the Josiah of English story,--whose pious hand had reared\r\nagain the altars of pure and primitive religion; and they had bodied\r\nforth for her instruction and admonition, in a series of solemn\r\npageants, the maxims by which they hoped to see her equal or surpass\r\nthese deep-felt merits of her predecessors.\r\n\r\nThese pageants were erections placed across the principal streets in the\r\nmanner of triumphal arches: illustrative sentences in English and Latin\r\nwere inscribed upon them; and a child was stationed in each, who\r\nexplained to the queen in English verse the meaning of the whole. The\r\nfirst was of three stories, and represented by living figures: first,\r\nHenry VII. and his royal spouse Elizabeth of York, from whom her majesty\r\nderived her name; secondly, Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn; and lastly, her\r\nmajesty in person; all in royal robes. The verses described the\r\nfelicity of that union of the houses to which she owed her existence,\r\nand of concord in general. The second pageant was styled \"The seat of\r\nworthy governance,\" on the summit of which sat another representative of\r\nthe queen; beneath were the cardinal virtues trampling under their feet\r\nthe opposite vices, among whom Ignorance and Superstition were not\r\nforgotten. The third exhibited the eight Beatitudes, all ascribed with\r\nsome ingenuity of application to her majesty. The fourth ventured upon a\r\nmore trying topic: its opposite sides represented in lively contrast the\r\nimages of a decayed and of a flourishing commonwealth; and from a cave\r\nbelow issued Time leading forth his daughter Truth, who held in her hand\r\nan English bible, which she offered to the queen's acceptance. Elizabeth\r\nreceived the volume, and reverently pressing it with both hands to her\r\nheart and to her lips, declared aloud, amid the tears and grateful\r\nbenedictions of her people, that she thanked the city more for that gift\r\nthan for all the cost they had bestowed upon her, and that she would\r\noften read over that book. The last pageant exhibited \"a seemly and mete\r\npersonage, richly apparelled in parliament robes, with a sceptre in her\r\nhand, over whose head was written 'Deborah, the judge and restorer of\r\nthe house of Israel.'\"\r\n\r\nTo render more palatable these grave moralities, the recorder of London,\r\napproaching her majesty's chariot near the further end of Cheapside,\r\nwhere ended the long array of the city companies, which had lined the\r\nstreets all the way from Fenchurch, presented her with a splendid and\r\nample purse, containing one thousand marks in gold. The queen graciously\r\nreceived it with both hands, and answered his harangue \"marvellous\r\npithily.\"\r\n\r\nTo crown the whole, those two griesly personages vulgarly called Gog and\r\nMagog, but described by the learned as Gogmagog the Albion and Corineus\r\nthe Briton, deserted on this memorable day that accustomed station in\r\nGuildhall where they appear as the tutelary genii of the city, and were\r\nseen rearing up their stately height on each side of Temple-bar. With\r\njoined hands they supported above the gate a copy of Latin verses, in\r\nwhich they obligingly expounded to her majesty the sense of all the\r\npageants which had been offered to her view, concluding with compliments\r\nand felicitations suitable to the happy occasion. The queen, in few but\r\ncordial words, thanked the citizens for all their cost and pains,\r\nassured them that she would \"stand their good queen,\" and passed the\r\ngate amid a thunder of applause.\r\n\r\nElizabeth possessed in a higher degree than any other English prince who\r\never reigned, the innocent and honest arts of popularity; and the\r\nfollowing traits of her behaviour on this day are recorded by our\r\nchroniclers with affectionate delight. \"'Yonder is an ancient citizen,'\r\nsaid one of the knights attending on her person, 'which weepeth and\r\nturneth his face backward: How may it be interpreted? that he doth so\r\nfor sorrow or for gladness?' With a just and pleasing confidence, the\r\nqueen replied, 'I warrant you it is for gladness,'\" \"How many nosegays\r\ndid her grace receive at poor women's hands! How many times staid she\r\nher chariot when she saw any simple body offer to speak to her grace! A\r\nbranch of rosemary given her grace with a supplication by a poor woman\r\nabout Fleet-bridge was seen in her chariot till her grace came to\r\nWestminster[39].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 39: Holinshed's Chronicles.]\r\n\r\nThe reader may here be reminded, that five-and-twenty years before, when\r\nthe mother of this queen passed through London to her coronation, the\r\npageants exhibited derived their personages and allusions chiefly from\r\npagan mythology or classical fiction. But all was now changed; the\r\nearnestness of religious controversy in Edward's time, and the fury of\r\npersecution since, had put to flight Apollo, the Muses, and the Graces:\r\nLearning indeed had kept her station and her honors, but she had lent\r\nher lamp to other studies, and whether in the tongue of ancient Rome or\r\nmodern England, Elizabeth was hailed in Christian strains, and as the\r\nsovereign of a Christian country. A people filled with earnest zeal in\r\nthe best of causes implored her to free them once again from popery; to\r\noverthrow the tyranny of error and of superstition; to establish gospel\r\ntruth; and to accept at their hands, as the standard of her faith and\r\nthe rule of her conduct, that holy book of which they regarded the free\r\nand undisturbed possession as their brightest privilege.\r\n\r\nHow tame, how puerile, in the midst of sentiments serious and profound\r\nas these, would have appeared the intrusion of classical imagery,\r\nhowever graceful in itself or ingenious in its application! Frigid must\r\nhave been the spectator who could even have remarked its absence, while\r\nshouts of patriotic ardor and of religious joy were bursting from the\r\nlips of the whole assembled population.\r\n\r\nThe august ceremonies of the coronation, which took place on the\r\nfollowing day, merit no particular description; regulated in every thing\r\nby ancient custom, they afforded little scope for that display of\r\npopular sentiment which had given so intense an interest to the\r\nprocession of the day before. Great perplexity was occasioned by the\r\nrefusal of the whole bench of bishops to perform the coronation service;\r\nbut at length, to the displeasure of his brethren, Ogelthorp bishop of\r\nCarlisle suffered himself to be gained over, and the rite was duly\r\ncelebrated. This refractoriness of the episcopal order was wisely\r\noverlooked for the present by the new government; but it proceeded no\r\ndoubt from the principle, that, the marriage of Henry VIII. with\r\nCatherine of Arragon having been declared lawful and valid, the child of\r\nAnne Boleyn must be regarded as illegitimate and incapable of the\r\nsuccession. The compliance of Ogelthorp could indeed be censured by the\r\nother bishops on no other ground than their disallowance of the title of\r\nthe sovereign; in the office itself, as he performed it, there was\r\nnothing to which the most rigid catholic could object, for the ancient\r\nritual is said to have been followed without the slightest modification.\r\nThis circumstance has been adduced among others, to show that it was\r\nrather by the political necessities of her situation, than by her\r\nprivate judgement and conscience in religious matters, that Elizabeth\r\nwas impelled finally to abjure the Roman catholic system, and to declare\r\nherself the general protectress of the protestant cause.\r\n\r\nProbably, had she found herself free to follow entirely the dictates of\r\nher own inclinations, she would have established in the church of which\r\nshe found herself the head, a kind of middle scheme like that devised by\r\nher father, for whose authority she was impressed with the highest\r\nveneration. To the end of her days she could never be reconciled to\r\nmarried bishops; indeed with respect to the clergy generally, a\r\nsagacious writer of her own time observes, that \"_caeteris paribus_, and\r\nsometimes _imparibus_ too, she preferred the single man before the\r\nmarried[40].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 40: Harrington's \"Brief View.\"]\r\n\r\nShe would allow no one \"to speak irreverently of the sacrament of the\r\naltar;\" that is, to enter into discussions respecting the real presence;\r\nshe enjoined the like respectful silence concerning the intercession of\r\nsaints; and we learn that one Patch, who had been Wolsey's fool, and had\r\ncontrived, like some others, to keep in favor through all the changes of\r\nfour successive reigns, was employed by sir Francis Knolles to break\r\ndown a crucifix which she still retained in her private chapel to the\r\nscandal of all good protestants.\r\n\r\nA remarkable incident soon served to intimate the coolness and caution\r\nwith which it was her intention to proceed in re-establishing the\r\nmaxims of the reformers. Lord Bacon thus relates the anecdote: \"Queen\r\nElizabeth on the morrow of her coronation (it being the custom to\r\nrelease prisoners at the inauguration of a prince) went to the chapel;\r\nand in the great chamber one of her courtiers, who was well known to\r\nher, either out of his own motion, or by the instigation of a wiser man,\r\npresented her with a petition, and before a great number of courtiers\r\nbesought her with a loud voice that now this good time there might be\r\nfour or five more principal prisoners released: these were the four\r\nevangelists, and the apostle St. Paul, who had been long shut up in an\r\nunknown tongue, as it were in prison; so as they could not converse with\r\nthe common people. The queen answered very gravely, that it was best\r\nfirst to inquire of themselves whether they would be released or\r\nnot[41].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 41: Bacon's \"Apophthegms.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, ere this happy deliverance was fully effected.\r\nBefore her coronation, Elizabeth had taken the important step of\r\nauthorizing the reading of the liturgy in English; but she forbade\r\npreaching on controverted topics generally, and all preaching at Paul's\r\nCross in particular, till the completion of that revision of the service\r\nused in the time of Edward VI. which she had intrusted to Parker\r\narchbishop-elect of Canterbury, with several of her wisest counsellors.\r\nIt was the zeal of the ministers lately returned from exile, many of\r\nwhom had imbibed at Geneva or Zurich ideas of a primitive simplicity in\r\nChristian worship widely remote from the views and sentiments of the\r\nqueen, which gave occasion to this prohibition. The learning, the piety,\r\nthe past sufferings of the men gave them great power over the minds and\r\nopinions of the people, who ran in crowds to listen to their sermons;\r\nand Elizabeth began already to apprehend that the hierarchy which she\r\ndesired to establish would stand as much in need of protection from the\r\ndisciples of Calvin and Zwingle on one hand, as from the adherents of\r\npopery on the other.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe, that a royal proclamation issued some\r\ntime after, by which all manner of plays and interludes were forbidden\r\nto be represented till after the ensuing hallowmass, was dictated by\r\nsimilar reasons of state with the prohibition of popular and unlicensed\r\npreaching.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest beginnings of the reformation under Henry VIII. the\r\nstage had come in aid of the pulpit; not, according to the practice of\r\nits purer ages, as the \"teacher best of moral wisdom, with delight\r\nreceived,\" but as the vehicle of religious controversy, and not seldom\r\nof polemical scurrility. Several times already had this dangerous\r\nnovelty attracted the jealous eyes of authority, and measures had in\r\nvain been taken for its suppression.\r\n\r\nIn 1542 Henry added to an edict for the destruction of Tyndale's English\r\nbible, with all the controversial works on both sides of which it had\r\nbeen the fertile parent, an injunction that \"the kingdom should be\r\npurged and cleansed of all religious plays, interludes, rhymes, ballads,\r\nand songs, which are equally pestiferous and noisome to the peace of\r\nthe church.\" During the reign of Edward, when the papists had availed\r\nthemselves of the license of the theatre to attack Cranmer and the\r\nprotector, a similar prohibition was issued against all dramatic\r\nperformances, as tending to the growth of \"disquiet, division, tumults\r\nand uproars.\" Mary's privy-council, on the other hand, found it\r\nnecessary to address a remonstrance to the president of the North,\r\nrespecting certain players, servants to sir Francis Lake, who had gone\r\nabout the country representing pieces in ridicule of the king and queen\r\nand the formalities of the mass; and the design of the proclamation of\r\nElizabeth was rendered evident by a solemn enactment of heavy penalties\r\nagainst such as should abuse the Common-prayer in any interludes, songs,\r\nor rhymes[42].\r\n\r\n[Note 42: Warton's \"History of English Poetry,\" vol. iii. p. 202 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1559.\r\n\r\nMeeting of parliament.--Prudent counsel of sir N.

By the eminently prudent and judicious\r\ncounsels of sir Nicholas Bacon keeper of the seals, she omitted to\r\nrequire of parliament the repeal of those acts of her father's reign\r\nwhich had declared his marriage with her mother null, and herself\r\nillegitimate; and reposing on the acknowledged maxim of law, that the\r\ncrown once worn takes away all defects in blood, she contented herself\r\nwith an act declaratory in general terms of her right of succession.\r\nThus the whole perplexing subject of her mother's character and conduct\r\nwas consigned to an oblivion equally safe and decent; and the memory of\r\nher father, which, in spite of all his acts of violence and injustice,\r\nwas popular in the nation and respected by herself, was saved from the\r\nstigma which the vindication of Anne Boleyn must have impressed\r\nindelibly upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the other topic she explained herself with an earnest sincerity which\r\nmight have freed her from all further importunity in any concern less\r\ninteresting to the wishes of her people. To a deputation from the house\r\nof commons with an address, \"the special matter whereof was to move her\r\ngrace to marriage,\" after a gracious reception, she delivered an answer\r\nin which the following passages are remarkable.\r\n\r\n\"...From my years of understanding, sith I first had consideration of my\r\nlife, to be born a servitor of almighty God, I happily chose this kind\r\nof life, in the which I yet live; which I assure you for mine own part\r\nhath hitherto best contented myself, and I trust hath been most\r\nacceptable unto God. From the which, if either ambition of high estate,\r\noffered to me in marriage by the pleasure and appointment of my prince,\r\nwhereof I have some records in this presence (as you our treasurer well\r\nknow); or if eschewing the danger of mine enemies, or the avoiding of\r\nthe peril of death, whose messenger, or rather a continual watchman, the\r\nprince's indignation, was no little time daily before mine eyes, (by\r\nwhose means although I know, or justly may suspect, yet I will not now\r\nutter, or if the whole cause were in my sister herself, I will not now\r\nburden her therewith, because I will not charge the dead): if any of\r\nthese, I say, could have drawn or dissuaded me from this kind of life, I\r\nhad not now remained in this estate wherein you see me; but so constant\r\nhave I always continued in this determination, although my youth and\r\nwords may seem to some hardly to agree together; yet it is most true\r\nthat at this day I stand free from any other meaning that either I have\r\nhad in times past, or have at this present.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat haughty assurance that she takes the recommendation of\r\nthe parliament in good part, because it contains no limitation of place\r\nor person, which she should have regarded as great presumption in them,\r\n\"whose duties are to obey,\" and \"not to require them that may command;\"\r\nhaving declared that should she change her resolution, she will choose\r\none for her husband who shall, if possible, be as careful for the realm\r\nas herself, she thus concludes: \"And in the end, this shall be for me\r\nsufficient, that a marble stone shall declare, that a queen, having\r\nreigned such a time, lived and died a virgin.\"\r\n\r\nOne matrimonial proposal her majesty had already received, and that at\r\nonce the most splendid and the least suitable which Europe could afford.\r\nPhilip of Spain, loth to relinquish his hold upon England, but long\r\nsince aware of the impracticability of establishing any claims of his\r\nown in opposition to the title of Elizabeth, now sought to reign by her;\r\nand to the formal announcement which she conveyed to him of the death of\r\nhis late wife, accompanied with expressions of her anxiety to preserve\r\nhis friendship, he had replied by an offer of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe objections to this union were so peculiarly forcible, and so obvious\r\nto every eye, that it appears at first view almost incredible that the\r\nproposal should have been made, as it yet undoubtedly was, seriously and\r\nwith strong expectations of success. But Philip, himself a politician,\r\nbelieved Elizabeth to be one also; and he flattered himself that he\r\nshould be able to point out such advantages in the connexion as might\r\nover-balance in her mind any scruples of patriotism, of feeling, or of\r\nconscience. She stood alone, the last of her father's house, unsupported\r\nat home by the authority of a powerful royal family, or abroad by great\r\nalliances. The queen of Scots, whom few of the subjects of Elizabeth\r\ndenied to be next heir to the crown, and whose claim was by most of the\r\ncatholics held preferable to her own, was married to the dauphin of\r\nFrance, consequently her title would be upheld by the whole force of\r\nthat country, with which, as well as with Scotland, Elizabeth at her\r\naccession had found the nation involved in an unsuccessful war. The loss\r\nof Calais, the decay of trade, the failure of the exchequer, and the\r\nrecent visitations of famine and pestilence, had infected the minds of\r\nthe English with despondency, and paralysed all their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn religion they were confessedly a divided people; but it is probable\r\nthat Philip, misled by his own zeal and that of the catholic clergy,\r\nconfidently anticipated the extirpation of heresy and the final triumph\r\nof the papal system, if the measures of _salutary rigor_ which had\r\ndistinguished the reign of Mary should be persisted in by her successor;\r\nand that he actually supposed the majority of the nation to be at this\r\ntime sincerely and cordially catholic. In offering therefore his hand to\r\nElizabeth, he seemed to lend her that powerful aid against her foreign\r\nfoe and rival without which her possession of the throne could not be\r\nsecure, and that support against domestic faction without which it could\r\nnot be tranquil. He readily undertook to procure from the pope the\r\nnecessary dispensation for the marriage, which he was certain would be\r\ngranted with alacrity; and before the answer of Elizabeth could reach\r\nhim, he had actually dispatched envoys to Rome for this purpose.\r\n\r\nA princess, in fact, of a character less firm and less sagacious than\r\nElizabeth, might have found in these seeming benefits temptations not to\r\nbe resisted; the splendor of Philip's rank and power would have dazzled\r\nand overawed, the difficulties of her own situation would have\r\naffrighted her, and between ambition and alarm she would probably have\r\nthrown herself into the arms, and abandoned her country to the mercy, of\r\na gloomy, calculating, relentless tyrant.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth was neither to be deceived nor intimidated. She well knew\r\nhow odious this very marriage had rendered her unhappy sister; she\r\nunderstood and sympathized in the religious sentiments of the great\r\nmass of her subjects; she felt too all the pride, as well as the\r\nfelicity, of independence; and looking around with a cheerful confidence\r\non a people who adored her, she formed at once the patriotic resolution\r\nto wear her English diadem by the suffrage of the English nation alone,\r\nunindebted to the protection and free from the participation of any\r\nbrother-monarch living, even of him who held the highest place among the\r\npotentates of Europe.\r\n\r\nHer best and wisest counsellors applauded her decision, but they\r\nunanimously advised that no means consistent with the rejection of his\r\nsuit should be omitted, by which the friendship of the king of Spain\r\nmight be preserved and cultivated. Expedients were accordingly found,\r\nwithout actually encouraging his hopes, for protracting the negotiation\r\ntill a peace was concluded with France and with Scotland, and finally of\r\ndeclining the marriage without a breach of amity. Yet the duke de Feria,\r\nthe Spanish ambassador, had not failed to represent to the queen, that\r\nas the addresses of his master were founded on personal acquaintance and\r\nhigh admiration of her charms and merit, a negative could not be\r\nreturned without wounding equally his pride and his feelings. Philip,\r\nhowever, soon consoled himself for this disappointment by taking to wife\r\nthe daughter of the king of France; and before the end of the year we\r\nfind him recommending to Elizabeth as a husband his cousin the archduke\r\nCharles, son of the emperor Ferdinand. The overture was at this time\r\ndeclined by the queen without hesitation; but some time afterwards,\r\ncircumstances arose which caused the negotiation to be resumed with\r\nprospect of success, and the pretensions and qualifications of the\r\nAustrian prince became, as we shall see, an object of serious\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nEric, who had now ascended the throne of Sweden, sent his brother the\r\nduke of Finland to plead once more with the English princess in his\r\nbehalf; and the king of Denmark, unwilling that his neighbour should\r\nbear off without a contest so glorious a prize, lost no time in sending\r\nforth on the same high adventure his nephew the duke of Holstein. It is\r\nmore than probable that Shakespear, in his description of the wooers of\r\nall countries who contend for the possession of the fair and wealthy\r\nPortia[43], satirically alludes to several of these royal suitors, whose\r\ndeparture would often be accounted by his sovereign \"a gentle ridance,\"\r\nsince she might well exclaim with the Italian heiress, \"while we shut\r\nthe gate on one wooer, another knocks at the door.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 43: See \"The Merchant of Venice.\"]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Finland was received with high honors. The earl of Oxford\r\nand lord Robert Dudley repaired to him at Colchester and conducted him\r\ninto London. At the corner of Gracechurch-street he was received by the\r\nmarquis of Northampton and lord Ambrose Dudley, attended by many\r\ngentlemen, and, what seems remarkable, by ladies also; and thence,\r\nfollowed by a great troop of gentlemen in gold chains and yeomen of the\r\nguard, he proceeded to the bishop of Winchester's palace in Southwark,\r\n\"which was hung with rich cloth of arras, and wrought with gold and\r\nsilver and silks. And there he remained.\"\r\n\r\nOn the last circumstance it may be remarked, that it appears at this\r\ntime to have been the invariable custom for ambassadors and other royal\r\nvisitants to be lodged at some private house, where they were\r\nentertained, nominally perhaps at the expense of the sovereign, but\r\nreally to the great cost as well as inconvenience of the selected host.\r\nThe practice discovers a kind of feudal right of ownership still claimed\r\nby the prince in the mansions of his barons, some of which indeed were\r\nroyal castles or manor-houses and held perhaps under peculiar\r\nobligations: at the same time it gives us a magnificent idea of the size\r\nand accommodation of these mansions and of the style of house-keeping\r\nused in them. It further intimates that an habitual distrust of these\r\nforeign guests caused it to be regarded as a point of prudence to place\r\nthem under the secret inspection of some native of approved loyalty and\r\ndiscretion. Prisoners of state, as well as ambassadors and royal\r\nstrangers, were thus committed to the private custody of peers or\r\nbishops.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Holstein on his arrival was lodged at Somerset Place, of\r\nwhich the queen had granted the use to lord Hunsdon. He came, it seems,\r\nwith sanguine expectations of success in his suit; but the royal fair\r\none deemed it sufficient to acknowledge his pains by an honorable\r\nreception, the order of the garter, and the grant of a yearly pension.\r\n\r\nMeantime the queen herself, with equal assiduity and better success than\r\nawaited these princely wooers, was applying her cares to gain the\r\naffections of her subjects of every class, and if possible of both\r\nreligious denominations.\r\n\r\nOn her young kinsman the duke of Norfolk, the first peer of the realm by\r\nrank, property, and great alliances, and the most popular by his known\r\nattachment to the protestant faith, she now conferred the distinction of\r\nthe garter, decorating with it at the same time the marquis of\r\nNorthampton, the earl of Rutland, and lord Robert Dudley.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, a brother of queen Catherine Parr, whom he resembled in the\r\nturn of his religious opinions, had been for these opinions a great\r\nsufferer under the last reign. On pretext of his adherence to the cause\r\nof Jane Grey, in which he had certainly not partaken more deeply than\r\nmany others who found nothing but favor in the sight of Mary, he was\r\nattainted of high treason, and though his life was spared, his estates\r\nwere forfeited and he had remained ever since in disgrace and suspicion.\r\nA divorce which he had obtained from an unfaithful wife under the\r\necclesiastical law of Henry VIII. was also called in question, and an\r\nafter marriage which he had contracted declared null, but it appears to\r\nhave been confirmed under Elizabeth. He was accounted a modest and\r\nupright character, endowed with no great talents for military command,\r\nin which he had been unsuccessful, nor yet for civil business; but\r\ndistinguished by a fine taste in music and poetry, which formed his\r\nchief delight. From the new sovereign substantial benefits as well as\r\nflattering distinctions awaited him, being reinstated by her in the\r\npossession of his confiscated estates and appointed a privy-councillor.\r\n\r\nHenry second earl of Rutland of the surname of Manners, was the\r\nrepresentative of a knightly family seated during many generations at\r\nEttal in Northumberland, and known in border history amongst the\r\nstoutest champions on the English side. But Ettal, a place of strength,\r\nwas more than once laid in ruins, and the lands devastated and rendered\r\n\"nothing worth,\" by incursions of the Scots; and though successive kings\r\nrewarded the services and compensated the losses of these valiant\r\nknights, by grants of land and appointments to honorable offices in the\r\nnorth, it was many an age before they attained to such a degree of\r\nwealth as would enable them to appear with distinction amongst the great\r\nfamilies of the kingdom. At length sir Robert Manners, high sheriff of\r\nNorthumberland, having recommended himself to the favor of the\r\nking-making Warwick and of Richard duke of Gloucester, was fortunate\r\nenough by a judicious marriage with the daughter of lord Roos, heiress\r\nof the Tiptofts earls of Worcester, to add the noble castle and fertile\r\nvale of Belvoir to the battered towers and wasted fields of his paternal\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nA second splendid alliance completed the aggrandizement of the house of\r\nManners. The son of sir Robert, bearing in right of his mother the title\r\nof lord Roos, and knighted by the earl of Surry for his distinguished\r\nbravery in the Scottish wars, was honored with the hand of Anne sole\r\nheiress of sir Thomas St. Leger by the duchess-dowager of Exeter, a\r\nsister of king Edward IV. The heir of this marriage, in consideration\r\nof his maternal ancestry, was advanced by Henry VIII. to the title of\r\nearl of Rutland, never borne but by princes of the blood. His successor,\r\nwhom the queen was pleased to honor on this occasion, had suffered a\r\nshort imprisonment in the cause of Jane Grey, but was afterwards\r\nintrusted by Mary with a military command. Under Elizabeth he was lord\r\nlieutenant of the counties of Nottingham and Rutland, and one of the\r\ncommissioners for enforcing the oath of supremacy on all persons in\r\noffices of trust or profit suspected of adherence to the old religion.\r\nHe died in 1563.\r\n\r\nOf lord Robert Dudley it is only necessary here to observe, that his\r\nfavor with the queen became daily more apparent, and began to give fears\r\nand jealousies to her best friends and wisest counsellors.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the common people, as this wise princess well knew, were\r\neasily and cheaply to be won by gratifying their eyes with the frequent\r\nview of her royal person, and she neglected no opportunity of offering\r\nherself, all smiles and affability, to their ready acclamations.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she passed publicly through the city to visit the mint\r\nand inspect the new coinage, which she had the great merit of restoring\r\nto its just standard from the extremely depreciated state to which it\r\nhad been brought by the successive encroachments of her immediate\r\npredecessors. Another time she visited the dissolved priory of St. Mary\r\nSpittle in Bishopsgate-street, which was noted for its pulpit-cross,\r\nwhere, on set days, the lord-mayor and aldermen attended to hear\r\nsermons. It is conjectured that the queen went thither for the same\r\npurpose; but if this were the case, her equipage was somewhat whimsical.\r\nShe was attended, as Stow informs us, by a thousand men in harness with\r\nshirts of mail and corselets and morice-pikes, and ten great pieces\r\ncarried through the city unto the court, with drums and trumpets\r\nsounding, and two morice dancings, and in a cart two white bears.\r\n\r\nHaving supped one afternoon with the earl of Pembroke at Baynard's\r\ncastle in Thames-street, she afterwards took boat and was rowed up and\r\ndown the river, \"hundreds of boats and barges rowing about her, and\r\nthousands of people thronging at the water side to look upon her\r\nmajesty; rejoicing to see her, and partaking of the music and sights\r\nupon the Thames.\"\r\n\r\nThis peer was the offspring of a base-born son of William Herbert earl\r\nof Pembroke, and coming early to court to push his fortune, became an\r\nesquire of the body to Henry VIII. Soon ingratiating himself with this\r\nmonarch, he obtained from his customary profusion towards his favorites,\r\nseveral offices in Wales and enormous grants of abbey-lands in some of\r\nthe southern counties. In the year 1554, the 37th of his age, we find\r\nhim considerable enough to procure the king's license \"to retain thirty\r\npersons at his will and pleasure, over and above such persons as\r\nattended on him, and to give them his livery, badges, and cognizance.\"\r\nThe king's marriage with Catherine Parr, his wife's sister, increased\r\nhis consequence, and Henry on his death-bed appointed him one of his\r\nexecutors and a member of the young king's council. He was actively\r\nuseful in the beginning of Edward's reign in keeping down commotions in\r\nWales and suppressing some which had arisen in Wiltshire and\r\nSomersetshire. This service obtained for him the office of master of the\r\nhorse; and that more important service which he afterwards performed at\r\nthe head of one thousand Welshmen, with whom he took the field against\r\nthe Cornish rebels, was rewarded by the garter, the presidency of the\r\ncouncil for Wales, and a valuable wardship. He figured next as commander\r\nof part of the forces in Picardy and governor of Calais, and found\r\nhimself strong enough to claim of the feeble protector as his reward the\r\ntitles of baron Herbert and earl of Pembroke, become extinct by the\r\nfailure of legitimate heirs. As soon as his sagacity prognosticated the\r\nfall of Somerset, he judiciously attached himself to the rising fortunes\r\nof Northumberland. With this aspiring leader it was an object of prime\r\nimportance to purchase the support of a nobleman who now appeared at the\r\nhead of three hundred retainers, and whose authority in Wales and the\r\nsouthern counties was equal, or superior, to the hereditary influence of\r\nthe most powerful and ancient houses. To engage him therefore the more\r\nfirmly in his interest, Northumberland proposed a marriage between\r\nPembroke's son lord Herbert and lady Catherine Grey, which was\r\nsolemnized at the same time with that between lord Guildford Dudley and\r\nthe lady Jane her eldest sister.\r\n\r\nBut no ties of friendship or alliance could permanently engage Pembroke\r\non the losing side; and though he concurred in the first measures of the\r\nprivy-council in behalf of lady Jane's title, it was he who devised a\r\npretext for extricating its members from the Tower, where Northumberland\r\nhad detained them in order to secure their fidelity, and, assembling\r\nthem in Baynard's castle, procured their concurrence in the proclamation\r\nof Mary. By this act he secured the favor of the new queen, whom he\r\nfurther propitiated by compelling his son to repudiate the innocent and\r\nill-fated lady Catherine, whose birth caused her to be regarded at court\r\nwith jealous eyes. Mary soon confided to him the charge of effectually\r\nsuppressing Wyat's rebellion, and afterwards constituted him her\r\ncaptain-general beyond the seas, in which capacity he commanded the\r\nEnglish forces at the battle of St. Quintin's. Such was the respect\r\nentertained for his experience and capacity, that Elizabeth admitted him\r\nto her privy-council immediately after her accession, and as a still\r\nhigher mark of her confidence named him,--with the marquis of\r\nNorthampton, the earl of Bedford, and lord John Grey, leading men of the\r\nprotestant party,--to assist at the meetings of divines and men of\r\nlearning by whom the religious establishment of the country was to be\r\nsettled. He was likewise appointed a commissioner for administering the\r\noath of supremacy. In short, he retained to his death, which occurred in\r\n1570, in the 63d year of his age, the same high station among the\r\nconfidential servants of the crown which he had held unmoved through all\r\nthe mutations of the eventful period of his public life.\r\n\r\nNaunton, in his \"Fragmenta Regalia,\" speaking of Paulet marquis of\r\nWinchester and lord-treasurer, who, he says, had then served four\r\nprinces \"in as various and changeable season that well I may say,\r\nneither time nor age hath yielded the like precedent,\" thus proceeds:\r\n\"This man being noted to grow high in her\" (queen Elizabeth's) \"favor,\r\nas his place and experience required, was questioned by an intimate\r\nfriend of his, how he stood up for thirty years together amidst the\r\nchanges and reigns of so many chancellors and great personages. 'Why,'\r\nquoth the marquis, 'ortus sum ex salice, non ex quercu.' (By being a\r\nwillow and not an oak). And truly the old man hath taught them all,\r\nespecially William earl of Pembroke, for they two were ever of the\r\nking's religion, and over-zealous professors. Of these it is said, that\r\nboth younger brothers, yet of noble houses, they spent what was left\r\nthem and came on trust to the court; where, upon the bare stock of their\r\nwits, they began to traffic for themselves, and prospered so well, that\r\nthey got, spent, and left, more than any subjects from the Norman\r\nconquest to their own times: whereunto it hath been prettily replied,\r\nthat they lived in a time of dissolution.--Of any of the former reign,\r\nit is said that these two lived and died chiefly in the queen's favor.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the means employed by Pembroke for preserving the good graces of\r\nthe new queen, the obvious one of paying court to her prime favorite\r\nRobert Dudley was not neglected; and lord Herbert, whose first marriage\r\nhad been contracted in compliance with the views of the father, now\r\nformed a third in obedience to the wishes of the son. The lady to whom\r\nhe was thus united by motives in which inclination had probably no share\r\non either side, was the niece of Dudley and sister of sir Philip Sidney,\r\none of the most accomplished women of her age, celebrated during her\r\nlife by the wits and poets whom she patronized, and preserved in the\r\nmemory of posterity by an epitaph from the pen of Ben Jonson which will\r\nnot be forgotten whilst English poetry remains.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of ambassadors of high rank from France, on occasion of the\r\npeace recently concluded with that country, afforded the queen an\r\nopportunity of displaying all the magnificence of her court; and their\r\nentertainment has furnished for the curious inquirer in later times some\r\namusing traits of the half-barbarous manners of the age. The duke de\r\nMontmorenci, the head of the embassy, was lodged at the bishop of\r\nLondon's, and the houses of the dean and canons of St. Paul's were\r\nentirely filled with his numerous retinue. The gorgeousness of the\r\nambassador's dress was thought remarkable even in those gorgeous times.\r\nThe day after their arrival they were conducted in state to court, where\r\nthey supped with the queen, and afterwards partook of a \"goodly\r\nbanquet,\" with all manner of entertainment till midnight. The next day\r\nher majesty gave them a sumptuous dinner, followed by a baiting of bulls\r\nand bears. \"The queen's grace herself\" stood with them in a gallery,\r\nlooking on the pastime, till six o'clock, when they returned by water to\r\nsup with the bishop their host. On the following day they were\r\nconducted to the Paris Garden, then a favorite place of amusement on the\r\nSurry side of the Thames, and there regaled with another exhibition of\r\nbull and bear baiting. Two days afterwards they departed, \"taking their\r\nbarge towards Gravesend,\" highly delighted, it is to be hoped, with the\r\nelegant taste of the English in public diversions, and carrying with\r\nthem a number of mastiffs, given them to hunt wolves in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all outward shows of amity with France, Elizabeth\r\nhad great cause to apprehend that the pretensions of the queen of Scots\r\nand her husband the dauphin, who had openly assumed the royal arms of\r\nEngland, might soon reinvolve her in hostilities with that country and\r\nwith Scotland; and it consequently became a point of policy with her to\r\nanimate by means of military spectacles, graced with her royal presence\r\nand encouragement, the warlike preparations of her subjects. She was now\r\nestablished for a time in her favorite summer-palace of Greenwich, and\r\nthe London companies were ordered to make a muster of their men at arms\r\nin the adjoining park.\r\n\r\nThe employment of fire-arms had not as yet consigned to disuse either\r\nthe defensive armour or the weapons of offence of the middle ages; and\r\nthe military arrays of that time amused the eye of the spectator with a\r\nrich variety of accoutrement far more picturesque in its details, and\r\nprobably more striking even in its general effect, than that magnificent\r\nuniformity which, at a modern review, dazzles but soon satiates the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nOf the fourteen hundred men whom the metropolis sent forth on this\r\noccasion, eight hundred, armed in fine corselets, bore the long Moorish\r\npike; two hundred were halberdiers wearing a different kind of armour,\r\ncalled Almain rivets; and the gunners, or musketeers, were equipped in\r\nshirts of mail, with morions or steel caps. Her majesty, surrounded by a\r\nsplendid court, beheld all their evolutions from a gallery over the park\r\ngate, and finally dismissed them, confirmed in loyalty and valor by\r\npraises, thanks, and smiles of graciousness.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the queen's pensioners were appointed \"to run with\r\nthe spear,\" and this chivalrous exhibition was accompanied with such\r\ncircumstances of romantic decoration as peculiarly delighted the fancy\r\nof Elizabeth. She caused to be erected for her in Greenwich park a\r\nbanqueting-house \"made with fir poles and decked with birch branches and\r\nall manner of flowers both of the field and the garden, as roses,\r\njulyflowers, lavender, marygolds, and all manner of strewing-herbs and\r\nrushes.\" Tents were also set up for her household, and a place was\r\nprepared for the tilters. After the exercises were over, the queen gave\r\na supper in the banqueting-house, succeeded by a masque, and that by a\r\nsplendid banquet. \"And then followed great casting of fire and shooting\r\nof guns till midnight.\"\r\n\r\nThis band of gentlemen pensioners, the boast and ornament of the court\r\nof Elizabeth, was probably the most splendid establishment of the kind\r\nin Europe. It was entirely composed of the flower of the nobility and\r\ngentry, and to be admitted to serve in its ranks was during the whole of\r\nthe reign regarded as a distinction worthy the ambition of young men of\r\nthe highest families and most brilliant prospects. Sir John Holles,\r\nafterwards earl of Clare, was accustomed to say, that while he was a\r\npensioner to queen Elizabeth, he did not know _a worse man_ in the whole\r\nband than himself; yet he was then in possession of an inheritance of\r\nfour thousand a year. \"It was the constant custom of that queen,\"\r\npursues the earl's biographer, \"to call out of all counties of the\r\nkingdom, the gentlemen of the greatest hopes and the best fortunes and\r\nfamilies, and with them to fill the more honorable rooms of her\r\nhousehold servants, by which she honored them, obliged their kindred and\r\nalliance, and fortified herself[44].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 44: Collins's \"Historical Collections.\"]\r\n\r\nOn this point of policy it deserves to be remarked, that however it\r\nmight strengthen the personal influence of the sovereign to enroll\r\namongst the menial servants of the crown gentlemen of influence and\r\nproperty, it is chiefly perhaps to this practice that we ought to impute\r\nthat baseness of servility which infected, with scarcely one honorable\r\nexception, the public characters of the reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nOn July 17th the queen set out on the first of those royal _progresses_\r\nwhich form so striking a feature in the domestic history of her reign.\r\nIn them, as in most of the recreations in which she at any time indulged\r\nherself, Elizabeth sought to unite political utilities with the\r\ngratification of her taste for magnificence, and especially for\r\nadmiration. It has also been surmised, that she was not inattentive to\r\nthe savings occasioned to her privy purse by maintaining her household\r\nfor several weeks in every year at the expense of her nobles, or of the\r\ntowns through which she passed; and it must be admitted that more than\r\none disgraceful instance might be pointed out, of a great man obliged to\r\npurchase the continuance or restoration of her favor by soliciting the\r\nalmost ruinous honor of a royal visit. On the whole, however, her\r\ndeportment on these occasions warrants the conclusion, that an earnest\r\nand constant desire of popularity was her principal motive for\r\npersevering to the latest period of her life to encounter the fatigue of\r\nthese frequent journeys, and of the acts of public representation which\r\nthey imposed upon her.\r\n\r\n\"In her progress,\" says an acute and lively delineator of her character,\r\n\"she was most easy to be approached; private persons and magistrates,\r\nmen and women, country-people and children, came joyfully and without\r\nany fear to wait upon her and see her. Her ears were then open to the\r\ncomplaints of the afflicted and of those that had been any way injured.\r\nShe would not suffer the meanest of her people to be shut out from the\r\nplaces where she resided, but the greatest and the least were then in a\r\nmanner levelled. She took with her own hand, and read with the greatest\r\ngoodness, the petitions of the meanest rustics. And she would frequently\r\nassure them that she would take a particular care of their affairs, and\r\nshe would ever be as good as her word. She was never seen angry with\r\nthe most unseasonable or uncourtly approach; she was never offended with\r\nthe most impudent or importunate petitioner. Nor was there any thing in\r\nthe whole course of her reign that more won the hearts of the people\r\nthan this her wonderful facility, condescension, and the sweetness and\r\npleasantness with which she entertained all that came to her[45].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 45: Bohun's \"Character of Queen Elizabeth.\"]\r\n\r\nThe first stage of the queen's progress was to Dartford in Kent, where\r\nHenry VIII., whose profusion in the article of royal residences was\r\nextreme, had fitted up a dissolved priory as a palace for himself and\r\nhis successors. Elizabeth kept this mansion in her own hands during the\r\nwhole of her reign, and once more, after an interval of several years,\r\nis recorded to have passed two days under its roof. James I. granted it\r\nto the earl of Salisbury: the lords Darcy were afterwards its owners.\r\nThe embattled gatehouse with an adjoining wing, all that remains in\r\nhabitable condition, are at the present time occupied as a farm house;\r\nwhile foundations of walls running along the neighbouring fields to a\r\nconsiderable distance, alone attest the magnitude, and leave to be\r\nimagined the splendor, of the ancient edifice. Such is at this day the\r\ncommon fate of the castles of our ancient barons, the mansions of our\r\nnobles of a following age, and the palaces of the Plantagenets, the\r\nTudors, and the Stuarts!\r\n\r\nFrom Dartford she proceeded to Cobham Hall,--an exception to the general\r\nrule,--for this venerable mansion is at present the noble seat of the\r\nearl of Darnley; and though the centre has been rebuilt in a more modern\r\nstyle, the wings remain untouched, and in one of them the apartment\r\noccupied by the queen on this visit is still pointed out to the\r\nstranger. She was here sumptuously entertained by William lord Cobham, a\r\nnobleman who enjoyed a considerable share of her favor, and who, after\r\nacquitting himself to her satisfaction in an embassy to the\r\nLow-Countries, was rewarded with the garter and the place of a\r\nprivy-councillor. He was however a person of no conspicuous ability, and\r\nhis wealth and his loyalty appear to have been his principal titles of\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nEltham was her next stage; an ancient palace frequently commemorated in\r\nthe history of our early kings as the scene of rude magnificence and\r\nboundless hospitality. In 1270 Henry III. kept a grand Christmas at\r\nEaldham palace,--so it was then called. A son of Edward II. was named\r\nJohn of Eltham, from its being the place of his birth.\r\n\r\nEdward III. twice held his parliament in its capacious hall. It was\r\nrepaired at great cost by Edward IV., who made it a frequent place of\r\nresidence; but Henry VIII. began to neglect it for Greenwich, and\r\nElizabeth was the last sovereign by whom it was visited.\r\n\r\nIts hall, 100 feet in length, with a beautifully carved roof resembling\r\nthat of Westminster-hall and windows adorned with all the elegance of\r\ngothic tracery, is still in being, and admirably serves the purposes of\r\na barn and granary.\r\n\r\nElizabeth soon quitted this seat of antique grandeur to contemplate the\r\ngay magnificence of Nonsuch, regarded as the triumph of her father's\r\ntaste and the masterpiece of all the decorative arts. This stately\r\nedifice, of which not a vestige now remains, was situated near Ewel in\r\nSurry, and commanded from its lofty turrets extensive views of the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\nIt was built round two courts, an outer and an inner one, both very\r\nspacious; and the entrance to each was by a square gatehouse highly\r\nornamented, embattled, and having turrets at the four corners. These\r\ngatehouses were of stone, as was the lower story of the palace itself;\r\nbut the upper one was of wood, \"richly adorned and set forth and\r\ngarnished with variety of statues, pictures, and other antic forms of\r\nexcellent art and workmanship, and of no small cost:\" all which\r\nornaments, it seems, were made of _rye dough_. In modern language the\r\n\"pictures\" would probably be called basso-relievos. From the eastern and\r\nwestern angles of the inner court rose two slender turrets five stories\r\nhigh, with lanthorns on the top, which were leaded and surrounded with\r\nwooden balustrades. These towers of observation, from which the two\r\nparks attached to the palace and a wide expanse of champaign country\r\nbeyond might be surveyed as in a map, were celebrated as the peculiar\r\nboast of Nonsuch.\r\n\r\nHenry was prevented by death from beholding the completion of this gaudy\r\nstructure, and queen Mary had it in contemplation to pull it down to\r\nsave further charges; but the earl of Arundel, \"for the love and honor\r\nhe bare to his old master,\" purchased the place, and finished it\r\naccording to the original design. It was to this splendid nobleman that\r\nthe visit of the queen was paid. He received her with the utmost\r\nmagnificence. On Sunday night a banquet, a mask, and a concert were the\r\nentertainments: the next day she witnessed a course from a standing made\r\nfor her in the park, and \"the children of Paul's\" performed a play;\r\nafter which a costly banquet was served up in gilt dishes. On her\r\nmajesty's departure her noble host further presented her with a cupboard\r\nof plate. The earl of Arundel was wealthy, munificent, and one of the\r\nfinest courtiers of his day: but it must not be imagined that even by\r\nhim such extraordinary cost and pains would have been lavished upon his\r\nillustrious guest as a pure and simple homage of that sentimental\r\nloyalty which feels its utmost efforts overpaid by their acceptance. He\r\nlooked in fact to a high and splendid recompense,--one which as yet\r\nperhaps he dared not name, but which the sagacity of his royal mistress\r\nwould, as he flattered himself, be neither tardy nor reluctant to\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry II. of France, which occurred during the summer of\r\nthis year, gave occasion to a splendid ceremony in St. Paul's cathedral,\r\nwhich was rendered remarkable by some circumstances connected with the\r\nlate change of religion. This was the performance of his obsequies, then\r\na customary tribute among the princes of Europe to the memory of each\r\nother; which Elizabeth therefore would by no means omit, though the\r\ncustom was so intimately connected with doctrines and practices\r\ncharacteristic of the Romish church, that it was difficult to divest it,\r\nin the judgement of a protestant people, of the character of a\r\nsuperstitious observance. A hearse magnificently adorned with the\r\nbanners and scutcheons of the deceased was placed in the church; a great\r\ntrain of lords and gentlemen attended as mourners; and all the\r\nceremonies of a real funeral were duly performed, not excepting the\r\noffering at the altar of money, originally designed, without doubt, for\r\nthe purchase of masses for the dead. The herald, however, was ordered to\r\nsubstitute other words in place of the ancient request to all present to\r\npray for the soul of the departed; and several reformations were made in\r\nthe service, and in the communion with which this stately piece of\r\npageantry concluded.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December was interred with much ceremony in Westminster\r\nAbbey Frances duchess-dowager of Suffolk, grandaughter to Henry VII.\r\nAfter the tragical catastrophe of her misguided husband and of lady Jane\r\nGrey her eldest daughter, the duchess was suffered to remain in\r\nunmolested privacy, and she had since rendered herself utterly\r\ninsignificant, not to say contemptible, by an obscure marriage with one\r\nStoke, a young man who was her master of the horse. There is a\r\ntradition, that on Elizabeth's exclaiming with surprise and indignation\r\nwhen the news of this connexion reached her ears, \"What, hath she\r\nmarried her horse keeper?\" Cecil replied, \"Yes, madam, and she says\r\nyour majesty would like to do so too;\" lord Robert Dudley then filling\r\nthe office of master of the horse to the queen.\r\n\r\nThe impolicy or inutility of sumptuary laws was not in this age\r\nacknowledged. A proclamation therefore was issued in October 1559 to\r\ncheck that prevalent excess in apparel which was felt as a serious evil\r\nat this period, when the manufactures of England were in so rude a state\r\nthat almost every article for the use of the higher classes was imported\r\nfrom Flanders, France, or Italy, in exchange for the raw commodities of\r\nthe country, or perhaps for money.\r\n\r\nThe invectives of divines, in various ages of the Christian church, have\r\nplaced upon lasting record some transient follies which would otherwise\r\nhave sunk into oblivion, and the sermons of bishop Pilkington, a warm\r\npolemic of this time, may be quoted as a kind of commentary on the\r\nproclamation. He reproves \"fine-fingered rufflers, with their sables\r\nabout their necks, corked slippers, trimmed buskins, and warm\r\nmittons.\"--\"These tender Parnels,\" he says, \"must have one gown for the\r\nday, another for the night; one long, another short; one for winter,\r\nanother for summer. One furred through, another but faced: one for the\r\nwork-day, another for the holiday. One of this color, another of that.\r\nOne of cloth, another of silk, or damask. Change of apparel; one afore\r\ndinner, another at after: one of Spanish fashion, another of Turkey. And\r\nto be brief, never content with enough, but always devising new fashions\r\nand strange. Yea a ruffian will have more in his ruff and his hose than\r\nhe should spend in a year. He which ought to go in a russet coat,\r\nspends as much on apparel for him and his wife, as his father would have\r\nkept a good house with.\"\r\n\r\nThe costly furs here mentioned had probably become fashionable since a\r\ndirect intercourse had been opened in the last reign with Russia, from\r\nwhich country ambassadors had arrived, whose barbaric splendor\r\nastonished the eyes of the good people of London. The affectation of\r\nwearing by turns the costume of all the nations of Europe, with which\r\nthe queen herself was not a little infected, may be traced partly to the\r\npractice of importing articles of dress from those nations, and that of\r\nemploying foreign tailors in preference to native ones, and partly to\r\nthe taste for travelling, which since the revival of letters had become\r\nlaudably prevalent among the young nobility and gentry of England. That\r\nmore in proportion was expended on the elegant luxuries of dress, and\r\nless on the coarser indulgences of the table, ought rather to have been\r\nconsidered as a desirable approach to refinement of manners than a\r\nlegitimate subject of censure.\r\n\r\nAn act of parliament was passed in this year subjecting the use of\r\nenchantment and witchcraft to the pains of felony. The malcontent\r\ncatholics, it seems, were accused of employing practices of this nature;\r\ntheir predictions of her majesty's death had given uneasiness to\r\ngovernment by encouraging plots against her government; and it was\r\nfeared, \"by many good and sober men,\" that these dealers in the black\r\nart might even bewitch the queen herself. That it was the learned bishop\r\nJewel who had led the way in inspiring these superstitious terrors, to\r\nwhich religious animosities lent additional violence, may fairly be\r\ninferred from the following passage of a discourse which was delivered\r\nby him in the queen's presence the year before.... \"Witches and\r\nsorcerers within these last few years are marvellously increased within\r\nyour grace's realm. These eyes have seen most evident and manifest marks\r\nof their wickedness. Your grace's subjects pine away even unto the\r\ndeath; their color fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is\r\nbenumbed, their senses are bereft. Wherefore your poor subjects' most\r\nhumble petition to your highness is, that the laws touching such\r\nmalefactors may be put in due execution. For the shoal of them is great,\r\ntheir doing horrible, their malice intolerable, the examples most\r\nmiserable. And I pray God they never practise further than upon the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1560.\r\n\r\nSuccessful campaign in Scotland.--Embassy of viscount Montacute to\r\nSpain--of sir T. Chaloner to the Emperor.--Account of Chaloner.--Letter\r\nof his respecting Dudley and the queen.--Dudley loses his\r\nwife.--Mysterious manner of her death.--Suspicion cast upon her\r\nhusband.--Dudley and several other courtiers aspire to the hand of their\r\nsovereign.--Tournaments in her honor.--Impresses.--Sir W.\r\nPickering.--Rivalry of Arundel and Dudley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accession of Francis II., husband to the queen of Scots, to the\r\nFrench throne had renewed the dangers of Elizabeth from the hostility of\r\nFrance and of Scotland; and in the politic resolution of removing from\r\nher own territory to that of her enemies the seat of a war which she saw\r\nto be inevitable, she levied a strong army and sent it under the command\r\nof the duke of Norfolk and lord Grey de Wilton to the frontiers of\r\nScotland. She also entered into a close connexion with the protestant\r\nparty in that country, who were already in arms against the queen-regent\r\nand her French auxiliaries. Success attended this well-planned\r\nexpedition, and at the end of a single campaign Elizabeth was able to\r\nterminate the war by the treaty of Edinburgh; a convention the terms of\r\nwhich were such as effectually to secure her from all fear of future\r\nmolestation in this quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of these hostilities, however, her situation was an\r\nanxious one. It was greatly to be feared that the emperor and the king\r\nof Spain, forgetting in their zeal for the catholic church the habitual\r\nenmity of the house of Austria against that of Bourbon, would make\r\ncommon cause with France against a sovereign who now stood forth the\r\navowed protectress of protestantism; and such a combination of the great\r\npowers of Europe, seconded by a large catholic party at home, England\r\nwas by no means in a condition to withstand. By skilful negotiation it\r\nseemed possible to avert these evils; and Elizabeth, by her selection of\r\ndiplomatic agents on this important occasion, gave striking evidence of\r\nher superior judgement.\r\n\r\nTo plead her cause with the king of Spain, she dispatched Anthony Browne\r\nviscount Montacute; a nobleman who, to the general recommendation of\r\nwisdom and experience in public affairs, added the peculiar one, for\r\nthis service, of a zealous attachment to the Romish faith, proved by his\r\ndetermined opposition in the house of lords to the bill of uniformity\r\nlately carried by a great majority. The explanations and arguments of\r\nthe viscount prevailed so far with Philip, that he ordered his\r\nambassador at Rome to oppose the endeavours of the French court to\r\nprevail on the pope to fulminate his ecclesiastical censures against\r\nElizabeth. It was found impracticable, however, to bring him to terms of\r\ncordial amity with a heretic sovereign whose principles he both detested\r\nand dreaded; and by returning, some time after, the decorations of the\r\norder of the garter, he distinctly intimated to the queen, that motives\r\nof policy alone restrained him from becoming her open enemy.\r\n\r\nFor ambassador to the emperor she made choice, at the recommendation\r\nprobably of Cecil, of his relation and beloved friend sir Thomas\r\nChaloner the elder, a statesman, a soldier, and a man of letters; and in\r\nthese three characters, so rarely united, one of the distinguished\r\nornaments of his age. He was born in 1515 of a good family in Wales,\r\nand, being early sent to Cambridge, became known as a very elegant Latin\r\npoet, and generally as a young man of the most promising talents. After\r\na short residence at court, his merit caused him to be selected to\r\nattend into Germany sir Henry Knevet the English ambassador, with a view\r\nto his qualifying himself for future diplomatic employment. At the court\r\nof Charles V. he was received with extraordinary favor; and after\r\nwaiting upon that monarch, in several of his journeys, he was at length\r\ninduced, by admiration of his character, to accompany him as a volunteer\r\nin his rash expedition against Algiers. He was shipwrecked in the storm\r\nwhich almost destroyed the fleet, and only escaped drowning by catching\r\nin his mouth, as he was struggling with the waves, a cable, by which he\r\nwas drawn up into a ship with the loss of several of his teeth.\r\n\r\nReturning home, he was made clerk of the council, which office he held\r\nduring the remainder of Henry's reign. Early in the next he was\r\ndistinguished by the protector, and, having signalized his valor in the\r\nbattle of Pinkey, was knighted by him on the field. The fall of his\r\npatron put a stop to his advancement; but he solaced himself under this\r\nreverse by the cultivation of literature, and of friendship with such\r\nmen as Cook, Smith, Cheke, and Cecil. The strictness of his protestant\r\nprinciples rendered his situation under the reign of Mary both\r\ndisagreeable and hazardous, and he generously added to its perils by his\r\nstrenuous exertions in behalf of the unfortunate Cheke; but the services\r\nwhich he had rendered in Edward's time to many of the oppressed\r\ncatholics now interested their gratitude in his protection, and were\r\nthus the means of preserving him unhurt for better times.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from his embassy to the emperor Ferdinand, we find\r\nhim engaged in a very perplexing and disagreeable mission to the\r\nunfriendly court of Philip II., where the mortifications which he\r\nencountered, joined to the insalubrity of the climate, so impaired his\r\nhealth that he found himself obliged to solicit his recall, which he did\r\nin an Ovidian elegy addressed to the queen. The petition of the poet was\r\ngranted, but too late; he sunk under a lingering malady in October 1565,\r\na few months after his return.\r\n\r\nThe poignant grief of Cecil for his loss found its best alleviation in\r\nthe exemplary performance of all the duties of surviving friendship. He\r\nofficiated as chief mourner at his funeral, and superintended with\r\nsolicitude truly paternal the education of his son, Thomas Chaloner the\r\nyounger, afterwards a distinguished character. By his encouragement, the\r\nLatin poems of his friend, chiefly consisting of epitaphs and panegyrics\r\non his most celebrated contemporaries, were collected and published;\r\nand it was under his patronage, and prefaced by a Latin poem from his\r\npen in praise of the author, that a new and complete edition appeared of\r\nthe principal work of this accomplished person;--a tractate \"on the\r\nright ordering of the English republic,\" also in Latin.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Chaloner was the first ambassador named by Elizabeth; a\r\ndistinction of which he proved himself highly deserving. Wisdom and\r\nintegrity he was already known to possess; and in his negotiations with\r\nthe imperial court, where it was his business to draw the bonds of amity\r\nas close as should be found practicable without pledging his mistress to\r\nthe acceptance of the hand of the archduke Charles, he also manifested a\r\ndegree of skill and dexterity which drew forth the warmest commendations\r\nfrom Elizabeth herself. His conduct, she said, had far exceeded all her\r\nexpectations of his prudence and abilities.\r\n\r\nThis testimony may be allowed to give additional weight to his opinion\r\non a point of great delicacy in the personal conduct of her majesty, as\r\nwell as on some more general questions of policy, expressed in a\r\npostscript to one of his official letters to secretary Cecil. The\r\nletter, it should be observed, was written near the close of the year\r\n1559, when the favor of the queen to Dudley had first become a subject\r\nof general remark, and before all hopes were lost of her finally closing\r\nwith the proposals of the archduke.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, sir, these folks are broad-mouthed where I spake of one\r\ntoo much in favor, as they esteem. I think ye guess whom they named; if\r\nye do not, I will upon my next letters write further. To tell you what\r\nI conceive; as I count the slander most false, so a young princess\r\ncannot be too wary what countenance or familiar demonstration she\r\nmaketh, more to one than another. I judge no man's service in the realm\r\nworth the entertainment with such a tale of obloquy, or occasion of\r\nspeech to such men as of evil will are ready to find faults. This delay\r\nof ripe time for marriage, besides the loss of the realm (for without\r\nposterity of her highness what hope is left unto us?) ministereth matter\r\nto these leud tongues to descant upon, and breedeth contempt. I would I\r\nhad but one hour's talk with you. Think if I trusted not your good\r\nnature, I would not write thus much; which nevertheless I humbly pray\r\nyou to reserve as written to yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Consider how ye deal now in the emperor's matter: much dependeth on it.\r\nHere they hang in expectation as men desirous it should go forward, but\r\nyet they have small hope: In mine opinion (be it said to you only) the\r\naffinity is great and honorable: The amity necessary to stop and cool\r\nmany enterprises. Ye need not fear his greatness should overrule you; he\r\nis not a Philip, but better for us than a Philip. Let the time work for\r\nScotland as God will, for sure the French, I believe, shall never long\r\nenjoy them: and when we be stronger and more ready, we may proceed with\r\nthat, that is yet unripe. The time itself will work, when our great\r\nneighbours fall out next. In the mean time settle we things begun; and\r\nlet us arm and fortify our frontiers.\" &c.[46]\r\n\r\n[Note 46: \"Burleigh Papers,\" by Haynes, p. 212.]\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence remains that the sentiments of Cecil respecting the\r\nqueen's behaviour to Dudley coincided with those of his friend, and that\r\nfears for her reputation gave additional urgency about this period to\r\nthose pleadings in favor of matrimony which her council were doomed to\r\npress upon her attention so often and so much in vain. But a\r\ncircumstance occurred soon after which totally changed the nature of\r\ntheir apprehensions respecting her future conduct, and rendered her\r\nanticipated choice of a husband no longer an object of hope and joy, but\r\nof general dissatisfaction and alarm.\r\n\r\nJust when the whispered scandal of the court had apprized him how\r\nobvious to all beholders the partiality of his sovereign had\r\nbecome,--just when her rejection of the proposals of so many foreign\r\nprinces had confirmed the suspicion that her heart had given itself at\r\nhome,--just, in short, when every thing conspired to sanction hopes\r\nwhich under any other circumstances would have appeared no less\r\nvisionary than presumptuous,--at the very juncture most favorable to his\r\nambition, but most perilous to his reputation, lord Robert Dudley lost\r\nhis wife, and by a fate equally sudden and mysterious.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate lady had been sent by her husband, under the conduct of\r\nsir Richard Verney, one of his retainers,--but for what reason or under\r\nwhat pretext does not appear,--to Cumnor House in Berkshire, a solitary\r\nmansion inhabited by Anthony Foster, also a dependent of Dudley's and\r\nbound to him by particular obligations. Here she soon after met with her\r\ndeath; and Verney and Foster, who appear to have been alone in the\r\nhouse with her, gave out that it happened by an accidental fall down\r\nstairs. But this account, from various causes, gained so little credit\r\nin the neighbourhood, that reports of the most sinister import were\r\nquickly propagated. These discourses soon reached the ears of Thomas\r\nLever, a prebendary of Coventry and a very conscientious person, who\r\nimmediately addressed to the secretaries of state an earnest letter,\r\nstill extant, beseeching them to cause strict inquiry to be made into\r\nthe case, as it was commonly believed that the lady had been murdered:\r\nbut he mentioned no particular grounds of this belief, and it cannot now\r\nbe ascertained whether any steps were taken in consequence of his\r\napplication. If there were, they certainly produced no satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the circumstance; for not only the popular voice, which\r\nwas ever hostile to Dudley, continued to accuse him as the contriver of\r\nher fate, but Cecil himself, in a memorandum drawn up some years after\r\nof reasons against the queen's making him her husband, mentions among\r\nother objections, \"that he is infamed by the death of his wife.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the thorough investigation of this matter was evaded by the\r\nartifices of Dudley, or whether his enemies, finding it impracticable to\r\nbring the crime home to him, found it more advisable voluntarily to drop\r\nthe inquiry, certain it is, that the queen was never brought in any\r\nmanner to take cognisance of the affair, and that the credit of Dudley\r\ncontinued as high with her as ever. But in the opinion of the country\r\nthe favorite passed ever after for a dark designer, capable of\r\nperpetrating any secret villainy in furtherance of his designs, and\r\nskilful enough to conceal his atrocity under a cloak of artifice and\r\nhypocrisy impervious to the partial eyes of his royal mistress, though\r\npenetrated by all the world besides. This idea of his character caused\r\nhim afterwards to be accused of practising against the lives of several\r\nother persons who were observed to perish opportunely for his purposes.\r\nEach of these charges will be particularly examined in its proper place;\r\nbut it ought here to be observed, that not one of them appears to be\r\nsupported by so many circumstances of probability as the first; and even\r\nin support of this, no direct evidence has ever been adduced.\r\n\r\nUnder all the circumstances of his situation, Dudley could not venture\r\nas yet openly to declare himself the suitor of his sovereign; but she\r\ndoubtless knew how to interpret both the vehemence of his opposition to\r\nthe pretensions of the archduke, and the equal vehemence with which\r\nthose pretensions were supported by an opposite party in her council, of\r\nwhich the earl of Sussex was the head.\r\n\r\nFew could yet be persuaded that the avowed determination of the queen in\r\nfavor of the single state would prove unalterable: most therefore who\r\nobserved her averseness to a foreign connexion believed that she was\r\nsecretly meditating to honor with her hand some subject of her own, who\r\ncould never have a separate interest from that of his country, and whose\r\ngratitude for the splendid distinction would secure to her the\r\npossession of his lasting attachment.\r\n\r\nThis idea long served to animate the assiduities of her nobles and\r\ncourtiers, and two or three besides Dudley were bold enough to publish\r\ntheir pretensions. Secret hopes or wishes were cherished in the bosoms\r\nof others; and it thus became a fashion to accost her in language where\r\nthe passionate homage of the lover mingled with the base adulation of\r\nthe menial. Her personal vanity, triumphant over her good sense and her\r\nperceptions of regal dignity, forbade her to discourage a style of\r\naddress equally disgraceful to those who employed and to her who\r\npermitted it; and it was this unfortunate habit of receiving, and at\r\nlength requiring, a species of flattery which became every year more\r\ngrossly preposterous, which depraved by degrees her taste, infected her\r\nwhole disposition, and frequently lent to the wisest sovereign of Europe\r\nthe disgusting affectation of a heroine of French romance.\r\n\r\nTilts and tournaments were still the favorite amusements of all the\r\ncourts of Europe; and it was in these splendid exhibitions that the\r\nrival courtiers of Elizabeth found the happiest occasions of displaying\r\ntheir magnificence, giving proof of their courage and agility, and at\r\nthe same time insinuating, by a variety of ingenious devices, their\r\nhopes and fears, their amorous pains, and their profound devotedness to\r\nher service.\r\n\r\nIn the purer ages of chivalry, no other cognisances on shields were\r\nadopted, either in war or in these games which were its image, than the\r\narmorial bearings which each warrior had derived from his ancestors, or\r\nsolemnly received at the hands of the heralds before he entered on his\r\nfirst campaign. But as the spirit of the original institution declined,\r\nand the French fashion of gallantry began to be engrafted upon it, an\r\ninnovation had taken place in this matter, which is thus commemorated\r\nand deplored by the worthy Camden, Clarencieux king-at-arms, who treats\r\nthe subject with a minuteness and solemnity truly professional.\r\n\"Whoever,\" says he, \"would note the manners of our progenitors,--in\r\nwearing their coat-armour over their harness, and bearing their arms in\r\ntheir shields, their banners and pennons, and in what formal manner they\r\nwere made bannerets, and had license to rear their banner of arms, which\r\nthey presented rolled up, unto the prince, who unfolded and re-delivered\r\nit with happy wishes; I doubt not but he will judge that our ancestors\r\nwere as valiant and gallant as they have been since they left off their\r\narms and used the colors and curtains of their mistress' bed instead of\r\nthem.\" The same author afterwards observes, that these fopperies, as\r\nwell as the adoption of _impresses_, first prevailed in the expedition\r\nof Charles VIII. against Naples in 1494, and that it was about the\r\nbeginning of the reign of Henry VIII. that the English wits first\r\nthought of imitating the French and Italians in the invention of these\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nAn _impress_, it seems, was an emblematical device assumed at the will\r\nof the bearer, and illustrated by a suitable motto; whereas the coat of\r\narms had either no motto, or none appropriate. Of this nature therefore\r\nwas the representation of an English archer, with the words \"Cui adhaereo\r\npraeest\" (He prevails to whom I adhere), used by Henry VIII. at his\r\nmeeting with Charles and Francis.\r\n\r\nElizabeth delighted in these whimsical inventions. Camden says that she\r\n\"used upon different occasions so many heroical devices as would require\r\na volume,\" but most commonly a sieve without a word. Her favorite mottos\r\nwere \"Video taceo\" (I see and am silent), and \"Semper eadem\" (Always the\r\nsame). Thus patronized, the use of impresses became general. Scarcely a\r\npublic character of that age, whether statesman, courtier, scholar, or\r\nsoldier, was unprovided with some distinction of this nature; and at\r\ntournaments in particular, the combatants all vied with each other in\r\nthe invention of occasional devices, sometimes quaintly, sometimes\r\nelegantly, expressive of their situation or sentiments, and for the most\r\npart conveying some allusion at once gallant and loyal.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to cite a few of the most remarkable of these out\r\nof a considerable number preserved by Camden. The prevalence amongst\r\nthem of astronomical emblems is worthy of observation, as indicative of\r\nthat general belief of the age in the delusions of judicial astrology,\r\nwhich rendered its terms familiar alike to the learned, the great, and\r\nthe fair.\r\n\r\nA dial with the sun setting, \"Occasu desines esse\" (Thy being ceases\r\nwith its setting). The sun shining on a bush, \"Si deseris pereo\"\r\n(Forsake me, and I perish). The sun reflecting his rays from the bearer,\r\n\"Quousque avertes\" (How long wilt thou avert thy face)? Venus in a\r\ncloud, \"Salva me, Domina\" (Mistress, save me). The letter I, \"Omnia ex\r\nuno\" (All things from one). A fallow field, \"At quando messis\" (When\r\nwill be the harvest)? The full moon in heaven, \"Quid sine te coelum\"\r\n(What is heaven without thee)? Cynthia, it should be observed, was a\r\nfavorite fancy-name of the queen's; she was also designated occasionally\r\nby that of Astraea, whence the following devices. A man hovering in the\r\nair, \"Feror ad Astraeam\" (I am borne to Astraea). The zodiac with Virgo\r\nrising, \"Jam redit et Virgo\" (The Maid returns); and a zodiac with no\r\ncharacters but those of Leo and Virgo, \"His ego praesidiis\" (With these\r\nto friend). A star, \"Mihi vita Spica Virginis\" (My life is in Spica\r\nVirginis)--a star in the left hand of Virgo so called: here the allusion\r\nwas probably double; to the queen, and to the horoscope of the bearer.\r\nThe twelve houses of heaven with neither sign nor planet therein,\r\n\"Dispone\" (Dispose). A white shield, \"Fatum inscribat Eliza\" (Eliza\r\nwrites my fate). An eye in a heart, \"Vulnus alo\" (I feed the wound). A\r\nship sinking and the rainbow appearing, \"Quid tu si pereo\" (To what\r\navail if I perish)? As the rainbow is an emblem seen in several\r\nportraits of the queen, this device probably reproaches some tardy and\r\nineffectual token of her favor. The sun shining on a withered tree which\r\nblooms again, \"His radiis rediviva viresco\" (These rays revive me). A\r\npair of scales, fire in one, smoke in the other, \"Ponderare errare\" (To\r\nweigh is to err).\r\n\r\nAt one tilt were borne all the following devices, which Camden\r\nparticularly recommends to the notice and interpretation of the reader.\r\nMany flies about a candle, \"Sic splendidiora petuntur\" (\"Thus brighter\r\nthings are sought). Drops falling into a fire, \"Tamen non extinguenda\"\r\n(Yet not to be extinguished). The sun, partly clouded over, casting its\r\nrays upon a star, \"Tantum quantum\" (As much as is vouchsafed). A folded\r\nletter, \"Lege et relege\"[47] (Read and reread).\r\n\r\n[Note 47: See Camden's \"Remains.\"]\r\n\r\nIt would have increased our interest in these very significant\r\nimpresses, if our author could have informed us who were the respective\r\nbearers. Perhaps conjecture would not err in ascribing one of the most\r\nexpressive to sir William Pickering, a gentleman whose name has been\r\nhanded down to posterity as an avowed pretender to the royal marriage.\r\nThat a person illustrious neither by rank nor ancestry, and so little\r\nknown to fame that no other mention of him occurs in the history of the\r\nage, should ever have been named amongst the suitors of his sovereign,\r\nis a circumstance which must excite more curiosity than the scanty\r\nbiographical records of the time will be found capable of satisfying. A\r\nsingle paragraph of Camden's Annals seems to contain nearly all that can\r\nnow be learned of a man once so remarkable.\r\n\r\n\"Nor were lovers wanting at home, who deluded themselves with vain hopes\r\nof obtaining her in marriage. Namely sir William Pickering, a man of\r\ngood family though little wealth, and who had obtained reputation by the\r\ncultivation of letters, by the elegance of his manners, and by his\r\nembassies to France and Germany.\" &c.\r\n\r\nRapin speaks of him as one who was encouraged to hope by some\r\ndistinguished mark of the queen's favor, which he does not however\r\nparticularize. Lloyd in his \"Worthies\" adds nothing to Camden's\r\ninformation but the epithet \"comely\" applied to his person, the vague\r\nstatement that \"his embassies in France and Germany were so well\r\nmanaged, that in king Edward's days he was by the council pitched upon\r\nas the oracle whereby our agents were to be guided abroad,\" and a hint\r\nthat he soon retired from the court of Elizabeth to devote himself to\r\nhis studies.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Arundel might be the bearer of another of these devices. We\r\nhave already seen with what magnificence of homage this nobleman had\r\nendeavoured to bespeak the favorable sentiments of his youthful\r\nsovereign; and if illustrious ancestry, vast possessions, established\r\nconsequence in the state, and long experience in public affairs, might\r\nhave sufficed to recommend a subject to her choice, none could have\r\nadvanced fairer pretensions than the representative of the ancient house\r\nof Fitzalan. The advanced age of the earl was indeed an objection of\r\nconsiderable and daily increasing weight; he persevered however in his\r\nsuit, notwithstanding the queen's visible preference of Dudley and every\r\nother circumstance of discouragement, till the year 1566. Losing then\r\nall hopes of success, and becoming sensible at length of pecuniary\r\ndifficulties from the vast expense which he had lavished on this\r\nsplendid courtship, he solicited the permission of his royal mistress to\r\nretire for a time into Italy.\r\n\r\nWhile it lasted, however, the rivalry of Arundel and Dudley, or rather,\r\nin the heraldic phraseology of the day, that of the White Horse and the\r\nBear, divided the court, inflamed the passions of the numerous retainers\r\nof the respective candidates, and but for the impartial vigilance of\r\nCecil might have ended in deeds of blood.\r\n\r\nIn the Burleigh Papers is a confession of one Guntor, a servant or\r\nretainer of the earl of Arundel, who was punished for certain rash\r\nspeeches relative to this competition, from which we learn some curious\r\nparticulars. He says, that he once fell in talk with a gentleman named\r\nCotton, who told him, that the queen, having supped one evening at lord\r\nRobert Dudley's, it was dark before she could get away; and some\r\nservants of the house were sent with torches to light her home. That by\r\nthe way her highness was pleased to enter into conversation with the\r\ntorch-bearers, and was reported to have said, that she would make their\r\nlord the best that ever was of his name. As the father of lord Robert\r\nwas a duke, this promise was understood to imply nothing less than her\r\ndesign of marrying him. On this Guntor answered, that he prayed all men\r\nmight take it well, and that no trouble might arise thereof; afterwards\r\nhe said, that he thought if a parliament were held, some men would\r\nrecommend lord Robert, and some his own master to the queen for a\r\nhusband; and so it might fortune there would rise trouble among the\r\nnoblemen, adding, \"I trust the White Horse will be in quiet, and so\r\nshall we be out of trouble; it is well known _his_ blood as yet was\r\nnever attaint, nor was he ever man of war, wherefore it is likely that\r\nwe shall sit still; but if he should stomach it, he were able to make a\r\ngreat power.\" In his zeal for the cause of his lord, he also wished that\r\nhis rival had been put to death with his father, \"or that some ruffian\r\nwould have dispatched him by the way as he hath gone, with some dag\r\n(pistol) or gun.\"\r\n\r\nSo high did words run on occasion of this great contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1560.\r\n\r\nOn the conduct of Elizabeth as head of the church.--Sketch of the\r\nhistory of the reformation in England.--Notices of Parker, Grindal, and\r\nJewel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no part of the regal office the exercise of which appeared so\r\nlikely to expose Elizabeth to invidious reflections, as that which\r\ncomprehended the management of ecclesiastical affairs. Few divines,\r\nthough protestant, could behold without a certain feeling of mingled\r\njealousy and disdain, a female placed at the head of the religion of the\r\ncountry, and by the whole papal party such a supremacy was regarded\r\nperhaps as the most horrible, certainly as the most preposterous, of all\r\nthe prodigies which heresy had yet brought forth. \"I have seen the head\r\nof the English church dancing!\" exclaimed, it is said, with a sarcastic\r\nair, an ambassador from one of the catholic courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nA more striking incongruity indeed could scarcely be imagined, than\r\nbetween the winning manners and sprightly disposition of this youthful\r\nprincess, as they displayed themselves amid the festivities of her court\r\nand the homage of her suitors, and the grave and awful character of\r\nGoverness of the church, with which she had been solemnly invested.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of this office, it was the right and duty of the queen to\r\nchoose a religion for the country; to ordain its rites and ceremonies,\r\ndiscipline, and form of church government; and to fix the rank, offices\r\nand emoluments of its ministers. She was also to exercise this power\r\nentirely at her own discretion, free from the control of parliament or\r\nthe interference of the clerical body, and assisted only by such\r\ncommissioners, lay or ecclesiastical, as it should please herself to\r\nappoint.\r\n\r\nThis exorbitant authority was first assumed by her arbitrary father when\r\nit became his will that his people should acknowledge no other pope than\r\nhimself; and the servile spirit of the age, joined to the ignorance and\r\nindifference on religious subjects then general, had caused it to be\r\nsubmitted to without difficulty. In consequence, the title of Head of\r\nthe Church had quietly devolved upon Edward VI. as part of his regal\r\nstyle; and while the duties of the office were exercised by Cranmer and\r\nthe Protector, the nation, now generally favorable to the cause of\r\nreform, was more inclined to rejoice in its existence than to dispute\r\nthe authority by which it had been instituted. Mary abhorred the title,\r\nas a badge of heresy and a guilty usurpation on the rights of the\r\nsovereign pontiff, and in the beginning of her reign she laid it aside,\r\nbut was afterwards prevailed upon to resume it, because there was a\r\nconvenience in the legal sanction which it afforded to her acts of\r\ntyranny over the consciences of men.\r\n\r\nThe first parliament of Elizabeth, in the fervor of its loyalty, decreed\r\nto her, as if by acclamation, all the honors or prerogatives ever\r\nenjoyed by her predecessors, and it was solely at her own request that\r\nthe appellation of Head, was now exchanged for the less assuming one of\r\nGoverness, of the English church. The power remained the same; it was,\r\nas we have seen, of the most absolute nature possible; since, unlimited\r\nby law, it was also, owing to its recent establishment, equally\r\nuncontrolled by custom. It remains to the delineator of the character of\r\nElizabeth to inquire in what manner she acquitted herself, to her\r\ncountry and to posterity, of the awful responsibility imposed upon her\r\nby its possession.\r\n\r\nA slight sketch of the circumstances attending the introduction of the\r\nreformation into England, will serve to illustrate this important branch\r\nof her policy.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the march of this mighty revolution in our own country with\r\nits mode of progress amongst the other nations of Europe, one of the\r\nfirst remarks which suggests itself is, that in no other country was its\r\ncourse so immediately or effectually subjected to the guidance and\r\ncontrol of the civil power.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, the system of Zwingle, the earliest of the reformers,\r\nhad fully established itself in the hearts of his fellow-citizens before\r\nthe magistracies of Zurich and its neighbouring republics thought proper\r\nto interfere. They then gave the sanction of law to the religion which\r\nhad become that of the majority, but abstained from all dictation on\r\npoints of which they felt themselves incompetent judges.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the impulse originating in the daring mind of Luther, was\r\nfirst communicated to the universities, to the lower orders of the\r\nclergy, and through them to the people. The princes of the empire\r\nafterwards took their part as patrons or persecutors of the new\r\nopinions; but in either case they acted under the influence of\r\necclesiastics, and no where arrogated to themselves the character of\r\nlawgivers in matters of faith.\r\n\r\nAt Geneva, the vigor and dexterity of Calvin's measures brought the\r\nmagistracy under a complete subjection to the church, of which he had\r\nmade himself the head, and restricted its agency in religious concerns\r\nto the execution of such decrees as the spiritual ruler saw good to\r\npromulgate.\r\n\r\nThe system of the same reformer had recently been introduced into\r\nScotland by the exertions of John Knox, a disciple who equalled his\r\nmaster in the fierceness of his bigotry, in self-opinion, and in the\r\nlove of power, whilst he exceeded him in turbulence of temper and\r\nferocity of manners: and here the independence of the church on the\r\nstate, or rather its paramount legislative authority in all matters of\r\nfaith, discipline and worship, was held in the loftiest terms. The\r\nopposition which this doctrine, so formed for popularity, experienced\r\nfrom the government in the outset, was overborne or disregarded, and it\r\nwas in despite of the utmost efforts of regal authority that the new\r\nreligion was established by an act of the Scottish parliament.\r\n\r\nIn England, on the contrary, the passions of Henry VIII. had prompted\r\nhim to disclaim submission to the papal decrees before the spirit of the\r\npeople demanded such a step,--before any apostle of reformation had\r\narisen in the land capable of inspiring the multitude with that zeal\r\nwhich makes its will omnipotent, and leaves to rulers no other\r\nalternative than to comply or fall,--yet not before the attachment of\r\nmen to the ancient religion was so far weakened, that the majority could\r\nwitness its overthrow with patience if not with complacency.\r\n\r\nTo have timed this momentous step so fortunately for the cause of\r\nprerogative might in some princes have been esteemed the result of\r\nprofound combinations,--the triumph of political sagacity; in Henry it\r\nwas the pure effect of accident: but the advantages which he derived\r\nfrom the quiescent state of the public mind were not on this account the\r\nless real or the less important, nor did he suffer them to go\r\nunimproved. On one hand, no considerable opposition was made to his\r\nassumption of the supremacy; on the other, the spoil of the monasteries\r\nwas not intercepted in its passage to the royal coffers by the more\r\nrapid movements of a populace intoxicated with fanatical rage or fired\r\nwith hopes of plunder. What appeared still more extraordinary, he found\r\nit practicable, to the end of his reign, to keep the nation suspended,\r\nas to doctrine and the forms of worship, in that nice equilibrium\r\nbetween protestant and papist which happened best to accord with his\r\nindividual views or prejudices.\r\n\r\nCranmer, who has a better title than any other to be revered as the\r\nfather of the Anglican church, showed himself during the life of Henry\r\nthe most cautious and complaisant of reformers. Aware that any rashness\r\nor precipitation on the part of the favorers of new opinions might\r\nexpose them to all the fury of persecution from a prince so dogmatical\r\nand violent, he constantly refrained from every alarming appeal to the\r\nsense of the people on theological questions, and was content to proceed\r\nin his great work step by step, with a slow, uncertain, and interrupted\r\nprogress, at the will of that capricious master whose vacillations of\r\nhumor or opinion he watched with the patience, and improved with the\r\nskill, of a finished courtier.\r\n\r\nAdministered in so qualified and mitigated a form, the spirit of\r\nreformation exhibited in this country little of its stronger and more\r\nturbulent workings. No sect at that time arose purely and peculiarly\r\nEnglish: our native divines did not embrace exclusively, or with\r\nvehemence, the tenets of any one of the great leaders of reform on the\r\ncontinent, and a kind of eclectic system became that of the Anglican\r\nchurch from its earliest institution.\r\n\r\nThe respective contributions to this system of the most celebrated\r\ntheologians of the age may be thus stated. It was chiefly from\r\nZwingle,--the first, in point of time, of all the reformers of the\r\nsixteenth century, and the one whose doctrine on the eucharist and on\r\nseveral other points diverged most widely from the tenets of the church\r\nof Rome,--that our principal opponents of popery in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII. derived their notions. Latimer, Ridley, Cranmer himself, were\r\nessentially his disciples.\r\n\r\nBy others, the system of Luther was in the whole or in part adopted.\r\nBut this reformer was personally so obnoxious to Henry, on account of\r\nthe disrespectful and acrimonious style of his answer to the book in\r\nwhich that royal polemic had formerly attacked his doctrine, that no\r\nEnglish subject thought proper openly to profess himself his follower,\r\nor to open any direct communication with him. Thus the Confession of\r\nAugsburg, though more consonant to the notions of the English monarch\r\nthan any other scheme of protestant doctrine, failed to obtain the\r\nsanction of that authority which might have rendered it predominant in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nA long and vehement controversy on the subject of the eucharist had been\r\nmaintained between the German and Swiss divines during the later years\r\nof Henry; but at the period of Edward's accession, when Cranmer first\r\nundertook the formation of a national church according to his own ideas\r\nof gospel truth and political expediency, this dispute was in great\r\nmeasure appeased, and sanguine hopes were entertained that a\r\ndisagreement regarded as dangerous in a high degree to the common cause\r\nof religious reform might soon be entirely reconciled.\r\n\r\nLuther, the last survivor of the original disputants, was lately dead;\r\nand to the post which he had held in the university of Wittemberg, as\r\nwell as to the station of head of the protestant church, Melancthon had\r\nsucceeded. This truly excellent person, who carried into all theological\r\ndebates a spirit of conciliation equally rare and admirable, was\r\nearnestly laboring at a scheme of comprehension. His laudable\r\nendeavours were met by the zealous co-operation of Calvin, who had by\r\nthis time extended his influence from Geneva over most of the Helvetic\r\ncongregations, and was diligent in persuading them to recede from the\r\nunambiguous plainness of Zwingle's doctrine,--which reduced the Lord's\r\nsupper to a simple commemoration,--and to admit so much of a mystical\r\nthough spiritual presence of Christ in that rite, as might bring them to\r\nsome seeming agreement with the less rigid of the followers of the\r\nLutheran opinion. At the same time Bucer, who presided over the\r\nflourishing church of Strasburg, was engaged in framing yet another\r\nexplication of this important rite, by which he vainly hoped to\r\naccommodate the consciences of all these zealous and acute polemics.\r\n\r\nBucer was remarkable among the theologians of his time by a subtility in\r\ndistinction resembling that of the schoolmen, and by a peculiar art of\r\nexpressing himself on doctrinal points in terms so nicely balanced, and\r\nin a style of such labored intricacy, that it was scarcely possible to\r\ndiscover his true meaning, or pronounce to which extreme of opinion he\r\nmost inclined. These dubious qualifications, by which he disgusted\r\nalternately both Calvin and the more zealous Lutherans, were however\r\naccompanied and redeemed by great learning and diligence; by a\r\nremarkable talent for public business, which rendered him eminently\r\nuseful in all the various negotiations with temporal authorities, or\r\nwith each other, in which the leaders of the reformation found it\r\nnecessary to engage; by a mild and candid spirit, and by as much of\r\nsincerity and probity as could co-exist with the open defence of pious\r\nfrauds.\r\n\r\nThe whole character of the man appeared to Cranmer admirably fitted for\r\nco-operation in the work which he had in hand. On the difficult question\r\nof the eucharist Bucer would preserve the wariness and moderation which\r\nappeared essential in the divided state of protestant opinion: on\r\njustification and good works he held a middle doctrine, which might\r\nconciliate the catholics, and was capable of being so interpreted as not\r\ngreatly to offend the moderate Lutherans: on the subject of church\r\ngovernment he had not yet committed himself, and there was little doubt\r\nthat he would cheerfully submit to the natural predilection of the\r\narchbishop for prelacy. His erudition and his morals could not fail to\r\nprove serviceable and creditable to the great cause of national\r\ninstruction and reformed religion. Accordingly an invitation was sent to\r\nhim, in the name of the young king, to come and occupy the theological\r\nchair in the university of Cambridge; and in the year 1549 he reached\r\nEngland, and began to discharge with much assiduity the duties of his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe name and influence of Bucer became very considerable in this\r\ncountry, though his career was terminated by death within two years\r\nafter his arrival. A public funeral, attended by all the members of the\r\nuniversity and many other persons of eminence, attested the\r\nconsideration in which he was held by Edward's ministers; the subsequent\r\ndisinterment of his remains by order of cardinal Pole, for the purpose\r\nof committing his bones to the flames, gave further evidence of his\r\nmerits in the protestant cause; and in the composition of our national\r\nArticles, it has been said that no hand has left more distinguishable\r\ntraces of itself than that of Bucer.\r\n\r\nFrom Strasburg also the university of Oxford was destined to receive a\r\nprofessor of divinity in the person of the celebrated Peter Martyr. This\r\ngood and learned man, a Florentine by birth and during some years\r\nprincipal of a college of Augustines at Naples, having gradually become\r\na convert to the doctrines of the reformers, and afterwards proceeding\r\nopenly to preach them, was compelled to quit his country in order to\r\navoid persecution. Passing into Switzerland, he was received with\r\naffectionate hospitality by the disciples of Zwingle at Zurich; and\r\nafter making some abode there he repaired to Basil, whence Bucer caused\r\nhim to be invited to fill the station of theological professor at\r\nStrasburg. He was also appointed the colleague of this divine in the\r\nministry, and their connexion had subsisted about five years in perfect\r\nharmony when the offers of Cranmer induced the two friends to remove\r\ninto England.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that no considerable differences of opinion on\r\npoints deemed by themselves essential could exist between associates so\r\nunited; but a greater simplicity of character and of views, and superior\r\nboldness in the enunciation of new doctrines, strikingly distinguished\r\nthe proceedings of Peter Martyr from those of his friend. With respect\r\nto church government, he, like Bucer, was willing to conform to the\r\nregulations of Cranmer and the English council; but he preached at\r\nOxford on the eucharist with so Zwinglian a cast of sentiment, that the\r\npopish party raised a popular commotion against him, by which his life\r\nwas endangered, and he was compelled for a time to withdraw from the\r\ncity. Tranquillity was soon however restored by the interference of the\r\npublic authority, and the council proceeded vigorously in obliterating\r\nthe last vestiges of Romish superstition. Ridley throughout his own\r\ndiocese now caused the altars to be removed from the churches, and\r\ncommunion-tables to be placed in their room; and, as if by way of\r\ncomment on this alteration, Martyr and others procured a public\r\nrecognition of the Genevan as a sister church, and the admission into\r\nthe English service-book of the articles of faith drawn up by Calvin.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of Edward's reign the tide of public opinion\r\ncontinued running with still augmenting velocity towards Geneva. Calvin\r\ntook upon him openly to expostulate with Bucer on the preference of\r\nstate expediency to Scripture truth, betrayed, as he asserted, by the\r\nobstinate adherence of this divine to certain doctrines and observances\r\nwhich savoured too much of popery; and it is probable that a still\r\nnearer approach might have been made to his simpler ritual, but for the\r\nuntimely death of the zealous young king, and the total ruin of the new\r\nestablishment which ensued.\r\n\r\nJust before the persecutions of Mary drove into exile so many of the\r\nmost zealous and conscientious of her protestant subjects, the discord\r\nbetween the Lutherans and those whom they styled Sacramentarians had\r\nburst out afresh in Germany with more fury than ever. The incendiary on\r\nthis occasion was Westphal, superintendant of the Lutheran church of\r\nHamburgh, who published a violent book on the subject of the eucharist;\r\nand through the influence of this man, and of the outrageous spirit of\r\nintolerance which his work had raised, Latimer and Ridley were\r\nstigmatized by fellow protestants as \"the devil's martyrs,\" and the\r\nLutheran cities drove from their gates as dangerous and detestable\r\nheretics the English refugees who fled to them for shelter. By those\r\ncities or congregations, on the contrary,--whether in Germany, France,\r\nor Switzerland,--in which the tenets either of Zwingle or Calvin were\r\nprofessed, these pious exiles were received with open arms, venerated as\r\nconfessors, cherished as brethren in distress, and admitted with perfect\r\nconfidence into the communion of the respective churches.\r\n\r\nTreatment so opposite from the two contending parties, between which\r\nthey had supposed themselves to occupy neutral ground, failed not to\r\nproduce corresponding effects on the minds of the exiles. At Frankfort,\r\nwhere the largest body of them was assembled, and where they had formed\r\nan English congregation using king Edward's liturgy, this form of\r\nworship became the occasion of a division amongst themselves, and a\r\nstrong party soon declared itself in favor of discarding all of popish\r\nforms or doctrine which the English establishment, in common with the\r\nLutheran, had retained, and of adopting in their place the simpler\r\ncreed and ritual of the Genevan church.\r\n\r\nIt was found impracticable to compromise this difference; a considerable\r\nnumber finally seceded from the congregation, and it was from this\r\ndivision at Frankfort that English nonconformity took its birth. No\r\nequally strong manifestation of opinion occurred amongst the exiles in\r\nother cities; but on the whole it may be affirmed, that the majority of\r\nthese persons returned from their wanderings with their previous\r\npredilection for the Calvinistic model confirmed and augmented by the\r\nunited influence of the reasonings and persuasions of its ablest\r\napostles, and of those sentiments of love and hatred from which the\r\nspeculative opinions of most men receive an irresistible though secret\r\nbias.\r\n\r\nTheir more unfortunate brethren, in the mean time, who, unwilling to\r\nresign their country, or unable to escape from it, had been compelled to\r\nlook persecution in the face and deliberately acquaint themselves with\r\nall its horrors, were undergoing other and in some respects opposite\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nAn overpowering dread and abhorrence of the doctrines of the church of\r\nRome must so have absorbed all other thoughts and feelings in the minds\r\nof this dispersed and affrighted remnant of the English church, as to\r\nleave them little attention to bestow upon the comparatively trifling\r\nobjects of dispute between protestant and protestant. They might even be\r\ndisposed to regard such squabbles with emotions of indignation and\r\ndisgust, and to ask how brethren in affliction could have the heart to\r\nnourish animosities against each other. The memory of Edward VI. was\r\ndeservedly dear to them, and they would contemplate the restoration of\r\nhis ritual by the successor of Mary as an event in which they ought to\r\nregard all their prayers as fulfilled:--yet the practice, forced upon\r\nthem by the vigilance of persecution, of holding their assemblies for\r\ndivine worship in places unconsecrated, with the omission of every\r\ncustomary ceremonial and under the guidance frequently of men whom zeal\r\nand piety alone had ordained to the office of teachers and ministers of\r\nreligion, must amongst them also have been producing a secret alienation\r\nfrom established forms and rituals, and a propensity to those\r\nextemporaneous effusions of devotion, or urgencies of supplication,\r\nwhich seem best adapted to satisfy the wants of the pious soul under the\r\nfiery trial of persecution and distress. The Calvinistic model\r\ntherefore, as the freest of all, and that which most industriously\r\navoided any resemblance of popish forms, might be the one most likely to\r\nobtain their suffrage also.\r\n\r\nSuch being the state of religious opinion in England at the accession of\r\nElizabeth, it will not appear wonderful that the Genevan reformer should\r\nhave begun to indulge the flattering expectation of seeing his own\r\nscheme established in England as in Scotland, and himself revered\r\nthroughout the island as a spiritual director from whose decisions there\r\ncould be no appeal. Emboldened at once by zeal and ambition, he hastened\r\nto open a communication with the new government, in the shape of an\r\nexhortation to the queen to call a protestant council for establishing\r\nuniformity of doctrine and of church government; but his dream of\r\nsupremacy was quickly dissipated on receiving for answer, that England\r\nwas determined to preserve her episcopacy.\r\n\r\nThis decisive rejection of the presbyterian form was followed up by\r\nother acts on the part of the queen which gave offence to all the real\r\nfriends of reformed religion, and went far to prove that Elizabeth was\r\nat heart little more of a protestant than her father. The general\r\nprohibition of preaching, which was strictly enforced during the first\r\nmonths of her reign, was understood as a measure of repression levelled\r\nfull as much against the indiscreet zeal of the returned exiles, as\r\nagainst the disaffection of the catholics. An order that until the next\r\nmeeting of parliament no change should be made in the order of worship\r\nestablished by the late queen, except the reading of the creed and\r\ncommandments in English, implied, at least, a determination in the civil\r\npower to take the management of religion entirely out of the hands of a\r\nclergy whose influence over the minds of the people it viewed with a\r\njealous eye. It was soon also discovered, to the increasing horror of\r\nall true protestants, that the queen was strongly disposed to insist on\r\nthe celibacy of the clergy; and even when the strenuous efforts of Cecil\r\nand others had brought her to yield with reluctance this capital point,\r\nshe still pertinaciously refused to authorize their marrying by an\r\nexpress law. She would not even declare valid the marriages contracted\r\nby them during the reign of her brother; so that it became necessary to\r\nprocure private bills of legitimation in behalf of the offspring of\r\nthese unions, though formed under the express sanction of then existing\r\nlaws. The son of Cranmer himself, and the son of archbishop Parker, were\r\nof the number of those who found it necessary to resort to this\r\ndisagreeable and degrading expedient.\r\n\r\nOther things which offended the reformists were, the queen's\r\npredilection, already mentioned, for crucifixes, which she did not cause\r\nto be removed from the churches till after considerable delay and\r\ndifficulty, and retained in her private chapel for many years\r\nlonger,--and her wish to continue the use of altars. This being regarded\r\nas a dangerous compliance with the Romish doctrine, since an _altar_\r\ncould only suit with the notion of a _sacrifice_ of Christ in the mass,\r\nearnest expostulations on the subject were addressed to her by several\r\nof the leading divines; and in the end the queen found it expedient,\r\nwith whatever reluctance, to ordain the substitution of\r\ncommunion-tables.\r\n\r\nShe was also bent upon retaining in the church of which she was the head\r\nthe use of vestments similar to those worn by the different orders of\r\npopish priests in the celebration of the various offices of their\r\nreligion. A very natural association of ideas caused the protestant\r\nclergy to regard with suspicion and abhorrence such an approximation in\r\nexternals to that worship which was in their eyes the abomination of\r\nidolatry; and several of the returned exiles, to whom bishoprics were\r\nnow offered, scrupled to accept of them under the obligation of wearing\r\nthe appointed habits. Repeated and earnest representations were made to\r\nthe queen against them, but she remained inflexible. In this dilemma,\r\nthe divines requested the advice of Peter Martyr, who had quitted\r\nEngland on the accession of Mary and was now professor of theology at\r\nZurich. He persuaded compliance, representing to them that it was better\r\nthat high offices in the church should be occupied by persons like\r\nthemselves, though with the condition of submitting to some things which\r\nthey did not approve, than that such posts should be given to Lutherans\r\nor concealed catholics, who, instead of promoting any further\r\nreformation, would labor continually to bring back more and more of the\r\nancient ceremonies and superstitions. This argument was deemed\r\nconclusive, and the bishoprics were accepted. But such a plea, though it\r\nmight suffice certain men for a time, could not long satisfy\r\nuniversally; and we shall soon have occasion to take notice of scruples\r\non this point, as the source of the first intestine divisions by which\r\nthe Anglican church was disturbed, and of the first persecutions of her\r\nown children by which she disgraced herself.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it must be admitted that the personal conduct of Elizabeth\r\nin this momentous business exhibited neither enlargement of mind nor\r\nelevation of soul. Considerably attached to ceremonial observances, and\r\nsuperior to none of the superstitions which she might have imbibed in\r\nher childhood, she was however more attached to her own power and\r\nauthority than to these. Little under the influence of any individual\r\namongst her clergy, and somewhat inclined to treat that order in general\r\nwith harshness, if not cruelty,--as in the article of their marriages,\r\nin the unmitigated rigor with which she exacted from them her first\r\nfruits, and in the rapacity which she permitted her courtiers to\r\nexercise upon the temporalities of the bishoprics,--the only view which\r\nshe took of the subject was that of the sovereign and the politician.\r\nAware on one hand of the manner in which her title to the crown was\r\nconnected with the renunciation of papal authority, of the\r\nirreconcileable enmity borne her by the catholic powers, and of the\r\ngeneral attachment of her subjects to the cause of the reformation, she\r\nfelt herself called upon to assume the protection of the protestant\r\ninterest of Europe, and to re-establish that worship in her own\r\ndominions. On the other hand, she remarked with secret dread and\r\naversion the popular spirit and republican tendency of the institutions\r\nof Calvin, and she resolved at all hazards to check the growth of his\r\nopinions in England. Accordingly, it was the scope of every alteration\r\nmade by her in the service-book of Edward, to give it more of a Lutheran\r\naspect, and it was for some time apprehended that she would cause the\r\nentire Confession of Augsburg to be received into it.\r\n\r\nOf toleration, of the rights of conscience, she had as little feeling or\r\nunderstanding as any prince or polemic of her age. Her establishment was\r\nformed throughout in the spirit of compromise and political expediency;\r\nshe took no pains to ascertain, either by the assembling of a national\r\nsynod or by the submission of the articles to free discussion in\r\nparliament, whether or not they were likely to prove agreeable to the\r\nopinions of the majority; it sufficed that she had decreed their\r\nreception, and she prepared, by means of penal statutes strictly\r\nexecuted, to prevent the propagation of any doctrines, or the observance\r\nof any rites, capable of interfering with the exact uniformity in\r\nreligion then regarded as essential to the peace and stability of every\r\nwell constituted state.\r\n\r\nTo Cecil her chief secretary of state and to Nicholas Bacon her keeper\r\nof the seals, assisted by a select number of divines, the management of\r\nthis great affair was chiefly intrusted by the queen: and much might be\r\nsaid of the sagacity displayed by her in this appointment, and of the\r\nwisdom and moderation exercised by them in the discharge of their\r\noffice; much also might be, much has been said, of the excellencies of\r\nthe form of worship by them established;--but little, alas! of moral or\r\nof religious merit can be awarded by the verdict of impartial history to\r\nthe motives or conduct of the heroine of protestantism in a transaction\r\nso momentous and so memorable.\r\n\r\nThree acts of the parliament of 1559 gave the sanction of law to the new\r\necclesiastical establishment; they were those of Supremacy, of\r\nUniformity, and a third empowering the queen to appoint bishops. By the\r\nfirst, the authority of the pope was solemnly renounced, and the whole\r\ngovernment of the church vested in the queen, her heirs and successors;\r\nand an important clause further enabled her and them to delegate their\r\nauthority to commissioners of their own appointment, who amongst other\r\nextraordinary powers were to be invested with the cognisance of all\r\nerrors and heresies whatsoever. On this foundation was erected the\r\nfamous High Commission Court, which grew into one of the principal\r\ngrievances of this and the two following reigns, and of which, from the\r\nmoment of its formation, the proceedings assumed a character of\r\narbitrary violence utterly incompatible with the security and happiness\r\nof the subject, and hostile to the whole tenor of the ancient charters.\r\n\r\nThe act of Uniformity ordained an exact compliance in all points with\r\nthe established form of worship and a punctual attendance on its\r\noffices; it also rendered highly penal the exercise, public or private,\r\nof any other; and of this law it was not long before several unfortunate\r\ncatholics were doomed to experience the utmost rigor.\r\n\r\nMany parish priests who had been open and violent papists in the last\r\nreign, permitted themselves to take the oath of supremacy and retain\r\ntheir cures under the new order of things, a kind of compliance with the\r\ntimes which the court of Rome is said sometimes to have permitted,\r\nsometimes even to have privately enjoined,--on the principle of Peter\r\nMartyr, that it was better that its secret adherents should continue to\r\noccupy the churches, on whatever conditions, than that they should be\r\nsurrendered entirely into the hands of an opposite party. The bishops,\r\non the contrary, considered themselves as called upon by the dignity of\r\ntheir character and office to bear a public testimony against the\r\ndefection of England from the holy see; and those of them who had not\r\npreviously been deprived on other grounds, now in a body refused the\r\noaths and submitted themselves to the consequences. All were deprived, a\r\nfew imprisoned, several committed to honorable custody. The policy of\r\nElizabeth, unlike the genuine bigotry of her sister, contented itself\r\nwith a kind of negative intolerance; and as long as the degraded bishops\r\nabstained from all manifestations, by words or deeds, of hostility\r\nagainst her government and ecclesiastical establishment, and all\r\ncelebration of the peculiar rites of their religion, they were secure\r\nfrom molestation; and never to them, as to their unfortunate protestant\r\npredecessors, were articles of religion offered for signature under the\r\nfearful alternative of compliance or martyrdom.\r\n\r\nTo supply the vacancies of the episcopal bench became one of the\r\nearliest cares of the queen and her ministers; and their choice, which\r\nfell on the most eminent of the confessors and exiles, was generally\r\napproved by the nation.\r\n\r\nDr. Parker, formerly her mother's chaplain and the religious instructor\r\nof her own childhood, was designated by Elizabeth for the primacy. This\r\neminent divine had likewise been one of the chaplains of Edward VI., and\r\nenjoyed under his reign considerable church preferments. He had been the\r\nfriend of Cranmer, Bucer, Latimer, and Ridley; of Cook, Cheke, and\r\nCecil; and was the ardent coadjutor of these meritorious public\r\ncharacters in the promotion of reformed religion, and the advancement\r\nof general learning,--two grand objects, which were regarded by them as\r\ninseparable and almost identical.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Mary, being stripped of all his benefices as a\r\nmarried priest, Parker with his family was reduced to poverty and\r\ndistress; and it was only by a careful concealment of his person, by\r\nfrequent changes of place, and in some instances by the timely\r\nadvertisements of watchful friends, that he was enabled to avoid a still\r\nseverer trial of his constancy. During this period of distress he found\r\nsupport and solace from the pious task of translating into English metre\r\nthe whole of the Psalms. The version still exists in manuscript, and is\r\nexecuted with some spirit, and not inelegantly, in the old measure of\r\nfourteen syllables.\r\n\r\nParker's \"_Nolo episcopari_\" is supposed to have been more than\r\nordinarily sincere: in fact, the station of metropolitan must at this\r\njuncture have been felt as one of considerable difficulty, perhaps even\r\nof danger; and the stormy temper of the queen afterwards prepared for\r\nthe prelate so much of contradiction and humiliation as caused him more\r\nthan once to bewail his final acceptance of the highest dignity of the\r\nEnglish church.\r\n\r\nWith all her personal regard for the primate, Elizabeth could not always\r\nrefrain in his presence from reflections against married priests, which\r\ngave him great pain.\r\n\r\nDuring a progress which she made in 1561 into Essex and Suffolk, she\r\nexpressed high displeasure at finding so many of the clergy married,\r\nand the cathedrals and colleges so filled with women and children; and\r\nin consequence she addressed to the archbishop a royal injunction, \"that\r\nno head or member of any college or cathedral should bring a wife or any\r\nother woman into the precincts of it, to abide in the same, on pain of\r\nforfeiture of all ecclesiastical promotion.\" Parker regarded it as his\r\nduty to remonstrate with her in person against so popish a prohibition;\r\non which, after declaring to him that she repented of having made any\r\nmarried bishops, she went on to treat the institution of matrimony\r\nitself with a satire and contempt which filled him with horror.\r\n\r\nIt was to his wife that her majesty, in returning acknowledgements for\r\nthe magnificent hospitality with which she had been received at the\r\narchiepiscopal palace, made use of the well-known ungracious address;\r\n\"Madam I may not call you, mistress I am ashamed to call you, and so I\r\nknow not what to call you; but howsoever I thank you.\"\r\n\r\nBut these fits of ill-humor were transient; for Parker learned the art\r\nof dispelling them by submissions, or soothing them by the frequent and\r\nrespectful tender of splendid entertainments and costly gifts. He did\r\nnot long remain insensible to the charms of rank and fortune; and it\r\nmust not be concealed that an inordinate love of power, and a haughty\r\nintolerance of all opposition, gradually superseded that candor and\r\nChristian meekness of which he had formerly been cited as an edifying\r\nexample. Against that sect amongst the clergy who refused to adopt the\r\nappointed habits and scrupled some of the ceremonies, soon after\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of Puritans, he exercised his authority\r\nwith unsparing rigor; and even stretched it by degrees so far beyond all\r\nlegal bounds, that the queen herself, little as she was inclined to\r\ntolerate this sect or to resent any arbitrary conduct in her\r\ncommissioners, was moved at length to interpose and reverse some of his\r\nproceedings. The archbishop, now become incapable of yielding his own\r\nwill even to that of his sovereign, complained and remonstrated instead\r\nof submitting: reproaches ensued on the part of Elizabeth; and in May\r\n1575 the learned prelate ended in a kind of disgrace the career which he\r\nhad long pursued amid the warmest testimonies of royal approbation.\r\n\r\nThe fairest, at least the most undisputed, claim of this eminent prelate\r\nto the gratitude of his contemporaries and the respect of posterity, is\r\nfounded on the character which his high station enabled him to assume\r\nand maintain, of the most munificent patron of letters of his age and\r\ncountry. The study which he particularly encouraged, and to which his\r\nown leisure was almost exclusively devoted, was that of English\r\nantiquities; and he formed and presented to Corpus Christi college a\r\nlarge and valuable collection of the manuscripts relative to these\r\nobjects which had been scattered abroad at the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries, and must have been irretrievably lost but for his diligence\r\nin inquiring after them and the liberality with which he rewarded their\r\ndiscovery. He edited four of our monkish historians; was the first\r\npublisher of that interesting specimen of early English satire and\r\nversification, Pierce Plowman's Visions; composed a history in Latin of\r\nhis predecessors in the see of Canterbury, and encouraged the labors of\r\nmany private scholars by acts of generosity and kindness.\r\n\r\nGrindal, a divine of eminence, who during his voluntary exile at\r\nFrankfort had taken a strong part in favor of king Edward's\r\nService-book, was named as the successor of Bonner in the bishopric of\r\nLondon; but a considerable time was spent in overcoming his objections\r\nto the habits and ceremonies, before he could be prevailed upon to\r\nassume a charge of which he deeply felt the importance and\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nTo the reputation of learning and piety which this prelate enjoyed in\r\ncommon with so many of his clerical contemporaries, he added an\r\nextraordinary earnestness in the promotion of Christian knowledge, and a\r\ncourageous inflexibility on points of professional duty, imitated by few\r\nand excelled by none. His manly spirit disdained that slavish\r\nobsequiousness by which too many of his episcopal brethren paid homage\r\nto the narrow prejudices and state-jealousies of an imperious mistress,\r\nand it soon became evident that strife and opposition awaited him.\r\n\r\nHis first difference was with archbishop Parker, whom he highly offended\r\nby his backwardness in proceeding to extremities against the puritans, a\r\nsect many of whose scruples Grindal himself had formerly entertained,\r\nand was still inclined to view with respect or pity rather than with\r\nindignation. Cecil, who was his chief friend and patron, apprehensive of\r\nhis involving himself in trouble, gladly seized an occasion of\r\nwithdrawing him from the contest, by procuring his appointment in 1570\r\nto the vacant archbishopric of York; a hitherto neglected province, in\r\nwhich his efforts for the instruction of the people and the reformation\r\nof the state of the church were peculiarly required and eminently\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nFor his own repose, Grindal ought never to have quitted this sphere of\r\nunmolested usefulness; but when, on the death of Parker in 1575, the\r\nprimacy was offered to him, ambition, or perhaps the hope of rendering\r\nhis plans more extensively beneficial, unfortunately prompted its\r\nacceptance. Thus was he brought once more within the uncongenial\r\natmosphere of a court, and subjected to the immediate control of his\r\nsovereign in matters on which he regarded it as a duty, on the double\r\nground of conscience and the rights of his office, to resist the fiat of\r\na temporal head of the church.\r\n\r\nThe queen, whose dread and hatred of the puritans augmented with the\r\nseverities which she exercised against them, had conceived a violent\r\naversion to certain meetings called prophesyings, at this time held by\r\nthe clergy for the purpose of exercising their younger members in\r\nexpounding the Scriptures, and at which the laity had begun to attend as\r\nauditors in great numbers and with much interest. Such assemblies, her\r\nmajesty declared, were nothing else than so many schools of puritanism,\r\nwhere the people learned to be so inquisitive that their spiritual\r\nsuperiors would soon lose all influence over them, and she issued\r\npositive commands to Grindal for their suppression. At the same time\r\nshe expressed to him her extreme displeasure at the number of preachers\r\nlicensed in his province, and required that it should be very\r\nconsiderably lessened, \"urging that it was good for the world to have\r\nfew preachers, that three or four might suffice for a county; and that\r\nthe reading of the homilies to the people was enough.\" But the venerable\r\nprimate, so far from consenting to abridge the means of that religious\r\ninstruction which he regarded it as the most sacred duty of a protestant\r\nchurch to afford, took the freedom of addressing to her majesty a very\r\nplain and earnest letter of expostulation. In this piece, after showing\r\nthe great necessity which existed for multiplying, rather than\r\ndiminishing, opportunities of edification both to the clergy and the\r\npeople, and protesting that he could not in conscience be instrumental\r\nto the suppression either of preaching or prophesyings, he proceeded to\r\nremonstrate with her majesty on the arbitrary, imperious, and as it were\r\npapal manner, in which she took upon herself to decide points better\r\nleft to the management of her bishops. He ended by exhorting her to\r\nremember that she also was a mortal creature, and accountable to God for\r\nthe exercise of her power, and that she ought above all things to be\r\ndesirous of employing it piously for the promotion of true religion.\r\n\r\nThe event showed this remonstrance to be rather well-intended than\r\nwell-judged. Indignation was the only sentiment which it awakened in the\r\nhaughty mind of Elizabeth, and she answered it by an order of the\r\nStar-chamber, in virtue of which the archbishop was suspended from his\r\nfunctions for six months, and confined during the same period to his\r\nhouse. At the end of this time he was urged by Burleigh to acknowledge\r\nhimself in fault and beg the queen's forgiveness but he steadily refused\r\nto compromise thus a good cause, and his sequestration was continued. It\r\neven appears that nothing but the honest indignation of some of her\r\nministers and courtiers restrained the queen from proceeding to deprive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt the end of four or five years, her anger being somewhat abated, it\r\npleased her to take off the sequestration, but without restoring the\r\nprimate to her favor; and as he was now old and blind, he willingly\r\nconsented to resign the primacy and retire on a pension: but in 1583,\r\nbefore the matter could be finally arranged, he died.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Grindal was a great contributor to Fox's \"Acts and\r\nMonuments,\" for which he collected many materials; but he was the author\r\nof no considerable work, and on the whole he seems to have been less\r\nadmirable by the display of any extraordinary talents than revered and\r\nexemplary for the primitive virtues of probity, sincerity, and godly\r\nzeal. These were the qualities which obtained for him the celebration of\r\nSpenser in his \"Shepherd's Calendar,\" where he is designated by the name\r\nof Algrind, and described as a true teacher of the Gospel and a severe\r\nreprover of the pride and worldliness of the popish clergy. The lines\r\nwere written during the period of the prelate's disgrace, which is\r\nallegorically related and bewailed by the poet.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished ornament of the episcopal bench was Jewel,\r\nconsecrated to the see of Salisbury in 1560. It is remarkable that this\r\nlearned apologist of the church of England had expressed at first a\r\nstronger repugnance to the habits than most of his colleagues; but\r\nhaving once brought himself to compliance, he thenceforth became noted\r\nfor the rigor with which he exacted it of others.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Henry VIII. Jewel had become suspected of opinions which\r\nhe openly embraced on the accession of Edward, and he was sufficiently\r\ndistinguished amongst the reformers of this reign to be marked out as\r\none of the first objects of persecution under Mary. As a preliminary\r\nstep, on which proceedings might be founded, the Romish articles were\r\noffered for his signature, when he disappointed alike his enemies and\r\nhis friends by subscribing them without apparent reluctance. But his\r\ninsincerity in this act was notorious, and it was in contemplation to\r\nsubject him to the fierce interrogatories of Bonner, when timely warning\r\nenabled him, through many perils, to escape out of the country. Safe\r\narrived at Frankfort, he made a public confession, before the English\r\ncongregation, of his guilt in signing articles which his conscience\r\nabhorred, and humbly entreated forgiveness of God and the church. After\r\nthis, he repaired to Strasburgh and passed away the time with his friend\r\nPeter Martyr.\r\n\r\nThe erudition of Jewel was profound and extensive, his private life\r\namiable, his performance of his episcopal duties sedulous; and such was\r\nthe esteem in which his celebrated \"Apology\" was held, that Elizabeth,\r\nand afterwards James I., ordained that a copy of it should be kept in\r\nevery parish-church in England.\r\n\r\nOf Dr. Cox, elevated to the see of Ely, mention has already been made;\r\nand it would be superfluous here to enter more largely into the\r\necclesiastical history of the reign.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the behaviour of Elizabeth towards the two\r\nsuccessive primates Parker and Grindal, will furnish a sufficiently\r\naccurate notion of the spirit of her religious policy, besides affording\r\na valuable addition to the characteristic traits illustrative of her\r\ntemper and opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIIIa.\r\n\r\n1561.\r\n\r\nTragedy of Ferrex and Porrex.--Translations of ancient tragedies.--Death\r\nof Francis II.--Mary refuses to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh--returns\r\nto Scotland.--Enmity between Mary and Elizabeth.--Philip II. secretly\r\nencourages the English papists.--Measures of rigor adopted against them\r\nby Elizabeth.--Anecdote of the queen and Dr. Sampson.--St. Paul's struck\r\nby lightning.--Bishop Pilkington's sermon on the occasion.--Paul's\r\nWalk.--Precautions against the queen's being poisoned.--The king of\r\nSweden proposes to visit her.--Steps taken in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth of January 1561 ought to be celebrated as the birthday of\r\nthe English drama; for it was on this day that Thomas Sackville caused\r\nto be represented at Whitehall, for the entertainment of Elizabeth and\r\nher court, the tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex, otherwise called Gorboduc,\r\nthe joint production of himself and Thomas Norton. From the unrivalled\r\nforce of imagination, the vigor and purity of diction, and the intimate\r\nknowledge and tasteful adaptation of the beauties of the Latin poets\r\ndisplayed in the contributions of Sackville to the Mirror of\r\nMagistrates, a lettered audience would conceive high expectations from\r\nhis attempt in a new walk of poetry; but in the then barbarous state of\r\nour Theatre, such a performance as Gorboduc must have been hailed as\r\nnot only a novelty but a wonder. It was the first piece composed in\r\nEnglish on the ancient tragic model, with a regular division into five\r\nacts, closed by lyric choruses.\r\n\r\nIt offered the first example of a story from British history, or what\r\npassed for history, completely dramatized and represented with an\r\nattempt at theatrical illusion; for the earlier pieces published under\r\nthe title of tragedies were either ballads or monologues, which might\r\nindeed be sung or recited, but were incapable of being acted. The plot\r\nof the play was fraught with those circumstances of the deepest horror\r\nby which the dormant sensibilities of an inexperienced audience require\r\nand delight to be awakened. An unwonted force of thought and dignity of\r\nlanguage claimed the patience, if not the admiration, of the hearers,\r\nfor the long political disquisitions by which the business of the piece\r\nwas somewhat painfully retarded.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity of the public respecting a drama which had been performed\r\nwith general applause both at court and before the society of the Middle\r\nTemple, encouraged its surreptitious appearance in print in 1565, and a\r\nsecond stolen edition was followed, some years after, by a corrected one\r\npublished under the inspection of the authors themselves. The taste for\r\nthe legitimate drama thus awakened, may be supposed to have led to the\r\nnaturalization amongst us of several of its best ancient models. The\r\nPhoenissae of Euripides appeared under the title of Jocasta, having\r\nreceived an English dress from Gascoigne and Kinwelmershe, two students\r\nof Gray's Inn. The ten tragedies of Seneca, englished by different\r\nhands, succeeded. It is worthy of note, however, that none of these\r\ntranslators had the good taste to imitate the authors of Ferrex and\r\nPorrex in the adoption of blank verse, and that one only amongst them\r\nmade use of the heroic rhymed couplet; the others employing the old\r\nalexandrine measure, excepting in the choruses, which were given in\r\nvarious kinds of stanza. Her majesty alone seems to have perceived the\r\nsuperior advantages, or to have been tempted by the greater facility of\r\nSackville's verse; and amongst the MSS. of the Bodleian library there is\r\nfound a translation by her own hand of part of Seneca's Hercules Oetaeus,\r\nwhich is in this measure. Warton however adds, that this specimen \"has\r\nno other recommendation than its royalty.\"\r\n\r\nThe propensity of Elizabeth, amid all the serious cares of government\r\nand all the pettinesses of that political intrigue to which she was\r\naddicted, to occupy herself with attempts in polite literature, for\r\nwhich she possessed no manner of talent, is not the least remarkable\r\namong the features of her extraordinary and complicated character.\r\n\r\nAt the period of her reign however which we are now considering, public\r\naffairs must have required from her an almost undivided attention. By\r\nthe death of Francis II. about the end of the year 1560, the queen of\r\nScots had become a widow, and the relations of England with France and\r\nScotland had immediately assumed an entirely novel aspect.\r\n\r\nThe change was in one respect highly to the advantage of Elizabeth. By\r\nthe loss of her royal husband, Mary was deprived of that command over\r\nthe resources of the French monarchy by which she had hoped to render\r\neffective her claim to the English crown, and she found it expedient to\r\ndiscontinue for the present the use of the royal arms of England. The\r\nenmity of the queen-mother had even chased her from that court where she\r\nhad reigned so lately, and obliged her to retire to her uncle, the\r\ncardinal of Lorrain at Rheims. But from the age and temper of the\r\nbeautiful and aspiring Mary, it was to be expected that she would ere\r\nlong be induced to re-enter the matrimonial state with some one of the\r\nprinces of Europe; and neither as a sovereign nor a woman could\r\nElizabeth regard without jealousy the plans for her reestablishment\r\nalready agitated by her ambitious uncles of the house of Guise. Under\r\nthese circumstances, it was the first object of Elizabeth to obtain from\r\nher rival the formal ratification, which had hitherto been withheld, of\r\nthe treaty of Edinburgh, by one article of which Mary was pledged never\r\nto resume the English arms; and Throgmorton, then ambassador to France,\r\nwas instructed to urge strongly her immediate compliance with this\r\ncertainly not inequitable demand. The queen of Scots, however, persisted\r\nin evading its fulfilment, and on pleas so forced and futile as justly\r\nto confirm all previous suspicions of her sincerity.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this state between the two sovereigns, when Mary came to\r\nthe resolution of acceding to the unanimous entreaties of her subjects\r\nof both religions, by returning to govern in person the kingdom of her\r\nancestors; and she sent to request of Elizabeth a safe-conduct. The\r\nEnglish princess promptly replied, that the queen had only to ratify the\r\ntreaty of Edinburgh, and she should obtain not merely a safe-conduct but\r\nfree permission to shorten the fatigues of her voyage by passing through\r\nEngland, where she should be received with all the marks of affection\r\ndue to a beloved sister. By this answer Mary chose to regard herself as\r\ninsulted; and declaring to the English ambassador in great heat that\r\nnothing vexed her so much as to have exposed herself without necessity\r\nto such a refusal, and that she doubted not that she should be able to\r\nreturn to her country without the permission of Elizabeth, as she had\r\nquitted it in spite of all the vigilance of her brother, she abruptly\r\nbroke off the conference.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the breach between these illustrious kinswomen became\r\nirreparable. In vain did Mary, after her arrival in Scotland, endeavour\r\nto remedy the imprudence which she was conscious of having committed, by\r\nprofessions of respect and friendship; for with these hollow compliments\r\nshe had the further indiscretion to mingle the demand that Elizabeth\r\nshould publicly declare her next heir to the English throne; a proposal\r\nwhich this high-spirited princess could never hear without rage. Neither\r\nof the queens was a novice in the arts of dissimulation, and as often as\r\nit suited the interest or caprice of the moment, each would lavish upon\r\nthe other, without scruple, every demonstration of amity, every pledge\r\nof affection; but jealousy, suspicion, and hatred dwelt irremoveably in\r\nthe inmost recesses of their hearts. The protestant party in Scotland\r\nwas powerfully protected by Elizabeth, the catholic party in England was\r\nsecretly incited by Mary; and it became scarcely less the care and\r\noccupation of each to disturb the administration of her rival than to\r\nfix her own on a solid basis.\r\n\r\nMary had been attended on her return to Scotland by her three uncles,\r\nthe duke of Aumale, the grand prior and the marquis of Elbeuf, with a\r\nnumerous retinue of French nobility; and when after a short visit the\r\nduke and the grand prior took their leave of her, they with their\r\ncompany consisting of more than a hundred returned through England,\r\nvisiting in their way the court of Elizabeth. Brantome, who was of the\r\nparty, has given incidentally the following particulars of their\r\nentertainment in the short memoir which he has devoted to the\r\ncelebration of Henry II. of France.\r\n\r\n\"Bref, c'estoit un roy tres accomply & fort aymable. J'ay ouy conter a\r\nla reigne d'Angleterre qui est aujourd'huy, que c'estoit le roy & le\r\nprince du monde qu'elle avoit plus desire de voir, pour le beau rapport\r\nqu'on luy en avoit fait, & pour sa grande renommee qui en voloit par\r\ntout. Monsieur le connestable qui vit aujourd'huy s'en pourra bien\r\nressouvenir, ce fut lorsque retournant d'Escosse M. le grand prieur de\r\nFrance, de la maison de Lorreine, & luy, la reigne leur donna un soir a\r\nsoupper, ou apres se fit un ballet de ses filles, qu'elle avoit ordonne\r\n& dresse, representant les vierges de l'evangile, desquelles les unes\r\navoient leurs lampes allumees & les autres n'avoient ny huile ny feu &\r\nen demandoient. Ces lampes estoient d'argent fort gentiment faites &\r\nelabourees, & les dames etoient tres-belles & honnestes & bien apprises,\r\nqui prirent nous autres Francois pour danser, mesme la reigne dansa, &\r\nde fort bonne grace & belle majeste royale, car elle l'avoit & estoit\r\nlors en sa grande beaute & belle grace. Rien ne l'a gastee que\r\nl'execution de la pauvre reigne d'Escosse, sans cela c'estoit une\r\ntres-rare princesse.\r\n\r\n\"...Estant ainsi a table devisant familierement avec ces seigneurs, elle\r\ndit ces mots, (apres avoir fort louee le roy): C'estoit le prince du\r\nmonde que j'avois plus desire de voir, & luy avois deja mande que\r\nbientost je le verrois, & pour ce j'avois commande de me faire bien\r\nappareiller mes galeres (usant de ces mots) pour passer en France expres\r\npour le voir. Monsieur le connestable, d'aujourd'huy, qui estoit lors\r\nMonsieur d'Amville, respondit, Madame, je m'asseure que vous eussiez\r\neste tres-contente de le voir, car son humeur & sa facon vous eussent\r\npleu; aussi lui eust il este tres-content de vous voir, car il eust fort\r\naime votre belle humeur & vos agreables facons, & vous eust fait un\r\nhonorable accueil & tres-bonne chere, & vous eust bien fait passer le\r\ntemps. Je le croy & m'en asseure, dit elle.\" &c.\r\n\r\nBy the death of the king of France, and the increasing distractions of\r\nthat unhappy country under the feeble minority of Charles IX., the\r\npolitics of the king of Spain also were affected. He had not now to fear\r\nthe union of the crowns of England France and Scotland under the joint\r\nrule of Francis and Mary, which he had once regarded as a not\r\nimprobable event; consequently his strongest inducement for keeping\r\nmeasures with Elizabeth ceased to operate, and he began daily to\r\ndisclose more and more of that animosity with which he could not fail to\r\nregard a princess who was at once the heroine and patroness of\r\nprotestantism. From this time he began to furnish secret aids which\r\nadded hope and courage to the English partisans of popery and of Mary;\r\nand Elizabeth judged it a necessary policy to place her catholic\r\nsubjects under a more rigid system of restraint. It was contrary to her\r\nprivate inclinations to treat this sect with severity, and she was the\r\nmore reluctant to do so as she thus gratified in an especial manner the\r\nwishes of the puritanical or Calvinistic party in the church, their\r\ninveterate enemies; and by identifying in some measure her cause with\r\ntheirs, saw herself obliged to conform in several points to their views\r\nrather than her own wishes.\r\n\r\nThe law which rendered it penal to hear mass was first put in force\r\nagainst several persons of rank, that the example might strike the more\r\nterror. Sir Edward Waldegrave, in Mary's reign a privy-councillor, was\r\non this account committed to the Tower, with his lady and some others;\r\nand lord Loughborough, also a privy-councillor much favored and trusted\r\nby the late queen, was brought into trouble on the same ground. Against\r\nWaldegrave it is to be feared that much cruelty was exercised during his\r\nimprisonment; for it is said to have occasioned his death, which\r\noccurred in the Tower a few months afterwards. The High Commission\r\ncourt now began to take cognisance of what was called recusancy, or the\r\nrefusal to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy; it also\r\nencouraged informations against such as refrained from joining in the\r\nestablished worship; and numerous professors of the old religion, both\r\necclesiastics and laity, were summoned on one account or other before\r\nthis tribunal. Of these, some were committed to prison, others\r\nrestricted from entering certain places, as the two universities, or\r\ncircumscribed within the limits of some town or county; and most were\r\nbound in great penalties to be forthcoming whenever it should be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAs a further demonstration of zeal against popery, the queen caused all\r\nthe altars in Westminster abbey to be pulled down; and about the same\r\ntime a remarkable scene occurred between her majesty and Dr. Thomas\r\nSampson dean of Christ-church.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the queen had appointed to go to St. Paul's on New\r\nYear's day to hear the dean preach; and he, thinking to gratify her on\r\nthat day with an elegant and appropriate present, had procured some\r\nprints illustrative of the histories of the saints and martyrs, which he\r\ncaused to be inserted in a richly bound prayer-book and laid on the\r\nqueen's cushion for her use. Her majesty opened the volume; but no\r\nsooner did the prints meet her eye, than she frowned, blushed, and\r\ncalled to the verger to bring her the book she was accustomed to use. As\r\nsoon as the service was ended, she went into the vestry and inquired of\r\nthe dean who had brought that book? and when he explained that he had\r\nmeant it as a present to her majesty, she chid him severely, inquired if\r\nhe was ignorant of her proclamation against images, pictures, and Romish\r\nreliques in the churches, and of her aversion to all idolatry, and\r\nstrictly ordered that no similar mistake should be made in future. What\r\nrenders this circumstance the more curious is, that Elizabeth at this\r\nvery time kept a crucifix in her private chapel, and that Sampson was so\r\nfar from being popishly inclined, that he had refused the bishopric of\r\nNorwich the year before, on account of the habits and ceremonies, and\r\nwas afterwards deprived of his deanery by archbishop Parker for\r\nnonconformity.\r\n\r\nNever did parties in religion run higher than about this period of the\r\nreign of Elizabeth; and we may remark as symptomatic of the temper of\r\nthe times, the manner in which a trivial accident was commented upon by\r\nadverse disputants. The beautiful steeple of St. Paul's cathedral, the\r\nloftiest in the kingdom, had been stricken by lightning and utterly\r\ndestroyed, together with the bells and roof. A papist immediately\r\ndispersed a paper representing this accident as a judgement of Heaven\r\nfor the discontinuance of the matins and other services which had used\r\nto be performed in the church at different hours of the day and night.\r\nPilkington bishop of Durham, who preached at Paul's cross after the\r\naccident, was equally disposed to regard it as a judgement, but on the\r\nsins of London in general, and particularly on certain abuses by which\r\nthe church had formerly been polluted. In a tract published in answer to\r\nthat of the papist he afterwards gave an animated description of the\r\npractices of which this cathedral had been the theatre; curious at the\r\npresent day as a record of forgotten customs. He said that \"no place had\r\nbeen more abused than Paul's had been, nor more against the receiving of\r\nChrist's Gospel; wherefore it was more wonder that God had spared it so\r\nlong, than that he overthrew it now.... From the top of the spire, at\r\ncoronations or other solemn triumphs, some for vain glory had used to\r\nthrow themselves down by a rope, and so killed themselves, vainly to\r\nplease other men's eyes. At the battlements of the steeple, sundry times\r\nwere used their popish anthems, to call upon their Gods, with torch and\r\ntaper, in the evenings. In the top of one of the pinnacles was Lollards'\r\nTower, where many an innocent soul had been by them cruelly tormented\r\nand murdered. In the middest alley was their long censer, reaching from\r\nthe roof to the ground; as though the Holy Ghost came down in their\r\ncensing, in likeness of a dove. In the arches, men commonly complained\r\nof wrong and delayed judgments in ecclesiastical causes: and divers had\r\nbeen condemned there by Annas and Caiaphas for Christ's cause. Their\r\nimages hung on every wall, pillar and door, with their pilgrimages and\r\nworshipings of them: passing over their massing and many altars, and the\r\nrest of their popish service. The south alley was for usury and popery,\r\nthe north for simony; and the horse fair in the midst for all kind of\r\nbargains, meetings, brawlings, murders, conspiracies. The font for\r\nordinary payments of money as well known to all men as the beggar knows\r\nhis dish.... So that without and within, above the ground and under,\r\nover the roof and beneath, from the top of the steeple and spire down to\r\nthe low floor, not one spot was free from wickedness.\"\r\n\r\nThe practice here alluded to, of making the nave of St. Paul's a kind of\r\nexchange for the transaction of all kinds of business, and a place of\r\nmeeting for idlers of every sort, is frequently referred to by the\r\nwriters of this and the two succeeding reigns; and when or by what means\r\nthe custom was put an end to, does not appear. It was here that sir\r\nNicholas Throgmorton held a conference with an emissary of Wyat's; it\r\nwas here that one of the bravoes engaged in the noted murder of Arden of\r\nFeversham was hired. It was in Paul's that Falstaff is made to say he\r\n\"bought\" Bardolph.\r\n\r\nIn bishop Earl's admirable little book called Micro-cosmography the\r\nscene is described with all the wit of the author and somewhat of the\r\nquaintness of his age, which was that of James I.\r\n\r\n\"_Paul's walk_ is the land's epitome, or you may call it the lesser isle\r\nof Great Britain. It is, more than this, the whole world's map, which\r\nyou may here discern in its perfectest motion, justling, and turning. It\r\nis the great exchange of all discourse, and no business whatsoever but\r\nis here stirring and afoot. It is the synod of all pates politic, joined\r\nand laid together in most serious posture, and they are not half so busy\r\nat the parliament.... It is the market of young lecturers, whom you may\r\ncheapen here at all rates and sizes. It is the general mint of all\r\nfamous lies, which are here, like the legends of popery, first coined\r\nand stamped in the church. All inventions are emptied here, and not a\r\nfew pockets. The best sign of a temple in it is, that it is the thieves\r\nsanctuary.... The visitants are, all men without exception, but the\r\nprincipal inhabitants and possessors are, stale knights, and captains\r\nout of service, men of long rapiers and breeches which, after all, turn\r\nmerchants here, and traffic for news. Some make it a preface to their\r\ndinner, but thriftier men make it their ordinary, and board here very\r\ncheap.\"\r\n\r\nThe vigilant ministers of Elizabeth had now begun to alarm themselves\r\nand her with apprehensions of plots against her life from the malice of\r\nthe papists; and it would be rash to pronounce that such fears were\r\nentirely void of foundation; but we may be permitted to smile at the\r\nignorant credulity on the subject of poisons,--universal indeed in that\r\nage,--which dictated the following minute of council, extant in the\r\nhandwriting of Cecil. \"We think it very convenient that your majesty's\r\napparel, and specially all manner of things that shall touch any part of\r\nyour majesty's body bare, be circumspectly looked unto; and that no\r\nperson be permitted to come near it, but such as have the trust and\r\ncharge thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Item. That no manner of perfume either in apparel or sleeves, gloves or\r\nsuch like, or otherwise that shall be appointed for your majesty's\r\nsavor, be presented by any stranger or other person, but that the same\r\nbe corrected by some other fume.\r\n\r\n\"Item. That no foreign meat or dishes being dressed out of your\r\nmajesty's court, be brought to your food, without assured knowledge from\r\nwhom the same cometh; and that no use be had hereof.\r\n\r\n\"Item. That it may please your majesty to take the advice of your\r\nphysician for the receiving weekly twice some preservative 'contra\r\npestem et venena,' as there be many good things 'et salutaria.'\r\n\r\n\"Item. It may please your majesty to give order who shall take the\r\ncharge of the back doors to your chamberers chambers, where landresses,\r\ntailors, wardrobers, and the like, use to come; and that the same doors\r\nbe duly attended upon, as becometh, and not to stand open but upon\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\"Item. That the privy chamber may be better ordered, with an attendance\r\nof an usher, and the gentlemen and grooms[48].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 48: \"Burleigh Papers\" by Haynes, p. 368.]\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the same exaggerated notions of the power of\r\npoisons prevailed amongst papists as protestants. Against the ill\r\neffects of a drug applied by direction of a Spanish friar to the arms of\r\na chair and the pommel of a saddle, the antidotes received twice a week\r\nmight be depended upon as an effectual preservative.\r\n\r\nFrom these perils, real and imaginary,--none of which however appear to\r\nhave taken strong hold of the cheerful and courageous temper of the\r\nqueen,--her attention and that of her council was for some time diverted\r\nby the expectation of a royal suitor.\r\n\r\nEric king of Sweden,--whose hopes of final success in his addresses were\r\nkept up in spite of the repeated denials of the queen, by the artifice\r\nof some Englishmen at his court who deluded him by pretended secret\r\nintelligence,--had sent to her majesty a royal present, and declared his\r\nintention of following in person. The present consisted of eighteen\r\nlarge piebald horses, and two ship-loads of precious articles which are\r\nnot particularized. It does not appear that this offering was\r\nill-received; but as Elizabeth was determined not to relent in favor of\r\nthe sender, she caused him to be apprized of the impositions passed upon\r\nhim by the English to whom he had given ear, at the same time expressing\r\nher anxious hope that he would spare himself the fatigues of a fruitless\r\nvoyage. Fearing however that he might be already on his way, she\r\noccupied herself in preparations for receiving him with all the\r\nhospitality and splendor due to his errand, his rank and her own honor.\r\nIt was at the same time a business of some perplexity so to regulate all\r\nthese matters of ceremony that neither Eric himself nor others might\r\nconclude that he was a favored suitor. Among the state papers of the\r\ntime we find, first a letter of council to the lord mayor, setting\r\nforth, that, \"Whereas certain bookbinders and stationers did utter\r\ncertain papers wherein were printed the face of her majesty and the king\r\nof Sweden; although her majesty was not miscontented that either her own\r\nface or that of this king should be pourtrayed; yet to be joined in the\r\nsame paper with him or any other prince who was known to have made\r\nrequest for marriage to her, was what she could not allow. Accordingly\r\nit was her pleasure that the lord mayor should seize all such papers,\r\nand pack them up so that none of them should get abroad. Otherwise she\r\nmight seem to authorize this joining of herself in marriage to him,\r\nwhich might seem to touch her in honor.\" Next we have a letter to the\r\nduke of Norfolk directing the manner in which he should go to meet the\r\nking, if he landed at any part of Norfolk or Suffolk: and lastly, we\r\nhave the solemn judgement of the lord-treasurer, the lord-steward, and\r\nthe lord-chamberlain, on the ceremonial to be observed towards him on\r\nhis arrival by the queen herself.\r\n\r\nOne paragraph is conceived with all the prudery and the deep policy\r\nabout trifles, which marked the character of Elizabeth herself. \"Bycause\r\nthe queen's majesty is a maid, in this case would many things be omitted\r\nof honor and courtesy, which otherwise were mete to be showed to him, as\r\nin like cases hath been of kings of this land to others, and therefore\r\nit shall be necessary that the gravest of her council do, as of their\r\nown judgement, excuse the lack thereof to the king; and yet on their own\r\nparts offer the supplement thereof with reverence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all, the king of Sweden never came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIIIb.\r\n\r\n1561 TO 1565.\r\n\r\nDifficulties respecting the succession.--Lady C.

Her avowed repugnance to marriage, which was now feared to be\r\ninsurmountable, kept the minds of men continually busy on this\r\ndangerous topic, and she was already incurring the blame of many by the\r\nbackwardness which she discovered in designating a successor and causing\r\nher choice to be confirmed, as it would readily have been, by the\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nBut this censure must be regarded as unjust. Even though the jealousy of\r\npower had found no entrance into the bosom of Elizabeth, sound policy\r\nrequired her long to deliberate before she formed a decision, and\r\nperhaps, whatever that decision might be, forbade her, under present\r\ncircumstances, to announce it to the world.\r\n\r\nThe title of the queen of Scots, otherwise unquestionable, was barred by\r\nthe will of Henry VIII., ratified by an unrepealed act of parliament,\r\nand nothing less solemn than a fresh act of the whole legislature would\r\nhave been sufficient to render it perfectly free from objection: and\r\ncould Elizabeth be in reason expected to take such a step in behalf of a\r\nforeign and rival sovereign, professing a religion hostile to her own\r\nand that of her people; of one, above all, who had openly pretended a\r\nright to the crown preferable to her own, and who was even now\r\nexhausting the whole art of intrigue to undermine and supplant her?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to confirm the exclusion of the Scottish line, and\r\nadopt as her successor the representative of that of Suffolk, appeared\r\nneither safe nor equitable.\r\n\r\nThe testamentary disposition of Henry had evidently been dictated by\r\ncaprice and resentment, and the title of Mary was nevertheless held\r\nsacred and indisputable not only by all the catholics, but by the\r\npartisans of strict hereditary right in general, and by all who duly\r\nappretiated the benefits which must flow from an union of the English\r\nand Scottish sceptres. To inflict a mortal injury on Mary might be as\r\ndangerous as to give her importance by an express law establishing her\r\nclaims, and against any perils in which Elizabeth might thus involve\r\nherself the house of Suffolk could afford her no accession of strength,\r\nsince their allegiance,--all they had to offer,--was hers already.\r\n\r\nThe lady Catherine Grey, the heiress of this house, might indeed have\r\nbeen united in marriage to some protestant prince, whose power would\r\nhave acted as a counterpoise to that of Scotland. But a secret and\r\nreluctant persuasion that the real right was with the Scottish line,\r\nconstantly operated on the mind of Elizabeth so far as to prevent her\r\nfrom taking any step towards the advancement of the rival family; and\r\nthe unfortunate lady Catherine was doomed to undergo all the restraints,\r\nthe persecutions and the sufferings, which in that age formed the\r\nmelancholy appanage of the younger branches of the royal race, with\r\nlittle participation of the homage or the hopes which some minds would\r\nhave accepted as an adequate compensation.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, that the hand of this high-born lady was given to\r\nlord Herbert, son of the earl of Pembroke, on the same day that\r\nGuildford Dudley fatally received that of her elder sister the lady\r\nJane; and that on the accession of Mary this short-lived and perhaps\r\nuncompleted union had been dissolved at the instance of the politic\r\nfather of lord Herbert. From this time lady Catherine had remained in\r\nneglect and obscurity till the year 1560, when information of her having\r\nformed a private connexion with the earl of Hertford, son of the\r\nProtector Somerset, reached the ears of Elizabeth. The lady, on being\r\nquestioned, confessed her pregnancy, declaring herself at the same time\r\nto be the lawful wife of the earl: her degree of relationship to the\r\nqueen was not so near as to render her marriage without the royal\r\nconsent illegal, yet by a stretch of authority familiar to the Tudors\r\nshe was immediately sent prisoner to the Tower. Hertford, in the mean\r\ntime, was summoned to produce evidence of the marriage, by a certain\r\nday, before special commissioners named by her majesty, from whose\r\ndecision no appeal was to lie. He was at this time in France, and so\r\nearly a day was designedly fixed for his answer, that he found it\r\nimpracticable to collect his proofs in time, and to the Tower he also\r\nwas committed, as the seducer of a maiden of royal blood.\r\n\r\nBy this iniquitous sentence, a color was given for treating the\r\nunfortunate lady and those who had been in her confidence with every\r\nspecies of harshness and indignity, and the following extract from a\r\nwarrant addressed in the name of her majesty to Mr. Warner, lieutenant\r\nof the Tower, sufficiently indicates the cruel advantage taken of her\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n...\"Our pleasure is, that ye shall, as by our commandment, examine the\r\nlady Catherine very straightly, how many hath been privy to the love\r\nbetween her and the earl of Hertford from the beginning; and let her\r\ncertainly understand that she shall have no manner of favor except she\r\nwill show the truth, not only what ladies or gentlewomen of this court\r\nwere thereto privy, but also what lords and gentlemen: For it doth now\r\nappear that sundry personages have dealt herein, and when it shall\r\nappear more manifestly, it shall increase our indignation against her,\r\nif she will forbear to utter it.\r\n\r\n\"We earnestly require you to use your diligence in this. Ye shall also\r\nsend to alderman Lodge secretly for St. Low, and shall put her in awe of\r\ndivers matters confessed by the lady Catherine; and so also deal with\r\nher that she may confess to you all her knowledge in the same matters.\r\nIt is certain that there hath been great practices and purposes; and\r\nsince the death of the lady Jane she hath been most privy. And as ye\r\nshall see occasion so ye may keep St. Low two or three nights more or\r\nless, and let her be returned to Lodge's or kept still with you as ye\r\nshall think meet[49].\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Note 49: \"Burleigh Papers\" by Haynes.]\r\n\r\nThe child of which the countess of Hertford was delivered soon after her\r\ncommittal, was regarded as illegitimate, and she was doomed to expiate\r\nher pretended misconduct by a further imprisonment at the arbitrary\r\npleasure of the queen. The birth of a second child, the fruit of stolen\r\nmeetings between the captive pair, aggravated in the jealous eyes of\r\nElizabeth their common guilt. Warner lost his place for permitting or\r\nconniving at their interviews, and Hertford was sentenced in the\r\nStar-chamber to a fine of fifteen thousand pounds for the double offence\r\nof vitiating a female of the royal blood, and of breaking his prison to\r\nrenew his offence.\r\n\r\nIt might somewhat console this persecuted pair under all their\r\nsufferings, to learn how unanimously the public voice was in their\r\nfavor. No one doubted that they were lawfully married,--a fact which was\r\nafterwards fully established,--and it was asked, by what right, or on\r\nwhat principle, her majesty presumed to keep asunder those whom God had\r\njoined? Words ran so high on this subject after the sentence of the\r\nStar-chamber, that some alarmists in the privy-council urged the\r\nnecessity of inflicting still severer punishment on the earl, and of\r\nintimidating the talkers by strong measures. The further consequences of\r\nthis affair to persons high in her majesty's confidence will be related\r\nhereafter: meantime it must be recorded, to the eternal disgrace of\r\nElizabeth's character and government, that she barbarously and illegally\r\ndetained her ill-fated kinswoman, first in the Tower and afterwards in\r\nprivate custody, till the day of her death in January 1567; and that the\r\nearl her husband, having added to the original offence of marrying a\r\nprincess, the further presumption of placing upon legal record the\r\nproofs of his children's legitimacy, was punished, besides his fine,\r\nwith an imprisonment of nine whole years. So much of the jealous spirit\r\nof her grandfather still survived in the bosom of this last of the\r\nTudors!\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, however, she exercised towards a family whose\r\npretensions had been viewed by her father with peculiar dread and\r\nhostility, a degree of forbearance which had in it somewhat of\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nArthur and Edmund Pole, two nephews of the cardinal, with sir Anthony\r\nFortescue their sister's husband, and other accomplices, had been led,\r\neither by private ambition, by a vehement zeal for the Romish faith, or\r\nboth together, to meditate the subversion of the existing state of\r\nthings, and to plan the following wild and desperate scheme.\r\n\r\nHaving first repaired to France, where they expected to receive aid and\r\ncounsels from the Guises, the conspirators were to return at the head of\r\nan army and make a landing in Wales. Here Arthur Pole, assuming at the\r\nsame time the title of duke of Clarence, was to proclaim the queen of\r\nScots, and the new sovereign was soon after to give her hand to his\r\nbrother Edmund. This absurd plot was detected before any steps were\r\ntaken towards its execution: the Poles were apprehended, and made a full\r\ndisclosure on their trial of all its circumstances; pleading however in\r\nexcuse, that they had no thought of putting their design in practice\r\ntill the death of the queen, an event which certain diviners in whom\r\nthey placed reliance had confidently predicted within the year.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this confession, and probably of the insignificance\r\nof the offenders, the royal pardon was extended to their lives, and the\r\nillustrious name of Pole was thus preserved from extinction. It is\r\nprobable, however, that they were kept for some time prisoners in the\r\nTower; and thither was also sent the countess of Lenox, on discovery of\r\nthe secret correspondence which she carried on with the queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nThe confession of the Poles seems to have given occasion to the renewal,\r\nby the parliament of 1562, of a law against \"fond and fantastical\r\nprophecies,\" promulgated with design to disturb the queen's government;\r\nby which act also it was especially forbidden to make prognostications\r\non or by occasion of any coats of arms, crests, or badges; a clause\r\nadded, it is believed, for the particular protection of the favorite,\r\nDudley, whose _bear and ragged staff_ was the continual subject of open\r\nderision or emblematical satire.\r\n\r\nA legend in the \"Mirror for Magistrates,\" relating the unhappy\r\ncatastrophe of George duke of Clarence, occasioned by a prophecy against\r\none whose name began with a G, appears to have been composed in aid of\r\nthe operation of this law. The author takes great pains to impress his\r\nreaders with the futility as well as wickedness of such predictions, and\r\nconcludes with the remark, that no one ought to imagine the foolish and\r\nmalicious inventors of modern prophecies inspired, though\r\n\r\n    ...\"learned _Merlin_ whom God gave the sprite\r\n    To know and utter princes' acts to come,\r\n    Like to the Jewish prophets did recite\r\n    In shade of beasts their doings all and some;\r\n    Expressing plain by manners of the doom\r\n    That kings and lords such properties should have\r\n    As have the beasts whose name he to them gave!\"\r\n\r\nIn France every thing now wore the aspect of an approaching civil war\r\nbetween the partisans of the two religions, under the conduct on one\r\nside of the Guises, on the other of the princes of the house of Conde.\r\nElizabeth judged it her duty, or her policy, to make a last effort for\r\nthe reconciliation of these angry factions, and she dispatched an\r\nambassador to Charles IX. charged with her earnest representations on\r\nthe subject. They were however ineffectual, and produced apparently no\r\nother valuable result than that of rendering her majesty better\r\nacquainted with the talents and merit of the eminent person whom she had\r\nhonored with this delicate commission.\r\n\r\nThis person was sir Henry Sidney, one of the most upright as well as\r\nable of the ministers of Elizabeth:--that he was the father of sir\r\nPhilip Sidney was the least of his praises; and it may be cited as one\r\nof the caprices of fame, that he should be remembered by his son, rather\r\nthan his son by him. Those qualities which in sir Philip could afford\r\nlittle but the promise of active virtue, were brought in sir Henry to\r\nthe test of actual performance; and lasting monuments of his wisdom and\r\nhis goodness remain in the institutions by which he softened the\r\nbarbarism of Wales, and appeased the more dangerous turbulence of\r\nIreland by promoting its civilization.\r\n\r\nSir Henry was the son of sir William Sidney, a gentleman of good\r\nparentage in Kent, whose mother was of the family of Brandon and nearly\r\nrelated to the duke of Suffolk of that name, the favorite and\r\nbrother-in-law of Henry VIII. Sir William in his youth had made one of a\r\nband of gentlemen of figure, who, with their sovereign's approbation,\r\ntravelled into Spain and other countries of Europe to study the manners\r\nand customs of their respective courts. He likewise distinguished\r\nhimself in the field of Flodden. The king stood godfather to his son\r\nHenry, born in 1529, and caused him to be educated with the prince of\r\nWales, to whom sir William was appointed tutor, chamberlain, and\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\nThe excellent qualities and agreeable talents of young Sidney soon\r\nendeared him to Edward, who made him his inseparable companion and often\r\nhis bed-fellow; kept him in close attendance on his person during his\r\nlong decline, and sealed his friendship by breathing his last in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nDuring the short reign of this lamented prince Sidney had received the\r\nhonor of knighthood, and had been intrusted, at the early age of one or\r\ntwo and twenty, with an embassy to the French king, in which he\r\nacquitted himself so ably that he was soon afterwards sent in a\r\ndiplomatic character to Scotland. He had likewise formed connexions\r\nwhich exerted important influence on his after fortunes. Sir John Cheke\r\nheld him in particular esteem, and through his means he had contracted a\r\ncordial friendship with Cecil, of which in various ways he found the\r\nbenefit to the end of his life. A daughter of the all-powerful duke of\r\nNorthumberland had also honored him with her hand,--a dangerous gift,\r\nwhich was likely to have involved him in the ruin which the guilty\r\nprojects of that audacious man drew down upon the heads of himself and\r\nhis family. But the prudence or loyalty of Sidney preserved him from\r\nthe snare. No sooner had his royal master breathed his last, than,\r\nrelinquishing all concern in public affairs, he withdrew to the safe\r\nretirement of his own seat at Penshurst, where he afterwards afforded a\r\ngenerous asylum to such of the Dudleys as had escaped death or\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary seems to have held out an earnest of future favor to Sidney,\r\nby naming him amongst the noblemen and knights appointed to attend\r\nPhilip of Spain to England for the completion of his nuptials; and this\r\nprince further honored him by becoming sponsor to his afterwards\r\ncelebrated son and giving him his own name. But Sidney soon quitted a\r\ncourt in which a man of protestant principles could no longer reside\r\nwith satisfaction, if with safety, and accompanied to Ireland his\r\nbrother-in-law viscount Fitzwalter, then lord-deputy. In that kingdom he\r\nat first bore the office of vice-treasurer, and afterwards, during the\r\nfrequent absences of the lord-deputy, the high one of sole lord-justice.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Elizabeth enabled lord Robert Dudley to make a large\r\nreturn for the former kindness of his brother-in-law; and supported by\r\nthe influence of this distinguished favorite, in addition to his\r\npersonal claims, sir Henry Sidney rose in a few years to the dignities\r\nof privy-councillor and knight of the garter. After his embassy to\r\nFrance he was appointed to the post of lord-president of Wales, to\r\nwhich, in 1565, the still more important one of lord-deputy of Ireland\r\nwas added;--an union of two not very compatible offices, unexampled in\r\nour annals before or since. Some particulars of sir Henry Sidney's\r\ngovernment of Ireland may come under review hereafter: it is sufficient\r\nhere to observe, that ample testimony to his merit was furnished by\r\nElizabeth herself, in the steadiness with which she persisted in\r\nappointing and re-appointing him to this most perplexing department of\r\npublic service, in spite of all the cabals, of English or Irish growth,\r\nby which, though his favor with her was sometimes shaken, her rooted\r\nopinion of his probity and sufficiency could never be overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Elizabeth's negotiations with the French court was\r\nfollowed by her taking up arms in support of the oppressed Hugonots; and\r\nAmbrose Dudley earl of Warwick, the elder brother of lord Robert, was\r\nsent to Normandy at the head of three thousand men. Of the two Dudleys\r\nit was said by their contemporaries, that the elder inherited the money,\r\nand the younger the wit, of his father. If this remark were well\r\nfounded, which seems doubtful, the appointment of Warwick to an\r\nimportant command must probably be set down to the account of\r\nfavoritism. It was not however the wish of the queen that her troops\r\nshould often be led into battle. It was her main object to obtain\r\nlasting possession of the town of Havre, as an indemnification for the\r\nloss of Calais, so much deplored by the nation; and into this place\r\nWarwick threw himself with his chief force. In the next campaign, when\r\nit was assailed with the whole power of France, he prepared, according\r\nto the orders of Elizabeth, for a desperate defence, and no blame was\r\never imputed to him for a surrender, which became unavoidable through\r\nthe ravages of the plague, and the delay of reinforcements by contrary\r\nwinds[50]. Warwick appears to have preserved through life the character\r\nof a man of honor and a brave soldier.\r\n\r\n[Note 50: It was by no remissness on the part of the queen that this\r\ntown was lost; the preservation of which was an object very near her\r\nheart, as appears from a letter of encouragement addressed by the\r\nprivy-council to Warwick, which has the following postscript in her own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Warwick; If your honor and my desire could accord with the loss\r\nof the needfullest finger I keep, God so help me in my utmost need as I\r\nwould gladly lose that one joint for your safe abode with me; but since\r\nI cannot that I would, I will do that I may, and will rather drink in an\r\nashen cup than you or yours should not be succoured both by sea and\r\nland, yea, and that with all speed possible, and let this my scribbling\r\nhand witness it to them all.\r\n\r\n\"Yours as my own,\r\n\r\n\"E.R.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Archaeologia,\" vol. xiii. p. 201.]\r\n\r\nA project which had been for some time under discussion, of a personal\r\ninterview at York between the English and Scottish queens, was now\r\nfinally given up. Elizabeth, it is surmised, was unwilling to afford her\r\nbeautiful and captivating enemy such an opportunity of winning upon the\r\naffections of the English people, and Mary was fearful of offending her\r\nuncles the princes of Guise by so public an advance towards a good\r\nunderstanding with a princess now engaged in open hostilities against\r\ntheir country and faction. The failure of this design deserves not to be\r\nregretted. The meetings of princes have never, under any circumstances,\r\nbeen known to produce a valuable political result; and an interview\r\nbetween these jealous and exasperated rivals could only have exhibited\r\ndisgusting scenes of forced civility and exaggerated profession, thinly\r\nveiling the inveterate animosity which neither party could hope\r\neffectually to hide from the intuitive perception of the other.\r\n\r\nA terrible plague, introduced by the return of the sickly garrison of\r\nHavre, raged in London during the year 1563, and for some time carried\r\noff about a thousand persons weekly. The sittings of parliament were\r\nheld on this account at Hertford Castle; and the queen, retiring to\r\nWindsor, kept herself in unusual privacy, and took advantage of the\r\nopportunity to pursue her literary occupations with more than common\r\nassiduity. Without entirely deserting her favorite Greek classics, she\r\nat this time applied herself principally to the study of the Christian\r\nfathers, with the laudable purpose, doubtless, of making herself\r\nmistress of those questions respecting the doctrine and discipline of\r\nthe primitive church now so fiercely agitated between the divines of\r\ndifferent communions, and on which, as head of the English church, she\r\nwas often called upon to decide in the last resort.\r\n\r\nCecil had mentioned these pursuits of her majesty in a letter to Cox\r\nbishop of Ely, and certainly as matter of high commendation; but the\r\nbishop answered, perhaps with better judgement, that after all,\r\nScripture was \"that which pierced;\" that of the fathers, one was\r\ninclined to Pelagianism, another to Monachism, and he hoped that her\r\nmajesty only occupied herself with them at idle hours.\r\n\r\nEven studies so solemn could not however preserve the royal theologian,\r\nnow in her thirtieth year, from serious disturbance on account of\r\ncertain ill-favored likenesses of her gracious countenance which had\r\nobtained a general circulation among her loving subjects. So provoking\r\nan abuse was thought to justify and require the special exertion of the\r\nroyal prerogative for its correction, and Cecil was directed to draw up\r\nan energetic proclamation on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis curious document sets forth, that \"forasmuch as through the natural\r\ndesire that all sorts of subjects had to procure the portrait and\r\nlikeness of the queen's majesty, great numbers of painters, and some\r\nprinters and gravers, had and did daily attempt in divers manners to\r\nmake portraitures of her, wherein none hitherto had sufficiently\r\nexpressed the natural representation of her majesty's person, favor, or\r\ngrace; but had for the most part erred therein, whereof daily complaints\r\nwere made amongst her loving subjects,--that for the redress hereof her\r\nmajesty had been so importunately sued unto by the lords of her council\r\nand other of her nobility, not only to be content that some special\r\ncunning painter might be permitted by access to her majesty to take the\r\nnatural representation of her, whereof she had been always of her own\r\nright disposition very unwilling, but also to prohibit all manner of\r\nother persons to draw, paint, grave, or portrait her personage or visage\r\nfor a time, until there were some perfect pattern or example to be\r\nfollowed:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore her majesty, being herein as it were overcome with the\r\ncontinual requests of so many of her nobility and lords, whom she could\r\nnot well deny, was pleased that some cunning person should shortly make\r\na portrait of her person or visage to be participated to others for the\r\ncomfort of her loving subjects; and furthermore commanded, that till\r\nthis should be finished, all other persons should abstain from making\r\nany representations of her; that afterwards her majesty would be content\r\nthat all other painters, printers, or gravers, that should be known men\r\nof understanding, and so therein licensed by the head officers of the\r\nplaces where they should dwell (as reason it was that every person\r\nshould not without consideration attempt the same), might at their\r\npleasure follow the said pattern or first portraiture. And for that her\r\nmajesty perceived a great number of her loving subjects to be much\r\ngrieved with the errors and deformities herein committed, she straitly\r\ncharged her officers and ministers to see to the observation of this\r\nproclamation, and in the meantime to forbid the showing or publication\r\nof such as were apparently deformed, until they should be reformed which\r\nwere reformable[51].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 51: \"Archaeologia,\" vol. ii. p. 169.]\r\n\r\nOn the subject of marriage, so perpetually moved to her both by her\r\nparliament and by foreign princes, Elizabeth still preserved a cautious\r\nambiguity of language, well exemplified in the following passage: \"The\r\nduke of Wirtemburg, a German protestant prince, had lately friendly\r\noffered his service to the queen, in case she were minded to marry. To\r\nwhich, January 27th she gave him this courteous and princely answer:\r\n'That although she never yet were weary of single and maiden life, yet\r\nindeed she was the last issue of her father left, and the only of her\r\nhouse; the care of her kingdom and the love of posterity did counsel her\r\nto alter this course of life. But in consideration of the leave that her\r\nsubjects had given her in ampler manner to make her choice than they did\r\nto any prince afore, she was even in courtesy bound to make that choice\r\nso as should be for the best of her state and subjects. And for that he\r\noffered therein his assistance, she graciously acknowledged the same,\r\npromising to deserve it hereafter[52].'\"\r\n\r\n[Note 52: Strype's \"Annals,\" vol. i. p. 398.]\r\n\r\nIt might be curious to inquire of what nature the _assistance_ politely\r\nproffered by the duke in this matter, and thus favorably received by her\r\nmajesty, could be; it does not appear that he tendered his own hand to\r\nher acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe French court became solicitous about this time to draw closer its\r\nbond of amity with the queen of Scots, who, partly on account of some\r\nwrong which had been done her respecting the payment of her dower,\r\npartly in consequence of various affronts put upon her subjects, had\r\nbegun to estrange herself from her old connexions, and to seek in\r\npreference the alliance of Elizabeth. French agents were now sent over\r\nto Scotland to urge upon her the claims of former friendship, and to\r\ntempt her by brilliant promises to listen to proposals of marriage from\r\nthe duke of Anjou, preferably to those made her by the archduke Charles\r\nor by don Carlos.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of these negotiations awakened all the jealousies,\r\npolitical and personal, of Elizabeth. She ordered her agent Randolph, a\r\npractised intriguer, to devise means for crossing the matrimonial\r\nproject. Meantime, by way of intimidation, she appointed the earl of\r\nBedford to the lieutenancy of the four northern counties, and the\r\npowerful earl of Shrewsbury to that of several adjoining ones, and\r\nordered a considerable levy of troops in these parts for the\r\nreinforcement of the garrison of Berwick and the protection of the\r\nEnglish border, on which she affected to dread an attack by an united\r\nFrench and Scottish force.\r\n\r\nRandolph soon after received instructions to express openly to Mary his\r\nsovereign's dislike of her matching either with the archduke or with any\r\nother foreign prince, and her wish that she would choose a husband\r\nwithin the island; and he was next empowered to add, that if the\r\nScottish queen would gratify his mistress in this point, she need not\r\ndoubt of obtaining a public recognition of her right of succession to\r\nthe English crown. Elizabeth afterwards came nearer to the point; she\r\ndesignated lord Robert Dudley as the individual on whom she desired that\r\nthe choice of her royal kinswoman should fall. By a queen-dowager of\r\nFrance, and a queen-regnant of Scotland, the proposal of so inferior an\r\nalliance might almost be regarded as an insult, and Mary was naturally\r\nhaughty; but her hopes and fears compelled her to dissemble her\r\nindignation, and even to affect to take the matter into consideration.\r\nShe trusted that pretexts might be found hereafter for evading the\r\ncompletion of the marriage, even if the queen of England were sincere in\r\ndesiring such an advancement for her favorite, which was much doubted,\r\nand she determined for the present to show herself docile to all the\r\nsuggestions of her royal sister, and to preserve the good understanding\r\non her part unbroken.\r\n\r\nIt was during the continuance of this state of apparent amity between\r\nthe rival queens, that Elizabeth thought proper to visit with tokens of\r\nher displeasure the leaders in an attempt to establish the title of the\r\nSuffolk line, which still found adherents of some importance.\r\n\r\nJohn Hales, clerk of the hanaper, a learned and able man, and, like all\r\nwho espoused this party, a zealous protestant, had written, and secretly\r\ncirculated, a book in defence of the claims of the lady Catherine, and\r\nhe had also procured opinions of foreign lawyers in favor of the\r\nvalidity of her marriage. For one or both of these offences he was\r\ncommitted to the Fleet prison, and the secretary was soon after\r\ncommanded to examine thoroughly into the business, and learn to whom\r\nHales had communicated his work. A more disagreeable task could scarcely\r\nhave been imposed upon Cecil; for, besides that he must probably have\r\nbeen aware that his friend and brother-in-law sir Nicholas Bacon was\r\nimplicated, it seems that he himself was not entirely free from\r\nsuspicion of some participation in the affair. But he readily\r\nacknowledged his duty to the queen to be a paramount obligation to all\r\nothers, and he wrote to a friend that he was determined to proceed with\r\nperfect impartiality.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Hales was liberated after half a year's imprisonment.\r\nBacon, the lord keeper, who appeared to have seen the book, and either\r\nto have approved it, or at least to have taken no measures for its\r\nsuppression or the punishment of its author, was not removed from his\r\noffice; but he was ordered to confine himself strictly to its duties,\r\nand to abstain henceforth from taking any part in political business.\r\nBut by this prohibition Cecil affirmed that public business suffered\r\nessentially, for Bacon had previously discharged with distinguished\r\nability the functions of a minister of state; and he never desisted from\r\nintercession with her majesty till he saw his friend fully reinstated in\r\nher favor. Lord John Grey of Pyrgo, uncle to lady Catherine, had been a\r\nprincipal agent in this business, and after several examinations by\r\nmembers of the privy-council, he was committed to a kind of honorable\r\ncustody, in which he appears to have remained till his death, which took\r\nplace a few months afterwards. These punishments were slight compared\r\nwith the customary severity of the age; and it has plausibly been\r\nconjectured that the anger of Elizabeth on this occasion was rather\r\nfeigned than real, and that although she thought proper openly to resent\r\nany attempt injurious to the title of the queen of Scots, she was\r\nsecretly not displeased to let this princess perceive that she must\r\nstill depend on her friendship for its authentic and unanimous\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nHer anger against the earl of Hertford for the steps taken by him in\r\nconfirmation of his marriage was certainly sincere, however unjust. She\r\nwas provoked, perhaps alarmed, to find that he had been advised to\r\nappeal against the decision of her commissioners: on better\r\nconsideration, however, he refrained from making this experiment; but by\r\na process in the ecclesiastical courts, with which the queen could not\r\nor would not interfere, he finally succeeded in establishing the\r\nlegitimacy of his sons.\r\n\r\nOf the progresses of her majesty, during several years, nothing\r\nremarkable appears on record; they seem to have had no other object than\r\nthe gratification of her love of popular applause, and her taste for\r\nmagnificent entertainments which cost her nothing; and the trivial\r\ndetails of her reception at the different towns or mansions which she\r\nhonored with her presence, are equally barren of amusement and\r\ninstruction. But her visit to the university of Cambridge in the summer\r\nof 1564 presents too many characteristic traits to be passed over in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHer gracious intention of honoring this seat of learning with her royal\r\npresence was no sooner disclosed to the secretary, who was chancellor of\r\nthe university, than it was notified by him to the vice-chancellor, with\r\na request that proper persons might be sent to receive his instructions\r\non the subject. It appears to have been part of these instructions, that\r\nthe university should prepare an extremely respectful letter to lord\r\nRobert Dudley, who was its high-steward, entreating him in such manner\r\nto commend to her majesty their good intentions, and to excuse any\r\ntheir failure in the performance, that she might be inclined to receive\r\nin good part all their efforts for her entertainment. So notorious was\r\nat this time the pre-eminent favor of this courtier with his sovereign,\r\nand so humble was the style of address to him required from a body so\r\nvenerable and so illustrious!\r\n\r\nCecil arrived at Cambridge the day before the queen to set all things in\r\norder, and received from the university a customary offering of two\r\npairs of gloves, two sugarloaves, and a marchpane. Lord Robert and the\r\nduke of Norfolk were complimented with the same gift, and finer gloves\r\nand more elaborate confectionary were presented to the queen herself.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the door of King's college chapel, the chancellor\r\nkneeled down and bade her welcome; and the orator, kneeling on the\r\nchurch steps, made her an harangue of nearly half an hour. \"First he\r\npraised and commended many and singular virtues planted and set in her\r\nmajesty, which her highness not acknowledging of shaked her head, bit\r\nher lips and her fingers, and sometimes broke forth into passion and\r\nthese words; 'Non est veritas, et utinam'--On his praising virginity,\r\nshe said to the orator, 'God's blessing of thy heart, there continue.'\r\nAfter that he showed what joy the university had of her presence\" &c.\r\n\"When he had done she commended him, and much marvelled that his memory\r\ndid so well serve him, repeating such diverse and sundry matters; saying\r\nthat she would answer him again in Latin, but for fear she should speak\r\nfalse Latin, and then they would laugh at her.\"\r\n\r\nThis concluded, she entered the chapel in great state; lady Strange, a\r\nprincess of the Suffolk line, bearing her train, and her ladies\r\nfollowing in their degrees. _Te Deum_ was sung and the evening service\r\nperformed, with all the pomp that protestant worship admits, in that\r\nmagnificent temple, of which she highly extolled the beauty. The next\r\nmorning, which was Sunday, she went thither again to hear a Latin sermon\r\n_ad clerum_, and in the evening, the body of this solemn edifice being\r\nconverted into a temporary theatre, she was there gratified with a\r\nrepresentation of the Aulularia of Plautus. Offensive as such an\r\napplication of a sacred building would be to modern feelings, it\r\nprobably shocked no one in an age when the practice of performing\r\ndramatic entertainments in churches, introduced with the mysteries and\r\nmoralities of the middle ages, was scarcely obsolete, and certainly not\r\nforgotten. Neither was the representation of plays on Sundays at this\r\ntime regarded as an indecorum.\r\n\r\nA public disputation in the morning and a Latin play on the story of\r\nDido in the evening formed the entertainment of her majesty on the third\r\nday. On the fourth, an English play called Ezechias was performed before\r\nher. The next morning she visited the different colleges,--at each of\r\nwhich a Latin oration awaited her and a parting present of gloves and\r\nconfectionary, besides a volume richly bound, containing the verses in\r\nEnglish, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldee, composed by the members of\r\neach learned society in honor of her visit.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she repaired to St. Mary's church, where a very long and very\r\nlearned disputation by doctors in divinity was prepared for her\r\namusement and edification. When it was ended, \"the lords, and especially\r\nthe duke of Norfolk and lord Robert Dudley, kneeling down, humbly\r\ndesired her majesty to speak something to the university, and in Latin.\r\nHer highness at the first refused, saying, that if she might speak her\r\nmind in English, she would not stick at the matter. But understanding by\r\nMr. Secretary that nothing might be said openly to the university in\r\nEnglish, she required him the rather to speak; because he was\r\nchancellor, and the chancellor is the queen's mouth. Whereunto he\r\nanswered, that he was chancellor of the university, and not hers. Then\r\nthe bishop of Ely kneeling said, that three words of her mouth were\r\nenough.\" By entreaties so urgent, she appeared to suffer herself to be\r\nprevailed upon to deliver a speech which had doubtless been prepared for\r\nthe occasion, and very probably by Cecil himself. This harangue is not\r\nworth transcribing at length: it contained some disqualifying phrases\r\nrespecting her own proficiency in learning, and a pretty profession of\r\nfeminine bashfulness in delivering an unstudied speech before so erudite\r\nan auditory:--her attachment to the cause of learning was then set\r\nforth, and a paragraph followed which may thus be translated: \"I saw\r\nthis morning your sumptuous edifices founded by illustrious princes my\r\npredecessors for the benefit of learning; but while I viewed them my\r\nmind was affected with sorrow, and I sighed like Alexander the Great,\r\nwhen having perused the records of the deeds of other princes, turning\r\nto his friends or counsellors, he lamented that any one should have\r\npreceded him either in time or in actions. When I beheld your edifices,\r\nI grieved that I had done nothing in this kind. Yet did the vulgar\r\nproverb somewhat lessen, though it could not entirely remove my\r\nconcern;--that 'Rome was not built in a day.' For my age is not yet so\r\nfar advanced, neither is it yet so long since I began to reign, but that\r\nbefore I pay my debt to nature,--unless Atropos should prematurely cut\r\nmy thread,--I may still be able to execute some distinguished\r\nundertaking: and never will I be diverted from the intention while life\r\nshall animate this frame. Should it however happen, as it may, I know\r\nnot how soon, that I should be overtaken by death before I have been\r\nable to perform this my promise, I will not fail to leave some great\r\nwork to be executed after my decease, by which my memory may be rendered\r\nfamous, others excited by my example, and all of you animated to greater\r\nardor in your studies.\"\r\n\r\nAfter such a speech, it might naturally be inquired, which college did\r\nshe endow? But, alas! the prevailing disposition of Elizabeth was the\r\nreverse of liberal; and her revenues, it may be added, were narrow.\r\nDuring the whole course of her long reign, not a single conspicuous act\r\nof public munificence sheds its splendor on her name, and the pledge\r\nthus solemnly and publicly given, was never redeemed by her, living or\r\ndying. An annuity of twenty pounds bestowed, with the title of _her\r\nscholar_, on a pretty young man of the name of Preston, whose graceful\r\nperformance in a public disputation and in the Latin play of Dido had\r\nparticularly caught her fancy, appears to have been the only solid\r\nbenefit bestowed by her majesty in return for all the cost and all the\r\nlearned incense lavished on her reception by this loyal and splendid\r\nuniversity[53].\r\n\r\n[Note 53: A seeming contradiction to the assertions in the text may\r\nbe discovered in the circumstance that Elizabeth is the nominal\r\nfoundress of Jesus College Oxford. But it was at the expense, as well as\r\nat the suggestion, of Dr. Price, a patriotic Welshman, that this\r\nseminary of learning, designed for the reception of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, was instituted. Her name, a charter of incorporation\r\ndated June 27th 1571, and some timber from her forests of Stow and\r\nShotover, were the only contributions of her majesty towards an object\r\nso laudable, and of which the inadequate funds of the real founder long\r\ndelayed the accomplishment.]\r\n\r\nSoon after her return from her progress, the queen determined to gratify\r\nher feelings by conferring on her beloved Dudley some signal testimonies\r\nof her royal regard; and she invested him with the dignities of baron of\r\nDenbigh and earl of Leicester, accompanying these honors with the\r\nsplendid gift of Kennelworth Castle, park and manor:--for in behalf of\r\nDudley, and afterwards of Essex, she could even forget for a time her\r\ndarling virtue,--frugality. The chronicles of the time describe with\r\nextraordinary care and minuteness the whole pompous ceremonial of this\r\ncreation; but a much more lively and interesting description of this\r\nscene, as well as of several others of which he was an eye-witness in\r\nthe court of Elizabeth, has been handed down to us in the entertaining\r\nmemoirs of sir James Melvil; a Scotch gentleman noted among the\r\npolitical agents, or diplomatists of second rank, whom that age of\r\nintrigue brought forth so abundantly.\r\n\r\nA few particulars of the history of this person, curious in themselves,\r\nwill also form a proper introduction to his narrative.\r\n\r\nMelvil was born in Fifeshire in the year 1530, of a family patronized by\r\nthe queen regent, Mary of Guise, who having taken into her own service\r\nhis brothers Robert and Andrew, both afterwards noted in public life,\r\ndetermined to send James to France to be brought up as page to the queen\r\nher daughter, then dauphiness. He was accordingly placed under the care\r\nof the crafty Monluc bishop of Valence, then on his return from his\r\nScotch embassy; and previously to his embarkation for the continent he\r\nhad the advantage of accompanying this master of intrigue on a secret\r\nmission to O'Neil, then the head of the Irish rebels. The youth was\r\napparently not much delighted with his visit to this barbarous\r\nchieftain, whose dwelling was \"a great dark tower, where,\" says he, \"we\r\nhad cold cheer, such as herrings and biscuit, for it was Lent.\" Arriving\r\nat Paris, the bishop caused him to be carefully instructed in all the\r\nrequisite accomplishments of a page,--the French tongue, dancing,\r\nfencing, and playing on the lute: and after nine years spent under his\r\nprotection, Melvil passed into the service of the constable Montmorenci,\r\nby whose interest he obtained a pension from the king of France. Whilst\r\nin this situation, he was dispatched on a secret mission to Scotland,\r\nto learn the real designs of the prior of St. Andrews, and to inform\r\nhimself of the state of parties in that country.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1560 he obtained permission from his own sovereign to\r\ntravel, and gained admission into the service of the elector palatine.\r\nThis prince employed him in an embassy of condolence on the death of\r\nFrancis II. Some time after his return he received a commission from the\r\nqueen of Scots to make himself personally acquainted with the archduke\r\nCharles, who was proposed to her for a husband.\r\n\r\nThis done, he made a tour in Italy, and then returned to the elector\r\npalatine at Heidelberg. He was next employed by Maximilian king of the\r\nRomans to carry to France the portrait of one of his daughters, to whom\r\nproposals of marriage had been made on the part of Charles IX. At this\r\ncourt Catherine dei Medici would gladly have detained him; but a summons\r\nfrom his own queen determined him to repair again to Scotland.\r\n\r\nDuke Casimir, son of the elector palatine, having some time before made\r\nan offer of his hand to queen Elizabeth, to which a dubious answer had\r\nbeen returned, requested Melvil, in passing through England, to convey\r\nhis picture to that princess. The envoy, secretly despairing of the\r\nsuit, desired that he might also be furnished with portraits of the\r\nother members of the electoral family, and with some nominal commission\r\nby means of which he might gain more easy access to the queen, and\r\nproduce the picture as if without design. He was accordingly instructed\r\nto press for a more explicit answer than had yet been given to the\r\nproposal of an alliance offensive and defensive between England and the\r\nprotestant princes of Germany; and thus prepared he reached London early\r\nin the year 1564.\r\n\r\nAfter some discourse with the queen on the ostensible object of his\r\nmission, Melvil found occasion to break forth into earnest commendations\r\nof the elector, whose service nothing, he said, but this duty to his own\r\nsovereign could have induced him to quit; and he added, that for the\r\nremembrance of so good a master, he had desired to carry home with him\r\nhis portrait, as well as those of all his sons and daughters. \"So soon\r\nas she heard me mention the pictures,\" continues he, \"she enquired if I\r\nhad the picture of duke Casimir, desiring to see it. And when I alleged\r\nthat I had left the pictures in London, she being then at Hampton Court,\r\nand that I was ready to go forward on my journey, she said I should not\r\npart till she had seen the pictures. So the next day I delivered them\r\nall to her majesty, and she desired to keep them all night; and she\r\ncalled upon my lord Robert Dudley to be judge of duke Casimir's picture,\r\nand appointed me to meet her the next morning in her garden, where she\r\ncaused to deliver them all unto me, giving me thanks for the sight of\r\nthem. I then offered unto her majesty all the pictures, so she would\r\npermit me to retain the elector's and his lady's, but she would have\r\nnone of them. I had also sure information that first and last she\r\ndespised the said duke Casimir.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a little before this time that Elizabeth had been consulted by\r\nMary on the proposal of the archduke, and had declared by Randolph her\r\nstrong disapprobation of it.\r\n\r\nShe now told Melvil, with whom she conversed on this and other subjects\r\nvery familiarly and with apparent openness, that she intended soon to\r\nmention as fit matches for his queen two noblemen, one or other of whom\r\nshe hoped to see her accept. These two, according to Melvil, were Dudley\r\nand lord Darnley, eldest son of the earl of Lenox by the lady Margaret\r\nDouglas. It must however be remarked, that Melvil appears to be the only\r\nwriter who asserts that the first suggestion of an union between Mary\r\nand Darnley came from the English queen, who afterwards so vehemently\r\nopposed this step. But be this as it may, it is probable that Elizabeth\r\nwas more sincere in her desire to impede the Austrian match than to\r\npromote any other for the queen of Scots; and with the former view\r\nMelvil accuses her of throwing out hints by which the archduke was\r\nencouraged to renew his suit to herself. Provoked, as he asserts, by\r\nthis duplicity, of which she soon received certain information, Mary\r\nreturned a sharp answer to a letter from her kinswoman of seemingly\r\nfriendly advice, and hence had ensued a coldness and a cessation of\r\nintercourse between them. But Mary, \"fearing that if their discord\r\ncontinued it would cut off all correspondence between her and her\r\nfriends in England,\" thought good, a few weeks after Melvil had returned\r\nto Scotland, to dispatch him again towards London, \"to deal with the\r\nqueen of England, with the Spanish ambassador, and with my lady\r\nMargaret Douglas, and with sundry friends she had in England of\r\ndifferent opinions.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the interest of neither sovereign at this time to be on bad terms\r\nwith the other; and their respective ministers and secretaries being\r\nalso agreed among themselves to maintain harmony between the countries,\r\nthe excuses and explanations of Melvil were allowed to pass current, and\r\nthe demonstrations of amity were resumed between the hostile queens.\r\n\r\nSome particulars of the reception of this envoy at the English court are\r\ncurious, and may probably be relied on. \"Being arrived at London I\r\nlodged near the court, which was at Westminster. My host immediately\r\ngave advertisement of my coming, and that same night her majesty sent\r\nMr. Hatton, afterwards governor of the isle of Wight, to welcome me, and\r\nto show me that the next morning she would give me audience in her\r\ngarden at eight of the clock.\" \"The next morning Mr. Hatton and Mr.\r\nRandolph, late agent for the queen of England in Scotland, came to my\r\nlodging to convey me to her majesty, who was, as they said, already in\r\nthe garden. With them came a servant of my lord Robert's with a horse\r\nand foot-mantle of velvet, laced with gold, for me to ride upon. Which\r\nservant, with the said horse, waited upon me all the time that I\r\nremained there.\"\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent interview, \"the old friendship being renewed, Elizabeth\r\ninquired if the queen had sent any answer to the proposition of marriage\r\nmade to her by Mr. Randolph. I answered, as I had been instructed, that\r\nmy mistress thought little or nothing thereof, but attended the meeting\r\nof some commissioners upon the borders... to confer and treat upon all\r\nsuch matters of greatest importance, as should be judged to concern the\r\nquiet of both countries, and the satisfaction of both their majesties'\r\nminds.\" Adding, \"the queen my mistress is minded, as I have said, to\r\nsend for her part my lord of Murray, and the secretary Lidingtoun, and\r\nexpects your majesty will send my lord of Bedford and my lord Robert\r\nDudley.\" She answered, \"it appeared I made but small account of my lord\r\nRobert, seeing I named the earl of Bedford before him, but that erelong\r\nshe would make him a far greater earl, and that I should see it done\r\nbefore my returning home. For she esteemed him as her brother and best\r\nfriend, whom she would have herself married had she ever minded to have\r\ntaken a husband. But being determined to end her life in virginity, she\r\nwished the queen her sister might marry him, as meetest of all other\r\nwith whom she could find in her heart to declare her second person. For\r\nbeing matched with him, it would remove out of her mind all fears and\r\nsuspicions, to be offended by any usurpation before her death. Being\r\nassured that he was so loving and trusty that he would never suffer any\r\nsuch thing to be attempted during her time. And that the queen my\r\nmistress might have the higher esteem of him, I was required to stay\r\ntill I should see him made earl of Leicester and baron of Denbigh; which\r\nwas done at Westminster with great solemnity, the queen herself helping\r\nto put on his ceremonial (mantle), he sitting upon his knees before her\r\nwith a great gravity. But she could not refrain from putting her hand\r\nin his neck, smilingly tickling him, the French ambassador and I\r\nstanding by. Then she turned, asking at me how I liked him? I answered,\r\nthat as he was a worthy servant, so he was happy, who had a princess who\r\ncould discern and reward good service. Yet, says she, you like better of\r\nyonder long lad, pointing towards my lord Darnley, who, as nearest\r\nprince of the blood, did bear the sword of honor that day before her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She appeared to be so affectionate to the queen her good sister, that\r\nshe expressed a great desire to see her. And because their so much by\r\nher desired meeting could not so hastily be brought to pass, she\r\nappeared with great delight to look upon her majesty's picture. She took\r\nme to her bed-chamber, and opened a little cabinet, wherein were divers\r\nlittle pictures wrapped within paper, and their names written with her\r\nown hand upon the papers. Upon the first that she took up was written\r\n'My lord's picture.' I held the candle, and pressed to see that picture\r\nso named; she appeared loath to let me see it, yet my importunity\r\nprevailed for a sight thereof, and I found it to be the earl of\r\nLeicester's picture. I desired that I might have it to carry home to my\r\nqueen, which she refused, alleging that she had but that one picture of\r\nhis. I said, 'Your majesty hath here the original, for I perceived him\r\nat the furthest part of the chamber, speaking with secretary Cecil.'\r\nThen she took out the queen's picture, and kissed it, and I adventured\r\nto kiss her hand, for the great love evidenced therein to my mistress.\r\nShe showed me also a fair ruby, as great as a tennis-ball; I desired\r\nthat she would send either it, or my lord of Leicester's picture, as a\r\ntoken to my queen. She said, that if the queen would follow her counsel,\r\nshe would in process of time get all that she had; that in the meantime\r\nshe was resolved in a token to send her with me a fair diamond. It was\r\nat this time late after supper; she appointed me to be with her the next\r\nmorning by eight of the clock, at which time she used to walk in her\r\ngarden.\"\r\n\r\n\"She enquired of me many things relating to this kingdom (Scotland) and\r\nother countries wherein I had travelled. She caused me to dine with her\r\ndame of honor, my lady Strafford (an honorable and godly lady, who had\r\nbeen at Geneva banished during the reign of queen Mary), that I might be\r\nalways near her, that she might confer with me.\"\r\n\r\n...\"At divers meetings we had divers purposes. The queen my mistress had\r\ninstructed me to leave matters of gravity sometimes, and cast in merry\r\npurposes, lest otherwise she should be wearied; she being well informed\r\nof that queen's natural temper. Therefore in declaring my observations\r\nof the customs of Dutchland, Poland, and Italy; the buskins of the women\r\nwas not forgot, and what country weed I thought best becoming\r\ngentlewomen. The queen said she had clothes of every sort, which every\r\nday thereafter, so long as I was there, she changed. One day she had the\r\nEnglish weed, another the French, and another the Italian, and so forth.\r\nShe asked me, which of them became her best? I answered, in my\r\njudgement the Italian dress; which answer I found pleased her well, for\r\nshe delighted to show her golden coloured hair, wearing a caul and\r\nbonnet as they do in Italy. Her hair was rather reddish than yellow,\r\ncurled in appearance naturally.\r\n\r\n\"She desired to know of me what colour of hair was reputed best, and\r\nwhether my queen's hair or hers was best, and which of them two was\r\nfairest? I answered, the fairness of them both was not their worst\r\nfaults. But she was earnest with me to declare which of them I judged\r\nfairest? I said, she was the fairest queen in England, and mine in\r\nScotland. Yet she appeared earnest. I answered, they were both the\r\nfairest ladies in their countries; that her majesty was whiter, but my\r\nqueen was very lovely. She enquired, which of them was of highest\r\nstature? I said, my queen. Then, saith she, she is too high, for I\r\nmyself am neither too high nor too low. Then she asked, what exercises\r\nshe used? I answered, that when I received my dispatch, the queen was\r\nlately come from the Highland hunting. That when her more serious\r\naffairs permitted, she was taken up with reading of histories: that\r\nsometimes she recreated herself in playing upon the lute and virginals.\r\nShe asked if she played well? I said reasonably, for a queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That same day after dinner, my lord of Hunsdon drew me up to a quiet\r\ngallery that I might hear some music, but he said he durst not avow it,\r\nwhere I might hear the queen play upon the virginals. After I had\r\nharkened awhile, I took by the tapestry that hung before the door of the\r\nchamber, and seeing her back was toward the door, I ventured within the\r\nchamber, and stood a pretty space hearing her play excellently well; but\r\nshe left off immediately, so soon as she turned about and saw me. She\r\nappeared to be surprised to see me, and came forward, seeming to strike\r\nme with her hand, alleging that she used not to play before men, but\r\nwhen she was solitary, to shun melancholy. She asked how I came there? I\r\nanswered, as I was walking with my lord of Hunsdon, as we passed by the\r\nchamber door, I heard such melody as ravished me, whereby I was drawn in\r\nere I knew how, excusing my fault of homeliness as being brought up in\r\nthe court of France, where such freedom was allowed; declaring myself\r\nwilling to endure what kind of punishment her majesty should be pleased\r\nto inflict upon me, for so great an offence. Then she sat down low upon\r\na cushion, and I upon my knees by her, but with her own hand she gave me\r\na cushion to lay under my knee, which at first I refused, but she\r\ncompelled me to take it. She then called for my lady Strafford out of\r\nthe next chamber, for the queen was alone. She enquired whether my queen\r\nor she played best? In that I found myself obliged to give her the\r\npraise. She said my French was very good, and asked if I could speak\r\nItalian, which she spoke reasonably well. I told her majesty I had no\r\ntime to learn the language, not having been above two months in Italy.\r\nThen she spake to me in Dutch, which was not good; and would know what\r\nkind of books I most delighted in, whether theology, history, or love\r\nmatters? I said I liked well of all the sorts. Here I took occasion to\r\npress earnestly my dispatch: she said I was sooner weary of her company\r\nthan she was of mine. I told her majesty, that though I had no reason of\r\nbeing weary, I knew my mistress her affairs called me home; yet I was\r\nstayed two days longer, that I might see her dance, as I was afterward\r\ninformed. Which being over, she enquired of me whether she or my queen\r\ndanced best? I answered, the queen danced not so high or disposedly as\r\nshe did. Then again she wished that she might see the queen at some\r\nconvenient place of meeting. I offered to convey her secretly to\r\nScotland by post, cloathed like a page, that under this disguise she\r\nmight see the queen, as James V. had gone in disguise with his own\r\nambassador to see the duke of Vendome's sister, who should have been his\r\nwife. Telling her that her chamber might be kept in her absence, as\r\nthough she were sick; that none need be privy thereto except lady\r\nStrafford, and one of the grooms of her chamber. She appeared to like\r\nthat kind of language, only answered it with a sigh, saying, Alas, if I\r\nmight do it thus!\"\r\n\r\nRespecting Leicester, Melvil says, that he was conveyed by him in his\r\nbarge from Hampton Court to London, and that, by the way, he inquired of\r\nhim what the queen of Scots thought of him and of the marriage proposed\r\nby Randolph. \"Whereunto,\" says he, \"I answered very coldly, as I had\r\nbeen by my queen commanded.\" Then he began to purge himself of so proud\r\na pretence as to marry so great a queen, declaring that he did not\r\nesteem himself worthy to wipe her shoes, and that the invention of that\r\nproposition of marriage proceeded from Mr. Cecil, his secret enemy:\r\n\"For if I,\" said he, \"should have appeared desirous of that marriage, I\r\nshould have offended both the queens, and lost their favor[54].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 54: Melvil's \"Memoirs,\" _passim_.]\r\n\r\nIf we are to receive as sincere this declaration of his sentiments by\r\nLeicester,--confessedly one of the deepest dissemblers of the age,--what\r\na curious view does it afford of the windings and intricacies of the\r\ncharacter of Elizabeth, of the tissue of ingenious snares which she\r\ndelighted to weave around the foot-steps even of the man whom she most\r\nfavored, loved, and trusted! Perhaps she encouraged, if she did not\r\noriginally devise, this matrimonial project purely as a romantic trial\r\nof his attachment to herself, and pleased her fancy with the idea of his\r\nrejecting for her a younger and a fairer queen;--perhaps she entertained\r\na transient thought of making him her own husband, and wished previously\r\nto give him consequence by this proposal;--perhaps she meant nothing\r\nmore than to perplex Mary by a variety of suitors, and thus delay her\r\nmarriage; an event which she could not anticipate without vexation.\r\n\r\nThat she was not sincere in her recommendation of Leicester is certain\r\nfrom the circumstance, that when the queen of Scots, appearing to\r\nincline to a speedy conclusion of the business, pressed to know on what\r\nconditions Elizabeth would give her approbation to the union, the\r\nearnestness in the cause which she had before displayed immediately\r\nabated.\r\n\r\nHer conduct with respect to Darnley is equally involved in perplexity\r\nand double-dealing. Melvil, as we have seen, asserts that it was\r\nElizabeth herself who first mentioned him as a suitable match for the\r\nqueen of Scots: and if his relation be correct, which his partiality\r\ntowards his own sovereign makes indeed somewhat doubtful, the English\r\nprincess must have been well aware, when she conversed with him, of the\r\nfavor with which the addresses of this young nobleman were likely to be\r\nreceived, though the envoy says that he forbore openly to express the\r\nsentiments of his court on this topic. It was after Melvil's departure\r\nthat Elizabeth, not indeed without reluctance and hesitation, permitted\r\nDarnley to accompany the earl his father into Scotland, ostensibly for\r\nthe purpose of witnessing the reversal of the attainder formerly passed\r\nagainst him, and his solemn restoration in blood; but really, as she\r\nmust well have known, with the object of pushing his suit with the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nMary no sooner beheld the handsome youth than she was seized with a\r\npassion for him, which she determined to gratify: but apprehensive, with\r\nreason, of the interference of Elizabeth, she disguised for the present\r\nher inclinations, and engaged with a feigned earnestness in negotiations\r\npreparatory to an union with Leicester. Meanwhile she was secretly\r\nsoliciting at Rome the necessary dispensation for marrying within the\r\nprohibited degrees of the church; and it was not till the arrival of\r\nthis instrument was speedily expected, and all her other preparations\r\nwere complete, that, taking off the mask, she requested her good\r\nsister's approbation of her approaching nuptials with lord Darnley.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely credible that a person of Elizabeth's sagacity, with her\r\nmeans of gaining intelligence and after all that had passed, could have\r\nbeen surprised by this notification of the intentions of the queen of\r\nScots, and it is even problematical how far she was really displeased at\r\nthe occurrence. Except by imitating her perpetual celibacy,--a\r\ncompliment to her envy and her example which could not in reason be\r\nexpected,--it might seem impossible for the queen of Scots better to\r\nconsult the views and wishes of her kinswoman than by uniting herself to\r\nDarnley;--a subject, and an English subject, a near relation both of her\r\nown and Elizabeth's, and a man on whom nature had bestowed not a single\r\nquality calculated to render him either formidable or respectable. The\r\nqueen of England, however, frowardly bent on opposing the match to the\r\nutmost, directed sir Nicholas Throgmorton, her ambassador, to set before\r\nthe eyes of Mary a long array of objections and impediments; and he was\r\nfurther authorized secretly to promise support to such of the Scottish\r\nnobles as would undertake to oppose it. She ordered, in the most\r\nimperious terms, the earl of Lenox and his son to return immediately\r\ninto England; threw the countess of Lenox into the Tower by way of\r\nintimidation; and caused her privy-council to exercise their ingenuity\r\nin discovering the manifold inconveniences and dangers likely to arise\r\nto herself and to her country from the alliance of the queen of Scots\r\nwith a house so nearly connected with the English crown.\r\n\r\nMary, however, persisted in accomplishing the union on which her mind\r\nwas set: Darnley and his father neglected Elizabeth's order of recall;\r\nand her privy-council vexed her by drawing from the melancholy\r\nforebodings which she had urged them to promulgate two unwelcome\r\ninferences;--that the queen ought to lose no time in forming a connexion\r\nwhich might cut off the hopes of others by giving to the nation\r\nposterity of her own;--and that as the Lenox family were known papists,\r\nit would now be expedient to exercise against all of that persuasion the\r\nutmost severity of the penal laws. The earl of Murray and some other\r\nmalcontent lords in Scotland were the only persons who entered with\r\nwarmth and sincerity into the measures of Elizabeth against the\r\nmarriage; for they alone had any personal interest in impeding the\r\nadvancement of the Lenox family. Rashly relying on the assurances which\r\nthey had received of aid from England, they took up arms against their\r\nsovereign; but finding no support from any quarter, they were soon\r\ncompelled to make their escape across the border and seek refuge with\r\nthe earl of Bedford, lord warden of the marches. On their arrival in\r\nLondon, the royal dissembler insisted on their declaring, in presence of\r\nthe French and Spanish ambassadors, that their rebellious attempts had\r\nreceived no encouragement from her; but after this open disavowal, she\r\npermitted them to remain unmolested in her dominions, secretly\r\nsupplying them with money and interceding with their offended sovereign\r\nin their behalf.\r\n\r\nMelvil acquaints us that when sir Nicholas Throgmorton, on returning\r\nfrom his embassy, found that the promises which he had made to these\r\nmalcontents had been disclaimed both by her majesty and by Randolph, he\r\n\"stood in awe neither of queen nor council to declare the verity, that\r\nhe had made such promises in her name, whereof the councillors and\r\ncraftiest courtiers thought strange, and were resolving to punish him\r\nfor avowing the same promise to be made in his mistress' name, had not\r\nhe wisely and circumspectly obtained an act of council for his warrant,\r\nwhich he offered to produce. And the said sir Nicholas was so angry that\r\nhe had been made an instrument to deceive the said banished lords, that\r\nhe advised them to sue humbly for pardon at their own queen's hand, and\r\nto engage never again to offend her for satisfaction of any prince\r\nalive. And because, as they were then stated, they had no interest, he\r\npenned for them a persuasive letter and sent to her majesty.\" On this\r\noccasion Throgmorton showed himself a warm friend to Mary's succession\r\nin England, and advised clemency to the banished lords as one mean to\r\nsecure it. Mary, highly esteeming him and convinced by his reasons,\r\nresolved to follow his counsels.\r\n\r\nElizabeth never willingly remitted any thing of that rigor against the\r\npuritans which she loved to believe it politic to exercise; but they\r\nwere fortunate enough to find an almost avowed patron in Leicester, and\r\nsecret favorers in several of her ministers and counsellors; and during\r\nthe persecutions of the catholics which followed the marriage of Mary,\r\nshe was compelled to press upon them with a less heavy hand.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Parker, who was proceeding with much self-satisfaction and\r\nsuccess in the task of silencing by the pains of suspension and\r\ndeprivation all scruples of conscience among the clergy respecting\r\nhabits and ceremonies, was now mortified to find his zeal restrained by\r\nthe interference of the queen herself, while the exulting puritans\r\nstudied to improve to the utmost the temporary connivance of the ruling\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1565 AND 1566.\r\n\r\nRenewal of the archduke's proposal.--Disappointment of\r\nLeicester.--Anecdote concerning him.--Disgrace of the earl of\r\nArundel.--Situation of the duke of Norfolk.--Leicester his secret\r\nenemy.--Notice of the earl of Sussex.--Proclamation respecting fencing\r\nschools.--Marriage of lady Mary Grey.--Sir H. Sidney deputy of\r\nIreland.--Queen's letter to him.--Prince of Scotland born.--Melvil sent\r\nwith the news to Elizabeth.--His account of his reception.--Motion in\r\nthe house of commons for naming a successor.--Discord between the house\r\nand the queen on this ground.--She refuses a subsidy--dissolves\r\nparliament--visits Oxford.--Particulars of her reception.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not it was with a view of impeding the marriage of the queen\r\nof Scots that Elizabeth had originally encouraged the renewal of the\r\nproposals of the archduke to herself, certain it is that the treaty was\r\nstill carried on, and even with increased earnestness, long after this\r\nmotive had ceased to operate.\r\n\r\nIt was subsequently to Mary's announcement of her approaching nuptials,\r\nthat to the instances of the imperial ambassador Elizabeth had replied,\r\nthat she desired to keep herself free till she had finally decided\r\non the answer to be given to the king of France, who had also offered\r\nher his hand[55]. After breaking off this negotiation with Charles IX.,\r\nshe declared to the same ambassador, that she would never engage to\r\nmarry a person whom she had not seen;--an answer which seemed to hint to\r\nthe archduke that a visit would be well received. It was accordingly\r\nreported with confidence that this prince would soon commence his\r\njourney to England; and Cecil himself ventured to write to a friend,\r\nthat if he would accede to the national religion, and if his person\r\nproved acceptable to her majesty, \"except God should please to continue\r\nhis displeasure against us, we should see some success.\" But he thought\r\nthat the archduke would never explain himself on religion to any one\r\nexcept the queen, and not to her until he should see hopes of speeding.\r\n\r\n[Note 55: It is on the authority of Strype's \"Annals\" that this\r\noffer of Charles IX. to Elizabeth is recorded. Hume, Camden, Rapin, are\r\nall silent respecting it; but as it seems that Catherine dei Medici was\r\nat the time desirous of the appearance of a closer connexion with\r\nElizabeth, it is not improbable that she might throw out some hint of\r\nthis nature without any real wish of bringing about an union in all\r\nrespects so unsuitable.]\r\n\r\nThe splendid dream of Leicester's ambition was dissipated for ever by\r\nthese negotiations; and a diminution of the queen's partiality towards\r\nhim, distinctly visible to the observant eyes of her courtiers, either\r\npreceded or accompanied her entertaining so long, and with such an air\r\nof serious deliberation, the proposals of a foreign prince. The enemies\r\nof Leicester,--a large and formidable party, comprehending almost all\r\nthe highest names among the nobility and the greater part of the\r\nministers,--openly and zealously espoused the interest of the archduke.\r\nLeicester at first with equal warmth and equal openness opposed his\r\npretensions; but he was soon admonished by the frowns of his royal\r\nmistress, that if he would preserve or recover his influence, he must\r\nnow be content to take a humbler tone, and disguise a disappointment\r\nwhich there was arrogance in avowing.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Elizabeth partook so much more of the haughty than\r\nthe tender, that the slightest appearances of presumption would always\r\nprovoke her to take a pleasure in mortifying the most distinguished of\r\nher favorites; and it might be no improbable guess, that almost the\r\nwhole of the encouragement given by her to the addresses of the archduke\r\nwas prompted by the desire of humbling the pride of Leicester, and\r\nshowing him that his ascendency over her was not so complete or so\r\nsecure as he imagined.\r\n\r\nA circumstance is related which we may conjecture to have occurred about\r\nthis time, and which sets in a strong light this part of the character\r\nof Elizabeth. \"Bowyer, a gentleman of the Black Rod, being charged by\r\nher express command to look precisely into all admissions into the\r\nprivy-chamber, one day stayed a very gay captain, and a follower of my\r\nlord of Leicester's, from entrance; for that he was neither well known,\r\nnor a sworn servant to the queen: at which repulse, the gentleman,\r\nbearing high on my lord's favor, told him, he might perchance procure\r\nhim a discharge. Leicester coming into the contestation, said publicly\r\n(which was none of his wont) that he was a knave, and should not\r\ncontinue long in his office; and so turning about to go in to the queen,\r\nBowyer, who was a bold gentleman and well beloved, stepped before him\r\nand fell at her majesty's feet, related the story, and humbly craves her\r\ngrace's pleasure; and whether my lord of Leicester was king, or her\r\nmajesty queen? Whereunto she replied with her wonted oath, 'God's death,\r\nmy lord, I have wished you well; but my favor is not so locked up for\r\nyou, that others shall not partake thereof; for I have many servants, to\r\nwhom I have, and will at my pleasure, bequeath my favor, and likewise\r\nresume the same: and if you think to rule here, I will take a course to\r\nsee you forthcoming. I will have here but one mistress, and no master;\r\nand look that no ill happen to him, lest it be required at your hands.'\r\nWhich words so quelled my lord of Leicester, that his feigned humility\r\nwas long after one of his best virtues[56].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 56: Naunton's \"Fragmenta Regalia.\"]\r\n\r\nIt might be some consolation to Leicester, under his own mortifications,\r\nto behold his ancient rival the earl of Arundel subjected to far severer\r\nones. This nobleman had resigned in disgust his office of\r\nlord-chamberlain; subsequently, the queen, on some ground of displeasure\r\nnow unknown, had commanded him to confine himself to his own house; and\r\nat the end of several months passed under this kind of restraint, she\r\nstill denied him for a further term the consolation and privilege of\r\napproaching her royal presence. Disgraces so public and so lasting\r\ndetermined him to throw up the desperate game on which he had hazarded\r\nso deep a stake: he obtained leave to travel, and hastened to conceal or\r\nforget in foreign lands the bitterness of his disappointment and the\r\nembarrassment of his circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that from this time Elizabeth found no more serious\r\nsuitors amongst her courtiers, though they flattered her by continuing,\r\nalmost to the end of her life, to address her in the language of love,\r\nor rather of gallantry. With all her coquetry, her head was clear, her\r\npassions were cool; and men began to perceive that there was little\r\nchance of prevailing with her to gratify her heart or her fancy at the\r\nexpense of that independence on which her lofty temper led her to set so\r\nhigh a value. Some were still uncharitable, unjust enough to believe\r\nthat Leicester was, or had been, a fortunate lover; but few now expected\r\nto see him her husband, and none found encouragement sufficient to renew\r\nthe experiment in which he had failed. Notwithstanding her short and\r\ncapricious fits of pride and anger, it was manifest that Leicester still\r\nexercised over her mind an influence superior on the whole to that of\r\nany other person; and the high distinction with which she continued to\r\ntreat him, both in public and private, alarmed the jealousy and provoked\r\nthe hostility of all who thought themselves entitled by rank, by\r\nrelationship, or by merit, to a larger share of her esteem and favor, or\r\na more intimate participation in her councils.\r\n\r\nOne nobleman there was, who had peculiar pretensions to supersede\r\nLeicester in his popular appellation of \"Heart of the Court,\" and on\r\nwhom he had already fixed in secret the watchful eye of a rival. This\r\nwas Thomas duke of Norfolk. Inheriting through several channels the\r\nblood of the Plantagenets,--nearly related to the queen by her maternal\r\nancestry, and connected by descent or alliance with the whole body of\r\nthe ancient nobility; endeared also to the people by many shining\r\nqualities, and still more by his unfeigned zeal for reformed\r\nreligion,--his grace stood first amongst the peers of England, not in\r\ndegree alone or in wealth, but in power, in influence, and in public\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nHe was in the prime of manhood and lately a widower; and when, in the\r\nparliament of 1566, certain members did not scruple to maintain that the\r\nqueen ought to be compelled to marry for the good of her country, the\r\nduke was named by some, as the earl of Pembroke was by others and the\r\nearl of Leicester by a third party, as the person whom she ought to\r\naccept as a husband. It does not however appear that the duke himself\r\nhad aspired, openly at least, to these august but unattainable nuptials.\r\n\r\nElizabeth seems to have entertained for him at this period a real\r\nregard: he could be to her no object of distrust or danger, and the\r\nexample which she was ever careful to set of a scrupulous observance of\r\nthe gradations of rank, led her on all occasions to prefer him to the\r\npost of honor. Thus, after the peace with France in 1564, when Charles\r\nIX. in return for the Garter, which the queen of England had sent him,\r\noffered to confer the order of St. Michael on two English nobles of her\r\nappointment, she named without hesitation the duke of Norfolk and the\r\nearl of Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of Dudley seldom escaped from the control of policy; and\r\nas he had the sagacity to perceive that the duke was a competitor over\r\nwhom treachery alone could render him finally triumphant, he cautiously\r\navoided with him any open collision of interests, any offensive rivalry\r\nin matters of place and dignity. He even went further; he compelled\r\nhimself, by a feigned deference, to administer food to that exaggerated\r\nself-consequence,--the cherished foible of the house of Howard in\r\ngeneral and of this duke in particular,--out of which he perhaps already\r\nhoped that matter would arise to work his ruin. The chronicles of the\r\nyear 1565 give a striking instance of this part of his behaviour, in the\r\ninformation, that the duke of Norfolk, going to keep his Christmas in\r\nhis own county, was attended out of London by the earls of Leicester and\r\nWarwick, the lord-chamberlain and other lords and gentlemen, who brought\r\nhim on his journey, \"doing him all the honor in their power.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke was not gifted with any great degree of penetration, and the\r\ngenerosity of his disposition combined with his vanity to render him\r\ngenerally the dupe of outward homage and fair professions. He repaid the\r\ninsidious complaisance of Leicester with good will and even with\r\nconfidence; and it was not till all was lost that he appears to have\r\nrecognised this fatal and irreparable error.\r\n\r\nThomas earl of Sussex was an antagonist of a different nature,--an enemy\r\nrather than a rival,--and one who sought the overthrow of Leicester\r\nwith as much zeal and industry as Leicester himself sought his, or that\r\nof the duke; but by means as open and courageous as those of his\r\nopponent were ever secret, base, and cowardly. This nobleman, the third\r\nearl of the surname of Radcliffe, and son of him who had interfered with\r\neffect to procure more humane and respectful treatment of Elizabeth\r\nduring the period of her adversity, had been first known by the title of\r\nlord Fitzwalter, which he derived from a powerful line of barons well\r\nknown in English history from the days of Henry I. By his mother, a\r\ndaughter of Thomas second duke of Norfolk, he was first-cousin to queen\r\nAnne Boleyn; and friendship, still more than the ties of blood, closely\r\nconnected him with the head of the Howards. Several circumstances render\r\nit probable that he was not a zealous protestant, though it is no where\r\nhinted that he was even secretly attached to the catholic party. During\r\nthe reign of Mary, his high character and approved loyalty had caused\r\nhim to be employed, first in an embassy to the emperor Charles V. to\r\nsettle the queen's marriage-articles; and afterwards in the arduous post\r\nof lord-deputy of Ireland. Elizabeth continued him for some time in this\r\nsituation; but wishing to avail herself of his counsels and service at\r\nhome, she recalled him in 1565, conferred upon him the high dignity of\r\nlord-chamberlain, vacant by the resignation of the earl of Arundel, and\r\nappointed as his successor in Ireland his excellent second in office sir\r\nHenry Sidney, who stood in the same relation, that of brother-in-law, to\r\nSussex and to Leicester, and whose singular merit and good fortune it\r\nwas to preserve to the end the esteem and friendship of both.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible cause of quarrel between these two earls seems to have\r\nbeen their difference of opinion respecting the Austrian match; but this\r\nwas rather the pretext than the motive of an animosity deeply rooted in\r\nthe natures and situation of each, and probably called into action by\r\nparticular provocations now unknown. The disposition of Sussex was\r\ncourageous and sincere; his spirit high, his judgement clear and strong,\r\nhis whole character honorable and upright. In the arts of a courtier,\r\nwhich he despised, he was confessedly inferior to his wily adversary; in\r\nall the qualifications of a statesman and a soldier he vastly excelled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSussex was endowed with penetration sufficient to detect, beneath the\r\nthick folds of hypocrisy and artifice in which he had involved them, the\r\nmonstrous vices of Leicester's disposition; and he could not without\r\nindignation and disgust behold a princess whose blood he shared, whose\r\ncharacter he honored, and whose service he had himself embraced with\r\npure devotion, the dupe of an impostor so despicable and so pernicious.\r\nThat influence which he saw Leicester abuse to the dishonor of the queen\r\nand the detriment of the country, he undertook to overthrow by fair and\r\npublic means, and, so far as appears, without motives of personal\r\ninterest or ambition:--thus far all was well, and for the effort,\r\nwhether successful or not, he merited the public thanks. But there\r\nmingled in the bosom of the high-born Sussex an illiberal disdain of\r\nthe origin of Dudley, with a just abhorrence of his character and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nHe was wont to say of him, that two ancestors were all that he could\r\nnumber, his father and grandfather; both traitors and enemies to their\r\ncountry. His sarcasms roused in Leicester an animosity which he did not\r\nattempt to disguise: with the exception of Cecil and his friends, who\r\nstood neuter, the whole court divided into factions upon the quarrel of\r\nthese two powerful peers; and to such extremity were matters carried,\r\nthat for some time neither of them would stir abroad without a numerous\r\ntrain armed, according to the fashion of the day, with daggers and\r\nspiked bucklers.\r\n\r\nScarcely could the queen herself restrain these \"angry opposites\" from\r\nbreaking out into acts of violence: at length however, summoning them\r\nboth into her presence, she forced them to a reconciliation neither more\r\nnor less sincere than such pacifications by authority have usually\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe open and unmeasured enmity of Sussex seems to have been productive\r\nin the end of more injury to his own friends than to Leicester. The\r\nstorm under which the favorite had bowed for an instant was quickly\r\noverpast, and he once more reared his head erect and lofty as before. To\r\nrevenge himself by the ruin or disgrace of Sussex was however beyond his\r\npower: the well-founded confidence of Elizabeth in his abilities and his\r\nattachment to her person, he found to be immovable; but against his\r\nfriends and adherents, against the duke of Norfolk himself, his\r\nmalignant arts succeeded but too well; and it seems not improbable that\r\nLeicester, for the purpose of carrying on without molestation his\r\npractices against them, concurred in procuring for his adversary an\r\nhonorable exile in the shape of an embassy to the imperial court, on\r\nwhich he departed in the year 1567.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from this mission the queen named the earl of Sussex\r\nlord-president of the North, an appointment which equally removed him\r\nfrom the immediate theatre of court intrigue. Not long after, the hand\r\nof death put a final close to his honorable career, and to an enmity\r\ndestined to know no other termination. As he lay upon his death-bed,\r\nthis eminent person is recorded to have thus addressed his surrounding\r\nfriends: \"I am now passing into another world, and must leave you to\r\nyour fortunes and to the queen's grace and goodness; but beware of the\r\n_Gipsy_ (meaning Leicester), for he will be too hard for you all; you\r\nknow not the beast so well as I do[57].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 57: Naunton's \"Fragmenta Regalia.\"]\r\n\r\nThis earl left no children, and his widow became the munificent\r\nfoundress of Sidney Sussex college, Cambridge. Of his negotiations with\r\nthe court of Vienna respecting the royal marriage which he had so much\r\nat heart, particulars will be given in due time; but the miscellaneous\r\ntransactions of two or three preceding years claim a priority of\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\nBy a proclamation of February 1566, the queen revived some former\r\nsumptuary laws respecting apparel; chiefly, it should appear, from an\r\napprehension that a dangerous confusion of ranks would be the\r\nconsequence of indulging to her subjects the liberty of private\r\njudgement in a matter so important. The following clause concerning\r\nfencing schools is appended to this instrument.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is daily seen what disorders do grow and are likely to\r\nincrease in the realm, by the increase of numbers of persons taking upon\r\nthem to teach the multitude of common people to play at all kind of\r\nweapons; and for that purpose set up schools called schools of fence, in\r\nplaces inconvenient; tending to the great disorder of such people as\r\nproperly ought to apply to their labours and handy works: Therefore her\r\nmajesty ordereth and commandeth, that no teacher of fence shall keep any\r\nschool or common place of resort in any place of the realm, but within\r\nthe liberties of some city of the realm. Where also they shall be\r\nobedient to such orders as the governors of the cities shall appoint to\r\nthem, for the better keeping of the peace, and for prohibition of resort\r\nof such people to the same schools as are not mete for that purpose.\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nOn these restrictions, which would seem to imply an unworthy jealousy of\r\nputting arms and the skill to use them into the hands of the common\r\npeople, it is equitable to remark, that the custom of constantly wearing\r\nweapons, at this time almost universal, though prohibited by the laws of\r\nsome of our early kings, had been found productive of those frequent\r\nacts of violence and outrage which have uniformly resulted from this\r\ntruly barbarous practice in all the countries where it has been suffered\r\nto prevail.\r\n\r\nFrom the description of England prefixed to Holinshed's Chronicles, we\r\nlearn several particulars on this subject. Few men, even of the gravest\r\nand most pacific characters, such as ancient burgesses and city\r\nmagistrates, went without a dagger at their side or back. The nobility\r\ncommonly wore swords or rapiers as well as daggers, as did every common\r\nserving-man following his master. Some \"desperate cutters\" carried two\r\ndaggers, or two rapiers in a sheath, always about them, with which in\r\nevery drunken fray they worked much mischief; their swords and daggers\r\nalso were of an extraordinary length (an abuse which was provided\r\nagainst by a clause of the proclamation above quoted); some \"suspicious\r\nfellows\" also would carry on the highways staves of twelve or thirteen\r\nfeet long, with pikes of twelve inches at the end, wherefore the honest\r\ntraveller was compelled to ride with a case of _dags_ (pistols) at his\r\nsaddle-bow, and none travelled without sword, or dagger, or hanger.\r\n\r\nAbout this time occurred what a contemporary reporter called \"an unhappy\r\nchance and monstrous;\" the marriage of lady Mary Grey to the\r\nserjeant-porter: a circumstance thus recorded by Fuller, with his\r\naccustomed quaintness. \"Mary Grey... frighted with the infelicity of her\r\ntwo elder sisters, Jane and this Catherine, forgot her honor to remember\r\nher safety, and married one whom she could love and none need fear,\r\nMartin Kays, of Kent esquire, who was a judge at court, (but only of\r\ndoubtful casts at dice, being serjeant-porter,) and died without issue\r\nthe 20th of April 1578[58].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 58: \"Worthies in Leicestershire.\"]\r\n\r\nThe queen, according to her usual practice in similar cases, sent both\r\nhusband and wife to prison. What became further of the husband I do not\r\nfind; but respecting the wife, sir Thomas Gresham the eminent merchant,\r\nin a letter to lord Burleigh dated in April 1572, mentions, that the\r\nlady Mary Grey had been kept in his house nearly three years, and begs\r\nof his lordship that he will make interest for her removal. Thus it\r\nshould appear that this unfortunate lady did not sufficiently \"remember\r\nher safety\" in forming this connexion, obscure and humble as it was; for\r\nall matrimony had now become offensive to the austerity or the secret\r\nenvy of the maiden queen.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sidney, on arriving to take the government of Ireland, found\r\nthat unhappy country in a state of more than ordinary turbulence,\r\ndistraction, and misery. Petty insurrections of perpetual recurrence\r\nharassed the English pale; and the native chieftains, disdaining to\r\naccept the laws of a foreign sovereign as the umpire of their disputes,\r\nwere waging innumerable private wars, which at once impoverished,\r\nafflicted, and barbarized their country. The most important of these\r\nfeuds was one between the earls of Ormond and Desmond, which so\r\ndisquieted the queen that, in addition to all official instructions, she\r\ndeemed it necessary to address her deputy on the subject in a private\r\nletter written with her own hand. This document, printed in the Sidney\r\npapers, is too valuable, as a specimen of her extraordinary style and\r\nher manner of thinking, to be omitted. It is without date, but must have\r\nbeen written in 1565.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Letter of Queen Elizabeth to Sir Henry Sidney, on the Quarrel between\r\nThomas Earl of Ormond and the Earl of Desmond, _anno_ 1565.\r\n\r\n\"HARRY,\r\n\r\n\"If our partial slender managing of the contentious quarrel between the\r\ntwo Irish earls did not make the way to cause these lines to pass my\r\nhand, this gibberish should hardly have cumbered your eyes; but warned\r\nby my former fault, and dreading worser hap to come, I rede you take\r\ngood heed that the good subjects lost state be so revenged that I hear\r\nnot the rest be won to a right bye way to breed more traitor's stocks,\r\nand so the goal is gone.

The fourth day after, I was at London, and did first meet with\r\nmy brother sir Robert (then ambassador to England), who that same night\r\nsent and advertised secretary Cecil of my arrival, and of the birth of\r\nthe prince, desiring him to keep it quiet till my coming to court to\r\nshow it myself unto her majesty, who was for the time at Greenwich,\r\nwhere her majesty was in great mirth, dancing after supper. But so soon\r\nas the secretary Cecil whispered in her ear the news of the prince's\r\nbirth, all her mirth was laid aside for that night. All present\r\nmarvelling whence proceeded such a change; for the queen did sit down,\r\nputting her hand under her cheek, bursting out to some of her ladies,\r\nthat the queen of Scots was mother of a fair son, while she was but a\r\nbarren stock.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning was appointed for me to get audience, at what time my\r\nbrother and I went by water to Greenwich, and were met by some friends\r\nwho told us how sorrowful her majesty was at my news, but that she had\r\nbeen advised to show a glad and cheerful countenance; which she did in\r\nher best apparel, saying, that the joyful news of the queen her sister's\r\ndelivery of a fair son, which I had sent her by secretary Cecil, had\r\nrecovered her out of a heavy sickness which she had lain under for\r\nfifteen days. Therefore she welcomed me with a merry volt, and thanked\r\nme for the diligence I had used in hasting to give her that welcome\r\nintelligence.\" &c. \"The next day her majesty sent unto me her letter,\r\nwith the present of a fair chain.\"\r\n\r\nResolved to perform with a good grace the part which she had assumed,\r\nElizabeth accepted with alacrity the office of sponsor to the prince of\r\nScotland, sending thither as her proxies the earl of Bedford, Mr. Carey\r\nson of lord Hunsdon, and other knights and gentlemen; who met with so\r\ncordial a reception from Mary,--now at open variance with her husband,\r\nand therefore desirous of support from England,--as to provoke the\r\njealousy of the French ambassadors. The present of the royal godmother\r\nwas a font of pure gold worth above one thousand pounds; in return for\r\nwhich, rings, rich chains of diamond and pearl, and other jewels were\r\nliberally bestowed upon her substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe birth of her son lent a vast accession of strength to the party of\r\nthe queen of Scots in England; and Melvil was commissioned to convey\r\nback to her from several of the principal personages of the court, warm\r\nprofessions of an attachment to her person and interests, which the\r\njealousy of their mistress compelled them to dissemble. Elizabeth, on\r\nher part, was more than ever disturbed by suspicions on this head, which\r\nwere kept in constant activity by the secret informations of the armies\r\nof spies whom it was her self-tormenting policy to set over the words\r\nand actions of the Scottish queen and her English partisans. The more\r\nshe learned of the influence privately acquired by Mary amongst her\r\nsubjects, the more, of course, she feared and hated her, and the\r\nstronger became her determination never to give her additional\r\nconsequence by an open recognition of her right of succession. At the\r\nsame time she was fully sensible that no other person could be thought\r\nof as the inheritrix of her crown; and she resolved, perhaps wisely, to\r\nmaintain on this subject an inflexible silence: this policy, however,\r\nconnected with her perseverance in a state of celibacy, began to awaken\r\nin her people an anxiety respecting their future destinies, which, being\r\nartfully fomented by Scottish emissaries, produced, in 1566, the first\r\nsymptoms of discord between the queen and her faithful commons.\r\n\r\nA motion was made in the lower house for reviving the suit to her\r\nmajesty touching the naming of a successor in case of her death without\r\nposterity; and in spite of the strenuous opposition of the court party,\r\nand the efforts of the ministers to procure a delay by declaring \"that\r\nthe queen was moved to marriage and inclined to prosecute the same,\" it\r\nwas carried, and a committee appointed to confer with the lords. The\r\nbusiness was not very agreeable to the upper house: a committee however\r\nwas named, and the queen soon after required some members of both houses\r\nto wait upon her respecting this matter; when the lord-keeper explained\r\ntheir sentiments in a long speech, to which her majesty was pleased to\r\nreply after her darkest and most ambiguous manner. \"As to her marriage,\"\r\nshe said, \"a silent thought might serve. She thought it had been so\r\ndesired that none other trees blossom should have been minded or ever\r\nany hope of fruit had been denied them. But that if any doubted that she\r\nwas by vow or determination never bent to trade in that kind of life,\r\nshe bade them put out that kind of heresy, for their belief was therein\r\nawry. And though she could think it best for a private woman, yet she\r\nstrove with herself to think it not meet for a prince. As to the\r\nsuccession, she bade them not think that they had needed this desire, if\r\nshe had seen a time so fit; and it so ripe to be denounced. That the\r\ngreatness of the cause, and the need of their return, made her say that\r\na short time for so long a continuance ought not to pass by rote. That\r\nas cause by conference with the learned should show her matter worth\r\nutterance for their behoof, so she would more gladly pursue their good\r\nafter her days, than with all her prayers while she lived be a means to\r\nlinger out her living thread. That for their comfort, she had good\r\nrecord in that place that other means than they mentioned had been\r\nthought of perchance for their good, as much as for her own surety:\r\nwhich, if they could have been presently or conveniently executed, it\r\nhad not been now deferred or over-slipped. That she hoped to die in\r\nquiet with _Nunc dimittis_, which could not be without she saw some\r\nglimpse of their following surety after her graved bones.\"\r\n\r\nThese vague sentences tended little to the satisfaction of the house;\r\nand a motion was made, and strongly supported by the speeches of several\r\nmembers, for reiteration of the suit. At this her majesty was so\r\nincensed, that she communicated by sir Francis Knowles her positive\r\ncommand to the house to proceed no further in this business, satisfying\r\nthemselves with the promise of marriage which she had made on the word\r\nof a prince. But that truly independent member Paul Wentworth could not\r\nbe brought to acquiesce with tameness in this prohibition, and he moved\r\nthe house on the question, whether the late command of her majesty was\r\nnot a breach of its privileges? The queen hereupon issued an injunction\r\nthat there should be no debates on this point; but the spirit of\r\nresistance rose so high in the house of commons against this her\r\narbitrary interference, that she found it expedient, a few days after,\r\nto rescind both orders, making a great favor however of her compliance,\r\nand insisting on the condition, that the subject should not at this time\r\nbe further pursued.\r\n\r\nIn her speech on adjourning parliament she did not omit to acquaint both\r\nhouses with her extreme displeasure at their interference touching the\r\nnaming of a successor; a matter which she always chose to regard as\r\nbelonging exclusively to her prerogative;--and she ended by telling\r\nthem, \"that though perhaps they might have after her one better learned\r\nor wiser, yet she assured them none more careful over them. And\r\ntherefore henceforth she bade them beware how they proved their prince's\r\npatience as they had now done hers. And notwithstanding, not meaning,\r\nshe said, to make a Lent of Christmas, the most part of them might\r\nassure themselves that they departed in their prince's grace[61].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 61: Strype's \"Annals.\"]\r\n\r\nShe utterly refused an extraordinary subsidy which the commons had\r\noffered on condition of her naming her successor, and even of the\r\nordinary supplies which she accepted, she remitted a fourth, popularly\r\nobserving, that it was as well for her to have money in the coffers of\r\nher subjects as in her own. By such an alternation of menaces and\r\nflatteries did Elizabeth contrive to preserve her ascendency over the\r\nhearts and minds of her people!\r\n\r\nThe earl of Leicester had lately been elected chancellor of the\r\nuniversity of Oxford, and in the autumn of 1566 the queen consented to\r\nhonor with her presence this seat of learning, long ambitious of such a\r\ndistinction. She was received with the same ceremonies as at Cambridge:\r\nlearned exhibitions of the same nature awaited her; and she made a\r\nsimilar parade of her bashfulness, and a still greater of her erudition;\r\naddressing this university not in Latin, but in Greek.\r\n\r\nOf the dramatic exhibitions prepared for her recreation, an elegant\r\nwriter has recorded the following particulars[62]. \"In the magnificent\r\nhall of Christ-church, she was entertained with a Latin comedy called\r\nMarcus Geminus, the Latin tragedy of Progne, and an English comedy on\r\nthe story of Palamon and Arcite, (by Richard Edwards gentleman of the\r\nqueen's chapel, and master of the choristers,) all acted by the students\r\nof the university. When the last play was over, the queen summoned the\r\npoet into her presence, whom she loaded with thanks and compliments: and\r\nat the same time, turning to her levee, remarked, that Palamon was so\r\njustly drawn as a lover, that he must have been in love indeed; that\r\nArcite was a right martial knight, having a swart and manly countenance,\r\nyet with the aspect of a Venus clad in armour: that the lovely Emilia\r\nwas a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unblemished simplicity; and that\r\nthough she sung so sweetly, and gathered flowers alone in the garden,\r\nshe preserved her chastity undeflowered. The part of Emilia, the only\r\nfemale part in the play, was acted by a boy of fourteen, whose\r\nperformance so captivated her majesty, that she made him a present of\r\neight guineas[63]. During the exhibition, a cry of hounds belonging to\r\nTheseus was counterfeited without in the great square of the college;\r\nthe young students thought it a real chase, and were seized with a\r\nsudden transport to join the hunters: at which the queen cried out from\r\nher box, \"O excellent! these boys, in very troth, are ready to leap out\r\nof the windows to follow the hounds!\"\r\n\r\n[Note 62: Warton's \"History of English Poetry.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 63: Mr. Warton apparently forgets that _guineas_ were first\r\ncoined by Charles II.]\r\n\r\nDr. Lawrence Humphreys, who had lately been distinguished by his\r\nstrenuous opposition to the injunctions of the queen and archbishop\r\nParker respecting the habits and ceremonies, was at this time\r\nvice-chancellor of Oxford; and when he came forth in procession to meet\r\nthe queen, she could not forbear saying with a smile, as she gave him\r\nher hand to kiss--\"That loose gown, Mr. Doctor, becomes you mighty well;\r\nI wonder your notions should be so narrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1567 AND 1568.\r\n\r\nTerms on which Elizabeth offers to acknowledge Mary as her\r\nsuccessor,--rejected by the Scots.--Death of Darnley.--Conduct of\r\nElizabeth towards his mother.--Letter of Cecil.--Letter of Elizabeth to\r\nMary.--Mary marries Bothwell--is defeated at Langside--committed to Loch\r\nLeven castle.--Interference of Elizabeth in her behalf.--Earl of Sussex\r\nambassador to Vienna.--Letters from him to Elizabeth respecting the\r\narchduke.--Causes of the failure of the marriage treaty with this\r\nprince.--Notice of lord Buckhurst.--Visit of the queen to Fotheringay\r\ncastle.--Mary escapes from prison--raises an army--is defeated--flies\r\ninto England.--Conduct of Elizabeth.--Mary submits her cause to\r\nher--is detained prisoner.--Russian embassy.--Chancellor's voyage\r\nto Archangel.--Trade opened with Russia.--Treaty with the\r\nCzar.--Negotiations between Elizabeth and the French court.--Marriage\r\nproposed with the duke of Anjou.--Privy-council hostile to\r\nFrance.--Queen on bad terms with Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the uniform success and general applause which had\r\nhitherto crowned her administration, at no point perhaps of her whole\r\nreign was the path of Elizabeth more beset with perplexities and\r\ndifficulties than at the commencement of the year 1567.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the Scottish faction had compelled her to give a\r\npledge to her parliament respecting matrimony, which must either be\r\nredeemed by the sacrifice of her darling independence, or forfeited\r\nwith the loss of her credit and popularity. Her favorite\r\nstate-mystery,--the choice of a successor,--had also been invaded by\r\nrude and daring hands; and to such extremity was she reduced on this\r\npoint, that she had found it necessary to empower the commissioners whom\r\nshe sent into Scotland for the baptism of the prince, distinctly to\r\npropound the following offer. That on a simple ratification by Mary of\r\nonly so much of the treaty of Edinburgh as engaged her to advance no\r\nclaim upon the English crown during the lifetime of Elizabeth or any\r\nposterity of hers, a solemn recognition of her right of succession\r\nshould be made by the queen and parliament of England.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish ministry, instead of closing instantly with so advantageous\r\na proposal, were imprudent enough to insist upon a previous examination\r\nof the will of Henry VIII., which they fondly believed that they could\r\nshow to be a forgery: and the delay which the refusal of Elizabeth\r\noccasioned, gave time for the interposition of circumstances which\r\nruined for ever the character and authority of Mary, and rescued her\r\nsister-queen from this dilemma.\r\n\r\nOn February the 9th 1567, lord Darnley, then called king of Scots,\r\nperished by a violent and mysterious death. Bothwell, the queen's new\r\nfavorite, was universally accused of the murder; and the open discord\r\nwhich had subsisted, even before the assassination of Rizzio, between\r\nthe royal pair, gave strong ground of suspicion that Mary herself was a\r\nparticipator in the crime.\r\n\r\nElizabeth behaved on this tragical occurrence with the utmost decorum\r\nand moderation; she expressed no opinion hostile to the fame of the\r\nqueen of Scots, and took no immediate measures of a public nature\r\nrespecting it. It can scarcely be doubted however, that, in common with\r\nall Europe, she secretly believed in the guilt of Mary; and even though\r\nat the bottom of her heart she may have desired rather to see her\r\ncondemned than acquitted in the general verdict, such a feeling ought\r\nnot, under all the circumstances, to be imputed to her as indicative of\r\nany extraordinary malignity of disposition. To announce to the countess\r\nof Lenox, still her prisoner, the frightful catastrophe which had closed\r\nthe history of her rash misguided son, was the first step taken by\r\nElizabeth: it was a proper, and even an indispensable one; but the\r\nrespectful and considerate manner of the communication, contrasted with\r\nformer harsh treatment, might be designed to intimate to the house of\r\nLenox that it should now find in her a protectress, and perhaps an\r\navenger.\r\n\r\nWe possess a letter addressed by Cecil to sir Henry Norris ambassador in\r\nFrance, in which are found some particulars on this subject, oddly\r\nprefaced by a commission on which it is amusing to a modern reader to\r\ncontemplate a prime minister at such a time, and with so much gravity,\r\nengaged. But the division of labor in public offices seems to have been\r\nin this age very imperfect: Elizabeth employed her secretary of state to\r\nprocure her a mantua-maker; James I. occupied his in transcribing\r\nsonnets of his own composition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Cecil to sir Henry Norris. February 20th 1566-7.\r\n\r\n\"...The queen's majesty would fain have a taylor that had skill to make\r\nher apparel both after the French and Italian manner; and she thinketh\r\nthat you might use some means to obtain some one such there as serveth\r\nthat queen, without mentioning any manner of request in the queen's\r\nmajesty's name. First, to cause my lady your wife to use some such means\r\nto get one as thereof knowledge might not come to the queen mother's\r\nears, of whom the queen's majesty thinketh thus: That if she did\r\nunderstand it were a matter wherein her majesty might be pleasured, she\r\nwould offer to send one to the queen's majesty. Nevertheless, if it\r\ncannot be so obtained by this indirect means, then her majesty would\r\nhave you devise some other good means to obtain one that were skilful.\r\n\r\n\"I have stayed your son from going hence now these two days, upon the\r\nqueen's commandment, for that she would have him to have as much of the\r\ntruth of the circumstances of the murder of the king of Scots as might\r\nbe; and hitherto the same is hard to come by, other than in a\r\ngenerality.... The queen's majesty sent yesterday my lady Howard and my\r\nwife to the lady Lenox to the Tower, to open this matter unto her, who\r\ncould not by any means be kept from such passions of mind as the\r\nhorribleness of the fact did require. And this last night were with her\r\nthe said lady, the dean of Westminster, and Dr. Huick, and I hope her\r\nmajesty will show some favorable compassion of the said lady, whom any\r\nhumane nature must needs pity[64].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 64: \"Scrinia Ceciliana.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe liberation of the countess followed; and the earl her husband soon\r\nafter gratified Elizabeth's desire to interfere, by invoking her\r\nassistance to procure, by representations to Mary, some extension of the\r\nunusually short time within which he was required to bring forward his\r\nproofs against Bothwell, whom he had accused of the assassination of his\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThis petition produced a very earnest letter from one queen to the\r\nother; in which Elizabeth plainly represented to her royal sister, that\r\nthe refusal of such a request to the father of her husband would bring\r\nher into greater suspicion than, as she hoped, she was aware, or would\r\nbe willing to hear; adding, \"For the love of God, madam, use such\r\nsincerity and prudence in this case, which touches you so nearly, that\r\nall the world may have reason to judge you innocent of so enormous a\r\ncrime; a thing which unless you do, you will be worthily blotted out\r\nfrom the rank of princesses, and rendered, not undeservedly, the\r\nopprobrium of the vulgar; rather than which fate should befal you, I\r\nshould wish you an honorable sepulture instead of a stained life[65].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 65: See the French original in Robertson's \"Hist. of\r\nScotland,\" vol. iii. Append. xix.]\r\n\r\nBut to these and all other representations which could be made to her,\r\nthis criminal and infatuated woman replied by marrying Bothwell three\r\nmonths after the death of her husband. She now attempted by the most\r\nartful sophistries to justify her conduct to the courts of France and\r\nEngland: but vain was the endeavour to excuse or explain away facts\r\nwhich the common sense and common feelings of mankind told them could\r\nadmit of neither explanation nor apology. The nobles conspired, the\r\npeople rose in arms against her; and within a single month after her\r\nill-omened nuptials, she saw her guilty partner compelled to tear\r\nhimself from her arms and seek his safety in flight, and herself reduced\r\nto surrender her person into the power of her rebellious subjects.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Langside put all the power of the country into the hands\r\nof the insurgent nobles; but they were much divided in opinion as to the\r\nuse to be made of their victory. Some wished to restore Mary to regal\r\nauthority under certain limitations;--others wanted to depose her and\r\nproclaim her infant son in her place;--some proposed to detain her in\r\nperpetual imprisonment;--others threatened to bring her to trial and\r\ncapital punishment as an accessary to the death of the king. Meantime\r\nshe was detained a prisoner in Loch Leven castle, subjected to various\r\nindignities, and a prey to the most frightful apprehensions. But there\r\nwas an eye which watched over her for her safety; and it was that of\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nFears and rivalries, ancient offences and recent provocations,--all the\r\nimprudence which she had censured, and all the guilt which she had\r\nimputed, vanished from the thought of this princess the moment that she\r\nbeheld a woman, a kinswoman, and, what was much more, a sister-queen,\r\nreduced to this extremity of distress, and exposed to the menaces and\r\ninsults of her own subjects. For a short time the cause of Mary seemed\r\nto her as her own; she interposed in her behalf in a tone of such\r\nimperative earnestness, that the Scotch nobles, who feared her power and\r\nsought her friendship, did not dare to withstand her; and in all\r\nprobability Mary at this juncture owed no less than her life to the good\r\noffices of her who was destined finally to bring her, with more\r\ninjustice and after many years of sorrow, to an ignominious death.\r\n\r\nIt was not however within the power, if indeed it were the wish, of\r\nElizabeth to restore the queen of Scots to the enjoyment either of\r\nauthority or of freedom. All Scotland seemed at this period united\r\nagainst her; she was compelled to sign a deed of abdication in favor of\r\nher son, who was crowned king in July 1567. The earl of Murray was\r\ndeclared regent: and a parliament assembled about the close of the year\r\nconfirmed all these acts of the confederate lords, and sanctioned the\r\ndetention of the deposed queen in a captivity of which none could then\r\nforesee the termination. Elizabeth ordered her ambassador to abstain\r\nfrom countenancing by his presence the coronation of the king of Scots,\r\nand she continued to negotiate for the restoration of Mary: but her\r\nministers strongly represented to her the danger of driving the lords,\r\nby a further display of her indignation at their proceedings, into a\r\nconfederacy with France; and Throgmorton, her ambassador in Scotland,\r\nurged her to treat with them to deliver their young king into her\r\nhands, in order to his being educated in England.\r\n\r\nSome proposal of this nature she accordingly made: but the lords, whom\r\nformer experience had rendered suspicious of her dealings, absolutely\r\nrefused to give up their prince without the pledge of a recognition of\r\nhis right of succession to the English throne; and Elizabeth, reluctant\r\nas ever to come to a declaration on this point, reluctant also to desert\r\nentirely the interests of Mary, with whose remaining adherents she still\r\nmaintained a secret intercourse, seems to have abstained for some time\r\nfrom any very active interference in the perplexed affairs of the\r\nneighbour kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe recent occurrences in Scotland had procured Elizabeth some respite\r\nfrom the importunities of her subjects relative to the succession; but\r\nit was not the less necessary for her to take some steps in discharge of\r\nher promise respecting marriage. Accordingly the earl of Sussex, in this\r\ncause a negotiator no less zealous than able, was dispatched in solemn\r\nembassy to Vienna, to congratulate the emperor Maximilian on his\r\ncoronation, and at the same time to treat with his brother the archduke\r\nCharles respecting his long agitated marriage with the queen. Two\r\nobstacles were to be surmounted,--the attachment of the archduke to the\r\ncatholic faith, and the repugnance of Elizabeth to enter into\r\nengagements with a prince whose person was unknown to her. Both are\r\nattempted to be obviated in two extant letters from the ambassador to\r\nthe queen, which at the same time so well display the manly spirit of\r\nthe writer, and present details so interesting, that it would be an\r\ninjury to give their more important passages in other language than his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIn the first (dated Vienna, October 1567,) the earl of Sussex acquaints\r\nher majesty with the arrival of the archduke in that city, and his\r\nadmission to a first audience, which was one of ceremony only; after\r\nwhich he thus proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"On Michaelmas day in the afternoon, the emperor rode in his coach to\r\nsee the archduke run at the ring; who commanded me to run at his side,\r\nand my lord North, Mr. Cobham, and Mr. Powel on the other side: And\r\nafter the running was done, he rode on a courser of Naples: and surely\r\nhis highness, in the order of his running, the managing of his horse and\r\nthe manner of his seat, governed himself exceedingly well, and so as, in\r\nmy judgement, it was not to be amended. Since which time I have had\r\ndiverse conferences with the emperor, and with his highness apart, as\r\nwell in times of appointed audience as in several huntings; wherein I\r\nhave viewed, observed, and considered of his person and qualities as\r\nmuch as by any means I might; and have also by good diligence enquired\r\nof his state; and so have thought fit to advertise your majesty what I\r\nconceive of myself, or understand by others, which I trust your majesty\r\nshall find to be true in all respects.\r\n\r\n\"His highness is of a person higher surely a good deal than my lord\r\nmarquis; his hair and beard of a light auburn; his face well\r\nproportioned, amiable, and of a good complexion, without show of\r\nredness, or over paleness; his countenance and speech cheerful, very\r\ncourteous, and not without some state; his body well shaped, without\r\ndeformity or blemish: his hands very good and fair; his legs clean, well\r\nproportioned, and of sufficient bigness for his stature; his foot as\r\ngood as may be.\r\n\r\n\"So as, upon my duty to your majesty, I find not one deformity,\r\nmis-shape, or any thing to be noted worthy disliking in his whole\r\nperson; but contrariwise, I find his whole shape to be good, worthy\r\ncommendation and liking in all respects, and such as is rarely to be\r\nfound in such a prince.\r\n\r\n\"His highness, besides his natural language of Dutch, speaketh very well\r\nSpanish and Italian, and, as I hear, Latin. His dealings with me be very\r\nwise; his conversation such as much contenteth me; and, as I hear, none\r\nreturneth discontented from his company. He is greatly beloved here of\r\nall men: the chiefest gallants of these parts be his men, and follow his\r\ncourt; the most of them have travelled other countries, speak many\r\nlanguages, and behave themselves thereafter; and truly we cannot be so\r\nglad there to have him come to us, as they will be sad here to have him\r\ngo from them. He is reported to be wise, liberal, valiant, and of great\r\ncourage, which in the last wars he well showed, in defending all his\r\ncountries free from the Turk with his own force only, and giving them\r\ndivers overthrows when they attempted any thing against his rules; and\r\nhe is universally (which I most weigh) noted to be of such virtue as he\r\nwas never spotted or touched with any notable vice of crime, which is\r\nmuch in a prince of his years, endued with such qualities. He\r\ndelighteth much in hunting, riding, hawking, exercise of feats of arms,\r\nand hearing of music, whereof he hath very good. He hath, as I hear,\r\nsome understanding in astronomy and cosmography, and taketh pleasure in\r\nclocks that set forth the course of the planets.\r\n\r\n\"He hath for his portion the countries of Styria, Carinthia, Friola,\r\nTreiste, and Histria, and hath the government of that is left in\r\nCroatia, wherein, as I hear, he may ride without entering into any other\r\nman's territories, near three hundred miles... surely he is a great\r\nprince in subjects, territories, and revenues; and liveth in great honor\r\nand state, with such a court as he that seeth it will say is fit for a\r\ngreat prince.\" &c. On October 26th he writes thus:--\"Since the writing\r\nof my other letters, upon the resolution of the emperor and the\r\narchduke, I took occasion to go to the archduke, meaning to sound him to\r\nthe bottom in all causes, and to feel whether such matter as he had\r\nuttered to me before (contained in my other letters) proceeded from him\r\n_bona fide_, or were but words of form.... After some ordinary speech,\r\nused to minister occasion, I began after this sort. 'Sir, I see it is a\r\ngreat matter to deal in the marriage of princes; and therefore it is\r\nconvenient for me, that by the queen my mistress' order intermeddle in\r\nthis negotiation, to foresee that I neither deceive you, be deceived\r\nmyself, nor, by my ignorance, be the cause that she be deceived; in\r\nrespect whereof, I beseech your highness to give me leave to treat as\r\nfrankly with you in all things, now I am here, as it pleased her\r\nmajesty to give me leave to deal with her before my coming from thence;\r\nwhereby I may be as well assured of your disposition, upon your assured\r\nword, as I was of hers upon her word, and so proceed in all things\r\nthereafter:' Whereunto his highness answered me that he thanked me for\r\nthat kind of dealing, and he would truly utter to me what he thought and\r\nmeant in all things that I should demand; which upon his word he willed\r\nme to credit, and I should not be abused myself, nor abuse your majesty.\r\nI then said that (your licence granted) I was bold humbly to beseech\r\nyour majesty to let me understand your inward disposition in this cause;\r\nand whether you meant a lingering entertaining of the matter, or a\r\ndirect proceeding to bring it to a good end, with a determination to\r\nconsummate the marriage if conveniently you might; whereupon your\r\nmajesty not only used such speeches to me as did satisfy me of your\r\nplain and good meaning to proceed in this matter without delay, if by\r\nconvenient means you might, but also gave me in commission to affirm,\r\nupon your word, to the emperor, that ye had resolved to marry. Ye were\r\nfree to marry where God should put it in your heart to like; and you had\r\ngiven no grateful ear to any motion of marriage but to this, although\r\nyou had received sundry great offers from others; and therefore your\r\nmajesty by your letters, and I by your commandment, had desired of his\r\nmajesty some determinate resolution whereby the matter might one ways or\r\nanother grow to an end with both your honors; the like whereof I had\r\nalso said to his highness before, and did now repeat it. And for that\r\nhis highness had given me the like licence. I would be as bold with him\r\nas I had been with your majesty; and therefore beseeched him to let me,\r\nupon his honor, understand whether he earnestly desired, for love of\r\nyour person, the good success and end of this cause, and had determined\r\nin his heart upon this marriage; or else, to satisfy others that\r\nprocured him thereto, was content to entertain the matter, and cared not\r\nwhat became thereof; that I also might deal thereafter; for in the one I\r\nwould serve your majesty and him truly, and in the other, I was no\r\nperson of quality to be a convenient minister.\r\n\r\n\"His highness answered, 'Count, I have heard by the emperor of the order\r\nof your dealing with him, and I have had dealings with you myself,\r\nwherewith he and I rest very well contented; but truly I never rested\r\nmore contented of any thing than I do of this dealing, wherein, besides\r\nyour duty to her that hath trusted you, you show what you be yourself,\r\nfor the which I honor you as you be worthy;' (pardon me, I beseech your\r\nmajesty, in writing the words he spake of myself, for they serve to\r\nutter his natural disposition and inclination.) 'and although I have\r\nalways had a good hope of the queen's honorable dealing in this matter,\r\nyet I have heard so much of her not meaning to marry, as might give me\r\ncause to suspect the worst; but understanding by the emperor of your\r\nmanner of dealing with him, perceiving that I do presently by your\r\nwords, I think myself bound' (wherewith he put off his cap) 'to honor,\r\nlove, and serve her majesty while I live, and will firmly credit that\r\nyou on her majesty's behalf have said: and therefore, so I might hope\r\nher majesty would bear with me for my conscience, I know not that thing\r\nin the world that I would refuse to do at her commandment: And surely I\r\nhave from the beginning of this matter settled my heart upon her, and\r\nnever thought of other wife, if she would think me worthy to be her\r\nhusband; and therefore be bold to inform her majesty truly herein, for I\r\nwill not fail of my part in any thing, as I trust sufficiently appeareth\r\nto you by that I have heretofore said.'\r\n\r\n\"I thanked his highness of his frank dealing, wherein I would believe\r\nhim and deal thereafter, 'And now I am satisfied in this, I beseech your\r\nhighness satisfy me also in another matter, and bear with me though I be\r\nsomewhat busy, for I mean it for the best. I have many times heard of\r\nmen of good judgement and friends to this cause, that as the emperor's\r\nmajesty, being in disposition of the Augustan confession, hath been\r\nforced in these great wars of the Turk to temporise in respect of\r\nChristendom; so your highness, being of his mind inwardly, hath also\r\nupon good policy forborne to discover yourself until you might see some\r\nend of your own causes; and expecting, by marriage or other means, a\r\nsettling of yourself in further advancement of state than your own\r\npatrimony, you temporise until you see on which side your lot will fall;\r\nand if you find you shall settle in this marriage, ye will, when ye are\r\nsure thereof, discover what ye be. If this be true, trust me, sir, I\r\nbeseech you, and I will not betray you, and let me know the secret of\r\nyour heart, whereby you may grow to a shorter end of your desire; and as\r\nI will upon my oath assure you, I will never utter your counsel to any\r\nperson living but to the queen my mistress, so do I deliver unto you her\r\npromise upon her honor not to utter it to any person without your\r\nconsent; and if you will not trust me herein, commit it to her majesty's\r\ntrust by your own letters or messenger of trust, and she will not\r\ndeceive you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Surely,' said his highness, 'whoever hath said this of me to the\r\nqueen's majesty, or to you, or to any other, hath said more than he\r\nknoweth, God grant he meant well therein. My ancestors have always\r\nholden this religion that I hold, and I never knew other, and therefore\r\nI never could have mind hitherto to change; and I trust, when her\r\nmajesty shall consider my case well, my determination herein shall not\r\nhurt me towards her in this cause. For, count,' said he, 'how could you\r\nwith reason give me counsel to be the first of my race that so suddenly\r\nshould change the religion that all my ancestors have so long holden\r\nwhen I know no other; or how can the queen like of me in any other\r\nthing, that should be so light in changing of my conscience? Where on\r\nthe other side, in knowing my duty constantly to God for conscience, I\r\nhave great hope that her majesty, with good reason, will conceive that I\r\nwill be the more faithful and constant to her in all that honor and\r\nconscience bindeth. And therefore I will myself crave of her majesty, by\r\nmy letters, her granting of this my only request; and I pray you with\r\nall my heart to further it in all you may; and shrink not to assure her\r\nmajesty, that if she satisfy me in this, I will never slack to serve and\r\nsatisfy her, while I live, in all the rest.'\r\n\r\n\"In such like talk, to this effect, his highness spent almost two hours\r\nwith me, which I thought my duty to advertise your majesty; and hereupon\r\nI gather that reputation ruleth him much for the present in this case of\r\nreligion, and that if God couple you together in liking, you shall have\r\nof him a true husband, a loving companion, a wise counsellor and a\r\nfaithful servant; and we shall have as virtuous a prince as ever ruled:\r\nGod grant (though you be worthy a great deal better than he, if he were\r\nto be found) that our wickedness be not such as we be unworthy of him,\r\nor of such as he is.[66]\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Note 66: Lodge's \"Illustrations,\" vol. i.]\r\n\r\nIt may be matter as much of surprise as regret to the reader of these\r\nletters, that a negotiation should have failed of success, which the\r\nmanly plainness of the envoy on one hand and the honourable unreserve of\r\nthe prince on the other had so quickly freed from the customary\r\nintricacies of diplomatic transactions. Religion furnished, to\r\nappearance, the only objection which could be urged against the union;\r\nand on this head the archduke would have been satisfied with terms the\r\nleast favorable to himself that could be devised. He only stipulated for\r\nthe performance of Catholic worship in a private room of the palace, at\r\nwhich none but himself and such servants of his own persuasion as he\r\nshould bring with him should have permission to attend. He consented\r\nregularly to accompany the queen to the services of the church of\r\nEngland, and for a time to intermit the exercise of his own religion\r\nshould any disputes arise; and he engaged that neither he nor his\r\nattendants should in any manner contravene, or give countenance to such\r\nas contravened, the established religion of the country. In short, he\r\nasked no greater indulgence on this head than what was granted without\r\nscruple to the ambassadors of Catholic powers. But even this, it was\r\naffirmed, was more than the queen could with safety concede; and on this\r\nground the treaty was finally closed.\r\n\r\nThere is great room, however, to suspect that the real and the\r\nostensible reasons of the failure of this marriage were by no means the\r\nsame. It could scarcely have been expected or hoped that a prince of the\r\nhouse of Austria would consent to desert the religion of his ancestors,\r\nwhich he must have regarded himself as pledged by the honor of his birth\r\nto maintain; and without deserting it he could not go beyond the terms\r\nwhich Charles actually offered. This religion, as a system of faith and\r\nworship, was by no means regarded by Elizabeth with such abhorrence as\r\nwould render it irksome to her to grant it toleration in a husband,\r\nthough on political grounds she forbade under heavy penalties its\r\nexercise to her subjects. It is true that to the puritans the smallest\r\ndegree of indulgence to its idolatrous rites appeared a heinous sin, and\r\nfrom them the Austrian match would have had to encounter all the\r\nopposition that could prudently be made by a sect itself obnoxious to\r\nthe rod of persecution. The duke of Norfolk is said to have given great\r\noffence to this party, with which he was usually disposed to act, by the\r\ncordial approbation which he was induced, probably by his friendship for\r\nthe earl of Sussex, to bestow on this measure. Leicester is believed to\r\nhave thwarted the negotiations by means of one of his creatures, for\r\nwhom he had procured the second rank in the embassy of the earl of\r\nSussex; he also labored in person to fill the mind of the queen with\r\nfears and scruples respecting it. But it is probable that, after all,\r\nthe chief difficulty lay in Elizabeth's settled aversion to the married\r\nstate; and notwithstanding all her professions to her ambassador, the\r\nknown dissimulation of her character permits us to believe, not only\r\nthat small obstacles were found sufficient to divert her from\r\naccomplishing the union which she pretended to have at heart; but that\r\nfrom the very beginning she was insincere, and that not even the total\r\nsacrifice of his religion would have exempted her suitor from final\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe decease of sir Richard Sackville in 1566 called his son, the\r\naccomplished poet, to the inheritance of a noble fortune, and opened to\r\nhim the career of public life. At the time of his father's death he was\r\npursuing his travels through France and Italy, and had been subjected to\r\na short imprisonment in Rome, \"which trouble,\" says his eulogist, \"was\r\nbrought upon him by some who hated him for his love to religion and his\r\nduty to his sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately on his return to his native country the duke of Norfolk, by\r\nthe queen's command, conferred upon him the honor of knighthood, and on\r\nthe same day he was advanced by her to the degree of a baron by the\r\nstyle of lord Buckhurst. The new peer immediately shone forth one of the\r\nbrightest ornaments of the court: but carried away by the ardor of his\r\nimagination, he plunged so deeply into the expensive pleasures of the\r\nage as seriously to injure his fortune, and in part his credit: timely\r\nreflection however, added, it is said, to the counsels of his royal\r\nkinswoman, cured him of the foible of profusion, and he lived not only\r\nto retrieve, but to augment his patrimony to a vast amount.\r\n\r\nAmid the factions of the court, lord Buckhurst, almost alone, preserved\r\na dignified neutrality, resting his claims to consideration and\r\ninfluence not on the arts of intrigue, but on his talents, his merit,\r\nhis extensive possessions, and his interest in his royal kinswoman.\r\nLeicester was jealous of his approach, as of that of every man of honor\r\nwho affected an independence on his support; but it was not till many\r\nyears afterwards, and on an occasion in which his own reputation and\r\nsafety were at stake, that the wily favorite ventured a direct attack\r\nupon the credit of lord Buckhurst. At present they preserved towards\r\neach other those exteriors of consideration and respect which in the\r\nworld, and especially at courts, are found so perfectly compatible with\r\nfear, hatred, or contempt.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, that in one of her majesty's summer progresses\r\nan incident occurred which the painter or the poet might seize and\r\nembellish.\r\n\r\nPassing through Northamptonshire, she stopped to visit her royal castle\r\nof Fotheringay, then, or soon after, committed by her to the keeping of\r\nsir William Fitzwilliam several times lord-deputy of Ireland. The castle\r\nwas at this time entire and magnificent, and must have been viewed by\r\nElizabeth with sentiments of family pride. It was erected by her remote\r\nprogenitor Edmund of Langley, son of king Edward III. and founder of the\r\nhouse of York. By his directions the keep was built in the likeness of a\r\nfetter-lock, the well known cognisance of that line, and in the windows\r\nthe same symbol with its attendant falcon was repeatedly and\r\nconspicuously emblazoned. From Edmund of Langley it descended to his son\r\nEdward duke of York, slain in the field of Agincourt, and next to the\r\nson of his unfortunate brother the decapitated earl of Cambridge; to\r\nthat Richard who fell at Wakefield in the attempt to assert his title to\r\nthe crown, which the victorious arms of his son Edward IV. afterwards\r\nvindicated to himself and his posterity.\r\n\r\nIn a collegiate church adjoining were deposited the remains of Edward\r\nand Richard dukes of York, and of Cecily wife to the latter, who\r\nsurvived to behold so many bloody deeds of which her children were the\r\nperpetrators or the victims. Elizabeth, attended by all the pomp of\r\nroyalty, proceeded to visit the spot of her ancestors' interment: but\r\nwhat was her indignation and surprise on discovering, that the splendid\r\ntombs which had once risen to their memory, had been involved in the\r\nsame destruction with the college itself, of which the rapacious\r\nNorthumberland had obtained a grant from Edward VI., and that scarcely\r\na stone remained to protect the dust of these descendants and\r\nprogenitors of kings! She instantly gave orders for the erection of\r\nsuitable monuments to their honor: but her commands were ill obeyed, and\r\na few miserable plaster figures were all that the illustrious dead\r\nobtained at last from her pride or her piety. These monuments however,\r\nsuch as they are, remain to posterity, whilst of the magnificent castle,\r\nthe only adequate commemoration of the power and greatness of its\r\npossessors, one stone is not left upon another:--it was levelled with\r\nthe ground by order of James I., that not a vestige might remain of the\r\nlast prison of his unhappy mother, the fatal scene of her trial,\r\ncondemnation, and ignominious death.\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1567 had left the queen of Scots a prisoner in\r\nLochleven-castle, her infant son declared king, and the regent\r\nMurray,--a man of vigor, prudence, and in the main of virtue,--holding\r\nthe reins with a firm hand. For the peace and welfare of Scotland, for\r\nthe security of reformed religion, and for the ends of that moral\r\nretribution from which the crimes and vices of the rulers of mankind\r\nought least of all to be exempt, nothing could be more desirable than\r\nthat such a state of things should become permanent, by the acquiescence\r\nof the potentates of Europe, and of that powerful aristocracy which in\r\nScotland was unhappily superior to the whole force of the laws and the\r\nconstitution. But for its destruction many interests, many passions and\r\nprejudices conspired. It was rather against Bothwell than against the\r\nqueen that many of the nobles had taken arms; and more favorable terms\r\nwould at first have been granted her, could she have been brought to\r\nconsent as a preliminary to divorce and banish him for ever from her\r\npresence. The flight of Bothwell and the prolongation of her own\r\ncaptivity had subdued her obstinacy on this point: it was understood\r\nthat she was now willing that her marriage should be dissolved, and this\r\nconcession alone sufficed to bring her many partisans. Sentiments of\r\npity began to arise in favor of an unfortunate queen and beauty, and to\r\ncause her crimes to be extenuated or forgotten. All the catholics in\r\nScotland were her earnest friends, and the foreign princes of the same\r\npersuasion were unceasingly stimulating them to act openly in her\r\nbehalf. With these Elizabeth, either by her zeal for the common cause of\r\nsovereigns, or by some treacherous designs of her own, was brought into\r\nmost preposterous conjunction, and she had actually proposed to the\r\ncourt of France that they should by joint consent cut off all\r\ncommunication with Scotland till the queen should be reinstated. The\r\nhaughty and unconciliating temper of Murray had embittered the animosity\r\nentertained against him by several nobles of the blood-royal, each of\r\nwhom regarded himself as the person best entitled to the office of\r\nregent; and an insurrection against his authority was already in\r\ncontemplation, when Mary, having by her promises and blandishments\r\nbribed an unthinking youth to effect her liberation, suddenly reappeared\r\nin readiness to put herself at the head of such of her countrymen as\r\nstill owned her allegiance.\r\n\r\nSeveral leading nobles flocked hastily to her standard; a bond was\r\nentered into for her defence, and in a few days she saw herself at the\r\nhead of six thousand men. Elizabeth made her an immediate offer of\r\ntroops and succour, stipulating however, from a prudent jealousy of the\r\nFrench, that no foreign forces should be admitted into Scotland; and\r\nfurther, that all disputes between Mary and her subjects should be\r\nsubmitted to her arbitration.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Scotland, though disastrously for the future days of\r\nMary and the fame of Elizabeth, this formidable rising in favor of the\r\ndeposed sovereign was crushed at a single blow. Murray, with inferior\r\nforces, marched courageously against the queen, gained a complete and\r\neasy victory, and compelled her to a hasty flight.\r\n\r\nAccompanied only by a few attendants, the defeated princess reached the\r\nEnglish border. What should she do? Behind her was the hostile army,\r\nacting in the name of her son to whom she had signed an abdication of\r\nthe throne, in virtue of which her late attempt to reinstate herself\r\nmight lawfully be visited with the rigors of perpetual imprisonment, or\r\neven with death itself.\r\n\r\nBefore her lay the dominions of a princess whose titles she had once\r\nusurped, and whose government she had never ceased to molest by her\r\nintrigues,--of one who had hated her as a competitor in power and in\r\nbeauty,--as an enemy in religion, and most of all as the heiress of her\r\ncrown. But this very princess had interfered, generously interfered, to\r\nsave her life; she had shown herself touched by her situation; she had\r\noffered her, under certain conditions, succours and protection. Perhaps\r\nshe would no longer remember in the suppliant who embraced her knees,\r\nthe haughty rival who had laid claim to her crown;--perhaps she would\r\nshow herself a real friend. The English people too,--could they behold\r\nunmoved \"a queen, a beauty,\" hurled from her throne, chased from her\r\ncountry by the rude hands of her rebellious subjects, and driven to\r\nimplore their aid? No surely,--ten thousand swords would spring from\r\ntheir scabbards to avenge her injuries;--so she hoped, so she reasoned;\r\nfor merited misfortune had not yet impaired her courage or abated her\r\nconfidence, nor had the sense of guilt impressed upon her mind one\r\nlesson of humility. Her situation, also, admitted of no other\r\nalternative than to confide herself to Elizabeth or surrender to\r\nMurray,--a step not to be thought of. Time pressed; fear urged; and\r\nresolved to throw herself at the feet of her kinswoman, she crossed,\r\nnever to return, the Rubicon of her destiny. A common fishing-boat, the\r\nonly vessel that could be procured, landed her on May 16th 1568, with\r\nabout twenty attendants, at Workington in Cumberland, whence she was\r\nconducted with every mark of respect to Carlisle-castle; and from this\r\nasylum she instantly addressed to Elizabeth a long letter, relating her\r\nfresh reverse of fortune, complaining of the injuries which she had\r\nreceived at the hands of her subjects, and earnestly imploring her favor\r\nand protection.\r\n\r\nWith what feelings this important letter was received it would be\r\ndeeply interesting to inquire, were there any possibility of arriving at\r\nthe knowledge of a thing so secret. If indeed the professions of\r\nfriendship and offers of effectual aid lavished by Elizabeth upon Mary\r\nduring the period of her captivity, were nothing else than a series of\r\nstratagems by which she sought to draw an unwary victim within her\r\ntoils, and to wreak on her the vengeance of an envious temper and\r\nunpitying heart, we might now imagine her exulting in the success of her\r\nwiles, and smiling over the atrocious perfidy which she was about to\r\ncommit. If, on the other hand, we judge these demonstrations to have\r\nbeen at the time sincere, and believe that Elizabeth, though profoundly\r\nsensible of Mary's misconduct, was yet anxious to save her from the\r\nsevere retribution which her exasperated subjects had taken upon them to\r\nexact, we must imagine her whole soul agitated at this crisis by a crowd\r\nof conflicting thoughts and adverse passions.\r\n\r\nIn the first moments, sympathy for an unhappy queen, and the intuitive\r\nsense of generosity and honor, would urge her to fulfil every promise,\r\nto satisfy or surpass every hope which her conduct had excited. But soon\r\nthe mingled suggestions of female honor, of policy, of caution, uniting\r\nwith the sentiment of habitual enmity, would arise, first to moderate,\r\nthen to extinguish, her ardor in the cause of her supplicant. Further\r\nreflection, enforced perhaps by the reasonings of her most trusted\r\ncounsellors, would serve to display in tempting colors the advantages to\r\nbe taken of the now defenceless condition of a competitor once\r\nformidable and always odious; and gradually, but not easily, not without\r\nreluctance and shame and secret pangs of compunction, she would suffer\r\nthe temptation,--one, it must be confessed, of no common force and aided\r\nby pleas of public utility not a little plausible,--to become victorious\r\nover her first thoughts, her better feelings, her more virtuous\r\nresolves. For the honor of human nature, it may be believed that the\r\nlatter state of feeling must have been that experienced by a princess\r\nwhose life had been as yet unsullied by any considerable violations of\r\nfaith, justice, or humanity: but it must not escape remark, that the\r\nfirst steps taken by her in this business were strong, decided in their\r\ncharacter, and almost irretrievable.\r\n\r\nLady Scrope, sister of the duke of Norfolk, was indeed sent to attend\r\nthe illustrious stranger at Carlisle, and lord Scrope warden of the west\r\nmarches and sir Francis Knolles the vice-chamberlain were soon after\r\ndispatched thither with letters for her of kind condolence: but when\r\nMary applied to these persons for permission to visit their queen, they\r\nreplied, that, until she should have cleared herself of the shocking\r\nimputation of her husband's murder, public decorum and her own\r\nreputation must preclude a princess so nearly related to the late king\r\nof Scots from receiving her into her presence. That it was however with\r\nregret that their mistress admitted this delay; and as soon as the queen\r\nof Scots should have vindicated herself on this point, they were\r\nempowered to promise her a reception suited at once to a sovereign and a\r\nkinswoman in distress.\r\n\r\nHad not Elizabeth previously committed herself in some degree by\r\ninterference in behalf of Mary, and by promises to her of support, no\r\none could reasonably have blamed the caution or the coldness of this\r\nreply to a request, which, under all the circumstances, might justly be\r\ntaxed with effrontery. But in the judgement of Mary and her friends, and\r\nperhaps even of more impartial judges, the part already taken by\r\nElizabeth had deprived her of the right of recurring to former events as\r\na plea for the exclusion of the queen of Scots from her presence and\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nTears of grief and anger burst from the eyes of Mary on this unexpected\r\ncheck, which struck her heart with the most melancholy forebodings; but\r\naware of the necessity of disguising fears which would pass for an\r\nevidence of guilt, she hastily replied, that she was willing to submit\r\nher whole conduct to the judgement of the queen her sister, and did not\r\ndoubt of being able to produce such proofs of her innocence as would\r\nsatisfy her and confound her enemies.\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Elizabeth: she was now constituted umpire between\r\nthe queen of Scots and her subjects, and the future fate of both might\r\nbe said to lie in her hands; in the mean time she had gained a pretext\r\nfor treating as a culprit the party who had appealed to her tribunal. We\r\nlearn that lord Scrope and sir Francis Knolles had from the first\r\nreceived secret instructions not only to watch the motions of Mary, but\r\nto prevent her departure; her person had also been surrounded with\r\nsentinels under the semblance of a guard of honor. But hitherto these\r\nmeasures of precaution had probably remained concealed from their\r\nobject; they were now gradually replaced by others of a more open and\r\ndecided character, and it was not much longer permitted to the hapless\r\nfugitive to doubt the dismal truth, that she was once more a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at her situation, and secretly conscious how ill her conduct\r\nwould stand the test of judicial inquiry, Mary no sooner learned that\r\nElizabeth had actually named commissioners to hear the pleadings on both\r\nsides, and written to summon the regent to produce before them whatever\r\nhe could bring in justification of his conduct towards his sovereign,\r\nthan she hastened to retract her former unwary concession.\r\n\r\nIn a letter full of impotent indignation, assumed majesty and real\r\ndismay, she now sought to explain away or evade her late appeal. She\r\nrepeated her demand of admission to the presence of Elizabeth, refused\r\nto compromise her royal dignity by submitting to a trial in which her\r\nown subjects were to appear as parties against her, and ended by\r\nrequiring that the queen would either furnish her with that assistance\r\nwhich it behoved her more than any one to grant, or would suffer her to\r\nseek the aid of other princes whose delicacy on this head would be less,\r\nor their resentment of her wrongs greater. This last proposal might have\r\nsuggested to Elizabeth the safest, easiest, and most honorable mode of\r\nextricating herself from the dilemma in which, by further intermeddling\r\nin the concerns of Scotland, she was likely to become involved. Happy\r\nwould it have been for her credit and her peace of mind, had she\r\nsuffered her perplexing guest to depart and seek for partisans and\r\navengers elsewhere! But her pride of superiority and love of sway were\r\nflattered by the idea of arbitrating in so great a cause; her secret\r\nmalignity enjoyed the humiliation of her enemy; and her characteristic\r\ncaution represented to her in formidable colors the danger of restoring\r\nto liberty one whom she had already offended beyond forgiveness. She\r\nlaid Mary's letter before her privy-council; and these confidential\r\nadvisers, after wisely and uprightly deciding that it would be\r\ninconsistent with the honor and safety of the queen and her government\r\nto undertake the restoration of the queen of Scots, were induced to add,\r\nthat it would also be unsafe to permit her departure out of the kingdom,\r\nand that the inquiry into her conduct ought to be pursued.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her remonstrances, Mary was immediately removed to\r\nBolton-castle in Yorkshire, a seat of lord Scrope's; her communications\r\nwith her own country were cut off; her confinement was rendered more\r\nstrict; and by secret promises from Elizabeth of finally causing her to\r\nbe restored to her throne under certain limitations, she was led to\r\nrenew her consent to the trial of her cause in England, and to engage\r\nherself to name commissioners to confer with those of the regent and of\r\nElizabeth at York.\r\n\r\nIt would be foreign from the purpose of the present work to engage in a\r\nregular narrative of the celebrated proceedings begun soon after at the\r\ncity last mentioned, and ended at Westminster: some remarkable\r\ncircumstances illustrative of the character of the English princess, or\r\nconnected with the fate of her principal noble, will however be related\r\nhereafter, as well as their final result;--at present other subjects\r\nclaim attention.\r\n\r\nAn embassy arrived in London in 1567, from Ivan Basilowitz czar of\r\nMuscovy, the second which had been addressed to an English sovereign\r\nfrom that country, plunged as yet in barbarous ignorance, and far from\r\nanticipating the day when it should assume a distinguished station in\r\nthe system of civilized Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was by a bold and extraordinary enterprise that the barrier of the\r\nFrozen Sea had been burst, and a channel of communication opened between\r\nthis country and Russia by means of which an intercourse highly\r\nbeneficial to both nations was now begun: the leading circumstances were\r\nthe following.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VII., just after the unparalleled achievement\r\nof Columbus had rendered voyages of discovery the ruling passion of\r\nEurope, a Venetian pilot, named Cabot, who had resided long in Bristol,\r\nobtained from this monarch for himself and his sons a patent for making\r\ndiscoveries and conquests in unknown regions. By this navigator and his\r\nson Sebastian, Newfoundland was soon after discovered; and by Sebastian\r\nafter his father's death a long series of maritime enterprises were\r\nsubsequently undertaken with various success. For many years he was in\r\nthe service of Spain; but returning to England at the close of Henry the\r\neighth's reign, he was received with merited favor at court. Young king\r\nEdward listened with eagerness to the relations of the aged navigator;\r\nand touched by the unquenchable ardor of discovery which still burned in\r\nthe bosom of this contemporary and rival of Columbus, granted with\r\nalacrity his royal license for the fitting out of three ships to explore\r\na north passage to the East Indies. The instructions for this voyage\r\nwere drawn up in a masterly manner by Cabot himself, and the command of\r\nthe expedition was given to sir Hugh Willoughby, and under him to\r\nRichard Chancellor, a gentleman who had long been attached to the\r\nservice of the excellent sir Henry Sidney, by whom he was recommended to\r\nthis appointment in the warmest terms of affection and esteem.\r\n\r\nThe ships were separated by a tempest off the Norwegian coast; and\r\nWilloughby, having encountered much foul weather and judging the season\r\ntoo far advanced to proceed on so hazardous a voyage, laid up his vessel\r\nin a bay on the shore of Lapland, with the purpose of awaiting the\r\nreturn of spring. But such was the rigor of the season on this bleak and\r\ninhospitable coast, that the admiral and his whole crew were frozen to\r\ndeath in their cabin. Chancellor in the mean time, by dint of superior\r\nsailing, was enabled to surmount the perils of the way. He doubled the\r\nNorth Cape, a limit never passed by English keel before, and still\r\nproceeding eastward, found entrance into an unknown gulf, which proved\r\nto be the White Sea, and dropped anchor at length in the port of\r\nArchangel.\r\n\r\nThe rude natives were surprised and terrified by the appearance of a\r\nstrange vessel much superior in size to any which they had before\r\nbeheld; but after a time, venturing on an intercourse with the\r\nnavigators, they acquainted them, that they were subjects of the czar of\r\nMuscovy, and that they had sent to apprize him of so extraordinary an\r\narrival. On the return of the messenger, Chancellor received an\r\ninvitation to visit the court of Moscow. The czar, barbarian as he was\r\nin manners and habits, possessed however strong sense and an inquiring\r\nmind; he had formed great projects for the improvement of his empire,\r\nand he was immediately and fully aware of the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom a direct communication by sea with a people capable of supplying\r\nhis country with most of the commodities which it now received from the\r\nsouthern nations of Europe by a tedious and expensive land-carriage. He\r\naccordingly welcomed the Englishmen with distinguished honors; returned\r\na favorable answer to the letter from king Edward of which they were the\r\nbearers, and expressed his willingness to enter into commercial\r\nrelations with their country, and to receive an ambassador from their\r\nsovereign. Edward did not live to learn the prosperous success of this\r\npart of the expedition, but fortunately his successor extended equal\r\nencouragement to the enterprise. A Russia company was formed, of which\r\nthe veteran Sebastian Cabot was made governor, and Chancellor was\r\ndispatched on a second voyage, charged with further instructions for the\r\nsettlement of a commercial treaty. His voyage was again safe and\r\nprosperous, and he was accompanied on his return by a Russian\r\nambassador; but off the coast of Scotland the ship was unhappily\r\nwrecked, and Chancellor with several other persons was drowned; the\r\nambassador himself reaching the land with much difficulty. The vessel\r\nwas plundered of her whole cargo by the neighbouring peasantry; but the\r\nambassador and his train were hospitably entertained by the queen-regent\r\nof Scotland, and forwarded on their way to London, where their grotesque\r\nfigures and the barbaric pomp of their dress and equipage astonished the\r\ncourt and city.\r\n\r\nThe present embassy, which reached its destination without accident, was\r\none of greater importance, and appeared with superior dignity. It\r\nconveyed to the queen, besides all verbal assurances of the friendship\r\nof the czar, a magnificent present of the richest furs, and other\r\narticles of great rarity; and the ambassadors had it in charge to\r\nconclude a treaty of amity and commerce, of which the terms proved\r\nhighly advantageous for England. They were accompanied by an Englishman\r\nnamed Jenkinson, who had been sent out several years before, by the\r\nRussia company, to explore the southern and eastern limits of that vast\r\nempire, and to endeavour to open an overland trade with Persia. By the\r\nassistance of the czar he had succeeded in this object, and was the\r\nfirst Englishman who ever sailed upon the Caspian, or travelled over the\r\nwild region which lies beyond. In return for all favors, he had now\r\nundertaken on behalf of the czar to propose to his own sovereign certain\r\nsecret articles in which this prince was more deeply interested than in\r\nany commercial matters, and which he deemed it unsafe to commit to the\r\nfidelity or discretion of his own ambassadors.\r\n\r\nIvan, partly by a marked preference shown to foreigners, which his own\r\nbarbarians could not forgive, partly by his many acts of violence and\r\ncruelty, had highly incensed his subjects against him. In the preceding\r\nyear, a violent insurrection had nearly hurled him from the throne; and\r\nstill apprehensive of some impending disaster, he now proposed to the\r\nqueen of England a league offensive and defensive, of which he was\r\nanxious to make it an article, that she should bind herself by oath to\r\ngrant a kind and honorable reception in her dominions to himself, his\r\nwife and children, should any untoward event compel them to quit their\r\ncountry. But that never-failing caution which, in all the complication\r\nand diversity of her connexions with foreign powers, withheld Elizabeth\r\nfrom ever, in a single instance, committing herself beyond the power of\r\nretreat, caused her to waive compliance with the extraordinary proposal\r\nof Ivan. She entertained his ambassadors however with the utmost\r\ncordiality, gratified his wishes in every point where prudence would\r\npermit, and finally succeeded, by the adroitness of her management, in\r\nsecuring for her country, without sacrifice or hazard on her own part,\r\nevery real benefit which an intercourse with such a people and such a\r\nsovereign appeared capable of affording. To have come off with advantage\r\nin a trial of diplomatic skill with a barbarous czar of Muscovy, was\r\nhowever an exploit of which a civilized politician would be ashamed to\r\nboast,--on him no glory could be won,--and we may imagine Elizabeth\r\nturning from him with a kind of disdain to an antagonist more worthy of\r\nher talents.\r\n\r\nThe king and court of France were at this time subjected to the guidance\r\nof the execrable Catherine dei Medici. To this woman the religious\r\ndifferences which then agitated Europe were in themselves perfectly\r\nindifferent, and on more than one occasion she had allowed it to be\r\nperceived that they were so: but a close and dispassionate study of the\r\nstate of parties in her son's kingdom, had at length convinced her that\r\nit was necessary to the establishment of his authority and her own\r\nconsequence, that the Hugonot faction should be crushed, and she stood\r\nsecretly prepared and resolved to procure the accomplishment of this\r\nobject by measures of perfidy and atrocity from which bigotry itself, in\r\na mind not totally depraved, must have revolted.\r\n\r\nBy the secret league of Bayonne, the courts of France and Spain had\r\npledged themselves to pursue in concert the great work of the\r\nextirpation of heresy; and while Catherine was laying hidden trains for\r\nthe destruction of the Hugonots, Philip II., by measures of open force\r\nand relentless cruelty, was striving to annihilate the protestants of\r\nthe Low Countries, and to impose upon those devoted provinces the\r\ndetested yoke of the inquisition.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was aware of all that was going on; and she well knew that\r\nwhen once these worthy associates had succeeded in crushing the\r\nreformation in their own dominions, Scotland and England would become\r\nthe immediate theatre of their operations. Already were the catholics of\r\nthe two countries privately encouraged to rely on them for support, and\r\nincited to aid the common cause by giving all the disturbance in their\r\npower to their respective governments.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of policy therefore, no less than of religion, moved her\r\nto afford such succours, first to the French protestants and afterwards\r\nto the Flemings, as might enable them to prolong at least the contest;\r\nbut her caution and her frugality conspired to restrain her from\r\ninvolving herself in actual warfare for the defence of either. At the\r\nvery time therefore that she was secretly supplying the Hugonots with\r\nmoney and giving them assurances of her support, she was more than ever\r\nattentive to preserve all the exteriors of friendship with the court of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIt suited the views of the queen-mother to receive with complacency and\r\nencouragement the dissembling professions of Elizabeth; by which she was\r\nnot herself deceived, but which served to deceive and to alarm her\r\nenemies the protestants, and in some measure to mask her designs against\r\nthem. We have seen what high civilities had passed between the courts on\r\noccasion of the admission of the French king into the order of the\r\ngarter,--but this is little to what followed.\r\n\r\nIn 1568, after the remonstrances and intercession of Elizabeth, the\r\nsuccours lent by the German protestants, and the strenuous resistance\r\nmade by the Hugonots themselves, had procured for this persecuted sect a\r\nshort and treacherous peace, Catherine, in proof and confirmation of her\r\nentire friendship with the queen of England, began to drop hints to her\r\nambassador of a marriage between his mistress and her third son the\r\nduke of Anjou, then only seventeen years of age. Elizabeth was assuredly\r\nnot so much of a dupe as to believe the queen-mother sincere in this\r\nstrange proposal; yet it was entertained by her with the utmost apparent\r\nseriousness. She even thought proper to give it a certain degree of\r\ncautious encouragement, which Catherine was doubtless well able rightly\r\nto interpret; and with this extraordinary kind of mutual understanding,\r\nthese two ingenious females continued for months, nay years, to amuse\r\nthemselves and one another with the representation of carrying on of\r\nnegotiations for a treaty of marriage. Elizabeth, with the most candid\r\nand natural air in the world, remarked that difference of religion would\r\npresent the most serious obstacle to so desirable an union: Catherine,\r\nwith equal plausibility, hoped that on this point terms of agreement\r\nmight be found satisfactory to both parties; and warming as they\r\nproceeded, one began to imagine the conditions to which a catholic\r\nprince could with honor accede, and the other to invent the objections\r\nwhich ought to be made to them by a protestant princess.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical inquirer, who has learned from the study of history\r\nhow much more the high destinies of nations are governed by the\r\npermanent circumstances of geographical position and relative force, and\r\nthe great moral causes which act upon whole ages and peoples, than by\r\nnegotiations, intrigues, schemes of politicians and tricks of state,\r\nwill be apt to regard as equally futile and base the petty manoeuvres\r\nof dissimulation and artifice employed by each queen to incline in her\r\nown favor the political balance. But in justice to the memories of\r\nCatherine and Elizabeth,--women whom neither their own nor any\r\nafter-times have taxed with folly,--it ought at least to be observed,\r\nthat in mistaking the excess of falsehood for the perfection of address,\r\nthe triumphs of cunning for the masterpieces of public wisdom, they did\r\nbut partake the error of the ablest male politicians of that age of\r\nstatesmen. The same narrow views of the interest of princes and of\r\nstates governed them all: they seem to have believed that the right and\r\nthe expedient were constantly opposed to each other; in the intercourses\r\nof public men they thought that nothing was more carefully to be shunned\r\nthan plain speaking and direct dealings, and in these functionaries they\r\nregarded the use of every kind of \"indirection\" as allowable, because\r\nabsolutely essential to the great end of serving their country.\r\n\r\nAmongst the wiser and better part of Elizabeth's council however, such a\r\nprofound abhorrence of the measures of the French court at this time\r\nprevailed, and such an honest eagerness to join heart and hand with the\r\noppressed Hugonots for the redress of their intolerable grievances, that\r\nit required all her vigilance and address to keep them within the limits\r\nof that temporizing moderation which she herself was bent on preserving.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence of Cecil with sir Henry Norris, then ambassador in\r\nFrance, the bitterness of his feelings is perpetually breaking out, and\r\nhe cannot refrain from relating with extreme complacency such words of\r\ndispleasure as her majesty was at any time moved to let fall against\r\nher high allies. In November 1567, when civil war had again broken out\r\nin France, he acquaints the ambassador that the queen dislikes to give\r\nassistance to Conde and his party against their sovereign, but\r\nrecommends it to him to do it occasionally notwithstanding, as the\r\ncouncil are their friends.\r\n\r\nIn September 1568 he writes thus: \"The French ambassador has sent his\r\nnephew to require audience, and that it might be ordered to have her\r\nmajesty's council present at the bishop's missado. Her majesty's answer\r\nwas, that they forgot themselves, in coming from a king that was but\r\nyoung, to think her not able to conceive an answer without her council:\r\nand although she could use the advice of her council, as was meet, yet\r\nshe saw no cause why they should thus deal with her, being of full\r\nyears, and governing her realm in better sort than France was. So the\r\naudience, being demanded on Saturday, was put off till Tuesday,\r\nwherewith I think they are not contented.\" Again: \"Monsieur de\r\nMontausier... was brought to the queen's presence to report the victory\r\nwhich God had given the French king by a battle, as he termed it,\r\nwherein was slain the prince of Conde; whereunto, as I could conceive,\r\nher majesty answered, that of any good fortune happening to the king she\r\nwas glad; but that she thought it also to be condoled with the king,\r\nthat it should be counted a victory to have a prince of his blood slain;\r\nand so with like speech, not fully to their contentation[67].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 67: Scrinia Ceciliana.]\r\n\r\nWith the Spanish court the queen was on the worst possible terms short\r\nof open hostilities. Her ambassador at Madrid had been banished from the\r\ncity to a little village in the neighbourhood; the Spanish ambassador at\r\nLondon had been placed under guard for dispersing libels against her\r\nperson and government; and in consequence of her adroit seizure of a sum\r\nof money belonging to some Genoese merchants designed as a loan to the\r\nduke of Alva, to enable him to carry on the war against the protestants\r\nin Flanders, the king of Spain had ordered all commerce to be broken off\r\nbetween those provinces and England.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these menaces of foreign war, cabals were forming\r\nagainst Elizabeth in her own kingdom and court which threatened her with\r\nnearer dangers. Of all these plots, the Scottish queen was, directly or\r\nindirectly, the cause or the pretext; and in order to place them in a\r\nclear light, it will now be necessary to return to the conferences at\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1568 TO 1570.\r\n\r\nProceedings of the commissioners at York in the cause of\r\nMary.--Intrigues of the duke of Norfolk with the regent Murray.--The\r\nconferences transferred to Westminster.--Mary's guilt disclosed.--Fresh\r\nintrigues of Norfolk.--Conspiracy for procuring his marriage with\r\nMary.--Conduct of Throgmorton.--Attempt to ruin Cecil baffled by the\r\nqueen.--Endeavour of Sussex to reconcile Norfolk and Cecil.--Norfolk\r\nbetrayed by Leicester--his plot revealed--committed to the Tower.--Mary\r\ngiven in charge to the earl of Huntingdon.--Remarks on this\r\nsubject.--Notice of Leonard Dacre--of the earls of Westmorland and\r\nNorthumberland.--Their rebellion.--Particulars of the Norton\r\nfamily.--Severities exercised against the rebels.--Conduct of the earl\r\nof Sussex.--Rising under Leonard Dacre.--His after-fortunes and those of\r\nhis family.--Expedition of the earl of Sussex into Scotland.--Murder of\r\nregent Murray.--Influence of this event on the affairs of\r\nElizabeth.--Campaign in Scotland.--Papal bull against the\r\nqueen.--Trifling effect produced by it.--Attachment of the people to her\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three commissioners named by Elizabeth to sit as judges in the great\r\ncause between Mary and her subjects, of which she had been named the\r\numpire, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Sussex, and sir Ralph\r\nSadler, a very able negotiator and man of business. On the part of the\r\nScottish nation, the regent Murray, fearing to trust the cause in other\r\nhands, appeared in person, attended by several men of talent and\r\nconsequence. The situation of Mary herself was not more critical or more\r\nunprecedented, and scarcely more humiliating, than that in which Murray\r\nwas placed by her appeal to Elizabeth. Acting on behalf of the infant\r\nking his nephew, he saw himself called upon to submit to the tribunal of\r\na foreign sovereign such proofs of the atrocious guilt of the queen his\r\nsister; as should justify in the eyes of this sovereign, and in those of\r\nEurope, the degradation of Mary from the exalted station which she was\r\nborn to fill, her imprisonment, her violent expulsion from the kingdom,\r\nand her future banishment or captivity for life:--an attempt in which,\r\nthough successful, there was both disgrace to himself and detriment to\r\nthe honor and independence of his country; and from which, if\r\nunsuccessful, he could contemplate nothing but certain ruin. Struck with\r\nall the evils of this dilemma; with the danger of provoking beyond\r\nforgiveness his own queen, whose restoration he still regarded as no\r\nimprobable event, and with the imprudence of relying implicitly on the\r\ndubious protection of Elizabeth, Murray long hesitated to bring forward\r\nthe only charge dreaded by the illustrious prisoner,--that of having\r\nconspired with Bothwell the murder of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Maitland, a Scottish commissioner secretly attached to\r\nMary, found means to open a private communication with the duke of\r\nNorfolk, and to suggest to this nobleman, now a widower for the third\r\ntime, the project of obtaining for himself the hand of Mary, and of\r\nreplacing her by force on the throne of her ancestors. The vanity of\r\nNorfolk, artfully worked upon by the bishop of Ross, Mary's prime\r\nagent, caused him to listen with complacency to this rash proposal; and\r\nhaving once consented to entertain it, he naturally became earnest to\r\nprevent Murray from preferring that heinous accusation which he had at\r\nlength apprized the English commissioners that he was provided with\r\nample means of substantiating. After some deliberation on the means of\r\neffecting this object, he accordingly resolved upon the step of\r\ndiscovering his views to the regent himself, and endeavouring to obtain\r\nhis concurrence. Murray, who seems to have felt little confidence in the\r\nstability of the government of which he was the present head, and who\r\njudged perhaps that the return of the queen as the wife of an English\r\nprotestant nobleman would afford the best prospect of safety to himself\r\nand his party, readily acceded to the proposal, and consented still to\r\nwithhold the \"damning proofs\" of Mary's guilt which he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nBut neither the Scottish associates of Murray nor the English cabinet\r\nwere disposed to rest satisfied with this feeble and temporizing\r\nconduct. Mary's commissioners too, emboldened by his apparent timidity,\r\nof which the motives were probably not known to them all, began to push\r\ntheir advantage in a manner which threatened final defeat to his party:\r\nthe queen of England artfuly incited him to proceed; and in spite of his\r\nsecret engagements with the duke and his own reluctance, he at length\r\nsaw himself compelled to let fall the long suspended stroke on the head\r\nof Mary. He applied to the English court for encouragement and\r\nprotection in his perilous enterprise; and Elizabeth, being at length\r\nsuspicious of the intrigue which had hitherto baffled all her\r\nexpectations from the conferences at York, suddenly gave orders for the\r\nremoval of the queen of Scots from Bolton-castle and the superintendence\r\nof lord Scrope, the duke's brother-in-law, to the more secure situation\r\nof Tutbury-castle in Staffordshire and the vigilant custody of the earl\r\nof Shrewsbury. At the same time she found pretexts for transferring the\r\nconferences from York to Westminster, and added to the number of her\r\ncommissioners sir Nicholas Bacon, lord-keeper, the earls of Arundel and\r\nLeicester, lord Clinton, and Cecil.\r\n\r\nAnxious to preserve an air of impartiality, Elizabeth declined giving to\r\nthe regent all the assurances for his future security which he required;\r\nbut on his arrival in London she extended to him a reception equally\r\nkind and respectful, and by alternate caresses and hints of intimidation\r\nshe gradually led him on to the production of the fatal casket\r\ncontaining the letters of Mary to Bothwell, by which her participation\r\nin the murder of her husband was clearly proved.\r\n\r\nAfter steps on the part of his sovereign from which the duke might have\r\ninferred her knowledge of his secret machinations; after discoveries\r\nrespecting the conduct of Mary which impeached her of guilt so heinous,\r\nand covered her with infamy so indelible; prudence and honor alike\r\nrequired that he should abandon for ever the thought of linking his\r\ndestiny with hers. But in the light and unbalanced mind of Norfolk, the\r\nambition of matching with royalty unfortunately preponderated over all\r\nother considerations: he speedily began to weave anew the tissue of\r\nintrigue which the removal of the conferences had broken off; and\r\nturning once more with fond credulity to Murray, by whom his cause had\r\nbeen before deserted, he again put confidence in his assurances that the\r\nmarriage-project had his hearty approbation, and should receive his\r\neffectual support. Melvil informs us that this fresh compact was brought\r\nabout by sir Nicholas Throgmorton, \"being a man of a deep reach and\r\ngreat prudence and discretion, who had ever travelled for the union of\r\nthis isle.\" But notwithstanding his \"deep reach,\" he was certainly\r\nimposed upon in this affair; for the regent, insincere perhaps from the\r\nbeginning, had now no other object than to secure his present personal\r\nsafety by lavishing promises which he had no intention to fulfil.\r\nMelvil, who attended him on his return to Scotland, thus explains the\r\nsecret of his conduct: \"At that time the duke commanded over all the\r\nnorth parts of England, where our mistress was kept, and so might have\r\ntaken her out when he pleased. And when he was angry at the regent, he\r\nhad appointed the earl of Westmorland to lie in his way, and cut off\r\nhimself and so many of his company as were most bent upon the queen's\r\naccusation. But after the last agreement, the duke sent and discharged\r\nthe said earl from doing us any harm; yet upon our return the earl came\r\nin our way with a great company of horse, to signify to us that we were\r\nat his mercy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe, notwithstanding this positive testimony,\r\nthat the duke of Norfolk, a man of mild dispositions and guided in the\r\nmain by religion and conscience, would have hazarded, or would not have\r\nscrupled, so atrocious, so inexpiable an act of violence, as that of\r\ncutting off the regent of Scotland returning to his own country under\r\nsanction of the public faith and the express protection of the queen:\r\nbut he may have indulged himself in vague menaces, which Westmorland, a\r\nbigoted papist, ripe for rebellion against the government of Elizabeth,\r\nwould have felt little reluctance to carry into effect, and thus the\r\nregent's duplicity might in fact be prompted and excused to himself by a\r\nprinciple of self-defence.\r\n\r\nWhatever degree of confidence Norfolk and his advisers might place in\r\nMurray's sincerity, they were well aware that other steps must be taken,\r\nand other confederates engaged, before the grand affair of the marriage\r\ncould be put in a train to ensure its final success. There was no\r\nimmediate prospect of Mary's regaining her liberty by means of the queen\r\nof England, or with her concurrence; for since the production of the\r\ngreat charge against her, to which she had instructed her commissioners\r\nto decline making any answer, Elizabeth had regarded her as one who had\r\nsuffered judgement to go against her by default, and began to treat her\r\naccordingly. Her confinement was rendered more rigorous, and henceforth\r\nthe still pending negotiations respecting her return to her own country\r\nwere carried on with a slackness which evidently proceeded from the\r\ndread of Mary, and the reluctance of Elizabeth, to bring to a decided\r\ndetermination a business which could not now be ended either with credit\r\nor advantage to the deposed queen.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had dismissed the regent to his government without open\r\napprobation of his conduct as without censure; but he had received from\r\nher in private an important supply of money, and such other effectual\r\naids as not only served to establish the present preponderance of his\r\nauthority, but would enable him, it was thought, successfully to\r\nwithstand all future attempts for the restoration of Mary. Evidently\r\nthen it was only by the raising of a formidable party in the English\r\ncourt that any thing could be effected in behalf of the royal captive;\r\nbut her agents and those of the duke assured themselves that ample means\r\nwere in their hands for setting this machine in action.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, it was now thought, would not marry: the queen of Scots was\r\ngenerally admitted to be her legal heir; and it appeared highly\r\nimportant to the welfare of England that she should not transfer her\r\nclaims, with her hand, to any of the more powerful princes of Europe;\r\nconsequently the duke entertained little doubt of uniting in favor of\r\nhis suit the suffrages of all those leading characters in the English\r\ncourt who had formerly conveyed to Mary assurances of their attachment\r\nto her title and interests. His own influence amongst the nobility was\r\nvery considerable, and he readily obtained the concurrence of the earl\r\nof Pembroke, the earl of Arundel (his first wife's father), and lord\r\nLumley (a catholic peer closely connected with the house of Howard). The\r\ndesign was now imparted to Leicester, who entered into it with an\r\nostentation of affectionate zeal which ought perhaps to have alarmed the\r\ntoo credulous duke. As if impatient to give an undeniable pledge of his\r\nsincerity, he undertook to draw up with his own hand a letter to the\r\nqueen of Scots, warmly recommending the duke to her matrimonial choice,\r\nwhich immediately received the signatures of the three nobles above\r\nmentioned and the rest of the confederates. By these subscribers it was\r\ndistinctly stipulated, that the union should not take place without the\r\nknowledge and approbation of the queen of England, and that the reformed\r\nreligion should be maintained in both the British kingdoms;--conditions\r\nby which they at first perhaps believed that they had provided\r\nsufficiently for the interests of Elizabeth and of protestantism: it was\r\nhowever immediately obvious that the duke and his agents had the design\r\nof concealing carefully all their measures from their sovereign, till\r\nthe party should have gained such strength that it would no longer be\r\nsafe for her to refuse a consent which it was well known that she would\r\nalways be unwilling to grant.\r\n\r\nBut when, on encouragement being given by Mary to the hopes of her\r\nsuitor, the kings of France and Spain, and even the Pope himself, were\r\nmade privy to the scheme and pledged to give it their assistance, all\r\nits English, and especially all its protestant supporters, ought to have\r\nbeen aware that their undertaking was assuming the form of a conspiracy\r\nwith the enemies of their queen and country against her government and\r\npersonal safety; against the public peace, and the religion by law\r\nestablished; and nothing can excuse the blindness, or palliate the\r\nguilt, of their perseverance in a course so perilous and so crooked.\r\n\r\nPrivate interests were doubtless at the bottom with most or all of the\r\nparticipators in this affair who were not papists; and those,--they were\r\nnot a few,--who envied or who feared the influence and authority of\r\nCecil, eagerly seized the occasion to array against him a body of\r\nhostility by which they trusted to work his final and irretrievable\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been by an ambitious rivalry with the secretary, that\r\nsir Nicholas Throgmorton, whose early life had exhibited so bold a\r\nspirit of resistance to tyranny and popery when triumphant and\r\nenthroned, had been carried into a faction which all his principles\r\nought to have rendered odious to him. In his intercourses with the queen\r\nof Scots as ambassador from Elizabeth, he had already shown himself her\r\nzealous partisan. In advising her to sign for her safety the deed of\r\nabdication tendered to her at Loch-Leven, he had basely suggested that\r\nthe compulsion under which she acted would excuse her from regarding it\r\nas binding: to the English crown he also regarded her future title as\r\nincontrovertible. He now represented to his party, that Cecil was\r\nsecretly inclined to the house of Suffolk; and that no measure favorable\r\nto the reputation or authority of the queen of Scots could be carried\r\nwhilst he enjoyed the confidence of his mistress. By these suggestions,\r\nthe duke, unfortunately for himself, was led to sanction an attempt\r\nagainst the power and reputation of this great minister.\r\n\r\nLeicester, who had long hated his virtues; the old corrupt statesmen\r\nWinchester, Pembroke, and Arundel; and the discontented catholic peers\r\nNorthumberland and Westmorland, eagerly joined in the plot. It was\r\nagreed to attack the secretary in the privy-council, on the ground of\r\nhis having advised the detention of the money going into the Low\r\nCountries for the service of the king of Spain, and thus exposing the\r\nnation to the danger of a war with this potentate; and Throgmorton is\r\nsaid to have advised that, whatever he answered, they should find some\r\npretext for sending him to the Tower; after which, he said, it would be\r\neasy to compass his overthrow.\r\n\r\nBut the penetration of Elizabeth enabled her to appretiate justly, with\r\na single exception, the principles, characters, and motives of all her\r\nservants; and she knew that, while his enemies were exclusively attached\r\nto their own interests, Cecil was attached also to the interests of his\r\nprince, his country, and his religion; that while others,--with that\r\nfar-sighted selfishness which involves men in so many intrigues, usually\r\nrendered fruitless or needless by the after-course of events,--were bent\r\non securing to themselves the good graces of her successor, he was\r\ncontent to depend on her alone; that while others were the courtiers,\r\nthe flatterers, or the ministers, of the queen, he, and perhaps he only,\r\nwas the friend of Elizabeth. All the rest she knew that she could\r\nreplace at a moment;--him never. Secret information was carried to her\r\nof all that her council were contriving, and had almost executed,\r\nagainst the secretary: full of indignation she hurried to their meeting,\r\nwhere she was not expected, and by her peremptory mandate put an instant\r\nstop to their proceedings; making Leicester himself sensible, by a\r\nwarmth which did her honor, that the man who held the first place in her\r\nesteem was by no one to be injured with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Sussex, the true friend of Norfolk, and never his abettor in\r\ndesigns of which his sober judgement could discern all the criminality\r\nand all the rashness, was grieved to the soul that the artifices of his\r\nfollowers should have set him at variance with Cecil. He was doubtless\r\naware of the advantage which their disagreement would minister against\r\nthem both to the malignant Leicester, his and their common enemy; and\r\ntrembling for the safety of the duke and the welfare of both, he\r\naddressed to the secretary, from the north, where he was then occupied\r\nin the queen's service, a letter on the subject, eloquent by its\r\nuncommon earnestness.\r\n\r\nHe tells him that he knows not the occasion of the coldness between him\r\nand the duke, of which he had acknowledged the existence; but that he\r\ncannot believe other, esteeming both parties as he does, than that it\r\nmust have had its origin in misrepresentation and the ill offices of\r\ntheir enemies; and he implores him, as the general remedy of all such\r\ndifferences, to resort to a full and fair explanation with the duke\r\nhimself, in whom he will find \"honor, truth, wisdom and plainness.\"\r\n\r\nThese excellent exhortations were not without effect: it is probable\r\nthat the incautious duke had either been led inadvertently or dragged\r\nunwillingly, by his faction, into the plot against the secretary, whose\r\nruin he was not likely to have sought from any personal motive of\r\nenmity; and accordingly a few weeks after (June 1569) we find Sussex\r\ncongratulating Cecil, in a second letter, on a reconciliation between\r\nthem which he trusts will prove entire and permanent[68].\r\n\r\n[Note 68: \"Illustrations\" &c. by Lodge, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nHitherto the queen had preserved so profound a silence respecting the\r\nintrigues of the duke, that he flattered himself she was without a\r\nsuspicion of their existence; but this illusion was soon to vanish. In\r\nAugust 1569, the queen being at Farnham in her progress and the duke in\r\nattendance on her, she took him to dine with her, and in the course of\r\nconversation found occasion, \"without any show of displeasure,\" but with\r\nsufficient significance of manner, to give him the advice, \"to be very\r\ncareful on what pillow he rested his head.\" Afterwards she cautioned him\r\nin plain terms against entering into any marriage treaty with the queen\r\nof Scots. The duke, in his first surprise, made no scruple to promise on\r\nhis allegiance that he would entertain no thoughts of her; he even\r\naffected to speak of such a connexion with disdain, declaring that he\r\nesteemed his lands in England worth nearly as much as the whole kingdom\r\nof Scotland, wasted as it was by wars and tumults, and that in his\r\ntennis-court at Norwich he reckoned himself equal to many a\r\nprince.--These demonstrations were all insincere; the duke remained\r\nsteady to his purpose, and his correspondence with the queen of Scots\r\nwas not for a single day intermitted in submission to his Sovereign. But\r\nhe felt that it was now time to take off the mask; and fully confiding\r\nin the strength of his party, he requested the earl of Leicester\r\nimmediately to open the marriage proposal to her majesty, and solicit\r\nher consent. This the favorite promised, but for his own ends continued\r\nto defer the business from day to day.\r\n\r\nCecil, who had recently been taken into the consultations of the duke,\r\nurged upon him with great force the expediency of being himself the\r\nfirst to name his wishes to the queen; but Norfolk, either from\r\ntimidity, or, more probably, from an ill-founded reliance on Leicester's\r\nsincerity, and a distrust, equally misplaced, of that of Cecil, whom he\r\nwas conscious of having ill treated, neglected to avail himself of this\r\nwise and friendly counsel, by which he might yet have been preserved.\r\nLeicester, who watched all his motions, was at length satisfied that his\r\npurpose was effected,--the victim was inveigled beyond the power of\r\nretreat or escape, and it was time for the decoy-bird to slip out of the\r\nsnare.\r\n\r\nHe summoned to his aid a fit of sickness, the never-failing resource of\r\nthe courtiers of Elizabeth in case of need. His pitying mistress, as he\r\nhad doubtless anticipated, hastened to pay him a charitable visit at his\r\nown house, and he then suffered her to discover that his malady was\r\noccasioned by some momentous secret which weighed upon his spirits; and\r\nafter due ostentation of penitence and concern, at length revealed to\r\nher the whole of the negotiations for the marriage of the duke with the\r\nqueen of Scots, including the part which he had himself taken in that\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, who seems by no means to have suspected that matters had gone\r\nso far, or that so many of her nobles were implicated in this\r\ntransaction, was moved with indignation, and commanded the immediate\r\nattendance of the duke, who, conscious of his delinquency, and\r\ndisquieted by the change which he thought he had observed in the\r\ncountenance of her majesty and the carriage towards him of his brother\r\npeers, had sometime before quitted the court, and retired first to his\r\nhouse in London, and afterwards to his seat of Kenninghall in Norfolk.\r\nThe duke delayed to appear, not daring to trust himself in the hands of\r\nhis offended sovereign; and after a short delay, procured for him by the\r\ncompassion of Cecil, who persisted in assuring the queen that he would\r\ndoubtless come shortly of his own accord, a messenger was sent to bring\r\nhim up to London. This messenger, on his arrival, found the duke\r\napparently, and perhaps really, laboring under a violent ague; and he\r\nsuffered himself to be prevailed upon to accept his solemn promise of\r\nappearing at court as soon as he should be able to travel, and to return\r\nwithout him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the queen, now bent upon sifting this matter to the bottom,\r\nhad written to require the Scottish regent to inform her of the share\r\nwhich he had taken in the intrigue, and whatever else he knew respecting\r\nit. Murray had become fully aware how much more important it was to his\r\ninterests to preserve the favor and friendship of Elizabeth than to aim\r\nat keeping any measures with Mary, by whom he was now hated with extreme\r\nbitterness; and learning that the confidence of the duke had already\r\nbeen betrayed by the earl of Leicester, he made no scruple of\r\nacquainting her with all the particulars in which he was immediately\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIt thus became known to Elizabeth, that as early as the conferences at\r\nYork, the regent had been compelled, by threats of personal violence on\r\nhis return to Scotland, to close with the proposals of the duke relative\r\nto his marriage;--that it was with a view to this union that Mary had\r\nsolicited from the states of Scotland a sentence of divorce from\r\nBothwell, which Murray by the exertion of his influence had induced them\r\nto refuse, and thus delayed the completion of the contract: but it\r\nappeared from other evidence, that written promises of marriage had\r\nactually been exchanged between the duke and Mary, and committed to the\r\nsafe keeping of the French ambassador. It was also found to be a part of\r\nthe scheme to betroth the infant king of Scots to a daughter of the duke\r\nof Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe anger of Elizabeth disdained to be longer trifled with; and she\r\ndispatched a messenger with peremptory orders to bring up the duke, \"his\r\nague notwithstanding,\" who found him already preparing to set out on his\r\njourney. Cecil in one of his letters to sir Henry Norris, dated October\r\n1569, relates these circumstances at length, and expresses his\r\nsatisfaction in the last, both for the sake of the state and of the\r\nduke himself, whom, of all subjects, he declares he most loved and\r\nhonored. He then proceeds thus: \"The queen's majesty hath willed the\r\nearl of Arundel and my lord of Pembroke to keep their lodgings here, for\r\nthat they were privy of this marriage intended, and did not reveal it to\r\nher majesty; but I think none of them did so with any evil meaning, and\r\nof my lord of Pembroke's intent herein I can witness, that he meant\r\nnothing but well to the queen's majesty; my lord Lumley is also\r\nrestrained: the queen's majesty hath also been grievously offended with\r\nmy lord of Leicester; but considering that he hath revealed all that he\r\nsaith he knoweth of himself, her majesty spareth her displeasure the\r\nmore towards him. Some disquiets must arise, but I trust not hurtful;\r\nfor her majesty saith she will know the truth, so as every one shall see\r\nhis own fault, and so stay.... My lord of Huntingdon is joined with the\r\nearl of Shrewsbury for the Scots queen's safety. Whilst this matter was\r\nin passing, you must not think but the queen of Scots was nearer looked\r\nto than before.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke on his arrival was committed to the Tower; but neither against\r\nhim nor any of his adherents did the queen think proper to proceed by\r\ncourse of law, and they were all liberated after a restraint of longer\r\nor shorter duration.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to mention, that the adherents of Mary in her own time, and\r\nvarious writers since, have conspired to cast severe reflections upon\r\nElizabeth for committing her to the joint custody of the earl of\r\nHuntingdon, because this nobleman, being descended by his mother, a\r\ndaughter of Henry Pole lord Montacute, from the house of Clarence, was\r\nsupposed to put his right of succession to the crown in competition with\r\nhers, and therefore to entertain against her peculiar animosity. But on\r\nthe part of Elizabeth it may be observed, First, that there is not the\r\nslightest ground to suspect that this nobleman, who was childless,\r\nentertained the most distant idea of reviving the obsolete claims of his\r\nfamily; and certainly if Elizabeth had suspected him of it, he would\r\nnever have held so high a place in her confidence. Secondly, nothing\r\nless than the death of Mary would have served any designs that he might\r\nhave formed; and by joining him in commission with others for her safe\r\nkeeping, Elizabeth will scarcely be said to have put it in his power to\r\nmake away with her. Thirdly, the very writers who complain of the\r\nvigilance and strictness with which the queen of Scots was now guarded,\r\nall acknowledge that nothing less could have baffled the plans of escape\r\nwhich the zeal of her partisans was continually setting on foot. Amongst\r\nthe warmest of these partisans was Leonard Dacre, a gentleman whose\r\npersonal qualities, whose errors, injuries and misfortunes, all conspire\r\nto render him an object of attention, illustrative as they also are of\r\nthe practices and sentiments of his age.\r\n\r\nLeonard was the second son of William lord Dacre of Gilsland, descended\r\nfrom the ancient barons Vaux who had held lordships in Cumberland from\r\nthe days of the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nIn 1568, on the death without issue of his nephew, a minor in wardship\r\nto the duke of Norfolk, Leonard as heir male laid claim to the title and\r\nfamily estates, but the three sisters of the last lord disputed with him\r\nthis valuable succession; and being supported by the interest of the\r\nduke of Norfolk their step-father, to whose three sons they were\r\nmarried, they found means to defeat the claims of their uncle, though\r\nindisputably good in law;--one instance in a thousand of the scandalous\r\npartiality towards the rich and powerful exhibited in the legal\r\ndecisions of that age.\r\n\r\nStung with resentment against the government and the queen herself, by\r\nwhom justice had been denied him, Leonard Dacre threw himself, with all\r\nthe impetuosity of his character, into the measures of the malcontents\r\nand the interests of the queen of Scots, and he laid a daring plan for\r\nher deliverance from Tutbury-castle. This plan the duke on its being\r\ncommunicated to him had vehemently opposed, partly from his repugnance\r\nto measures of violence, partly from the apprehension that Mary, when at\r\nliberty, might fall into the hands of a foreign and catholic party, and\r\ndesert her engagements with him for a marriage with the king of Spain.\r\nDacre, however, was not to be diverted from his design, especially by\r\nthe man with whom he was at open enmity, and he assembled a troop of\r\nhorse for its execution; but suspicions had probably been excited, and\r\nthe sudden removal of the prisoner to Wingfield frustrated all his\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only attempt of that turbulent and dangerous faction of\r\nwhich the inconsiderate ambition of the duke had rendered him nominally\r\nthe head but really the tool and victim, which he had now the grief to\r\nfind himself utterly unable to guide or restrain.\r\n\r\nThe earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, heads of the ancient and\r\nwarlike families of Percy and Nevil, were the first to break that\r\ninternal tranquillity which the kingdom had hitherto enjoyed, without\r\nthe slightest interruption, under the wise and vigorous rule of\r\nElizabeth. The remoteness of these noblemen from the court and capital,\r\nwith the poverty and consequent simplicity, almost barbarism, of the\r\nvassals over whom they bore sway, and whose homage they received like\r\nnative and independent princes, appears to have nourished in their minds\r\nideas of their own importance better suited to the period of the wars of\r\nthe Roses than to the happier age of peace and order which had\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nThe offended pride of the earl of Westmorland, a man destitute in fact\r\nof every kind of talent, seems on some occasion to have conducted him to\r\nthe discovery that at the court of Elizabeth the representative of the\r\nking-making Warwick was a person of very slender consideration. The\r\nfailure of the grand attack upon the secretary, in which he had taken\r\npart, confirmed this mortifying impression; and the committal of his\r\nbrother-in-law, the great and powerful duke of Norfolk himself, must\r\nsubsequently have carried home to the bottom of his heart unwilling\r\nconviction that the preponderance of the ancient aristocracy of the\r\ncountry was subverted, and its proudest chieftains fast sinking to the\r\ncommon level of subjects. His attachment to the religion, with the\r\nother practices and prejudices of former ages, gave additional\r\nexasperation to his discontent against the established order of things:\r\nthe incessant invectives of Romish priests against a princess whom the\r\npope was on the point of anathematizing, represented the cause of her\r\nenemies as that of Heaven itself; and the spirit of the earl was roused\r\nat length to seek full vengeance for all the injuries sustained by his\r\npride, his interests, or his principles.\r\n\r\nEvery motive of disaffection which wrought upon the mind of Westmorland,\r\naffected equally the earl of Northumberland; and to the cause of popery\r\nthe latter was still further pledged by the example and fate of his\r\nfather, that sir Thomas Percy who had perished on the scaffold for his\r\nshare in Aske's rebellion. The attainder of sir Thomas had debarred his\r\nson from succeeding to the titles and estates of the last unhappy earl\r\nhis uncle, and he had suffered the mortification of seeing them go to\r\nraise the fortunes of the house of Dudley; but on the accession of Mary,\r\nby whom his father was regarded as a martyr, he had been restored to all\r\nthe honors of his birth, and treated with a degree of favor which could\r\nnot but strengthen his predilection for the faith of which she was the\r\npatroness. It appears, however, that the attachment of the earl to the\r\ncause of popery had not on all occasions been proof against immediate\r\npersonal interest. Soon after the marriage of the queen of Scots with\r\nDarnley, that rash and ill-judging pair esteeming their authority in the\r\ncountry sufficiently established to enable them to venture on an\r\nattempt for the restoration of the old religion, the pope, in\r\nfurtherance of their pious designs, had remitted the sum of eight\r\nthousand crowns. \"But the ship wherein the said gold was,\" says James\r\nMelvil in his memoirs, \"did shipwrack upon the coast of England, within\r\nthe earl of Northumberland's bounds, who alleged the whole to appertain\r\nto him by just law, which he caused his advocate to read unto me, when I\r\nwas directed to him for the demanding restitution of the said sum, in\r\nthe old Norman language, which neither he nor I understood well, it was\r\nso corrupt. But all my entreaties were ineffectual, he altogether\r\nrefusing to give any part thereof to the queen, albeit he was himself a\r\ncatholic, and professed secretly to be her friend.\" And through this\r\ndisappointment Mary was compelled to give up her design.\r\n\r\nAn additional trait of the earl's character is furnished by the same\r\nauthor, in transcribing the instructions which he carried home from his\r\nbrother sir Robert Melvil, then ambassador to England, on his return\r\nfrom that country, after announcing the birth of the prince of Scotland.\r\n\"_Item_, that her majesty cast not off the earl of Northumberland,\r\nalbeit as a fearful and facile man he delivered her letter to the queen\r\nof England; neither appear to find fault with sir Henry Percy as yet for\r\nhis dealing with Mr. Ruxbie,\" (an English spy in Scotland) \"which he\r\ndoth to gain favor at court, being upon a contrary faction to his\r\nbrother the earl.\"\r\n\r\nThe machinations of the two earls, however cautiously carried on, did\r\nnot entirely escape the penetration of the earl of Sussex, lord\r\npresident of the north, who sent for them both and subjected them to\r\nsome kind of examination; but no sufficient cause for their detention\r\nthen appearing, he dismissed them, hoping probably that the warning\r\nwould prove efficacious in securing their peaceable behaviour. In this\r\nidea, however, he was deceived: on their return they instantly resumed\r\ntheir mischievous designs; and they were actually preparing for an\r\ninsurrection, which was to be supported by troops from Flanders promised\r\nby the duke of Alva, when a summons from the queen for their immediate\r\nattendance at court disconcerted all their measures.\r\n\r\nTo comply with the command seemed madness in men who were conscious that\r\ntheir proceedings had already amounted to high treason;--but to refuse\r\nobedience, and thus set at defiance a power to which they were as yet\r\nunprepared to oppose any effectual resistance, seemed equally desperate.\r\nThey hesitated; and it is said that the irresolution of Northumberland\r\nwas only ended by the stratagem of some of his dependents, who waked him\r\none night with a false alarm that his enemies were upon him, and thus\r\nhurried him into the irretrievable step of quitting his home and joining\r\nWestmorland, on which the country flocked in for their defence, and they\r\nfound themselves compelled to raise their standard.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise immediately assumed the aspect of a Holy War, or crusade\r\nagainst heresy: on the banners of the insurgents were displayed the\r\ncross, the five wounds of Christ, and the cup of the eucharist: mass\r\nwas regularly performed in their camp; and on reaching Durham, they\r\ncarried off from the cathedral and committed to the flames the bible and\r\nthe English service books.\r\n\r\nThe want of money to purchase provisions compelled the earls to\r\nrelinquish their first idea of marching to London; they took however a\r\nneighbouring castle, and remained masters of the country as long as no\r\narmy appeared to oppose them; but on the approach of the earl of Sussex\r\nand lord Hunsdon from York, with a large body of troops, they gradually\r\nretreated to the Scotch borders; and there disbanded their men without a\r\nblow. The earl of Westmorland finally made his escape to Flanders, where\r\nhe dragged out a tedious existence in poverty and obscurity, barely\r\nsupplied with the necessaries of life by a slender pension from the king\r\nof Spain. Northumberland, being betrayed for a reward by a Scottish\r\nborderer to whom, as to a friend, he had fled for refuge, was at length\r\ndelivered up by the regent Morton to the English government, and was\r\nbeheaded at York.\r\n\r\nPosterity is not called upon to respect the memory of these rebellious\r\nearls as martyrs even to a mistaken zeal for the good of their country,\r\nor to any other generous principle of action. The objects of their\r\nenterprise, as assigned by themselves, were the restoration of the old\r\nreligion, the removal of evil counsellors, and the liberation of the\r\nduke of Norfolk and other imprisoned nobles. But even their attachment\r\nto popery appears to have been entirely subservient to their views of\r\npersonal interest; and so little was the duke inclined to blend his\r\ncause with theirs, that he exerted himself in every mode that his\r\nsituation would permit to strengthen the hands of government for their\r\noverthrow; and it was in consideration of the loyal spirit manifested by\r\nhim on occasion of this rebellion, and of a subsequent rising in\r\nNorfolk, that he soon after obtained his liberty on a solemn promise to\r\nrenounce all connexion with the queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nIn the northern counties, however, the cause and the persons of the two\r\nearls, who had well maintained the hospitable fame of their great\r\nancestors, were alike the objects of popular attachment: the miserable\r\ndestiny of the outlawed and ruined Westmorland, and the untimely end of\r\nNorthumberland through the perfidy of the false friend in whom he had\r\nput his trust, were long remembered with pity and indignation, and many\r\na minstrel \"tuned his rude harp of border frame\" to the fall of the\r\nPercy or the wanderings of the Nevil. There was also an ancient\r\ngentleman named Norton, of Norton in Yorkshire, who bore the banner of\r\nthe cross and the five wounds before the rebel army, whose tragic fall,\r\nwith that of his eight sons, has received such commemoration and\r\nembellishment as the pathetic strains of a nameless but probably\r\ncontemporary bard could bestow. The excellent ballad entitled \"The\r\nRising in the North[69]\" impressively describes the mission of Percy's\r\n\"little foot page\" to Norton, to pray that he will \"ride in his\r\ncompany;\" the council held by Richard Norton with his nine sons, when\r\n\r\n    \"Eight of them did answer make,\r\n    Eight of them spake hastily,\r\n    O father! till the day we die\r\n    We'll stand by that good earl and thee;\"\r\n\r\nwhile Francis, the eldest, seeks to dissuade his father from rebellion,\r\nbut finding him resolved, offers to accompany him \"unarmed and naked.\"\r\nTheir standard is then mentioned: and after recording the flight of the\r\ntwo earls, the minstrel adds,\r\n\r\n    \"Thee Norton with thine eight good sons\r\n    They doomed to die, alas for ruth!\r\n    Thy reverend locks thee could not save,\r\n    Nor them their fair and blooming youth!\"\r\n\r\n[Note 69: See Percy's \"Reliques,\" vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nBut how slender is the authority of a poet in matters of history! It is\r\nquite certain that Richard Norton did not perish by the hands of the\r\nexecutioner, and it is uncertain whether any one of his sons did. It is\r\ntrue that the old man with three more of the family was attainted, that\r\nhis great estates were confiscated, and that he ended his days a\r\nmiserable exile in Flanders. We also know that two gentlemen of the name\r\nof Norton were hanged at London: but some authorities make them brothers\r\nof the head of the family; and two of the sons of Richard Norton,\r\nFrancis, and Edmund ancestor of the present lord Grantley, certainly\r\nlived and died in peace on their estates in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIt is little to the honor of Elizabeth's clemency, that a rebellion\r\nsuppressed almost without bloodshed should have been judged by her to\r\njustify and require the unmitigated exercise of martial law over the\r\nwhole of the disaffected country. Sir John Bowes, marshal of the army,\r\nmade it his boast, that in a tract sixty miles in length and forty in\r\nbreadth, there was scarcely a town or village where he had not put some\r\nto death; and at Durham the earl of Sussex caused sixty-three constables\r\nto be hanged at once;--a severity of which it should appear that he was\r\nthe unwilling instrument; for in a letter written soon after to Cecil he\r\ncomplains, that during part of the time of his command in the north he\r\nhad nothing left to him \"but to direct hanging matters.\" But the\r\nsituation of this nobleman at the time was such as would by no means\r\npermit him at his own peril to suspend or evade the execution of such\r\norders as he received from court. Egremond Ratcliffe his half-brother\r\nwas one of about forty noblemen and gentlemen attainted for their\r\nconcern in this rebellion; he had in the earl of Leicester an enemy\r\nequally vindictive and powerful; and some secret informations had\r\ninfused into the mind of the queen a suspicion that there had been some\r\nwilful slackness in his proceedings against the insurgents. There was\r\nhowever at the bottom of Elizabeth's heart a conviction of the truth and\r\nloyalty of her kinsman which could not be eradicated, and he soon after\r\ntook a spirited step which disconcerted entirely the measures of his\r\nenemies, and placed him higher than ever in her confidence and esteem.\r\nCecil thus relates the circumstance in one of his letters to Norris,\r\ndated February 1570.\r\n\r\n\"The earl of Sussex... upon desire to see her majesty, came hither\r\nunlooked for; and although, in the beginning of this northern rebellion,\r\nher majesty sometimes uttered some misliking of the earl, yet this day\r\nshe, meaning to deal very princely with him, in presence of her council,\r\ncharged him with such things as she had heard to cause her misliking,\r\nwithout any note of mistrust towards him for his fidelity; whereupon he\r\ndid with such humbleness, wisdom, plainness and dexterity, answer her\r\nmajesty, as both she and all the rest were fully satisfied, and he\r\nadjudged by good proofs to have served in all this time faithfully, and\r\nso circumspectly, as it manifestly appeareth that if he had not so used\r\nhimself in the beginning, the whole north part had entered into the\r\nrebellion.\"\r\n\r\nA formidable mass of discontent did in fact subsist among the catholics\r\nof the north, and it was not long before a new and more daring leader\r\nfound means to set it again in fierce and violent action.\r\n\r\nLeonard Dacre had found no opportunity to take part in the enterprise of\r\nthe two earls, though a deep participator in their counsels; for knowing\r\nthat their design could not yet be ripe for execution, and foreseeing as\r\nlittle as the rest of the faction those measures of the queen by which\r\ntheir affairs were prematurely brought to a crisis, he had proceeded to\r\ncourt on his private concerns, and was there amusing her majesty with\r\nprotestations of his unalterable fidelity and attachment, while his\r\nassociates in the north were placing their lands and lives on the hazard\r\nof rebellion. Learning on his journey homewards the total discomfiture\r\nof the earls, he carefully preserved the semblance of a zealous\r\nloyalty, till, having armed the retainers of his family on pretence of\r\npreserving the country in the queen's obedience, and having strongly\r\ngarrisoned its hereditary castles of Naworth and Greystock, which he\r\nwrested from the custody of the Howards, he declared himself, and broke\r\nout into violent rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe late severities had rather exasperated than subdued the spirit of\r\ndisaffection in this neighbourhood, and three thousand men ranged\r\nthemselves under the scallop-shells of Dacre;--a well known ensign which\r\nfrom age to age had marshalled the hardy borderers to deeds of warlike\r\nprowess. Lord Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, marched promptly forth\r\nwith all the force he could muster to disperse the rebels; but this time\r\nthey stood firmly on the banks of the little river Gelt, to give him\r\nbattle. Such indeed was the height of fanaticism or despair to which\r\nthese unhappy people were wrought up, that the phrensy gained the softer\r\nsex; and there were seen in their ranks, says the chronicler, \"many\r\ndesperate women that gave the adventure of their lives, and fought right\r\nstoutly.\" After a sharp action in which about three hundred were left\r\ndead on the field, victory at length declared for the queen's troops;\r\nand Leonard Dacre, who had bravely sustained, notwithstanding the\r\ndeformity of his person, the part of soldier as well as general, seeing\r\nthat all was lost, turned his horse's head and rode off full speed for\r\nScotland, whence he passed into Flanders and took up at Lovain his\r\nmelancholy abode.\r\n\r\nThe treason of this unfortunate gentleman was, it must be confessed,\r\nboth notorious and heinous; and had he been intercepted in making his\r\nescape, no blame could have attached to Elizabeth in exacting the full\r\npenalty of his offence. But when, five-and-twenty years after this time,\r\nwe find his aged mother at court \"an earnest suitor\" for the pardon of\r\nher two sons[70]; obtaining, probably by costly bribes, a promise of\r\nadmission to the queen's presence, and at length gaining nothing\r\nmore,--it is impossible not to blame or lament that relentless severity\r\nof temper which rendered Elizabeth so much a stranger to the fairest\r\nattribute of sovereign power. The case of Francis Dacre indeed was one\r\nwhich ought to have appealed to her sense of justice rather than to her\r\nfeelings of mercy. This gentleman, after the expatriation and attainder\r\nof his elder brother, had prosecuted at law the claims to the honors and\r\nlands of the barony of Gilsland which had thus devolved upon him; but\r\nbeing baffled in all his appeals to the equity of the courts, he had\r\nwithdrawn in disgust to Flanders, and on this account suffered a\r\nsentence of outlawry. He lived and died in exile, leaving a son, named\r\nRanulph, heir only to poverty and misfortunes, to noble blood, and to\r\nrights which he was destitute of the power of rendering available. Lord\r\nDacre of the south, as he was usually called, settled on this poor man,\r\nhis very distant relation, a small annuity; and on his death the\r\nfollowing lord Dacre, becoming the heir male of the family, received by\r\nway of compromise from the Howards no less than thirteen manors which\r\nthey had enjoyed to the prejudice of Leonard Dacre, of his brother and\r\nof his nephew.\r\n\r\n[Note 70: Letter of R. Whyte in \"Sidney Papers.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the suppression of this second rising in the north, the queen, better\r\nadvised or instructed by experience, granted a general pardon to all but\r\nits leader; and such was the effect of this lenity, or of the example of\r\nrepeated failure on the part of the insurgents, that the internal\r\ntranquillity of her kingdom was never more disturbed from this quarter,\r\nthe most dangerous of all from the vicinity of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Sussex had been kept for some time in a state of\r\ndissatisfaction, as appears from one of his letters to Cecil, by her\r\nmajesty's dilatoriness in conferring upon him such a mark of her special\r\nfavor as she had graciously promised at the conclusion of his\r\nsatisfactory defence of himself before the council; but she appeased at\r\nlength his wounded feelings, by admitting him to the council-board and\r\ngiving him the command of a strong force appointed to act on the\r\nScottish border.\r\n\r\nThe occasion for this military movement arose out of the tragical\r\nincident of the assassination of the regent Murray, which had proved the\r\nsignal for a furious inroad upon the English limits by some of the\r\nsouthern clans, who found themselves immediately released from the\r\nrestraints of an administration vigorous enough to make the lawless\r\ntremble. Sussex was ordered to chastize their insolence; and he\r\nperformed the task thoroughly and pitilessly, laying waste with fire and\r\nsword the whole obnoxious district.\r\n\r\nBesides recognising in Murray a valuable coadjutor, neighbour and ally,\r\nElizabeth appears to have loved and esteemed him as a man and a friend,\r\nand she bewailed his death with an excess of dejection honorable surely\r\nto her feelings, though regarded by some as derogatory from the dignity\r\nof her station. It was indeed an event which broke all her measures, and\r\nwhich, at a period when difficulties and dangers were besetting her on\r\nall hands, added fresh embarrassment to her perplexity and presented new\r\nchances of evil to her fears. What degree of compunction she felt for\r\nher unjustifiable detention of Mary may be doubtful; but it is certain\r\nthat her mind was now shaken with perpetual terrors and anxieties for\r\nthe consequences of that irrevocable step, and that there was nothing\r\nwhich she more earnestly desired than to transfer to other hands the\r\ncustody of so dangerous a prisoner.\r\n\r\nShe had nearly concluded an agreement for this purpose with Murray, to\r\nwhom she was to have surrendered the person of the captive queen,\r\nreceiving six Scottish noblemen as hostages for her safe keeping; and\r\nthough the interference of the French and Spanish ambassadors had\r\nobliged her to suspend its execution, there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe design was relinquished, when this unexpected stroke rendered it for\r\never impracticable. The regency of Scotland, too, was now to be\r\ncontested by the enraged factions of that distracted country, and it was\r\nof great importance to Elizabeth that the victory should fall to the\r\nparty of the young king; yet such were the perplexities of her political\r\nsituation, that it was some time before she could satisfy herself that\r\nthere would not be too great a hazard in supporting by arms the\r\nelection of the earl of Lenox, to whom she gave her interest.\r\n\r\nHer first recourse was to her favorite arts of intrigue; and she sent\r\nRandolph, her chosen instrument for these occasions, to tamper with\r\nvarious party-leaders, while Sussex, whose character inclined him more\r\nto measures of coercion, exhorted her to put an end to her irresolution\r\nand throw the sword into the scale of Lenox. She at length found reason\r\nto adopt this counsel; and the earl, re-entering Scotland with his army,\r\nlaid waste the lands and took or destroyed the castles of Mary's\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nSir William Drury, marshal of the army, was afterwards sent further into\r\nthe country to chastize the Hamiltons, of which clan was the assassin of\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary accounts of this expedition, amid many lamentable\r\nparticulars of ravages committed, afford one amusing trait of manners.\r\nLord Fleming, who held out Dumbarton castle for the queen of Scots, had\r\ndemanded a parley with sir William Drury, during which he treacherously\r\ncaused him to be fired upon; happily without effect. Sir George Cary,\r\nburning to avenge the injury offered to his commander, sent immediately\r\na letter of defiance to lord Fleming, challenging him to meet him in\r\nsingle combat on this quarrel, when, where and how he dares; concluding\r\nthus: \"Otherwise I will baffle your good name, sound with the trumpet\r\nyour dishonor, and paint your picture with the heels upward and bear it\r\nin despite of yourself.\" That this was not the only species of affront\r\nto which portraits were in these days exposed, we learn from an\r\nexpression of Ben Jonson's:--\"Take as unpardonable offence as if he had\r\ntorn your mistress's colors, or _breathed on her picture_[71].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 71: See \"Every Man out of his Humour.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Scotch war was terminated a few months after, by an agreement\r\nbetween Elizabeth and Mary, by virtue of which the former consented to\r\nwithdraw her troops from the country on the engagement of the latter\r\nthat no French forces should enter it in support of her title. After\r\nthis settlement, Elizabeth returned to her usual ambiguous dealing in\r\nthe affairs of Scotland; and so far from insisting that Lenox should be\r\nnamed regent, she sent a request to the heads of the king's party that\r\nthey would refrain for a time from the nomination of any person to that\r\noffice. In consequence of this mandate, which they dared not disobey,\r\nLenox was only chosen lieutenant for a time; an appointment which served\r\nequally well the purposes of the English queen.\r\n\r\nConnected with all the other measures adopted by the zeal of the great\r\ncatholic combination for the destruction of Elizabeth and the ruin of\r\nthe protestant cause, was one from which their own narrow prejudices or\r\nsanguine wishes, rather than any just views of the state of public\r\nopinion in England, led them to anticipate important results. This was\r\nthe publication of a papal bull solemnly anathematizing the queen, and\r\ndispensing her subjects from their oath of allegiance. A fanatic named\r\nFulton was found willing to earn the crown of martyrdom by affixing this\r\ninstrument to the gate of the bishop of London's palace. He was taken\r\nin the fact, and suffered the penalty of treason without exciting a\r\nmurmur among the people. A trifling insurrection in Norfolk ensued, of\r\nwhich however the papal bull was not openly assigned as the motive, and\r\nwhich was speedily suppressed with the punishment of a few of the\r\noffenders according to law. Even the catholic subjects of Elizabeth for\r\nthe most part abhorred the idea of lifting their hands against her\r\ngovernment and the peace of their native land; and several of them were\r\nnow found among the foremost and most sincere in their offers of service\r\nagainst the disaffected.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the result of the great trial of the hearts of her people\r\nafforded to the queen by the alarms of this anxious period, was\r\nsatisfactory beyond all example. Henceforth she knew, and the world\r\nknew, the firmness of that rock on which her throne was planted;--based\r\non religion, supported by wisdom and fortitude and adorned by every\r\nattractive art, it stood dear and venerable to her people, defying the\r\nassaults of her baffled and malignant enemies. The anniversary of her\r\naccession began this year to be celebrated by popular festivals all over\r\nthe country;--a practice which was retained not only to the end of the\r\nreign, but for many years afterwards, during which the 17th of November\r\ncontinued to be solemnly observed under designation of the Birthday of\r\nthe Gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n_Printed by R. and A.

This\r\nmerchant was Thomas Gresham. Born of a family at once enlightened,\r\nwealthy and commercial, he had shared the advantage of an education at\r\nthe university of Cambridge previously to his entrance on the walk of\r\nlife to which he was destined, and which, fortunately for himself, his\r\nsuperior acquirements did not tempt him to desert or to despise.\r\n\r\nHis father, sir Richard Gresham, had been agent to Henry VIII. for the\r\nnegotiation of loans with the merchants of Antwerp, and in 1552 he\r\nhimself was nominated to act in a similar capacity to Edward VI., when\r\nhe was eminently serviceable in redeeming the credit of the king, sunk\r\nto the lowest ebb by the mismanagement of his father's immediate\r\nsuccessor in the agency. Under Elizabeth he enjoyed the same\r\nappointment, to which was added that of queen's merchant; and it appears\r\nby the official letters of the time, that political as well as pecuniary\r\naffairs were often intrusted to his discreet and able management. He was\r\nalso a spirited promoter of the infant manufactures of his country,\r\nseveral of which owed to him their first establishment. By his diligence\r\nand commercial talents he at length rendered himself the most opulent\r\nsubject in the kingdom, and the queen showed her sense of his merit and\r\nconsequence by bestowing on him the honor of knighthood.\r\n\r\nGresham had always made a liberal and patriotic use of his wealth; but\r\nafter the death of his only son, in 1564, he formed the resolution of\r\nmaking his country his principal heir. The merchants of London had\r\nhitherto been unprovided with any building in the nature of a burse or\r\nexchange, such as Gresham had seen in the great commercial cities of\r\nFlanders; and he now munificently offered, if the city would give him a\r\npiece of ground, to build them one at his own expense. The edifice was\r\nbegun accordingly in 1566, and finished within three years. It was a\r\nquadrangle of brick, with walks on the ground floor for the merchants,\r\n(who now ceased to transact their business in the middle aisle of St.\r\nPaul's cathedral,) with vaults for warehouses beneath and a range of\r\nshops above, from the rent of which the proprietor sought some\r\nremuneration for his great charges. But the shops did not immediately\r\nfind occupants; and it seems to have been partly with the view of\r\nbringing them into vogue that the queen promised her countenance to the\r\nundertaking. In January 1571, attended by a splendid train, she entered\r\nthe city; and after dining with sir Thomas at his spacious mansion in\r\nBishopsgate-street (still remaining), she repaired to the burse, visited\r\nevery part of it, and caused proclamation to be made by sound of trumpet\r\nthat henceforth it should bear the name of the Royal Exchange. Gresham\r\noffered the shops rent-free for a year to such as would furnish them\r\nwith wares and wax lights against the coming of the queen; and a most\r\nsumptuous display was made of the richest commodities and manufactures\r\nof every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the shops of the exchange became the favorite resort of\r\nfashionable customers of both sexes: much money was squandered here,\r\nand, if we are to trust the representations of satirists and comic\r\nwriters, many reputations lost. The building was destroyed in the fire\r\nof London; and the divines of that day, according to their custom,\r\npronounced this catastrophe a judgement on the avarice and unfair\r\ndealing of the merchants and shopkeepers, and the pride, prodigality and\r\nluxury of the purchasers and idlers by whom it was frequented and\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nElizabeth soon after paid homage to merit in another form, by conferring\r\non her invaluable servant Cecil,--whose wisdom, firmness and vigilance\r\nhad most contributed to preserve her unhurt amid the machinations of her\r\nimplacable enemies,--the dignity of baron of Burleigh; an elevation\r\nwhich might provoke the envy or resentment of some of the courtiers his\r\nopponents, but which was hailed by the applauses of the people.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year, the death, at a great but not venerable\r\nage, of that corrupt and selfish statesman the marquis of Winchester,\r\nafforded her an opportunity of apportioning to the new dignity of her\r\nsecretary a suitable advance in office and emolument, by conferring on\r\nhim the post of lord-high-treasurer, which he continued to enjoy to the\r\nend of his life.\r\n\r\nOn the first of May and the two following days solemn justs were held\r\nbefore the queen at Westminster; in which the challengers were the earl\r\nof Oxford, Charles Howard, sir Henry Lee and sir Christopher\r\nHatton,--all four deserving of biographical commemoration.\r\n\r\nEdward earl of Oxford was the seventeenth of the illustrious family of\r\nVere who had borne that title, and his character presented an\r\nextraordinary union of the haughtiness, violence and impetuosity of the\r\nfeudal baron, with many of the elegant propensities and mental\r\naccomplishments which adorn the nobleman of a happier age. It was\r\nprobably to his travels in Italy that he owed his more refined tastes\r\nboth in literature and in luxury, and it was thence that he brought\r\nthose perfumed and embroidered gloves which he was the first to\r\nintroduce into England. A superb pair which he presented to her majesty\r\nwere so much approved by her, that she sat for her portrait with them on\r\nher hands. These gloves became of course highly fashionable, but those\r\nprepared in Spain were soon found to excel in scent all others; and the\r\nimportance attached to this discovery may be estimated by the following\r\ncommission given by sir Nicholas Throgmorton, then in France, to sir\r\nThomas Chaloner ambassador in Spain:--\"I pray you, good my lord\r\nambassador, send me two pair of perfumed gloves, perfumed with\r\norange-flowers and jasmin, the one for my wife's hand, the other for\r\nmine own; and wherein soever I can pleasure you with any thing in this\r\ncountry, you shall have it in recompense thereof, or else so much money\r\nas they shall cost you; provided always that they be of the best choice,\r\nwherein your judgement is inferior to none[72].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 72: \"Burleigh Papers\" by Haynes.]\r\n\r\nThe earl of Oxford enjoyed in his own times a high poetical reputation;\r\nbut his once celebrated comedies have perished, and two or three\r\nfugitive pieces inserted in collections are the only legacy bequeathed\r\nto posterity by his muse. Of these, \"The complaint of a lover wearing\r\nblack and tawny\" has ceased, in the change of manners and fashions, to\r\ninterest or affect the reader. \"Fancy and Desire\" may still lay claim to\r\nthe praise of ingenuity, though the idea is perhaps not original even\r\nhere, and has since been exhibited with very considerable improvements\r\nboth in French and English, especially in Ben Jonson's celebrated song,\r\n\"Tell me where was Fancy bred?\" Two or three stanzas may bear quotation.\r\n\r\n    \"Where wert thou born Desire?\"\r\n    \"In pomp and pride of May.\"\r\n    \"By whom sweet boy wert thou begot?\"\r\n    \"By Fond Conceit men say.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me who was thy nurse?\"\r\n    \"Fresh Youth in sugred joy.\"\r\n    \"What was thy meat and daily food?\"\r\n    \"Sad sighs with great annoy.\"\r\n\r\n    \"What had'st thou then to drink?\"\r\n    \"Unsavoury lovers' tears.\"\r\n    \"What cradle wert thou rocked in?\"\r\n    \"In hope devoid of fears.\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn the chivalrous exercises of the tilt and tournament the earl of\r\nOxford had few superiors: he was victor in the justs both of this year\r\nand of the year 1580, and on the latter occasion he was led by two\r\nladies into the presence-chamber, all armed as he was, to receive a\r\nprize from her majesty's own hand. Afterwards, by gross misconduct, he\r\nincurred from his sovereign a disgrace equally marked and public, being\r\ncommitted to the Tower for an attempt on one of her maids of honor. On\r\nother occasions his lawless propensities broke out with a violence which\r\nElizabeth herself was scarcely able to restrain.\r\n\r\nHe had openly begun to muster his friends, retainers and servants, to\r\ntake vengeance on sir Thomas Knevet, by whom he had been wounded in a\r\nduel; and the queen, who interfered to prevent the execution of this\r\nsavage design, was obliged for some time to appoint Knevet a guard in\r\norder to secure his life. He also publicly insulted sir Philip Sidney in\r\nthe tennis-court of the palace; and her majesty could discover no other\r\nmeans of preventing fatal consequences than compelling sir Philip\r\nSidney, as the inferior in rank, to compromise the quarrel on terms\r\nwhich he regarded as so inequitable and degrading, that after\r\ntransmitting to her majesty a spirited remonstrance against encouraging\r\nthe insolence of the great nobles, he retired to Penshurst in disgust.\r\nThe duke of Norfolk was the nephew of this earl of Oxford, who was very\r\nstrongly attached to him, and used the utmost urgency of entreaty with\r\nBurleigh, whose daughter he had married, to prevail on him to procure\r\nhis pardon: \"but not succeeding,\" says lord Orford, \"he was so incensed\r\nagainst that minister, that in most absurd and unjust revenge (though\r\nthe cause was amiable) he swore he would do all he could to ruin his\r\ndaughter; and accordingly not only forsook her bed, but sold and\r\nconsumed great part of the vast inheritance descended to him from his\r\nancestors[73].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 73: \"Royal and Noble Authors.\"]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable person died very aged early in the reign of James I.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Howard, eldest son of lord Howard of Effingham, was at this\r\nperiod of his life chiefly remarkable for the uncommon beauty of his\r\nperson,--a species of merit never overlooked by her majesty,--for grace\r\nand agility in his exercises, and for the manners of an accomplished\r\ncourtier. At no time was he regarded as a person of profound judgement,\r\nand of vanity and self-consequence he is said to have possessed an\r\nabundant share. He was however brave, courteous, liberal, and diligent\r\nin affairs; and the favor of the queen admitted him in 1585 to succeed\r\nhis father in the office of lord-high-admiral. His intrepid bearing, in\r\nthe year 1588, encouraged his sailors to meet the terrible Armada with\r\nstout hearts and cheerful countenances, and the glory of its defeat was\r\nas much his own as the participation of winds and waves would allow. In\r\nconsideration of this distinguished piece of service he was created earl\r\nof Nottingham; and the queen's partiality towards her relations\r\nincreasing with her years, he became towards the end of the reign one of\r\nthe most considerable persons at her court, where his hostility to Essex\r\ngrew equally notorious with the better grounded antipathy entertained by\r\nSussex, also a royal kinsman, against Leicester, the earlier favorite of\r\nher majesty.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Nottingham survived to the year 1624, the 88th of his age.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lee was one of the finest courtiers and certainly the most\r\ncomplete knight-errant of his time. He was now in the fortieth year of\r\nhis age, had travelled, and had seen some military service; but the\r\ntilt-yard was ever the scene of his most conspicuous exploits and those\r\nin which he placed his highest glory. He had declared himself the\r\nqueen's own knight and champion, and having inscribed upon his shield\r\nthe constellation of Ariadne's Crown, culminant in her majesty's\r\nnativity, bound himself by a solemn vow to appear armed in the tilt-yard\r\non every anniversary of her happy accession till disabled by age. This\r\nvow gave origin to the annual exercises of the Knights-Tilters, a\r\nsociety consisting of twenty-five of the most gallant and favored of the\r\ncourtiers of Elizabeth. The modern reader may wonder to find included in\r\nthis number so grave an officer as Bromley lord chancellor; but under\r\nthe maiden reign neither the deepest statesman, the most studious\r\nlawyer, nor the rudest soldier was exempted from the humiliating\r\nobligation of accepting, and even soliciting, those household and menial\r\noffices usually discharged by mere courtiers, nor from the irksome one\r\nof assuming, for the sake of their sovereign lady, the romantic disguise\r\nof armed champions and enamoured knights. Sir Henry Lee, however,\r\nappears to have devoted his life to these chivalrous pageantries rather\r\nfrom a quixotical imagination than with any serious views of ambition or\r\ninterest. He was a gentleman of ancient family and plentiful fortune,\r\nlittle connected, as far as appears, with any court faction or\r\npolitical, party, and neither capable nor ambitious of any public\r\nstation of importance. It is an amiable and generous trait of his\r\ncharacter, that he attended the unfortunate duke of Norfolk even to the\r\nscaffold, received his last embrace, and repeated to the assembled\r\nmultitude his request that they would assist him with their prayers in\r\nhis final agony. His royal Dulcinea rewarded his fatigues and his\r\nadoration by the lieutenancy of Woodstock manor, the office of keeper of\r\nthe armoury, and especially by the appropriate meed of admission into\r\nthe most noble order of the Garter. He resigned the championship at the\r\napproach of old age with a solemn ceremony hereafter to be described,\r\ndied at his mansion of Quarendon in Bucks, in 1611, in his 81st year,\r\nand was interred in the parish church under a splendid tomb hung round\r\nwith military trophies, and inscribed with a very long, very quaint and\r\nvery tumid epitaph.\r\n\r\nChristopher Hatton, the last of this undaunted band of challengers, was\r\na new competitor for the smiles of royalty, and bright was the dawn of\r\nfortune and of favor which already broke upon him. He was of a decayed\r\nfamily of Northamptonshire gentry, and had just commenced the study of\r\nthe law at one of the inns of court, when hope or curiosity stimulated\r\nhim to gain admittance at some court-festival, where he had an\r\nopportunity of dancing before the queen in a mask. His figure and his\r\nperformance so captivated her fancy, that she immediately bestowed upon\r\nhim some flattering marks of attention, which encouraged him to quit his\r\nprofession and turn courtier.\r\n\r\nThis showy outside and these gay accomplishments were unexpectedly found\r\nin union with a moderate and cautious temper, enlightened views, and a\r\nsolid understanding; and after due deliberation, Elizabeth, that\r\npenetrating judge of men, decided, in spite of ridicule, that she could\r\nnot do better than make this superlatively-excellent dancer of galliards\r\nher lord-chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Hatton are said to have promoted this appointment in\r\nexpectation of his disgracing himself by ignorance and incapacity; but\r\ntheir malice was disappointed; whatever he did not know, he was able to\r\nlearn and willing to be taught; he discharged the duties of his high\r\noffice with prudence first and afterwards with ability, and died in 1591\r\nin possession of it and of the public esteem. It is remarkable,\r\nconsidering the general predilection of the queen in favor of celibacy,\r\nthat Hatton was the only one of her ministers who lived and died a\r\nbachelor.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year the king of France married a daughter of the emperor\r\nMaximilian; and Elizabeth, desirous at this time of being on the best\r\nterms both with the French and Imperial courts, sent lord Buckhurst to\r\nParis on a splendid embassy of congratulation.\r\n\r\nCatherine de' Medici took this opportunity of renewing proposals of\r\nmarriage to the queen of England on the part of her son the duke of\r\nAnjou, and they were listened to with an apparent complacency which\r\nperplexed the politicians. It is certainly to this negotiation, and to\r\nthe intrigues of the duke of Norfolk and other nobles with the queen of\r\nScots, that Shakespear alludes in the following ingenious and exquisite\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n    ...\"Once I sat upon a promontory,\r\n    And heard a _Mermaid_ on a _Dolphin_'s back\r\n    Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,\r\n    That the rude sea grew civil at her song;\r\n    And _certain stars shot madly from their spheres_,\r\n    To hear the sea-maid's music.\r\n\r\n    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n    That very time I saw, but thou could'st not,\r\n    Flying between the cold moon and the earth,\r\n    Cupid all-arm'd: a certain aim he took\r\n    At _a fair Vestal throned by the West_,\r\n    And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,\r\n    As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;\r\n    But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\r\n    Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watry moon,\r\n    And the Imperial Votress passed on,\r\n    In maiden meditation, fancy-free.\"\r\n\r\n    _Midsummer Night's Dream._\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for himself, the duke of Norfolk had not acquired, even\r\nfrom the severe admonition of a long imprisonment, resolution sufficient\r\nto turn a deaf ear to the enchantments of this syren. His situation was\r\nindeed perplexing: He had entered into the most serious engagements with\r\nhis sovereign to abstain from all further intercourse with the queen of\r\nScots: at the same time the right of Elizabeth to interdict him an\r\nalliance so flattering to his vanity might plausibly be questioned, and\r\nthe previous interchange between himself and Mary of solemn promises of\r\nmarriage, seemed to have brought him under obligations to her too\r\nsacred to be dissolved by any subsequent stipulation of his, though one\r\nto which Mary herself had been compelled to become a party. Neither had\r\nchivalrous ideas by any means lost their force in this age; and as a\r\nknight and a gentleman the duke must have esteemed himself bound in\r\nhonor to procure the release of the captive princess, and to claim\r\nthrough all perils the fair hand which had been plighted to him.\r\nImpressed by such sentiments, he returned to a letter of eloquent\r\ncomplaint which she found means to convey to him, an answer filled with\r\nassurances of his inviolable constancy; and the intrigues of the party\r\nwere soon renewed with as much activity as ever.\r\n\r\nBut the vigilance of the ministry of Elizabeth could not long be eluded.\r\nAn important packet of letters written by Ridolfi, a Florentine who had\r\nbeen sent abroad by the party to confer with the pope and with the duke\r\nof Alva, was intercepted; and in consequence of the plots thus unfolded,\r\nthe bishop of Ross, who bore the character of Mary's ambassador in\r\nEngland, was given into private custody. Soon after, a servant of the\r\nduke's, intrusted by him with the conveyance of a sum of money from the\r\nFrench ambassador to Mary's adherents in Scotland, carried the parcel\r\ncontaining it to the secretary of state. The duke's secretary was then\r\nsent for and examined. This man, who was probably in the pay of\r\ngovernment, not only confessed with readiness all that he knew, but\r\nproduced some letters from the queen of Scots which his lord had\r\ncommanded him to burn after decyphering them. Other concurring\r\nindications of the duke's guilt appearing, he was recommitted to the\r\nTower in September 1571.\r\n\r\nAfter various consultations of civilians on the extent of an\r\nambassador's privilege, and the title which the agent of a deposed\r\nsovereign might have to avail himself of that sacred character, it was\r\ndetermined that the laws of nations did not protect the bishop of Ross,\r\nand he was carried to the Tower, where, in fear of death, he made full\r\nconfession of all his machinations against the person and state of\r\nElizabeth. In the most guilty parts of these designs he affirmed that\r\nthe duke had constantly refused his concurrence;--and in fact, weak and\r\ninfatuated as he was, the agents of Mary seem to have found it\r\nimpracticable, by all their artifices, to bring this unfortunate\r\nnobleman entirely to forget that he was a protestant and an Englishman.\r\nHe would never consent directly to procure the death or dethronement of\r\nElizabeth; though it must have been perfectly evident to any man of\r\nclear and unbiassed judgement, that, under all the circumstances, the\r\naccomplishment of his wishes could by no other means be attained.\r\n\r\nThis affair was regarded in so very serious a light, that the queen\r\nthought it necessary, before the duke was put on his trial, to lay all\r\nthe circumstances of his case before the court of France; and the\r\nparliament, which was again assembled after an interval of five years,\r\npassed some new laws for the protection of the queen's person from the\r\nimminent perils by which they saw her environed.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious prisoner was now brought before the tribunal of his\r\nbrother-peers; and a perfectly fair and regular trial, according to the\r\npractices of that age, was accorded him. Whatever his intentions might\r\nhave been, his actions appear to have come clearly within the limits of\r\ntreason; and the earl of Shrewsbury, as lord-high-steward for the day,\r\npronounced upon him, with tears, a verdict of Guilty. But the queen\r\nhesitated or deferred, from clemency or caution, to sign his death\r\nwarrant, and he was remanded to the Tower under some uncertainty whether\r\nor not the last rigor of the offended laws awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe name of sir Nicholas Throgmorton was so mixed up in the confessions\r\nof the bishop of Ross, that it was perhaps an indulgent fate which had\r\nremoved him some months previously from the sphere of human action. He\r\ndied at the house of the earl of Leicester, and certainly of a pleurisy;\r\nbut the malevolent credulity of that age seldom allowed a person of any\r\neminence to quit the world without imputing the occurrence in some\r\nmanner, direct or indirect, to the malice of his enemies. It was rumored\r\nthat Throgmorton had fallen a victim to the hostility of Leicester,\r\nwhich he was thought to have provoked by quitting the party of the earl\r\nto reconcile himself with Burleigh, his secret enemy; and the suspicion\r\nof proficiency in the art of poisoning, which had so long rested upon\r\nthe favorite, obtained credit to this absurd report. Possibly there\r\nmight be more truth in the general opinion, that it was in some measure\r\nowing to the enmity of Burleigh that a person of such acknowledged\r\nabilities in public affairs, and one who had conducted himself so\r\nskilfully in various important negotiations, should never have been\r\nadvanced to any considerable office of trust or profit. But the lofty\r\nand somewhat turbulent spirit of Throgmorton himself, ought probably to\r\nbear the chief blame both of this enmity, and of his want of success at\r\nthe court of a princess who exacted from her servants the exercise of\r\nthe most refined and cautious policy, as well as an entire and implicit\r\nsubmission to all her views and wishes. It is highly probable that she\r\nnever entirely pardoned Throgmorton for giving the lie to her\r\ndeclarations respecting the promises made to the earl of Murray and his\r\nparty, by the open production of his own diplomatic instructions.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of Leicester extended, as we shall see hereafter, to other\r\nbranches of the unfortunate family of Throgmorton, whom an imprudent or\r\ncriminal zeal in the cause of popery exposed without defence to the\r\nwhole weight of his vengeance. On some slight pretext he procured the\r\ndismissal of sir John Throgmorton, the brother of sir Nicholas; from his\r\noffice of chief justice of Chester, who did not long survive the\r\ndisgrace though apparently unmerited. Puttenham, author of the \"Art of\r\nEnglish Poesie,\" ventured, though a professed courtier, to compose an\r\nepitaph on this victim of oppression, of which he has preserved to us\r\nthe following lines in the work above mentioned:\r\n\r\n    \"Whom Virtue reared Envy hath overthrown,\r\n    And lodged full low under this marble stone:\r\n    Ne never were his values so well known\r\n    Whilst he lived here, as now that he is gone.\r\n\r\n    No sun by day that ever saw him rest\r\n    Free from the toils of his so busy charge,\r\n    No night that harboured rancour in his breast,\r\n    Nor merry mood made Reason run at large.\r\n\r\n    His head a source of gravity and sense,\r\n    His memory a shop of civil art:\r\n    His tongue a stream of sugred eloquence,\r\n    Wisdom and meekness lay mingled in his heart.\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe literary propensities of Elizabeth have already come under our\r\nnotice: they had frequently served to divert her mind from the cares of\r\ngovernment; but in the state of unremitted anxiety occasioned by her\r\ndread of the machinations relative to the queen of Scots, in which she\r\nhad found the first peer of her realm a principal actor, her thoughts,\r\neven in the few leisure hours which she found means to bestow on these\r\nsoothing recreations, still hovered about the objects from which she\r\nmost sought to withdraw them.\r\n\r\nThe following sonnet of her composition will illustrate this remark: it\r\nwas published during her lifetime in Puttenham's \"Arte of English\r\nPoesie,\" and its authenticity, its principal merit, has never been\r\ncalled in question.\r\n\r\n    SONNET _by Queen Elizabeth_.\r\n\r\n       The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy,\r\n    And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy.\r\n       For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects' faith doth ebb;\r\n    Which would not be if Reason ruled, or Wisdom weaved the web.\r\n       But clouds of toys untried do cloak aspiring minds,\r\n    Which turn to rain of late repent by course of changed winds.\r\n       The top of hope supposed the root of ruth will be;\r\n    And fruitless all their graffed guiles, as shortly ye shall see.\r\n       Those dazzled eves with pride, which great ambition blinds,\r\n    Shall be unseal'd by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds.\r\n       The Daughter of Debate that eke discord doth sow,\r\n    Shall reap no gain where former rule hath taught still peace to grow.\r\n       No foreign banish'd wight shall anchor in this port;\r\n    Our realm it brooks no strangers' force, let them elsewhere resort.\r\n       Our rusty sword with rest shall first his edge employ,\r\n       To poll their tops that seek such change, and gape for joy.\r\n\r\nThe house of commons, in which great dread and hatred of the queen of\r\nScots and her adherents now prevailed, showed itself strongly disposed\r\nto pass an act by which Mary should be declared for ever unworthy and\r\nincapable of the English succession: but Elizabeth, with her usual\r\naverseness to all unqualified declarations and irrevocable decisions,\r\ninterfered to prevent the completion of a measure which most sovereigns,\r\nunder all the circumstances, would have been eager to embrace. To the\r\nunanimous expression of the opinion of the house, that the execution of\r\nthe sentence against the duke of Norfolk ought not to be longer delayed,\r\nshe was however prevailed upon to lend a more favorable ear; and on June\r\n2d, 1572, this nobleman received his death on Tower-hill.\r\n\r\nNorfolk was a man of many amiable and several estimable qualities, and\r\nmuch too good for the faction with which he had been enticed to act and\r\nthe cause in which he suffered. On the scaffold he acknowledged, with\r\ngreat apparent sincerity, the justice of his sentence, and his peculiar\r\nguiltiness in breaking the solemn promise which he had pledged to his\r\nsovereign. He declared himself to have been an earnest protestant ever\r\nsince he had had any taste for religion, and in this faith he died very\r\ndevoutly. He bequeathed by his will his best George to his kinsman and\r\ntrue friend the earl of Sussex, whose faithful counsels he too late\r\nreproached himself with neglecting. By his attainder the dukedom was\r\nlost to the family of Howard; but Philip, his eldest son, succeeded his\r\nmaternal grandfather in the earldom of Arundel; lord Thomas, his second\r\nson, (whose mother was the daughter and heiress of lord Audley,) was\r\ncreated lord Howard of Walden by Elizabeth and earl of Suffolk by James;\r\nand lord William, the youngest, who possessed Naworth-castle in right of\r\nElizabeth Dacre his wife, and was known upon the West Border (of which\r\nhe was warden) by the appellation of \"Belted Will,\" was ancestor to the\r\nearls of Carlisle[74].\r\n\r\n[Note 74:\r\n\r\n    \"His Bilboa blade, by marchmen felt,\r\n    Hung in a broad and studded belt;\r\n    Hence in rude phrase the Borderers still\r\n    Call noble Howard Belted Will.\"\r\n\r\n    Lay of the Last Minstrel.]\r\n\r\nThe king of Spain had long been regarded in England as the most\r\nimplacable and formidable of the enemies of Elizabeth; and on good\r\ngrounds. It was believed to be through his procurement that Sixtus V.\r\nhad been led to fulminate his anathema against her;--it was well known\r\nthat the pope had made a donation to him of the kingdom of Ireland, of\r\nwhich he was anxious to avail himself;--there was strong ground to\r\nsuspect that he had sent one of his ablest generals in embassy to\r\nEngland with no other view than to have taken the command of the\r\nnorthern rebels, had their enterprise prospered;--and the intimate\r\nparticipation of his agents in all the intrigues of the queen of Scots\r\nwas notorious. Dr. Wylson, a learned civilian, an accomplished scholar,\r\nand one of the first refiners of English prose, had published in 1571,\r\nwith the express view of rousing the spirit of his readers against this\r\nformidable tyrant, a version of the Orations of Demosthenes against the\r\nking Philip of his day, and had been at the pains of pointing out in the\r\nnotes coincidences in the situation of Athens and of England. The\r\nauthor, who was an earnest protestant, had the further motive in this\r\nwork of paying a tribute to the memory of the learned and unfortunate\r\nCheke, who during his voluntary exile had read gratuitous lectures to\r\nhis countrymen at Padua on the works of the great Grecian orator, of\r\nwhich Wylson had been an auditor, and who had also made a Latin version\r\nof them, of which the English translator freely availed himself.\r\n\r\nIt was principally her dread of the Spaniards which led Elizabeth into\r\nthose perpetual reciprocations of deceitful professions and empty\r\nnegotiations with the profligate and perfidious court of France, which\r\nin the judgement of posterity have redounded so little to her honor, but\r\nwhich appeared to her of so much importance that she now thought herself\r\npeculiarly fortunate in having discovered an agent capable of conducting\r\nwith all the wariness, penetration and profound address so peculiarly\r\nrequisite where sincerity and good faith are wanting. This agent was sir\r\nFrancis Walsingham, whose rare acquisitions of political knowledge, made\r\nprincipally during the period of his voluntary exile for religion, and\r\nstill rarer talents for public business, had induced lord Burleigh to\r\nrecommend him to the service and confidence of his mistress. For several\r\nyears from this time he resided as the queen's ambassador at the court\r\nof France, at first as coadjutor to sir Thomas Smith,--a learned and\r\nable man, who afterwards became a principal secretary of state,--the\r\nrest of the time alone. There was not in England a man who was regarded\r\nas a more sincere and earnest protestant than Walsingham; yet such was\r\nat this time his sense of the importance to the country of the French\r\nalliance, that he expressed himself strongly in favor of the match\r\nbetween Elizabeth and the duke of Anjou, and, as a minister, spared no\r\npains to promote it.\r\n\r\nSimilar language was held on this subject both by Leicester and\r\nBurleigh; but the former was perhaps no more in earnest on the subject\r\nthan his mistress; and finally all parties, except the French\r\nprotestants, who looked to the conclusion of these nuptials as their\r\nbest security, seem to have been not ill pleased when, the marriage\r\ntreaty being at length laid aside, a strict league of amity between the\r\ntwo countries was agreed upon in its stead.\r\n\r\nSplendid embassies were reciprocally sent to receive the ratifications\r\nof this treaty; and Burleigh writes to a friend, between jest and\r\nearnest, that an unexpected delay of the French ambassador was cursed by\r\nall the husbands whose ladies had been detained at great expense and\r\ninconvenience in London, to contribute to the splendor of the court on\r\nhis reception. On the 9th of June 1572 the duke de Montmorenci and his\r\nsuite at length arrived. His entertainment was magnificent; all seemed\r\npeace and harmony between the rival nations; and Elizabeth even\r\ninstructed her ambassadors to give favorable ear to a hint which the\r\nqueen-mother had dropped of a matrimonial treaty between the queen of\r\nEngland and her youngest son, the duke d'Alencon, who had then scarcely\r\nattained the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\nLulled by these flattering appearances of tranquillity, her majesty set\r\nout on her summer progress, and she was enjoying the festivities\r\nprepared by Leicester for her reception at his splendid castle of\r\nKennelworth, when news arrived of the execrable massacre of Paris;--an\r\natrocity not to be paralleled in history! Troops of affrighted Hugonots,\r\nwho had escaped through a thousand perils with life, and life alone,\r\nfrom the hands of their pitiless assassins, arrived on the English\r\ncoast, imploring the commiseration of their brother protestants, and\r\nrelating in accents of despair their tale of horrors. After such a\r\nstroke, no one knew what to expect; the German protestants flew to\r\narms; even the subjects of Elizabeth trembled for their countrymen\r\ntravelling on the continent and for themselves in their island-home. The\r\npope applauded openly the savage deed; the court of Spain showed itself\r\nunited hand and heart with that of France,--to the astonishment of\r\nElizabeth, who had been taught to believe them at enmity;--and it seemed\r\nas if the signal had been given of a general crusade against the\r\nreformed churches of Europe.\r\n\r\nFor several days fears were entertained for the safety of Walsingham\r\nhimself, who had not dared to transmit any account of the event except\r\none by a servant of his own, whose passage had been by some accident\r\ndelayed. Even this minister, cautious and crafty and sagacious as he\r\nwas, assisted by all the spies whom he constantly kept in pay, had been\r\nunable to penetrate any part of the bloody secret;--he was completely\r\ntaken by surprise. But of his personal safety the perfidious young king\r\nand his detestable mother were, for their own sakes, careful; and not\r\nonly were himself and his servants protected from injury, but every\r\nEnglishman who had the presence of mind to take shelter in his house\r\nfound it an inviolable sanctuary. Two persons only of this nation fell\r\nvictims to the fury of that direful night, but the property of many was\r\nplundered. The afflicted remnant of the French protestants prepared to\r\nstand upon their defence with all the intrepidity of despair. They\r\nclosed the gates of Rochelle, their strong hold, against the king's\r\ntroops, casting at the same time an imploring eye towards England,\r\nwhere thousands of brave and generous spirits were burning with\r\nimpatience to hasten to their succour.\r\n\r\nNo act would have been hailed with such loud and general applause of her\r\npeople as an instant renunciation by Elizabeth of all friendship and\r\nintercourse with the perjured and blood-stained Charles, the midnight\r\nassassin of his own subjects; and it is impossible to contemplate\r\nwithout disdain the coldness and littleness of that character which, in\r\nsuch a case, could consent to measure its demonstrations of indignation\r\nand abhorrence by the narrow rules of a self-interested caution. But\r\nthat early experience of peril and adversity which had formed the mind\r\nof this princess to penetration, wariness, and passive courage, and\r\ngiven her a perfect command of the whole art of simulation and\r\ndissimulation, had at the same time robbed her of some of the noblest\r\nimpulses of our nature; of generosity, of ardor, of enterprise, of\r\nmagnanimity. Where more exalted spirits would only have felt, she\r\ncalculated; where bolder ones would have flown to action, she contented\r\nherself with words.\r\n\r\nCharles and his mother, while still in uncertainty how far their\r\nmaster-stroke of policy,--so they regarded it,--would be successful in\r\ncrushing entirely the Hugonots, prudently resolved to spare no efforts\r\nto preserve Elizabeth their friend, or to prevent her at least from\r\nbecoming an open enemy. Instructions had therefore been in the first\r\ninstance dispatched to La Mothe Fenelon, the French ambassador in\r\nEngland, to communicate such an account of the massacre and its motives\r\nas suited these views, and to solicit a confirmation of the late treaty\r\nof amity. His reception at court on this occasion was extremely solemn:\r\nthe courtiers and ladies who lined the rooms leading to the\r\npresence-chamber were all habited in deep mourning, and not one of them\r\nwould vouchsafe a word or a smile to the ambassador, though himself a\r\nman of honor, and one whom they had formerly received on the footing of\r\ncordial intimacy. The queen herself, in listening to his message,\r\nassumed an aspect more composed, but extremely cold and serious. She\r\nexpressed her horror at the idea that a sovereign could imagine himself\r\nunder a necessity of taking such vengeance on his own subjects;\r\nrepresented the practicability of proceeding with them according to law,\r\nand desired to be better informed of the reality of the treasonable\r\ndesigns imputed to the Hugonots. She also declared that it would be\r\ndifficult for her to place reliance hereafter on the friendship of a\r\nprince who had shown himself so deadly a foe to those who professed her\r\nreligion; but, at the suit of the ambassador, she consented to suspend\r\nin some degree her judgement of the deed till further information.\r\n\r\nEven these feeble demonstrations of sensibility to crime so enormous\r\nwere speedily laid aside. In spite of Walsingham's declared opinion,\r\nthat the demonstrations of the French court towards her were so\r\nevidently treacherous that its open enmity was less to be dreaded than\r\nits feigned friendship, Elizabeth suffered her indignation to evaporate\r\nin a few severe speeches, restrained her subjects from carrying such aid\r\nto the defenders of Rochelle as could be made a ground of serious\r\nquarrel, and even permitted a renewal of the shocking and monstrous\r\novertures for her marriage with the youngest son of Catherine de' Medici\r\nherself. By this shameless woman various proposals were now made for\r\nbringing about a personal interview between herself and Elizabeth. She\r\nfirst named England as the place of meeting, then the sea between Dover\r\nand Calais, and afterwards the isle of Jersey; but from the first plan\r\nshe herself departed, and the others were rejected in anger by the\r\nEnglish council, who remarked, with a proper and laudable spirit, that\r\nthey who had ventured upon such propositions must imagine them strangely\r\ncareless of the personal safety of their sovereign.\r\n\r\nCharles IX. was particularly anxious that Elizabeth, as a pledge of\r\nfriendship, should consent to stand sponsor to his new-born daughter;\r\nand with this request, after some difficulties and a few declarations of\r\nhorror at his conduct, she had the baseness to comply. She refused\r\nhowever to indulge that king in his further desire, that she would\r\nappoint either the earl of Leicester or lord Burleigh as her proxy;--not\r\nchoosing apparently to trust these pillars of state and of the\r\nprotestant cause within his reach; and she sent instead her cousin the\r\nearl of Worcester, \"a good simple gentleman,\" as Leicester called him,\r\nand a catholic.\r\n\r\nAll this time Elizabeth was in her heart as hostile to the court of\r\nFrance as the most zealous of her protestant subjects; for she well knew\r\nthat it was and ever must be essentially hostile to her and her\r\ngovernment; and in the midst of her civilities she took care to supply\r\nto the Hugonots such secret aids as should enable them still to\r\npersevere in a formidable resistance.\r\n\r\nIt is worth recording, on the subject of these negotiations between\r\nElizabeth and the royal family of France, that Burleigh seems to have\r\nbeen encouraged to expect a successful issue by a calculation of the\r\nqueen's nativity, seen by Strype in his own handwriting, from which it\r\nwas foretold that she should marry, in middle life, a foreign prince\r\nyounger than herself; and probably be the mother of a son, who should be\r\nprosperous in his middle age. Catherine de' Medici also, to whom some\r\nfemale fortune-teller had predicted that all her sons should be kings,\r\nhoped, after the election of her second son to the throne of Poland, to\r\nfind the full accomplishment of the prophecy in the advancement of the\r\nyoungest to the matrimonial crown of England. So serious was the belief\r\nof that age in the lying oracles of judicial astrology!\r\n\r\nAmong the English travellers doomed to be eye-witnesses of the horrors\r\nof the massacre of St. Bartholomew was the celebrated Philip Sidney,\r\nthen a youth of eighteen. He was the eldest son of sir Henry Sidney,\r\nlord-deputy of Ireland, and from this excellent man and parent he had\r\nreceived, amongst his earliest and strongest impressions, those elevated\r\nprinciples of honor, veracity and moral purity which regulated and\r\nadorned the whole tenor of his after-life. An extraordinary solidity of\r\ncharacter with great vivacity of parts had distinguished him from a\r\nchild, and fortune conspired with genius to bring him early before the\r\npublic eye.\r\n\r\nHe was nephew and presumptive heir to the earl of Leicester, by whom he\r\nwas in a manner adopted; and thus patronized, his rapid advancement was\r\nanticipated as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice of that day for parents in higher life to dispose of\r\ntheir children in marriage at an age now justly accounted immature[75];\r\nand no sooner had young Sidney completed his fourteenth year than\r\narrangements were made for his union with Anne Cecil, daughter of the\r\nsecretary. Why the connexion never took place we do not learn: sir Henry\r\nSidney in a letter to Cecil says, with reference to this affair; \"I am\r\nsorry that you find coldness any where in proceeding, where such good\r\nliking appeared in the beginning; but, for my part, I was never more\r\nready to perfect that affair than presently I am.\" &c. Shortly after,\r\nthe lady, unfortunately for herself, became the wife of the earl of\r\nOxford; and Sidney, still unfettered by matrimonial engagements,\r\nobtained license to travel, and reached Paris in May 1572. Charles IX.,\r\nin consideration no doubt of the influence of his uncle at the English\r\ncourt, gave him the appointment of a gentleman of his bed-chamber, a\r\nfortnight only before the massacre. On that night of horrors Sidney\r\ntook shelter in the house of Walsingham, and thus escaped all personal\r\ndanger; but his after-conduct fully proved how indelible was the\r\nimpression left upon his mind of the monstrous wickedness of the French\r\nroyal family, and the disgrace and misery which an alliance with it must\r\nentail on his queen and country.\r\n\r\n[Note 75: Thus we find sir George Manners, ancestor of the dukes of\r\nRutland, who died in 1513, bequeathing to each of his unmarried\r\ndaughters a portion of three hundred marks to be paid at the time of\r\ntheir marriage, or within _four_ years after if the husband be not\r\ntwenty-one years of age; or at such time as the husband came of age.\r\n\r\nCollins's \"Peerage,\" by sir E. Brydges.]\r\n\r\nHe readily obeyed his uncle's directions to quit France without delay;\r\nand, proceeding to Frankfort, there formed a highly honorable and\r\nbeneficial friendship with the virtuous Hubert Languet, who opened to\r\nhim at once his heart and his purse. The remonstrances of this patron,\r\nwho dreaded to excess for his youthful friend the artifices of the papal\r\ncourt, deterred him from extending his travels to Rome, an omission\r\nwhich he afterwards deeply regretted; but a leisurely survey of the\r\nnorthern cities of Italy, during which he became advantageously known to\r\nmany eminent characters, occupied him profitably and delightfully till\r\nhis return to his native country in 1575, after which he will again\r\noccur to our notice as the pride and wonder of the English court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1573 TO 1577.\r\n\r\nLetters of lord Talbot to his father.--Connexion of Leicester with lady\r\nSheffield.--Anecdote of the queen and Mr. Dyer.--Queen suspicions of\r\nBurleigh.--Countesses of Lenox and Shrewsbury imprisoned.--Queen refuses\r\nthe sovereignty of Holland.--Her remarkable speech to the\r\ndeputies.--Alchemy.--Notice of Dr. Dee--of Frobisher.--Family of\r\nLove.--Burning of two Anabaptists.--Entertainment of the queen at\r\nKennelworth.--Notice of Walter earl of Essex.--General favor towards his\r\nson Robert.--Letter of the queen to the earl of Shrewsbury respecting\r\nLeicester.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as had been the injustice committed by Elizabeth in the detention\r\nof the queen of Scots, it must be confessed that the offence brought\r\nwith it its own sufficient punishment in the fears, jealousies and\r\ndisquiets which it entailed upon her.\r\n\r\nWhere Mary was concerned, the most approved loyalty, the longest course\r\nof faithful service, and the truest attachment to the protestant cause,\r\nwere insufficient pledges to her oppressor of the fidelity of her nobles\r\nor ministers. The earl of Shrewsbury, whom she had deliberately selected\r\nfrom all others to be the keeper of the captive queen, and whose\r\nvigilance had now for so long a period baffled all attempts for her\r\ndeliverance, was, to the last, unable so to establish himself in the\r\nconfidence of his sovereign as to be exempt from such starts of\r\nsuspicion and fits of displeasure as kept him in a state of continual\r\napprehension. Feeling with acuteness all the difficulties of his\r\nsituation, this nobleman judged it expedient to cause Gilbert lord\r\nTalbot, his eldest son, to remain in close attendance on the motions of\r\nthe queen; charging him to study with unremitting attention all the\r\nintrigues of the court, on which in that day so much depended, and to\r\nacquaint him with them frequently and minutely. To this precaution of\r\nthe earl's we owe several extant letters of lord Talbot, which throw\r\nconsiderable light on the minor incidents of the time.\r\n\r\nIn May 1573, this diligent news-gatherer acquaints his father, that the\r\nearl of Leicester was much with her majesty, that he was more than\r\nformerly solicitous to please her, and that he was as high in favor as\r\never: but that two sisters, lady Sheffield and lady Frances Howard, were\r\ndeeply in love with him and at great variance with each other; that the\r\nqueen was on this account very angry with them, and not well pleased\r\nwith him, and that spies were set upon him. To such open demonstrations\r\nof feminine jealousy did this great queen condescend to have recourse!\r\nYet she remained all her life in ignorance of the true state of this\r\naffair, which, in fact, is not perfectly cleared up at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a criminal intimacy was known to subsist between\r\nLeicester and lady Sheffield even before the death of her lord, in\r\nconsequence of which, this event, which was sudden, and preceded it is\r\nsaid by violent symptoms, was popularly attributed to the Italian arts\r\nof Leicester. During this year, lady Sheffield bore him a son, whose\r\nbirth was carefully concealed for fear of giving offence to the queen,\r\nthough many believed that a private marriage had taken place. Afterwards\r\nhe forsook the mother of his child to marry the countess of Essex, and\r\nthe deserted lady became the wife of another. In the reign of James I.,\r\nmany years after the death of Leicester, sir Robert Dudley his son, to\r\nwhom he had left a great part of his fortune, laid claim to the family\r\nhonors, bringing several witnesses to prove his mother's marriage, and\r\namong others his mother herself. This lady declared on oath that\r\nLeicester, in order to compel her to form that subsequent marriage in\r\nhis lifetime which must deprive her of the power of claiming him as her\r\nhusband, had employed the most violent menaces, and had even attempted\r\nher life by a poisonous potion which had thrown her into an illness by\r\nwhich she lost her hair and nails. After the production of all this\r\nevidence, the heirs of Leicester exerted all their interest to stop\r\nproceedings;--no great argument of the goodness of their cause;--and sir\r\nRobert Dudley died without having been able to bring the matter to a\r\nlegal decision. In the next reign the evidence formerly given was\r\nreviewed, and the title of duchess Dudley conferred on the widow of sir\r\nRobert, the patent setting forth that the marriage of the earl of\r\nLeicester with lady Sheffield had been satisfactorily proved.\r\n\r\nSo close were the contrivances, so deep, as it appears, the villanies of\r\nthis celebrated favorite! But his consummate art was successful in\r\nthrowing over these and other transactions of his life, a veil of doubt\r\nand mystery which time itself has proved unable entirely to remove.\r\n\r\nHatton was at this time ill, and lord Talbot mentions that the queen\r\nwent daily to visit him, but that a party with which Leicester was\r\nthought to co-operate, was endeavouring to bring forwards Mr. Edward\r\nDyer to supplant him in her majesty's favor. This gentleman, it seems,\r\nhad been for two years in disgrace; and as he had suffered during the\r\nsame period from a bad state of health, the queen was made to believe\r\nthat the continuance of her displeasure was the cause of his malady, and\r\nthat his recovery was without her pardon hopeless. This was taking her\r\nby her weak side; she loved to imagine herself the dispenser of life and\r\ndeath to her devoted servants, and she immediately dispatched to the\r\nsick gentleman a comfortable message, on receipt of which he was made\r\nwhole. The letter-writer observes, to the honor of lord Burleigh, that\r\nhe concerned himself as usual only in state affairs, and suffered all\r\nthese love-matters and petty intrigues to pass without notice before his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAll the caution, however, and all the devotedness of this great minister\r\nwere insufficient to preserve him, on the following occasion, from the\r\nunworthy suspicions of his mistress. The queen of Scots had this year\r\nwith difficulty obtained permission to resort to the baths of Buxton for\r\nthe recovery of her health; and a similar motive led thither at the same\r\ntime the lord-treasurer. Elizabeth marked the coincidence; and when, a\r\nyear or two afterwards, it occurred for the second time, her displeasure\r\nbroke forth: she openly accused her minister of seeking occasions of\r\nentering into intelligence with Mary by means of the earl of Shrewsbury\r\nand his lady, and it was not without difficulty that he was able to\r\nappease her. This striking fact is thus related by Burleigh himself in a\r\nremarkable letter to the earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Burleigh to the earl of Shrewsbury._\r\n\r\n\"My very good lord,\r\n\r\n\"My most hearty and due commendations done, I cannot sufficiently\r\nexpress in words the inward hearty affection that I conceive by your\r\nlordship's friendly offer of the marriage of your younger son; and that\r\nin such a friendly sort, by your own letter, and, as your lordship\r\nwriteth, the same proceeding of yourself. Now, my lord, as I think\r\nmyself much beholding to you for this your lordship's kindness, and\r\nmanifest argument of a faithful good will, so must I pray your lordship\r\nto accept mine answer, with assured opinion of my continuance in the\r\nsame towards your lordship. There are specially two causes why I do not\r\nin plain terms consent by way of conclusion hereto; the one for that my\r\ndaughter is but young in years; and upon some reasonable respects I have\r\ndetermined, notwithstanding I have been very honorably offered matches,\r\nnot to treat of marrying of her, if I may live so long, until she shall\r\nbe above fifteen or sixteen; and if I were of more likelihood myself to\r\nlive longer than I look to do, she should not, with my liking, be\r\nmarried before she were near eighteen or twenty.\r\n\r\n\"The second cause why I defer to yield to conclusion with your\r\nlordship, is grounded upon such a consideration as, if it were not truly\r\nto satisfy your lordship, and to avoid a just offence which your\r\nlordship might conceive of my forbearing, I would not by writing or\r\nmessage utter, but only by speech to your lordship's self. My lord, it\r\nis over true and over much against reason, that upon my being at\r\nBuckstones last, advantage was sought by some that loved me not, to\r\nconfirm in her majesty a former conceit which had been labored to be put\r\ninto her head, that I was of late time become friendly to the queen of\r\nScots, and that I had no disposition to encounter her practises; and\r\nnow, at my being at Buckstones, her majesty did directly conceive that\r\nmy being there was, by means of your lordship and my lady, to enter into\r\nintelligence with the queen of Scots; and hereof at my return to her\r\nmajesty's presence I had very sharp reproofs for my going to Buckstones,\r\nwith plain charging of me for favoring the queen of Scots, and that in\r\nso earnest a sort as I never looked for, knowing my integrity to her\r\nmajesty; but, specially, knowing how contrariously the queen of Scots\r\nconceived of me for many things past to the offence of the said queen of\r\nScots. And yet, true it is, I never indeed gave just cause by any\r\nprivate affection of my own, or for myself, to offend the queen of\r\nScots; but whatsoever I did was for the service of mine own lady and\r\nqueen, which if it were yet again to be done I would do. And though I\r\nknow myself subject to contrary workings of displeasure, yet I will not,\r\nfor remedy of any of them both, decline from the duty I owe to God and\r\nmy sovereign queen; for I know, and do understand, that I am in this\r\ncontrary sort maliciously depraved, and yet in secret sort; on the one\r\npart, and that of long time, that I am the most dangerous enemy and evil\r\nwiller to the queen of Scots; on the other side, that I am also a secret\r\nwell willer to her and her title; and that I have made my party good\r\nwith her. Now, my lord, no man can make both these true together; but it\r\nsufficeth for such as like not me in doing my duty to deprave me, and\r\nyet in such sort is done in darkness as I cannot get opportunity to\r\nconvince them in the light. In all these crossings, my good lord, I\r\nappeal to God, who knoweth, yea, I thank him infinitely, who directeth\r\nmy thoughts to intend principally the service and honor of God, and,\r\njointly with that, the surety and greatness of my sovereign lady the\r\nqueen's majesty; and for any other respect but that may tend to those\r\ntwo, I appeal to God to punish me if I have any. As for the queen of\r\nScots, truly I have no spot of evil meaning to her; neither do I mean to\r\ndeal with any titles to the crown. If she shall intend any evil to the\r\nqueen's majesty my sovereign, for her sake I must and will mean to\r\nimpeach her; and therein I may be her unfriend or worse.\r\n\r\n\"Well now, my good lord, your lordship seeth I have made a long\r\ndigression from my answer, but I trust your lordship can consider what\r\nmoveth me thus to digress: Surely it behoveth me not only to live\r\nuprightly, but to avoid all probable arguments that may be gathered to\r\nrender me suspected to her majesty, whom I serve with all dutifulness\r\nand sincerity; and therefore I gather this, that if it were understood\r\nthat there were a communication, or a purpose of a marriage between your\r\nlordship's son and my daughter, I am sure there would be an advantage\r\nsought to increase these former suspicions [word missing] purpose.\r\nConsidering the young years of our two children [word missing] as if the\r\nmatter were fully agreed betwixt us, the parents, the marriage could not\r\ntake effect, I think it best to refer the motion in silence, and yet so\r\nto order it with ourselves, that, when time shall hereafter be more\r\nconvenient, we may, and then also with less cause of vain suspicion,\r\nrenew it. And, in the meantime, I must confess myself much bounden to\r\nyour lordship for your goodness; wishing your lordship's son all the\r\ngood education that may be mete to teach him to fear God, love your\r\nlordship his natural father, and to know his friends; without any\r\ncuriosity of human learning, which, without the fear of God, I see doth\r\nmuch hurt to all youth in this time and age. My lord, I pray you bear\r\nwith my scribbling, which I think your lordship shall hardly read, and\r\nyet I would not use my man's hand in such a matter as this is. [From\r\nHampton Court, 25th Dec. 1575.]\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship's most assured at command\r\n\r\n\"W. BURLEIGH[76].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 76: \"Illustrations\" by Lodge.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA similar caution to that of lord Burleigh was not observed in the\r\ndisposal of her daughters by the countess of Shrewsbury; a woman\r\nremarkable above all her contemporaries for a violent, restless and\r\nintriguing spirit, and an inordinate thirst of money and of sway. She\r\nbrought to effect in 1574 a marriage between Elizabeth Cavendish, her\r\ndaughter by a former husband, and Charles Stuart, brother of Darnley and\r\nnext to the king of Scots in the order of succession to the crowns both\r\nof England and Scotland. Notwithstanding the rooted enmity between Mary\r\nand the house of Lenox, this union was supposed to be the result of some\r\nprivate intrigue between lady Shrewsbury and the captive queen; and in\r\nconsequence of it Elizabeth committed to custody for some time, both the\r\nmother of the bride and the unfortunate countess of Lenox, doomed to\r\nexpiate by such a variety of sufferings the unpardonable offence, in the\r\neyes of Elizabeth, of having given heirs to the British sceptres.\r\n\r\nA signal occasion presented itself to the queen in 1575 of demonstrating\r\nto all neighbouring powers, that whatever suspicions her close and\r\nsomewhat crooked system of policy might now and then have excited,\r\nself-defence was in reality its genuine principle and single object; and\r\nthat the clear and comprehensive view which she had taken of her own\r\ntrue interests, joined to the habitual caution of her character, would\r\never restrain her from availing herself of the most tempting\r\nopportunities of aggrandizement at their expense.\r\n\r\nThe provinces of Holland and Zealand, goaded into revolt by the bigotry\r\nand barbarity of Philip of Spain, had from the first experienced in the\r\nEnglish nation, and even in Elizabeth herself, a disposition to\r\nencourage and shelter them; and despairing of being able longer to\r\nmaintain alone the unequal contest which they had provoked, yet resolute\r\nto return no more under the tyranny of a detested master, they now\r\nembraced the resolution of throwing themselves entirely upon her\r\nprotection. It was urged that Elizabeth,--as descended from Philippa\r\nwife of Edward III., a daughter of that count of Hainalt and Holland\r\nfrom one of whose co-heiresses the king of Spain derived the Flemish\r\npart of his dominions,--might claim somewhat of a hereditary title to\r\ntheir allegiance, and a solemn deputation was appointed to offer to her\r\nthe sovereignty of the provinces on condition of defending them from the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nThere was much in the proposal to flatter the pride and tempt the\r\nambition of a prince; much also to gratify that desire of retaliation\r\nwhich the encouragement given by Philip to the Northern rebellion and to\r\ncertain movements in Ireland, as well as to all the machinations of the\r\nqueen of Scots, may reasonably be supposed to have excited in the bosom\r\nof Elizabeth. Zeal for the protestant cause, had she ever entertained it\r\nseparately from considerations of personal interest and safety, might\r\nhave proved a further inducement with her to accept the patronage of\r\nthese afflicted provinces:--but not all the motives which could be urged\r\nwere of force to divert her from her settled plan of policy; and after a\r\nshort interval of anxious hesitation, she resolved to dismiss the envoys\r\nwith an absolute refusal. The speech which she addressed to them on this\r\noccasion was highly characteristic, and in one point extremely\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nShe reprobated, doubtless with great sincerity, the principle, that\r\nthere were cases in which subjects might be justified in throwing off\r\nallegiance to their lawful prince; and protested that, for herself,\r\nnothing could ever tempt her to usurp upon the dominions either of her\r\ngood brother of Spain or any other prince. Finally, she took upon her to\r\nadvert to the religious scruples which had produced the revolt of the\r\nHollanders, in a tone of levity which it is difficult to understand her\r\nmotive for assuming: since it could not fail, from her lips especially,\r\nto give extreme scandal to the deputies and to all other serious men.\r\nShe said, that it was unreasonable in the Dutch to have stirred up so\r\ngreat a commotion merely on account of the celebration of mass; and that\r\nso contumacious a resistance to their king could never redound to their\r\nhonor, since they were not compelled to believe in the divinity of the\r\nmass, but only to be spectators of its performance,--as at a public\r\nspectacle. \"What!\" said she, \"if I were to begin to act some scene in a\r\ndress like this,\" (for she was clad in white like a priest,) \"should you\r\nregard it as a crime to behold it?[77]\" Was the queen here making the\r\napology of her own compliances under the reign of her sister, or was she\r\ngenerously furnishing a salvo for others? In any case, the sentiment, as\r\ncoming from the heroine of protestantism, is extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Note 77: Reidani \"Annal.\" Vide Bayle's \"Dictionary,\" art.\r\n_Elizabeth_.]\r\n\r\nAn ineffectual remonstrance, addressed by Elizabeth to the king of\r\nSpain, was the only immediate result of this attempt of the Provinces\r\nto engage her in their concerns. She kept a watchful eye, however, upon\r\ntheir great and glorious struggle; and the time at length came, when she\r\nfound it expedient to unite more closely her interest with theirs.\r\n\r\nEngland now enjoyed profound tranquillity, internal and external, and\r\nour annalists find leisure to advert to various circumstances of\r\ndomestic history. They mention a corporation formed for the\r\ntransmutation of iron into copper by the method of one Medley an\r\nalchemist, of which the learned but credulous sir Thomas Smith,\r\nsecretary of state, was a principal promoter, and in which both\r\nLeicester and Burleigh embarked some capital. The master of the Mint\r\nventured to express a doubt of the success of the experiment, because\r\nthe adept had engaged that the weight of copper procured should exceed\r\nthat of all the substances employed in its production; but nobody seems\r\nto have felt the force of this simple objection, and great was the\r\ndisappointment of all concerned when at length the bubble burst.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the famous Dr. Dee, mathematician, astrologer, and\r\nprofessor of the occult sciences, being pressed by poverty, supplicated\r\nBurleigh to procure her majesty's patronage for his infallible method of\r\ndiscovering hidden treasures. This person, who stood at the head of his\r\nclass, had been early protected by Leicester, who employed him to fix a\r\nlucky day for the queen's coronation. He had since been patronized by\r\nher majesty, who once visited him at his house at Mortlake, took lessons\r\nof him in astronomy, and occasionally supplied him with money to defray\r\nthe expenses of his experiment. She likewise presented him to some\r\necclesiastical benefices; but he often complained of the delay or\r\nnon-performance of her promises of pensions and preferment. On one\r\noccasion he was sent to the continent, ostensibly for the purpose of\r\nconsulting physicians and philosophers on the state of her majesty's\r\nhealth; but probably not without some secret political commission. After\r\na variety of wild adventures in different countries of Europe, in which\r\nhe and his associate Kelly discovered still more knavery than credulity\r\nin the exercise of their various false sciences and fallacious arts, Dee\r\nwas invited home by her majesty in 1589, and was afterwards presented by\r\nher with the wardenship of Manchester-college. But he was hated and\r\nsometimes insulted by the people as a conjurer; quarrelled with the\r\nfellows of his college, quitted Manchester in disgust, and failing to\r\nobtain the countenance of king James died at length in poverty and\r\nneglect;--the ordinary fate of his class of projectors. Elizabeth\r\nperformed a more laudable part in lending her support to the enterprise\r\nof that able and spirited navigator Martin Frobisher, who had long been\r\nsoliciting in vain among the merchants the means of attempting a\r\nnorthwest passage to the Indies, and was finally supplied by the queen\r\nwith two small vessels. With these he set sail in June 1576, and though\r\nunsuccessful in the prime object of his voyage, extended considerably\r\nthe previous acquaintance of navigators with the coasts of Greenland,\r\nand became the discoverer of the straits which still bear his name.\r\n\r\nA sect called \"The family of Love\" had lately sprung up in England. Its\r\ndoctrines, notwithstanding the frightful reports raised of them, were\r\nprobably dangerous neither to the established church, with the rites of\r\nwhich the brethren willingly complied, nor yet to the state; and it may\r\nbe doubted whether they were in any respect incompatible with private\r\nmorals; but no innovations in religion were regarded as tolerable or\r\nvenial under the rigid administration of Elizabeth; and the leaders of\r\nthe new heresy were taken into custody, and compelled to recant. Some\r\nanabaptists were apprehended about the same time, who acknowledged their\r\nerror at Paul's Cross, bearing faggots,--the tremendous symbol of the\r\nfate from which their recantation had rescued them. Two of these unhappy\r\nmen, however, repented of the disingenuous act into which human frailty\r\nhad betrayed them; and returning to the open profession of their\r\nopinions were burned in Smithfield, to the eternal opprobrium of\r\nprotestant principles and the deep disgrace of the governess and\r\ninstitutress of the Anglican Church.\r\n\r\nThe observation of lord Talbot, that the earl of Leicester showed\r\nhimself more than ever solicitous to improve the favor of his sovereign,\r\nreceived confirmation from the unparalleled magnificence of the\r\nreception which he provided for her when, during her progress in the\r\nsummer of 1575, she honored him with a visit in Warwickshire.\r\n\r\nThe \"princely pleasures of Kennelworth,\" were famed in their day as the\r\nquintessence of all courtly delight, and very long and very pompous\r\ndescriptions of these festive devices have come down to our times. They\r\nwere conducted on a scale of grandeur and expense which may still\r\nsurprise; but taste as yet was in its infancy, and the whole was\r\ncharacterized by the unmerciful tediousness, the ludicrous\r\nincongruities, and the operose pedantry of a semi-barbarous age.\r\n\r\nA temporary bridge 70 feet in length was thrown across a valley to the\r\ngreat gate of the castle, and its posts were hung with the offerings of\r\nseven of the Grecian deities to her majesty; displaying in grotesque\r\nassemblage, cages of various large birds, fruits, corn, fishes, grapes,\r\nand wine in silver vessels, musical instruments of many kinds and\r\nweapons and armour hung trophy-wise on two ragged staves. A poet\r\nstanding at the end of the bridge explained in Latin verse the meaning\r\nof all. The Lady of the Lake, invisible since the disappearance of the\r\nrenowned prince Arthur, approached on a floating island along the moat\r\nto recite adulatory verses. Arion, being summoned for the like purpose,\r\nappeared on a dolphin four-and-twenty feet long, which carried in its\r\nbelly a whole orchestra. A Sibyl, a \"Salvage man\" and an Echo posted in\r\nthe park, all harangued in the same strain. Music and dancing enlivened\r\nthe Sunday evening. Splendid fireworks were displayed both on land and\r\nwater;--a play was performed;--an Italian tumbler exhibited his\r\nfeats;--thirteen bears were baited;--there were three stag-hunts, and a\r\nrepresentation of a country bridal, followed by running at the quintin:\r\nfinally, the men of Coventry exhibited, by express permission, their\r\nannual mock fight in commemoration of a signal defeat of the Danes.\r\n\r\nNineteen days did the earl of Leicester sustain the overwhelming honor\r\nof this royal visit;--a demonstration of her majesty's satisfaction in\r\nher entertainment quite unexampled, but which probably awakened less\r\nenvy than any other token of her peculiar grace by which she might have\r\nbeen pleased to distinguish her favorite.\r\n\r\nNo domestic incident had for a long time excited so strong a sensation\r\nas the death of Walter Devereux earl of Essex, which took place at\r\nDublin in the autumn of the year 1576. This nobleman is celebrated for\r\nhis talents, his virtues, his unfortunate and untimely death, and also\r\nas the father of a son still more distinguished and destined to a fate\r\nyet more disastrous. He was of illustrious descent, deriving a part of\r\nhis hereditary honors from the lords Ferrers of Chartley, and the rest\r\nfrom the noble family of Bourchier, through a daughter of Thomas of\r\nWoodstock youngest son of Edward III. In his nineteenth year he\r\nsucceeded his grandfather as viscount Hereford, and coming to court\r\nattracted the merited commendations of her majesty by his learning, his\r\nabilities, and his ingenuous modesty.\r\n\r\nDuring a short period the viscount was joined in commission with the\r\nearls of Huntingdon and Shrewsbury for the safe keeping of the queen of\r\nScots. On the breaking out of the northern rebellion, he joined the\r\nroyal army with all the forces he could raise; and in reward of this\r\nforwardness in her service her majesty conferred on him the garter, and\r\nsubsequently invested him, after the most solemn and honorable form of\r\ncreation, with the dignity of earl of Essex, long hereditary in the\r\nhouse of Bourchier.\r\n\r\nBy these marks of favor the jealousy of Leicester and of other courtiers\r\nwas strongly excited; but with little cause. The spirit of the earl had\r\ntoo much of boldness, of enterprise, of a high-souled generosity, to\r\npermit him to take root and flourish in that scene of treachery and\r\nintrigue--a court; it quickly prompted him to seek occupation at a\r\ndistance, in the attempt to subdue and civilize a turbulent Irish\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nHe solicited and obtained from the queen, by a kind of agreement then\r\nnot unusual, a grant to himself and the adventurers under him of half of\r\nthe district of Clandeboy in Ulster, on condition of his rescuing and\r\ndefending the whole of it from the rebels and defraying half the\r\nexpenses of the service. Great things were expected from his expedition,\r\non which he embarked in August 1573: but sir William Fitzwilliams,\r\ndeputy of Ireland, viewed the arrival of the earl with sentiments which\r\nled him to oppose every possible obstacle to his success. Probably, too,\r\nEssex himself found, on trial, the task of subduing the _Irishry_ (as\r\nthe natives of the island were then called) a more difficult one than he\r\nhad anticipated. Some brilliant service, however, amid many delays and\r\ndisappointments, he performed in various parts of the country; and\r\nhaving returned to England in 1575 to lay all his grievances before the\r\nqueen, and face the court faction which injured him in his absence, he\r\nwas sent back with the title of Marshal of Ireland, an appointment\r\nwhich Leicester, for his own purposes, is said to have been active in\r\nprocuring him.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sidney had now succeeded Fitzwilliams as lord-deputy; and from\r\nhim it does not appear that Essex had the same systematic opposition to\r\nencounter: on the contrary, having been applied to by the queen for his\r\nopinion of the expediency of granting several requests of the earl\r\nrelative to this service, sir Henry advised her majesty to comply with\r\nmost of them, prefacing his counsel with the following sentence: \"Of the\r\nearl I must say, that he is so noble and worthy a personage, and so\r\nforward in all his actions, and so complete a gentleman wherein he may\r\neither advance your honor or service, as you may take comfort to have in\r\nstore so rare a subject, who hath nothing in greater regard than to show\r\nhimself such an one indeed as the common fame reporteth him; which hath\r\nbeen no more, in troth, than his due deserts and painful travels in the\r\nworst parts of this miserable country have deserved[78].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 78: \"Sidney Papers,\" vol. i.]\r\n\r\nSuch in fact was the apparent cordiality between the deputy and the\r\nmarshal, that a proposal passed for the marriage of Philip Sidney to the\r\nlady Penelope Devereux daughter of the earl: but if this friendship were\r\never sincere on the part of sir Henry, it was at least short-lived; for,\r\nwriting a few months after Essex's death to Leicester respecting the\r\nearl of Ormond, whom the favorite regarded as his enemy, he says.... \"In\r\nfine, my lord, I am ready to accord with him; but, my most dear lord\r\nand brother, be you upon your keeping for him; for, if Essex had lived,\r\nyou should have found him as violent an enemy as his heart, power and\r\ncunning would have served him to have been; and for that their malice, I\r\ntake God to record, I could brook neither of them both[79].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 79: \"Sidney Papers,\" vol. i.]\r\n\r\nIreland was, during the whole of Elizabeth's reign, that part of her\r\ndominions which it cost her most trouble to govern, and with which her\r\nsystem of policy prospered the least. Without a considerable military\r\nforce it was impossible to bring into subjection those parts of the\r\ncountry which still remained in a state of barbarism under the sway of\r\nnative chieftains, or even to preserve in safety and civility such\r\ndistricts as were already reclaimed and brought within the English pale.\r\nBut the queen's parsimony, or, more truly, the narrowness of her income,\r\ncaused her perpetually to repine at the great expenses to which she was\r\nput for this service, and frequently to run the risk of losing all that\r\nhad been slowly gained, by a sudden withdrawment, or long delay, of the\r\nnecessary supplies. Her suspicious temper caused her likewise to lend\r\nready ear to the complaints, whether founded or not, brought by the\r\ndisaffected Irish against her officers. Sir Henry Sidney himself, the\r\ndeputy whom she most favored and trusted, and continued longer in office\r\nthan any other, supported as he was at court by the potent influence of\r\nLeicester and the steady friendship of Burleigh, had many causes offered\r\nhim of vexation and discontent; and those who held inferior commands,\r\nand were less ably protected from the attacks of their enemies,\r\nexperienced almost insupportable anxieties from counteractions,\r\ndifficulties and hardships of every kind. Of these the unfortunate earl\r\nof Essex had his full share.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of improving his fortune, with which he had entered upon the\r\nservice, were so far from being realized that he found himself sinking\r\ncontinually deeper in debt. His efforts against the rebels were by no\r\nmeans uniformly successful. His court enemies contrived to divert most\r\nof the succours designed him by his sovereign, and the perplexities of\r\nhis situation went on accumulating instead of diminishing. The bodily\r\nfatigue which he endured in the prosecution of his designs, joined to\r\nthe anguish of a wounded spirit, undermined at length the powers of his\r\nconstitution, and after repeated attacks he was carried off by a\r\ndysentery in September 1576.\r\n\r\nEssex was liberal, affable, brave and eloquent, and generally beloved\r\nboth in England and Ireland. The symptoms of his disease, though such as\r\nexposure alone to the pestilential damps of the climate might well have\r\nproduced, were also susceptible of being ascribed to poison; and one of\r\nhis attendants, a divine who likewise professed medicine, seeing him in\r\ngreat pain, suddenly exclaimed, \"By the mass, my lord, you are\r\npoisoned!\" The report spread like wild-fire. To common minds it is a\r\nrelief under irremediable misfortune to find an object for blame; and\r\naccordingly, though no direct evidence of the fact was produced, it was\r\nuniversally believed that some villain had administered to him \"an ill\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nAs Leicester was known to be his enemy, strongly suspected of an\r\nintrigue with his wife, and believed capable of any enormity, the\r\nfriends and partisans of Essex seem immediately to have pointed at him\r\nas the contriver of his death; yet I find no contemporary evidence of\r\nthe imputation, except in the conduct of sir Henry Sidney on this\r\noccasion, which indicates great anxiety for the reputation of his patron\r\nand brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe lord-deputy was unfortunately absent from Dublin at the time of the\r\nearl of Essex's death, and before he could institute a regular\r\nexamination into the manner of it, a thousand false tales had been\r\ncirculated which were greedily received by the public. On his return,\r\nhowever, he entered into the investigation with great zeal and\r\ndiligence:--the decisive test of an examination of the body was not\r\nindeed applied, for it was one with which that age seems to have been\r\nunacquainted; but many witnesses were called, reports were traced to\r\ntheir source and in some instances disproved, and the result of the\r\nwhole was transmitted by the deputy to the privy-council in a letter\r\nwhich appears satisfactorily to prove that there was no solid ground to\r\nascribe the event to any but natural causes. That the deputy himself was\r\nconvinced of the correctness of this representation is seen from one of\r\nhis private letters to Leicester, published long after in the \"Sidney\r\nPapers.\"\r\n\r\nIn all probability, posterity would scarcely have heard of this\r\nimputation on the character of Leicester, had not his marriage with the\r\nwidow of Essex served as corroboration of the charge, and given occasion\r\nto the malicious comments of the author of \"Leicester's Commonwealth.\"\r\nThis union, however, was not publicly celebrated till two years\r\nafterwards; and we have no certain authority for the fact of the\r\ncriminal connexion of the parties during the life of the earl of Essex,\r\nnor for the private marriage said to have been huddled up with indecent\r\nprecipitation on his decease.\r\n\r\nWalter earl of Essex left Robert his son and successor, then in the\r\ntenth year of his age, to the care and protection of the earl of Sussex\r\nand lord Burleigh; but Mr. Edward Waterhouse, a person of great merit\r\nand abilities, then employed in Ireland and distinguished by the favor\r\nboth of lord Burleigh and sir Henry Sidney, had the immediate management\r\nof the fortune and affairs of the minor. Of this friend Essex is related\r\nto have taken leave in his last moments with many kisses, exclaiming, \"O\r\nmy Ned, my Ned, farewell! thou art the faithfulest and friendliest\r\ngentleman that ever I knew.\" He proved the fidelity of his attachment by\r\nattending the body of the earl to Wales, whither it was conveyed for\r\ninterment, and it was thence that he immediately afterwards addressed to\r\nsir Henry Sidney a letter, of which the following is an extract.\r\n\r\n\"The state of the earl of Essex, being best known to myself, doth\r\nrequire my travel for a time in his causes; but my burden cannot be\r\ngreat when every man putteth to his helping hand. Her majesty hath\r\nbestowed upon the young earl his marriage, and all his father's rules in\r\nWales, and promiseth the remission of his debt. The lords do generally\r\nfavor and further him; some for the trust reposed, some for love to the\r\nfather, other for affinity with the child, and some for other causes.\r\nAll these lords that wish well to the children, and, I suppose, all the\r\nbest sort of the English lords besides, do expect what will become of\r\nthe treaty between Mr. Philip and my lady Penelope.\r\n\r\n\"Truly, my lord, I must say to your lordship, as I have said to my lord\r\nof Leicester and Mr. Philip, the breaking off of this match, if the\r\ndefault be on your parts, will turn to more dishonor than can be\r\nrepaired with any other marriage in England. And I protest unto your\r\nlordship, I do not think that there is at this day so strong a man in\r\nEngland of friends as the little earl of Essex; nor any man more\r\nlamented than his father since the death of king Edward[80].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 80: \"Sidney Papers.\"]\r\n\r\nUnder such high auspices, and with such a general consent of men's minds\r\nin his favor, did the celebrated, the rash, the lamented Essex commence\r\nhis brief and ill-starred course! The match between Philip Sidney and\r\nlady Penelope Devereux was finally broken off, as Waterhouse seems to\r\nhave apprehended. She married lord Rich, and afterwards Charles Blount\r\nearl of Devonshire, on whose account she had been divorced from her\r\nfirst husband.\r\n\r\nHow little all the dark suspicions and sinister reports to which the\r\ndeath of the earl of Essex had given occasion, were able to influence\r\nthe mind of Elizabeth against the man of her heart, may appear by the\r\ntenor of an extraordinary letter written by her in June 1577 to the earl\r\nand countess of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Our very good cousins;\r\n\r\n\"Being given to understand from our cousin of Leicester how honorably he\r\nwas not only lately received by you our cousin the countess at\r\nChatsworth, and his diet by you both discharged at Buxtons, but also\r\npresented with a very rare present, we should do him great wrong\r\n(holding him in that place of favor we do) in case we should not let you\r\nunderstand in how thankful sort we accept the same at both your hands,\r\nnot as done unto him but to our own self; reputing him as another self;\r\nand therefore ye may assure yourselves that we, taking upon us the debt,\r\nnot as his but our own, will take care accordingly to discharge the same\r\nin such honorable sort as so well deserving creditors as ye shall never\r\nhave cause to think ye have met with an ungrateful debtor.\" &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Talbot, on another occasion, urged upon his father the policy of\r\ningratiating himself with Leicester by a pressing invitation to\r\nChatsworth, adding moreover, that he did not believe it would greatly\r\neither further or hinder his going into that part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1577 TO 1582.\r\n\r\nRelations of the queen with France and Spain.--She sends succours to the\r\nDutch--is entertained by Leicester, and celebrated in verse by P.\r\nSidney.--Her visit to Norwich.--Letter of Topcliffe.--Notice of sir T.\r\nSmith.--Magical practices against the queen.--Duke Casimir's visit to\r\nEngland.--Duke of Anjou urges his suit with the queen.--Simier's\r\nmission.--Leicester's marriage.--Behaviour of the queen.--A shot fired\r\nat her barge.--Her memorable speech.--First visit of Anjou in\r\nEngland.--Opinions of privy-councillors on the match.--Letter of Philip\r\nSidney.--Stubbs's book.--Punishment inflicted on him.--Notice of sir N.\r\nBacon.--Drake's return from his circumnavigation.--Jesuit\r\nseminaries.--Arrival of a French embassy.--A triumph.--Notice of Fulk\r\nGreville.--Marriage-treaty with Anjou.--His second visit.--His return\r\nand death.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the year 1576, Walsingham in a letter to sir Henry\r\nSidney thus writes: \"Here at home we live in security as we were wont,\r\ngrounding our quietness upon other harms.\" The harms here alluded\r\nto,--the religious wars of France, and the revolt of the Dutch provinces\r\nfrom Spain,--had proved indeed, in more ways than one, the safeguard of\r\nthe peace of England. They furnished so much domestic occupation to the\r\ntwo catholic sovereigns of Europe, most formidable by their power, their\r\nbigotry, and their unprincipled ambition, as effectually to preclude\r\nthem from uniting their forces to put in execution against Elizabeth the\r\npapal sentence of deprivation; and by the opportunity which they\r\nafforded her of causing incalculable mischiefs to these princes through\r\nthe succours which she might afford to their rebellious subjects, they\r\nlong enabled her to restrain both Philip and Charles within the bounds\r\nof respect and amity. But circumstances were now tending with increased\r\nvelocity towards a rupture with Spain, clearly become inevitable; and in\r\n1577 the queen of England saw herself compelled to take steps in the\r\naffairs of the Low Countries equally offensive to that power and to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe states of Holland, after the rejection of their sovereignty by\r\nElizabeth, cast their eyes around in search of another protector: and\r\nCharles IX., suffering his ambition and his rivalry with Philip II. to\r\noverpower all the vehemence of his zeal for the catholic religion,\r\nshowed himself eager to become their patron. His brother the duke\r\nd'Alencon, doubtless with his concurrence, offered on certain terms to\r\nbring a French army for the expulsion of don John of Austria, governor\r\nof the Low Countries; and this proposal he urged with so much\r\nimportunity, that the Hollanders, notwithstanding their utter antipathy\r\nto the royal family of France, seemed likely to accede to it, as the\r\nlightest of that variety of evils of which their present situation\r\noffered them the choice. But Elizabeth could not view with indifference\r\nthe progress of a negotiation which might eventually procure to France\r\nthe annexation of these important provinces; and she encouraged the\r\nstates to refuse the offers of Alencon by immediately transmitting for\r\ntheir service liberal supplies of arms and money to duke Casimir, son of\r\nthe Elector Palatine, then at the head of a large body of German\r\nprotestants in the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time she endeavoured to repress the catholics in her own\r\ndominions by a stricter enforcement of the penal laws, and two or three\r\npersons in this year suffered capitally for their denial of the queen's\r\nsupremacy[81].\r\n\r\n[Note 81: Dr. Whitgift, then bishop of Worcester and vice-president\r\nof the marches of Wales under sir Henry Sidney, peculiarly distinguished\r\nhimself by his activity in detecting secret meetings of catholics for\r\nthe purpose of hearing mass and practising other rites of their\r\nreligion. The privy-council, in reward of his zeal, promised to direct\r\nto him and to some of the Welsh bishops a special commission for the\r\ntrial of these delinquents. They further instructed him, in the case of\r\none Morice who had declined answering directly to certain\r\ninterrogatories tending to criminate himself in these matters, that if\r\nhe remained obstinate, and the commissioners saw cause, they might at\r\ntheir discretion cause some kind of torture to be used upon him. The\r\nsame means he was also desired to take with others; in order to come to\r\na full knowledge of all reconcilements to the church of Rome, and other\r\npractices of the papists in these parts. See Strype's \"Whitgift,\" p.\r\n83.]\r\n\r\nThese steps on the part of Elizabeth threatened to disconcert entirely\r\nthe plans of the French court; but it still seemed practicable, to the\r\nking and to his brother, to produce a change in her measures; and two or\r\nthree successive embassies arrived in London during the spring and\r\nsummer of 1578, to renew with fresh earnestness the proposals of\r\nmarriage on the part of the duke d'Alencon. The earl of Sussex and his\r\nparty favored this match, Leicester and all the zealous protestants in\r\nthe court and the nation opposed it. The queen \"sat arbitress,\" and\r\nperhaps prolonged her deliberations on the question, for the pleasure of\r\nreceiving homage more than usually assiduous from both factions.\r\n\r\nThe favorite, anxious to secure his ascendency by fresh efforts of\r\ngallantry and instances of devotedness, entreated to be indulged in the\r\nprivilege of entertaining her majesty for several days at his seat of\r\nWanstead-house; a recent and expensive purchase, which he had been\r\noccupied in adorning with a magnificence suited to the ostentatious\r\nprodigality of his disposition.\r\n\r\nIt was for the entertainment of her majesty on this occasion that Philip\r\nSidney condescended to task a genius worthy of better things with the\r\ncomposition of a mask in celebration of her surpassing beauties and\r\nroyal virtues, entitled \"The Lady of May.\" In defence of this public act\r\nof adulation, the young poet had probably the particular request of his\r\nuncle and patron to plead, as well as the common practice of the age;\r\nbut it must still be mortifying under any circumstances, to record the\r\nabasement of such a spirit to a level with the vulgar herd of\r\nElizabethan flatterers.\r\n\r\nUnsatiated with festivities and homage, the queen continued her progress\r\nfrom Wanstead through the counties of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk,\r\nreceiving the attendance of numerous troops of gentry, and making visits\r\nin her way to all who felt themselves entitled, or called, to solicit\r\nwith due humility the costly honor of entertaining her. Her train was\r\nnumerous and brilliant, and the French ambassadors constantly attended\r\nher motions. About the middle of August she arrived at Norwich.\r\n\r\nThis ancient city, then one of the most considerable in the kingdom,\r\nyielded to none in a zealous attachment to protestant principles and to\r\nthe queen's person; and as its remote situation had rendered the arrival\r\nof a royal visitant within its walls an extremely rare occurrence, the\r\nmagistrates resolved to spare nothing which could contribute to the\r\nsplendor of her reception.\r\n\r\nAt the furthest limits of the city she was met by the mayor, who\r\naddressed her in a long and very abject Latin oration, in which he was\r\nnot ashamed to pronounce that the city enjoyed its charters and\r\nprivileges \"by her only clemency.\" At the conclusion he produced a large\r\nsilver cup filled with gold pieces, saying, \"Sunt hic centum librae puri\r\nauri:\" Welcome sounds, which failed not to reach the ear of her gracious\r\nmajesty, who, lifting up the cover with alacrity, said audibly to the\r\nfootman to whose care it was delivered, \"Look to it, there is a hundred\r\npound.\" Pageants were set up in the principal streets, of which one had\r\nat least the merit of appropriateness, since it accurately represented\r\nthe various processes employed in those woollen manufactures for which\r\nNorwich was already famous.\r\n\r\nTwo days after her majesty's arrival, Mercury, in a blue satin doublet\r\nlined with cloth of gold, with a hat of the same garnished with wings,\r\nand wings at his feet, appeared under her chamber window in an\r\nextraordinarily fine painted coach, and invited her to go abroad and\r\nsee more shows; and a kind of mask, in which Venus and Cupid with\r\nWantonness and Riot were discomfited by the Goddess of Chastity and her\r\nattendants, was performed in the open air. A troop of nymphs and fairies\r\nlay in ambush for her return from dining with the earl of Surry; and in\r\nthe midst of these Heathenish exhibitions, the minister of the Dutch\r\nchurch watched his opportunity to offer to her the grateful homage of\r\nhis flock. To these deserving strangers, protestant refugees from\r\nSpanish oppression, the policy of Elizabeth, in this instance equally\r\ngenerous and discerning, had granted every privilege capable of inducing\r\nthem to make her kingdom their permanent abode. At Norwich, where the\r\ngreater number had settled, a church was given them for the performance\r\nof public worship in their own tongue, and according to the form which\r\nthey preferred; and encouragement was held out to them to establish here\r\nseveral branches of manufacture which they had previously carried on to\r\ngreat advantage at home. This accession of skill and industry soon\r\nraised the woollen fabrics of England to a pitch of excellence unknown\r\nin former ages, and repaid with usury to the country this exercise of\r\npublic hospitality.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the inventing of masks, pageants and devices for the\r\nrecreation of the queen on her progresses had become a distinct\r\nprofession. George Ferrers, formerly commemorated as master of the\r\npastimes to Edward VI., one Goldingham, and Churchyard, author of \"the\r\nWorthiness of Wales,\" of some legends in the \"Mirror for Magistrates,\"\r\nand of a prodigious quantity of verse on various subjects, were the\r\nmost celebrated proficients in this branch; all three are handed down to\r\nposterity as contributors to \"the princely pleasures of Kennelworth,\"\r\nand the two latter as managers of the Norwich entertainments. They vied\r\nwith each other in the gorgeousness, the pedantry and the surprisingness\r\nof their devices; but the palm was surely due to him of the number who\r\nhad the glory of contriving a battle between certain allegorical\r\npersonages, in the midst of which, \"legs and arms of men, well and\r\nlively wrought, were to be let fall in numbers on the ground as bloody\r\nas might be.\" The combat was to be exhibited in the open air; but the\r\nskies were unpropitious, and a violent shower of rain unfortunately\r\ndeprived her majesty of the satisfaction of witnessing the effect of so\r\nextraordinary and elegant a device.\r\n\r\nRichard Topcliffe, a Lincolnshire gentleman employed by government to\r\ncollect informations against the papists, and so much distinguished in\r\nthe employment, that _Topcliffizare_ became the cant term of the day for\r\n_hunting a recusant_, was at this time a follower of the court; and a\r\nletter addressed by him to the earl of Shrewsbury contains some\r\nparticulars of this progress worth preserving.... \"I did never see her\r\nmajesty better received by two counties in one journey than Suffolk and\r\nNorfolk now; Suffolk of gentlemen and Norfolk of the meaner sort, with\r\nexceeding joy to themselves and well liking to her majesty. Great\r\nentertainment at the master of the Rolls'; greater at Kenninghall, and\r\nexceeding of all sorts at Norwich.\r\n\r\n\"The next good news, (but in account the highest) her majesty hath\r\nserved God with great zeal and comfortable examples; for by her council\r\ntwo notorious papists, young Rookwood (the master of Euston-hall, where\r\nher majesty did lie upon Sunday now a fortnight) and one Downes, a\r\ngentleman, were both committed, the one to the town prison at Norwich,\r\nthe other to the county prison there, for obstinate papistry; and seven\r\nmore gentlemen of worship were committed to several houses in Norwich as\r\nprisoners....for badness of belief. This Rookwood is a papist of kind,\r\nnewly crept out of his late wardship. Her majesty, by some means I know\r\nnot, was lodged at his house, Euston, far unmeet for her highness, but\r\nfitter for the black guard; nevertheless, (the gentleman brought into\r\nher majesty's presence by like device) her excellent majesty gave to\r\nRookwood ordinary thanks for his bad house, and her fair hand to kiss;\r\nafter which it was braved at. But my lord chamberlain, nobly and\r\ngravely, understanding that Rookwood was excommunicated for papistry,\r\ncalled him before him; demanded of him how he durst to attempt her royal\r\npresence, he, unfit to accompany any Christian person? Forthwith said he\r\nwas fitter for a pair of stocks; commanded him out of the court, and yet\r\nto attend her council's pleasure, and at Norwich he was committed. And,\r\nto decypher the gentleman to the full; a piece of plate being missed in\r\nthe court and searched for in his hay-house, in the hayrick such an\r\nimage of our lady was there found, as for greatness, for gayness, and\r\nworkmanship, I did never see a match; and after a sort of country\r\ndances ended, in her majesty's sight the idol was set behind the people,\r\nwho avoided. She rather seemed a beast raised upon a sudden from hell by\r\nconjuring, than the picture for whom it had been so often and so long\r\nabused. Her majesty commanded it to the fire, which in her sight by the\r\ncountry folks was quickly done, to her content, and unspeakable joy of\r\nevery one, but some one or two who had sucked of the idol's poisoned\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after, a great sort of good preachers, who had been commanded\r\nto silence for a little niceness, were licensed, and again commanded to\r\npreach; a greater and more universal joy to the counties, and the most\r\nof the court, than the disgrace of the papists; and the gentlemen of\r\nthose parts, being great and hot protestants (almost before by policy\r\ndiscredited and disgraced), were greatly countenanced.\" The letter\r\nwriter afterwards mentions in a splenetic style the envoy from Monsieur,\r\none Baqueville a Norman, \"with four or five of Monsieur's youths,\" who\r\nattended the queen and were \"well entertained and regarded.\" After them,\r\nhe says, came M. Rambouillet from the French king, brother of the\r\ncardinal, who had not long before written vilely against the queen, and\r\nwhose entertainment, it seemed to him, was not so good as that of the\r\nothers[82].\r\n\r\n[Note 82: \"Illustrations,\" by Lodge, vol. ii. p. 187.]\r\n\r\nThe queen was about this time deprived by death of an old and faithful\r\ncounsellor, in the person of sir Thomas Smith one of the principal\r\nsecretaries of state. This eminent person, the author of a work \"on the\r\nCommonwealth of England,\" still occasionally consulted, and in various\r\nways a great benefactor to letters in his day, was one of the few who\r\nhad passed at once with safety and credit through all the perils and\r\nrevolutions of the three preceding reigns. His early proficiency at\r\ncollege obtained for Smith the patronage of Henry VIII., at whose\r\nexpense he was sent to complete his studies in Italy; and he took at\r\nPadua the degree of Doctor of Laws. Resuming on his return his residence\r\nat Cambridge, he united his efforts with those of Cheke for reforming\r\nthe pronunciation of the Greek language. Afterwards he furnished an\r\nexample of attachment to his mother-tongue which among classical\r\nscholars has found too few imitators, by giving to the public a work on\r\nEnglish orthography and pronunciation; objects as yet almost totally\r\nneglected by his countrymen, and respecting which, down to a much later\r\nperiod, no approach to system or uniformity prevailed, but, on the\r\ncontrary, a vagueness, a rudeness and an ignorance disgraceful to a\r\nlettered people.\r\n\r\nThough educated in the civil law, Smith now took deacon's orders and\r\naccepted a rectory, and the deanery of Carlisle. His principles secretly\r\nbegan to incline towards the reformers, and he lent such protection as\r\nhe was able to those who in the latter years of Henry VIII. underwent\r\npersecution for the avowal of similar sentiments.\r\n\r\nProtector Somerset patronized him: under his administration he was\r\nknighted notwithstanding his deacon's orders, and became the colleague\r\nof Cecil as secretary of state. On the accession of Mary he was stripped\r\nof the lucrative offices which he held, but a small pension was assigned\r\nhim on condition of his remaining in the kingdom; and he contrived to\r\npass away those days of horror in an unmolested obscurity.\r\n\r\nHe was among the first whom Mary's illustrious successor recalled to\r\npublic usefulness; being summoned to take his place at her earliest\r\nprivy-council. In the important measures of the beginning of the reign\r\nfor the settlement of religion, he took a distinguished part: afterwards\r\nhe was employed with advantage to his country in several difficult\r\nembassies; he was then appointed assistant and finally successor to\r\nBurleigh in the same high post which they had occupied together so many\r\nyears before under the reign of Edward, and in this station he died at\r\nthe age of sixty-three.\r\n\r\nNo statesman of the age bore a higher character than sir Thomas Smith\r\nfor rectitude and benevolence, and nothing of the wiliness and craft\r\nconspicuous in most of his coadjutors is discernible in him. There was\r\none foible of his day, however, from which he was by no means exempt: on\r\ncertain points he was superstitious beyond the ordinary measure of\r\nlearned credulity in the sixteenth century. Of his faith in alchemical\r\nexperiments a striking instance has already occurred; he was likewise a\r\ngreat astrologer, and gave himself much concern in conjecturing what\r\ndireful events might be portended by the appearance of a comet which\r\nbecame visible in the last year of his life. During a temporary\r\nretirement from court, he had also distinguished himself as a magistrate\r\nby his extraordinary diligence in the prosecution of suspected witches.\r\nBut the date of these and similar delusions had not yet expired. Great\r\nalarms were excited in the country during the year 1577 by the\r\nprevalence of certain magical practices, which were supposed to strike\r\nat the life of her majesty. There were found at Islington, concealed in\r\nthe house of a catholic priest who was a reputed sorcerer, three waxen\r\nimages, formed to represent the queen and two of her chief counsellors;\r\nother dealings also of professors of the occult sciences were from time\r\nto time discovered. \"Whether it were the effect of this magic,\" says\r\nStrype, who wrote in the beginning of the eighteenth century, \"or\r\nproceeded from some natural cause, but the queen was in some part of\r\nthis year under excessive anguish by pains of her teeth: Insomuch that\r\nshe took no rest for divers nights, and endured very great torment night\r\nand day.\" In this extremity, a certain \"outlandish\" physician was\r\nconsulted, who composed on the case, with much solemnity of style, a\r\nlong Latin letter, in which, after observing with due humility that it\r\nwas a perilous attempt in a person of his slender abilities to prescribe\r\nfor a disease which had caused perplexity and diversity of opinion among\r\nthe skilful and eminent physicians ordinarily employed by her majesty,\r\nhe ventured however to suggest various applications as worthy of trial;\r\nfinally hinting at the expediency of having recourse to extraction on\r\nthe possible failure of all other means to afford relief. How this\r\nweighty matter terminated we are not here informed; but it is upon\r\nrecord that Aylmer bishop of London once submitted to have a tooth\r\ndrawn, in order to encourage her majesty to undergo that operation; and\r\nas the promotion of the learned prelate was at this time recent, and his\r\ngratitude, it may be presumed, still lively, we may perhaps be permitted\r\nto conjecture that it was the bishop who on this occasion performed the\r\npart of exorcist.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of duke Casimir for the defence of the United Provinces had\r\nhitherto proved eminently unfortunate; and in the autumn of 1578 he\r\njudged it necessary to come over to England to apologize in person to\r\nElizabeth for the ill success of his arms, and to make arrangements for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nHe was very honorably received by her majesty, who recollected perhaps\r\nwith some little complacency that he had formerly been her suitor.\r\nJustings, tilts, and runnings at the ring were exhibited for his\r\nentertainment, and he was engaged in hunting-parties, in which he\r\ngreatly delighted. Leicester loaded him with presents; the earl of\r\nPembroke also complimented him with a valuable jewel. The earl of\r\nHuntingdon, a nobleman whose religious zeal, which had rendered him the\r\npeculiar patron of the puritan divines, interested him also in the cause\r\nof Holland, escorted him on his return as far as Gravesend; and sir\r\nHenry Sidney attended him to Dover. The queen willingly bestowed on her\r\nprincely guest the cheap distinction of the garter; but her parting\r\npresent of two golden cups, worth three hundred pounds a-piece, was\r\nextorted from her, after much murmuring and long reluctance, by the\r\nurgency of Walsingham, who was anxious, with the rest of his party, that\r\ntowards this champion of the protestant cause, though unfortunate, no\r\nmark of respect should be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and French ambassadors repined at the favors heaped on\r\nCasimir; but in the mean time the French faction was not inactive. The\r\nearl of Sussex, whose generally sound judgement seems to have been\r\nwarped in this instance by his habitual contrariety to Leicester, wrote\r\nin August 1578 a long letter to the queen, in which, after stating the\r\narguments for and against the French match, he summed up pretty\r\ndecidedly in its favor. What was of more avail, Monsieur sent over to\r\nplead his cause an agent named Simier, a person of great dexterity, who\r\nwell knew how to ingratiate himself by a thousand amusing arts; by a\r\nsprightly style of conversation peculiarly suited to the taste of the\r\nqueen; and by that ingenious flattery, the talent of his nation, which\r\nis seldom entirely thrown away even upon the sternest and most\r\nimpenetrable natures. Elizabeth could not summon resolution to dismiss\r\nabruptly a suit which was so agreeably urged, and in February 1579 lord\r\nTalbot sends the following information to his father: \"Her majesty\r\ncontinueth her very good usage of M. Simier and all his company, and he\r\nhath conference with her three or four times a week, and she is the best\r\ndisposed and pleasantest when she talketh with him (as by her gestures\r\nappeareth) that is possible.\" He adds, \"The opinion of Monsieur's\r\ncoming still holdeth, and yet it is secretly bruited that he cannot take\r\nup so much money as he would on such a sudden, and therefore will not\r\ncome so soon[83].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 83: \"Illustrations,\" &c. vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Simier over the queen became on a sudden so potent,\r\nthat Leicester and his party reported, and perhaps believed, that he had\r\nemployed philters and other unlawful means to inspire her with love for\r\nhis master. Simier on his side amply retaliated these hostilities by\r\ncarrying to her majesty the first tidings of the secret marriage of her\r\nfavorite with the countess of Essex;--a fact which none of her courtiers\r\nhad found courage to communicate to her, though it must have been by\r\nthis time widely known, as sir Francis Knowles, the countess's father,\r\nhad insisted, for the sake of his daughter's reputation, that the\r\ncelebration of the nuptials should take place in presence of a\r\nconsiderable number of witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the queen on this disclosure transported her beyond all the\r\nbounds of justice, reason, and decorum. It has been already remarked\r\nthat she was habitually, or systematically, an open enemy to matrimony\r\nin general; and the higher any persons stood in her good graces and the\r\nmore intimate their access to her, the greater was her resentment at\r\ndetecting in them any aspirations after this state; because a kind of\r\njealousy was in these cases superadded to her malignity, and it offended\r\nher pride that those who were honored with her favor should find\r\nthemselves at leisure to covet another kind of happiness of which she\r\nwas not the dispenser. But that Leicester, the dearest of her friends,\r\nthe first of her favorites, after all the devotedness to her charms\r\nwhich he had so long professed, and which she had requited by a\r\npreference so marked and benefits so signal,--that he,--her opinion\r\nunconsulted, her sanction unimplored, should have formed,--and with her\r\nown near relation,--this indissoluble tie, and having formed it should\r\nhave attempted to conceal the fact from her when known to so many\r\nothers,--appeared to her the acme of ingratitude, perfidy, and insult.\r\nShe felt the injury like a weak disappointed woman, she resented it like\r\na queen and a Tudor.\r\n\r\nShe instantly ordered Leicester into confinement in a small fort then\r\nstanding in Greenwich park, and she threw out the menace, nay actually\r\nentertained the design, of sending him to the Tower. But the lofty and\r\nhonorable mind of the earl of Sussex revolted against proceedings so\r\nviolent, so lawless, and so disgraceful in every point of view to his\r\nroyal kinswoman. He plainly represented to her, that it was contrary to\r\nall right and all decorum that any man should be punished for lawful\r\nmatrimony, which was held in honor by all; and his known hostility to\r\nthe favorite giving weight to his remonstrance, the queen curbed her\r\nanger, gave up all thoughts of the Tower, and soon restored the earl to\r\nliberty. In no long time afterwards, he was readmitted to her presence;\r\nand so necessary had he made himself to her majesty, or so powerful in\r\nthe state, that she found it expedient insensibly to restore him to the\r\nsame place of trust and intimacy as before; though it is probable that\r\nhe never entirely regained her affections; and his countess, for whom\r\nindeed she had never entertained any affection, remained the avowed\r\nobject of her utter antipathy even after the death of Leicester, and in\r\nspite of all the intercessions in her behalf with which her son Essex,\r\nin the meridian of his favor, never ceased to importune his sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel of Leicester against Simier proceeded to such extremity\r\nafter this affair, that the latter believed his life in danger from his\r\nattempts. It was even said that the earl had actually hired one of the\r\nqueen's guard to assassinate the envoy, and that the design had only\r\nmiscarried by chance. However this might be, her majesty, on account of\r\nthe spirit of enmity displayed towards him by the people, to whom the\r\nidea of the French match was ever odious, found it necessary, by a\r\nproclamation, to take Simier under her special protection. It was about\r\nthis time that as the queen was taking the air on the Thames, attended\r\nby this Frenchman and by several of her courtiers, a shot was fired into\r\nher barge, by which one of the rowers was severely wounded. Some\r\nsupposed that it was aimed at Simier, others at the queen herself; but\r\nthe last opinion was immediately silenced by the wise and gracious\r\ndeclaration of her majesty, \"that she would believe nothing of her\r\nsubjects that parents would not believe of their children.\"\r\n\r\nAfter due inquiry the shot was found to have been accidental, and the\r\nperson who had been the cause of the mischief, though condemned to\r\ndeath, was pardoned. Such at least is the account of the affair\r\ntransmitted to us by contemporary writers; but it still remains a\r\nmystery how the man came to be capitally condemned if innocent, or to be\r\npardoned if guilty.\r\n\r\nLeicester, from all these circumstances, had incurred so much obloquy at\r\ncourt, and found himself so coldly treated by the queen herself, that in\r\na letter to Burleigh he offered, or threatened, to banish himself; well\r\nknowing, perhaps, that the proposal would not be accepted; while the\r\nFrench prince, now created duke of Anjou, adroitly seized the moment of\r\nthe earl's disgrace to try the effect of personal solicitations on the\r\nheart of Elizabeth. He arrived quite unexpectedly, and almost without\r\nattendants, at the gate of her palace at Greenwich; experienced a very\r\ngracious reception; and after several long conferences with the queen\r\nalone, of which the particulars never transpired, took his leave and\r\nreturned home, re-committing his cause to the skilful management of his\r\nown agent, and the discussion of his brother's ambassadors.\r\n\r\nLong and frequent meetings of the privy-council were now held, by\r\ncommand of her majesty, for the discussion of the question of marriage;\r\nfrom the minutes of which some interesting details may be recovered.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Sussex was still, as ever, strongly in favor of the match;\r\nand chiefly, as it appears, from an apprehension that France and Spain\r\nmight otherwise join to dethrone the queen and set up another in her\r\nplace. Lord Hunsdon was on the same side, as was also the lord-admiral\r\n(the earl of Lincoln), but less warmly. Burleigh labored to find\r\narguments in support of the measure, but evidently against his judgement\r\nand to please the queen. Leicester openly professed to have changed his\r\nopinion, \"for her majesty was to be followed.\" Sir Walter Mildmay\r\nreasoned freely and forcibly against the measure, on the ground of the\r\ntoo advanced age of the queen, and the religion, the previous public\r\nconduct and the family connexions of Anjou. Sir Ralph Sadler subscribed\r\nto most of the objections of Mildmay, and brought forward additional\r\nones. Sir Henry Sidney approved all these, and subjoined, \"that the\r\nmarriage could not be made good by all the counsel between England and\r\nRome; a mass might not be suffered in the court;\" meaning, probably,\r\nthat the marriage rite could not by any expedient be accommodated to the\r\nconsciences of both parties and the law of England.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, with the single exception perhaps of the earl of Sussex,\r\nthose counsellors who pronounced in favor of the marriage in this\r\ndebate, did so, almost avowedly, in compliance with the wishes of the\r\nqueen, whose inclination to the alliance had become very evident since\r\nthe visit of her youthful suitor; while such as opposed it were moved by\r\nstrong and earnest convictions of the gross impropriety and thorough\r\nunsuitableness of the match, with respect to Elizabeth herself, and the\r\ndreadful evils which it was likely to entail on the nation. How entirely\r\nthe real sentiments of this body were adverse to the step, became\r\nfurther evident when the council, instead of immediately obeying her\r\nmajesty's command, that they should come to a formal decision on the\r\nquestion and acquaint her with the same, hesitated, temporized, assured\r\nher of their readiness to be entirely guided on a matter so personal to\r\nherself, by her feelings and wishes; requested to be further informed\r\nwhat these might be, and inquired whether, under all the circumstances,\r\nshe was desirous of their coming to a full determination. \"This message\r\nwas reported to her majesty in the forenoon,\" (October 7th 1579) \"and\r\nshe allowed very well of the dutiful offer of their services.\r\nNevertheless, she uttered many speeches, and that not without shedding\r\nof many tears, that she should find in her councillors, by their long\r\ndisputations, any disposition to make it doubtful, whether there could\r\nbe any more surety for her and her realm than to have her marry and have\r\na child of her own body to inherit, and so to continue the line of king\r\nHenry the eighth; and she said she condemned herself of simplicity in\r\ncommitting this matter to be argued by them, for that she thought, to\r\nhave rather had an universal request made to her to proceed in this\r\nmarriage, than to have made doubt of it; and being much troubled\r\nherewith she requested\" the bearers of this message \"to forbear her till\r\nthe afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nOn their return, she repeated her former expressions of displeasure;\r\nthen endeavoured at some length to refute the objections brought against\r\nthe match; and finally, her \"great misliking\" of all opposition, and her\r\nearnest desire for the marriage, being reported to her faithful council,\r\nthey agreed, after long consultations, to offer her their services in\r\nfurtherance of it, should such really be her pleasure[84].\r\n\r\n[Note 84: \"Burleigh Papers,\" by Murdin, _passim._]\r\n\r\nBut the country possessed some men less obsequious than\r\nprivy-councillors, who could not endure to stand by in silence and\r\nbehold the great public interests here at stake surrendered in slavish\r\ndeference to the fond fancy of a romantic woman, caught by the image of\r\na passion which she was no longer of an age to inspire, and which she\r\nought to have felt it an indecorum to entertain. Of this number, to his\r\nimmortal honor, was Philip Sidney. This young gentleman bore at the time\r\nthe courtly office of cup-bearer to the queen, and was looking for\r\nfurther advancement at her hands; and as on a former occasion he had not\r\nscrupled to administer some food to her preposterous desire of personal\r\nadmiration, Elizabeth, when she applied to him for his opinion on her\r\nmarriage, assuredly did so in the hope and expectation of hearing from\r\nhim something more graceful to her ears than the language of truth and\r\nwisdom. But Sidney had beheld with his own eyes the horrors of the Paris\r\nmassacre; he had imbibed with all the eagerness of a youthful and\r\ngenerous mind the principles of his friend the excellent Hubert Languet,\r\none of the ablest advocates of the protestant cause; and he had since,\r\non his embassy to Germany and Holland, enjoyed the favor and\r\ncontemplated the illustrious virtues of William prince of Orange its\r\nheroic champion.\r\n\r\nTo this sacred cause the purposed marriage must prove, as he well knew,\r\ndeeply injurious, and to the reputation of his sovereign fatal:--this\r\nwas enough to decide his judgement and his conduct; and magnanimously\r\ndisdaining the suggestions of a selfish and servile policy, he replied\r\nto the demand of her majesty, by a letter of dissuasion, almost of\r\nremonstrance, at once the most eloquent and the most courageous piece of\r\nthat nature which the age can boast. Every important view of the subject\r\nis comprised in this letter, which is long, but at the same time so\r\ncondensed in style, and so skilfully compacted as to matter, that it\r\nwell deserves to be read entire, and must lose materially either by\r\nabridgement or omission. Yet it may be permitted to detach from\r\npolitical reasonings, foreign to the nature and object of this work, a\r\nfew sentences referring more immediately to the personal character of\r\nAnjou, and displaying in a strong light the enormous unfitness of the\r\nconnexion; and also the animated and affectionate conclusion by which\r\nthe writer seems desirous to atone for the enunciation of so many\r\nunwelcome truths.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" speaking of her majesty's protestant subjects... \"These, how\r\nwill their hearts be galled, if not aliened, when they shall see you\r\ntake a husband, a Frenchman and a papist, in whom (howsoever fine wits\r\nmay find further dealings or painted excuses) the very common people\r\nwell know this, that he is the son of a Jezabel of our age; that his\r\nbrother made oblation of his own sister's marriage, the easier to make\r\nmassacres of our brethren in belief: That he himself, contrary to his\r\npromise and all gratefulness, having his liberty and principal estate\r\nby the Hugonots' means, did sack La Charite, and utterly spoil them with\r\nfire and sword! This, I say, even at first sight, gives occasion to all\r\ntruly religious to abhor such a master, and consequently to diminish\r\nmuch of the hopeful love they have long held to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now the agent party, which is Monsieur. Whether he be not apt to work\r\non the disadvantage of your estate, he is to be judged by his will and\r\npower: his will to be as full of light ambition as is possible, besides\r\nthe French disposition and his own education, his inconstant temper\r\nagainst his brother, his thrusting himself into the Low Country matters,\r\nhis sometimes seeking the king of Spain's daughter, sometimes your\r\nmajesty, are evident testimonies of his being carried away with every\r\nwind of hope; taught to love greatness any way gotten; and having for\r\nthe motioners and ministers of the mind only such young men as have\r\nshowed they think evil contentment a ground of any rebellion; who have\r\nseen no commonwealth but in faction, and divers of which have defiled\r\ntheir hands in odious murders. With such fancies and favorites what is\r\nto be hoped for? or that he will contain himself within the limits of\r\nyour conditions?\"\r\n\r\n....\"Against contempt, if there be any, which I will never believe, let\r\nyour excellent virtues of piety, justice and liberality, daily, if it be\r\npossible, more and more shine. Let such particular actions be found out\r\n(which be easy, as I think, to be done) by which you may gratify all the\r\nhearts of your people. Let those in whom you find trust, and to whom you\r\nhave committed trust, in your weighty affairs, be held up in the eyes\r\nof your subjects: Lastly, doing as you do, you shall be as you be, the\r\nexample of princes, the ornament of this age, and the most excellent\r\nfruit of your progenitors, and the perfect mirror of your posterity.\"\r\n\r\nSuch had ever been the devoted loyalty of Philip Sidney towards\r\nElizabeth, and so high was the place which he held in her esteem, that\r\nshe appears to have imputed the boldness of this letter to no motives\r\nbut good ones; and instead of resenting his interference in so delicate\r\na matter, she is thought to have been deeply moved by his eloquence, and\r\neven to have been influenced by it in the formation of her final\r\nresolve. But far other success attended the efforts of a different\r\ncharacter, who labored with equal zeal, equal reason, and probably not\r\ninferior purity of intention, though for less courtliness of address, to\r\ndeter rather than dissuade her from the match, on grounds much more\r\noffensive to her feelings, and by means of what was then accounted a\r\nseditious appeal to the passions and prejudices of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe work alluded to was entitled \"The discovery of a gaping gulf wherein\r\nEngland is like to be swallowed by another French marriage, if the Lord\r\nforbid not the banns by letting her see the sin and punishment thereof.\"\r\nIts author was a gentleman named Stubbs, then of Lincoln's Inn, and\r\npreviously of Bene't College Cambridge, where we are told that his\r\nintimacies had been formed among the more learned and ingenious class of\r\nstudents, and where the poet Spenser had become his friend. He was\r\nknown as a zealous puritan, and had given his sister in marriage to the\r\ncelebrated Edmund Cartwright the leader of the sect. It is probable that\r\nneither his religious principles nor this connexion were forgotten by\r\nthe queen in her estimate of his offence. A furious proclamation was\r\nissued against the book, all the copies of which were ordered to be\r\nseized and burned; and the author and publisher, being proceeded against\r\non a severe statute of Philip and Mary, which many lawyers held to be no\r\nlonger in force, were found guilty, and condemned to the barbarous\r\npunishment of amputation of the right hand.\r\n\r\nThe words of Stubbs on being brought to the scaffold to undergo his\r\nsentence have been preserved, and well merit transcription. \"What a\r\ngrief it is to the body to lose one of his members you all know. I am\r\ncome hither to receive my punishment according to the law. I am sorry\r\nfor the loss of my hand, and more sorry to lose it by judgement; but\r\nmost of all with her majesty's indignation and evil opinion, whom I have\r\nso highly displeased. Before I was condemned, I might speak for my\r\ninnocency; but now my mouth is stopped by judgement, to the which I\r\nsubmit myself, and am content patiently to endure whatsoever it pleaseth\r\nGod, of his secret providence, to lay upon me, and take it justly\r\ndeserved for my sins; and I pray God it may be an example to you all,\r\nthat it being so dangerous to offend the laws, without an evil meaning,\r\nas breedeth the loss of a hand, you may use your hands holily, and pray\r\nto God for the long preservation of her majesty over you, whom God hath\r\nused as an instrument for a long peace and many blessings over us; and\r\nspecially for his Gospel, whereby she hath made a way for us to rest and\r\nquietness to our consciences. For the French I force not; but my\r\ngreatest grief is, in so many weeks and days of imprisonment, her\r\nmajesty hath not once thought me worthy of her mercy, which she hath\r\noften times extended to divers persons in greater offences. For my hand,\r\nI esteem it not so much, for I think I could have saved it, and might do\r\nyet; but I will not have a guiltless heart and an infamous hand. I pray\r\nyou all to pray with me, that God will strengthen me to endure and abide\r\nthe pain that I am to suffer, and grant me this grace, that the loss of\r\nmy hand do not withdraw any part of my duty and affection toward her\r\nmajesty, and because, when so many veins of blood are opened, it is\r\nuncertain how they may be stayed, and what wilt be the event\r\nthereof.\".... The hand ready on the block to be stricken off, he said\r\noften to the people: \"Pray for me now my calamity is at hand.\" And so,\r\nwith these words, it was smitten off, whereof he swoonded[85].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 85: \"Nugae.\"]\r\n\r\nIn this speech, the language of which is so remarkably contrasted with\r\nthose abject submissions which fear extorted from the high-born victims\r\nof the tyranny of Henry VIII., the attentive reader will discern\r\nsomewhat of the same spirit which combated popery and despotism under\r\nthe Stuarts, though tempered by that loyal attachment towards the\r\nrestorer and protectress of reformed religion which dwelt in the hearts\r\nof all the protestant subjects of Elizabeth without exception.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of the more painful part of his sentence, Stubbs was\r\nfurther punished by an imprisonment of several months in the Tower: but\r\nunder all these inflictions, his courage and his cheerfulness were\r\nsupported by a firm persuasion of the goodness of the cause in which he\r\nsuffered. He wrote many letters to his friends with the left hand,\r\nsigning them Scaevola; a surname which it was his pleasure to adopt in\r\nmemory of a circumstance by which he did not feel himself to be the\r\nperson dishonored. Such was the opinion entertained by Burleigh of the\r\ntheological learning of this eminent person and the soundness of his\r\nprinciples, that he engaged him in 1587 to answer Cardinal Allen's\r\nviolent book entitled \"The English Justice;\" a task which he is said to\r\nhave performed with distinguished ability.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the year 1580, the important question of the queen's\r\nmarriage remained in an undecided state. The court of France appears to\r\nhave suffered the treaty to languish, and Elizabeth, conscious no doubt\r\nthat her fond inclination could only be gratified at the expense of that\r\npopularity which it had been the leading object of her policy to\r\ncherish, sought not to revive it. Various circumstances occurred to\r\noccupy public attention during the interval.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas Bacon, who under the humbler title of lord keeper had\r\nexercised from the beginning of the reign the office of lord high\r\nchancellor, died generally regretted in 1579. No one is recorded to have\r\nfilled this important post with superior assiduity or a greater\r\nreputation for uprightness and ability than sir Nicholas, and several\r\nwell-known traits afford a highly pleasing image of the general\r\ncharacter of his mind. Of this number are his motto, \"_Mediocria\r\nfirma_,\" and his handsome reply to the remark of her majesty that his\r\nhouse was too little for him;--\"No, madam; but you have made me too big\r\nfor my house.\" Even when, upon this royal hint, he erected his elegant\r\nmansion of Gorhambury, he was still careful not to lose sight of that\r\nidea of lettered privacy in which he loved to indulge; and the\r\naccomplishments of his mind were reflected in the decorations of his\r\nhome. In the gardens, on which his chief care and cost were bestowed,\r\narose a banqueting-house consecrated to the seven Sciences, whose\r\nfigures adorned the walls, each subscribed with a Latin distich and\r\nsurrounded with portraits of her most celebrated votaries; a temple in\r\nwhich we may imagine the youthful mind of that illustrious son of his,\r\nwho \"took all learning to be\" his \"province,\" receiving with delight its\r\nearliest inspiration! In his second wife,--one of the learned daughters\r\nof sir Anthony Cook, a woman of a keen and penetrating intellect, and\r\nmuch distinguished by her zeal for reformed religion in its austerer\r\nforms,--sir Nicholas found a partner capable of sharing his views and\r\nappreciating his character. By her he became the father of two sons;\r\nthat remarkable man Anthony Bacon, and Francis, the light of science,\r\nthe interpreter of nature; the admiration of his own age, and the wonder\r\nof succeeding ones; the splendid dawn of whose unrivalled genius his\r\nfather was happy enough to behold; more happy still in not surviving to\r\nwitness the calamitous eclipse which overshadowed his reputation at its\r\nhighest noon.\r\n\r\nThe lord keeper was esteemed the second pillar of that state of which\r\nBurleigh was the prime support. In all public measures of importance\r\nthey acted together; and similar speculative opinions, with coinciding\r\nviews of national policy, united these two eminent statesmen in a\r\nbrotherhood dearer than that of alliance; but in their motives of\r\naction, and in the character of their minds, a diversity was observable\r\nwhich it may be useful to point out.\r\n\r\nOf Burleigh it has formerly been remarked, that with his own interest he\r\nconsidered also, and perhaps equally, that of his queen and his country:\r\nbut the patriotism of Bacon seems to have risen higher; and his\r\nconformity with the wishes and sentiments of his sovereign was less\r\nobsequiously exact. In the affair of lady Catherine Grey's title, he did\r\nnot hesitate to risk the favor of the queen and his own continuance in\r\noffice, for the sake of what appeared to him the cause of religion and\r\nhis country. On the whole, however, moderation and prudence were the\r\ngoverning principles of his mind and actions. The intellect of Burleigh\r\nwas more versatile and acute, that of Bacon more profound; and their\r\nparts in the great drama of public life were cast accordingly: Burleigh\r\nhad most of the alertness of observation, the fertility of expedient,\r\nthe rapid calculation of contingencies, required in the minister of\r\nstate; Bacon, of the gravity and steadfastness which clothe with\r\nreverence and authority the counsellor and judge. \"He was a plain man,\"\r\nsays Francis Bacon of his father, \"direct and constant, without all\r\nfinesse and doubleness, and one that was of a mind that a man in his\r\nprivate proceedings and estate, and in the proceedings of state, should\r\nrest upon the soundness and strength of his own courses, and not upon\r\npractice to circumvent others.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Elizabeth had forgiven his interference respecting the succession,\r\nno one was held by her in greater honor and esteem than her lord keeper;\r\nshe visited him frequently, conversed with him familiarly; took pleasure\r\nin the flashes of wit which often relieved the seriousness of his\r\nwisdom; and flattered with kind condescension his parental feelings by\r\nthe extraordinary notice which she bestowed on his son Francis, whose\r\nbrightness and solidity of parts early manifested themselves to her\r\ndiscerning eye, and caused her to predict that her \"little lord keeper\"\r\nwould one day prove an eminent man.\r\n\r\nGreat interest was excited by the arrival in Plymouth harbour, in\r\nNovember 1580, of the celebrated Francis Drake from his circumnavigation\r\nof the globe. National vanity was flattered by the idea that this\r\nEnglishman should have been the first commander-in-chief by whom this\r\ngreat and novel enterprise had been successfully achieved; and both\r\nhimself and his ship became in an eminent degree the objects of public\r\ncuriosity and wonder. The courage, skill and perseverance of this great\r\nnavigator were deservedly extolled; the wealth which he had brought\r\nhome, from the plunder of the Spanish settlements, awakened the cupidity\r\nwhich in that age was a constant attendant on the daring spirit of\r\nmaritime adventure, and half the youth of the country were on fire to\r\nembark in expeditions of pillage and discovery.\r\n\r\nBut the court was not so easily induced to second the ardor of the\r\nnation. Drake's captures from the Spaniards had been made, under some\r\nvague notion of reprisals, whilst no open war was subsisting between the\r\nnations; and the Spanish ambassador, not, it must be confessed, without\r\nsome reason, branded his proceedings with the reproach of piracy, and\r\nloudly demanded restitution of the booty. Elizabeth wavered for some\r\ntime between admiration of the valiant Drake, mixed with a desire of\r\nsharing in the profits of his expedition, and a dread of incensing the\r\nking of Spain; but she at length decided on the part most acceptable to\r\nher people,--that of giving a public sanction to his acts. During the\r\nspring of 1581 she accepted of a banquet on board his ship off Deptford,\r\nconferred on him the order of knighthood, and received him into favor.\r\n\r\nMuch anxiety and alarm was about this time occasioned to the queen and\r\nher protestant subjects by the clandestine arrival in the country of a\r\nconsiderable number of catholic priests, mostly English by birth, but\r\neducated at the seminaries respectively founded at Douay, Rheims, and\r\nRome, by the king of Spain, cardinal Lorrain, and the pope, for the\r\nexpress purpose of furnishing means for the disturbance of the queen's\r\ngovernment. Monks of the new order of Jesuits presided over these\r\nestablishments, who made it their business to inspire the pupils with\r\nthe most frightful excess of bigotry and fanaticism; and two of these\r\nfriars, fathers Parsons and Campion, coming over to England to guide and\r\nregulate the efforts of their party, were detected in treasonable\r\npractices; on account of which Campion, with some accomplices, underwent\r\ncapital punishment, or, in the language of his church, received the\r\ncrown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIn order to check the diffusion among the rising generation of doctrines\r\nso destructive of the peace and good government of the country, a\r\nproclamation was issued in June 1580, requiring that all persons who had\r\nany children, wards, or kinsmen, in any parts beyond seas, should within\r\nten days give in their names to the ordinaries, and within four months\r\nsend for them home again.\r\n\r\nCircular letters were also dispatched by the privy-council to the\r\nbishops, setting forth, that whereas her majesty found daily\r\ninconvenience to the realm by the education of numbers of young\r\ngentlemen and others her subjects in parts beyond the seas;--where for\r\nthe most part they were \"nourselled and nourished in papistry,\" with\r\nsuch instructions as \"made them to mislike the government of their\r\ncountry, and thus tended to render them undutiful subjects;\" &c. and\r\nintending to \"take some present order therein;\" as well by prohibiting\r\nthat any but such as were known to be well affected in religion, and\r\nwould undertake for the good education of their children, should send\r\nthem abroad; and they not without her majesty's special license;--as\r\nalso, by recalling such as were at present, in Spain, France, or Italy,\r\nwithout such license;--had commanded that the bishops should call before\r\nthem, in their respective dioceses, certain parents or guardians whose\r\nnames were annexed, and bind them in good sums of money for the recall\r\nof their sons or wards within three months[86]. Many other indications\r\nof a jealousy of the abode of English youth in catholic countries, which\r\nat such a juncture will scarcely appear unreasonable, might be collected\r\nfrom various sources.\r\n\r\n[Note 86: Strype's \"Whitgift.\"]\r\n\r\nA friend of Anthony Bacon's sends him this warning to Bordeaux in 1583:\r\n\"I can no longer abstain from telling you plainly that the injury is\r\ngreat, you do to yourself, and your best friends, in this your voluntary\r\nbanishment (for so it is already termed).... The times are not as\r\nheretofore for the best disposed travellers: but in one word, sir,\r\nbelieve me, they are not the best thought of where they would be that\r\ntake any delight to absent themselves in foreign parts, especially such\r\nas are of quality, and known to have no other cause than their private\r\ncontentment; which also is not allowable, or to be for any long time, as\r\nyou will shortly hear further; touching these limitations. In the mean\r\ntime I could wish you looked well to yourself, and to think, that\r\nwhilst you live there, perhaps in no great security, you are within the\r\ncompass of some sinister conceits or hard speeches here, if not of that\r\njealousy which is now had even of the best, that in these doubtful days,\r\nwherein our country hath need to be furnished of the soundest members\r\nand truest hearts to God and prince, do yet take delight to live in\r\nthose parts where our utter ruin is threatened[87]: &c.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 87: Birch's \"Memoirs.\"]\r\n\r\n\"The old lord Burleigh,\" says a contemporary, \"if any one came to the\r\nlords of the council for a license to travel, would first examine him of\r\nEngland. And if he found him ignorant, would bid him stay at home and\r\nknow his own country first[88].\" A plausible evasion, doubtless, of\r\nrequests with which that cautious minister judged it inexpedient to\r\ncomply.\r\n\r\n[Note 88: \"Complete Gentleman,\" by H. Peacham.]\r\n\r\nThese machinations of the papists afforded a plea to the puritans in the\r\nhouse of commons for the enactment of still severer laws against this\r\nalready persecuted sect; and Elizabeth judged it expedient to accord a\r\nready assent to these statutes, for the purpose of tranquillizing the\r\nminds of her protestant subjects on the score of religion, previously to\r\nthe renewal of negotiations with the court of France.\r\n\r\nSimier, who still remained in England, had been but too successful in\r\ncontinuing or reviving the tender impressions created in the heart of\r\nthe queen by the personal attentions of his master; and the French\r\nking, finding leisure to turn his attention once more to this object,\r\nfrom which he had been apparently diverted by the civil wars which had\r\nbroken out afresh in his country, was encouraged to send in 1581 a\r\nsplendid embassy, headed by a prince of the blood, to settle the terms\r\nof this august alliance, of which every one now expected to see the\r\ncompletion. A magnificent reception was prepared by Elizabeth for these\r\nnoble strangers; but she had the weakness to choose to appear before\r\nthem in the borrowed character of a heroine of romance, rather than in\r\nthat of a great princess whose vigorous yet cautious politics had\r\nrendered her for more than twenty years the admiration of all the\r\nstatesmen of Europe. She caused to be erected on the south side of her\r\npalace of Whitehall, a vast banqueting-house framed of timber and\r\ncovered with painted canvass, which was decorated internally in a style\r\nof the most fantastic gaudiness. Pendants of fruits of various kinds\r\n(amongst which cucumbers and carrots are enumerated) were hung from\r\nfestoons of ivy, bay, rosemary, and different flowers, the whole\r\nlavishly sprinkled with gold spangles: the ceiling was painted like a\r\nsky, with stars, sunbeams, and clouds, intermixed with scutcheons of the\r\nroyal arms; and a profusion of glass lustres illuminated the whole. In\r\nthis enchanted palace the French ambassadors were entertained by the\r\nmaiden queen at several splendid banquets, while her ministers were\r\nengaged by her command in drawing up the marriage articles. Meantime\r\nseveral of her youthful courtiers, anxious to complete the gay illusion\r\nin the imagination of their sovereign, prepared for the exhibition of\r\nwhat was called _a triumph_,--of which the following was the plan.\r\n\r\nThe young earl of Arundel, lord Windsor, Philip Sidney, and Fulke\r\nGreville, the four challengers, styled themselves the foster-children of\r\nDesire, and to that end of the tilt-yard where her majesty was seated,\r\ntheir adulation gave the name of the Castle of Perfect Beauty. This\r\ncastle the queen was summoned to surrender in a very courtly message\r\ndelivered by a boy dressed in red and white, the colours of Desire. On\r\nher refusal, a mount placed on wheels was rolled into the tilt-yard, and\r\nthe four cavaliers rode in superbly armed and accoutred, and each at the\r\nhead of a splendid troop; and when they had passed in military order\r\nbefore the queen, the boy who had delivered the former message thus\r\nagain addressed her:--\r\n\r\n\"If the message lately delivered unto you had been believed and\r\nfollowed, O queen! in whom the whole story of virtue is written with the\r\nlanguage of beauty; nothing should this violence have needed in your\r\ninviolate presence. Your eyes, which till now have been wont to discern\r\nonly the bowed knees of kneeling hearts, and, inwardly turned, found\r\nalways the heavenly peace of a sweet mind, should not now have their\r\nfair beams reflected with the shining of armour, should not now be\r\ndriven to see the fury of desire, nor the fiery force of fury. But sith\r\nso it is (alas that it is so!) that in the defence of obstinate refusal\r\nthere never groweth victory but by compassion, they are come:--what need\r\nI say more? You see them, ready in heart as you know, and able with\r\nhands, as they hope, not only to assailing, but to prevailing.\r\nPerchance you despise the smallness of number. I say unto you, the force\r\nof Desire goeth not by fulness of company. Nay, rather view with what\r\nirresistible determination themselves approach, and how not only the\r\nheavens send their invisible instruments to aid them, (_music within the\r\nmount_) but also the very earth, the dullest of all the elements, which\r\nwith natural heaviness still strives to the sleepy centre, yet, for\r\nadvancing this enterprise, is content actively (as you shall see) to\r\nmove itself upon itself to rise up in height, that it may the better\r\ncommand the high and high-minded fortresses.\r\n\r\n\"(_Here the mount rose up in height._) Many words, when deeds are in the\r\nfield, are tedious both unto the speaker and hearer. You see their\r\nforces, but know not their fortunes: if you be resolved, it boots not,\r\nand threats dread not. I have discharged my charge, which was even when\r\nall things were ready for the assault, then to offer parley, a thing not\r\nso much used as gracious in besiegers. You shall now be summoned to\r\nyield, which if it be rejected, then look for the affectionate alarm to\r\nbe followed with desirous assault. The time approacheth for their\r\napproaches, but no time shall stay me from wishing, that however this\r\nsucceed the world may long enjoy its chiefest ornament, which decks it\r\nwith herself, and herself with the love of goodness.\"\r\n\r\nThe rolling mount was now moved close to the queen, the music sounded,\r\nand one of the boys accompanied with cornets sung a fresh summons to the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nWhen this was ended, another boy, turning to the challengers and their\r\nretinue, sung an alarm, which ended, the two canons were shot off, 'the\r\none with sweet powder and the other with sweet water, very odoriferous\r\nand pleasant, and the noise of the shooting was very excellent consent\r\nof melody within the mount. And after that, was store of pretty\r\nscaling-ladders, and the footmen threw flowers and such fancies against\r\nthe walls, with all such devices as might seem fit shot for Desire. All\r\nwhich did continue till time the defendants came in.' These were above\r\ntwenty in number, and each accompanied by his servants, pages, and\r\ntrumpeters. Speeches were delivered to the queen on the part of these\r\nknights, several of whom appeared in some assumed character; sir Thomas\r\nPerrot and Anthony Cook thought proper to personate Adam and Eve; the\r\nlatter having 'hair hung all down his helmet.' The messenger sent on the\r\npart of Thomas Ratcliff described his master as a forlorn knight, whom\r\ndespair of achieving the favor of his peerless and sunlike mistress had\r\ndriven out of the haunts of men into a cave of the desert, where moss\r\nwas his couch, and moss, moistened by tears, his only food. Even here\r\nhowever the report of this assault upon the castle of Perfect Beauty had\r\nreached his ears, and roused him from his slumber of despondency; and in\r\ntoken of his devoted loyalty and inviolable fidelity to his divine lady,\r\nhe sent his shield, which he in treated her to accept as the ensign of\r\nher fame, and the instrument of his glory, prostrating himself at her\r\nfeet as one ready to undertake any adventures in hope of her gracious\r\nfavor.--Of this romantic picture of devoted and despairing passion the\r\ndescription of Amadis de Gaul at the Poor Rock seems to have been the\r\nprototype.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the four sons of sir Francis Knolles, Mercury appeared,\r\nand described them as 'legitimate sons of Despair, brethren to hard\r\nmishap, suckled with sighs, and swathed up in sorrow, weaned in woe, and\r\ndry nursed by Desire, longtime fostered with favorable countenance, and\r\nfed with sweet fancies, but now of late (alas) wholly given over to\r\ngrief and disgraced by disdain.' &c. The speeches being ended, probably\r\nto the relief of the hearers, the tilting commenced and lasted till\r\nnight. It was resumed the next day with some fresh circumstances of\r\nmagnificence and a few more harangues:--at length the challengers\r\npresented to the queen an olive bough in token of their humble\r\nsubmission, and both parties were dismissed by her with thanks and\r\ncommendations[89].\r\n\r\n[Note 89: Holinshed.]\r\n\r\nBy whom the speeches for this triumph were composed does not appear; but\r\ntheir style appears to correspond very exactly with that of John Lilly,\r\na dramatic poet who in this year gave to the public a romance in two\r\nparts; the first entitled \"Euphues the Anatomy of Wit,\" the second\r\n\"Euphues and his England.\" A work which in despite, or rather perhaps by\r\nfavor, of the new and singular affectations with which it was overrun,\r\nobtained extraordinary popularity, and communicated its infection for a\r\ntime to the style of polite writing and fashionable speech.\r\n\r\nAn author of the present day, whose elegant taste and whose profound\r\nacquaintance with the writers of this and the following reign entitle\r\nhim to be heard with deference, has favored us with his opinion of\r\nEuphues in these words. \"This production is a tissue of antithesis and\r\nalliteration, and therefore justly entitled to the appellation of\r\n_affected_; but we cannot with Berkenhout consider it as a most\r\n_contemptible piece of nonsense_[90]. The moral is uniformly good; the\r\nvices and follies of the day are attacked with much force and keenness;\r\nthere is in it much display of the manners of the times; and though as a\r\ncomposition it is very meretricious and sometimes absurd in point of\r\nornament, yet the construction of its sentences is frequently turned\r\nwith peculiar neatness and spirit, though with much monotony of\r\ncadence.\" \"So greatly,\" adds the same writer, \"was the style of Euphues\r\nadmired in the court of Elizabeth, and, indeed, throughout the kingdom,\r\nthat it became a proof of refined manners to adopt its phraseology.\r\nEdward Blount, who republished six of Lilly's plays in 1632, under the\r\ntitle of _Sixe Court Comedies_, declares that 'Our nation are in his\r\ndebt for a new English which he taught them. '_Euphues_ and his\r\n_England_,' he adds, 'began first that language. All our ladies were\r\nthen his scholars; and that beauty in court who could not parley\r\nEuphuesme, was as little regarded as she which now there speaks not\r\nFrench:' a representation certainly not exaggerated; for Ben Jonson,\r\ndescribing a fashionable lady, makes her address her gallant in the\r\nfollowing terms;--'O master Brisk, (as it is in Euphues,) hard is the\r\nchoice when one is compelled, either by silence to die with grief, or by\r\nspeaking, to live with shame:' upon which Mr. Whalley observes, that\r\n'the court ladies in Elizabeth's time had all the phrases of Euphues by\r\nheart'[91].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 90: Berkenhout's \"Biographia Literaria,\" p. 377, note _a_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 91: \"Shakspeare and his Times:\" &c. by Nathan Drake, M.D.]\r\n\r\nShakespeare is believed to have satirized the affectations of Lilly,\r\namongst other prevailing modes of pedantry and bad taste, under the\r\ncharacter of the schoolmaster Holophernes; and to Sidney is ascribed by\r\nDrayton the merit, that he\r\n\r\n    ...\"did first reduce\r\n    Our tongue from Lilly's writing then in use,\r\n    Talking of stones, stars, plants, of fishes, flies,\r\n    Playing with words and idle similies.\"\r\n\r\nBut in this statement there is an inaccuracy, if it refers to the better\r\nmodel of style furnished by him in his Arcadia, since that work, though\r\nnot published till after the death of its author, is known to have been\r\ncomposed previously to the appearance of Euphues. Possibly however the\r\nlines of Drayton may be explained as alluding to the critical precepts\r\ncontained in Sidney's Defence of Poetry, which was written in 1582 or\r\n1583.\r\n\r\nIt may appear extraordinary that this accomplished person, after his\r\nnoble letter of remonstrance against the French marriage, should have\r\nconsented to take so conspicuous a part in festivities designed to\r\ncelebrate the arrival of the commissioners by whom its terms were to be\r\nconcluded. But the actions of every man, it may be pleaded, belong to\r\nsuch an age, or such a station, as well as to such a school of\r\nphilosophy, religious sect, political party, or natural class of\r\ncharacter; and the spirit which prompted this eminent person to aspire\r\nafter all praise and every kind of glory, compelled him, at the court of\r\nElizabeth, to unite, with whatever incongruity, the quaint personage of\r\na knight errant of romance and a devotee of the beauties and perfections\r\nof his liege lady, with the manly attributes of an English patriot and a\r\nchampion of reformed religion.\r\n\r\nFulke Greville furnishes another instance of a respectable character\r\nstrangely disguised by the affectations and servilities of a courtier of\r\nthis \"Queen of Faery.\" He was the cousin, school-fellow, and inseparable\r\ncompanion of Sidney, and so devoted to him that, in the inscription\r\nwhich he composed long after for his own tomb, he entitled himself\r\n\"servant to queen Elizabeth, councillor to king James, and friend to sir\r\nPhilip Sidney.\" Born to a fortune so ample as to render him entirely\r\nindependent of the emoluments of office or the favors of a sovereign,\r\nand early smitten with a passion for the gentle muse which rendered him\r\nnearly insensible to the enticements of ambition, Greville was yet\r\ncontented to devote himself, as a volunteer, to that court-life the\r\nirksomeness of which has often been treated as insupportable by men who\r\nhave embraced it from interest or from necessity.\r\n\r\nA devotedness so signal was not indeed suffered to go without its\r\nreward. Besides that it obtained for him a lucrative place, Naunton says\r\nof Greville, \"He had no mean place in queen Elizabeth's favor, neither\r\ndid he hold it for any short time or term; for, if I be not deceived, he\r\nhad the longest lease, the smoothest time without rubs, of any of her\r\nfavorites.\" Lord Bacon also testifies that he \"had much and private\r\naccess to her, which he used honorably and did many men good: yet he\r\nwould say merrily of himself, that he was like Robin Goodfellow; for\r\nwhen the maids spilt the milk-pans or kept any racket, they would lay it\r\nupon Robin: so what tales the ladies about the queen told her, or other\r\nbad offices that they did, they would put it upon him.\" The poems of\r\nFulke Greville, celebrated and fashionable in his own time, but now\r\nknown only to the more curious students of our early literature, consist\r\nof two tragedies in interwoven rhyme, with choruses on the Greek model;\r\na hundred love sonnets, in one of which he styles his mistress \"Fair\r\ndog:\" and \"Treaties\" \"on Human learning,\" \"on Fame and Honor,\" and \"of\r\nWars.\" Of these pieces the last three, as well as the tragedies, contain\r\nmany noble, free, and virtuous sentiments; many fine and ingenious\r\nthoughts, and some elegant lines; but the harshness and pedantry of the\r\nstyle render their perusal on the whole more of a fatigue than a\r\npleasure, and they have gradually sunk into that neglect which\r\nconstantly awaits the verse of which it has been the aim to instruct\r\nrather than to delight. Among the English patrons of letters however,\r\nFulke Greville, afterwards lord Brook, will ever deserve a conspicuous\r\nstation; and Speed and Camden have gratefully recorded their obligations\r\nboth to his liberality and to his honorable exertion of court interest.\r\n\r\nThe articles of the marriage-treaty were at length concluded between the\r\ncommissioners of France and England, and it was stipulated that the\r\nnuptials should take place six weeks after their ratification: but\r\nElizabeth, whose uncertainties were not yet at an end, had insisted on a\r\nseparate article purporting, that she should not however be obliged to\r\ncomplete the marriage until further matters, not specified, should have\r\nbeen settled between herself and the duke of Anjou; by which stipulation\r\nit still remained in her power to render the whole negotiation vain.\r\n\r\nThe moment that all opposition on the part of her privy-council was\r\nover, and every external obstacle surmounted, Elizabeth seems to have\r\nbegun to recover her sound discretion, and to see in their true\r\nmagnitude all the objections to which she had hitherto been anxious to\r\nblind her own eyes and those of others. She sent Walsingham to open new\r\nnegotiations at Paris, and to try whether the league offensive and\r\ndefensive, stipulated by the late articles, could not be brought to\r\neffect before the marriage, which she now discovered that it was not a\r\nconvenient season to complete. The French court, after some hesitation,\r\nhad just been brought to agree to this proposal, when she inclined again\r\nto go on with the marriage; but no sooner had it resumed with alacrity\r\nthis part of the discussion, than she again declared for the alliance.\r\nWalsingham, puzzled and vexed by such a series of capricious changes,\r\nproceeding from motives in which state-expediency had no share, remained\r\nuncertain how to act; and at length all the politicians English and\r\nFrench, equally disconcerted, seem to have acquiesced in the conviction\r\nthat this strange strife must end where it began, in the bosom of\r\nElizabeth herself, while nothing was left to them but to await the\r\nresult in anxious silence. But the duke of Anjou, aware that from a\r\nyouthful lover some unequivocal symptoms of impatience would be\r\nrequired, and that upon a skilful display of this kind his final success\r\nmight depend, brought to a speedy conclusion his campaign in the\r\nNetherlands, which a liberal supply of money from the English queen, who\r\nnow concurred in his views, had rendered uniformly successful, and\r\nputting his army into winter-quarters, hurried over to England to throw\r\nhimself at her feet.\r\n\r\nHe was welcomed with all the demonstrations of satisfaction which could\r\nrevive or confirm the hopes of a suitor; every mark of honor, every\r\npledge of affection, was publicly conferred upon him; and the queen, at\r\nthe conclusion of a splendid festival on the anniversary of her\r\ncoronation, even went so far as to place on his finger a ring drawn from\r\nher own. This passed in sight of the whole assembled court, who\r\nnaturally regarded the action as a kind of betrothment; and the long\r\nsuspense being apparently ended, the feelings of every party broke forth\r\nwithout restraint or disguise.\r\n\r\nSome rejoiced; more grieved or wondered; Leicester, Hatton and\r\nWalsingham loudly exclaimed that ruin impended over the church, the\r\ncountry, and the queen. The ladies of the court alarmed and agitated\r\ntheir mistress by tears, cries, and lamentations. A sleepless and\r\nmiserable night was passed by the queen amid her disconsolate handmaids:\r\nthe next morning she sent for Anjou, and held with him a long private\r\nconversation; after which he retired to his chamber, and hastily\r\nthrowing from him, but as quickly resuming, the ring which she had given\r\nhim, uttered many reproaches against the levity of women and the\r\nfickleness of islanders.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account given by the annalist Camden; our only authority for\r\ncircumstances some of them so public in their nature that it is\r\nsurprising they should not be recorded by others, the rest so secret\r\nthat we are at a loss to conceive how they should have become known to\r\nhim. What is certain in the matter is,--that the French prince remained\r\nin England above two months after this festival;--that no diminution of\r\nthe queen's attentions to him became apparent during that time;--that\r\nwhen his affairs imperiously demanded his return to the Netherlands,\r\nElizabeth still detained him that she might herself conduct him on his\r\nway as far as Canterbury;--that she then dismissed him with a large\r\nsupply of money and a splendid retinue of English lords and gentlemen,\r\nand that he promised a quick return.\r\n\r\nLet us hear on the subject lord Talbot's report to his father.\r\n\r\n...\"Monsieur hath taken shipping into Flanders...there is gone over\r\nwith him my lord of Leicester, my lord Hunsdon, my lord Charles Howard,\r\nmy lord Thomas Howard, my lord Windsor, my lord Sheffield, my lord\r\nWilloughby, and a number of young gentlemen besides. As soon as he is at\r\nAntwerp all the Englishmen return, which is thought will be about a\r\nfortnight hence.... The departure was mournful between her majesty and\r\nMonsieur; she loth to let him go, and he as loth to depart. Her majesty\r\non her return will be long in no place in which she lodged as she went,\r\nneither will she come to Whitehall, because the places shall not give\r\ncause of remembrance to her of him with whom she so unwillingly parted.\r\nMonsieur promised his return in March, but how his Low Country causes\r\nwill permit him is uncertain. Her highness went no further but\r\nCanterbury, Monsieur took shipping at Sandwich[92].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 92: \"Illustrations,\" vol. ii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\nIt is, after all, extremely difficult to decide whether the\r\ncircumstances here related ought to invalidate any part of Camden's\r\nnarrative. There can be no doubt that Elizabeth had at times been\r\nviolently tempted to accept this young prince for a husband; and even\r\nwhen she sent Walsingham to France instructed to conclude, if possible,\r\nthe league without the marriage, she evidently had not in her own mind\r\nabsolutely concluded against the latter measure, because she\r\nparticularly charged him to examine whether the duke, who had lately\r\nrecovered from the small pox, still retained enough of his good looks to\r\nengage a lady's affections. It is probable that his second visit\r\nrevived her love; and the truth of the circumstance of her publicly\r\npresenting to him a ring, is confirmed by Camden's further statement,\r\nthat St. Aldegond, minister in England for the United Provinces, wrote\r\nword of it to the States, who, regarding the match as now concluded,\r\ncaused public rejoicings to be celebrated at Antwerp. After this the\r\nduke would undoubtedly press for a speedy solemnization, and he cannot\r\nbut have experienced some degree of disappointment in at length quitting\r\nthe country, _re infecta_. But it was still greatly and obviously his\r\ninterest to remain on the best possible terms with Elizabeth, in order\r\nto secure from her that co-operation, and those pecuniary aids, on which\r\nthe success of his affairs in the Netherlands must mainly depend. It is\r\neven possible that a further acquaintance with the state of public\r\nopinion in England, and with the temper, maxims, and personal qualities\r\nof the queen herself, might very much abate the poignancy of his\r\nmortification, or even incline him secretly to prefer the character of\r\nher ally to that of her husband. Be this as it may, the favorite son of\r\nCatherine de' Medici was a sufficient adept in the dissimulation of\r\ncourts to assume with ease all the demonstrations of complacency and\r\ngood understanding that the case required, whatever portion of\r\nindignation or malice he might conceal in his heart. Neither was\r\nElizabeth a novice in the arts of feigning; and even without the\r\npromptings of those tender regrets which accompany a sacrifice extorted\r\nby reason from inclination, she would have been careful, by every\r\nmanifestation of friendship and esteem, to smooth over the affront which\r\nher change of purpose had compelled her to put upon the brother and heir\r\nof so potent a monarch as the king of France.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to the continent, the duke of Anjou lost at\r\nonce his reputation, and his hopes of an independent principality, in an\r\nunprincipled and abortive attempt on the liberties of the provinces\r\nwhich had chosen him as their protector; and his death, which soon\r\nfollowed, brings to a conclusion this long and mortifying chapter,\r\noccupied with the follies of the wise. It is worth observing, that\r\nappearances in this affair were kept up to the last: the English\r\nambassador refrained from giving in his official letters any particulars\r\nof the last illness of Monsieur, lest he should aggravate the grief of\r\nher majesty; and the king of France, in defiance of some established\r\nrules of court precedence and etiquette, admitted this minister to pay\r\nhis compliments of condolence before all others, professedly because he\r\nrepresented that princess who best loved his brother.\r\n\r\nBohun ends his minute description of \"the habit of queen Elizabeth in\r\npublic and private\" with a passage proper to complete this portion of\r\nher history. \"The coming of the duke d'Alencon opened a way to a more\r\nfree way of living, and relaxed very much the old severe form of\r\ndiscipline. The queen danced often then, and omitted no sort of\r\nrecreation, pleasing conversation, or variety of delights for his\r\nsatisfaction. At the same time, the plenty of good dishes, pleasant\r\nwines, fragrant ointments and perfumes, dances, masks, and variety of\r\nrich attire, were all taken up and used to show him how much he was\r\nhonored. There were then acted comedies and tragedies with much cost and\r\nsplendor. When these things had once been entertained, the courtiers\r\nwere never more to be reclaimed from them, and they could not be\r\nsatiated or wearied with them. But when Alencon was once dismissed and\r\ngone, the queen herself left off these diversions, and betook herself as\r\nbefore to the care of her kingdom, and both by example and severe\r\ncorrections endeavoured to reduce her nobility to their old severe way\r\nof life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1582 TO 1587.\r\n\r\nTraits of the queen.--Brown and his sect.--Promotion of\r\nWhitgift.--Severities exercised against the puritans.--Embassy of\r\nWalsingham to Scotland.--Particulars of lord Willoughby.--Transactions\r\nwith the Czar.--Death of Sussex.--Adventures of Egremond Ratcliffe--of\r\nthe earl of Desmond.--Account of Raleigh--of Spenser.--Prosecutions of\r\ncatholics.--Burleigh's apology for the government.--Leicester's\r\nCommonwealth.--Loyal association.--Transactions with the queen of\r\nScots.--Account of Parry.--Case of the earl of Arundel--of the\r\nearl of Northumberland.--Transactions of Leicester in Holland.--Death\r\nand character of P.

This effect was\r\nremarked by one of her clergy, who, in a sermon preached in her\r\npresence, had the boldness to tell her, that she who had been meek as\r\nlamb was become an untameable heifer; for which reproof he was in his\r\nturn reprehended by her majesty on his quitting the pulpit, as \"an over\r\nconfident man who dishonored his sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe decay of her beauty was an unwelcome truth which all the artifices\r\nof adulation were unable to hide from her secret consciousness; since\r\nshe could never behold her image in a mirror, during the latter years of\r\nher life, without transports of impotent anger; and this circumstance\r\ncontributed not a little to sour her temper, while it rendered the young\r\nand lovely the chosen objects of her malignity.\r\n\r\nOn this head the following striking anecdote is furnished by sir John\r\nHarrington.... \"She did oft ask the ladies around her chamber, if they\r\nloved to think of marriage? And the wise ones did conceal well their\r\nliking hereto, as knowing the queen's judgement in this matter. Sir\r\nMatthew Arundel's fair cousin, not knowing so deeply as her fellows, was\r\nasked one day hereof, and simply said, she had thought much about\r\nmarriage, if her father did consent to the man she loved. 'You seem\r\nhonest, i'faith,' said the queen; 'I will sue for you to your\r\nfather.'... The damsel was not displeased hereat; and when sir Robert\r\ncame to court, the queen asked him hereon, and pressed his consenting,\r\nif the match was discreet. Sir Robert, much astonied at this news, said\r\nhe never heard his daughter had liking to any man, and wanted to gain\r\nknowledge of her affection; but would give free consent to what was most\r\npleasing to her highness will and advice. 'Then I will do the rest,'\r\nsaith the queen. The lady was called in, and the queen told her that her\r\nfather had given his free consent. 'Then,' replied the lady, 'I shall be\r\nhappy, and please your grace'. 'So thou shalt, but not to be a fool and\r\nmarry; I have his consent given to me, and I vow thou shalt never get it\r\ninto thy possession. So go to thy business, I see thou art a bold one to\r\nown thy foolishness so readily[93].'\"\r\n\r\n[Note 93: \"Nugae.\"]\r\n\r\nThe perils of many kinds, from open and secret enemies, by which\r\nElizabeth had found herself environed since her unwise and unauthorized\r\ndetention of the queen of Scots, aggravated the mistrustfulness of her\r\nnature; and the severities which fear and anger led her to exercise\r\nagainst that portion of her subjects who still adhered to the ancient\r\nfaith, increased its harshness. It is true that, since the fulmination\r\nof the papal anathema, the zealots of this church had kept no measures\r\nwith respect to her either in their words, their writings, or their\r\nactions. Plans of insurrection and even of assassination were\r\nfrequently revolved in their councils, but as often disappointed by the\r\nextraordinary vigilance and sagacity of her ministers; while the courage\r\nevinced by herself under these circumstances of severe probation was\r\ntruly admirable. Bacon relates that \"the council once represented to her\r\nthe danger in which she stood by the continual conspiracies against her\r\nlife, and acquainted her that a man was lately taken who stood ready in\r\na very dangerous and suspicious manner to do the deed; and they showed\r\nher the weapon wherewith he thought to have acted it. And therefore they\r\nadvised her that she should go less abroad to take the air, weakly\r\nattended, as she used. But the queen answered, 'that she had rather be\r\ndead than put in custody.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ireland,\" says Naunton, \"cost her more vexation than any thing else;\r\nthe expense of it pinched her, the ill success of her officers wearied\r\nher, and in that service she grew hard to please.\" She also arrived at a\r\nsettled persuasion that the extreme of severity was safer than that of\r\nindulgence; an opinion which, being communicated to her officers and\r\nministers, was the occasion, especially in Ireland, of many a cruel and\r\narbitrary act.\r\n\r\nWhen angry, she observed little moderation in the expression of her\r\nfeelings. In the private letters even of Cecil, whom she treated on the\r\nwhole with more consideration than any other person, we find not\r\nunfrequent mention of the harsh words which he had to endure from her,\r\nsometimes, as he says, on occasions when he appeared to himself\r\ndeserving rather of thanks than of censure. The earl of Shrewsbury\r\noften complains to his correspondents of her captious and irascible\r\ntemper; and we find Walsingham taking pains to console sir Henry Sidney\r\nunder some manifestations of her displeasure, by the assurance that they\r\nhad proceeded only from one of those transient gusts of passion for\r\nwhich she was accustomed to make sudden amends to her faithful servants\r\nby new and extraordinary tokens of her favor.\r\n\r\nThere was no branch of prerogative of which Elizabeth was more tenacious\r\nthan that which invested her with the sole and supreme direction of\r\necclesiastical affairs. The persevering efforts therefore of the\r\npuritans, to obtain various relaxations or alterations of the laws which\r\nshe in her wisdom had laid down for the government of the church,--on\r\nfailure of which they scrupled not to recall to her memory the strong\r\ndenunciations of the Jewish prophets against wicked and irreligious\r\nprinces,--at once exasperated and alarmed her, and led her to assume\r\ncontinually more and more of the incongruous and odious character of a\r\nprotestant persecutor of protestants. But the puritans themselves must\r\nhave seemed guiltless in her eyes compared with a new sect, the\r\nprinciples of which, tending directly to the abrogation of all authority\r\nof the civil magistrate in spiritual concerns, called forth about this\r\ntime her indignation manifested by the utmost severity of penal\r\ninfliction.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1580 that Robert Brown, having completed his studies\r\nin divinity at Cambridge, began to preach at Norwich against the\r\ndiscipline and ceremonies of the church of England, and to promulgate a\r\nscheme which he affirmed to be more conformable to the apostolical\r\nmodel. According to his system, each congregation of believers was to be\r\nregarded as a separate church, possessing in itself full jurisdiction\r\nover its own concerns; the _liberty of prophesying_ was to be indulged\r\nto all the brethren equally, and pastors were to be elected and\r\ndismissed at the pleasure of the majority, in whom he held that all\r\npower ought of right to reside. On account of these opinions Brown was\r\ncalled before certain ecclesiastical commissioners, who imprisoned him\r\nfor contumacy; but the interference of his relation lord Burleigh\r\nprocured his release, after which he repaired to Holland, where he\r\nfounded several churches and published a book in defence of his system,\r\nin which he strongly inculcated upon his disciples the duty of\r\nseparating themselves from what he stated antichristian churches. For\r\nthe sole offence of distributing this work, two men were hanged in\r\nSuffolk in 1583; to which extremity of punishment they were subjected as\r\nhaving impugned the queen's supremacy, which was declared felony by a\r\nlate statute now for the first time put in force against protestants.\r\nBrown himself, after his return from Holland, was repeatedly imprisoned,\r\nand, but for the protection of his powerful kinsman might probably have\r\nshared the fate of his two disciples. At length, the terror of a\r\nsentence of excommunication drove him to recant, and joining the\r\nestablished church he soon obtained preferment. But the Brownist sect\r\nsuffered little by the desertion of its founder, whose private\r\ncharacter was far from exemplary: in spite of penal laws, of\r\npersecution, and even of ridicule and contempt, it survived, increased,\r\nand eventually became the model on which the churches not only of the\r\nsect of Independents but also of the two other denominations of English\r\nprotestant dissenters remain at the present day constituted.\r\n\r\nThe death of archbishop Grindal in 1583 afforded the queen the long\r\ndesired opportunity of elevating to the primacy a prelate not inclined\r\nto offend her, like his predecessor, by any remissness in putting in\r\nforce the laws against puritans and other nonconformists. She nominated\r\nto this high dignity Whitgift bishop of Worcester, known to polemics as\r\nthe zealous antagonist of Cartwright the puritan, and further\r\nrecommended to her majesty by his single life, his talents for business,\r\nwhether secular or ecclesiastical, his liberal and hospitable style of\r\nliving, and the numerous train of attendants which swelled the pomp of\r\nhis appearance on occasions of state and ceremony, when he even claimed\r\nto be served on the knee.\r\n\r\nThis promotion forms an important aera in the ecclesiastical history of\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth: but only a few circumstances more peculiarly\r\nillustrative of the sentiments and disposition of Whitgift, of the queen\r\nherself, and of some of her principal counsellors, can with propriety\r\nfind a place in a work like the present.\r\n\r\nTo bring back the clergy to that exact uniformity with respect to\r\ndoctrines, rites, and ceremonies, from which the lenity of his\r\npredecessor had suffered them in many instances to recede, appeared to\r\nthe new primate the first and most essential duty of his office; and\r\nthe better to enforce obedience, he eagerly demanded to be armed with\r\nthat plenitude of power which her majesty as head of the church was\r\nauthorized to delegate at her pleasure. His request was granted with\r\nalacrity, and the work of intolerance began. Subscriptions were now\r\nrequired of the whole clerical body to the supremacy; to the book of\r\nCommon-prayer; and to the articles of religion settled by the\r\nconvocation of 1560. In consequence of this first step alone, so large a\r\nnumber of zealous preachers and able divines attached to the Calvinistic\r\nmodel were suspended from their functions for non-compliance, that the\r\nprivy-council took alarm, and addressed a letter to the archbishop\r\nrequesting a conference; but he loftily reproved their interference in\r\nmatters of this nature, declaring himself amenable in the discharge of\r\nhis functions to his sovereign alone. In the following year he prevailed\r\nupon her majesty to appoint a second high-commission court, the members\r\nof which were authorized, _ex officio_, to administer interrogatories on\r\noath in matters of faith;--an assumption of power not merely cruel and\r\noppressive, but absolutely illegal, if we are to rely on Beal, clerk of\r\nthe council, an able and learned but somewhat intemperate partisan of\r\nthe puritans, who published on this occasion a work against the\r\narchbishop. To enter into controversy was now no part of the plan of\r\nWhitgift; he held it as a maxim, that it was safer and better for an\r\nestablished church to silence than to confute; and a book of Calvinistic\r\ndiscipline having issued from the Cambridge press, he procured a\r\nStar-chamber decree for lessening and limiting the number of presses;\r\nfor restraining any man from exercising the trade of a printer without a\r\nspecial license; and for subjecting all works to the censorship, of the\r\narchbishop or the bishop of London. At the same time he vehemently\r\ndeclared that he would rather lie in prison all his life, or die, than\r\ngrant any indulgence to puritans; and he expressed his wonder, as well\r\nas indignation, that men high in place should countenance the factious\r\nportion of the clergy, low and obscure individuals and not even\r\nconsiderable by their numbers, against him the second person of the\r\nstate. The earl of Leicester was not however to be intimidated from\r\nextending to these conscientious sufferers a protection which was in\r\nmany instances effectual: Walsingham occasionally interceded in behalf\r\nof Calvinistic preachers of eminence; and sir Francis Knolles, whose\r\ninfluence with the queen was considerable, never failed to encounter the\r\nmeasures of the primate with warm, courageous, and persevering\r\nopposition. Even Burleigh, whom Whitgift had regarded as a friend and\r\npatron and hoped to number among his partisans, could not forbear\r\nexpressing to him on various occasions his serious disapprobation of the\r\nrigors now resorted to; nor was he to be silenced by the plea of the\r\narchbishop, that he acted entirely by the command of her majesty. On the\r\ncontrary, as instances multiplied daily before his eyes of the tyranny\r\nand persecution exercised, through the extraordinary powers of the\r\necclesiastical commission, on ministers of unblemished piety and often\r\nof exemplary usefulness, his remonstrances assumed a bolder tone and\r\nmore indignant character: as in the following instance. \"But when the\r\nsaid lord treasurer understood, that two of these ministers, living in\r\nCambridgeshire, whom for the good report of their modesty and\r\npeaceableness he had a little before recommended unto the archbishop's\r\nfavor, were by the archbishop in commission sent to a register in\r\nLondon, to be strictly examined upon those four and twenty articles\r\nbefore mentioned, he was displeased. And reading over the articles\r\nhimself, disliked them as running in a Romish style, and making no\r\ndistinction of persons. Which caused him to write in some earnestness to\r\nthe archbishop, and in his letter he told him, that he found these\r\narticles so curiously penned, so full of branches and circumstances, as\r\nhe thought the inquisitors of Spain used not so many questions to\r\ncomprehend and to trap their preys. And that this juridical and\r\ncanonical sifting of poor ministers was not to edify and reform. And\r\nthat in charity he thought, they ought not to answer to all these nice\r\npoints, except they were very notorious offenders in papistry or heresy:\r\nBegging his grace to bear with that one fault, if it were so, that he\r\nhad willed these ministers not to answer those articles, except their\r\nconsciences might suffer them[94].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 94: \"Life of Whitgift\" by Strype.]\r\n\r\nThe archbishop, in a long and labored answer, expressed his surprise at\r\nhis lordship's \"vehement speeches\" against the administering of\r\ninterrogatories, \"seeing it was the ordinary course in other courts: as\r\nin the star-chamber, in the courts of the marches, and in other places:\"\r\nand he advanced many arguments, or assertions, in defence of his\r\nproceedings, none of which proved satisfactory to the lord treasurer, as\r\nappeared by his reply. In the end, the archbishop found himself obliged\r\nto compromise this dispute by engaging that in future the twenty-four\r\narticles should only be administered to students in divinity previously\r\nto their ordination; and not to ministers already settled in cures,\r\nunless they should have openly declared themselves against the\r\nchurch-government by law established. But this instance of concession\r\nextorted by the urgency of Walsingham appears to have been a solitary\r\none; the high commission, with the archbishop at its head, proceeded\r\nunrelentingly in the work of establishing conformity, and crushing with\r\na strong hand all appeals to the sense of the public on controverted\r\npoints of discipline or doctrine. The queen, vehemently prepossessed\r\nwith the idea that the opposers of episcopacy must ever be ill affected\r\nalso to monarchy, made no scruple of declaring, after some years\r\nexperience of the untameable spirit of the sect, that the puritans were\r\ngreater enemies of hers than the papists; and in the midst of her\r\ngreatest perils from the machinations of the latter sect, she seldom\r\njudged it necessary to conciliate by indulgence the attachment of the\r\nformer. Several Calvinistic ministers, during the course of the reign,\r\nwere subjected even to capital punishment on account of the scruples\r\nwhich they entertained respecting the lawfulness of acknowledging the\r\nqueen's supremacy: on the other hand, the attempts of sir Francis\r\nKnowles to inspire her majesty with jealousy of the designs of the\r\narchbishop, by whom some advances were made towards claiming for the\r\nepiscopal order an authority by divine right, independently of the\r\nappointment of the head of the church, failed entirely of success. No\r\necclesiastic had ever been able to acquire so great an ascendency over\r\nthe mind of Elizabeth as Whitgift; there was a conformity in their\r\nviews, and in some points a sympathy in their characters; which seem to\r\nhave secured to the primate in all his undertakings the sanction and\r\napproval of his sovereign: his favor continued unimpaired to the latest\r\nhour of her life: it was from his lips that she desired to receive the\r\nfinal consolations of religion; and regret for her loss, from the\r\napprehension of unwelcome changes in the ecclesiastical establishment\r\nunder the auspices of her successor, is believed to have contributed to\r\nthe attack which carried off the archbishop within a year after the\r\ndecease of his gracious and lamented mistress.\r\n\r\nElizabeth took an important though secret part in the struggles for\r\npower among the Scottish nobles of opposite factions by which that\r\nkingdom was now agitated during several years. It has been suspected,\r\nbut seems scarcely probable, that she was concerned in the conspiracy of\r\nthe earl of Gowry for seizing the person of the young king; she\r\ncertainly however interposed afterwards to mitigate his just anger\r\nagainst the participators in that dark design. On the whole, she was\r\ngenerally enabled to gain all the influence in the court of Scotland\r\nwhich she found necessary to her ends; for James could always be\r\nintimidated, and his minions most frequently bribed or cajoled. She\r\nregarded it however as an object of some consequence to gain an accurate\r\nknowledge of the character and capacity of her young kinsman, from one\r\non whom she could rely; and for this purpose she prevailed on\r\nWalsingham, notwithstanding his age and infirmities, to undertake an\r\nembassy into Scotland, of which the ostensible objects were so trifling\r\nthat its real purpose became perfectly evident to the more sagacious of\r\nJames's counsellors. Melvil confesses, that it cost him prodigious pains\r\nto equip the king, at short notice, with so much of artificial dignity\r\nand borrowed wisdom as might enable him to pass successfully through the\r\nordeal of Walsingham's examination. But his labor was not thrown away;\r\nfor James, who really possessed considerable quickness of parts and a\r\ncompetent share of book learning, played with such plausibility the part\r\nassigned him, that even this sagacious statesman is believed to have\r\nreturned impressed with a higher opinion of his abilities than any part\r\nof his after conduct was found to warrant.\r\n\r\nHer increasing apprehensions from the hostility of the king of Spain,\r\ncaused Elizabeth to cultivate with added zeal the friendship of the\r\nnorthern powers of Europe, and in 1582 she sent the garter to the king\r\nof Denmark as a pledge of amity; making at the same time a fruitless\r\nendeavour to obtain for English merchant ships some remission of the\r\nduties newly levied by the Danish sovereign on the passage of the Sound.\r\nIt was the prudent practice of her majesty to intrust these embassies of\r\ncompliment to young noblemen lately come into possession of their\r\nestates, who, for her favor and their own honor, were willing to\r\ndischarge them in a splendid manner at their private expense. The Danish\r\nmission was the price which she exacted from Peregrine Bertie, lately\r\ncalled up to the house of peers as lord Willoughby of Eresby in right of\r\nhis mother, for her reluctant and ungracious recognition of his\r\nundeniable title to this dignity. On the occurrence of this first\r\nmention of a high-spirited nobleman, afterwards celebrated for a\r\nbrilliant valor which rendered him the idol of popular fame, the\r\nremarkable circumstances of his birth and parentage must not be omitted.\r\nHis mother, only daughter and heir of the ninth lord Willoughby by a\r\nSpanish lady of high birth who had been maid of honor to queen Catherine\r\nof Arragon, was first the ward and afterwards the third wife of Charles\r\nBrandon duke of Suffolk, by whom she had two sons, formerly mentioned as\r\nvictims to the sweating-sickness.\r\n\r\nFew ladies of that age chose long to continue in the unprotected state\r\nof widowhood; and the duchess had already re-entered the matrimonial\r\nstate with Richard Bertie, a person of obscure birth but liberal\r\neducation, when the accession of Mary exposed her to all the cruelties\r\nand oppressions exercised without remorse by the popish persecutors of\r\nthat reign upon such of their private enemies as they could accuse of\r\nbeing also the enemies of the catholic church. The duchess, during the\r\nformer reign, had drawn upon herself the bitter enmity of Gardiner by\r\nsome imprudent and insulting manifestations of her abhorrence of his\r\ncharacter and contempt for his religion; and she now learned with dismay\r\nthat it was his intention to subject her to a strict interrogatory on\r\nthe subject of her faith.\r\n\r\nExcept apostasy, there was no other resource than the hazardous and\r\npainful one of voluntary banishment, and this she without hesitation\r\nadopted. Bertie first obtained license for quitting the country on some\r\npretended business; and soon after, the duchess, attended only by two or\r\nthree domestics, escaped by night with her infant daughter from her\r\nhouse in Barbican, and taking boat on the Thames arrived at a port in\r\nKent. Here she embarked; and through many perils,--for stress of weather\r\ncompelled her to put back into an English port, and the search was every\r\nwhere very strict,--she reached at length a more hospitable shore, and\r\nrejoined her husband at Santon in the duchy of Cleves. From this town,\r\nhowever, they were soon chased by the imminent apprehension of\r\nmolestation from the bishop of Arras. It was on an October evening that,\r\nfollowed only by two maid-servants, on foot, through rain and mire and\r\ndarkness, Bertie carrying a bundle and the duchess her child, the\r\nforlorn wanderers began their march for Wesel one of the Hanse-towns,\r\nabout four miles distant. On their arrival, their wild and wretched\r\nappearance, with the sword which Bertie carried, gave them in the eyes\r\nof the inhabitants so suspicious an appearance, that no one would\r\nharbour them; and while her husband ran from inn to inn vainly imploring\r\nadmittance, the afflicted duchess was compelled to betake herself to the\r\nshelter of a church porch; and there, in that misery and desolation and\r\nwant of every thing, was delivered of a child, to whom, in memory of the\r\ncircumstance, she gave the name of Peregrine. Bertie meantime,\r\naddressing himself in Latin to two young scholars whom he overheard\r\nspeaking together in that language, obtained a direction to a Walloon\r\nminister, to whom the duchess had formerly shown kindness in England. By\r\nhis means such prompt and affectionate succour was administered as\r\nserved to restore her to health; and here for some time they found rest\r\nfor the sole of their foot. A fresh alarm then obliged them to remove\r\ninto the dominions of the Palsgrave, where they had remained till the\r\nsupplies which they had brought with them in money and jewels were\r\nnearly exhausted; when a friend of the duchess's having interested the\r\nking of Poland in their behalf, they fortunately received an invitation\r\nfrom this sovereign. Arriving in his country, after great hardships and\r\nimminent danger of their lives from the brutality of some soldiers on\r\ntheir way, a large demesne was assigned them by their princely\r\nprotector, on which they lived in great honor and tranquillity till the\r\nhappy accession of Elizabeth recalled them to their native land.\r\n\r\nPeregrine lord Willoughby found many occasions of distinguishing\r\nhimself in the wars of Flanders, where he rose to the rank of\r\nlieutenant-general. He was not less magnanimous than brave; and\r\ndisdaining the servility of a court life, is thought to have enjoyed on\r\nthis account less of the queen's favor than her admiration of military\r\nmerit would otherwise have prompted her to bestow upon him. He died\r\ngovernor of Berwick in 1601; his son was afterwards created earl of\r\nLindsey, and the title of duke of Ancaster is now borne by his\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nThe king of Sweden, conducted to the brink of ruin by an unequal contest\r\nwith the arms of Russia, sent in 1583 a solemn embassy to the queen of\r\nEngland to entreat her to mediate a peace for him. This good work, in\r\nwhich she cheerfully engaged, was speedily brought to a happy issue; and\r\nthe Czar seized the opportunity of the negotiations to press for the\r\nconclusion of that league offensive and defensive with England, which he\r\nhad formerly proposed in vain. The objection that such an alliance was\r\ninconsistent with the laws of nations, since it might engage the queen\r\nto commit hostilities on princes against whom she had never declared\r\nwar, made, as might be expected, little impression on this barbarian;\r\nand Elizabeth had considerable difficulty in escaping from the intimate\r\nembrace of his proffered friendship, to the cool civilities of a\r\ncommercial treaty. Another perplexing circumstance occurred. The Czar\r\nhad set his heart upon an English wife; some say he ventured to address\r\nthe queen herself; but however this might be, she was about to gratify\r\nhis wish by sending him for a bride a lady of royal blood, sister of the\r\nearl of Huntingdon, when the information which she received of the\r\nunlimited privilege of divorce exercised by his Muscovite majesty,\r\ndeterred her from completing her project. She was in consequence obliged\r\nto excuse the failure on the ground of the delicate health of the young\r\nlady, the reluctance of her brother to part with her, and, what must\r\nhave filled the despot with astonishment, her own inability to dispose\r\nof her female subjects in marriage against the consent of their own\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nAbout this time died the earl of Sussex. In him the queen was deprived\r\nof a faithful and honorable counsellor and an affectionate kinsman;\r\nLeicester lost the antagonist whom he most dreaded, and the nobility one\r\nof its principal ornaments. Dying childless, his next brother succeeded\r\nhim, in whom the race ended; for Egremond Ratcliffe, his youngest\r\nbrother, had already completed his disastrous destiny. This unfortunate\r\ngentleman, it will be remembered, was rendered a fugitive and an outlaw\r\nby the part which he had taken, at a very early age, in the Northern\r\nrebellion. For several years he led a forlorn and rambling life,\r\nsometimes in Flanders, sometimes in Spain, deriving his sole support\r\nfrom an ill paid pension and occasional donations of Philip II., and\r\noften enduring extremities of poverty and hardship.\r\n\r\nWearied with so many sufferings in a desperate cause, he then employed\r\nall his endeavours to make his peace at home; and impatient at length of\r\nthe suspense which he endured, he took the step of returning to England\r\nat all hazards and throwing himself on the compassion of lord Burleigh.\r\nThe treasurer, touched with his misery and his expressions of\r\npenitence, interceded with the queen for his pardon; but she, on some\r\nfresh occasion of suspicion, caused him to be advised to steal out of\r\nthe kingdom again; and neglecting this intimation, he was committed to\r\nthe Tower. After some months he was released, possibly under a promise\r\nof attempting some extraordinary piece of service to his country, and\r\nwas sent back to Flanders, where he was soon after apprehended on a\r\ncharge of conspiring against the life of don John of Austria: some say,\r\nand some deny, that he confessed his guilt, and accused the English\r\nministry of a participation in the design: however this might be, he\r\nperished by the hand of public justice, a lamentable victim to the\r\nguilty violence of the popish faction which first beguiled his\r\ninexperience; to the relentless policy of Elizabeth, which forbade the\r\nreturn of offenders perhaps not incorrigible; and to the desperation\r\nwhich gaining dominion over his mind had subverted all its moral\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIreland had been as usual the scene of much danger and disturbance. In\r\n1582 an attempt was made by the king of Spain to incite the catholic\r\ninhabitants to a general rebellion, by throwing on the coast a small\r\nbody of troops seconded by a very considerable sum of money, and\r\nattended by a number of priests prepared to preach up his title to the\r\nsovereignty of the island in virtue of the papal donation. But the\r\nvigorous measures of Arthur lord Grey the deputy, by holding the Irish\r\nin check, rendered this effort abortive. The Spaniards, unable to\r\npenetrate into the country, raised a fort near the place of their\r\nlanding, which they hoped to be able to hold out till the arrival of\r\nreinforcements. They obstinately refused the terms of surrender first\r\noffered them by the deputy; and the fort being afterwards taken by\r\nassault, the whole garrison, with the exception of the officers, was put\r\nto the sword: an act of cruelty which the deputy is said to have\r\ncommanded with tears, in obedience to the decision of a court-martial\r\nfrom which he could not venture to depart; and which Elizabeth publicly\r\nreprobated, perhaps without internally condemning.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Desmond, who on the arrival of the Spanish troops had risen\r\nin arms against the government with all the power he could muster, was\r\nexcepted from the general pardon granted to other Irish insurgents, and\r\nthus remaining by necessity in a state of rebellion, gave for some time\r\nconsiderable disquiet, if not alarm, to the English government. But his\r\nresources of every kind gradually falling off, he was hunted about\r\nthrough bogs and forests, from one fastness or lurking-place to another,\r\nenduring every kind of privation and hardship, and often foiling his\r\npursuers by hair-breadth scapes. It is even related that he and his\r\ncountess on one occasion being roused from their bed in the middle of\r\nthe night, found no other mode of concealment than that of wading up to\r\ntheir necks in the river which bathed the walls of their retreat. At\r\nlength, a small party of soldiers having entered by surprise a solitary\r\ncabin, they there found one old man sitting alone, to whom their brutal\r\nleader gave a blow with his sword, which nearly cut off his arm, and\r\nanother on the side of his head; on which he cried out, \"I am the earl\r\nof Desmond.\" The name was no protection; for perceiving that he bled\r\nfast and was unable to march, the ruthless soldier, bidding him prepare\r\nfor instant death, struck off his head and brought it away as a trophy;\r\nleaving the mangled trunk to the chance of interment by any faithful\r\nfollower of the house of Fitzgerald who might venture from his\r\nhiding-place to explore the fate of his chief. The head was sent to\r\nEngland as a present to the queen, and placed by her command on London\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the beginning of 1583, Ireland enjoyed a short respite\r\nfrom scenes of violence and blood under the vigorous yet humane\r\nadministration of sir John Perrot, the new deputy.\r\n\r\nThe petty warfare of this turbulent province, amid the many and great\r\nevils of various kinds which it brought forth, was productive however of\r\nsome contingent advantage to the queen's affairs, by serving as a school\r\nof military discipline to many an officer of merit whose abilities she\r\nafterwards found occasion to employ in more important enterprises to\r\ncheck the power of Spain. Ireland was, in particular, the scene of\r\nseveral of the early exploits of that brilliant and extraordinary genius\r\nWalter Raleigh; and it was out of his service in this country that an\r\noccasion arose for his appearing before her majesty, which he had the\r\ntalent and dexterity so to improve as to make it the origin of all his\r\nfavor and advancement. Raleigh was the poor younger brother of a\r\ndecayed but ancient family in Devonshire. His education at Oxford was\r\nyet incomplete, when the ardor of his disposition impelled him to join a\r\ngallant band of one hundred volunteers led by his relation Henry\r\nChampernon, in 1569, to the aid of the French protestants. Here he\r\nserved a six-years apprenticeship to the art of war, after which,\r\nreturning to his own country, he gave himself for a while to the more\r\ntranquil pursuits of literature; for \"both Minervas\" claimed him as\r\ntheir own. In 1578 he resumed his arms under general Norris, commander\r\nof the English forces in the Netherlands; the next year, ambitious of a\r\nnew kind of glory, he accompanied that gallant navigator sir Humphrey\r\nGilbert, his half brother, in a voyage to Newfoundland. This expedition\r\nproving unfortunate, he obtained in 1580 a captain's commission in the\r\nIrish service; and recommended by his vigor and capacity, rose to be\r\ngovernor of Cork. He was the officer appointed to carry into effect the\r\nbloody sentence passed upon the Spanish garrison; a cruel service, but\r\none which the military duty of obedience rendered matter of\r\nindispensable obligation. A quarrel with lord Grey put a stop to his\r\npromotion in Ireland; and on his following this nobleman to England,\r\ntheir difference was brought to a hearing before the privy-council, when\r\nthe great talents and uncommon flow of eloquence exhibited by Raleigh in\r\npleading his own cause, by raising the admiration of all present, proved\r\nthe means of introducing him to the presence of the queen. His comely\r\nperson, fine address, and prompt proficiency in the arts of a courtier,\r\ndid all the rest; and he rapidly rose to such a height of royal favor as\r\nto inspire with jealousy even him who had long stood foremost in the\r\ngood graces of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of Raleigh during the early days of his court attendance,\r\nwhen a few handsome suits of clothes formed almost the sum total of his\r\nworldly wealth, that as he was accompanying the queen in one of her\r\ndaily walks,--during which she was fond of giving audience, because she\r\nimagined that the open air produced a favorable effect on her\r\ncomplexion,--she arrived at a miry spot, and stood in perplexity how to\r\npass. With an adroit presence of mind, the courtier pulled off his rich\r\nplush cloak and threw it on the ground to serve her for a footcloth. She\r\naccepted with pleasure an attention which flattered her, and it was\r\nafterwards quaintly said that the spoiling of a cloak had gained him\r\nmany _good suits_.\r\n\r\nIt was in Ireland too that Edmund Spenser, one of our first genuine\r\npoets, whose rich and melodious strains will find delighted audience as\r\nlong as inexhaustible fertility of invention, truth, fluency and\r\nvivacity of description, copious learning, and a pure, amiable and\r\nheart-ennobling morality shall be prized among the students of English\r\nverse, was now tuning his enchanting lyre; and the ear of Raleigh was\r\nthe first to catch its strains. This eminent person was probably of\r\nobscure parentage and slender means, for it was as a sizer, the lowest\r\norder of students, that he was entered at Cambridge; but that his humble\r\nmerit early attracted the notice of men of learning and virtue is\r\napparent from his intimacy with Stubbs, already commemorated, and from\r\nhis friendship with that noted literary character Gabriel Hervey, by\r\nwhom he was introduced to the acquaintance of Philip Sidney. His leaning\r\ntowards puritanical principles, clearly manifested by various passages\r\nin the Shepherd's Calendar, had probably betrayed itself to his\r\nsuperiors at the university, by his choice of associates, or other\r\ncircumstances, previously to the publication of that piece; and possibly\r\nmight have some share in the disappointment of his hopes of a fellowship\r\nwhich occurred in 1576. Quitting college on this occurrence, he retired\r\nfor some time into the north of England; but the friendship of Sidney\r\ndrew him again from his solitude, and it was at Penshurst that he\r\ncomposed much of his Shepherd's Calendar, published in 1579 under the\r\nsignature of Immerito, and dedicated to this generous patron of his\r\nmuse. The earl of Leicester, probably at his nephew's request, sent\r\nSpenser the same year on some commission to France; and in the next he\r\nobtained the post of secretary to lord Grey, and attended him to\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThough the child of fancy and the muse, Spenser now showed that business\r\nwas not \"the contradiction of his fate;\" he drew up an excellent\r\ndiscourse on the state of Ireland, still read and valued, and received\r\nas his reward the Grant of a considerable tract of land out of the\r\nforfeited Desmond estates, and of the castle of Kilcolman, which\r\nhenceforth became his residence, and where he had soon the satisfaction\r\nof receiving a first visit from Raleigh. Both pupils of classical\r\nantiquity, both poets and aspirants after immortal fame, they met in\r\nthis land of ignorance and barbarity as brothers; and so strong was the\r\nimpression made on the mind of Raleigh, that even on becoming a\r\nsuccessful courtier he dismissed not from his memory or his affection\r\nthe tuneful shepherd whom he had left behind tending his flocks \"under\r\nthe foot of Mole, that mountain hoar.\" He spoke of him to the queen with\r\nall the enthusiasm of kindred genius; obtained for him some favors, or\r\npromises of favors; and on a second visit which he made to Ireland,\r\nprobably for the purpose of inspecting the large grants which he had\r\nhimself obtained, he dragged his friend from his obscure retreat,\r\ncarried him over with him to England, and hastened to initiate him in\r\nthose arts of pushing a fortune at court which with himself had\r\nsucceeded so prosperously. But bitterly did the disappointed poet learn\r\nto deprecate the mistaken kindness which had taught him to exchange\r\nleisure and independence, though in a solitude so barbarous and remote,\r\nfor the servility, the intrigues and the treacheries of this\r\nheart-sickening scene. He put upon lasting record his grief and his\r\nrepentance, in a few lines of energetic warning to the inexperienced in\r\nthe ways of courts, and hastened back to earn in obscurity his title to\r\nimmortal fame by the composition of the Faery Queen. This great work\r\nappeared in 1589, with a preface addressed to Raleigh and a considerable\r\napparatus of recommendatory poems; one of which, a sonnet of great\r\nelegance, is marked with initials which assign it to the same\r\npatronizing friend.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the administration against papists accused of\r\ntreasonable designs or practices, began about this time to excite\r\nconsiderable perturbation in the public mind; for though circumstances\r\nwere brought to light which seemed to justify in some degree the worst\r\nsuspicions entertained of this faction, a system of conduct on the part\r\nof the government also became apparent which no true Englishman could\r\nwithout indignation and horror contemplate. The earl of Leicester,\r\nbesides partaking with the other confidential advisers of her majesty in\r\nthe blame attached to the general character of the measures now pursued,\r\nlay under the popular imputation of making these acts of power\r\nsubservient, in many atrocious instances, to his private purposes of\r\nrapacity or vengeance, and a cloud of odium was raised against him which\r\nthe breath of his indulgent sovereign was in vain exerted to disperse.\r\n\r\nThere was in Warwickshire a catholic gentleman named Somerville, a\r\nperson of violent temper and somewhat disordered in mind, who had been\r\nworked up, by the instigations of one Hall his confessor, to such a\r\npitch of fanatical phrensy, that he set out for London with the fixed\r\npurpose of killing the queen; but falling furiously upon some of her\r\nprotestant subjects by the way, he was apprehended, and readily\r\nconfessed the object of his journey. Being closely questioned, perhaps\r\nwith torture, he is said to have dropped something which touched Mr.\r\nArden his father-in-law; and Hall on examination positively declared\r\nthat this gentleman had been made privy to the bloody purpose of\r\nSomerville. On this bare assertion of the priest, unconfirmed, as\r\nappears, by any collateral evidence, Arden was indicted, found guilty,\r\nand underwent the whole sentence of the law. It happened to be publicly\r\nknown that Arden was the personal enemy of Leicester, for he had refused\r\nto wear his livery;--a base kind of homage which was paid him without\r\nscruple, as it seems, by other neighbouring gentlemen;--and he was also\r\nin the habit of reproaching him with the murder of his first wife. The\r\nwife also of Arden was the sister of sir Nicholas Throgmorton, whom\r\nLeicester was vulgarly supposed to have poisoned, and of the chief\r\njustice of Chester lately displaced. When therefore, in addition to\r\nthese circumstances of suspicion, it was further observed that\r\nSomerville, instead of being produced to deny or confirm on the scaffold\r\nthe evidence which he was said to have given against Arden, died\r\nstrangled in prison, by his own hand as was affirmed;--when it was seen\r\nthat Hall, who was confessedly the instigator of the whole, and further\r\nobnoxious to the laws as a catholic priest, was quietly sent out of the\r\nkingdom by Leicester's means, in spite of the opposition of sir\r\nChristopher Hatton;--and finally, when it appeared that the forfeited\r\nlands of Arden went to enrich a creature of the same great man,--this\r\nvictim of law was regarded as a martyr, and it was found impossible to\r\ntie up the tongues of men from crying shame and vengeance on his cruel\r\nand insidious destroyer.\r\n\r\nThe plot thickened when Francis Throgmorton, son of the degraded judge\r\nof Chester, was next singled out. Some intercepted letters to the queen\r\nof Scots formed the first ground of this gentleman's arrest; but being\r\ncarried to the Tower, he was there racked to extort further discoveries,\r\nand lord Paget and Charles Arundel, a courtier, quitted the kingdom in\r\nhaste as soon as they knew him to be in custody. After this many of the\r\nleading catholics fell into suspicion, particularly the earls of\r\nNorthumberland and Arundel, who were ordered to confine themselves to\r\ntheir houses; lord William Howard, brother to the latter nobleman, and\r\nhis uncle lord Henry Howard, were likewise subjected to several long and\r\nrigorous examinations, but were dismissed at length on full proof of\r\ntheir perfect innocence. The confessions of Throgmorton further\r\nimplicated the Spanish ambassador; who replied in so high a tone to the\r\nrepresentations made him on the subject, that her majesty commanded him\r\nto quit the kingdom.\r\n\r\nFrancis Throgmorton was condemned, and suffered as a traitor, and, it is\r\nprobable, not undeservedly: there was reason also to believe that a\r\ndangerous activity was exercised by the queen of Scots and her agents,\r\nand that the letters which she was continually finding means of\r\nconveying not only to the heads of the popish party, but to all whose\r\nconnexions led her to imagine them in any degree favorable to the cause,\r\nhad shaken the allegiance of numbers. On the other hand, the catholics\r\ncomplained, and certainly not without reason, of dark and detestable\r\nmeans employed by the ministry to betray and ensnare them.\r\nCounterfeited letters, it seems, were often addressed to gentlemen of\r\nthis persuasion, purporting to come either from the queen of Scots or\r\nfrom certain English exiles, and soliciting concurrence in some scheme\r\nfor her deliverance, or some design against the government. If the\r\nunwary receivers either answered the letters, or simply forbore to\r\ndeliver them up to the secretary of state, their houses were entered;\r\nsearch was made for these papers by the emissaries of government, who\r\nwere themselves the fabricators of them; the unfortunate owners were\r\ndragged to prison as suspected persons; and interrogated, and perhaps\r\ntortured, till they discovered all that they knew of the secrets of the\r\nparty. Spies were planted upon them, every unguarded word was caught up\r\nand interpreted in the worst sense, and false or frivolous accusations\r\nwere greedily entertained.\r\n\r\nWalsingham, next to Leicester, bore the chief odium of these\r\nproceedings; but to him no corrupt motives or private ends ever appear\r\nto have been imputed in particular cases, though an anxiety to preserve\r\nhis place, and to recommend himself to the queen his mistress by an\r\nextraordinary manifestation of care for her safety and zeal in her\r\nservice, may not unfairly be supposed to have influenced the general\r\ncharacter of his policy.\r\n\r\nThe loud complaints of the catholics had excited so strong and so widely\r\ndiffused a sentiment of compassion for them and indignation against\r\ntheir oppressors, that it was judged expedient to publish an apology for\r\nthe measures of government, written either by lord Burleigh himself or\r\nunder his direction, which bore the title of \"A declaration of the\r\nfavorable dealing of her majesty's commissioners appointed for the\r\nexamination of certain traitors, and of tortures unjustly reported to be\r\ndone upon them for matters of religion.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus begins: \"Good reader, although her majesty's most mild and\r\ngracious government be sufficient to defend itself against those most\r\nslanderous reports of heathenish and unnatural tyranny and cruel\r\ntortures pretended to have been exercised upon certain traitors who\r\nlately suffered for their treason, and others; as well as spread abroad\r\nby rungates, Jesuits, and seminary men in their seditious books, letters\r\nand libels, in foreign countries and princes courts, as also intimated\r\ninto the hearts of some of our own countrymen and her majesty's\r\nsubjects.... I have conferred with a very honest gentleman whom I knew\r\nto have good and sufficient means to deliver the truth.\" &c. And the\r\nfollowing are the heads of this \"honest gentleman's\" testimony. \"It is\r\naffirmed for truth, and is offered upon due examination to be proved,\"\r\n\"that the forms of torture in their severity or rigor of execution have\r\nnot been such as is slanderously represented\"... \"that even the\r\nprincipal offender Campion himself\"... \"before the conference had with\r\nhim by learned men in the Tower, wherein he was charitably used, was\r\nnever so racked but that he was presently able to walk and to write, and\r\ndid presently write and subscribe all his confessions.\" That Briant, a\r\nman said to, have been reduced to such extremities of hunger and thirst\r\nin prison, that he ate the clay out of the walls and drank the droppings\r\nof the roof, was kept in that state by his own fault; for certain\r\ntreasonable writings being found upon him, he was required to give a\r\nspecimen of his handwriting; which refusing, he was told he should have\r\nno food till he wrote for what he wanted, and after fasting nearly two\r\ndays and nights he complied. Also, that both with respect to these two\r\nand others, it might be affirmed, that the warders, whose office it is\r\nto use the rack, \"were ever by those that attended the examinations\r\nspecially charged to use it in as charitable a manner as such a thing\r\nmight be.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, that none of those catholics who have been racked during her\r\nmajesty's reign were, \"upon the rack or in any other torture,\" demanded\r\nof any points of faith and doctrine merely, \"but only with what persons,\r\nat home or abroad, and touching what plots and practises they had\r\ndealt... about attempts against her majesty's estate or person, or to\r\nalter the laws of the realm for matters of religion, by treason or by\r\nforce; and how they were persuaded themselves and did persuade others,\r\ntouching the pope's pretence of authority to depose kings and princes;\r\nand namely for deprivation of her majesty, and to discharge subjects\r\nfrom their allegiance.\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, that none of them have been put to the rack or torture, no not\r\nfor the matters of treason, or partnership of treason, or such like, but\r\nwhere it was first known and evidently probable, by former detections,\r\nconfessions, and otherwise, that the party was guilty, and could\r\ndeliver truth of the things wherewith he was charged; so as it was first\r\nassured that no innocent was at any time tormented, and the rack was\r\nnever used to wring out confessions at adventure upon uncertainties.\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, that none of them hath been racked or tortured unless he had\r\nfirst said expressly, or amounting to as much, that he will not tell the\r\ntruth though the queen did command him.\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, that the proceeding to torture was always so slowly, so\r\nunwillingly, and with so many preparations of persuasions to spare\r\nthemselves, and so many means to let them know that the truth was by\r\nthem to be uttered, both in duty to her majesty, and in wisdom for\r\nthemselves, as whosoever was present at those actions must needs\r\nacknowledge in her majesty's ministers a full purpose to follow the\r\nexample of her own gracious disposition.\"... \"Thus it appeareth, that\r\nalbeit, by the more general laws of nations, torture hath been and is\r\nlawfully judged to be used in lesser cases, and in sharper manner, for\r\ninquisition of truth in crimes not so near extending to public danger as\r\nthese ungracious persons have committed, whose conspiracies, and the\r\nparticularities thereof, it did so much import and behove to have\r\ndisclosed; yet even in that necessary use of such proceeding, enforced\r\nby the offenders notorious obstinacy, is nevertheless to be acknowledged\r\nthe sweet temperature of her majesty's mild and gracious clemency, and\r\ntheir slanderous lewdness to be the more condemned, that have in favor\r\nof heinous malefactors and stubborn traitors spread untrue rumours and\r\nslanders, to make her merciful government disliked, under false pretence\r\nand rumors of sharpness and cruelty to those against whom nothing can be\r\ncruel, and yet upon whom nothing hath been done but gentle and\r\nmerciful.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a document which speaks sufficiently for itself. Torture, in any\r\nshape, was even at this time absolutely contrary to the law of the land;\r\nand happily, there was enough of true English feeling in the country,\r\neven under the rule of a Tudor, to render it expedient for Elizabeth,\r\nsoon after the exposition of these \"favorable dealings\" of her\r\ncommissioners, to issue an order that no species of it should in future\r\nbe applied to state-prisoners on any pretext whatsoever.\r\n\r\nParsons the Jesuit, who had been fortunate enough to make his escape\r\nwhen his associate Campion was apprehended, is believed to have been the\r\npapist who sought to avenge his party on its capital enemy by the\r\ncomposition of that virulent invective called \"Leicester's\r\nCommonwealth:\" a pamphlet which was printed in Flanders in 1584, and of\r\nwhich a vast number of copies were imported into England, where it\r\nobtained, from the color of the leaves and the supposed author, the\r\nfamiliar title of \"Father Parsons' Green-coat.\" In this work all the\r\ncurrent stories against the unpopular favorite were collected and set\r\nforth as well attested facts; and they were related with that\r\ncircumstantiality and minuteness of detail which are too apt to pass\r\nupon the common reader as the certain and authentic characters of truth.\r\nThe success of this book was prodigious; it was read universally and\r\nwith the utmost avidity. All who envied Leicester's power and grandeur;\r\nall who had smarted under his insolence, or felt the gripe of his\r\nrapacity; all who had been scandalized, or wounded in family honor, by\r\nhis unbridled licentiousness; all who still cherished in their hearts\r\nthe image of the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, whom he was believed to\r\nhave entangled in a deadly snare; all who knew him for the foe and\r\nsuspected him for the murderer of the gallant and lamented earl of\r\nEssex;--finally, all, and they were nearly the whole of the nation, who\r\nlooked upon him as a base and treacherous miscreant, shielded by the\r\naffection of his sovereign and wrapped in an impenetrable cloud of\r\nhypocrisy and artifice, who aimed in the dark his envenomed weapons\r\nagainst the bosom of innocence;--exulted in this exposure of his secret\r\ncrimes, and eagerly received and propagated for truth even the grossest\r\nof the exaggerations and falsehoods with which the narrative was\r\nintermixed.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, incensed to the last degree at so furious an attack upon the\r\nman in whom her confidence was irremoveably fixed, caused her council to\r\nwrite letters to all persons in authority for the suppression of these\r\nbooks, and punishment of such as were concerned in their dispersion;\r\nadding at the same time the declaration, that her majesty \"testified in\r\nher conscience before God, that she knew in assured certainty the books\r\nand libels against the earl to be most malicious, false and scandalous,\r\nand such as none but an incarnate devil himself could dream to be true.\"\r\nThe letters further stated, that her majesty regarded this publication\r\nas an attempt to discredit her own government, \"as though she should\r\nhave failed in good judgement and discretion in the choice of so\r\nprincipal a councillor about her, or to be without taste or care of all\r\njustice or conscience, in suffering such heinous and monstrous crimes,\r\nas by the said books and libels be infamously imputed, to pass\r\nunpunished; or finally, at the least, to want either good will, ability\r\nor courage, if she knew these enormities were true, to call any subject\r\nof hers whatsoever to render sharp account of them, according to the\r\nforce of her laws.\" The councillors in their own persons afterwards went\r\non to declare, that they, \"to do his lordship but right, of their\r\nsincere consciences must needs affirm these strange and abominable\r\ncrimes to be raised of a wicked and venomous malice against the said\r\nearl, of whose good service, sincerity of religion, and all other\r\nfaithful dealings towards her majesty and the realm, they had had long\r\nand true experience.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters said too much; it was not credible that either her majesty\r\nor her privy-councillors should each individually know to be false all\r\nthe imputations thrown upon Leicester in the libels written against him;\r\nthere was even good reason to believe that many of them were firmly\r\nbelieved to be well founded by several, and perhaps most, of the\r\nprivy-councillors; at all events nothing like exculpatory evidence was\r\nbrought, or attempted to be brought, on the subject, consequently no\r\neffect was produced on public opinion; the whole was regarded as an\r\n_ex-parte_ proceeding. Philip Sidney, who probably set out with a\r\nsincere disbelief of these shocking accusations brought against any\r\nuncle who had shown for him an affection next to parental, eagerly took\r\nup the pen in his defence. But the only point on which his refutation\r\nappears to have been triumphant, was unfortunately one of no moral\r\nmoment,--the antiquity and nobility of the Dudley family, falsely, as it\r\nseems, impugned by the libeller. Some inconsistencies and contradictions\r\nhe indeed pointed out in other matters; but, on the whole, the answer\r\nwas miserably deficient in every thing but invective, of which there was\r\nfar too much; and either from a gradual perception of the badness of his\r\ncause or the weakness of his performance, or perhaps for other reasons\r\nwith which we are unacquainted, he abandoned his design; and the\r\nfragment never saw the light till the publication of the Sidney Papers\r\nabout sixty years ago. But whatever might be the private judgements of\r\nmen concerning the character and conduct of the earl of Leicester; the\r\nsupport of the queen, and the strength of the party which the long\r\npossession of power, and a remarkable fidelity in the observance of his\r\nengagements towards his own adherents, had enabled him to form,\r\neffectually protected him from experiencing any decline of his political\r\ninfluence. Of this a proof appeared soon after, when in consequence of\r\nfurther disclosures of the dangerous designs of the catholics, a form of\r\nassociation, by which the subscribers bound themselves to pursue, to the\r\nutmost of their power, even to the death, all who should attempt any\r\nthing against the queen in favor of any pretender to the crown, was\r\ndrawn up by this nobleman and obtained the signatures of all orders of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThis was a measure which the queen of Scots perceived to be aimed\r\nexpressly against herself, and of which she sought to divert the ill\r\neffects by all the means still within her power. She desired to be one\r\nof the first to whom the association should be offered for subscription;\r\nand she begged that this act might form the basis of a treaty by which\r\nall differences between herself and Elizabeth might be finally composed,\r\nand her long captivity exchanged at length, if not for absolute freedom,\r\nat least for a state of comparative independence under articles\r\nguarantied by the principal powers of Europe. These articles, far\r\ndifferent from the former claims of Mary, appeared to Walsingham so\r\nadvantageous to his mistress, by the exemption which they seemed to\r\npromise her from future machinations on the part of the queen of Scots,\r\nthat he strenuously urged their acceptance; but it was in vain. Mutual\r\ninjuries, dissimulation on both sides, and causes of jealousy on the\r\npart of Elizabeth from which all her advantages over her captive enemy\r\nhad not served to set her free, now, as ever, opposed the conclusion of\r\nany terms of agreement; and the imprudent and violent conduct of Mary\r\nserved to confirm Elizabeth in her unrelentingness. Even while the terms\r\nwere under discussion, a letter was intercepted addressed by the queen\r\nof Scots to sir Francis Englefield, an English exile and pensioner in\r\nSpain, in which she thus wrote: \"Of the treaty between the queen of\r\nEngland and me, I may neither hope nor look for good issue. Whatsoever\r\nshall become of me, by whatsoever change of my state and condition, let\r\nthe execution of the _Great Plot_ go forward, without any respect of\r\nperil or danger to me. For I will account my life very happily bestowed,\r\nif I may with the same help and relieve so great a number of the\r\noppressed children of the Church.... And further, I pray you, use all\r\npossible diligence and endeavour to pursue and promote, at the pope's\r\nand other kings' hand, such a speedy execution of their former\r\ndesignments, that the same may be effectuated sometime this next\r\nspring.\" &c. It must be confessed, that after such a letter Mary had\r\nlittle right to complain of the failure of these negotiations. The\r\ncountess of Shrewsbury, now at open variance with her husband, had\r\nemployed every art to infuse into the queen suspicions of a too great\r\nintimacy subsisting between the earl and his prisoner; and Elizabeth,\r\neither from a jealousy which the long fidelity of Shrewsbury to his\r\narduous trust was unable to counteract, or, as was believed, at the\r\ninstigation of some who meant further mischief to Mary, ordered about\r\nthis time her removal to the custody of sir Amias Paulet and sir Drugo\r\nDrury.\r\n\r\nThis change filled the mind of the captive queen with terror, which\r\nprepared her to listen with avidity to any schemes, however desperate,\r\nfor her own deliverance and the destruction of her enemy; and proved the\r\nprelude to that tragical castastrophe which was now advancing fast upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA violent quarrel between Mary and the countess of Shrewsbury had\r\nnaturally resulted from the conduct of this furious woman; and Mary,\r\nwhose passions, whether fierce or tender, easily hurried her beyond the\r\nbounds of decency and of prudence, gratified her resentment at once\r\nagainst the countess and the queen by addressing to Elizabeth a letter\r\nwhich could never be forgiven or forgotten. In this piece, much too\r\ngross for insertion in the present work, she professes to comply with\r\nthe request of her royal sister, by acquainting her very exactly with\r\nall the evil of every kind that the countess of Shrewsbury had ever\r\nspoken of her majesty in her hearing. She then proceeds to repeat or\r\ninvent all that the most venomous malice could devise against the\r\ncharacter of Elizabeth: as, that she had conferred her favors on a\r\nnameless person (probably Leicester) to whom she had promised marriage;\r\non the duke of Anjou, on Simier, on Hatton and others; that the latter\r\nwas quite disgusted with her fondness; that she was generous to none but\r\nthese favorites, &c. That her conceit of her beauty was such, that no\r\nflattery could be too gross for her to swallow; and that this folly was\r\nthe theme of ridicule to all her courtiers, who would often pretend that\r\ntheir eyes were unable to sustain the radiance of her countenance,--a\r\ntrait, by the way, which stands on other and better authority than this\r\ninfamous letter. That her temper was so furious that it was dreadful to\r\nattend upon her;--that she had broken the finger of one lady, and\r\nafterwards pretended to the courtiers that it was done by the fall of a\r\nchandelier, and that she had cut another across the hand with a\r\nknife;--stories very probably not entirely unfounded in fact, since we\r\nfind the earl of Huntingdon complaining, in a letter still preserved in\r\nthe British Museum, that the queen, on some quarrel, had pinched his\r\nwife \"very sorely.\" That she interfered in an arbitrary manner with the\r\nmarriage of one of the countess of Shrewsbury's daughters, and wanted to\r\nengross the disposal of all the heiresses in the kingdom;--in which\r\ncharge there was also some truth. This insulting epistle concluded with\r\nassurances of the extreme anxiety of the writer to see a good\r\nunderstanding restored between herself and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the most alarming manifestations of the inveterate hostility\r\nof the persecuted papists against the queen, continued to agitate the\r\nminds of a people who loved and honored her; and who anticipated with\r\nwell founded horror the succession of another Mary, which seemed\r\ninevitable in the event of her death. A book was written by a Romish\r\npriest, exhorting the female attendants of her majesty to emulate the\r\nmerit and glory of Judith by inflicting on her the fate of Holophernes.\r\nDr. Allen, afterwards cardinal, published a work to justify and\r\nrecommend the murder of a heretic prince; and by this piece a gentleman\r\nof the name of Parry was confirmed, it is said, in the black design\r\nwhich he had several times revolved in his mind, but relinquished as\r\noften from misgivings of conscience.\r\n\r\nIn the history of this person there are some circumstances very\r\nremarkable. He was a man of considerable learning, but, being vicious\r\nand needy, had some years before this time committed a robbery, for\r\nwhich he had received the royal pardon. Afterwards he went abroad, and\r\nwas reconciled to the Romish church, though employed at the same time by\r\nthe ministers of Elizabeth to give intelligence respecting the English\r\nexiles, whom he often recommended to pardon or favor, and sometimes\r\napparently with success. Returning home, he gained access to the queen,\r\nwho admitted him to several private interviews; and he afterwards\r\ndeclared, that fearing he might be tempted to put in act the bloody\r\npurpose which perpetually haunted his mind, he always left his dagger at\r\nhome when he went to wait upon her. On these occasions he apprized her\r\nmajesty of the existence of many designs against her life, and\r\nendeavoured, with great earnestness and plainness of speech, to convince\r\nher of the cruelty and impolicy of those laws against the papists which\r\nhad rendered them her deadly foes: but finding his arguments thrown away\r\nupon the queen, he afterwards procured a seat in parliament, where he\r\nwas the sole opponent of a severe act passed against the Jesuits. On\r\naccount of the freedom with which he expressed himself on this occasion,\r\nhe was for a few days imprisoned.\r\n\r\nSoon after a gentleman of the family of Nevil, induced it is said by the\r\nhope of obtaining as his reward the honors and lands of the rebel earl\r\nof Westmorland lately dead, disclosed to the government a plot for\r\nassassinating the queen, in which he affirmed that Parry had engaged his\r\nconcurrence. Parry confessed in prison that he had long deliberated on\r\nthe means of effectually serving his church, and it appeared that he\r\nhad come to the decision that the assassination of the queen's greatest\r\nsubject might be lawful: a letter was also found upon him from cardinal\r\nComo, expressing approbation of some design which he had communicated to\r\nhim. On this evidence he was capitally condemned; but to the last he\r\nstrongly denied that the cardinal's letter, couched in general terms,\r\nreferred to any attempt on the queen's person, or that he had ever\r\nentertained the design charged upon him. Unlike all the other martyrs of\r\npopery at this time, he died,--not avowing and glorying in the crime\r\ncharged upon him,--but earnestly protesting his innocence, his loyalty,\r\nhis warm attachment to her majesty. An account of his life was published\r\nimmediately afterwards by the queen's printer, written in a style of the\r\nutmost virulence, and filled with tales of his monstrous wickedness\r\nwhich have much the air of violent calumnies.\r\n\r\nParry was well known to lord Burleigh, with whom he had corresponded for\r\nseveral years; and the circumstance of his being brought by him to the\r\npresence of the queen, proves that this minister was far from regarding\r\nhim either as the low, the infamous, or the desperate wretch that he is\r\nhere represented. That he had sometimes _imagined_ the death of the\r\nqueen, he seems to have acknowledged; but most probably he had never so\r\nfar conquered the dictates of loyalty and conscience as to have laid any\r\nplan for her destruction, or even to have resolved upon hazarding the\r\nattempt. The case therefore was one in which mercy and even justice seem\r\nto have required the remission of a harsh and hasty sentence; but the\r\npanic terror which had now seized the queen, the ministry, the\r\nparliament, and the nation, would have sufficed to overpower the\r\npleadings of the generous virtues in hearts of nobler mould than those\r\nof Elizabeth, of Leicester, or of Walsingham.\r\n\r\nNevil, the accuser of Parry, far from gaining any reward, was detained\r\nprisoner in the Tower certainly till the year 1588, and whether he even\r\nthen obtained his liberation does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe severe enactments of the new parliament against papists, which\r\nincluded a total prohibition of every exercise of the rites of their\r\nreligion, so affected the mind of Philip Howard earl of Arundel, already\r\nexasperated by the personal hardships to which the suspicions of her\r\nmajesty and the hostility of her ministers had exposed him, that he\r\nformed the resolution of banishing himself for ever from his native\r\nland. Having secretly prepared every thing for his departure, he put his\r\nwhole case upon record in a letter addressed to her majesty, and left\r\nbehind at his house in London. This piece ought, as it appears, to have\r\nexcited in the breast of his sovereign sentiments of regret and\r\ncompunction rather than of indignation. The writer complains, that\r\nwithout any offence given on his part, or even objected against him by\r\nher majesty, he had long since fallen into her disfavor, as by her\r\n\"bitter speeches\" had become publicly known; so that he was generally\r\naccounted, \"nay in a manner pointed at,\" as one whom her majesty least\r\nfavored, and in most disgrace as a person whom she did deeply suspect\r\nand especially mislike.\" That after he had continued for some months\r\nunder this cloud, he had been called sundry times by her command before\r\nthe council, where charges had been brought against him, some of them\r\nridiculously trifling, others incredible, all so untrue, that even his\r\ngreatest enemies could not, after his answers were made, reproach him\r\nwith any disloyal thought;--yet was he in the end ordered to keep his\r\nhouse. That his enemies still continued to pursue him with\r\ninterrogatories, and continued his restraint; and that even after the\r\nlast examination had failed to produce any thing against him, he was\r\nstill kept fifteen weeks longer in the same state, though accused of\r\nnothing. That when, either his enemies being ashamed to pursue these\r\nproceedings further, or her majesty being prevailed upon by his friends\r\nto put an end to them, he had at length recovered his liberty, he had\r\nbeen led to meditate on the fates of his three unfortunate ancestors,\r\nall circumvented by their enemies, and two of them (the earl of Surry\r\nhis grandfather and the duke of Norfolk his father) brought for slight\r\ncauses to an untimely end. And having weighed their cases with what had\r\njust befallen himself, he concluded that it might well be his lot to\r\nsucceed them in fortune as in place. His foes were strong to overthrow,\r\nhe weak to defend himself, since innocence, he had found, was no\r\nprotection; her majesty being \"easily drawn to an ill opinion of\" his\r\n\"ancestry;\" and moreover, he had been \"charged by the council to be of\r\nthe religion which was accounted odious and dangerous to her estate.\"\r\n\"Lastly,\" he adds, \"but principally, I weighed in what miserable\r\ndoubtful case my soul had remained if my life had been taken, as it was\r\nnot unlikely, in my former troubles. For I protest, the greatest burden\r\nthat rested on my conscience at that time was, because I had not lived\r\naccording to the prescript rule of that which I undoubtedly believed.\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe earl had actually embarked at a small port in Sussex, when, his\r\nproject having been betrayed to the government by the mercenary villany\r\nof the master of the vessel and of one of his own servants, orders were\r\nissued for his detention, and he was brought back in custody and\r\ncommitted to the Tower. The letter just quoted was then produced against\r\nhim; it was declared to reflect on the justice of the country; and for\r\nthe double offence of having written it and of attempting to quit the\r\nkingdom without license, he underwent a long imprisonment, and was\r\narbitrarily sentenced to a fine of one thousand pounds, which he proved\r\nhis inability to pay. The barbarous tyranny which held his body in\r\nthraldom, served at the same time to rivet more strongly upon his mind\r\nthe fetters of that stern superstition which had gained dominion over\r\nhim. The more he endured for his religion, the more awful and important\r\ndid it appear in his eyes; while in proportion to the severity and\r\ntediousness of his sufferings from without, the scenery within became\r\ncontinually more cheerless and terrific; and learning to dread in a\r\nfuture world the prolonged operation of that principle of cruelty under\r\nwhich he groaned in this, he sought to avert its everlasting action by\r\npractising upon himself the expiatory rigors of asceticism. The sequel\r\nof his melancholy history we shall have occasion to contemplate\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThomas Percy earl of Northumberland, brother to that earl who had\r\nsuffered death on account of the Northern rebellion,--by his\r\nparticipation in which he had himself also incurred a fine, though\r\nafterwards remitted,--was naturally exposed at this juncture to vehement\r\nsuspicions. After some examinations before the council, cause was found\r\nfor his committal to the Tower; and here, according to the iniquitous\r\npractice of the age, he remained for a considerable time without being\r\nbrought to trial. At length the public was informed that another\r\nprisoner on a like account having been put to the torture to force\r\ndisclosures, had revealed matters against the earl of Northumberland\r\namounting to treason, on which account he had thought fit to anticipate\r\nthe sentence of the law by shooting himself through the heart. That the\r\nearl was really the author of his own death was indeed proved before a\r\ncoroner's jury by abundant and unexceptionable testimony, as well as by\r\nhis deliberate precautions for making his lands descend to his son, and\r\nhis indignant declaration that the queen, on whom he bestowed a most\r\nopprobrious epithet, should never have his estate; though it may still\r\nbear a doubt whether a consciousness of guilt, despair of obtaining\r\njustice, or merely the misery of an indefinite captivity, were the\r\nmotive of the rash act: but the catholics, actuated by the true spirit\r\nof party, added without scruple the death of this nobleman to the \"foul\r\nand midnight murders\" perpetrated within these gloomy walls.\r\n\r\nMeantime the opposition to popery, which had now become the reigning\r\nprinciple of English policy, was to be maintained on other ground, and\r\nwith other weapons than those with which an inquisitorial\r\nhigh-commission, or a fierce system of penal enactments, had armed the\r\nhands of religious intolerance, political jealousy, or private\r\nanimosity; and all the more generous and adventurous spirits prepared\r\nwith alacrity to draw the sword in the noble cause of Belgian\r\nindependence, against the united tyranny and bigotry of the detestable\r\nPhilip II.\r\n\r\nThe death of that patriot hero William prince of Orange by the hand of a\r\nfanatical assassin, had plunged his country in distress and dismay, and\r\nthe States-general had again made an earnest tender of their sovereignty\r\nto Elizabeth. She once more declined it, from the same motives of\r\ncaution and anxiety to avoid the imputation of ambitious encroachment on\r\nthe rights of neighbouring princes, which had formerly determined her.\r\nBut more than ever aware how closely her own safety and welfare were\r\nconnected with the successful resistance of these provinces, she now\r\nconsented to send over an army to their succour, and to grant them\r\nsupplies of money; in consideration of which several cautionary towns\r\nwere put into her hands. Of these, Flushing was one; and Elizabeth\r\ngratified at once the protestant zeal of Philip Sidney and his\r\naspirations after military glory, by appointing him its governor. It was\r\nin November 1585 that he took possession of his charge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the earl of Leicester, whose haughty and grasping spirit led\r\nhim to covet distinction and authority in every line, was eagerly\r\nsoliciting the supreme command of this important armament; and in spite\r\nof the general mediocrity of his talents and his very slight experience\r\nin the art of war, his partial mistress had the weakness to indulge him\r\nin this unreasonable and ill-advised pretension. The title of general of\r\nthe queen's auxiliaries in Holland was conferred upon him, and with it a\r\ncommand over the whole English navy paramount to that of the\r\nlord-high-admiral himself.\r\n\r\nHe landed at Flushing, and was received first by its governor and\r\nafterwards by the States of Holland and Zealand with the highest honors,\r\nand with the most magnificent festivities which it was in their power to\r\nexhibit. A splendid band of youthful nobility followed in his\r\ntrain:--the foremost of them all was his stepson Robert earl of Essex,\r\nnow in his 19th year, who had already made his appearance at court, and\r\nexperienced from her majesty a reception which clearly prognosticated,\r\nto such as were conversant in the ways of the court, the height of favor\r\nto which he was predestined.\r\n\r\nIt was highly characteristic of the jealous haughtiness of Elizabeth's\r\ntemper, that the extraordinary honors lavished by the States upon\r\nLeicester instantly awakened her utmost indignation. She regarded them\r\nas too high for any subject, even for him who enjoyed the first place in\r\nher royal favor, whom she had invested with an amplitude of authority\r\nquite unexampled, and who represented herself in the council of the\r\nStates-general. She expressed her anger in a tone which made both\r\nLeicester and the Belgians tremble; and the explanations and humble\r\nsubmissions of both parties were found scarcely sufficient to appease\r\nher. At the same time, the incapacity and misconduct of Leicester as a\r\ncommander were daily becoming more conspicuous and offensive in the eyes\r\nof the Dutch authorities; and the most serious evils would immediately\r\nhave ensued, but for the prudence, the magnanimity, the conciliating\r\nbehaviour, and the strenuous exertions, by which his admirable nephew\r\nlabored unceasingly to remedy his vices and cover his deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant valor of the English troops, and particularly of the young\r\nnobility and gentry who led them on, was conspicuous in every encounter;\r\nbut the want of a chief able to cope with that accomplished general the\r\nprince of Parma, precluded them from effecting any important object.\r\nPhilip Sidney distinguished himself by a well-conducted surprise of the\r\ntown of Axel, and received in reward among a number of others the honor\r\nof knighthood from the hands of his uncle. Afterwards, having made an\r\nattack with the horse under his command on a reinforcement which the\r\nenemy was attempting to throw into Zutphen, a hot action ensued, in\r\nwhich though the advantage remained with the English, it was dearly\r\npurchased by the blood of their gallant leader, who received a shot\r\nabove the knee, which after sixteen days of acute suffering brought his\r\nvaluable life to its termination.\r\n\r\nThus perished at the early age of thirty-two sir Philip Sidney, the\r\npride and pattern of his time, the theme of song, the favorite of\r\nEnglish story. The beautiful anecdote of his resigning to the dying\r\nsoldier the draught of water with which he was about to quench his\r\nthirst as he rode faint and bleeding from the fatal field, is told to\r\nevery child, and inspires a love and reverence for his name which never\r\nceases to cling about the hearts of his countrymen. He is regarded as\r\nthe most perfect example which English history affords of the _preux\r\nChevalier_; and is named in parallel with the spotless and fearless\r\nBayard the glory of Frenchmen, whom he excelled in all the\r\naccomplishments of peace as much as the other exceeded him in the number\r\nand splendor of his military achievements.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations of grief for his loss, and the honors paid to his\r\nmemory, went far beyond all former example, and appeared to exceed what\r\nbelonged to a private citizen. The court went into mourning for him, and\r\nhis remains received a magnificent funeral in St. Paul's, the United\r\nProvinces having in vain requested permission to inter him at their own\r\nexpense, with the promise that he should have as fair a tomb as any\r\nprince in Christendom. Elizabeth always remembered him with affection\r\nand regret. Cambridge and Oxford published three volumes of \"_Lachrymae_\"\r\non the melancholy event. Spenser in verse, and Camden in prose,\r\ncommemorated and deplored their friend and patron. A crowd of humbler\r\ncontemporaries pressed emulously forward to offer up their mite of\r\npanegyric and lamentation; and it would be endless to enumerate the\r\npoets and other writers of later times, who have celebrated in various\r\nforms the name of Sidney. Foreigners of the highest distinction claimed\r\na share in the general sentiment. Du Plessis Mornay condoled with\r\nWalsingham on the loss of his incomparable son-in-law in terms of the\r\ndeepest sorrow. Count Hohenlo passionately bewailed his friend and\r\nfellow-soldier, to whose representations and intercessions he had\r\nsacrificed his just indignation against the proceedings of Leicester.\r\nEven the hard heart of Philip II. was touched by the untimely fate of\r\nhis godson, though slain in bearing arms against him.\r\n\r\nWe are told that on the next tilt-day after the last wife of the earl of\r\nLeicester had borne him a son, Sidney appeared with a shield on which\r\nwas the word \"_Speravi_\" dashed through. This anecdote,--if indeed the\r\nallusion of the motto be rightly explained, which it is difficult to\r\nbelieve,--would serve to show how publicly he had been regarded, both by\r\nhimself and others, as the heir of his all-powerful uncle. The death of\r\nthis child, on which occasion adulatory verses were produced by the\r\nuniversity of Cambridge, restored Sidney, the year before his death, to\r\nthis brilliant expectancy; and it cannot reasonably be doubted, that the\r\nacademic honors paid to his memory were, like the court-mourning, a\r\nhomage to the power of the living rather than the virtues of the dead.\r\nBut though he should be judged to have owed to his connexion with a\r\nroyal favorite much of his contemporary celebrity, and even in some\r\nmeasure his enduring fame, no candid estimator will suffer himself to\r\nbe hurried, under an idea of correcting the former partiality of\r\nfortune, into the clear injustice of denying to this accomplished\r\ncharacter a just title to the esteem and admiration of posterity. On the\r\ncontrary, it will be considered, that the very circumstances which\r\nrendered him so early conspicuous, would also expose him to the shafts\r\nof malice and envy; and that if his spirit had not been in reality\r\nnoble, and his conduct irreproachable, it would have exceeded all the\r\npower of Leicester to shield the reputation of his nephew against\r\nattacks similar to those from which he had found it impracticable to\r\ndefend his own.\r\n\r\nPhilip Sidney was educated, by the cares of a wise and excellent father,\r\nin the purest and most elevated moral principles and in the best\r\nlearning of the age. A letter of advice addressed to him by this\r\nexemplary parent at the age of twelve, fully exemplifies both the\r\nlaudable solicitude of sir Henry respecting his future character, and\r\nthe soundness of his views and maxims: in the character of his son, as\r\nadvancing to manhood, he saw his hopes exceeded and his prayers\r\nfulfilled. Nothing could be more correct than his conduct, more laudable\r\nthan his pursuits, while on his travels; young as he was, he merited the\r\nfriendship of Hubert Languet. He also gained just and high reputation\r\nfor the manner in which he acquitted himself of an embassy to the\r\nprotestant princes of Germany, though somewhat of the ostentation and\r\nfamily pride of a Dudley was apparent in the port which he thought it\r\nnecessary to assume on the occasion. After his return, he commenced the\r\nlife of a courtier; and that indiscriminate thirst for glory which was\r\nin some measure the foible of his character, led him into an\r\nostentatious profusion, which, by involving his affairs, rendered it\r\nnecessary for him to solicit the pecuniary favors of her majesty, and to\r\nearn them by some acts of adulation unworthy of his spirit: for all\r\nthese, however, he made large amends by his noble letter against the\r\nFrench marriage. He afterwards took up, with a zeal and ability highly\r\nhonorable to his heart and his head, the defence of his father, accused,\r\nbut finally acquitted, of some stretches of power as lord-deputy of\r\nIreland. This business involved him in disputes with the earl of Ormond,\r\nhis father's enemy, who seems to have generously overlooked provocations\r\nwhich might have led to more serious consequences, in consideration of\r\nthe filial feelings of his youthful adversary.\r\n\r\nThese indications of a bold and forward spirit appear however to have\r\nsomewhat injured him in the mind of her majesty; his advancement by no\r\nmeans kept pace either with his wishes or his wants; and a subsequent\r\nquarrel with the earl of Oxford,--in which he refused to make the\r\nconcessions required by the queen, reminding her at the same time that\r\nit had been her father's policy, and ought to be hers, rather to\r\ncountenance the gentry against the arrogance of the great nobles than\r\nthe contrary,--sent him in disgust from court. Retiring to Wilton, the\r\nseat of his brother-in-law the earl of Pembroke, he composed the\r\nArcadia. This work he never revised or completed; it was published\r\nafter his death, probably contrary to his orders; and it is of a kind\r\nlong since obsolete. Under all these disadvantages, however, though\r\nfaulty in plan and as a whole tedious, this romance has been found to\r\nexhibit extensive learning, a poetical cast of imagination, nice\r\ndiscrimination of character, and, what is far more, a fervor of\r\neloquence in the cause of virtue, a heroism of sentiment and purity of\r\nthought, which stamp it for the offspring of a noble mind,--which evince\r\nthat the workman was superior to his work.\r\n\r\nBut the world re-absorbed him; and baffled at court he meditated, in\r\ncorrespondence with one of his favorite mottoes,--\"_Aut viam inveniam\r\naut faciam_,\"--to join one of the almost piratical expeditions of Drake\r\nagainst the Spanish settlements. Perhaps he might then be diverted from\r\nhis design by the strong and kind warning of his true friend Languet,\r\n\"to beware lest the thirst of lucre should creep into a mind which had\r\nhitherto admitted nothing but the love of truth and an anxiety to\r\ndeserve well of all men.\" After the death of this monitor, however, he\r\nengaged in a second scheme of this very questionable nature, and was\r\nonly prevented from embarking by the arrival of the queen's peremptory\r\norders for his return to court and that of Fulke Greville who\r\naccompanied him.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be difficult to defend in point of dignity and\r\nconsistency his conspicuous appearance, as formerly recorded, at the\r\ntriumph held in honor of the French embassy, or his attendance upon the\r\nduke of Anjou on his return to the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe story of his nomination to the throne of Poland deserves little\r\nregard; it is certain that such an elevation was never within his\r\npossibilities of attainment. His reputation on the continent was however\r\nextremely high; Don John of Austria himself esteemed him; the great\r\nprince of Orange corresponded with him as a real friend; and Du Plessis\r\nMornay solicited his good offices on behalf of the French protestants.\r\nNothing but the highest praise is due to his conduct in Holland; to the\r\nvalor of a knight-errant he added the best virtues of a commander and\r\ncounsellor. Leicester himself apprehended that it would be scarcely\r\npossible for him to sustain his high post without the countenance and\r\nassistance of his beloved nephew; and the event showed that he was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nHis death was worthy of the best parts of his life; he showed himself to\r\nthe last devout, courageous, and serene. His wife, the beautiful\r\ndaughter of Walsingham; his brother Robert, to whom he had performed the\r\npart rather of an anxious and indulgent parent than of a brother; and\r\nmany sorrowing friends, surrounded his bed. Their grief was beyond a\r\ndoubt sincere and poignant, as well as that of the many persons of\r\nletters and of worth who gloried in his friendship and flourished by his\r\nbountiful patronage.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though justice claims the admission that the character of\r\nSidney was not entirely free from the faults most incident to his age\r\nand station, and that neither as a writer, a scholar, a soldier, or a\r\nstatesman,--in all which characters during the course of his short life\r\nhe appeared, and appeared with distinction,--is he yet entitled to the\r\nhighest rank; it may however be firmly maintained that, as a _man_, an\r\naccomplished and high-souled man, he had among his contemporary\r\ncountrymen neither equal nor competitor. Such was the verdict in his own\r\ntimes not of flatterers only, or friends, but of England, of Europe;\r\nsuch is the title of merit under which the historian may enroll him,\r\nwith confidence and with complacency, among the illustrious few whose\r\nname and example still serve to kindle in the bosom of youth the\r\nanimating glow of virtuous emulation.\r\n\r\nLeicester never appears in an amiable light except in connexion with his\r\nnephew, for whom his affection was not only sincere but ardent. A few\r\nextracts from a letter written by him to sir Thomas Heneage, captain of\r\nthe queen's guards, giving an account of the action in which Sidney\r\nreceived his mortal wound, will illustrate this remark, while it records\r\nthe gallant exploits of several of his companions in arms.\r\n\r\nAfter relating that sir Philip had gone out with a party to intercept a\r\nconvoy of the enemy's, he adds, \"Many of our horses were hurt and\r\nkilled, among which was my nephew's own. He went and changed to another,\r\nand would needs to the charge again, and once passed those musqueteers,\r\nwhere he received a sore wound upon his thigh, three fingers above his\r\nknee, the bone broken quite in pieces; but for which chance, God did\r\nsend such a day as I think was never many years seen, so few against so\r\nmany.\" The earl then enumerates the other commanders and distinguished\r\npersons engaged in the action. Colonel Norris, the earl of Essex, sir\r\nThomas Perrot; \"and my unfortunate Philip, with sir William Russell, and\r\ndivers gentlemen; and not one hurt but only my nephew. They killed four\r\nof their enemy's chief leaders, and carried the valiant count Hannibal\r\nGonzaga away with them upon a horse; also took captain George Cressier,\r\nthe principal soldier of the camp, and captain of all the Albanese. My\r\nlord Willoughby overthrew him at the first encounter, man and horse. The\r\ngentleman did acknowledge it himself. There is not a properer gentleman\r\nin the world towards than this lord Willoughby is; but I can hardly\r\npraise one more than another, they all did so well; yet every one had\r\nhis horse killed or hurt. And it was thought very strange that sir\r\nWilliam Stanley with three hundred of his men should pass, in spite of\r\nso many musquets, such troops of horse three several times, making them\r\nremove their ground, and to return with no more loss than he did.\r\nAlbeit, I must say it, it was too much loss for me; for this young man,\r\nhe was my greatest comfort, next her majesty, of all the world; and if I\r\ncould buy his life with all I have, to my shirt I would give it. How God\r\nwill dispose of him I know not, but fear I must needs, greatly, the\r\nworst; the blow in so dangerous a place and so great; yet did I never\r\nhear of any man that did abide the dressing and setting of his bones\r\nbetter than he did; and he was carried afterwards in my barge to\r\nArnheim, and I hear this day, he is still of good heart, and comforteth\r\nall about him as much as may be. God of his mercy grant me his life!\r\nwhich I cannot but doubt of greatly. I was abroad that time in the\r\nfield giving some order to supply that business, which did endure almost\r\ntwo hours in continual fight; and meeting Philip coming upon his\r\nhorseback, not a little to my grief. But I would you had stood by to\r\nhear his most loyal speeches to her majesty; his constant mind to the\r\ncause; his loving care over me, and his most resolute determination for\r\ndeath, not one jot appalled for his blow; which is the most grievous I\r\never saw with such a bullet; riding so a long mile and a half upon his\r\nhorse, ere he came to the camp; not ceasing to speak still of her\r\nmajesty, being glad if his hurt and death might any way honor her\r\nmajesty; for hers he was whilst he lived, and God's he was sure to be if\r\nhe died. Prayed all men to think the cause was as well her majesty's as\r\nthe country's; and not to be discouraged; for you have seen such success\r\nas may encourage us all; and this my hurt is the ordinance of God by the\r\nhap of the war. Well, I pray God, if it be his will, save me his life;\r\neven as well for her majesty's service sake, as for mine own\r\ncomfort[95].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 95: \"Sidney Papers.\"]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sidney was spared the anguish of following such a son to the\r\ngrave, having himself quitted the scene a few months before. It was in\r\n1578 that he received orders to resign the government of Ireland, having\r\nbecome obnoxious to the gentlemen of the English pale by his rigor in\r\nlevying certain assessments for the maintenance of troops and the\r\nexpenses of his own household, which they affirmed to be illegally\r\nimposed. There is every reason to believe that their complaint was well\r\nfounded; but Elizabeth, refusing as usual to allow her prerogative to be\r\ntouched, imprisoned several Irish lawyers, who came to England to appeal\r\nagainst the tax; and sir Henry, being able to prove that he had royal\r\nwarrant for what he had done, was finally exonerated by the\r\nprivy-council from all the charges which had been preferred against him,\r\nand retained to the last his office of lord-president of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe sound judgement of sir Henry Sidney taught him, that his near\r\nconnexion with the earl of Leicester had its dangers as well as its\r\nadvantages; and observing the turn for show and expense with which it\r\nserved to inspire the younger members of his family, he would frequently\r\nenjoin them \"to consider more whose sons than whose nephews they were.\"\r\nIn fact, he was not able to lay up fortunes for them;--the offices he\r\nheld were higher in dignity than emolument; his spirit was noble and\r\nmunificent; and the following, among other anecdotes, may serve to show\r\nthat he himself was not averse to a certain degree of parade; at least\r\non particular occasions. The queen, standing once at a window of her\r\npalace at Hampton-court, saw a gentleman approach escorted by two\r\nhundred attendants on horseback; and turning to her courtiers, she asked\r\nwith some surprise, who this might be? But on being informed that it was\r\nsir Henry Sidney, her lord deputy of Ireland and president of Wales, she\r\nanswered, \"And he may well do it, for he has two of the best offices in\r\nmy kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter, addressed to sir Henry as lord-president of\r\nWales, discloses an additional trait of his character, which cannot fail\r\nto recommend him still more to the esteem of a humane and enlightened\r\nage;--his reluctance, namely, to lend his concurrence to the measures of\r\nreligious persecution which the queen and her bishops now urged upon all\r\npersons in authority as their incumbent duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sir Francis Walsingham to sir H. Sidney lord president of Wales_.\r\n\r\n\"My very good lord;\r\n\r\n\"My lords of late calling here to remembrance the commission that was\r\nmore than a year ago given out to your lordship and certain others for\r\nthe reformation of the recusants and obstinate persons in religion,\r\nwithin Wales and the marches thereof, marvelled very much that in all\r\nthis time they have heard of nothing done by you and the rest; and\r\ntruly, my lord, the necessity of this time requiring so greatly to have\r\nthese kind of men diligently and sharply proceeded against, there will\r\nhere a very hard construction be made, I fear me, of you, to retain with\r\nyou the said commission so long, doing no good therein. Of late now I\r\nreceived your lordship's letter touching such persons as you think meet\r\nto have the custody and oversight of Montgomery Castle, by which it\r\nappeareth you have begun, in your present journeys in Wales, to do\r\nsomewhat in causes of religion; but having a special commission for that\r\npurpose, in which are named special and very apt persons to join with\r\nyou in those matters, it will be thought strange to my lords to hear of\r\nyour proceeding in those causes without their assistance; and therefore,\r\nto the end their lordships should conceive no otherwise than well of\r\nyour dealing without them, I have forborne to acquaint them with our\r\nlate letter, wishing your lordship, for the better handling and success\r\nof those matters in religion, you called unto you the bishop of\r\nWorcester, Mr. Philips, and certain others specially named in the\r\ncommission. They will, I am sure, be glad to wait on you in so good a\r\nservice, and your proceeding together with them in these matters will be\r\nbetter allowed of here, &c.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Your lordship had need to walk warily, for your doings are\r\nnarrowly observed, and her majesty is apt to give ear to any that shall\r\nill you. Great hold is taken by your enemies for neglecting the\r\nexecution of this commission.\r\n\r\n\"Oatlands, August 9th 1580[96].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 96: \"Sidney Papers,\" vol. i. p. 276.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeicester, soon after the death of his nephew, placed his army in\r\nwinter-quarters, having effected no one object of importance. The States\r\nremonstrated with him in strong terms on the various and grievous abuses\r\nof his administration; he answered them in the tone of graciousness and\r\nconciliation which it suited his purpose to assume; and publicly\r\nsurrendering up to them the whole apparent authority of the provinces,\r\nwhilst by a secret act of restriction he in fact retained for himself\r\nfull command over all the governors of towns and provinces, he set sail\r\nfor England.\r\n\r\nElizabeth received her favorite with her usual complacency, either\r\nbecause his abject submissions had in reality succeeded in banishing\r\nfrom her mind all resentment of his conduct in Holland, or because she\r\nrequired the support of his long-tried counsels under the awful\r\nresponsibilities of that impending conflict with the whole collected\r\nforce of the Spanish monarchy for which she felt herself summoned to\r\nprepare. The king of Denmark, astonished to behold a princess of\r\nElizabeth's experienced caution involving herself with seeming\r\nindifference in peril so great and so apparent, exclaimed, that she had\r\nnow taken the diadem from her brow to place it on the doubtful cast of\r\nwar; and trembling for the fate of his friend and ally, he dispatched an\r\nambassador in haste to offer her his mediation for the adjustment of all\r\ndifferences arising out of the revolt of the Netherlands. But Elizabeth\r\nfirmly, though with thanks, declined all overtures towards a\r\nreconciliation with a sovereign whom she now recognised as her\r\nimplacable and determined foe.\r\n\r\nShe was far, however, from despising the danger which she braved; and\r\nwith a prudence and diligence equal to her fortitude, she had begun to\r\nassemble and put in action all her means, internal and external, of\r\ndefence and annoyance. She linked herself still more closely, by\r\nbenefits and promises, with the prince of Conde, chief of the Hugonots\r\nnow in arms against the League, or Catholic association, formed in\r\nFrance under the auspices of the king of Spain. With the king of Scots\r\nalso she entered into an intimate alliance; and she had previously\r\nsecured the friendship of all the protestant princes of Germany and the\r\nnorthern powers of Europe. She now openly avowed the enterprises of\r\nDrake, which she had hitherto only encouraged underhand, or on certain\r\npretexts of retaliation; and she sent him with a fleet of twenty-one\r\nships, carrying above eleven thousand soldiers, to make war upon the\r\nSpanish settlements in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nBut if all these measures seemed likely to afford her kingdom sufficient\r\nmeans of protection against the attacks of a foreign enemy, it was\r\ndifficult for her to regard her own person as equally well secured\r\nagainst the dark conspiracies of her catholic subjects, instigated as\r\nthey were by the sanguinary maxims of the Romish see, fostered by the\r\natrocious activity of the emissaries of Philip, and sanctioned by the\r\nauthority of the queen of Scots, to whom homage was rendered by her\r\nparty as rightful sovereign of the British isles.\r\n\r\nDuring the festival of Easter 1586, some English priests of the seminary\r\nat Rheims had encouraged a fanatical soldier named Savage to vow the\r\ndeath of the queen. About the same time Ballard, also a priest of this\r\nseminary, was concerting in France, with Mendoca and the fugitive lord\r\nPaget, the means of procuring an invasion of the country during the\r\nabsence of its best troops in Flanders. Repairing to England, Ballard\r\ncommunicated both these schemes to Anthony Babington, a gentleman who\r\nhad been gained over on a visit to France by the bishop of Glasgow,\r\nMary's ambassador there, and whose vehement attachment to her cause had\r\nrendered him capable of any enterprise, however criminal or desperate,\r\nfor her deliverance. Babington entered into both plots with eagerness;\r\nbut he suggested, that so essential a part of the action as the\r\nassassination of the queen ought not to be intrusted to one adventurer;\r\nand he lost no time in associating five others in the vow of Savage,\r\nhimself undertaking the part of setting free the captive Mary. With her\r\nhe had previously been in correspondence, having frequently taken the\r\ncharge of transmitting to her by secret channels her letters from\r\nFrance; and he immediately imparted to her this new design for her\r\nrestoration to liberty and advancement to the English throne. There is\r\nfull evidence that Mary approved it in all its parts; that in several\r\nsuccessive letters she gave Babington counsels or directions relative to\r\nits execution; and that she promised to the perpetrators of the murder\r\nof Elizabeth every reward which it should hereafter be in her power to\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\nAll this time the vigilant eye of Walsingham was secretly fixed on the\r\nsecure conspirators. He held a thread which vibrated to their every\r\nmotion, and he was patiently awaiting the moment of their complete\r\nentanglement to spring forth and seize his victims.\r\n\r\nTo the queen, and to her only, he communicated the daily intelligence\r\nwhich he received from a spy who had introduced himself into all their\r\nsecrets; and Elizabeth had the firmness to hasten nothing, though a\r\npicture was actually shown her, in which the six assassins had absurdly\r\ncaused themselves to be represented with a motto underneath intimating\r\ntheir common design. These dreadful visages remained however so\r\nperfectly impressed on her memory, that she immediately recognised one\r\nof the conspirators who had approached very near her person as she was\r\none day walking in her garden. She had the intrepidity to fix him with a\r\nlook which daunted him; and afterwards, turning to her captain of the\r\nguards, she remarked that she was well guarded, not having a single\r\narmed man at the time about her.\r\n\r\nAt length Walsingham judged it time to interpose and rescue his\r\nsovereign from her perilous situation. Ballard was first seized, and\r\nsoon after Babington and his associates. All, overcome by terror or\r\nallured by vain hopes, severally and voluntarily confessed their guilt\r\nand accused their accomplices. The nation was justly exasperated against\r\nthe partakers in a plot which comprised foreign invasion, domestic\r\ninsurrection, the assassination of a beloved sovereign, the elevation to\r\nthe throne of her feared and hated rival, and the restoration of popery.\r\nThe traitors suffered, notwithstanding the interest which the extreme\r\nyouth and good moral characters of most or all of them were formed to\r\ninspire, amid the execrations of the protestant spectators. But what was\r\nto be the fate of that \"pretender to the crown,\" on whose behalf and\r\nwith whose privity this foul conspiracy had been entered into, and who\r\nwas by the late statute, passed with a view to this very case, liable to\r\ncondign punishment?\r\n\r\nThis was now the important question which awaited the decision of\r\nElizabeth, and divided the judgements of her most confidential\r\ncounsellors. Some advised that the royal captive should be spared the\r\nignominy of any public proceeding; but that her attendants should be\r\nremoved, and her custody rendered so severe as to preclude all\r\npossibility of her renewing her pestilent intrigues. Leicester, in\r\nconformity with the baseness and atrocity of his character, is related\r\nto have suggested the employment of treachery against the life of a\r\nprisoner whom it appeared equally dangerous to spare or to punish; and\r\nto have sent a divine to convince Walsingham of the lawfulness of taking\r\nher off by poison. But that minister rejected the proposal with\r\nabhorrence, and concurred with the majority of the council in urging the\r\nqueen to bring her without fear or scruple to an open trial. In favor of\r\nthis measure Elizabeth at length decided, and steps were taken\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nBy means of well concerted precautions, Mary had been kept in total\r\nignorance of the apprehension of the conspirators, till their\r\nconfessions had been made and their fates decided:--a gentleman was then\r\nsent to her from the court to announce that all was discovered.\r\n\r\nIt was just as she had mounted her horse to take her usual exercise with\r\nher keepers, that this alarming message was delivered to her; and for\r\nobvious reasons she was compelled to proceed on her excursion, instead\r\nof returning, as she desired, to her chamber. Meantime all her papers\r\nwere seized, sealed up, and conveyed to the queen. Amongst them were\r\nletters from a large proportion of the nobility and other leading\r\ncharacters of the English court, filled with expressions of attachment\r\nto the person of the queen of Scots and sympathy in her misfortunes, not\r\nunmixed, in all probability, with severe reflections on the conduct of\r\nher rival and oppressor. All these Elizabeth perused, and no doubt\r\nstored up in her memory; but her good sense and prudence supplied on\r\nthis occasion the place of magnanimity; and well knowing that the\r\nconscious fears of the writers would be ample security for their future\r\nconduct, she buried in lasting silence and apparent oblivion all the\r\ndiscoveries which had reached her through this channel.\r\n\r\nThe principal domestics of Mary were now apprehended, and committed to\r\ndifferent keepers; and Nau and Curl her two secretaries were sent\r\nprisoners to London. She herself was immediately removed from Tutbury,\r\nand conveyed with a great attendance of the neighbouring gentry, and\r\nwith pauses at several noblemen's houses by the way, to the strong\r\ncastle of Fotheringay in Northamptonshire. This part of the business was\r\nsafely and prudently conducted by sir Amias Paulet; and he received for\r\nhis encouragement and reward the following characteristic letter,\r\nsubscribed by the hand of her majesty, and surely of her own inditing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"To my faithful Amias.\r\n\r\n\"Amias, my most careful servant, God reward thee treble fold in the\r\ndouble for thy most troublesome charge so well discharged! If you knew,\r\nmy Amias, how kindly, besides dutifully, my grateful heart accepteth\r\nyour double labors and faithful actions, your wise orders and safe\r\nconduct performed in so dangerous and crafty a charge, it would ease\r\nyour troubles and rejoice your heart. And (which I charge you to carry\r\nthis most just thought) that I cannot balance in any weight of my\r\njudgement the value I prize you at: And suppose no treasure to\r\ncountervail such a faith: And condemn myself in that fault which I have\r\ncommitted, if I reward not such deserts. Yea, let me lack when I have\r\nmost need, if I acknowledge not such a merit with a reward '_non omnibus\r\ndatum_.'\r\n\r\n\"But let your wicked mistress know, how with hearty sorrow her vile\r\ndeserts compel those orders; and bid her from me ask God forgiveness for\r\nher treacherous dealing toward the saver of her life many years, to the\r\nintolerable peril of her own. And yet, not content with so many\r\nforgivenesses, must fall again so horribly, far passing a woman, much\r\nmore a princess. Instead of excusing thereof, not one can serve, it\r\nbeing so plainly confessed by the authors of my guiltless death.\r\n\r\n\"Let repentance take place; and let not the fiend possess so as her best\r\npart be lost. Which I pray, with hands lifted up to him that may both\r\nsave and spill. With my loving adieu and prayer for thy long life,\r\n\r\n\"Your assured and loving sovereign in heart,\r\n\r\nby good desert induced,\r\n\r\n\"ELIZ. R.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSoon, after the arrival of Mary at Fotheringay, Elizabeth, according to\r\nthe provisions of the late act, issued out a commission to forty\r\nnoblemen and privy-councillors, empowering them to try and pass sentence\r\nupon Mary daughter and heir of king James V. and late queen of Scots;\r\nfor it was thus that she was designated, with a view of intimating to\r\nher that she was no longer to be regarded as possessing the rights of a\r\nsovereign princess. Thirty-six of the commissioners repaired immediately\r\nto Fotheringay, where they arrived on October 9th 1586, and cited Mary\r\nto appear before them. This summons she refused to obey, on the double\r\nground, that as an absolute princess she was free from all human\r\njurisdiction, since kings only could be her peers; and that having been\r\ndetained in England as a prisoner, she had not enjoyed the protection of\r\nthe laws, and consequently ought not in equity to be regarded as\r\namenable to their sentence. Weighty as these objections may appear, the\r\ncommissioners refused to admit them, and declared that they would\r\nproceed to judge her by default. This menace she at first disregarded;\r\nbut soon after, overcome by the artful representations of Hatton on the\r\ninferences which must inevitably be drawn from her refusal to justify\r\nherself for the satisfaction of a princess who had declared that she\r\ndesired nothing so much as the establishment of her innocence, she\r\nchanged her mind and consented to plead. None of her papers were\r\nrestored, no counsel was assigned her; and her request that her two\r\nsecretaries, whose evidence was princicipally relied on by the\r\nprosecutors, might be confronted with her, was denied. But all these\r\nwere hardships customarily inflicted on prisoners accused of high\r\ntreason and it does not appear that, with respect to its forms and\r\nmodes of proceedings, Mary had cause to complain that her trial was\r\nother than a regular and legal one.\r\n\r\nOn her first appearance she renewed her protestation against the\r\ncompetence of the tribunal. Bromley lord-chancellor answered her,\r\nshowing the jurisdiction of the English law over all persons within the\r\ncountry; and the commissioners ordered both the objection and the reply\r\nto be registered, as if to save the point of law; but it does not appear\r\nthat it was ever referred for decision to any other authority.\r\n\r\nIntercepted letters, authenticated by the testimony of her secretaries,\r\nformed the chief evidence against Mary. From these the crown lawyers\r\nshowed, and she did not attempt to deny, that she had suffered her\r\ncorrespondents to address her as queen of England; that she had\r\nendeavoured by means of English fugitives to incite the Spaniards to\r\ninvade the country; and that she had been negotiating at Rome the terms\r\nof a transfer of all her claims, present and future, to the king of\r\nSpain, disinheriting by this unnatural act her own schismatic son. The\r\nfurther charge of having concurred in the late plot for the\r\nassassination of Elizabeth, she strongly denied and attempted to\r\ndisprove; but it stood on equally good evidence with all the rest; and\r\nin spite of some suggestions of which her modern partisans have\r\nendeavoured to give her the benefit, there appears no solid foundation\r\non which an impartial inquirer can rest any doubt of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe deportment of Mary on this trying emergency exhibited somewhat of\r\nthe dignity, but more of the spirit and adroitness, for which she has\r\nbeen famed. She justified her negotiations, or intrigues, with foreign\r\nprinces, on the ground of her inalienable right to employ all the means\r\nwithin her power for the recovery of that liberty of which she had been\r\ncruelly and unjustly deprived. With great effrontery she persisted in\r\ndenying that she had ever entertained with Babington any correspondence\r\nwhatever; and she urged that his pretending to receive, or having in\r\nfact received, letters written in her cipher, was no conclusive proof\r\nagainst her; since it was the same which she used in her French\r\ncorrespondence, and might have fallen into other hands. But finding\r\nherself hard pressed by evidence on this part of the subject, she\r\nafterwards hazarded a rash attempt to fix on Walsingham the imputation\r\nof having suborned witnesses and forged letters for her destruction. The\r\naged minister, greatly moved by this attack upon his character,\r\nimmediately rose and asserted his innocence in a manner so solemn, and\r\nwith such circumstantial corroboration, as compelled her to retract the\r\naccusation with an apology.\r\n\r\nOn some mention of the earl of Arundel and lord William Howard his\r\nbrother, which occurred in the intercepted letters, she sighed, and\r\nexclaimed with a feeling which did her honor, \"Alas, what has not the\r\nnoble house of Howard suffered for my sake!\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, her presence of mind was remarkable; though the quick\r\nsensibilities of her nature could not be withheld from breaking out at\r\ntimes, either in vehement sallies of anger or long fits of weeping, as\r\nthe sense of past and present injuries, or of her forlorn and afflicted\r\nstate and the perils and sufferings which still menaced her, rose by\r\nturns upon her agitated and affrighted mind.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, after a full hearing, of the cause, quitted\r\nFotheringay, and, meeting again in the Star-chamber summoned before them\r\nthe two secretaries, who voluntarily confirmed on oath the whole of\r\ntheir former depositions: after this, they proceeded to an unanimous\r\nsentence of death against Mary, which was immediately transmitted to the\r\nqueen for her approbation. On the same day a declaration was published\r\non the part of the commissioners and judges, importing, that the\r\nsentence did in no manner derogate from the titles and honors of the\r\nking of Scots.\r\n\r\nMost of the subsequent steps taken by Elizabeth in this unhappy business\r\nare marked with the features of that intense selfishness which,\r\nscrupling nothing for the attainment of its own mean objects, seldom\r\nfails by exaggerated efforts and overstrained manoeuvres to expose\r\nitself to detection and merited contempt.\r\n\r\nNever had she enjoyed a higher degree of popularity than at this\r\njuncture: the late discoveries had opened to view a series of popish\r\nmachinations which had fully justified, in the eyes of an alarmed and\r\nirritated people, even those previous measures of severity on the part\r\nof her government which had most contributed to provoke these attempts.\r\n\r\nThe queen was more than ever the heroine of the protestant party; and\r\nthe image of those imminent and hourly perils to which her zeal in the\r\ngood cause had exposed her, inflamed to enthusiasm the sentiment of\r\nloyalty. On occasion of the detection of Babington's plot, the whole\r\npeople gave themselves up to rejoicings. Sixty bonfires, says the\r\nchronicler, were kindled between Ludgate and Charing-Cross, and tables\r\nwere set out in the open streets at which happy neighbours feasted\r\ntogether. The condemnation of the queen of Scots produced similar\r\ndemonstrations. After her sentence had been ratified by both houses of\r\nparliament, it was thought expedient, probably by way of feeling the\r\npulse of the people, that solemn proclamation of it should be made in\r\nLondon by the lord-mayor and city officers, and by the magistrates of\r\nthe county in Westminster. The multitude, untouched by the long\r\nmisfortunes of an unhappy princess born of the blood-royal of England\r\nand heiress to its throne,--insensible too of every thing arbitrary,\r\nunprecedented, or unjust, in the treatment to which she had been\r\nsubjected, received the notification of her doom with expressions of\r\ntriumph and exultation truly shocking. Bonfires were lighted, church\r\nbells were rung, and every street and lane throughout the city resounded\r\nwith psalms of thanksgiving[97].\r\n\r\n[Note 97: Hollinshed's Castrations.]\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, therefore, that no deference for the opinions or\r\nfeelings of her subjects compelled Elizabeth to hesitate or to dissemble\r\nin this matter.\r\n\r\nHad she permitted the execution of the sentence simply, and without\r\ndelay, all orders of men attached to the protestant establishment would\r\nhave approved it as an act fully justified by state-expediency and the\r\nlaw of self-defence; and though misgivings might have arisen in the\r\nminds of some on cooler reflection, when alarm had subsided and the\r\nbitterness of satiated revenge had begun to make itself felt,--these\r\n\"compunctious visitings\" could have led to no consequences capable of\r\nalarming her. It must have been felt as highly inequitable to reproach\r\nthe queen, when all was past and irrevocable, for the consent which she\r\nhad afforded to a deed sanctioned by a law, ratified by the legislature\r\nand applauded by the people, and from which both church and state had\r\nreaped the fruits of security and peace. Foreign princes also would have\r\nrespected the vigor of this proceeding; they would not have been\r\ndispleased to see themselves spared by a decisive act the pain of making\r\ndisregarded representations on such a subject; and a secret\r\nconsciousness that few of their number would have scrupled under all the\r\ncircumstances to take like vengeance on a deadly foe and rival, might\r\nfurther have contributed to reconcile them to the fact. Even as it was,\r\npope Sixtus V. himself could scarcely restrain his expressions of\r\nadmiration at the completion of so strong a measure as the final\r\nexecution of the sentence: his holiness had indeed a strange passion for\r\ncapital punishments, and he is said to have envied the queen of England\r\nthe glorious satisfaction of cutting off a royal head:--a sentiment not\r\nmuch more extraordinary from such a personage, than the ardent desire\r\nwhich he is reported to have expressed, that it were possible for him to\r\nhave a son by this heretic princess; because the offspring of such\r\nparents could not fail, he said, to make himself king of the world.\r\n\r\nBut it was the weakness of Elizabeth to imagine, that an extraordinary\r\nparade of reluctance, and the interposition of some affected delays,\r\nwould change in public opinion the whole character of the deed which she\r\ncontemplated, and preserve to her the reputation of feminine mildness\r\nand sensibility, without the sacrifice of that great revenge on which\r\nshe was secretly bent. The world, however, when it has no interest in\r\ndeceiving itself, is too wise to accept of words instead of deeds, or in\r\nopposition to them; and the sole result of her artifices was to\r\naggravate in the eyes of all mankind the criminality of the act, by\r\ngiving it rather the air of a treacherous and cold-blooded murder, than\r\nof solemn execution done upon a formidable culprit by the sentence of\r\noffended laws. The parliament which Elizabeth had summoned to partake\r\nthe odium of Mary's death, met four days after the judges had pronounced\r\nher doom, and was opened by commission. An unanimous ratification of the\r\nsentence by both houses was immediately carried, and followed by an\r\nearnest address to her majesty for its publication and execution; to\r\nwhich she returned a long and labored answer.\r\n\r\nShe began with the expression of her fervent gratitude to Providence for\r\nthe affections of her people; adding protestations of her love towards\r\nthem, and of her perfect willingness to have suffered her own life still\r\nto remain exposed as a mark to the aim of enemies and traitors, had she\r\nnot perceived how intimately the safety and well-being of the nation\r\nwas connected with her own. With regard to the queen of Scots, she said,\r\nso severe had been the grief which she had sustained from her recent\r\nconduct, that the fear of renewing this sentiment had been the cause,\r\nand the sole cause, of her withholding her personal appearance at the\r\nopening of that assembly, where she knew that the subject must of\r\nnecessity become matter of discussion; and not, as had been suggested,\r\nthe apprehension of any violence to be attempted against her\r\nperson;--yet she might mention, that she had actually seen a bond by\r\nwhich the subscribers bound themselves to procure her death within a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nSo far was she from indulging any ill will against one of the same sex,\r\nthe same rank, the same race as herself,--in fact her nearest\r\nkinswoman,--that after having received full information of certain of\r\nher machinations, she had secretly written with her own hand to the\r\nqueen of Scots, promising that, on a simple confession of her guilt in a\r\nprivate letter to herself, all should be buried in oblivion. She doubted\r\nnot that the ancient laws of the land would have been sufficient to\r\nreach the guilt of her who had been the great artificer of the recent\r\ntreasons; and she had consented to the passing of the late statute, not\r\nfor the purpose of ensnaring her, but rather to give her warning of the\r\ndanger in which she stood. Her lawyers, from their strict attachment to\r\nancient forms, would have brought this princess to trial within the\r\ncounty of Stafford, have compelled her to hold up her hand at the bar,\r\nand have caused twelve jurymen to pass judgement upon her. But to her\r\nit had appeared more suitable to the dignity of the prisoner and the\r\nimportance of the cause to refer the examination to the judges, nobles,\r\nand counsellors of the realm;--happy if even thus she could escape that\r\nready censure to which the conspicuous station of sovereigns on all\r\noccasions exposed them.\r\n\r\nThe statute, by requiring her to pronounce judgement upon her kinswoman,\r\nhad involved her in anxiety and difficulties. Amid all her perils,\r\nhowever, she must remember with gratitude and affection the voluntary\r\nassociation into which her subjects had entered for her defence. It was\r\nnever her practice to decide hastily on any matter; in a case so rare\r\nand important some interval of deliberation must be allowed her; and she\r\nwould pray Heaven to enlighten her mind, and guide it to the decision\r\nmost beneficial to the church, to the state, and to the people.\r\n\r\nTwelve days after the delivery of this speech, her majesty sent a\r\nmessage to both houses, entreating that her parliament would carefully\r\nreconsider the matter, and endeavour to hit upon some device by which\r\nthe life of the queen of Scots might be rendered consistent with her own\r\nsafety and that of the country. Her faithful parliament, however, soon\r\nafter acquainted her, that with their utmost diligence they had found it\r\nimpracticable to form any satisfactory plan of the kind she desired; and\r\nthe speakers of the two houses ended a long representation of the\r\nmischiefs to be expected from any arrangement by which Mary would be\r\nsuffered to continue in life, with a most earnest and humble petition,\r\nthat her majesty would not longer deny to the united wishes and\r\nentreaties of all England, what it would be iniquitous to refuse to the\r\nmeanest individual; the execution of justice.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, after pronouncing a second long harangue designed to display\r\nher own clemency, to upbraid the malice of her libellers, and to refute\r\nthe suspicion, which her conscience no doubt helped her to anticipate,\r\nthat all this irresolution was but feigned, and that the decisions of\r\nthe two houses were influenced by a secret acquaintance with her\r\nwishes,--again dismissed their petitions without any positive answer.\r\nSoon after, however, she permitted herself to authorize the proclamation\r\nof the sentence, and sent lord Buckhurst, and Beal clerk of the council,\r\nto announce it to Mary herself.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time, the kings of France and of Scotland were\r\ninterceding by their ambassadors for the pardon of the illustrious\r\nprisoner. How the representations of Henry III. were received, we do not\r\nfind minutely recorded; but Elizabeth knew that they might be safely\r\ndisregarded: that monarch was himself too much a sufferer by the\r\narrogance and ambition of the house of Guise, to be very strenuous in\r\nhis friendship towards any one so nearly connected with it; and it is\r\neven said that, while a sense of decorum extorted from him in public\r\nsome energetic expressions of the interest taken by him in the fate of a\r\nsister-in-law and queen-dowager of France, a sentiment of regard for\r\nElizabeth, his friend and ally, prompted him to counsel her, through a\r\nsecret agent, to execute the sentence with the least possible delay. Of\r\nthe treatment experienced by the master of Gray, the envoy of James, we\r\ngain some particulars from an original memorial drawn up by himself.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have reached Ware on December 24th, whence he sent to\r\ndesire Keith and Douglas, the resident Scotch ambassadors, to announce\r\nto the queen his approach; and she voluntarily promised that the life of\r\nMary should be spared till his proposals were heard. His reception in\r\nLondon was somewhat ungracious;--no one was sent to welcome or convoy\r\nhim, and it was ten days before he and sir Robert Melvil his coadjutor\r\nwere admitted to an audience. Elizabeth's first address to them was, \"A\r\nthing long looked for should be welcome when it comes; I would now see\r\nyour master's offers.\" Gray desired first to be assured that the cause\r\nfor which those offers were made was \"still extant;\" that is, that the\r\nlife of Mary was still safe, and should be so till their mission had\r\nbeen heard. She answered, \"I think it be extant yet, but I will not\r\npromise for an hour.\" They then brought forward certain proposals, not\r\nhere recited, which she rejected with contempt; and calling in\r\nLeicester, the lord-admiral, and Hatton, \"very despitefully\" repeated\r\nthem in hearing of them all. Gray then propounded his last offer:--that\r\nthe queen of Scots should resign all her claims upon the English\r\nsuccession to her son, by which means the hopes of the papists would, as\r\nhe said, be cut off. The terms in which this overture was made Elizabeth\r\naffected not to understand; Leicester explained their meaning to be,\r\nthat the king of Scots should be put in his mother's place. \"Is it so?\"\r\nthe queen answered; \"then I put myself in a worse case than before:--By\r\nGod's passion, that were to cut my own throat; and for a duchy or an\r\nearldom to yourself, you, or such as you, would cause some of your\r\ndesperate knaves to kill me. No, by God, he shall never be in that\r\nplace!\" Gray answered, \"He craves nothing of your majesty, but only of\r\nhis mother.\" \"That,\" said Leicester, \"were to make him _party_ (rival or\r\nadversary) to the queen my mistress.\" \"He will be far more party,\"\r\nreplied Gray, \"if he be in her place through her death.\" Her majesty\r\nexclaimed, that she should not have a worse in his mother's place, and\r\nadded; \"Tell your king what good I have done for him in holding the\r\ncrown on his head since he was born, and that I _mind_ (intend) to keep\r\nthe league that now stands between us, and if he break it, it shall be a\r\ndouble fault.\" With this speech she would have left them; but they\r\npersisted in arguing the matter further, though in vain. Gray then\r\nrequested that Mary's life might be spared for fifteen days; the queen\r\nrefused: sir Robert Melvil begged for only eight days; she said not for\r\nan hour, and so quitted them.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Scotch ambassadors assumed a tone of menace: but the\r\nperfidious Gray secretly fortified Elizabeth's resolution with the\r\nproverb, \"The dead cannot bite;\" and undertook soon to pacify, in any\r\nevent, the anger of his master, whose minion he at this time was.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Elizabeth silenced with this show of inflexibility all the\r\npleadings or menaces by which others had attempted to divert her from\r\nher fatal aim, than she began, as in the affair of the French marriage,\r\nto feel her own resolution waver. It appears unquestionable that to\r\naffected delays a real hesitation succeeded. When her pride was no\r\nlonger irritated by opposition, she had leisure to survey the meditated\r\ndeed in every light; and as it rose upon her view in all its native\r\ndeformity, anxious fears for her own fame and credit, yet untainted by\r\nany crime, and perhaps genuine scruples of conscience, forcibly assailed\r\nher resolution. But her ministers, deeply sensible that both she and\r\nthey had already gone too far to recede with reputation or with safety,\r\nencountered her growing reluctance with a proportional increase in the\r\nvehemence of their clamors for what they called, and perhaps thought,\r\njustice. All the hazards to which her excess of clemency might be\r\nimagined to expose her, were conjured up in the most alarming forms to\r\nrepel her scruples. A plot for her assassination was disclosed, to which\r\nthe French ambassador was ascertained to have been privy;--rumors were\r\nraised of invasions and insurrections; and it may be suspected that the\r\nqueen, really alarmed in the first instance by the representations of\r\nher council, voluntarily contributed afterwards to keep up these\r\ndelusions for the sake of terrifying the minds of men into an approval\r\nof the deed of blood.\r\n\r\nAt length, on February 1st 1587, her majesty ordered secretary Davison\r\nto bring her the warrant, which had remained ready drawn in his hands\r\nfor some weeks; and having signed it, she told him to get it sealed with\r\nthe great seal, and in his way to call on Walsingham and tell him what\r\nshe had done; \"though,\" she added smiling, \"I fear he will die of grief\r\nwhen he hears of it;\"--this minister being then sick. Davison obeyed her\r\ndirections, and the warrant was sealed. The next day he received a\r\nmessage from her, purporting that he should forbear to carry the warrant\r\nto the lord keeper till further orders. Surprised and perplexed, he\r\nimmediately waited upon her to receive her further directions; when she\r\nchid him for the haste he had used in this matter, and talked in a\r\nfluctuating and undetermined manner respecting it which greatly alarmed\r\nhim. On leaving the queen, he immediately communicated the circumstances\r\nto Burleigh and Hatton; and thinking it safest for himself to rid his\r\nhands of the warrant, he delivered it up to Burleigh, by whom it had\r\nbeen drawn and from whom he had at first received it. A council was now\r\ncalled, consisting of such of the ministers as either the queen herself\r\nor Davison had made acquainted with the signing of the warrant; and it\r\nwas proposed that, without any further communication with her majesty,\r\nit should be sent down for immediate execution to the four earls to whom\r\nit was directed.\r\n\r\nDavison appears to have expressed some fears that he should be made to\r\nbear the blame of this step; but all his fellow-councillors then present\r\njoined to assure him that they would share the responsibility: it was\r\nalso said, that her majesty had desired of several that she might not be\r\ntroubled respecting any of the particulars of the last dismal scene;\r\nconsequently it was impossible that she could complain of their\r\nproceeding without her privity. By these arguments Davison was seduced\r\nto give his concurrence; and Beal, a person noted for the vehemence of\r\nhis attachment to the protestant cause and to the title of the countess\r\nof Hertford, was dispatched with the instrument; in obedience to which\r\nMary underwent the fatal stroke on February 8th.\r\n\r\nThe news of this event was received by Elizabeth with the most\r\nextraordinary demonstrations of astonishment, grief, and anger. Her\r\ncountenance changed, her voice faltered, and she remained for some\r\nmoments fixed and motionless; a violent burst of tears and lamentations\r\nsucceeded, with which she mingled expressions of rage against her whole\r\ncouncil. They had committed, she said, a crime never to be forgiven;\r\nthey had put to death without her knowledge her dear kinswoman and\r\nsister, against whom they well knew that it was her fixed resolution\r\nnever to proceed to this fatal extremity. She put on deep mourning, kept\r\nherself retired among her ladies abandoned to sighs and tears, and drove\r\nfrom her presence with the most furious reproaches such of her ministers\r\nas ventured to approach her. She caused several of the councillors to be\r\nexamined as to the share which they had taken in this transaction.\r\nBurleigh was of the number; and against him she expressed herself with\r\nsuch peculiar bitterness that he gave himself up for lost, and begged\r\npermission to retire with the loss of all his employments. This\r\nresignation was not accepted; and after a considerable interval, during\r\nwhich this great minister deprecated the wrath of his sovereign in\r\nletters of penitence and submission worthy only of an Oriental slave,\r\nshe condescended to be reconciled to a man whose services she felt to be\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nBut the manes of Mary, or the indignation of her son, could not be\r\nappeased, it seems, without a sacrifice; and a fit victim was at hand.\r\nFrom some words dropped by lord Burleigh on his examination, it had\r\nappeared that it was the declaration of Davison respecting the\r\nsentiments of the queen, as expressed to himself, which had finally\r\ndecided the council to send down the warrant; and on this ground\r\nproceedings were instituted against the unfortunate secretary. He was\r\nstripped of his office, sent to the Tower in spite of the warm and\r\nhonest remonstrances of Burleigh, and after several examinations\r\nsubjected to a process in the Star-chamber for a twofold contempt.\r\nFirst, in revealing her majesty's counsels to others of her\r\nministers;--secondly, in giving up to them an instrument which she had\r\ncommitted to him in special trust and secrecy, to be kept in case of any\r\nsudden emergency which might require its use.\r\n\r\nDavison demanded that his own examination, which with that of Burleigh\r\nformed the whole evidence against him, should be read entire, instead of\r\nbeing picked and garbled by the crown lawyers; but this piece of justice\r\nthe queen's counsel refused him, on the ground that they contained\r\nmatter unfit to be divulged. He was found guilty, and sentenced to a\r\nfine of ten thousand marks and imprisonment during the queen's pleasure,\r\nby judges who at the same time expressed a high opinion both of his\r\nabilities and his integrity, and who certainly regarded his offence as\r\nnothing more than an error of judgement or want of due caution.\r\nElizabeth ordered a copy of his sentence to be immediately transmitted\r\nto the king of Scots, as triumphant evidence of that perfect innocence\r\nin the tragical _accident_ of his mother's death, of which she had\r\nalready made solemn protestation. James complied so far with obvious\r\nmotives of policy as to accept her excuses without much inquiry; but\r\nimpartial posterity will not be disposed to dismiss so easily an\r\nimportant and curious investigation which it possesses abundant means of\r\npursuing. The record of Burleigh's examination is still extant, and so\r\nlikewise is Davison's apology; a piece which was composed by himself at\r\nthe time and addressed to Walsingham, who could best judge of its\r\naccuracy; and which after being communicated to Camden, who has inserted\r\nan extract from it in his Annals, has at length been found entire among\r\nthe original papers of sir Amias Paulet. From this authentic source we\r\nderive the following very extraordinary particulars.\r\n\r\nIt was by the lord-admiral that the queen first sent a message to\r\nDavison requiring him to bring the warrant for her signature; after\r\nsubscribing it, she asked him if he were not heartily sorry it were\r\ndone? to which he replied by a moderate and cautious approval of the\r\nact. She bade him tell the chancellor when he carried the warrant to be\r\nsealed, that he must \"use it as secretly as might be.\" She then signed\r\nother papers which he had brought; dispatching them all \"with the best\r\ndisposition and willingness that could be.\" Afterwards she recurred to\r\nthe subject; mentioned that she had delayed the act so long that the\r\nworld might see \"that she had not been violently or maliciously drawn\r\nunto it;\" but that she had all along perceived the necessity of it to\r\nher own security. She then said, that she would have it done as secretly\r\nas might be, and not in the open court or green of the castle, but in\r\nthe hall. Just as Davison was gathering up his papers to depart, \"she\r\nfell into some complaint of sir Amias Paulet and others that might have\r\neased her of this burthen;\" and she desired that he would yet \"deal with\r\nsecretary Walsingham to write jointly to sir Amias and sir Drue Drury to\r\nsound them in this matter; \"aiming still at this, that it might be so\r\ndone as the blame might be removed from herself.\" This nefarious\r\ncommission Davison strangely consented to execute, though he declares\r\nthat he had always before refused to meddle therein \"upon sundry of her\r\nmajesty's motions,\"--as a thing which he utterly disapproved; and though\r\nhe was fully persuaded that the wisdom and integrity of sir Amias would\r\nrender the application fruitless. The queen repeated her injunctions of\r\nsecrecy in the matter, and he departed.\r\n\r\nHe went to Walsingham, told him that the warrant was signed for\r\nexecuting the sentence against the queen of Scots; agreed with him at\r\nthe same time about the letter to be written to sir Amias for her\r\nprivate assassination;--then got the warrant sealed, then dispatched the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the queen sent him word to forbear going to the\r\nchancellor till she had spoken with him again. He went directly to\r\nacquaint her that he had already seen him. She asked, \"what needed such\r\nhaste?\" He pleaded her commands, and the danger of delay. The queen\r\nparticularized some other form in which she thought it would be safer\r\nand better for her to have the thing done. Davison answered, that the\r\njust and honorable way would, he thought, be the safest and the best, if\r\nshe meant to have it done at all. The queen made no reply, but went to\r\ndinner.--It appears from another statement of Davison's case, also drawn\r\nup by himself, that it was on this very day, without waiting either for\r\nPaulet's answer or for more explicit orders from her majesty, that he\r\nhad the incredible rashness to deliver up the warrant to Burleigh, and\r\nto concur in the subsequent proceedings of the council; though aware\r\nthat the members were utterly ignorant of the queen's application to\r\nPaulet.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, her majesty called him to her in the privy chamber,\r\nand told him smiling, that she had been troubled with him in a dream\r\nwhich she had had the night before, that the queen of Scots was put to\r\ndeath; and which so disturbed her, that she thought she could have run\r\nhim through with a sword. He answered at first jestingly, but, on\r\nrecollection, asked her with great earnestness, whether she did not\r\nintend that the matter should go forward? She answered vehemently and\r\nwith an oath, that she did; but again harped upon the old string;--that\r\nthis mode would cast all the blame upon herself, and a better might be\r\ncontrived. The same afternoon she inquired if he had received an answer\r\nfrom sir Amias; which at the time he had not, but he brought it to her\r\nthe next morning. It contained an absolute refusal to be concerned in\r\nany action inconsistent with justice and honor. At this the queen was\r\nmuch offended; she complained of what she called the \"dainty perjury\" of\r\nhim and others, who contrary to their oath of association cast the\r\nburthen upon herself. Soon after, she again blamed \"the niceness of\r\nthese precise fellows;\" but said she would have the thing done without\r\nthem, and mentioned one Wingfield who would undertake it. Davison\r\nremonstrated against this design; and also represented the dangerous\r\ndilemma in which Paulet and Drury would have been placed by complying\r\nwith her wishes; since, if she avowed their act, she took it upon\r\nherself, \"with her infinite dishonor;\" if she disavowed it, they were\r\nruined. It is absolutely inconceivable how a man who understood so well\r\nthe perils which these persons had skilfully avoided, should have\r\nremained so blind to those which menaced himself; yet Davison, by his\r\nown account, still suffered the queen to go on devising new schemes for\r\nthe taking off of Mary, without either acquainting her that the\r\nprivy-council had already sent off Beal with the warrant, or interfering\r\nwith them to procure, if possible, the recall of this messenger of\r\ndeath. Even on his next interview with her, which he believes to have\r\nbeen on Tuesday, the very day before the execution of the sentence, when\r\nher majesty, after speaking of the daily peril in which she lived, swore\r\na great oath, that it was a shame for them all that the thing was not\r\nyet done, and spoke to him to write a letter to Paulet for the dispatch\r\nof the business; he contented himself with observing generally, that\r\nthe warrant was, he thought, sufficient; and though the queen still\r\ninclined to think the letter requisite, he left her without even\r\ndropping a hint that it was scarcely within the limits of possibility\r\nthat it should arrive before the sentence had been put in execution.\r\n\r\nOf this unaccountable imprudence the utmost advantage was taken against\r\nhim by his cruel and crafty mistress; whose chief concern it had all\r\nalong been to discover by what artifice she might throw the greatest\r\npossible portion of the blame from herself upon others. Davison\r\nunderwent a long imprisonment; the fine, though it reduced him to\r\nbeggary, was rigorously exacted; some scanty supplies for the relief of\r\nhis immediate necessities, while in prison, were all that her majesty\r\nwould vouchsafe him; and neither the zealous attestations of Burleigh in\r\nthe beginning to his merit and abilities and the importance of his\r\npublic services, nor the subsequent earnest pleadings of her own beloved\r\nEssex for his restoration, could ever prevail with Elizabeth to lay\r\naside the appearances of perpetual resentment which she thought good to\r\npreserve against him. She would neither reinstate him in office nor ever\r\nmore admit him to her presence; unable perhaps to bear the pain of\r\nbeholding a countenance which carried with it an everlasting reproach to\r\nher conscience.\r\n\r\nFrom the formidable responsibilities of this unprecedented action, the\r\nwary Walsingham had withdrawn himself by favor of an opportune fit of\r\nsickness, which disabled him from taking part in any thing but the\r\napplication to sir Amias Paulet, by which he could incur, as he well\r\nknew, no hazard. A still more crafty politician, Leicester, after\r\nthrowing out in the privy-council hints of her majesty's wishes, which\r\nserved to accelerate the decisive steps there taken, had artfully\r\ncontrived to escape from all further participation in their proceedings.\r\nBoth ministers, in secret letters to Scotland, washed their hands of the\r\nblood of Mary. But Leicester, not content with these defensive measures,\r\nsought to improve the opportunity to the destruction of a rival whom he\r\nhad never ceased to hate and envy. To his insidious arts the temporary\r\ndisgrace of Burleigh is probably to be imputed; and it seems to have\r\nbeen from the apprehension of his malignant misconstructions that the\r\nlord treasurer refused to put on paper the particulars of his defence,\r\nand never ceased to implore admission to plead his cause before his\r\nsovereign in person. His perseverance at length prevailed: the queen saw\r\nhim; heard his justification, and restored him to her wonted grace;\r\nafter which the tacit compromise between the minister and the favorite\r\nwas restored;--that compromise by which, during eight-and-twenty years,\r\neach had vindicated to himself an equality of political power, personal\r\ninfluence, and royal favor, with the secret enemy whom he vainly wished,\r\nor hoped, or plotted, to displace.\r\n\r\nTo relate again those melancholy details of Mary's closing scene, on\r\nwhich the historians of England and of Scotland, as well as the numerous\r\nbiographers of this ill-fated princess, have exhausted all the arts of\r\neloquence, would be equally needless and presumptuous. It is, however,\r\nimportant to remark, that she died rather with the triumphant air of a\r\nmartyr to her religion, the character which she falsely assumed, than\r\nwith the meekness of a victim or the penitence of a culprit. She bade\r\nMelvil tell her son that she had done nothing injurious to his rights or\r\nhonor; though she was actually in treaty to disinherit him, and had also\r\nconsented to a nefarious plot for carrying him off prisoner to Rome; and\r\nshe denied with obstinacy to the last the charge of conspiring the death\r\nof Elizabeth, though by her will, written the day before her death, she\r\nrewarded as faithful servants the two secretaries who had borne this\r\ntestimony against her. A spirit of self-justification so haughty and so\r\nunprincipled, a perseverance in deliberate falsehood so resolute and so\r\nshameless, ought under no circumstances and in no personage, not even in\r\na captive beauty and an injured queen, to be confounded, by any writer\r\nstudious of the moral tendencies of history and capable of sound\r\ndiscrimination, with genuine religion, true fortitude, or the dignity\r\nwhich renders misfortune respectable.\r\n\r\nLet due censure be passed on the infringement of morality committed by\r\nElizabeth, in detaining as a captive that rival kinswoman, and pretender\r\nto her crown, whom the dread of still more formidable dangers had\r\ncompelled to seek refuge in her dominions: let it be admitted, that the\r\nexercise of criminal jurisdiction over a person thus lawlessly detained\r\nin a foreign country was another sacrifice of the just to the\r\nexpedient, which none but a profligate politician will venture to\r\ndefend; and let the efforts of Mary to procure her own liberty, though\r\nwith the destruction of her enemy and at the cost of a civil war to\r\nEngland, be held, if religion will permit, justifiable or venial;--but\r\nlet not our resentment of the wrongs, or compassion for the long\r\nmisfortunes, of this unhappy woman betray us into a blind concurrence in\r\neulogiums lavished, by prejudice or weakness, on a character blemished\r\nby many foibles, stained by some enormous crimes, and never under the\r\nguidance of the genuine principles of moral rectitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n1587 AND 1588.\r\n\r\nSmall political effect of the death of Mary.--Warlike preparations of\r\nSpain destroyed by Drake.--Case of lord Beauchamp.--Death and character\r\nof the duchess of Somerset.--Hatton appointed chancellor.--Leicester\r\nreturns to Holland--is again recalled.--Disgrace of lord\r\nBuckhurst.--Rupture with Spain.--Preparations against the\r\nArmada.--Notices of the earls of Cumberland and Northumberland--T. and\r\nR.

It changed her relations with no foreign\r\npower, it altered very little the state of parties at home, it\r\nrecommended no new adviser to her favor, it occasioned the displacement\r\nof Davison alone.\r\n\r\nShe may appear, it is true, to have obtained by this stroke an immunity\r\nfrom that long series of dark conspiracies by which, during so many\r\nyears, she had been disquieted and endangered. To deliver the queen of\r\nScots was an object for which many men had been willing to risk their\r\nlives; but none were found desperate or chivalrous enough to run the\r\nsame hazard in order to avenge her. But the recent detection of\r\nBabington and his associates, and the rigorous justice executed upon\r\nthem, was likely, even without the death of Mary, to have deterred from\r\nthe speedy repetition of similar practices; and a crisis was now\r\napproaching fitted to suspend the machinations of faction, to check the\r\noperation even of religious bigotry, and to unite all hearts in the\r\nlove, all hands in the protection, of their native soil.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Spain, though he purposely avoided as yet a declaration of\r\nwar, was known to be intently occupied upon the means of taking signal\r\nvengeance on the queen of England for all the acts of hostility on her\r\npart of which he thought himself entitled to complain.\r\n\r\nAlready in the summer of 1587 the ports of Spain and Portugal had begun\r\nto be thronged with vessels of various sorts and every size, destined to\r\ncompose that terrible armada from which nothing less than the complete\r\nsubjugation of England was anticipated;--already had the pope showered\r\ndown his benedictions on the holy enterprise; and, by a bull declaring\r\nthe throne of the schismatic princess forfeited to the first occupant,\r\nmade way for the pretensions of Philip, who claimed it as the true heir\r\nof the house of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth was not of a temper so timid or so supine as to suffer\r\nthese preparations to advance without interruption. She ordered Drake\r\nto sail immediately for the coast of Spain, and put in practice against\r\nher enemy every possible mode of injury and annoyance. To the four great\r\nships which she allotted to him for this service, the English merchants,\r\ninstigated by the hopes of plunder, cheerfully added twenty-six more of\r\ndifferent sizes; and with this force the daring leader steered for the\r\nport of Cadiz, where a richly-laden fleet lay ready to sail for Lisbon,\r\nthe final rendezvous for the whole armada. By the impetuosity of his\r\nattack, he compelled six galleys which defended the mouth of the harbour\r\nto seek shelter under its batteries; and having thus forced an entrance,\r\nhe took, burned and destroyed about a hundred store-ships and two\r\ngalleons of superior size. This done, he returned to Cape St. Vincent;\r\nthen took three castles; and destroying as he proceeded every thing that\r\ncame in his way, even to the fishing-boats and nets, he endeavoured to\r\nprovoke the Spanish admiral to come out and give him battle off the\r\nmouth of the Tagus. But the marquis of Santa Croce deemed it prudent to\r\nsuffer him to pillage the coast without molestation. Having fully\r\neffected this object, he made sail for the Azores, where the capture of\r\na bulky carrack returning from India amply indemnified the merchants for\r\nall the expenses of the expedition, and enriched the admiral and his\r\ncrews. Drake returned to England in a kind of triumph, boasting that he\r\nhad \"singed the whiskers\" of the king of Spain: nor was his vaunt\r\nunfounded; the destruction of the store-ships, and the havoc committed\r\nby him on the magazines of every kind, was a mischief so great, and for\r\nthe present so irreparable, that it crippled the whole design, and\r\ncompelled Philip to defer, for no less than a year, the sailing of his\r\ninvincible armada.\r\n\r\nThe respite thus procured was diligently improved by Elizabeth for the\r\ncompletion of her plans of defence against the hour of trial, which she\r\nstill anticipated.--The interval seems to afford a fit occasion for the\r\nrelation of some incidents of a more private nature, but interesting as\r\nillustrative of the manners and practices of the age.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned, that the secret marriage of the earl of\r\nHertford with lady Catherine Gray, notwithstanding the sentence of\r\nnullity which the queen had caused to be so precipitately pronounced and\r\nthe punishment which she had tyrannically inflicted on the parties, had\r\nat length been duly established by a legal decision in which her majesty\r\nwas compelled to acquiesce. The eldest son of the earl assumed in\r\nconsequence his father's second title of lord Beauchamp, and became\r\nundoubted heir to all the claims of the Suffolk line. About the year\r\n1585, this young nobleman married, unknown to his father, a daughter of\r\nsir Richard Rogers, of Brianston, a gentleman of ancient family, whose\r\nson had already been permitted to intermarry with a daughter of the\r\nhouse of Seymour. It might have been hoped that the earl of Hertford,\r\nfrom his own long and unmerited sufferings on a similar account, would\r\nhave learned such a lesson of indulgence towards the affections of his\r\nchildren, that a match of greater disparity might have received from\r\nhim a ready forgiveness. But he inherited, it seems, too much of the\r\nunfeeling haughtiness of his high-born mother; and in the fury of his\r\nresentment on discovery of this connexion of his son's, he made no\r\nscruple of separating by force the young couple, in direct defiance of\r\nthe sacred tie which bound them to each other. Lord Beauchamp bore in\r\nthe beginning this arbitrary treatment with a dutiful submission, by\r\nwhich he flattered himself that the heart of his father must sooner or\r\nlater be touched; but at length, finding all entreaties vain, and seeing\r\nreason to believe that a settled plan was entertained by the earl of\r\nestranging him for ever from his wife, he broke on a sudden from the\r\nsolitary mansion which had been assigned him as his place of abode, or\r\nof banishment, and was hastening to London to throw himself at the feet\r\nof her majesty and beseech her interposition, when a servant of his\r\nfather's overtook and forcibly detained him.\r\n\r\nWell aware that his nearness to the crown must have rendered peculiarly\r\noffensive to the queen what she would regard as his presumption in\r\nmarrying without her knowledge and consent, he at first suspected her\r\nmajesty as the author of this attack on his liberty; but being soon\r\ninformed of her declaration, \"that he was no prisoner of hers, and the\r\nman had acted without warrant,\" he addressed to lord Burleigh an earnest\r\npetition for redress. In this remarkable piece, after a statement of his\r\ncase, he begs to submit himself by the lord-treasurer's means to the\r\nqueen and council, hoping _that they will grant him the benefit of the\r\nlaws of the realm_; that it would please his lordship to send for him by\r\nhis warrant; and that he might not be injured by his father's men,\r\nthough hardly dealt with by himself. Such were the lengths to which, in\r\nthis age, a parent could venture to proceed against his child, and such\r\nthe measures which it was then necessary to take in order to obtain the\r\nprotection of the laws. It is not stated whether lord Beauchamp was at\r\nthis time a minor; but if so, he probably made application to Burleigh\r\nas master of the wards. Apparently his representations were not without\r\neffect; for he procured in the end both a re-union with his wife and a\r\nreconciliation with his father.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother of this young nobleman, Anne duchess-dowager of\r\nSomerset, died at a great age in 1587. Maternally descended from the\r\nPlantagenets, and elevated by marriage to the highest rank of English\r\nnobility, she perhaps gloried in the character of being the proudest\r\nwoman of her day. It has often been repeated, that her repugnance to\r\nyield precedence to queen Catherine Parr, when remarried to the younger\r\nbrother of her husband, was the first occasion of that division in the\r\nhouse of Seymour by which Northumberland succeeded in working its\r\noverthrow. In the misfortune to which she had thus contributed, the\r\nduchess largely shared. When the Protector was committed to the Tower,\r\nshe also was carried thither amid the insults of the people, to whom her\r\narrogance had rendered her odious; and rigorous examinations and an\r\nimprisonment of considerable duration here awaited her. She saw her\r\nhusband stripped of power and reputation, convicted of felony, and led\r\nby his enemies to an ignominious death; and what to a woman of her\r\ntemper was perhaps a still severer trial, she beheld her son,--that son\r\nfor whose aggrandizement she had without remorse urged her weak husband\r\nto strip of his birthright his own eldest born,--dispossessed in his\r\nturn of title and estates, and reduced by an act of forfeiture to the\r\nhumble level of a private gentleman.\r\n\r\nHer remarriage to an obscure person of the name of Newdigate, may prove,\r\neither that ambition was not the only inordinate affection to which the\r\ndisposition of the duchess was subject, or that she was now reduced to\r\nseek safety in insignificance.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Mary, no favor beyond an unmolested obscurity was to\r\nbe expected by the protestant house of Seymour; but it was one of the\r\nearliest acts of Elizabeth generously to restore to Edward Seymour the\r\nwhole of the Protector's confiscated estates not previously granted to\r\nhis elder half-brother, and with them the title of earl of Hertford, the\r\nhighest which his father had received from Henry VIII., and that with\r\nwhich he ought to have rested content. Still no door was opened for the\r\nreturn of the duchess of Somerset to power or favor; Elizabeth never\r\nceasing to behold in this haughty woman both the deadly enemy of admiral\r\nSeymour,--that Seymour who was the first to touch her youthful heart,\r\nand whose pretensions to her hand had precipitated his ruin,--and that\r\nrigid censor of her early levities, who, dressed in a \"brief authority,\"\r\nhad once dared to assume over her a kind of superiority, which she had\r\ntreated at the time with disdain, and apparently continued to recollect\r\nwith bitterness.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a letter in which the duchess earnestly implores the\r\nintercession of Cecil in behalf of her son, when under confinement on\r\naccount of his marriage, that she was at the time of writing it excluded\r\nfrom the royal presence; and it was nine whole years before all the\r\ninterest she could make, all the solicitations which she compelled\r\nherself to use towards persons whom she could once have commanded at her\r\npleasure, proved effectual in procuring his release. The vast wealth\r\nwhich she had amassed must still, however, have maintained her\r\nascendency over her own family and numerous dependents, though with its\r\nfinal disposal her majesty evinced a strong disposition to intermeddle.\r\nLearning that she had appointed her eldest son sole executor, to the\r\nprejudice of his brother sir Henry Seymour, whom she did not love, the\r\nqueen sent a gentleman to expostulate with her, and urge her strongly to\r\nchange this disposition. The aged duchess, after long refusal, agreed at\r\nlength to comply with the royal wish: but this promise she omitted to\r\nfulfil, and some obstruction was in consequence given to the execution\r\nof her last will. We possess a large inventory of her jewels and\r\nvaluables, among which are enumerated \"two pieces of unicorn's horn,\" an\r\narticle highly valued in that day, from its supposed efficacy as an\r\nantidote, or a test, for poisons. The extreme smallness of her bequests\r\nfor charitable purposes was justly remarked as a strong indication of a\r\nharsh and unfeeling disposition, in an age when similar benefactions\r\nformed almost the sole resource of the sick and needy.\r\n\r\nIn this year lord-chancellor Bromley died: and it should appear that\r\nthere was at the time no other lawyer of eminence who had the good\r\nfortune to stand high in the favor of the queen and her counsellors, for\r\nwe are told that she had it in contemplation to appoint as his successor\r\nthe earl of Rutland; a nobleman in the thirtieth year of his age,\r\ndistinguished indeed among the courtiers for his proficiency in elegant\r\nliterature and his knowledge of the laws of his country, but known to\r\nthe public only in the capacity of a colonel of foot in the bloodless\r\ncampaign of the earl of Sussex against the Northern rebels.\r\n\r\nHow far this young man might have been qualified to do honor to so\r\nextraordinary a choice, remains matter of conjecture; his lordship being\r\ncarried off by a sudden illness within a week of Bromley himself, after\r\nwhich her majesty thought proper to invest with this high office sir\r\nChristopher Hatton her vice-chamberlain.\r\n\r\nThis was a nomination scarcely less mortifying to lawyers than that of\r\nthe earl of Rutland. Hatton's abode at one of the inns of court had been\r\nso short as scarcely to entitle him to a professional character; and\r\nsince his fine dancing had recommended him to the favor of her majesty,\r\nhe had entirely abandoned his legal pursuits for the life and the hopes\r\nof a courtier. It is asserted that his enemies promoted his appointment\r\nwith more zeal than his friends, in the confident expectation of seeing\r\nhim disgrace himself: what may be regarded as more certain is, that he\r\nwas so disquieted by intimations of the queen's repenting of her choice,\r\nthat he tendered to her his resignation before he entered on the duties\r\nof his office; and that in the beginning of his career the serjeants\r\nrefused to plead before him. But he soon found means both to vanquish\r\ntheir repugnance and to establish in the public mind an opinion of his\r\nintegrity and sufficiency, which served to redeem his sovereign from the\r\ncensure or ridicule to which this extraordinary choice seemed likely to\r\nexpose her. He had the wisdom to avail himself, in all cases of peculiar\r\ndifficulty, of the advice of two learned serjeants;--in other matters he\r\nmight reasonably regard his own prudence and good sense as competent\r\nguides. In fact, it was only since the reformation that this great\r\noffice had begun to be filled by common-law lawyers: before this period\r\nit was usally exercised by some ecclesiastic who was also a civilian,\r\nand instances were not rare of the seals having been held in commission\r\nby noblemen during considerable intervals;--facts which, in justice to\r\nHatton and to Elizabeth, ought on this occasion to be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nThe pride of Leicester had been deeply wounded by the circumstances of\r\nthat forced return from Holland which, notwithstanding all his artful\r\nendeavours to color it to the world, was perfectly understood at court\r\nas a disgraceful recall.\r\n\r\nThe queen, in the first emotions of indignation and disappointment\r\ncalled forth by his ill-success, had in public made use of expressions\r\nrespecting his conduct, of which he well knew that the effect could\r\nonly be obviated by some mark of favor equally public; and he spared no\r\nlabor for the accomplishment of this object. By an extraordinary\r\nexertion of that influence over her majesty's affections which enabled\r\nhim to hold her judgement in lasting captivity, he was at length\r\nsuccessful, and the honorable and lucrative place of chief justice in\r\nEyre of all the forests south of Trent was bestowed upon him early in\r\n1587. So far was well; but he disdained to rest satisfied with less than\r\nthe restitution of that supreme command over the Dutch provinces which\r\nhad flattered his vanity with a title never borne by Englishman before;\r\nthat of _Excellence_. His usual arts prevailed in this instance\r\nlikewise. By means of the authority which he had surreptitiously\r\nreserved to himself, he held the governors of towns and forts in Holland\r\nin complete dependence, whilst his solemn ostentation of religion had\r\nsecured the zealous attachment of the protestant clergy; an order which\r\nthen exerted an important influence over public opinion. It had thus\r\nbeen in his power to raise a strong faction in the country, through the\r\ninstrumentality of which he raised such impediments to the measures of\r\nadministration, that the States-general saw themselves at length\r\ncompelled, as the smaller of two evils, to solicit the queen for his\r\nreturn. It was a considerable time before she could be brought to\r\nsanction a step of which her sagest counsellors, secretly hostile to\r\nLeicester, labored to demonstrate the entire inexpediency. The affairs\r\nof Holland suffered at once by the dissensions which the malice of\r\nLeicester had sown, and by the long irresolution of Elizabeth; and she\r\nat length sent over lord Buckhurst to make inquiry into some measures of\r\nthe States which had given her umbrage, and to report upon the whole\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious and upright statesman was soon satisfied where the blame\r\nought to rest, and he suggested a plan for the government of the country\r\nwhich excluded the idea of Leicester's return. But the intrigues of the\r\nfavorite finally prevailed, and he was authorized in June 1587 to resume\r\na station of which he had proved himself equally incapable and unworthy,\r\nhaving previously been further gratified by her majesty with the office\r\nof lord high-steward, and with permission to resign that of master of\r\nthe horse to his stepson the earl of Essex. But fortune disdained to\r\nsmile upon his arms; and his failure in an attempt to raise the siege of\r\nSluys produced such an exasperation of his former quarrel with the\r\nStates, that in the month of November the queen found herself compelled\r\nto supersede him, appointing the brave lord Willoughby captain-general\r\nin his place.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, Leicester found lord Buckhurst preparing\r\nagainst him a charge of malversation in Holland, and he received a\r\nsummons to justify himself before the privy-council; but he better\r\nconsulted his safety by flying for protection to the footstool of the\r\nthrone. The queen, touched by his expressions of humility and sorrow,\r\nand his earnest entreaties \"that she would not receive with disgrace on\r\nhis return, him whom she had sent forth with honor, nor bring down\r\nalive to the grave one whom her former goodness had raised from the\r\ndust,\" consented once again to receive him into wonted favor. Nor was\r\nthis all; for on the day when he was expected to give in his answer\r\nbefore the council, he appeared in his place, and by a triumphant appeal\r\nto her majesty, whose secret orders limited, as he asserted, his public\r\ncommission, baffled at once the hopes of his enemies and the claims of\r\npublic justice. What was still more gross, he was suffered to succeed in\r\nprocuring a censure to be passed upon lord Buckhurst, who continued in\r\ndisgrace for the nine remaining months of Leicester's life, during which\r\na royal command restrained him within his house. Elizabeth must in this\r\ninstance have known her own injustice even while she was committing it;\r\nbut by the loyal and chivalrous nobility, who knelt before the footstool\r\nof the maiden-queen, \"her buffets and rewards were ta'en with equal\r\nthanks;\" and Abbot, the chaplain of lord Buckhurst, has recorded of his\r\npatron, that \"so obsequious was he to this command, that in all the time\r\nhe never would endure, openly or secretly, by day or night, to see\r\neither wife or child.\" He had his reward; for no sooner was the queen\r\nrestored to liberty by the death of her imperious favorite, than she\r\nreleased her kinsman, honored him with the garter, procured, two years\r\nafter, his election to the chancellorship of the university of Oxford,\r\nand finally appointed him Burleigh's successor in the honorable and\r\nlucrative post of lord treasurer.\r\n\r\nDuring the unavoidable delay which the expedition of Drake had brought\r\nto the designs of Philip II., the prince of Parma had by his master's\r\ndirections been endeavouring to amuse the vigilance of Elizabeth with\r\novertures of negotiation. The queen, at the request of the prince, sent\r\nplenipotentiaries to treat with him in Flanders; and though the\r\nHollanders absolutely refused to enter into the treaty, they proceeded\r\nwith apparent earnestness in the task of settling preliminaries. Some\r\nwriters maintain, that there was, from the beginning, as little\r\nsincerity on one side as on the other; to gain time for the preparations\r\nof attack or defence, being the sole object of both parties in these\r\nmanoeuvres. Yet the cautious and pacific character of the policy of\r\nElizabeth, and the secret dread which she ever entertained of a serious\r\ncontest with the power of Spain, seem to render it more probable that\r\nthe wish and hope of an accommodation was at first on her side real; and\r\nthat the fears of the States that their interests might become the\r\nsacrifice, must have been by no means destitute of foundation. Leicester\r\nis said to have had the merit of first opening the eyes of his sovereign\r\nto the fraudulent conduct of the prince of Parma,--who in fact was\r\nfurnished with no powers to treat,--and to have earned for himself by\r\nthis discovery the restoration of her favor.\r\n\r\nIn March 1588 these conferences broke off abruptly. It was impossible\r\nfor either party longer to deceive or to act the being deceived; for all\r\nEurope now rang with the mighty preparations of king Philip for the\r\nconquest of England;--preparations which occupied the whole of his vast\r\nthough disjointed empire, from the Flemish provinces which still owned\r\nhis yoke, to the distant ports of Sicily and Naples.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the English people rose with the emergency. All ranks and\r\norders vied with each other in an eager devotedness to the sacred cause\r\nof national independence; the rich poured forth their treasures with\r\nunsparing hand; the chivalrous and young rushed on-board ships of their\r\nown equipment, a band of generous volunteers; the poor demanded arms to\r\nexterminate every invader who should set foot on English ground; while\r\nthe clergy animated their audience against the Pope and the Spaniard,\r\nand invoked a blessing on the holy warfare of their fellow-citizens.\r\nElizabeth, casting aside all her weaknesses, showed herself worthy to be\r\nthe queen and heroine of such a people. Her prudence, her vigilance, her\r\npresence of mind, which failed not for a moment, inspired unbounded\r\nconfidence, while her cheerful countenance and spirited demeanour\r\nbreathed hope and courage and alacrity into the coldest bosoms. Never\r\ndid a sovereign enter upon a great and awful contest with a more\r\nstrenuous resolution to fulfil all duties, to confront all perils; never\r\ndid a people repay with such ardor of gratitude, such enthusiasm of\r\nattachment, the noblest virtues of a prince.\r\n\r\nThe best troops of the country were at this time absent in Flanders; and\r\nthere was no standing army except the queen's guard and the garrisons\r\nkept in a few forts on the coast or the Scottish border. The royal navy\r\nwas extremely small, and the revenues of the crown totally inadequate\r\nto the effort of raising it to any thing approaching a parity with the\r\nfleets of Spain. The queen possessed not a single ally on the continent\r\ncapable of affording her aid; she doubted the fidelity of the king of\r\nScots to her interests, and a formidable mass of disaffection was\r\nbelieved to subsist among her own subjects of the catholic communion. It\r\nwas on the spontaneous efforts of individuals that the whole safety of\r\nthe country at this momentous crisis was left dependent: if these\r\nfailed, England was lost;--but in such a cause, at such a juncture, they\r\ncould not fail; and the first appeal made by government to the\r\npatriotism of the people was answered with that spirit in which a nation\r\nis invincible. A message was sent by the privy-council to inquire of the\r\ncorporation of London what the city would be willing to undertake for\r\nthe public service? The corporation requested to be informed what the\r\ncouncil might judge requisite in such a case. Fifteen ships and five\r\nthousand men, was the answer. Two days after, the city \"humbly intreated\r\nthe council, in sign of their perfect love and loyalty, to prince and\r\ncountry, to accept ten thousand men and thirty ships amply furnished.\"\r\n\"And,\" adds the chronicler, \"even as London, London like, gave\r\nprecedent, the whole kingdom kept true rank and equipage.\" At this time,\r\nthe able-bodied men in the capital between the ages of eighteen and\r\nsixty amounted to no more than 17,083.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into further detail respecting the particular\r\ncontributions of different towns or districts to the common defence, it\r\nis sufficient to remark, that every sinew was strained, and that little\r\nwas left to the charge of government but the task of arranging and\r\napplying the abundant succours furnished by the zeal of the country. One\r\ntrait of the times, however, it is essential to commemorate. Terror is\r\nperhaps the most merciless of all sentiments, and that which is least\r\nrestrained either by shame or a sense of justice; and under this\r\ndebasing influence some of the queen's advisers did not hesitate to\r\nsuggest, that in a crisis so desperate, she ought to consult her own\r\nsafety and that of the country, by seeking pretexts to take away the\r\nlives of some of the leading catholics. They cited in support of this\r\natrocious proposal the example of Henry VIII. her father, who, before\r\nhis departure for the French wars, had without scruple brought to the\r\nblock his own cousin the marquis of Exeter and several others, whose\r\nchief crime was their attachment to the ancient faith and their enjoying\r\na degree of popularity which might enable them to raise commotions in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nElizabeth rejected with horror these suggestions of cowardice and\r\ncruelty, at the same time that she omitted no measures of precaution\r\nwhich she regarded as justifiable. The existing laws against priests and\r\nseminary-men were enforced with vigilance and severity, all popish\r\nrecusants were placed under close inspection, and a considerable number\r\nof those accounted most formidable were placed under safe custody in\r\nWisbeach-castle.\r\n\r\nTo these gentlemen, however, the queen caused it to be intimated, that\r\nthe step which she had taken was principally designed for their\r\nprotection, since it was greatly to be apprehended that, in the event of\r\nlanding of the Spaniards, the Roman catholics might become the victims\r\nof some ebullition of popular fury which it would not then be in the\r\npower of government to repress.\r\n\r\nThis lenient proceeding on the part of her majesty was productive of the\r\nbest effects; the catholics who remained at liberty became earnest to\r\nprove themselves possessed of that spirit of patriotism and loyalty for\r\nwhich she had given them credit. Some entered the ranks as volunteers;\r\nothers armed and encouraged their tenantry and dependants for the\r\ndefence of their country; several even fitted out vessels at their own\r\nexpense, and intrusted the command of them to protestant officers on\r\nwhom the government could entirely rely.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the Armada, the prisoners at Wisbeach-castle, having\r\nsigned the submission required by law of such as had offended in hearing\r\nmass and absenting themselves from church, petitioned the privy-council\r\nfor their liberty; but a bond for good behaviour being further demanded\r\nof them, with the condition of being obedient to such orders as six\r\nmembers of the privy-council should write down respecting them, they\r\nrefused to comply with such terms of enlargement, and remained in\r\ncustody. As the submission which they had tendered voluntarily was in\r\nterms apparently no less strong than the bond which they refused, it was\r\nconjectured that the former piece had been drawn up by their ghostly\r\nfathers with some private equivocation or mental reservation; a\r\nsuspicion which receives strong confirmation from the characters and\r\nsubsequent conduct of some of these persons,--the most noted fanatics\r\ncertainly of their party,--and amongst whom we read the names of Talbot,\r\nCatesby, and Tresham, afterwards principal conspirators in the\r\ndetestable gunpowder plot[98].\r\n\r\n[Note 98: Life of Whitgift, by Strype.]\r\n\r\nThe ships equipped by the nobility and gentry to combat the armada\r\namounted in the whole to forty-three, and it was on-board these vessels\r\nthat young men of the noblest blood and highest hopes now made their\r\nfirst essay in arms. In this number may be distinguished George Clifford\r\nthird earl of Cumberland, one of the most remarkable, if not the\r\ngreatest, characters of the reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious race of Clifford takes origin from William duke of\r\nNormandy; in a later age its blood was mingled with that of the\r\nPlantagenets by the intermarriage of the seventh lord de Clifford and a\r\ndaughter of the celebrated Hotspur by Elizabeth his wife, whose father\r\nwas Edward Mortimer earl of March. Notwithstanding this alliance with\r\nthe house of York, two successive lords de Clifford were slain in the\r\ncivil wars fighting strenuously on the Lancastrian side. It was to the\r\nyounger of these, whose sanguinary spirit gained him the surname of the\r\nButcher, that the barbarous murder of the young earl of Rutland was\r\npopularly imputed; and a well-founded dread of the vengeance of the\r\nYorkists caused his widow to conceal his son and heir under the lowly\r\ndisguise of a shepherd-boy, in which condition he grew up among the\r\nfells of Westmorland totally illiterate, and probably unsuspicious of\r\nhis origin.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five-and-twenty years, the restoration of the line of\r\nLancaster in the person of Henry VII. restored to lord de Clifford the\r\nname, rank, and large possessions of his ancestors; but the\r\npeasant-noble preferred through life that rustic obscurity in which his\r\ncharacter had been formed and his habits fixed, to the splendors of a\r\ncourt or the turmoils of ambition. He kept aloof from the capital; and\r\nit was only on the field of Flodden, to which he led in person his hardy\r\ntenantry, that this de Clifford exhibited some sparks of the warlike\r\nfire inherent in his race.\r\n\r\nHis successor, by qualities very different from the homely virtues which\r\nhad obtained for his father among his tenantry and neighbours the\r\nsurname of the Good, recommended himself to the special favor of Henry\r\nVIII., who created him earl of Cumberland, and matched his heir to his\r\nown niece lady Eleanor Brandon. The sole fruit of this illustrious\r\nalliance, which involved the earl in an almost ruinous course of\r\nexpense, was a daughter, who afterwards became the mother of Ferdinando\r\nearl of Derby, a nobleman whose mysterious and untimely fate remains to\r\nbe hereafter related. By a second and better-assorted marriage, the earl\r\nof Cumberland became the father of George, his successor, our present\r\nsubject, who proved the most remarkable of this distinguished family.\r\nThe death of his father during his childhood had brought him under\r\nwardship to the queen; and by her command he was sent to pursue his\r\nstudies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, under Whitgift, afterwards primate.\r\nHere he applied himself with ardor to the mathematics, and it was\r\napparently the bent of his genius towards these studies which first\r\ncaused him to turn his attention to nautical matters. An enterprising\r\nspirit and a turn for all the fashionable profusions of the day, which\r\nspeedily plunged him in pecuniary embarrassments, added incitements to\r\nhis activity in these pursuits; and in 1586 he fitted out three ships\r\nand a pinnace to cruise against the Spaniards and plunder their\r\nsettlements. It appears extraordinary that he did not assume in person\r\nthe command of his little squadron; but combats and triumphs perhaps\r\nstill more glorious in his estimation awaited him on the smoother\r\nelement of the court.\r\n\r\nIn the games of chivalry he bore off the prize of courage and dexterity\r\nfrom all his peers; the romantic band of knights-tilters boasted of him\r\nas one of its brightest ornaments, and her majesty deigned to encourage\r\nhis devotedness to her glory by an envied pledge of favor.\r\n\r\nAs he stood or kneeled before her, she dropped her glove, perhaps not\r\nundesignedly, and on his picking it up, graciously desired him to keep\r\nit. He caused the trophy to be encircled with diamonds, and ever after\r\nat all tilts and tourneys bore it conspicuously placed in front of his\r\nhigh-crowned hat.\r\n\r\nBut the emergencies of the year 1588 summoned him to resign the\r\nfopperies of an antiquated knight-errantry for serious warfare and the\r\nexercise of genuine valor. Taking upon him the command of a ship, he\r\njoined the fleet appointed to hang upon the motions of the Spanish\r\narmada and harass it in its progress up the British Channel; and on\r\nseveral occasions, especially in the last action, off Calais, he\r\nsignalized himself by uncommon exertions.\r\n\r\nIn reward of his services, her majesty granted him her royal commission\r\nto pursue a voyage to the South Sea, which he had already projected; she\r\neven lent him for the occasion one of her own ships; and thus\r\nencouraged, he commenced that long series of naval enterprises which has\r\ngiven him an enduring name. After two or three voyages he constantly\r\ndeclined her majesty's gracious offers of the loan of her ships, because\r\nthey were accompanied with the express condition that he should never\r\nlay any vessel of hers on-board a Spanish one, lest both should be\r\ndestroyed by fire. Such was the character of mingled penuriousness and\r\ntimidity which pervaded the maritime policy of this great princess, even\r\nafter the defeat of the armada had demonstrated that, ship for ship, her\r\nnavy might defy the world!\r\n\r\nAt this period, all attempts against the power and prosperity of Spain\r\nwere naturally regarded with high favor and admiration; and it cannot be\r\ndenied that in his long and hazardous expeditions the earl of Cumberland\r\nevinced high courage, undaunted enterprise, and an extraordinary share\r\nof perseverance under repeated failures, disappointments, and hardships\r\nof every kind. It is also true that his vigorous attacks embarrassed\r\nextremely the intercourse of Spain with her colonies; and, besides the\r\ndirect injury which they inflicted, compelled this power to incur an\r\nimmense additional expense for the protection of her treasure-ships and\r\nsettlements. But the benefit to England was comparatively trifling; and\r\nto the earl himself, notwithstanding occasional captures of great value,\r\nhis voyages were far from producing any lasting advantage; they scarcely\r\nrepaid on the whole the cost of equipment; while the influx of sudden\r\nwealth with which they sometimes gratified him, only ministered food to\r\nthat magnificent profusion in which he finally squandered both his\r\nacquisitions and his patrimony. None of the liberal and enlightened\r\nviews which had prompted the efforts of the great navigators of this and\r\na preceding age appear to have had any share in the enterprises of the\r\nearl of Cumberland. Even the thirst of martial glory seems in him to\r\nhave been subordinate to the love of gain, and that appetite for rapine\r\nto which his loose and extravagant habits had given the force of a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nHe had formed, early in life, an attachment to the beautiful daughter of\r\nthat worthy character and rare exemplar of old English hospitality, sir\r\nWilliam Holles, ancestor to the earls of Clare of that surname; but her\r\nfather, from a singular pride of independence, refused to listen to his\r\nproposals, saying \"that he would not have to stand cap in hand to his\r\nson-in-law; his daughter should marry a good gentleman with whom he\r\nmight have society and friendship.\" Disappointed thus of the object of\r\nhis affections, he matched himself with a daughter of the earl of\r\nBedford; a woman of merit, as it appears, but whom their mutual\r\nindifference precluded from exerting over him any salutary influence. As\r\na husband, he proved both unfaithful and cruel; and separating himself\r\nafter a few years from his countess, on pretence of incompatibility of\r\ntempers, he suffered her to pine not only in desertion, but in poverty.\r\nWe shall hereafter have occasion to view this celebrated earl in the\r\nidly-solemn personage of queen's champion; meantime, he must be\r\ndismissed with no more of applause than may be challenged by a character\r\nsignally deficient in the guiding and restraining virtues, and endowed\r\nwith such a share only of the more active ones as served to render it\r\nconspicuous and glittering rather than truly and permanently\r\nillustrious.\r\n\r\nHenry earl of Northumberland likewise joined the fleet, on-board a\r\nvessel hired by himself. Immediately after the fatal catastrophe of his\r\nfather in 1585, this young nobleman, anxious apparently to efface the\r\nstigma of popery and disaffection stamped by the rash attempts of his\r\nuncle and father on the gallant name of Percy, had seized the\r\nopportunity of embarking with Leicester for the wars of the Low\r\nCountries. He now sought distinction on another element, and in a cause\r\nstill nearer to the hearts of Englishmen. The conversion to\r\nprotestantism and loyalty of the head of such a house could not but be\r\nregarded by Elizabeth with feelings of peculiar complacency, and in\r\n1593 she was pleased to confer upon the earl the insignia of the garter.\r\nHe was present in 1601 at the siege of Ostend, where he considered\r\nhimself as so much aggrieved by the conduct of sir Francis Vere, that on\r\nthe return of this officer to England he sent him a challenge. During\r\nthe decline of the queen's health, Northumberland was distinguished by\r\nthe warmth with which he embraced the interests of the king of Scots,\r\nand he was the first privy-councillor named by James on his accession to\r\nthe English throne. But the fate of his family seemed still to pursue\r\nhim: on some unsupported charges connected with the gunpowder plot, he\r\nwas stripped of all his offices, heavily fined, and sentenced to\r\nperpetual imprisonment: the tardy mercy of the king procured however his\r\nrelease at the end of fifteen years, and he spent the remnant of his\r\nlife in tranquil and honorable retirement. This unfortunate nobleman was\r\na man of parts: the abundant leisure for intellectual pursuits afforded\r\nby his long captivity was chiefly employed by him in the study of the\r\nmathematics, including perhaps the occult sciences; and as he was\r\npermitted to enjoy freely the conversation of such men of learning as he\r\nwished to assemble around him, he became one of their most bountiful\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nThomas Cecil, eldest son of the lord-treasurer, formerly a volunteer in\r\nthe expedition to Scotland undertaken in favor of the regent Murray, and\r\nmore recently appointed governor of the Brill in consideration of his\r\nservices in the war in Flanders, also embarked to repel the invaders;\r\nas did Robert his half-brother, the afterwards celebrated secretary of\r\nstate created earl of Salisbury by James I.\r\n\r\nRobert Cecil was deformed in his person, of a feeble and sickly\r\nconstitution, and entirely devoted to the study of politics; and\r\nnothing, it is to be presumed, but his steady determination of omitting\r\nno means of attracting to himself that royal favor which he contemplated\r\nas the instrument by which to work out his future fortunes, could have\r\nengaged him in a service so repugnant to his habits and pursuits, and\r\nfor which the hand of nature herself had so evidently disabled him.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Oxford, in expiation perhaps of some of those violences of\r\ntemper and irregularities of conduct by which he was perpetually\r\noffending the queen and obstructing his own advancement in the state,\r\nequipped on this occasion a vessel which he commanded.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Blount, notwithstanding the narrowness of his present\r\nfortunes, judged it incumbent on him to give a similar proof of\r\nattachment to his queen and country; and the circumstance affords an\r\noccasion of introducing to the notice of the reader one of the brightest\r\nornaments of the court of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished gentleman, now in the twenty-fifth year of his age,\r\nwas the second son of James sixth lord Montjoy of the ancient Norman\r\nname of Le Blonde, corruptly written Blount. The family history might\r\nserve as a commentary on the reigning follies of the English court\r\nduring two or three generations. His grandfather, a splendid courtier,\r\nconsumed his resources on the ostentatious equipage with which he\r\nattended to the French wars his master Henry VIII. with whom he had the\r\nmisfortune to be a favorite. His father squandered a diminished\r\npatrimony still more absurdly in his search after the philosopher's\r\nstone; and the ruin of the family was so consummated by the ill-timed\r\nprodigalities of his elder brother, that when his death without children\r\nin 1594 transmitted the title of lord Montjoy to sir Charles, a thousand\r\nmarks was the whole amount of the inheritance by which this honor was to\r\nbe maintained. It is needless to add that the younger brother's portion\r\nwith which he set out in life was next to nothing. Having thus his own\r\nway to make, he immediately after completing his education at Oxford\r\nentered himself of the Inner Temple, as meaning to pursue the profession\r\nof the law: but fortune had ordained his destiny otherwise; and being\r\nled by his curiosity to visit the court, he there found \"a pretty\r\nstrange kind of admission,\" which cannot be related with more vivacity\r\nthan in the original words of Naunton. \"He was then much about twenty\r\nyears of age, of a brown hair, a sweet face, a most neat composure, and\r\ntall in his person. The queen was then at Whitehall, and at dinner,\r\nwhither he came to see the fashion of the court. The queen had soon\r\nfound him out, and with a kind of an affected frown asked the lady\r\ncarver who he was? She answered, she knew him not; insomuch that enquiry\r\nwas made from one to another who he might be, till at length it was told\r\nthe queen that he was brother to the lord William Mountjoy. This\r\ninquisition, with the eye of majesty fixed upon him, (as she was wont\r\nto do to daunt men she knew not,) stirred the blood of this young\r\ngentleman, insomuch as his colour went and came; which the queen\r\nobserving called him unto her, and gave him her hand to kiss,\r\nencouraging him with gracious words and new looks; and so diverting her\r\nspeech to the lords and ladies, she said, that she no sooner observed\r\nhim but that she knew there was in him some noble blood, with some other\r\nexpressions of pity towards his house. And then again, demanding his\r\nname, she said, 'Fail you not to come to the court, and I will bethink\r\nmyself how to do you good.' And this was his inlet, and the beginning of\r\nhis grace.\" It does not appear what boon the queen immediately bestowed\r\nupon her new courtier; but he deserted the profession of the law, sat in\r\nthe parliaments of 1585 and 1586 as the representative of two different\r\nCornish boroughs, received in the latter year the honor of knighthood,\r\nand soon after his present expedition appeared considerable enough at\r\ncourt to provoke the hostility of the earl of Essex himself. Raleigh,\r\nnow high in favor, and invested with the offices of captain of the\r\nqueen's guard and her lieutenant for Cornwall, had been actively engaged\r\nsince the last year in training to arms the militia of that county. He\r\nhad also been employed, as a member of the council of war, in concerting\r\nthe general plan of national defence: but his ardent and adventurous\r\nvalor prompted him to aid his country in her hour of trial on both\r\nelements, and with hand as well as head: throwing himself therefore into\r\na vessel of his own which waited his orders, he hastened to share in\r\nthe discomfiture of her insulting foe.\r\n\r\nBut it would be endless to enumerate all who spontaneously came forward\r\nto partake the perils and the glory of this ever-memorable contest; and\r\nthe naval commanders of principal eminence have higher claims to our\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe dignity of lord-high-admiral,--customarily conferred on mere men of\r\nrank, in whom not the slightest tincture of professional knowledge was\r\nrequired or expected,--at this critical juncture belonged to Charles\r\nsecond lord Howard of Effingham, of whom we have formerly spoken, and\r\nwho appears never in the whole course of his life to have been at sea\r\nbut once before, and that only on an occasion of ceremony. He was every\r\nway an untried man, and as yet distinguished for nothing except the\r\naccomplishments of a courtier: but he exhibited on trial courage,\r\nresolution, and conduct; an affability of manner which endeared him to\r\nthe sailors; and a prudent sense of his own inexperience, which rendered\r\nhim perfectly docile to the counsels of those excellent sea-officers by\r\nwhom he had the good fortune to find himself surrounded. He encouraged\r\nhis crew, and manifested his alacrity in the service, by putting his own\r\nhand to the rope which was to tow his ship out of harbour; and he\r\nafterwards gave proof of his good sense and his patriotism, by his\r\nopposition to the orders which her majesty's excess of oeconomy led\r\nher to issue on the first dispersion of the armada by a storm, for\r\nlaying up four of her largest ships; earnestly requesting that he might\r\nbe permitted to retain them at his own expense rather than the safety of\r\nthe country should be risked by their dismissal. John Hawkins, one of\r\nthe ablest and most experienced seamen of the age, was chiefly relied\r\nupon for the conduct of the main fleet, in which he acted as\r\nvice-admiral. For his good service he was knighted by the lord-admiral\r\non board his own ship immediately after the action, when the like honor\r\nwas bestowed on that eminent navigator Frobisher, who led into action\r\nthe Triumph, one of the three first-rates which were then all that the\r\nEnglish navy could boast.\r\n\r\nTo the hero Drake, as rear-admiral, a separate squadron was intrusted;\r\nand it was by this division that the principal execution was done upon\r\nthe discomfited armada as it fled in confusion before the valor of the\r\nEnglish and the fury of their tempestuous seas. An enormous galleon\r\nsurrendered without firing a shot to the much smaller vessel of Drake,\r\npurely from the terror of his name.\r\n\r\nWhilst the lord-admiral, with the principal fleet stationed off\r\nPlymouth, prepared to engage the armada in its passage up the Channel,\r\nsir Henry Seymour, youngest son of the protector, was stationed with a\r\nsmaller force, partly English partly Flemish, off Dunkirk, for the\r\npurpose of intercepting the duke of Parma, who was lying with his\r\nveteran forces on the coast, ready to embark and co-operate in the\r\nconquest of England.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these naval preparations, which happily sufficed in the\r\nevent to frustrate entirely the designs of the enemy, equal activity\r\nwas exerted to place the land-forces in a condition to dispute the soil\r\nagainst the finest troops and most consummate general of Europe.\r\n\r\nAn army of reserve consisting of about thirty-six thousand men was drawn\r\ntogether for the defence of the queen's person, and appointed to march\r\ntowards any quarter in which the most pressing danger should manifest\r\nitself. A smaller, but probably better appointed, force of twenty-three\r\nthousand was stationed in a camp near Tilbury to protect the capital,\r\nagainst which it was not doubted that the most formidable efforts of the\r\nenemy on making good his landing would be immediately directed.\r\n\r\nOwing to the long peace which the country had enjoyed, England possessed\r\nat this juncture no general of reputation, though, doubtless, a\r\nsufficiency of men of resolution and capacity whom a short experience of\r\nactual service would have matured into able officers. Under\r\ncircumstances which afforded to the government so small a choice of men,\r\nthe respective appointments of Arthur lord Grey,--distinguished by the\r\nvigor which he had exerted in suppressing the last Irish rebellion,--to\r\nthe post of president of the council of war; of lord Hunsdon,--a brave\r\nsoldier long practised in the desultory warfare of the northern border,\r\nas well as in several regular campaigns against Scotland,--to the\r\ncommand of the army of reserve; and of the earl of Essex,--a gallant\r\nyouth who had fleshed his maiden sword and gained his spurs in the\r\naffair of Zutphen,--to the post of general of the horse in the main\r\narmy;--seem to have merited the sanction of public approbation. But the\r\nmost strenuous defender of the measures of her majesty must have been\r\nstaggered by her nomination of Leicester,--the hated, the disgraced, the\r\nincapable Leicester,--to the station of highest honor, danger, and\r\nimportance;--that of commander in chief of the army at Tilbury. Military\r\nexperience, indeed, the favorite possessed in a higher degree than most\r\nof those to whom the defence of the country was now of necessity\r\nintrusted, but of skill and conduct he had proved himself destitute;\r\neven his personal courage was doubtful; and his recent failures in\r\nHolland must have inspired distrust in the bosom of every individual,\r\nwhether officer or private, appointed to serve under him. Something must\r\nbe allowed for the embarrassments of the time; the deficiency of\r\nmilitary talent; the high rank of Leicester in the service, which\r\nforbade his employment in any inferior capacity: but, with all these\r\npalliations, the nomination of such an antagonist to confront the duke\r\nof Parma must eternally be regarded as the weakest act into which the\r\nprudence of Elizabeth was ever betrayed by a blind and unaccountable\r\npartiality.\r\n\r\nAll these preparations for defence being finally arranged, her majesty\r\nresolved to visit in person the camp at Tilbury, for the purpose of\r\nencouraging her troops.\r\n\r\nIt had been a part of the commendation of Elizabeth, that in her public\r\nappearances, of whatsoever nature, no sovereign on record had _acted_\r\nthe part so well, or with such universal applause. But on this\r\nmemorable and momentous occasion, when,--like a second Boadicea, armed\r\nfor defence against the invader of her country,--she appeared at once\r\nthe warrior and the queen, the sacred feelings of the moment, superior\r\nto all the artifices of regal dignity and the tricks of regal\r\ncondescension, inspired her with that impressive earnestness of look, of\r\nwords, of gesture, which alone is truly dignified and truly eloquent.\r\n\r\nMounted on a noble charger, with a general's truncheon in her hand, a\r\ncorselet of polished steel laced on over her magnificent apparel, and a\r\npage in attendance bearing her white-plumed helmet, she rode bare-headed\r\nfrom rank to rank with a courageous deportment and smiling countenance;\r\nand amid the affectionate plaudits and shouts of military ardor which\r\nburst from the animated and admiring soldiery, she addressed them in the\r\nfollowing short and spirited harangue.\r\n\r\n\"My loving people; we have been persuaded by some that are careful of\r\nour safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes,\r\nfor fear of treachery; but, assure you, I do not desire to live to\r\ndistrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear: I have always\r\nso behaved myself that, under God, I have placed my chiefest strength\r\nand safeguard in the loyal hearts and good-will of my subjects. And\r\ntherefore I am come amongst you at this time, not as for my recreation\r\nor sport, but being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle, to\r\nlive or die amongst you all; to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom,\r\nand for my people, my honor and my blood, even in the dust. I know I\r\nhave but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart of a\r\nking, and of a king of England too; and think foul scorn that Parma or\r\nSpain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my\r\nrealms: To which, rather than any dishonor should grow by me, I myself\r\nwill take up arms; I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of\r\nevery one of your virtues in the field.\r\n\r\n\"I know already by your forwardness, that you have deserved rewards and\r\ncrowns; and we do assure you, on the word of a prince, they shall be\r\nduly paid you. In the meantime, my lieutenant-general shall be in my\r\nstead, than whom never prince commanded a more noble and worthy subject;\r\nnot doubting by your obedience to my general, by your concord in the\r\ncamp, and your valor in the field, we shall shortly have a famous\r\nvictory over those enemies of my God, of my kingdom, and of my people.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary reliance placed by the queen in this emergency upon\r\nthe counsels of Leicester encouraged the insatiable favorite to grasp at\r\nhonor and authority still more exorbitant; and he ventured to urge her\r\nmajesty to invest him with the office of her lieutenant in England and\r\nIreland; a dignity paramount to all other commands. She had the weakness\r\nto comply; and it is said that the patent was actually drawn out, when\r\nthe defeat of the armada, by taking away all pretext for the creation of\r\nsuch an officer, gave her leisure to attend to the earnest\r\nrepresentations of Hatton and Burleigh on the imprudence of conferring\r\non any subject powers so excessive, and capable even in some instances\r\nof controlling her own prerogative. On better consideration the project\r\ntherefore was dropped.\r\n\r\nIt is foreign from the business of this work to detail the particulars\r\nof that signal victory obtained by English seamanship and English valor\r\nagainst the boasted armament of Spain, prodigiously superior as it was\r\nin every circumstance of force excepting the moral energies employed to\r\nwield it. While the history of the year 1588 in all its details must\r\never form a favorite chapter in the splendid tale of England's naval\r\nglory, it will here suffice to mark the general results.\r\n\r\nNot a single Spaniard set foot on English ground but as a prisoner; one\r\nEnglish vessel only, and that of smaller size, became the prize of the\r\ninvaders. The duke of Parma did not venture to embark a man. The king of\r\nScots, standing firm to his alliance with his illustrious kinswoman,\r\nafforded not the slightest succour to the Spanish ships which the storms\r\nand the English drove in shattered plight upon his rugged coasts; while\r\nthe lord-deputy of Ireland caused to be butchered without remorse the\r\ncrews of all the vessels wrecked upon that island in their disastrous\r\ncircumnavigation of Great Britain: so that not more than half of this\r\nvaunted _invincible armada_ returned in safety to the ports of Spain.\r\nNever in the records of history was the event of war on one side more\r\nentirely satisfactory, and glorious, on the other more deeply\r\nhumiliating and utterly disgraceful. Philip did indeed support the\r\ncredit of his personal character by the dignified composure with which\r\nhe heard the tidings of this great disaster; but it was out of his power\r\nto throw the slightest veil over the dishonor of the Spanish arms, or\r\nrepair the total and final failure of the great popish cause.\r\n\r\nBy the English nation, this signal discomfiture of its most dreaded and\r\ndetested foe was hailed as the victory of protestant principles no less\r\nthan of national independence; and the tidings of the national\r\ndeliverance were welcomed, by all the reformed churches of Europe, with\r\nan ardor of joy and thankfulness proportioned to the intenseness of\r\nanxiety with which they had watched the event of a conflict where their\r\nown dearest interests were staked along with the existence of their best\r\nally and firmest protector.\r\n\r\nRepeated thanksgivings were observed in London in commemoration of this\r\ngreat event: on the anniversary of the queen's birth a general festival\r\nwas proclaimed and celebrated with \"sermons, singing of psalms,\r\nbonfires, &c.\" and on the following Sunday her majesty went in state to\r\nSt. Paul's, magnificently attended by her nobles and great officers, and\r\nborne along on a sumptuous chariot formed like a throne, with four\r\npillars supporting a canopy, and drawn by a pair of white horses. The\r\nstreets through which she passed were hung with blue cloth, in honor\r\ndoubtless of the navy, and the colors taken from the enemy were borne in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nHer majesty rewarded the lord-admiral with a considerable pension, and\r\nsettled annuities on the wounded seamen and on some of the more\r\nnecessitous among the officers; the rest she honored with much personal\r\nnotice and many gracious terms of commendation, which they were expected\r\nto receive in lieu of more substantial remuneration;--for parsimony, the\r\ndarling virtue of Elizabeth, was not forgotten even in her gratitude to\r\nthe brave defenders of her country.\r\n\r\nTwo medals were struck on this great occasion; one, representing a fleet\r\nretiring under full sail, with the motto, \"_Venit, vidit, fugit_;\" the\r\nother, fire-ships scattering a fleet; the motto, \"_Dux faemina facti_;\" a\r\ncompliment to the queen, who is said to have herself suggested the\r\nemployment of these engines of destruction, by which the armada suffered\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nThe intense interest in public events excited in every class by the\r\nthreatened invasion of Spain, gave rise to the introduction in this\r\ncountry of one of the most important inventions of social life,--that of\r\nnewspapers. Previously to this period all articles of intelligence had\r\nbeen circulated in manuscript; and all political remarks which the\r\ngovernment had found itself interested in addressing to the people, had\r\nissued from the press in the shape of pamphlets, of which many had been\r\ncomposed during the administration of Burleigh, either by himself or\r\nimmediately under his direction. But the peculiar convenience at such a\r\njuncture of uniting these two objects in a periodical publication\r\nbecoming obvious to the ministry, there appeared, some time in the month\r\nof April 1588, the first number of _The English Mercury_; a paper\r\nresembling the present London Gazette, which must have come out almost\r\ndaily; since No. 50, the earliest specimen of the work now extant, is\r\ndated July 23d of the same year. This interesting relic is preserved in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the public rejoicings an event occurred, which, in\r\nwhatever manner it might be felt by Elizabeth herself, certainly cast no\r\ndamp on the spirits of the nation at large; the death of Leicester.\r\n\r\nAfter the frequent notices of this celebrated favorite contained in the\r\nforegoing pages, a formal delineation of his character is\r\nunnecessary;--a few traits may however be added.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his letters and public papers, Naunton says, \"I never yet\r\nsaw a style or phrase more seeming religious and fuller of the streams\r\nof devotion;\" and notwithstanding the charge of hypocrisy on this head\r\nusually brought against Leicester in the most unqualified terms, many\r\nreasons might induce us to believe his religious faith sincere, and his\r\nattachment for certain schemes of doctrine, zealous. On no other\r\nsupposition does it appear possible to account for that steady patronage\r\nof the puritanical party,--so odious to his mistress,--which gave on\r\nsome occasions such important advantages over him to his adversary\r\nHatton,--the only minister of Elizabeth who appears to have aimed at the\r\ncharacter of a high church-of-England man. The circumstance also of his\r\ndevoting during his lifetime a considerable sum of ready money, which\r\nhe could ill spare, to the endowment of a hospital, has much the air of\r\nan act of expiation prompted by religious fears. As a statesman\r\nLeicester appears to have displayed on some occasions considerable\r\nacuteness and penetration, but in the higher kind of wisdom he was\r\nutterly deficient. His moral insensibility sometimes caused him to offer\r\nto his sovereign the most pernicious counsels; and had not the superior\r\nrectitude of Burleigh's judgement interposed, his influence might have\r\ninflicted still deeper wounds on the honor of the queen and the\r\nprosperity of the nation.\r\n\r\nTowards his own friends and adherents he is said to have been a\r\nreligious observer of his promises; a virtue very remarkable in such a\r\nman. In the midst of that profusion which rendered him rapacious, he was\r\ncapable of acts of real generosity, and both soldiers and scholars\r\ntasted largely of his bounty. That he was guilty of many detestable acts\r\nof oppression, and pursued with secret and unrelenting vengeance such as\r\noffended his arrogance by any failure in the servile homage which he\r\nmade it his glory to exact, are charges proved by undeniable facts; but\r\nit has already been observed that the more atrocious of the crimes\r\npopularly imputed to him, remain, and must ever remain, matters of\r\nsuspicion rather than proof.\r\n\r\nHis conduct during the younger part of life was scandalously licentious:\r\nlatterly he became, says Camden, uxorious to excess. In the early days\r\nof his favor with the queen, her profuse donations had gratified his\r\ncupidity and displayed the fondness of her attachment; but at a later\r\nperiod the stream of her bounty ran low; and following the natural bent\r\nof her disposition, or complying with the necessity of her affairs, she\r\ncompelled him to mortgage to her his barony of Denbigh for the expenses\r\nof his last expedition to Holland. Immediately after his death she also\r\ncaused his effects to be sold by auction, for the satisfaction of\r\ncertain demands of her treasury. From these circumstances it may\r\nprobably be inferred, that the influence which Leicester still retained\r\nover her was secured rather by the chain of habit than the tie of\r\naffection; and after the first shock of final separation from him whom\r\nshe had so long loved and trusted, it is not improbable that she might\r\ncontemplate the event with a feeling somewhat akin to that of\r\ndeliverance from a yoke under which her haughty spirit had repined\r\nwithout the courage to resist.\r\n\r\nLeicester died, beyond all doubt, of a fever; but so reluctant were the\r\nprejudices of that age to dismiss any eminent person by the ordinary\r\nroads of mortality, that it was judged necessary to take examinations\r\nbefore the privy-council respecting certain magical practices said to\r\nhave been employed against his life. The son of sir James Croft\r\ncomptroller of the household, made no scruple to confess that he had\r\nconsulted an adept of the name of Smith, to learn who were his father's\r\nenemies in the council; that Smith mentioned the earl of Leicester; and\r\nthat a little while after, flirting with his thumbs, he exclaimed,\r\nalluding to this nobleman's cognisance, \"The bear is bound to the\r\nstake;\" and again, that nothing could now save him. But as it might\r\nafter all have been difficult to show in what manner the flirting of a\r\nthumb in London could have exerted a fatal power over the life of the\r\nearl at Kennelworth, the adept seems to have escaped unpunished,\r\nnotwithstanding the accidental fulfilment of his denunciations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFROM 1588 TO 1591.\r\n\r\nEffects of Leicester's death.--Rise of the queen's affection for\r\nEssex.--Trial of the earl of Arundel.--Letter of Walsingham on religious\r\naffairs.--Death of Mildmay.--Case of don Antonio.--Expedition to\r\nCadiz.--Behaviour of Essex.--Traits of sir C.

The powerful faction of which the favorite had been\r\nthe head, acknowledged a new leader in the earl of Essex, whom his\r\nstep-father had brought forward at court as a counterpoise to the\r\ninfluence of Raleigh, and who now stood second to none in the good\r\ngraces of her majesty. But Essex, however gifted with noble and\r\nbrilliant qualities totally deficient in Leicester, was on the other\r\nhand confessedly inferior to him in several other endowments still more\r\nessential to the leader of a court party. Though not void of art, he was\r\nby no means master of the profound dissimulation, the exquisite address,\r\nand especially the wary coolness by which his predecessor well knew how\r\nto accomplish his ends in despite of all opposition. His character was\r\nimpetuous, his natural disposition frank; and experience had not yet\r\ntaught him to distrust either himself or others.\r\n\r\nWith the friendships, Essex received as an inheritance the enmities also\r\nof Leicester, and no one at court could have entertained the least doubt\r\nwhom he regarded as his principal opponent; but it would have been\r\ndeemed too high a pitch of presumption in so young a man and so recent a\r\nfavorite as Essex, to place himself in immediate and open hostility to\r\nthe long established and far extending influence of Burleigh. With this\r\ngreat minister therefore and his adherents he attempted at first a kind\r\nof compromise, and the noted division of the court into the Essex and\r\nthe Cecil parties does not appear to have taken place till some years\r\nafter the period of which we are treating. Meantime, the death of\r\nWalsingham afforded the lord-treasurer an occasion of introducing to the\r\nnotice and confidence of her majesty, and eventually to the important\r\noffice of secretary of state, his son Robert, whose transcendent talents\r\nfor affairs, joined to the utmost refinement of intrigue and duplicity,\r\nimmediately established him in the same independence on the good will of\r\nthe new favorite, as the elder Cecil had ever asserted on that of the\r\nformer one; and appears finally to have enabled him to prepare in secret\r\nthat favorite's disastrous fall.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Elizabeth herself, it has been a thousand times remarked,\r\nthat she was never able to forget the woman in the sovereign; and in\r\nspite of that preponderating love of sway which all her life forbade her\r\nto admit a partner of her bed and throne, her heart was to the last\r\ndeeply sensible to the want, or her imagination to the charm, of loving\r\nand being beloved. The death therefore of the man who had been for\r\nthirty years the object of a tenderness which he had long repaid by\r\nevery flattering profession, every homage of gallantry, and every\r\nmanifestation of entire devotedness, left, notwithstanding any late\r\ndisgusts which she might have entertained, a void in her existence which\r\nshe felt it necessary to supply. It was this situation, doubtless, of\r\nher feelings which led to the gradual conversion into a softer\r\nsentiment, of that natural and innocent tenderness with which she had\r\nhitherto regarded the brilliant and engaging qualities of her youthful\r\nkinsman the earl of Essex;--a change which terminated so fatally to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe enormous disproportion of ages gave to the new inclination of the\r\nqueen a stamp of dotage inconsistent with the reputation for good sense\r\nand dignity of conduct which she had hitherto preserved. Nor did she\r\nlong receive from the indulgence of so untimely a sentiment any portion\r\nof the felicity which she coveted. The careless and even affronting\r\nbehaviour in which Essex occasionally indulged himself, combined with\r\nher own sagacity to admonish her that her fondness was unreturned; and\r\nthat nothing but the substantial benefits by which it declared itself\r\ncould have induced its object to meet it with even the semblance of\r\ngratitude. As this mortifying conviction came home to her bosom, she\r\ngrew restless, irritable, and captious to excess; she watched all his\r\nmotions with a self-tormenting jealousy; she fed her own disquiet by\r\nlistening to the malicious informations of his enemies; and her heart at\r\nlength becoming callous by repeated exasperations, she began to visit\r\nhis delinquencies with an unrelenting sternness. This conduct, attempted\r\ntoo late and persisted in too long, hurried Essex to his ruin, and ended\r\nby inflicting upon herself the mortal agonies of an unavailing\r\nrepentance.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon relates, in his Apophthegms, that \"a great officer about\r\ncourt when my lord of Essex was first in trouble, and that he and those\r\nthat dealt for him would talk much of my lord's friends and of his\r\nenemies, answered to one of them; 'I will tell you, I know but one\r\nfriend and one enemy my lord hath; and that one friend is the queen, and\r\nthat one enemy, is himself.'\" But rather might both have been esteemed\r\nhis enemies; for what except the imprudent fondness of the queen, and\r\nthe excess of favor which she at first lavished upon him, was the\r\noriginal cause of that intoxication of mind which finally became the\r\ninstrument of his destruction?\r\n\r\nBut from observations which anticipate perhaps too much the catastrophe\r\nof this melancholy history, it is time to return to a narrative of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish armament incidentally became the occasion of involving the\r\nearl of Arundel in a charge of a capital nature. Ever since the\r\ntreachery of his agents, in the year 1585, had baffled his design of\r\nquitting for ever a country in which his religion and his political\r\nattachments had rendered him an alien, this unfortunate nobleman had\r\nremained close prisoner in the Tower. Such treatment might well be\r\nsupposed calculated to augment the vehemence of his bigotry and the\r\nrancor of his disaffection; and it became a current report that, on\r\nhearing news of the sailing of the armada, he had caused a mass of the\r\nHoly Ghost and devotions of twenty-four hours continuance to be\r\ncelebrated for its success. This rumor being confirmed by one Bennet, a\r\npriest then under examination, and other circumstances of suspicion\r\ncoming out, the earl, on April the 14th, 1589, was brought to the bar of\r\nthe house of lords on a charge of high treason. Bennet, struck with\r\ncompunction, addressed to him a letter acknowledging his testimony to\r\nhave been false, and extorted from him solely by the fear of the rack.\r\nBut it appears that this letter, still extant among the Burleigh papers,\r\nwas intercepted by the government; and the prisoner, by this cruel and\r\niniquitous artifice, was deprived of all means of invalidating the\r\ntestimony of Bennet, who was brought into court as a witness against\r\nhim. By a second violation of every principle of justice, the matters\r\nfor which, as contempts, he had already undergone the sentence of the\r\nStar-chamber, were now introduced into his indictment for high treason,\r\nto which the following articles were added;--that he had engaged to\r\nassist cardinal Allen in the restoration of popery;--that he had\r\nintimated the unfitness of the queen to govern;--that he had caused\r\nmasses to be said for the success of the armada;--that he had attempted\r\nto withdraw himself beyond seas for the purpose of serving under the\r\nduke of Parma;--and that he had been privy to the bull of Pope Sixtus V.\r\ntransferring the sovereignty of England from her majesty to the king of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nTo all these articles, which he was not allowed to separate, the earl\r\npleaded Not guilty; but afterwards, in his defence, confessed some of\r\nthem, though with certain extenuations. He asserted, that the prayers\r\nand masses which he had caused to be said, were for the averting of a\r\ngeneral massacre of the English catholics, alleged to be designed; and\r\nnot for the success of the armada. The aid to the catholic cause, which\r\nhe had promised in his correspondence with cardinal Allen, he declared\r\nto refer only to peaceful attempts at making converts, not to the\r\nencouragement of any plan of rebellion. He acknowledged a design of\r\ngoing to serve under the prince of Parma, since he was denied the\r\nexercise of his religion at home; but he argued his innocence of any\r\nview of cooperating in plans of invasion, from the circumstance, that\r\nhis attempt to leave England had taken place during the year fixed by\r\ncardinal Allen and the queen of Scots for the execution of a scheme of\r\nthis nature.\r\n\r\nThe crown-lawyers, in order to make out a case of constructive treason,\r\nurged the reconcilement of the prisoner with the church of Rome, which\r\nthey held to be of itself a traitorous act; his correspondence with\r\ndeclared traitors; and the high opinion entertained of him by the queen\r\nof Scots and cardinal Allen, as the chief support of popery in England.\r\nThey likewise exhibited an emblematical picture found in his house,\r\nrepresenting in one part a hand shaking off a viper into the fire, with\r\nthe motto, \"If God is for us who can be against us?\" and in another part\r\na lion, the cognisance of the Howard family, deprived of his claws,\r\nunder him the words, \"Yet still a lion.\" On these charges, none of\r\nwhich, though proved by the most unexceptionable witnesses, could bring\r\nhim within the true meaning of the old statute of Edward III., on which\r\nhe was indicted, the peers were base enough to pronounce an unanimous\r\nverdict of Guilty; which he received, as his father had done before him,\r\nwith the words \"God's will be done!\" But here the queen felt herself\r\nconcerned in honor to interpose. It had ever been her maxim and her\r\nboast, to punish none capitally for religious delinquencies unconnected\r\nwith traitorous designs; and sensible probably how imperfectly in this\r\ncase the latter had been proved, she was pleased, in her abundant mercy,\r\nto commute the capital part of the sentence against her unhappy kinsman\r\nfor perpetual imprisonment, attended with the forfeiture of the greater\r\npart of his estate.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, this victim of the religious dissensions of a fierce and\r\nbigoted age ended in his thirty-ninth year an unfortunate life,\r\nshortened, as well as embittered, by the more than monkish austerities\r\nwhich he imagined it meritorious to inflict upon himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of the abortive attempt at insurrection under the earls\r\nof Northumberland and Westmorland, the whole course of public events had\r\ntended to increase the difficulties and aggravate the sufferings in\r\nwhich the catholics of England found themselves inextricably involved.\r\nTheir situation was thus forcibly depicted by Philip Sidney, in a\r\npassage of his celebrated letter to her majesty against the French\r\nmarriage, which at the present day will probably be read in a spirit\r\nvery different from that in which it was written.\r\n\r\n\"The other faction, most rightly indeed to be called a faction, is the\r\npapists; men whose spirits are full of anguish; some being infested by\r\nothers whom they accounted damnable; some having their ambition stopped\r\nbecause they are not in the way of advancement; some in prison and\r\ndisgrace; some whose best friends are banished practisers; many thinking\r\nyou an usurper; many thinking also you had disannulled your right\r\nbecause of the pope's excommunication; all burthened with the weight of\r\ntheir consciences. Men of great numbers, of great riches (because the\r\naffairs of state have not lain on them), of united minds, as all men\r\nthat deem themselves oppressed naturally are.\"\r\n\r\nA further commentary on the hardships of their condition may be\r\nextracted from an apology for the measures of the English government\r\ntowards both papists and puritans, addressed by Walsingham to M. Critoy\r\nthe French secretary of state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Whereas you desire to be advertised touching the proceedings here in\r\necclesiastical causes, because you seem to note in them some inconstancy\r\nand variation, as if we sometimes inclined to one side, sometimes to\r\nanother, as if that clemency and lenity were not used of late that was\r\nused in the beginning, all which you impute to your own superficial\r\nunderstanding of the affairs of this state, having notwithstanding her\r\nmajesty's doing in singular reverence, as the real pledges which she\r\nhath given unto the world of her sincerity in religion and her wisdom in\r\ngovernment well meriteth; I am glad of this occasion to impart that\r\nlittle I know in that matter to you, both for your own satisfaction, and\r\nto the end you may make use thereof towards any that shall not be so\r\nmodestly and so reasonably minded as you are. I find therefore her\r\nmajesty's proceedings to have been grounded upon two principles.\r\n\r\n\"1. The one, that consciences are not to be forced, but to be won and\r\nreduced by the force of truth, with the aid of time, and use of all good\r\nmeans of instruction and persuasion.\r\n\r\n\"2. The other, that the causes of conscience, wherein they exceed their\r\nbounds, and grow to be matter of faction, lose their nature; and that\r\nsovereign princes ought distinctly to punish the practice in contempt,\r\nthough coloured under the pretence of conscience and religion.\r\n\r\n\"According to these principles, her majesty, at her coming to the crown,\r\nutterly disliking the tyranny of Rome, which had used by terror and\r\nrigor to settle commandments of men's faiths and consciences; though, as\r\na prince of great wisdom and magnanimity, she suffered but the exercise\r\nof one religion, yet her proceedings towards the papists was with great\r\nlenity, expecting the good effects which time might work in them. And\r\ntherefore her majesty revived not the laws made in the 28 and 35 of her\r\nfather's reign, whereby the oath of supremacy might have been offered at\r\nthe king's pleasure to any subject, though he kept his conscience never\r\nso modestly to himself; and the refusal to take the same oath without\r\nfurther circumstance was made treason. But contrariwise her majesty, not\r\nliking to make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts, except the\r\nabundance of them did overflow into overt or express acts or\r\naffirmations, tempered her laws so as it restraineth every manifest\r\ndisobedience in impugning and impeaching advisedly and maliciously her\r\nmajesty's supreme power, maintaining and extolling a foreign\r\njurisdiction. And as for the oath, it was altered by her majesty into a\r\nmore grateful form; the hardness of the name and appellation of supreme\r\nhead was removed; and the penalty of the refusal thereof turned only\r\ninto disablement to take any promotion, or to exercise any charge, and\r\nyet with liberty of being reinvested therein if any man should accept\r\nthereof during his life. But when, after Pius Quintus had excommunicated\r\nher majesty, and the bills of excommunication were published in London,\r\nwhereby her majesty was in a sort proscribed; and that thereupon, as a\r\nprincipal motive or preparative, followed the rebellion in the North;\r\nyet because the ill-humors of the realm were by that rebellion partly\r\npurged, and that she feared at that time no foreign invasion, and much\r\nless the attempt of any within the realm not backed by some potent\r\nsuccour from without, she contented herself to make a law against that\r\nspecial case of bringing and publishing any bulls, or the like\r\ninstruments; whereunto was added a prohibition, upon pain, not of\r\ntreason, but of an inferior degree of punishment, against the bringing\r\nin of _agnus Dei_, hallowed bread, and such other merchandise of Rome,\r\nas are well known not to be any essential part of the Romish religion,\r\nbut only to be used in practice as love-tokens to inchant the people's\r\naffections from their allegiance to their natural sovereign. In all\r\nother points her majesty continued her former lenity: but when, about\r\nthe twentieth year of her reign, she had discovered in the king of Spain\r\nan intention to invade her dominions, and that a principal part of the\r\nplot was, to prepare a party within the realm that might adhere to the\r\nforeigner; and after that the seminaries began to blossom, and to send\r\nforth daily priests and professed men, who should by vow taken at shrift\r\nreconcile her subjects from their obedience, yea, and bind many of them\r\nto attempt against her majesty's sacred person; and that, by the poison\r\nwhich they spread, the humors of papists were altered, and that they\r\nwere no more papists in conscience, and of softness, but papists in\r\nfaction; then were there new laws made for the punishment of such as\r\nshould submit themselves to such reconcilements, or renunciations of\r\nobedience. And because it was a treason carried in the clouds, and in\r\nwonderful secresy, and came seldom to light, and that there was no\r\npresupposition thereof so great, as the recusants to come to divine\r\nservice, because it was set down by their decrees, that to come to\r\nchurch before reconcilement was absolutely heretical and damnable.\r\nTherefore there were laws added containing punishment pecuniary against\r\nsuch recusants, not to enforce conscience, but to enfeeble and\r\nimpoverish the means of those of whom it resteth indifferent and\r\nambiguous whether they were reconciled or no. And when, notwithstanding\r\nall this provision, this poison was dispersed so secretly, as that there\r\nwere no means to stay it but by restraining the merchants that brought\r\nit in; then, lastly, there was added another law, whereby such seditious\r\npriests of new erection were exiled, and those that were at that time\r\nwithin the land shipped over, and so commanded to keep hence on pain of\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n\"This hath been the proceeding, though intermingled not only with sundry\r\nexamples of her majesty's grace towards such as she knew to be papists\r\nin conscience, and not in faction and singularity, but also with an\r\nordinary mitigation towards offenders in the highest degree committed\r\nby law, if they would but protest, that in case the realm should be\r\ninvaded with a foreign army, by the Pope's authority, for the catholic\r\ncause, as they term it, they would take part with her majesty and not\r\nadhere to her enemies.\" &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe country sustained a heavy loss in 1589 by the death of sir Walter\r\nMildmay chancellor of the exchequer, one of the most irreproachable\r\npublic characters and best patriots of the age. He was old enough to\r\nhave received his introduction to business in the time of Henry VIII.,\r\nunder whom he enjoyed a gainful office in the court of augmentations.\r\nDuring the reign of Edward he was warden of the mint. Under Mary, he\r\nshrowded himself in that profound obscurity in which alone he could make\r\nsafety accord with honor and conscience. Elizabeth, on the death of sir\r\nRichard Sackville in 1568, advanced Mildmay to the important post of\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, which he held to the end of his life; but\r\nnot so, it should appear, the favor of her majesty, some of his _back\r\nfriends_, or secret enemies, having whispered in her ear, that he was a\r\nbetter patriot than subject, and over-popular in parliament, where he\r\nhad gone so far as to complain that many subsidies were granted and few\r\ngrievances redressed. Another strong ground of royal displeasure existed\r\nin the imputation of puritanism under which he labored.\r\n\r\nGenerously sacrificing to higher considerations the aggrandizement of\r\nhis children, Mildmay devoted a large share of the wealth which he had\r\ngained in the public service to the erection and endowment of a\r\ncollege;--that of Emanuel at Cambridge,--an action little agreeable it\r\nseems to her majesty,--for, on his coming to court after the completion\r\nof this noble undertaking, she said tartly to him; \"Sir Walter, I hear\r\nyou have erected a puritan foundation.\" \"No, Madam,\" replied he; \"far be\r\nit from me to countenance any thing contrary to your established laws;\r\nbut I have set an acorn, which, when it comes to be an oak, God alone\r\nknows what will be the fruit of it.\" That this fruit however proved to\r\nbe of the flavor so much distasted by her majesty, there is good\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n    \"In the house of pure Emanuel\r\n    I had my education,\r\n    Where some surmise I dazzled my eyes\r\n    With the light of revelation;\"\r\n\r\nsays \"the Distracted Puritan,\" in a song composed in king James's days\r\nby the witty bishop Corbet.\r\n\r\nMildmay was succeeded in his office by sir John Fortescue, master of the\r\nwardrobe, a gentleman whose accomplishments in classical literature had\r\ninduced the queen to take him for her guide and assistant in the study\r\nof the Greek and Latin writers. In the discharge of his new functions he\r\ntoo was distinguished by moderation and integrity, so that in this\r\nimportant department of administration no oppression was exercised upon\r\nthe subject during the whole of the reign;--a circumstance highly\r\nconducive both to the popularity of the queen, and to the alacrity in\r\ngranting supplies usually exhibited by her parliaments.\r\n\r\nThe late attempt at invasion, so gloriously and happily frustrated, had\r\ngiven a new impulse to the public mind; the gallant youth of the country\r\nwere seized with an universal rage for military enterprise, and burned\r\nat once for vengeance and renown. The riches and the weakness of the\r\nSpanish empire, both of them considerably exaggerated in popular\r\nopinion, tempted the hopes and the cupidity of adventurers of a\r\ndifferent class; and by means of the united stimulus of gain and glory,\r\na numerous fleet was fitted out in the spring of 1589 for an expedition\r\nto Portugal, which was equipped and manned almost entirely by the\r\nexertions of individuals, the queen contributing only sixty-six thousand\r\npounds to the expenses, and six of her ships to the armament.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, that on the death in 1580 of Henry king of\r\nPortugal, Philip of Spain had possessed himself of that kingdom as\r\nrightful heir; having compelled don Antonio, an illegitimate nephew of\r\nthe deceased sovereign, who had ventured to dispute the succession, to\r\nquit the country, and take refuge first in France and afterwards in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThis pretender had hitherto received little support or encouragement at\r\nthe hands of Elizabeth; in fact, she had suffered him to languish in the\r\nmost abject poverty; for there is a letter extant from a person about\r\nhim to lord Burleigh[99], entreating that he would move her majesty\r\neither to advance don Antonio two hundred thousand crowns out of her\r\nshare of the rich Portuguese carrack captured by sir Francis Drake, to\r\nenable him to recover his kingdom,--or at least to take upon herself the\r\npayment of his debts, amounting to twelve or thirteen pounds, without\r\nwhich his poor creditors are likely to be ruined. The first part of this\r\nextraordinary alternative the prudent princess certainly declined; what\r\nmight be the fate of the second does not in this place appear: but we\r\nlearn elsewhere, that during the long vacancy of the see of Ely which\r\nthe queen caused to succeed to the death of bishop Cox in 1581, a part\r\nof its revenues were appropriated to the maintenance of this unfortunate\r\ncompetitor for royalty. It was imagined however, by the projectors of\r\nthe present expedition, that the discontent of the Portuguese under the\r\nyoke of Spain would now incline them to receive as a deliverer even this\r\nspurious representative of their ancient race of monarchs; and don\r\nAntonio received an invitation, which he joyfully embraced, to embark\r\nhimself and his fortunes on board the English fleet.\r\n\r\n[Note 99: Strype's Annals, vol. iii. p. 450.]\r\n\r\nThe armament consisted of 180 vessels of all kinds, carrying 21,000 men;\r\nit set sail from Plymouth on April 18th, sir Francis Drake being admiral\r\nand sir John Norris general. The earl of Essex, urged by the romantic\r\ngallantry of his disposition, afterwards joined the expedition with\r\nseveral ships fitted out at his own expense in support of don Antonio's\r\ntitle, though he bore in it no regular command, since he sailed without\r\nthe consent or privity of her majesty. The first landing of the forces\r\nwas at Corunna; where having captured four ships of war in the harbour,\r\nthey took and burned the lower town and made some bold attempts on the\r\nupper, which was strongly fortified: but after defeating with great\r\nslaughter a body of Spaniards who were intrenched in the neighbourhood,\r\nsir John Norris, finding it impracticable to renew his assaults on the\r\nupper town, on account of a general want of powder in the fleet,\r\nre-embarked his men, already suffering from sickness, and made sail for\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nAfter some consultation they landed at Penicha, about thirty miles to\r\nthe north of Lisbon, took the castle; and having thrown into it a\r\ngarrison, every man of which was afterwards put to the sword by the\r\nSpaniards, they began their march for the capital. So ill was the army\r\nprovided, that many died on the road for want of food; and others who\r\nhad fainted with the heat must also have perished, had not Essex, with\r\ncharacteristic generosity, caused all his baggage to be thrown out, and\r\nthe carriages to be filled with the sick and weary. Instead of the\r\ntroops of nobility and gentry by whom don Antonio had flattered himself\r\nand his companions that he should be joined and recognised, there only\r\nappeared upon their march a band of miserable peasants without shoes or\r\nstockings, and one gentleman who presented him with a basket of plums\r\nand cherries. The English however proceeded, and made themselves masters\r\nwithout difficulty of the suburbs of Lisbon, in which they found great\r\nriches; but the entreaties of don Antonio, and his anxiety to preserve\r\nthe good will of the people, caused the general, to restrain his men\r\nfrom plunder. Essex distinguished himself in every skirmish; and,\r\nknocking at the gates of Lisbon itself, challenged the governor, or any\r\nother of equal rank, to single combat: but this romantic proposal was\r\nprudently declined; and though the city was known to be weakly guarded,\r\nthe total want of battering cannon in the English army precluded the\r\ngeneral from making an assault.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Drake, who was to have co-operated with the land forces\r\nby an attack upon the city from the water side, found his progress\r\neffectually barred by the forts at the mouth of the Tagus, and was thus\r\ncompelled to relinquish all share in the enterprise. This\r\ndisappointment, joined to the want of ammunition and other necessaries,\r\nand the rapid progress of sickness among the men, rendered necessary a\r\nspeedy retreat and re-embarkation. About sixty vessels lying at the\r\nmouth of the Tagus, laden with corn and other articles of commerce, were\r\nseized by the English, though the property of the Hanse Towns, and Drake\r\nand Norris in their return burned Vigo: but various disasters overtook\r\nthe fleet on its homeward voyage, subsequently to its dispersion by a\r\nviolent storm. On the whole, it was computed that not less than eleven\r\nthousand persons perished in this unfortunate and ill-planned\r\nexpedition, by which no one important object had been attained; and that\r\nof eleven hundred gentlemen who accompanied it, not more than three\r\nhundred and fifty escaped the united ravages of famine, sickness, and\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\nThe queen, on discovering that Essex had without permission absented\r\nhimself from her court and from the duties of his office of master of\r\nthe horse, to embark in the voyage to Portugal, had instantly\r\ndispatched a peremptory order for his return, enforced by menaces of her\r\nutmost indignation in case of disobedience; but even to this pressing\r\nmandate he had dared to turn a deaf ear. During the four or five months\r\ntherefore of his absence, the whole court had remained in fearful or\r\nexulting anticipation of the thunderbolt about to fall on his devoted\r\nhead. But the laurels with which he had encircled his brows proved his\r\nsafeguard: Elizabeth had listened with a secret complacency to the\r\nreports of his valor and generosity which reached her through various\r\nchannels; her tenderness had been strongly excited by the image of the\r\nperils to which he was daily exposing himself; and her joy at his safe\r\nreturn, too genuine and too lively for concealment, left her so little\r\nof the power or the wish to chide, that his pardon seemed granted even\r\nbefore it could be implored. Essex had too much sensibility not to be\r\ndeeply touched by this affectionate behaviour on the part of his\r\nsovereign; he redoubled his efforts to deserve the oblivion of his past\r\noffence, and with a success so striking, that it was soon evident to all\r\nthat the temerity which might have ruined another had but heightened and\r\nconfirmed his favor.\r\n\r\nEssex possessed, as much as Leicester himself, the art of stimulating\r\nElizabeth in his own behalf to acts of munificence; and she soon\r\nconsoled him by some valuable grants for any anxiety which her\r\nthreatened indignation might have occasioned him, or any disappointment\r\nwhich he might have conceived in seeing sir Christopher Hatton\r\npreferred by her to himself as Leicester's successor in the office of\r\nchancellor of the university of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAmong the gallant adventurers in the cause of don Antonio sir Walter\r\nRaleigh had made one, and he also was received by her majesty on his\r\nreturn with tokens of distinguished favor. But not long after he\r\nembarked for Ireland, in which country he remained without public\r\nemployment till the spring of 1592, when he undertook an expedition\r\nagainst the Spanish settlements in South America.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible purpose of his visit to Ireland was to superintend the\r\nmanagement of those large estates which had been granted him in that\r\ncountry; but it was the story of the day, that \"the earl of Essex had\r\nchased Raleigh from court and confined him into Ireland[100]:\" and the\r\nlength of his absence, with the known enmity between these\r\nrival-favorites, lends some countenance to the suggestion.\r\n\r\n[Note 100: Birch's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nThat Essex, even in the early days of his favor, already assumed the\r\nright of treating as interlopers such as advanced too rapidly in the\r\ngood graces of his sovereign, we learn from an incident which probably\r\noccurred about this time, and is thus related by Naunton. \"My lord\r\nMontjoy, being but newly come to court, and then but sir Charles Blount,\r\nhad the good fortune one day to run very well a tilt; and the queen\r\ntherewith was so well pleased, that she sent him a token of her favor, a\r\nqueen at chess of gold, richly enamelled, which his servants had the\r\nnext day fastened on his arm with a crimson ribbon; which my lord of\r\nEssex, as he passed through the privy chamber, espying, with his cloak\r\ncast under his arm, the better to commend it to the view, enquired what\r\nit was, and for what cause there fixed. Sir Fulk Greville told him that\r\nit was the queen's favor, which the day before, and after the tilting,\r\nshe had sent him: whereat my lord of Essex, in a kind of emulation, and\r\nas though he would have limited her favor, said, 'Now I perceive every\r\nfool must have a favor.'\r\n\r\n\"This bitter and public affront came to sir Charles Blount's ear, who\r\nsent him a challenge, which was accepted by my lord; and they went near\r\nMarybonepark, where my lord was hurt in the thigh and disarmed: the\r\nqueen, missing the men, was very curious to learn the truth; and when at\r\nlast it was whispered out, she swore by God's death, it was fit that\r\nsome one or other should take him down, and teach him better manners,\r\notherwise there would be no rule with him[101].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 101: Fragmenta Regalia.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her majesty's ostentation of displeasure against her\r\nfavorite on this occasion, it is pretty certain that he could not better\r\nhave paid his court to her than by a duel of which, in spite of her\r\nwisdom and her age, she seems to have had the weakness to imagine her\r\npersonal charms the cause. She compelled however the rivals to be\r\nreconciled: from this period all the externals of friendship were\r\npreserved between them; and there is even reason to believe,\r\nnotwithstanding some insinuations to the contrary, that latterly at\r\nleast the sentiment became a genuine one. If the queen had further\r\ninsisted on cementing their reconciliation by an alliance, she would\r\nhave preserved from its only considerable blot the brilliant reputation\r\nof sir Charles Blount. This courtier, whilst he as yet enjoyed no higher\r\nrank than that of knighthood, had conceived an ardent passion for a\r\nsister of the earl of Essex; the same who was once destined to be the\r\nbride of Philip Sidney. She returned his attachment; but her friends,\r\njudging the match inferior to her just pretensions, broke off the affair\r\nand compelled her to give her hand to lord Rich; a man of disagreeable\r\ncharacter, who was the object of her aversion. In such a marriage the\r\nunfortunate lady found it impossible to forget the lover from whom\r\ntyrannical authority had severed her; and some years after, when Montjoy\r\nreturned victorious from the Irish wars, she suffered herself to be\r\nseduced by him into a criminal connexion, which was detected after it\r\nhad subsisted for several years, and occasioned her divorce from lord\r\nRich. Her lover, now earl of Devonshire, regarded himself as bound in\r\nlove and in honor to make her his wife; but to marry a divorced woman in\r\nthe lifetime of her husband was at this time so unusual a proceeding and\r\nregarded as so violent a scandal, that Laud, then chaplain to the earl\r\nof Devonshire, who joined their hands, incurred severe blame, and\r\nthought it necessary to observe the anniversary ever after as a day of\r\nhumiliation. King James, in whose reign the circumstance took place,\r\nlong refused to avail himself further of the services of the earl; and\r\nthe disgrace and vexation of the affair embittered, and some say\r\nabridged, the days of this otherwise admirable person. Whether any\r\nincidents connected with this attachment had a share in producing that\r\nhostile state of feeling in the mind of Essex towards Blount which led\r\nto their combat, remains matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis year the customary festivities on the anniversary of her majesty's\r\naccession were attended by one of those romantic ceremonies which mark\r\nso well the taste of the age and of Elizabeth. This was no other than\r\nthe formal resignation by that veteran of the tilt-yard, sir Henry\r\nLeigh, of the office of queen's champion, so long his glory and delight.\r\nThe gallant earl of Cumberland was his destined successor, and the\r\nmomentous transfer was accomplished after the following fashion.\r\n\r\nHaving first performed their respective parts in the chivalrous\r\nexercises of the band of knights-tilters, sir Henry and the earl\r\npresented themselves to her majesty at the foot of the gallery where she\r\nwas seated, surrounded by her ladies and nobles, to view the games. They\r\nadvanced to slow music, and a concealed performer accompanied the strain\r\nwith the following song.\r\n\r\n    My golden locks time hath to silver turn'd,\r\n    (Oh time too swift, and swiftness never ceasing)\r\n    My youth 'gainst age, and age at' youth hath spurn'd:\r\n    But spurn'd in vain, youth waneth by increasing,\r\n    Beauty, strength, and youth, flowers fading been,\r\n    Duty, faith, and love, are roots and evergreen.\r\n\r\n    My helmet now shall make a hive for bees,\r\n    And lovers songs shall turn to holy psalms;\r\n    A man at arms must now sit on his knees,\r\n    And feed on pray'rs that are old age's alms.\r\n    And so from court to cottage I depart;\r\n    My saint is sure of mine unspotted heart.\r\n\r\n    And when I sadly sit in homely cell,\r\n    I'll teach my swains this carrol for a song:\r\n    \"Blest be the hearts that think my sovereign well,\r\n    Curs'd be the souls that think to do her wrong.\"\r\n    Goddess, vouchsafe this aged man his right,\r\n    To be your beadsman now, that was your knight.\r\n\r\nDuring this performance, there arose out of the earth a pavilion of\r\nwhite taffeta, supported on pillars resembling porphyry and formed to\r\nimitate the temple of the Vestal virgins. A superb altar was placed\r\nwithin it, on which were laid some rich gifts for her majesty. Before\r\nthe gate stood a crowned pillar embraced by an eglantine, to which a\r\nvotive tablet was attached, inscribed \"To Elizabeth:\" The gifts and the\r\ntablet being with great reverence delivered to the queen, and the aged\r\nknight in the meantime disarmed, he offered up his armour at the foot of\r\nthe pillar; then kneeling, presented the earl of Cumberland to her\r\nmajesty, praying her to be pleased to accept of him for her knight and\r\nto continue these annual exercises. The proposal being graciously\r\naccepted, sir Henry armed the earl and mounted him on his horse: this\r\ndone, he clothed himself in a long velvet gown and covered his head, in\r\nlieu of a helmet, with \"a buttoned cap of the country fashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe king of Scots had now for a considerable time deserved extremely\r\nwell of Elizabeth. During the whole period of the Spanish armament he\r\nhad remained unshaken in his attachment to her cause, resolutely turning\r\na deaf ear to the flattering offers of Philip II. with the shrewd\r\nremark, that all the favor he had to expect from this monarch in case of\r\nhis success against England, was that of Polypheme to Ulysses;--to be\r\ndevoured the last. A bon mot which was carefully copied into _The\r\nEnglish Mercury_. The ambassador to Scotland, from an unfounded opinion\r\nthat the discomfited armada sought shelter in the ports of that country\r\nunder the faith of some secret engagement with James, had thought it\r\nnecessary to bribe him to fidelity by some brilliant promises, of which\r\nwhen the danger was past Elizabeth unhandsomely evaded the fulfilment;\r\nbut even on this occasion he abstained from any vehement expressions of\r\nindignation: in short, his whole demeanour towards his lofty kinswoman\r\nwas that of a submissive expectant much more than of a competitor and\r\nrival prince. True it is, that he had begun to attach to himself among\r\nher nobles and courtiers as many adherents as his means permitted; but\r\nbesides that his manoeuvres remained for the most part concealed from\r\nher knowledge, they certainly carried with them no danger to her\r\ngovernment. The partisans of James were not, like those of his mother,\r\nthe adherents also of a religious faction leagued with the foreign\r\npowers most inimical to her rule, and from whose machinations she was\r\nexposed to daily peril of her throne and life. They were protestants and\r\nEnglishmen, and many of them possessed of such strong hereditary\r\ninfluence or official rank, that it could never become their interest to\r\nthrow the country into confusion by ill-timed efforts in favor of the\r\nking of Scots; whose cause they in fact embraced with no other view than\r\nto secure the state from commotion, and themselves from the loss of\r\npower on the event of the queen's demise. The puritan party indeed, by\r\nwhom several attempts were afterwards made in parliament to extort from\r\nthe queen a settlement of the crown in James's favor, were doubtless\r\nactuated in part by discontent with the present church-establishment,\r\nand the hope of seeing it superseded under James by a presbyterian form\r\nresembling that of Scotland. For the present, however, these\r\nreligionists were sufficiently repressed under the iron rod of the\r\nHigh-commission court, and James had entered with them into no regular\r\ncorrespondence, and engaged their attachment by no promises of future\r\nindulgence or support.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, the violent jealousy with which Elizabeth\r\ncontinued to regard this feeble and inoffensive young king, in every\r\npoint so greatly her inferior, must rather be imputed to her narrowness\r\nand malignity of temper than to any dictates of sound policy or\r\nadvisable precaution; and the measures with which it prompted her were\r\nimpressed accordingly with every character of spite and meanness. She\r\nwas peculiarly solicitous to prevent James from increasing his\r\nconsequence by marriage, and through innumerable intrigues with his\r\nministers and favorites she had hitherto succeeded in her object. When\r\nhe appeared to have set his mind on a union with the eldest daughter of\r\nthe king of Denmark, she contrived to interpose so many delays and\r\nobstacles that this sovereign, conceiving himself trifled with, ended\r\nthe affair by giving the princess in marriage to another. To embarrass\r\nmatters still more, she next proposed to James a match with the sister\r\nof the king of Navarre, a princess much older than himself, destitute of\r\nfortune, and whose brother might be influenced to protract the\r\nnegotiation to any length convenient to his valuable ally the queen of\r\nEngland. This proposal being declined by James, and overtures made in\r\nhis name to a younger daughter of the Danish house, she again set her\r\nengines at work to thwart his wishes: but indignation and an amorous\r\nimpatience for once lent to James resolution sufficient to carry his\r\npoint. Disregarding a declaration of his privy-council against the\r\nmatch, he instigated the citizens of Edinburgh to take up arms in his\r\ncause, and finally accomplished the sending out of a splendid embassy,\r\nby which the marriage-articles were speedily settled, and the princess\r\nconducted on board the fleet which was to convey her to Scotland. A\r\nviolent storm having driven her for shelter into a port of Norway, the\r\nyoung monarch carried his gallantry so far as to set sail in quest of\r\nher; and re-conducting her, at the request of the king her father, to\r\nCopenhagen, he there passed the winter in great joy and festivity; and\r\nas soon as the season would permit, conducted his royal consort home in\r\ntriumph, and crowned her with all the magnificence that Scotland could\r\ndisplay. Seeing the turn which matters had taken, Elizabeth now made a\r\nvirtue of necessity, and dispatched a solemn embassy to express to her\r\ngood brother of Scotland her hearty congratulations on his nuptials, and\r\nher satisfaction in his happy return from so adventurous a voyage.\r\n\r\nIn April 1590 died sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary of state,\r\nwhose name is found in such intimate connexion with the whole domestic\r\npolicy of Elizabeth during several eventful years, that his character is\r\nin a manner identified with that of the measures at this period pursued.\r\n\r\nThis eminent person, in his youth an exile for the protestant cause,\r\nretained through life so serious a sense of religion as sometimes to\r\nexpose him to the suspicion of puritanism. In his private capacity he\r\nwas benevolent, friendly, and accounted a man of strict integrity: but\r\nit is right that public characters should principally be estimated by\r\nthat part of their conduct in which the public is concerned; and to\r\nWalsingham as a minister the unsullied reputation of virtue and honor is\r\nnot to be conceded. Unlike that pure and noble patriot who \"would have\r\nlost his life with pleasure to serve his country, but would not have\r\ndone a base thing to save it,\" this statesman seems to have held that\r\nfew base things ought to be scrupled by which his queen and country\r\nmight be served.\r\n\r\nThat Walsingham was of unimpeached fidelity towards his sovereign\r\nrequires no proof; that he was not stimulated by views of private\r\nemolument seems also to be satisfactorily evinced, though somewhat to\r\nthe discredit of his mistress, by the load of debt incurred in his\r\nofficial capacity under the pressure of which he lived and died: but\r\nhere our praise of his public virtue must end. It is impossible to\r\nregard without indignation and disgust the system of artifice and\r\nintrigue which he contrived for the purpose of insnaring the persecuted\r\nand therefore disaffected catholics; and while due credit is given to\r\nhis unwearied diligence and remarkable sagacity in detecting dangerous\r\nconspiracies, it cannot be doubted that the extraordinary encouragements\r\nheld out by him to spies and informers,--those pests of a\r\ncommonwealth,--must in numberless instances have rendered himself the\r\ndupe, and innocent persons the victims, of designing villany. Looking\r\neven to the immediate results of his measures, it may triumphantly be\r\ndemanded by the philanthropist and the sage, whether a system less\r\nartificial, less treacherous and less cruel, would not equally well have\r\nsucceeded in protecting the person of the queen from the machinations of\r\ntraitors, with the further and inestimable advantage of preserving her\r\ngovernment from reproach, and the national character from degradation.\r\n\r\nThat the system of Walsingham was in the main that also of his court and\r\nof his age, is indeed true; and this consideration might in some degree\r\nplead his excuse, did it not appear that there was in his personal\r\ncharacter a native subtilty and talent of insinuation which, aptly\r\nconspiring with the nature of his office, might truly be said to render\r\nhis duty his delight:--a feature of his mind which is thus happily\r\ndelineated by a witty and ingenious writer.\r\n\r\n\"None alive did better ken the secretary's craft, to get counsels out of\r\nothers and keep them in himself. Marvellous his sagacity in examining\r\nsuspected persons, either to make them confess the truth, or confound\r\nthemselves by denying it to their detection. Cunning his hands, who\r\ncould unpick the cabinets in the pope's conclave; quick his ears, who\r\ncould hear at London what was whispered at Rome; and numerous the spies\r\nand eyes of this Argus dispersed in all places.\r\n\r\n\"The Jesuits, being outshot in their own bow, complained that he out\r\nequivocated their equivocation, having a mental reservation deeper and\r\nfurther than theirs. They tax him for making heaven bow too much to\r\nearth, oft-times borrowing a point of conscience with full intent never\r\nto pay it again; whom others excused by reasons of state and dangers of\r\nthe times. Indeed his simulation (which all allow lawful) was as like to\r\ndissimulation (condemned by all good men) as two things could be which\r\nwere not the same. He thought that gold might, but intelligence could\r\nnot, be bought too dear;--the cause that so great a _statesman_ left so\r\nsmall an _estate_, and so _public_ a person was so _privately_ buried in\r\nSt. Pauls[102].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 102: Fuller's Worthies in Kent.]\r\n\r\nThe long state of infirmity which preceded the death of Walsingham, had\r\nafforded abundant opportunity for various intrigues and negotiations\r\nrespecting the appointment of his successor in office. Burleigh hoped to\r\nmake the choice of her majesty fall on his son Robert; Essex was\r\nanxious to decide it in favor of the discarded Davison, who seems to\r\nhave been performing some part of the functions of a secretary of state\r\nduring the illness of Walsingham, though he did not venture to appear in\r\nthe sight of his still-offended mistress. No one was more susceptible of\r\ngenerous emotions than Essex; and it ought not to be doubted that much\r\nof the extraordinary zeal which he manifested, during two or three\r\nentire years, in the cause of this unfortunate and ill-treated man, is\r\nto be ascribed to genuine friendship: but neither must it be concealed\r\nthat this struggle for the nomination of a secretary was in effect the\r\ngreat and decisive trial of strength between himself and the Cecils.\r\nSeveral letters have been printed, written by Essex to Davison and\r\nbearing date between the years 1587 and 1590, from which a few extracts\r\nmay be worth transcribing, both for the excellence of the style and the\r\nlight which they reflect on the behaviour and sentiments of Elizabeth in\r\nthis matter. \"I had speech with her majesty yesternight after my\r\ndeparture from you, and I did find that the success of my speech\r\n(although I hoped for good) yet did much overrun my expectation.... I\r\nmade her majesty see what, in your health, in your fortune, in your\r\nreputation in the world, you had suffered since the time that it was her\r\npleasure to commit you; I told her how many friends and well-wishers the\r\nworld did afford you, and how, for the most part, throughout the whole\r\nrealm her best subjects did wish that she would do herself the honor to\r\nrepair for you and restore to you that state which she had overthrown;\r\nyour humble suffering of these harms and reverend regard to her majesty,\r\nmust needs move a princess so noble and so just, to do you right; and\r\nmore I had said, if my gift of speech had been any way comparable to my\r\nlove. Her majesty, seeing her judgement opened by the story of her own\r\nactions, showed a very feeling compassion of you, she gave you many\r\npraises, and among the rest, that she seemed to please herself in was,\r\nthat you were a man of her own choice. In truth she was so well pleased\r\nwith those things that she spake and heard of you, that I dare (if of\r\nthings future there be any assurance) promise to myself that your peace\r\nwill be made to your content and the desire of your friends, I mean in\r\nher favor and your own fortune, to a better estate than, or at least the\r\nsame you had, which with all my power I will employ myself to effect.\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThat these sanguine hopes were soon checked, appears by the following\r\npassage of a subsequent letter. \"I have, as I could, taken my\r\nopportunity since I saw you to perform as much as I promised you; and\r\nthough in all I have been able to effect nothing, yet even now I have\r\nhad better leisure to solicit the queen than in this stormy time I did\r\nhope for. My beginning was, as being amongst others entreated to move\r\nher in your behalf; my course was, to lay open your sufferings and your\r\npatience; in them you had felt poverty, restraint and disgrace, and yet\r\nyou showed nothing but faith and humility; faith, as being never wearied\r\nnor discouraged to do her service, humbleness, as content to forget all\r\nthe burdens that had been laid upon you, and to serve her majesty with\r\nas frank and willing a heart as they that have received greatest grace\r\nfrom her. To this I received no answer but in general terms, that her\r\nhonor was much touched; your presumption had been intolerable, and that\r\nshe could not let it slip out of her mind. When I urged your access she\r\ndenied it, but so as I had no cause to be afraid to speak again. When I\r\noffered in them both to reply, she fell into other discourse, and so we\r\nparted.\" &c.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Walsingham he writes thus.... \"Upon this unhappy\r\naccident I have tried to the bottom what the queen will do for you, and\r\nwhat the credit of your solicitor is worth. I urged not the comparison\r\nbetween you and any other, but in my duty to her and zeal to her service\r\nI did assure her, that she had not any other in England that would for\r\nthese three or four years know how to settle himself to support so great\r\na burden. She gave me leave to speak, heard me with patience, confessed\r\nwith me that none was so sufficient, and would not deny but that which\r\nshe lays to your charge was done without hope, fear, malice, envy, or\r\nany respects of your own, but merely for her safety both of state and\r\nperson. In the end she absolutely denied to let you have that place and\r\nwilled me to rest satisfied, for she was resolved. Thus much I write to\r\nlet you know, I am more honest to my friends than happy in their cases.\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nAs the fear of giving offence to the king of Scots was one reason or\r\npretext for the implacability of the queen towards Davison, Essex\r\nhazarded the step of writing to request, as a personal favor to\r\nhimself, the forgiveness and good offices of this monarch in behalf of\r\nthe man who bore the blame of his mother's death. Nothing could be more\r\ndexterous than the turn of this letter; but what reception it found we\r\ndo not discover. On the whole, all his efforts were unavailing: the\r\nlonger Elizabeth reflected on the matter, the less she felt herself able\r\nto forgive the _presumption_ of the rash man who had anticipated her\r\nfinal resolution on the fate of Mary. Other considerations probably\r\nconcurred; as, the apprehension which seems to have been of perpetual\r\nrecurrence to her mind, of rendering her young favorite too confident\r\nand presuming by an uniform course of success in his applications to\r\nher; the habitual ascendency of Burleigh; and, probably, some distrust\r\nof the capacity of Davison for so difficult and important a post.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, no principal secretary was at present appointed; but\r\nRobert Cecil was admitted as an assistant to his father, who resumed on\r\nthis condition the duties of the office, and held it, as it were in\r\ntrust, till her majesty, six years afterwards, was pleased to sanction\r\nhis resignation in favor of his son, now fully established in her\r\nconfidence and good opinion. Of Davison nothing further is known;\r\nprobably he did not long survive.\r\n\r\nSome time in the year 1590, the earl of Essex married in a private\r\nmanner the widow of sir Philip Sidney, and daughter of Walsingham; a\r\nstep with which her majesty did not scruple to show herself highly\r\noffended. The inferiority of the connexion in the two articles of birth\r\nand fortune to the just pretensions of the earl, and the circumstance\r\nthat the union had been formed without that previous consultation of her\r\ngracious pleasure,--which from her high nobility and favorite courtiers,\r\nand especially from those who, like Essex and his lady, shared the honor\r\nof her relationship, she expected as a homage and almost claimed as a\r\nright,--were the ostensible grounds of her displeasure. But that\r\npeculiar compound of ungenerous feelings which rendered her the\r\nuniversal foe of matrimony, exalted on this occasion by a jealousy too\r\nhumiliating to be owned, but too powerful to be repressed, formed\r\nwithout doubt the more genuine sources of her deep chagrin. The\r\ncourtiers quickly penetrated the secret of her heart;--for what vice,\r\nwhat weakness, can long lurk unsuspected in a royal bosom? and it is\r\nthus that John Stanhope, one of her attendants, ventures to write on the\r\nsubject to lord Talbot.\r\n\r\n\"This night, God willing, she will to Richmond, and on Saturday next to\r\nSomerset-house, and if she could overcome her passion against my lord of\r\nEssex for his marriage, no doubt she would be much quieter; yet doth she\r\nuse it more temperately than was thought for, and, God be thanked, doth\r\nnot strike all that she threats[103]. The earl doth use it with good\r\ntemper, concealing his marriage as much as so open a matter may be: not\r\nthat he denies it to any, but for her majesty's better satisfaction, is\r\npleased that my lady shall live very retired in her mother's\r\nhouse.[104]\"\r\n\r\n[Note 103: It may be regarded as dubious whether this expression is\r\nto be understood literally or metaphorically.]\r\n\r\n[Note 104: \"Illustrations\" by Lodge.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the indignation of the queen against Essex stopped very\r\nshort of the rage with which she had been transported against Leicester\r\non a similar occasion; she never even talked of sending him to prison\r\nfor his marriage. Her good sense came to her assistance somewhat indeed\r\ntoo late for her own dignity, but soon enough to intercept any serious\r\nmischief to the earl; and having found leisure to reflect on the folly\r\nand disgrace of openly maintaining an ineffectual resentment, she soon\r\nafter readmitted the offender to the same station of seeming favor as\r\nbefore. There has appeared however some ground to suspect that the queen\r\nnever entirely dismissed her feelings of mortification; or again reposed\r\nin Essex the same unbounded confidence with which she had once honored\r\nhim. From a passage of a letter addressed by lord Buckhurst to sir\r\nRobert Sidney, then governor of the Brill, we learn, that in the autumn\r\nof the next year she still retained such displeasure against sir Robert\r\nfor having been present at a banquet given by Essex, either on occasion\r\nof his marriage, or with a view to the furtherance of some design of his\r\nwhich excited her suspicion, that she could not be induced to grant him\r\nleave of absence for a visit to England.\r\n\r\nBut cares and occupations of a nature peculiarly uncongenial with the\r\nindulgence of sentimental sorrows, now claimed, and not in vain, the\r\nserious thoughts of this prudent and vigilant princess. The low state\r\nof her finances, exhausted by no wasteful prodigalities, but by the\r\nnecessary measures of national defence and the politic aid which she had\r\nextended to the United Provinces and to the French Hugonots, now\r\nthreatened to place her in a painful dilemma. She must either desert her\r\nallies, and suffer her navy to relapse into the dangerous state of\r\nweakness from which she had exerted all her efforts to raise it, or\r\nsummon a new parliament for the purpose of making fresh demands upon the\r\npurses of her people; and this at the risk either of shaking their\r\nattachment, or,--a humiliation not to be endured,--seeing herself\r\ncompelled to sacrifice to the importunities of the popular members some\r\nof the more oppressive branches of her prerogative; the right of\r\npurveyance for instance, or that of granting monopolies; both of which\r\nshe had suffered to grow into enormous grievances. Mature reflection\r\ndiscovered to her, however, a third alternative; that of practising a\r\nstill stricter oeconomy on one hand, and on the other, of increasing\r\nthe productiveness to the exchequer of the customs and other branches of\r\nrevenue, by reforming abuses, by detecting frauds and embezzlements, and\r\nby cutting off the exorbitant profits of collectors.\r\n\r\nThis last plan, which best accorded with her disposition, was that\r\nadopted by Elizabeth. It may be mentioned as a characteristic trait,\r\nthat a few years before, she had accepted with thanks an offer secretly\r\nmade to herself by some person holding an inferior station in the\r\ncustoms, of a full disclosure of the impositions practised upon her in\r\nthat department. She had admitted this voluntary informer several times\r\nto her presence; had imposed silence in the tone of a mistress on the\r\nremonstrances of Leicester, Burleigh, and Walsingham, who indignantly\r\nurged that he was not of a rank to be thus countenanced in accusation of\r\nhis superiors; and had reaped the reward of this judicious patronage, by\r\nfinding herself entitled to demand from her farmer of the customs an\r\nannual rent of forty-two thousand pounds, instead of the twelve thousand\r\npounds which he had formerly paid. She now exacted from him a further\r\nadvance of eight thousand pounds per annum; and stimulated Burleigh to\r\nsuch a rigid superintendence of all the details of public oeconomy as\r\nproduced a very important general result. It was probably in the ensuing\r\nparliament that a conference being held between the two houses\r\nrespecting a bill for making the patrimonial estates of accountants\r\nliable for their arrears to the queen, and the commons desiring that it\r\nmight not be retrospective, the lord treasurer pithily said; \"My lords,\r\nif you had lost your purse by the way, would you look back or forwards\r\nto find it? The queen hath lost her purse.\"\r\n\r\nThis rigid parsimony, at once the virtue and the foible of Elizabeth,\r\nwas attended accordingly with its good and its evil. It endeared her to\r\nthe people, whom it protected from the imposition of new and oppressive\r\ntaxes; but, being united in the complex character of this remarkable\r\nwoman with an extraordinary taste for magnificence in all that related\r\nto her personal appearance, it betrayed her into a thousand meannesses,\r\nwhich, in spite of all the arts of graciousness in which she was an\r\nadept, served to alienate the affections of such as more nearly\r\napproached her. Her nobles found themselves heavily burthened by the\r\nlong and frequent visits which she paid them at their country-seats,\r\nattended always by an enormous retinue; as well as by the contributions\r\nto her jewelry and wardrobe which custom required of them under the name\r\nof new year's gifts, and on all occasions when they had favors, or even\r\njustice, to ask at her hands[105]. There were few of the inferior\r\nsuitors and court-attendants composing the crowd by which she had a\r\nvanity in seeing herself constantly surrounded, who did not find cause\r\nbitterly to rue the day when first her hollow smiles and flattering\r\nspeeches seduced them to long years of irksome, servile, and often\r\nprofitless assiduity.\r\n\r\n[Note 105: Lists of the New Year's Gifts received by Elizabeth\r\nduring many years have more than once appeared in print. They show that\r\nnot only jewels, trinkets, rich robes, and every ornamental article of\r\ndress, were abundantly supplied to her from this source, but that sets\r\nof body linen worked with black silk round the bosom and sleeves, were\r\nregarded as no inappropriate offering from peers of the realm to the\r\nmaiden-queen. The presents of the bishops and of some of the nobility\r\nalways consisted of gold pieces, to the value of from five to twenty or\r\nthirty pounds, contained in embroidered silk purses. Her majesty\r\ndistributed at the same season pieces of gilt plate; but not always to\r\nthe same persons from whom she had received presents, nor, apparently,\r\nto an equal amount.]\r\n\r\nBacon in his Apophthegms relates on this subject the following anecdote.\r\n\"Queen Elizabeth, seeing sir Edward---- in her garden, looked out at\r\nher window and asked him, in Italian, 'What does a man think of when he\r\nthinks of nothing?' Sir Edward, who had not had the effect of some of\r\nthe queen's grants so soon as he had hoped and desired, paused a little,\r\nand then made answer; 'Madam, he thinks of a woman's promise.' The queen\r\nshrunk in her head, but was heard to say; 'Well, sir Edward, I must not\r\nconfute you: Anger makes dull men witty, but it keeps them poor.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Queen Elizabeth,\" says the same author, \"was dilatory enough in suits\r\nof her own nature; and the lord treasurer Burleigh, being a wise man,\r\nand willing therein to feed her humor, would say to her; 'Madam, you do\r\nwell to let suitors stay; for I shall tell you, _Bis dat qui cito dat_;\r\nif you grant them speedily, they will come again the sooner.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the popular story of this minister's intercepting\r\nthe very moderate bounty which her majesty had proposed to herself the\r\nhonor of bestowing on Spenser, is untrue with respect to this great\r\npoet; since the four lines relating to the circumstance,\r\n\r\n    \"Madam,\r\n    You bid your treasurer on a time\r\n    To give me reason for my rhime,\r\n    But from that time and that season\r\n    I have had nor rhyme nor reason,\"\r\n\r\nlong attributed to Spenser, are now known to be Churchyard's. Yet that\r\nthe author of the _Faery Queen_ had similar injuries to endure, is\r\nmanifest from those lines of unrivalled energy in which the poet, from\r\nthe bitterness of his soul, describes the miseries of a profitless\r\ncourt-attendance. Few readers will have forgotten a passage so\r\ncelebrated; but it will here be read with peculiar interest, as\r\nillustrative of the character of Elizabeth and the sufferings of her\r\nunfortunate courtiers.\r\n\r\n    \"Full little knowest thou that hast not tried\r\n    What hell it is in suing long to bide;\r\n    To lose good days that might be better spent;\r\n    To waste long nights in pensive discontent;\r\n    To speed today, to be put back tomorrow;\r\n    To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow;\r\n    To have thy prince's grace, yet want her peers;\r\n    To have thy asking, yet wait many years;\r\n    To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares;\r\n    To eat thy heart through comfortless despairs;\r\n    To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run;\r\n    To spend, to give, to want, to be undone.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mother Hubbard's Tale._\r\n\r\nOne of the most laudable objects of the parsimony exercised by Elizabeth\r\nat this period was that of enabling herself to afford effectual aid to\r\nHenry IV. of France, now struggling, with adverse fortune but invincible\r\nresolution, to conquer from the united armies of Spain and the League\r\nthe throne which was his birthright. In the depth of his distress, just\r\nwhen his Swiss and German auxiliaries were on the point of disbanding\r\nthemselves for want of pay, the friendship of Elizabeth came in aid of\r\nhis necessities with a supply of twenty-two thousand pounds; a sum,\r\ntrifling as it may seem in modern estimation, which sufficed to rescue\r\nHenry from his immediate embarrassment, and which he frankly avowed to\r\nbe the largest he had ever seen. The generosity of his ally did not stop\r\nhere; for she speedily equipped a body of four thousand men and sent\r\nthem to join him at Dieppe under command of the gallant lord Willoughby.\r\nBy this reinforcement Henry was enabled to march to Paris and possess\r\nhimself of its suburbs, and subsequently to engage in several other\r\nenterprises, in which he gratefully acknowledged the eminent service\r\nrendered him by the valor and fidelity of this band of English.\r\n\r\nThe next year Elizabeth, alarmed at seeing several of the ports of\r\nBretagne opposite to her own shores garrisoned by Spanish troops, whom\r\nthe Leaguers had called in to their assistance, readily entered into a\r\nnew treaty with Henry, by virtue of which she sent a fresh supply of\r\nthree thousand men to assist him in the recovery of this province. Her\r\nexpenses however were to be repaid by the king after the expulsion of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nSir John Norris, the appointed leader of this force, ranked among the\r\nmost eminent of Elizabeth's captains; and was also possessed of some\r\nhereditary claims to her regard, which she did not fail to acknowledge\r\nas far as the jealousy of her favorites would give her leave. One of sir\r\nJohn's grandfathers was that Norris who suffered in the cause of Anne\r\nBoleyn; the other was lord Williams of Tame, to whom she had herself\r\nbeen indebted for so much respectful attention in the days of her\r\ngreatest adversity. She had called up his father to the house of peers,\r\nas lord Norris of Ricot; and his mother she constantly addressed by a\r\nsingular term of endearment, \"My own Crow.\" This pair had six sons, of\r\nwhom sir John was the eldest;--all, it is said, brave men, addicted to\r\narms, and much respected by her majesty. But an unfortunate quarrel with\r\nthe four sons of sir Francis Knolles, their Oxfordshire neighbour,\r\narising out of a tournament in which the two brotherhoods were opposed\r\nto each other, procured to the Norrises the lasting enmity of this\r\nfamily, which, strong both by its relationship to the queen and its\r\nclose alliance with Leicester, was able to impede their advancement to\r\nstations equal to their merits.\r\n\r\nSir John Norris learned the rudiments of military science under the\r\ncelebrated admiral Coligni, to whom in his early youth he acted as a\r\npage; and he enlarged his experience as captain of the English\r\nvolunteers who in 1578 generously carried the assistance of their swords\r\nto the oppressed Netherlanders when they had rushed to arms in the\r\nsacred cause of liberty and conscience. This gallant band particularly\r\nsignalized its valor in the repulse of an assault made by don John of\r\nAustria upon the Dutch camp; a hot action in which Norris had three\r\nhorses shot under him. In 1588 he was a distinguished member of the\r\ncouncil of war. The expedition to Portugal in which he commanded has\r\nbeen already related, and its ill-success was certainly imputable to no\r\nwant of courage or conduct on his part. In the war of Bretagne he gained\r\nhigh praise by a skilful retreat, in which he drew off his small band of\r\nEnglish safe and entire amid a host of foes. We shall afterwards hear\r\nof him in a high command in Ireland.\r\n\r\nMilitary glory was the darling object of the ambition of Essex; and\r\njealous perhaps of the fame which sir John Norris was acquiring in the\r\nFrench wars, he prevailed upon the queen to grant him the command of a\r\nfresh body of troops destined to assist Henry in expelling the Leaguers\r\nfrom Normandy. The new general was deeply mortified at being obliged to\r\nremain for some time inactive at Dieppe, while the French king was\r\ncarrying his arms into another quarter, whither Essex was restrained by\r\nthe positive commands of his sovereign from following him. At length\r\nthey formed in concert the siege of Rouen; but when the town was nearly\r\nreduced to extremity, an unexpected march of the duke of Parma compelled\r\nHenry to desert the enterprise. Elizabeth made it a subject of complaint\r\nagainst her ally, that the English soldiers were always thrust foremost\r\non every occasion of danger; but by themselves this perilous preeminence\r\nwas claimed as a privilege due to the brilliancy of their valor; and\r\ntheir leader, delighted with the spirit which they displayed, encouraged\r\nand rewarded it by distributing among his officers, with a profusion\r\nwhich highly offended his sovereign, the honor of knighthood, bestowed\r\nby herself with so much selection and reserve. Essex supported his\r\ncharacter for personal courage, and indulged his impetuous temper, by\r\nsending an idle challenge to the governor of Rouen, who seems to have\r\nknown his duty too well to accept it; but his sanguine anticipations of\r\nsome distinguished success were baffled by a want of correspondence\r\nbetween the plans of Henry and the commands of Elizabeth; perhaps also\r\nin some degree by his own deficiency in the skill of a general. He had\r\nthe further grief to lose by a musket-shot his only brother Walter\r\nDevereux, a young man of great hopes to whom he was fondly attached; and\r\nleaving his men before Rouen, under the conduct of sir Roger Williams, a\r\nbrave soldier, he returned with little glory in the beginning of 1592 to\r\nsoothe the displeasure of the queen and combat the malicious suggestions\r\nof his enemies. In this bloodless warfare better success awaited him.\r\nHis partial mistress received with favor his excuses; and not only\r\nrestored him to her wonted grace, but soon after testified her opinion\r\nof his abilities by granting him admission into the privy-council.\r\n\r\nThe royal progress of this year in Sussex and Hampshire affords some\r\ncircumstances worthy of mention. Viscount Montacute, (now written\r\nMontagu,) a nobleman in much esteem with Elizabeth, though a zealous\r\ncatholic, solicited the honor of entertaining her at his seat of Coudray\r\nnear Midhurst; a mansion splendid enough to attract the curiosity and\r\nadmiration of a royal visitant. The manor of Midhurst, in which Coudray\r\nis situated, had belonged during several ages to a branch of the potent\r\nfamily of Bohun; thence it passed into possession of the Nevils, a race\r\nsecond to none in England in the antiquity of its nobility and the\r\nsplendor of its alliances. It thus became a part of the vast inheritance\r\nof Margaret countess of Salisbury, daughter of George duke of Clarence.\r\nCoudray-house was the principal residence of this illustrious and\r\ninjured lady, and it was here that the discovery took place of those\r\npapal bulls and emblematical banners which afforded a pretext to malice\r\nand rapacity to arm themselves against the miserable remnant of her\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBy the attainder of the countess, this with the rest of her estates\r\nbecame forfeited to the crown; but the tyrant Henry was prevailed upon\r\nto regrant it, in exchange for other lands, to the heirs of her\r\ngreat-uncle John Nevil marquis Montagu. From an heir female of this\r\nbranch viscount Montagu, son of sir Anthony Brown master of the horse to\r\nHenry VIII., derived it and his title, conferred by queen Mary. But to\r\nthe ancient mansion there had previously been substituted by his\r\nhalf-brother the earl of Southampton, a costly structure decorated\r\ninternally with that profusion of homely art which displayed the wealth\r\nand satisfied the taste of a courtier of Henry VIII. The building was as\r\nusual quadrangular, with a great gate flanked by two towers in the\r\ncentre of the principal front. At the upper end of the hall stood a\r\nbuck, as large as life, carved in brown wood, bearing on his shoulder\r\nthe shield of England and under it that of Brown with, many quarterings:\r\nten other bucks, in various attitudes and of the size of life, were\r\nplanted at intervals. There was a parlour more elegantly adorned with\r\nthe works of Holbein and his scholars;--a chapel richly furnished;--a\r\nlong gallery painted with the twelve apostles;--and a corresponding one\r\nhung with family pictures and with various old paintings on subjects\r\nreligious and military, brought from Battle Abbey, the spoils of which\r\nhad been assigned to sir Anthony Brown as that share of the general\r\nplunder of the monasteries to which his long and faithful service had\r\nentitled him from the bounty of his master.\r\n\r\nAmongst other particulars of the visit of her majesty at Coudray, we are\r\ntold that on the morning after her arrival she rode in the park, where\r\n\"a delicate bower\" was prepared, and a nymph with a sweet song delivered\r\nher a cross-bow to shoot at the deer, of which she killed three or four\r\nand the countess of Kildare one:--it may be added, that this was a kind\r\nof amusement not unfrequently shared by the ladies of that age; an\r\nadditional trait of the barbarity of manners.\r\n\r\nViscount Montagu died two years after this visit, and, to complete his\r\nstory, lies buried in Midhurst church under a splendid monument of\r\nmany-colored marbles, on which may still be seen a figure representing\r\nhim kneeling before an altar, in fine gilt armour, with a cloak and\r\n\"beard of formal cut.\" Beneath are placed recumbent effigies of his two\r\nwives dressed in rich cloaks and ruffs, with chained unicorns at their\r\nfeet, and the whole is surrounded with sculptured scutcheons laboriously\r\nexecuted with innumerable quarterings.\r\n\r\nAt Elvetham in Hampshire the queen was sumptuously entertained during a\r\nvisit of four days by the earl of Hertford. This nobleman was reputed to\r\nbe master of more ready money than any other person in the kingdom; and\r\nthough the cruel imprisonment of nine years, by which Elizabeth had\r\ndoomed him to expiate the offence of a clandestine union with the\r\nblood-royal, could scarcely have been obliterated from his indignant\r\nmemory, certain considerations respecting the interests of his children\r\nmight probably render him not unwilling to gratify her by a splendid act\r\nof homage, though peculiar circumstances increased beyond measure the\r\nexpense and inconvenience of her present visit. Elvetham, which was\r\nlittle more than a hunting-seat, was far from possessing sufficient\r\naccommodation for the court, and the earl was obliged to supply its\r\ndeficiencies by very extensive erections of timber, fitted up and\r\nfurnished with all the elegance that circumstances would permit. He\r\nlikewise found it necessary to cause a large pond to be dug, in which\r\nwere formed three islands, artificially constructed in the likeness of a\r\nfort, a ship, and a mount, for the exhibition of fireworks and other\r\nsplendid pageantries. The water was made to swarm with swimming and\r\nwading sea-gods, who blew trumpets instead of shells, and recited verses\r\nin praise of her majesty: finally, a tremendous battle was enacted\r\nbetween the Tritons of the pond and certain sylvan deities of the park,\r\nwhich was long and valiantly disputed, with darts on one side and large\r\nsquirts on the other, and suddenly terminated, to the delight of all\r\nbeholders, by the seizure and submersion of old Sylvanus himself.\r\n\r\nElizabeth quitted Elvetham so highly gratified by the attentions of the\r\nnoble owner, that she made him a voluntary promise of her special favor\r\nand protection; but we shall find hereafter, that her long-enduring\r\ndispleasure against him relative to his first marriage was not yet so\r\nentirely laid aside but that a slight pretext was sufficient to bring it\r\nonce more into malignant activity.\r\n\r\nEarly in the same summer the queen had also paid a visit to lord\r\nBurleigh at his favorite seat in Hertfordshire, of which sir Thomas\r\nWylks thus speaks in a letter to sir Robert Sidney:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you have heard of her majesty's great entertainment at\r\nTheobalds', of her knighting Mr. Robert Cecil, and of the expectation of\r\nhis advancement to the secretaryship; but so it is as we say in court,\r\nthat the knighthood must serve for both[106].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 106: \"Sidney Papers.\"]\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Hatton died in the latter end of the year 1591. It\r\nappears that he had been languishing for a considerable time under a\r\nmortal disease; yet the vulgar appetite for the wonderful and the\r\ntragical occasioned it to be reported that he died of a broken heart, in\r\nconsequence of her majesty's having demanded of him, with a rigor which\r\nhe had not anticipated, the payment of certain moneys received by him\r\nfor tenths and first fruits: it was added, that struck with compunction\r\non learning to what extremity her severity had reduced him, her majesty\r\nhad paid him several visits, and endeavoured by her gracious and\r\nsoothing speeches to revive his failing spirits;--but that the blow was\r\nstruck, and her repentance came too late. It is indeed certain that the\r\nqueen manifested great interest in the fate of her chancellor, and paid\r\nhim during his last illness very extraordinary personal attentions:--but\r\nit ought to be mentioned, in refutation of the former part of the story,\r\nthat she remitted to his nephew and heir, who was married to a\r\ngrand-daughter of Burleigh's, all her claims on the property which he\r\nleft behind him.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime, also, Hatton seems to have tasted more largely than\r\nmost of his competitors of the solid fruits of royal favor. Elizabeth\r\npersevered in the practice originating in the reigns of her father and\r\nbrother, of endowing her courtiers out of the spoils of the church.\r\nSometimes, to the public scandal, she would keep a bishopric many years\r\nvacant for the sake of appropriating its whole revenues to secular uses\r\nand persons; and still more frequently, the presentation to a see was\r\ngiven under the condition, express or implied, that certain manors\r\nshould be detached from its possessions, or beneficial leases of lands\r\nand tenements granted to particular persons. Thus the bishop of Ely was\r\nrequired to make a cession to sir Christopher Hatton of the garden and\r\norchard of Ely-house near Holborn; on the refusal of the prelate to\r\nsurrender property which he regarded himself as bound in honor and\r\nconscience to transmit unimpaired to his successors, Hatton instituted\r\nagainst him a chancery suit; and having at length succeeded in wresting\r\nfrom him the land, made it the site of a splendid house surrounded by\r\ngardens, which have been succeeded by the street still bearing his name.\r\nHe had even sufficient interest with her majesty to cause her to\r\naddress to the bishop the following violent letter, several times, with\r\nsome variations, reprinted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Proud prelate;\r\n\r\n\"I understand you are backward in complying with your agreement; but I\r\nwould have you to know, that I who made you what you are can unmake you;\r\nand if you do not forthwith fulfil your engagement, by God I will\r\nimmediately unfrock you.\r\n\r\n\"Yours as you demean yourself,\r\n\r\n\"ELIZABETH.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir John Harrington, in his Brief View of the Church of England, accuses\r\nthe lord-chancellor Hatton of coveting likewise a certain manor attached\r\nto the see of Bath and Wells, and of inflaming the queen's indignation\r\nagainst bishop Godwin on account of his second marriage, in order to\r\nfrighten him into compliance; a manoeuvre which in part succeeded,\r\nsince the bishop was reduced, by way of compromise, to grant him a long\r\nlease of another manor somewhat inferior in value.\r\n\r\nWith all this, Hatton, as we have formerly observed, was distinguished\r\nas the patron of the established church against the puritans: but his\r\nzeal in its behalf, whether real or affected, was attended by a spirit\r\nof moderation then rare and always commendable. He disliked, and\r\nsometimes checked, the oppressions exercised against the papists by the\r\nrigid enforcement of recent statutes; and he is reported to have held\r\nthe doctrine, at that time a novel one, that neither fire nor steel\r\nought ever to be employed on a religious account.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor, besides his other merits and accomplishments, was a\r\ncultivator of the drama. In 1568 a tragedy was performed before her\r\nmajesty, and afterwards published, entitled Tancred and Gismund, or\r\nGismonde of Salerne, the joint performance of five students of the\r\nTemple, who appear each to have taken an act; the fourth bears the\r\nsignature of Hatton. It is also probable that he gave the queen some\r\nassistance in similar pursuits, as her translation of a part of the\r\ntragedy of Hercules Oetaeus, preserved in the Bodleian, is in his\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nBut it was never forgotten by others, nor apparently by himself, that he\r\nwas brought into notice by his dancing; and we learn from a contemporary\r\nletter-writer, that even after he had attained the dignity of lord\r\nchancellor he laid aside his gown to dance at the wedding of his nephew.\r\nThe circumstance is pleasantly alluded to by Gray in the description of\r\nStoke-Pogeis house with which his \"Long Story\" opens.\r\n\r\n    \"In Britain's isle, no matter where,\r\n    An ancient pile of building stands;\r\n    The Huntingdons and Hattons there\r\n    Employed the power of fairy hands\r\n\r\n    To raise the ceiling's fretted height,\r\n    Each pannel in achievements clothing,\r\n    Rich windows that exclude the light,\r\n    And passages that lead to nothing.\r\n\r\n    Full oft within the spacious walls,\r\n    When he had fifty winters o'er him,\r\n    My grave lord keeper led the brawls,\r\n    The seal and maces danced before him.\r\n\r\n    His bushy beard and shoe-strings green,\r\n    His high-crown'd hat and satin doublet,\r\n    Moved the stout heart of England's queen,\r\n    Though pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.\"\r\n\r\nAs chancellor of Oxford, Hatton was succeeded by lord Buckhurst, to the\r\nfresh mortification of Essex, who again advanced pretensions to this\r\nhonorary office, and was a second time baffled by her majesty's open\r\ninterference in behalf of his competitor.\r\n\r\nThe more important post of lord chancellor remained vacant for some\r\nmonths, the seals being put in commission; after which serjeant\r\nPickering was appointed lord keeper,--a person of respectable character,\r\nwho appears to have performed the duties of his office without taking\r\nany conspicuous part in the court factions, or exercising any marked\r\ninfluence over the general administration of affairs.\r\n\r\nTowards one person of considerable note in his day, sir John Perrot,\r\nsome time deputy of Ireland, Hatton is reported to have acted the part\r\nof an industrious and contriving enemy; being provoked by the taunts\r\nwhich sir John was continually throwing out against him as one who \"had\r\nentered the court in a galliard,\" and further instigated by the\r\ncomplaints, well or ill founded, against the deputy, of some of his\r\nparticular friends and adherents.\r\n\r\nSir John Perrot derived from a considerable family of that name seated\r\nat Haroldstone in Pembrokeshire, his name and large estates; but his\r\nfeatures, his figure, his air, and common fame, gave him king Henry\r\nVIII. for a father. Nor was his resemblance to this redoubted monarch\r\nmerely external; his temper was haughty and violent, his behaviour\r\n_blustering_, his language always coarse, and, in the fits of rage to\r\nwhich he was subject, abusive to excess. Yet was he destitute neither of\r\nmerit nor abilities. As president of Munster, he had rendered great\r\nservices to her majesty in 1572 by his vigorous conduct against the\r\nrebels. As lord deputy of Ireland between the years 1584 and 1588, he\r\nhad made efforts still more praiseworthy towards the pacification of\r\nthat unhappy and ill-governed country, by checking as much as possible\r\nthe oppressions of every kind exercised by the English of the pale\r\nagainst the miserable natives, towards whom his policy was liberal and\r\nbenevolent. But his attempts at reformation armed against him, as usual,\r\na host of foes, amongst whom was particularly distinguished Loftus\r\narchbishop of Dublin, whom he had exasperated by proposing to apply the\r\nrevenues of St. Patrick's cathedral to the foundation of an university\r\nin the capital of Ireland. Forged letters were amongst the means to\r\nwhich the unprincipled malice of his adversaries resorted for his\r\ndestruction. One of these atrocious fabrications, in which an Irish\r\nchieftain was made to complain of excessive injustice on the part of the\r\ndeputy, was detected by the exertions of the supposed writer, whom\r\nPerrot had in reality attached to himself by many benefits; but a second\r\nletter, which contained a protection to a catholic priest and made him\r\nemploy the words _our_ castle of Dublin, _our_ kingdom of Ireland,\r\nproduced a fatally strong impression on the jealous mind of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMeantime the ill-fated deputy, conscious of his own fidelity and\r\nessential loyalty, and unsuspicious of the snares spread around him, was\r\noften unguarded enough to give vent in gross and furious invective\r\nagainst the person of majesty itself, to the profound vexation which he,\r\nin common with all preceding and following governors of Ireland under\r\nElizabeth, was destined to endure from the penury of her supplies and\r\nthe magnitude of her requisitions. His words were all carried to the\r\nqueen, mingled with such artful insinuations as served to impart to\r\nthese unmeaning ebullitions of a hasty temper the air of deliberate\r\ncontempt and meditated disloyalty towards his sovereign.\r\n\r\nJust before the sailing of the armada, Perrot was recalled, partly\r\nindeed at his own request. A rigid or rather a malicious inquiry was\r\nthen instituted into all the details of his actions, words and behaviour\r\nin Ireland, and he was committed to the friendly custody of lord\r\nBurleigh. Afterwards, the lords Hunsdon and Buckhurst, with two or three\r\nother councillors, were ordered to search and seize his papers in the\r\nhouse of the lord treasurer without the participation of this great\r\nminister, who was at once offended and alarmed at the step. Perrot was\r\ncarried to the Tower, and at length, in April 1592, put upon his trial\r\nfor high treason. The principal heads of accusation were;--his\r\ncontemptuous words of the queen;--his secret encouragement of O'Rourk's\r\nrebellion and the Spanish invasion, and his favoring of traitors. Of all\r\nthese charges except the first he seems to have proved his innocence,\r\nand on this he excused himself by the heat of his temper and the absence\r\nof all ill intention from his mind. He was however found guilty by a\r\njury much more studious of the reputation of loyalty than careful of the\r\nrights of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the bar, he is reported to have exclaimed, \"God's death! will\r\nthe queen suffer her brother to be offered up as a sacrifice to the envy\r\nof my frisking adversaries!\"\r\n\r\nThe queen felt the force of this appeal to the ties of blood. It was\r\nlong before she could be brought to confirm his sentence, and she would\r\nnever sign a warrant for its execution. Burleigh shed tears on hearing\r\nthe verdict, saying with a sigh, that hatred was always the more\r\ninveterate the less it was deserved.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, when her first emotions of anger had passed away, was now\r\nfrequently heard to praise that rescript of the emperor Theodosius in\r\nwhich it is thus written:--\r\n\r\n\"Should any one have spoken evil of the emperor, if through levity, it\r\nshould be despised; if through insanity, pitied; if through malice,\r\nforgiven.\" She is likewise said, in language more familiar to her, to\r\nhave sworn a great oath that they who accused Perrot were all knaves,\r\nand he an honest and faithful man. It was accordingly presumed that she\r\nentertained the design of extending to him the royal pardon; but her\r\nmercy, if such it merits to be called, was tardy; and in September 1592,\r\nsix months after his condemnation, this victim of malice perished in the\r\nTower, of disease, according to Camden; but, by other accounts, of a\r\nbroken heart. In either case the story is an affecting one, and worthy\r\nto be had in lasting remembrance, as a striking and terrible example of\r\nthe potency of court-intrigue, and the guilty subserviency of judicial\r\ntribunals under the jealous rule of the last of the Tudors.\r\n\r\nEnglish literature, under the auspices of Elizabeth and her learned\r\ncourt, had been advancing with a steady and rapid progress; and it may\r\nbe interesting to contemplate the state of one of its fairest provinces\r\nas exhibited by the pen of an able critic, who in the year 1589 gave to\r\nthe world an Art of English Poesy. This work, though addressed to the\r\nqueen, was published with a dedication by the printer to lord Burleigh;\r\nfor the author thought proper to remain concealed: on its first\r\nappearance its merit caused it to be ascribed to Spenser by some, and by\r\nothers to Sidney; but it was traced at length to Puttenham, one of her\r\nmajesty's gentleman-pensioners, the author of some adulatory poems\r\naddressed to her and called Partheniads, and of various other pieces now\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe subject is here methodically treated in three books; the first, \"Of\r\nPoets and Poesy;\" the second, \"Of Proportion;\" the third, \"Of Ornament.\"\r\nAfter some remarks on the origin of the art and its earliest professors,\r\nand an account of the various kinds of poems known to the ancients,--in\r\nwhich there is an absence of pedantry, of quaintness, and of every\r\nspecies of puerility, very rare among the didactic writers of the\r\nage,--the critic proceeds to an enumeration of our principal vernacular\r\npoets, or \"_vulgar makers_,\" as he is pleased to anglicize the words.\r\nBeginning with a just tribute to Chaucer, as the father of genuine\r\nEnglish verse, he passes rapidly to the latter end of the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., when, as he observes, there \"sprung up a new company of courtly\r\nmakers, of whom sir Thomas Wyat the elder and Henry earl of Surry were\r\nthe two chieftains; who having travelled into Italy, and there tasted\r\nthe sweet and stately measures and style of the Italian poesy, as\r\nnovices newly crept out of the schools of Dante, Arioste, and Petrarch,\r\nthey greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesy, from\r\nthat it had been before, and for that cause may justly be said the first\r\nreformers of our English metre and style[107].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 107: I have quoted this passage partly for the sake of the\r\nexpress and authentic testimony which it bears to the fact of Surry's\r\nhaving visited Italy, which Mr. Chalmers and after him Dr. Nott, in\r\ntheir respective biographies of the noble poet, have been induced to\r\ncall in question.]\r\n\r\nAfter slight notice of the minor poets, who flourished under Edward VI.\r\nand Mary, he goes on to observe that \"in her majesty's time that now is,\r\nare sprung up another crew of courtly makers, noblemen and gentlemen of\r\nher majesty's own servants, who have written excellently well, as it\r\nwould appear if their doing could be found out and made public with the\r\nrest.\" And in a subsequent passage he thus awards to each of them his\r\nappropriate commendation. \"Of the latter sort I think thus: That for\r\ntragedy the lord Buckhurst and master Edward Ferrys (Ferrers), for such\r\ndoings as I have seen of theirs do deserve the highest price. The earl\r\nof Oxford and master Edwards of her majesty's chapel for comedy and\r\ninterlude. For eglogue and pastoral poesy, sir Philip Sidney and master\r\nChaloner, and that other gentleman who wrate the late 'Shepherd's\r\nCalendar'[108]. For dirty and amorous ode I find sir Walter Raleigh's\r\nvein most lofty, insolent and passionate. Master Edward Dyer for elegy,\r\nmost sweet, solemn and of high conceit. Gascoigne for a good metre and\r\nfor a plentiful vein. Phaer and Golding for a learned and well corrected\r\nverse, specially in translation clear and very faithfully answering\r\ntheir author's intent. Others have also written with much facility, but\r\nmore commendably perchance if they had not written so much nor so\r\npopularly[109].\" The passage concludes with a piece of flattery to her\r\nmajesty in her poetical capacity, unworthy of transcription.\r\n\r\n[Note 108: Spenser published this work under the signature of\r\n\"Immerito.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 109: Art of English Poesy, book i.]\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Poetical proportion\" or metre, our author writes\r\nlearnedly of the measures of the ancients, and on those employed by our\r\nnative poets with singular taste and judgement, except that the\r\nartist-like pride in difficulty overcome has inspired him with an\r\nunwarrantable fondness for verses arranged in eggs, roundels, lozenges,\r\ntriquets, and other ingenious figures, of which he has given diagrams\r\nfurther illustrated by finished specimens of his own construction.\r\n\r\nGreat efforts had been made about this period by a literary party, of\r\nwhich Stainhurst the translator of Virgil, Sidney and Gabriel Hervey\r\nwere the leaders, to introduce the Greek and Roman measures into\r\nEnglish verse, and Puttenham has judged it necessary to compose a\r\nchapter thus intituled: \"How, if all manner of sudden innovations were\r\nnot very scandalous, specially in the laws of any language or art, the\r\nuse of Greek and Latin feet might be brought into our vulgar poesy, and\r\nwith good grace enough.\" But it is evident on the whole, that he bore no\r\ngood will to this pedantic novelty.\r\n\r\nIn treating of \"Ornament,\" our author enumerates, explains and\r\nexemplifies all the rhetorical figures of the Greeks; adding, for the\r\nbenefit of courtiers and ladies, to whom his work is principally\r\naddressed, translations of their names; several of which would require\r\nto be retranslated for the benefit of the modern reader, as for example\r\nthe three following, all figures of derision:--\"The fleering\r\nfrump;\"--\"The broad flout;\"--\"The privy nip.\" At the present day,\r\nhowever, the work of Puttenham is most of all to be valued for the\r\nremarks on language and on manners, and the contemporary anecdotes with\r\nwhich it abounds, and of which some examples may be quoted. After\r\nobserving that \"as it hath been always reputed a great fault to use\r\nfigurative speeches foolishly and indiscreetly, so it is esteemed no\r\nless an imperfection in man's utterance, to have none use of figure at\r\nall, specially in our writing and speeches public, making them but as\r\nour ordinary talk, than which nothing can be more unsavory and far from\r\nall civility:--'I remember,' says he, 'in the first year of queen Mary's\r\nreign a knight of Yorkshire was chosen speaker of the parliament, a\r\ngood gentleman and wise, in the affairs of his shire, and not unlearned\r\nin the laws of the realm; but as well for lack of some of his teeth as\r\nfor want of language, nothing well spoken, which at that time and\r\nbusiness was most behoveful for him to have been: this man, after he had\r\nmade his oration to the queen; which ye know is of course to be done at\r\nthe first assembly of both houses; a bencher of the Temple, both well\r\nlearned and very eloquent, returning from the parliament house asked\r\nanother gentleman his friend how he liked Mr. Speaker's oration; 'Mary,'\r\nquoth the other, 'methinks I heard not a better alehouse tale told this\r\nseven years.'... And though grave and wise councillors in their\r\nconsultations do not use much superfluous eloquence, and also in their\r\njudicial hearings do much mislike all scholastical rhetorics: yet in\r\nsuch a case... if the lord chancellor of England or archbishop of\r\nCanterbury himself were to speak, he ought to do it cunningly and\r\neloquently, which cannot be without the use of figures: and nevertheless\r\nnone impeachment or blemish to the gravity of the persons or of the\r\ncause: wherein I report me to them that knew sir Nicholas Bacon lord\r\nkeeper of the great seal, or the now lord treasurer of England, and have\r\nbeen conversant with their speeches made in the Parliament house and\r\nStar-chamber. From whose lips I have seen to proceed more grave and\r\nnatural eloquence, than from all the orators of Oxford or Cambridge; but\r\nall is as it is handled, and maketh no matter whether the same eloquence\r\nbe natural to them or artificial (though I rather think natural); yet\r\nwere they known to be learned and not unskilful of the art when they\r\nwere younger men.... I have come to the lord keeper sir Nicholas Bacon,\r\nand found him sitting in his gallery alone with the works of Quintilian\r\nbefore him; indeed he was a most eloquent man, and of rare learning and\r\nwisdom as ever I knew England to breed; and one that joyed as much in\r\nlearned men and men of good wits.\" He mentions being a by-stander when a\r\ndoctor of civil law, \"pleading in a litigious cause betwixt a man and\r\nhis wife, before a great magistrate, who (as they can tell that knew\r\nhim) was a man very well learned and grave, but somewhat sour and of no\r\nplausible utterance: the gentleman's chance was to say: 'My lord, the\r\nsimple woman is not so much to blame as her leud abettors, who by\r\n_violent_ persuasions have led her into this wilfulness.' Quoth the\r\nJudge; 'What need such eloquent terms in this place?' The gentleman\r\nreplied, 'Doth your lordship mislike the term (_violent_)? and methinks\r\nI speak it to great purpose; for I am sure she would never have done it,\r\nbut by force of persuasion.'\" &c.\r\n\r\nPursuing the subject of language, which, he says, \"in our maker or poet\r\nmust be heedily looked unto that it be natural, pure, and the most usual\r\nof all his country,\" after some other rules or cautions he adds: \"Our\r\nmaker therefore at these days shall not follow Piers Plowman, nor Gower,\r\nnor Lydgate, nor yet Chaucer, for their language is now out of use with\r\nus: neither shall he take the terms of Northern men, such as they use in\r\ndaily talk, whether they be noblemen or gentlemen or of their best\r\nclerks, all is a matter; nor in effect any speech used beyond the river\r\nof Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is the purer English\r\nSaxon at this day, yet it is not so courtly nor so current as our\r\nSouthern English is; no more is the far Western man's speech: ye shall\r\ntherefore take the usual speech of the court, and that of London and the\r\nshires lying about London within sixty miles and not much above. I say\r\nnot this but in every shire of England there be gentlemen and others\r\nthat speak, but specially write, as good Southern as we of Middlesex or\r\nSurry do; but not the common people of every shire, to whom the\r\ngentlemen and also their learned clerks do for the most part condescend;\r\nbut herein we are ruled by the English dictionaries and other books\r\nwritten by learned men, and therefore it needeth none other direction in\r\nthat behalf. Albeit peradventure some small admonition be not\r\nimpertinent, for we find in our English writers many words and speeches\r\namendable, and ye shall see in some many inkhorn terms so ill affected\r\nbrought in by men of learning, as preachers and schoolmasters; and many\r\nstrange terms of other languages by secretaries and merchants and\r\ntravellers, and many dark words and not usual nor well sounding, though\r\nthey be daily spoken in court. Wherefore great heed must be taken by our\r\nmaker in this point that his choice be good.\" He modestly expresses his\r\napprehensions that in some of these respects he may himself be accounted\r\na transgressor, and he subjoins a list of the new, foreign or unusual\r\nwords employed by him in this tract, with his reasons for their\r\nadoption. Of this number are; _scientific_, _conduict_, \"a French word,\r\nbut well allowed of us, and long since usual; it sounds something more\r\nthan this word (leading) for it is applied only to the leading of a\r\ncaptain, and not as a little boy should lead a blind man;\" _idiom_, from\r\nthe Greek; _significative_, \"borrowed of the Latin and French, but to us\r\nbrought in first by some noblemen's secretary, as I think, yet doth so\r\nwell serve the turn as it could not now be spared; and many more like\r\nusurped Latin and French words; as, _method_, _methodical_, _placation_,\r\n_function_, _assubtiling_, _refining_, _compendious_, _prolix_,\r\n_figurative_, _inveigle_, a term borrowed of our common lawyers:\r\n_impression_, also a new term, but well expressing the matter, and more\r\nthan our English word:\" _penetrate_, _penetrable_, _indignity_ in the\r\nsense of unworthiness, and a few more[110]. The whole enumeration is\r\ncurious, and strikingly exhibits the state of language at this epoch,\r\nwhen the rapid advancement of letters and of all the arts of social life\r\nwas creating a daily want of new terms, which writers in all classes and\r\nindividuals in every walk of life regarded themselves as authorized to\r\nsupply at their own discretion, in any manner and from any sources most\r\naccessible to them, whether pure or corrupt, ancient or modern. The\r\npedants of the universities, and the travelled coxcombs of the court,\r\nhad each a neological jargon of their own, unintelligible to each other\r\nand to the people at large; on the other hand, there were a few persons\r\nof grave professions and austere characters, who, like Cato the Censor\r\nduring a similar period of accelerated progress in the Roman state,\r\nprided themselves on preserving in all its unsophisticated simplicity,\r\nor primitive rudeness, the tongue of their forefathers. The judicious\r\nPuttenham, uniting the accuracy of scholastic learning with the\r\nenlargement of mind acquired by long intercourse among foreign nations,\r\nand with the polish of a courtier, places himself between the contending\r\nparties, and with a manly disdain of every species of affectation, but\r\nespecially that of rusticity and barbarism, avails himself, without\r\nscruple as without excess, of the copiousness of other languages to\r\nsupply the remaining deficiencies of his own.\r\n\r\n[Note 110: Art of English Poesy, book iii.]\r\n\r\nSeveral chapters of the book \"of Ornament\" are devoted to the discussion\r\nof the decent, or seemly, in words and actions, and prove the author to\r\nhave been a nice observer of manners as well as a refined critic of\r\nstyle. He severely censures a certain translator of Virgil, who said\r\n\"that AEneas was fain to _trudge_ out of Troy; which term better became\r\nto be spoken of a beggar, or of a rogue, or of a lackey:\" and another\r\nwho called the same hero \"by fate a _fugitive_;\" and who inquires \"What\r\nmoved Juno to _tug_ so great a captain;\" a word \"the most indecent in\r\nthis case that could have been devised, since it is derived from the\r\ncart, and signifies the draught or pull of the horses.\" The phrase \"a\r\nprince's _pelf_\" is reprobated, because _pelf_ means properly \"the\r\nscraps or shreds of taylors and of skinners.\" He gives strict rules for\r\nthe decorous behaviour of ambassadors and all who address themselves to\r\nprinces, being himself a courtier, and having probably exercised some\r\ndiplomatic function. \"I have seen,\" says he, \"foreign ambassadors in the\r\nqueen's presence laugh so dissolutely at some rare pastime or sport that\r\nhath been made there, that nothing in the world could have worse becomen\r\nthem.\" With respect to men in other stations of life he is pleased to\r\nsay, it is decent for a priest \"to be sober and sad;\" \"a judge to be\r\nincorrupted, solitary, and unacquainted with courtiers or courtly\r\nentertainments... without plait or wrinkle, sour in look and churlish in\r\nspeech; contrariwise a courtly gentleman to be lofty and curious in\r\ncountenance, yet sometimes a creeper and a curry favell with his\r\nsuperiors.\" \"And in a prince it is decent to go slowly and to march with\r\nleisure, and with a certain grandity rather than gravity; as our\r\nsovereign lady and mistress, the very image of majesty and magnificence,\r\nis accustomed to do generally, unless it be when she walketh apace for\r\nher pleasure, or to catch her a heat in the cold mornings. Nevertheless\r\nit is not so decent in a meaner person, as I have discerned in some\r\ncounterfeit ladies of the country, which use it much to their own\r\nderision. This comeliness was wanting in queen Mary, _otherwise a very\r\ngood and honorable princess_. And was some blemish to the emperor\r\nFerdinando, a most noble-minded man, yet so careless and forgetful of\r\nhimself in that behalf, as I have seen him run up a pair of stairs so\r\nswift and nimble a pace, as almost had not become a very mean man, who\r\nhad not gone in some hasty business.\"\r\n\r\nRespecting the poets mentioned by Puttenham whose names have not\r\nalready occurred in the present work, it may be observed, that excepting\r\na few lines quoted by this critic, there is nothing remaining of sir\r\nEdward Dyer's, except, which is highly probable, he is to be reckoned\r\namong the anonymous contributors to the popular collections of that day.\r\nOf Gascoigne, on the contrary, enough is left to exhaust the patience of\r\nany modern reader. In his youth, neglecting the study of the law for\r\npoetry and pleasure, he poured forth an abundance of amatory pieces;\r\nsome of them sonnets closely imitating the Italian ones in style as well\r\nas structure. Afterwards, during a five-years service in the war of\r\nFlanders, he found leisure for much serious thought; and discarding the\r\nlevities of his early years, he composed by way of expiation a moral\r\nsatire in blank verse called the Steel Glass, and several religious\r\npieces. Notwithstanding however this newly assumed seriousness, he\r\nattended her majesty in her progress in the summer of 1575, and composed\r\na large number of courtly verses as a contribution to \"the princely\r\npleasures of Kennelworth.\" Gascoigne died in October 1577. Of his minor\r\npoems the following may be cited as a pleasing specimen.\r\n\r\n    THE LULLABY OF A LOVER.\r\n\r\n    Sing lullaby as women do,\r\n    Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,\r\n    And lullaby can I sing too\r\n    As womanly as can the best.\r\n    With lullaby they still the child;\r\n    And if I be not much beguil'd,\r\n    Full many wanton babes have I,\r\n    Which must be still'd with lullaby.\r\n\r\n    First lullaby my youthful years.\r\n    It is now time to go to bed,\r\n    For crooked age and hoary years\r\n    Have won the haven within my head:\r\n    With lullaby then youth be still,\r\n    With lullaby content thy will,\r\n    Since courage quails and comes behind,\r\n    Go sleep and so beguile thy mind.\r\n\r\n    Next lullaby my gazing eyes,\r\n    Which wonted were to glaunce apace;\r\n    For every glass may now suffice\r\n    To shew the furrows in my face.\r\n    With lullaby then wink awhile,\r\n    With lullaby your looks beguile:\r\n    Let no fair face or beauty bright\r\n    Entice you eft with vain delight.\r\n\r\n    And lullaby my wanton will,\r\n    Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,\r\n    Since all too late I find by skill,\r\n    How dear I have thy fancies bought:\r\n    With lullaby now take thine ease,\r\n    With lullaby thy doubts appease;\r\n    For trust to this, if thou be still,\r\n    My body shall obey thy will.\r\n\r\n    Thus lullaby my youth, mine eyes,\r\n    My will, my ware, and all that was,\r\n    I can no mo delays devise,\r\n    But welcome pain, let pleasure pass:\r\n    With lullaby now take your leave,\r\n    With lullaby your dreams deceive,\r\n    And when you rise with waking eye,\r\n    Remember then this lullaby.\r\n\r\nRespecting another poet of greater popularity than Gascoigne, and of a\r\nmore original turn of genius, Warner, the author of Albion's England,\r\nPuttenham has preserved a discreet silence; for his great work had been\r\nprohibited by the capricious tyranny, or rigid decorum, of archbishop\r\nWhitgift, and seizure made in 1586 of the copies surreptitiously\r\nprinted. This long and singular poem is a kind of metrical chronicle,\r\ncontaining the remarkable events of _English_ history from the\r\nflood,--the starting point of all chroniclers,--to the reign of queen\r\nElizabeth. It is written in the common ballad measure, and in a style\r\noften creeping and prosaic, sometimes quaint and affected; but passages\r\nof beautiful simplicity and strokes of genuine pathos frequently occur\r\nto redeem its faults, and the tediousness of the historical narration is\r\nrelieved by a large intermixture of interesting and entertaining\r\nepisodes. The ballads of Queen Eleanor and fair Rosamond, Argentile and\r\nCuran, and the Patient Countess, selected by Dr. Percy in his Relics of\r\nAncient Poetry, may be regarded by the poetical student of the present\r\nday as a sufficient specimen of the talents of Warner: but in his own\r\ntime he was complimented as the Homer or Virgil of the age; the\r\npersevering reader travelled, not only with patience but delight,\r\nthrough his seventy-seven long chapters; and it is said that the work\r\nbecame popular enough, notwithstanding its prohibition by authority, to\r\nsupersede in some degree its celebrated predecessor the Mirror for\r\nMagistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nFROM 1591 TO 1593.\r\n\r\nNaval war against Spain.--Death of sir Richard Grenville--Notice of\r\nCavendish.--Establishment of the East India company.--Results of voyages\r\nof discovery.--Transactions between Raleigh and the queen.--Anecdotes of\r\nRobert Cary--of the Holles family.--Progress of the drama.--Dramatic\r\npoets before Shakespeare.--Notice of Shakespeare.--Proclamation\r\nrespecting bear-baiting and acting of plays.--Censorship of the\r\ndrama.--Anecdote of the queen and Tarleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maritime war with Spain, notwithstanding the cautious temper of the\r\nqueen, was strenuously waged during the year 1591, and produced some\r\nstriking indications of the rising spirit of the English navy.\r\n\r\nA squadron under lord Thomas Howard, which had been waiting six months\r\nat the Azores to intercept the homeward bound ships from Spanish\r\nAmerica, was there surprised by a vastly more numerous fleet of the\r\nenemy which had been sent out for their convoy. The English admiral got\r\nto sea in all haste and made good his retreat, followed by his whole\r\nsquadron excepting the Revenge, which was entangled in a narrow channel\r\nbetween the port and an island. Sir Richard Grenville her commander,\r\nafter a vain attempt to break through the Spanish line, determined, with\r\na kind of heroic desperation, to sustain alone the conflict with a\r\nwhole fleet of fifty-seven sail, and to confront all extremities rather\r\nthan strike his colors. From three o'clock in the afternoon till\r\nday-break he resisted, by almost incredible efforts of valor, all the\r\nforce which could be brought to bear against him, and fifteen times beat\r\nback the boarding parties from his deck. At length, when all his bravest\r\nhad fallen, and he himself was disabled by many wounds; his powder also\r\nbeing exhausted, his small-arms lost or broken, and his ship a perfect\r\nwreck, he proposed to his gallant crew to sink her, that no trophy might\r\nremain to the enemy. But this proposal, though applauded by several, was\r\noverruled by the majority: the Revenge struck to the Spaniards; and two\r\ndays after, her brave commander died on board their admiral's ship of\r\nhis glorious wounds, \"with a joyful and quiet mind,\" as he expressed\r\nhimself, and admired by his enemies themselves for his high spirit and\r\ninvincible resolution. This was the first English ship of any\r\nconsiderable size captured by the Spaniards during the whole war, and it\r\ndid them little good; for, besides that the vessel had been shattered to\r\npieces, and sunk a few days after with two hundred Spanish sailors on\r\nboard, the example of heroic self-devotion set by sir Richard Grenville\r\nlong continued in the hour of battle to strike awe and terror to their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nThomas Cavendish, elated by the splendid success of that first\r\nexpedition in which, with three slender barks of insignificant size\r\ncarrying only one hundred and twenty-three persons of every degree, he\r\nhad plundered the whole coast of New Spain and Peru, burned Paita and\r\nAcapulco, and captured a Spanish admiral of seven hundred tons, besides\r\nmany other vessels taken or burned;--then crossed the great South Sea,\r\nand circumnavigated the globe in the shortest time in which that exploit\r\nhad yet been performed;--set sail again in August 1591 on a second\r\nvoyage. But this time, when his far greater force and more adequate\r\npreparations of every kind seemed to promise results still more\r\nprofitable and glorious, scarce any thing but disasters awaited him. He\r\ntook indeed the town of Santos in Brazil, which was an acquisition of\r\nsome importance; but delaying here too long, he arrived at a wrong\r\nseason in the Straits of Magellan, and was compelled to endure the\r\nwinter of that inhospitable clime; where seeing his numbers thinned by\r\nsickness and hardship, and his plans baffled by dissentions and\r\ninsubordination, he found it necessary to abandon his original design of\r\ncrossing the South Sea, and resolved to undertake the voyage to China by\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. First, however, he was fatally prevailed upon to\r\nreturn to the coast of Brazil, where he lost many men in rash attempts\r\nagainst various towns, which expecting his attacks were now armed for\r\ntheir defence, and a still greater number by desertion. Baffled in all\r\nhis designs, worn out with fatigue, anxieties, and chagrin, this brave\r\nbut unfortunate adventurer breathed his last far from England on the\r\nwide ocean, and so obscurely that even the date of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nAt this period, a peculiar education was regarded as not more necessary\r\nto enable a gentleman to assume the direction of a naval expedition than\r\nthe command of a troop of horse; and it is probable that even by\r\nCavendish, whose exploits we read with amazement, but a very slender\r\nstock of maritime experience was possessed when he first embarked on\r\nboard the vessel in which he had undertaken to circumnavigate the globe.\r\nHe was the third son of a Suffolk gentleman of large estate; came early\r\nto court; and having there consumed his patrimony in the fashionable\r\nmagnificence of the time, suddenly discovered within himself sufficient\r\ncourage to attempt the reparation of his broken fortunes by that\r\nfavorite resource, the plunder of the Spanish settlements. On his return\r\nfrom his first voyage he sailed up the Thames in a kind of triumph,\r\ndisplaying a top-sail of cloth of gold, and making ostentation of the\r\nprofit rather than the glory of the enterprise. He appears to have been\r\nequally deficient in the enlightened prudence which makes an essential\r\nfeature of the great commander, and in that lofty disinterestedness of\r\nmotive which constitutes the hero; but in the activity, the enterprise,\r\nthe brilliant valor, which now form the spirit of the English navy, he\r\nhad few equals and especially few predecessors; and amongst the founders\r\nof its glory the name of Cavendish is therefore worthy of a conspicuous\r\nand enduring place.\r\n\r\nBy the failure of the late attempt to seat don Antonio on the throne of\r\nPortugal, the sovereignty of Philip II. over that country and its\r\ndependencies had finally been established; and in consequence its trade\r\nand settlements in the East offered a fair and tempting prize to the\r\nambition or cupidity of English adventurers.\r\n\r\nThe passage by the Cape of Good Hope, repeatedly accomplished by\r\ncircumnavigators of this nation, had now ceased to oppose any formidable\r\nobstacle to the spirit of maritime enterprise; and the papal donation\r\nwas a bulwark still less capable of preserving inviolate to the\r\nsovereigns of Portugal their own rich Indies. The first expedition ever\r\nfitted out from England for those eastern regions, where it now\r\npossesses an extent of territory in comparison of which itself is but a\r\npetty province, consisted of three \"tall ships,\" which sailed in this\r\nyear under the conduct of George Raymond and James Lancaster. After\r\ndoubling the Cape and refreshing themselves in Saldanha Bay, which the\r\nPortuguese had named but not yet settled, the navigators steered along\r\nthe eastern coast of Africa, where the ship commanded by Raymond was\r\nlost. With the other two, however, they proceeded still eastward; passed\r\nwithout impediment all the stations of the Portuguese on the shores of\r\nthe Indian ocean, doubled Cape Comorin, and extended their voyage to the\r\nNicobar isles, and even to the peninsula of Malacca. They landed in\r\nseveral parts, where they found means to open an advantageous traffic\r\nwith the natives; and, after capturing many Portuguese vessels laden\r\nwith various kinds of merchandise, repassed the Cape in perfect safety\r\nwith all their booty. In their way home they visited the West Indies,\r\nwhere great disasters overtook them; for here their two remaining ships\r\nwere lost, and Lancaster, with the slender remnant of their crews, was\r\nglad to obtain a passage to Europe on board a French ship which happily\r\narrived to their relief. But as far as respected the eastern part of\r\nthe expedition, their success had been such as strongly to invite the\r\nattempts of future adventurers; and nine years after its sailing, her\r\nmajesty was prevailed upon to grant a charter of incorporation with\r\nample privileges to an East India company, under whose auspices\r\nLancaster consented to undertake a second voyage. Annual fleets were\r\nfrom this period fitted out by these enterprising traders, and factories\r\nof their establishment soon arose in Surat, in Masulipatam, in Bantam,\r\nin Siam, and even in Japan. The history of their progress makes no part\r\nof the subject of the present work; but the foundation of a mercantile\r\ncompany which has advanced itself to power and importance absolutely\r\nunparalleled in the annals of the world, forms a feature not to be\r\noverlooked in the glory of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThese long and hazardous voyages of discovery, of hostility, or of\r\ncommerce, began henceforth to afford one of the most honorable\r\noccupations to those among the youthful nobility or gentry of the\r\ncountry, whose active spirits disdained the luxurious and servile\r\nidleness of the court: they also opened a welcome resource to younger\r\nsons, and younger brothers, impatient to emancipate themselves from the\r\ngalling miseries of that necessitous dependence on the head of their\r\nhouse to which the customs of the age and country relentlessly condemned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus Shakespeare in his Two Gentlemen of Verona,\r\n\r\n    ...\"He wondered that your lordship\r\n    Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,\r\n    While other men of slender reputation\r\n    Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:\r\n    Some to the wars to try their fortune there;\r\n    _Some to discover islands far away_;\r\n    Some to the studious universities.\r\n    For any or for all these exercises,\r\n    He said, that Protheus your son was meet:\r\n    And did request me to importune you\r\n    To let him spend his time no more at home;\r\n    Which would be great impeachment to his age,\r\n    In having known no travel in his youth.\"\r\n\r\nBut the advancement of the fortunes of individuals was by no means the\r\nprincipal or most permanent good which accrued to the nation by these\r\nenterprises. The period was still indeed far distant, in which voyages\r\nof discovery were to be undertaken on scientific principles and with\r\nlarge views of general utility; but new animals, new vegetables, natural\r\nproductions or manufactured articles before unknown to them, attracted\r\nthe attention even of these first unskilful explorers. Specimens in\r\nevery kind were brought home, and, recommended as they never failed to\r\nbe by fabulous or grossly exaggerated descriptions, in the first\r\ninstance only served to gratify and inflame the vulgar passion for\r\nwonders. But the attention excited to these striking novelties gradually\r\nbecame enlightened; a more familiar acquaintance disclosed their genuine\r\nproperties, and the purposes to which they might be applied at\r\nhome;--Raleigh introduced the potatoe on his Irish estates;--an\r\nacceptable however inelegant luxury was discovered in the use of\r\ntobacco; and somewhat later, the introduction of tea gradually brought\r\nsobriety and refinement into the system of modern English manners.\r\n\r\nMany allusions to the prevailing passion for beholding foreign, or, as\r\nthey were then accounted, monstrous animals, may be found scattered over\r\nthe works of Shakespeare and contemporary dramatists. Trinculo says,\r\nspeaking of Caliban, \"Were I but in England now... and had but this fish\r\npainted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver.\r\nThere would this monster _make_ a man; any strange beast there makes a\r\nman: when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will\r\nlay out ten to see a dead Indian.\" And again; \"Do you put tricks upon's\r\nwith savages and men of Inde?\" &c. The whole play of the Tempest,\r\nexquisite as it is, must have derived a still more poignant relish, to\r\nthe taste of that age, from the romantic ideas of desert islands then\r\nfloating in the imaginations of men.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1592, Raleigh, weary of his Irish exile, and\r\nanxious by some splendid exploit to revive the declining favor of the\r\nqueen, projected a formidable attack on the Spanish power in America,\r\nand engaged without difficulty in the enterprise a large number of\r\nvolunteers. But unavoidable obstacles arose, by which the fleet was\r\ndetained till the proper season for its sailing was past: Elizabeth\r\nrecalled Raleigh to court; and the only fortunate result of the\r\nexpedition, to the command of which Martin Frobisher succeeded, was the\r\ncapture of one wealthy carrack and the destruction of another.\r\n\r\nRaleigh, in the meantime, was amusing his involuntary idleness by an\r\nintrigue with one of her majesty's maids of honor, a daughter of the\r\ncelebrated sir Nicholas Throgmorton. The queen, in the heat of her\r\nindignation at the scandal brought upon her court by the consequences of\r\nthis amour, resorted, as in a thousand other cases, to a vigor beyond\r\nthe laws; and though sir Walter offered immediately to make the lady the\r\nbest reparation in his power, by marrying her, which he afterwards\r\nperformed, Elizabeth unfeelingly published her shame to the whole world\r\nby sending both culprits to the Tower.\r\n\r\nSir Walter remained a prisoner during several months. Meanwhile his\r\nships returned from their cruise, and the profits from the sale of the\r\ncaptured carrack were to be divided among the queen, the admiral, the\r\nsailors, and the several contributors to the outfit. Disputes arose; her\r\nmajesty was dissatisfied with the share allotted her; and taking\r\nadvantage of the situation into which her own despotic violence had\r\nthrown Raleigh, she appears to have compelled him to buy his liberty,\r\nand the undisturbed enjoyment of all that he held under her, by the\r\nsacrifice of no less than eighty thousand pounds due to him as admiral.\r\nSuch was the disinterested purity of that zeal for morals of which\r\nElizabeth judged it incumbent on her to make profession!\r\n\r\nIt may be curious to learn, from another incident which occurred about\r\nthe same time, at what rate her majesty caused her forgiveness of\r\nlawful matrimony to be purchased.\r\n\r\nRobert Cary, third son of lord Hunsdon, created lord Leppington by James\r\nI. and earl of Monmouth by his successor,--from whose memoirs of himself\r\nthe following particulars are derived,--was at this time a young man and\r\nan assiduous attendant on the court of his illustrious kinswoman. Being\r\na younger son, he had no patrimony either in possession or reversion; he\r\nreceived from the exchequer only one hundred pounds per annum during\r\npleasure, and by the style of life which he found it necessary to\r\nsupport, had incurred a debt of a thousand pounds. In this situation he\r\nmarried a widow possessed of five hundred pounds per annum and some\r\nready money. His father evinced no displeasure on the occasion; but his\r\nother friends, and especially the queen, were so much offended at the\r\nmatch, that he took his wife to Carlisle and remained there without\r\napproaching the court till the next year. Being then obliged to visit\r\nLondon on business, his father suggested the expediency of his paying\r\nthe queen the compliment of appearing on _her day_. Accordingly, he\r\nsecretly prepared caparisons and a present for her majesty, at the cost\r\nof more than four hundred pounds, and presented himself in the tilt-yard\r\nin the character of \"a forsaken knight who had vowed solitariness.\" The\r\nfestival over, he made himself known to his friends in court; but the\r\nqueen, though she had received his gift, would not take notice of his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nIt happened soon after, that the king of Scots sent to Cary's elder\r\nbrother, then marshal of Berwick, to beg that he would wait upon him to\r\nreceive a secret message which he wanted to transmit to the queen. The\r\nmarshal wrote to his father to inquire her majesty's pleasure in the\r\nmatter. She did not choose that he should stir out of Berwick; but\r\n\"knowing, though she would not know it,\" that Robert Cary was in court,\r\nshe said at length to lord Hunsdon, \"I hear your fine son that has\r\nmarried lately so worthily is hereabouts; send him if you will to know\r\nthe king's pleasure.\" His lordship answered, that he knew he would be\r\nhappy to obey her commands. \"No,\" said she, \"do you bid him go, for I\r\nhave nothing to do with him.\" Robert Cary thought it hard to be sent off\r\nwithout first seeing the queen; \"Sir,\" said he to his father, who urged\r\nhis going, \"if she be on such hard terms with me, I had need be wary\r\nwhat I do. If I go to the king without her license, it were in her power\r\nto hang me at my return, and that, for any thing I see, it were ill\r\ntrusting her.\" Lord Hunsdon \"merrily\" told the queen what he said. \"If\r\nthe gentleman be so distrustful,\" she answered, \"let the secretary make\r\na safe-conduct to go and come, and I will sign it.\" On his return with\r\nletters from James, Robert Cary hastened to court, and entered the\r\npresence-chamber splashed and dirty as he was; but not finding the queen\r\nthere, lord Hunsdon went to her to announce his son's arrival. She\r\ndesired him to receive the letter, or message, and bring it to her. But\r\nthe young gentleman knew the court and the queen too well to consent to\r\ngive up his dispatches even to his father; he insisted on delivering\r\nthem himself, and at length, with much difficulty gained admission.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter was, as he expresses it, \"stormy and terrible,\"\r\nwhich he passed over with silence; but when the queen had \"said her\r\npleasure\" of himself and his wife, he made her a courtly excuse; with\r\nwhich she was so well appeased, that she at length assured him all was\r\nforgiven and forgotten, and received him into her wonted favor. After\r\nthis happy conclusion of an adventure so perilous to a courtier of\r\nElizabeth, Cary returned to Carlisle; and his father's death soon\r\noccurring, he had orders to take upon himself the government of Berwick\r\ntill further orders. In this situation he remained a year without\r\nsalary; impairing much his small estate, and unable to obtain from court\r\neither an allowance, or leave of absence to enable him to solicit one in\r\nperson. At length, necessity rendering him bold, he resolved to hazard\r\nthe step of going up without permission. On his arrival, however,\r\nneither secretary Cecil nor even his own brother would venture to\r\nintroduce him to the queen's presence, but advised him to hasten back\r\nbefore his absence should be known, for fear of her anger. At last, as\r\nhe stood sorrowfully pondering on his case, a gentleman of the chamber,\r\ntouched with pity, undertook to mention his arrival to her majesty in a\r\nway which should not displease her: and he opened the case by telling\r\nher, that she was more beholden to the love and service of one man than\r\nof many whom she favored more. This excited her curiosity; and on her\r\nasking who this person might be, he answered that it was Robert Cary,\r\nwho, unable longer to bear his absence from her sight, had posted up to\r\nkiss her hand and instantly return. She sent for him directly, received\r\nhim with greater favor than ever, allowed him after the interview to\r\nlead her out by the hand, which seemed to his brother and the secretary\r\nnothing less than a miracle; and what was more, granted him five hundred\r\npounds immediately, a patent of the wardenry of the east marches, and a\r\nrenewal of his grant of Norham-castle. It was this able courtier, rather\r\nthan grateful kinsman, who earned the good graces of king James by being\r\nthe first to bring him the welcome tidings of the decease of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIncidental mention has already been made of sir William Holles of\r\nHaughton in Nottinghamshire, the gentleman who refused to marry his\r\ndaughter to the earl of Cumberland, because he did not choose \"to stand\r\ncap in hand\" to his son-in-law: this worthy knight died at a great age\r\nin the year 1590; and a few further particulars respecting him and his\r\ndescendants may deserve record, on account of the strong light which\r\nthey reflect on several points of manners. Sir William was\r\ndistinguished, perhaps beyond any other person of the same rank in the\r\nkingdom, for boundless hospitality and a magnificent style of living.\r\n\"He began his Christmas,\" says the historian of the family, \"at\r\nAllhallowtide and continued it until Candlemas; during which any man was\r\npermitted to stay three days, without being asked whence he came or what\r\nhe was.\" For each of the twelve days of Christmas he allowed a fat ox\r\nand other provisions in proportion. He would never dine till after one\r\no'clock; and being asked why he preferred so unusually late an hour, he\r\nanswered, that \"for aught he knew there might a friend come twenty miles\r\nto dine with him, and he would be loth he should lose his labor.\"\r\n\r\nAt the coronation of Edward VI. he appeared with fifty followers in blue\r\ncoats and badges,--then the ordinary costume of retainers and\r\nserving-men,--and he never went to the sessions at Retford, though only\r\nfour miles from his own mansion, without thirty \"proper fellows\" at his\r\nheels. What was then rare among the greatest subjects, he kept a company\r\nof actors of his own to perform plays and masques at festival times; in\r\nsummer they travelled about the country.\r\n\r\nThis sir William was succeeded in his estates by sir John Holles his\r\ngrandson, who was one of the band of gentlemen pensioners to Elizabeth,\r\nand in the reign of James I. purchased the title of earl of Clare. His\r\ngrandfather had engaged his hand to a kinswoman of the earl of\r\nShrewsbury; but the young man declining to complete this contract, and\r\ntaking to wife a daughter of sir Thomas Stanhope, the consequence was a\r\nlong and inveterate feud between the houses of Holles and of Talbot,\r\nwhich was productive of several remarkable incidents. Its first effect\r\nwas a duel between Orme, a servant of Holles, and Pudsey, master of\r\nhorse to the earl of Shrewsbury, in which the latter was slain. The earl\r\nprosecuted Orme, and sought to take away his life; but sir John Holles\r\nin the first instance caused him to be conveyed away to Ireland, and\r\nafterwards obtained his pardon of the queen. For his conduct in this\r\nbusiness he was himself challenged by Gervase Markham, champion and\r\ngallant to the countess of Shrewsbury; but he refused the duel, because\r\nthe unreasonable demand of Markham, that it should take place in a park\r\nbelonging to the earl his enemy, gave him just ground to apprehend that\r\nsome treachery was meditated. Anxious however to wipe away the\r\naspersions which his adversary had taken occasion to cast upon his\r\ncourage, he sought a rencounter which might wear the appearance of\r\naccident; and soon after, having met Markham on the road, they\r\nimmediately dismounted and attacked each other with their rapiers;\r\nMarkham fell, severely wounded, and the earl of Shrewsbury lost no time\r\nin raising his servants and tenantry to the number of one hundred and\r\ntwenty in order to apprehend Holles in case Markham's hurt should prove\r\nmortal. On the other side lord Sheffield, the kinsman of Holles, joined\r\nhim with sixty men. \"I hear, cousin,\" said he on his arrival, \"that my\r\nlord of Shrewsbury is prepared to trouble you; but take my word, before\r\nhe carry you it shall cost many a broken pate;\" and he and his company\r\nremained at Haughton till the wounded man was out of danger. Markham had\r\nvowed never to eat supper or take the sacrament till he was revenged,\r\nand in consequence found himself obliged to abstain from both to the day\r\nof his death[111]. What appears the most extraordinary part of the\r\nstory is, that we do not find the queen and council interfering to put a\r\nstop to this private war, worthy of the barbarism of the feudal ages.\r\nGervase Markham, who was the portionless younger son of a\r\nNottinghamshire gentleman of ancient family, became the most voluminous\r\nmiscellaneous writer of his age, using his pen apparently as his chief\r\nmeans of subsistence. He wrote on a vast variety of subjects, and both\r\nin verse and prose; but his works on farriery and husbandry appear to\r\nhave been the most useful, and those on field sports the most\r\nentertaining, of his performances.\r\n\r\n[Note 111: See Historical Collections, by Collins.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the drama is a subject which claims in this place some\r\nshare of our attention, partly because it excited in a variety of ways\r\nthat of Elizabeth herself. By the appearance of Ferrex and Porrex in\r\n1561, and that of Gammer Gurton's Needle five years later, a new impulse\r\nhad been given to English genius; and both tragedies and comedies\r\napproaching the regular models, besides historical and pastoral dramas,\r\nallegorical pieces resembling the old moralities, and translations from\r\nthe ancients, were from this time produced in abundance, and received by\r\nall classes with avidity and delight.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty dramatic poets flourished between 1561 and 1590; and an\r\ninspection of the titles alone of their numerous productions would\r\nfurnish evidence of an acquaintance with the stores of history,\r\nmythology, classical fiction, and romance, strikingly illustrative of\r\nthe literary diligence and intellectual activity of the age.\r\n\r\nRichard Edwards produced a tragi-comedy on the affecting ancient story\r\nof Damon and Pithias, besides his comedy of Palamon and Arcite, formerly\r\nnoticed as having been performed for the entertainment of her majesty at\r\nOxford. In connexion with this latter piece it may be remarked, that of\r\nthe chivalrous idea of Theseus in this celebrated tale and in the\r\nMidsummer Night's Dream, as well as of all the other _gothicized_\r\nrepresentations of ancient heroes, of which Shakespeare's Troilus and\r\nCressida, his Rape of Lucrece, and some passages of Spenser's Faery\r\nQueen, afford further examples, Guido Colonna's _Historia Trojana_,\r\nwritten in 1260, was the original: a work long and widely popular, which\r\nhad been translated, paraphrased and imitated in French and English, and\r\nwhich the barbarism of its incongruities, however palpable, had not as\r\nyet consigned to oblivion or contempt.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gascoigne, besides his tragedy from Euripides, translated also a\r\ncomedy from Ariosto, performed by the students of Gray's Inn under the\r\ntitle of The Supposes; which was the first specimen in our language of a\r\ndrama in prose. Italian literature was at this period cultivated amongst\r\nus with an assiduity unequalled either before or since, and it possessed\r\nfew authors of merit or celebrity whose works were not speedily\r\nfamiliarized to the English public through the medium of translations.\r\nThe study of this enchanting language found however a vehement opponent\r\nin Roger Ascham, who exclaims against the \"enchantments of Circe,\r\nbrought out of Italy to mar men's manners in England; much by examples\r\nof ill life, but more by precepts of fond books, of late translated out\r\nof Italian into English, and sold in every shop in London.\" He\r\nafterwards declares that \"there be more of these ungracious books set\r\nout in print within these few months than have been seen in England many\r\nyears before.\" To these strictures on the moral tendencies of the\r\npopular writers of Italy some force must be allowed; but it is obvious\r\nto remark, that similar objections might be urged with at least equal\r\ncogency against the favorite classics of Ascham; and that the use of so\r\nvaluable an instrument of intellectual advancement as the free\r\nintroduction of the literature of a highly polished nation into one\r\ncomparatively rude, is not to be denied to beings capable of moral\r\ndiscrimination, from the apprehension of such partial and incidental\r\ninjury as may arise out of its abuse. Italy, in fact, was at once the\r\nplenteous store-house whence the English poets, dramatists and romance\r\nwriters of the latter half of the sixteenth century drew their most\r\nprecious materials; the school where they acquired taste and skill to\r\nadapt them to their various purposes; and the Parnassian mount on which\r\nthey caught the purest inspirations of the muse.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was a zealous patroness of these studies; she spoke the\r\nItalian language with fluency and elegance, and used it frequently in\r\nher mottos and devices: by her encouragement, as we shall see,\r\nHarrington was urged to complete his version of the Orlando Furioso, and\r\nshe willingly accepted in the year 1600 the dedication of Fairfax's\r\nadmirable translation of the great epic of Tasso.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our dramatic writers:... Thomas Kyd was the author of a\r\ntragedy entitled Jeronimo, which for the absurd horrors of its plot, and\r\nthe mingled puerility and bombast of its language, was a source of\r\nperpetual ridicule to rival poets, while from a certain wild pathos\r\ncombined with its imposing grandiloquence it was long a favorite with\r\nthe people. The same person also translated a play by Garnier on the\r\nstory of Cornelia the wife of Pompey;--a solitary instance apparently of\r\nobligation to the French theatre on the part of these founders of our\r\nnational drama.\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Hughes the misfortunes of Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, were\r\nmade the subject of a tragedy performed before the queen.\r\n\r\nPreston, to whom when a youth her majesty had granted a pension of a\r\nshilling a day in consideration of his excellent acting in the play of\r\nPalamon and Arcite, composed on the story of Cambyses king of Persia \"A\r\nlamentable tragedy mixed full of pleasant mirth,\" which is now only\r\nremembered as having been an object of ridicule to Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nLilly, the author of Euphues, composed six court comedies and other\r\npieces principally on classical subjects, but disfigured by all the\r\nbarbarous affectations of style which had marked his earlier production.\r\n\r\nChristopher Marlow, unquestionably a man of genius, however deficient in\r\ntaste and judgement, astonished the world with his Tamburlain the\r\nGreat, which became in a manner proverbial for its rant and\r\nextravagance: he also composed, but in a purer style and with a pathetic\r\ncast of sentiment, a drama on the subject of king Edward II., and\r\nministered fuel to the ferocious prejudices of the age by his fiend-like\r\nportraiture of Barabas in The rich Jew of Malta. Marlow was also the\r\nauthor of a tragedy, in which the sublime and the grotesque were\r\nextraordinarily mingled, on the noted story of Dr. Faustus; a tale of\r\npreternatural horrors, which, after the lapse of two centuries, was\r\nagain to receive a similar distinction from the pen of one of the most\r\ncelebrated of German dramatists: not the only example which could be\r\nproduced of a coincidence of taste between the early tragedians of the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nOf the works of these and other contemporary poets, the fathers of the\r\nEnglish theatre, some are extant in print, others have come down to us\r\nin manuscript, and of no inconsiderable portion the titles alone\r\nsurvive. A few have acquired an incidental value in the eyes of the\r\ncurious, as having furnished the ground-work of some of the dramas of\r\nour great poet; but not one of the number can justly be said to make a\r\npart of the living literature of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the transcendent genius of Shakespeare alone, in\r\nthat infancy of our theatre when nothing proceeded from the crowd of\r\nrival dramatists but rude and abortive efforts, ridiculed by the learned\r\nand judicious of their own age and forgotten by posterity, to astonish\r\nand enchant the nation with those inimitable works which form the\r\nperpetual boast and immortal heritage of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nBy a strange kind of fatality, which excites at once our surprise and\r\nour unavailing regrets, the domestic and the literary history of this\r\ngreat luminary of his age are almost equally enveloped in doubt and\r\nobscurity. Even of the few particulars of his origin and early\r\nadventures which have reached us through various channels, the greater\r\nnumber are either imperfectly attested, or exposed to objections of\r\ndifferent kinds which render them of little value; and respecting his\r\ntheatrical life the most important circumstances still remain matter of\r\nconjecture, or at best of remote inference.\r\n\r\nWhen Shakespeare first became a writer for the stage;--what was his\r\nearliest production;--whether all the pieces usually ascribed to him be\r\nreally his, and whether there be any others of which he was in whole or\r\nin part the author;--what degree of assistance he either received from\r\nother dramatic writers or lent to them;--in what chronological order his\r\nacknowledged pieces ought to be arranged, and what dates should be\r\nassigned to their first representation;--are all questions on which the\r\ningenuity and indefatigable diligence of a crowd of editors, critics and\r\nbiographers have long been exerted, without producing any considerable\r\napproximation to certainty or to general agreement.\r\n\r\nOn a subject so intricate, it will suffice for the purposes of the\r\npresent work to state a few of the leading facts which appear to rest on\r\nthe most satisfactory authorities. William Shakespeare, who was born in\r\n1564, settled in London about 1586 or 1587, and seems to have almost\r\nimmediately adopted the profession of an actor. Yet his earliest effort\r\nin composition was not of the dramatic kind; for in 1593 he dedicated to\r\nhis great patron the earl of Southampton, as \"the first heir of his\r\ninvention,\" his Venus and Adonis, a narrative poem of considerable\r\nlength in the six-line stanza then popular. In the subsequent year he\r\nalso inscribed to the same noble friend his Rape of Lucrece, a still\r\nlonger poem of similar form in the stanza of seven lines, and containing\r\npassages of vivid description, of exquisite imagery, and of sentimental\r\nexcellence, which, had he written nothing more, would have entitled him\r\nto rank on a level with the author of the Faery Queen, and far above all\r\nother contemporary poets. He likewise employed his pen occasionally in\r\nthe composition of sonnets, principally devoted to love and friendship,\r\nand written perhaps in emulation of those of Spenser, who, as one of\r\nthese sonnets testifies, was at this period the object of his ardent\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication however of any one of these poems he must already\r\nhave attained considerable note as a dramatic writer, since Robert\r\nGreen, in a satirical piece printed in 1592, speaking of theatrical\r\nconcerns, stigmatizes this \"player\" as \"an absolute Joannes Factotum,\"\r\nand one who was \"in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.\"\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of Pericles, which was published in 1609 with the name of\r\nShakespeare in the title-page, and of which Dryden says in one of his\r\nprologues to a first play, \"Shakespeare's own muse his Pericles first\r\nbore,\" was probably acted in 1590, and appears to have been long\r\npopular. Romeo and Juliet was certainly an early production of his muse,\r\nand one which excited much interest, as may well be imagined, amongst\r\nthe younger portion of theatrical spectators.\r\n\r\nThere is high satisfaction in observing, that the age showed itself\r\nworthy of the immortal genius whom it had produced and fostered. It is\r\nagreed on all hands that Shakespeare was beloved as a man, and admired\r\nand patronized as a poet. In the profession of an actor, indeed, his\r\nsuccess does not appear to have been conspicuous; but the never-failing\r\nattraction of his pieces brought overflowing audiences to the Globe\r\ntheatre in Southwark, of which he was enabled to become a joint\r\nproprietor. Lord Southampton is said to have once bestowed on him a\r\nmunificent donation of a thousand pounds to enable him to complete a\r\npurchase; and it is probable that this nobleman might also introduce him\r\nto the notice of his beloved friend the earl of Essex. Of any particular\r\ngratuities bestowed on him by her majesty we are not informed: but there\r\nis every reason to suppose that he must have received from her on\r\nvarious occasions both praises and remuneration; for we are told that\r\nshe caused several of his pieces to be represented before her, and that\r\nthe Merry Wives of Windsor in particular owed its origin to her desire\r\nof seeing Falstaff exhibited in love.\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice the principal legal enactments of Elizabeth\r\nrespecting the conduct of the theatre, some of which are remarkable.\r\nDuring the early part of her reign, Sunday being still regarded\r\nprincipally in the light of a holiday, her majesty not only selected\r\nthat day, more frequently than any other, for the representation of\r\nplays at court for her own amusement, but by her license granted to\r\nBurbage in 1574 authorized the performance of them at the public\r\ntheatre, _on Sundays only_ out of the hours of prayer. Five years after,\r\nhowever, Gosson in his School of Abuse complains that the players,\r\n\"because they are allowed to play every Sunday, make four or five\r\nSundays at least every week.\" To limit this abuse, an order was issued\r\nby the privy-council in July 1591, purporting that no plays should be\r\npublicly exhibited on Thursdays, because on that day bear-baiting and\r\nsimilar pastimes had usually been practised; and in an injunction to the\r\nlord mayor four days after, the representation of plays on Sunday (or\r\nthe Sabbath as it now began to be called among the stricter sort of\r\npeople) was utterly condemned; and it was further complained that on\r\n\"all other days of the week in divers places the players do use to\r\nrecite their plays, to the great hurt and destruction of the game of\r\nbear-baiting, and like pastimes, which are maintained for her majesty's\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1589 her majesty thought proper to appoint commissioners to\r\ninspect all performances of writers for the stage, with full powers to\r\nreject and obliterate whatever they might esteem unmannerly, licentious,\r\nor irreverent:--a regulation which might seem to claim the applause of\r\nevery friend to public decency, were not the state in which the dramas\r\nof this age have come down to posterity sufficient evidence, that to\r\nrender these impressive appeals to the passions of assembled multitudes\r\npolitically and not morally inoffensive, was the genuine or principal\r\nmotive of this act of power.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this remark the following passage may be quoted: \"At\r\nsupper\" the queen \"would divert herself with her friends and attendants;\r\nand if they made her no answer, she would put them upon mirth and\r\npleasant discourse with great civility. She would then admit Tarleton, a\r\nfamous comedian and pleasant talker, and other such men, to divert her\r\nwith stories of the town, and the common jests and accidents. Tarleton,\r\nwho was then the best comedian in England, had made a pleasant play; and\r\nwhen it was acting before the queen, he pointed at Raleigh, and said,\r\n'See the knave commands the queen!' for which he was corrected by a\r\nfrown from the queen: yet he had the confidence to add, that he was of\r\ntoo much and too intolerable a power; and going on with the same\r\nliberty, he reflected on the too great power of the earl of Leicester;\r\nwhich was so universally applauded by all present, that she thought fit\r\nto bear these reflections with a seeming unconcernedness. But yet she\r\nwas so offended that she forbad Tarleton and all jesters from coming\r\nnear her table[112].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 112: See Bohun's Character of Queen Elizabeth.

It\r\nwas four entire years since this assembly had last met: but her majesty\r\ntook care to let the commons know, that the causes of offence which had\r\nthen occurred were still fresh in her memory, and that her resolution to\r\npreserve her own prerogative in its rigor, and the ecclesiastical\r\ncommission in all its terrors, was still inflexible.\r\n\r\nIt even appeared, that an apprehension lest her present necessities\r\nmight embolden the parliament to treat her despotic mandates with a\r\ndeference less profound than formerly, irritated her temper, and\r\nprompted her to assume a more haughty and menacing style than her\r\nhabitual study of popularity had hitherto permitted her to employ. In\r\nanswer to the three customary requests made by the speaker, for liberty\r\nof speech, freedom from arrests, and access to her person, she replied\r\nby her lord keeper, That such liberty of speech as the commons were\r\njustly entitled to,--liberty, namely, of aye and no,--she was willing to\r\ngrant; but by no means a liberty for every one to speak what he listed.\r\nAnd if any idle heads should be found careless enough of their own\r\nsafety to attempt innovations in the state, or reforms in the church,\r\nshe laid her injunctions on the speaker to refuse the bills offered for\r\nsuch purposes till they should have been examined by those who were\r\nbetter qualified to judge of these matters. She promised that she would\r\nnot impeach the liberty of their persons, provided they did not permit\r\nthemselves to imagine that any neglect of duty would be allowed to pass\r\nunpunished under shelter of this privilege; and she engaged not to deny\r\nthem access to her person on weighty affairs, and at convenient seasons,\r\nwhen she should have leisure from other important business of state.\r\n\r\nBut threats alone were not found sufficient to restrain all attempts on\r\nthe part of the commons to exercise their known rights and fulfil their\r\nduty to the country. Peter Wentworth, a member whose courageous and\r\nindependent spirit had already drawn upon him repeated manifestations of\r\nroyal displeasure, presented to the lord keeper a petition, praying that\r\nthe upper house would join with the lower in a supplication to the queen\r\nfor fixing the succession. Elizabeth, enraged at the bare mention of a\r\nsubject so offensive to her, instantly committed to the Fleet prison\r\nWentworth, sir Thomas Bromley who had seconded him, and two other\r\nmembers to whom he had imparted the business; and when the house was\r\npreparing to petition her for their release, some privy-councillors\r\ndissuaded the step, as one which could only prove injurious to these\r\ngentlemen by giving additional offence to her majesty.\r\n\r\nSoon after, James Morice, an eminent lawyer, who was attorney of the\r\ncourt of Wards and chancellor of the Duchy, made a motion for redress of\r\nthe abuses in the bishops' courts, and especially of the monstrous ones\r\ncommitted under the High Commission. Several members supported the\r\nmotion: but the queen, sending in wrath for the speaker, required him to\r\ndeliver up to her the bill; reminded him of her strict injunctions at\r\nthe opening of the sessions, and testified her extreme indignation and\r\nsurprise at the boldness of the commons in intermeddling with subjects\r\nwhich she had expressly forbidden them to discuss. She informed him,\r\nthat it lay in her power to summon parliaments and to dismiss them; and\r\nto sanction or to reject any determination of theirs; that she had at\r\npresent called them together for the twofold purpose, of enacting\r\nfurther laws for the maintenance of religious conformity, and of\r\nproviding for the national defence against Spain; and that these ought\r\ntherefore to be the objects of their deliberations.\r\n\r\nAs for Morice, he was seized by a serjeant at arms in the house itself,\r\nstripped of his offices, rendered incapable of practising as a lawyer,\r\nand committed to prison, whence he soon after addressed to Burleigh the\r\nfollowing high-minded appeal:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Right honorable my very good lord;\r\n\r\n\"That I am no more hardly handled, I impute next unto God to your\r\nhonorable good will and favor; for although I am assured that the cause\r\nI took in hand is good and honest, yet I believe that, besides your\r\nlordship and that honorable person your son, I have never an honorable\r\nfriend. But no matter; for the best causes seldom find the most friends,\r\nespecially having many, and those mighty, enemies.\r\n\r\n\"I see no cause in my conscience to repent me of that I have done, nor\r\nto be dismayed, although grieved, by this my restraint of liberty; for I\r\nstand for the maintenance of the honor of God and of my prince, and for\r\nthe preservation of public justice and the liberties of my country\r\nagainst wrong and oppression; being well content, at her majesty's good\r\npleasure and commandment, (whom I beseech God long to preserve in all\r\nprincely felicity,) to suffer and abide much more. But I had thought\r\nthat the judges ecclesiastical, being charged in the great council of\r\nthe realm to be dishonorers of God and of her majesty, perverters of\r\nlaw and public justice, and wrong-doers unto the liberties and freedoms\r\nof all her majesty's subjects, by their extorted oaths, wrongful\r\nimprisonments, lawless subscription, and unjust absolutions, would\r\nrather have sought means to be cleared of this weighty accusation, than\r\nto shrowd themselves under the suppressing of the complaint and shadow\r\nof mine imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"There is fault found with me that I, as a private person, preferred not\r\nmy complaint to her majesty. Surely, my lord, your wisdom can conceive\r\nwhat a proper piece of work I had then made of that: The worst prison\r\nhad been I think too good for me, since now (sustaining the person of a\r\npublic counsellor of the realm speaking for her majesty's prerogatives,\r\nwhich by oath I am bound to assist and maintain) I cannot escape\r\ndispleasure and restraint of liberty. Another fault, or error, is\r\nobjected; in that I preferred these causes before the matters delivered\r\nfrom her majesty were determined. My good lord, to have stayed so long,\r\nI verily think, had been to come too late. Bills of assize of bread,\r\nshipping of fish, pleadings, and such like, may be offered and received\r\ninto the house, and no offence to her majesty's royal commandment (being\r\nbut as the tything of mint); but the great causes of the law and public\r\njustice may not be touched without offence. Well, my good lord, be it\r\nso; yet I hope her majesty and you of her honorable privy-council will\r\nat length thoroughly consider of these things, lest, as heretofore we\r\nprayed, From the tyranny of the bishop of Rome, good Lord deliver us,\r\nwe be compelled to say, From the tyranny of the clergy of England, good\r\nLord deliver us.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon my plain speech, I humbly beseech your honor, for it proceedeth\r\nfrom an upright heart and sound conscience, although in a weak and\r\nsickly body: and by God's grace, while life doth last, which I hope now,\r\nafter so many cracks and crazes, will not be long, I will not be ashamed\r\nin good and lawful sort to strive for the freedom of conscience, public\r\njustice, and the liberty of my country. And you, my good lord, to whose\r\nhand the stern of this commonwealth is chiefly committed, I humbly\r\nbeseech, (as I doubt not but you do,) graciously respect both me and the\r\ncauses I have preferred, and be a mean to pacify and appease her\r\nmajesty's displeasure conceived against me her poor, yet faithful,\r\nservant and subject.\" &c.[113]\r\n\r\n[Note 113: Nugae.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn October following, the earl of Essex ventured to mention to her\r\nmajesty this persecuted patriot amongst lawyers qualified for the post\r\nof attorney-general, when \"her majesty acknowledged his gifts, but said\r\nhis speaking against her in such manner as he had done, should be a bar\r\nagainst any preferment at her hands.\" He is said to have been kept for\r\nsome years a prisoner in Tilbury castle; and whether he ever recovered\r\nhis liberty may seem doubtful, since he died in February 1596, aged 48.\r\n\r\nThe house of commons, unacquainted as yet with its own strength,\r\nsubmitted without further question to regard as law the will of an\r\nimperious mistress, and passed with little opposition \"An act to retain\r\nher majesty's subjects in their due obedience,\" which vied in cruelty\r\nwith the noted Six Articles of her tyrannical father.\r\n\r\nBy this law, any person above sixteen who should refuse during a month\r\nto attend the established worship was to be imprisoned; when, should he\r\nfurther persist in his refusal during three months longer, he must\r\nabjure the realm; but in case of his rejecting this alternative, or\r\nreturning from banishment, his offence was declared felony without\r\nbenefit of clergy.\r\n\r\nThe business of supplies was next taken into consideration, and the\r\ncommons voted two subsidies and four fifteenths; but this not appearing\r\nto the ministry sufficient for the exigencies of the state, the peers\r\nwere induced to request a conference with the lower house for the\r\npurpose of proposing the augmentation of the grant to four subsidies and\r\nsix fifteenths. The commons resented at first this interference with\r\ntheir acknowledged privilege of originating all money bills; but dread\r\nof the well-known consequences of offending their superiors, prevailed\r\nat length over their indignation; and first the conference, then the\r\nadditional supply, was acceded to. Some debate, however, arose on the\r\ntime to be allowed for the payment of so heavy an imposition; and the\r\nillustrious Francis Bacon, then member for Middlesex, enlarged upon the\r\ndistresses of the people, and the danger lest the house, by this grant,\r\nshould be establishing a precedent against themselves and their\r\nposterity, in a speech to which his courtly kinsman sir Robert Cecil\r\nreplied with much warmth, and of which her majesty showed a resentful\r\nremembrance on his appearing soon after as a candidate for the office of\r\nattorney-general. His cousin sir Edward Hobby also, whose speeches in\r\nthe former parliament had been ill-received by certain great persons,\r\ntook such a part in some of the questions now at issue between the crown\r\nand the commons, as procured him an imprisonment till the end of the\r\nsessions, when he was at length liberated; \"but not,\" as Anthony Bacon\r\nwrote to his mother, \"without a notable public disgrace laid upon him by\r\nher majesty's royal censure delivered amongst other things, by herself,\r\nafter my lord keeper's speech[114].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 114: Birch's Memoirs, vol. i. p. 96.]\r\n\r\nIn this parting harangue to her parliament, the queen, little touched by\r\nthe unprecedented liberality of the supplies which it had granted her,\r\nand the passing of her favorite bill against the schismatics and\r\nrecusants, animadverted in severe terms on the oppositionists,\r\nreiterated the lofty claims with which she had opened the sessions, and\r\npronounced an eulogium on the justice and moderation of her own\r\ngovernment. She also entered into the grounds of her quarrel with the\r\nking of Spain; showed herself undismayed by the apprehension of any\r\nthing which his once dreaded power could attempt against her; and\r\ncharacteristically added, in adverting to the defeat of the armada, the\r\nfollowing energetic warning: \"I am informed, that when he attempted this\r\nlast invasion, some upon the sea coast forsook their towns, fled up\r\nhigher into the country, and left all naked and exposed to his\r\nentrance. But I swear unto you by God, if I knew those persons, or may\r\nknow hereafter, I will make them know what it is to be fearful in so\r\nurgent a cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Francis Bacon in the house of commons affords a fit\r\noccasion of tracing the previous history of this wonderful man, and of\r\nexplaining his peculiar situation between the two great factions of the\r\ncourt and the influence exerted by this circumstance on his character\r\nand after fortunes. That early promise of his genius which in childhood\r\nattracted the admiring observation of Elizabeth herself, had been\r\nconfirmed by every succeeding year. In the thirteenth of his age, an\r\nearlier period than was even then customary, he was entered, together\r\nwith his elder brother Anthony, of Trinity college Cambridge. At this\r\nseat of learning he remained three years, during which, besides\r\nexhibiting his powers of memory and application by great proficiency in\r\nthe ordinary studies of the place, he evinced the extraordinary\r\nprecocity of his penetrating and original intellect, by forming the\r\nfirst sketch of a new system of philosophy in opposition to that of\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\nHis father, designing him for public life, now sent him to complete his\r\neducation in the house of sir Amias Paulet, the queen's ambassador in\r\nFrance. He gained the confidence of this able and honorable man to such\r\na degree, as to be intrusted by him with a mission to her majesty\r\nrequiring secrecy and dispatch, of which he acquitted himself with great\r\napplause. Returning to France, he engaged in several excursions through\r\nits different provinces, and diligently occupied himself in the\r\ncollection of facts and observations, which he afterwards threw together\r\nin a \"Brief View of the State of Europe;\" a work, however juvenile,\r\nwhich is said to exhibit much both of the peculiar spirit and of the\r\nmethod of its illustrious author. But the death of his father, in 1580,\r\nput an end to his travels, and cast a melancholy blight upon his opening\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\nFor Anthony Bacon, the eldest of his sons by his second marriage, the\r\nlord keeper had handsomely provided by the gift of his manor of\r\nGorhambury, and he had amassed a considerable sum with which he was\r\nabout to purchase another estate for the portion of the younger, when\r\ndeath interrupted his design; and only one-fifth of this money falling\r\nto Francis under the provisions of his father's will, he unexpectedly\r\nfound himself compelled to resort to the practice of some gainful\r\nprofession for his support. That of the law naturally engaged his\r\npreference. He entered himself of Gray's Inn, and passed within its\r\nprecincts several studious years, during which he made himself master of\r\nthe general principles of jurisprudence, as well as of the rules of\r\nlegal practice in his own country; and he also found leisure to trace\r\nthe outlines of his new philosophy in a work not now known to exist in a\r\nseparate state, but incorporated probably in one of his more finished\r\nproductions. In 1588 her majesty, desirous perhaps of encouraging a more\r\nentire devotion of his talents to the study of the law, distinguished\r\nhim by the title of her Counsel extraordinary,--an office of little\r\nemolument, though valuable as an introduction to practice. But the\r\ngenius of Bacon disdained to plod in the trammels of a laborious\r\nprofession; he felt that it was given him for higher and larger\r\npurposes: yet perceiving, at the same time, that the narrowness of his\r\ncircumstances would prove an insuperable bar to his ambition of\r\nbecoming, as he once beautifully expressed it, \"the servant of\r\nposterity,\" he thus, in 1591, solicited the patronage of his uncle lord\r\nBurleigh: \"Again, the meanness of my estate doth somewhat move me; for\r\nthough I cannot accuse myself that I am either prodigal or slothful; yet\r\nmy health is not to spend, nor my course to get: Lastly, I confess that\r\nI have as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate civil ends; for I\r\nhave taken all knowledge to be my province; and if I could purge it of\r\ntwo sorts of rovers, whereof the one with frivolous disputations,\r\nconfutations and verbosities, the other with blind experiments and\r\nauricular traditions and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I\r\nhope I should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions,\r\nand profitable inventions and discoveries, the best state of that\r\nprovince. This, whether it be curiosity, or vain glory, or nature, or,\r\nif one take it favorably, _philanthropia_, is so fixed in my mind as it\r\ncannot be removed. And I do easily see, that place of any reasonable\r\ncountenance doth bring commandment of more wits than a man's own; which\r\nis the thing I do greatly affect.\"\r\n\r\nBurleigh was no philosopher, though a lover of learning, and it could\r\nnot perhaps be expected that he should at once perceive how eminently\r\nworthy was this laborer of the hire which he was reduced to solicit. He\r\ncontented himself therefore with procuring for his kinsman the reversion\r\nof the place of register of the Star-chamber, worth about sixteen\r\nhundred pounds per annum. Of this office however, which might amply have\r\nsatisfied the wants of a student, it was unfortunately near twenty years\r\nbefore Bacon obtained possession; and during this tedious time of\r\nexpectation, he was wont to say, \"that it was like another man's ground\r\nabutting upon his house, which might mend his prospect, but it did not\r\nfill his barn.\" He made however a grateful return to the lord treasurer\r\nfor this instance of patronage, by composing an answer to a popish\r\nlibel, entitled \"A Declaration of the true Causes of the late Troubles,\"\r\nin which he warmly vindicated the conduct of this minister, of his own\r\nfather, and of other members of the administration; not forgetting to\r\nmake a high eulogium on the talents and dispositions of Robert\r\nCecil,--now the most powerful instrument at court to serve or to injure.\r\nUnhappily for the fortunes of Bacon, and in some respects for his moral\r\ncharacter also, this selfish and perfidious statesman was endowed with\r\nsufficient reach of intellect to form some estimate of the transcendent\r\nabilities of his kinsman; and struck with dread or envy, he seems to\r\nhave formed a systematic design of impeding by every art his favor and\r\nadvancement. Unmoved by the eloquent adulation with which Bacon sought\r\nto propitiate his regard, he took all occasions to represent him to the\r\nqueen, and with some degree of justice though more of malice, as a man\r\nof too speculative a turn to apply in earnest to the practical details\r\nof business; one moreover whose head was so filled with abstract and\r\nphilosophical notions, that he would not fail to perplex any public\r\naffairs in which he might be permitted to take a lead. The effect of\r\nthese suggestions on the mind of Elizabeth was greatly aggravated by the\r\nconduct of Bacon in the parliament of 1593, in consequence of which her\r\nmajesty for a considerable time denied him that access to her person\r\nwith which he had hitherto been freely and graciously indulged.\r\n\r\nSome years before this period, Francis Bacon had become known to the\r\nearl of Essex, whose genuine love of merit induced him to offer him his\r\nfriendship and protection. The eagerness with which these were accepted\r\nhad deeply offended the Cecils; and their displeasure was about this\r\ntime increased, on seeing Anthony Bacon, by his brother's persuasion,\r\nenlist himself under the banner of the same political leader.\r\n\r\nAnthony, whose singular history is on many accounts worthy of notice,\r\nwas a man of an inquisitive and crafty turn of mind, and seemingly born\r\nfor a politician. He, like his brother, had been induced to pay a visit\r\nto France, as the completion of a liberal education; and not finding\r\nhimself involved in the same pecuniary difficulties, he had been enabled\r\nto make his abode in that country of much longer duration. From Paris,\r\nwhich he first visited in 1579, he proceeded to Bourges, Geneva,\r\nMontpelier, Marseilles, Montauban and Bordeaux, in each of which cities\r\nhe resided for a considerable length of time. At the latter place he\r\nrendered some services to the protestant inhabitants at great personal\r\nhazard. In 1584 he visited Henry IV., then king of Navarre, at Bearn,\r\nand in 1586 he contracted at Montauban an intimacy with the celebrated\r\nHugonot leader, du Plessis de Mornay. As Anthony Bacon was invested with\r\nno public character, his continued and voluntary abode in a catholic\r\ncountry began at length to excite a suspicion in the mind of his mother,\r\nhis friends, and the queen herself, that his conduct was influenced by\r\nsome secret bias towards the Romish faith;--an impression which received\r\nconfirmation from the intimacies which he cultivated with several\r\nEnglish exiles and pensioners of the king of Spain. This idea appears,\r\nhowever, to have been unfounded. It was often by the express, though\r\nsecret, request of Burleigh that he formed these connexions; and he had\r\nfrequently supplied this minister with important articles of\r\nintelligence procured from such persons, with whom it was by no means\r\nunusual to perform the office of spy to England and to Spain\r\nalternately, or even to both at the same time. At length, the urgency of\r\nhis friends and the clamors of his mother, whose protestant zeal,\r\nsetting a sharper edge on a temper naturally keen, prompted her to\r\nemploy expressions of great violence, compelled him, after many delays,\r\nto quit the continent; and in the beginning of 1592 he returned to his\r\nnative country. His miserable state of health, from the gout and other\r\ndisorders which rendered him a cripple for life, prevented his\r\nencountering the fatigues of the usual court attendance: yet he lost no\r\ntime in procuring a seat in parliament; and his close connexion with the\r\nCecils, joined to the opinion entertained of his political talents,\r\nseems to have excited a general expectation of his rising to high\r\nimportance in the state. But he was not long in discovering, that for\r\nsome unknown reason the lord treasurer was little his friend; and\r\noffended at the coolness with which his secret intelligence from\r\nnumerous foreign correspondents was received by this minister and his\r\nson, in their joint capacity of secretaries of state, he was easily\r\nprevailed upon to address himself to Essex.\r\n\r\nThe earl had by this time learned, that there was no surer mode of\r\nrecommending himself to her majesty, and persuading her of his\r\nextraordinary zeal for her service, than to provide her with a constant\r\nsupply of authentic and early intelligence from the various countries of\r\nEurope, on which she kept a vigilant and jealous eye. He was accordingly\r\noccupied in establishing news-agents in every quarter, and the opportune\r\noffers of Anthony Bacon were accepted by him with the utmost eagerness.\r\nA connexion was immediately established between them, which ripened with\r\ntime into so confidential an intimacy, that in 1595 the earl prevailed\r\non Mr. Bacon to accept of apartments in Essex-house, which he continued\r\nto occupy till commanded by her majesty to quit them on the breaking out\r\nof the last rash enterprise of his patron.\r\n\r\nStruck with the boundless affection manifested by Anthony towards his\r\nbrother, with whom he had established an entire community of interests,\r\nEssex now espoused with more warmth than ever the cause of Francis. He\r\nstrained every nerve to gain for him, in 1592, the situation of\r\nattorney-general: but Burleigh opposed the appointment; Robert Cecil\r\nopenly expressed to the earl his surprise that he should seek to procure\r\nit for \"a raw youth;\" and her majesty declared that, after the manner in\r\nwhich Francis Bacon had stood up against her in parliament, admission to\r\nher presence was the only favor to which he ought to aspire. She added,\r\nthat in her father's time such conduct would have been sufficient to\r\nbanish a man the court for life. Lowering his tone, Essex afterwards\r\nsought for his friend the office of solicitor-general; but the same\r\nprejudices and antipathies still thwarted him: and finding all his\r\nefforts vain to establish him in any public station of honor or\r\nemolument, he nobly compensated his disappointment and relieved his\r\nnecessities by the gift of an estate.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Bacon was neither a courageous nor a lofty one. He too\r\nsoon repented of his generous exertions in the popular cause, and sought\r\nto atone for them by so entire a submission of himself to her majesty,\r\naccompanied with such eloquent professions of duty, humility and\r\nprofound respect, that we can scarcely doubt that a word of solicitation\r\nfrom the lips of Burleigh might have gained him an easy pardon. It is\r\npainful to think that any party jealousies, or any compliance with the\r\nmalignant passions of his son, should so have poisoned the naturally\r\nfriendly and benevolent disposition of this aged minister, that he\r\ncould bear to withhold the offices of kindness from the nephew of his\r\nlate beloved wife, and the son of one of his nearest friends and most\r\ncordial coadjutors in public life. But according to the maxims of\r\ncourt-factions his desertion of the Bacons might be amply\r\njustified;--they had made their election, and it was the patronage of\r\nEssex which they preferred. Experience taught them too late, that for\r\ntheir own interests they had chosen wrong. Since the death of Leicester,\r\nthe Cecils had possessed all the real power at the court of Elizabeth:\r\nthey and they only could advance their adherents. Essex, it is true,\r\nthrough the influence which he exerted over the imagination or the\r\naffections of the queen, could frequently obtain grants to himself of\r\nreal importance and great pecuniary value. But her majesty's singular\r\ncaprice of temper rendered her jealous of every mark of favor extorted\r\nfrom the tender weakness of her heart; and she appears to have almost\r\nmade it a rule to compensate every act of bounty towards himself, by\r\nsome sensible mortification which she made him suffer in the person of a\r\nfriend. So little was his patronage the road to advancement, that sir\r\nThomas Smith, clerk of the council, is recorded as the solitary instance\r\nof a man preferred out of his household to the service of her majesty;\r\nand Bacon himself somewhere says, speaking of the queen, \"Against me she\r\nis never positive but to my lord of Essex.\"\r\n\r\nFulk Greville was one of the few who did honor to themselves by becoming\r\nat this time the advocate of Francis Bacon with the queen; and his\r\nsolicitations were heard by her with such apparent complacency, that he\r\nwrote to Bacon, that he would wager two to one on his chance of becoming\r\nattorney, or at least solicitor-general. But Essex was to be mortified,\r\nand the influence of this generous Maecenas was exerted finally in vain.\r\nTo his unfortunate choice of a patron then, joined to the indiscreet\r\nzeal with which that patron pleaded his cause \"in season and out of\r\nseason,\" we are to ascribe in part the neglect experienced by Bacon\r\nduring the reign of Elizabeth. But other causes concurred, which it may\r\nbe interesting to trace, and which it would be injustice both to the\r\nqueen and to Burleigh to pass over in silence.\r\n\r\nAt the period when Bacon first appealed to the friendship of the lord\r\ntreasurer in the letter above cited, he was already in the thirtieth\r\nyear of his age, and had borne for two years the character of queen's\r\ncounsel extraordinary; but to the courts of law he was so entire a\r\nstranger that it was not till one or two years afterwards that we find\r\nhim pleading his first cause. It was pretty evident therefore in 1592,\r\nwhen he sought the office of attorney-general, that necessity alone had\r\nmade it the object of his wishes; and his known inexperience in the\r\npractice of the law might reasonably justify in the queen and her\r\nministers some scruple of placing him in so responsible a post. As a\r\nphilosopher indeed, no encouragement could exceed his deserts; but this\r\nwas a character which very few even of the learned of that day were\r\ncapable of appretiating. Physical science, disgraced by its alliance\r\nwith the \"blind experiments\" of alchemy and the deluding dreams of\r\njudicial astrology, was in possession of few titles to the respect of\r\nmankind; and its professors,--credulous enthusiasts, for the most part,\r\nor designing impostors,--usually ended by bringing shame and loss on\r\nsuch persons as greedy hopes or vain curiosity bribed to become their\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nThat general \"Instauration\" of the sciences which the mighty genius of\r\nBacon had projected, was a scheme too vast and too profound to be\r\ncomprehended by the minds of Elizabeth and her statesmen; and as it was\r\nnot of a nature to address itself to their passions and interests, we\r\nmust not wonder if they should have regarded it with indifference. At\r\nthis period, too, it existed only in embryo; and so little was the\r\npublic intellect prepared to seize the first hints thrown out by its\r\nillustrious author, that even many years afterwards, when his system had\r\nbeen produced to the world nearly in a state of maturity, the general\r\nsentiment seems pretty much to have corresponded with the judgement of\r\nking James, \"that the philosophy of Bacon was like the peace of God,\r\nwhich passeth all understanding.\"\r\n\r\nAll these considerations, however, are scarcely sufficient to vindicate\r\nthe boasted discernment of Elizabeth from disgrace, in having suffered\r\nthe most illustrious sage of her reign and country, who was at the same\r\ntime its brightest wit and most accomplished orator, known to her from\r\nhis birth, and the son of a wise and faithful servant whose memory she\r\nheld in honor,--to languish in poverty and discouragement; useless to\r\nherself and to the public affairs, and a burthen to his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe king of France found it expedient about this time to declare himself\r\na convert to the church of Rome. For this change of religion, whether\r\nsincere or otherwise, he might plead, not only the personal motive of\r\ngaining possession of the throne of his inheritance, which seemed to be\r\ndenied to him on other terms, but the patriotic one of rescuing his\r\nexhausted country from the miseries of a protracted civil war; and\r\nwhatever might be the decision of a scrupulous moralist on the case, it\r\nis certain that Elizabeth at least had small title to reprobate a\r\ncompliance of which, under the reign of her sister, she had herself set\r\nthe example. But the character of the protestant heroine with which\r\ncircumstances had invested her, obliged her to overlook this\r\ninconsistency; and as demonstrations cost her little, she not only\r\nindicted on the occasion a solemn letter of reproof to her ally, but\r\nactually professed herself so deeply wounded by his dereliction of\r\nprinciple, that it was necessary for her to tranquillize her mind by the\r\nperusal of many pious works, and the study of Boethius on consolation,\r\nwhich she even undertook the task of translating. Essex, whom she\r\nhonored with a sight of her performance, was adroit enough to suggest to\r\nthe royal author, as a principal motive of his urgency with her to\r\nrestore Francis Bacon to her favor, the earnest desire which he felt\r\nthat her majesty's excellent translations should be viewed by those most\r\ncapable of appretiating their merits.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of Elizabeth against Henry's apostasy was not however so\r\nviolent as to exclude the politic consideration, that it was still her\r\ninterest to support the king of France against the king of Spain; and\r\nbesides continuing her wonted supplies, she soon after entered with him\r\ninto a new engagement, purporting that they should never make peace but\r\nby mutual consent.\r\n\r\nBretagne was still the scene of action to the English auxiliaries. Under\r\nsir John Norris, their able commander, they shared in the service of\r\nwresting from the Spaniards, by whom they had been garrisoned, the towns\r\nof Morlaix, Quimpercorentin and Brest; their valor was every where\r\nconspicuous; and the eagerness of the young courtiers of Elizabeth to\r\nshare in the glory of these enterprises rose to a passion, which she\r\nsometimes thought it necessary to repress with a show of severity; as in\r\nthe following instance related by Naunton.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Blount, afterwards lord Montjoy, \"having twice or thrice\r\nstolen away into Bretagne (where under sir John Norris he had then a\r\ncompany) without the queen's leave and privity, she sent a messenger\r\nunto him, with a strict charge to the general to see him sent home. When\r\nhe came into the queen's presence, she fell into a kind of reviling,\r\ndemanding how he durst go over without her leave? 'Serve me so,' quoth\r\nshe, 'once more, and I will lay you fast enough for running; you will\r\nnever leave it until you are knocked on the head, as that inconsiderate\r\nfellow Sidney was. You shall go when I send you, and in the meantime\r\nsee that you lodge in the court,' (which was then at Whitehall) 'where\r\nyou may follow your book, read and discourse of the wars.'\"\r\n\r\nPhilip II., unable to win glory or advantage against Elizabeth in open\r\nand honorable warfare, sought a base revenge upon her by proposing\r\nthrough secret agents vast rewards to any who could be brought to\r\nattempt her destruction. It was no easy task to discover persons\r\nsufficiently rash, as well as wicked, to undertake from motives purely\r\nmercenary a villany of which the peril was so appalling; but at length\r\nFuentes and Ibarra, joint governors of the Netherlands, succeeded in\r\nbribing Dr. Lopez, domestic physician to the queen, to mix poison in her\r\nmedicine. Essex, whose watchfulness over the life of his sovereign was\r\nremarkable, whilst his intelligences were comparable in extent and\r\naccuracy to those of Walsingham himself, was the first to give notice of\r\nthis atrocious plot. At his instance Lopez was apprehended, examined\r\nbefore himself, the treasurer, the lord admiral, and Robert Cecil, and\r\ncommitted to custody in the earl's house. But nothing decisive appearing\r\non his first examination, Robert Cecil took occasion to represent the\r\ncharge as groundless; and her majesty, sending in heat for Essex, called\r\nhim \"rash and temerarious youth,\" and reproached him for bringing on\r\nslight grounds so heinous a suspicion upon an innocent man. The earl,\r\nincensed to find his diligent service thus repaid, through the\r\nsuccessful artifice of his enemy, quitted the presence in a paroxysm of\r\nrage, and, according to his practice on similar occasions, shut himself\r\nup in his chamber, which he refused to quit till the queen herself two\r\nor three days afterwards sent the lord admiral to mediate a\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nFurther interrogatories, mingled probably with menaces of the torture,\r\nbrought Lopez to confess the fact of his having received the king of\r\nSpain's bribe; but he persisted in denying that it was ever in his\r\nthoughts to perpetrate the crime. This subterfuge did not, however, save\r\nhim from an ignominious death, which he shared with two other persons\r\nwhom Fuentes and Ibarra had hired for a similar undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish court disdained to return any satisfactory answer to the\r\ncomplaints of Elizabeth respecting these designs against her life; but\r\neither shame, or more likely the fear of reprisals, seems to have\r\ndeterred it from any repetition of experiments so perilous.\r\n\r\nAbout two years afterwards, however, an English Jesuit named Walpole,\r\nwho was settled in Spain and intimately connected with the noted father\r\nParsons, instigated an attempt worthy of record, partly as a curious\r\ninstance of the exaggerated ideas then prevalent of the force of\r\npoisons. In the last voyage of Drake to the West Indies, a small vessel\r\nof his was captured and carried into a port of Spain, on board of which\r\nwas one Squire, formerly a purveyor for the queen's stables. With this\r\nprisoner Walpole, as a diligent servant of his Church, undertook to make\r\nhimself acquainted; and finding him a resolute fellow, and of capacity\r\nand education above his rank, he spared no pains to convert him to\r\npopery. This step gained, he diligently plied him with his jesuitical\r\narguments, and so thoroughly persuaded him of the duty and merit of\r\npromoting by any kind of means the overthrow of heresy, that Squire at\r\nlength consented to bind himself by a solemn vow to make an attempt\r\nagainst the life of Elizabeth in the mode which should be pointed out to\r\nhim:--an enterprise, as he was assured, which would be attended with\r\nlittle personal danger, and, in case of the worst, would assuredly be\r\nrecompensed by an immediate admission into the joys of heaven.\r\n\r\nFinally the worthy father presented to his disciple a packet of some\r\npoisonous preparation, which he enjoined him to take an opportunity of\r\nspreading on the pommel of the queen's saddle. The queen in mounting\r\nwould transfer the ointment to her hand; with her hand she was likely to\r\ntouch her mouth or nostrils; and such, as he averred, was the virulence\r\nof the poison that certain death must follow.\r\n\r\nSquire returned to England, enlisted for the Cadiz expedition, and on\r\nthe eve of its sailing took the preparation and disposed of it as\r\ndirected. Desirous of adding to his merits, he found means during the\r\nvoyage to anoint in like manner the arms of the earl of Essex's chair.\r\nThe failure of the application in both instances greatly surprised him.\r\nTo the Jesuit it appeared so unaccountable, that he was persuaded Squire\r\nhad deceived him; and actuated at once by the desire of punishing his\r\ndefection, and the fear of his betraying such secrets of the party as\r\nhad been confided to him, he consummated his villany by artfully\r\nconveying to the English government an intimation of the plot. Squire\r\nwas apprehended, and at first denied all: \"but by good counsel, and the\r\ntruth working withal,\" according to Speed's expression, was brought to\r\nconfess what could not otherwise have been proved against him, and\r\nsuffered penitently for his offence. Our chronicler admires the\r\nprovidence which interfered for the protection of her majesty in this\r\ngreat peril, and compares it to the miraculous preservation of St. Paul\r\nfrom the bite of the viper.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits are supposed to have employed more efficacious instruments\r\nfor the destruction of Ferdinando earl of Derby, who died in April 1594.\r\nThis nobleman had the misfortune to be grandson of Eleanor countess of\r\nCumberland, the younger daughter of Mary queen dowager of France and\r\nsister of Henry VIII. by her second husband Charles Brandon duke of\r\nSuffolk; and although the children of lady Catherine Grey countess of\r\nHertford obviously stood before him in this line of succession, occasion\r\nwas taken by the Romish party from this descent to urge him to assume\r\nthe title of king of England. One Hesket, a zealous agent of the Jesuits\r\nand popish fugitives, was employed to tamper with the earl, who on one\r\nhand undertook that his claim should be supported by powerful succours\r\nfrom abroad, and on the other menaced him with certain and speedy death\r\nin case of his rejecting the proposal or betraying its authors. But the\r\nearl was too loyal to hesitate a moment. He revealed the whole plot to\r\ngovernment, and Hesket on his information was convicted of treason and\r\nsuffered death. Not long after, the earl was suddenly seized with a\r\nviolent disorder of the bowels, which in a few days carried him off; and\r\non the first day of his illness, his gentleman of the horse took his\r\nlord's best saddle-horse and fled. These circumstances might be thought\r\npretty clearly to indicate poison as the means of his untimely end: but\r\nalthough a suspicion of its employment was entertained by some, the\r\nmelancholy event appears to have been more generally ascribed to\r\nwitchcraft. An examination being instituted, a waxen image was\r\ndiscovered in his chamber with a hair of the color of the earl's drawn\r\nthrough the body; also, an old woman in the neighbourhood, a reputed\r\nwitch, being required to recite after a prompter the Lord's Prayer in\r\nLatin, was observed to blunder repeatedly in the same words. But these\r\ncircumstances, however strong, not being deemed absolutely conclusive,\r\nthe poor old woman was apparently suffered to escape:--after the\r\ngentleman of the horse, or his instigators, we do not find that any\r\nsearch was made.\r\n\r\nThe mother of this earl of Derby died two years after. At one period of\r\nher life we find her much in favor with the queen, whom she was\r\naccustomed to attend in quality of first lady of the blood-royal; but\r\nshe had subsequently excited her majesty's suspicions by her imprudent\r\nconsultations of fortune-tellers and diviners, on the delicate subject,\r\ndoubtless, of succession to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe animosity between Elizabeth and her savage adversary the king of\r\nSpain was continually becoming more fierce and more inveterate.\r\nUndeterred by former failures, Philip was thought to meditate a fresh\r\ninvasion either of England or of Ireland, which latter country was\r\nbesides in so turbulent a state from the insurrections of native\r\nchieftains, that it had been found necessary to send over sir John\r\nNorris as general of Ulster, with a strong reinforcement of veterans\r\nfrom the Low Countries. The queen, on her part, was well prepared to\r\nresist and retaliate all attacks. The spirit of the nation was\r\nthoroughly roused; gallant troops and able officers formed in the\r\nFlemish school of glory, or under the banners of the Bourbon hero,\r\nburned with impatience for the signal to revenge the wrongs of their\r\nqueen and country on their capital and most detested enemy. Still the\r\nconflict threatened to be an arduous one: Elizabeth felt all its\r\ndifficulties; and loth to lose the support of one of her bravest and\r\nmost popular captains, she addressed the following letter of recall to\r\nlord Willoughby, who had repaired to Spa ostensibly for the recovery of\r\nhis health; really, perhaps, in resentment of some injury inflicted by a\r\nvenal and treacherous court, of which his noble nature scorned alike the\r\nintrigues and the servility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Good Peregrine,\r\n\r\n\"We are not a little glad that by your journey you have received such\r\ngood fruit of amendment, especially when we consider how great a\r\nvexation it is to a mind devoted to actions of honor, to be restrained\r\nby any indisposition of body from following those courses which, to your\r\nown reputation and our great satisfaction, you have formerly performed.\r\nAnd therefore we must now (out of our desire of your well-doing)\r\nchiefly enjoin you to an especial care to encrease and continue your\r\nhealth, which must give life to all your best endeavours; so we next as\r\nseriously recommend to you this consideration, that in these times, when\r\nthere is such an appearance that we shall have the trial of our best and\r\nnoble subjects, you seem not to affect the satisfaction of your own\r\nprivate contentation, beyond the attending on that which nature and duty\r\nchallengeth from all persons of your quality and profession. For if\r\nunnecessarily, your health of body being recovered, you should elloign\r\nyourself by residence there from those employments whereof we shall have\r\ntoo good store, you shall not so much amend the state of your body, as\r\nhaply you shall call in question the reputation of your mind and\r\njudgement, even in the opinion of those that love you, and are best\r\nacquainted with your disposition and discretion.\r\n\r\n\"Interpret this our plainness, we pray you, to an extraordinary\r\nestimation of you, for it is not common with us to deal so freely with\r\nmany; and believe that you shall ever find us both ready and willing, on\r\nall occasions, to yield you the fruits of that interest which your\r\nendeavours have purchased for you in our opinion and estimation. Not\r\ndoubting but when you have with moderation made trial of the successes\r\nof these your sundry peregrinations, you will find as great comfort to\r\nspend your days at home as heretofore you have done; of which we do wish\r\nyou full measure, howsoever you shall have cause of abode or return.\r\nGiven under our signet at our manor of Nonesuch, the 7th of October\r\n1594, in the 37th year of our reign.\r\n\r\n\"Your most loving sovereign\r\n\r\n\"E. R.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe do not perceive the effects of this letter in the employment of lord\r\nWilloughby in any of the expeditions against Spain which ensued; but he\r\nwas afterwards appointed governor of Berwick, and held that situation\r\ntill his death in 1601.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, that splendid genius with a sordid soul, whom a\r\nromantic spirit of adventure and a devouring thirst of gain equally\r\nstimulated to activity, had unexpectedly found his advancement at court\r\nimpeded, after the first steps, usually accounted the most difficult,\r\nhad been speedily and fortunately surmounted. Several conspiring causes\r\nmight however be assigned for this check in his career of fortune. His\r\nhigh pretensions to the favor of the queen, joined to his open adherence\r\nto the party of sir Robert Cecil, had provoked the hostility of Essex;\r\nwho, in defiance of him, at one of the ostentatious tournaments of the\r\nday, is said to have \"filled the tilt-yard with two thousand\r\norange-tawny feathers,\" the distinction doubtless of his followers and\r\nretainers. He had incurred the resentment of more than one of the order\r\nof bishops, by his ceaseless and shameless solicitations of grants and\r\nleases out of the property of the Church. In Ireland, he had rendered\r\nsir William Russell the lord deputy his enemy by various demonstrations\r\nof opposition and rivalry; at court, his abilities and his first rapid\r\nsuccesses with her majesty had stirred up against him the envy of a\r\nwhole host of competitors. Elizabeth, who for the best reasons had an\r\nextreme dislike to any manifestations of a mercenary disposition in her\r\nservants, had been disgusted by the frequency and earnestness of his\r\npetitions for pecuniary favors. \"When, sir Walter,\" she had once\r\nexclaimed, \"will you cease to be a beggar?\" He replied, \"When your\r\ngracious majesty ceases to be a benefactor.\" So dexterous an answer\r\nappeased her for a time; and the profusion of eloquent adulation with\r\nwhich he never failed to soothe her ear, engaged her self-love strongly\r\nin his behalf. But to complete the ill-fortune of Raleigh, father\r\nParsons, provoked by the earnestness with which he had urged in\r\nparliament the granting of supplies for a war offensive and defensive\r\nagainst Spain, had published a pamphlet charging him with atheism and\r\nimpiety, which had not only found welcome reception with his enemies,\r\nbut with the people, to whom he was ever obnoxious, and had even raised\r\na prejudice against him in the mind of his sovereign. On this subject, a\r\nwriter contemporary with the later years of Raleigh thus expresses\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Walter Raleigh was the first, as I have heard, that ventured to\r\ntack about and sail aloof from the beaten track of the schools; who,\r\nupon the discovery of so apparent an error as a torrid zone, intended to\r\nproceed in an inquisition after more solid truths; till the mediation of\r\nsome whose livelihood lay in hammering shrines for this superannuated\r\nstudy, possessed queen Elizabeth that such doctrine was against God no\r\nless than her father's honor; whose faith, if he owed any, was grounded\r\nupon school divinity. Whereupon she chid him, who was, by his own\r\nconfession, ever after branded with the name of an atheist, though a\r\nknown assertor of God and providence[115].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 115: Osborne's \"Introduction\" to his Essays.]\r\n\r\nThe business of Mrs. Throgmorton, and the disputes arising out of the\r\nsale of the captured carrack, succeeded, to inflame still more the\r\nill-humour of the queen; and Raleigh, finding every thing adverse to him\r\nat court, resolved to quit the scene for a time, in the hope of\r\nreturning with better omens, when absence and dangers should again have\r\nendeared him to his offended mistress, and when the splendor of his\r\nforeign successes might enable him to impose silence on the clamors of\r\nmalignity at home.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the pathless wilds of Guiana had been reported to abound\r\nin those exhaustless mines of the precious metals which filled the\r\nimaginations of the earliest explorers of the New World, and, to their\r\nignorant cupidity, appeared the only important object of research and\r\nacquisition in regions where the eye of political wisdom would have\r\ndiscerned so many superior inducements to colonization or to conquest.\r\nThe fabulous city of El Dorado,--which became for some time proverbial\r\nin our language to express the utmost profusion and magnificence of\r\nwealth,--was placed by the romantic narrations of voyagers somewhere in\r\nthe centre of this vast country, and nothing could be more flattering to\r\nthe mania of the age than the project of exploring its hidden\r\ntreasures. Raleigh conceived this idea; the court and the city vied in\r\neagerness to share the profits of the enterprise; a squadron was\r\nspeedily fitted out, though at great expense; and in February 1595 the\r\nardent leader weighed anchor from the English shore. Proceeding first to\r\nTrinidad, he possessed himself of the town of St. Joseph; then, with the\r\nnumerous pinnaces of his fleet, he entered the mouth of the great river\r\nOronoco, and sailing upwards penetrated far into the bosom of the\r\ncountry. But the intense heat of the climate, and the difficulties of\r\nthis unknown navigation, compelled him to return without any more\r\nvaluable result of his enterprise than that of taking formal possession\r\nof the land in her majesty's name. Raleigh however, unwilling to\r\nacknowledge a failure, published on his return an account of Guiana,\r\nfilled with the most disgraceful and extravagant falsehoods;--falsehoods\r\nto which he himself became eventually the victim, when, on the sole\r\ncredit of his assurances, king James released him from a tedious\r\nimprisonment to head a second band of adventurers to this disastrous\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nA still more unfortunate result awaited an expedition of greater\r\nconsequence, which sailed during the same year, under Hawkins and Drake,\r\nagainst the settlements of Spanish America. Repeated attacks had at\r\nlength taught the Spaniards to stand on their defence; and the English\r\nwere first repulsed from Porto Rico, and afterwards obliged to\r\nrelinquish the attempt of marching across the isthmus of Darien to\r\nPanama. But the great and irreparable misfortune of the enterprise was\r\nthe loss, first of the gallant sir John Hawkins, the kinsman and early\r\npatron of Drake, and afterwards of that great navigator himself, who\r\nfell a victim to the torrid climate, and to fatigue and mortification\r\nwhich conspired to render it fatal. A person of such eminence, and whose\r\ngreat actions reflect back so bright a lustre on the reign which had\r\nfurnished to him the most glorious occasions of distinguishing himself\r\nin the service of his country, must not be dismissed from the scene in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe character of Francis Drake was remarkable not alone for those\r\nconstitutional qualities of valor, industry, capacity and enterprise,\r\nwhich the history of his exploits would necessarily lead us to infer,\r\nbut for virtues founded on principle and reflection which render it in a\r\nhigh degree the object of respect and moral approbation. It is true that\r\nhis aggressions on the Spanish settlements were originally founded on a\r\nvague notion of reprisals, equally irreconcilable to public law and\r\nprivate equity. But with the exception of this error,--which may find\r\nconsiderable palliation in the deficient education of the man, the\r\nprevalent opinions of the day, and the peculiar animosity against Philip\r\nII. cherished in the bosom of every protestant Englishman,--the conduct\r\nof Drake appears to demand almost unqualified commendation. It was by\r\nsobriety, by diligence in the concerns of his employers, and by a tried\r\nintegrity, that he early raised himself from the humble station of an\r\nordinary seaman to the command of a vessel. When placed in authority\r\nover others, he showed himself humane and considerate; his treatment of\r\nhis prisoners was exemplary, his veracity unimpeached, his private life\r\nreligiously pure and spotless. In the division of the rich booty which\r\noften rewarded his valor and his toils, he was liberal towards his crews\r\nand scrupulously just to the owners of his vessels; and in the\r\nappropriation of his own share of wealth, he displayed that munificence\r\ntowards the public, of which, since the days of Roman glory, history has\r\nrecorded so few examples.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of one of his earliest voyages, in which he captured\r\nthe town of Venta Cruz and made prize of a string of fifty mules laden\r\nwith silver, he fitted out three stout frigates and sailed with them to\r\nIreland, where he served as a volunteer under Walter earl of Essex, and\r\nperformed many brilliant actions. After the capture of a rich Spanish\r\ncarrack at the Terceras in 1587, he undertook at his own expense to\r\nbring to the town of Plymouth, which he represented in parliament, a\r\nsupply of spring water, of which necessary article it suffered a great\r\ndeficiency; this he accomplished by means of a canal or aqueduct above\r\ntwenty miles in length.\r\n\r\nDrake incurred some blame in the expedition to Portugal for failing to\r\nbring his ships up the river to Lisbon, according to his promise to sir\r\nJohn Norris, the general; but on explaining the case before the\r\nprivy-council on his return, he was entirely acquitted by them; having\r\nmade it appear that, under all the circumstances, to have carried the\r\nfleet up the Tagus would have been to expose it to damage without the\r\npossibility of any benefit to the service. By his enemies, this great\r\nman was stigmatized as vain and boastful; a slight infirmity in one who\r\nhad achieved so much by his own unassisted genius, and which the great\r\nflow of natural eloquence which he possessed may at once have produced\r\nand rendered excusable. One trait appears to indicate that he was\r\nambitious of a species of distinction which he might have regarded\r\nhimself as entitled to despise. He had thought proper to assume,\r\napparently without due authority, the armorial coat of sir Bernard\r\nDrake, also a seaman and a native of Devonshire: sir Bernard, from a\r\nfalse pride of family, highly resented this unwarrantable intrusion, as\r\nhe regarded it, and in a dispute on the subject gave sir Francis a box\r\non the ear. The queen now deemed it necessary to interfere, and she\r\ngranted to the illustrious navigator the following arms of her own\r\ndevice. _Sable, a fess wavy between two pole stars argent_, and for\r\ncrest, _a ship on a globe under ruff_, with a cable held by a hand\r\ncoming out of the clouds; the motto _Auxilio divino_, and beneath, _Sic\r\nparvis magna_; in the rigging of the ship _a wivern gules_, the arms of\r\nsir Bernard Drake, _hung up by the heels_.\r\n\r\nSir John Baskerville, who succeeded by the death of Drake to the command\r\nof the unfortunate expedition to which he had fallen a sacrifice,\r\nencountered the Spanish fleet off Cuba in an action, which, though less\r\ndecisive on the English side than might have been hoped, left at least\r\nno ground of triumph to the enemy. Meantime the court was by no means\r\nbarren of incident; and we are fortunate in possessing a minute and\r\nauthentic journal of its transactions in a series of letters addressed\r\nto sir Robert Sidney governor of Flushing by several of his friends,\r\nbut chiefly by Rowland Whyte, a gentleman to whom, during his absence,\r\nhe had recommended the care of his interests, and the task of\r\ntransmitting to him whatever intelligence might appear either useful or\r\nentertaining[116].\r\n\r\n[Note 116: See Sidney Papers, _passim._]\r\n\r\nIn October 1595 Mr. Whyte mentions the following abominable instance of\r\ntyranny. That the earl of Hertford had been sent for by a messenger and\r\ncommitted to custody in his own house, because it had appeared by a case\r\nfound among the papers of a Dr. Aubrey, that he had formerly taken the\r\nopinions of civilians on the validity of his first marriage, and caused\r\na record of it to be secretly put into the court of Arches. Whyte adds\r\nsignificantly, that the earl was accounted one of the wealthiest\r\nsubjects in England. Soon after, his lordship was committed to the\r\nTower; and it was said that orders were given that his son, who since\r\nthe establishment of the marriage had borne the title of lord Beauchamp,\r\nshould henceforth be again called Mr. Seymour. Several lawyers and other\r\npersons were also imprisoned for a short time about this matter, under\r\nwhat law, or pretext of law, it would be vain to inquire. Lady Hertford,\r\nthough a sister of the lord admiral and nearly related to the queen, was\r\nfor some time an unsuccessful suitor at court for the liberty of her\r\nlord. Her majesty however was graciously pleased to declare that\r\n\"neither his life nor living should be called in question;\"--as if both\r\nhad been at her mercy! and though she would not consent to see the\r\ncountess, she regularly sent her broths in a morning, and, at meals,\r\nmeat from her own trencher;--affecting, it should seem, in these\r\ntrifles, to acquit herself of the promises of her special favor, with\r\nwhich she had a few years before repaid the splendid hospitality of this\r\nnoble pair. We do not learn how long the durance of the earl continued;\r\nbut it is highly probable that he was once more compelled to purchase\r\nhis liberty.\r\n\r\nGreat uneasiness was given about this time to the earl of Essex by a\r\nbook written in defence of the king of Spain's title to the English\r\ncrown, which contained \"dangerous praises of his valor and worthiness,\"\r\ninserted for the express purpose of exciting the jealousy of the queen\r\nand bringing him into disgrace. The work was shown him by Elizabeth\r\nherself. On coming from her presence he was observed to look \"pale and\r\nwan,\" and going home he reported himself sick;--an expedient for working\r\non the feelings of his sovereign, to which, notwithstanding the truth\r\nand honor popularly regarded as his characteristics, Essex is known to\r\nhave frequently condescended. On this, as on most occasions, he found it\r\nsuccessful: her majesty soon made him a consolatory visit; and in spite\r\nof the strenuous efforts of his enemies, this attempt to injure him only\r\nserved to augment her affection and root him more firmly in her\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"Her majesty,\" says Whyte soon after, \"is in very good health, and comes\r\nmuch abroad; upon Thursday she dined at Kew, at my lord keeper's house,\r\n(who lately obtained of her majesty his suit for one hundred pounds a\r\nyear in fee-farm,) her entertainment for that meal was great and\r\nexceeding costly. At her first lighting she had a fine fan garnished\r\nwith diamonds, valued at four hundred pounds at least. After dinner, in\r\nher privy-chamber, he gave her a fair pair of virginals. In her\r\nbed-chamber, he presented her with a fine gown and a juppin, which\r\nthings were pleasing to her highness; and, to grace his lordship the\r\nmore, she of herself took from him a fork, a spoon, and a salt, of fair\r\nagate.\" It must be confessed that this was a mode of \"gracing\" a\r\ncourtier peculiarly consonant to the disposition of her majesty.\r\n\r\nThe further Elizabeth descended into the vale of years, the stronger\r\nwere her efforts to make ostentation of a youthful gaiety of spirits and\r\nan unfailing alacrity in the pursuit of pleasure; though avarice, the\r\nvice of age, mingled strangely with these her juvenile affectations. To\r\nremark to her the progress of time, was to wound her in the tenderest\r\npart, and not even from her ghostly counsellors would she endure a topic\r\nso offensive as the mention of her age: an anecdote to this effect\r\nbelongs to the year 1596, and is found in the account of Rudd bishop of\r\nSt. Davids given in Harrington's Brief View of the Church.\r\n\r\n\"There is almost none that waited in queen Elizabeth's court and\r\nobserved any thing, but can tell that it pleased her very much to seem,\r\nto be thought, and to be told that she looked young. The majesty and\r\ngravity of a sceptre borne forty-four years could not alter that nature\r\nof a woman in her: This notwithstanding, this good bishop being\r\nappointed to preach before her in the Lent of the year 1596... wishing\r\nin a godly zeal, as well became him, that she should think sometime of\r\nmortality,\" took a text fit for the purpose, on which he treated for a\r\ntime \"well,\" \"learnedly,\" and \"respectively.\" \"But when he had spoken\r\nawhile of some sacred and mystical numbers, as three for the Trinity,\r\nthree for the heavenly Hierarchy, seven for the Sabbath, and seven times\r\nseven for a Jubilee; and lastly,--seven times nine for the grand\r\nclimacterical year; she, perceiving whereto it tended, began to be\r\ntroubled with it. The bishop discovering that all was not well, for the\r\npulpit stands there _vis a vis_ to the closet, he fell to treat of some\r\nmore plausible numbers, as of the number 666, making _Latinus_, with\r\nwhich he said he could prove the pope to be Antichrist; also of the\r\nfatal number of 88,--so long before spoken of for a dangerous year,...\r\nbut withal interlarding it with some passages of Scripture that touch\r\nthe infirmities of age... he concluded his sermon. The queen, as the\r\nmanner was, opened the window; but she was so far from giving him thanks\r\nor good countenance, that she said plainly he should have kept his\r\narithmetic for himself. 'But I see,' said she, 'the greatest clerks are\r\nnot the wisest men;' and so went away for the time discontented.\r\n\r\n\"The lord keeper Puckering, though reverencing the man much in his\r\nparticular, yet for the present, to assuage the queen's displeasure,\r\n_commanded him to keep his house for a time_, which he did. But of a\r\ntruth her majesty showed no ill nature in this, for within three days\r\nshe was not only displeased at his restraint, but in my hearing rebuked\r\na lady yet living for speaking scornfully of him and his sermon. Only\r\nto show how the good bishop was deceived in supposing she was so decayed\r\nin her limbs and senses as himself perhaps and other of that age were\r\nwont to be; she said she thanked God that neither her stomach nor\r\nstrength, nor her voice for singing, nor fingering instruments, nor,\r\nlastly, her sight, was any whit decayed; and to prove the last before us\r\nall, she produced a little jewel that had an inscription of very small\r\nletters, and offered it first to my lord of Worcester, and then to sir\r\nJames Crofts to read, and both protested _bona fide_ that they could\r\nnot; yet the queen herself did find out the poesy, and made herself\r\nmerry with the standers by upon it.\"\r\n\r\nA point of some importance to the peers of England was about this time\r\nbrought to a final decision by the following circumstance. Sir Thomas,\r\nson and heir of sir Matthew Arundel of Wardour-castle, a young man of a\r\ncourageous and enterprising disposition, going over to Germany, had been\r\ninduced to engage as a volunteer in the wars of the emperor against the\r\nTurks; and in the assault of the city of Gran in Hungary had taken with\r\nhis own hand a Turkish banner. For this and other good service, Rodolph\r\nthe Second had been pleased to confer upon him the honor of count of the\r\nholy Roman empire, extending also, as usual, the title of counts and\r\ncountesses to all his descendants for ever. On his return to England in\r\nthe year following, the question arose whether this dignity, conferred\r\nby a foreign prince without the previous consent of his own sovereign,\r\nshould entitle the bearer to rank, precedence, or any other privilege\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nThe peers naturally opposed a concession which tended to lessen the\r\nvalue of their privileges by rendering them accessible through foreign\r\nchannels; and her majesty, being called upon to settle the debate,\r\npronounced the following judgement. That the closest tie of affection\r\nsubsisted between sovereigns and their subjects: that as chaste wives\r\nshould fix their eyes upon their husbands alone, in like manner faithful\r\nsubjects should only direct theirs towards the prince whom it had\r\npleased God to set over them. And that she would not allow her sheep to\r\nbe branded with the mark of a stranger, or be taught to follow the\r\nwhistle of a foreign shepherd. And to this effect she wrote to the\r\nemperor, who by a special letter had recommended sir Thomas Arundel to\r\nher favor. The decision appears to have been reasonable and politic, and\r\nwould at the time be regarded as peculiarly so in the instance of honors\r\nconferred on a catholic gentleman by a catholic prince. King James,\r\nhowever, created sir Thomas, lord Arundel of Wardour; and he seems to\r\nhave borne in common speech, the title of count[117].\r\n\r\n[Note 117: Camden's Annals. Peerage, by Sir E. Brydges.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n1595 to 1598.\r\n\r\nEssex and Cecil factious--Expedition to Cadiz.--Robert Cecil appointed\r\nsecretary.--Notice of sir T. Bodley.--Critical situation of\r\nEssex.--Francis Bacon addresses to him a letter of advice--composes\r\nspeeches for him.--Notice of Toby Matthew.--Outrages in London repressed\r\nby martial law.--Death of lord Hunsdon--of the earl of Huntingdon--of\r\nbishop Fletcher.--Anecdote of bishop Vaughan.--Book on the queen's\r\ntouching for the evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this period nearly of the reign of Elizabeth, her court exhibited a\r\nscene of perpetual contest between the faction of the earl of Essex and\r\nthat of lord Burleigh, or rather of Robert Cecil; and so widely did the\r\neffects of this intestine division extend, that there was perhaps\r\nscarcely a single court-attendant or public functionary whose interests\r\ndid not become in some mode or other involved in the debate. Yet the\r\nquarrel itself may justly be regarded as base and contemptible; no\r\npublic principle was here at stake; whether religious, as in the\r\nstruggles between papists and protestants which often rent the cabinet\r\nof Henry VIII.; or civil, as in those of whigs and tories by which the\r\nadministrations of later times have been divided and overthrown. It was\r\nsimply and without disguise a strife between individuals, for the\r\nexclusive possession of that political power and court influence of\r\nwhich each might without disturbance have enjoyed a share capable of\r\ncontenting an ordinary ambition.\r\n\r\nIn religion there was apparently no shade of difference between the\r\nhostile leaders; neither of them had studied with so little diligence\r\nthe inclinations of the queen as to persist at this time in the\r\npatronage of the puritans, though the early impressions, certainly of\r\nEssex and probably of sir Robert Cecil also, must have been considerably\r\nin favor of this persecuted sect. Still less would either venture to\r\nstand forth the advocate of the catholics; though it was among the most\r\ndaring and desperate of this body that Essex was compelled at length to\r\nseek adherents, when the total ruin of his interest with his sovereign\r\nfatally compelled him to exchange the character of head of a court party\r\nfor that of a conspirator and a rebel. Of the title of the king of Scots\r\nboth were steady supporters; and first Essex and afterwards Cecil\r\nmaintained a secret correspondence with James, who flattered each in his\r\nturn with assurances of present friendship and future favor.\r\n\r\nOn one public question alone of any considerable magnitude do the rivals\r\nappear to have been at issue;--that of the prosecution of an offensive\r\nwar against Spain.\r\n\r\nThe age and the wisdom of lord Burleigh alike inclined him to a pacific\r\npolicy; and though Robert Cecil, for the purpose of strengthening\r\nhimself and weakening his opponent, would frequently act the patron\r\ntowards particular officers,--those especially of whom he observed the\r\nearl to entertain a jealousy,--it is certain that warlike ardor made no\r\npart of his natural composition. Essex on the contrary was all on fire\r\nfor military glory; and at this time he was urging the queen with\r\nunceasing importunities to make a fresh attack upon her capital enemy in\r\nthe heart of his European dominions. In this favorite object, after\r\nencountering considerable opposition from her habits of procrastination\r\nand from some remaining fears and scruples, he succeeded; and the zeal\r\nof the people hastening to give full effect to the designs of her\r\nmajesty, a formidable armament was fitted out in all diligence, which in\r\nJune 1596 set sail for Cadiz.\r\n\r\nLord Howard of Effingham, as lord admiral, commanded the fleet; Essex\r\nhimself received with transport the appointment of general of all the\r\nland-forces, and spared neither pains nor cost in his preparations for\r\nthe enterprise. Besides his constant eagerness for action, his spirit\r\nwas on this occasion inflamed by an indignation against the tyrant\r\nPhilip, \"which rose,\" according to the happy expression of one of his\r\nbiographers, \"to the dignity of a personal aversion[118].\" In his\r\nletters he was wont to employ the expression, \"I will make that proud\r\nking know\" &c.: a phrase, it seems, which gave high offence to\r\nElizabeth, who could not tolerate what she regarded as arrogance against\r\na crowned head, though her bitterest foe.\r\n\r\n[Note 118: See A Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors, by lord\r\nOrford.]\r\n\r\nSubordinate commands were given to lord Thomas Howard, second son of the\r\nlate duke of Norfolk, who was at this time inclined to the party of\r\nEssex; to Raleigh, who now affected an extraordinary deference for the\r\nearl, his secret enemy and rival; to that very able officer sir Francis\r\nVere of the family of the earls of Oxford, who had highly distinguished\r\nhimself during several years in the wars of the Low Countries; to sir\r\nGeorge Carew, an intimate friend of sir Robert Cecil; and to some\r\nothers, who formed together a council of war.\r\n\r\nThe queen herself composed on this occasion a prayer for the use of the\r\nfleet, and she sent to her land and her sea commander jointly \"a letter\r\nof license to depart; besides comfortable encouragement.\" \"But ours in\r\nparticular,\" adds a follower of Essex, \"had one fraught with all kind of\r\npromises and loving offers, as the like, since he was a favorite, he\r\nnever had.\"\r\n\r\nEnterprise was certainly not the characteristic of the lord admiral as a\r\ncommander; and when on the arrival of the armament off Cadiz, it was\r\nproposed that an attack should be made by the fleet on the ships in the\r\nharbour, he remonstrated against the rashness of such an attempt, and\r\nprevailed on several members of the council of war to concur in his\r\nobjections. In the end, however, the arguments or importunities of the\r\nmore daring party prevailed; and Essex threw his hat into the sea in a\r\nwild transport of joy on learning that the admiral consented to make the\r\nattack. He was now acquainted by the admiral with the queen's secret\r\norder, dictated by her tender care for the safety of her young\r\nfavorite,--that he should by no means be allowed to lead the\r\nassault;--and he promised an exact obedience to the mortifying\r\nprohibition. But, once in presence of the enemy, his impetuosity would\r\nbrook no control. He broke from the station of inglorious security which\r\nhad been assigned him, and rushed into the heat of the action.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish fleet was speedily driven up the harbour, under the guns of\r\nthe fort of Puntal, where the admiral's ship and another first-rate were\r\nset on fire by their own crews, and the rest run aground. Of these, two\r\nfine ships fell into the hands of the English; and the lord admiral\r\nhaving refused to accept of any ransom for the remainder, saying that he\r\ncame to consume and not to compound, they were all, to the number of\r\nfifty, burned by the Spanish admiral.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Essex landed his men and marched them to the assault of Cadiz.\r\nThe town was on this side well fortified, and the defenders, having also\r\nthe advantage of the ground, received the invaders so warmly that they\r\nwere on the point of being repulsed from the gate against which they had\r\ndirected their attack: but Essex, just at the critical moment, rushed\r\nforward, seized his own colors and threw them over the wall; \"giving\r\nwithal a most hot assault unto the gate, where, to save the honor of\r\ntheir ensign, happy was he that could first leap down from the wall and\r\nwith shot and sword make way through the thickest press of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe town being thus stormed, was of course given up to plunder; but\r\nEssex, whose humanity was not less conspicuous than his courage, put an\r\nimmediate stop to the carnage by a vigorous exertion of his authority;\r\nprotected in person the women, children, and religious, whom he caused\r\nto retire to a place of safety; caused the prisoners to be treated with\r\nthe utmost tenderness; and allowed all the citizens to withdraw, on\r\npayment of a ransom, before the place with its fortifications was\r\ncommitted to the flames. It was indeed the wish and intention of Essex\r\nto have kept possession of Cadiz; which he confidently engaged to the\r\ncouncil of war to hold out against the Spaniards, with a force of no\r\nmore than three or four thousand men, till succours could be sent from\r\nEngland; and with this view he had in the first instance sedulously\r\npreserved the buildings from all injury. But among his brother officers\r\nfew were found prepared to second his zeal: the expedition was in great\r\nmeasure an adventure undertaken at the expense of private persons, who\r\nengaged in it with the hope of gain rather than glory; and as these men\r\nprobably attributed the success which had hitherto crowned their arms in\r\ngreat measure to the surprise of the Spaniards, they were unwilling to\r\nrisk in a more deliberate contest the rich rewards of valor of which\r\nthey had possessed themselves.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent proposals of Essex for the annoyance of the enemy, either\r\nby an attack on Corunna, or on St. Sebastian and St. Andero, or by\r\nsailing to the Azores in quest of the homeward-bound carracks, all\r\nexperienced the same mortifying negative from the members of the council\r\nof war, of whom lord Thomas Howard alone supported his opinions. But\r\nundeterred by this systematic opposition, he persevered in urging, that\r\nmore might and more ought to be performed by so considerable an\r\narmament; and the lord admiral, weary of contesting the matter, sailed\r\naway at length and left him on the Spanish coast with the few ships and\r\nthe handful of men which still adhered to him. Want of provisions\r\ncompelled him in a short time to abandon an enterprise now desperate;\r\nand he returned full of indignation to England, where fresh struggles\r\nand new mortifications awaited him. The appointment during his absence\r\nof Robert Cecil to the office of secretary of state, instead of Thomas\r\nBodley, afterwards the founder of the library which preserves his\r\nname,--for whom, since he had found the restoration of Davison hopeless,\r\nEssex had been straining every nerve to procure it,--gave him ample\r\nwarning of all the counteraction on other points which he was doomed to\r\nexperience; and was in fact the circumstance which finally established\r\nthe ascendency of his adversaries: yet to an impartial eye many\r\nconsiderations may appear to have entirely justified on the part of the\r\nqueen this preference. Where, it might be asked, could a fitter\r\nsuccessor be found to lord Burleigh in the post which he had so long\r\nfilled to the satisfaction of his sovereign and the benefit of his\r\ncountry, than in the son who certainly inherited all his\r\nability;--though not, as was afterwards seen, his principles or his\r\nvirtues;--and who had been trained to business as the assistant of his\r\nfather and under his immediate inspection? Why should the earl of Essex\r\ninterfere with an order of things so natural? On what pretext should the\r\nqueen be induced to disappoint the hopes of her old and faithful\r\nservant, and to cast a stigma upon a young man of the most promising\r\ntalents, who was unwearied in his efforts to establish himself in her\r\nfavor?\r\n\r\nBy the queen and the people, Essex, their common favorite, was welcomed,\r\non his safe return from an expedition to himself so glorious, with every\r\ndemonstration of joy and affection, and no one appeared to sympathize\r\nmore cordially than her majesty in his indignation that nothing had been\r\nattempted against the Spanish treasure-ships. On the other hand, no\r\npains were spared by his adversaries to lessen in public estimation the\r\nglory of his exploits, by ascribing to the naval commanders a principal\r\nshare in the success at Cadiz, which he accounted all his own. An\r\nanonymous narrative of the expedition which he had prepared, was\r\nsuppressed by means of a general prohibition to the printers of\r\npublishing any thing whatsoever relating to that business; and no other\r\nresource was left him than the imperfect one of dispersing copies in\r\nmanuscript. It was suggested to the queen by some about her, that though\r\nthe treasure-ships had escaped her, she might at least reimburse herself\r\nfor the expenses incurred out of the rich spoils taken at Cadiz; and no\r\nsooner had this project gained possession of her mind than she began to\r\nquarrel with Essex for his lavish distribution of prize-money. She\r\ninsisted that the commanders should resign to her a large share of their\r\ngains; and she had even the meanness to cause the private soldiers and\r\nsailors to be searched before they quitted the ships, that the value of\r\nthe money or other booty of which they had possessed themselves might be\r\ndeducted from their pay. Her first feelings of displeasure and\r\ndisappointment over, the rank and reputation of the officers concerned,\r\nand especially the brilliancy of the actual success, were allowed to\r\ncover all faults. The influence of her kinsman the lord admiral over the\r\nmind of the queen was one which daily increased in strength with her\r\nadvance in age,--according to a common remark respecting family\r\nattachments; and it will appear that he finally triumphed so completely\r\nover the accusations of his youthful adversary, as to ground on this\r\nvery expedition his claim of advancement to a higher title.\r\n\r\nIt was the darling hope of Essex that he might be authorized to lead\r\nwithout delay his flourishing and victorious army to the recovery of\r\nCalais, now held by a Spanish garrison; and he took some secret steps\r\nwith the French ambassador in order to procure a request to this effect\r\nfrom Henry IV. to Elizabeth. But this king absolutely refused to allow\r\nthe town to be recaptured by his ally, on the required condition of her\r\nretaining it at the peace as an ancient possession of the English crown;\r\nthe Cecil party also opposed the design; and the disappointed general\r\nsaw himself compelled to pause in the career of glory.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the disposition of Essex to support these mortifications\r\nwith the calmness which policy appeared to dictate; and Francis Bacon,\r\nalarmed at the courses which he saw the earl pursuing, and already\r\nforeboding his eventual loss of the queen's favor, and the ruin of\r\nthose, himself included, who had placed their dependence on him,\r\naddressed to him a very remarkable letter of caution and remonstrance,\r\nnot less characteristic of his own peculiar mind than illustrative of\r\nthe critical situation of him to whom it was written.\r\n\r\nAfter appealing to the earl himself for the advantage which he had\r\nlately received by following his own well-meant advice, in renewing with\r\nthe queen \"a treaty of obsequious kindness,\" which \"did much attemper a\r\ncold malignant humor then growing upon her majesty towards him,\" he\r\nrepeats his counsel that he should \"win the queen;\" adding, \"if this be\r\nnot the beginning of any other course, I see no end. And I will not now\r\nspeak of favor or affection, but of other correspondence and\r\nagreeableness, which, when it shall be conjoined with the other of\r\naffection, I durst wager my life... that in you she will come to\r\nquestion of _Quid fiet homini quem rex vult honorare?_ But how is it\r\nnow? A man of a nature not to be ruled; that hath the advantage of my\r\naffection and knoweth it; of an estate not grounded to his greatness; of\r\na popular reputation; of a military dependence. I demand whether there\r\ncan be a more dangerous image than this represented to any monarch\r\nliving, much more to a lady, and of her majesty's apprehension? And is\r\nit not more evident than demonstration itself, that whilst this\r\nimpression continueth in her majesty's breast, you can find no other\r\ncondition than inventions to keep your estate bare and low; crossing and\r\ndisgracing your actions; extenuating and blasting of your merit;\r\ncarping with contempt at your nature and fashions; breeding, nourishing\r\nand fortifying such instruments as are most factious against you;\r\nrepulses and scorns of your friends and dependents that are true and\r\nsteadfast; winning and inveigling away from you such as are flexible and\r\nwavering; thrusting you into odious employments and offices to supplant\r\nyour reputation; abusing you and feeding you with dalliances and\r\ndemonstrations to divert you from descending into the serious\r\nconsideration of your own case; yea and percase venturing you in\r\nperilous and desperate enterprises?\"\r\n\r\nWith his usual exactness of method, he then proceeds to offer remedies\r\nfor the five grounds of offence to her majesty here pointed out; amongst\r\nwhich the following are the most observable. That he ought to ascribe\r\nany former and irrevocable instance of an ungovernable humor in him to\r\ndissatisfaction, and not to his natural temper:--That though he sought\r\nto shun, and in some respects rightly, any imitation of Hatton or\r\nLeicester, he should yet allege them on occasion to the queen as authors\r\nand patterns, because there was no readier means to make her think him\r\nin the right course:--That when his lordship happened in speeches _to do\r\nher majesty right_, \"for there is no such matter as flattery amongst you\r\nall,\" he had rather the air of paying fine compliments than of speaking\r\nwhat he really thought; \"so that,\" adds he, \"a man may read your\r\nformality in your countenance,\" whereas \"it ought to be done familiarly\r\nand with an air of earnest.\"\r\n\r\nThat he should never be without some particulars on foot which he\r\nshould seem to pursue with earnestness and affection, and then let them\r\nfall upon taking knowledge of her majesty's opposition and dislike. Of\r\nwhich kind the weightiest might be, if he offered to labor, in the\r\nbehalf of some whom he favored, for some of the places then void,\r\nchoosing such a subject as he thought her majesty likely to oppose.... A\r\nless weighty sort of particulars might be the pretence of some journeys,\r\nwhich at her majesty's request his lordship might relinquish; as if he\r\nshould pretend a journey to see his estate towards Wales, or the\r\nlike.... And the lightest sort of particulars, which yet were not to be\r\nneglected, were in his habits, apparel, wearings, gestures, and the\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to a \"military dependence,\" which the writer regards as the\r\nmost injurious impression respecting him of all, he declares that he\r\ncould not enough wonder that his lordship should say the wars were his\r\noccupation, and go on in that course. He greatly rejoiced indeed, now it\r\nwas over, in his expedition to Cadiz, on account of the large share of\r\nhonor which he had acquired, and which would place him for many years\r\nbeyond the reach of military competition. Besides that the disposal of\r\nplaces and other matters relating to the wars, would of themselves flow\r\nin to him as he increased in other greatness, and preserve to him that\r\ndependence entire. It was indeed a thing which, considering the times\r\nand the necessity of the service, he ought above all to retain; but\r\nwhile he kept it in substance, he should abolish it in shows to the\r\nqueen, who loved peace, and did not love cost. And on this account he\r\ncould not so well approve of his affecting the place of earl-marshal or\r\nmaster of the ordnance, on account of their affinity to a military\r\ngreatness, and rather recommended to his seeking the peaceful,\r\nprofitable and courtly office of lord privy seal. In the same manner,\r\nwith respect to the reputation of popularity, which was a good thing in\r\nitself, and one of the best flowers of his greatness both present and\r\nfuture, the only way was to quench it _verbis, non rebus_; to take all\r\noccasions to declaim against popularity and popular courses to the\r\nqueen, and to tax them in all others, yet for himself, to go on as\r\nbefore in all his honorable commonwealth courses. \"And therefore,\" says\r\nhe, \"I will not advise to cure this by dealing in monopolies or any\r\noppressions.\"\r\n\r\nThe last and most curious article of all, respects his quality of a\r\nfavorite. As, separated from all the other matters it could not hurt,\r\nso, joined with them, he observes that it made her majesty more fearful\r\nand captious, as not knowing her own strength. For this, the only remedy\r\nwas to give place to any other favorite to whom he should find her\r\nmajesty incline, \"so as the subject had no ill or dangerous aspect\"\r\ntowards himself. \"For otherwise,\" adds this politic adviser, \"whoever\r\nshall tell me that you may not have singular use of a favorite at your\r\ndevotion, I will say he understandeth not the queen's affection, nor\r\nyour lordship's condition.\"\r\n\r\nThese crafty counsels, which steadily pursued would have laid the army,\r\nthe court, and the people, and in effect the queen herself, at the feet\r\nof a private nobleman, seem to have made considerable impression for\r\nthe time on the mind of Essex; though the impetuosity of his temper,\r\njoined to a spirit of sincerity, honor and generosity, which not even\r\nthe pursuits of ambition and the occupations of a courtier could\r\nentirely quench, soon caused him to break loose from their intolerable\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon, in furtherance of the plan which he had suggested to his\r\npatron of appearing to sink all other characters in that of a devoted\r\nservant of her majesty, likewise condescended to employ his genius upon\r\na device which was exhibited by the earl on the ensuing anniversary of\r\nher accession, with great applause.\r\n\r\nFirst, his page, entering the tilt-yard, accosted her majesty in a fit\r\nspeech, and she in return graciously pulled off her glove and gave it to\r\nhim. Some time after appeared the earl himself, who was met by an\r\nancient hermit, a secretary of state, and a soldier; each of whom\r\npresented him with a book recommending his own course of life, and,\r\nafter a little pageantry and dumb show to relieve the solemnity of the\r\nmain design, pronounced a long and well-penned speech to the same\r\neffect. All were answered by an esquire, or follower of the earl, who\r\npointed out the evils attached to each pursuit, and concluded, says our\r\nreporter, \"with an excellent but too plain English, that this knight\r\nwould never forsake his mistress' love, whose virtue made all his\r\nthoughts divine, whose wisdom taught him all true policy, whose beauty\r\nand worth made him at all times fit to command armies. He showed all\r\nthe defects and imperfections of their times, and therefore thought his\r\nown course of life to be best in serving his mistress.... The queen said\r\nthat if she had thought there had been so much said of her, she would\r\nnot have been there that night; and so went to bed.\" These speeches may\r\nstill be read, with mingled admiration and regret, amongst the immortal\r\nworks of Francis Bacon. In majesty of diction and splendor of allusion\r\nthey are excelled by none of his more celebrated pieces; and with such a\r\nweight of meaning are they fraught, that they who were ignorant of the\r\nserious purpose which he had in view might wonder at the prodigality of\r\nthe author in employing massy gold and real gems on an occasion which\r\ndeserved nothing better than tinsel and false brilliants. That full\r\njustice might be done to the eloquence of the composition, the favorite\r\npart of the esquire was supported by Toby Matthew, whose father was\r\nafterwards archbishop of York; a man of a singular and wayward\r\ndisposition, whose prospects in life were totally destroyed by his\r\nsubsequent conversion to popery; but whose talents and learning were\r\nheld in such esteem by Bacon, that he eagerly engaged his pen in the\r\ntask of translating into Latin some of the most important of his own\r\nphilosophical works. Such were the \"wits, besides his own,\" of which the\r\nmunificent patronage of Essex had given him \"the command!\"\r\n\r\nA few miscellaneous occurrences of the years 1595 and 1596 remain to be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe size of London, notwithstanding many proclamations and acts of\r\nparliament prohibiting the erection of any new buildings except on the\r\nsite of old ones, had greatly increased during the reign of Elizabeth;\r\nand one of the first effects of its rapid growth was to render its\r\nstreets less orderly and peaceful. The small houses newly erected in the\r\nsuburbs being crowded with poor, assembled from all quarters, thefts\r\nbecame frequent; and a bad harvest having plunged the lower classes into\r\ndeeper distress, tumults and outrages ensued. In June 1595 great\r\ndisorders were committed on Tower-hill; and the multitude having\r\ninsulted the lord mayor who went out to quell them, Elizabeth took the\r\nviolent and arbitrary step of causing martial law to be proclaimed in\r\nher capital. Sir Thomas Wilford, appointed provost-marshal for the\r\noccasion, paraded the streets daily with a body of armed men ready to\r\nhang all rioters in the most summary manner; and five of these offenders\r\nsuffered for high treason on Tower-hill, without resistance on the part\r\nof the people, or remonstrance on that of the parliament, against so\r\nflagrant a violation of the dearest rights of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nLord Hunsdon, the nearest kinsman of the queen, whose character has been\r\nalready touched upon, died in 1596. It is related that Elizabeth, on\r\nhearing of his illness, finally resolved to confer upon him the title of\r\nearl of Wiltshire, to which he had some claim as nephew and heir male to\r\nsir Thomas Boleyn, her majesty's grandfather, who had borne that\r\ndignity. She accordingly made him a gracious visit, and caused the\r\npatent and the robes of an earl to be brought and laid upon his bed; but\r\nthe old man, preserving to the last the blunt honesty of his character,\r\ndeclared, that if her majesty had accounted him unworthy of that honor\r\nwhile living, he accounted himself unworthy of it now that he was dying;\r\nand with this refusal be expired. Lord Willoughby succeeded him in the\r\noffice of governor of Berwick, and lord Cobham, a wealthy but\r\ninsignificant person of the party opposed to Essex, in that of lord\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\nHenry third earl of Huntingdon of the family of Hastings died about the\r\nsame time. By his mother, eldest daughter and coheiress of Henry Pole\r\nlord Montacute, he was the representative of the Clarence branch of the\r\nfamily of Plantagenet; but no pretensions of his had ever awakened\r\nanxiety in the house of Tudor. He was a person of mild disposition,\r\ngreatly attached to the puritan party, which, bound together by a secret\r\ncompact, now formed a church within the church; he is said to have\r\nimpaired his fortune by his bounty to the more zealous preachers; and be\r\nlargely contributed by his will to the endowment of Emanuel college, the\r\npuritanical character of which was now well known.\r\n\r\nRichard Fletcher bishop of London, \"a comely and courtly prelate,\" who\r\ndeparted this life in the same year, affords a subject for a few\r\nremarks. It was a practice of the more powerful courtiers of that day,\r\nwhen the lands of a vacant see had excited, as they seldom failed to do,\r\ntheir cupidity, to \"find out some men that had great minds and small\r\nmeans or merits, that would be glad to leave a small deanery to make a\r\npoor bishopric, by new leasing lands that were almost out of\r\nlease[119];\" and on these terms, which more conscientious churchmen\r\ndisdained, Fletcher had taken the bishopric of Oxford, and had in due\r\ntime been rewarded for his compliance by translation first to Worcester\r\nand afterwards to London. His talents and deportment pleased the queen;\r\nand it is mentioned, as an indication of her special favor, that she\r\nonce quarrelled with him for wearing too short a beard. But he\r\nafterwards gave her more serious displeasure by taking a wife, a gay and\r\nfair court lady of good quality; and he had scarcely pacified her\r\nmajesty by the propitiatory offering of a great entertainment at his\r\nhouse in Chelsea, when he was carried off by a sudden death, ascribed by\r\nhis contemporaries to his immoderate use of the new luxury of smoking\r\ntobacco. This prelate was the father of Fletcher the dramatic poet.\r\n\r\n[Note 119: Harrington's Brief View.]\r\n\r\nBishop Vaughan succeeded him, of whom Harrington gives the following\r\ntrait: \"He was an enemy to all supposed miracles, insomuch as one\r\narguing with him in the closet at Greenwich in defence of them, and\r\nalleging the queen's healing of the evil for an instance, asking him\r\nwhat he could say against it, he answered, that he was loth to answer\r\narguments taken from the topic-place of the cloth of estate; but if\r\nthey would urge him to answer, he said his opinion was, she did it by\r\nvirtue of some precious stone in possession of the crown of England that\r\nhad such a natural quality. But had queen Elizabeth been told that he\r\nascribed more virtue to her jewels (though she loved them well) than to\r\nher person, she would never have made him bishop of Chester.\"\r\n\r\nOf the justice of the last remark there can be little question. In this\r\nreign, the royal pretension referred to, was asserted with unusual\r\nearnestness, and for good reasons, as we learn from a different\r\nauthority. In 1597 a quarto book appeared, written in Latin and\r\ndedicated to her majesty by one of her chaplains, which contained a\r\nrelation of the cures thus performed by her; in which it is related,\r\nthat a catholic having been so healed went away persuaded that the\r\npope's excommunication of her majesty was of no effect: \"For if she had\r\nnot by right obtained the sceptre of the kingdom, and her throne\r\nestablished by the authority and appointment of God, what she attempted\r\ncould not have succeeded. Because the rule is, that God is not any where\r\nwitness to a lie[120].\" Such were the reasonings of that age.\r\n\r\n[Note 120: Strype's Annals.]\r\n\r\nIt is probably to bishop Vaughan also that sir John Harrington refers in\r\nthe following article of his Brief Notes.\r\n\r\n\"One Sunday (April last) my lord of London preached to the queen's\r\nmajesty, and seemed to touch on the vanity of decking the body too\r\nfinely. Her majesty told the ladies, that if the bishop held more\r\ndiscourse on such matters, she would fit him for heaven, but he should\r\nwalk thither without a staff, and leave his mantle behind him. Perchance\r\nthe bishop hath never sought her highness' wardrobe, or he would have\r\nchosen another text[121].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 121: Nugae Antiquae.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n1597 AND 1598.\r\n\r\nFresh expedition against Spain proposed.--Extracts from Whyte's\r\nletters.--Raleigh reconciles Essex and R.

Her\r\ncaptious favor towards Essex, and the arts employed by him to gain his\r\nwill on every contested point, are well illustrated in the letters of\r\nRowland White, to which we must again recur.\r\n\r\nOn February twenty-second he writes: \"My lord of Essex kept his bed the\r\nmost part of all yesterday; yet did one of his chamber tell me, he could\r\nnot weep for it, for he knew his lord was not sick. There is not a day\r\npasses that the queen sends not often to see him, and himself every day\r\ngoeth privately to her.\" Two days after, he reports that \"my lord of\r\nEssex comes out of his chamber in his gown and night-cap.... Full\r\nfourteen days his lordship kept in; her majesty, as I heard, resolved to\r\nbreak him of his will and to pull down his great heart, who found it a\r\nthing impossible, and says he holds it from the mother's side; but all\r\nis well again, and no doubt he will grow a mighty man in our state.\"\r\n\r\nThe earl of Cumberland made \"some doubt of his going to sea,\" because\r\nlord Thomas Howard and Raleigh were to be joined with him in equal\r\nauthority; the queen mentioned the subject to him, and on his repeating\r\nto herself his refusal, he was \"well chidden.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, Raleigh was busied in mediating a reconciliation between Essex\r\nand Robert Cecil, in which he was so far successful that a kind of\r\ncompromise took place; and henceforth court favors were shared without\r\nany open quarrels between their respective adherents. The motives urged\r\nby Raleigh for this agreement were, that it would benefit the country;\r\nthat the queen's \"continual unquietness\" would turn to contentment, and\r\nthat public business would go on to the hurt of the common enemy.\r\n\r\nEssex however was malcontent at heart; he began to frequent certain\r\nmeetings held in Blackfriars at the house of lady Russel, a busy\r\npuritan, who was one of the learned daughters of sir Anthony Cook.\r\n\"Wearied,\" says White, \"with not knowing how to please, he is not\r\nunwilling to listen to those motions made him for the public good.\" He\r\nwas soon after so much offended with her majesty for giving the office\r\nof warden of the cinque ports to his enemy lord Cobham, after he had\r\nasked it for himself, that he was about to quit the court; but the queen\r\nsent for him, and, to pacify him, made him master of the ordnance.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned about this time, that the queen had of late \"used the\r\nfair Mrs. Bridges with words and blows of anger.\" This young lady was\r\none of the maids of honor, and the same referred to in a subsequent\r\nletter, where it is said, \"it is spied out by envy that the earl of\r\nEssex is again fallen in love with his fairest B.\" On which White\r\nobserves, \"It cannot choose but come to the queen's ears; and then is he\r\nundone, and all that depend upon his favor.\" A striking indication of\r\nthe nature of the sentiment which the aged sovereign cherished for her\r\nyouthful favorite!\r\n\r\nIn May our intelligencer writes thus: \"Here hath been much ado between\r\nthe queen and the lords about the preparation to sea; some of them\r\nurging the necessity of setting it forward for her safety; but she\r\nopposing it by no danger appearing towards her any where; and that she\r\nwill not make wars but arm for defence; understanding how much of her\r\ntreasure was already spent in victual, both for ships and soldiers at\r\nland. She was extremely angry with them that made such haste in it, and\r\nat Burleigh for suffering it, seeing no greater occasion. No reason nor\r\npersuasion by some of the lords could prevail, but that her majesty hath\r\ncommanded order to be given to stay all proceeding, and sent my lord\r\nThomas (Howard) word that he should not go to sea. How her majesty may\r\nbe wrought to fulfil the most earnest desire of some to have it go\r\nforward, time must make it known.\"\r\n\r\nBut the reconciliation, whether sincere or otherwise, brought about by\r\nRaleigh between Essex and the Cecils, rendered at this time the\r\nwar-party so strong, that the scruples of the queen were at length\r\noverruled, and a formidable armament was sent to sea, with the double\r\nobject of destroying the Spanish ships in their harbours and\r\nintercepting their homeward-bound West India fleet. Essex was commander\r\nin chief by sea and land; lord Thomas Howard and Raleigh vice and rear\r\nadmirals; lord Montjoy was lieutenant-general; sir Francis Vere,\r\nmarshal. Several young noblemen attached to Essex joined the expedition\r\nas volunteers; as lord Rich his brother-in-law, the earl of Rutland,\r\nafterwards married to the daughter of the countess of Essex by sir\r\nPhilip Sidney; lord Cromwel, and the earl of Southampton. The last,\r\nwhose friendship for Essex afterwards hurried him into an enterprise\r\nstill more perilous, appears to have been attracted to him by an\r\nextraordinary conformity of tastes and temper. Like Essex, he was brave\r\nand generous, but impetuous and somewhat inclined to arrogance:--like\r\nhim, a munificent patron of the genius which he loved. Like his friend\r\nagain, he received from her majesty tokens of peculiar favor, which she\r\noccasionally suspended on his giving indications of an ungovernable\r\ntemper or too lofty spirit, and which she finally withdrew, on his\r\npresuming to marry without that consent which to certain persons she\r\ncould never have been induced to accord. This earl of Southampton was\r\ngrandson of that ambitious and assuming but able and diligent statesman,\r\nlord chancellor Wriothesley, appointed by Henry VIII. one of his\r\nexecutors; he was father of the virtuous Southampton lord treasurer, and\r\nby him, grandfather of the heroical and ever-memorable Rachel lady\r\nRussel.\r\n\r\nA storm drove the ill-fated armament back to Plymouth, where it remained\r\nwind-bound for a month, and Essex and Raleigh posted together up to\r\ncourt for fresh instructions. Having concerted their measures, they made\r\nsail for the Azores, and Raleigh with his division arriving first,\r\nattacked and captured the isle of Fayal without waiting for his admiral.\r\nEssex was incensed; and there were not wanting those about him who\r\napplied themselves to fan the flame, and even urged him to bring sir\r\nWalter to a court-martial: but he refused; and his anger soon\r\nevaporating, lord Thomas Howard was enabled to accommodate the\r\ndifference, and the rivals returned to the appearance of friendship.\r\nEssex was destitute of the naval skill requisite for the prosperous\r\nconduct of such an enterprise: owing partly to his mistakes, and partly\r\nto several thwarting circumstances, the West India fleet escaped him,\r\nand three rich Havannah ships, which served to defray most of the\r\nexpenses, were the only trophies of his \"Island Voyage,\" from which\r\nhimself and the nation had anticipated results so glorious.\r\n\r\nThe queen received him with manifest dissatisfaction; his severity\r\ntowards Raleigh was blamed, and it was evident that matters tended to\r\ninvolve him in fresh differences with Robert Cecil. During his absence,\r\nthe lord admiral had been advanced to the dignity of earl of Nottingham,\r\nand he now discovered that by a clause in the patent this honor was\r\ndeclared to be conferred upon him in consideration of his good service\r\nat the taking of Cadiz, an action of which Essex claimed to himself the\r\nwhole merit. To make the injury greater, this title, conjoined to the\r\noffice of lord high admiral, gave the new earl precedency of all others\r\nof the same rank, Essex amongst the rest. To such complicated\r\nmortifications his proud spirit disdained to submit; and after\r\nchallenging without effect to single combat the lord admiral himself or\r\nany of his sons who would take up the quarrel, the indignant favorite\r\nretired a sullen malcontent to Wanstead-house, feigning himself sick.\r\nThis expedient acted on the heart of the queen with all its wonted\r\nforce;--she showed the utmost concern for his situation, chid the Cecils\r\nfor wronging him, and soon after made him compensation for the act which\r\nhad wounded him, by admitting his claim to the hereditary office of earl\r\nmarshal, with which he was solemnly invested in December 1597; and in\r\nright of it once more took place above the lord admiral.\r\n\r\nIt was during this summer that the arrogant deportment of a Polish\r\nambassador, sent to complain of an invasion of neutral rights in the\r\ninterruption given by the English navy to the trade of his master's\r\nsubjects with Spain, gave occasion to a celebrated display of the spirit\r\nand the erudition of the queen of England. Speed, the ablest of our\r\nchroniclers, gives at length her extemporal Latin reply to his harangue;\r\nadding in his quaint but expressive phrase, that she \"thus lion like\r\nrising, daunted the malapert orator no less with her stately port and\r\nmajestical deporture, than with the tartness of her princely checks: and\r\nturning to the train of her attendants thus said, 'God's death, my\r\nlords,' (for that was her oath ever in anger,) 'I have been inforced\r\nthis day to scour up my old Latin, that hath lain long in rusting.'\" The\r\nsame author mentions, that the king of Denmark having by his ambassador\r\noffered to mediate between England and Spain, the queen declined the\r\noverture, adding, \"I would have the king of Denmark and all princes\r\nChristian and Heathen to know, that England hath no need to crave peace;\r\nnor myself indured one hour's fear since I attained the crown thereof,\r\nbeing guarded with so valiant and faithful subjects.\" Such was the lofty\r\ntone which Elizabeth, to the end of her days, maintained towards foreign\r\npowers; none of whom had she cause to dread or motive to court. Yet her\r\ncheerfulness and fortitude were at the same time on the point of sinking\r\nunder the harassing disquietudes of a petty war supported against her by\r\nan Irish chief of rebels.\r\n\r\nThe head of the sept O'Neal, whom she had in vain endeavoured to attach\r\npermanently to her interests by conferring upon him the dignity of earl\r\nof Tyrone, had now for some years persevered in a resistance to her\r\nauthority, which the most strenuous efforts of the civil and military\r\ngovernors of this turbulent and miserable island had proved inadequate\r\nto overcome. That brave officer sir John Norris, then general of Ulster,\r\nhad found it necessary to grant terms to the rebel whom he would gladly\r\nhave brought in bonds to the feet of his sovereign. But the treaty thus\r\nmade, this perfidious barbarian, according to his custom, observed only\r\ntill the English forces were withdrawn and he saw the occasion favorable\r\nto rise again in arms. Lord Borough, whom the queen had appointed deputy\r\nin 1598,--on which sir John Norris, appointed to act under him, died, as\r\nit is thought, of chagrin,--began his career with a vigorous attack, by\r\nwhich he carried, though not without considerable loss, the fort of\r\nBlackwater, the only place of strength possessed by the rebels; but\r\nbefore he was able to pursue further his success, death overtook him,\r\nand the government was committed for a time to the earl of Ormond.\r\nTyrone, nothing daunted, laid siege in his turn to Blackwater; and sir\r\nHenry Bagnal, with the flower of the English army, being sent to relieve\r\nit, sustained the most signal defeat ever experienced by an English\r\nforce in Ireland. The commander himself, several captains of distinction\r\nand fifteen hundred men, were left on the field; and the fort\r\nimmediately surrendered to the rebel chief, who now vauntingly declared,\r\nthat he would accept of no terms from the queen of England, being\r\nresolved to remain in arms till the king of Spain should send forces to\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the alarming position of affairs in this island at the\r\nconclusion of the year 1598. At home, several incidents had intervened\r\nto claim attention.\r\n\r\nThe king of France had received from Spain proposals for a peace, which\r\nthe exhausted state of his country would not permit him to neglect; and\r\nhe had used his utmost endeavours to persuade his allies, the queen of\r\nEngland and the United Provinces, to enter into the negotiations for a\r\ngeneral pacification. But Philip II. still refused to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of his revolted subjects, the only basis on which the new\r\nrepublic would condescend to treat. Elizabeth, besides that she\r\ndisdained to desert those whom she had so long and so zealously\r\nsupported, was in no haste to terminate a war from which she and her\r\nsubjects anticipated honor with little peril, and plunder which would\r\nmore than repay its expenses; and both from England and Holland agents\r\nwere sent to remonstrate with Henry against the breach of treaty which\r\nhe was about to commit by the conclusion of a separate peace. Elizabeth\r\nwrote to admonish him that the true sin against the Holy Ghost was\r\ningratitude, of which she had so much right to accuse him; that fidelity\r\nto engagements was the first of duties and of virtues; and that union,\r\naccording to the ancient apologue of the bundle of rods, was the source\r\nof strength. But to all her eloquence and all her invectives Henry had\r\nto oppose the necessity of his affairs, and the treaty of Vervins was\r\nconcluded; but not without some previous stipulations on the part of the\r\nFrench king which softened considerably the resentment of his ally. Of\r\nthe commissioners named by Elizabeth to arrange this business with\r\nHenry, Robert Cecil was the chief; who held before his departure many\r\nprivate conferences with Essex, and would not move from court till he\r\nhad bound him by favors and promises to do him no injury by promoting\r\nhis enemies in his absence. The earl of Southampton having given some\r\noffence to her majesty for which she had ordered him to absent himself\r\nawhile from court, took the opportunity to obtain license to travel, and\r\nattended the secretary to France, perhaps in the character of a spy upon\r\nhis motions on behalf of Essex, who seems to have prepared him for the\r\nservice by much private instruction.\r\n\r\n\"I acquainted you,\" says Rowland Whyte to his correspondent, \"with the\r\ncare had to bring my lady of Leicester to the queen's presence. It was\r\noften granted, and she brought to the privy galleries, but the queen\r\nfound some occasion not to come. Upon Shrove Monday the queen was\r\npersuaded to go to Mr. Comptroller's at the tilt end, and there was my\r\nlady of Leicester with a fair jewel of three hundred pounds. A great\r\ndinner was prepared by my lady Chandos; the queen's coach ready, and all\r\nthe world expecting her majesty's coming; when, upon a sudden, she\r\nresolved not to go, and so sent word. My lord of Essex that had kept his\r\nchamber all the day before, in his nightgown went up to the queen the\r\nprivy way; but all would not prevail, and as yet my lady Leicester hath\r\nnot seen the queen. It had been better not moved, for my lord of Essex,\r\nby importuning the queen in these unpleasing matters, loses the\r\nopportunity he might take to do good unto his ancient friends.\" But on\r\nMarch 2d he adds; \"My lady Leicester was at court, kissed the queen's\r\nhand and her breast, and did embrace her, and the queen kissed her. My\r\nlord of Essex is in exceeding favor here. Lady Leicester departed from\r\ncourt exceedingly contented, but being desirous again to come to kiss\r\nthe queen's hand, it was denied, and, as I heard, some wonted unkind\r\nwords given out against her.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary height of royal favor was not merely the precursor,\r\nbut, by the arrogant presumption with which it inspired him, a principal\r\ncause of Essex's decline, which was now fast approaching. Confident in\r\nthe affections of Elizabeth, he suffered himself to forget that she was\r\nstill his queen and still a Tudor; he often neglected the attentions\r\nwhich would have gratified her; on any occasional cause of ill humour he\r\nwould drop slighting expressions respecting her age and person which, if\r\nthey reached her ear, could never be forgiven; on one memorable instance\r\nhe treated her with indignity openly and in her presence. A dispute had\r\narisen between them in presence of the admiral, the secretary, and the\r\nclerk of the signet, respecting the choice of a commander for Ireland;\r\nthe queen resolving to send sir William Knolles, the uncle of Essex,\r\nwhile he vehemently supported sir George Carew, because this person,\r\nwho was haughty and boastful, had given him some offence; and he wanted\r\nto remove him out of his way. Unable either by argument or persuasion to\r\nprevail over the resolute will of her majesty, the favorite at last\r\nforgot himself so far as to turn his back upon her with a laugh of\r\ncontempt; an outrage which she revenged after her own manner, by boxing\r\nhis ears and bidding him \"Go and be hanged.\" This retort so inflamed the\r\nblood of Essex that he clapped his hand on his sword, and while the lord\r\nadmiral hastened to throw himself between them, he swore that not from\r\nHenry VIII. himself would he have endured such an indignity, and foaming\r\nwith rage he rushed out of the palace. His sincere friend the lord\r\nkeeper immediately addressed to him a prudential letter, urging him to\r\nlose no time in seeking with humble submissions the forgiveness of his\r\noffended mistress: but Essex replied to these well intended admonitions\r\nby a letter which, amid all the choler that it betrays, must still be\r\napplauded both for its eloquence and for a manliness of sentiment of\r\nwhich few other public characters of the age appear to have been\r\ncapable. The lord keeper in his letter had strongly urged the religious\r\nduty of absolute submission on the part of a subject to every thing that\r\nhis sovereign, justly or unjustly, should be pleased to lay upon him; to\r\nwhich the earl thus replies: \"But, say you, I must yield and submit. I\r\ncan neither yield myself to be guilty, or this imputation laid upon me\r\nto be just. I owe so much to the author of all truth, as I can never\r\nyield falsehood to be truth, or truth to be falsehood. Have I given\r\ncause, ask you, and take scandal when I have done? No; I gave no cause\r\nto take so much as Fimbria's complaint against me, for I did _totum\r\ntelum corpore recipere_. I patiently bear all, and sensibly feel all,\r\nthat I then received, when this scandal was given me. Nay more, when the\r\nvilest of all indignities are done unto me, doth religion enforce me to\r\nsue? or doth God require it? Is it impiety not to do it? What, cannot\r\nprinces err? cannot subjects receive wrong? Is an earthly power or\r\nauthority infinite? Pardon me, pardon me, my good lord, I can never\r\nsubscribe to these principles. Let Solomon's fool laugh when he is\r\nstricken; let those that mean to make their profit of princes, show to\r\nhave no sense of princes' injuries; let them acknowledge an infinite\r\nabsoluteness on earth, that do not believe in an absolute infiniteness\r\nin heaven. As for me, I have received wrong, and feel it. My cause is\r\ngood; I know it; and whatsoever come, all the powers on earth can never\r\nshow more strength and constancy in oppressing, than I can show in\r\nsuffering whatsoever can or shall be imposed upon me.\" &c.\r\n\r\nSeveral other friends of Essex, his mother, his sister and the earl of\r\nNorthumberland her husband, urged him in like manner to return to his\r\nattendance at court and seek her majesty's forgiveness; while she, on\r\nher part, secretly uneasy at his absence, permitted certain persons to\r\ngo to him, as from themselves, and suggest terms of accommodation. Sir\r\nGeorge Carew was made lord president of Munster; and sir William\r\nKnolles, who perhaps had not desired the appointment, assured his\r\nnephew of his earnest wish to serve him. Finally, this great quarrel was\r\nmade up, we scarcely know how, and Essex appeared as powerful at court\r\nas ever; though some have believed, and with apparent reason, that from\r\nthis time the sentiments of the queen for her once cherished favorite,\r\npartook more of fear than of love; and that confidence was never\r\nre-established between them.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated dispute appears to have been in some manner mingled or\r\nconnected with the important question of peace or war with Spain, which\r\nhad previously been debated with extreme earnestness between Essex and\r\nBurleigh. The former, who still thirsted for military distinction,\r\ncontended with the utmost vehemence of invective for the maintenance of\r\nperpetual hostility against the power of Philip; while the latter urged,\r\nthat he was now sufficiently humbled to render an accommodation both\r\nsafe and honorable. Wearied and disgusted at length with the violence of\r\nhis young antagonist, the hoary minister, in whom\r\n\r\n    ...\"old experience did attain\r\n    To something like prophetic strain,\"\r\n\r\ndrew forth a Prayer-book, and with awful significance pointed to the\r\ntext, \"Men of blood shall not live out half their days.\" But the clamor\r\nfor war prevailed over the pleadings of humanity and prudence, and it\r\nwas left for the unworthy successor of Elizabeth to patch up in haste an\r\ninconsiderate and ignoble peace, in place of the solid and advantageous\r\none which the wisdom of Elizabeth and her better counsellor might at\r\nthis time with ease have concluded.\r\n\r\nThe lord treasurer enjoyed however the satisfaction of completing for\r\nhis mistress an agreement with the states of Holland, which provided in\r\na satisfactory manner for the repayment of the sums which she had\r\nadvanced to them, and exonerated her from a considerable portion of the\r\nannual expense which she had hitherto incurred in their defence. This\r\nwas the last act of lord Burleigh's life, which terminated by a long and\r\ngradual decay on August 4th 1598, in the 78th year of his age.\r\n\r\nOn the character of this great minister, identified as it is with that\r\nof the government of Elizabeth during a period of no less than forty\r\nyears, a few additional remarks may here suffice.--Good sense was the\r\nleading feature of his intellect; moderation of his temper. His native\r\nquickness of apprehension was supported by a wonderful force and\r\nsteadiness of application, and by an exemplary spirit of order. His\r\nmorals were regular; his sense of religion habitual, profound, and\r\noperative. In his declining age, harassed by diseases and cares and\r\nsaddened by the loss of a beloved wife, the worthy sharer of his inmost\r\ncounsels, he became peevish and irascible; but his heart was good; in\r\nall the domestic relations he was indulgent and affectionate; in his\r\nfriendships tender and faithful, nor could he be accused of pride, of\r\ntreachery, or of vindictiveness. Rising as he did by the strength of his\r\nown merits, unaided by birth or connexions, he seems to have early\r\nformed the resolution, more prudent indeed than generous, of attaching\r\nhimself to no political leader, so closely as to be entangled in his\r\nfall. Thus he deserted his earliest patron, protector Somerset, on a\r\nchange of fortune, and is even said to have drawn the articles of\r\nimpeachment against him.\r\n\r\nHe extricated himself with adroitness from the ruin of Northumberland,\r\nby whom he had been much employed and trusted; and at some expense of\r\nprotestant consistency contrived to escape persecution, though not to\r\nhold office, under the rule of Mary. Towards the queen his mistress, his\r\ndemeanor was obsequious to the brink of servility; he seems on no\r\noccasion to have hesitated on the execution of any of her commands; and\r\nthe kind of tacit compromise by which he and Leicester, in spite of\r\ntheir mutual animosity, were enabled for so long a course of years to\r\nhold divided empire in the cabinet, could not have been maintained\r\nwithout a general acquiescence on the part of Burleigh in the various\r\nmalversations and oppressions of that guilty minion.\r\n\r\nAnother accusation brought against him is that of taking money for\r\necclesiastical preferments. Of the truth of this charge, sufficient\r\nevidence might be brought from original documents; but an apologist\r\nwould urge with justice that his royal mistress, who virtually delegated\r\nto him the most laborious duties of the office of head of the church,\r\nboth expected and desired that emolument should thence accrue to him and\r\nto the persons under him. Thus we find it stated that bishop Fletcher\r\nhad \"bestowed in allowances and gratifications to divers attendants\r\nabout her majesty, since his preferment to the see of London, the sum of\r\nthirty one hundred pounds or there abouts; which money was given by\r\nhim, for the most part of it, by her majesty's direction and special\r\nappointment[122].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 122: Birch's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nThe ministers of a sovereign who scrupled not to accept of bribes from\r\nparties engaged in law-suits for the exertion of her own interest with\r\nher judges, could scarcely be expected to exhibit much delicacy on this\r\nhead. In fact, the venality of the court of Elizabeth was so gross, that\r\nno public character appears even to have professed a disdain of the\r\ninfluence of gifts and bribes; and we find lord Burleigh inserting the\r\nfollowing among rules moral and prudential drawn up for the use of his\r\nson Robert when young: \"Be sure to keep some great man thy friend. But\r\ntrouble him not for trifles. Compliment him often. Present him with many\r\nyet small gifts, and of little charge. And if thou have cause to bestow\r\nany great gratuity, let it be some such thing as may be daily in his\r\nsight. Otherwise, in this ambitious age, thou shalt remain as a hop\r\nwithout a pole; live in obscurity, and be made a football for every\r\ninsulting companion[123].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 123: In connexion with this subject the following letter\r\nappears worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n    _Hutton Archbishop of York to the lord treasurer:_--\r\n\r\nI am bold at this time to inform your lordship, what ill success I had\r\nin a suit for a pardon for Miles Dawson, seminary priest, whom I\r\nconverted wholly the last summer from popery. Upon his coming to church,\r\nreceiving the holy communion and taking the oath of supremacy, I and the\r\ncouncil here, about Michaelmas last, joined in petition to her majesty\r\nfor her gracious pardon, and commended the matter to one of the masters\r\nof requests, and writ also to Mr. Secretary to further it if need were,\r\nwhich he willingly promised to do. In Michaelmas term nothing was done.\r\nAnd therefore in Hilary term, I being put in mind that all was not done\r\nin that court for God's sake only, sent up twenty French crowns of mine\r\nown purse, as a small remembrance for a poor man's pardon, which was\r\nthankfully accepted of.\r\n\r\nSome say that Mr. Topcliffe did hinder his pardon; who protesteth that\r\nhe knoweth no cause to stay it. There is some fault somewhere, I know it\r\nis not in her majesty. Of whom I will say, as the prophet David speaketh\r\nof God, \"Hath queen Elizabeth forgotten to be gracious? And is her mercy\r\ncome to an end for evermore?\" _Absit._ The whole world knoweth the\r\ncontrary. Your lordship may do very well in mine opinion to move Mr.\r\nSecretary Cecil to deal often in these works of mercy. It will make him\r\nbeloved of God and man.\r\n\r\n(Dated York, May 1597.)]\r\n\r\nIn his office of lord treasurer, this minister is allowed to have\r\nbehaved with perfect integrity and to have permitted no oppression on\r\nthe subject; wisely and honorably maintaining that nothing could be for\r\nthe advantage of a sovereign which in any way injured his reputation.\r\nHis conduct in this high post, added to a general opinion of his\r\nprudence and virtue, caused his death to be sincerely deplored and his\r\nmemory to be constantly held in higher esteem by the people than that of\r\nany former minister of any English prince.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was deeply sensible that to her the loss of such a servant,\r\ncounsellor, and friend was indeed irreparable. Contrary to her custom,\r\nshe wept much; and retired for a time from all company; and it is said\r\nthat to the end of her life she could never hear or pronounce his name\r\nwithout tears. Although she was not sufficiently mistress of herself in\r\nthose fits of rage to which she was occasionally liable, to refrain from\r\ntreating him with a harshness and contempt which sometimes moved the\r\nold man even to weeping, her behaviour towards him satisfactorily\r\nevinced on the whole her deep sense of his fidelity and various merits\r\nas a minister, and her affection for him as a man. He was perhaps the\r\nonly person of humble birth whom she condescended to honor with the\r\ngarter: she constantly made him sit in her presence, on account of his\r\nbeing troubled with the gout, and would pleasantly tell him, \"My lord,\r\nwe make much of you, not for your bad legs but your good head[124].\" In\r\nhis occasional fits of melancholy and retirement, she would woo him back\r\nto her presence by kind and playful letters, and she absolutely refused\r\nto accept of the resignation which his bodily infirmities led him to\r\ntender two or three years before his death. She constantly visited him\r\nwhen confined by sickness:--on one of these occasions, being admonished\r\nby his attendant to stoop as she entered at his chamber-door, she\r\nreplied, \"For your master's sake I will, though not for the king of\r\nSpain.\" His lady was much in her majesty's favor and frequently in\r\nattendance on her; and it has been surmised that her husband found her\r\nan important auxiliary in maintaining his influence.\r\n\r\n[Note 124: Fuller.]\r\n\r\nElizabeth had the weakness, frequent among princes and not unusual with\r\nprivate individuals, of hating her heir; a sentiment which gained ground\r\nupon her daily in proportion as the infirmities of age admonished her of\r\nher approach towards the destined limit of her long and splendid course.\r\nNotwithstanding the respectful observances by which James exerted\r\nhimself to disguise his impatience for her death, particular incidents\r\noccurred from time to time to aggravate her suspicion and exasperate her\r\nanimosity; and the present year was productive of some remarkable\r\ncircumstances of this nature. The queen had long been displeased at the\r\nindulgence exercised by the king of Scots towards certain catholic\r\nnoblemen by whom a treasonable correspondence had been carried on with\r\nSpain and a very dangerous conspiracy formed against his person and\r\ngovernment. Such misplaced lenity, combined with certain negotiations\r\nwhich he carried on with the catholic princes of Europe, she regarded as\r\nevincing a purpose to secure to himself an interest with the popish\r\nparty in England as well as Scotland, which she could not view without\r\nanxiety: And her worst apprehensions were now confirmed by the\r\ninformation which reached her from two different quarters, that James,\r\nin a very respectful letter to the pope, had given him assurance under\r\nhis own hand of his resolution to treat his catholic subjects with\r\nindulgence, at the same time requesting that his holiness would give a\r\ncardinal's hat to Drummond bishop of Vaison. Almost at the same time,\r\none Valentine Thomas, apprehended in London for a theft, accused the\r\nking of Scots of some evil designs against herself. Explanations however\r\nbeing demanded, James solemnly disavowed the letter to the pope, which\r\nhe treated as a forgery and imposture; though circumstances which came\r\nout several years afterwards render the king's veracity in this point\r\nvery questionable.\r\n\r\nTo the charge brought by Thomas, he returned a denial, probably better\r\nfounded; and required that the accuser should be arraigned in presence\r\nof some commissioner whom he should send: but Elizabeth, less jealous of\r\nhis dealings with the papal party now that she no longer dreaded a\r\nSpanish invasion, judged it more prudent to bury the whole matter in\r\nsilence, and resumed, in the tone of friendship, the correspondence\r\nwhich she regularly maintained with her kinsman.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence, which still exists in MS. in the Salisbury\r\ncollection, is rendered obscure and sometimes unintelligible by its\r\nreference to verbal messages which the bearers of the letters were\r\ncommissioned to deliver: but several of those of Elizabeth afford a rich\r\ndisplay of character. She sometimes assures James of the tenderness of\r\nher affection and her disinterested zeal for his welfare in that tone of\r\nhypocrisy which was too congenial to her disposition; at other times she\r\nbreaks forth into vehement invective against the weakness and mutability\r\nof his counsels, and offers him excellent instructions in the art of\r\nreigning; but clouded by her usual uncouth and obscure phraseology and\r\nrendered offensive by their harsh and dictatorial style. When she\r\nregards herself as personally injured by any part of his conduct, her\r\ncomplaints are seasoned with an equal portion of menace and contempt; as\r\nin the following specimen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Queen Elizabeth to the king of Scots:_\r\n\r\n\"When the first blast of a strange, unused, and seld heard of sound had\r\npierced my ears, I supposed that flying fame, who with swift quills oft\r\npaceth with the worst, had brought report of some untruth, but when too\r\ntoo many records in your open parliament were witnesses of such\r\npronounced words, not more to my disgrace than to your dishonor, who did\r\nforget that (above all other regard) a prince's word ought utter nought\r\nof any, much less of a king, than such as to which truth might say Amen:\r\nBut you, neglecting all care of yourself, what danger of reproach,\r\nbesides somewhat else, might light upon you, have chosen so unseemly a\r\ntheme to charge your only careful friend withal, of such matter as (were\r\nyou not amazed in all senses) could not have been expected at your\r\nhands; of such imagined untruths as were never thought of in our time;\r\nand do wonder what evil spirits have possessed you, to set forth so\r\ninfamous devices void of any show of truth. I am sorry that you have so\r\nwilfully fallen from your best stay, and will needs throw yourself into\r\nthe hurlpool of bottomless discredit. Was the haste so great to hie to\r\nsuch opprobry as that you would pronounce a never thought of action\r\nafore you had but asked the question of her that best could tell it? I\r\nsee well we two be of very different natures, for I vow to God I would\r\nnot corrupt my tongue with an unknown report of the greatest foe I have;\r\nmuch less could I detract my best deserving friend with a spot so foul\r\nas scarcely may be ever outrazed. Could you root the desire of gifts of\r\nyour subjects upon no better ground than this quagmire, which to pass\r\nyou scarcely may without the slip of your own disgrace? Shall ambassage\r\nbe sent to foreign princes laden with instructions of your rash-advised\r\ncharge?... I never yet loved you so little as not to moan your infamous\r\ndealings, which you are in mind, we see, that myself shall possess more\r\nprinces witness of my causeless injuries, which I should have wished had\r\npassed no seas to testify such memorials of your wrongs. Bethink you of\r\nsuch dealings, and set your labor upon such mends as best may, though\r\nnot right, yet salve some piece of this overslip; and be assured that\r\nyou deal with such a king as will bear no wrongs and endure infamy; the\r\nexamples have been so lately seen as they can hardly be forgotten of a\r\nfar mightier and potenter prince than any Europe hath. Look you not\r\ntherefore that without large amends, I may or will slupper up such\r\nindignities. We have sent this bearer Bowes, whom you may safely credit,\r\nto signify such particularities as fits not a letters talk. And so I\r\nrecommend you to a better mind and more advised conclusions.\" Dated\r\nJanuary 4th 1597-1598[125].\r\n\r\n[Note 125: M.S. in Dr. Haynes's extracts from the Salisbury\r\ncollection.--I am unable to discover to what particular circumstance\r\nthis angry letter refers.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom another of these letters we learn that James had addressed a\r\nlove-sonnet to the queen and complained of her having taken no notice of\r\nit; reminding her that Cupid was a God of a most impatient disposition.\r\n\r\nAn author has the following notice respecting sir Roger Aston,\r\nfrequently the bearer of these curious epistles. \"He was an Englishman\r\nborn, but had his breeding wholly in Scotland, and had served the king\r\nmany years as his barber; an honest and free-hearted man, and of an\r\nancient family in Cheshire, but of no breeding answerable to his birth.\r\nYet was he the only man ever employed as a messenger from the king to\r\nqueen Elizabeth, as a letter-carrier only, which expressed their own\r\nintentions without any help from him, besides the delivery; but even in\r\nthat capacity was in very good esteem with her majesty, and received\r\nvery royal rewards, which did enrich him, and gave him a better revenue\r\nthan most gentlemen in Scotland. For the queen did find him as faithful\r\nto her as to his master, in which he showed much wisdom, though of no\r\nbreeding. In this his employment I must not pass over one pretty passage\r\nI have heard himself relate. That he did never come to deliver any\r\nletters from his master, but ever he was placed in the lobby; the\r\nhangings being turned towards him, where he might see the queen dancing\r\nto a little fiddle; which was to no other end than that he should tell\r\nhis master, by her youthful disposition, how likely he was to come to\r\nthe possession of the crown he so much thirsted after: for you must\r\nunderstand, the wisest in that kingdom did believe the king should never\r\nenjoy this crown, as long as there was an old wife in England, which\r\nthey did believe we ever set up as the other was dead[126].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 126: Weldon's Court of King James.]\r\n\r\nThough in her own letters to James, Elizabeth made no scruple of\r\ntreating him as the destined heir to her throne, she still resisted with\r\nas much pertinacity as ever, all the proposals made her for publicly\r\ndeclaring her successor; and on this subject, a lively anecdote is\r\nrelated by sir John Harrington in his account of Hutton archbishop of\r\nYork, which must belong to the year 1595 or 1596.\r\n\r\n\"I no sooner,\" says he, \"remember this famous and worthy prelate, but\r\nmethinks I see him in the chappel at Whitehall, queen Elizabeth at the\r\nwindow in the closet; all the lords of the parliament spiritual and\r\ntemporal about them, and then, after his three curtsies that I hear him\r\nout of the pulpit thundering this text, 'The kingdoms of the earth are\r\nmine, and I do give them to whom I will, and I have given them to\r\nNebuchodonosor and his son, and his son's son:' which text when he had\r\nthus produced, taking the sense rather than words of the prophet, there\r\nfollowed first so general a murmur of one friend whispering to another,\r\nthen such an erected countenance in those that had none to speak to,\r\nlastly, so quiet a silence and attention in expectance of some strange\r\ndoctrine, where text itself gave away kingdoms and sceptres, as I have\r\nnever observed before or since.\r\n\r\n\"But he... showed how there were two special causes of translating of\r\nkingdoms, the fullness of time and the ripeness of sin.... Then coming\r\nnearer home, he showed how oft our nation had been a prey to foreigners;\r\nas first when we were all Britons subdued by these Romans; then, when\r\nthe fullness of time and ripeness of our sin required it, subdued by the\r\nSaxons; after this a long time prosecuted and spoiled by the Danes,\r\nfinally conquered and reduced to perfect subjection by the Normans,\r\nwhose posterity continued in great prosperity to the days of her\r\nmajesty, who for peace, for plenty, for glory, for continuance, had\r\nexceeded them all; that had lived to change all her councillors but one;\r\nall officers twice or thrice; some bishops four times: only the\r\nuncertainty of succession gave hopes to foreigners to attempt fresh\r\ninvasions and breed fears in many of her subjects of a new conquest. The\r\nonly way then, said he, that is in policy left to quail those hopes and\r\nto assuage those fears, were to establish the succession... at last,\r\ninsinuating as far as he durst the nearness of blood of our present\r\nsovereign, he said plainly, that the expectations and presages of all\r\nwriters went northward, naming without any circumlocution Scotland;\r\nwhich, said he, if it prove an error, yet will it be found a learned\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n\"When he had finished this sermon, there was no man that knew queen\r\nElizabeth's disposition, but imagined that such a speech was as welcome\r\nas salt to the eyes, or, to use her own word, to pin up her winding\r\nsheet before her face, so to point out her successor and urge her to\r\ndeclare him; wherefore we all expected that she would not only have been\r\nhighly offended, but in some present speech have showed her displeasure.\r\nIt is a principle not to be despised, _Qui nescit dissimulare nescit\r\nregnare_; she considered perhaps the extraordinary auditory, she\r\nsupposed many of them were of his opinion, she might suspect some of\r\nthem had persuaded him to this motion; finally, she ascribed so much to\r\nhis years, to his place, to his learning, that when she opened the\r\nwindow we found ourselves all deceived; for very kindly and calmly,\r\nwithout shew of offence (as if she had but waked out of some sleep) she\r\ngave him thanks for his very learned sermon. Yet when she had better\r\nconsidered the matter, and recollected herself in private, she sent two\r\ncouncillors to him with a sharp message, to which he was glad to give a\r\npatient answer.\"\r\n\r\nThe premature death of Edmund Spenser, under circumstances of severe\r\ndistress, now called forth the universal commiseration and regret of the\r\nfriends and patrons of English genius. After witnessing the plunder of\r\nhis house and the destruction of his whole property by the Irish rebels,\r\nthe unfortunate poet had fled to England for shelter,--the annuity of\r\nfifty pounds which he enjoyed as poet-laureat to her majesty apparently\r\nhis sole resource; and having taken up his melancholy abode in an\r\nobscure lodging in London, he pined away under the pressure of penury\r\nand despondence.\r\n\r\nThe genius of this great poet, formed on the most approved models of the\r\ntime, and exercised upon themes peculiarly congenial to its taste,\r\nreceived in all its plenitude that homage of contemporary applause which\r\nhas sometimes failed to reward the efforts of the noblest masters of the\r\nlyre. The adventures of chivalry, and the dim shadowings of moral\r\nallegory, were almost equally the delight of a romantic, a serious and a\r\nlearned age. It was also a point of loyalty to admire in Gloriana queen\r\nof Faery, or in the empress Mercilla, the avowed types of the graces and\r\nvirtues of her majesty; and she herself had discernment sufficient to\r\ndistinguish between the brazen trump of vulgar flattery with which her\r\near was sated, and the pastoral reed of antique frame tuned sweetly to\r\nher praise by Colin Clout. Spenser was interred with great solemnity in\r\nWestminster abbey by the side of Chaucer; the generous Essex defraying\r\nthe cost of the funeral and walking himself as a mourner. That\r\nostentatious but munificent woman Anne countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and\r\nMontgomery, erected a handsome monument to his memory several years\r\nafterwards; the brother-poets who attended his obsequies threw elegies\r\nand sonnets into the grave; and of the more distinguished votaries of\r\nthe muse in that day there is scarcely one who has withheld his tribute\r\nto the fame and merit of this delightful author. Shakespeare in one of\r\nhis sonnets had already testified his high delight in his works; Joseph\r\nHall, afterwards eminent as a bishop, a preacher, and polemic, but at\r\nthis time a young student of Emanuel college, has more than one\r\ncomplimentary allusion to the poems of Spenser in his \"Toothless\r\nSatires\" printed in 1597. Thus, in the invocation to his first satire,\r\nreferring to Spenser's description of the marriage of the Thames and\r\nMedway, he inquires,\r\n\r\n    ...\"what baser Muse can bide\r\n    To sit and sing by Granta's naked side?\r\n    They haunt the tided Thames and salt Medway,\r\n    E'er since the fame of their late bridal day.\r\n    Nought have we here but willow-shaded shore,\r\n    To tell our Grant his banks are left forlore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, in ridiculing the imitation of some of the more extravagant\r\nfictions of the Orlando Furioso, he thus suddenly checks himself;\r\n\r\n    \"But let no rebel satyr dare traduce\r\n    Th' eternal legends of thy faery muse,\r\n    Renowned Spenser! whom no earthly wight\r\n    Dares once to emulate, much less dares despight.\r\n    Salust of France[127] and Tuscan Ariost,\r\n    Yield up the laurel garland ye have lost.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 127: Du Bartas, then an admired writer in England as well as\r\nFrance.]\r\n\r\nThese pieces of Hall, reprinted in 1599 with three additional books\r\nunder the uncouth title of \"Virgidemiarum\" (a harvest of rods), present\r\nthe earliest example in our language of regular satire on the ancient\r\nmodel, and have gained from an excellent poetical critic the following\r\nhigh eulogium. \"These satires are marked with a classical precision, to\r\nwhich English poetry had yet rarely attained. They are replete with\r\nanimation of style and sentiment. The indignation of the satirist is\r\nalways the result of good sense. Nor are the thorns of severe invective\r\nunmixed with the flowers of pure poetry. The characters are delineated\r\nin strong and lively colouring, and their discriminations are touched\r\nwith the masterly traces of genuine humour. The versification is equally\r\nenergetic and elegant, and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the\r\nmodern standard[128].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 128: Warton's History of English Poetry, vol. iv.]\r\n\r\nA few of his allusions to reigning follies may here be quoted.\r\nContrasting the customs of our barbarous ancestors with those of his own\r\ntimes, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"They naked went, or clad in ruder hide,\r\n    Or homespun russet void of foreign pride.\r\n    But thou can'st mask in garish gaudery,\r\n    To suit a fool's far-fetched livery.\r\n    A French head joined to neck Italian,\r\n    Thy thighs from Germany and breast from Spain.\r\n    An Englishman in none, a fool in all,\r\n    Many in one, and one in several.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare makes Portia satirize the same affectation in her English\r\nadmirer;--\"How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in\r\nItaly, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior\r\nevery where.\"\r\n\r\nOther contemporary writers have similar allusions, and it may be\r\nconcluded, that the passion for travelling then, and ever since, so\r\nprevalent amongst the English youth, was fast eradicating all traces of\r\na national costume by rendering fashionable the introduction of novel\r\ngarments, capriciously adopted by turns from every country of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Cadiz spoil\" is more than once referred to by Hall; and amongst\r\nexpedients for raising a fortune he enumerates, with a satirical glance\r\nat sir Walter Raleigh, the trading to Guiana for gold; as also the\r\nsearch of the philosopher's stone. He likewise ridicules the costly\r\nmineral elixirs of marvellous virtues vended by alchemical quacks; and\r\nwith sounder sense in this point than usually belonged to his age, mocks\r\nat the predictions of judicial astrology.\r\n\r\nIn several passages he reprehends the new luxuries of the time, among\r\nwhich coaches are not forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt should appear that the increasing conveniences and pleasures of a\r\nLondon life had already begun to occasion the desertion of rural\r\nmansions, and the decay of that boundless hospitality which the former\r\npossessors had made their boast; for thus feelingly and beautifully does\r\nthe poet describe the desolation of one of these seats of antiquated\r\nmagnificence:\r\n\r\n    \"Beat the broad gates, a goodly hollow sound\r\n    With double echoes doth again rebound;\r\n    But not a dog doth bark to welcome thee,\r\n    Nor churlish porter canst thou chafing see;\r\n    All dumb and silent like the dead of night,\r\n    Or dwelling of some sleepy Sybarite!\r\n    The marble pavement hid with desert weed,\r\n    With houseleek, thistle, dock, and hemlock-seed.--\r\n    Look to the towered chimneys, which should be\r\n    The windpipes of good hospitality:--\r\n    Lo there the unthankful swallow takes her rest,\r\n    And fills the tunnel with her circled nest.\"\r\n\r\nThe translation of the Orlando Furioso through which that singular work\r\nof genius had just become known to the English reader, was executed by\r\nsir John Harrington, the same who afterwards composed for Henry prince\r\nof Wales, the Brief View of the English Church, the godson of Elizabeth,\r\nand the child of her faithful servants James Harrington and Isabella\r\nMarkham.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual course of school and college education, young\r\nHarrington, who was born in 1561, presented himself at court, where his\r\nwit and learning soon procured him a kind of distinction, which was not\r\nhowever unattended with danger. A satirical piece was traced to him as\r\nits author, containing certain allusions to living characters, which\r\ngave so much offence to the courtiers, that he was threatened with the\r\nanimadversions of the star-chamber; but the secret favor of Elizabeth\r\ntowards a godson whom she loved and who amused her, saved him from this\r\nvery serious kind of retaliation. A tale which he sometime after\r\ntranslated out of Ariosto proved very entertaining to the court ladies,\r\nand soon met the eyes of the queen; who in affected displeasure at\r\ncertain indelicate passages, ordered him to appear no more at\r\ncourt--till he had translated the whole poem. The command was obeyed\r\nwith alacrity; and he speedily committed his Orlando to the press, with\r\na dedication to her majesty. Before this time our sprightly poet had\r\nfound means to dissipate a considerable portion of the large estate to\r\nwhich he was born; and being well inclined to listen to the friendly\r\ncounsels of Essex, who bade him, \"lay good hold on her majesty's bounty\r\nand ask freely,\" he dexterously opened his case by the following lines\r\nslipped behind her cushion.\r\n\r\n    \"For ever dear, for ever dreaded prince,\r\n    You read a verse of mine a little since;\r\n    And so pronounced each word and every letter,\r\n    Your gracious reading graced my verse the better:\r\n    Sith then your highness doth by gift exceeding\r\n    Make what you read the better for your reading;\r\n    Let my poor muse your pains thus far importune,\r\n    Like as you read my verse, so--read my fortune.\r\n\r\n    \"_From your Highness' saucy Godson._\"\r\n\r\nOf the further progress of his suit and the various little arts of\r\npleasing to which Harrington now applied himself, some amusing hints\r\nmay be gathered out of the following extracts taken from a note-book\r\nkept by himself[129].\r\n\r\n[Note 129: See Nugae Antiquae.]\r\n\r\n...\"I am to send good store of news from the country for her highness\r\nentertainment.... Her highness loveth merry tales.\"\r\n\r\n\"The queen stood up and bade me reach forth my arm to rest her thereon.\r\nO! what sweet burden to my next song. Petrarch shall eke out good matter\r\nfor this business.\"\r\n\r\n\"The queen loveth to see me in my new frize jerkin, and saith 'tis well\r\nenough cut. I will have another made liken to it. I do remember she spit\r\non sir Matthew's fringed cloth, and said the fool's wit was gone to\r\nrags.--Heaven spare me from such jibing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must turn my poor wits towards my suit for the lands in the north....\r\nI must go in an early hour, be fore her highness hath special matters\r\nbrought up to counsel on.--I must go before the breakfast covers are\r\nplaced, and stand uncovered as her highness cometh forth her chamber;\r\nthen kneel and say, God save your majesty, I crave your ear at what hour\r\nmay suit for your servant to meet your blessed countenance. Thus will I\r\ngain her favor to follow to the auditory.\r\n\r\n    \"Trust not a friend to do or say,\r\n    In that yourself can sue or pray.\"\r\n\r\nThe lands alluded to in the last extract, formed a large estate in the\r\nnorth of England, which an ancestor of Harrington had forfeited by his\r\nadherence to the house of York during the civil wars, and which he was\r\nnow endeavouring to recover. This further mention of the business occurs\r\nin one of his letters.\r\n\r\n\"Yet I will adventure to give her majesty five hundred pounds in money,\r\nand some pretty jewel or garment, as you shall advise, only praying her\r\nmajesty to further my suit with some of her learned counsel; which I\r\npray you to find some proper time to move in; this some hold as a\r\ndangerous adventure, but five and twenty manors do well justify my\r\ntrying it.\"\r\n\r\nHow notorious must have been the avarice and venality of a sovereign,\r\nbefore such a mode of insuring success in a law-suit could have entered\r\ninto the imagination of a courtier!\r\n\r\nBut the fortunes of Harrington, as of persons of more importance, now\r\nbecome involved in the state of Irish affairs, to which the attention of\r\nthe reader must immediately be directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n1599 TO 1603.\r\n\r\nIrish affairs.--Essex appointed lord deputy.--His letter to the\r\nqueen.--Letter of Markham to Harrington.--Departure of Essex and\r\nproceedings in Ireland.--His letter to the privy council,--conferences\r\nwith Tyrone,--unexpected arrival at court.--Behaviour of the\r\nqueen.--State of parties.--Letters of sir J.

The state of\r\nthat island was in every respect deplorable:--the whole province of\r\nUlster in open rebellion under Tyrone;--the rest of the country only\r\nwaiting for the succours from the pope and the king of Spain, which the\r\ncredulous natives were still taught to expect, to join openly in the\r\nrevolt; and in the meantime reduced to such a state of despair by\r\ninnumerable oppressions and by the rumor of further severities meditated\r\nby the queen of England, that it seemed prepared to oppose the most\r\nobstinate resistance to every measure of government. In what manner and\r\nby whom, this wretched province should be brought back to its\r\nallegiance, had been the subject of frequent and earnest debates in the\r\nprivy-council; in which Essex had vehemently reprobated the conduct of\r\nformer governors in wasting time on inferior objects, instead of first\r\nundertaking the reduction of Tyrone, and appears to have spared no pains\r\nto impress the queen with an opinion of the superior justness of his own\r\nviews of the subject. Elizabeth believed, and with reason, that she\r\ndiscovered in lord Montjoy talents not unequal to the arduous office of\r\nlord deputy at so critical a juncture; but when the greater part of her\r\ncouncil appeared to concur in the choice, Essex insinuated a variety of\r\nobjections;--that the experience of Montjoy in military matters was\r\nsmall;--that neither in the Low Countries nor in Bretagne, where he had\r\nserved, had he attained to any principal or independent command;--that\r\nhis retainers were few or none; his purse inadequately furnished for the\r\nfirst expenses of so high an appointment; and that he was too much\r\naddicted to a sedentary and studious life. By this artful enumeration of\r\nthe deficiencies of Montjoy, he was clearly understood to intimate his\r\nown superior fitness for the office. The queen, notwithstanding certain\r\nsuspicions which had been infused into her of danger in committing to\r\nEssex the command of an army, and notwithstanding the unwillingness\r\nwhich she still felt to deprive herself of his presence, appears to have\r\nadopted with eagerness this suggestion of her favorite;--for she held in\r\nhigh estimation both his talents and his good fortune. Montjoy promptly\r\nretired from a competition in which he must be unsuccessful; the\r\nadherents of the earl, except a few of the more sagacious, eagerly\r\nforwarded his appointment with imprudent eulogiums of his valor and his\r\ngenius and still more imprudent anticipations of his certain and\r\ncomplete success. His enemies, desirous of his absence and hopeful of\r\nhis failure, concurred with no less zeal in the promotion of his wishes;\r\nand he soon found himself importuned on every side to accept the\r\ncommand. But it now became his part to make objections;--perhaps he\r\nbegan to open his eyes to the difficulties to be confronted in\r\nIreland;--perhaps he penetrated too late the designs and expectations of\r\nhis adversaries at home;--perhaps, for his character was not free from\r\nartifice, he chose by a display of reluctance to enhance in the eyes of\r\nhis sovereign the merit of his final acquiescence. However this might\r\nbe, the difficulties which he raised kept the business for some time in\r\nsuspense. Secretary Cecil observed in a letter of December 4th, 1598,\r\nthat \"the opinion of the earl's going to Ireland had some stop, by\r\nreason of his lordship's indisposition to it, except with some such\r\nconditions as were disagreeable to her majesty's mind;\" \"although,\" he\r\nadded, \"the cup will hardly pass from him in regard of his worth and\r\nfortune: but if it do, my lord Montjoy is named[130].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 130: Birch.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of the debates and contentions on this matter that\r\nEssex endeavoured to work upon the feelings of Elizabeth by the\r\nfollowing romantic but eloquent address.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"To the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"From a mind delighting in sorrow, from spirits wasted with passion,\r\nfrom a heart torn in pieces with care grief and travel, from a man that\r\nhateth himself and all things else that keep him alive, what service can\r\nyour majesty expect; since any service past deserves no more than\r\nbanishment and proscription to the cursedest of all islands? It is your\r\nrebels' pride and succession must give me leave to ransom myself out of\r\nthis hateful prison, out of my loathed body; which, if it happeneth so,\r\nyour majesty shall have no cause to mislike the fashion of my death,\r\nsince the course of my life could never please you.\r\n\r\n    Happy could he finish forth his fate\r\n      In some unhaunted desert most obscure\r\n    From all society, from love and hate\r\n      Of worldly folk; then should he sleep secure.\r\n    Then wake again, and yield God ever praise,\r\n      Content with hips and haws and brambleberry;\r\n    In contemplation passing out his days,\r\n      And change of holy thoughts to make him merry.\r\n    Who when he dies, his tomb may be a bush,\r\n    Where harmless robin dwells with gentle thrush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's exiled servant\r\n\r\n\"ROBERT ESSEX.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems also to have been at this juncture that on some public occasion\r\nhe bore a plain mourning shield, with the words, \"_Par nulla figura\r\ndolori_.\"\r\n\r\nA very sensible and friendly letter addressed to Harrington by his\r\nrelation Robert Markham may serve to throw additional light on the\r\nsituation and sentiments of Essex, and on the state of court parties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Robert Markham to John Harrington Esquire._\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the perilous state of our times, I shall not fail to\r\ngive you such intelligence and advices of our matters here as may tend\r\nto your use and benefit. We have gotten good account of some matters,\r\nand as I shall find some safe conduct for bearing them to you, it may\r\nfrom time to time happen that I send tidings of our courtly concerns.\r\n\r\n\"Since your departure from hence, you have been spoken of, and with no\r\nill will, both by the nobles and the queen herself. Your book is almost\r\nforgiven, and I may say forgotten; but not for its lack of wit or\r\nsatire. Those whom you feared most are now bosoming themselves in the\r\nqueen's grace; and though her highness signified displeasure in outward\r\nsort, yet did she like the marrow of your book. Your great enemy, sir\r\nJames, did once mention the star-chamber, but your good esteem in better\r\nminds outdid his endeavours, and all is silent again. The queen is\r\nminded to take you to her favor, but she sweareth that she believes you\r\nwill make epigrams and write _misacmos_ again on her and all the court.\r\nShe hath been heard to say, 'that merry poet her godson, must not come\r\nto Greenwich till he hath grown sober and leaveth the ladies' sports and\r\nfrolics.' She did conceive much disquiet on being told you had aimed a\r\nshaft at Leicester; I wish you knew the author of that ill deed; I would\r\nnot be in his best jerkin for a thousand marks. You yet stand well in\r\nher highness' love, and I hear you are to go to Ireland with the\r\nlieutenant Essex; if so, mark my counsel in this matter. I doubt not\r\nyour valor nor your labor, but that d----e uncovered honesty will mar\r\nyour fortunes. Observe the man who commandeth, and yet is commanded\r\nhimself; he goeth not forth to serve the queen's realm, but to humor his\r\nown revenge. Be heedful of your bearings, speak not your mind to all you\r\nmeet. I tell you I have ground for my caution: Essex hath enemies; he\r\nhath friends too. Now there are two or three of Montjoy's kindred sent\r\nout in your army; they are to report all your conduct to us at home. As\r\nyou love yourself, the queen and me, discover not these matters; if I\r\ndid not love you, they had never been told. High concerns deserve high\r\nattention; you are to take account of all that passes in your\r\nexpedition, and keep journal thereof, unknown to any in the company;\r\nthis will be expected of you; I have reasons to give for this order.\r\n\r\n\"If the lord deputy performs in the field what he hath promised in the\r\ncouncil, all will be well; but though the queen hath granted forgiveness\r\nfor his late demeanour in her presence; we know not what to think\r\nhereof. She hath, in all outward semblance, placed confidence in the man\r\nwho so lately sought other treatment at her hands; we do sometime think\r\none way, and sometime another; what betideth the lord deputy is known to\r\nhim only who knoweth all; but when a man hath so many showing friends,\r\nand so many unshowing enemies, who learneth his end here below? I say,\r\ndo not you meddle in any sort, nor give your jesting too freely among\r\nthose you know not; obey the lord deputy in all things, but give not\r\nyour opinion; it may be heard in England. Though you obey, yet seem not\r\nto advise in any one point; your obeysance may be, and must be,\r\nconstrued well; but your counsel may be ill thought of if any bad\r\nbusiness follow.\r\n\r\n\"You have now a secret from one that wishes you all welfare and honor; I\r\nknow there are overlookers set on you all, so God direct your\r\ndiscretion. Sir William Knolles is not well pleased, the queen is not\r\nwell pleased, the lord deputy may be pleased now, but I sore fear what\r\nmay happen hereafter. The heart of man lieth close hid oft time, men do\r\nnot carry it in their hand, nor should they do so that wish to thrive in\r\nthese times and in these places; I say this that your own honesty may\r\nnot show itself too much, and turn to your own ill favor. Stifle your\r\nunderstanding as much as may be; mind your books and make your jests,\r\nbut take heed who they light on. My love hath overcome almost my\r\nconfidence and trust, which my truth and place demandeth. I have said\r\ntoo much for one in my dependent occupation, and yet too little for a\r\nfriend and kinsman, who putteth himself to this hard trial for your\r\nadvantage. You have difficult matters to encounter beside Tyrone and the\r\nrebels; there is little heed to be had to show of affection in state\r\nbusiness; I find this by those I discourse with daily, and those too of\r\nthe wiser sort. If my lord treasurer had lived longer, matters would go\r\non surer. He was our great pilot, on whom all cast their eyes, and\r\nsought their safety. The queen's highness doth often speak of him in\r\ntears, and turn aside when he is discoursed of; nay, even forbiddeth any\r\nmention to be made of his name in the council. This I learn by some\r\nfriends who are in good liking with my lord Buckhurst[131].\r\n\r\n[Note 131: Lord Buckhurst had succeeded to the office of lord\r\ntreasurer on the death of Burleigh.]\r\n\r\n\"My sister beareth this to you, but doth not know what it containeth,\r\nnor would I disclose my dealings to any woman in this sort; for danger\r\ngoeth abroad, and silence is the safest armour.\" &c.[132]\r\n\r\n[Note 132: Nugae Antiquae.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch were the bodings of distant evil with which the more discerning\r\ncontemplated the new and arduous enterprise in which the ambition of\r\nEssex had engaged him! In the meantime, all things conspired to delude\r\nhim into a false security and to augment that presumption which formed\r\nthe most dangerous defect of his character. All the obstacles which had\r\ndelayed his appointment were gradually smoothed away; the queen\r\nconsented to invest him with powers far more ample than had ever been\r\nconferred on a lord deputy before; all his requisitions of men and other\r\nsupplies were complied with; and an army of 20,000 foot and 1,300 horse,\r\nafterwards increased to 2,000,--a far larger force than Ireland had yet\r\nbeheld,--was placed at his disposal.\r\n\r\nAt parting, the tenderness of the queen revived in full force; and she\r\ndismissed him with expressions of regret and affection which, as he\r\nafterwards professed to her, had \"pierced his very soul.\" The people\r\nfollowed him with acclamations and blessings; and the flower of the\r\nnobility now, as in the Cadiz expedition, attended him with alacrity as\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\nIt was in the end of March 1599 that he embarked; and landing after a\r\ndangerous passage at Dublin, his first act was the appointment of his\r\ndear friend the earl of Southampton to the office of general of the\r\nhorse;--a step which he afterwards found abundant cause to repent.\r\n\r\nAn error of which the consequences were much more pernicious to himself,\r\nand fatal to the success of his undertaking, was his abandoning his\r\noriginal resolution of marching immediately against Tyrone, and\r\nspending his first efforts in the suppression of a minor revolt in\r\nMunster:--an attempt in which he encountered a resistance so much more\r\nformidable than he had anticipated, and found himself so ill supported\r\nby his troops, whom the nature of the service speedily disheartened,\r\nthat its results were by no means so brilliant as to strike terror into\r\nTyrone or the other insurgents. What was still worse, almost four months\r\nwere occupied in this service, and the forces returned sick, wearied,\r\nand incredibly reduced in number by various accidents.\r\n\r\nLearning that the queen was much displeased at this expedition into\r\nMunster, Essex addressed a letter to the privy-council, in which, after\r\naffirming that he had performed his part to the best of his abilities\r\nand judgement, he thus proceeded: \"But as I said, and ever must say, I\r\nprovided for this service a breastplate, and not a cuirass; that is, I\r\nam armed on the breast, but not on the back. I armed myself with\r\nconfidence that rebels in so unjust a quarrel could not fight so well as\r\nwe could in a good. Howbeit if the rebels shall but once come to know\r\nthat I am wounded on the back, not slightly, but to the heart, as I fear\r\nme they have too true and too apparent advertisement of this kind; then\r\nwhat will be their pride and the state's hazard, your lordships in your\r\nwisdoms may easily discern.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter, the warmth of his friendship for Southampton\r\nbreaks out in the following eloquent and forcible appeal.--\"But to leave\r\nthis, and come to that which I never looked I should have come to, I\r\nmean your lordships' letter touching the displacing of the earl of\r\nSouthampton; your lordships say, that her majesty thinketh it strange,\r\nand taketh it offensively, that I should appoint him general of the\r\nhorse, seeing not only her majesty denied it when I moved it, but gave\r\nan express prohibition to any such choice. Surely, my lord, it shall be\r\nfar from me to contest with your lordships, much less with her majesty.\r\nHowbeit, God and my own soul are my witnesses, that I had not in this\r\nnomination any disobedient or irreverent thought; that I never moved her\r\nmajesty for the placing of any officer, my commission fully enabling me\r\nto make free choice of all officers and commanders of the army. I\r\nremember, that her majesty in her privy-chamber at Richmond, I only\r\nbeing with her, showed a dislike of his having any office; but my answer\r\nwas, that if her majesty would revoke my commission, I would cast both\r\nit and myself at her majesty's feet. But if it pleased her majesty that\r\nI should execute it, I must work with my own instruments. And from this\r\nprofession and protestation I never varied; whereas if I had held myself\r\nbarred from giving my lord of Southampton place and reputation some way\r\nanswerable to his degree and expense, there is no one, I think, doth\r\nimagine, that I loved him so ill as to have brought him over. Therefore\r\nif her majesty punish me with her displeasure for this choice, _poena\r\ndolenda venit_. And now, my lords, were now, as then it was, that I were\r\nto choose, or were there nothing in a new choice but my lord of\r\nSouthampton's disgrace and my discomfort, I should easily be induced to\r\ndisplace him, and to part with him. But when, in obeying this command, I\r\nmust discourage all my friends, who now, seeing the days of my suffering\r\ndraw near, follow me afar off, and are some of them tempted to renounce\r\nme; when I must dismay the army, which already looks sadly, as pitying\r\nboth me and itself in this comfortless action; when I must encourage the\r\nrebels, who doubtless will think it time to hew upon a withering tree,\r\nwhose leaves they see beaten down, and the branches in part cut off;\r\nwhen I must disable myself for ever in the course of this service, the\r\nworld now perceiving that I want either reason to judge of merit, or\r\nfreedom to right it, disgraces being there heaped where, in my opinion,\r\nrewards are due; give just grief leave once to complain. O! miserable\r\nemployment, and more miserable destiny of mine, that makes it impossible\r\nfor me to please and serve her majesty at once! Was it treason in my\r\nlord of Southampton to marry my poor kinswoman, that neither long\r\nimprisonment, nor any punishment besides that hath been usual in like\r\ncases, can satisfy and appease? Or will no kind of punishment be fit for\r\nhim, but that which punisheth, not him, but me, this army, and this poor\r\ncountry of Ireland? Shall I keep the country when the army breaks? Or\r\nshall the army stand when all the volunteers leave it? Or will any\r\nvoluntaries stay when those that have will and cause to follow are thus\r\nhandled? No, my lords, they already ask passports, and that daily.\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this earnestness, in spite of the remaining affection\r\nof the queen for her favorite, she still persisted in requiring that he\r\nshould displace his friend, and even chid him severely for having waited\r\nthe result of his further representations and entreaties, after once\r\nlearning her pleasure on the point. Success in the main object of his\r\nexpedition might still have procured him a triumph over his\r\ncourt-enemies and a sweet reconciliation with his offended sovereign,\r\nbut fortune had no such favor in store for Essex. The necessity of\r\nquelling some rebels in Leinster again impeded his march into Ulster;\r\nfor which expedition he was obliged to solicit a further supply from\r\nEngland of two thousand foot, which was immediately forwarded to him, as\r\nif with the design of leaving him without excuse should he fail to\r\nreduce Tyrone. But by this time the season was so far advanced, and the\r\narmy so sickly, that both the earl and the Irish council were of opinion\r\nthat nothing effectual could be done; and at the first notice of his\r\nintended march great part of his forces deserted. He nevertheless\r\nproceeded, and in a few days during which a little skirmishing took\r\nplace, came in sight of the rebel's main army, considerably more\r\nnumerous than his own; Tyrone however would not venture to give him\r\nbattle, but sent to request a parley. This, after some delay, the lord\r\ndeputy granted; and a conference was held between them, Essex standing\r\non the bank of a stream which separated the two hosts, while the rebel\r\nsat on his horse in the middle of the water. A truce was concluded, to\r\nbe renewed from six weeks to six weeks, till terms of peace should be\r\nagreed on; those proposed by Tyrone containing several arrogant and\r\nunreasonable articles. At a second meeting with the Irish chief, Essex\r\nwas attended by some of his principal officers; but it was afterwards\r\nproved that previously to the first conference, he had opened a very\r\nunwarrantable correspondence with this enemy of his queen and country,\r\nwho took upon himself to promise that if Essex would come into his\r\nmeasures he would make him the greatest man in England. During the whole\r\nof this time, sharp letters were passing between Elizabeth and her\r\nprivy-council and the earl; and it is hard to say on which side the\r\nheaviest list of grievances was produced. The queen remonstrated against\r\nhis contemptuous disobedience of her orders, and the waste in frivolous\r\nenterprises of the vast supplies of men and money which she had\r\nintrusted to her deputy for a specific and momentous object;--the earl,\r\nin addition to his usual murmurings against the sinister suggestions of\r\nhis enemies, amongst whom he singled out by name Raleigh and lord\r\nCobham; found further grounds of complaint and alarm in the circumstance\r\nof her majesty's having caused some troops to be called out under the\r\nlord admiral, on pretext of fears from the Spaniard, but really with a\r\nview of protecting her against certain designs imputed to himself: and\r\nin her having granted to secretary Cecil during his absence the office\r\nof master of the wards, for which he was himself a suitor.\r\n\r\nApprehensive lest by his longer delay her affections should be\r\nirrecoverably alienated from him by the discovery of his traitorous\r\ncorrespondence with Tyrone, he rashly resolved to risk yet another act\r\nof disobedience;--that of deserting without license, and under its\r\npresent accumulated circumstances of danger, his important charge, and\r\nhastening to throw himself at the feet of an exasperated, but he\r\nflattered himself, not inexorable mistress. At one time he had even\r\nentertained the desperate and criminal design of carrying over with him\r\na large part of his army, for the purpose of intimidating his\r\nadversaries; but being diverted from this scheme by the earl of\r\nSouthampton and sir Christopher Blount his step-father, he embarked with\r\nthe attendance only of most of his household and a number of his\r\nfavorite officers, and arrived at the court, which was then at Nonsuch,\r\non Michaelmas eve in the morning.\r\n\r\nOn alighting at the gate, covered with mire and stained with travel as\r\nhe was, he hastened up stairs, passed through the presence and the\r\nprivy-chambers, and never stopped till he reached the queen's\r\nbed-chamber, where he found her newly risen with her hair about her\r\nface. He kneeled and kissed her hands, and she, in the agreeable\r\nsurprise of beholding at her feet one whom she still loved, received him\r\nwith so kind an aspect, and listened with such favor to his excuses,\r\nthat on leaving her, after a private conference of some duration, he\r\nappeared in high spirits, and thanked God, that though he had suffered\r\nmany storms abroad, he found a sweet calm at home. He waited on her\r\nagain as soon as he had changed his dress; and after a second long and\r\ngracious conference, was freely visited by all the lords, ladies, and\r\ngentlemen at court, excepting the secretary and his party, who appeared\r\nsomewhat shy of him. But all these fair appearances quickly vanished. On\r\nrevisiting the queen in the evening, he found her much changed towards\r\nhim; she began to call him to account for his unauthorised return and\r\nthe hazard to which he had committed all things in Ireland; and four\r\nprivy-councillors were appointed by her to examine him that night and\r\nhear his answers: but by them nothing was concluded, and the matter was\r\nreferred to a full council summoned for the following day, the earl\r\nbeing in the meantime commanded to keep his chamber. Notwithstanding the\r\nnatural impetuosity of his temper, Essex now armed himself with patience\r\nand moderation, and answered with great gravity and discretion to the\r\ncharges brought against him, which resolved themselves into the\r\nfollowing articles. \"His contemptuous disobedience of her majesty's\r\nletters and will in returning: his presumptuous letters written from\r\ntime to time: his proceedings in Ireland contrary to the points resolved\r\nupon in England, ere he went: his rash manner of coming away from\r\nIreland: his overbold going the day before to her majesty's presence to\r\nher bed-chamber: and his making of so many idle knights[133].\" The\r\ncouncil, after hearing his defence, remained awhile in consultation and\r\nthen made their report to her majesty, who said she should take time to\r\nconsider of his answers: meanwhile the proceedings were kept very\r\nprivate, and the earl continued a prisoner in his own apartment. An\r\nopen division now took place between the two great factions which had\r\nlong divided the court in secret. The earls of Shrewsbury and\r\nNottingham, lords Thomas Howard, Cobham, and Grey, sir Walter Raleigh,\r\nand sir George Carew, attended on the secretary; while Essex was\r\nfollowed by the earls of Worcester and Rutland, lords Montjoy, Rich,\r\nLumley, and Henry Howard; the last of whom however was already suspected\r\nto be the traitor which he afterwards proved to the patron whom he\r\nprofessed to love, to honor, and almost to worship. Sir William Knolles\r\nalso joined the party of his nephew, with many other knights and\r\ngentlemen, and lord Effingham, though son to the earl of Nottingham, was\r\noften with him, and \"protested all service\" to him. \"It is a world to be\r\nhere,\" adds Whyte, \"and see the humors of the place.\" On October the\r\nsecond, Essex was \"commanded from court,\" and committed to the lord\r\nkeeper, with whom he remained at York house. At his departure from court\r\nfew or none of his friends accompanied him.\r\n\r\n[Note 133: Rowland Whyte in Sidney Papers.]\r\n\r\n\"His lordship's sudden return out of Ireland,\" says Whyte, \"brings all\r\nsorts of knights, captains, officers, and soldiers, away from thence,\r\nthat this town is full of them, to the great discontentment of her\r\nmajesty, that they are suffered to leave their charge. But the most part\r\nof the gallants have quitted their commands, places, and companies, not\r\nwilling to stay there after him; so that the disorder seems to be\r\ngreater there than stands with the safety of that service.\" Harrington\r\nthe wit and poet had the misfortune to be one of the threescore \"idle\r\nknights,\" dubbed by the lord deputy during his short and inglorious\r\nreign, and likewise one of the officers whom he selected to accompany\r\nhim in his return; and we may learn from two of his own letters, written\r\nseveral years subsequently, after what manner he was welcomed on his\r\narrival by his royal godmother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Sir John Harrington to Dr. Still, the bishop of Bath and Wells._ 1603.\r\n\r\n\"My worthy lord,\r\n\r\n\"I have lived to see that d----e rebel Tyrone brought to England,\r\ncourteously favored, honored, and well-liked. O! my lord, what is there\r\nwhich doth not prove the inconstancy of worldly matters! How did I labor\r\nafter that knave's destruction! I was called from my home by her\r\nmajesty's command, adventured perils by sea and land; endured toil, was\r\nnear starving, ate horse-flesh at Munster; and all to quell that man,\r\nwho now smileth in peace at those that did hazard their lives to destroy\r\nhim. Essex took me to Ireland, I had scant time to put on my boots; I\r\nfollowed with good will, and did return with the lord-lieutenant to meet\r\nill-will; I did bear the frowns of her that sent me; and were it not for\r\nher good liking, rather than my good deservings, I had been sore\r\ndiscountenanced indeed. I obeyed in going with the earl to Ireland, and\r\nI obeyed in coming with him to England. But what did I encounter\r\nthereon? Not his wrath, but my gracious sovereign's ill humor. What did\r\nI advantage? Why truly a knighthood; which had been better bestowed by\r\nher that sent me, and better spared by him that gave it. I shall never\r\nput out of memory her majesty's displeasure; I entered her chamber, but\r\nshe frowned and said. 'What, did the fool bring you too? Go back to your\r\nbusiness.' In sooth these words did sore hurt him that never heard such\r\nbefore; but Heaven gave me more comfort in a day or two after. Her\r\nmajesty did please to ask me concerning our northern journeys, and I did\r\nso well quit me of the account, that she favoured me with such discourse\r\nthat the earl himself had been well glad of. And now doth Tyrone dare us\r\nold commanders with his presence and protection.\" &c.[134]\r\n\r\n[Note 134: Nugae.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Sir John Harrington to Mr. Robert Markham_, 1606.\r\n\r\n\"My good cousin,\r\n\r\n\"Herewith you will have my journal, with our history during our march\r\nagainst the Irish rebels. I did not intend any eyes should have seen\r\nthis discourse but my own children's; yet alas! it happened otherwise;\r\nfor the queen did so ask, and I may say, demand my account, that I could\r\nnot withhold showing it; and I, even now, almost tremble to rehearse her\r\nhighness' displeasure hereat. She swore by God's son, we were all idle\r\nknaves, and the lord deputy worse, for wasting our time and her commands\r\nin such-wise as my journal doth write of.\r\n\r\n\"I could have told her highness of such difficulties, straits, and\r\nannoyance, as did not appear therein to her eyes, nor, I found, could be\r\nbrought to her ear; for her choler did outrun all reason, though I did\r\nmeet it at a second hand. For what show she gave at first to my lord\r\ndeputy at his return, was far more grievous, as will appear in good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I marvel to think what strange humors do conspire to patch up the\r\nnatures of some minds. The elements do seem to strive which shall\r\nconquer and rise above the other. In good sooth our late queen did\r\ninfold them all together. I bless her memory for all her goodness to me\r\nand my family; and now will I show you what strange temperament she did\r\nsometimes put forth. Her mind was oftimes like the gentle air that\r\ncometh from the westerly point in a summer's morn; 'twas sweet and\r\nrefreshing to all around her. Her speech did win all affections, and her\r\nsubjects did try to show all love to her commands; for she would say,\r\nher state did require her to command what she knew her people would\r\nwillingly do from their own love to her. Herein did she show her wisdom\r\nfully; for who did choose to lose her confidence; or who would withhold\r\na show of love and obedience, when their sovereign said it was their own\r\nchoice, and not her compulsion? Surely she did play well her tables to\r\ngain obedience thus without constraint; again could she put forth such\r\nalterations, when obedience was lacking, as left no doubtings whose\r\ndaughter she was. I say this was plain on the lord deputy's coming home,\r\nwhen I did come into her presence. She chafed much, walked fastly to and\r\nfro, looked with discomposure in her visage; and I remember, she\r\ncatched my girdle when I kneeled to her, and swore, 'By God's son I am\r\nno queen, that _man_ is above me;--who gave him command to come here so\r\nsoon? I did send him on other business.' It was long before more\r\ngracious discourse did fall to my hearing; but I was then put out of my\r\ntrouble, and bid go home. I did not stay to be bidden twice; if all the\r\nIrish rebels had been at my heels, I should not have made better speed,\r\nfor I did now flee from one whom I both loved and feared too[135].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 135: Nugae.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fate of Essex remained long in suspense; while several little\r\ncircumstances seemed to indicate the strength of her majesty's\r\nresentment against him; especially her denying, to the personal request\r\nof lady Walsingham, permission for the earl to write to his countess,\r\nher daughter, who was in childbed and exceedingly troubled that she\r\nneither saw nor heard from her husband; and afterwards her refusing to\r\nallow his family physician access to him, though he was now so ill as to\r\nbe attended by several other physicians, with whom however Dr. Brown was\r\npermitted to consult. At the same time it was given out, that if he\r\nwould beg his liberty for the purpose of going back to Ireland, it would\r\nbe granted him;--but he appeared resolute never to return thither, and\r\nprofessed a determination of leading henceforth a retired life in the\r\ncountry, free from all participation in public affairs.\r\n\r\nPamphlets were written on his case, but immediately suppressed by\r\nauthority, and perhaps at the request of the earl himself, whose\r\nbehaviour at this time exhibited nothing but duty and submission. His\r\nsister lady Rich, and lady Southampton, quitted Essex house and went\r\ninto the country, because the resort of company to them had given\r\noffence. He himself neither saw nor desired to see any one. His very\r\nservants were afraid to meet in any place to make merry lest it might be\r\nill taken. \"At the court,\" says Whyte, \"lady Scrope is only noted to\r\nstand firm to him, for she endures much at her majesty's hands because\r\nshe daily does all kind offices of love to the queen in his behalf. She\r\nwears all black; she mourns and is pensive, and joys in nothing but in a\r\nsolitary being alone. And 'tis thought she says much that few would\r\nventure to say but herself.\" This generous woman was daughter to the\r\nfirst lord Hunsdon, and nearly related both to the queen and to Essex.\r\nShe was sister to the countess of Nottingham who is believed to have\r\nacted so opposite a part.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of October strong hopes were entertained of the earls\r\nenlargement; but it was said that \"he stood to have his liberty by the\r\nlike warrant he was committed.\" The secretary was pleased to express to\r\nhim the satisfaction that he felt in seeing her majesty so well appeased\r\nby his demeanor, and his own wish to promote his good and contentment.\r\nThe reasons which he had assigned for his conduct in Ireland appeared to\r\nhave satisfied the privy-council and mollified the queen. But her\r\nmajesty characteristically declared, that she would not bear the blame\r\nof his imprisonment; and before she and her council could settle amongst\r\nthem on whom it should be made to rest, a new cause of exasperation\r\narose. Tyrone, in a letter to Essex which was intercepted, declared that\r\nhe found it impossible to prevail on his confederates to observe the\r\nconditions of truce agreed upon between them; and the queen, relapsing\r\ninto anger, triumphantly asked if there did not now appear good cause\r\nfor the earl's committal? She immediately made known to lord Montjoy her\r\nwish that he should undertake the government of Ireland; but the\r\nfriendship of this nobleman to Essex, joined with a hope that the queen\r\nmight be induced to liberate him by a necessity of again employing his\r\ntalents in that country, induced Montjoy to excuse himself. The council\r\nunanimously recommended to her majesty the enlargement of the prisoner;\r\nbut she angrily replied, that such contempts as he had been guilty of\r\nought to be openly punished. They answered, that by her sovereign power\r\nand the rigor of law, such punishment might indeed be inflicted, but\r\nthat it would be inconsistent with her clemency and her honor; she\r\nhowever caused heads of accusation to be drawn up against him. All this\r\ntime Essex continued very sick; and his high spirit condescended to\r\nsupplications like the following.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When the creature entereth into account with the Creator, it can never\r\nnumber in how many things it needs mercy, or in how many it receives it.\r\nBut he that is best stored, must still say _da nobis hodie_; and he that\r\nhath showed most thankfulness, must ask again, _Quid retribuamus_? And\r\nI can no sooner finish this my first audit, most dear and most admired\r\nsovereign, but I come to consider how large a measure of his grace, and\r\nhow great a resemblance of his power, God hath given you upon earth; and\r\nhow many ways he giveth occasion to you to exercise these divine offices\r\nupon us, that are your vassals. This confession best fitteth me of all\r\nmen; and this confession is most joyfully and most humbly now made by me\r\nof all times. I acknowledge upon the knees of my heart your majesty's\r\ninfinite goodness in granting my humble petition. God, who seeth all, is\r\nwitness, how faithfully I do vow to dedicate the rest of my life, next\r\nafter my highest duty, in obedience faith and zeal to your majesty,\r\nwithout admitting any other worldly care; and whatsoever your majesty\r\nresolveth to do with me, I shall live and die\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's humblest vassal,\r\n\r\n\"ESSEX.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earl abased himself in vain; those courtiers who had formerly\r\nwitnessed her majesty's tenderness and indulgence towards him, now\r\nwondered at the violence of her resentment; and somewhat of mystery\r\nstill involves the motives of her conduct. At one time she deferred his\r\nliberation \"because she heard that some of his friends and followers\r\nshould say he was wrongfully imprisoned:\" and the French ambassador who\r\nspoke for him, found her very short and bitter on that point. Soon\r\nafter, however, on hearing that he continued very sick and was making\r\nhis will, she was surprised into some signs of pity, and gave orders\r\nthat a few of his friends should be admitted to visit him, and that he\r\nshould be allowed the liberty of the garden. Alarmed at these\r\nrelentings, Raleigh, to whose nature the basest court arts were not\r\nrepugnant, thought proper to fall sick in his turn, and was healed in\r\nlike manner by a gracious message from the queen. The countess of Essex\r\nwas indefatigable in her applications to persons in power, but with\r\nlittle avail; all that was gained for the dejected prisoner was effected\r\nby the intercession of some of the queen's favorite ladies, who obtained\r\nleave for his two sisters to come to court and solicit for him. Soon\r\nafter, the storm seemed to gather strength again;--a warrant was made\r\nout for the earl's committal to the Tower, and though it was not carried\r\ninto force, \"the hopes of liberty grew cold.\" About the middle of\r\nNovember lord Montjoy received orders to prepare for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the first part of a history in Latin of the life and\r\nreign of Henry IV. by sir John Hayward, dedicated to the earl of Essex,\r\nwas the unfortunate occasion of fresh offence to the queen; the subject,\r\nas containing the deposition of a lawful prince, was in itself\r\nunpalatable; but what gave the work in her jealous eyes a peculiar and\r\nsinister meaning was an expression addressed to the earl which may be\r\nthus rendered: \"You are great both in present judgement and future\r\nexpectation.\"\r\n\r\nHayward was detained a considerable time in prison; and the queen, from\r\nan idle suspicion that the piece was in fact the production of some more\r\ndangerous character, declared that she would have him racked to\r\ndiscover the secret. \"Nay, Madam,\" answered Francis Bacon, \"he is a\r\nDoctor; never rack his person, but rack his style. Let him have pen, ink\r\nand paper, and help of books, and be enjoined to continue the story\r\nwhere it breaketh off; and I will undertake, by collating the styles, to\r\njudge whether he were the author or no.\" And thus her mind was diverted\r\nfrom this atrocious purpose!\r\n\r\nMeasures had now been carried too far against the earl to admit of his\r\nspeedy restoration to favor, whatever might be the secret sentiments of\r\nher majesty in his behalf; and her conduct respecting him preserved a\r\nvacillating and undecided character which marks the miserable perplexity\r\nof her mind, no longer enlightened by the clear and dispassionate\r\njudgement of Burleigh.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she spoke of the earl with such favor as greatly\r\ntroubled the opposite party. Soon after, on his sending to her his\r\npatents of master of the horse and master of the ordnance, she\r\nimmediately returned them to him; and at the same time his lady had\r\nleave to visit him. Two days after, the queen ordered a consultation of\r\neight physicians upon his case, who gave little hope of his life, but\r\nearnestly recommended that his mind should be quieted; on which, unable\r\nlonger to conceal her feelings, she sent Dr. James to him with some\r\nbroth and the message, that he should comfort himself, and that if she\r\nmight consistently with her honor she would visit him; and it was noted\r\nthat she had tears in her eyes as she spoke. But it was soon after\r\nhinted to her, that though divines watched by the bed of the earl and\r\npublicly prayed for him in their pulpits, some of them \"with speeches\r\ntending to sedition,\" his life was in no real danger. On this, she\r\nrefused his sisters, his son, and his mother-in-law permission to visit\r\nhim, and ceased to make inquiries after his health, which was in no long\r\ntime restored. A rich new year's gift, which was sent \"as it were in a\r\ncloud no man knew how,\" but thought to come from the earl, was left for\r\nsome time in the hands of sir William Knolles, as neither accepted nor\r\nrefused, but finally rejected with disdain on some new accession of\r\nanger. Yet the letters of lady Rich in his behalf were read, and her\r\nmany presents received, as well as one from the countess of Leicester.\r\n\r\nLady Essex was now restrained for a time from making her daily visits to\r\nher husband, and the queen declared her intention of bringing him before\r\nthe Star-chamber; but on his writing a very submissive letter, which was\r\ndelivered by the secretary, the design was dropped; and the secretary,\r\nwho had been earnest in his intercession with her majesty to spare this\r\ninfliction, gained in consequence much credit with the public. About the\r\nmiddle of March the earl was suffered to remove, under the\r\nsuperintendance of a keeper, to his own house; for which he returned\r\nthanks to her majesty in very grateful terms, saying that \"this further\r\ndegree of her goodness sounded in his ears as if she had said, 'Die not,\r\nEssex; for though I punish thine offence, and humble thee for thy good,\r\nyet will I one day be served again by thee.' And my prostrate soul,\" he\r\nadds, \"makes this answer, 'I hope for that blessed day.'\" Two months\r\nafterwards, however, perceiving no immediate prospect of his return to\r\nfavor or to liberty, he addressed her in a more expostulating style,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Before all letters written with this hand be banished, or he that sends\r\nthis enjoin himself eternal silence, be pleased, I humbly beseech your\r\nmajesty, to read over these few lines. At sundry times and by several\r\nmessengers, I received these words as your majesty's own; that you meant\r\nto correct, but not to ruin. Since which time, when I languished in four\r\nmonths sickness; forfeited almost all that I was able to engage; felt\r\nthe very pangs of death upon me; and saw that poor reputation,\r\nwhatsoever it was, that I had hitherto enjoyed, not suffered to die with\r\nme, but buried and I alive; I yet kissed your majesty's fair correcting\r\nhand, and was confident in your royal words. For I said unto myself,\r\nBetween my ruin and my sovereign's favor there is no mean: and if she\r\nbestow favor again, she gives with it all things that in this world I\r\neither need or desire. But now, the length of troubles, and the\r\ncontinuance, or rather the increase, of your majesty's indignation, hath\r\nmade all men so afraid of me, as mine own state is not only ruined, but\r\nmy kind friends and faithful servants are like to die in prison because\r\nI cannot help myself with mine own. Now I do not only feel the\r\nintolerable weight of your majesty's indignation, and am subject to\r\ntheir wicked information that first envied me for my happiness in your\r\nfavor and now hate me out of custom; but, as if I were thrown into a\r\ncorner like a dead carcase, I am gnawed on and torn by the vilest and\r\nbasest creatures upon earth. The tavern-haunter speaks of me what he\r\nlists. Already they print me and make me speak to the world, and shortly\r\nthey will play me in what forms they list upon the stage. The least of\r\nthese is a thousand times worse than death. But this is not the worst of\r\nmy destiny; for your majesty, that hath mercy for all the world but me,\r\nthat hath protected from scorn and infamy all to whom you once vowed\r\nfavor but Essex, and never repented you of any gracious assurance you\r\nhad given till now; your majesty, I say, hath now, in this eighth month\r\nof my close imprisonment (as if you thought my infirmities, beggary and\r\ninfamy, too little punishment for me), rejected my letters, refused to\r\nhear of me, which to traitors you never did. What therefore remaineth\r\nfor me? Only this, to beseech your majesty on the knees of my heart, to\r\nconclude my punishment, my misery and my life together; that I may go to\r\nmy Saviour, who hath paid himself a ransom for me, and whom, methinks, I\r\nstill hear calling me out of this unkind world, in which I have lived\r\ntoo long, and once thought myself too happy.\r\n\r\n\"From your majesty's humblest servant,\r\n\r\n\"ESSEX.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length, the queen prepared to make an end of this lingering business;\r\nthe earl's entreaties that it might not be made a Star-chamber matter\r\nwere listened to, and eighteen commissioners were selected out of the\r\nprivy-council, to discuss his conduct, hear his accusation and defence,\r\nand finally pronounce upon him such a _censure_, for it was not to be\r\ncalled a _sentence_, as they should see fit. The crown lawyers,--amongst\r\nwhom Francis Bacon chose to take his place, though the queen had offered\r\nto excuse his attendance on account of the ties of gratitude which ought\r\nto have attached him to Essex,--spoke one after another in aggravation\r\nof his offence; and some of them, as the attorney-general (Coke), with\r\ngreat virulence of language. Next came the prisoner's defence, which he\r\npronounced kneeling;--an attitude in which he was suffered to remain\r\nduring a great part of the proceedings. He began with a humble avowal of\r\nhis errors, and many expressions of penitence and humility towards her\r\nmajesty; a temperate apology for particular parts of his conduct,\r\nfollowed; but as he was proceeding to reflect in some points on the\r\nconduct of the Irish council, and to refute the exaggerated charges of\r\nhis enemies, he was interrupted by the lord keeper, who reminded him\r\nthat this was not a course likely to do him good. The earl explained\r\nthat he had no wish but to clear himself of disloyalty; it was answered,\r\nthat with this he never had been charged. The pathetic eloquence of the\r\nnoble prisoner moved many of the council to tears, and was not without\r\nits effect on his enemies themselves. The secretary, who was the first\r\nto rise in reply, even in refuting a part of his excuses, did him\r\njustice in other points, and treated him on the whole with great\r\ncourtesy. Finally, it was the unanimous censure of the council, that\r\nthe earl should abstain from exercising the functions of\r\nprivy-councillor, earl marshal, or master of the ordnance; that he\r\nshould return to his own house, and there remain a prisoner as before,\r\ntill it should please her majesty to remit both this and all the other\r\nparts of the sentence.\r\n\r\nBy this solemn hearing the mind of the queen was much tranquillized;\r\nbecause her grave councillors and learned judges in their speeches,\r\n\"amplifying her majesty's clemency and the earl's offences, according to\r\nthe manner in the Star-chamber,\" had held him worthy of much more\r\npunishment than he had yet received. A few days after her majesty\r\nrepaired to lady Russel's house in Blackfriars to grace the nuptials of\r\nher daughter, a maid of honor, with lord Herbert, son of the earl of\r\nWorcester;--on which occasion it may be mentioned, that she was conveyed\r\nfrom the water-side in a _lectica_, or half-litter, borne by six\r\nknights. After dining with the wedding company, she passed to the\r\nneighbouring house of lord Cobham to sup. Here she was entertained with\r\na mask of eight ladies, who, after performing their appointed part,\r\nchose out eight ladies more to dance the measure, when Mrs. Fitton the\r\nprincipal masker came and \"wooed\" the queen also to dance. Her majesty\r\ninquired who she was? \"Affection,\" she replied. \"_Affection_,\" said the\r\nqueen, \"_is false_;\" yet she rose and danced.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was now possessed with a strange fancy of _unmaking_ the\r\nknights made by Essex; being flattered in this folly by Bacon, who\r\nassured her, certainly in contradiction to all the laws of chivalry,\r\nthat her general had no right to confer that degree after a prohibition\r\nlaid upon him by her majesty. She was resolved to command at least that\r\nno ancient gentleman should give place to these new knights; and she had\r\nactually signed the warrant for a proclamation to this effect, when the\r\ntimely interference of the secretary saved her from thus exposing\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nLate in August 1600, the earl was acquainted in form by the\r\nprivy-council that his liberty was restored, but that he was still\r\nprohibited from appearing at court. He answered, that it was his design\r\nto lead a retired life at his uncle's in Oxfordshire, yet he begged\r\ntheir intercession that he might be admitted to kiss the queen's hand\r\nbefore his departure. But this was still too great a favor to be\r\naccorded, and he was informed, that though free from restraint, he was\r\nstill to regard himself as under indignation; a distinction which served\r\nto deter all but his nearest relations from resorting to him.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year, Vereiken, an ambassador from Flanders, was\r\nvery honorably received by the queen, whose counsels had assumed a more\r\npacific aspect since the disgrace of Essex.\r\n\r\nWhyte informs us, with his usual minuteness, that the ambassador was\r\nlodged with alderman Baning in Dowgate; and that he was fetched to court\r\nin great state, the whole household being drawn up in the hall; the\r\ngreat ladies and fair maids appearing \"excellently brave\" in the rooms\r\nthrough which he passed; and the queen, very richly dressed and\r\nsurrounded by her council, extending to him a most gracious reception.\r\nHe solemnly congratulated himself on the happiness of beholding her\r\nmajesty, \"who for _beauty_ and wisdom did excel all other princes of the\r\nearth;\" and she, in requital, promised to consider of his proposals. The\r\nnegotiation proved in the end abortive; but great offence was taken at\r\nthe publication in this juncture of a letter by the earl of Essex\r\nagainst a peace with Spain.\r\n\r\nRaleigh was at this time leaving London in discontent because nothing\r\nwas done for him;--it does not appear what was now the particular object\r\nof his solicitation; but a writer has recorded it as an instance of the\r\nprudent reserve of Elizabeth in the advancement of her courtiers, that\r\nshe would never admit the eloquent and ambitious Raleigh to a seat at\r\nher council-board[136].\r\n\r\n[Note 136: Bohun's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her extreme anxiety for the fate of Ireland,--where\r\nTyrone for the present carried all things at his will, boasting himself\r\nthe champion of the Romish cause, and proclaiming his expectation of\r\nSpanish aid; and of her more intimate and home-felt uneasiness\r\nrespecting the effect of her measures of chastisement on the haughty\r\nmind of Essex,--we find Elizabeth promoting with some affectation the\r\namusements of her court. \"This day,\" says Whyte, \"she appoints to see a\r\nFrenchman do feats upon a cord in the conduit court. Tomorrow she hath\r\ncommanded the bears, the bull and the ape to be baited in the\r\ntilt-yard; upon Wednesday she will have solemn dancing.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from sir Robert Sidney to sir John Harrington, written some\r\ntime in this year, affords some not uninteresting traits of her\r\nbehaviour, mixed with other matters:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Worthy knight;\r\n\r\n\"Your present to the queen was well accepted of; she did much commend\r\nyour verse, nor did she less praise your prose.... The queen hath tasted\r\nyour dainties, and saith you have marvellous skill in cooking of good\r\nfruits. If I can serve you in your northern suit, you may command me....\r\nOur lawyers say, your title is well grounded in conscience, but that\r\nstrict law doth not countenance your recovering those lands of your\r\nancestors.... Visit your friends often, and please the queen by all you\r\ncan, _for all the great lawyers do much fear her displeasure_.... I do\r\nsee the queen often, she doth wax weak since the late troubles, and\r\nBurleigh's death doth often draw tears from her goodly cheeks; she\r\nwalketh out but little, meditates much alone, and sometimes writes in\r\nprivate to her best friends. The Scottish matters do cause much\r\ndiscourse, but we know not the true grounds of state business, nor\r\nventure further on such ticklish points[137]. Her highness hath done\r\nhonor to my poor house by visiting me, and seemed much pleased at what\r\nwe did to please her. My son made her a fair speech, to which she did\r\ngive most gracious reply. The women did dance before her, whilst the\r\ncornets did salute from the gallery; and she did vouchsafe to eat two\r\nmorsels of rich comfit cake, and drank a small cordial out of a golden\r\ncup. She had a marvellous suit of velvet, borne by four of her first\r\nwomen-attendants in rich apparel; two ushers did go before; and at going\r\nup stairs she called for a staff, and was much wearied in walking about\r\nthe house, and said she wished to come another day. Six drums and six\r\ntrumpets waited in the court, and sounded at her approach and departure.\r\nMy wife did bear herself in wonderous good liking, and was attired in a\r\npurple kirtle fringed with gold; and myself in a rich band and collar of\r\nneedlework, and did wear a goodly stuff of the bravest cut and fashion,\r\nwith an under body of silver and loops. The queen was much in\r\ncommendation of our appearances, and smiled at the ladies who in their\r\ndances often came up to the step on which the seat was fixed to make\r\ntheir obeisance, and so fell back into their order again. The younger\r\nMarkham did several gallant feats on a horse before the gate, leaping\r\ndown and kissing his sword, then mounting swiftly on the saddle, and\r\npassing a lance with much skill. The day well nigh spent, the queen went\r\nand tasted a small beverage that was set out in divers rooms where she\r\nmight pass, and then in much order was attended to her palace; the\r\ncornets and trumpets sounding through the streets.\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Note 137: The mysterious affair of the Gowrie conspiracy is\r\nprobably here alluded to.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fate of Essex was now drawing to a crisis. The mixture of severity\r\nand indulgence with which he had been treated;--her majesty's\r\nperseverance in refusing to readmit him to her presence, though all\r\nother liberty was restored to him;--her repeated assurances that she\r\nmeant only to chastise, not to ruin him, contrasted with the tedious\r\nduration of her anger and the utter uncertainty when, or by what means,\r\nit was to be brought to an end;--had long detained him in the mazes of a\r\ntormenting uncertainty: but he at length saw the moment when her\r\ndisposition towards him must be brought to a test which he secretly\r\nassured his adherents that he should regard as decisive.\r\n\r\nThe term for which the earl had held the lucrative farm of sweet wines\r\nwould expire at Michaelmas; he was soliciting its renewal; and on the\r\ndoubtful balance of success or failure his already wavering loyalty was\r\nsuspended. He spared on this occasion no expressions of humility and\r\ncontrition which might soften the heart of the queen:--He professed to\r\nkiss the hand and the rod with which he had been corrected; to look\r\nforward to the beholding again those blessed eyes, so long his Cynosure,\r\nas the only real happiness which he could ever enjoy; and he declared\r\nhis intention with Nebuchodonosor, to make his habitation with the\r\nbeasts of the field, to eat hay like an ox, and to be wet with the dews\r\nof heaven, until it should please the queen to restore him. To lord\r\nHenry Howard, who was the bearer of these dutiful phrases, Elizabeth\r\nexpressed her unfeigned satisfaction to find him in so proper a frame of\r\nmind; she only wished, she said, that his deeds might answer to his\r\nwords; and as he had long tried her patience, it was fit that she\r\nshould make some experiment of his humility. Her father would never have\r\nendured such perversity:--but she would not now look back:--All that\r\nglittered was not gold, but if such results came forth from her furnace,\r\nshe should ever after think the better of her chemistry. Soon after,\r\nhaving detected the motive of immediate interest which had inspired such\r\nmoving expressions of penitence and devotion, her disgust against Essex\r\nwas renewed; and in the end, she not only rejected his suit, but added\r\nthe insulting words, that an ungovernable beast must be stinted of his\r\nprovender, in order to bring him under management.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Essex could endure no more;--rage took possession of his\r\nsoul; and equally desperate in fortune and in mind, he prepared to throw\r\nhimself into any enterprise which the rashness of the worst advisers\r\ncould suggest. It was at this time that he is reported, in speaking of\r\nthe queen, to have used the expression, maliciously repeated to her by\r\ncertain court ladies,--that through old age her mind was become as\r\ncrooked as her carcase:--words which might have sufficed to plunge him\r\nat once from the height of favor into irretrievable ruin.\r\n\r\nThe doors of Essex-house, hitherto closed night and day since the\r\ndisgrace of the earl, were now thrown popularly open. Sir Gilly Merrick,\r\nhis steward, kept an open table for all military adventurers, men of\r\nbroken fortunes and malcontents of every party. Sermons were delivered\r\nthere daily by the most zealous and popular of the puritan divines, to\r\nwhich the citizens ran in crowds; and lady Rich, who had lately been\r\nplaced under restraint by the queen and was still in deep disgrace, on\r\naccount of her intermeddling in the affairs of her brother, and on the\r\nfurther ground of her scandalous intrigue with lord Montjoy, became a\r\ndaily visitant. The earl himself, listening again to the suggestions of\r\nhis secretary Cuff, whom he had once dismissed on account of his violent\r\nand dangerous character, began to meditate new counsels.\r\n\r\nAn eye-witness has thus impressively described the struggles of his mind\r\nat this juncture. \"It resteth with me in opinion, that ambition thwarted\r\nin its career doth speedily lead on to madness: herein I am strengthened\r\nby what I learn in my lord of Essex, who shifteth from sorrow and\r\nrepentance to rage and rebellion so suddenly as well proveth him devoid\r\nof good reason or right mind; in my last discourse he littered such\r\nstrange words, bordering on such strange designs, that made me hasten\r\nforth, and leave his presence. Thank heaven I am safe at home, and if I\r\ngo in such troubles again, I deserve the gallows for a meddling fool.\r\nHis speeches of the queen becometh no man who hath _mens sana in corpore\r\nsano_. He hath ill advisers, and much evil hath sprung from this source.\r\n\r\n\"The queen well knoweth how to humble the haughty spirit, the haughty\r\nspirit knoweth not how to yield, and the man's soul seemeth tossed to\r\nand fro like the waves of a troubled sea[138].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 138: Sir John Harrington in Nugae.]\r\n\r\nThe affinity of Essex to the crown by his descent from Thomas of\r\nWoodstock has been already adverted to;--it seems never to have awakened\r\nthe slightest jealousy in the mind of Elizabeth; but the absurd vaunts\r\nof some of his followers, commented upon by the malicious ingenuity of\r\nhis enemies, had sufficed to excite sinister suspicions in the bosom of\r\nthe king of Scots. For the purpose of counteracting these, lord Montjoy,\r\nnear the beginning of the earl's captivity, had sent Henry Leigh into\r\nScotland, to give the king assurance that Essex entertained none of the\r\nambitious views which had been imputed to him, but was, on the contrary,\r\nfirmly resolved to endure no succession but that of his majesty; further\r\nhinting at some steps for causing his right to be recognised in the\r\nlifetime of the queen. From this time a friendly correspondence had been\r\nmaintained between James and the Essex party; and Montjoy, on being\r\nappointed lord deputy of Ireland, had gone so far as to offer to the\r\nking to bring over to England such part of his army as, acting in\r\nconcert with the force that the earl would be able to raise, might\r\ncompass by force the object which they had in view. By some delay in the\r\nreturn of the messenger, added to the dilatoriness or reluctance of\r\nJames, this plan was frustrated; but some time after Essex, impatient\r\nalike of the disgrace and the inactivity of his present restraint, urged\r\nMontjoy to bring over his forces without waiting for the tardy\r\nco-operation of the king of Scots. The lord deputy replied, \"that he\r\nthought it more lawful to enter into such a course with one that had\r\ninterest in the succession than otherwise; and though he had been led\r\nbefore out of the opinion he had to do his country good by the\r\nestablishment of the succession, and to deliver my lord of Essex out of\r\nthe danger he was in; yet now his life appeared to be safe, to restore\r\nhis fortune only, and to save himself from the danger which hangs over\r\nhim by discovery, and to satisfy my lord of Essex's private ambition, he\r\nwould not enter into any enterprise of that\" kind[139].\r\n\r\n[Note 139: Confession of sir Charles Davers, in Birch's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nAfter this repulse, Essex as a last resource applied himself once more\r\nto the court of Scotland, and, with the disingenuousness inseparable\r\nfrom the conduct of political intrigue, exerted all his efforts to\r\ndeceive James into a belief that the party now in power were pensioners\r\nof Spain, hired to the support of the pretended title of the Infanta. He\r\nfurther alarmed the king by representing that the places most proper for\r\nthe reception of Spanish forces were all in the hands of the creatures\r\nof Cecil;--Raleigh being governor of Jersey, lord Cobham warden of the\r\nCinque Ports, lord Burleigh president of the North, and sir George Carew\r\npresident of Munster. In consequence, he urged James to lose no time in\r\nclaiming by his ambassadors a solemn acknowledgement of his title. These\r\nsuggestions were listened to; and Essex was animated to proceed in his\r\nperilous career by hopes of the speedy arrival of the Scottish embassy.\r\nIn the meantime he formed a council of five of the friends most devoted\r\nto his cause:--the earl of Southampton, sir Charles Davers, sir\r\nFerdinando Gorges, sir John Davis surveyor of the ordnance, and John\r\nLittleton esquire of Frankley. By this junto, which met privately at\r\nDrury-house, the plot was matured. The earl delivered in a list of one\r\nhundred and twenty nobles, knights and gentlemen, on whose attachment he\r\nthought he could rely: it was agreed that an attempt should be made to\r\nseize the palace, and to persuade or compel the queen to remove from her\r\ncouncils the enemies of the earl, and to summon a new parliament; and\r\ntheir respective parts were allotted to the intended actors in this\r\nscene of violence.\r\n\r\nMeantime the extraordinary concourse to Essex-house had fixed the\r\nattention of government, and measures were taken for obtaining\r\nintelligence of all that passed within its walls. Lord Henry Howard, who\r\nhad made a timely secession from the leader to whom, in terms of the\r\ngrossest adulation, he had professed everlasting and unlimited\r\nattachment, is believed to have discovered some of his secrets; and a\r\ndomestic educated with the earl from childhood, and entirely trusted by\r\nhim, had also the baseness to reveal his counsels. On the 7th of\r\nFebruary 1601, the privy-council, being fully informed of his\r\nproceedings, dispatched secretary Herbert to summon the earl to appear\r\nbefore them. But apprehensive that he was betrayed, and conscious that\r\nthe steps which he had already taken were incapable of being justified,\r\nthe earl excused himself from attending the council, and summoning\r\naround him the most confidential of his friends, he represented to them\r\nthat they were on the point of being committed to prison, and bade them\r\ndecide whether they would quietly submit themselves to the disposal of\r\ntheir enemies, or attempt thus prematurely to carry into effect the\r\ndesigns which they had meditated.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate which ensued, a person entered who pretended to be\r\ndeputed by the people of London to assure the earl of their cordial\r\nco-operation in his cause. This decided the question; Essex, with a more\r\ncheerful countenance, began to expatiate on the affection borne him by\r\nthe city, and his expectation of being joined by sheriff Smith with a\r\nthousand of the trained bands whom he commanded. The following morning\r\nwas fixed for the insurrection; and in the meantime emissaries were\r\ndispatched, who ran about the town in all directions, to spread among\r\nthe friends of the earl the alarm of a design upon his life by Cobham\r\nand Raleigh.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morrow the lord keeper, the lord chief justice, and sir W.\r\nKnolles comptroller of the household, arrived at Essex-house and\r\ndemanded entrance on the part of the queen. They themselves were with\r\ndifficulty admitted through the wicket of the gate, which was now kept\r\nshut and guarded; but all their servants, except the purse-bearer, were\r\nexcluded. They beheld the court-yard filled with a confused multitude,\r\nin the midst of which stood Essex accompanied by the earls of\r\nSouthampton and Rutland and many others. The lord keeper demanded in the\r\nname of her majesty the cause of this unusual concourse; adding an\r\nassurance that if any had injured his lordship, he should find redress.\r\nEssex in a vehement manner complained of letters counterfeited in his\r\nname,--of designs against his life,--of perfidious dealings towards him:\r\nbut the conference was interrupted by the clamors of the crowd, some of\r\nwhom threatened violence against the court-emissaries. Without further\r\nparley the earl conducted them into the house, where he ordered them to\r\nbe safely kept as hostages till his return from the city, whither he was\r\nhastening to take measures with the lord-mayor and sheriffs.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock he entered the city attended by the \"chief gallants\"\r\nof the time; as the earls of Southampton and Rutland, lords Sandys and\r\nMonteagle, sir Charles Davers, sir Christopher Blount, and many others.\r\nAs they passed Fleet-street, they cried, \"For the queen, for the queen!\"\r\nin other places they gave out that Cobham and Raleigh would have\r\nmurdered the earl in his bed; and the multitude, universally well\r\naffected to Essex, eagerly reported that he and the queen were\r\nreconciled, and that she had appointed him to ride in that triumphant\r\nmanner through the city to his house in Seething-lane. The lord-mayor\r\nhowever received warning from the privy-council to look well to his\r\ncharge, and by eleven the gates were closed and strongly guarded. The\r\nearl, though a good deal disconcerted at observing no preparations for\r\njoining him, made his way to the house of sheriff Smith; but this\r\nofficer slipped out at his back door and hastened to the lord-mayor for\r\ninstructions. He next proceeded to an armourer's and demanded\r\nammunition, which was refused; and while he was hastening to and fro,\r\nwithout aim or object as appears, lord Burleigh courageously entered\r\nthe city with a king-at-arms and half a score horse-men, and in two\r\nplaces proclaimed the earl and all his adherents traitors. A pistol was\r\nfired at him by one of the followers of Essex; but the multitude showed\r\nno disposition to molest him, and he hastened back to assure the queen\r\nthat a popular commotion was not at all to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe palace was now fortified and double-guarded; the streets were\r\nblocked up with carts and coaches; and the earl, after wandering in vain\r\nabout the town till two o'clock, finding himself joined by none of the\r\ncitizens and deserted by a great portion of his original followers,\r\ndetermined to make his way back to Essex-house. At Ludgate he was\r\nopposed by some troops posted there by order of the bishop; and drawing\r\nhis sword, he directed sir Christopher Blount to attack them; \"which he\r\ndid with great bravery, and killed Waite, a stout officer, who had been\r\nformerly hired by the earl of Leicester to assassinate sir Christopher,\r\nand was now abandoned by his company[140].\" In the end, however, the\r\nearl was repulsed with the loss of one young gentleman killed and sir\r\nChristopher Blount wounded and taken prisoner; and retreating with his\r\ndiminished band to the river side, he returned by water to his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n[Note 140: Birch's Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nHe was much disappointed to find that his three prisoners had been\r\nliberated in his absence by sir Ferdinando Gorges: but sanguine to the\r\nlast in his hopes of an insurrection of the citizens in his favor, he\r\nproceeded to fortify his house in the best manner that circumstances\r\nwould admit.\r\n\r\nIt was soon invested by a considerable force under the lord admiral, the\r\nearls of Cumberland and Lincoln, and other commanders. Sir Robert Sidney\r\nwas ordered to summon the little garrison to surrender, when the earl of\r\nSouthampton demanded terms and hostages; but being answered that none\r\nwould be granted to rebels, except that the ladies within the house and\r\ntheir women would be permitted to depart if they desired it, the\r\ndefenders declared their resolution to hold out, and the assault\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nLord Sandys, the oldest man in the party, encouraged the earl in the\r\nresolution which he once appeared to have adopted, of cutting a way\r\nthrough the assailants; observing, that the boldest courses were the\r\nsafest, and that at all events it was more honorable for men of quality\r\nto die sword in hand than by the axe of the executioner:--but Essex, who\r\nhad not yet resigned the flattering hopes of life, was easily moved by\r\nthe tears and cries of the surrounding females to yield to less\r\ncourageous, not more prudent, counsels. Captain Owen Salisbury, a brave\r\nveteran, seeing that all was lost, planted himself at a window\r\nbare-headed, for the purpose of being slain: on receiving from one of\r\nthe assailants a bullet on the side of his head, \"O!\" cried he, \"that\r\nthou hadst been so much my friend to have shot but a little lower!\" Of\r\nthis wound however he expired the next morning.\r\n\r\nAbout six in the evening the earl made known his willingness to\r\nsurrender, on receiving assurance, for himself and his friends, of civil\r\ntreatment and a legal trial; and permission for a clergyman named Aston\r\nto attend him in prison:--the lord admiral answered that of the two\r\nfirst articles there could be no doubt, and for the last he would\r\nintercede. The house was then yielded with all that were in it. During\r\nthat night the principal offenders were lodged in Lambeth-palace, the\r\nnext day they were conveyed to the Tower; while the common prisons\r\nreceived the accomplices of meaner rank.\r\n\r\nOn February 19th Essex and Southampton were brought to their trial\r\nbefore the house of peers; lord Buckhurst sitting as lord high steward.\r\nEssex inquired whether peers might not be challenged like common\r\njurymen, but was answered in the negative. He pleaded Not guilty;\r\nprofessed his unspotted loyalty to his queen and country, and earnestly\r\nlabored to give to his attempt to raise the city the color of a\r\nnecessary act of self-defence against the machinations of enemies from\r\nwhom his life was in danger. Had this interpretation of his conduct been\r\nadmitted, possibly his offence might not have come within the limits of\r\ntreason: but it was held, that his refusal to attend the council; the\r\nimprisonment of the three great officers sent to him by the queen; and\r\nabove all the consultations held at Drury-house for bringing soldiers\r\nfrom Ireland, for surprising the Tower, for seizing the palace, and for\r\ncompelling the queen to remove certain persons from her counsels and to\r\ncall a parliament, assigned to his overt acts the character of designs\r\nagainst the state itself. For the confessions of his accomplices, by\r\nwhich the secrets of the Drury-house meetings were brought to light, he\r\nwas evidently unprepared; and the native violence of his temper broke\r\nout in invectives against those associates by whom, as he falsely\r\npretended, all these criminal designs had been originally suggested to\r\nhis mind. This evidence, he said, had been elicited by the hope of\r\npardon and reward;--let those who had given it enjoy their lives with\r\nimpunity;--to him death was far more welcome than life. Whatever\r\ninterpretation lawyers might put upon it, the necessity of self-defence\r\nagainst Cobham, Raleigh and Cecil, had impelled him to raise the city;\r\nand he was consoled by the testimony of a spotless conscience. Lord\r\nCobham here rose, and protested that he had never acted with malice\r\nagainst the earl, although he had disapproved of his ambition. \"On my\r\nfaith,\" replied the earl, \"I would have given this right hand to have\r\nremoved from the queen such an informer and calumniator.\"\r\n\r\nHe afterwards proceeded to accuse sir Robert Cecil of having affirmed\r\nthat the title of the Infanta was equally well founded with that of any\r\nother claimant. But the secretary here stepped forward to entreat that,\r\nthe prisoner might be obliged to bring proof of his assertions; and it\r\nthus became manifest, and in the end was confessed with contrition by\r\nthe earl himself, that he had advanced this charge on false grounds.\r\n\r\nIt was with better reason that he reproached Francis Bacon, who then\r\nstood against him as queen's counsel, with the glaring inconsistency\r\nbetween his past professions and his present conduct. This cowardly\r\ndesertion of his generous and affectionate friend and patron,--or rather\r\nthis open revolt from him, this shameless attack upon him in the hour of\r\nhis extreme distress and total ruin,--forms indeed the foulest of the\r\nmany blots which stain the memory of this illustrious person: it may\r\neven be pronounced, on a deliberate survey of all its circumstances, the\r\nbasest and most profligate act of that reign, which yet affords\r\nexamples, in the conduct of its public men, of almost every species of\r\nprofligacy and baseness. That it continued to be matter of general\r\nreproach against him, clearly appears from the long and labored apology\r\nwhich Bacon thought it necessary, several years afterwards, to address\r\nto lord Montjoy, then earl of Devon;--an apology which extenuates in no\r\ndegree the turpitude of the fact; but which may be consulted for a\r\nnumber of highly curious, if authentic, particulars.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Southampton likewise pleaded Not guilty, and professed his\r\ninviolate fidelity towards her majesty: he excused whatever criminality\r\nhe might have fallen into by the warmth of his attachment for Essex, and\r\nbehaved throughout with a mildness and an ingenuous modesty which moved\r\nall hearts in his favor. After a trial of eleven hours, sentence of\r\nGuilty was unanimously pronounced on both the prisoners. Southampton in\r\nan affecting manner implored all present to intercede for him with her\r\nmajesty, and Essex, with great earnestness, joined in this petition of\r\nhis unfortunate friend: as to himself, he said, he was not anxious for\r\nlife; wishing for nothing more than to lay it down with entire fidelity\r\ntowards God and his prince.--Yet he would have no one insinuate to the\r\nqueen that he despised her mercy, though he believed he should not too\r\nsubmissively implore it; and he hoped all men would in their consciences\r\nacquit him, though the law had pronounced him guilty. Such was the lofty\r\ntone of self-justification assumed by Essex on this memorable occasion,\r\nwhen his pride was roused and his temper exasperated, by the open war of\r\nrecrimination and reproaches into which he had so unadvisedly plunged\r\nwith his personal enemies; and by the cruel and insolent invectives of\r\nthe crown lawyers. But he was soon to undergo on this point a most\r\nremarkable and total change.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the earl of Essex was deeply imbued with sentiments of\r\nreligion: from early youth he had conversed much with divines of the\r\nstricter class, whom he held in habitual reverence; and conscious in the\r\nconduct of his past life of many deviations from the Gospel rule of\r\nright, he now, in the immediate prospect of its violent termination,\r\nsurrendered himself into the hands of these spiritual guides with\r\nextraordinary humility and implicit submission. To the criminality of\r\nhis late attempt, his conscience was not however awakened; he seems to\r\nhave believed, that in contriving the fall of his enemies, he was at the\r\nsame time deserving the thanks of his country, oppressed by their\r\nmaladministration; and he repelled all the efforts of Dr. Dove, by whom\r\nhe was first visited, to inspire him with a different sense of this part\r\nof his conduct. Cut his favorite divine, Mr. Aston,--who is described\r\nby a contemporary as \"a man base, fearful and mercenary,\" in whom the\r\nearl was much deceived,--practised with more success upon his mind. By\r\nan artful pretext of believing him to have aimed at the crown, he first\r\ndrew him into a warm defence of his conduct on this point; then by\r\ndegrees into a confession of all that he had really plotted, and the\r\nconcurrence which he had found from others. This was the end aimed at by\r\nAston, or by the government which employed him: he professed that he\r\ncould not reconcile it to his conscience to conceal treasons so foul and\r\ndangerous; alarmed the earl with all the terrors of religion; and\r\nfinally persuaded him, that a full discovery of his accomplices was the\r\nonly atonement which he could make to heaven and earth. The humbled\r\nEssex was brought to entreat that several privy-councillors, of whom\r\nCecil by name was one, should be sent to hear his confessions; and so\r\nstrangely scrupulous did he show himself to leave nothing untold, that\r\nhe gave up even the letters of the king of Scots, and betrayed every\r\nprivate friend whom attachment to himself had ever seduced into an\r\nacquiescence in his designs, or a nice sense of honor withheld from\r\nbetraying them.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Nevil, for having only concealed projects in which he had\r\nabsolutely refused to concur, was thus exposed to the loss of his\r\nappointment of ambassador to France; to imprisonment, and to a long\r\npersecution;--and lord Montjoy might have suffered even capitally, had\r\nnot his good and acceptable service in Ireland induced the queen to wink\r\nat former offences. Cuff, the secretary of the earl, whom he sent for\r\nto exhort him to imitate his sincerity, sternly upbraided his master\r\nwith his altered mind, and his treachery towards those who had evinced\r\nthe strongest attachment to his service: but the earl remained unmoved\r\nby his reproaches, and calmly prepared for death in the full persuasion\r\nthat he had now worked out his own salvation.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had behaved on occasion of the late insurrection with all her\r\nwonted fortitude; even at the time when Essex was actually in the city\r\nand a false report was brought her of its revolt to him, \"she was never\r\nmore amazed,\" says Cecil in a letter to sir George Carew, \"than she\r\nwould have been to have heard of a fray in Fleet-street.\" But when, in\r\nthe further progress of the affair, she beheld her once loved Essex\r\nbrought to the bar for high-treason and condemned by the unanimous\r\nverdict of his peers; when it rested solely with herself to take the\r\nforfeit of his life or interfere by an act of special grace for his\r\npreservation,--her grief, her agitation and her perplexity became\r\nextreme. A sense of the many fine qualities and rare endowments of her\r\nkinsman,--his courage, his eloquence, his generosity, and the\r\naffectionate zeal with which he had served her:--indulgence for the\r\nyouthful impetuosity which had carried him out of the path of duty, not\r\nunmixed with compunction for that severe and contemptuous treatment by\r\nwhich she had exasperated to rebellion the spirit which mildness might\r\nhave softened into penitence and submission;--above all, the remaining\r\naffection which still lurked at the bottom of her heart, pleaded for\r\nmercy with a force scarcely to be withstood. On the other hand, the\r\ningratitude, the neglect, the insolence with which he had occasionally\r\ntreated her, and the magnitude of his offences, which daily grew upon\r\nher by his own confessions and those of his accomplices, fatally united\r\nto confirm the natural bias of her mind towards severity.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Thomas Leigh, one of the dark and desperate characters\r\nwhose service Essex had used in his criminal negotiations with Tyrone,\r\nby an atrocious plot for entering the palace, seizing the person of the\r\nqueen and compelling her to sign a warrant for the release of the two\r\nearls, renewed her fears and gave fresh force to her anger. Irresolute\r\nfor some days, she once countermanded by a special messenger the order\r\nfor the death of Essex; then, as repenting of her weakness, she signed a\r\nsecond warrant, in obedience to which he was finally, on February 25th,\r\nbrought to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe last scene was performed in a manner correspondent in all respects\r\nto the contrite and humiliated frame of mind to which the noble culprit\r\nhad been wrought. It was no longer the brave, the gallant, the haughty\r\nearl of Essex, the favorite of the queen, the admiration of the ladies,\r\nthe darling of the soldiery, the idol of the people;--no longer even the\r\nundaunted prisoner, pouring forth invectives against his enemies in\r\nanswer to the charges against himself; loudly persisting in the\r\ninnocence of his intentions, instead of imploring mercy for his actions,\r\nand defending his honor while he asserted a lofty indifference to\r\nlife;--it was a meek and penitent offender, profoundly sensible of all\r\nhis past transgressions, but taught to expect their remission in the\r\nworld to which he was hastening, through the fervency of his prayers and\r\nthe plenitude of his confessions; and prepared, as his latest act, to\r\nperform in public a solemn religious service, composed for his use by\r\nthe assistant clergy, whose directions he obeyed with the most\r\nscrupulous minuteness. Under a change so entire, even his native\r\neloquence had forsaken him. Sir Robert Cecil, who seems to have been a\r\ncool and critical spectator of the fatal scene, remarks to his\r\ncorrespondent that \"the conflict between the flesh and the soul did thus\r\nfar appear, that in his prayers he was fain to be helped; otherwise no\r\nman living could pray more christianly than he did.\"\r\n\r\nEssex had requested of the queen that he might be put to death in a\r\nprivate manner within the walls of the Tower, fearing, as he told the\r\ndivines who attended him, that \"the acclamations of the citizens should\r\nhave hoven him up.\" His desire in this point was willingly complied\r\nwith; but about a hundred nobles, knights and gentlemen witnessed the\r\ntransaction from seats placed near the scaffold. Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nchose to station himself at a window of the armory whence he could see\r\nall without being observed by the earl. This action, universally imputed\r\nto a barbarous desire of glutting his eyes with the blood of the man\r\nwhom he hated and had pursued with a hostility more unrelenting than\r\nthat of Cecil himself, was never forgiven by the people, who detested\r\nhim no less than they loved and admired his unfortunate rival. Several\r\nyears after, when Raleigh in his turn was brought to the same end in the\r\nsame place, he professed however, and perhaps truly, that the sorrowful\r\nspectacle had melted him to tears: meantime, he at least extracted from\r\nthe late events large gratification for another ruling passion of his\r\nbreast, by setting to sale his interest in procuring pardons to\r\ngentlemen concerned in the insurrection. Mr. Lyttleton in particular is\r\nrecorded to have paid him ten thousand pounds for his good offices, and\r\nMr. Bainham a sum not specified. The life of the earl of Southampton was\r\nspared, at the intercession chiefly of Cecil, but he was confined in the\r\nTower till the death of the queen: others escaped with short\r\nimprisonments and the imposition of fines, few of which were exacted;\r\nsir Fulk Greville having humanely made it his business to represent to\r\nthe queen that no danger was to be apprehended from a faction which had\r\nlost its leader. Four only of the principal conspirators suffered\r\ncapitally; sir Christopher Blount and sir Charles Davers, both\r\ncatholics, sir Gilly Merrick and Henry Cuff.\r\n\r\nThose ambassadors from the king of Scots on whose co-operation Essex had\r\nplaced his chief reliance, now arrived; and finding themselves too late\r\nfor other purposes, they obeyed their master's instructions in such a\r\ncase by offering to the queen his warmest congratulations on her escape\r\nfrom so foul and dangerous a conspiracy. They were further charged to\r\nmake secret inquiry whether James's correspondence with Essex and\r\nconcurrence in the late conspiracy had come to her knowledge; and\r\nwhether any measures were likely to be taken in consequence for his\r\nexclusion from the succession. The confessions of Essex to the\r\nprivy-councillors had indeed rendered Elizabeth perfectly acquainted\r\nwith the machinations of James; but resolute to refrain during the\r\nremnant of her days from all angry discussions with the prince whom she\r\nsaw destined to succeed her, she had caused the earl to be not only\r\nrequested, but commanded, to forbear the repetition of this part of his\r\nacknowledgements on the scaffold. She was thus left free to receive with\r\nall those demonstrations of amity which cost her nothing the compliments\r\nof James; and she remained deliberately ignorant of all that he desired\r\nher not to know. The Scottish emissaries had the further satisfaction of\r\ncarrying back to their master assurances of the general consent of\r\nEnglishmen in his favor, and in particular a pledge of the adherence of\r\nsecretary Cecil, who immediately opened a private correspondence with\r\nthe king, of which lord Henry Howard, who had formerly conducted that of\r\nEssex, became the willing medium.\r\n\r\nThere is good evidence that the peace of Elizabeth received an incurable\r\nwound by the loss of her unhappy favorite, which she daily found\r\nadditional cause to regret on perceiving how completely it had delivered\r\nher over to the domination of his adversaries; but she still retained\r\nthe resolution to pursue with unabated vigor the great objects on which\r\nshe was sensible that the mind of a sovereign ought to be with little\r\nremission employed. The memorable siege of Ostend, begun during this\r\nsummer by the archduke Albert, fixed her attention and that of Europe.\r\nThe defence was conducted by that able officer sir Francis Vere at the\r\nhead of a body of English auxiliaries, whom the States had enlisted with\r\nthe queen's permission, at their own expense. Henry IV., as if for the\r\npurpose of observing more nearly the event, had repaired to Calais. The\r\nqueen of England, earnestly desirous of a personal interview, wrote him\r\ntwo letters on the subject; and Henry sent in return marshal Biron and\r\ntwo other ambassadors of rank, with a train of three or four hundred\r\npersons, whom the queen received with high honors, and caused to\r\naccompany her in her progress. During her visit of thirteen days to the\r\nmarquis of Winchester at Basing, the French embassy was lodged at the\r\nhouse of lord Sandys, which was furnished for the occasion with plate\r\nand hangings from Hampton-court; the queen defraying all the charges,\r\nwhich were more than those of her own court at Basing. She made it her\r\nboast that she had in this progress entertained royally a royal\r\nambassador at her subjects' houses; which she said no other prince could\r\ndo. The meeting of the two sovereigns, in hopes of which Elizabeth had\r\nactually gone to Dover, could not for some unknown reason be at last\r\narranged; but Henry, at the particular instance of his friend and ally,\r\nsent Sully over in disguise to confer confidentially with her respecting\r\nan important political project which she had announced. This was no less\r\nthan a plan for humbling the house of Austria, and establishing a more\r\nperfect balance of power in Europe by uniting into one state the\r\nseventeen Flemish provinces. It was an idea, as Sully declared to her,\r\nwhich had previously occurred to Henry himself; and the coincidence was\r\nflattering to both; but various obstacles were found likely to retard\r\nits execution till a period to which Elizabeth could scarcely look\r\nforward. One advantage, however, was gained to the queen of England by\r\nthe interview;--the testimony of this celebrated statesman, recorded in\r\nhis own memoirs, to the solidity of her judgement and the enlargement of\r\nher views; and his distinct avowal that she was in all respects worthy\r\nof the high estimation which she had for more than forty years enjoyed\r\nby common consent of all the politicians of Europe.\r\n\r\nIreland was still a source to Elizabeth of anxiety and embarrassment. In\r\norder to sustain the expenses of the war, she suffered herself to be\r\nprevailed on to issue base money for the pay of the troops;--a\r\nmortifying circumstance, after the high credit which she had gained by\r\nthat restoration of the coin to its original standard which was one of\r\nthe first acts of her reign. Montjoy in the meantime was struggling with\r\nvigor and progressive success against the disorders of the country. With\r\nthe assistance of sir George Carew president of Munster, and other able\r\ncommanders, he was gradually reducing the inferior rebels and cutting\r\noff the supplies of Tyrone himself: but the courage of this insurgent\r\nwas still supported by the hope of aids from Spain; and during this\r\nsummer two bodies of Spanish troops, one of four thousand, the other of\r\ntwo thousand men, made good their landing. The larger number, under\r\nAquila, took possession of Kinsale; the smaller, under Ocampo, was\r\njoined by Tyrone and other rebels with all their forces. The appearance\r\nof affairs was alarming, since the catholic Irish every where welcomed\r\nthe Spaniards as deliverers and brethren: but Montjoy, after blockading\r\nAquila in Kinsale, marched boldly to attack Ocampo and his Irish allies;\r\ngave them a complete defeat, in which the Spanish general was made\r\nprisoner and Tyrone compelled to fly into Ulster; and afterwards\r\nreturning to the siege of Kinsale, compelled Aquila to capitulate on\r\ncondition of a safe conveyance to their own country for himself and all\r\nthe Spanish troops in the island.\r\n\r\nThe state of the queen's mind while the fate of Ireland seemed to hang\r\nin the balance, and while the impression made by the attempt of Essex\r\nwas still recent, is depicted in the following letter by sir John\r\nHarrington with his usual minuteness and vivacity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To sir Hugh Portman knight._ (Dated October 9th 1601.)\r\n\r\n\"...For six weeks I left my oxen and sheep and ventured to court....\r\nMuch was my comfort in being well received, notwithstanding it is an ill\r\nhour for seeing the queen. The madcaps are all in riot, and much evil\r\nthreatened. In good sooth I feared her majesty more than the rebel\r\nTyrone, and wished I had never received my lord of Essex's honor of\r\nknighthood. She is quite _disfavored_[141] and unattired, and these\r\ntroubles waste her much. She disregarded every costly cover that cometh\r\nto the table, and taketh little but manchet and succory pottage. Every\r\nnew message from the city doth disturb her, and she frowns on all the\r\nladies. I had a sharp message from her, brought by my lord Buckhurst,\r\nnamely thus. 'Go tell that witty fellow my godson to get home; it is no\r\nseason now to fool it here,' I liked this as little as she doth my\r\nknighthood, so took to my boots, and returned to the plough in bad\r\nweather. I must not say much even by this trusty and sure messenger, but\r\nthe many evil plots and designs hath overcome all her highness' sweet\r\ntemper. She walks much in her privy chamber, and stamps with her feet at\r\nill news, and thrusts her rusty sword at times into the arras in great\r\nrage. My lord Buckhurst is much with her, and few else since the city\r\nbusiness; but the dangers are over, and yet she always keeps a sword by\r\nher table. I obtained a short audience at my first coming to court, when\r\nher highness told me, if ill counsel had brought me so far from home,\r\nshe wished heaven might mar that fortune which she had mended. I made my\r\npeace in this point, and will not leave my poor castle of Kelston, for\r\nfear of finding a worse elsewhere, as others have done. I will eat\r\nAldborne rabbits, and get fish as you recommend from the man at\r\nCurry-Rival; and get partridge and hares when I can; and my venison\r\nwhere I can; and leave all great matters to those like them better than\r\nmyself.... I could not move in any suit to serve your neighbour B. such\r\nwas the face of things: and so disordered is all order that her highness\r\nhath worn but one change of raiment for many days, and swears much at\r\nthose that cause her griefs in such wise, to the no small discomfiture\r\nof all about her, more especially our sweet lady Arundel, that _Venus\r\nplus quam venusta_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 141: Changed in countenance.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the month of October 1601, the wants of her treasury compelled the\r\nqueen to call a parliament. Her procession to the house had something\r\ngloomy and ominous; the people, still resenting the death of their\r\nfavorite, whom they never could be taught to regard as a traitor to his\r\nsovereign, refused to gratify her ears as formerly with those\r\naffectionate acclamations on which this wise and gracious princess had\r\never placed so high a value. The house of commons however, in\r\nconsideration of her extraordinary expenses in the Irish wars, granted a\r\nsupply large beyond example. Having thus deserved well of her majesty,\r\nthey ventured to revive the topic of monopolies, the crying grievance of\r\nthe age, against which the former parliament had petitioned her, but\r\nwithout effect. It was universally allowed, that the granting of\r\nexclusive privileges to trade in certain articles was a prerogative\r\ninherent in the crown; and though the practice so lavishly adopted by\r\nElizabeth of providing in this manner for her courtiers without expense\r\nto herself, had rendered the evil almost intolerable, the ministerial\r\nmembers insisted strongly that no right existed in the house to frame a\r\nbill for its redress. It was maintained by them, that the dispensing\r\npower possessed by the queen would enable her to set at nought any\r\nstatute which could be made in this matter;--in short, that she was an\r\nabsolute prince; and consequently that the mode of petition, of which\r\nthe last parliament had proved the inefficacy, was the only course of\r\nproceeding open to them. Other members, in whose bosoms some sparks of\r\nliberty had now been kindled, supported the bill which had been offered\r\nto the house: the event was, that in the midst of the debate the queen\r\nsent for the speaker, to inform him that she would voluntarily cancel\r\nsome of the patents which had excited most discontent.\r\n\r\nThis concession, though extorted doubtless by necessity, was yet made\r\nwith so good a grace, that her faithful commons were filled with\r\nadmiration and gratitude. One member pronounced the message \"a gospel of\r\nglad tidings;\" others employed phrases of adulation equally profane;--a\r\ncommittee was appointed to return their acknowledgements to her majesty,\r\nwho kneeled for some time at her feet, while the speaker enlarged upon\r\nher \"preventing grace and all-deserving goodness,\" She graciously gave\r\nthanks to the commons for pointing out to her abuses which might\r\notherwise have escaped her notice; since the truth, as she observed, was\r\ntoo often disguised from princes by the persons about them, through\r\nmotives of private interest: and thus, with the customary assurances of\r\nher loving care over her loyal subjects, she skilfully accomplished her\r\nretreat from a contest in which she judged perseverance to be dangerous\r\nand final success at best uncertain. In her farewell speech, however,\r\nat the close of the session, she could not refrain from observing, in\r\nreference to this matter, that she perceived private respects to be\r\nmasked with them under public pretences. Such was the final parting\r\nbetween Elizabeth and her last parliament!\r\n\r\nThe year 1602 was not fertile of domestic incident. One of the most\r\nremarkable circumstances was a violent quarrel between the Jesuits\r\nand the secular priests in England. The latter accused the former,\r\nand not without reason, of having been the occasion, by their\r\nassassination-plots and conspiracies against the queen and government,\r\nof all the severe enactments under which the English catholics had\r\ngroaned since the fulmination of the papal bull against her majesty. In\r\nthe height of this dispute, intelligence was conveyed to the\r\nprivy-council of some fresh plots on the part of the Jesuits and their\r\nadherents; on which a proclamation was immediately issued, banishing\r\nthis order the kingdom on pain of death; and the same penalty was\r\ndeclared against all secular priests who should refuse to take the oath\r\nof allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe queen continued to pursue from habit, and probably from policy also,\r\namusements for which all her relish was lost. She went a-maying to Air.\r\nBuckley's at Lewisham, and paid several other visits in the course of\r\nthe year;--but her efforts were unavailing; the irrevocable past still\r\nhung upon her spirits. About the beginning of June, in a conversation\r\nwith M. de Beaumont the French ambassador, she owned herself weary of\r\nlife; then sighing, whilst her eyes filled with tears, she adverted to\r\nthe death of Essex; and mentioned, that being apprehensive, from his\r\nambition and the impetuosity of his temper, of his throwing himself into\r\nsome rash design which would prove his ruin, she had repeatedly\r\ncounselled him, during the two last years, to content himself with\r\npleasing her, and forbear to treat her with the insolent contempt which\r\nhe had lately assumed; above all, not to touch her sceptre; lest she\r\nshould be compelled to punish him by the laws of England, and not\r\naccording to her own laws; which he had found too mild and favorable to\r\ngive him any cause of fear: but that her advice, however salutary and\r\naffectionate, had proved ineffectual to prevent his ruin.\r\n\r\nA letter from sir John Harrington to his lady, dated December 27th,\r\n1602, gives the following melancholy picture of the state of his\r\nsovereign and benefactress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sweet Mall;\r\n\r\n\"I herewith send thee what I would God none did know, some ill-bodings\r\nof the realm and its welfare. Our dear queen, my royal godmother and\r\nthis state's natural mother, doth now bear some show of human infirmity;\r\ntoo fast, for that evil which we shall get by her death, and too slow,\r\nfor that good which she shall get by her releasement from pains and\r\nmisery. Dear Mall, how shall I speak what I have seen or what I have\r\nfelt? thy good silence in these matters emboldens my pen. For thanks to\r\nthe sweet God of silence, thy lips do not wanton out of discretion's\r\npath like the many gossiping dames we could name, who lose their\r\nhusbands' fast hold in good friends rather than hold fast their own\r\ntongues. Now I will trust thee with great assurance; and whilst thou\r\ndost brood over thy young ones in the chamber, thou shalt read the\r\ndoings of thy grieving mate in the court. I find some less mindful of\r\nwhat they are soon to lose, than of what they may perchance hereafter\r\nget: Now, on my own part, I cannot blot from my memory's table the\r\ngoodness of our sovereign lady to me, even, I will say, before born. Her\r\naffection to my mother, who waited in privy-chamber, her bettering the\r\nstate of my father's fortune (which I have, alas, so much worsted), her\r\nwatchings over my youth, her liking to my free speech and admiration of\r\nmy little learning and poesy, which I did so much cultivate on her\r\ncommand, have rooted such love, such dutiful remembrance of her princely\r\nvirtues, that to turn askant from her condition with tearless eyes,\r\nwould stain and foul the spring and fount of gratitude. It was not many\r\ndays since I was bidden to her presence; I blessed the happy moment, and\r\nfound her in most pitiable state; she bade the archbishop ask me if I\r\nhad seen Tyrone? I replied with reverence, that I had seen him with the\r\nlord deputy; she looked up with much choler and grief in her\r\ncountenance, and said: O! now it mindeth me that you was _one_ who saw\r\nthis man _elsewhere_[142], and hereat she dropped a tear and smote her\r\nbosom; she held in her hand a golden cup, which she often put to her\r\nlips; but in truth her heart seemeth too full to need more filling. This\r\nsight moved me to think of what passed in Ireland, and I trust she did\r\nnot less think on _some_ who were busier there than myself. She gave me\r\na message to the lord deputy, and bade me come to the chamber at seven\r\no'clock. Hereat some who were about her did marvel, as I do not hold so\r\nhigh place as those she did not choose to do her commands.... Her\r\nmajesty inquired of some matters which I had written; and as she was\r\npleased to note my fanciful brain, I was not unheedful to feed her\r\nhumour, and read some verses, whereat she smiled once, and was pleased\r\nto say: 'When thou dost feel creeping time at thy gate, these fooleries\r\nwill please thee less; I am past my relish for such matters; thou seest\r\nmy bodily meat doth not suit me well; I have eaten but one ill-tasted\r\ncake since yesternight.' She rated most grievously at noon at some one\r\nwho minded not to bring up certain matters of account: several men have\r\nbeen sent to, and when ready at hand, her highness hath dismissed in\r\nanger; but who, dearest Mall, shall say, that 'your highness hath\r\nforgotten?'\"\r\n\r\n[Note 142: Harrington had been at a conference held with him by\r\nEssex; for which he had been severely rated by the queen.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1602, lord Montjoy had been occupied in Ireland\r\nin reducing the inferior rebels to submission; in building forts and\r\nplanting garrisons; at the same time wasting the country in every\r\ndirection, for the purpose of straitening the quarters of Tyrone and\r\ncutting off his supplies. At length, having collected all his forces, he\r\npurposed to hazard an attack on the chieftain himself, in the midst of\r\nthe desert fastnesses to which he had driven him; but the difficulties\r\nwhich he experienced from the impassable state of the roads, the\r\ntreachery of scouts and the inclemency of the season, compelled him to\r\ndefer this undertaking till the return of spring. Meantime, such was the\r\nextremity of distress to which Tyrone had been reduced, that numbers of\r\nhis people had perished by hunger; and perceiving the remnant fast\r\ndiminishing by daily desertion, he renewed the offer of surrender on\r\ncertain conditions which he had propounded some months before. At that\r\ntime, Cecil had once prevailed upon her majesty, for the sake of\r\navoiding the intolerable expense of a further prosecution of the Irish\r\nwar, to sign the rebel's pardon;--but she had immediately retracted the\r\nconcession, and all that he was able finally to gain of her, by the\r\nintercession of the French ambassador, was a promise, that if Tyrone\r\nwere not taken by the lord deputy before winter, she would consent to\r\npardon him. About Christmas her council urged upon her the fulfilment of\r\nthis engagement; but she replied with warmth, that she would not begin\r\nat her age to treat with her subjects, nor leave such an ill example\r\nafter her decease[143].\r\n\r\n[Note 143: Carte.]\r\n\r\nThe importunities of her ministers, however, among whom Tyrone is said\r\nto have made himself friends, finally overpowered the reluctance of the\r\nqueen; and she authorized the deputy to grant the rebel his life, with\r\nsome part of the terms which he asked; but so extreme was her\r\nmortification in making this concession, that many have regarded it as\r\nthe origin of that deep melancholy to which she soon after fell a\r\nvictim. The council apprehended, or affected to apprehend, that Tyrone\r\nwould still refuse to surrender on the hard conditions imposed by the\r\nqueen; but so desperate was now his situation, that without even waiting\r\nto receive them, he had thrown himself at the feet of the deputy and\r\nsubmitted his lands and life to the queen's mercy. Ministers more\r\nresolute, or more disinterested, might therefore have spared her the\r\ndegradation, as she regarded it, of treating with a rebel. The news of\r\nhis final submission, which occurred four days only before her death,\r\nshe never learned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe closing scene of the long and eventful life of queen Elizabeth is\r\nall that now remains to be described; but that marked peculiarity of\r\ncharacter and of destiny which has attended her from the cradle, pursues\r\nher to the grave, and forbids us to hurry over as trivial and\r\nuninteresting the melancholy detail.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the state of bodily and mental indisposition in which\r\nshe was beheld by Harrington at the close of the year 1602, the queen\r\nhad persisted in taking her usual exercises of riding and hunting,\r\nregardless of the inclemencies of the season. One day in January she\r\nvisited the lord admiral, probably at Chelsea, and about the same time\r\nshe removed to her palace of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of March her illness suddenly increased; and it was\r\nabout this time that her kinsman Robert Cary arrived from Berwick to\r\nvisit her. In his own memoirs he has thus related the circumstances\r\nwhich he witnessed on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\"When I came to court I found the queen ill-disposed, and she kept her\r\ninner lodging; yet she, hearing of my arrival, sent for me. I found her\r\nin one of her withdrawing chambers, sitting low upon her cushions. She\r\ncalled me to her; I kissed her hand, and told her it was my chiefest\r\nhappiness to see her in safety and in health, which I wished might long\r\ncontinue. She took me by the hand, and wrung it hard, and said, 'No,\r\nRobin, I am not well;' and then discoursed with me of her indisposition,\r\nand that her heart had been sad and heavy for ten or twelve days, and in\r\nher discourse she fetched not so few as forty or fifty great sighs. I\r\nwas grieved at the first to see her in this plight; for in all my\r\nlifetime I never knew her fetch a sigh, but when the queen of Scots was\r\nbeheaded. Then, upon my knowledge, she shed many tears and sighs,\r\nmanifesting her innocence, that she never gave consent to the death of\r\nthat queen.\r\n\r\n\"I used the best words I could to persuade her from this melancholy\r\nhumour; but I found by her it was too deep rooted in her heart, and\r\nhardly to be removed. This was upon a Saturday night, and she gave\r\ncommand that the great closet should be prepared for her to go to chapel\r\nthe next morning. The next day, all things being in a readiness, we long\r\nexpected her coming. After eleven o'clock, one of the grooms came out\r\nand bade make ready for the private closet, she would not go to the\r\ngreat. There we stayed long for her coming, but at last she had cushions\r\nlaid for her in her privy-chamber hard by the closet door, and there she\r\nheard service.\r\n\r\n\"From that day forward she grew worse and worse. She remained upon her\r\ncushions four days and nights at the least. All about her could not\r\npersuade her either to take any sustenance or go to bed.... The queen\r\ngrew worse and worse because she would be so, none about her being able\r\nto go to bed. My lord-admiral was sent for, (who by reason of my\r\nsister's death, that was his wife, had absented himself some fortnight\r\nfrom court;) what by fair means what by force, he gat her to bed. There\r\nwas no hope of her recovery, because she refused all remedies.\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday the 23rd of March she grew speechless. That afternoon by\r\nsigns she called for her council, and by putting her hand to her head\r\nwhen the king of Scots was named to succeed her, they all knew he was\r\nthe man she desired should reign after her.\r\n\r\n\"About six at night she made signs for the archbishop and her chaplains\r\nto come to her; at which time I went in with them and sat upon my knees\r\nfull of tears to see that heavy sight. Her majesty lay upon her back\r\nwith one hand in the bed and the other without. The bishop kneeled down\r\nby her and examined her first of her faith; and she so punctually\r\nanswered all his several questions, by lifting up her eyes and holding\r\nup her hand, as it was a comfort to all the beholders.... After he had\r\ncontinued long in prayer, till the old man's knees were weary, he\r\nblessed her; and meant to rise and leave her. The queen made a sign with\r\nher hand. My sister Scrope, knowing her meaning, told the bishop the\r\nqueen desired he would pray still. He did so for a long half hour after,\r\nand then thought to leave her. The second time she made sign to have him\r\ncontinue in prayer. He did so for half an hour more, with earnest cries\r\nto God for her soul's health, which he uttered with that fervency of\r\nspirit, as the queen to all our sight much rejoiced thereat, and gave\r\ntestimony to us all of her christian and comfortable end. By this time\r\nit grew late, and every one departed, all but her women that attended\r\nher.... Between one and two o'clock of the Thursday morning, he that I\r\nleft in the cofferer's chamber brought me word that the queen was dead.\"\r\n\r\nA Latin letter written the day after her death to Edmund Lambert,\r\nwhether by one of her physicians or not is uncertain, gives an account\r\nof her sickness in no respect contradictory to Robert Cary's.\r\n\r\n\"It was after laboring for nearly three weeks under a morbid melancholy,\r\nwhich brought on stupor not unmixed with some indications of a\r\ndisordered fancy, that the queen expired. During all this time she could\r\nneither by reasoning, entreaties, or artifices be brought to make trial\r\nof any medical aid, and with difficulty was persuaded to receive\r\nsufficient nourishment to sustain nature; taking also very little sleep,\r\nand that not in bed, but on cushions, where she would sit whole days\r\nmotionless and sleepless; retaining however the vigor of her intellect\r\nto her last breath, though deprived for three days before her death of\r\nthe power of speech.\"\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary writes to his friend thus.... \"No doubt you shall\r\nhear her majesty's sickness and manner of death diversly reported; for\r\neven here the papists do tell strange stories, as utterly void of truth\r\nas of all civil honesty or humanity.... Here was some whispering that\r\nher brain was somewhat distempered, but there was no such matter; only\r\nshe held an obstinate silence for the most part; and, because she had a\r\npersuasion that if she once lay down she should never rise, could not be\r\ngot to go to bed in a whole week, till three days before her death....\r\nShe made no will, neither gave any thing away; so that they which come\r\nafter shall find a well-furnished jewel-house and a rich wardrobe of\r\nmore than two thousand gowns, with all things else answerable[144].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 144: Printed in Nichols's Progresses.]\r\n\r\nThat a profound melancholy was either the cause, or at least a leading\r\nsymptom, of the last illness of the queen, so many concurring\r\ntestimonies render indisputable; but the origin of this affection has\r\nbeen variously explained. Some, as we have seen, ascribed it to her\r\nchagrin on being in a manner compelled to grant the pardon of Tyrone;--a\r\ncause disproportioned surely to the effect. Others have imagined it to\r\narise from grief and indignation at the neglect which she began to\r\nexperience from the venal throng of courtiers, who were hastening to pay\r\ntimely homage to her successor. By others, again, her dejection has\r\nbeen regarded as nothing more than a natural concomitant of bodily\r\ndecay; a physical rather than a mental malady. But the prevalent\r\nopinion, even at the time, appears to have been, that the grief or\r\ncompunction for the death of Essex, with which she had long maintained a\r\nsecret struggle, broke forth in the end superior to control, and rapidly\r\ncompleted the overthrow of powers which the advances of old age and an\r\naccumulation of cares and anxieties had already undermined. \"Our queen,\"\r\nwrites an English correspondent to a Scotch nobleman in the service of\r\nJames, \"is troubled with a rheum in her arm, which vexeth her very much,\r\nbesides the grief she hath conceived for my lord of Essex's death. She\r\nsleepeth not so much by day as she used, neither taketh rest by night.\r\nHer delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes, with shedding tears,\r\nto bewail Essex.\"\r\n\r\nA remarkable anecdote first published in Osborn's Traditional Memoirs of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and confirmed by M. Maurier's Memoirs,--where it is\r\ngiven on the authority of sir Dudley Carleton the English ambassador in\r\nHolland, who related it to prince Maurice,--offers the solution of these\r\ndoubts. According to this story, the countess of Nottingham, who was a\r\nrelation, but no friend, of the earl of Essex, being on her death-bed,\r\nentreated to see the queen; declaring that she had something to confess\r\nto her before she could die in peace. On her majesty's arrival, the\r\ncountess produced a ring, which she said the earl of Essex had sent to\r\nher after his condemnation, with an earnest request that she would\r\ndeliver it to the queen, as the token by which he implored her mercy;\r\nbut which, in obedience to her husband, to whom she had communicated the\r\ncircumstance, she had hitherto withheld; for which she entreated the\r\nqueen's forgiveness. On sight of the ring, Elizabeth instantly\r\nrecognised it as one which she had herself presented to her unhappy\r\nfavorite on his departure for Cadiz, with the tender promise, that of\r\nwhatsoever crimes his enemies might have accused him, or whatsoever\r\noffences he might actually have committed against her, on his returning\r\nto her that pledge, she would either pardon him, or admit him at least\r\nto justify himself in her presence. Transported at once with grief and\r\nrage, on learning the barbarous infidelity of which the earl had been\r\nthe victim and herself the dupe, the queen shook in her bed the dying\r\ncountess, and vehemently exclaiming, that God might forgive her, but she\r\nnever could, flung out of the chamber.\r\n\r\nReturning to her palace, she surrendered herself without resistance to\r\nthe despair which seized her heart on this fatal and too late\r\ndisclosure.--Hence her refusal of medicine and almost of food;--hence\r\nher obstinate silence interrupted only by sighs, groans, and broken\r\nhints of a deep sorrow which she cared not to reveal;--hence the days\r\nand nights passed by her seated on the floor, sleepless, her eyes fixed\r\nand her finger pressed upon her mouth;--hence, in short, all those\r\nheart-rending symptoms of incurable and mortal anguish which conducted\r\nher, in the space of twenty days, to the lamentable termination of a\r\nlong life of power, prosperity and glory[145].\r\n\r\n[Note 145: See the evidence for this extraordinary story fully\r\nstated in Birch's Negotiations. On the whole, it appears sufficient to\r\nwarrant our belief; yet it should be remarked that the accounts which\r\nhave come down to us differ from each other in some important points,\r\nand are traceable to no original witness of the interview between the\r\nqueen and the countess.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe queen expired on March 24th 1603.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the minute and extended survey of the life and actions of\r\nElizabeth which has made the principal business of these pages, it would\r\nbe a trespass alike on the patience and the judgement of the reader to\r\ndetain him with a formal review of her character;--let it suffice to\r\ncomplete the portrait by a few additional touches.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial of her court rivalled the servility of the East: no\r\nperson of whatever rank ventured to address her otherwise than kneeling;\r\nand this attitude was preserved by all her ministers during their\r\naudiences of business, with the exception of Burleigh, in whose favor,\r\nwhen aged and infirm, she dispensed with its observance. Hentzner, a\r\nGerman traveller who visited England near the conclusion of her reign,\r\nrelates, that as she passed through several apartments from the chapel\r\nto dinner, wherever she turned her eyes he observed the spectators throw\r\nthemselves on their knees. The same traveller further relates, that the\r\nofficers and ladies whose business it was to arrange the dishes and give\r\ntastes of them to the yeomen of the guard by whom they were brought in,\r\ndid not presume to approach the royal table, without repeated\r\nprostrations and genuflexions and every mark of reverence due to her\r\nmajesty in person.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of her time and the arrangements of her domestic life\r\npresent more favorable traits.\r\n\r\n\"First in the morning she spent some time at her devotions; then she\r\nbetook herself to the dispatch of her civil affairs, reading letters,\r\nordering answers, considering what should be brought before the council,\r\nand consulting with her ministers. When she had thus wearied herself,\r\nshe would walk in a shady garden or pleasant gallery, without any other\r\nattendance than that of a few learned men. Then she took her coach and\r\npassed in the sight of her people to the neighbouring groves and fields,\r\nand sometimes would hunt or hawk. There was scarce a day but she\r\nemployed some part of it in reading and study; sometimes before she\r\nentered upon her state affairs, sometimes after them[146].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 146: Bohun's Character of Queen Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nShe slept little, seldom drank wine, was sparing in her diet, and a\r\nreligious observer of the fasts. She sometimes dined alone, but more\r\ncommonly had with her some of her friends. \"At supper she would divert\r\nherself with her friends and attendants, and if they made her no answer\r\nwould put them upon mirth and pleasant discourse with great civility.\r\nShe would then also admit Tarleton, a famous comedian and pleasant\r\ntalker, and other such men, to divert her with stories of the town and\r\nthe common jests and accidents.\"\r\n\r\n\"She would recreate herself with a game of chess, dancing or singing....\r\nShe would often play at cards and tables, and if at any time she\r\nhappened to win, she would be sure to demand the money.... She was\r\nwaited on in her bed-chamber by married ladies of the nobility; the\r\nmarchioness of Winchester widow, lady Warwick, and lady Scrope; and here\r\nshe would seldom suffer any to wait upon her but Leicester, Hatton,\r\nEssex, Nottingham, and Raleigh.... Some lady always slept in her\r\nchamber; and besides her guards, there was always a gentleman of good\r\nquality and some others up in the next chamber, to wake her if any thing\r\nextraordinary happened[147].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 147: Bohun's Character of Queen Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\n\"She loved a prudent and moderate habit in her private apartment and\r\nconversation with her own servants; but when she appeared in public she\r\nwas ever richly adorned with the most valuable clothes; set off again\r\nwith much gold and jewels of inestimable value; and on such occasions\r\nshe ever wore high shoes, that she might seem taller than indeed she\r\nwas. The first day of the parliament she would appear in a robe\r\nembroidered with pearls, the royal crown on her head, the golden ball in\r\nher left hand and the sceptre in her right; and as she never failed then\r\nof the loud acclamations of her people, so she was ever pleased with\r\nit, and went along in a kind of triumph with all the ensigns of majesty.\r\nThe royal name was ever venerable to the English people; but this\r\nqueen's name was more sacred than any of her ancestors.... In the\r\nfurniture of her palaces she ever affected magnificence and an\r\nextraordinary splendor. She adorned the galleries with pictures by the\r\nbest artists; the walls she covered with rich tapestries. She was a true\r\nlover of jewels, pearls, all sorts of precious stones, gold and silver\r\nplate, rich beds, fine couches and chariots, Persian and Indian carpets,\r\nstatues, medals, &c. which she would purchase at great prices.\r\nHampton-court was the most richly furnished of all her palaces; and here\r\nshe had caused her naval victories against the Spaniards to be worked in\r\nfine tapestries and laid up among the richest pieces of her wardrobe....\r\nWhen she made any public feasts, her tables were magnificently served\r\nand many side-tables adorned with rich plate. At these times many of the\r\nnobility waited on her at table. She made the greatest displays of her\r\nregal magnificence when foreign ambassadors were present. At these times\r\nshe would also have vocal and instrumental music during dinner; and\r\nafter dinner, dancing[148].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 148: Bohun's Character of Queen Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nThe queen was laudably watchful over the morals of her court; and not\r\ncontent with dismissing from her service, or banishing her presence,\r\nsuch of her female attendants as were found offending against the laws\r\nof chastity, she was equitable enough to visit with marks of her\r\ndispleasure the libertinism of the other sex; and in several instances\r\nshe deferred the promotion of otherwise deserving young men till she saw\r\nthem reform their manners in this respect. Europe had assuredly never\r\nbeheld a court so decent, so learned, or so accomplished as hers; and it\r\nwill not be foreign from the purpose of illustrating more fully the\r\ncharacter of the sovereign, to borrow from a contemporary writer a few\r\nparticulars on this head.\r\n\r\nIt was rare to find a courtier acquainted with no language but his own.\r\nThe ladies studied Latin, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and French. The \"more\r\nancient\" among them exercised themselves some with the needle, some with\r\n\"_caul work_,\" (probably netting) \"divers in spinningsilk, some in\r\ncontinual reading either of the Scriptures or of histories either of\r\ntheir own or foreign countries; divers in writing volumes of their own,\r\nor translating the works of others into Latin or English;\" while the\r\nyounger ones in the meantime applied to their \"lutes, citharnes,\r\npricksong and all kinds of music.\" Many of the elder sort were also\r\n\"skilful in surgery and distillation of waters, beside sundry artificial\r\npractices pertaining to the ornature and commendations of their bodies.\"\r\n\"This,\" adds our author, \"I will generally say of them all; that as each\r\nof them are cunning in something whereby they keep themselves occupied\r\nin the court, there is in manner none of them but when they be at home\r\ncan help to supply the ordinary want of the kitchen with a number of\r\ndelicate dishes of their own devising, wherein the _portingal_ is their\r\nchief counsellor, as some of them are most commonly with the clerk of\r\nthe kitchen,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"Every office,\" at court, had \"either a Bible or the book of the Acts\r\nand Monuments of the Church of England, or both, besides some histories\r\nand chronicles lying therein, for the exercise of such as come into the\r\nsame[149].\"\r\n\r\n[Note 149: Description of England prefixed to Holinshed's\r\nChronicles.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene over which Elizabeth presided;--such the companions\r\nwhom she formed to herself, and in whom she delighted! The new men and\r\nnew manners brought in by James I. served more fully to instruct the\r\nnation in the value of all that it had enjoyed under his illustrious\r\npredecessor, the vigor which had rendered her government respectable\r\nabroad; and the wise and virtuous moderation which caused it to beloved\r\nat home, were now recalled with that sense of irreparable loss which\r\nexalts to enthusiasm the sentiment of veneration and the principle of\r\ngratitude; and almost in the same proportion as the sanguinary bigotry\r\nof her predecessor had occasioned her accession to be desired, the\r\ndespicable weakness of her successor caused her decease to be regretted\r\nand deplored.\r\n\r\nIt was on the tenth anniversary of the proclamation of king James that\r\nthe eloquent Hall, in his sermon at Paul's Cross, gave utterance to the\r\ngeneral sentiment in the following animated apostrophe to the manes of\r\nthe departed sovereign:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"O blessed queen! the mother of this nation, the nurse of this church,\r\nthe glory of womanhood, the envy and example of foreign nations, the\r\nwonder of times, how sweet and sacred shall thy memory be to all\r\nposterity!--How excellent were her masculine graces of learning, valor\r\nand wisdom, by which she might justly challenge to be the queen of men!\r\nSo learned was she, that she could give present answer to ambassadors in\r\ntheir own tongues; so valiant, that like Zisca's drum made the proudest\r\nRomanist to quake; so wise, that whatsoever fell out happily against the\r\ncommon adversary in France, Netherland, Ireland, it was by themselves\r\nascribed to her policy.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I speak of her long and successful government, of her\r\nmiraculous preservations; of her famous victories, wherein the waters,\r\nwind, fire and earth fought for us, as if they had been in pay under\r\nher; of her excellent laws and careful execution? Many daughters have\r\ndone worthily, but thou surmountedest them all. Such was the sweetness\r\nof her government and such the fear of misery in her loss, that many\r\nworthy christians desired that their eyes might be closed before\r\nhers.... Every one pointed to her white hairs, and said, with that\r\npeaceable Leontius, \"When this snow melteth there will be a flood.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the preceding work, I have inserted some incidental\r\nnotices respecting the domestic architecture of the reign of Elizabeth;\r\nbut becoming gradually sensible of the interesting details of which the\r\nsubject was susceptible and entirely aware of my own inability to do it\r\njustice, I solicited, and esteem myself fortunate in having procured,\r\nthe following remarks from the pen of a brother who makes this noble art\r\nat once his profession and his delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nThe Reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the period of English history included in our present survey, the\r\nnobility continued for the most part to inhabit their ancient castles;\r\nedifices which, originally adapted by strength of situation and\r\nconstruction merely to defence, were now in many instances, by the\r\nalteration of the original buildings and by the accession of additional\r\nones, become splendid palaces. Among these it may be sufficient to\r\nmention Kennelworth, renowned for gorgeous festivities, where the earl\r\nof Leicester was reported to have expended 60,000 pounds in buildings.\r\n\r\nSome curious notices of the habitations of the time are preserved in\r\nLeland's Itinerary, written about 1535, as in the following description\r\nof Wresehill-castle near Howden in Yorkshire:--'Most part of the base\r\ncourt is of timber. The castle is moted about on three parts; the fourth\r\npart is dry, where the entry is into the castle. Five towers, one at\r\neach corner; the gateway is the fifth, having five lodgings in height;\r\nthree of the other towers have four lodgings in height; the fourth\r\ncontaineth the buttery, pantry, pastry, lardery, and kitchen. In one of\r\nthe towers a study called Paradise, where was a closet in the middle of\r\neight squares latticed; about and at the top of every square was a desk\r\nlodged to set books on, &c. The garde robe in the castle was exceeding\r\nfair, and so were the gardens within the mote and the orchards without;\r\nand in the orchards were mounts _opere topiario_ writhen about with\r\ndegrees like turnings of a cockle-shell, to come to top without pain.'\r\n\r\nThese castles, though converted into dwellings of some convenience and\r\nmagnificence, still retained formidable strength, which was proved in\r\nthe following century, when so many of them sustained sieges for the\r\nking or parliament and were finally dilapidated.\r\n\r\nBesides the regularly fortified castles, there were many mansion-houses\r\nof inferior importance, which, though not capable of resisting a regular\r\nsiege, were strengthened against a tumultuous or hasty invasion. These\r\nhouses generally formed a square of building enclosing a court and\r\nsurrounded by a moat. A drawbridge formed the only access, which was\r\nprotected by an embattled gatehouse. One side of the square was\r\nprincipally occupied by a great hall; and the offices and lodgings were\r\ndistributed on the other sides. Oxburgh-hall in Norfolk and Layer Marney\r\nin Essex are fine examples of these houses. They were frequently of\r\ntimber, as Moreton-hall in Cheshire, Speke-hall near Liverpool. Leland\r\ndescribes Morley-house near Manchester as 'builded,--saving the\r\nfoundation of stone squared that riseth within a great mote a 6 foot\r\nabove the water,--all of timber, after the common sort of building of\r\nthe gentlemen for most of Lancashire.' Sometimes a strong tower was\r\nadded at one corner as a citadel, which might be maintained when the\r\nrest of the house was destroyed. This is the case with the curious house\r\nof Stoke Say in Shropshire, where the situation near the Welsh border\r\nmight render such an additional security desirable.\r\n\r\nThus the forms of ancient fortification were continued awhile rather\r\nfrom habit or ostentation than from any more important motives; but in\r\nthe new buildings erected during the reign of Elizabeth and her\r\nsuccessor they were finally laid aside. In some stately houses, though\r\nthe show of strength was discontinued, the general form remained however\r\nthe same. The circuit of building was entire, and enclosed one or more\r\ncourts; a gateway formed the entrance, and the great hall was placed at\r\nthe opposite side of the first court. Such was Audley End, in its\r\noriginal state one of the largest and most sumptuous houses in the\r\nkingdom. In other instances the house assumes the half H shape, with the\r\noffices placed in the wings; and the circuit is only completed by\r\nterraces and low walls; the gatehouse remains as a detached lodge, or is\r\nentirely omitted: examples of this form are numerous; as Holland-house\r\nat Kensington, Oxnead and Blickling halls in Norfolk, Beaudesert and\r\nWimbledon-house, built by sir Thomas Cecil in 1588, remarkable for a\r\ngreat ascent of steps and terraces disposed in a manner resembling some\r\nItalian villas. In others the offices are detached in separate masses,\r\nor concealed, or placed in a basement story; and only the body of the\r\nhouse remains, either as a solid mass or enclosing small courts: this\r\ndisposition does not differ from the most modern arrangements. Of these\r\nhouses Longleat in Wiltshire and Wollaton near Nottingham are fine\r\nexamples[150].\r\n\r\n[Note 150: Views of most of the buildings here mentioned may be\r\nfound in Britton's Architectural Antiquities, vols. i. ii. and iv.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of domestic buildings is well illustrated in the Survey\r\nof Theobald's taken by the Parliament's Commissioners in 1650[151]. This\r\nmansion was built by lord Burleigh about 1560: it afterwards became a\r\nfavourite residence of James I. who received it from lord Salisbury in\r\nexchange for the manor and palace of Hatfield. The Survey contains a\r\nvery minute and accurate description of Theobald's palace, from which\r\nthe following account is given partly in the words of the old\r\nsurveyors.--It consisted of two principal quadrangles besides the dial\r\ncourt, the buttery court and the dove-house court, in which the offices\r\nwere situated. The fountain court was a square of 86 feet, on the east\r\nside of which was a cloister of seven arches. On the ground floor of\r\nthis quadrangle was a spacious hall; the roof of which was arched with\r\ncarved timber of curious workmanship. On the same floor were the lord\r\nHolland's, the marquis of Hamilton's, and lord Salisbury's apartments,\r\nthe council chamber and waiting room. On the second floor was the\r\npresence chamber, finished with carved oak wainscoting and a ceiling\r\nfull of gilded pendants. Also the privy chamber, the withdrawing room,\r\nthe king's bed-chamber, and a gallery 123 feet long, 'wainscoted with\r\noak, and paintings over the same of divers cities, rarely painted and\r\nset forth with a fret ceiling, with divers pendants, roses and\r\nflower-de-luces; also divers large stags heads, which were an excellent\r\nornament to the same.' On the upper floor were the lord chamberlain's\r\nlodgings and several other apartments, with terrace walks on the leads.\r\nAt each corner stood a high and fair tower, and over the hall in the\r\nmiddle 'a large and fair turret in the fashion of a lantern, curiously\r\nwrought with divers pinnacles at each corner, wherein hangeth 12 bells\r\nfor chiming and a clock with chimes and sundry work.' The middle court\r\nwas a quadrangle of 110 feet square, on the south side of which were the\r\nqueen's chapel, presence chamber, and other apartments. The prince's\r\nlodgings were on the north side; on the east side was a cloister, over\r\nwhich was the green gallery, 109 feet by 12 feet, 'excellently well\r\npainted with the several shires in England and the arms of the noblemen\r\nand gentlemen in the same.' Over the gallery was a leaded walk, on which\r\nwere two lofty arches of brick, 'of no small ornament to the house, and\r\nrendering it comely and pleasant to all that passed by.' On the west\r\nside of the quadrangle was another cloister, on five arches, over which\r\nwere the duke's lodgings and over them the queen's gallery. On the south\r\nside of the house stood a large open cloister, built upon several large\r\nfair pillars, arched over 'with a fair rail and ballustres; well painted\r\nwith the kings and queens of England and the pedigree of the old lord\r\nBurleigh and divers other ancient families; with paintings of many\r\ncastles and battles.' The gardens at Theobald's were large, and\r\nornamented with labyrinths, canals and fountains. The great garden\r\ncontained seven acres; besides which there were the pheasant garden,\r\nprivy garden, and laundry garden. In the former were nine knots\r\nartificially and exquisitely made, one of which was set forth in\r\nlikeness of the king's arms. This description, and Bacon's idea of a\r\npalace in his 45th Essay, with their numerous cloisters, galleries and\r\nturrets, are well illustrated by the plan of Audley End, in its original\r\nstate, given in Britton's _Architectural Antiquities_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[Note 151: Lysons's Environs of London, vol. iv.]\r\n\r\nThe houses erected during the sixteenth and the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century were frequently of magnificent dimensions,\r\npicturesque from the varied lines and projections of the plan and\r\nelevation, and rich by the multiplicity of parts; but they had lost all\r\nbeauty of detail. The builders, having abandoned the familiar and long\r\npractised Gothic style, were now to serve their apprenticeship in\r\nGrecian architecture: 'stately Doricke and neat Ionicke work' were\r\nintroduced as fashionable novelties, employed first in the porches and\r\nfrontispieces and gradually extended over the whole fronts of buildings.\r\nAmong the architects employed at this period some foreign names occur.\r\nHolbein was much favoured by Henry VIII., and gave various designs for\r\nbuildings at the old palaces of Whitehall and St. James. John of Padua\r\nhad a salary as deviser of his majesty's buildings, and was employed to\r\nbuild the palace of the protector Somerset. Jerome de Trevisi is also\r\nmentioned; and it is said that the designs for Longleat and a model of\r\nAudley End were obtained from Italy. The last circumstance is altogether\r\nextraordinary; this was the very best period of Italian architecture,\r\nand it seems highly improbable that semi-barbarous designs should\r\nproceed from the country of Palladio and Vignola. Thorpe, Smithson, and\r\nother Englishmen, were also eminent builders; and probably these persons\r\nmight have travelled, and thus have gained the imperfect knowledge of\r\nGrecian architecture which appears in their works. They were immediately\r\nfollowed by Inigo Jones, who formed his style particularly on the works\r\nof Palladio, and became the founder of classic architecture in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable and beautiful analogy between the progress of\r\nGrecian and Gothic architecture, in both of which we find, that while\r\nthe powers of decoration were extended, the process of construction was\r\nimproved and simplified. Thus the Doric, the primitive order, is full of\r\ndifficulties in its arrangement, which render it only applicable to\r\nsimple plans and to buildings where the internal distribution is of\r\ninferior consequence. The Ionic, though more ornamental, is by the\r\nsuppression of the divisions in the frieze so simplified as to be\r\nreadily applicable to more complicated arrangements: still the capital\r\npresents difficulties from the dissimilarity of the front and sides;\r\nwhich objection is finally obviated by the introduction of that rich and\r\nexquisite composition, the Corinthian capital. Thus is obtained an order\r\nof the most elegant and ornamented character, but possessing a happy\r\nsimplicity and regularity of composition which renders it more easy of\r\napplication than any other. In like manner in the later, which has been\r\ncalled the florid style of Gothic architecture, there are buildings\r\nastonishingly rich and elaborate; but we find this excess of ornament\r\nsupported and rendered practicable by a principle of simplicity in\r\ndesign and construction. In the earlier and middle styles of Gothic\r\nthere are various difficulties of execution and some faults of\r\ncomposition: such as the slender detached shafts, the richly carved\r\ncapitals, the flowing and varied tracery of windows, and that profuse\r\nvariety in detail which frequently causes all the windows, capitals,\r\nbuttresses and pinnacles of the same buildings to differ from one\r\nanother. But the later style has more uniformity in corresponding parts;\r\nthe capitals are very generally composed of plain mouldings, and the\r\ndivisions of the windows consist chiefly of horizontal and perpendicular\r\nlines, with few of the beautiful and difficult combinations of curves\r\nwhich are found in the preceding style. The general principle of\r\ndecoration is to leave no plain surface, but to divide the whole into a\r\nseries of pannelling; by which is produced an extraordinary richness of\r\neffect, though the parts, when examined separately, are generally of\r\nsimple forms and such as will admit of an easy and mechanical execution.\r\nThe introduction of the four-centred arch enlarged the powers of design,\r\nenabled architects in many instances to proportion better the vault to\r\nthe upright, and even to introduce vaults where they would have been\r\ninapplicable in the former style, on account of the want of elevation in\r\nrooms; as in the divinity school at Oxford. Without concurring in the\r\nignorant wonder which has raised the vaulted ceilings of this style to\r\nthe rank of mysteries, we may admire the ingenuity which has rendered\r\nreal simplicity of construction the foundation of beautiful forms and of\r\nthe most elaborate decoration. The most celebrated examples of this\r\nstyle are so highly finished, so exuberant in ornament, that the term\r\n_florid_ has been applied as a characteristic epithet for the style; but\r\nthere are many instances of very simple and unornamented buildings of\r\nthe same period agreeing in all the essential principles of construction\r\nand design; and a late writer has with more propriety adopted the term\r\n_perpendicular_ for this mode of architecture. This later Gothic, easy\r\nof construction and possessing a variety of character applicable to\r\nevery kind of building, is well adapted for modern imitation.\r\n\r\nBut the power of mutability was at work, and Gothic architecture was\r\ndoomed to fall. The first step towards its decline was pursuing to\r\nexcess the principle of simplification and retrenching the most\r\nessential ornaments. The large windows of houses were merely divided by\r\nhorizontal and upright bars, and, deprived of tracery and feathering,\r\nwere as void of beauty in the details as in the general proportions;\r\nbuttresses and battlements were generally omitted. A great deterioration\r\ntook place in the decorative part; the ornamental pannels and freizes\r\nof the Gothic style, consisting of geometrical combinations of circles\r\nand straight lines, had always a distinct outline and a sharpness of\r\neffect which contrasted agreeably with the foliage so often intermixed;\r\nbut these were succeeded by strange grotesque combinations, confused,\r\nand void of outline and regularity. The source of ornament was now\r\nsought in the orders and members of Grecian architecture; but the eyes\r\nwhich had been accustomed to the Gothic flutter of parts, were not\r\nprepared to relish the simplicity of line which is essential to the\r\nbeauty of the Greek style. Columns of a small size, inaccurately and\r\ncoarsely executed, with arcades and grotesque caryatids, formed the\r\nornaments of porches and frontispieces,--as at Browseholme-house in\r\nYorkshire, Wimbledon, and the Schools-tower at Oxford,--or were spread\r\nover the whole front and formed the cloisters and galleries in which\r\nthose ancient mansions abounded; as at Holland-house, Longleat,\r\nWollaton, Audley End, Longford-castle, &c. The roofs were either faced\r\nwith notched and curved gables, or screened by parapets of ballustres or\r\nlatticed work and decorated with obelisks and columnar chimney shafts;\r\nwhile turrets and pavilions broke the line of elevation. The windows\r\nwere very large, and frequently bowed: thus Bacon remarks, in the Essay\r\nbefore referred to, that 'you shall have sometimes fair houses so full\r\nof glass that one cannot tell where to become to be out of the sun or\r\ncold.' In wooden houses and particularly town houses, the upper stories\r\ngenerally projected beyond the lower, with windows extremely wide, so as\r\nto occupy almost the whole line of front. The timbers were frequently\r\nleft bare, carved and disposed in forms of pannelling; while the various\r\nprojections were supported by grotesque figures. Very curious houses of\r\nthis character are still found in several old towns, as Chester,\r\nShrewsbury, Coventry, and the obscure parts of London; though natural\r\ndecay, fire and modern improvements, are continually diminishing their\r\nnumber. Among interior decorations, chimney-pieces were very\r\nconspicuous: they were miniature frontispieces, consisting, like the\r\nporches of the houses, of a mass of columns, arches, niches and\r\ncaryatids, piled up to the ceiling. Of these there is one at the old\r\nTabley-hall in Cheshire singularly rude and grotesque, though dated so\r\nlate as 1619, containing a hunting-piece and the figures of Lucrece and\r\nCleopatra. Another in queen Elizabeth's gallery at Windsor Castle is\r\nvery rich, and comparatively pure and elegant in design. The sepulchral\r\nmonuments of this age are very numerous, but only differ from those of\r\nan earlier date in the substitution of the members of Grecian for those\r\nof Gothic architecture, or rather in the confused mixture of both.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this, though a glorious period for literature, was lost\r\nfor the fine arts. The incongruous mixture of the conflicting principles\r\nof Grecian and Gothic architecture produced buildings more truly\r\nbarbarous, more disgusting to a cultivated taste, than the rudest Norman\r\nwork. Together with the architectural orders, our artists had received\r\nmodels and authorities for the grotesque style, which they were but too\r\nready to follow. This extraordinary style of ornament had prevailed in\r\nancient Rome early enough to be reprobated in the work of Vitruvius, and\r\nlay unobserved among obscure and subterraneous ruins till the discovery\r\nof the Baths of Titus opened a rich magazine of gay and capricious\r\nornament. Raffaelle, struck with these remains of the antique art of\r\npainting, adopted the same style of ornament in the galleries of the\r\nVatican, enriching and enlivening it with the stores of allegory and\r\nmythology furnished by his poetical fancy. The example of such a man\r\ncould not want imitators; it influenced the whole architecture of\r\nFrance,--which very early possessed artists of great merit,--and\r\nappeared in this country with very inferior effect. It may well be\r\nimagined that this style, naturally licentious and only rendered\r\ntolerable by grace of composition and brilliancy of execution, would\r\nbecome utterly contemptible when presenting only coarsely executed and\r\nunmeaning extravagances. Such was the general character of art. We may\r\nhowever make discriminations, and admit comparative merit.\r\nWimbledon-house, seated on the side of a hill, was remarkable for a\r\nmagnificent disposition of steps and terraces worthy an Italian villa.\r\nWollaton-hall is admired by Mr. Price for the grandeur of its masses.\r\nCharlton-house has a very picturesque arrangement of heights in the\r\nelevation; Longleat, on the other hand, has much simplicity of form. In\r\nits square projections and three orders of columns, or pilasters, it\r\nbears no remote resemblance to the ancient part of the Louvre built\r\nabout thirty years previously, though without the purity and delicacy of\r\nthe details of the architecture and sculpture which distinguish the\r\nFrench building.\r\n\r\nEDMUND AIKIN.\r\n\r\nLiverpool, February 10, 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlencon, duke of, II 22. 56.\r\n  created duke of Anjou, 71.\r\n  visits the queen, ib.\r\n  His second visit, 98 et seq\r\n  death, 103.\r\n\r\nAnjou, duke of, 451.
