The various particulars of modern locomotive practice have\r\nbeen kindly supplied by the locomotive superintendents of the different\r\nBritish railways, so that no question can arise as to the strict\r\naccuracy of this portion of the work.\r\n\r\nNearly forty years ago it was authoritatively stated: “That kind of\r\nknowledge of the locomotive engine which answers the purpose of a\r\nwell-informed man has already become so popular that it almost amounts\r\nto ignorance to be without it. Locomotive mechanism is very simple in\r\nits elementary nature, and the mind is naturally disposed to receive\r\nand retain any adequate explanation of striking phenomena, whether\r\nmechanical or otherwise; and hence it is that there are thousands\r\nof persons who, although in no way concerned in the construction or\r\nworking of railway engines, are nevertheless competent to give a fair\r\ngeneral explanation of their structure and mode of working.”\r\n\r\nIf such were true at that time it is abundantly evident that it is more\r\nso at the threshold of the 20th century, considering the growth of\r\ninquiry into, and appreciation of, scientific and mechanical knowledge\r\nby an ever widening and increasing circle of general readers, which\r\nhas been one of the marked signs of intellectual development during\r\nrecent years. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that\r\nthe locomotive and its history have received a large share of public\r\nattention. Whilst railway officers, with the intelligence for which\r\nthey are justly distinguished, have always evinced a proper desire\r\nto be acquainted with the evolution of the “steam horse,” the spread\r\nof education has increased and quickened a desire for knowledge\r\nconcerning the locomotive amongst all classes in a remarkable manner.\r\nMany of the numerous illustrations that embellish the book have been\r\nspecially collected for the purpose, and several will be quite new to\r\nthe majority of readers. Special pains have been taken to admit only\r\nsuch illustrations the authenticity of which was known to the author,\r\nand for the same reason many otherwise interesting pictures, upon the\r\naccuracy of which suspicion rested, were excluded from the collection.\r\n\r\nDespite these exclusions, we believe that no other book on locomotive\r\nhistory in the English language is so fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nAs it is proposed to deal with the railway locomotive only, it is not\r\nnecessary to make more than a passing reference to the more or less\r\ncrude proposals of Sir Isaac Newton, the Marquess of Worcester, Savery,\r\nDr. Robinson, Leupold, and other writers and scientists, who hinted at\r\nthe possibility of steam locomotion. Nor does the writer propose to\r\ndiscuss the alleged use of railways and steam locomotives in Germany at\r\na date prior to their general introduction into England. The claims of\r\nCugnot, Symington, Evans, Murdoch, and others as builders or designers\r\nof actual or model steam road locomotives will also be passed without\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity of expressing our sincere thanks to the\r\nlocomotive superintendents of British railways, who have all been so\r\nwilling to assist the author, not only in supplying accurate data\r\nconcerning the locomotives of their own design, but also for so kindly\r\nrevising the portions of the volume that relate to the locomotive\r\nhistory of the particular railway with which each one of these\r\ngentlemen is connected.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we leave the “Evolution of the Steam Locomotive” to the\r\nkindly consideration of our readers, hoping that from a perusal of it\r\nthey may derive both information and pleasure.\r\n\r\n                                                      G.

As long ago as 1796 he constructed a model\r\nlocomotive which ran round a room; and on Christmas Eve, 1801, he made\r\nthe initial trip with his first steam locomotive through the streets\r\nof Camborne. This machine carried several passengers at a speed in\r\nexcess of the usual walking pace of a man. Trevithick was joined in\r\nthe enterprise by his cousin Vivian, who provided the money to build\r\nthe steam engines, and to patent them, their first patent being dated\r\n24th March, 1802. It is described as “for improving the construction\r\nof steam engines, and the application thereof for drawing carriages\r\non rails and turnpike roads and other purposes.” It was claimed that\r\ntheir engine would produce “a more equable rotary motion on the\r\nseveral parts of the revolution of any axis which is moved by the steam\r\nengine, by causing the piston-rods of two cylinders to work on the said\r\naxis by means of cranks, at a quarter turn asunder.”\r\n\r\nAmong other improvements claimed in the specification, mention should\r\nbe made of the return tube boiler, bellows to urge the fire, and a\r\nsecond safety valve, not under the control of the driver.\r\n\r\nA steam carriage with these improvements was constructed, and Vivian\r\nand Trevithick commenced a journey on it from Camborne to Plymouth,\r\nfrom which port it was shipped to London. On the road to Plymouth\r\na closed toll-bar was met, and the steam carriage stopped for the\r\ngate to be opened. “What have us got to pay here?” demanded Vivian.\r\nThe affrighted toll-keeper, shaking in every limb, and his teeth\r\nchattering, essayed to answer, and at last said, “Na—na—na—na.” “What\r\nhave us got to pay, I say?” demanded Vivian. “Na—noth—nothing to pay,\r\nmy de—dear Mr. Devil; do drive on as fast as you can. Nothing to pay.”\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that to Cornishmen of a century ago the devil was\r\na very real personage; and, seeing the horseless carriage proceeding\r\nwith a fiery accompaniment, the poor toll-keeper thought he had at last\r\nseen his Satanic majesty. He also appears to have remembered that it is\r\nwell “to be civil to everyone, the devil included; there is no knowing\r\nwhen you may require his good wishes.” Hence the toll-keeper’s reason\r\nfor calling Vivian “my dear Mr. Devil.”\r\n\r\nAs early as August, 1802, R. Trevithick (according to his life, as\r\nwritten by his son, F. Trevithick) appears to have constructed a\r\nrailway locomotive at Coalbrookdale. This engine had a boiler of\r\ncast-iron 1½in. thick, with an interior return wrought-iron tube. The\r\nlength of the boiler was 6ft., and the diameter 4ft. The cylinder\r\nworking this engine was 7in. in diameter, the stroke being 3ft. The\r\nnext railway locomotive was that constructed for the Pen-y-darren\r\nTramroad near Myrthyr Tydvil. Of this particular locomotive (Fig. 1)\r\nit is possible to obtain authentic particulars, although much that\r\nis legendary already clusters around this historic locomotive. For\r\ninstance, we read that the locomotive in question had a brick chimney,\r\nand that it was demolished by colliding with an overhanging branch\r\nof a tree. Then the amount of the bet between Mr. Homfray, the owner\r\nof the tramroad, and his friend, as to whether the locomotive would\r\nsuccessfully perform a journey from Pen-y-darren to the navigation at\r\nPlymouth, is a variable quantity. The amount staked has been stated to\r\nbe £500 a side, and also £1,000 a side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—THE FIRST RAILWAY LOCOMOTIVE OF WHICH AUTHENTIC\r\nPARTICULARS ARE KNOWN]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that some days prior to February 10th, 1804, the engine\r\nsuccessfully performed the journey, and that overhanging trees and\r\nrocks considerably impeded the travelling, several stoppages having to\r\nbe made whilst these obstacles were removed. Mr. Homfray, however, won\r\nthe bet. On February 21st another trip was made by the locomotive. On\r\nthis occasion the load consisted of 5 wagons, 10 tons of bar iron, and\r\n70 passengers, the weight of the engine, with water and fuel, being 5\r\ntons; the journey of nine miles being performed in 4 hours 5 minutes,\r\nincluding several stoppages; the average speed when travelling being\r\nfive miles an hour. On the return journey the engine hauled the empty\r\nwagons up an incline of 1 in 18 at the rate of five miles an hour.\r\nSeveral of the tram-plates, which weighed only 28lb. per yard, were\r\nbroken on the downward trip. Early in March the engine conveyed a load\r\nof 25 tons from the iron works to the navigation.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this engine from the first decided the\r\npracticability of conveying loads by means of smooth wheels on\r\nsmooth rails, simply by adhesion. Yet, strange to say, for several\r\nyears after, it was the firmly-fixed belief of succeeding locomotive\r\nconstructors that it was impossible to obtain sufficient adhesion\r\nbetween a smooth surface and a smooth rail to successfully work a\r\nlocomotive. The result was the invention of many curious methods to\r\novercome this apparent difficulty, which, as a fact, never existed,\r\nsave in the minds of the designers of the early locomotives. These\r\nmen do not seem to have been fully acquainted with the results of\r\nTrevithick’s experiments on the Pen-y-darren tramroad in 1804.\r\n\r\nA description of this locomotive prototype is of interest. The boiler\r\nwas cylindrical, with a flat end. The fire-door and chimney were both\r\nat the same end, an extended heating surface being obtained by means\r\nof the return tube; above the fire-door was the single horizontal\r\ncylinder, the diameter of which was 8¼in.; a considerable portion of\r\nthe cylinder was immersed in the boiler, the exposed portion being\r\nsurrounded by a steam jacket. The stroke was 4ft. 6in.! The piston-rod\r\nworked on a motion frame extending in front of the engine. At the other\r\nend of the boiler was a fly-wheel some 9ft. 6in. in diameter, the\r\nmotion being conveyed to it by connecting-rods from the cross-head;\r\na cog-wheel on the fly-wheel axle conveyed the motion by means of an\r\nintermediate wheel to the four driving wheels, which are stated to have\r\nbeen 4ft. 6in. in diameter. The exhaust steam appears to have been\r\nturned into the chimney, not for the purpose of a blast, but only as an\r\neasy method of getting rid of the vapour. It will be remembered that\r\nTrevithick, in his patent specification, specially mentioned bellows\r\nfor urging the fire, and was, therefore, not acquainted with the nature\r\nof the exhaust steam blast. It is important to bear this in mind, as\r\nthe reader will find in a later chapter. This engine is stated to\r\nhave blown up through not being provided with a safety valve, though\r\nTrevithick specially ordered one to be fixed to the boiler, but his\r\ninstructions do not appear to have been carried out.\r\n\r\nTrevithick made another locomotive, called “Catch-me-who-can.” This\r\nran on an ellipse-shaped railway specially laid down for it at Euston\r\nSquare, London, and was visited by many people during the few days\r\nit was on view. Another locomotive was constructed from the drawings\r\nof Trevithick’s Coalbrookdale locomotive of 1802, to the orders of\r\nMr. Blackett, the owner of Wylam Collieries. This engine weighing\r\n4½ tons, had a single cylinder 7in. diameter, 3ft. stroke, and, of\r\ncourse, a fly-wheel. For some reason or another this engine does not\r\nappear to have been used on the Wylam tramroad, but was used in a\r\nNewcastle foundry to blow a cupola. Mr. Armstrong, a former Locomotive\r\nSuperintendent of the Great Western Railway, was acquainted with this\r\nengine of Trevithick’s at the time it was so employed at Newcastle.\r\n\r\nHaving given an outline of Trevithick’s invention of the tramroad\r\nlocomotive, and the other locomotive engines designed by him, we will\r\ndeal with the locomotive built for J. Blenkinsopp (Fig. 2), of the\r\nMiddleton Colliery, near Leeds, who, on April 10th, 1811, obtained\r\na patent for a self-propelling steam engine, worked by means of a\r\ncog-wheel, engaging in a rack laid side by side with one of the rails\r\nforming the tramway.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous idea that the locomotive of itself had not sufficient\r\nadhesion between the smooth wheel and the surface of the rail to propel\r\nitself and draw a load was strongly entertained by Blenkinsopp, hence\r\nhis patent rack and pinion system. Blenkinsopp having this opinion,\r\nwhich he published by means of his patent specification, caused\r\nsucceeding inventors to fall into the same error regarding the adhesive\r\nproperties of the locomotive, and consequently considerably retarded\r\nthe development of the railway engine.\r\n\r\nAlthough this engine is generally known as Blenkinsopp’s, it was\r\nconstructed by Matthew Murray, the Leeds engineer. The boiler was\r\ncylindrical, with slightly convex ends, a single flue ran through\r\nit, which was in front turned upwards, and so formed the chimney;\r\nthe fire-grate was at the other end of the flue, as in the modern\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nThis engine was provided with two cylinders, and was, in this respect,\r\nan improvement on Trevithick’s single cylinder engines. The cylinders\r\nwere 8in. in diameter, and placed vertically, the major portion of\r\nthem being placed within the boiler. The stroke was 20in., and the\r\nmotion was conveyed by means of cross-heads, working connecting-rods;\r\nthese came down to two cranks on either side below the boiler. The\r\ncranks worked two shafts fixed across the frames, on which were toothed\r\nwheels, both working into a centre toothed wheel, which was provided\r\nwith large teeth, these engaged on the rack rail previously described.\r\nThe cranks were set at right angles, so that one piston was exerting\r\npower when the other was at its dead centre, and _vice versâ_. The\r\nengine was supported on the rails by four wheels 3ft. 6in. in diameter.\r\nThe two cylinders were connected by a pipe which conveyed the exhaust\r\nsteam and discharged it into the atmosphere through a vertical\r\ntube. The engine weighed 5 tons, burned 75lb. of coal per hour, and\r\nevaporated 50 gallons of water in the same time. This locomotive could\r\nhaul 94 tons on the level at 3½ miles an hour, or 15 tons up an incline\r\nof 1 in 15; its maximum speed was 10 miles an hour. The engine cost\r\n£400 to construct, and worked from August, 1812, for a period of about\r\n20 years, and in 1816 the Grand Duke Nicholas, afterwards Emperor of\r\nRussia, inspected the machine. The tramway on which it worked was about\r\n3¾ miles long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—LOCOMOTIVE BUILT BY MURRAY FOR BLENKINSOPP’S\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1813, Murray supplied two of Blenkinsopp’s engines to the\r\nKenton Colliery.\r\n\r\nOn December 30th, 1812, a patent was granted to William and Edward\r\nChapman for a method of locomotion. A chain was stretched along the\r\nrailway and fastened at each end; connected to the locomotive by\r\nspur gear was a barrel, around which the chain was passed. When the\r\nbarrel rotated, the chain was wound over it, and since the chain was\r\nsecured at either end, the engine was of necessity propelled. An engine\r\non this principle was tried on the Heaton Colliery Tramroad, near\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. The machine was supported on wheels travelling on\r\nthe rails. The boiler was of Trevithick’s design, and fanners were used\r\nto excite the combustion of the fuel. The weight of Chapman’s engine\r\nwas 6 tons. After a few trials the scheme was abandoned, as it was\r\nfound impracticable to successfully work such a system. Every eight or\r\nten yards the chain was secured by means of vertical forks, which hold\r\nit when disengaged from the drum of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nBy this method the pressure of one engine on the chain was limited to\r\nthe fork on either side of the drum instead of being spread over the\r\nwhole length of the chain, and it would, therefore, have been possible\r\nfor several engines to have used the chain at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nAccording to Luke Herbert and Lieut. Lecount, Chapman also built an\r\n8-wheel locomotive for the Lambton Colliery. This engine, it was\r\nstated, had vertical cylinders, and the motion was conveyed by means of\r\nspur wheels. It weighed 6 tons loaded, and drew 18 loaded wagons, of a\r\ngross weight of 54 tons, from the colliery to the shipping place on the\r\nWear; with the above load it attained a speed of four miles an hour up\r\nan incline of 1 in 115. The dimensions and capabilities accredited to\r\nthis engine appear suspiciously similar to those related of the first\r\nWylam locomotive.\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd, 1813, Mr. W. Brunton, of the Butterfly Ironworks, obtained\r\na patent for a novel method of steam locomotion. This locomotive\r\ninventor was also suffering from the common belief that it was\r\nimpossible to obtain sufficient adhesion between a smooth rail and\r\nsmooth wheels, despite the successes that had already been obtained in\r\nthis direction by Trevithick. He therefore built an engine supported\r\non four flanged carrying wheels, but propelled from behind by means of\r\ntwo legs. Indeed, another inventor considered the idea of steam legs so\r\nnatural that he constructed a steam road-coach that was to be propelled\r\nby four legs, one pair partaking of the character and motion of the\r\nforelegs of a horse, and the other pair being fashioned on the model of\r\nthe hind legs of the same quadruped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—BRUNTON’S “MECHANICAL TRAVELLER” LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nIn Brunton’s leg-propelled steam locomotive (Fig. 3) we find that the\r\nboiler was cylindrical, with a single horizontal tube passing through\r\nit, and turned up in front in a vertical position, thus forming the\r\nchimney. The motion was obtained from a single horizontal cylinder,\r\nfixed near the top of the boiler, the piston-rod projecting behind;\r\nthe end of the piston-rod was attached to a jointed rod, the bottom\r\nportion of which formed one of the legs. The upper portion of this\r\nrod was attached to a framework fixed above the boiler of the engine,\r\nwhich formed a fulcrum, and then by an ingenious arrangement of levers,\r\nan alternate motion was given to the second leg. Each leg had a foot\r\nformed of two prongs at the bottom; these stuck in the ground, and\r\nprevented the legs from slipping. Upon steam being applied, the piston\r\nin the ordinary way would have travelled to the end of the cylinder,\r\nbut the leg, having a firm hold of the ground, presented a greater\r\nresistance to the steam than did the weight of the engine, so the steam\r\nacting on the surface that presented the lesser resistance, caused the\r\ncylinder to recede, and with it the engine, to which it was, of course,\r\nfirmly attached. By means of the reciprocating levers, a horizontal\r\nrod travelled on the top of the boiler and over a cog-wheel; then on\r\nthe other side of this cog-wheel was another horizontal rod, which,\r\nactuated by the cog-wheel, travelled in a contrary direction, and\r\nbeing attached to the other leg of the engine, as the machine receded\r\nfrom the first leg, it drew the second leg close up to the back of the\r\nengine. The second leg was now ready to propel the engine, which it did\r\nupon the steam being applied to the other side of the piston, and the\r\nprocess was alternated with each admission of steam to the front or\r\nback of the piston.\r\n\r\nWhilst the legs were returning towards the engine the feet were raised\r\nby means of straps or ropes fastened to the legs and passing over\r\nfriction-wheels, movable in one direction only by a ratchet and catch,\r\nand worked by the motion of the engine.\r\n\r\nBrunton called his locomotive a “mechanical traveller,” and stated\r\nthat the boiler was of wrought-iron, 5ft. 6in. long and 3ft. diameter,\r\nweighing 2¼ tons, stroke of piston, 2ft., and at 2½ miles per hour,\r\nwith a steam pressure of 451b. per square inch, was equal in power to\r\nnearly six horses. This locomotive curiosity blew up at Newbottle in\r\n1816, and about a dozen people were thereby either killed or seriously\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who is entitled to the honour of constructing the Wylam\r\n        locomotives?—The claims of Hackworth, Hedley and\r\n        Foster—“Puffing Billy”—Rebuilt as an eight-wheel\r\n        engine—Stewart’s locomotive—Sharp practice causes\r\n        Stewart to abandon locomotive building—George\r\n        Stephenson as a locomotive builder—His hazy views as to\r\n        his first engine—“Blucher”—The German General proves\r\n        a failure—Stephenson and Dodd’s engine—Stephenson’s\r\n        third engine, with (so-called) steam springs—Competent\r\n        critics condemn Stephenson’s engines—The “Royal\r\n        William”—The “Locomotion”—Hackworth, General Manager\r\n        of the Stockton and Darlington Railway—Horse haulage\r\n        cheaper than Stephenson’s locomotives—Hackworth to\r\n        the rescue—The “Royal George,” the first successful\r\n        locomotive—The “exhaust” steam blast—Rival claimants\r\n        and its invention—Locomotive versus stationary engine\r\n        —“Twin Sisters”—“Lancashire Witch”—“Agenoria”—The\r\n        “Maniac”, a Forth Street production.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at a point in the evolution of the steam locomotive\r\nwhere the claims of several men are in competition. The facts as to the\r\nexperiments and construction of the engines at Wylam are not disputed.\r\nThe question at issue is as to whom the honour of the success should\r\nbe given. Christopher Blackett, of the Wylam Colliery, as previously\r\nstated, ordered a locomotive of Trevithick, but never used it. He,\r\nhowever, determined to make a trial of steam haulage on his plate way,\r\nand in 1811 some kind of experiments were made, having in view the\r\nabove-mentioned object. At this time Timothy Hackworth was foreman of\r\nthe smiths (he would now be called an engineer), and William Hedley\r\nwas coal-viewer at Wylam. The friends of both Hackworth and Hedley\r\nclaim for their respective heroes the honour of these early essays\r\nin locomotive construction. But it is probable the honours should be\r\nshared by both, as well as by Jonathan Foster, who also assisted in the\r\nexperiments and construction of the Wylam locomotives.\r\n\r\nHedley was colliery-viewer at Wylam, and therefore, most likely,\r\nHackworth was, to an extent, under his orders, and probably had to\r\ndefer to, and act under, the instructions of Hedley.\r\n\r\nBut Hackworth’s position as foreman-smith did not preclude him from\r\nmaking suggestions and introducing improvements of his own into the\r\nlocomotives under construction.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that Hedley was jealous because Hackworth obtained the\r\npraise for building the Wylam locomotives (or “Timothy’s Dillies,”\r\nas they were locally called), and to force Hackworth to leave Wylam,\r\nHedley required him to do some repairs to the machinery on Sundays.\r\nNow, Timothy was a fervent Wesleyan, and spent his Sundays in local\r\npreaching, so he naturally refused to violate his conscience by working\r\non that day. Consequently Hackworth sought employment elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—HACKWORTH’S “WYLAM DILLY,” GENERALLY KNOWN AS\r\nHEDLEY’S “PUFFING BILLY”]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was a sore point with Hackworth that George\r\nStephenson spent his Sundays at Wylam taking sketches and particulars\r\nof the locomotives at that time at work on the Wylam Railway, the\r\nresult of which observations was apparent in the locomotive built by\r\nStephenson at Killingworth in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe Wylam experimentalists in October, 1812, constructed a four-wheel\r\nvehicle driven by manual power working cranks connected with spur\r\nwheels. The carriage was loaded until sufficient weight had been placed\r\nupon it to cause the wheels to turn round without progressing.\r\n\r\nThe experiment, however, satisfied Mr. Blackett that locomotive engines\r\nwith smooth wheels could be employed in drawing loads on his tramroad;\r\nand the construction of an engine was immediately proceeded with. This\r\nwas completed and put to work early in 1813. It had a cast-iron boiler,\r\nand a single internal flue; the solitary cylinder was 6in. in diameter,\r\nand a fly-wheel was employed after the model of Trevithick’s engine.\r\nThe steam pressure was 50lb. This four-wheel engine drew six coal\r\ntrucks at five miles an hour, and, therefore, did the work of three\r\nhorses—not a very powerful example of a steam locomotive, it will be\r\nobserved. This engine being somewhat of a failure, it was decided to\r\nbuild another, and one with a wrought-iron boiler and a return tube was\r\nconstructed. In his engine (Fig. 4) it will be noticed the fire-box and\r\nchimney were both at the same end of the boiler. Two vertical cylinders\r\nwere fixed over the trailing wheels of “Puffing Billy” (for it is this\r\nhistorical locomotive, now preserved in the South Kensington Museum,\r\nthat is now being described). The piston-rods were connected to beams\r\nof the “Grasshopper” pattern, being both centred at the funnel end\r\nof the engine. The driving-rods were connected with these beams at\r\nabout their centres, and passed down to spur wheels, which, by means\r\nof toothed wheels on either side, communicated the motion to the four\r\ncarrying wheels. The spent steam was conveyed from the cylinders to\r\nthe chimney by means of two horizontal pipes laid along the top of the\r\nboiler. It was soon discovered that the cast-iron tram-plates, which\r\nwere only of four square inch section, were unable to bear the weight\r\nof “Puffing Billy,” and another change was decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe engine was therefore placed on two four-wheel trucks (Fig. 5), so\r\nthat the weight was distributed on eight instead of four wheels, the\r\nsame method of spur gearing was employed, and the whole of the wheels\r\nwere actuated by means of intermediate cog-wheels. To prevent, as\r\nfar as possible, the noise caused by the escaping steam, a vertical\r\ncylinder was fixed on the top of the boiler between the cylinders and\r\nthe funnel. Into this chamber the spent steam was discharged, and\r\nfrom it the same was allowed to escape gradually into the chimney.\r\nIn addition to the improvement of a return tube, with its extended\r\nheating surface, with which this class of engine was provided, the\r\nfunnel was only 12in. in diameter, as compared with 22in. diameter as\r\nused by Stephenson in his early engines. As already stated, the Wylam\r\nlocomotives were locally called “Timothy’s Dillies,” after Timothy\r\nHackworth, to whose inventive genius they were popularly ascribed.\r\nIn 1830, the cast-iron plates on the road from Wylam to Leamington\r\nwere removed, and the course was relaid with edge rails, so that the\r\nnecessity for eight-wheel engines was at an end. “Timothy’s Dillies”\r\nwere then reconverted to four-wheel locomotives, and continued at work\r\non the line till about 1862.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—HACKWORTH’S OR HEDLEY’S SECOND DESIGN, AS USED\r\nON THE WYLAM RAILWAY IN 1815]\r\n\r\nNot many locomotive writers are acquainted with the fact that in 1814\r\nWilliam Stewart, of Newport, Mon., constructed a locomotive for the\r\nPark End Colliery Company, which was tried on the Lydney Railway, and\r\nfound to work in a satisfactory manner. The Park End Colliery Company\r\nwere paying about £3,000 a year to contractors for horse haulage of\r\ntheir coal to the Forest of Dean Canal, and Stewart undertook to do the\r\nsame by locomotive power for half that sum. The Company accepted his\r\nterms, and he set about the construction of his engine. Whilst this\r\nwas progressing the contractors who provided the horses were told at\r\neach monthly settlement that the Company were going to use a locomotive\r\nto haul the coal, as horse-power was too expensive. By means of these\r\nthreats the contractors were induced each month to accept a less price\r\nthan previously for “leading” the coal over the tramroad. Upon the\r\nspecified date Stewart’s locomotive was duly delivered on the line, and\r\naccepted by the Park End Colliery Company for doing the work required;\r\nbut the engineer was informed that the horse-power contractors were\r\nthen only receiving £2,000 a year for the work, and that as Stewart\r\nhad agreed to provide locomotive power at one-half of the sum paid for\r\nhorses, he would only receive £1,000 a year.\r\n\r\nStewart was so highly indignant at this piece of sharp practice that\r\nhe refused to have anything further to do with the Park End Colliery\r\nCompany, and at once removed his locomotive off their tramroad, and\r\ntook it back to Newport.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempts of George Stephenson in connection with the\r\nevolution of the steam locomotive now deserve attention. Stephenson\r\nhimself is not very clear about his first engine, for, speaking at\r\nNewcastle at the opening of the Newcastle and Darlington Railway in\r\n1844, he said that thirty-two years ago he constructed his first\r\nengine. “We called the engine ‘My Lord,’ after Lord Ravensworth, who\r\nprovided the money for its construction.” Both these statements are\r\nerroneous, for Stephenson did not build his first engine till 1814,\r\nand thirty-two years before 1844 would have been 1812. Then the engine\r\ncould not have been called “My Lord,” after Lord Ravensworth, for the\r\ntitle did not exist in 1814, the gentleman alluded to being only Sir\r\nThomas Liddell till the coronation of King George IV. in 1821, when he\r\nwas created Lord Ravensworth.\r\n\r\nThe “Blucher,” as this engine was in fact usually called, was first\r\ntried on the Killingworth Railway on July 25th, 1814; she had a\r\nwrought-iron boiler, 8ft. long and 2ft. 10in. diameter, with a single\r\nflue 20in. diameter, turned up in front to form a chimney. The power\r\nwas applied by means of two vertical cylinders located partly within\r\nthe boiler, and projecting from its top, close together, and near the\r\nmiddle. The cylinders were 8in. diameter, the stroke 2ft. The motion\r\nwas conveyed to the wheels by means of cross-heads and connecting-rods\r\nworking on small spur wheels (Fig. 6), which engaged the four carrying\r\nwheels by means of cogged wheels fitted on the axles of the flanged\r\nrail-wheels; these were only 3ft. in diameter, and were 3ft. apart.\r\nThe spur wheels engaged another cogged wheel, placed between them, for\r\nthe purpose of keeping the cranks at right angles. No springs were\r\nprovided for the engine, which was mounted on a wooden frame, but the\r\nwater barrel was fixed to one end of a lever, and also weighted; the\r\nother end of this lever was fixed to the frame of the engine. This\r\narrangement did duty for springs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—STEPHENSON’S INITIAL DRIVING GEAR FOR\r\nLOCOMOTIVES]\r\n\r\nThe best work done by “Blucher” was the hauling of loaded coal-wagons,\r\nweighing 30 tons, up an incline of 1 in 450, at about four miles an\r\nhour. This first effort of Stephenson had no original points about\r\nit; the method of working was copied from the Wylam engines, whilst\r\nTrevithick’s practice was followed with regard to the position of the\r\ncylinders—_i.e._, their location, partly within the boiler. The average\r\nspeed did not exceed three miles an hour, and after twelve months’\r\nworking the machine was found to be more expensive than the horses it\r\nwas designed to replace at a less cost. The absence of springs was\r\nspecially manifested, for by this time the engine was so much shaken\r\nand injured by the vibration that the Killingworth Colliery owners were\r\ncalled upon a second time to find the money to enable Stephenson to\r\nconstruct another locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe second engine (Fig. 7) constructed by George Stephenson was built\r\nunder the patent granted to Dodd and Stephenson on 28th February,\r\n1815. In this engine vertical cylinders, partly encased in the boiler,\r\nwere again employed; but their position was altered, one being placed\r\nat each extremity of the boiler over the wheels, the intermediate\r\nspur wheels formerly used for keeping the cranks at right angles\r\nwere abandoned, and the axles were cranked. A connecting-rod was\r\nfitted on these cranks, thus coupling the two axles. To give greater\r\nadhesion, the wheels of the tender were connected with those of the\r\nengine by means of an endless chain passing over cogs on the one pair\r\nof engine wheels, and over the adjoining pair of tender wheels; by\r\nthese methods six pairs of wheels were coupled. The mechanics engaged\r\nwere not, however, capable of forging proper crank axles, and these\r\nhad to be abandoned, and an endless chain coupling employed for the\r\nengine wheels, similar to the one connecting the tender and engine, as\r\npreviously described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—STEPHENSON AND DODD’S PATENT ENGINE, BUILT IN\r\n1815]\r\n\r\nThis engine had no springs, and, to avoid excessive friction arising\r\nfrom the bad state of the tramroad, Stephenson employed “ball\r\nand socket” joints between the ends of the cross-heads and the\r\nconnecting-rods. In this way the necessary parallelism between the ends\r\nof the cross-heads and the axles was maintained. The spent steam in the\r\nengine was turned into the chimney, as in Trevithick’s Pen-y-darren\r\nlocomotive. This locomotive commenced to work on 6th March, 1815.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson constructed a third engine (Fig. 8), under a patent\r\ngranted to Lock and Stephenson on 30th September, 1816; this patent\r\ncovered several matters, the most important in connection with the\r\nengine being malleable iron wheels, instead of cast-iron, and what has\r\nbeen described as “steam springs.” The patentees called them “floating\r\npistons”; of this description Colburn says emphatically “they are not,”\r\nand the same authority continues, “and they (Lock and Stephenson)\r\nadded, evidently without understanding the true action of the pistons,\r\nwhich were different in principle from the action of springs, that\r\ninasmuch as they acted upon an elastic fluid, they produced the desired\r\neffect, with much more accuracy than could be obtained by employing the\r\nfinest springs of steel to suspend the engine. The whole arrangement\r\nwas, on the contrary, defective in principle and objectionable on\r\nthe score of leakage, wear, etc.; and, as a matter of course, was\r\nultimately abandoned.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—STEPHENSON’S IMPROVED ENGINE, AS ALTERED, FITTED\r\nWITH STEEL SPRINGS (INVENTED BY NICHOLAS WOOD)]\r\n\r\nIn the drawings attached to the patent specification this engine is\r\nshown with six wheels, and the chain coupling is employed. Lecount\r\nsays: “The six wheels were continued in use as long as the steam\r\nsprings were applied, and when steel springs were adopted they were\r\nagain reduced to four.” So much praise has been given to Stephenson\r\nfor the “great improvements” he is supposed to have introduced into\r\nthe construction of the locomotive, that it will not be uninteresting\r\nif we here reproduce the extremely pertinent remarks of Galloway, the\r\nwell-known authority on the steam engine, which go far to prove that\r\nit was only the great success obtained by George Stephenson from the\r\nconstruction of the Liverpool and Manchester and other railways, that\r\ncaused historians and biographers to either magnify his locomotive\r\nsuccesses, or to gloss over the evident faults in the design and\r\nconstruction of his engines. In his “History of the Steam Engine,”\r\npublished in 1827, Galloway says: These locomotive engines have been\r\nlong in use at Killingworth Colliery, near Newcastle, and at Hilton\r\nColliery on the Wear, so that their advantages and defects have been\r\nsufficiently submitted to the test of experiment; and it appears that,\r\nnotwithstanding the great exertions on the part of the inventor, Mr.\r\nStephenson, to bring them into use on the different railroads, now\r\neither constructing or in agitation, it has been the opinion of several\r\nable engineers that they do not possess those advantages which the\r\ninventor had anticipated; indeed, there cannot be a better proof of\r\nthe doubt entertained regarding their utility than the fact that it\r\nhas been determined that no locomotive engine shall be used on the\r\nprojected railroad between Newcastle and Carlisle, since, had their\r\nadvantages been very apparent, the persons living immediately on the\r\nspot in which they are used, namely, Newcastle, would be acquainted\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n“The principal objections seem to be the difficulty of surmounting\r\neven the slightest ascent, for it has been found that a rise of only\r\none-eighth of an inch in a yard, or of eighteen feet in a mile, retards\r\nthe speed of one of these engines in a very great degree; so much so,\r\nindeed, that it has been considered necessary, in some parts where\r\nused, to aid their ascent with their load, by fixed engines, which\r\ndrag them forward by means of ropes coiling round a drum. The spring\r\nsteam cylinders below the boiler were found very defective, for in the\r\nascending stroke of the working piston they were forced inwards by the\r\nconnecting-rod pulling at the wheel and turning it round, and in the\r\ndescending stroke the same pistons were forced as much outwards. This\r\nmotion or play rendered it necessary to increase the length of the\r\nworking cylinder as much as there was play in the lower ones, to avoid\r\nthe danger of breaking or seriously injuring the top and bottom of the\r\nformer by the striking of the piston when it was forced too much up or\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nStephenson must have felt himself to be a personage of some importance\r\nwhen he received an order from the Duke of Portland for a steam\r\nlocomotive. The engine, which had six wheels, was duly built and\r\ndelivered in 1817, when it was put to work on the tramroad connecting\r\nthe Duke’s Kilmarnock Collieries with the harbour at Troon; but,\r\nafter a short trial, its use was abandoned, as the weight of the\r\nengine frequently broke the cast-iron tram-plates. It has been stated\r\nthat “this engine afterwards worked on the Gloucester and Cheltenham\r\nTramroad until 1839, when the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway bought\r\nthe line, and took up the cast-iron tram-plates.”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a six-wheel engine with vertical cylinders\r\npartly encased in the top of the boiler, and called the “Royal\r\nWilliam,” was actually at work on this line—the fact having been\r\ncommemorated by the striking of a bronze medal; but there is nothing to\r\nshow that the “Royal William” and the engine built for the Kilmarnock\r\nand Troon Tramroad were one and the same locomotive; whilst it is\r\ncertain that the Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroad was not purchased\r\nby the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, but jointly by the Cheltenham\r\nand Great Western Union Railway and the Birmingham and Gloucester\r\nRailway, the price paid being £35,000.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from a letter written by George Stephenson, and dated\r\nKillingworth Colliery, 28th June, 1821, that he had but little idea\r\nto what a great degree the development of the steam locomotive would\r\nbe carried. The letter, which was addressed to Robert Stevenson, the\r\ncelebrated Edinburgh engineer, proceeded as follows: “I have lately\r\nstarted a new locomotive engine with some improvements on the others\r\nwhich you saw. It has far surpassed my expectations. I am confident\r\nthat a railway on which my engine can work is far superior to a canal.\r\nOn a long and favourable railway I would start my engine to travel 60\r\nmiles a day, with from 40 to 60 tons of goods.” Taking Stephenson’s\r\n“day” to mean twelve working hours, his idea of maximum speed did\r\nnot exceed five miles an hour at that time. Before this—in December,\r\n1824—Charles MacLaren had published in the _Scotsman_ his opinion that\r\nby the use of the steam locomotive “we shall be carried at the rate of\r\n400 miles a day,” or an average speed of 33⅓ miles an hour.\r\n\r\nYet such is the irony of fate, that MacLaren, the true prophet, is\r\nforgotten, and George Stephenson is everywhere extolled.\r\n\r\nThe Hetton (Coal) Railway was opened on November 18th, 1822, and five\r\nof Stephenson’s “improved Killingworth” locomotives were placed upon\r\nthe level portions. These engines were capable of hauling a train of\r\nabout 64 tons, the maximum speed being four miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—“LOCOMOTION,” THE FIRST ENGINE TO RUN ON A\r\nPUBLIC RAILWAY (THE STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY)]\r\n\r\nThe Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway, was\r\nopened on September 27th, 1825. The “Locomotion” (Fig. 9) was the first\r\nengine on the line. It was constructed at the Forth Street Works of R.\r\nStephenson and Co., at Newcastle-on-Tyne. At this early period these\r\nnow celebrated Forth Street Works were little better than a collection\r\nof smiths’ forges.\r\n\r\nTimothy Hackworth had been manager of these works, and he had a good\r\ndeal to do with the construction of “Locomotion.” His improvement of\r\nthe coupling-rods in place of the endless chain previously used for the\r\npurpose by Stephenson is worthy of passing notice. George Stephenson\r\nexpressed a very strong desire that Hackworth should remain in charge\r\nof the Forth Street Works, and went so far as to offer him one-half of\r\nhis (Stephenson’s) share in the business if he would remain. Hackworth\r\nagreed to do so if his name were added to that of the firm and he were\r\npublicly recognised as a partner; but this proposition was not accepted\r\nby Stephenson.\r\n\r\nHackworth then took premises in Newcastle, and intended to commence\r\nbusiness as an engine-builder on his own account, he having already\r\nreceived several orders from the collieries, etc., where his skill\r\nwas well known and appreciated. George Stephenson, having heard of\r\nHackworth’s plans for carrying on a rival engine factory at Newcastle,\r\nsaw Hackworth, and persuaded him to relinquish the proposition and\r\naccept the office of general manager and engineer to the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway.\r\n\r\nHackworth commenced these duties in June, 1825, and removed to\r\nDarlington. The “Locomotion” had four coupled wheels, 4ft. in diameter;\r\ntwo vertical cylinders, 10in. in diameter, placed partly within the\r\nboiler; the stroke was 24in.; steam pressure, 25lb. per square inch;\r\nweight in working order, 6½ tons. The tender was of wood, with a coal\r\ncapacity of three-quarter ton, and a sheet-iron tank holding 240\r\ngallons; weight loaded, 2¼ tons. The tender was supported on four\r\nwheels, each of 30in. diameter. This engine worked on the Stockton\r\nand Darlington Railway till 1850. In September, 1835, “Locomotion”\r\nengaged in a race with the mail coach for a distance of four miles, and\r\nonly beat the horses by one hundred yards! She was used to open the\r\nMiddlesbrough and Redcar Railway on June 4th, 1846, being under the\r\ncharge of Messrs. Plews and Hopkins on this occasion, when she hauled\r\none carriage and two trucks, and took thirty-five minutes to cover\r\nthe eight miles. From 1850 to 1857 she was used as a pumping engine\r\nby Pease at his West Collieries, South Durham, after which she was\r\nmounted on a pedestal at North Road Station, Darlington. This engine\r\nwas in steam upon the Darlington line during the celebration of the\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway jubilee in September, 1875. She has\r\nbeen exhibited as follows:—1876, at Philadelphia; 1881, Stephenson\r\nCentenary; 1886, Liverpool; and 1889, Paris. In April, 1892, she was\r\nremoved from North Road to Bank Top, Darlington.\r\n\r\nThe Forth Street Works in 1826 supplied three more engines to the\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway, named “Hope,” “Black Diamond,” and\r\n“Diligence.” These locomotives possessed many faults; indeed, they were\r\nfrequently stopped by a strong wind, and the horse-drawn trains behind\r\nthe locomotive-propelled ones were delayed because the engines could\r\nnot proceed. “Jemmy” Stephenson (brother to George) was the principal\r\nengine-driver, and he was known far and near as most prolific in the\r\nuse of oaths of a far from Parliamentary style.\r\n\r\n“Jemmy” would be cursing his engine and the horsemen cursing “Jemmy”\r\nfor the delay; and, indeed, the usual result was a general skirmish.\r\nWe have already stated that Hackworth was a deeply religious man, and\r\nthese scenes of lawlessness made a deep impression on his mind, so that\r\nhe sought for some means to improve the locomotives, the radical fault\r\nof which was the shortness of steam—Hackworth knowing that if things\r\nprogressed smoothly “Jemmy” would have fewer occasions to display his\r\noratorical gift. After eighteen months’ working of the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway it was found that locomotive haulage was much more\r\nexpensive than horse-power; indeed, for every pound spent on horse\r\npower about three pounds were paid for locomotive power for doing an\r\nexactly similar amount of work.\r\n\r\nThe £100 stock of the Stockton and Darlington Railway quickly fell to\r\n£50, and the shareholders began to get alarmed.\r\n\r\nThere were two opposite interests at stake—that of the general body\r\nof shareholders and that of the locomotive builders (Messrs. Pease\r\nand Richardson), who were also large shareholders in, and directors\r\nof the Stockton and Darlington Railway, as well as partners in the\r\nfirm of R. Stephenson and Co. The question as to retaining the use of\r\nlocomotive engines was fully discussed at a meeting of the principal\r\nproprietors, and Hackworth, as manager and engineer of the railway, was\r\nasked to give his opinion on the point. He replied: “Gentlemen, if you\r\nwill allow me to make you an engine in my own way, I will engage that\r\nit shall answer your purpose.” To have refused him permission would\r\nhave shown clearly to the other proprietors that Pease and Richardson\r\ndid not care for the principles of steam locomotion, but that it was\r\nthe locomotives constructed at the Forth Street Works they wished to\r\nretain. Therefore, after some discussion, it was agreed that “as a last\r\nexperiment Timothy shall be allowed to carry out his plan.”\r\n\r\nHackworth’s opportunity had now arrived, and the result was the\r\nproduction of the first really successful locomotive steam engine.\r\n\r\nBut although the shareholders “as a last experiment” gave Hackworth\r\nleave to build a locomotive on his own plan, they do not appear to have\r\nhad much belief in the success of the venture, for the boiler of an old\r\nlocomotive was given him to use in the construction of the new engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL LOCOMOTIVE, HACKWORTH’S\r\n“ROYAL GEORGE,” STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY, 1827]\r\n\r\nThe engine was originally a four-wheel engine, provided with four\r\ncylinders, two to each pair of wheels, and it is stated to have been\r\nthe first built in which a single pair of wheels was worked by two\r\npistons actuating cranks placed at right angles to each other. She was\r\nbuilt by Wilson, of Newcastle, and was the fifth engine supplied to the\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway.\r\n\r\nThis boiler was a plain cylinder, 4ft. 4in. in diameter, and 13ft.\r\nlong. A wrought-iron tube of [symbol] shape provided the heating\r\nsurface, the vapour from the furnace travelling from the fire-grate\r\nup and down the tube to the chimney, which was at the same end of the\r\nboiler as the grate; indeed, the chimney was an elongation of the tube\r\ncontinued through the end of the boiler and turned up vertically.\r\n\r\nThis return tube gave the new engine twice the heating surface of the\r\nordinary engines, which were only provided with one straight tube. The\r\nlocomotive was called the “Royal George” (Fig. 10), and was supported\r\non six-coupled wheels, each of 4ft. diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—HACKWORTH’S BLAST PIPE IN THE “ROYAL GEORGE”.]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were placed in a vertical position over the pair of\r\nwheels farthest from the chimney. They were 11in. diameter, the stroke\r\nbeing 20in. Four of the wheels were provided with springs, but the\r\npair connected to the pistons were not so fitted, the position of the\r\ncylinders rendering it impossible for springs to be used. The other\r\nimprovements to be noted in the construction of the “Royal George” are:—\r\n\r\n    (1.) Springs instead of weights for the safety valves.\r\n    (2.) The short-stroked pumps.\r\n    (3.) Self-lubricating bearings fitted with oil reservoirs.\r\n    (4.) The cylinders placed central with the crank journals and\r\n         the centre of its orbit.\r\n    (5.) The first example of six-coupled wheels.\r\n    (6.) The first really spring-mounted locomotive, the springs\r\n         performing the double functions of “bearing springs” and\r\n         “balance beams.”\r\n    (7.) A portion of the exhaust steam used as a jet beneath the\r\n         fire-grate and part also for heating the feed-water; and\r\n         last and most important—so important, indeed, that it has\r\n         been described as the “life-breath of the high-pressure\r\n         locomotive”—_the Steam Blast_. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nTrevithick, Nicholson, Stephenson, Gurney, and others have been\r\ncredited with the production of this valuable contrivance, but an\r\ninquiry into the facts conclusively proves that before Hackworth built\r\nthe “Royal George” the real nature of the exhaust steam blast was\r\nnot understood by any of those who have since been credited with the\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nDoubtless several locomotive experimentalists, after various endeavours\r\nto get rid of the spent steam, at last turned the escape pipe into the\r\nchimney, as the most practical way of discharging the exhaust steam.\r\nTrevithick did so, and George Stephenson and others simply followed\r\nTrevithick’s example, but knew nothing of the value of the exhaust\r\nsteam as a means of increasing the heating powers of the locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—WASTE STEAM-PIPE IN STEPHENSON’S “ROCKET”]\r\n\r\nThe claims of both Stephenson and Trevithick appear to be founded on\r\nthe use of the words “steam blast” by N. Wood in his “Treatise,” when\r\ndescribing the exhaust steam arrangement. This he probably did, not\r\nunderstanding the true nature of the blast, or contracted orifice, as\r\ninvented by Hackworth.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident that Trevithick was absolutely ignorant of\r\nthe effect of the blast on the fire, for in his patent (No. 2,599) no\r\nmention is made of it, although the specification is most minutely\r\ndrawn; indeed, thirteen years later Trevithick actually patented\r\n“fanners, etc., for creating an artificial draught in the chimney.”\r\nNicholson, in his patent (No. 2,990) dated November 22nd, 1806, also\r\nsays, “The steam must be high pressure; _the steam draught cannot be\r\nproduced by exhaust steam_”. This clearly shows he was not aware of the\r\nexhaust steam blast; indeed, he expressly states that _exhaust steam\r\ncannot be used_. With regard to George Stephenson, the fact that as\r\nlate as July 25th, 1828, he wrote to Timothy Hackworth, “We have tried\r\nthe new locomotive engine (‘Lancashire Witch’) at Bolton; we have also\r\ntried the blast to it for burning coke, and I believe it will answer.\r\n_There are two bellows, worked by eccentrics underneath the tender._”\r\nIt will, therefore, be observed that Stephenson’s “blast” was produced\r\nby bellows. This letter was written ten months after Hackworth had\r\nsuccessfully used the steam blast in the “Royal George.”\r\n\r\nIt will be shown later that it was only at the Rainhill trials, in\r\nOctober, 1829, that Stephenson learned Hackworth’s secret of the blast\r\npipe. Although Gurney, in 1822, used a coned pipe, he expressly states\r\nthat the steam must be continuously ejected at a high velocity from a\r\nhigh-pressure boiler, which distinctly shows he did not use exhaust\r\nsteam as Hackworth did.\r\n\r\nWalker and Rastrick were the engineers engaged by the directors of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway to report on the advantages to be\r\ngained from the adoption of stationary or locomotive engines on the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway. They decided in favour of the former,\r\nbut they stated in their report, “Hackworth’s engine (‘Royal George’)\r\nis undoubtedly the most powerful that has yet been made, as the amount\r\nof tons conveyed by it, compared with the other engines, proves.” The\r\nfirst year’s work of the “Royal George” consisted of conveying 22,442\r\ntons of goods 20 miles, at a cost of only £466, whilst the same amount\r\nof work performed by horses cost £998, showing a saving by the use\r\nof the “Royal George” of £532 in one year. The “Royal George” was\r\nnumbered, 1½, in the books of the S. and D. R.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that a locomotive engine had worked for a whole\r\nyear at a cheaper rate than horses. Upon this result being known to the\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway directors, one of them exclaimed, “All\r\nwe want is plenty of Timothy’s locomotives.” The “Royal George” worked\r\nnight and day upon the Stockton and Darlington Railway until December,\r\n1840, when she was sold to the Wingate Grange Colliery for _£125 more\r\nthan her original cost_.\r\n\r\nR. Stephenson and Co. in 1828 supplied a six-wheel coupled engine,\r\n“Experiment,” to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. This locomotive\r\nhad inclined outside cylinders, 9in. diameter, with a stroke of 24in.;\r\nthe wheels were 4ft. diameter. This engine did not give nearly so\r\nsatisfactory results as Hackworth’s “Royal George.”\r\n\r\nReference must here be made to Stevenson’s locomotive, “Twin Sisters,”\r\nused in the construction of the Lancashire and Manchester Railway. She\r\nhad two fire-boxes and boilers, and two chimneys; she was supported on\r\nsix-coupled wheels of 4ft. diameter; the cylinders were outside in an\r\ninclined position. The “Lancashire Witch” (previously mentioned) was\r\nbuilt by Stephenson and Co. in 1828 and sold to the Bolton and Leigh\r\nRailway. She was supported on four coupled wheels, 4ft. diameter; the\r\ncylinders were outside, 9in. diameter, fixed in an inclined position,\r\nprojecting over the top and at the rear of the boiler. The engine is\r\nonly mentioned for the purpose of noticing the fact that the fire was\r\nurged by means of bellows, worked by eccentrics fixed on the leading\r\naxle of the four-wheeled tender, which was specially built with outside\r\nframes for the purpose of allowing sufficient room to locate the\r\nbellows, etc. Yet some people have assurance enough to state that at\r\nthe time Stephenson built this engine, and provided it with bellows for\r\nthe purpose of urging the fire, he was fully acquainted with the nature\r\nand advantages of the steam blast!!\r\n\r\nIn the South Kensington Museum there is preserved the “Agenoria,” a\r\nlocomotive built for the Shutt End Railway by Foster, Rastrick and Co.\r\nin 1829, the engine being put to work on June 2nd in that year. It is a\r\nfour-wheel engine, with vertical cylinders, 7½in. diameter, placed at\r\nthe fire-box end; the stroke is 3ft., and the motion is taken from two\r\nbeams fixed over the top of the boiler, which is 10ft. long and 4ft.\r\ndiameter. The slide-valve eccentrics are loose upon the axle, and to\r\nenable the engine to work both ways a clutch is provided, as also is\r\nhand gear to the valves, to enable the axle to make a half turn, and so\r\nbring either the forward or backward clutch into action. The chimney\r\nwas of abnormal height. The “Agenoria” worked for some thirty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 R. Stephenson and Co. supplied an engine named “Rocket,”\r\nNo. 7, to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, similar in general\r\ndesign to “Experiment,” No. 6 (already referred to). This engine was\r\ndelivered at the time Hackworth was attending the Rainhill locomotive\r\ncontest, and a director of the Stockton and Darlington Railway wrote to\r\nHackworth, describing the shortcomings of this engine as follows:—“The\r\nnew one last sent was at work scarcely a week before it was completely\r\ncondemned and not fit to be used in its present state. The hand gear\r\nand valves have no control in working it. When standing without the\r\nwagons at Tully’s a few day ago it started by itself when the steam\r\nwas shut off, and all that Jem Stephenson could do he could not stop\r\nit; it ran down the branch with such speed that old Jem was crying out\r\nfor help, everyone expecting to see them dashed to atoms; the depôts\r\nbeing quite clear of wagons, this would have been the case had not the\r\nteamers and others thrown blocks in the way and fortunately threw it\r\noff. A similar occurrence took place on the following day in going down\r\nto Stockton. As soon as the wagons were unhooked at the top of the run,\r\naway goes ‘Maniac,’ defying all the power and skill of her jockey, old\r\nJem; nor could it be stopped until it arrived near the staiths. Had a\r\ncoach been on the road coming up, its passengers would have been in\r\na most dangerous position. The force-pump is nearly useless, having\r\nhad, every day it was at work, to fill the boiler with pails at each\r\nof the watering-places. No fewer than three times the lead plug has\r\nmelted out. This ‘Maniac’ was a Forth Street production, and at last\r\nwas obliged to be towed up to the ‘hospital’ by a real ‘Timothy’ in\r\nfront, on six wheels, and actually had twenty-four wagons in the rear\r\nas guard. It is now at headquarters at Shildon.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the opinion expressed by a director of the Stockton and\r\nDarlington concerning a Stephenson locomotive!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Liverpool and Manchester Railway Locomotive\r\n        Competition—The conditions of the contest—The\r\n        competitors—The “Novelty”—The “Sanspareil”—The secret\r\n        of the steam blast stolen—Mr. Hick’s history of the\r\n        “Sanspareil”—The “Rocket”—Colburn’s comparison of\r\n        the “Rocket” and “Sanspareil”—Booth’s tubular boiler\r\n        fitted to the “Rocket”—The prize divided—History\r\n        of the “Rocket”—The “Perseverance” wihtdrawn from\r\n        competition—The “Cycloped” horse-propelled locomotive—\r\n        Winan’s manumotive vehicles for the Liverpool and\r\n        Manchester Railway—The directors purchase a dozen.\r\n\r\nAlthough Walker and Rastrick had reported to the directors of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway in favour of stationary engines,\r\nthere were some of them who were enlightened enough to be desirous of\r\ngiving steam locomotives a fair trial. The Stephensons being locomotive\r\nengine builders, naturally were not behindhand in fully and frequently\r\ndescribing the superiority of locomotive traction. Finally, at the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Harrison, the directors offered a prize of £500, to\r\nbe awarded to the locomotive that at the trial appeared to be the best\r\nmachine competing. The following is a copy of the notice detailing the\r\nconditions of the competition:—\r\n\r\n                    “Railway Office, Liverpool, 25th April, 1829.\r\n\r\n    “Stipulations and Conditions on which the Directors of the\r\n    Liverpool and Manchester Railway offer a premium of £500 for\r\n    the most improved Locomotive Engine:—\r\n\r\n    “1st. The said engine must effectually consume its own\r\n    smoke, according to the provisions of the Railway Act, 7,\r\n    George IV.\r\n\r\n    “2nd. The engine, if it weighs six tons, must be capable of\r\n    drawing after it, day by day, on a well-constructed railway,\r\n    on a level plane, a train of carriages of the gross weight\r\n    of twenty tons, including the tender and water-tank, at a\r\n    rate of ten miles per hour, with a pressure of steam on the\r\n    boiler not exceeding fifty pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\n    “3rd. There must be two safety valves, one of which must be\r\n    completely out of the control of the engineman, and neither\r\n    of which must be fastened down while the engine is working.\r\n\r\n    “4th. The engine and boiler must be supported on springs,\r\n    and rest on six wheels, and the height from the ground to\r\n    the top of the chimney must not exceed fifteen feet.\r\n\r\n    “5th. The weight of the machine, with its complement of\r\n    water in the boiler, must at most not exceed six tons;\r\n    and a machine of less weight will be preferred if it draw\r\n    after it a proportionate weight; and, if the weight of the\r\n    engine, etc., does not exceed five tons, then the gross\r\n    weight to be drawn need not exceed fifteen tons, and in that\r\n    proportion for machines of still smaller weight; provided\r\n    that the engine, etc., shall still be on six wheels, unless\r\n    the weight (as above) be reduced to four-tons and a half\r\n    or under, in which case the boiler, etc., may be placed on\r\n    four wheels.

The distance\r\n    within the rails is four feet eight inches and a half.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—THE “NOVELTY,” ENTERED BY BRAITHWAITE AND\r\nERICSSON FOR THE RAINHILL PRIZE]\r\n\r\nAt this period there were but few men who understood even the outlines\r\nof locomotive construction, and unfortunately all of these did not\r\ntake part in the competition. The fifth condition, limiting the weight\r\nof the loaded locomotive to six tons, probably deterred some makers\r\nfrom competing. Others had commenced constructing locomotives for the\r\ncompetition, but were unable to finish them by the date mentioned in\r\nthe conditions.\r\n\r\nThe actual entries were as follows: 1. Braithwaite and Ericsson’s\r\n“Novelty”; 2. Timothy Hackworth’s “Sanspareil”; 3. R. Stephenson’s\r\n“Rocket”; 4. Burstall’s “Perseverance”; and 5. Brandreth’s “Cycloped.”\r\n\r\nThe “Novelty” (Fig. 13) was far and away the favourite engine at\r\nRainhill, its neat appearance and smartness attracting universal\r\nattention. It was a “tank” engine, and probably the first locomotive\r\nconstructed to carry its supply of water and coal on the engine,\r\nbeing thus complete without a tender. This raised a difficulty in\r\napportioning the load, as in the conditions it was arranged that the\r\ntender was to be counted as part of the load hauled. The machine with\r\nwater and coal weighed 3 tons 17 cwt. 14 lb.; the allowance made for\r\nthe tender and fuel reduced the theoretical weight of the “Novelty,”\r\nas an engine only, to 2 tons 13 cwt. 2 qr. 3½ lb.; the gross weight\r\nhauled, including the locomotive, being 10 tons 14 cwt. 14 lb.\r\n\r\nThe “Novelty” was first tried upon October 10th, 1829—she had not\r\npreviously been upon a railway—and it was found necessary to make some\r\nalterations to her wheels. Timothy Hackworth, although he had an engine\r\nrunning in competition with the “Novelty,” generously offered to repair\r\nthe defect, and he personally took out the broken portion, welded it,\r\nand replaced it in position with his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe trials were conducted upon a level portion of line at Rainhill,\r\non a course only one and a half miles in length, and at either end an\r\nadditional eighth of a mile was allowed for the purpose of getting up\r\nthe speed and stopping after the run of a mile and a half. The engines\r\nhad to make forty runs over the course, or a distance of sixty miles,\r\nin all, which was computed to be equal to a return journey between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester.\r\n\r\nAfter running two trips of one and a half miles each, the pipe from the\r\npump to the boiler burst, in consequence of the cock between the boiler\r\nand pump having, by accident, been closed. The “Novelty” and train\r\ncovered the first trip in five minutes thirty-six seconds, and the\r\nreturn in six minutes forty seconds; being at the rate of 16.07 and 13½\r\nmiles an hour respectively. After being repaired, the engine, with its\r\ntrain, made an unofficial trip, and developed a speed of 21 ⅙ miles an\r\nhour. Without a load the “Novelty” attained a speed of nearly thirty\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe “Novelty” was again tried on October 14th, but upon its third\r\ntrip part of the boiler gave way, and it was decided to withdraw the\r\nlocomotive from competition.\r\n\r\nThe boiler of the “Novelty” was partly vertical and partly horizontal;\r\nthe latter portion was about 12ft. long and 15in. in diameter. In the\r\nformer was the fire-box, surrounded by water, coke being supplied\r\nthrough what at first might be mistaken for the funnel of a steam\r\nfire-engine. This was, however, kept air-tight, the fuel being\r\nintroduced by means of a descending hopper. The area of the fire-grate\r\nwas 1.8 sq. ft., the fire-box heating surface 9½ sq. ft., and the\r\nheating surface of the tubes, 33 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe air entered below the fire-bars by a pipe traversing the length of\r\nthe engine, and connected with bellows fixed above the frame at the\r\nother extreme of the engine. The bellows were worked by the engine,\r\nso that the “Novelty” was provided with a forced draught. The heated\r\nair was forced through a tube, which made three journeys through\r\nthe horizontal portion of the boiler, and was consequently 36ft. in\r\nlength. It was 4in. in diameter at the grate end, and 3in. at the\r\nother extreme, where it was turned up as a chimney. The cylinders were\r\nlocated over the pair of wheels at the bellows end of the machine. They\r\nwere fixed vertically, the diameter being 6in., and length of stroke\r\n12in. The piston-rods worked through the top covers, and by means of\r\ncross-heads, side-rods, and bell-cranks the motion was conveyed to the\r\ncrank axle beneath the vertical portion of the boiler, although, as\r\npreviously mentioned, the cylinders were over the other pair of wheels.\r\nThe wheels were 4ft. 2.1in. in diameter, and chains were provided for\r\ncoupling the wheels together; but these were not used at Rainhill.\r\n\r\nThe water was carried in a tank located between the axles below the\r\nframe. The construction of the “Novelty” was only decided upon on\r\nAugust 1st, 1829, but so expeditiously was the work carried out that\r\nshe was constructed in London, and delivered in Liverpool—a lengthy\r\njourney at that time—by September 29th, 1829. Her distinguishing\r\ncolours at Rainhill were copper and blue.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the Rainhill Competition several alterations\r\nwere made in the design of this engine, the position of the cylinders\r\nbeing altered from vertical to horizontal by Watson and Daglish, and in\r\n1833 she was working on the St. Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway.\r\n\r\nAlthough, through an accident, the “Novelty” had to be withdrawn from\r\ncompeting for the prize at Rainhill, the directors of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway were so well satisfied with her performances that\r\nthey gave Braithwaite and Ericsson an order for some locomotives of the\r\nsame design. A description of these will be found in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—HACKWORTH’S “SANSPAREIL,” ONE OF THE\r\nCOMPETITORS AT RAINHILL]\r\n\r\nThe engine next in order was Timothy Hackworth’s “Sanspareil,” (Fig.\r\n14), now preserved in the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\nThe engine-shops at Shildon were not in a position to construct the\r\nwhole of this locomotive; consequently Hackworth was forced to obtain\r\nthe boiler and cylinders from other makers. The former was constructed\r\nat Bedlington Ironworks, and was of cylindrical form, 6ft. long, 4ft.\r\n2in. diameter, with one end flat and the other hemispherical. The\r\nheating surface was provided by means of a double return tube, the\r\nfire-grate and chimney being both at the same end.\r\n\r\nThe area of the fire-grate was 10 sq. ft., the heating surface of same\r\n15.7 sq. ft., the remaining heating surface 74½ sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were constructed by B. Stephenson and Co., and six had to\r\nbe made before two perfect ones were obtained, the sixth one, indeed,\r\nonly being fitted at Liverpool when the contest was in progress.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that these cylinders were purposely constructed\r\nin a faulty manner to prevent the “Sanspareil” beating the “Rocket.”\r\nThis may or may not be true, but it is very evident that, save for\r\nStephenson’s imperfect workmanship in this respect, the “Sanspareil”\r\nwould have won the £500 prize. When the “Sanspareil” was competing\r\nfor the prize, one of the cylinders supplied by Stephenson and Co.\r\nburst, and it was found that the metal was only one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch thick! A nice state of things certainly! The cylinders were 7in.\r\ndiameter, the stroke being 18in. The engine was carried on four wheels,\r\n4ft. 6in. diameter. Total weight of engine, 4 tons 15 cwt. 2 qr.\r\n\r\nShe was, of course, fitted with Hackworth’s exhaust steam blast.\r\n\r\nDuring some preliminary trips at Rainhill, Stephenson was greatly\r\nsurprised to see how well the “Sanspareil” ran, and he noticed she\r\nalways had a good supply of steam, so he got upon the engine and had\r\na ride on her. During this trip he said to Hackworth, “Timothy, what\r\nmakes the sparks fly out of the chimney?” Hackworth touched the exhaust\r\npipe near the cylinders, and answered, “It is the end of this little\r\nfellow that does the business.”\r\n\r\nAfter Stephenson got off the engine, John Thompson, the driver (he\r\nwas Hackworth’s foreman at Shildon), said to Hackworth, “Why did you\r\ntell him how you did it, sir? He will be trying to fit up the ‘Rocket’\r\nin the same way.” Hackworth said he did not think so, but Thompson\r\ndetermined to watch the “Sanspareil” all night. He therefore locked\r\nhimself in the shed containing the engine that night, but towards\r\ndaybreak sleep overcame him, and when he awoke he saw two men getting\r\nout of the window of the shed, and he found the chimney door of the\r\n“Sanspareil” open, and some materials inside the chimney. The secret\r\nof the exhaust steam blast was stolen! The next evening the “Rocket”\r\nagain appeared; this time she was fitted with a similar contrivance.\r\nThe above is Hackworth’s foreman’s version of the theft, but the\r\n“Practical Mechanic’s Journal” for June, 1850, gives the tale as told\r\nby the man who committed the theft.\r\n\r\nWhen in repair, the “Sanspareil” ran faster, took a heavier load,\r\nand consumed less coke than the “Rocket,” and whilst the latter was\r\nremodelled within twelve months of the Rainhill contest, the former\r\nworked with practically no alteration until 1844. In 1864 she was\r\npresented to the South Kensington Museum by Mr. John Hick, M.P., Bolton.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from her history, as supplied by Mr. Hick\r\nto the Museum authorities:—\r\n\r\n“After the Rainhill trial the engine was purchased by the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway Company, and used by them for various purposes.\r\nIn 1831, the engine was purchased by Mr. John Hargreaves, of Bolton,\r\nand was employed by him in the conveyance of passengers and general\r\ntraffic on the Bolton and Leigh Railway for several years. In 1837, Mr.\r\nHargreaves had the engine thoroughly repaired, and put on a pair of new\r\ncylinders of larger dimensions than the old ones, so as to increase the\r\npower. The original wood-spoked wheels were also removed at this time,\r\nand replaced with cast-iron hollow-spoked wheels.\r\n\r\n“One pair of these are under the engine at the present time. The engine\r\ncontinued regularly at work in conveying coals, general goods, and\r\npassengers until 1844, when, being found much too small and short of\r\npower for the rapidly increasing traffic, Mr. Hargreaves took her to\r\nhis colliery at Coppull, near Chorley, Lancashire, where the engine was\r\nfixed near a coal-pit. One axle and one pair of wheels were removed,\r\nand upon the other toothed gear was fitted, in order to give motion\r\nto winding and pumping apparatus, and the engine commenced its work\r\nas a regular fixed colliery engine, pumping and winding in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner until the end of the year 1863; having raised many\r\nthousand tons of coal and many million gallons of water, and even\r\nat the time above named was in fair working order, and only removed\r\nbecause the coal in the pit was exhausted.\r\n\r\n“I hope the old engine will now find a permanent resting place in the\r\nKensington Museum, where her end will be peace, if not pieces. Mr.\r\nHargreaves has kindly given me the old engine, in consequence of my\r\nhaving told him of my intention with regard to her. And having restored\r\nher as far as possible by collecting and putting together the available\r\nmaterials, I have pleasure in presenting this interesting relic to the\r\nMuseum.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—STEPHENSON’S “ROCKET,” THE WINNER OF THE\r\nRAINHILL PRIZE OF £500.]\r\n\r\nThe “Rocket” (Fig. 15), was entered in the name of Robert Stephenson,\r\nand was constructed at the Forth Street Works, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in\r\n1829. Her distinguishing colours were yellow and black, with a white\r\nchimney. She was the first engine to be tried at Rainhill. Her weight\r\nwas 4 tons 5 cwt.; load (including tender), 12¾ tons; total, 17 tons.\r\nDuring the first twenty trips she attained a maximum speed of 24.43\r\nmiles an hour, the average being 13.42 mile’s an hour; during the\r\nsecond twenty trips an average speed of 14.2 miles an hour was the\r\nresult, with a maximum speed of 24 miles an hour. These short trips of\r\none and a half miles each just suited the design of the “Rocket,” as\r\nthe steam raised before starting on each trip was sufficient to work\r\nher the one and a half miles; had the trips been longer, she—not then\r\nbeing furnished with a proper blast, but with that illustrated on Page\r\n25—would probably have stopped for want of steam. Of this Z. Colburn\r\nsignificantly states: “The ‘Rocket,’ on the first day of her trial,\r\nderived but little benefit from the discharge of the exhaust steam up\r\nthe chimney; and, indeed, made steam nearly as freely when standing as\r\nwhen running.” Without a load, or tender even, she attained a speed\r\nof 29½ miles an hour. The authority just quoted says: “The real power\r\nof the ‘Sanspareil’ is to be estimated by its rate of evaporation,\r\nwhich was one-third greater than that of the ‘Rocket,’ and thus the\r\n‘Sanspareil,’ after allowing for its greater weight, was the most\r\npowerful engine brought forward for trial.... As far as it had gone,\r\nthe mean rate of speed (of the ‘Sanspareil’) was greater than that of\r\nthe ‘Rocket’ up to the same stage of the experiment.”\r\n\r\nThe boiler of the “Rocket” was cylindrical, with flat ends, 6ft. long,\r\n3ft. 4in. diameter; the fire-box was 3ft. long, 2ft. broad, and about\r\n3ft. deep; between the box and the outer casing was a space of 3in.\r\nfilled with water. The cylinders were placed at an angle of 45 degrees\r\nat the fire-box end, the connecting-rod being attached to a pin on the\r\nleading wheels, which were 4ft. 8½in. diameter, that of the cylinders\r\nbeing 8in.; the stroke was 16½in.\r\n\r\nThe “Rocket” had a great advantage over other engines because she was\r\nsupplied with a tubular boiler, containing 25 tubes of 3in. diameter.\r\nThe idea of the tubular boiler did not originate with the Stephensons.\r\nMr. Booth, the Secretary of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\r\nsuggested their use in the “Rocket”; but before this the tubular\r\nlocomotive boiler had been patented by a Frenchman (M. Sequin), on\r\nFebruary 22nd, 1828. Mr. Booth, however, states that he was unaware\r\nof the French patent, and, so far as he was concerned, the tubular\r\nboiler was an original discovery. The use of these tubes increased\r\nthe evaporating power of the boiler three-fold, and at the same time\r\nreduced the consumption of coke 40 per cent.; yet the “Rocket,” with\r\nthis great advantage, was not equal to the “Sanspareil,” until the\r\nformer was fitted with Hackworth’s blast. When this had been done,\r\nthe “Rocket” was capable of hauling 20 tons (engine included) up an\r\nincline of 1 in 96, at 16 miles an hour, for a distance of one and a\r\nhalf miles. The prize of £500 was divided between Robert Stephenson,\r\nthe constructor of the “Rocket,” and Mr. Booth, the suggester of the\r\ntubular boiler, which enabled that locomotive to be entitled to the\r\nprize. Tubular boilers had been successfully used in steam road coaches\r\nas early as 1821.\r\n\r\nAfter running a year or so, the “Rocket” was rebuilt, the cylinders\r\nbeing placed in a slightly inclined position over the trailing wheels,\r\nbut still working the leading wheels; a smoke-box was added, and other\r\nimprovements introduced.\r\n\r\nThe “Rocket” was bought in the year 1837, from the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway, by Mr. J. Thompson, of Kirkhouse, the lessee of the\r\nEarl of Carlisle’s coal and lime works.\r\n\r\nHere the engine was worked for five or six years on the Midgeholme\r\nline—a local line belonging to Mr. Thompson—for forwarding his coals\r\nfrom the pits towards Carlisle.\r\n\r\nSoon after the engine was placed on this line the great contest for\r\nEast Cumberland took place, when Sir J. Graham was superseded by Mayor\r\nAglionby, and she was used for conveying the Alston express with the\r\nstate of the poll from Midgeholme to Kirkhouse. Upon that occasion the\r\n“Rocket” was driven by Mr. Mark Thompson, and accomplished her share\r\nof the work, a distance of upwards of four miles, in 4½ minutes, thus\r\nreaching a speed nearly equal to 60 miles an hour. On the introduction\r\nof heavier and more powerful engines, the “Rocket” was “laid up in\r\nordinary” in the yard at Kirkhouse. This historic steam locomotive\r\nis now preserved in the South Kensington Museum. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that the “Rocket” has been rebuilt, and its design\r\nconsiderably altered, since the Rainhill competition of 1829.\r\n\r\nThe last of the steam locomotives entered for trial at Rainhill remains\r\nto be described. The “Perseverance” was constructed by Mr. Burstall,\r\nof Edinburgh. He was already known as a maker of steam road coaches.\r\nUnfortunately for the success, or rather want of success, of the\r\n“Perseverance,” Mr. Burstall designed his railway locomotive on much\r\nthe same lines as his steam coaches.\r\n\r\nThe “Perseverance” had the misfortune to have some damage done to its\r\nwheels, etc., when being unloaded at Rainhill off the wagon on which it\r\nhad been conveyed from Liverpool. A preliminary trial was made, and Mr.\r\nBurstall, finding the engine was unable to attain a higher speed than\r\nabout six miles an hour, withdrew his locomotive from competition.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was horizontal, and the water was admitted to shallow trays\r\nplaced over the fire, and in this way was immediately converted into\r\nsteam. The cylinders were vertical, and worked horizontal beams placed\r\nabove them; the wheels were worked by cranks fixed on the beams about\r\nhalf-way between the cylinders and the centre pivots of the beams. The\r\nsecond pair of wheels was driven by means of an axle with bevel wheels\r\nat each end, which conveyed the motion from the one axle to the other.\r\n\r\nThis engine was distinguished by having the wheels painted red.\r\n\r\nAlthough not “steam” locomotives, we think it right to give a few\r\ndetails of the “Cycloped,” (Fig. 16), and also of Winans’ manumotive\r\ncarriage, both of which were exhibited at Rainhill. The former was\r\nworked by a horse or horses fastened on a frame supported by four\r\nwheels; the horses walked at a speed of one and a quarter miles an\r\nhour, on an endless platform formed of planks of wood. The horses being\r\nfirmly attached to the frame could not go forward when they essayed to\r\nwalk, and the consequence of their using their legs was the revolving\r\nof the floor, which worked round drums geared to the driving wheels.\r\nThis motion caused the vehicle to move forward on the rails at a speed\r\nof about three miles an hour, with a load of fifty passengers. Had the\r\nhorses moved at a quicker rate, the speed of the “Cycloped” would have\r\nbeen increased in a proportionate ratio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—WINANS’ “CYCLOPED” HORSE LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nWinans’ carriage was worked by two men, who turned a windlass, which\r\nactuated the wheels. It accommodated six passengers, and it was\r\nfacetiously proposed that those passengers who worked at the windlasses\r\nshould be conveyed by such vehicles at reduced rates. Although we now\r\nsmile at the simplicity of such vehicles ever having been suggested for\r\nworking on a railway, the Directors of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway were considerably taken with the idea of Winans’ man-propelled\r\ncarriages, and they engaged two well-known engineers to report on\r\ntheir adaptability for passenger traffic on the railway. As might be\r\nexpected, the experts reported against the proposed use of Winans’\r\nmachines; but, despite this adverse report, the Directors of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway actually bought twelve of these\r\n“manumotive” carriages of Winans. The purchase was made prior to March,\r\n1830, and as we do not read of their being used after the railway was\r\nopened in September, 1830, we may conclude that during the six months\r\nthat elapsed between the purchase and the opening of the line the\r\nDirectors had come to the same conclusion regarding the machines as did\r\nthe engineers who reported against their use on the railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    An important improvement in the locomotive—Bury’s original\r\n        “Liverpool,” the first inside cylinder engine—Bury’s\r\n        own account of his invention—Other authorities agree\r\n        with Bury—Extract, supplied by the Secretary of the L.\r\n        & N.

Of late years many extraordinary statements concerning various\r\ntypes and designs of locomotives have been made, and the “romancing”\r\nrelative to the original “Liverpool” is perhaps the most conspicuous,\r\nwhilst at the same time its utter incorrectness is easily proved.\r\n\r\nOne of these statements is that “the first engine built by Bury at\r\nClarence Foundry was an outside cylinder engine, the ‘Dreadnought,’\r\nwhich was completed March 30th, 1830, but proved a failure. However,\r\nhe lost no time, but, with the assistance of his foreman, Mr. Kennedy,\r\ngot out working drawings for a new engine, to be named the ‘Liverpool.’\r\nThis engine, No. 2 in the locomotive order book, and class A in\r\nthe description book, was commenced early in January, 1831; it was\r\ncompleted in March of that year, and in May, 1831, it was put to work\r\non the Petersburg Railroad of America. It had four coupled wheels of\r\n4ft. 6in. diameter.”\r\n\r\nNow, as to the facts, Bury’s books were sold by auction by his\r\ncreditors on August 15th and 16th, 1851; and, even if the books are now\r\nin existence (which is extremely unlikely), it is obviously impossible\r\nfor them to contain the particulars quoted above, for the very\r\nsimple and conclusive reason that the facts relative to the original\r\n“Liverpool” are quite different to the statement just quoted.\r\n\r\nThere are three improvements with which Bury is justly credited in\r\nthe locomotive now under review—viz., the adoption of (1) horizontal\r\ninside cylinders below the smoke-box, (2) cranked driving axle, and (3)\r\ncoupled driving wheels of the (then) great diameter of six feet.\r\n\r\nIn describing this historical “Liverpool” locomotive we cannot do\r\nbetter than quote Bury, the maker and designer of it, and Kennedy,\r\nhis foreman, who constructed it. The former, at a meeting of the\r\nInstitute of Civil Engineers, held on March 17th, 1840, read a paper\r\non the locomotive, and, speaking of the inside cylinder engine, said:\r\n“This form of engine Was adopted by the author as early as 1829, when\r\nhe constructed the ‘Liverpool,’ which was the original model engine,\r\nwith horizontal cylinders and cranked axles. It was set to work on the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway in July, 1830.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—BURY’S ORIGINAL “LIVERPOOL,” THE FIRST ENGINE\r\nWITH INSIDE CYLINDERS AND CRANKED DRIVING AXLE COUPLED WHEELS, 6ft.\r\nDIAMETER.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1843 there was considerable discussion amongst engine builders\r\nand locomotive engineers as to the relative safety of inside and\r\noutside cylinder, engines, and also regarding the superiority of the\r\nfour-wheel or six-wheel locomotive. Bury and Co. thereupon issued a\r\ncircular giving a history of the locomotive practice of their firm, and\r\nthe various advantages claimed for their locomotive designs.\r\n\r\nFrom this circular we extract the following remarks, as bearing upon\r\nthe point now under discussion:—“It was the good fortune Of the\r\nconductor of this foundry to originate the construction of four-wheel\r\nengines, with inside framing, crank axles, and cylinders placed in\r\nthe smoke-box.... The first engine on this principle was manufactured\r\nin this foundry in 1829, prior to the opening of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway.” Such are Mr. Bury’s statements concerning the\r\noriginal “Liverpool.”\r\n\r\nWe will now see what his partner, Mr. James Kennedy, the then President\r\nof the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, had to say regarding the\r\n“Liverpool.”\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Institute of Civil Engineers, held on November\r\n11th, 1856, a communication was read from Mr. Kennedy, in which\r\nhe stated that “the late George Stephenson had told both Bury and\r\nKennedy, after having seen the ‘Liverpool’ engine on the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway, that his son, the present Robert Stephenson,\r\nhad taken a fancy to the plan of the ‘Liverpool,’ and intended to\r\nmake immediately a small engine on the same principle.” This he\r\nafterwards did, Stephenson’s “Planet” being the said engine “on the\r\nsame principle.” Kennedy went on to state that “the letter-book of\r\nthe firm (Bury and Co.) for the year 1830 contained the whole of the\r\ncorrespondence on the subject between the Directors of the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway and Bury.”\r\n\r\nThe reader can readily judge as to which statement is likely to be\r\ncorrect—those of such well-known men as Bury and Kennedy, which are\r\nconcise, straightforward statements of known and accepted facts, or the\r\nrecently published remarks concerning the “books, etc.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, students of locomotive history are not even obliged to\r\ndecide either one way or the other on the statements pro and con\r\nalready quoted concerning the original “Liverpool,” but are able to\r\ngain independent and conclusive evidence on this important point in\r\nlocomotive history. For the purpose of finally clearing up the point,\r\nthe writer communicated with the Secretary of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway, asking him to examine the Directors’ Minute Books of\r\nthe Liverpool and Manchester Railway for the year 1830, to see if these\r\nauthentic documents contained any reference to Bury’s “Liverpool.”\r\nMr. Houghton most generously had the search we required made, and the\r\nresult was as might have been expected. But let the letter tell its own\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n                     “London and North Western Railway,\r\n                             “Secretary’s Office, Euston Station, N.W.\r\n                                                  “June, 3rd, 1896.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Sir,—With further reference to your request for information\r\n    relative to Bury’s locomotives, I have had the Minute Books of the\r\n    Liverpool and Manchester Railway searched for the years 1829-30.\r\n\r\n    “Towards the end of 1830 the Board sanctioned the [further] trial\r\n    of the ‘Liverpool,’ and it was consequently allowed to work on the\r\n    railway in competition with one of Mr. Stephenson’s engines. The\r\n    engineer was dissatisfied with the size of the wheels, which were\r\n    6ft. instead of his maximum 5ft.; and there was a long controversy\r\n    as to the respective merits of circular and square fire-boxes,\r\n    which was ultimately referred to arbitration, when the square boxes\r\n    recommended by Mr. Stephenson were given the preference.—Yours\r\n    truly,\r\n                                     “(Signed) T. HOUGHTON.”\r\n\r\nThe above letter conclusively settles the points in dispute—viz., that\r\nthe “Liverpool” was tried on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in\r\n1830, and that the diameter of the wheels was 6ft.\r\n\r\nWe have thus pricked the specious bubble that stated the “Liverpool”\r\nwas duly commenced to be built in 1831, and that the diameter of the\r\nwheels was but 4ft. 6in.!\r\n\r\nReaders may wonder why such obviously inaccurate statements should be\r\npublished. One can only conjecture. Many lists of early locomotives\r\nhave during the past few years been published. These should, however,\r\nbe accepted with the very greatest caution. The following table of\r\ndimensions of Bury’s early engines appeared as long ago as September\r\n18th, 1857, in the _Engineer_. As this was nearly forty years before\r\n“locomotive lists” had any marketable value, there can be no reason to\r\ncall in question its accuracy:—\r\n\r\n     -----------+---------+------+--------+------+------+------+------+\r\n                |         |      |        |  No. |Diam. |  No. |Diam. |\r\n       No. of   |Diam. of |Length|Diam. of|  of  | of   |  of  | of   |\r\n       Engines  |Cylinder.|Stroke|Wheels. |Tubes.|Tubes.|Tubes.|Tubes.|\r\n     -----------+---------+------+--------+------+------+------+------+\r\n         No.    |   Ins.  | Ins. |Ft.

The report was made by John Farey and Joshua Field,\r\ntwo celebrated engineers of that period, and was in favour of the\r\nsquare fire-box.\r\n\r\nIt will now be of interest to give a description of Bury’s original\r\n“Liverpool,” which was designed and her construction commenced in 1829.\r\nShe contained many unusual features. Instead of a tubular boiler a\r\nnumber of convoluted flues were used. The fire was urged by bellows\r\nfixed under the tender; the driver stood at one end of the engine in\r\nfront of the smoke-box, and the fireman at the other end, behind the\r\nfire-box; the cylinders were horizontal, placed inside the frames\r\nbeneath the smoke-box; their diameter was 12in., the stroke being\r\n18in.; the four wheels were 6ft. in diameter, and were coupled, and the\r\ndriving axle was, of course, cranked.\r\n\r\nThe “Liverpool,” in this her original state, was used as a ballast\r\nengine in the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, but\r\nnot being very successful, was withdrawn., After some alterations, she\r\nwas again put to work on July 22nd, 1830. Then the crank axle appears\r\nto have broken, and she was again removed for repairs, and again put\r\nto work on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on October 26th,\r\n1830. After the report previously mentioned, the Directors refused to\r\npurchase the “Liverpool,” and Bury removed her to the Bolton and Kenyon\r\nRailway. Here she attained a speed of 58 miles an hour with twelve\r\nloaded wagons. On this line one of her wheels broke, and the driver was\r\nkilled. As a result of this accident, she was then rebuilt and sold\r\nto Hargreaves, the contractor, for locomotive power on the Bolton and\r\nKenyon Railway, and continued to work on that line for some years.\r\n\r\nThe Canterbury and Whitstable Railway was opened on May 3rd, 1830, and\r\nwas the first locomotive line in the South of England. The original\r\nengine, the “Invicta” (Fig. 18), is still preserved by the South\r\nEastern Railway at Ashford, but it is a mere chance that this engine\r\ndid not disappear nearly sixty years ago. The Canterbury and Whitstable\r\nRailway Company, after a short time, let the working of the line to\r\ncontractors, and they preferred to work it by horse-power, and we find\r\nthat in October, 1839, the contractors were advertising the “Invicta”\r\nfor sale, describing her as of “12 horse-power, 18in. stroke, cylinders\r\n24in. long, 9½pin. diameter, wheels 4ft. in diameter.” Fortunately\r\nfor students of early locomotives, there was no demand for the\r\nengine anywhere in the neighbourhood of Whitstable, there then being\r\nno other locomotive line nearer than Greenwich, on which she could\r\nhave been used; so no buyer was forthcoming, and the “Invicta” was\r\nthereupon laid up. The dimensions of the “Invicta,” as supplied to us\r\nby Mr. J. Stirling, are as follows: Cylinders, 10½in. diameter, fixed\r\nin inclined position over leading wheels, and working the trailing\r\nwheels; stroke, 18in.; four-coupled wheels, 4ft. diameter; wheel base,\r\n5ft.; boiler, 10ft. 5in. long, 3ft. 4in. diameter, containing a single\r\nflue 20in. diameter; distance from top of boiler to rails, 6ft.; from\r\ntop of chimney to rails, 11ft. 1in.; chimney, 15in. diameter; total\r\nlength over all, 13ft. 6in. At the bottom of the chimney is a kind of\r\nsmoke-box, measuring about 2ft. 4in. high, 1ft. 8in. long, and 2ft.\r\n4in. wide. The South Eastern Railway exhibited the “Invicta,” at the\r\njubilee of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1875, and at the\r\nNewcastle Stephenson Centenary in 1881. The “Invicta,” when originally\r\nbuilt, is said to have had a tubular boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—THE “INVICTA,” CANTERBURY AND WHITSTABLE RWY.,\r\n1830]\r\n\r\nThe Directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1829 ordered\r\nof Stephenson and Co. seven engines of somewhat similar design to the\r\n“Rocket.” The Directors made their first trip by railway from Liverpool\r\nto Manchester and back on Monday, June 14th, 1830. The train was drawn\r\nby the “Arrow,” and consisted of two carriages and seven wagons; the\r\ntotal weight, including the engine, was 39 tons, the journey to\r\nManchester being made in two hours one minute, whilst the return trip\r\nto Liverpool only took one and a half hours, a speed of 27 miles being\r\nattained for some distance.\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool and Manchester Railway was formally opened on September\r\n15th, 1830, when the “Northumbrian” (Fig. 19), driven by George\r\nStephenson, hauled the train consisting of the Duke of Wellington’s\r\ncarriage, the band, etc., on one line, whilst the “Phœnix,” “North\r\nStar,” “Rocket,” “Dart,” “Comet,” “Arrow,” and “Meteor,” each hauled a\r\ntrain upon the other line. Starting from Liverpool, the eight trains\r\nproceeded towards Manchester. At Parkside Mr. Huskisson was run over by\r\nthe “Rocket,” and he was placed on the “Northumbrian” and conveyed to\r\nEccles in 25 minutes, or at the rate of 36 miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—THE “NORTHUMBRIAN,” THE ENGINE THAT OPENED THE\r\nLIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington’s carriage was now left without an engine, and\r\na curious sight was witnessed; a long chain was obtained, and the\r\ntrains which had been up to this point hauled by the “Phœnix” and\r\n“North Star,” consisting of ten carriages, were joined together. The\r\nchain was then fixed to the Duke of Wellington’s train on the other\r\nline, and so the rest of the journey was performed by the two engines\r\nand ten carriages on one line hauling another train upon a parallel\r\nset of rails. It may be of interest to observe that the carriage built\r\nfor the Duke of Wellington was provided with eight wheels, so it will\r\nbe noticed that eight-wheeled passenger stock is not at all a modern\r\nintroduction, but, on the contrary, has been in use ever since the\r\nopening of the first railway built for the conveyance of passengers.\r\nThe vehicle in question was 32ft. long and 8ft. wide.\r\n\r\nThe two engines ordered by the Directors of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway of Braithwaite and Ericsson after the style of the\r\n“Novelty,” were named “William the Fourth,” (by special permission\r\nof that monarch) and “Queen Adelaide.” They were delivered to the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway immediately the railway was opened,\r\nand on September 22nd, 1830, the “William the Fourth” ran off the\r\nrails on the Sankey Viaduct. A very considerable number of trials were\r\nmade with these locomotives on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway;\r\nbut, as was the case with Bury’s “Liverpool,” Stephenson strongly\r\nobjected to any other maker’s engines being used on the line, and he\r\nwas, therefore, always ready to find out some fault in the engines not\r\nof his construction tendered to the company. Braithwaite and Ericsson\r\nclaimed four great advantages for their class of engines—viz., (1) the\r\ntotal absence of all smoke; (2) the dispensing with a chimney; (3) a\r\nsaving of 120 per cent. in the cost of the fuel, and of 30 per cent. in\r\nthe space required to store it; (4) a saving of 400 per cent. in the\r\nspace occupied by the boilers.\r\n\r\nSeveral improvements were introduced into the “William the Fourth,” and\r\n“Queen Adelaide,” so that they differed somewhat from the “Novelty.”\r\nThey were provided with four-wheeled tenders, which were placed in\r\nfront of the engines. The four wheels of the engines were 5ft. in\r\ndiameter, the wheel base being 6ft. 9in. The horizontal portion of the\r\nboiler was 8ft. long, the vertical portion, containing the fire, etc.,\r\nbeing 6ft. 6in. high and 4ft. diameter. The cylinders were vertical,\r\nbut worked downwards; they were located one on each side of the\r\nvertical portion of the boiler, and a little to the rear of the leading\r\nwheels, to which the motion was conveyed by means of bell-cranks and\r\nconnecting-rods—the latter joined the axle within the wheels, so that\r\nthe driving axle was cranked.\r\n\r\nThe next engine that requires our attention is the celebrated “Globe”\r\n(Fig. 20), designed for the Stockton and Darlington Railway by Timothy\r\nHackworth, and built by R. Stephenson and Co. The “Globe” was built\r\nfor passenger traffic; she was provided with a steam dome, and was the\r\nfirst locomotive built with this advantageous appendage for obtaining\r\ndry steam. The valve motion was reversible by a single lever. The\r\nheating surface was provided for by means of a single fire-tube, whilst\r\nbehind the fire-bridge, and extending to the chimney, were seven small\r\nradiating tubes crossing the main flue.\r\n\r\nThis idea of Hackworth’s was afterwards introduced by Galloway in his\r\nstationary engine boilers, and patented by him. The engine “Globe” had\r\na cranked axle and inside cylinders.\r\n\r\nHackworth explained the construction of the “Globe” to the Directors\r\nof the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and he was instructed to go to\r\nNewcastle and arrange for the building of the “Globe” by Stephenson\r\nand Co. He saw the officials at the Forth Street Works on March 3rd,\r\n1830, and after the examination of the plans there, it is stated that\r\none of the officials objected to the crank axle, saying “it would\r\ncertainly involve a loss of power, as the efficient length of lever\r\ncould only be calculated from the inside of the journal to the axle’s\r\ncentre.” It is well known that Geo. Stephenson had previously seen\r\nBury’s “Liverpool,” and said of it, “My son has taken a fancy to the\r\nplan of the ‘Liverpool’ engine, and intends to make immediately a small\r\nengine on the same principle.” Hackworth’s reply to the objection\r\nto the crank axle was “that he held Stephenson responsible only for\r\nsupplying good workmanship, and not for any failure of the design,\r\nshould such occur.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—HACKWORTH’S “GLOBE” FOR THE STOCKTON AND\r\nDARLINGTON RAILWAY. THE FIRST LOCOMOTIVE WITH A STEAM DOME]\r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, 1830, Hackworth, in company with Harris Dickinson, one of\r\nR. Stephenson and Co.’s foremen, drove over to Bedlington Iron Works to\r\norder the boiler plates required for the construction of the “Globe.”\r\n\r\nHackworth remained at Newcastle till March 6th, and being satisfied\r\nthat the construction of the “Globe” would be immediately proceeded\r\nwith, he returned to Darlington, having obtained a promise of quick\r\ndelivery. The boiler plates were delivered at the Forth Street Works,\r\nApril 14th, 1830.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the engine was, however, delayed until after R.\r\nStephenson and Co. had delivered the “Planet,” inside cylinder\r\nlocomotive, to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The “Globe” opened\r\nthe Stockton and Middlesbrough Branch of the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailway on December 27th, 1830. Her speed frequently exceed 50 miles an\r\nhour with passenger trains.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a deficiency of water, she blew up in 1839. The\r\nengine was provided with a copper globe for the purpose of obtaining\r\ndry steam—hence her name “Globe.” She had four wheels, each of 5ft.\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—STEPHENSON’S “PLANET,” LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nStephenson soon put into practice the borrowed idea of inside cylinder\r\nlocomotives, to his own advantage, and on October 4th, 1830, he\r\ndelivered the first engine of his construction containing inside\r\ncylinders, placed in the smoke-box, as suggested to R. Stephenson by\r\nTrevithick. This locomotive was named the “Planet,” and was constructed\r\nfor the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The cylinders were 11in.\r\ndiameter, stroke 16in. The boiler was 6ft. 6in. long, 3ft. diameter,\r\nand contained 129 tubes. She weighed eight tons; the driving wheels\r\nwere 5ft. diameter, and were placed just in front of the fire-box. The\r\nleading wheels were 3ft. diameter, and projected beyond the front of\r\nthe smoke-box. The frames were outside the wheels, and were of oak\r\nlined with iron plates. As the “Planet” embodied several improvements\r\nnot before used in the engines constructed by Stephenson for the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway, it is natural that the locomotive\r\nshould be able to perform better service than the earlier ones. On\r\nNovember 23rd, 1830, she conveyed a train from Manchester to Liverpool\r\nin one hour, including a stop of two minutes for water.\r\n\r\nOn December 4th, 1830, the “Planet” (Fig. 21) hauled a mixed train,\r\nweighing 76 tons without the engine and convoy (tender) from Liverpool\r\nto Manchester in two hours thirty-nine minutes’ running time.\r\n\r\nStephenson continued to supply various locomotives to the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway with different minor improvements; thus the\r\n“Mercury,” built in December, 1830, had the outside frame placed above\r\nthe driving axle, an improvement on the “Planet,” which had the frames\r\nbelow the driving axle. But all these early engines of Stephenson were\r\nof a very unsatisfactory character. Pambour, writing in 1834, says\r\nof them: “When an engine requires any repair, unless it be for some\r\ntrifling accident, it is taken to pieces and a new one is constructed,\r\nwhich receives the same name as the first, and in the construction of\r\nwhich are made to serve all such parts of the old engine as are still\r\ncapable of being used with advantage. The consequence of this is that\r\na reconstructed or repaired engine is literally a new one. The repairs\r\namount thus to considerable sums, but they include also the renewal of\r\nthe engines.”\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway soon found the\r\nmethod of working their heavy trains with four or five locomotives\r\nwas far from economical, and Stephenson was required to supply more\r\npowerful engines for the merchandise traffic. He, therefore, built the\r\n“Samson” and “Goliath.” These were only four-wheel engines, but all\r\nthe wheels were made of one size and coupled together. The former was\r\ndelivered in January, 1831, and on February 25th she conveyed a train\r\nweighing 164 tons (without reckoning the weight of engine or tender)\r\nfrom Liverpool to Manchester in two and a half hours. The dimensions of\r\nthe engines were: Cylinders 14in. diameter, stroke 16in., wheels 4ft.\r\n6in. diameter, heating surface 457.10 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, the Directors of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway\r\ndecided to work their line by locomotives, and instructed Mr. Dodd,\r\ntheir engineer, to design engines for the purpose. He, however,\r\nmerely adopted the plan used in the construction of the “Locomotion”\r\n(Stockton and Darlington Railway), with the cylinders placed partly\r\nwithin the boiler over the wheels, working by means of cross-heads and\r\nconnecting-rods. He also adopted the tubular boiler, which was, of\r\ncourse, wanting in the “Locomotion.” The engines were constructed by\r\nMurdoch and Aitken, of Glasgow, and were the first locomotives built in\r\nthat city. The first was put to work on May 10th, 1831, and the second\r\non September 10th, 1831. The boilers of these two locomotives were\r\nlagged with wood, and metallic packing was for the first time employed\r\nin connection with the pistons. The cylinders were 10½in. diameter,\r\nstroke 24in., steam pressure 50lb. The locomotives were supported on\r\nfour coupled wheels, the coupling-rods having ball-and-socket joints\r\nat each end. A speed of six miles an hour was attained with Dodd’s\r\nengines, and, although of rough design, they were much more economical\r\nin fuel and repairs than the engines supplied about the same time by\r\nStephenson to the neighbouring Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway. These\r\nlatter two engines were named the “St. Rollox” and “George Stephenson.”\r\nTheir dimensions were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                      Diameter                Wheels.       Weight in\r\n                         of     Stroke.                       working\r\n                     cylinders.          Driving.   Leading.   order.\r\n\r\n    St. Rollox          11in.    14in.   4ft. 6in.   36½in.    6 tons.\r\n    George Stephenson   11in.    16in.   4ft. 6in.  4ft. 6in.  8 tons.\r\n\r\nThe gauge of this line was only 4ft. 6in. The “St. Rollox” cost the\r\nG. and G. Railway about £750; that company sold it to the Paisley and\r\nRenfrew Railway for £350, and the latter, in December, 1848, when\r\nthe gauge of their line was altered, disposed of the locomotive by\r\nauction for £13. It had wooden wheels. At the same auction the other\r\ntwo locomotives of the Paisley and Renfrew Railway were also sold, and\r\nrealised only 20 guineas each, although about ten years previously the\r\nPaisley and Renfrew Railway had paid Murdoch, Aitken, and Co. £1,100\r\nfor each of them. They were six-wheel tank engines. The Scotch engines\r\nwe have just been describing, all burnt coal in place of coke, and as\r\nthey caused a good deal of smoke they were much objected to on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nWe have previously stated that upon the advice of two engineers the\r\nDirectors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had refrained from\r\npurchasing more locomotives from E. Bury, but other people soon saw the\r\ngood points of his engines, and in 1832 the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway considered it policy to purchase another locomotive from the\r\nClarence Foundry. This engine was called the “Liver.” She had cylinders\r\n11in. diameter, 16in. stroke, and driving wheels 5ft. diameter. The\r\n“Liver” worked very successfully, and in 1836 her fire-box was altered\r\nto burn coal, but this experiment turned out somewhat of a failure.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1831, and during 1832, the increasing traffic on the\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway made a considerable increase in the\r\nnumber of locomotives necessary. Hackworth designed two new classes of\r\nengines to work the trains. One type was known as the “Majestic” class,\r\nand six engines of this description were soon at work.\r\n\r\nThe “Majestic” locomotives had each six-coupled wheels. The heating\r\nsurface was obtained from a tube 9ft. long, 2ft. 6in. diameter, one\r\nend of which communicated with the fire-grate; the other was divided\r\nfrom the boiler by a partition-plate, inserted in which were 104 copper\r\ntubes 4ft. long, and reaching to the smoke-box. It should be observed\r\nthat the boiler was 13ft. long. The cylinders were fixed in a vertical\r\nposition in front of the smoke-box, the connecting-rods working on a\r\nstraight shaft or axle parallel with the wheel axles: this driving\r\nshaft was coupled by outside rods to the six wheels. The slide-valves\r\nhad “lap,” and were worked by two eccentrics, which also worked the\r\nforce pumps. The engine was reversed by means of a single lever. This\r\nclass of engines included:—\r\n\r\n    “Majestic,” built by Hackworth.\r\n    “Coronation,” built by Hawthorn.\r\n    “William the Fourth,” built by Hackworth.\r\n    “Northumbrian,” built by Hackworth.\r\n    “Director,” built by Stephenson.\r\n    “Lord Brougham,” built by Hackworth.\r\n\r\nAll of them were built from Hackworth’s designs, the leading dimensions\r\nbeing: Cylinders, 14½in. diameter, stroke, 16in.; boiler, 13ft. long,\r\n3ft. 10in. diameter; weight of engine—empty, 10¼ tons; full, 11¾ tons.\r\nThe other class of engines designed by Hackworth at this time included:—\r\n\r\n    “Darlington,” built by Hawthorn.\r\n    “Shildon,” built by Hackworth.\r\n    “Earl Grey,” built by Hawthorn.\r\n    “Lord Durham,” built by Stephenson.\r\n    “Adelaide,” built by Stephenson.\r\n    “Wilberforce,” built by Hawthorn.\r\n\r\n“Wilberforce,” an illustration of which is given (Fig. 22), was built\r\nby Hawthorn, of Newcastle, and commenced to work in 1832; it had six\r\ncoupled wheels 4ft. in diameter; the cylinders were 14¾in., with 16in.\r\nstroke. Like many of the locomotives of that period, the “Wilberforce,”\r\nas will be observed, had two tenders, one at each end of the engine. On\r\nthe tender at the front end, which only carried coals (the fire-door\r\nbeing at the chimney end of the engines), the fireman stood; whilst\r\nthe other tender, at the foot-plate end, carried water in a barrel,\r\nand also the tool boxes. The engine wheels were made of two separate\r\ncastings or rings, and the axles were all straight, the crank-shaft\r\nbeing carried in separate bearings beneath the foot-plate. There were\r\nno tail lamps in those early days; to make up for this deficiency a\r\ncresset containing burning coal was used. In some cases, when it was\r\nnecessary to indicate the destination of the engine, or the section to\r\nwhich it belonged, as many as three of these cressets of glowing coals\r\nwere employed on the same locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—“WILBERFORCE,” A STOCKTON & DARLINGTON RAILWAY\r\nLOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nOn certain favourable gradients the “Wilberforce” was capable of taking\r\n36 loaded chaldron wagons, equal to about 171 tons, and its coal\r\nconsumption is given as 68lb. per mile. During the year ending June,\r\n1839, this engine ran 16,688 miles, conveyed 635,522 tons over one\r\nmile, and cost £318 10s. 8d., or 4.5d. per mile run, for repairs. The\r\nwages of the driver and fireman during the same period amounted to £353\r\n12s. 8d.\r\n\r\nThe engines of this class, in their time, performed a greater amount\r\nof work than any others then existing. As late as 1846 one of the\r\nprincipal officials of the Stockton and Darlington Railway said of\r\nthem: “Take them, weight for weight, they surpass any engine on the\r\nline.”\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were 14½in. diameter, 16in. stroke; the valve gearing,\r\nwheels, etc., were similar to the “Majestic” class, but the cylinders\r\nwere fixed on a framing extending 6ft. beyond the boiler over the\r\ndriving shaft, which was coupled to the six wheels, each of 4ft.\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe heating surface of the engines was on a different system, a “return\r\nmultitubular fire-tube” being employed. This comprised a principal\r\ntube 8ft. long and 28in. diameter at the fire-grate end, and 24in. at\r\nthe other. Here was fixed a D-shaped box; from this, 89 copper tubes\r\nconveyed the heated air back through the boiler to the semi-circular\r\nbox fixed at the fire-grate end; the chimney came out of this smoke-box\r\nextension. These flues proved most economical, many lasting as long as\r\nsix years, and, when necessary, duplicate ones could be fixed, and the\r\nengine again at work in three days. The boiler was 10ft. long and 4ft.\r\n4in. diameter, weight of engine 10¼ tons empty, 11¾ tons loaded.\r\n\r\nThe “Magnet,” built by Hackworth, at Shildon, in 1832, was an\r\nimprovement on the above. The cylinders were 15in. diameter, 16in.\r\nstroke. The fire-tube at the furnace end was 2ft. diameter, and was\r\ndivided in the middle by a 4in. fire-brick partition. The number of\r\nreturn tubes was 110. These were 7ft. 6in. long. Hackworth was at this\r\ntime hauling all the trains on the Stockton and Darlington Railway by\r\ncontract, at the rate of 2-5d. per ton of goods per mile; afterwards\r\nreduced to a still lower price. He paid the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailway interest at 5 per cent. on the cost of locomotives employed\r\non the line, which were the property of the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailway Company, but leased to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—GALLOWAY’S “CALEDONIAN,” BUILT FOR THE\r\nLIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY IN 1832]\r\n\r\nAn engine named “Caledonian” (Fig. 23) was supplied to the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway in 1832, by Galloway, Borman and Co. She\r\nhad inside frames, four coupled wheels 5ft. diameter, and a domed\r\nfire-box. The curious point about the locomotive was the location\r\nof the cylinders, which were placed on the frame in front of the\r\nsmoke-box, and were fixed vertically, with the piston-rods working\r\nthrough the upper cover, connecting-rods working downwards to the\r\nleading wheels, the axle of which was below the frames, in front of the\r\nsmoke-box.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the “Caledonian” was far from being an\r\neasy-running locomotive, and, after several times running off the\r\nrails, she was rebuilt with inside cylinders and a crank axle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A Stephenson “bogie” engine for America—The genesis of a\r\n        world-famous locomotive film—Its initial effort in\r\n        locomotive construction, the “Experiment”—Her cylinder\r\n        valves—Two early Scotch locomotives—Stephenson favours\r\n        6-wheel engines, and constructs the “Patentee”—Forrester’s\r\n        “Swiftsure”—Opening of the Newcastle and Carlisle Rwy.—The\r\n        “Comet”— R.

Stephenson and Co., in 1833, constructed a locomotive for the\r\nSaratoga and Schenectady Rail Road of America, which deserves mention\r\nfrom the fact that it had a leading bogie, rendered necessary because\r\nof the sharp curves on the Saratoga and Schenectady Rail Road. R.\r\nStephenson named this locomotive the “Bogie,” because the low wagons\r\nused on the quarries at Newcastle were locally called “bogies,” and\r\nit was from these vehicles that he developed the idea of providing a\r\nsmall truck to carry the leading end of the locomotive in question.\r\nEver since 1833 the swivelling truck used for supporting locomotives\r\nand other railway rolling stock has, in England, been designated the\r\n“bogie.”\r\n\r\nRichard Roberts, of the firm of Sharp, Roberts and Co. (the\r\npredecessors of Sharp, Stewart and Co., Limited), in the year 1833,\r\nturned his attention to locomotive construction. His initial effort was\r\nof a somewhat novel kind. Four locomotives of his first design were\r\nconstructed, one—“Experiment”—for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\r\nand the others for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. The cylinders,\r\nwhich were 11in. diameter, were placed in a vertical position on the\r\nframes, just at the point were the boiler entered the smoke-box. By\r\nmeans of cross-heads and side-links the motion was conveyed to a\r\nbell-crank, and so transmitted by a connecting-rod to the driving\r\nwheels. There was, of course, a similar arrangement of cylinder,\r\ncrank, etc., on both sides of the engine. The stroke was 16in. The\r\ndriving wheels, 5ft. in diameter, were placed in front of the fire-box,\r\nand had inside bearings; the leading wheels were located below the\r\nvertical cylinders, and had outside bearings. The pump was placed in\r\na horizontal position above the frame over the driving wheels, and was\r\nworked by a rod actuated by the vertical member of the bell-crank.\r\n\r\nThe “Experiment” (Fig. 24) was unsuccessful, and was rebuilt, when a\r\nthird pair of wheels was added, and the position of the cylinders,\r\nbell-crank, etc., altered. The valves were, also of a novel kind,\r\npatented by Mr. Roberts in 1832. Colburn thus describes them: “The\r\nvalve, of wrought-iron, was formed of two concentric tubes or pipes,\r\nthe larger pipe having holes perforated to admit steam from the\r\nsteam-pipe into the annular space. This annular space was closed\r\nsteam-tight at each end of the valve, and steam could only escape\r\nfrom it alternately to each end of the cylinder through the slots.\r\nThe exhaust steam passed from one end of the cylinder directly into\r\nthe waste pipe, and from the other end it traversed the interior of\r\nthe pipe of the cylindrical valve. These valves did not work well, as\r\nthey did not expand equally with their cast-iron casings when heated\r\nby steam. For this reason the cylinder valves were soon abandoned. It\r\nshould be mentioned that, in Mr. Roberts’ first engines, the valve for\r\neach cylinder was worked with a motion derived from the opposite side\r\nof the engine. No eccentrics were employed, the requisite motion being\r\ntaken from a pin near the fulcrum of each bell-crank, and transmitted\r\nthence through suitable gearing to the valve attached to the cylinder\r\non the opposite side of the engine.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—ROBERTS’S “EXPERIMENT,” WITH VERTICAL\r\nCYLINDERS, BELL-CRANK, CONNECTING-ROD, AND CYLINDER VALVES]\r\n\r\nThe engines used on the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, constructed in\r\n1833, partook somewhat of the character of Roberts’s “Experiment,”\r\ninasmuch that right-angled cranks and vertical cylinders were\r\nemployed, the diameter of the latter being 11in., and stroke 18in.\r\nThese engines were named “Earl of Airlie” and “Lord Wharncliffe,” and\r\nwere constructed by J. and C. Carmichael, of Dundee. Both these engines\r\nwere delivered at the end of September, 1833. The “single” driving\r\nwheels were placed in the leading position, the axle being just behind\r\nthe smoke-box. The cylinders were placed on the side frames, about\r\nmidway between the two ends.\r\n\r\nThe piston-rods worked upwards, and the motion was conveyed by means\r\nof rods from the piston cross-heads. These connecting-rods passed down\r\noutside the pistons, and were connected to one end of the bell-cranks,\r\nwhich were fixed beyond the cylinders, with the pivots over the centre\r\nof the second pair of wheels. From the lower ends of the bell-cranks\r\nthe driving-rods were pivoted, the other ends being connected to the\r\noutside cranks of the driving wheels. The fire-box end of the engines\r\nwas supported on a four-wheel truck or bogie. These engines weighed 9½\r\ntons each, and cost £700 each. An ordinary four-wheel wagon, fitted\r\nwith a water-butt, was used for a tender.\r\n\r\nAn engine of similar design was ordered from Stirling and Co., of the\r\nEast Foundry, Dundee, and delivered on March 3rd, 1834.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Sturrock, the first manager of Swindon Works, and afterwards\r\nlocomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway, helped to\r\nconstruct this engine, which was named “Trotter.” Mr. Sturrock was at\r\nthe time an apprentice at the East Foundry.\r\n\r\nThe gauge of the Dundee and Newtyle Railway was only 4ft. 6in., but\r\nwhen the line was taken over by the Dundee and Perth Railway the gauge\r\nwas altered to the normal gauge of Great Britain. The original engine,\r\n“Earl of Airlie,” after some alteration, of course, could not run on\r\nthe railway, but for some years after the change the “Earl of Airlie”\r\nwas employed as a stationary pumping engine.\r\n\r\nStephenson’s four-wheel passenger engines with a short wheel base were\r\nfound to be very unsteady at the very moderate speeds then attained,\r\nand he, therefore, added a pair of trailing wheels, thus constructing\r\na six-wheel “single” passenger engine. Stephenson considered that\r\nthe moderate wheel base of these small engines with six wheels\r\nwould, on the easy curves of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\r\noffer considerable resistance, so he took out a patent, in which he\r\nprovided that the middle or driving pair of wheels should be without\r\nflanges (or flanchès, as they were then called). He claimed that by\r\nthis modification the six-wheel passenger engine would pass round\r\ncurves with much less strain and greater safety. The first engine so\r\nconstructed by Stephenson he designated the “Patentee,” and she was\r\ndelivered to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in January, 1834. She\r\nhad outside frames, inside cylinders, 18in. stroke, 12in. diameter; the\r\ndriving wheels were 5ft. diameter.\r\n\r\nGeorge Forrester and Co., Vauxhall Foundry, Liverpool, in 1834\r\nconstructed a six-wheel engine named “Swiftsure.” This locomotive\r\npossessed many novel features. It had outside horizontal cylinders;\r\nthe frames were also outside, thus making the cylinders a considerable\r\ndistance apart. The connecting-rods were keyed on cranks, at some\r\ndistance outside the frames, whilst the fact that the driving wheels\r\nwere not counterbalanced caused the engines of this class to be most\r\nunsteady at even moderate speeds, and they were soon known by the\r\nsobriquet of “Boxers.” Colburn says: “A few pounds of iron properly\r\ndisposed in the rims of the driving wheels would have redeemed the\r\nreputation of these engines.” The arrangement of cylinders and frames\r\nallowed the leading wheels to be placed well forward, the total length\r\nof the frames of the “Swiftsure” being 17ft. The driving wheels were\r\n5ft. diameter, and the cylinders 11in.; the stroke was 18in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—HAWTHORN’S “COMET,” THE FIRST ENGINE OF THE\r\nNEWCASTLE AND CARLISLE RAILWAY, 1835]\r\n\r\nIn the “Boxer” Forrester employed his patent valve gear, with vertical\r\ngab ends and four eccentrics.\r\n\r\nA portion of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was opened March 9th,\r\n1835, and R. and W. Hawthorn constructed the first engines for that\r\nrailway. No. 1 was the “Comet,” (Fig. 25), a four-wheel (coupled)\r\nlocomotive; the cylinders (12in. diameter, 16in. stroke) were placed\r\nbelow the smoke-box, the connecting-rods passing under the leading\r\naxle. The wheels were 4ft. diameter. Hawthorn’s valve gear was used in\r\nthe engines of this class, which was actuated by four fixed eccentrics.\r\nThe “Comet” continued to work on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway for\r\na number of years, and was afterwards used as a stationary engine for\r\ndriving the steam saws at the Forth Bank Engine Works, Newcastle. She\r\nwas so engaged up to and subsequently to 1863.\r\n\r\nAbout 1836 short-stroke locomotives came into favour, and Tayleur\r\nand Co. built ten for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Although\r\nthe cylinders were 14in. diameter, the stroke was only 12in. We need\r\nscarcely add the experiment was not successful, although some of the\r\noriginal broad-gauge engines were built with short strokes. These will,\r\nhowever, be dealt with fully later on.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 R. Stephenson and Co. constructed the “Harvey Combe”\r\nlocomotive. She was a ballast engine, and was engaged in the\r\nconstruction of the London and Birmingham Railway. R. Stephenson had\r\na minute description of this engine written by W. P. Marshall, and\r\nthe work in question is stated to be “the most perspicuous and the\r\nillustrations of the most elaborate kind of any work describing a\r\nlocomotive.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that at once strikes the intelligent reader as peculiar is\r\nthat, although the “Harvey Combe” was designed “for conveying the\r\nearth excavated in the construction of a line of railway,” as Marshall\r\n“perspicuously” puts it (but which we should shortly describe as a\r\n“ballast” engine), she is a “single” engine! and, therefore, is not\r\nmuch like a modern six-coupled ballast engine. She cost £1,400, and was\r\nof 50 horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of the “Harvey Combe” were: Cylinders, 12in.\r\nby 18in.; driving wheels, 5ft., and leading and trailing 3ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter; 102 tubes, 1⅝in. internal diameter; total heating surface,\r\n480ft.; weight, empty, 10 tons; with fuel and water, 11 tons 18 cwt.\r\nNo flanges were provided to the driving wheels. Although the “Harvey\r\nCombe” was built for, and had rough usage as, a ballast engine, yet,\r\nwhen at the end of 1837 Nicholas Wood was making experiments for\r\nthe purposes of his report to the Great Western Railway as to the\r\nbroad-gauge, the “Harvey Combe” was the principal narrow-gauge engine\r\nwith which he experimented. With a gross load (including engine,\r\netc.) of 81 tons, she attained a speed of 25 to 53 miles an hour, and\r\nconsumed 0.47lb. of coke per ton per mile. With a gross load of 50 tons\r\nthe speed reached was only 32.88 miles an hour, with the above coal\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Hackworth built a locomotive of novel construction—viz., with\r\ndouble-acting ram or trunk engines, by means of which piston-rods were\r\ndispensed with, the connecting-rods being pivoted directly on to the\r\npiston and oscillated within the trunk.\r\n\r\nThis was the first locomotive engine ever seen in Russia. She commenced\r\nwork on the Zarskoe-Selo Railway on November 18th, 1836, a religious\r\nservice being held and the locomotive consecrated before the first\r\ntrain was run. Of this engine the Russian Emperor remarked in English,\r\n“It is the finest I ever saw.” An old officer of the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway, informs the writer that a locomotive on the\r\ndouble-acting trunk principle was also built by Hackworth for that\r\nline, and so far as his memory serves him, he believes it was the\r\n“Arrow” passenger engine. The “Arrow” had leading and trailing wheels\r\n3ft. 6in. diameter; driving wheels, 5ft. 6in. diameter; 135 tubes in\r\nthe boiler of 1¾in. diameter; cylinders, 20in. in diameter, and with a\r\nstroke of only 9in.!\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the first engine (the “Comet”) supplied to\r\nthe Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, but several of the other early\r\nlocomotives used on that line were powerful ones, and their design\r\nin advance of the generality of locomotives then in use. Thus, the\r\n“Goliath,” one of the first engines supplied to the line by Hawthorn,\r\nin March, 1837, hauled a train consisting of 63 wagons of coal,\r\nweighing 267 tons, 12 miles in less than 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe “Goliath” had six-coupled wheels 4ft. diameter, cylinders 14in.\r\ndiameter, 18in. stroke. Total heating surface 550.91 sq. ft. Weight,\r\nempty, 11¾ tons; in working order, 13 tons. The “Atlas,” built by R.\r\nStephenson and Co. in 1836, drew a train of 100 wagons, loaded with\r\ncoal, coke, and lime, and weighing 450 tons, 10¾ miles in 45 minutes,\r\nbut this was on a falling gradient, varying from 1 in 215 to 1 in 106.\r\nThis locomotive was also six-coupled, the wheels being 4ft. diameter;\r\ncylinders, 14in. by 18in. stroke; heating surface, 553.77 sq. ft.,\r\nweighing 10 tons 6 cwt. empty, and 11 tons 6¾ cwt. in working trim.\r\nAnother small locomotive on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, named\r\n“Tyne,” built by Hawthorn, is worthy of notice, for the reason that\r\nthe first steam organ was fitted to the engine. This was the invention\r\nof the Rev. James Birket, of Ovingham. It was fixed on the top of the\r\nfire-box, and was thus described: “The organ consists of eight pipes,\r\ntuned to compass an octave, but without any intervening tones or\r\nsemi-tones. This is the first attempt to adapt a musical instrument to\r\nthe steam engine capable of producing a tune, and though not so perfect\r\nas to admit of all the pleasing variety and combination of sound\r\ncapable of being produced by the instrument to which we have compared\r\nit, there is no doubt but very considerable improvements will be made\r\nin this steam musical instrument by the inventor, who is a skilful\r\nmusician as well as an ingenious mechanic.”\r\n\r\nThe “Tyne” had cylinders 13½in. by 16in. stroke, and four wheels, 4ft.\r\n6in. diameter; she weighed only 9½ tons. After working for many years,\r\na pair of trailing wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter was added, thus making her\r\na six-wheel engine, with the leading and driving wheels coupled. She\r\ncontinued to work on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway till the end of\r\n1857, when she was sold, but even at that time the “Tyne” was in good\r\nworking order. Three other old locomotives were sold at the time—viz.,\r\n“Eden,” “Meteor,” and “Lightning.”\r\n\r\nThe “Eden” was built by R. Stephenson and Co. in 1836, and had\r\nfour-coupled wheels of 4ft. 6in. diameter, and a third pair 3ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter; cylinders, 14in. by 15in. stroke, afterwards increased to\r\n16in. stroke. Weight, empty, 10 tons, 6 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe “Meteor” was built by Bury and Co., of Liverpool, and had only\r\nfour wheels of 4ft. diameter; cylinders, 12in. diameter. The stroke at\r\nfirst was 15in., but afterwards was made 16in. Steam pressure, 55lb.\r\nShe was provided with hand-gear, the slide-valves working into the\r\nfront of the steam chest by means of weight bars located between the\r\nfront buffer beam and the smoke-box end. The piston connecting-rods,\r\nof course, actuated the rear axle, but the eccentric sheaves were upon\r\nthe leading axle, so that if the crank pins upon which the side-rods\r\nworked went a bit loose, the side-rods had to be disconnected, and the\r\nvalves worked by the gear handles. This was rather hard work for the\r\ndriver and fireman, who, upon such occasions, took it in turns to thus\r\nwork the valve gear. This Bury locomotive opened the line from Blaydon\r\nto Newcastle on Sunday, October 31st, 1839. The man who was fireman on\r\nthis engine at that time thus relates his experiences:—“The ‘Meteor’\r\nengine was sent to Redheugh Station to work the passenger trains\r\nbetween that station and Blaydon, also coal trains and other things,\r\nwith this tiny engine of about eleven tons all told. We formed the\r\nconnection at Blaydon with all trains to and from the west. For this\r\nnew arrangement of running I was to be called out of bed by a watchman\r\nclose after two o’clock each morning, to gather up my fire-bars, put\r\nthem into the box, and get a fire as best I could as usual, and have\r\nsteam ready by 5 a.m. to take our first train from Gateshead to Blaydon\r\nat 5.20 a.m. I had also to clean most of the little engine, the driver\r\ndoing part. I had to clean up the shed, take all ashes out, coke the\r\ntender, etc. To turn the engine the tender had to be taken off, and\r\npushed on one side to get past it, and reunited as often as we made a\r\nshort trip. There is nothing like it in the divorce court. For this\r\nwork my pay was 2s. 8d. per day, commencing at 5 a.m., when my driver\r\nmade his appearance, little overtime being allowed, and we did well to\r\nfinish by 8.45 p.m. I worked about 18½ hours daily, with one exception,\r\nweekly, and on this particular time we had our boiler to clean out, and\r\nhad to fill by hand buckets—this after our train work was finished.\r\nWater being a little scarce in the shed, it was frequently necessary\r\nto haul out of the river Tyne and carry to the shed, and pour into\r\nthe boiler by the safety valve or man-hole by the driver, the fireman\r\nhaving the honour of carrying it from the river quay.\r\n\r\n“This work took so much labour and time that our only rest on that\r\nparticular night and morning was upon the soft side of a plank while\r\nthe steam was rising in the engine boiler, to leave for Blaydon at\r\n5.20 a.m. with our usual first train. Then we were again at work until\r\n8.45 p.m. There was not a guard for our passenger train, so I had the\r\nclosing of the carriage doors, etc., to attend to, to fill up my spare\r\ntime, and to keep myself awake. We had to load coals during part of\r\nthe day from Wylam, etc., to Dunston, so that there was not much fear\r\nof falling asleep. I was coupler and guard for this work. When not\r\notherwise engaged I had my cleaning to attend to, and tubes to keep\r\nclean daily, so I was really never committed for going to sleep during\r\nworking hours. I was at this work over the winter almost the whole of\r\n1839-40, when early one morning I had a fall from the boiler top in\r\nthe shed, and came down the wrong end first. I injured one shoulder\r\nvery much, which laid me off work one month. I kept at work all the\r\nday after falling, but only one arm was of any use to me, and I was\r\ncompelled to give up.\r\n\r\n“A bone-setter in North Shields had to do the needful for me, as they\r\nhave often had to do for others before and afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThe “Lightning” was an engine with dimensions similar to those of the\r\n“Eden,” previously described.\r\n\r\nLongridge and Co., of Bedlington, supplied the Stanhope and Tyne\r\nRailway in 1837 with a very powerful locomotive named the “Michael\r\nLongridge.” She had six-coupled wheels, 4ft. diameter; cylinders, 14in.\r\ndiameter; and a stroke of 18in.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Junction Railway was opened in July, 1837, and R. Stephenson\r\nand Co. (together with other builders), supplied the original\r\nlocomotives. Stephenson’s engines at this time had become a little more\r\ndependable, for we find it chronicled that three of them which had run\r\nuninterruptedly since they were first employed had, between July 8th\r\nand September 30th, 1837, accomplished the following distances—viz.:\r\nthe “Wildfire,” 11,865 miles; “Shark,” 10,018 miles; and “Scorpion,”\r\n11,137 miles; and, moreover, they were then still running in perfect\r\nworking condition. They were six-wheel locomotives, with leading and\r\ntrailing wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter, driving, 5ft. diameter; cylinders,\r\n12½in. by 18in. stroke; weighing in working order 9 tons 12 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—“SUNBEAM,” BUILT BY HAWTHORN FOR THE STOCKTON\r\nAND DARLINGTON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIn 1837, No. 43, of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the “Sunbeam”\r\n(Fig. 26) was turned out by Hawthorn. It was a “single” engine, having\r\ndriving wheels 5ft. in diameter, and cylinders 12in. in diameter, with\r\n18in. stroke. The “Sunbeam” worked well for 19 years, and in 1863 was\r\nreported as being “still in good working order, but too small for the\r\npresent heavy traffic”. The boiler of the ”Sunbeam” was 8ft. long by\r\n3ft. 2in. in diameter, and contained 104 copper tubes. The “Dart,” No.\r\n41, was built by Hackworth in 1840, at Shildon, and was a four-wheeled\r\nengine, the wheels being 4ft. 6in. in diameter. The boiler, containing\r\n122 tubes, was 8ft. 2in. long and 3ft 3in. in diameter. The fire-box\r\nwas 4ft. high, 3ft. 10in. long, and 3ft. wide. The boiler pressure was\r\n100lb., and the heating surface of the engine 602 square feet; the\r\ncylinders were 14in. in diameter, and the stroke 16in. The extreme\r\nlength of the engine and tender was 35ft. 3in., and the regular speed\r\nattained is said to have been thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    An important epoch in locomotive history.—The first\r\n        broad-gauge engines.—Absurd incorrect statements regarding\r\n        these locomotives.—The facts concerning same; extracts from\r\n        directors’ report.—Brunel and the engine builders.—The\r\n        delivery of the first engines to the Great Western\r\n        Railway.—Further extract from the directors’ report.—Daniel\r\n        Gooch appears on the scene.—Trial of the broad-gauge\r\n        engines.—Table of the original Great Western engine.—The\r\n        “Vulcan”— “Æolus”—“Bacchus”—“Venus”—“Apollo”—“Mars” and\r\n        “Ajax,” 10ft.-wheel engines.—The builders’ account of one\r\n        of these giants.—“Ajax,” a sister engine.— 10ft. disc\r\n        wheels.—Dr. Lardner.—The “boat” engines. —T.

Readers are probably aware that very much has been\r\nwritten on the subject of the early Great Western Railway locomotives\r\nduring the past few years, and a surprising lack of knowledge of the\r\nsubject has been exhibited by people taking part in discussions that\r\nhave arisen. The facts are clearly established, so that it would be\r\nwaste of time to recapitulate the many inaccurate statements that have\r\nbeen made relative to the original broad-gauge locomotives. Thus we\r\nread that “the first portion of the Great Western Railway was opened\r\nin 1837,” also that “Mr. Brunel designed the ‘Hurricane.’” These\r\nstatements are, of course, utterly at variance with the facts, but they\r\nprepare one for yet more extraordinary statements on the same subject,\r\nsuch as “the directors of the Great Western Railway having appointed\r\nMr. (afterwards Sir Daniel) Gooch as locomotive superintendent, the\r\nduty devolved upon him to design and provide the necessary engines.\r\nMr. Gooch, having inspected all the locomotives on other railways,\r\nconsidered that 5ft. 6in. wheels were far too small; he therefore\r\ndesigned the engines for the Great Western with driving wheels of 6ft.,\r\n7ft., and 8ft. diameter, and placed orders for their construction with\r\nthe leading builders of that time.”\r\n\r\nTo commence with, therefore, it will be as well to give the exact\r\nparticulars as to the ordering and delivery of the original broad-gauge\r\nlocomotives, for the opening of the first portion of the Great Western\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nThe facts as given in the directors’ reports to the shareholders,\r\nstated at the meetings of the shareholders, or mentioned in the various\r\nreports of Brunel, Wood, and Hawkshaw, are as follows:—The first\r\nlocomotive engines were ordered prior to August, 1836. The directors\r\nin their report of that date thus mentioned them:—“Difficulties and\r\nobjections were at first supposed by some persons to exist in the\r\nconstruction of engines for this increased width of rails, but the\r\ndirectors have pleasure in stating that several of the most experienced\r\nlocomotive engine manufacturers in the North have undertaken to\r\nconstruct these, and several are now contracted for, adapted to the\r\npeculiar track and dimensions of this railway, calculated for a minimum\r\nvelocity of thirty miles an hour.”\r\n\r\nInstead of the builders having personal interviews to obtain orders\r\nfor engines, as has been recently stated, it appears from Brunel’s\r\nreport of August, 1838, that he “left the form of construction and\r\nthe proportions entirely to the manufacturers, stipulating merely\r\nthat they should submit detailed drawings to me for my approval. This\r\nwas the substance of my circular, which, with your sanction, was\r\nsent to several of the most experienced manufacturers. Most of these\r\nmanufacturers, of their own accord, and without previous communication\r\nwith me, adopted the large wheels as a necessary consequence of the\r\nspeed required. As it has been supposed that the manufacturers may have\r\nbeen compelled or induced by me to adopt certain modes of construction,\r\nor certain dimensions in other parts, by a specification—a practice\r\nwhich has been adopted on some lines—and that these restrictions may\r\nhave embarrassed them, I should wish to take this opportunity to state\r\ndistinctly that such is not the case.”\r\n\r\nThen, as to the delivery of the engines, from the directors’ report it\r\nis clear that on August 12th, 1838, eleven locomotives were actually\r\non the line. According to a statement drawn up by Mr. C. A. Saunders,\r\nthe superintendent of the Great Western Railway, for the purposes\r\nof Mr. N. Wood’s report, the following engines were then in use on\r\nthe railway:—“North Star,” “Æolus,” “Venus,” “Neptune,” “Apollo,”\r\n“Premier,” and “Lion.” This leaves four engines to be accounted for.\r\nSir Daniel Gooch states that the six engines built by the Vulcan\r\nFoundry Company could be depended upon. We can, therefore, take it for\r\ngranted that the “Vulcan” and “Bacchus” were two of the four, whilst\r\nthe geared “Thunderer” was delivered before April 26th, 1838, and the\r\n“Ariel” before June 1st, 1838.\r\n\r\nThe directors stated that the railway company had only accepted eight\r\nof these engines, and the three others required alterations before the\r\nengineer would accept them.\r\n\r\nThis report continues with the following significant paragraph:—“The\r\ndirectors are under the necessity of declining to receive two engines\r\nmade for them, in consequence of a material variation in the plan of\r\nthem since it was submitted to and approved by their engineer.” These\r\ntwo engines may be the “Ajax” and her sister 10ft. wheel engine, the\r\n“Mars,” constructed by Mather, Dixon and Co., or the two geared engines\r\nbuilt by the Haigh Foundry Company; although it is probable that\r\nthe two latter engines had not been delivered at this date. Besides\r\nthe eleven engines already on the line, and the two refused by the\r\nengineer, the directors stated that nineteen others were then in course\r\nof construction, making a total of thirty engines. Of the seven engines\r\nmentioned as being in use on the line, according to Mr. Brunel, only\r\nfour were really used for the passenger service, the fifth being kept\r\nwith steam up to take the place of one of the other four in case of a\r\nbreakdown, and the other two were used for conveying ballast, etc.,\r\nfor the construction of the line. According to Hawkshaw’s report,\r\ndated October 4th, 1838, fourteen engines had at that time been\r\ndelivered to the Great Western Railway, and seven more were approaching\r\ncompletion, the nine remaining to complete the thirty not having then\r\nbeen put in hand. Mr. Daniel Gooch commenced his duties as locomotive\r\nsuperintendent of the Great Western Railway on August 18th, 1837.\r\nAt this period the following engines had been ordered for the Great\r\nWestern Railway:—Six from the Vulcan Foundry, where Gooch had served\r\nunder Stephenson; four from Mather, Dixon and Co., Liverpool; two from\r\nHawthorn and Co., Newcastle; two from the Haigh Foundry Company, and,\r\ncuriously, two from R. Stephenson and Co.\r\n\r\nMr. Gooch states in his “diaries” that these two engines were\r\nconstructed for a Russian railway with a 6ft. gauge, and that\r\nhe himself prepared the working drawings from which they were\r\nconstructed. There, however, appears to be some doubt as to whether\r\nit was a Russian or American railway for which the two locomotives in\r\nquestion were originally built. When ready for delivery the purchase\r\nmoney was not forthcoming, so the careful firm of R. Stephenson\r\nand Co. did not part with the “North Star” and her sister engine.\r\nThey afterwards widened the frames, fitted longer axles to the two\r\nlocomotives, and then sold them to the Great Western Railway as 7ft.\r\ngauge engines.\r\n\r\nThe “Vulcan,” built by the Vulcan Foundry Company, was the first engine\r\ndelivered to the Great Western Railway. One of Mather and Dixon’s\r\n10ft. wheel engines arrived a few days after, having been sent by sea\r\nfrom Liverpool to Bristol in December, 1837, and forwarded by canal\r\nfrom Bristol to West Drayton. A preliminary trial of these two engines\r\nwas made on Wednesday, January 18th, 1838, and the following extract\r\ndetails the working of the two locomotives on this occasion:—“A full\r\ntrial was made during the whole of Wednesday in running the engines on\r\ntwo or three miles of the line near West Drayton, between London and\r\nMaidenhead. The object of the trial was to prove the rails, and most\r\nsatisfactory was the result, both as to the increased width of gauge\r\nand the use of continuous bearers of kyanised wood confined by piles,\r\non which plan the line is constructed. An engine with 8ft. drawing\r\nwheels, made by Messrs. Tayleur and Co., Warrington, weight 23 tons,\r\nwith the tender, water, coke, etc., and another engine made by Messrs.\r\nMather, Dixon and Co., weight about 19 tons, with the tender, etc., ran\r\nthe whole day without producing the slightest vibration either in the\r\nrails or the wood under them. The rails are, in fact, so beautifully\r\nfirm, smooth, and true, that the engines glided over them more like a\r\nshuttle through a loom or an arrow out of a bow than like the effect\r\non any previous railway. There is literally no noise—no apparent\r\neffort—nor can there ever be discovered any difference between the\r\ncentre and the joint in the rails. A maximum speed was not attempted,\r\nas on so short a piece the momentum would be no sooner attained than it\r\nwould require to be lowered, in preparation for stopping the engine. A\r\nspeed of forty-five to fifty miles an hour was attained, and when the\r\nengines are run, as they will be, either next or the following week, on\r\nan eight or ten-mile length, there is no doubt they will as easily run\r\nat a very much greater speed.”\r\n\r\nThe following table gives particulars of the original locomotives as\r\nsupplied to the Great Western Railway. These engines were ordered by\r\nBrunel before Sir D. Gooch was appointed Locomotive Superintendent;\r\nthe first duty of the latter was to inspect these locomotives, then\r\nin course of construction, and he was not at all pleased with their\r\ndimensions:—\r\n\r\n    ---------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-----+------------------\r\n             |          |        |        |       |     | Heating Surface.\r\n             |          |Diameter|        |       |     +-----+------+-----\r\n    Builder. |  Name of |   of   |Diameter|Stroke.|Grate|Tubes| Fire-|Total\r\n             |  Engine. |Driving |   of   |       |area.|     |  box.|\r\n             |          |Wheels. |Cylinder|       |     |     |      |\r\n    ---------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n             |          |feet.   | inches.|inches.|feet.| sq. |  sq. | sq.\r\n             |          |        |        |       |     | ft. |  ft. | ft.\r\n    ---------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n             |Vulcan    | 8      |   14   | 16    | 9.58| 534 | 35.0 |589!\r\n             |Æolus     | 8      |   14   | 16    |     | 530 | 57.15|587!\r\n     Vulcan  |Bacchus   | 8      |   14   | 16    |     | 530 | 57.15|587!\r\n    Foundry  |Venus     | 8      |   12   | 16    |     | 458 | 52.35|510†\r\n      Co.    |Neptune   | 8      |   12   | 16    |     | 458 | 52.35|510†\r\n             |Apollo    | 8      |   12   | 16    |     | 458 | 52.35|510†\r\n    ---------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n     Mather, |Mars      |10@     |   14   | 10 or |10.22| 417 | 57.3 |474‡\r\n     Dixon   |Ajax      |10      |   14   | 11    |10.22| 417 | 57.3 |474‡\r\n      & Co.  |Premier   | 7      |   14   | 14    |     | 326 | 51.71|377§\r\n             |Ariel     | 7      |   14   | 14    |     | 326 | 51.71|377§\r\n    ---------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n    R.

Wood, Whishaw, C. A. Saunders, Z. Colburn, and other\r\n        reliable authorities all state that these three engines had\r\n        cylinders 12 inches in diameter.\r\n     ‡—J. Locke in his evidence before the Gauge Commissioners in 1846\r\n        stated that the stroke of these engines was only 10 or 11 inches.\r\n     §—It will be noted that these two engines, also built by Mather,\r\n        Dixon and Co., had very short strokes.\r\n     ¶—Stroke was afterwards increased to 18 inches.\r\n     ◊◊—These engines were geared, so that the driving wheels were\r\n         equal to 12 feet diameter.\r\n     %—The engines and boilers were on separate carriages.\r\n        The “Thunderer” was geared up 3 to 1.\r\n     @—Although the “Mars” was built with 10ft. driving wheels, it is\r\n        probable that the size was reduced after her trial trips on the\r\n        G.W.R. After running 10,000 miles the G.W.R. Co. sold the “Mars.”\r\n     #—It is not certain that the “Viper” and “Snake” were the geared\r\n        engines built by the Haigh Foundry Co., but they are generally\r\n        accepted as such.\r\n\r\nThe “Vulcan,” it would seem, was a conspicuous failure. The Great\r\nWestern Railway officials did not consider her good enough to be used\r\nin the experiments made during the autumn of 1838 for the purpose of\r\nNicholas Wood’s report to the Great Western Railway in connection with\r\nthe gauge controversy. Whishaw only gives an account of one trip to\r\nWest Drayton and back with the “Vulcan.” This was made on the 12th of\r\nAugust, 1839, when, with a load of 18 tons, she attained a speed of 50\r\nmiles an hour on a falling gradient, the average speed for the trip\r\nof 13 miles being 28.32 miles an hour. On the return trip, with a load\r\nof only 14½ tons, the average speed was only 21 miles an hour. The\r\n“Vulcan” was afterwards converted into a tank engine, and worked the\r\ntraffic on a branch line for a few years.\r\n\r\nThe “Æolus” appears to have been a somewhat better engine than her\r\nsister (although, by the way, Sir D. Gooch states that, excluding the\r\n“North Star,” the engines from the Vulcan Foundry were the only ones\r\nhe could depend upon). N. Wood, in his tables, states that “Æolus” was\r\ncapable of hauling 32 tons at fifty miles an hour, with a consumption\r\nof 0.76lb. of coke per ton per mile, the water evaporated in an hour\r\nbeing 115.3 cubic feet. The greatest load drawn by “Æolus” during N.\r\nWood’s experiments was 104 tons, the speed attained being 23 miles an\r\nhour, and the consumption of coke .30lb. per ton per mile. Whishaw\r\ndetails four experiments with this engine, the most successful being\r\non November 6th, 1838, when with a load of about 20 tons she attained\r\nan average speed of 31.39 miles an hour; the maximum on this occasion\r\nbeing 48 miles an hour. Whishaw’s remarks concerning another journey\r\nare worth repeating. It was on July 21st, 1838, when “Æolus” took a\r\ntrain consisting of three first-class carriages, two open and one\r\nclosed second-class carriages, and two stage coaches on trucks, or a\r\nload of 96,164lb., or about 43 tons, and essayed a trip to Maidenhead;\r\nbut “after about two and a half miles the train was suddenly stopped,\r\nand remained _in statu quo_ for 21¾ minutes. In the meantime, ‘Æolus’\r\nmoved slowly away to recover her strength, and having sufficiently\r\nexercised herself, returned after a lapse of 21¾ minutes to lead the\r\ntrain forward”; but the engine did not appear to have quite recovered\r\nher strength by this exercise (!) for she had to stop at Slough,\r\nwhere she took water. This journey took 150 minutes to complete;\r\nbut, deducting the 34 minutes spent in four stoppages, the average\r\ntravelling rate was 11.71 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOn January 11th, 1840, the “Æolus” is stated to have made a remarkable\r\ntrip. At this time certain Chartists were being tried at Monmouth, and\r\nthe _Dispatch_, a Democratic Sunday paper, published detailed reports\r\nof the trial. Special messengers were despatched by road from Monmouth\r\nto Maidenhead, where an engine (the “Æolus”) was engaged to carry\r\nthe messengers to London. She is said to have covered the first ten\r\nmiles in seven minutes, or at the rate of 85 miles an hour. Here the\r\npreceding train was overtaken, and the whole journey of 31 miles was\r\ncompleted in about twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nWhishaw records a trip with “Bacchus” on December 13th, 1839, when,\r\nwith a train of two second and one first-class (four-wheel) carriages,\r\nshe covered 13 miles at an average speed of 29 miles an hour, the\r\nhighest speed attained on the trip being 44.11 miles an hour. On\r\nJanuary 9th, 1840, Whishaw made a trip to West Drayton and back with\r\nthe “Bacchus.” On the down journey, with a load of three coaches, 50\r\nmiles an hour was attained. On the up trip a similar maximum speed was\r\nattained three times, twice for a distance of a quarter-mile, and once\r\nfor a half-mile.\r\n\r\nWith “Venus” Whishaw records one experiment with a load of 25½ tons,\r\nmade up of one open second-class, one first-class carriage, and two\r\nstage coaches on trucks. The average speed was 21 miles an hour, the\r\nhighest being 48 miles an hour. The “Venus” was not much used during\r\nthe first four months following the first opening of the Great Western\r\nRailway, her total mileage during that period being only 240 miles. Mr.\r\nGooch found this engine was so extremely unsteady that he did not make\r\nuse of her, save when no other engine was conveniently available—hence\r\nher small mileage. The “Venus” was afterwards rebuilt as a tank engine,\r\nand her driving wheels reduced to 6ft. in diameter. When so rebuilt she\r\nworked the Tiverton branch traffic for some years.\r\n\r\nThe “Apollo” drew the first up-train on the Great Western Railway,\r\nleaving Maidenhead for Paddington at 8 a.m. on June 4th, 1838; whilst\r\nthe next day, when leaving Maidenhead with the afternoon train of 13\r\ncarriages, she broke down, in consequence of a tube bursting, the train\r\nbeing delayed for some hours, and great excitement being caused in\r\nLondon consequent upon the exaggerated reports of the mishap.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the table of the original Great Western\r\nRailway locomotives we have given the diameter of the cylinders of\r\n“Venus,” “Neptune,” and “Apollo” as 12in., and we have also given\r\nthe names of several men (whose probity is unimpeachable) as our\r\nauthorities on the point. Nor is that all the weight of evidence in\r\nfavour of 12in. being the original diameter of the cylinders. N. Wood,\r\nin his report to the Great Western Railway directors, specially refers\r\nto the point, thus: “... The performance of engines, such as ‘Venus,’\r\n‘Neptune,’ and ‘Apollo,’ with 12in. cylinders.” This is in addition to\r\nthe statement contained in Wood’s Table, No. 3, where also he gives the\r\ndimensions as 12in. It is now, however, stated that the cylinders of\r\nthese engines were 14in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nWe now have to deal with the two locomotives with 10ft. driving wheels,\r\nconstructed by Mather, Dixon and Co. for the Great Western Railway.\r\n\r\nFortunately, one of the people who assisted in the construction of\r\nthese engines is still living, and in the _Engineer_ for January 3rd,\r\n1896, he gave a detailed account of the building of the locomotive,\r\nand also a drawing of the “Grasshopper” (a nickname for the “Ajax” or\r\n“Mars”), which is here reproduced:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—THE “GRASSHOPPER,” ONE OF THE TWO BROAD-GAUGE\r\nENGINES (“AJAX” AND “MARS”), WITH 10FT. DRIVING WHEELS, DISC PATTERN,\r\nBUILT FOR THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY BY MATHER, DIXON AND CO.]\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in question has favoured the writer with the following\r\nparticulars concerning this engine:—“The engine was designed by John\r\nGrantham, draughtsman at Mather, Dixon, and Co., North Foundry,\r\nLiverpool. The outside view resembled a steamer, the driving wheel\r\nsplashers like a paddle-box, and the handrail plates, brought to the\r\nbuffer planks, shaped like the stem of a vessel, and intended to\r\ntake the wind pressure off the front end of the engine. The great\r\ndiameter of the driving wheel shows that Brunel had something to say\r\nabout it—perhaps ordered it to be made twice the size of any other\r\nthen made. The staff employed in the works then were: John Grantham,\r\nprincipal of drawing office, afterwards partner; Robert Hughes,\r\nmanager of the marine department, afterwards of the Royal Arsenal,\r\nWoolwich, and inspector of steamships; Mr. Banks, locomotive foreman,\r\nwell known at Derby on the Midland Railway; Mr. Buddicomb, first\r\nlocomotive superintendent of the Grand Junction Railway, and of the\r\nlocomotive works at Rouen, France; Josiah Kirtley, first locomotive\r\nsuperintendent of the Midland Counties; George Harrison, first\r\nlocomotive superintendent Scottish Central, and manager at Brassey’s,\r\nBirkenhead; Mr. Potts, afterwards of the firm of Jones and Potts,\r\nNewton-in-the-Willows, locomotive builders, where the first solid\r\nlocomotive wheel was made by the wheelsmith Frost.”\r\n\r\n“All the above named were apprentices and journeymen with me in my time.\r\n\r\n“William Tait, of the firm of Tait and Mirlees, Scotland Street,\r\nGlasgow, was the erector of the 10ft. wheel locomotive; I worked as\r\nmate with him on the same engine. Tait was manager of Neilson’s Hyde\r\nPark Locomotive Works, Glasgow, in 1845, and his mate—John Wilson—was\r\nmanager from 1864 to 1884 under Mr. James Reid, sole owner of Neilson’s\r\nWorks. James Smith Scarf welded the 10ft. tyres. The crank axles were\r\nforged at the Mersey Forge, when Mr. Norris was manager, and turned by\r\nCharles Ackers. Ned Bursing turned the rims and tyres on a large lathe,\r\ndriven by the gearing of the boring mill. I remember, having worked on\r\nthe same lathe, that they had to cut a curved piece out of the shop\r\nwall for clearance.”\r\n\r\nThe “Ajax” and “Mars” (Fig. 27), the 10ft. wheel engines supplied\r\nby Mather, Dixon, and Co., had the driving wheels of peculiar\r\nconstruction. Instead of the usual spokes, the circumference and the\r\ncentres were connected by means of iron plates, bolted together in\r\nsegments, and slightly convex in form.\r\n\r\nThese disc wheels were constructed under a patent granted to Mr. B.\r\nHicks, of Bolton, in October, 1834. The primary object of Mr. Hicks’s\r\npatent was not, however, the disc wheels, but a three-cylinder engine,\r\nwith the cylinders placed vertically above the crank axle. Steam was\r\nonly to be admitted at the top of the piston, so that the force of\r\nthe steam was always pressing downwards; by this method Mr. Hicks\r\nexpected to considerably augment the adhesive properties of the engine.\r\nWe cannot discover that an engine with three such cylinders was ever\r\nconstructed, although the disc wheels were used in the “Mars,” “Ajax,”\r\nand other locomotives.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the illustration of the “Grasshopper,” these two\r\n10ft. wheel engines had a projecting front, and the splashers covering\r\nthe wheels above the frames were made to represent paddle-boxes of a\r\na steamboat. For these reasons, Dr. Lardner says, they were generally\r\nknown as the “boat engines,” and he goes on to remark that they\r\nwere found incapable of working the passenger trains (probably in\r\nconsequence of the time lost in starting and stopping the monsters),\r\nand were used to haul the ballast trains during the construction of\r\nthe Great Western Railway. Mr. Brunel gave the following evidence\r\nrelative to these 10ft. wheel engines before the Gauge Commissioners\r\nin 1845:—“Three engines were made for 10ft. The idea did not originate\r\nwith me, but it was proposed by certain manufacturers, and although I\r\nexpressed some fear of the feasibility of constructing 10ft. wheels,\r\nI thought it worth the trial. They were made, and it so happened that\r\nthe three engines to which they were applied totally failed in other\r\nrespects, and the whole engine was cast aside.... The engines to\r\nwhich I refer were a pair made in Liverpool by a maker there, who was\r\nalso making other engines for us. I take the whole responsibility, of\r\ncourse, of having allowed the 10ft. wheel to be made; but the engines,\r\nfrom other circumstances, were not successful, and the construction of\r\nthe wheels was one which we should certainly never again adopt. It was\r\nan entire plate, and that with such a diameter is heavy, and offers\r\nsuch an enormous surface to the side wind that it certainly would not\r\ndo to adopt it. In the other engine (‘Hurricane’), which was tried with\r\na 10ft. wheel, the wheel worked very well, but accidental circumstances\r\nthrew the engine out of use; the wheels got broken by an accident which\r\nwould have broken any wheels, and no further attempt was made to use\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMr. T. R. Crampton, the designer and patentee of the famous Crampton\r\nengines, gives the following particulars of the “Ajax”:—“Area of\r\nfire-grate, 10.22ft.; total heating surface, 474.0ft.; diameter of\r\ndriving wheels, 10ft.; diameter of cylinders, 14in.; length of stroke,\r\n20in.; surface in fire-box, 57.3ft.; cubic contents of both cylinders,\r\n7.09ft.; proportion of capacities to the wheel, 1: 1.41.”\r\n\r\nThe “Ariel” appears to have come into collision with the “Hurricane”\r\nat Bull’s Bridge (Hayes) on November 6th, 1838, whilst the “Lion”\r\nbroke down near the same spot at five o’clock on July 30th, and was\r\nunfortunate enough to run over and kill a man at Ealing on November\r\n6th, 1838.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight on March 3rd, 1839, the “Atlas” was hauling a ballast\r\ntrain of 25 wagons towards Paddington, and instead of stopping at the\r\nusual place, the train continued on into the engine house, colliding\r\nwith the “North Star,” and doing considerable damage to that renowned\r\nlocomotive; then, proceeding on its victorious career, it next charged\r\nthe wall of the engine house, and, finally, came to a stop. Upon\r\ninquiring into the cause of the accident it was discovered that both\r\nthe driver and stoker were asleep on the engine, and that the train had\r\nbeen running for some miles with no one in charge. Although there were\r\nfifty men on the wagons, none of them were seriously injured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—THE “HURRICANE,” A BROAD-GAUGE ENGINE WITH\r\n10ft. DRIVING WHEELS, BUILT ON HARRISON’S SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nGreat excitement was caused in London on the evening of October 26th,\r\n1838, by the report that Mr. Field (a partner in the firm of Maudslay\r\nand Field, the well-known engineers) had been run over and killed by\r\nthe “Hurricane” (Fig. 28), but this was not quite correct. The true\r\nfacts were as follows:—Dr. Lardner and his assistant, a youth of 19,\r\nnamed Field, were making experiments at Acton on the deflection of the\r\nrails, for the purpose of Wood’s report to the directors, and were\r\nusing the up line. The “Hurricane” was the engine employed, and this\r\nengine came down from Paddington on the up line for their use. Young\r\nField was stooping down to measure the amount of deflection as the\r\nengine passed, and just at the moment overbalanced himself in front of\r\nthe “Hurricane,” and, although it was only travelling at the rate of\r\nfive miles an hour, it could not be pulled up in the short space, and\r\nhe was, unfortunately, run over and killed.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1836, T. E. Harrison patented an arrangement for carrying\r\nthe boiler of the locomotive on one carriage and the machinery on\r\nanother, the idea being that when repairs were necessary to the\r\nboiler portion it could be disconnected from the machinery, and\r\nanother boiler carriage substituted, and _vice versâ_. Considering the\r\namount of repairs necessary to locomotives at this early period of\r\ntheir evolution, great economy was expected from the adoption of the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe “Thunderer” (Fig. 29) was constructed in 1837 by Hawthorn’s of\r\nNewcastle. The boiler portion of the machine was carried on six wheels,\r\nand viewed from its exterior, it appeared to be similar to an ordinary\r\nlocomotive. In front, at the chimney end, was the machinery carriage,\r\ncarried on four-coupled wheels of 6ft. diameter. The gearing being 3\r\nto 1, therefore, one revolution of the prime driving wheels caused\r\nthe travelling wheels to turn three times, thus making them equal to\r\ndriving wheels 18ft. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were horizontal, and the connecting-rods were attached\r\nto a double-cranked axle, on which was the cogged wheel; this worked\r\na pinion on the axle of the driving wheels. The axle of the driving\r\nwheels had a motion up and down, to allow for imperfections in the\r\nroad; and the cogged wheel and pinion were kept at the requisite\r\ndistance in gear by the supports of the cranked axle being fixed over\r\nand connected with those of the driving wheels, and thus moving in\r\nconjunction with them. Two eccentrics on the cogged wheel axle worked\r\nthe slides with the usual levers and hand-gear, and the exhaust steam\r\nfrom the cylinders was discharged into the chimney.\r\n\r\nThe two carriages were connected by a bar, and the steam pipes had a\r\nball-and-socket joint for lateral motion, with a metallic ring packing;\r\nthey also were composed of two parts which slid one within the other,\r\nallowing by this means a motion in the direction of their length. The\r\ntank was under the boiler, and the engine wheels were coupled, in order\r\nto have the whole weight for the purpose of obtaining adhesion. To keep\r\nthe teeth at the right pitch, and prevent backlash on reversing the\r\nmotion, the pinion was in two parts, one of which was movable round the\r\naxle, and by means of keys these might be set so as to place the two\r\nhalves of the teeth a little out of the right line, and thus tighten\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the boiler was 44in., that of the 135 tubes, 1⅝in.\r\n(internal); the tubes were 8ft. 7in. long. The fire-box was provided\r\nwith a mid-feather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—THE “THUNDERER,” A BROAD-GAUGE ENGINE BUILT ON\r\nHARRISON’S PLAN, WITH DRIVING WHEELS 6ft. DIAMETER, GEARED UP TO 18ft.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, January 18th, 1839, the “Thunderer” drew a heavy ordinary\r\ntrain from Maidenhead to Paddington in 32 minutes, including the time\r\noccupied in stopping at Slough.\r\n\r\nThe “Hurricane” was of the same general design and dimensions as the\r\n“Thunderer,” with, of course, the wide difference as to the mode of\r\nworking. The machinery vehicle of the “Hurricane” was supported on\r\nsix wheels, the leading and trailing being 4ft. 6in. diameter, whilst\r\nthe driving wheels were 10ft. in diameter, the piston-rod connections\r\nworking direct on the crank axle. The axle-boxes were above the frames,\r\nas was also the case with the two 10ft. wheel locomotives previously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn a so-called locomotive history what purports to be an illustration\r\nof the “Hurricane” is given; the wheels are there shown with direct\r\nradiating spokes. The spokes of both these curious locomotives were,\r\nhowever, of the V description, as shown in the illustrations (Figs. 28\r\nand 29), and in Colburn’s “Locomotive Engineering.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of September, 1839, when the 31 miles of the line was open\r\nto Twyford, the driver of the “Hurricane,” having obtained a promise\r\nfrom the directors that they would provide for his wife and family if\r\nan accident happened to him, undertook to drive the “Hurricane” to\r\nTwyford at the speed of 100 miles an hour; and, allowing three miles\r\nfor getting up speed and stopping, it is stated that he successfully\r\ncovered 28 miles at the rate of 100 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Grissell and Peto, the well-known railway contractors,\r\nundertook the task of removing the mammoth bronze equestrian statue\r\nof the Duke of Wellington from Mr. Wyatt’s studio in the Harrow Road,\r\nnear the Great Western Railway locomotive shops, to Hyde Park. The car\r\nweighed 20 tons, and was borne by four wheels 10ft. in diameter, lent\r\nby the Great Western Railway, one pair being open-spoked wheels from\r\nunder the “Hurricane,” the other pair being constructed of disc sheet\r\niron, and were from under the “Mars” or “Ajax.” Both pairs are clearly\r\nillustrated in the _Illustrated London News_ for October 10th, 1846.\r\n\r\nOf the original Great Western locomotives there now only remain to\r\nbe described the two geared engines supplied to the Great Western\r\nRailway by the Haigh Foundry Company. Unfortunately, little is known\r\nof these. Sir D. Gooch thus writes of them (after describing the spur\r\nand pinion gearing of the “Thunderer”):—“The same plan of gearing was\r\nused in the two engines built by the Haigh Foundry; their wheels\r\nwere 6ft.[A] diameter, and the gearing 2 to 1, but the cylinders were\r\nsmall. I felt very uneasy about the working of these machines, feeling\r\nsure they would have enough to do to drive themselves along the road.”\r\nIn the face of this emphatic and distinct statement of Sir D. Gooch.\r\nrespecting the two geared engines built by the Haigh Foundry Company,\r\nit has been stated that Sir D. Gooch was referring to the Haigh Foundry\r\nvalve gear! Fancy reading “the same (spur and pinion) plan of gearing\r\nwas used in the two engines built by the Haigh Foundry ... the gearing\r\nbeing 2 to 1,” and then being told that it was the Haigh valve gear\r\nthat was meant!\r\n\r\n[A] The records at Swindon Locomotive Works show that the “Snake” and\r\n“Viper” had wheels 6ft. 4in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Sir D. Gooch’s statement, we are fortunate to have the\r\nevidence of an independent person. This eye-witness, who saw one of the\r\nHaigh geared-up engines at Paddington in August, 1838, gives a very\r\ninteresting and lucid account of this engine and its trial trips. He\r\nwrites:—“I have just returned from witnessing the performance of an\r\nengine on the Great Western Railway, built by the Haigh Company, upon\r\nsomewhat of a new principle, which combines what the writer deems to\r\nbe essential to the perfectibility of the locomotive engine—namely,\r\nslower motion of piston with increased speed of engine. The experiment\r\nwas completely successful, and, although Mr. Harrison has abandoned his\r\nplan, the principle of giving increased speed by the application of\r\ntooth and pinion gear is fully established by this experiment.\r\n\r\n“The engine started from Paddington with five carriages to Maidenhead,\r\nand returned with five carriages and two wagons loaded with iron, and\r\nfrequently travelled at the rate of 40 miles an hour.\r\n\r\n“The engine then took the five o’clock train with passengers to\r\nMaidenhead, and performed the journey at the rate of 36 miles an hour\r\nwith from 120 to 150 passengers.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed in the above statement that Harrison had already\r\ndiscontinued the 3 to 1 gearing of the “Thunderer.” Sir D. Gooch says\r\nthat he had to rebuild one-half of the original engines to make them\r\nof any service. It is more than probable that the two Haigh geared\r\nengines were thus rebuilt. Indeed, the fact that the books of the Great\r\nWestern Railway show that the “Snake” and “Viper” had driving wheels\r\n6ft. 4in. in diameter is evidence that such was the case, as the\r\ngeared engines when delivered had wheels 6ft. in diameter, and allowing\r\nthat the small spur wheels were in a certain position, it would only be\r\nnecessary to remove the spur wheels, slightly alter the length of the\r\nconnecting-rods, and place wheels of 6ft. 4in. diameter on the crank\r\naxle to make ordinary locomotives of the engines in question.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that the discs of the “Ajax” wheels were cut down\r\nto 8ft., and new tyres provided, which would account for the fact that\r\nin 1842 Whishaw gives the diameter of “Ajax’s” driving wheels as only\r\n8ft.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting table gives the result of the working of some\r\nof the original Great Western Railway locomotives:—\r\n\r\n    -----------+-------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------\r\n               |        LOAD.      |        RATE OF        |      COKE CONSUMED.\r\n               |                   |      TRAVELLING.      |\r\n    -----------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+-----+-------+----+------------\r\n               |Carri-|      |     |Distance.|       |     | Total |    |\r\n               | ages,|      |     |         |Average|     |Quant- |    |\r\n               | etc. |Engine|     |         | time  |     | ity.  |    | Lbs. per\r\n    Names of   |      | and  |     |         |in 22½ |     |       |Lbs.| ton\r\n    Engines.   |      |Tender|Gross|         | miles.|     |       |per | per mile.\r\n               |      |      |Load.|         |       |Mean |       |mile|\r\n               |      |      |     |         |       |Rate.|       |    |\r\n               +------+------+-----+---------+-------+-----+-------+    +------+-----\r\n               |Tons. |Tons. |Tons.| Miles.  | Min.  |Miles|In lbs.|    |Goods.|Gross\r\n               |      |      |     |         |       | per |       |    |      |load.\r\n               |      |      |     |         |       |hour.|       |    |      |\r\n    -----------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+-----+-------+----+------+-----\r\n    North Star | 40.5 | 28.5 |69   | 8,848   | .884  |25.45|420,784|47.5| 1.17 | .69\r\n    Æolus      | 40.5 | 28.4 |68.9 | 7,292   | .237  |23.81|353,360|48.4| 1.19 | .71\r\n    Venus      | 40.5 | 26.5 |67   |   240   | .100  |22.5 | 12,656|52.7| 1.3  | .78\r\n    Neptune    | 40.5 | 26.5 |67   | 4,728   | .949  |23.83|188,384|39.8|  .95 | .59\r\n    Apollo     | 40.5 | 26.5 |67   | 4,392   | .942  |28.81|193,080|43.9| 1.08 | .65\r\n    Premier    | 40.5 | 25   |65.5 | 3,024   | .99   |22.73|159,936|52.8| 1.3  | .87\r\n    Lion       | 40.5 | 24   |64.5 | 3,973   | .96   |23.43|226,576|57  | 1.4  | .89\r\n    -----------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+-----+-------+----+------+-----\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the deficiency in the heating surface of many of\r\nthe original broad-gauge engines, they had but a short career; among\r\nthe first discarded were the “Ajax,” “Planet,” “Lion,” “Apollo,”\r\n“Hurricane,” and “Thunderer.”\r\n\r\nAlthough their lives as locomotives were ended, they were made to\r\nperform the functions of stationary engines; thus, during repairs\r\nto the beam engine in the fitting shops at Swindon Works in 1846 or\r\n1847, the “Lion” and “Planet” supplied the motive power to actuate\r\nthe machinery, while the “Apollo” supplied steam to work the first\r\nNasmyth’s steam-hammer erected at Swindon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Opening of the London and Birmingham Railway.—“Wallace,”\r\n        with feed-water heating apparatus.—Dr. Church’s tank\r\n        engine, “Eclipse.”—Balanced locomotives.—Smoke-consuming\r\n        locomotives.—Opening of the London and Southampton\r\n        Railway.—“Soho,” a locomotive without eccentrics.—A double\r\n        flanged wheel engine.—Hancock’s attempts to supply railway\r\n        locomotives.—American engines for England.—Particulars\r\n        of the engines and their working.—Gooch commences to\r\n        design engines for the Great Western Railway.—His patent\r\n        steeled tyres.—Gray introduces expansive working.—Trial of\r\n        his valve gear.—The “long boiler” fallacy.—Stephenson’s\r\n        design for the York and North Midland Railway.—Rennies\r\n        build a powerful locomotive.—Inventor of the link\r\n        motion: Howe, Williams, or Stephenson?—America claims\r\n        the credit for the improvement.—Beyer’s single-plate\r\n        frame engines.—Early Crewe engines.—Robertson fits a\r\n        steam brake to a locomotive.—Engines for working the\r\n        Cowlairs incline.—Bodmer’s reciprocating or “compensating”\r\n        engines.—Tried on the Sheffield and Manchester, South\r\n        Eastern, and London and Brighton Railways.—They prove\r\n        failures.—McConnell’s “Great Britain.”—Dewrance’s\r\n        coal-burning “Condor.”\r\n\r\nEdward Bury, the celebrated locomotive engineer, of Liverpool,\r\ncontracted to supply the London and Birmingham Railway with\r\nlocomotives. The first portion of the line was opened on June 20th,\r\n1837, and four-wheel Bury engines of his well-known types hauled the\r\ntrains. Fig. 30 shows one of his standard passenger engines for the\r\nLondon and Birmingham Railway.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Kimmond, Hutton, and Steele, of Dundee, built a locomotive,\r\nnamed “Wallace,” for the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, at a cost of\r\n£1,012, including the tender. This engine had inside frames and\r\ninclined horizontal outside cylinders, 13in. diameter, 18in. stroke;\r\nthe driving wheels were 5ft. 6in. diameter, the leading and trailing\r\nbeing 3ft. 6in. diameter; the valve chests were on top of the\r\ncylinders. The exhaust steam was turned into the tender for the purpose\r\nof heating the feed-water. The “Wallace” was described as being,\r\n“without exception, one of the most splendid and beautifully finished\r\npieces of mechanism; indeed, all present who had seen the ‘Scorpion,’\r\n‘Spitfire,’ and other celebrated English engines, gave the preference\r\nto the ‘Wallace.’” The gauge of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway was\r\n5ft. 6in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—BURY’S STANDARD PASSENGER ENGINE FOR THE LONDON\r\nAND BIRMINGHAM RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nDr. Church, a celebrated scientific experimentalist of Birmingham,\r\nconstructed a four-wheel tank engine in 1838, named the “ Eclipse.”\r\nThis locomotive was used in the construction of the London and\r\nBirmingham Railway. The cylinders were placed outside in a horizontal\r\nposition, and were 11½in. diameter, the stroke being 24in. The leading\r\nor driving wheels were 6ft. 2½in. diameter, and are said to have been\r\nthe largest used up to that time on the narrow-gauge, being 2½in.\r\nlarger than the 6ft. wheels of the original “Liverpool.” The trailing\r\nwheels were 3ft. diameter. The water-tanks were placed beneath the\r\nboiler, and when loaded the driving wheels sustained a weight of 9\r\ntons, and the trailing 5 tons. The “Eclipse” hauled a load of 100\r\ntons, and when running “light” attained a speed of 60 miles an hour.\r\nIt will be observed that for the size of the driving wheels, weight of\r\nengine, design, and speed, the “Eclipse” was a considerable advance on\r\nthe narrow-gauge practice then obtaining. The “Eclipse,” after being\r\nrebuilt, was at work at Swansea in 1861.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, two important improvements were introduced in locomotive\r\nconstruction—viz., the balancing of the reciprocating parts of the\r\nengine, and the partially successful use of coal in place of coke as\r\nfuel. Heaton, an engineer of Birmingham, introduced the balancing of\r\nlocomotive wheels. This was in August, 1838, when he made a model\r\nengine on the suggestion of a director of the London and Birmingham\r\nRailway. The “Brockhall,” one of the engines of the Company, was\r\nrepaired at the Vulcan Works, Birmingham, early in 1839, and was then\r\nfitted with Heaton’s improvement. Sharp, Roberts and Co. had, in the\r\nprevious December, supplied an engine to the London and Southampton\r\nRailway fitted with balancing weights just within the wheel rim; while\r\nHeaton’s weights took the form of an extension of the crank-throws\r\non the opposite side of the axle, a method still employed in modern\r\nengines. The first locomotive that ever burned coal in a satisfactory\r\nmanner, without the smoke causing a nuisance, was the “Prince George,”\r\na six-wheel engine belonging to the Grand Junction Railway. In 1838 it\r\nwas fitted with Chanter’s patent furnace, the fire-bars of which sloped\r\nfrom the fire-box door to the tube-plate at an angle of 45 degrees;\r\nover the fire-bars was a deflector. The motion of the engine caused\r\nall the fuel to fall to the lower end. Early in 1839 another six-wheel\r\nengine belonging to the Grand Junction Railway, the “Duke of Sussex,”\r\nwith cylinders 13in. by 18in., was fitted with a Chanter furnace. This\r\ntime the fire-bars did not slope so much, and on a trip from Crewe\r\nto Liverpool the engines covered several consecutive miles at the\r\nspeed of 60 miles an hour, the officials of the company at the same\r\ntime declaring that the engine emitted no more smoke than the engines\r\nburning coke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 31.—“GARNET,” ONE OF THE FIRST ENGINES SUPPLIED TO\r\nTHE LONDON AND SOUTHAMPTON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the London and Southampton Railway (now the London\r\nand South Western) was opened on May 12th, 1838, from London to Woking.\r\nThe original locomotives were, with four exceptions, six-wheel “single”\r\nengines, with driving wheels 5ft. 6in. diameter. Fig. 31, “Garnet,” is\r\nan illustration of one of these locomotives; the cylinders were 13in.\r\ndiameter, and the stroke 18in. The leading and trailing wheels were\r\n3ft. 6in. diameter. The “Garnet” weighed 13 tons empty.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Peel, Williams, and Peel, of Soho Works, Ancoats, sent the\r\nfirst locomotive constructed by them to the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway. This engine was named “Soho,” and took a train of 25 loaded\r\nwagons, weighing 133 tons 18 cwt. 2 qrs., from Liverpool to Manchester;\r\nwhilst for a fortnight before this she was running with the ordinary\r\npassenger trains, and “no failure had taken place, and the trains\r\nhaving usually been brought in before their time.” The improvement\r\nintroduced into this engine consisted of a new method of working the\r\nvalves. The “Soho” had no eccentrics, but in place of them were two\r\nspur wheels, staked on to the crank axle, driving two other wheels of\r\nequal diameter placed immediately over them, so as to preserve the\r\ndistance between the centres constantly the same, and unaffected by the\r\nmotion of the engine on its springs. The wheels last mentioned were\r\nattached to a short axle, carrying at each end a small crank-arm, which\r\ndrove a connecting-rod attached to the valve spindle.\r\n\r\nFenton, Murray, and Jackson, of Leeds, in 1839, supplied a six-wheel\r\nengine named “Agilis” to the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway. We have\r\nonly very meagre details relating to this locomotive, but she is said\r\nto have had flanges an each side of the wheels, and also “that if\r\neither one or all the eccentrics which move the valves were broken,\r\ndisarranged, lost off, or taken away, she is still under the control of\r\nthe engineer, who can safely conduct her along the railway nearly as\r\nwell as if those parts had remained entire.” No explanation is given as\r\nto “how it was done”!\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Walter Hancock, of Stratford, Essex, who was well known as\r\na steam road-coach builder, constructed a locomotive on somewhat the\r\nsame system as his steam coaches. This engine was tried on the Eastern\r\nCounties Railway. The boiler was of peculiar design, containing a\r\nnumber of separate chambers, each enclosing several tubes. Each chamber\r\nor set of tubes connected with two general reservoirs, one at the\r\nbottom for the supply of water, the top one being a reservoir for the\r\nsteam. The connection from each chamber to the water, steam pipes, and\r\nreservoirs had self-acting valves, so that should an accident happen\r\nto any one chamber the self-acting valves were closed by the pressure\r\nof the steam above, or the water beneath, so that the remainder of the\r\nboiler retained its efficiency, the only result of the accident being\r\na reduction of the heating surface. An accident of this kind was not\r\nso serious as a burst tube, as the damaged portion was automatically\r\nthrown out of use. Another advantage of this locomotive was the great\r\nheating surface contained in a comparatively small space; a further\r\nimprovement was a reciprocating set of fire-bars. The cylinders were\r\nvertical, and actuated an independent crank-shaft; the progressive\r\nmotion was conveyed to the wheel axle by means of endless chains\r\nworking over pulleys fixed on the driving wheel axles, the diameter of\r\nthe pulleys being graduated, so that the engine could be geared up or\r\ndown, as either speed or power was required.\r\n\r\nAs the machinery did not directly drive the wheels, it was possible\r\nto put that portion out of gear when it became necessary to work the\r\nfeed pumps, etc. This was a considerable improvement on the usual\r\nlocomotive, which upon such occasions either had to make a few trips\r\nfor the purpose of supplying the boiler with water, or else perform\r\nover a “race.”\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Norris, the locomotive builder of Philadelphia, U.S.A., made\r\nan offer to the directors of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway to\r\nprovide engines for working the severe gradient known as the Lickey\r\nIncline, 2 miles 3.35 chains in length. The agreement stipulated\r\nthat the “locomotive engines were to be of a higher power, greater\r\ndurability, and less weight than could be obtained in this country.\r\nThey were to be subjected to 15 trials within 30 days, and prove their\r\ncapability by drawing up a gradient of 1 in 330 a load of 100 tons\r\ngross weight, at a speed of 20 miles an hour, and up a gradient of 1\r\nin 180 a load of 100 tons at the speed of 14 miles an hour.” If the\r\nAmerican locomotives fulfilled these conditions the Birmingham and\r\nGloucester Railway were under a contract to accept ten of the engines,\r\nat a price not exceeding £1,600 each, including the 20 per cent. import\r\nduty. Captain Moorsom, the engineer of the railway, stated that the\r\n“engines had not strictly complied with the stipulated conditions, yet\r\nhe considered them good, serviceable engines.” It will be observed that\r\nno guarantee was given as to what work these engines would accomplish\r\non the Lickey Incline.\r\n\r\nThe first three engines to arrive were the “England,” “Columbia,” and\r\n“Atlantic,” and, according to the arrangements between the builder\r\nand the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, they underwent a series\r\nof trials, on the Grand Junction Railway before the directors of\r\nthe Birmingham and Gloucester Railway accepted the engines. These\r\ntrials took place during April and May, 1839, between Birmingham and\r\nLiverpool, a double journey of 156 miles being frequently made in one\r\nday. The requisite load could not always be obtained, and it then\r\nbecame necessary to add empty wagons to the train to make up the right\r\nweight. The trains on some of the occasions exceeded 220 yards or ⅛\r\nmile in length. With a steam-working pressure of 62lb. per square\r\ninch, the results tabulated were as follows:—On a rising gradient of 1\r\nin 330, with a load ranging between 100 and 120 tons, the speed ranged\r\nfrom 13⁴/₅ miles to 22½ miles an hour; on an incline of 1 in 177, with\r\na load of 100 tons, the variation in speed ranged between 9⁴/₅ miles\r\nand 13⁴/₅ miles an hour. Twenty-one trial trips were made, and in only\r\nfive were the stipulated performances carried out, in five others doubt\r\nexisted as to the work performed, but in eleven the engines failed to\r\ndo the required amount of work.\r\n\r\nThese experiments showed a curious result with regard to the fuel\r\nconsumed. The aggregate rise of the gradients from Liverpool to\r\nBirmingham is about 620ft.; that from Birmingham to Liverpool in\r\nabout 380ft. (exclusive in both cases of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway); the difference, therefore, up to Birmingham is about 240ft.\r\n\r\nIn seven journeys of 596 miles up to Birmingham, the engine conveyed\r\n682 tons gross, evaporated 12,705 gallons of water, and consumed 177\r\nsacks of coke (1½ cwt. each). In seven journeys of 596 miles down from\r\nBirmingham, the same engine conveyed 629 tons gross, evaporated 12,379\r\ngallons of water, and consumed 177 sacks of coke. It would thus appear\r\nthat the consumption of fuel was the same in both cases, and the only\r\ndifference was the evaporation of 326 gallons of water more in the\r\njourney up than in the journey down, conveying nearly the same load\r\nboth ways. The construction of these engines was very simple, and the\r\nwork plain. The boiler was horizontal, and contained 78 copper tubes\r\n2in. diameter and 8ft. long, with an iron fire-box. The cylinders,\r\n10½in. diameter, were inclined slightly downwards, and so placed that\r\nthe piston-rods worked outside the wheels, thus avoiding the necessity\r\nof cranked axles.\r\n\r\nThe framing of these American engines was supported by six wheels;\r\nthe two driving wheels of 4ft. diameter were placed close before the\r\nfire-box; the other four wheels, of 30in. diameter, were attached to\r\na truck, which carried the front end of the boiler, and was connected\r\nwith the frame by a centre-pin, on which it turned freely, allowing the\r\ntruck to accommodate itself to the exterior rail of the curve, and,\r\nwith the assistance of the cone of the wheels, to pass round with very\r\nlittle stress upon the rails.\r\n\r\n                                                      Tons cwt.\r\n    The weight of the engine with the boiler and\r\n          fire-box full was                            9  11¼\r\n    That of the tender with 21 cwt. of coke and 520\r\n          gallons of water was                         6   4¼\r\n                                                     -----------\r\n                                        Total weight  15  15½\r\n                                                     ===========\r\n\r\nThese engines, when empty, weighed only eight tons each.\r\n\r\nAnother of the American bogie engines supplied to the Birmingham\r\nand Gloucester Railway was named the “Philadelphia.” She was a more\r\npowerful locomotive than the three mentioned above, and Captain\r\nMoorsom, the engineer of the railway, in a letter dated from Worcester\r\non June 22nd, 1840, gives an interesting account of her trial on the\r\nLickey Bank. “Seventy-six chains in the incline of 1 in 37½ were made\r\nready with a single way, and three chains nearly level were laid\r\ntemporarily to rest upon before starting. The road was quite new, and\r\nconsequently not firm or well gauged, and the works going on close at\r\nhand occasionally covered the rails with dirt. The wagons used were of\r\na large class, like those on the Manchester and Leeds line, and weighed\r\nwhen empty rather more than 2½ tons, and at first worked very stiffly.\r\nThey were loaded with 4 tons, and generally weighed, including persons\r\nupon them, about 6¾ tons. The ‘Philadelphia’ weighed (as she worked)\r\nabout 12 tons 3 cwt., and her tender weighed nearly 7 tons, being in\r\nall 19 tons. She had 12½in. cylinders, 20in. stroke, 4ft. driving wheel\r\nnot coupled. The weight on her driving wheels was 6⅓ tons (as weighed\r\nat Liverpool) without water.\r\n\r\n“The usual load she took was eight wagons, engine, and tender, with\r\npersons, equal to 74 tons gross weight, in ten minutes, or nearly 6\r\nmiles per hour, the last quarter of a mile being at the rate of 9¾\r\nmiles per hour. Seven wagons, etc., equal to 67¼ tons gross weight,\r\nin about 9 minutes, or 6½ miles per hour mean speed. Six wagons,\r\netc., equal to 61 tons gross weight, in sometimes 5¼ and sometimes 6½\r\nminutes, say in 6 minutes average, or 9 miles per hour mean speed, the\r\nlast quarter of a mile usually giving a speed of nearly 11 miles an\r\nhour. Five wagons, equal to about 53 tons gross, were usually taken at\r\na speed of 13 miles per hour for the last half-mile up. The foregoing\r\nresults occurred generally during fine weather, but sometimes the rails\r\nwere partially wet, and this occasioned a difference of speed in the\r\nascent of half a minute to a minute and a half. One day when showery\r\nthe men walked over the rails with marl on their boots, rendering the\r\nway very greasy and slippery, also the lower part of the plane had been\r\nformed only a few hours, and was very soft and badly gauged.\r\n\r\n“Under these circumstances the ‘Philadelphia’ took five wagons, self,\r\nand tender, being a gross weight, including persons, of about 53 tons,\r\nup at a mean rate of rather more than 5 miles per hour, and the last\r\nquarter of a mile was passed at the rate of 8 miles per hour. Two\r\nwagons were then taken off, and the ‘Philadelphia’ took the remaining\r\nthree wagons, self, and tender, being a gross weight, including\r\npersons, of 40 tons, up at a mean rate of 12 miles nearly per hour, her\r\nmaximum speed being nearly 16 miles per hour.”\r\n\r\nSir D. Gooch was not at all satisfied with the original broad-gauge\r\nlocomotives, and in 1839 he obtained the sanction of the directors of\r\nthe Great Western Railway to design two classes of locomotives for the\r\nrailway. These engines were known as the “Firefly” class and the “Fury”\r\nclass, the former having 7ft. driving wheels, cylinders 15in. diameter,\r\n18in. stroke, and 700ft. of heating surface; the latter had 6ft.\r\ndriving wheels, cylinders 14in. diameter and 18in. stroke, and 608ft.\r\nof heating surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—“HARPY,” ONE OF GOOCH’S “FIREFLY” CLASS OF\r\nBROAD-GAUGE ENGINES]\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty-two locomotives of the “Fury” and “Firefly”\r\ndesign were constructed. Sir D. Gooch states that the best were built\r\nby Fenton, Murray and Jackson, of Leeds. The sixty-two of the “Firefly”\r\nclass were built as follows:—Twenty, by Fenton, Murray and Jackson,\r\nLeeds; sixteen, by Nasmyth, Gaskell and Co., Manchester; ten, by Sharp,\r\nRoberts and Co., Manchester; six, by Jones, Turner and Evans, Newton;\r\nsix, by Longridge and Co., Bedlington; two, by Slaughter and Co.,\r\nBristol; and two, by G. and J. Rennie, London.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that most of these were built in the North\r\nof England, and it is a significant fact that these broad-gauge\r\nlocomotives were conveyed on narrow-gauge trucks for some hundreds of\r\nmiles to the Great Western Railway, thus showing that it would have\r\nbeen quite possible to widen the existing narrow-gauge railways, by\r\nsimply decreasing the space between the two roads, comparatively at a\r\nsmall expense.\r\n\r\nAll these engines were built from the specifications and drawings\r\nsupplied by the Great Western Railway to the makers, and thin\r\niron templates were also supplied of those parts which were to be\r\ninterchangeable. Fig. 32 illustrates the “Firefly” type.\r\n\r\nThe “Firefly,” built by Jones and Co., Viaduct Foundry, Newton, was\r\nthe first of these engines delivered. On March 28th, 1840, she made\r\nan experimental trip from Paddington to Reading, with a load of\r\ntwo carriages, containing 40 passengers, and a carriage truck; she\r\nperformed the journey in 46 minutes 25 seconds from start to stop. A\r\nspring of one of the tender wheels broke on the journey, necessitating\r\ncareful running. On the return trip, between the 26th and 24th mile\r\nposts, a speed of 56 miles an hour was reached, and the average speed\r\nfrom Twyford to Paddington was over 50 miles an hour. On the occasion\r\nof the Queen’s accouchement in August, 1844, the news was brought to\r\nLondon by a special messenger travelling on one of these engines.\r\nThe journey from Slough to Paddington, 18¼ miles, was accomplished\r\nin 15 minutes 10 seconds, or at the rate of 75 miles an hour. The\r\nillustration (Fig. 33) shows the interior of the old Paddington engine\r\nshed, and amongst the locomotives to be seen are the “Ganymede” and\r\n“Etna.” All the engines had domed fire-boxes, and outside frames,\r\nthe principal dimensions, in addition to those already given, being:\r\nLeading and trailing wheels, 4ft. diameter; boiler barrel, 8ft. 6in.\r\nlong, 4ft. diameter; 131 tubes, 2in. diameter, 9ft. long; weight, in\r\nworking order on leading 4¾ tons, driving 11 tons 13 cwt., trailing 7\r\ntons 16 cwt.; total, 24 tons 4 cwt.\r\n\r\nOn November 20th, 1840, Daniel Gooch obtained a patent for steeled\r\ntyres, and the locomotives of the “Fury” and “Firefly” classes were\r\nfitted with these patent tyres. Although the tyres only contained\r\none-fifth part of shear steel, yet the use of Gooch’s tyres did not\r\nbecome general, as 56 years ago steel was an expensive commodity, and\r\nconsequently railway rolling stock generally was not fitted with steel\r\ntyres; indeed, the Great Western Railway went no further than using the\r\nimprovement for their locomotive and tender wheels. Many locomotives\r\nfitted with these patent tyres ran nearly 300,000 miles before new\r\ntyres were required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—INTERIOR OF PADDINGTON ENGINE HOUSE, SHOWING\r\nTHE BROAD-GAUGE LOCOMOTIVES OF 1840]\r\n\r\nThese first essays of Daniel Gooch as a locomotive designer at once\r\nplaced him at the very head of locomotive engineers, and Gooch himself,\r\nusually so modest, says of these locomotives, “I may with confidence,\r\nafter these engines have been working for 28 years, say that no better\r\nengines for their weight have since been constructed, either by myself\r\nor others. They have done, and continue to do, admirable duty.” This\r\ncandid eulogium of these engines by their designer certainly did not\r\ngo beyond the truth in describing their good points. Gooch’s first\r\ndesign of broad-gauge goods locomotives had six-coupled wheels 5ft. in\r\ndiameter, inside cylinders 16in. diameter, and a stroke of 24in. The\r\nfire-box was of the domed pattern. Fig. 34 (“Jason”) represents one of\r\nthese engines.\r\n\r\nJohn Gray, who was in 1840 locomotive superintendent of the Hull and\r\nSelby Railway, introduced a striking improvement into the construction\r\nof locomotives at that time. (Gray had, on July 26th, 1838, taken out\r\na patent for his valve gear; and whilst on the subject of valve gears,\r\nit will be of interest to note that Dodds and Owen patented their wedge\r\nmotion on September 16th, 1839.) In Gray’s improvements in the Hull and\r\nSelby engines, he adopted inside bearings for the driving wheels, an\r\nextended base for the springs, and, of course, his patent valve motion\r\nand expansive working. Shepherd and Todd, of the Railway Foundry,\r\nLeeds, constructed the engines in question. The driving wheels were\r\n6ft. diameter, cylinders 12in. diameter by 24in. stroke, fire-box 2ft.\r\nby 3ft. 6in. (inside), and 94 2in. tubes, 9ft. 6in. long. Two of these\r\nlocomotives, “Star” and “Vesta,” were tried in competition with other\r\nengines on Tuesday, November 10th, 1840. Sixteen trips were made by the\r\n“Star” and “Vesta,” the average loads being 55.4 tons, or 1,718 tons\r\nover one mile; coke consumed, 465lb., or 0.271lb. per ton per mile;\r\nwater evaporated, 2,874lb., or 1.62lb. per ton per mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—“JASON,” ONE OF GOOCH’S FIRST TYPE OF GOODS\r\nENGINES FOR THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nTwo other classes of locomotives were tried in competition with Gray’s\r\npatent—viz., the usual kind of engines then in use, and the same with\r\nthe addition of Gray’s expansion gear.\r\n\r\nThe result of the trials is shown in the following table:—\r\n\r\n     (A) = Loads in Tons Conveyed over 1 mile in lbs.\r\n     (B) = Elsecar Coke used per trip of 31 miles in lbs.\r\n     (C) = Coke used per mile in lbs. per mile in lbs.\r\n     (D) = Coke used per ton per mile in lbs.\r\n     (E) = Water used per trip of 81 miles in lbs.\r\n     (F) = Water per mile in lbs.\r\n     (G) = Water per ton per mile in lbs.\r\n    ----------+--------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+-----\r\n      Class   |        |         |       |       |        |        |\r\n        of    |  (A)   |   (B)   |  (C)  |  (D)  |   (E)  |   (F)  | (G)\r\n      Engine  |        |         |       |       |        |        |\r\n    ----------+--------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+-----\r\n    Patent    | 1649.4 |  446.98 | 14.41 | 0.271 | 2672   |  86.19 | 1.62\r\n    Altered   | 1649.4 |  686.15 | 22.13 | 0.416 | 4601.6 | 148.43 | 2.90\r\n    Unaltered | 1649.4 | 1007.78 | 32.59 | 0.611 | 6432.8 | 207.5  | 3.97\r\n    ----------+--------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+-----\r\n\r\nThe financial annual result of the three classes of engines for coke\r\nand boilers, with such a traffic as that of the Hull and Selby line,\r\nwas about:—\r\n\r\n    £4,500 for the unaltered engines.\r\n    £3,250 for the altered engines.\r\n    £2,000 for the patent engines.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the era of another development of the\r\nlocomotive—viz. the introduction of “long boiler” engines; but although\r\nthe idea was well “boomed,” it never was thought much of by competent\r\nlocomotive engineers; indeed, many severely condemned the plan.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Robert Stephenson patented a new form of valve gear, with a\r\ntop and bottom gab fixed to the valve spindle, and the ends of the\r\neccentric rods kept apart by a straight link. Here, again, Stephenson\r\nintroduced nothing new, his gear being but a clumsy adaptation of\r\nRoberts’s valve gear. An engine of this description (generally known\r\nas Stephenson’s patent “long boiler” engine) was tried on the York and\r\nNorth Midland Railway in January, 1842, the dimensions being:—\r\n\r\n    Diameter of Cylinder                               14     inches\r\n    Length of Stroke                                   20       ”\r\n    Diameter of Driving Wheels                          5½    feet\r\n    Diameter of small wheels.                           3       ”\r\n    There are 150 tubes, giving a heating surface of  765       ”\r\n    Copper Fire-Box, with a heating surface of         30       ”\r\n                                                     -----   ------\r\n                               Total heating surface  795     feet\r\n    Length of Boiler, including fire and smoke boxes   17      ”\r\n    Weight of the Engine in working order              15     tons\r\n\r\nDuring a journey of 90 miles, a speed of 48 miles an hour was attained,\r\nbut the train then consisted of only five carriages of light weight.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of fuel during the above experiment was 19.2lb. per\r\nmile, with a load of eight coaches over half the distance (45 miles)\r\nand five coaches over the remaining half.\r\n\r\nThis consumption included the whole of the fuel used in lighting the\r\nfire and raising the steam.\r\n\r\nR. Stephenson introduced tubes of wrought-iron instead of brass or\r\ncopper, in order that the increased heating surface might be obtained\r\nwithout a corresponding augmentation in the price of the engine. This\r\nhe did not adopt without making several experiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve months he had several boilers working under his\r\nown eye with iron tubes, for the special purpose of determining how\r\nfar he could recommend them for general adoption. The result was all\r\nthat he could desire; and owing to this he introduced them with great\r\nconfidence. The valve gear is thus eulogised: “In ordinary engines the\r\nmechanism for working the slide-valves was very liable to derangement\r\nand considerable wear and tear.\r\n\r\n“This part of the engine he so far simplified that it required only a\r\nsimple connection between the eccentrics and slide-valves, thus doing\r\naway with a considerable number of moving parts.\r\n\r\n“This was attained by placing the slide-valves vertically on the sides\r\nof the cylinders, instead of on the top as heretofore, so that the\r\ndirection of the sliding motion of the valves and the central line of\r\nthe valve-rods intersected the central line of the main axle at the\r\npoint where the eccentrics were placed. In this case the eccentric-rods\r\nwere connected immediately to the prolongation of the valve-rods,\r\nwithout the usual intermediate levers and weigh bars; the slide\r\nvalves of both cylinders were placed in one steam chest, between the\r\ncylinders.” Another improvement was in the working of the feed pumps;\r\nit consisted in connecting the pump-rods to the eccentrics used for\r\nreversing the engine. By this arrangement the velocity of the moving\r\npart of the pump was greatly diminished, by which was secured greater\r\nregularity of action.\r\n\r\nMessrs. G. and J. Rennie, of Holland Street, Blackfriars, S.E., in\r\n1841, constructed a locomotive named the “Lambro” for the Milan and\r\nMonzo Railway. The “Lambro” was built from the design of Mr. Albano,\r\nthe engineer to the railway; the cylinders were 13in. diameter, 18in.\r\nstroke, driving wheels 5ft. 6in. diameter, steam pressure 50lb., weight\r\n22 tons. Her average coke consumption with trains weighing 143 tons at\r\n36 miles an hour, was only 22lb. per mile. The locomotive engineer of\r\nthe railway reported that “no engine he had seen at all approached the\r\nlocomotive engine ‘Lambro’ in any respect whatever, in the economy of\r\nfuel, in her immense dragging power, and in the excellency and solidity\r\nof her framing and working gear.”\r\n\r\nThe particular evolution now about to be described occupies a foremost\r\nposition in locomotive history. Like many other useful inventions, the\r\nlink motion has been proclaimed as the production of different people.\r\n\r\nIts popular title, the “Stephenson” link motion, is a well-known\r\nmisnomer; indeed, Stephenson never appears to have put forward a claim\r\nin which he figured as the inventor of the curved link motion, perhaps,\r\nat first, he did not fully appreciate its value.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the idea belongs to Williams, of Newcastle, who, in 1842,\r\ndesigned a form of straight link coupling the two eccentrics together.\r\nOf course, such an arrangement was utterly impossible in practice,\r\nas the crank, in revolving, would soon place the two eccentrics in\r\nsuch a position that the link would be destroyed. The curved link,\r\nplaced half-way between the valves and eccentrics, was soon evolved\r\nfrom Williams’ crude idea, and up to 1846 it was most generally called\r\nWilliams’ motion. In an article describing expansion valves, in the\r\n_Practical Mechanics’ Magazine_ for April, 1846, it is so described;\r\nbut in the May number of the magazine a letter appears from William\r\nHowe, a fitter employed by R. Stephenson and Co., Newcastle. In this\r\ncommunication Howe states that Williams proposed the straight link,\r\npreviously mentioned, but that Howe saw its utter impracticability, and\r\nevolved the curved link. Williams made no reply to this communication;\r\nalthough he may not have seen Howe’s letter claiming the invention. Be\r\nthis as it may, Howe was thereafter given the credit for the curved\r\nlink. It is, however, significant that he never patented it, and it\r\nis probable that at first neither he nor Stephenson saw its value as\r\na means of effectually working the valves expansively, or one or the\r\nother would have protected the invention, seeing that Stephenson had\r\nthen quite recently patented the top and bottom gab-gear. Then, again,\r\nHowe’s supposed claim may have been a reason for not protecting it.\r\n\r\nIn the invention of the link motion, this country does not appear to\r\nhave been forestalled by the Celestial Empire, as (it is asserted) is\r\nthe case with so many useful discoveries. But the glory does not rest\r\nwith us, for it has been shrewdly “guessed” that the idea originated\r\nwith one of our American cousins, W. T. James, of New York, who, as\r\nearly as 1832, constructed the “James” locomotive, which was provided\r\nwith link motion. The invention at this period does not appear to have\r\nbeen considered of any value, for its use was not perpetuated in later\r\nlocomotives in America until after it had been re-discovered by the\r\nWilliams-Howe experiments of 1842-3.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Mr. C. Beyer, then employed with Messrs. Sharp Brothers and\r\nCo., but afterwards of the well-known firm of locomotive builders,\r\nMessrs. Beyer, Peacock and Co., Manchester, introduced the single iron\r\nplate for locomotive frames.\r\n\r\nTrevithick’s son directed his attention to the evolution of the steam\r\nlocomotive, and while chief engineer of the Grand Junction Railway, the\r\nnow world-famous Crewe Works were erected, being opened in 1843. Mr.\r\nA. Allan became manager at Crewe, and under his superintendence a new\r\nclass of engines was constructed, the novel points being the coupling\r\nof the driving and trailing wheels—Allan having, in 1863, publicly\r\nclaimed this innovation as wholly and solely due to him.\r\n\r\nThe engines in question are usually described as “the old Crewe goods\r\nclass,” and had outside cylinders, 15in. by 14in. The coupled wheels\r\nwere 5ft. diameter, and were placed one pair before and the other\r\nbehind the fire-box; these wheels had inside bearings, and the small\r\nleading pair had outside bearings. The steam pressure was 120lb. These\r\nuseful engines weighed 19½ tons, and were used for goods traffic for\r\nmany years. Mr. Ramsbottom afterwards rebuilt several of them as tank\r\nengines, and some, as such, are still in use on the London and North\r\nWestern Railway. Alexander Allan, who died as recently as 1891, was\r\nnoted for his invention of a straight link motion in 1855.\r\n\r\nThe need of a powerful brake has always been one of the greatest\r\nnecessities of locomotive engineers. For a long time they all agreed\r\nthat it was not advisable to brake the driving wheels of locomotives;\r\nbut Peter Robertson, the locomotive superintendent of the Glasgow\r\nand Ayr Railway, was of a different opinion, and in April, 1843, he\r\nfitted a locomotive on that railway with his patent steam brake. The\r\napparatus consisted of a flexible metal band, of a semi-circular shape,\r\nsurrounding the upper half of the driving wheel. One end of the band\r\nfastened to a hinge, and the other was fixed to a piston-rod. When\r\n“off,” the piston-rod held the band away from the tyre of the driving\r\nwheel, but when steam was applied behind the piston the band was\r\ntightly pressed against the tyre. Such was the simple, but effective,\r\napplication of Robertson’s steam brake. A familiar example of its\r\naction can be seen in the hand brakes still fitted to cranes.\r\n\r\nThe Cowlairs incline at Glasgow is the _bête noir_ of the North British\r\nRailway, and is situate just outside the Glasgow terminus of what was\r\noriginally the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. When first opened this\r\nincline was (as is, indeed, at present the case) worked by stationary\r\nengines; but towards the end of 1843 Mr. Paton, the locomotive\r\nsuperintendent, and Mr. Millar, the engineer of the Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow Railway, designed and built a powerful locomotive for working\r\nthis two-mile incline of 1 in 42. The engine was put to work in\r\nJanuary, 1844, and during that year the cost of working the incline\r\nwas, with the locomotive, one-third of the amount expended during the\r\nprevious twelve months on the stationary engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEVATION\r\n\r\nFIG. 34A.—PATON AND MILLAR’S TANK ENGINE FOR WORKING ON THE COWLAIRS\r\nINCLINE, GLASGOW]\r\n\r\nUpon reference to the illustration (Fig. 34A) of this remarkable\r\nlocomotive, the first detail that attracts notice is the immense steam\r\ndome. The engine was supported on six-coupled wheels of 4ft. 3½in.\r\ndiameter. The cylinders were “outside,” fixed in an inclined position\r\nabout half-way up the smoke-box, their diameter being 15½in. The stroke\r\nwas 25in. These dimensions, it will be noticed, were considerably in\r\nadvance of the general practice obtaining 55 years ago. The valve\r\nchests were above the cylinders, and the eccentrics were fixed on the\r\ndriving axle, within the frames; the springs were underhung, and all\r\nthe wheels were counterbalanced. Two lever safety valves were provided.\r\nThe heating surface of the fire-box was 60 sq. ft., that of the tubes\r\n748ft. The other principal dimensions of this engine were:—Fire-box,\r\n4ft. long by 4ft. 6in. deep; smoke-box, 2ft. 6in. long by 4ft. 4in.\r\ndeep; 136 tubes, 2in. diameter, and 10ft. 6in. long. This engine, it\r\nshould be observed, was of the “tank” class, 200 gallons of water being\r\nstored in a tank below the smoke-box, that amount being sufficient for\r\ntwo trips. The water was supplied from a stand-pipe, and not from the\r\nusual columns.\r\n\r\nThe driving wheels were furnished with brakes, the levers of which were\r\nworked by a screw, the handle of the latter being placed within reach\r\nof the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe trailing pair of wheels had a steam brake, something like those\r\napplied to the engines of the Ayr line by Mr. Robertson. Sand-boxes\r\nwere placed in front on each side of the water-tank for dropping sand\r\non the rails, which was done by the stoker on the foot-plate, by a\r\nhandle and rod from valves or stoppers in the boxes. The most effectual\r\nremedy against slipping was to keep the rails clean, which was done by\r\nmeans of two jets from the boiler in going down the incline plane. When\r\nvery dirty two other jets of cold water were used, a small air vessel\r\nand one of the feed pumps being used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of the engine was 26½ tons; the rate of speed with 12\r\ncarriages of the gross weight of 54 tons was 15 miles per hour; the\r\nrate of speed with 20 trucks of goods of a gross weight of 104 tons was\r\n9 miles per hour, up the Cowlairs incline.\r\n\r\n              WORK OF ENGINE FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1844.\r\n                     TOTAL WORK DONE ON INCLINE PLANE.\r\n    -----------+-------------+-----------+-------+------+---------+------\r\n     Carriage. |   Trucks.   |   Brakes. | Gross |Lifts.|Piloting.|Week\r\n               |             |           | Total.|      |         |ending\r\n               |             |           |       |      |         | Nov.\r\n    -----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-------+------+---------+------\r\n     No. |Tons.| No. | Tons. | No. |Tons.| Tons. |Total.|   Hrs   |\r\n         |     |     |       |     |     |       |      |         |\r\n     335 |1,675|  694| 3,817 |  298|1,937| 7,429 | 121  |   120   |  7\r\n     344 |1,720|  673| 3,701½|  268|1,742| 7,163½| 107  |   118   | 14\r\n     375 |1,878|  658| 3,619 |  248|1,612| 7,106 | 104  |   118   | 21\r\n     376 |1,900|  640| 5,525½|  254|1,660| 7,076½| 103  |   118   | 28\r\n    -----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-------+------+---------+------\r\n    1,430|7,170|2,665|14,663 |1,068|6,951|28,775 | 435  |   474   |  —\r\n    -----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-------+------+---------+------\r\n\r\nThe table on page 99 gives the results of one month’s working of a\r\nsecond locomotive of similar design, the cylinders, however, being\r\n16½in. diameter, and additional heating surface being provided by means\r\nof a water space dividing the fire-box. The second engine was put to\r\nwork towards the end of 1844.\r\n\r\nThese engines were named “Hercules” and “Sampson,” and were built at\r\nCowlairs, whilst two others of the same general design, and named\r\n“Millar” and “Hawthorne,” were constructed at Newcastle.\r\n\r\nMr. A. E. Lockyer states that these engines “had not run any length of\r\ntime, however, before the foreman platelayer complained of the engines\r\ndestroying the rails, which, it must be remembered, were only 58lb. per\r\nyard, with the sleepers 3ft. apart.” In consequence of this report the\r\nincline was relaid, the distance between the sleepers being reduced\r\nto 2ft. between the centres. This did not much mend matters, and to\r\ncrown all, the Forth and Clyde Canal began to leak, in consequence, no\r\ndoubt, of the vibration induced by the constant passage of the heavy\r\nlocomotives. A strategic movement to the rear then became necessary,\r\nand an eminent engineer (Mr. McNaught) was appointed by the directors\r\nto strengthen the land engine, and put it in proper working order, so\r\nas to reintroduce the haulage system for working the incline.\r\n\r\nA Newcastle firm (R. S. Newall and Co., the original inventors and\r\npatentees of untwisted iron rope) supplied the railway company with\r\none of their wire ropes. The land engine was finished by March 4th,\r\n1847, and on trial under the new conditions the haulage system proved\r\nhighly satisfactory, so much so that the four locomotives were removed\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester and Sheffield line was, in 1845, supplied with four\r\npowerful goods locomotives, built on Bodmer’s patent principle. The\r\ncylinders were 18in. diameter, stroke 24in.; the six-coupled wheels\r\nwere 4ft. 6in. diameter; but the weight of these engines was only 24\r\ntons each. They are, however, stated to have been equal to hauling a\r\ngross load of over 1,000 tons. Bodmer’s locomotives deserve recognition\r\nin the evolution of the steam locomotive, because of their curious\r\nconstruction, and also because other locomotive histories do not\r\nmention these peculiar engines.\r\n\r\nThe engines are described as “compensating,” the whole strain being\r\nconfined to the pistons, piston-rods, connecting-rods, and cranks.\r\nThere were two pistons in each cylinder, one being connected with one\r\ncrank and the other with the opposite crank of an axle with double\r\ncranks on each side, so that the driving axle was fitted with four\r\ncranks.\r\n\r\nThe steam was admitted alternately between the two pistons at the time\r\nthe pistons met in the middle of the cylinders, also between the ends\r\nor tops of the cylinders and the pistons when the latter arrived at the\r\nother end of the stroke.\r\n\r\nBodmer claimed that by this arrangement the engine was perfectly\r\nbalanced, and no oscillation or pitching of the engine resulted, no\r\nmatter what speed was attained. Another engine of this description\r\nwas supplied to the Sheffield and Manchester Railway, constructed by\r\nSharp Bros. and Co. The cylinders were 14in. diameter, stroke 20in.\r\n(two strokes of 10in. each in both cylinders), driving wheels 5ft.\r\ndiameter, steam pressure 90lb. per square inch. During November, 1844,\r\nthe average coke consumption of this engine amounted to only 21.92lb.\r\nper mile.\r\n\r\nA larger and more powerful engine on the same principle was supplied\r\nto the Joint Locomotive Committee of the South Eastern and London and\r\nBrighton Railways, and when the Committee was dissolved the engine\r\nwas taken over by the South Eastern Railway in 1845, and was numbered\r\n123. The cylinders were 16in. diameter and 30in. stroke, or rather,\r\ntwo pistons each working a stroke of 15in. Heating surface was: box 73\r\nsq. ft.; tubes 769 sq. ft.; steam pressure 95lb.; weight 18 tons; coke\r\nconsumption 15lb. per mile. The driving wheels were 5ft. 6in. diameter.\r\nShortly after the South Eastern Railway took over this engine it broke\r\ndown, and one of the men in charge was killed.\r\n\r\nBodmer also supplied the London and Brighton Railway with one of these\r\npatent reciprocating engines. This was in December, 1845; and she ran\r\nthe first 5 p.m. express from London to Brighton. The locomotive in\r\nquestion was No. 7, and had single driving wheels, 6ft. diameter. The\r\ncylinders were 15in. diameter, and the 20in. of stroke was, of course,\r\ncovered by two pistons in each cylinder working 10in. The fire-box was\r\nof the well-known “Bury” type. No. 7 was rebuilt in January, 1850, when\r\nBodmer’s reciprocating pistons were taken out, and ordinary ones put\r\nin. In later years No. 7 was named “Seaford.”\r\n\r\nBodmer designed another engine on this plan, with outside cylinders\r\n22in. diameter and 24in. stroke—_i.e._, two pistons of 12in. stroke\r\neach. The driving wheels were 7ft. diameter. The boiler pressure of\r\nthis extraordinary engine was 100lb. and the coke consumption was\r\nestimated at 10lb. per mile, with trains of 12 coaches. This engine was\r\nfitted with cylindrical slides and expansion valves, under a patent\r\nobtained by Bodmer.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, J. E. McConnell, then locomotive superintendent of the\r\nBirmingham and Gloucester Railway, determined to construct a more\r\npowerful engine for working the Lickey Incline than the American\r\nengines previously described. The “Great Britain” was the result of\r\nhis essay. She was a six-wheel coupled saddle-tank locomotive. The\r\nwheels were 3ft. 1Oin. diameter, and the cylinders 18in. by 26in.\r\nstroke. This powerful “iron-horse” easily hauled trains weighing 150\r\ntons up the Lickey Bank. McConnell also rebuilt one of the American\r\nengines, as a saddle-tank locomotive, for working the Tewkesbury branch\r\nof the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. This curious specimen of a\r\nsaddle-tank engine had outside cylinders 10½in. diameter, 20in. stroke,\r\nsingle driving wheels 4ft. diameter, and a leading bogie.\r\n\r\nMr. Dewrance, of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, about this time\r\nturned his attention to the experiments which were, ever and anon,\r\nbeing made towards the long-wished-for goal of a perfect coal-burning\r\nlocomotive. In the “Condor” he tried the effect of two fire-boxes. The\r\nfuel was inserted in the usual manner into the exterior fire-box; the\r\nsecond, or combustion chamber being designed to consume the gaseous\r\nmatter that escaped from the first furnace.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of special attention to the working of the “Condor”\r\nthis system of coal-burning appears to have been of a fairly successful\r\ncharacter. The idea of a combustion chamber as a solution of the vexed\r\nquestion of a successful smoke-consuming locomotive was afterwards\r\ntried by other locomotive designers. The division between the two\r\nfire-boxes of the “Condor” consisted of a transverse water space,\r\nfitted with short tubes. Air was admitted to the combustion chamber by\r\nmeans of a pipe, with a head perforated with small holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stephenson’s “long boiler” goods engines for the Eastern\r\n        Counties Railway—Gray’s prototype of the “Jenny\r\n        Lind”—Hackworth builds twelve of the class for the\r\n        Brighton Railway—Stephenson and Howe’s three-cylinder\r\n        locomotive not a success—The “Great A,” another Stephenson\r\n        absurdity—The competitive trials between broad and\r\n        narrow-gauge locomotives—Gooch to the rescue!-The\r\n        “Premier,” the first engine constructed at Swindon—The\r\n        “Great Western” the forerunner of the standard express\r\n        engine of to-day—Trial trip of this “mammoth”—A notable\r\n        run of the “Great Western”—The “Great Western” altered\r\n        to an eight-wheel engine—Galloway’s incline climbing\r\n        locomotive tried on the Great Western—Beyer’s “Atlas” for\r\n        the Manchester and Sheffield Railway—The Eastern Union\r\n        “Essex” draws 149 loaded goods wagons—Stephenson’s “White\r\n        Horse of Kent”—Crampton, as a locomotive designer, the\r\n        “Namur” constructed—Gooch’s “Iron Duke” and “Lord of the\r\n        Isles” make the broad-gauge still more popular—The “Jenny\r\n        Lind,” a “storm-in a tea cup”—Trial of the “Jenny Lind”\r\n        and “Jenny Sharp”—Trevithick’s “Cornwall,” a locomotive\r\n        monstrosity—Exhibited at the 1851 Exhibition—Rebuilt\r\n        in her present form, and still running—McConnell’s\r\n        “counterbalancing” experiments—The “most powerful\r\n        narrow-gauge engine ever built”—“No. 185” of the Y.N. and\r\n        B.R.—The oldest locomotive now running, “Old Coppernob,”\r\n        of the Furness Railway—“Lablache,” another locomotive\r\n        freak—“Cambrian” locomotives, and the peculiarities of\r\n        their construction—The “Albion,” of 1848—Half a century\r\n        later, the writer unearths the working drawings of this\r\n        engine and her sisters.\r\n\r\nDuring 1845 R. Stephenson and Co. built seven of their “long boiler”\r\nengines, with outside cylinders, for working the goods traffic of the\r\nEastern Counties Railway. Fig. 35 is an illustration of one of these\r\nungainly specimens of locomotive construction. The boiler barrel was\r\nno less than 13ft. 6in. in length, all the axles were beneath the\r\nbarrel, the leading wheels were 3ft. diameter, and the driving and\r\ntrailing (coupled) wheels 5ft. 9½in. diameter. The cylinders were 16in.\r\ndiameter, the stroke being 21in. In working order, these locomotives\r\nweighed 23 tons 12 cwt. After looking at the illustration, it is\r\nscarcely necessary to add that these engines were very unsteady when\r\ntravelling, the oscillation being excessive.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of inside and outside bearings to the various wheels\r\nof the patent engines, designed by John Gray for the Hull and Selby\r\nRailway (previously described), we make acquaintance with the embryo\r\ndesign, afterwards perfected, and known the whole world over as the\r\n“Jenny Lind” class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—STEPHENSON’S “LONG BOILER” GOODS ENGINE,\r\nEASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—GRAY’S PROTOTYPE OF THE “JENNY LIND,” No. 49,\r\nLONDON AND BRIGHTON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Gray had become locomotive superintendent of the Brighton\r\nRailway, and he prepared another design of express engines for\r\nthat line, in which the type now known as “Jenny Lind” was further\r\ndeveloped. J. Hackworth and Co. obtained the contract for the supply of\r\ntwelve of these locomotives, and in November, 1846, they delivered the\r\nfirst pair, numbered 53 and 54. Fig. 36 represents No. 49, one of these\r\nengines. The leading and trailing wheels were 3ft. 6in. diameter, the\r\ndrivers being 6ft. diameter. Cylinders 15in. by 24in. stroke. Heating\r\nsurface: tubes, 700 sq. ft.; fire-box, 79 sq. ft. Inside bearings\r\nwere provided to the driving, and outside to the leading and trailing\r\nwheels; the engines were fitted with Gray’s “horse-leg motion,” and\r\nseveral of the dozen had two square-seated steam domes, one located\r\non the centre of the boiler barrel, the other over the fire-box. Each\r\ndome was provided with a steam safety valve. The steam pressure was\r\n100lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nThese engines were found to be good at hauling heavy loads (as computed\r\n50 years ago) at speeds up to and slightly exceeding 40 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Stephenson and Howe obtained a patent for a three-cylindered\r\nengine. Z. Colburn, in his “Locomotive Engineering,” exposes the\r\nfallacy of the idea that the action of the steam admitted alternately\r\nto cylinders whose centres are far apart, sets up a dangerous sinuous\r\nmotion. The object of Stephenson and Howe’s three-cylinder engine was\r\nto overcome this winding motion. Colburn states that a “few pounds\r\nof counterweight would have served a better purpose than the extra\r\ncylinder and working parts.” Two engines appear to have been built on\r\nthis plan before the true cause of the rocking motion and the real way\r\nof overcoming it, were fully grasped by the patentees. The outside\r\ncylinders were only 10½in. diameter and 22in. stroke; whilst the centre\r\nor inside cylinder was 16⅜in. diameter, but the stroke in this case was\r\nrestricted to 18in. It is needless to add that these three-cylinder\r\nlocomotives were not successful.\r\n\r\nPassing reference must be made to the celebrated gauge experiments\r\nwhich took place during the last days of December, 1845, and resulted\r\nso greatly in favour of the broad-gauge, despite the fact that the\r\nGreat Western Railway had no new engines prepared for the competition,\r\nbut used those regularly in work on the broad-gauge railways.\r\n\r\nThe narrow-gauge experiments were made on the Great North of England\r\nRailway, a special engine being built for the purpose by R. Stephenson\r\nand Co., and called “A.” The “A” was a six-wheel long boiler engine,\r\nwith outside cylinders and 6ft. 6in. driving wheels. Hot water for\r\nsupplying the boiler was used on the narrow-gauge in place of cold\r\non the broad-gauge. The latter started from a state of rest, but the\r\nnarrow-gauge approached the starting-point at as great a velocity\r\nas possible; yet, notwithstanding these sharp practices of the\r\nnarrow-gauge officials, they were completely beaten in the experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Swindon Works commenced to build locomotives early in 1846; and,\r\nas its name implies, the “Premier” was the first engine constructed at\r\nthese now world-famous locomotive shops.\r\n\r\nShe was a six-coupled goods engine, with wheels 5ft. diameter.\r\n\r\nNumerous engines of this type, with slight modifications, were built at\r\nSwindon; “Hero” (Fig. 37) is a good example of the G.W. standard goods\r\nengine at the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—“HERO,” A GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY SIX-COUPLED\r\nBROAD-GAUGE GOODS ENGINE]\r\n\r\nThe narrow-gauge engineers having made frantic efforts to produce\r\nlocomotives as powerful as those in use on the Great Western Railway,\r\nthe directors of the latter company decided to have a larger and more\r\npowerful engine constructed, and Mr. Gooch received orders to construct\r\na colossal locomotive, and to have it in work before the commencement\r\nof the Parliamentary Session of 1846. From the time the decision was\r\narrived at, until the “Great Western” was at work, only 13 weeks\r\nelapsed, during which short period the design of the engine had to be\r\ndecided upon, the drawings made, the patterns prepared, and the whole\r\nof the complex machinery made and put together; yet those three months\r\nwere sufficient to produce this most famous locomotive.\r\n\r\nAs originally constructed, the “Great Western” (Fig. 38) was a\r\nsix-wheel engine, the dimensions being:—Cylinders, 18in. diameter and\r\n24in. stroke; driving wheels, 8ft. diameter; leading and trailing\r\nwheels, 4ft. 6in. diameter; 278 tubes, 9ft. long, 2in. diameter;\r\nfire-box (outside), 5ft. 6in. by 6ft., inside 4ft. 1Oin. by 5ft. 4in.,\r\nwith partition through the centre; heating surface, tubes 1,591 sq.\r\nft.; fire-box, 160 sq. ft.; grate area, 20ft.; height, from level of\r\nrail to top of boiler, 9ft. 6in.; the chimney was 5ft. 2in. high;\r\nlength of engine, 24ft.; weight (empty), 36 tons. In this engine\r\nGooch retained the Gothic fire-box, as supplied to the engines he\r\nhad previously designed. By the way, a picture, purporting to be an\r\nillustration of this engine, was given in a book on locomotive history,\r\nwith the flush top fire-box and four leading wheels! The “Great\r\nWestern” continued to work trains on the Great Western Railway until\r\nthe end of 1870, having run a total distance of 370,687 miles during\r\nthe 23¾ years she was in work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—THE “GREAT WESTERN” BROAD-GAUGE ENGINE AS\r\nORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, June 13th, 1846, the “mammoth” locomotive (as the “Great\r\nWestern” was usually called) made a sensational trip from London to\r\nBristol and back, and, but for the failure of one of the six-feed\r\npumps, necessitating slower running, even better results would have\r\nbeen attained. But, despite the accident, the result of the trip came\r\nlike a “bolt from the blue” upon the narrow-gauge engineers.\r\n\r\nThe train weighed 100 tons, and consisted of ten first-class carriages,\r\nseven of which were ballasted with iron, the other three being occupied\r\nby the directors and those interested in the experiment. The train\r\nstarted from Paddington at 11 hours 47 minutes 52 seconds; at Didcot\r\na stop of 5¼ minutes was made; Swindon was reached in 78 minutes.\r\nAfter staying there 4 minutes 27 seconds, the journey was continued\r\nto Bristol, the whole distance of 118½ miles being covered in 2 hours\r\n12 minutes, or at the rate of 54 miles an hour, or, excluding the 9¾\r\nminutes spent in the two stoppages, at about 59 miles an hour for the\r\ncomplete journey, including the slowing down and getting up speed again\r\non three occasions. The maximum speed was obtained between the 82nd\r\nand 92nd mile-posts (from the 80th to the 85th mile there is a falling\r\ngradient of 8ft. per mile, and from the 85½th to about the 86½th mile\r\nthere is a falling gradient of about 1 in 100, and a fall of 8ft. per\r\nmile then reaches to about the 90½th mile-post; a rising gradient of\r\n8ft. per mile then succeeds and extends beyond the 92nd mile-post),\r\nperforming the ten miles in 9 minutes and 8 seconds, or at an average\r\nspeed of nearly 66 miles an hour. The 87th and 88th miles, on a falling\r\ngradient of 8ft. per mile, were run over at a rate of 69 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOne Monday early in June, 1846, the “Great Western” was attached to\r\nthe 9.45 a.m. express Paddington to Exeter, the crack train of that\r\ntime, which, indeed, continued to be the fastest ordinary passenger\r\ntrain until the establishment of the “Flying Dutchman” many years\r\nlater. When it was advertised that this train would perform the journey\r\nbetween London and Exeter in 4½ hours, people said it was impossible;\r\nwhat, then, must have been thought of the run performed by the “Great\r\nWestern” and chronicled below? The 193¾ miles from Paddington to Exeter\r\nwere covered in 214 minutes (3 hours 34 minutes) running time, being\r\nan average rate of 55¼ miles per hour. The actual running time on the\r\njourney was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    From Paddington to Didcot          53  miles         55 minutes\r\n      ”  Didcot to Swindon             24    ”           30    ”\r\n      ”  Swindon to Bath               29¾   ”           33    ”\r\n      ”  Bath to Bristol               11½   ”           14    ”\r\n      ”  Bristol to Taunton            44¾   ”           45    ”\r\n      ”  Taunton to Exeter             30¾   ”           37    ”\r\n                                     ------            -----\r\n                                      193¾              214\r\n\r\nThe return journey was performed in less time, and could have been\r\naccomplished with ease at a rate exceeding 60 miles an hour The actual\r\nrunning time, exclusive of stoppages, was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    From Exeter to Taunton             30¾ miles         34 minutes\r\n      ”  Taunton to Bristol            44¾   ”           43    ”\r\n      ”  Bristol to Bath               11½   ”           14    ”\r\n      ”  Bath to Swindon               29¾   ”           34    ”\r\n      ”  Swindon to Didcot             24    ”           26    ”\r\n      ”  Didcot to Paddington          53    ”           56    ”\r\n                                     ------             -----\r\n                               Miles, 193¾      Minutes, 208\r\n\r\nAfter the engine had been running a short time, Gooch found the weight\r\non the leading axle too much to be safely carried by one axle, and he\r\nfitted another pair of leading wheels to the “Great Western” (Fig.\r\n39), making her an eight-wheeled engine, having a group of four wheels\r\nin front of the driving wheels. It must be remembered that these four\r\nwheels were not affixed to a bogie frame. So well satisfied were the\r\ndirectors of the Great Western Railway with the “Great Western” that\r\n29 more engines of almost similar design (except the domed fire-box)\r\nwere constructed during the next eight years, and these engines, with\r\na few of the same design, built at a more recent period, worked the\r\nfamous broad-gauge expresses between London and Newton Abbot until the\r\nabolition of the broad-gauge in May, 1892.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—THE ORIGINAL “GREAT WESTERN” AS REBUILT WITH\r\nTWO PAIRS OF LEADING WHEELS]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1847, the Great Western Railway laid down a length of line\r\nat Maidenhead for the purpose of testing Elijah Galloway’s system of\r\nlocomotive propulsion with horizontal driving wheels. The horizontal\r\nwheels gripped a centre rail, and the engine not being dependent upon\r\nthe weight placed upon the driving wheels for adhesion, was enabled to\r\nascend inclines that were impossible for ordinary locomotives; whilst\r\nthe fact that the two horizontal driving wheels were pressing one\r\non either side of the centre rail enabled the engine to safely pass\r\nround curves of extremely short radii, such as would be impossible\r\nwith ordinary locomotives. The line put down at Maidenhead was on an\r\nincline of 1 in 19, but a model engine and train successfully ascended\r\nan incline of 1 in 6. Mr. D. Gooch gave the following account of the\r\nexperiments:—\r\n\r\n    “Engineer’s Office, Paddington,\r\n    “March 25th, 1847.\r\n\r\n    “The following is the result of the experiment I made with\r\n    Mr. Galloway’s locomotive engine, in which the driving wheels are\r\n    placed horizontally, and act against the sides of a centre rail:—\r\n\r\n         Weight of engine     20  tons.\r\n         Weight of load       13½   ”\r\n                              ----\r\n                              33½ tons.\r\n\r\n    “This weight was taken at a slow speed up an incline of 1 in 19,\r\n    with a pressure on the boiler of 60lb. on the inch, and calculating\r\n    the power of the engine and actual duty performed, we have as\r\n    follows: —With steam at 60lb. in the boiler, the average effective\r\n    pressure on the pistons, after deducting back pressure, will be\r\n    about 50lb. on the inch, then the area of the two cylinders\r\n\r\n                       308 × 50 = 15,400lb.,\r\n\r\n    and double stroke of piston equals 32in., and circumference of\r\n    driving wheel 116in.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, as 116in. : 15,400 :: 32 : 4,248 tractive power on the\r\n    rim of the wheel,\r\n\r\n    And gravity per ton, 1 in 19        = 118 lb.\r\n    Friction ditto                        7 lb.\r\n                                        ----------\r\n                        125 × 33·5 tons = 4,187·5 lb.\r\n                            resistance overcome.\r\n\r\n    therefore, 4,248 - 4,187 = 61lb., the total loss from the friction of\r\n    the working parts of the engine, which I think, is as small a loss as\r\n    can be hoped for in any class of engines, and from the facility of\r\n    applying screws to increase the weight on the driving wheels to any\r\n    required amount, there is no difficulty from slipping.\r\n\r\n                                    “(Signed)  DANIEL GOOCH.”\r\n\r\nThe “Atlas,” constructed for the Manchester and Sheffield Railway,\r\ndeserves notice. She was built by Sharp Bros. and Co., from the designs\r\nof Mr. Beyer, their then chief engineer, but afterwards head of the\r\nwell-known firm of locomotive builders, Beyer, Peacock and Co., of\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nThe “Atlas” commenced work in May, 1846, and during the succeeding 17\r\nmonths she travelled 40,222 miles, with a coke consumption of 36.53lb.\r\nper mile, although engaged in hauling heavy goods trains. The engine\r\nhad inside cylinders, 18in. diameter, 24in. stroke; the whole of the\r\nframing and bearings were inside the wheels; the boiler was 13ft. 6in.\r\nlong and 3ft. 6in. diameter, and contained 175 brass tubes of 1⅝ in.\r\nexternal diameter; the wheels were cast-iron, 4ft. 6in. diameter; a\r\ncopper fire-box was provided, its inside measurements being 3ft. 8in.\r\nlong, 3ft. 3½in. wide, and 3ft. 4½in. from the fire-bars to the top.\r\nThe water space around the fire-box was 3in., and a mid-feather, 4in.\r\nwide, divided the fire-box.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were secured to each other by internal flanges, which\r\nformed the bottom of the smoke-box, and also the chief cross-stay\r\nbetween the frames. The valves were in one chest, located below the\r\ncylinders, and inclined towards each other. The weight of the valves\r\nwas carried by spindles working through stuffing-boxes. The regulator\r\nwas provided with two perforated discs, so that the steam was admitted\r\nvery gradually, the volume increasing as the two sets of perforations\r\ncame opposite each other.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the “Atlas” was 24 tons, and five other engines of\r\nexactly similar designs were supplied to the Manchester and Sheffield\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nAnother engine of the same description was supplied to the Manchester\r\nand Birmingham Railway, and on October 3rd, 1836, “No. 30” hauled a\r\ntrain of 101 wagons, weighing 597 tons, from Longsight to Crewe, a\r\ndistance of 29 miles, at the average speed of 13.7 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe mention of a powerful engine and a record train on one railway\r\nnaturally suggests a better one on another line, so we have the “Essex”\r\ngoing “one better” than “No. 30.”\r\n\r\nThis time we have a load of 149 loaded wagons (probably equal to 890\r\ntons), and forming a train nearly half a mile long. The “Essex” is\r\nalso stated to have hauled a train of 192 empty trucks. The engine\r\nin question was built for the Eastern Union Railway by Stothart,\r\nSlaughter, and Co., Bristol, in 1847, and had wheels 4ft. 9in.\r\ndiameter, cylinders 15in. by 24in. stroke, weight 22 tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Stephenson and Co. supplied the South Eastern Railway with\r\nan engine called the “White Horse of Kent” (the “White Elephant of\r\nNewcastle” would have been a far more descriptive name). This engine\r\nprobably exhibited the “long boiler” folly in a more marked manner\r\nthan any other engine of that notorious class. She was 21ft. 10in.\r\nlong, with a wheel base of only 10ft. 3¼in.! She had cylinders 15in.\r\nby 22in. stroke, 5ft. 6in. driving wheels, and weighed 18¾ tons. Gooch\r\nsays this engine was so unsteady that it was necessary to be tied on to\r\nmake experiments on the smoke-box temperature, and that the tubes were\r\nso long that one end of the engine was actually condensing the steam\r\ngenerated at the other end!\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. T. R. Crampton turned his attention to locomotive\r\nconstruction, and patented a design of locomotive. He claimed for his\r\ndesign the following advantages—viz., a reduction of the rocking and\r\nvibrating motion, obtained by lowering the centre of gravity, and by\r\nlocating the greater portion of the weight between the supports; an\r\nincreased heating surface; and a superiority of arrangement of the\r\nworking parts, the whole of which were placed immediately under the eye\r\nof the driver.\r\n\r\nThe first engine constructed on this principle was the “Namur” (Fig.\r\n40), built under Crampton’s patent by Tulk and Ley, of the Lowcra\r\nWorks, Whitehaven, for the Namur and Liège Railway.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows that the chief peculiarity of the “Namur” was\r\nthe position of the driving wheels, the axle of which was behind the\r\nfire-box, so that the axle extended across the foot-plate. One spring,\r\nformed of plates, also extended across the back of the fire-box,\r\nparallel with and above the driving axle, and acting upon it at the\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nThe chimney was 6ft. 6in. high; the smoke-box was very narrow, being\r\nno wider than the diameter of the chimney; all the wheels had inside\r\nbearings; the cylinders were outside, and horizontal; the valve chests\r\nwere on the outer side of the cylinders, so that the eccentrics were at\r\nthe extreme ends of the axles, beyond the wheels, and quite exposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—THE “NAMUR,” THE FIRST ENGINE BUILT ON\r\nCRAMPTON’S PRINCIPLE]\r\n\r\nThe boiler barrel was surmounted by an immense fluted dome, which was\r\nfitted with two lever safety valves, whilst a third one, of the spring\r\npattern, was provided on the fire-box casing.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal dimensions of the “Namur”:—\r\n\r\nDiameter of driving wheels, 7ft.; diameter of leading and middle\r\nwheels, 3ft. 9in.; total wheel base, 13ft.; cylinders, 16in. diameter,\r\n20in. stroke; number of tubes, 182—length 11ft., external diameter\r\n2in.; fire-box, 4ft. 3in. long, 3ft. 5in. wide; area of fire-tube,\r\n14ft. 6in.; heating surface: fire-box 62ft., tubes 927ft., total 989ft.\r\n\r\nThe engine was completed early in February, 1847, and previous to its\r\nexportation, it was tried for several weeks on the London and North\r\nWestern Railway, running over 2,300 miles. All classes of traffic were\r\nhauled by the engine, and she gave general satisfaction. A speed of 75\r\nmiles an hour was attained between Willesden and Harrow, when running\r\n“light.” On another occasion, 50 miles an hour was attained on a trip\r\nfrom Camden Town to Wolverton with a coke train, weighing 50 tons,\r\nbetween Tring and Wolverton.\r\n\r\nThe “Namur” weighed 22 tons, of which 7½ tons were on the leading\r\nwheels, 4 tons on the centre wheels, and 10½ tons on the driving wheels.\r\n\r\nThe L. and N.W.R. were so satisfied with the “Namur” that Tulk and Ley\r\nwere instructed to build a Crampton engine for that railway; and the\r\n“London” (Fig. 41) was produced in 1848 in response to this order. She\r\nwas the first engine on the southern division of the L. and N.W.R. to\r\nhave a name. The driving wheels were 8ft. diameter, the cylinders 18in.\r\ndiameter and 20in. stroke. The boiler was oval in shape, its vertical\r\ndiameter being 4ft. 8in., and its horizontal diameter 3ft. 10in. The\r\nheating surface was 1,350 sq. ft. The fire-box extended below the\r\ndriving axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—CRAMPTON’S “LONDON,” THE FIRST ENGINE WITH A\r\nNAME ON THE SOUTHERN DIVISION OF THE L. & N.W.R.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—“GREAT BRITAIN,” ONE OF GOOCH’S FAMOUS 8FT.\r\n“SINGLE” BROAD-GAUGE ENGINES FOR THE G.W.R.]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1847, Mr. D. Gooch’s famous broad-gauge express engine,\r\n“Iron Duke,” commenced to run. Fig. 42 represents an engine of this\r\nclass. She was the first of a set of twenty-nine locomotives of almost\r\nsimilar construction, designed to work the Great Western express\r\ntrains. The “Iron Duke” was an improvement on the celebrated “Great\r\nWestern,” previously described; the most noticeable difference was the\r\nabsence of the domed fire-box in the “Iron Duke.” The total mileage of\r\nthis engine, up to October, 1871, when it was withdrawn from service,\r\namounted to 607,412 miles. The best-known engine of the class is\r\n“Lord of the Isles,” built at Swindon in 1850, and exhibited at the\r\nInternational Exhibition, London, 1851; she commenced to run July,\r\n1852, and continued in active service on the Great Western Railway for\r\n29 years, during which time 789,300 miles were covered by the “Lord of\r\nthe Isles.” This famous broad-gauge locomotive is still preserved by\r\nthe Great Western Railway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—“No. 61,” LONDON AND BRIGHTON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe next point in the evolution of the locomotive that deserves\r\nattention is the famous class of engines known as the “Jenny Lind”\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning these engines during recent years,\r\nand many uncorroborated and absurd statements have been made; but it\r\nwas most clearly demonstrated that to Mr. David Joy was due the chief\r\nhonour of designing the successful class of locomotive known far and\r\nnear as “Jenny Linds.” Such a design was elaborated from the adoption\r\nof the best features of the several descriptions of locomotives then in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe first of the type of engine afterwards known as the “Jenny Lind”\r\nclass was constructed for the London and Brighton Railway by E. B.\r\nWilson and Co., Railway Foundry, Leeds, and was commenced building in\r\nNovember, 1846, and completed in May, 1847. The principal features of\r\nthe engines may be summarised as follows:—Steam pressure 120lb. per\r\nsquare inch, inside bearings to driving and outside bearings to the\r\nleading and trailing wheels, outside frames, outside pumps located\r\nbetween the driving and trailing wheels, and worked by cranks fixed on\r\nthe outside of the driving axles. The engine had a raised fire-box; the\r\ndome was fluted and had a square seating; the safety valve was enclosed\r\nwithin a fluted column, and fixed on the fire-box.\r\n\r\nPolished mahogany lagging was used for both the boiler and fire-box,\r\nthe same being secured by bright brass hoops. The tops of the safety\r\nvalves and dome were bright copper. The first trip of the “Jenny Lind”\r\nwas from Leeds to Wakefield and back. Ten engines of this class were\r\nsupplied to the London and Brighton Railway, and were numbered 61 (Fig.\r\n43) to 70. The principal dimensions were:—Driving wheels 6ft. diameter;\r\nleading and trailing wheels, 4ft. diameter; cylinders (inside), 15in.\r\ndiameter, 20in. stroke; boiler, 11ft. long, 3ft. 8in. diameter; 124\r\ntubes, 2in. diameter. A water space of 3in. was left between the inner\r\nand outer shells of the fire-box. Heating surface, tubes 700 sq. ft.,\r\nfire-box 80 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nIt is significant to note that in the original description of the\r\n“Jenny Lind,” published in 1848, we are informed that “in establishing\r\nthis class of engine Messrs. Wilson have studied less the introduction\r\nof dangerous novelties than the judicious combination of isolated\r\nexamples of well-tried conveniences.” This statement exactly agrees\r\nwith those recently made by Mr. Joy.\r\n\r\nThe great success of the “Jenny Lind” type caused Sharp Bros. and Co.\r\nto introduce a rival class of engines nicknamed “Jenny Sharps.”\r\n\r\nThe engines were provided with a mid-feather in the fire-box for the\r\npurpose of augmenting the heating surface. The principal dimensions of\r\nthe “Jenny Sharps” were as follow:—Steam pressure, 80lb.; cylinders,\r\n16in. diameter, 20in. stroke; driving wheels, 5ft. 6in. diameter;\r\nheating surface, tubes (of which there were 161, each 10ft. long and\r\n2in. diameter) 847 sq. ft., fire-box, 72 sq. ft.; total, 919 sq. ft.\r\nMr. Kirtley, the locomotive superintendent of the Midland Railway,\r\narranged a trial between the rival “Jennies,” and the event came off on\r\nMay 4th, 5th, and 6th, 1848.\r\n\r\nSharp’s engines were Nos. 60 and 61, and Wilson’s Nos. 26 and 27. The\r\nfirst trip was with a load of 64 tons, made up of nine carriages and\r\ntwo brake-vans, weighted with iron chairs to 64 tons.\r\n\r\nSharp’s No. 60 took the first train, the weight being, engine 21 tons\r\n9 cwt., tender 12 tons 11 cwt., load 64 tons; total, 98 tons, or,\r\nincluding officials, etc., about 100 tons.\r\n\r\nThe journey was from Derby to Masborough, 40¼ miles, the line rising\r\nfor the first 20 miles at about 1 in 330, and falling for the remainder\r\nof the distance at about the same rate. The weather was fine, the\r\nmetals dry, and there was no wind.\r\n\r\nWilliam Huskinson drove the train, which left Darby at 3h. 39min. 5½\r\nsec. p.m., and arrived at Masborough at 4.28 p.m. Among the passengers\r\nwere Messrs. Kirtley, locomotive superintendent; Marlow, assistant\r\nlocomotive superintendent; Harland, carriage superintendent; E. B.\r\nWilson and Fenton, of the firm of E. B. Wilson and Co.; and T. R.\r\nCrampton.\r\n\r\nThe first 18 miles up the bank of 1 in 330 were covered in 25 minutes\r\n12½ seconds, being at an average speed of nearly 43 miles an hour.\r\nBefore starting, the water in the tender had been heated to nearly\r\nboiling point; 16 cwt. of coke were consumed, or 44.8lb. per mile;\r\n10,290lb. of water were evaporated, equal to 5.7lb. of water to 1lb. of\r\ncoke.\r\n\r\nWilson’s engine, No. 27, was next tried. She weighed 24 tons 1 cwt.,\r\nand her tender, loaded, 15 tons 13 cwt., the total load with train\r\nthus being 103 tons 14 cwt. William Carter drove the train, which left\r\nDerby at 7h. 10min. 20sec., and arrived at Masborough at 7h. 56min.\r\n42sec., the speed averaging 52 miles an hour. The first 18 miles were\r\nnegotiated in 22 minutes. 44¾ seconds, or at nearly 47 miles an hour.\r\nOnly 13 cwt. of coke was used, equalling 36.4lb. per mile.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the working of the two engines up the bank to\r\nthe seventeenth mile-post:—\r\n\r\n                 “Jenny          “Jenny\r\n                 Sharp.”         Lind.”\r\n    Mile        Miles per     Miles per\r\n    Post.          hour.          hour.\r\n\r\n      1            21.6            21.9\r\n      2            39.6            44.5\r\n      3            42.0            51.0\r\n      4            42.5            51.4\r\n      5            45.4            51.4\r\n      6            46.8            51.2\r\n      7            44.5            48.9\r\n      8            46.2            50.0\r\n      9            47.0            52.5\r\n     10            46.8            52.0\r\n     11            45.9            51.4\r\n     12            45.9            53.3\r\n     13            45.6            52.7\r\n     14            46.6            51.8\r\n     15              —             51.8\r\n     16            48.0            51.4\r\n     17            47.0            51.8\r\n\r\nTrials were then made with trains of 17 coaches, weighted to 99 tons\r\n16 cwt.

We have given\r\nthe real facts in connection with the original “Jenny Linds” at some\r\nlength, for the purpose of placing on permanent record the details of\r\nthese capital locomotives, and so prevent our readers and students\r\nof locomotive history generally from being misled by the absurdly\r\ninaccurate romances that have, for some obscure purpose, been recently\r\ncirculated concerning the “Jenny Lind.” (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—THE “JENNY LIND,” A FAMOUS LOCOMOTIVE BUILT BY\r\nWILSON AND CO., LEEDS, IN 1846.]\r\n\r\nThe original design of the locomotive now to be described is so\r\nsingular that we are reminded of the extravagant examples of locomotive\r\nconstruction appertaining to 1830, or thereabouts, rather than to the\r\nyear how under review. Yet, strange as it may appear, the “Cornwall”\r\n(Fig. 45) is still running express trains, although it must be\r\nconfessed it has undergone a complete metamorphosis since it was\r\nbuilt at Crewe in 1847. The engine in question was designed by Mr.\r\nF. Trevithick, son of the famous “father of the locomotive,” and was\r\nintended to be a narrow-gauge improvement on Gooch’s famous “Great\r\nWestern,” as Trevithick wished to build a locomotive that would be able\r\nto attain a higher rate of speed than the renowned broad-gauge engine.\r\nTo do this, he considered an increase of the diameter of the driving\r\nwheels a _sine qua non_. He therefore constructed the “Cornwall” with\r\ndriving wheels 8ft. 6in. in diameter. His next proposition was that as\r\n8ft. was then considered the limit of size for driving wheels on the\r\nbroad-gauge, with the boiler above the driving axle, it was necessary\r\nto place the boiler below the driving axle with wheels 8ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter on the narrow-gauge. And, therefore, Trevithick constructed\r\nthe “Cornwall,” with underhung boilers, i.e., beneath the driving axle.\r\nThe cylinders were outside, 17½in. diameter, with a stroke of 24in. The\r\nheating surface was 1,046 sq. ft. The locomotive was carried on eight\r\nwheels—a group of four leading wheels, the driving, and a single pair\r\nof trailing wheels. Weight of engine in working order, 27 tons. The\r\n“Cornwall” was very successful in attaining high rates of speed, and,\r\nindeed, far exceeded Trevithick’s expectations in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that she attained a speed equal to 117 miles an\r\nhour down the Madeley Bank. Such a statement must be accepted with\r\nreserve—not that the _bonâ fides_ of the engineer who made it are\r\ndoubted, but rather because of the difficulty of obtaining correctly\r\nthe exact speed of engines when travelling at a great rate, even when\r\nproper instruments are employed. We know that with an ordinary watch\r\ncorrect results are almost impossible, and an error of a second or two\r\nwhen calculating a quarter of a mile will make a very great difference\r\nwhen arriving at the approximate rates in miles per hour. However,\r\nbe this as it may, it is generally acknowledged that the “Cornwall”\r\nattained speeds that may fairly be called phenomenally high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—TREVITHICK’S “CORNWALL.” WITH 8FT. 6IN. DRIVING\r\nWHEELS, AND BOILER BELOW THE DRIVING AXLE]\r\n\r\nOn November 9th, 1847, the “Cornwall” was hauling a goods train from\r\nLiverpool, and upon rounding the curve near Winsford Station, ran\r\ninto a coal train, the result being the death of the driver of the\r\n“Cornwall,” the engine being thrown across both lines, whilst the\r\ntender and trucks were projected over the engine, and did not come to a\r\nstandstill for several yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo F. Moore\r\n\r\nFIG. 46.—TREVITHICK’S 8FT. 6IN. “SINGLE” LOCOMOTIVE, “CORNWALL,” AS\r\nNOW RUNNING ON THE L. & N.W.R. BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER]\r\n\r\nThe “Cornwall” was one of the features of the first International\r\nExhibition (held in Hyde Park, London, in 1851). In 1862 Mr. J.\r\nRamsbottom rebuilt the “Cornwall,” and placed her new boiler over\r\nthe driving wheels. She was numbered “173,” and still works the\r\nthree-quarter-of-an-hour express trains between Liverpool and\r\nManchester. She completed her jubilee of active service last year, and\r\nis still running. The present number of the “Cornwall” is “3020,” and\r\nshe is now only a six-wheeled engine.\r\n\r\nMcConnell made an experiment in counterbalancing a locomotive on the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway in 1848. The engine in question was\r\nthe “Snake,” No. 175, built by Jones and Potts on Stephenson’s long\r\nboiler principle. McConnell’s plan was to provide a connecting-rod\r\nattached to a block working between slide bars, on the opposite side of\r\nthe driving axle to that on which the piston, etc., were located. By\r\nthis method he considered that, providing his extra rod-block, etc.,\r\nweighed the same as the pistons and other reciprocating parts, he had\r\nattained a perfect method of counterbalancing. The result was a rude\r\ndisillusion of the idea, and a complete wreckage of both the theory and\r\nthe “Snake,” the engine breaking down on its first trip, after being\r\nfitted with this reciprocating counterbalance. The only result of such\r\nan addition to the “Snake” was an increase in the weight of the engine\r\nand an augmentation of the friction and axle strains.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848 McConnell built an engine which he expected “to\r\nprove the most powerful narrow-gauge engine ever yet built.”\r\n\r\nIt had outside cylinders 18in. diameter, and 7ft. 6in. between centres.\r\nThe driving wheels were 6ft. diameter, leading and trailing 3ft. 10in.\r\nThe boiler was 4ft. 3in. external diameter, 12ft. 7in. long, and\r\ncontained 190 tubes of 2in. diameter. Height of top of boiler from rail\r\nlevel, 7ft. 9in.\r\n\r\nThe fire-box was 5ft. 9¼in. wide, by 5ft. 5in. long, and of the same\r\nheight. The wheel base was as follows:—Leading to driving, 6ft. 8in.;\r\ndriving to trailing, 10ft. 6in.\r\n\r\nAnother combination design in locomotive practice is to be found in\r\nengine “No. 185,” delivered to the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway\r\non October 3rd, 1848, by R. Stephenson and Co.\r\n\r\nThis engine had inside cylinders, but outside valve gearing and\r\neccentrics. The cylinders were 16in. diameter, with 20in. stroke. The\r\nboiler was 3ft. 10in. diameter and 11ft. long; there were 174 tubes,\r\n1⅞in. outside diameter, and 11ft. long; the heating surface being:\r\ntubes, 964 sq. ft.; fire-box, 82 sq. ft. The driving wheels were 6ft.\r\n6in. diameter, the leading and trailing being 3ft. 9in. diameter.\r\nInside bearings were provided for the driving wheels and outside\r\nbearings for the leading and trailing wheels. Inside and outside\r\niron-plate frames, 1in. thick and 8in. deep, were provided. This engine\r\nweighed 22 tons in working order, and consumed 18lb. of coke per mile\r\nwith express trains of four carriages. The peculiar feature of “No.\r\n185” was the vertical valves, worked by eccentrics outside the driving\r\nwheels; the pumps were also worked off the same eccentrics, and were\r\nconsequently outside, as in the “Jenny Lind” design. The exhaust ports\r\nwere below the cylinders, the pipes from which united at the blast\r\norifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—“OLD COPPER NOB,” No. 3, FURNESS RAILWAY, THE\r\nOLDEST LOCOMOTIVE NOW AT WORK]\r\n\r\nLocomotives that attain their “jubilee” of active service are indeed\r\nvery few and far between, and it redounds much to the honour of the\r\nlate firm of Bury, Curtis and Kennedy, of the Clarence Foundry,\r\nLiverpool, that locomotives constructed by them in the year 1846 are\r\nstill engaged in hauling trains on an English railway.\r\n\r\nThis firm of builders ceased to exist 46 years ago, but engines Nos.\r\n3 (Fig. 47) and 4 of the Furness Railway are continuing monuments of\r\nthe good material and sound workmanship of Bury, Curtis and Kennedy.\r\nThe locomotives in question are mounted on four wheels (coupled) of\r\n4ft. 9in. diameter, the cylinders are 14in. diameter, and stroke 24in.,\r\nthe valves being between the cylinders. The wheel base is 7ft. 6in.\r\nThe boiler is 11ft. 2in. long, with a mean diameter of 3ft. 8in., and\r\ncontains 136 tubes of 2in. diameter, the total heating surface being\r\n940 sq. ft. Steam pressure, 110lb. The tenders are carried on four\r\nwheels of 3ft. diameter, the wheel base being 6ft. 9in. The tank holds\r\n1,000 gallons of water, and the coal space is 100 cubic feet. The\r\nengines weigh 20 tons each, and the tenders 13 tons each.\r\n\r\nThe prominent “Bury” features—bar framing and round back fire-boxes\r\nwith dome tops—are, of course, _en évidence_.\r\n\r\nThe chimneys appear abnormally high when viewed side by side with\r\nmodern engines; whilst the pair of Salter safety valves with long\r\nhorizontal arms, the one reaching from the centre to the back of the\r\nfire-box, and its fellow continuing to the front, are also noticeable\r\nobjects. These engines are usually employed in shunting goods trains\r\nin the Barrow Docks and goods yards, and are locally called the “old\r\ncopper nobs.”\r\n\r\nTwo further peculiarities of these Bury engines are worth\r\nrecording—viz., the splashers, which are extended in a curious way over\r\nthe rear of the wheels, and reach within a few inches of the rails, and\r\nthe round “old copper nobs.”\r\n\r\nThe period under review was a time of considerable competition between\r\nthe rival gauges, and this competition naturally led to the projection\r\nof various extraordinary designs in locomotive construction, such\r\ndesigns being the results of the efforts made by the narrow-gauge\r\nengineers to equal the splendid broad-gauge locomotives then recently\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks of 1848 E. Wilson and Co., of the Railway\r\nFoundry, Leeds, turned out a remarkable specimen of locomotive\r\nconstruction; the engine in question was named “Lablache” (after a\r\ncelebrated singer). This locomotive had two inside cylinders 16in.\r\ndiameter, 20in. stroke, and was supported on four wheels each 7ft.\r\ndiameter; the wheel base was 16ft.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to describe the mode of working introduced into the\r\n“Lablache.” Between the two pairs of wheels was a straight bar, or\r\nshaft, extending under the boiler, parallel with the axles, and\r\nprojecting on each side beyond the frames. Between the frames two\r\nlevers were attached to this shaft, and the other extremities of these\r\nlevers were attached to the pistons by the usual piston-rod and\r\nconnecting-rods. Now comes the difference in working; the driving\r\naxle, it will be observed, was not cranked, but provided with arms.\r\nThe axle did not revolve, but simply vibrated backwards and forwards.\r\nOutside the frames were double-ended levers, one end being coupled\r\nto a crank on the leading wheel, and the opposite end connected in a\r\nsimilar manner to the trailing wheels. The wheels on both sides of\r\nthe locomotive were connected in the same way that a rotary motion\r\nis communicated to a lathe by a treadle. When first constructed\r\nindia-rubber springs were provided for this engine’s bearings.\r\n\r\nAnother engine of a similar design was built, but much lighter. It ran\r\nupon the York, Newcastle, and Berwick line for some years. We may say\r\nthat no other engine on this system was ever built. With a train of\r\nthree carriages, an average speed of 75 miles an hour is said to have\r\nbeen maintained between Rugby and Leicester. This was, however, due\r\nto the high pressure of the steam. Upon another occasion 80 miles an\r\nhour was attained; and the engine hauled a train of 53 loaded wagons,\r\nweighing 430 tons, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour. After some\r\nlittle time, the fire-box of the “Lablache” was destroyed, and she was\r\nthen returned to the Railway Foundry, and altered into a four-coupled\r\nengine of the usual type, and sold to a railway contractor.\r\n\r\nAnother locomotive of peculiar design now deserves notice. At a first\r\nglance it might be supposed that the “Albion” was propelled on the same\r\nprinciple as the “Lablache” previously described. Such is not, however,\r\nthe case, the machinery being of an entirely different character. We\r\nhave been fortunate enough to secure the original working drawings\r\nof the “Albion” and the three other engines constructed on the same\r\nmethod, designated the “Cambrian” system. A patent for this method\r\nof working steam engines was obtained in 1841 by Mr. John Jones, of\r\nBristol, and applied to stationary engines.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the _modus operandi_ is as follows:—A central\r\nshaft is provided, extending under the boiler of the locomotive and\r\nprojecting beyond the frames on both sides. Between the frames the\r\nshaft passes through a segmental cylinder, within which and fitted to\r\nthe shaft was a species of disc piston, made to vibrate throughout the\r\nlength of the hollow segment of the cylinder. It will, therefore, be\r\nobserved that the motion was obtained from a vibrating disc engine, the\r\nblades of which were fixed on the driving shaft; the difference between\r\nWilson’s locomotive and the ones we are now describing being that the\r\nformer was actuated by two horizontal engines working a rocking shaft\r\nby connecting-rods, whilst the latter were driven by a disc engine,\r\nfixed directly upon the rocking-shaft. The arrangement for connecting\r\nthe driving wheels with the shaft was very similar in both classes of\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nThe premier “Cambrian” locomotive was named “Albion” (Fig. 48), and\r\nwas built in 1848 by Messrs. Thwaites Bros., of the Vulcan Foundry,\r\nBradford. She was a six-wheel engine, the leading and middle pairs of\r\nwheels both receiving motion by means of the connecting-rods from the\r\noutside levers attached to the driving shaft. The top of the fire-box\r\nwas considerably above the level of the top of the boiler barrel. Upon\r\nthis raised fire-box was fitted a steam dome with a square seating,\r\nabove the dome was an enclosed Salter pattern safety valve.\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of the “Albion” were:—Leading and driving\r\nwheels, 5ft. 6in. diameter, and trailing, 3ft. 9in. diameter; wheel\r\nbase—leading to driving, 9ft. 6in.; driving to trailing, 5ft. 8in.;\r\nboiler, 12ft. long, containing 149 tubes; throw of cranks, 20in.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the “Albion” was fitted with the “link”\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe patentee claimed the following advantages for locomotives built\r\non the “Cambrian” system—viz., perfect balance of working parts, thus\r\nentirely doing away with the centre pressure and strain; the complete\r\navoidance of all dangerous oscillation; the ends of the oscillating\r\nlevers, in passing through the greater part of a circle, gained\r\nincreased power at the extremities of the stroke, and so compensated\r\nfor the loss of power in the cranks as they approached the dead centres.\r\n\r\nThis is explained by observing that as the lever approaches the\r\nextremities of the stroke the actual length diminishes, and becomes\r\nfrom 18in. to 17¾in., 16in., 15½in., 14in., and 13¼in. at the centres,\r\nso that the power of the lever increases in proportion to its\r\ndiminution in length.\r\n\r\nThe wear and tear of the machinery was less than in an ordinary\r\nlocomotive, there being fewer working parts, whilst the centre of\r\ngravity was considerably lowered.\r\n\r\nThe above advantages summarised amounted to the advantages of the\r\nlong-stroke crank without a long-stroke cylinder, and consequently the\r\nabsence of a high-piston velocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—THE “ALBION,” A LOCOMOTIVE BUILT ON THE\r\n“CAMBRIAN” SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nThe “Albion” made its initial trip in June, 1848, the length of line\r\nselected being from Bradford to Skipton, on the Leeds and Bradford\r\nRailway; the distance was about 18 miles. The speed attained and\r\nthe low fuel consumption are stated to have more than satisfied the\r\nbuilders and others concerned. The “Albion” was afterwards tried on\r\nthe Midland Railway between Derby and Birmingham, and the result of\r\nthese trials showed that the coke consumption was 5lb. per mile less\r\nthan with the ordinary locomotives, although the trains hauled were\r\nof greater weight than usual. We have been unable to obtain further\r\ndetails of the working of this interesting locomotive. The patentee\r\nappears to have sent details of the duties performed by the “Albion”\r\nto the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1849; but these were not\r\nprinted in the “Proceedings,” nor is the Secretary of the Institution\r\nnow able to find any trace of the papers in question among the archives\r\nof the Institution. Messrs. Thwaites Bros., the builders, inform\r\nus that about 30 years ago the engine in question was working at\r\nPenistone, near Sheffield, and that she was afterwards taken over by\r\nthe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the locomotive department of that railway does not\r\nappear to have preserved any particulars relating to the “Cambrian”\r\nlocomotive after it came into the possession of the Manchester,\r\nSheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.\r\n\r\nThe other three engines with “Cambrian” machinery were tank\r\nlocomotives. Two of these were propelled in a similar manner to the\r\n“Albion,” the segmental cylinder being below the frames, and located\r\nbetween the driving and leading wheels, both pairs of which were 5ft.\r\n3in. diameter, the trailing wheels being 3ft. 9in. diameter. One of\r\nthese two tank engines had a raised fire-box, similar to that of the\r\n“Albion”; but the other had a “Gothic” fire-box, with the wood lagging\r\nexposed to view. The other features of the former were a boiler 12ft.\r\nlong, and a steam dome on the fire-box, fitted with two Salter safety\r\nvalves, placed side by side. This engine had the “link” motion. Three\r\nwater-tanks were provided, one beneath the foot-plate, the second\r\nbelow the frames between the leading and driving wheels, and the third\r\nextended from the front of the leading axle under the smoke-box, and\r\nterminated at the buffer beam. The wheel base was, L. to D. 9ft. 6in.,\r\nD. to T. 5ft. 8in. The engine had inside frames and bearings.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive with the “Gothic” fire-box was fitted with a gab\r\nreversing gear, worked off the leading axle; the throw of the cranks\r\nwas 19in. The boiler was 12ft. long and 3ft. 5in. diameter, and\r\ncontained 121 tubes. Two water-tanks were provided—one beneath the\r\nfoot-plate, the other below the frames between the leading and driving\r\nwheels. The wheel base of this engine was, L. to D. 11ft., D. to T.\r\n5ft. 8in.\r\n\r\nThe third Cambrian tank engine of which we possess the drawings was a\r\nsix-wheel locomotive, with single driving wheels 5ft. 6in. diameter,\r\nthe leading and trailing wheels being 3ft. 9in. diameter. The wheel\r\nbase was 15ft. 5in., equally divided.\r\n\r\nThis engine also had a “Gothic” fire-box, and was provided with a\r\nsledge brake, which acted on the rails between the driving and trailing\r\nwheels. The reversing gear was of the fork pattern. The water-tanks\r\nwere fixed—one below the foot-plate, the other beneath the frames,\r\nbetween the driving and trailing wheels. The boiler was 11ft. 2in.\r\nlong, and contained 126 tubes. The machinery in this engine was\r\narranged in an entirely different manner, the segmental cylinder being\r\nbelow the smoke-box. The driving shaft passed through the cylinder, and\r\nprojected beyond the frames on either side of the engine, and vibrated\r\nin an arc, as did that of the “Albion”; but instead of a lever being\r\nattached to each end of the cranks, the latter only extended in one\r\ndirection, so that at one end the crank was fixed on the driving shaft,\r\nwhile to its other extremity was pivoted a connecting-rod, 4ft. long,\r\nthe other end of which was pivoted on a vertical arm, the upper end of\r\nthis arm being attached to the frame by a horizontal bolt, on which it\r\nhung. It is very difficult to explain the method of propulsion without\r\na drawing, but it will be understood that the connecting-rod from the\r\ndriving shaft to the hanging-rod only vibrated. Another crank, 6ft.\r\nlong, was also attached to the bottom end of the vertical swinging-rod;\r\nthe other end of this crank was connected with the driving wheel by\r\nmeans of the usual outside pin. It will, therefore, be seen that by\r\nmeans of the hanging-rod the vibrating motion was transformed into a\r\nrotary one. The feed pumps were worked off the vertical rod, the motion\r\nof which was similar to that of a pendulum, with the connecting-rods\r\nfastened to its bottom end. The drawings of these four remarkable\r\nlocomotives are on a large scale, and are well executed; parts of them\r\nbeing coloured, they are also mostly in a good state of preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The era of “light” and combination locomotives—Samuel’s\r\n        “Lilliputian” and “Little Wonder”—The broad-gauge\r\n        “Fairfield,” constructed by Bridges Adams—Samuel’s\r\n        “Enfield”—Original broad-gauge “singles” converted into\r\n        tank engines—The rise of “tank” engines, “saddle,” and\r\n        “well”—Adams’ “light” engines on Irish railways—The Norfolk\r\n        Railway adopts them—England’s “Little England” exhibited\r\n        at the 1851 Exhibition—Supplied to the Edinburgh and\r\n        Glasgow, the Liverpool and Stockton, Dundee and Perth,\r\n        and Blackwall Railways—Hawthorne’s “Plews” for the Y.N.\r\n        and B.R.—Crampton’s monster “Liverpool”—Taylor’s design\r\n        for a locomotive—Pearson’s prototype of the “Fairlie”\r\n        engine—Ritchie’s non-oscillating engine—Timothy Hackworth\r\n        again to the front—His celebrated “Sanspareil, No. 2”—\r\n        His challenge to Robert Stephenson unaccepted—Bury’s\r\n        “Wrekin”—Caledonian Railway locomotive, No. 15—“Mac’s\r\n        Mangle” on the L. and N.W.R.\r\n\r\nMany curious contrivances were introduced into the construction of\r\nthe locomotive about the period now under review. Among these early\r\nproposals for the improvement of locomotion, few are more interesting\r\nthan the combined locomotive and carriage introduced some fifty years\r\nago by Mr. W. Bridges Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams had a wide experience of every section of railway\r\nconstruction. Indeed, in the preface to one of his books, in writing\r\nof his experience, he says that he had “years of practical utility in\r\nplanning the construction of nearly all machines that run on roads and\r\nrails also—from navvy’s barrow up to a locomotive engine.”\r\n\r\nNor are Mr. Adams’ contributions to railway literature inconsiderable,\r\nfor, besides writing several books between 1838 and 1862, he was at\r\none time editor of a periodical, and also wrote voluminously under the\r\npseudonym of “Junius Redivivus.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly mentioned Mr. W. B. Adams as being entitled to a\r\nfar more important position in the evolution of our locomotives than\r\nis usually accorded him, we will now proceed to discuss the subject of\r\ncombined locomotives and railway carriages, of which Mr. Adams was the\r\nchief advocate. The first machine of the kind, however, appears to have\r\nbeen constructed by Mr. Samuels, of the Eastern Counties Railway, for\r\nthe purpose of quickly and economically conveying the officials of the\r\nrailway over the system.\r\n\r\nThis engine was apparently called both the “Lilliputian” and the\r\n“Little Wonder.” It was constructed in 1847, and made its first trip\r\nto Cambridge on Saturday, October 23rd, leaving London at 10.30 a.m.,\r\nand reaching the University town at 2.45 p.m. Stops were made at three\r\nintermediate stations for water, etc., which occupied about half an\r\nhour, so that the 57½ miles were covered in about 105 minutes’ running\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe total length of the “Little Wonder” was 12ft. 6in., in which space\r\nwas included the boiler, machinery, water-tank, and seats for seven\r\npassengers. The frame was hung below the axles, and carried on four\r\nwheels 3ft. 4in. diameter.\r\n\r\nThe floor was 9in. above rail level. The machinery consisted of two\r\ncylinders, 3½in. diameter, and placed one on each side of the vertical\r\nboiler; the driving axle was cranked. The stroke was 6in. The boiler\r\nwas cylindrical in shape, 19in. diameter and 4ft. 3in. high; it\r\ncontained 35 tubes, 3ft. 3in. long and 1½in. diameter; the tube heating\r\nsurface being 38 sq. ft. The fire-box was circular in shape, 16in.\r\ndiameter and 14in. high, its heating surface being 5½ sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe link motion, feed pumps, etc., were provided. The water-tank held\r\n40 gallons, and was placed under the seats. The usual speed of the\r\n“Little Wonder” with a full load was 30 miles an hour; and as high a\r\nrate as 44 miles an hour was often attained. The coke consumption was\r\nonly 2½lb. per mile. The weight of the whole vehicle, including fuel\r\nand water, was only 25½ cwt.\r\n\r\nSamuels’ initial effort with light locomotives having been so\r\nsuccessful, it occurred to him that branch traffic could be much more\r\ncheaply worked by means of a combined engine and carriage, instead of\r\nthe usual locomotive and train of carriages.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams also had for some time been in favour of a combination of the\r\nkind, and Mr. Gregory, the engineer of the Bristol and Exeter Railway,\r\nwas also in favour of the system being tried on the short branches of\r\nthat railway, the passenger carriages on one at least of which were\r\nat that time drawn by horses. Acting upon the advice of Mr. Gregory,\r\nthe directors of the Bristol and Exeter Railway ordered Mr. Adams to\r\nconstruct a vehicle and engine for working the traffic on the Tiverton\r\nbranch. The machine was completed in December, 1848, and a satisfactory\r\ntrial of it was made upon the broad-gauge metals of the West London\r\nRailway. This combination, which was constructed by Mr. Adams at\r\nFairfield Works, Bow, E., was called the “Fairfield” (Fig. 49), and was\r\nbrought into use on the Tiverton branch on December 23rd, 1848.\r\n\r\nIts length was 39ft., and the boiler was placed in a vertical position.\r\nThe driving wheels were 4ft. 6in. diameter, and were originally made of\r\nsolid wrought-iron. The middle and trailing wheels, 3ft. 6in. diameter,\r\nwere of wood, and loose on their axles as well as their journals, the\r\nmiddle wheels having a lateral transverse of 6in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—THE “FAIRFIELD,” ADAMS’S COMBINED BROAD-GAUGE\r\nENGINE AND TRAIN, FOR THE BRISTOL AND EXETER RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe boiler was vertical, 3ft. in diameter and 6ft. high, and contained\r\n150 tubes; the fire-box was 2ft. high and 2ft. 6in. in diameter. The\r\ncylinder was 8in. diameter, with 12in. stroke. The connecting-rods\r\nworked on a separate crank-shaft, which communicated with the driving\r\nwheels by side-rods, the axle of the driving wheels being straight,\r\nwith crank pins on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was placed behind the driving axle, the tank, capable of\r\nholding 200 gallons of water, being in front of it; and the coke-box\r\nwas attached to the front part of the carriage behind the driver. The\r\nworking pressure was 100lb.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the framing was within 9in. of the rails, so that by\r\nkeeping the centre of gravity low greater safety might be ensured at\r\nhigh speed, and freedom from oscillation obtained.\r\n\r\nThe first-class carriage was in the form of a saloon, and accommodated\r\nsixteen passengers; whilst the second-class compartment seated\r\nthirty-two. The entire weight of the machine was about 10 tons, and\r\nwhen occupied with forty-eight passengers it amounted to about 12½ tons.\r\n\r\nOn the experimental trip, on December 8th, 1848, the “Fairfield” left\r\nPaddington Station at 10.30 a.m. for Swindon, 77 miles down the line,\r\nwith a party of gentlemen connected with various railways. Mr. Gooch\r\nofficiated as driver on both the up and down journeys.\r\n\r\nThough the rails were greasy from the prevailing rain, in addition to\r\na head wind—and, what was worse, a leak in the boiler—the machine\r\nsoon attained considerable speed, and for a portion of the way reached\r\nthe rate of 49 miles an hour. On arriving at Swindon the fire was\r\nextinguished, the leak partially repaired, and, after a reasonable\r\nsojourn, the party returned to town. The run back was exceedingly\r\nsatisfactory, the speed of 49 miles being maintained for a considerable\r\npart of the way, the passage from Slough to Paddington being performed\r\nin 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the crank-shaft was unprovided with wheels, the\r\nmotion being conveyed to the driving wheels by means of cranks fixed on\r\nthe outsides of the driving axle, and connected to similar cranks on\r\nthe driving wheels by means of connecting-rods.\r\n\r\nThis method has erroneously been called “Crampton’s system,” but it\r\nshould be noticed that Adams used it for several years previous to\r\nCrampton adopting the plan in question. These combined engines and\r\ncarriages were, in fact, built under a patent obtained by Mr. Adams\r\nin 1846, and, therefore, some time before Crampton adopted the inside\r\ncylinder and intermediate driving shaft.\r\n\r\nIt was found in practice that the vertical boiler of the “Fairfield”\r\nwas not a success, so after some nine months’ trial it was replaced by\r\na horizontal tubular boiler. Then, after further experience, several\r\ndrawbacks to the efficient working of branch line traffic by means\r\nof the combined engine and carriage were evident. So the engine was\r\ndisconnected from the carriage and given an extra pair of wheels, and\r\nbecame, in fact, a miniature four-wheeled tank locomotive, a style of\r\nengine Adams afterwards became noted for building.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel having obtained the sanction of the directors of the Eastern\r\nCounties Railway, Mr. Adams constructed a locomotive carriage for\r\nthe Enfield branch traffic. The “Enfield” (Fig. 50), in appearance\r\nresembled a four-wheel tank engine and a four-wheel carriage, built\r\ntogether on a continuous frame, instead of being connected by couplings\r\nand buffers.\r\n\r\nThe whole framing, with the exception of the two buffer bars, was\r\nof wrought-iron, and was 8ft. 6in. in width, bound together by deep\r\ncross-bars.\r\n\r\nThe engine was of the outside cylinder class. The cylinders were 7in.\r\nin diameter, with a 12in. stroke. They were simply bolted down to the\r\nsurface of a stout wrought-iron plate, in the middle of which the\r\nboiler was placed.\r\n\r\nThe driving wheels were 5ft. in diameter, and, as well as the front\r\npair of wheels of the carriage, were without flanges, those of\r\nthe leading engine wheels and the hind pair of the carriage being\r\nsufficient to retain the engine on the rails, whilst greater freedom\r\nwas thus obtained for passing around curves. The boiler was constructed\r\nin the usual manner, and was 5ft. in length by 2ft. 6in. in diameter,\r\nand had 115 1½in. tubes 5ft. 3in. long, giving 230ft. of tube-heating\r\nsurface. The dimensions of the fire-box were 2ft. 10½in. by 2ft.\r\n6in., being an area of 25 sq. ft., making the total heating surface\r\n255 sq. ft. The water was carried below the floor of the carriage in\r\nwrought-iron tubes 12in. in diameter and 12ft. long.\r\n\r\nThe coke was carried in a chest placed behind the foot-plate of the\r\nengine and immediately in front of the carriage head. The side frames\r\nwere ingeniously trussed by diagonal bars of iron, and were thus\r\nrendered of great strength without adding much weight to the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—THE “ENFIELD,” COMBINED ENGINE AND TRAIN FOR\r\nTHE EASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe leading engine wheels, together with the running wheels of the\r\ncarriage, were 3ft. in diameter. The carriage was divided into four\r\ncompartments, the two middle ones being for first-class and the two\r\nexternal ones for second-class passengers. The guard’s seat was on the\r\ntop of the carriage head. A vertical shaft with a hand-wheel on its\r\nupper end passed down the side of the head, and was connected beneath\r\nthe framing with two transverse rocking shafts, carrying the brake\r\nblocks, placed one on each side of the driving wheels, thus giving the\r\nguard a ready means of control over the speed of the engine.\r\n\r\nTo bring up the buffers to the line of those of ordinary carriages,\r\nseparate timber beams were passed across each end of the carriage,\r\nthe front one being supported by neat wrought-iron brackets, rising\r\nfrom the framing. The total weight of the whole was not more than 10\r\ntons, including its supply of coke and water, and accommodation was\r\nafforded for 42 passengers, to convey which, at 40 miles per hour, the\r\ncalculated consumption of coke was 7lb. per mile.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel stated that the accommodation provided by the combined\r\nengine and carriage was not sufficient for the traffic, so two\r\nadditional carriages (one with a guard’s compartment) were added, the\r\ntrain thus having accommodation for 150 passengers. The “Enfield”\r\nworked this train regularly at 37 miles an hour speed.\r\n\r\nFrom January 29th to September 9th, 1849, the train travelled 14,021\r\nmiles, and was in steam 15 hours daily, but only five of which were\r\nspent in running. The total time in steam during the above period was\r\n2,162 hours, the total coke consumed being 1,437 cwt., of which 743\r\ncwt. was consumed in running, 408 in standing, and 286 in raising\r\nthe steam. The average coke consumption per mile was 11.48lb., but\r\na considerable portion of this was spent in standing, the actual\r\nconsumption for running being only about 6lb. per mile.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the passenger traffic, the “Enfield” hauled all the\r\ngoods and coal traffic on the branch, which, during the period under\r\nreview, amounted to 169 tons of goods and 1,241 tons of coal. On June\r\n14th, 1849, the “Enfield” took the 10 a.m. train from Shoreditch to\r\nEly, 72 miles, the train consisting of three passenger carriages and\r\ntwo horse-boxes; but the “Enfield” arrived eight minutes before time,\r\nand the coke consumed only amounted to 8¾lb. per mile for the trip,\r\nincluding that used in raising steam.\r\n\r\nWhen tried between Norwich and London, the “Enfield” performed the\r\njourney of 126 miles in 3 hours 35 minutes, including stoppages. An\r\nordinary train had, at that time, never made the journey so quickly.\r\n\r\nAlthough the “Enfield” appeared to use so little fuel, the broad-gauge\r\n“Fairfield” does not seem to have been an economical machine. A special\r\ntrial was made between Gooch’s famous 8ft. single “Great Britain” and\r\n“Fairfield,” between Exeter and Bristol. A loaded wagon weighing 10\r\ntons was drawn by the “Fairfield,” making a total weight of 26½ tons,\r\nof which the engine portion can be reckoned at 9½ tons and 17 tons for\r\nthe weight of the train. The distance is 76 miles, and the time allowed\r\nfor the 8 a.m. train, including ten stops, was 2 hours 35 minutes; but\r\nthe “Fairfield” took 3 hours 17 minutes to cover the distance, and\r\nconsumed 13lb. of coke per mile, only 6.3lb. of water being evaporated\r\nfor each pound of coke.\r\n\r\nThe duty performed by the two locomotives is thus tabulated:—\r\n\r\n                                               Consumption\r\n                       Load in     Coke per     of Coke per\r\n                        tons.        mile.      ton per mile.\r\n\r\n    “Great Britain”      100         26 lb.       0.26 lb.\r\n    “Fairfield”           17         13 lb.       0.76 lb.\r\n\r\nBut, in comparison with the old “Venus,” the “Fairfield” comes out no\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe “Venus,” it will be remembered, was one of the original broad-gauge\r\nengines built for the Great Western Railway by the Vulcan Foundry\r\nCompany, with 8ft. driving wheels. This engine had her driving wheels\r\nreduced to 6ft. diameter, and a small water-tank fitted on the\r\nfoot-plate in place of a tender, thus being converted into a six-wheel\r\n“single” tank engine. The “Venus” only used 14lb. of coke per mile in\r\nworking the Tiverton branch; while the “Fairfield” consumed 19lb. of\r\ncoke per mile on the same work. The evaporating powers of the “Venus”\r\nhad been greatly improved since N. Wood’s experiments in 1838, as at\r\nthat time she consumed 52.7lb. of coke per mile run.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—“RED STAR,” A 7FT. SINGLE BROAD-GAUGE SADDLE\r\nTANK ENGINE. CYLINDERS, 16in. BY 18in.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to “Venus,” several other of the early broad-gauge\r\nlocomotives were reconstructed as tank engines. Fig. 51 (“Red Star”) is\r\na good example of the peculiar tank locomotives on the G.W.R. 60 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the “Fairfield” and “Enfield,” combined engines and\r\ncarriages were constructed by Mr. Adams for several other railways.\r\nOne for the Cork and Bandon Railway had cylinders 9in. diameter, and\r\naccommodation for 131 passengers. This engine was constructed in such\r\na manner as to enable it to run independently of the carriage. Another\r\nengine and carriage was built for a Scotch railway, and was guaranteed\r\nto work at 40 miles an hour. But the advantage of having the engine\r\nseparate from the carriage was so great that Mr. Adams soon ceased to\r\nbuild the combination vehicles, and instead constructed his celebrated\r\n“light” locomotives; these, and the somewhat similar “Little England”\r\nengines, built by England and Co., were at one time very popular.\r\n\r\nFig. 52, representing “No. 148,” one of the first batch of outside\r\ncylinder engines on the Southern Division of the L. and N. W. R., shows\r\nalso a good example of Stephenson’s “long boiler” locomotive. “148” was\r\nbuilt by Jones and Potts, of Newton-le-Willows in 1847. The cylinders\r\nwere 15in. diameter, the stroke being 24in. The driving wheels were\r\nwithout flanges, and were 6ft. 6in. in diameter. The leading wheels\r\nwere 4ft. diameter. This engine was destroyed in a collision at Oxford\r\non January 3rd, 1855, in which accident seven people lost their lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—“No. 148,” LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN RAILWAY; AN\r\nEXAMPLE OF STEPHENSON’S “LONG BOILER” ENGINES]\r\n\r\nAt this period a fashion for “tank” engines had become prevalent,\r\nand most of the locomotive builders produced designs, each having\r\ncharacteristic features. Thus Sharp Brothers and Company’s “tank”\r\nengines had outside cylinders, with the tank between the frames and\r\nbelow the boiler, whilst the coal was carried in a bunker affixed to\r\nan extension of the foot-plate. Somewhat similar “single tank” engines\r\nwere made by the same firm for the Manchester and Birmingham Railway\r\n(London and North Western Railway). The two engines in question were\r\nNos. 33 and 34, and were used in working the traffic between Manchester\r\nand Macclesfield, the daily duty of each averaging 114½ miles. These\r\nengines commenced work in May, 1847. They weighed 21 tons in working\r\norder; the driving wheels were 5ft. 6in. diameter, and the leading\r\nand trailing 3ft. 6in. Two water-tanks were provided, one between the\r\nleading and driving wheels, the other under the coal bunker, at the\r\nrear of the trailing wheels. The two tanks contained 480 gallons of\r\nwater. A wooden float attached to a vertical rod was fitted to show\r\nthe amount of water in the tanks! The bunker contained half a ton of\r\ncoals. These engines were fitted with sand-boxes; but these were placed\r\nin front of the leading wheels only, although the locomotives were\r\nspecially constructed for running either bunker or chimney in front.\r\nHowever, the introduction of the sand-box was a step in the right\r\ndirection; yet Tredgold only mentions the innovation in an apologetic\r\nmanner. He says (after describing the working of the apparatus) that\r\n“it is very seldom required on the Macclesfield line, owing to the\r\nballast between the rails being mostly sand; but when the rails are\r\nmoist it is necessary in starting a heavy train to open the sand-cock.”\r\nTredgold then proceeds to give a detailed explanation of “how it is\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nIn September, 1849, Walter Neilson, of Glasgow, obtained a patent for\r\nhis design of tank engine.\r\n\r\nThe tank was of the now well-known “saddle” kind, and covered the\r\nwhole boiler, barrel, and smoke-box; the bottom of the saddle tank\r\nrested on the frames on either side of the boiler, so that the tank\r\nwas semi-circular in shape, instead of being but an arc, as is the\r\npractice with modern “saddle tanks.” Neilson was, however, sufficiently\r\ningenious not to limit the design of his saddle tank, for we find that\r\n“the tank may be supported from the boiler, instead of the framing, if\r\nnecessary, and its length may be made shorter than that of the boiler,\r\nif required.” The boiler was fed with water drawn from the smoke-box\r\nend of the tank, to obtain the advantage of the escaping heat. The coal\r\nbunkers were placed at the sides of the fire-box, and extended some\r\ndistance towards the back buffer beam, but a bunker was not provided at\r\nthe end, so as to allow “of ready access to the couplings of the wagons\r\nbehind.” The engine in question had inside frames, underhung springs,\r\noutside cylinders, single driving wheels, unprovided with flanges, and\r\nsmall leading and trailing wheels. A short cylindrical dome was placed\r\nover the fire-box, and on this were fixed two “Salter” pattern safety\r\nvalves, covered by a brass casing.\r\n\r\n“Light locomotives” was the popular name of tank engines when the\r\ngeneral use of such engines was being urged as a method of reducing the\r\nworking expenses of unremunerative railways. We have previously alluded\r\nto Mr. W. Bridges Adams and his combined engines and carriages. This\r\ngentleman and Mr. England were the principal advocates of the “light”\r\nlocomotive, and both attained some success in connection therewith.\r\n\r\nThe engines in question would now be considered absurdly light, but\r\nnearly fifty years ago far different ideas of “light” and “heavy,” as\r\napplied to locomotive engines, obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—ADAMS’S “LIGHT” LOCOMOTIVE FOR THE LONDONDERRY\r\nAND ENNISKILLEN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe practice of Adams and England regarding “light” locomotives\r\ndiffered considerably. The former was a firm advocate of four wheels\r\nand a long wheel base. England, on the other hand, preferred his light\r\nlocomotives to be supported by six wheels. In 1847, Adams built a\r\nlight locomotive (Fig. 53) for the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway\r\n(Ireland), with outside cylinders 9in. in diameter, the stroke being\r\n15in. The driving wheels were 5ft. in diameter, and located in front\r\nof the fire-box; the other pair of wheels were 3ft. diameter, and were\r\nplaced beneath the smoke-box. The fire-box was 2ft. 9in. long, the\r\nboiler 2ft. 3in. diameter and 10ft. 3in. long; height of top of boiler\r\nfrom rails, 5ft. 8in. The connecting-rods were 5ft. 3in. long; the\r\nsteam pressure was 120lb. The water-tank was placed beneath the boiler,\r\nand reached to within a few inches of the surface of the rails. Mr.\r\nAdams built a similar engine for the St. Helen’s Railway. In November,\r\n1849, a broad-gauge light locomotive was built at Mr. Adams’ Fairfield\r\nWorks, for service on the Holyhead breakwater. The engine in question\r\nwas from designs prepared by Mr. Thos. Gray, resident engineer of C.\r\nand J. Rigby, the contractors for the breakwater. This engine had\r\ncylinders 8in. diameter, the stroke being 18in.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1849, Adams supplied two of his light engines to the Cork and\r\nBandon Railway. These differed from those already described, as the\r\ndriving wheels were the leading ones, the smaller pair of wheels being\r\nat the rear. The Irish names of the engines signified “Running Fire”\r\nand “Whirlwind.”\r\n\r\nIn August, 1853, the engineer of the Cork and Bandon Railway\r\nreported that “the cost of repairs to the engines was very small,\r\nmore particularly on the light engines, which have worked all the\r\nfast passenger trains in a satisfactory manner, and with the same\r\nconsumption of coke as heretofore—viz., about 10lb. per mile. These\r\nengines were put upon the line in July, 1849, since which period they\r\nhave been daily working the passenger traffic. The principal item of\r\ncost in their repairs during the four years has been a new crank axle\r\nto each of the two light engines, as also a new set of tyres on the\r\ndriving wheels. The light special trains conveyed by these engines\r\ngenerally occupy about 26 minutes between the two termini of Cork and\r\nBandon.” These two light locomotives continued to work traffic over the\r\nCork and Bandon Railway for several years.\r\n\r\nOn May 1st, 1851, Mr. Peto, the chairman of the Norfolk Railway,\r\nprovided four light engines with 12in. cylinders, and weighing 10 tons\r\neach, to work the branch traffic of that railway under the following\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Railway was worked by the Eastern Counties, and the branch\r\nor local trains of the former were supposed to meet the main line\r\ntrains of the latter line at the junctions.\r\n\r\nBut the Eastern Counties trains had a habit of being behindhand,\r\nputting in an appearance at the junctions any time between thirty\r\nminutes and an hour after the times given in the time-tables. As\r\na result, the traffic on the Norfolk branch lines was thoroughly\r\ndisorganised; indeed, so little could it be depended upon that local\r\npassengers almost completely neglected the line. Then the Eastern\r\nCounties Railway worked the Norfolk branches with the main line\r\nengines, and charged the Norfolk Railway the average expense per mile\r\nincurred in working with these engines.\r\n\r\nSuch a method did not meet with the approval of the chairman of the\r\nNorfolk Railway, so Mr. Peto obtained the sanction of the Eastern\r\nCounties Railway to allow the Norfolk Company to work the local\r\nbranch traffic itself, and independent of the arrival and departure\r\nof the main line trains. Mr. Peto’s new system met with instantaneous\r\nand complete success, a great saving being effected. Thus the coke\r\nconsumption of Adams’ light engines, introduced by Mr. Peto, only\r\naveraged 10lb. per train mile; but the Norfolk Railway had been paying\r\nthe Eastern Counties Railway at the rate of 27lb. per mile, that being\r\nthe average coke consumption of the Eastern Counties Railway main line\r\nengines. A large and remunerative local passenger traffic was built up\r\nby reason of the improved local services.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed by Mr. Adams for his light engines were as\r\nfollows:—Less dead weight, less friction, and less crushing and\r\ndeflecting of the rails.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to give some account of England’s light\r\nlocomotives, popularly called “Little Englanders”; but this cognomen\r\nthen had a very different meaning, as applied to locomotives, than\r\nthe words have at the present time in their application to certain\r\nindividuals. England constructed his premier light engine in 1849,\r\nand the “Little England” (Fig. 54) was exhibited at the Exhibition of\r\n1851. The chief dimensions were:—Driving wheels, 4ft. 6in. diameter,\r\nlocated in front of the fire-box; leading and trailing wheels, 3ft.\r\ndiameter; inside cylinders, placed between the leading and driving\r\nwheels, and not under the smoke-box; the frames were outside. The\r\nfire-box was of the Bury type, with safety valves, similar to those\r\npreviously described as on the Bury engine still at work on the Furness\r\nRailway. A dome was placed on the boiler barrel over the cylinders, so\r\nthat the steam pipes proceeded in a curved vertical line from the dome\r\nto the cylinders. The dome was on a square seating. An auxiliary pipe\r\nfor the escape of the steam was provided at the back of the chimney,\r\nbut was only about one-half as high as the chimney. At the rear of the\r\nfoot-plate was a well-tank, holding water sufficient for a 50-mile\r\ntrip. A prize medal was awarded to this engine at the Exhibition.\r\n\r\nEngland and Co. in August, 1850, sent one of their light engines to the\r\nEdinburgh and Glasgow Railway on the following conditions: A guarantee\r\nthat the engine should work the express trains between Edinburgh\r\nand Glasgow, consisting of seven carriages, and keep good time as\r\nper time-bill, while the fuel consumption was not to exceed 10lb. of\r\ncoke per mile. If the light engine performed these conditions to the\r\nsatisfaction of the railway company’s engineer, the Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow Railway was to purchase the locomotive for £1,200. But if the\r\nwork done and the quantity of fuel consumed were not as guaranteed,\r\nEngland and Co. were to remove the engine and pay all expenses of the\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—ENGLAND & CO.’S “LITTLE ENGLAND” LOCOMOTIVE,\r\nEXHIBITED AT THE PREMIER INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, LONDON, 1851]\r\n\r\nThis “Little England” was tried in competition with the “Sirius,”\r\nthe coke consumption of the former being 8lb. 3oz. per mile against\r\n29lb. 1oz. of the “Sirius,” both performing exactly the same work. The\r\n“Little England” so frequently ran in before her time that the driver\r\nhad to be ordered to take longer time on the trips for fear of an\r\naccident happening in consequence of the train arriving before it was\r\nexpected. The speed of this light engine frequently exceeded 60 miles\r\nan hour, and during the heavy winds and gales of January, 1851, the\r\n“Little England” was the only locomotive on the line that kept time.\r\nWith a train of five carriages the coke consumption only amounted to\r\n6½lb. per mile. On the Campsie Junction line, the “Little England”\r\nhauled a train of seven carriages and a brake-van, all of which were\r\noverloaded with passengers, over the several gradients of Nebrand,\r\nat 30 miles an hour. Although the train stopped at a station on the\r\nincline, the light engine successfully started from the station and\r\ncontinued the ascent. An ordinary engine was sent to assist the train\r\nat the rear, in case the “Little England” proved unequal to the task,\r\nbut it is said that the bank engine was unable to keep up with the\r\ntrain!\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the result of the trial of the “Little\r\nEngland” on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway:—\r\n\r\n     (A) = Including lighting up and standing 4 hours between each trip.\r\n\r\n     ----------+-------------+-------------+-------+--------------------\r\n               |             |             |       |     Coke Consumed.\r\n     Number of |    Daily    |   No. of    |       |\r\n     Carriages |Mileage (47½)|  Stoppages  |Time on+----------+---------\r\n     per Train.|   each way. |(3 each way).| each  |  While   |\r\n               |             |             | trip. | running. |  (A)\r\n               |             |             |       | Per Mile.|\r\n    -----------+-------------+-------------+-------+----------+---------\r\n               |             |             |       | lbs.  oz.| lbs. oz.\r\n               |             |             |       |          |\r\n           7   |}            |             |      {|  8     3 |  9    7\r\n           7   |}     95     |      6      |  90  {|  8     3 |  9    7\r\n           5   |}    miles.  |             |  min.{|  7     4 |  9    7\r\n           4   |}            |             |      {|  6     5 |  8    5\r\n     ----------+-------------+-------------+-------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nOn September 7th, 1850, another “Little Englander” commenced service on\r\nthe Liverpool and Stockport Railway, under guarantee to haul a train\r\nof seven carriages up an incline of 1 in 100, stopping and starting\r\nupon it, at a speed of 25 miles an hour, and consuming not more than\r\n10lb. of coke per mile; on the level the speed was to be 45 miles an\r\nhour. This engine frequently drew ten carriages under the conditions\r\nlaid down for only seven. In June, 1849, a “Little Englander” had been\r\nsupplied to the Dundee and Perth Railway for working the mail train of\r\nfour carriages. This the engine did successfully for a considerable\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAfter the abolition of rope traction on the Blackwall Railway “Little\r\nEnglanders” were used for the passenger trains.\r\n\r\nEngland and Co. guaranteed these light engines to haul trains of six\r\ncarriages at a speed of 40 miles an hour on gradients of 1 in 100, at\r\na coke consumption of only 10lb. per mile. These engines cost £1,200\r\neach, and the builders were willing to back them for 1,000 guineas a\r\nside, with a load in proportion to the weight of any other engine,\r\nor the amount of fuel consumed. We do not think anyone ever cared to\r\naccept this challenge.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1848, a patent was granted to McConochie and Claude, of\r\nLiverpool, for various improvements in the locomotive. The cylinders\r\nwere inside, behind the leading wheels, the valve gearing being\r\noutside the frame and worked by eccentrics on the naves of the driving\r\nwheels. It will be remembered that the valve gearing of Stephenson’s\r\n“No. 185” was on this plan. The pumps were worked off the driving\r\nwheels, as in the “Jenny Linds.” A double-beat safety valve was\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nTo enable a low-pitched boiler to be employed, the axle was cranked at\r\nthe extreme ends, so that at each extremity of the axle only one return\r\ncrank-arm was provided, the wheel itself forming the second one, and a\r\npin connecting the wheel and axle-crank formed the shaft upon which the\r\nconnecting-rod worked.\r\n\r\nTo increase the weight upon the driving axle, a toggle joint was\r\nplaced between the bearing of the trailing axle and the springs; a rod\r\nconnected the knuckle of the toggle joint with the piston of a small\r\nsteam cylinder.\r\n\r\nWhen the driver wished to obtain additional adhesion for the driving\r\nwheels, he admitted steam to this auxiliary cylinder, which drove the\r\ntoggle joint into an upright position, thereby removing the weight from\r\nthe trailing wheels and placing it upon the driving wheels. Several\r\nother novel proposals were included in the specification in question.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Hawthorne, of Newcastle, built an engine named “Plews,” No.\r\n180, of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway (makers’ number of\r\nengine, 711). The locomotive had a copper fire-box. The boiler was\r\n10ft. 8in. long, of oval shape, and consequently had to be stayed with\r\nfour plates; 229 brass tubes of 1¾in. external diameter were provided;\r\ntwo lever safety valves were fixed on a raised fire-box and enclosed in\r\na brass casing; the steam pressure was 120lb. A very large cast-iron\r\ndome placed on the centre ring of the boiler was a characteristic of\r\nthe “Plews.”\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were placed between the outside and inside frames,\r\ndiameter 16in. and stroke 20in.; whilst the slide-valves were outside\r\nthe cylinders, being worked by four eccentrics, on the outside of the\r\nwheels, but within the outside frames. The driving wheels were 7ft.\r\ndiameter, the leading and trailing being 4ft. diameter; the whole of\r\nthe bearings were outside.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, the steam was turned into the tender for the purpose of\r\nheating the feed-water. The tender was carried on six wheels of 3ft.\r\n6in. diameter, and was capable of holding 1,400 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nBrake blocks were provided for both sides of the six wheels, and an\r\ningenious arrangement of tooth wheels and rack applied the whole of the\r\nblocks by means of a few turns of the brake handle.\r\n\r\nCrampton’s engine, “Liverpool” (Fig. 55), has been described as the\r\n“ultimatum for the narrow-gauge.” Why, we are at a loss to understand;\r\nmany other narrow-gauge engines have been constructed of greater power,\r\nand certainly of more compact and pleasing design. The “ultimatum\r\nof locomotive ugliness” would have been a correct title for the\r\n“Liverpool.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—CRAMPTON’S “LIVERPOOL,” L. AND N.W.R.]\r\n\r\nThe engine in question was built by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy, for the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway, in 1848. The one good point about the\r\nengine was the immense heating surface, which amounted to 2,290 sq. ft.\r\nWhen our locomotive superintendents make up their minds to construct\r\nexpress locomotives with such an amount of heating surface, we shall\r\nhear no more of “double engine running,” and our express trains may\r\nbe expected to average a speed of over 50 miles an hour from start to\r\nfinish (including stops) on all trips.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the “Liverpool” was similar to the engines\r\non Crampton’s system already described—viz., the driving wheels at\r\nthe back of the fire-box and outside cylinders fixed about the centre\r\nof the frames. This engine had three pairs of carrying wheels under\r\nthe boiler, in addition to the driving wheels. The cylinders were\r\noutside, fixed upon transverse bearers, formed of iron plates 1¼in.\r\nthick, curved to the shape of the boiler and passing below it. The\r\ncylinders were 18in. diameter, the stroke being 24in. Metallic packing,\r\nconsisting of two concentric rings of cast-iron, each with a wedge and\r\ncircular steel spring, was used for the purpose of making the pistons\r\nsteam-tight. The valves were above the cylinders, and were inclined,\r\nthe eccentrics being of large size and outside the driving wheels. The\r\nregulator was located in a steam-box on the top of the boiler barrel;\r\nthe steam reached the valves by means of curved vertical copper pipes\r\noutside the boiler, whilst the exhaust was conveyed to the smoke-box by\r\nsimilar horizontal “outside” pipes. The two exhaust pipes united within\r\nthe smoke-box beneath the bottom of the chimney, the blast orifice\r\nbeing 5½in. diameter.\r\n\r\nThe leading wheels were 4ft. 3in. diameter, the two intermediate\r\npairs 4ft., and the driving wheels 8ft. in diameter. The area of the\r\nfire-grate was 21.58ft. The tubes were of brass, 12ft. 6in. long; 292\r\nwere 2³/₁₆th in diameter, the remaining eight being 1¾in. diameter. The\r\nheating surface was:—Tubes, 2,136.117 sq. ft.; fire-box, 154.434 sq.\r\nft. The pumps were horizontal, fixed on the frames over the leading\r\nwheels; they were worked by extension piston-rods, worked through the\r\ncovers of the cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe engine weighed (loaded) 35 tons, of which weight 12 tons were on\r\nthe driving axle. The tender weighed 21 tons. With a light load the\r\n“Liverpool” attained a speed of nearly 80 miles an hour, whilst on one\r\noccasion she hauled the train conveying Franconi’s troupe and horses,\r\nconsisting of 40 vehicles, from Rugby to Euston under the schedule\r\ntime. Three engines had been engaged to haul the same train from\r\nLiverpool to Rugby, when time was lost. The power of the “Liverpool”\r\nwould, therefore, appear to have exceeded that of three of the usual\r\nLondon and North Western Railway locomotives of that date.\r\n\r\nAdams’ idea of a straight driving shaft connected by means of\r\noutside rods with the driving wheels soon attracted attention, and\r\nin 1849 Crampton incorporated the principle in his patent locomotive\r\nspecification of that year. But it was some two years later before any\r\nengines were built under this particular patent of Crampton’s. These\r\nlocomotives will be described in due sequence.\r\n\r\nWe will now give a few details of some engines that would have been\r\nmost interesting had we knowledge that they were ever built. We possess\r\ndrawings of the engines in question, but lack authentic details of\r\ntheir performances, so we will mention the principal features of the\r\ndesigns, as given in the patent specifications. George Taylor, of\r\nHolbeck, Leeds, obtained his patent on June 3rd, 1847. The drawing\r\nshows the boiler to be hung below the wheels, of which there are only\r\nfour; these were to be 15ft. diameter, and in addition the wheels\r\nwere geared up 2 to 1, so that one revolution of the cogged driving\r\nwheel would have propelled the engine six times the distance of a\r\ndriving wheel of 5ft. diameter. The cylinders were inside the frames,\r\nover the boiler, and, of course, at the rear of the smoke-box; the\r\nconnecting-rods were attached to cranks on either side of a central\r\ncog-wheel, which engaged with a cog-wheel of half its diameter,\r\nfixed on the centre of the rear axle. The motion being conveyed to\r\nthe centre of the axle, instead of alternately on each side, as is\r\nusual, practically abolished the oscillating motion so apparent in\r\ntwo-cylinder engines. An examination of the drawing of this locomotive\r\ndesign of George Taylor shows with what ease and slight alteration it\r\nwas possible for the two geared engines supplied to the Great Western\r\nRailway by the Haigh Foundry to have been altered to ordinary direct\r\naction engines.\r\n\r\nLarge wheels were also to be used for the tender, the axles passing\r\nthrough the water-tank, so that the centre of gravity was lowered.\r\n\r\nJames Pearson, the locomotive superintendent of the Bristol and\r\nExeter Railway, obtained a patent on October 7th, 1847, for a double\r\nlocomotive. Fairlie’s “Little Wonder” narrow-gauge engines were\r\nprobably suggested by Pearson’s design of 1847; whilst the latter’s\r\nfamous broad-gauge double-bogie tanks were decidedly evolved from his\r\nearlier form of locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was to have the fire-box in the centre, the latter being\r\ndivided into two parts, connected below the furnace doors; the driving\r\naxle was across this central foot-plate, to allow of very large wheels\r\nand a low centre of gravity. Each boiler (there being practically\r\ntwo, one each side of the central double fire-box) was carried on a\r\nfour-wheel bogie, so that the locomotive was carried on ten wheels, as\r\nin the later design. The bogie frames were connected by tension-rods,\r\npassing outside the fire-box. India-rubber springs were employed, their\r\nuse being to allow each bogie to adjust itself to any inequality of the\r\nroad, and to bring the bogies back to the straight position on an even\r\nroad. The coke was to be stowed in bunkers over the boilers, and the\r\nwater could be either in tanks between the tops of the boilers and the\r\ncoke bunkers, or a separate tender could be provided. The steam domes\r\nwere on the fire-box, and were to be of abnormal height, and connected\r\nover the head of the foot-plate, thus forming the roof of the cab. An\r\nexhaust fan was fixed in the smoke-box to draw the heated air through\r\nthe tubes and discharge it up the chimney, or it could be used again\r\nas a hot blast for the furnace, and a chimney and a smoke-box were\r\nprovided for each boiler. The fans were to be driven by pulleys off one\r\nof the axles, and it was claimed that, as the exhaust steam was not\r\nrequired for the purpose of creating a blast, extra large exhaust pipes\r\ncould be used, and the cylinders thereby relieved of “back pressure.”\r\nThe cylinders were outside, and the valves were beyond the cylinders.\r\nThese were fixed between the wheels of one of the bogies. The general\r\ndesign of this engine, as shown in the drawings, was very ingenious,\r\nand is certainly the most symmetrical “double-ended” type of engine\r\nwe have seen illustrated. Pearson for some reason did not construct\r\nan engine after this style, but produced the well-known 9ft. “single”\r\n(double-bogie) tanks instead.\r\n\r\nThe third patent now to be described had also for its leading feature\r\nextra large driving wheels. The specification is that of Charles\r\nRitchie, of Aberdeen, the patent being granted to him on March 2nd,\r\n1848. The principal feature was the providing of two piston-rods to\r\neach piston, one on each side. Four driving wheels were proposed, one\r\npair placed in front of the smoke-box and one pair behind the fire-box.\r\nThe cylinders were outside, and were, of course, fixed at an equal\r\ndistance between the two pairs of driving wheels. One pair of carrying\r\nwheels was to be used, placed below the cylinders. It was claimed\r\nthat this arrangement of pistons and connecting-rods exactly balanced\r\nthe reciprocating parts of the machinery, and therefore abolished\r\noscillation. Another improvement related to the slide-valves, the\r\nstarting, stopping, and reversing of the engine, together with the\r\nexpansive working of the steam, the whole to be controlled by a wheel\r\non the foot-plate, connected by cogs with the link of the valve gear.\r\n\r\nOther improvements were compensating safety valves, an “anti-primer,”\r\nand an improved feed-water apparatus. The last is described as\r\nfollows:—“Upon steam being admitted from the boiler into the cylinder,\r\nthrough the steam-port, the piston will be acted upon, and the ram be\r\nwithdrawn; the water will then raise the valve and enter the barrel,\r\nto occupy the space previously occupied by the ram. By this time the\r\npiston will have acted upon a lever, so as to cause the slide-valve to\r\nuncover one port and cover the other, thereby allowing the steam on the\r\nother side of the piston to escape through the exhaust pipe.\r\n\r\n“The piston will now be impelled in a contrary direction, and the ram\r\nentering the barrel will cause the one valve to be closed and the\r\nother to be opened by pressure of the water therein, which, as the ram\r\nadvances, will be forced into the boiler.”\r\n\r\nAnother part of the specification related to an “anti-fluctuator.”\r\nA partition-plate was to be fixed between the tube-plate and the\r\nfire-box, and the water was to be let into the boiler at the fire-box\r\nend, and would only reach that portion of the boiler beyond the\r\nfire-box by flowing over the top of the partition-plate. By this means\r\nthe fire-box would always be covered with water. It will be seen\r\nthat the specification contained several useful propositions, which,\r\nhowever, do not appear to have been put into practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—TIMOTHY HACKWORTH’S “SANSPAREIL NO. 2”]\r\n\r\nWe have previously, upon more occasions than one, shown the important\r\nposition occupied in the evolution of the steam locomotive by the\r\nengines built or designed by Timothy Hackworth. We now have to give an\r\naccount of his last locomotive, the “Sanspareil No. 2.”\r\n\r\nA comparison of the drawings of this engine (copies of which are in\r\nour possession) with Hackworth’s earlier efforts of 20 years before,\r\nclearly discloses the remarkable strides made in the improvement of the\r\nlocomotive during that period, and also most clearly shows that in 1849\r\nHackworth was still in the very van of locomotive construction, even as\r\nhe had been in the days of his “Royal George.”\r\n\r\nThe “Sanspareil No. 2” (Fig. 56) was constructed by Timothy Hackworth\r\nat his Soho Engine Works at Shildon. The patent was obtained in the\r\nname of his son, the late John Wesley Hackworth. We are indebted to the\r\nexecutor of the will of Timothy Hackworth for many of the following\r\ndetails concerning the engine now under review.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive was of the six-wheel “single” type, with outside\r\nbearings to the L. and T. wheels, and inside bearings of the driving\r\nwheels. The cylinders were inside. A cylindrical steam dome was\r\nplaced on the boiler barrel close to the smoke-box. The fire-box was\r\nof the raised pattern, and on it was an encased Salter safety valve.\r\nCylindrical sand-boxes were fixed on the frame-plates in front of the\r\ndriving wheels. The principal dimensions of the engine were:—Driving\r\nwheels, 6ft. 6in. diameter; leading and trailing, 4ft. diameter;\r\ncylinders, 15in. diameter, 22in. stroke. Weight in working order:—L.,\r\n8 tons 6 cwt.; D., 11 tons 4 cwt.; T., 4 tons 5 cwt. Total, 23 tons 15\r\ncwt.\r\n\r\nIt would be well if we mentioned the principal novelties in\r\nconstruction—viz.: Welded longitudinal seams in boiler barrel; the\r\nboiler was connected to the smoke-box and fire-box by means of welded\r\nangle-irons, instead of the usual riveted angle-irons; the lagging of\r\nthe boiler was also covered with sheet-iron, as is now general, instead\r\nof the wood being left to view, as was at that time the usual practice.\r\n\r\nA baffle-plate was fitted at the smoke-box end of tubes, as well as at\r\nthe fire-box end.\r\n\r\nThe pistons and rods were made of wrought-iron in one forging.\r\n\r\nThe valves were constructed under Hackworth’s patent, and were designed\r\nto allow a portion of the steam required to perform the return stroke\r\nto be in the cylinder before the forward stroke was completed, and thus\r\nto form a steam cushion between the piston and cylinder covers. Such\r\nworking was said to economise 25 to 30 per cent. of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe engine conveyed 200 tons 45 miles in 95 minutes, consuming 21 cwt.\r\nof coke, and evaporating 1,806 gallons of water. She also drew a train\r\nof six carriages over the same distance without a stop, in 63 minutes,\r\nwith an expenditure of 13 cwt. of coke and 1,155 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of this engine, J. W. Hackworth sent the following\r\nchallenge to Robert Stephenson:—\r\n\r\n    “Sir,—It is now about 20 years since the competition for the\r\n    premium of locomotive superiority was played off at Rainhill,\r\n    on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Your father and mine\r\n    were the principal competitors. Since that period you have\r\n    generally been looked to by the public as standing first in\r\n    the construction of locomotive engines. Understanding that you\r\n    are now running on the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway a\r\n    locomotive engine which is said to be the best production that\r\n    ever issued from Forth Street Works, I come forward to tell you\r\n    publicly that I am prepared to contest with you, and prove to\r\n    whom the superiority in the construction of locomotive engines\r\n    now belongs.\r\n\r\n    “At the present crisis, when any reduction in the expense of\r\n    working the locomotive engine would justly be hailed as a boon\r\n    to railway companies, this experiment will no doubt be regarded\r\n    with deep interest as tending to their mutual advantage. I\r\n    fully believe that the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway\r\n    Company will willingly afford every facility towards the\r\n    carrying out of this experiment.\r\n\r\n    “Relying upon your honour as a gentleman, I hold this open for\r\n    a fortnight after the date of publication.\r\n\r\n                “I am, Sir, yours, etc., JOHN W. HACKWORTH.”\r\n\r\nWe do not think Robert Stephenson accepted the challenge; at all\r\nevents, no records of such a competition have ever been made public,\r\nand had it taken place the victor would have doubtless well published\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nThe “Sanspareil” frequently attained a speed of 75 miles an hour on\r\nfavourable portions of the line. She was sold to the North Eastern\r\nRailway by the executors shortly after the death of Timothy Hackworth,\r\nsomething like £3,000 being obtained for the engine, which continued\r\nto work upon the North Eastern Railway until recent years, having, of\r\ncourse, been rebuilt during the long time it was in active service.\r\n\r\nWe have now to describe another specimen of the locomotives constructed\r\nby the celebrated firm of Bury, Curtis and Kennedy. This locomotive was\r\none of the last engines built by the firm before its final dissolution.\r\nThe “Wrekin” was a six-wheel engine with inside bar frames and inside\r\ncylinders, and was constructed for the Birmingham and Shrewsbury\r\nRailway in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe special points noticeable in the construction of the engine in\r\nquestion are the width of the framing, which was arranged horizontally\r\ninstead of vertically, and only two bearings to each axle. The\r\naxle-boxes of the leading wheels were bolted to the frames, those of\r\nthe other wheels being welded to the frames, and the cylinders were\r\nalso directly affixed to the framing. An advantage claimed by the\r\nbuilders, as resulting from the method of construction employed, was\r\nthat the weight being placed entirely within the wheels, such weight\r\nhad a tendency to press down the axle between the bearings, and so\r\ncounteract the constant tendency arising from the flanges of the\r\nwheels, when pressing against the edge of the rails, especially in\r\npassing round curves.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were 15in. diameter, the stroke being 20in. The driving\r\nwheels were 5ft. 7in. diameter, the leading 4ft. 1in. and the trailing\r\n3ft. 7in.\r\n\r\nThe boiler contained 172 brass tubes, 11ft. 6in. long and 2⅛in.\r\nexternal diameter. The heating surface was: Tubes, 1,059 sq. ft.;\r\nfire-box, 80 sq. ft.; total, 1,139 sq. ft. Grate area, 15 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nNo steam dome was provided, the main steam-pipe being of iron, with\r\na longitudinal opening ³/₁₆th inches wide along the top; this pipe\r\nextended to the smoke-box, at which end of it the regulator valve was\r\nplaced; the actuating-rod passing through the main steam-pipe from end\r\nto end. Two encased Salter safety valves were fixed on the fire-box.\r\nThe wheel base of the “Wrekin” was: leading to driving, 8ft. 1in.;\r\ndriving to trailing, 6ft. 11in.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the Vulcan Foundry Company supplied the Caledonian Railway with\r\nan engine known as “No. 15.” In general appearance the locomotive was\r\nvery similar to Allan’s “Velocipede” engine on the London and North\r\nWestern Railway.\r\n\r\n“No. 15” (Fig. 57) was a six-wheel engine, with inclined outside\r\ncylinders, 15in. diameter and 20in. stroke. The driving wheels were\r\n6ft. diameter, leading and trailing wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter. The\r\nboiler barrel was 9ft. 9in. long and 3ft. 6¾4in. diameter, containing\r\n158 brass tubes of 1¾in. external diameter. Wheel base, L. to D., 6ft.;\r\nD. to T., 6ft. 6½in. The chimney was 6ft. 6in. high; on the centre\r\nof the boiler was a man-hole, surmounted by a column safety valve\r\nof Salter’s pattern, the blowing-off steam pressure being 90lb. The\r\nsteam dome was of brass, placed on the raised fire-box, and surmounted\r\nwith a second Salter’s safety valve. The driving and leading wheels\r\nwere provided with underhung springs, but the trailing wheels had the\r\nsprings over the axle-boxes. These latter springs were of elliptic\r\nshape, and were provided with a screw device fixed on the foot-plate,\r\nby means of which the weight was taken off the trailing wheels and\r\nthrown upon the driving wheels.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the semi-circular brass name-plates (_i.e._, Caledonian\r\nRailway) affixed to the splashers of the driving wheels, brass\r\nnumber-plates of diamond shape (12in. long by 6in. diameter) were fixed\r\non the buffer beams of “No. 15.” The tender was supported on four\r\nwheels, 3ft. 6in. diameter, and held 800 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—CALEDONIAN RAILWAY ENGINE, “No. 15”]\r\n\r\nDuring June, 1849, “No. 15” made a number of trial trips between\r\nGlasgow and Carlisle, with seven, eight, and nine coaches of an average\r\nweight of five tons each, the weight of the engine and tender being 28\r\ntons. On the trips to Glasgow the Beattock Summit had, of course to be\r\nclimbed. This consists of 10 miles of stiff gradients, varying between\r\n1 in 75, 80, and 88. The run of 13½ miles from Beattock to Elvanfoot,\r\nconsisting of the 10 miles just described and of 3½ down at 1 in 100,\r\nwas negotiated by “No. 15” in 33 minutes, with a train of six coaches;\r\nwith seven coaches the time was 41 minutes, and with a pilot and eleven\r\ncoaches, 30 minutes, or at the rate of 27 miles an hour. These were\r\nconsidered exceptionally good specimens of hill-climbing performances\r\n48 years back, but are, of course, entirely out of comparison with\r\nmodern Caledonian records over the same line with much heavier trains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—“MAC’S MANGLE,” No. 227, L. & N.W.R.]\r\n\r\nMcConnell, the locomotive superintendent of Wolverton, turned out\r\nseveral remarkable locomotives for the London and North Western\r\nRailway, and No. 227, or, as she was generally called, “Mac’s Mangle,”\r\n(Fig. 58), was one of these peculiar specimens of McConnell’s design.\r\nThe cylinders were of large size, being 18in. diameter, with a 24in.\r\nstroke; they were outside, as were also the axle bearings—a very\r\nuncommon combination. No. 227 was a six-wheel “single” engine, the\r\ndriving wheels being 6ft. 6in. diameter, and the leading and trailing\r\nwheels 4ft. diameter. The fire-box was of the raised pattern, and a\r\nSalter safety valve (encased) was fixed on it. A huge steam dome was\r\nprovided, located, originally, close to the smoke-box end of the boiler\r\nbarrel, but afterwards (in 1850) placed near the fire-box end, over\r\nthe driving wheels. The boiler-heating surface of “Mac’s Mangle” was\r\n1,383 sq. ft. No. 227 enjoyed but a short locomotive career, being\r\nbuilt in April, 1849, and “scrapped” in May, 1863. It is stated that\r\nin consequence of the extreme width of this engine, caused by outside\r\ncylinders being employed in conjunction with outside axle-boxes, it\r\nbecame necessary to set back the platforms at some of the stations, so\r\nthat the engine could clear these erections without coming to grief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—“PRESIDENT,” ONE OF McCONNELL’S “BLOOMERS,” L.\r\n& N.W.R AS ORIGINALLY BUILT]\r\n\r\nIn 1850 McConnell designed a very powerful class of passenger engines\r\nfor the L. and N. W. R. These are generally called the “Bloomers.”\r\n“President” (Fig. 59) illustrates this favourite class of L. and N. W.\r\nR. locomotive, when built. The cylinders were inside, 16in. diameter,\r\nwith a stroke of 22in. The driving wheels were 7ft. in diameter. The\r\nheating surface was 1,152 sq. ft. These engines weighed 28¾ tons. (Fig.\r\n60) is from a photo of a “Bloomer” as rebuilt by Ramsbottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—ONE OF McCONNELL’S “BLOOMERS” AS REBUILT BY\r\nRAMSBOTTOM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The locomotive exhibits of 1851—The “Hawthorn”—Wilson’s\r\n        two-boiler engine, the “Duplex”—Fairbairn’s tank engine—The\r\n        S.E.R. “Folkestone” on Crampton’s system—Sharp’s\r\n        “single” engines for the S.E.R.—J.

The British exhibitors\r\nshowed the following locomotives:—\r\n\r\n    London and North Western Railway’s “Cornwall” and “Liverpool.”\r\n    Great Western Railway’s “Lord of the Isles.”\r\n    Hawthorne’s express, “Hawthorn.”\r\n    Adams’ combined engine and carriage, “Ariel’s Girdle,”\r\n          built by Wilson and Co., Leeds.\r\n    England’s light locomotive, built by Fairbairn.\r\n    Fairbairn’s tank engine.\r\n    South Eastern Railway’s “Folkestone.”\r\n    E. B. Wilson and Co.’s double boiler tank engine.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these have been described in an earlier chapter, whilst\r\ndetails of other types (such as the “Lord of the Isles” type) have\r\nalso been given, so that it is not necessary to describe such designs\r\nagain. We have, however, to give particulars of Hawthorne’s express,\r\nFairbairn’s tank, the “Folkestone,” and Wilson’s “double boiler” tank\r\nengine. The dimensions of the first are: cylinders, 16in. diameter,\r\n22in. stroke; driving wheels, 6ft. 6in.; leading and trailing wheels,\r\n3ft. 9in. diameter; heating surface of fire-box, including water\r\nbridge, 110 sq. ft.; tubes, 865.4 sq. ft. The tubes were of brass, of\r\n2in. external diameter, and 158 in number.\r\n\r\nThe “Hawthorn” had inside cylinders and double sandwich frames,\r\na raised fire-box, with an enclosed safety valve, no dome, but a\r\nperforated steam-pipe for the collection of the steam was provided.\r\nThe engine was designed for running at 80 miles an hour; the special\r\nfeatures of the engine being double-compensating beams for distributing\r\nthe weight uniformly on all the wheels, equilibrium slide-valves, and\r\nan improved expansion link suspended from the slide-valve rods. Instead\r\nof fitting a spring to each wheel, two only were placed on each side\r\nof the engine between the wheels. These springs were inverted, and\r\nsustained by central straps attached to the framing. Their ends were\r\nconnected by short links to the wrought-iron double-compensating beams\r\nplaced longitudinally on each side of the engine, inside and beneath\r\nthe framing.\r\n\r\nThe two inner contiguous ends of these beams were linked by a\r\ntransverse pin to an eye at the bottom of the axle-box of the driving\r\naxle, whilst the opposite ends of the beams were respectively linked\r\nin a similar manner to eyes on the top of the leading and trailing\r\naxle-boxes. The action of these beams was obvious. By them a direct\r\nand simultaneous connection was given to all the axle bearings, and\r\nconsequently a uniform pressure was always maintained on all the\r\nwheels, irrespective of irregularities on the permanent-way. The slide\r\nvalves were placed on vertical faces in a single steam chest, located\r\nbetween the two cylinders. One slide-valve had a plate cast on its\r\nback, and the other had an open box cast on its back to receive a\r\npiston, which had its upper end parallel with the valve face. This\r\npiston was fitted steam-tight in the box, and its planed top bore\r\nagainst the face of the plate in working. By this arrangement the\r\nslides were relieved from half of the steam pressure; and to assist a\r\nfree exhaust, a port was made in the back plate of one of the slides,\r\nso providing an additional exit for the spent steam by means of the\r\npiston and the exhaust ports of the opposite valve.\r\n\r\nThe expansion link was placed in such a position as to allow the\r\nbottom of the boiler to be quite near the axle. The link, instead of\r\nbeing fixed to the ends of the eccentric-rods, so as to rise and fall\r\nwith them when the reversing lever was moved, was suspended from its\r\ncentre, by an eye, from the end of the slide-valve spindle. This\r\nremoved the weight of the link, etc., from off the reversing gear.\r\nThe eccentric-rods were jointed to the opposite ends of the link\r\nslide-block, to secure steadiness and durability of the parts. It\r\nwas claimed that this method of a fixed link-centre as fitted to the\r\n“Hawthorn” ensured a more correct action of the valves.\r\n\r\nWilson and Co., of the Railway Foundry, Leeds, exhibited a curious tank\r\nengine at the Exhibition of 1851, called the “Duplex,” in consequence\r\nof it being provided with two boilers. The idea of the designer was to\r\nobtain sufficient steam from an engine of light weight to haul a heavy\r\ntrain. The original drawings of this engine are still in the possession\r\nof Mr. David Joy, who designed it; and at first it was proposed to\r\nbuild the “Duplex” with three cylinders and six-coupled wheels, but\r\nafterwards fresh drawings were prepared, and it was from these latter\r\nones that the engine was built. The two boilers were placed side by\r\nside, and these each measured 10ft. 6in. long by 1ft. 9in. diameter,\r\nand together contained 136 tubes of 1¾in. diameter, the heating surface\r\nof which was 694 sq. ft., that of the fire-box being 61 sq. ft., making\r\na total of 755 sq. ft. The cylinders were outside, their diameter\r\nbeing 12½in., and the stroke 18in. The leading wheels were 3ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter; the driving and trailing (coupled) 5ft. diameter. Some other\r\ndimensions were:—Total length, 24ft. 3in.; breadth, 5ft. 3in.; height\r\nfrom rail to top of chimney, 13ft. 6in.; weight, empty, only 16 tons,\r\nwith fuel and water 19 tons 17 cwt. The capacity of tank was 520\r\ngallons, sufficient for a journey of 25 miles; coke bunker, 42 cubic\r\nfeet, equal to 26 bushels, or 15 cwt. The “Duplex” was sold to a Dutch\r\nrailway after the Exhibition, and its further career is, therefore,\r\nunknown to those interested in it.\r\n\r\nFairbairn’s tank locomotive was of the “well” type, supported on six\r\nwheels, the driving pair being 5ft. diameter, and the L. and T. each\r\n3ft. 6in. diameter. The cylinders were inside, measuring 10in. by 15in.\r\nstroke. The boiler was 8ft. long by 3ft. diameter, and contained 88\r\nbrass tubes of 2in. diameter. The heating surface amounted to 480 sq.\r\nft. The internal fire-box was of copper, and measured 2ft. 5in. long,\r\n3ft. wide, and 3ft. 5in. deep. The tank behind and under the foot-plate\r\nheld 400 gallons of water. The coke consumption of this little engine\r\nwas only 10lb. per mile with trains of six carriages, the weight in\r\nworking order only 13 tons; and it may interest our readers to know\r\nthat this diminutive locomotive was described as “a fair specimen of\r\nthe _heavier_ class of tank engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.-THE “FOLKESTONE,” A LOCOMOTIVE ON CRAMPTON’S\r\nSYSTEM. BUILT FOR THE S.E.R., 1851]\r\n\r\nThe engine calling for the greatest attention at the Exhibition of\r\n1851 was the “Folkestone” (Fig. 61), exhibited by the South Eastern\r\nRailway. This was an engine built by R. Stephenson and Co., under one\r\nof Crampton’s patents, but the principal feature in its design was\r\nan intermediate driving axle, connected by means of outside cranks,\r\nand coupling-rods to the driving wheels, which were (under Crampton’s\r\npatent) behind the fire-box, the axle extending across the foot-plate.\r\nIt will be well, perhaps, if we at this point reiterate the fact\r\nthat the method of working locomotives by means of an intermediate\r\ncrank-shaft was not introduced by Crampton, it having been used some\r\nyears previously by W. B. Adams, not to mention some of the early\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway engines, where the same arrangement was\r\nemployed, but with vertical cylinders. Readers will, therefore, see\r\nit is incorrect to describe locomotives with this system of machinery\r\nas “Crampton’s patent,” although it is quite possible for a “Crampton\r\npatent” locomotive to be provided with an intermediate driving shaft,\r\nas was the case with the “Folkestone.”\r\n\r\nEight engines of this type were built by Stephenson and Co. for the\r\nSouth Eastern Railway, and were numbered 136 to 143, the first of which\r\nwas named “Folkestone.” These engines were supported by six wheels, a\r\ngroup of four being arranged close together at the smoke-box end. Their\r\ndiameter was 3ft. 6in. The driving wheels were 6ft. in diameter, the\r\nwheel base 16ft. These engines weighed 26¼ tons each, of which only\r\n10 tons were on the driving wheels, the remainder of the weight being\r\nsupported by the four leading wheels. The cylinders were inside, 15in.\r\ndiameter, and the stroke 22in. The fire-box top was flush with the\r\nboiler barrel, the straight lines of which were unrelieved by a dome,\r\nbut an encased safety valve was fixed near the back of the fire-box\r\ntop. The boiler contained 184 tubes, of 2in. diameter and 11ft. in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe “Folkestone” ran its trial trip on Monday, March 31st, 1851,\r\nwhen Mr. McGregor, the chairman of the South Eastern Railway, Mr.\r\nR. Stephenson, the builder of the engine, Mr. Barlow, the South\r\nEastern engineer, and Mr. Cudworth, the South Eastern locomotive\r\nsuperintendent, were present. From London Bridge to Redhill no great\r\nspeed could be attained, as a Brighton train was in front; but beyond\r\nthe latter station, and with a train of nine carriages, the 19½\r\nmiles to Tonbridge were covered in 19½ minutes, a maximum speed of\r\n75 miles an hour being attained. After a short stop, the journey to\r\nAshford was resumed, and that town was reached in 20½ minutes after\r\nleaving Tonbridge. The times and distances were as follow:—Redhill to\r\nTonbridge, 19 miles 47 chains, start to stop in 19½ minutes; Tonbridge\r\nto Ashford, 26 miles 45 chains, start to stop in 20½ minutes, or at the\r\nrate of 78 miles an hour; the whole 46 miles 12 chains being covered\r\nin 40 minutes, running time, or, including the stop at Tonbridge, in\r\n43 minutes. It must be remembered that the line between Redhill and\r\nAshford is, perhaps, the most level and straight in England for so long\r\na distance.\r\n\r\nThese eight engines did not prove very successful in general working,\r\nand they were afterwards rebuilt as four-coupled engines, an ordinary\r\ncranked axle with wheels being provided in place of the intermediate\r\ndriving shaft.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place if we here mention eight “single” engines\r\nbuilt by Sharp Bros. in 1851 for the South Eastern Railway, and\r\nnumbered 144 to 151. The general dimensions were similar to the\r\nCramptons, except that the wheel base was only 15ft., and that the\r\nheating surface was 1,150 sq. ft. The admission of the steam to the\r\ncylinders was controlled by a hand lever, with catch and notches,\r\nsimilar to and placed by the side of the ordinary reversing lever. Six\r\neccentrics were on the driving axle, two of them working the pumps.\r\nThe framing and springs of these engines were afterwards perpetuated\r\nby Cudworth in his later and better known types of South Eastern\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—ONE OF J. V. GOOCH’S “SINGLE” TANK ENGINES,\r\nEASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe locomotives of the despised “Eastern Counties,” that were designed\r\nabout 1850 by Mr. J. V. Gooch, will now be concisely described. They\r\nwere of three kinds—viz., “single” tanks, “single” express, and\r\nfour-wheels-coupled tender engines. Of the tanks, three sizes were\r\nconstructed, chiefly at the “Hudson Town” (or Stratford Works). The\r\nlargest of these were provided with outside cylinders, 14in. diameter\r\nand 22in. stroke, the boiler being 10ft. 6in. long, and containing\r\n164 tubes of 1³/₁₆th in. diameter. The leading and trailing wheels\r\nhad outside bearings, the driving wheels being provided with inside\r\nbearings only. A steam dome was placed over the raised fire-box, and a\r\nscrew-lever safety valve on the boiler barrel. The water was stored in\r\ntwo tanks, fixed between the frames, one below the boiler and the other\r\nbeneath the foot-plate. These tank engines were known as the “250”\r\nclass, and some of our readers may recollect that when Peto, Brassey\r\nand Betts leased the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, engines\r\nof this design were used to work the traffic on that railway. We\r\nunderstand it is now 20 years since the last of them (No. 08) reached\r\nthe final bourne of worn-out locomotives—the “scrap heap.”\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the smallest class of these tanks (Fig. 62) were:\r\nCylinders, 12in. diameter, 22in. stroke; boiler, 10ft. long and 3ft.\r\n2in. diameter, 127 tubes of 1⅞th in. diameter; the total heating\r\nsurface was 709 sq. ft.; grate area, 9.7 sq. ft. The driving wheels\r\nwere 6ft. 6in. diameter, and the L. and T. 3ft. 8in. The total weight\r\nof these engines was 23 tons 19 cwt., of which 9 tons 14 cwt. was on\r\nthe driving axle. The wheel base was: L. to D., 6ft. 3in.; D. to T.,\r\n5ft. 9in.\r\n\r\nJ. V. Gooch’s four-coupled, or “Butterflies,” had leading wheels 3ft.\r\n8in. diameter, and driving and trailing (coupled) 5ft. 6in. Wheel base,\r\nL. to D., 6ft. 3in.; D. to T., 7ft. 9in. The cylinders were 15in.\r\ndiameter, the stroke being 24in. The boilers of this class, and also of\r\nthe singles, next to be described, were of the same dimensions as those\r\nof the “250” class of tanks.\r\n\r\nThe “single” expresses were provided with 6ft. 6in. driving wheels, and\r\ncylinders 15in. diameter and a 22in. stroke; in this class also the\r\nleading and trailing wheels were 3ft. 8in. diameter. The wheel base\r\nwas 14ft., the driving wheels being 6ft. 9in. from the leading and\r\n7ft. 3in. from the trailing wheels. Ten engines of this design were\r\nconstructed, some at Stratford, and others at the then recently opened\r\nCanada Works of Brassey and Co. at Birkenhead. Their official numbers\r\nwere from 274 to 283.\r\n\r\nThe “Ely” (Fig. 63) represents the type of 6-wheel passenger engine\r\nin use on the Taff Vale Railway at this period. She was built in 1851\r\nby Messrs. Kitson and Company, from Taff Vale designs. She had 13in.\r\ncylinders, with 20in. stroke, and four-wheels-coupled, of 5ft. 3in.\r\ndiameter. She carried a pressure of 100lbs., she had a four-wheel\r\ntender, carrying 900 gallons of water, and as the gross weight of the\r\ntender was about 11 tons in working order, the gross weight of the\r\nengine and tender would be 33 tons. The “Ely” could not take a train of\r\nthree carriages, weighing only 21 tons, up the Abercynon bank of 1 in\r\n40 without the assistance of a “bank” engine.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Mr. Beattie, the locomotive superintendent at Nine Elms, built\r\nfor the London and South Western Railway the four-wheels-coupled\r\nengine, “Hercules,” No. 48. The frames of this engine were of the\r\n“lattice” type, examples of which can be still seen on some of the\r\nolder Great Northern Railway tanks.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of wheels was: L., 3ft. 6in.; D. and T., 5ft. 6in.;\r\ntender, 3ft. 6in.; wheel base, L. to D., 7ft. 1in.; D. to T., 6ft.\r\n6in.; T. to leading tender, 7ft. 3½in.; the tender wheel base being\r\n10ft. 3in. equally divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—“ELY,” A TAFF VALE RAILWAY ENGINE, BUILT IN\r\n1851]\r\n\r\nThe weight was distributed as follows:—Engine, L. axle, 8 tons 17 cwt.;\r\nD., 9 tons 17 cwt.; T., 9 tons 16 cwt.; tender, L., 4 tons 19 cwt.;\r\nM., 6 tons 19 cwt.; T., 7 tons 10 cwt. The cylinders were 15in. by\r\n22in.; tractive force on rail, 7,500lb.; 1,800 gallons of water could\r\nbe carried in the tender tank. The “Hercules” had a flush top boiler,\r\nand a raised fire-box surmounted by a large inverted, urn-shaped dome.\r\nThis design of locomotive was a favourite one on the London and South\r\nWestern Railway for many years, but the last engine of the kind has now\r\nbeen scrapped.\r\n\r\nHaving favoured the London and South Western Railway, to equalise\r\nmatters, we cannot do better than give a description of a locomotive\r\nbelonging to its cousin-german, the London and North Western Railway.\r\nThe latter was indeed the more famous, being no other than McConnell’s\r\nnotorious “No. 300,” (Fig. 64) which, being introduced with a vast\r\namount of publicity, became a nine days’ wonder, then sank into\r\nquiescent mediocrity, and after a brief locomotive career, was seen no\r\nmore—a rather different fate, be it observed, to that of the London and\r\nSouth Western Railway’s “Hercules.”\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that only one drawing of this engine exists. This\r\nis incorrect; the writer possesses a complete set of drawings relating\r\nto “No. 300,” together with the whole of the specifications from which\r\nthe engine was constructed. To reproduce this specification in detail\r\nwould give too technical a character to this narrative, and would try\r\nthe patience of even the most ardent locomotive enthusiast.\r\n\r\nThe directors of the London and North Western Railway in 1851\r\nexpressed their determination to run their express trains from London\r\nto Birmingham in two hours, and gave instructions to McConnell, the\r\nlocomotive superintendent at Wolverton, to design the necessary\r\nlocomotives. The salient features of the design were: Inside cylinders,\r\n18in. by 14in.; six wheels, with inside and outside frames; driving\r\nwheels, 7ft. 6in. diameter; leading, 4ft. 6in.; and trailing, 4ft.\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was 11ft. 9in. long and 4ft. 3¼in. external diameter. The\r\ntubes were of brass, 303 in number, only 7ft. in length, and 1¾in.\r\noutside diameter. The crank axle bearings were—outside, 7in. deep and\r\n10in. in length, the inside ones being 7in. and 4¼in. respectively. The\r\nleading and training axles were hollow, the metal being 1½in. thick,\r\nand the hollow centre 4½in. diameter, thus making the total diameter of\r\nthe straight axles 7½in. The slide-valves had an outside lap of 1¼in.\r\nThe principal innovations were: Coleman’s patent india-rubber springs,\r\nfitted below the driving axle and above the leading and trailing\r\naxles, and also to the buffers. McDonnell’s patent dished wrought-iron\r\npistons, forged in one piece with the piston-rod, and encased with\r\ncontinuous undulating flat metal packing. The steam-pipe was of flat\r\nsection, and passed through a superheating chest in the smoke-box; the\r\nsteam was thus dried during its journey from the dome to the cylinders.\r\nThe great feature of the design was the arrangement of the fire-box,\r\nwith a mid-feather, a combustion chamber, hollow stays for a free\r\nsupply of air to the fire-box, and the cutting away of the bottom of\r\nthe fire-box to obtain clearance for the cranks and yet retain a low\r\ncentre of gravity with large driving wheels. Assertion to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, it should be observed that so much did McConnell\r\ninsist upon a low centre of gravity that he specially mentioned it in\r\nhis patent specification of February 28th, 1852.\r\n\r\nA more particular description of the fire-box, etc., is requisite. It\r\nextended into the cylindrical portion of the boiler a distance of 4ft.\r\n9in., so that the boiler tubes were only 7ft. long. The whole length\r\nof the fire-box was 10ft. 6in.; depth at front-plate 6ft. 5in., at\r\ndoor-plate 6ft. 10in.; length on fire-bars 5ft. 10¼in., thus leaving\r\n4ft. 7¾in. for the portion over the axle and the combustion chamber. At\r\nits narrow part (directly at the top of the recess above the driving\r\naxle) the fire-box was only 2ft. 3in. in height; height at tube-plate\r\n3ft. (beyond the cut away portion); width at tube-plate 3ft. 9in. It\r\nwill be noticed that Webb’s “Greater Britain” class of locomotives is\r\ndesigned with the long fire-box and combustion chamber; but as Mr.\r\nWebb, unlike McConnell, does not object to the high pitched boiler, the\r\nformer does not recess the boiler barrel for the purpose of obtaining\r\na low centre. Webb also divides his tubes into two sets by having\r\nthe combustion chamber between them. McConnell’s combustion chamber\r\nwas a continuation of the fire-box. We must now describe the general\r\nappearance of this engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—McCONNELL’S “300,” LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were inclined upwards from the front, and the valve\r\nchests were above them, below the smoke-box. Two Salter safety valves\r\nwere provided, encased within a sheet-brass covering of Stirling’s\r\nGreat Northern pattern. The steam pressure was 150lbs. The dome was\r\nalso of brass, with a hemispherical top surmounting the cylindrical\r\nlower part. The steam regulator was at the mouth of the steam-pipe,\r\nwhich was placed at the top of the dome (inside, of course).\r\n\r\nThe heating surface was: Tubes, 980 sq. ft.; fire-box, 260 sq. ft.\r\nWheel base, 16ft. 10in. Sufficient steam could be raised in 45 minutes\r\nafter lighting the fire to move the engine. Two of these engines\r\nwere built about the same time—one (No. 300) by Fairbairn and Co.,\r\nManchester, the other by E. B. Wilson and Co., Leeds. The orders were\r\ngiven early in July, 1852, and the engines delivered the second week\r\nin November, Wilson and Co. having occupied but eight weeks in the\r\nconstruction of the one given to them.\r\n\r\nBoth engines were delivered at Wolverton on the same day, and on\r\nThursday, November 11th, 1852, Wilson’s engine was tried for the first\r\ntime, when on her first journey to Euston she attained a speed of 60\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that “No. 300” and her sister engine were unable\r\nto cover the 111 miles—Euston to Birmingham—in two hours, as\r\nwas confidently predicted, and the failure to do so was—perhaps\r\njustly—attributed to the inferior condition of the permanent-way. On\r\nMarch 8th, 1853, “No. 300” hauled a train of 34 carriages, weighing 170\r\ntons, from Birmingham to London in three hours eight minutes, including\r\nfive stoppages. A similar train drawn by the “Heron” and “Prince of\r\nWales” took ten minutes longer to perform the same journey. These two\r\nengines had cylinders 15in. by 20in., and 6ft. driving wheels. The\r\nresults of this trial are thus tabulated:—\r\n\r\n    --------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n                        |           |           |  Average   | Maximum\r\n                        |   Coke.   |    Coke   |   speed    |  speed\r\n                        |           | per mile. | per hour.  | per hour.\r\n    --------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n    No. 300             | 4,529 lb. |  40.8 lb. | 36.4 miles |   54\r\n    “Heron” &           | 4,851 lb. |  43.7 lb. | 34.5 miles |   48\r\n      “Prince of Wales” |           |           |            |\r\n    --------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nUpon the result of this run it was claimed that McConnell’s patent\r\nengines were considerably superior to two of the ordinary London and\r\nNorth Western Railway locomotives, and one of Stephenson’s “long\r\nboiler” abortions was altered by McConnell, being fitted up with his\r\npatent combustion chamber, short tubes, and the other innovations, as\r\nmentioned in our description of “No. 300.”\r\n\r\nThe “long boiler” originally had 1,013 sq. ft. of tube-heating surface;\r\nwhen altered, the length of the tubes was reduced to 4¾ft., and some\r\nadditional ones were fixed diagonally across the combustion chamber. By\r\nthis alteration the tube-heating surface was reduced to 547 sq. ft.,\r\nand the engine is stated to have drawn 170 tons at 60 miles an hour,\r\nand to have attained a speed of 70 miles an hour with light trains.\r\nFrom the working of this locomotive the following table (by which a\r\nreduction of 23 per cent. in the amount of fuel consumed was claimed\r\nfor the altered engine) was prepared:—\r\n\r\n    --------+------+--------+-------------+----------+----------\r\n            |Miles |Average |   Coke      |   Coke   |  Coke\r\n            | run. | load.  | consumed.   | per mile.| per ton\r\n            |      |        |             |          | per mile.\r\n    --------+------+--------+-------------+----------+----------\r\n    Original|29,442|115 tons|1,715,952 lb.|58·28 lb. |·564 lb.\r\n    Altered |12,060|144 tons|519,120 lb.  |43·04 lb. |·298 lb.\r\n    --------+------+--------+-------------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nBut D. K. Clark’s paper on “Locomotive Boilers,” read before the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers, soon placed a very different complexion\r\nupon the result of the trials between the ordinary and patent engines,\r\nresulting in the “air-tubes” to the combustion chamber being speedily\r\nabandoned. The attention of the directors of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway was called to the failure of these engines, with the\r\nresult that they ordered Messrs. Marshall and Wood to report on the two\r\nclasses of engines—viz., the ordinary London and North Western type and\r\nMcConnell’s patent locomotives. This report was ready in August, 1853,\r\nbut for some reason its publication was suppressed at the time, but\r\nthe directors countermanded the construction of other engines already\r\nordered on McDonnell’s patent principle.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1854 Marshall and Wood conducted another set of\r\nexperiments for the directors of the London and North Western Railway,\r\nwith the object of determining the relative value of coke and coal as\r\nfuel for the locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe engines chosen were McConnell’s patent “No. 303” and the “Bloomer,”\r\nNo. 293. Double trips were run between Rugby and London daily for six\r\nconsecutive days, coal being burnt on three days and coke on the three\r\nalternate days. The trains chosen were the 12.55 p.m. up and 5.45 p.m.\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIt was found that 1lb. of coal evaporated 5.83lb. of water, and 1lb. of\r\ncoke 8.65lb. of water; but the monetary saving was 6s. 9d. per ton in\r\nfavour of coal.\r\n\r\nMcConnell’s patent engines were again condemned. Marshall and Wood’s\r\nreport concluded as follows: “Although we consider the experiments we\r\nmade with No. 303 engine satisfactory in point of smoke burning, we\r\ncannot resist the belief that the consumption of coal is in excess\r\nof what it ought to be, and that there is room for considerable\r\nimprovement in this respect, by means which shall tend to utilise the\r\nheat which is at present wasted.”\r\n\r\nThe whole report is of great interest to the technical reader; it is,\r\nhowever, too long to reproduce _in extenso_.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident that there is no great pecuniary gain from\r\nlocomotive designing, or we should be treated to great law-suits\r\nregarding the validity of the patents, such as have recently been\r\nthe case with pneumatic tyres and incandescent gas-burners. We have\r\nalready, upon more occasions than one, pointed out that certain\r\npatented locomotive designs had previously been anticipated, although\r\nthe later patentees were probably unaware of the fact. We find this\r\nto have been the case with McConnell’s “recessed” boiler locomotives\r\njust described, for on December 2nd, 1846, W. Stubbs and J. J. Grylls,\r\nof Llanelly, enrolled a design of locomotive. The specification in\r\nquestion not only mentioned the recessing of the boiler for the purpose\r\nof allowing the use of a large driving wheel and yet retaining a low\r\ncentre of gravity, but it even anticipated McConnell’s combustion\r\nchamber between the fire-box and tubes. An adaptation of Bodmer’s\r\ndouble piston motion was also specified by Stubbs and Grylls. The two\r\ncylinders were placed below the boiler, four wheels being connected by\r\nmeans of side-rods with the cross-heads of the two cylinders in such\r\na manner that from each cylinder two wheels were driven, by means of\r\na cross-head, and each cross-head, by means of two connecting-rods,\r\nrotating the wheels. Another claim under this patent related to driving\r\na locomotive by eccentrics fitted with antifriction rollers as a\r\nsubstitute for the ordinary cranks.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the “Evolution of the Steam Locomotive” it is only\r\nintended to describe locomotives for British railways, it may not\r\nbe out of place to mention an engine for a foreign railway, for two\r\nreasons—first, because it was built by an English firm in England,\r\nand, secondly, because it was tried on an English railway before\r\nexportation. The “Ysabel” was constructed in 1853 by Dodds and Sons,\r\nof Rotherham, for the “Railway of Isabella II. from Santander to Abar\r\ndel Rey,” and was tried on the Lickey incline of 1 in 37 for two miles,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Stalvies, the locomotive superintendent at\r\nBroomsgrove. The “Ysabel” had four-coupled wheels 4ft. 6in. diameter;\r\ncylinders, 14¼in. by 20in. stroke; 137 tubes, 1⅞in. diameter, and 11ft.\r\n3in. in length, and was fitted with Dodds’ patent wedge expansive\r\nmotion, which required only two eccentrics. For the purpose of easy\r\ntransportation, the “Ysabel” was so constructed that when disconnected\r\nno single portion weighed more than six tons; in addition to the\r\nfittings necessary to secure the boiler, the only connections between\r\nit and the frames, machinery, etc., were the steam-pipe and the two\r\nfeed-pump connections. When tried upon the Lickey bank this locomotive\r\nhauled six trucks weighing 45 tons 12¾ cwt. up the two miles one\r\nfurlong in 12 minutes 12 seconds, and with a train weighing 29 tons 4¼\r\ncwt. the incline was negotiated in seven minutes five seconds.\r\n\r\nThe compound locomotive is not quite so modern an invention as is\r\npopularly supposed, for, putting aside the suggestion emanating in 1850\r\nfrom John Nicholson, an Eastern Counties Railway engine-driver, whose\r\nplan of continuous expansion is generally accepted as the foundation of\r\nthe compound system, we find that in 1853 a Mr. Edwards, of Birmingham,\r\npatented a “duplex” or in other words a compound engine, the steam,\r\nafter working in a high-pressure cylinder, being used over again in a\r\nlow-pressure one. The cylinders were so placed that the dead centre in\r\none occurred when the other piston was at its maximum power.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Beattie constructed for the London and South Western Railway\r\nat Nine Elms Works, the “Duke,” No. 123, a six-wheel “single” express\r\nengine; driving wheels, 6ft. 6in. diameter; L. and T. 3ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter; cylinders, 16in. by 21in. stroke. The weight was arranged in\r\nan extraordinary manner, 10 tons 9 cwt. being on the leading axle, only\r\n9 tons 9 cwt. on the driving axle, and 5 tons 11 cwt. on the trailing\r\naxle. The wheel base was, L. to D., 6ft. 8½in.; D. to T., 7ft. 6in.\r\nThe “Duke” had a raised fire-box, surmounted by a large dome similar\r\nto that of the “Hercules,” whilst another dome was located on the\r\ncentre of the boiler barrel. The shape of this centre dome resembled a\r\nsoup-tureen turned upside down.\r\n\r\nAt this point we take the opportunity to briefly describe a railway\r\nlocomotive which, although not propelled by steam, deserves to be\r\nmentioned as an initial attempt at railway haulage by means of\r\ncompressed air.\r\n\r\nThe engine in question was constructed by Arthur Pasey, and was tried\r\non the Eastern Counties Railway in July, 1852. This machine was, in\r\npoint of size and power, nothing more than a model, the dimensions\r\nbeing: Cylinders, 2½in. diameter, 9in. stroke; driving wheels, 4ft.\r\ndiameter; weight, 1½ tons; air capacity of reservoirs, 39 cubic ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—PASEY’S COMPRESSED AIR LOCOMOTIVE, TRIED ON THE\r\nEASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY IN 1852]\r\n\r\nBy reference to the illustration (Fig. 65) it will be seen that this\r\ncurious little locomotive had the six wheels of 4ft. diameter within\r\nthe frames, and the horizontal cylinders outside the frames, and\r\nactuating the centre pair of wheels. Above the frames was placed a\r\ncylindrical air reservoir, with egg shaped ends. This extended from\r\nthe buffer beam at one end of the vehicle to the leading axle, a\r\ndistance of about 12ft. The remainder of the space, about 4ft., was\r\noccupied by the pressure-reducing and other apparatus, and afforded\r\na place of vantage for those in charge of the machine. The reservoir\r\nwas constructed to withstand a pressure of 200lb., but the engine was\r\nonly pressed to 165lb., and this at the time of the trial at Stratford\r\nwas reduced to 20lb. working pressure. With a load of eight people,\r\nthe engine ran the four miles, Stratford to Lea Bridge and back, in\r\n30 minutes. The incident of the trial so aroused the curiosity of\r\nthe men engaged at the Stratford Works, that they all left their\r\nemployment for the purpose of witnessing the trial of so great an\r\ninnovation as Pasey’s compressed air locomotive. For this reason no\r\nfurther trials could be held at Stratford, but on July 2nd a second\r\ntrip was made at Cambridge, and on this occasion, with six passengers,\r\nthe following results were recorded: Starting from the 60th mile-post\r\nnear the Waterbeach Junction, with a working pressure of 15lb. per sq.\r\nin., the first mile was covered in five minutes. By increasing the\r\npressure on the pistons, the second mile was covered in four minutes;\r\nthe pressure was then reduced to 18.85lb., and 3½ additional miles\r\nwere covered in ten minutes. The designer of this little machine gives\r\neight reasons by which he apparently succeeds—at all events to his\r\nown satisfaction—in proving the great superiority of compressed air\r\ntraction over that of steam. Unfortunately for Mr. Pasey’s theory,\r\nsteam is still triumphant, and compressed air dead—or nearly so—for\r\ntractive purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—THE FIRST TYPE OF GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY\r\nPASSENGER ENGINE, ONE OF THE “LITTLE SHARPS”]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Great Northern Railway next claims our attention.\r\nThe first locomotives were supplied by contract, an order for 50\r\npassenger engines having been given to Sharp Bros. and Co. These were\r\nsix-wheel single engines (Fig. 66), the driving wheels being 5ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter. The cylinders were 15in. by 20in. stroke. Weight of engine,\r\nloaded, 18 tons 8½ cwt. These engines were called “Little Sharps,” and\r\n(Fig. 66) is an illustration of one of them.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe the famous “No. 215” (Fig. 67) of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway, designed towards the end of 1852 by Mr. Archibald\r\nSturrock, constructed by Hawthorn and Co., Newcastle, and delivered to\r\nthe Great Northern Railway on August 6th, 1853.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Sturrock has supplied the writer with complete and\r\nauthentic details, together with a drawing, of this engine, so that\r\nreaders may rely upon the information being strictly accurate, although\r\nit should be noted that it does not correspond in several particulars\r\nwith other statements concerning “No. 215” that have been published.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of railway history that in 1852 the “Gladstone” award\r\nsettled the great rivalry existing at that period between the London\r\nand North Western and Great Northern Railways. The competition had\r\nbeen carried on in a manner still in favour in American railroad\r\nwarfare—viz., the cutting of rates and fares; but Mr. Gladstone having\r\ndecided this point, the Great Northern Railway introduced the method of\r\nrivalry now universally recognised as English railway competition—that\r\nis, trial of speed. Mr. Sturrock, with the experience gained under the\r\ndaring broad-gauge leaders, was, of course, conversant with what a\r\nlocomotive could do, and his published reasons for the construction of\r\n“No. 215” are as follow:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—STURROCK’S MASTERPIECE, THE FAMOUS G.N.R. “215”]\r\n\r\n“This engine was constructed to prove to the directors of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway that it was quite practicable to reach Edinburgh\r\nfrom King’s Cross in eight hours, by only stopping at Grantham, York,\r\nNewcastle, and Berwick. This service was not carried out, because there\r\nwas no demand by travellers for, nor competition amongst, the railways\r\nto give the public such accommodation.”\r\n\r\nAlthough delayed for 35 years, the demand for such a service arose in\r\n1888, and Mr. Sturrock then had the satisfaction of seeing runs such\r\nas he had built “No. 215” to perform become daily accomplished facts.\r\nIt should be noted that when “No. 215” was originally built, she was\r\nfitted with a leading bogie, such an arrangement being a principal\r\nfeature of Mr. Sturrock’s original design for the engine. The bogie\r\nand trailing wheels were 4ft. 3in. diameter, the driving wheels being\r\n7ft. 6in. diameter; the cylinders were inside, and had a diameter of\r\n17½in., with a stroke of 24in. The heating surface was large, this\r\nbeing another of the strong points in Mr. Sturrock’s design. Tubes,\r\n1,564 sq. ft.; fire-box, 155.2 sq. ft.; total heating surface, 1,718.2\r\nsq. ft. The weight was, empty, 32 tons 11 cwt. 2 qr.; in working order,\r\n37 tons 9 cwt. 2 qr. Wheel base, 21ft. 8½in. Water capacity of tender,\r\n2,505 gallons. The frames and axle bearings were outside; the latter\r\nwere curved above the driving axle, as in the broad-gauge “Lord of the\r\nIsles” type.\r\n\r\nThe boiler and raised fire-box were also after the same pattern. The\r\nengine had no dome, but an encased safety valve on the fire-box—a\r\nfurther evidence of attention to the Swindon practice. Compensation\r\nbeams connected the two pairs of bogie wheels, and the underhung\r\nsprings of the driving wheels were also connected with the trailing\r\naxle springs by means of compensation levers. “No. 215” frequently ran\r\nat 75 miles an hour. She appears to have been broken up about 29 years\r\nback, for in 1870 Mr. Stirling built an engine, “No. 92,” in which\r\nhe used the 7ft. 6in. driving wheels of Mr. Sturrock’s famous “215.”\r\nEngine No. 92, is still at work, so that the driving wheels must be 45\r\nyears old. A comparison of Mr. Sturrock’s “215” with McConnell’s “300”\r\nwill show the immense superiority of the former, especially with regard\r\nto the amount of heating surface, the pitch of the boiler, and the\r\nbogie in place of the rigid wheel base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—PEARSON’S 9FT. “SINGLE” TANK ENGINE, BRISTOL\r\nAND EXETER RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, Mr. Pearson’s initial patent for a locomotive was\r\ndescribed, and a description of his famous double-bogie tank engines,\r\nwith 9ft. “single” driving wheels, is given below. The design (Fig.\r\n68), which was brought out in 1853, was a modification of the patent\r\nspecification already alluded to. The engines were constructed by\r\nRothwell and Co., Union Foundry, Bolton-le-Moors, and were famous for\r\nthe low average cost for repairs and fuel consumption per mile run;\r\nindeed, a feature of most of the broad-gauge locomotives was the low\r\naverage cost of maintenance and working. The ends of the frames were\r\nsupported on a four-wheel bogie, the wheels of which were 4ft. in\r\ndiameter, and the driving wheels 9ft. diameter; these latter had no\r\nflanges. The cylinders (the ends of which projected beyond the front\r\nof the smoke-box) were 16½in. diameter and 24in. stroke; the driving\r\naxle was above the frame. The boiler was 10ft. 9in. long and 4ft. ½in.\r\ndiameter; it contained 180 brass tubes of one and thirteen-sixteenths\r\ninch external diameter. The steam pressure was 130lb. No dome was\r\nprovided, and the Salter safety valves were located on the top of the\r\nfire-box and enclosed by a brass casing. The weight of the engine, in\r\nworking order, was 42 tons. The water was stored in three tanks, one\r\nbeneath the boiler, another below the fire-box, and the usual well\r\ntank, behind the foot-plate. The two suspended tanks were connected by\r\nmeans of a stuffing-box jointed pipe, which was continued to the bottom\r\nof the wheel tank, so that the water in the three tanks was thus able\r\nto pass from one tank to any other one. The feed pumps were worked from\r\nthe piston-rod cross-head, and the feed-pipes passed along behind the\r\nsplashers to the boiler. To steady the suspended tanks, link-rods were\r\npassed between the two. There were also “bogie safety links” connecting\r\nthe bogie frames with the main frame at each end, and similar links\r\nconnected the suspended tanks with the other ends of the bogie frames.\r\n\r\nThese links were each fitted with india-rubber disc buffers, to allow\r\nof the necessary elastic working. The parts were thus so strongly\r\nlinked together, that should a bogie centre-pin break, or should the\r\nbogie movement fail in any way, the wheels would still remain in their\r\nright position. The whole of the springs were of the india-rubber disc\r\nkind. Those of the driving axle presented some remarkable peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThey were double, an elastic connection being formed between the boiler\r\nand the axle-boxes by large plate brackets projecting from the boiler\r\nbarrel, and carrying centre studs for a short double-armed lever; each\r\nend of this lever had a separate spring-box attached to it by a long\r\nlink.\r\n\r\nThe inner spring-box worked down behind the disc plate of the driving\r\nwheel splashers, whilst the outer one worked parallel to it, outside\r\nthe driving wheel.\r\n\r\nThe springs for the other wheels were all beneath their axles, and were\r\nvery compact and neat in appearance. The brake action was confined to\r\nthe after bogie, all four wheels being used for the frictional effect,\r\nthe sliding bars carrying the brake blocks being actuated in reverse\r\ndirections by a screw spindle, which carried a winch to be worked by\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—ONE OF PEARSON’S 9FT. “SINGLE” TANKS, TAKEN\r\nOVER BY THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe regulator valve was a slide, worked in a simple and certainly a\r\nconvenient manner by a short lever, set on a pillar stud on the front\r\nof the fire-box, and passing through a slot in the end of the slide\r\nspindle. This was a far more effective plan of working the valve than\r\nthe ordinary rotatory handle.\r\n\r\nThese engines were remarkable for their steady running at high speeds,\r\n80 miles an hour and over being a daily performance of the engines on\r\ncertain portions of the main line between Exeter and Bristol.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the freedom from excessive oscillation for which these\r\nengines were famous was attributable to the 9ft. driving wheels, and\r\nthe slow piston velocity arising therefrom; thus with 6ft. wheels at a\r\nspeed of 60 miles an hour, the pistons have to make no less than 280\r\ndouble strokes per minute without making allowance for “slip.” With the\r\n9ft. driving wheels the double piston strokes per minute at 60 miles\r\nan hour fall to 186, and consequently with so considerable a reduction\r\nin the movements of the reciprocating and rotating machinery of the\r\nlocomotive, it is only reasonable to expect and obtain a much more\r\nsteady movement of the machine.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of coal consumption the engines were no less successful.\r\nWriting in August, 1856, Mr. Pearson reported: “Engine No. 40 has run\r\n81,790 miles since her delivery in October, 1853, and has consumed 794\r\ntons 17 cwt. 2 qr. of coke, or 21.76lb. per mile; the repairs as yet\r\nhave been very trifling, consisting chiefly of re-turning the tyres.\r\nThis engine has been working passenger trains on the main line almost\r\nthe whole of the time since she was delivered. Our mileage is rather\r\nheavy, each engine averaging 750 miles per week.”\r\n\r\nAfter 1876, when the Bristol and Exeter Railway was amalgamated with\r\nthe Great Western Railway and the former company’s locomotive stock\r\nbecame the property of the latter, 4 of the 8 original 9ft. tank\r\nengines then in existence were rebuilt, and their character and design\r\nentirely remodelled. The diameter of the driving wheels was reduced to\r\n8ft., and tyres fitted to them, a pair of trailing wheels were provided\r\nin place of the rear bogie, and a separate tender was added, the tanks\r\nbeing done away with. The B. and E.R. numbers of these engines were\r\n39 to 46. The G.W.R. numbered the four taken over 2001 to 2004. The\r\nlatter was hauling the “Flying Dutchman” when the Long Ashton accident\r\nhappened on July 27th, 1876. It was in consequence of this disaster\r\nthat the engines were rebuilt with 8ft. wheels. In concluding this\r\nsketch of Pearson’s famous broad-gauge double tanks, we may state that\r\nuntil recent years, when phenomenally high locomotive speeds have been\r\nrecorded, these engines held the “blue ribbon” in that respect with an\r\nauthenticated speed of 81 miles an hour. Figures 69 and 70 represent\r\nthem as rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—A BRISTOL & EXETER RAILWAY TANK ENGINE, AS\r\nREBUILT (WITH TENDER) BY THE G.W.R.]\r\n\r\nThe Furness Railway Company is certainly notorious for the manner in\r\nwhich it preserves its locomotives; not only has it the two old Bury\r\nengines (already described) yet in active service, but there are still\r\nat work on the same Company’s iron roads other engines manufactured\r\nas long ago as 1854. These locomotives are first cousins to Bury’s\r\nfour wheel (coupled) goods engines; they were built by Fairbairn, of\r\nManchester, and have cylinders 15in. diameter, with a stroke of 24in.\r\nOf course, they are technically inside cylinder—i.e., of the Bury\r\n“inside” type, with the cylinders within the frames, but below the\r\nsmoke-box, instead of within it. The cylinders are, in fact, but a few\r\ninches above rail level; they incline upwards, and the connecting-rods\r\npass beneath the leading axle and actuate the trailing axle; the four\r\nwheels are 4ft. 9in. diameter, and are coupled by means of round\r\nsection side-rods; the wheel base is 7ft. 9in.; the frames are of the\r\ninside bar pattern; the fire-box is round, with circular top, and\r\nsurmounted by a double Salter safety valve. The boiler is 11ft. 2in.\r\nlong and of 3ft. 11in. mean diameter; it contains 148 tubes, 2in.\r\ndiameter. The total heating surface is 940 sq. ft.; steam pressure,\r\n120lb.; weight of engine in working order, 22½tons. There is no dome on\r\nthe boiler; but some modern attachments have been fixed on the upper\r\nportion of the round fire-box, the steam pressure gauge being very\r\nnoticeable. The tender is supported on four wheels of 3ft. diameter,\r\nthe wheel base being 8ft., capacity of tank 1,000 gallons, and coal\r\nspace 100ft.; weight in working order, 14½ tons. The tender has outside\r\nframes, and the brake actuates blocks to both sides of the four wheels.\r\nThese engines are used for working goods and mineral traffic over the\r\nFurness Railway. The particular engine we have been describing is “No.\r\n9.”\r\n\r\n“Ovid” (Fig. 71) represents a type of bogie saddle-tank engines, with\r\nfour-coupled wheels, designed by D. Gooch for working the passenger\r\ntrains on the steep inclines of the South Devon Railway. The cylinders\r\nwere 17in. diameter, with a stroke of 24in. The coupled wheels were\r\n5ft. in diameter. Weight, in working order, 38½ tons, Steam pressure,\r\n120 lbs. per square inch. “Ovid” was built by Hawthorn in 1854.\r\n\r\n“Plato” (Fig. 72) was one of the six-coupled banking engines, designed\r\nby Gooch for the South Devon Railway. She was built at Swindon in 1854.\r\nThe steam pressure, cylinders, stroke, and weight were the same as in\r\nthe “Ovid” class. The wheels were 5ft. in diameter. The tanks contained\r\n740 gallons of water. The rectangular projection in front of the\r\nsmoke-box is the sand-box!\r\n\r\nNeilson and Co., of the Hyde Park Works, Glasgow, produced in 1855 a\r\ntype of outside cylinder goods engine. Readers will remember that at\r\nthat period goods locomotives were not necessarily of the six or eight\r\nwheels coupled description; they more generally had but the leading and\r\ndriving wheels coupled. This type of engine, it will be remembered, is\r\nnow usually described as “four-coupled in front” or a “mixed traffic”\r\nengine. The locomotive in question was built for the Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow Railway, and was numbered “353” in Neilson and Co.’s books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—“OVID,” A SOUTH DEVON RAILWAY SADDLE TANK\r\nENGINE, WITH LEADING BOGIE]\r\n\r\nThe boiler was of considerable length, and appeared longer from the\r\nfact that the fire-box top was not raised, so that a long, unbroken\r\nline of boiler top met the eye, relieved at the extremity of the\r\nfire-box end by being surmounted by an immense steam dome, on the top\r\nof which was fixed an enclosed Salter safety valve. The horizontal\r\noutside cylinders were below the foot-plate side frames, located as\r\nusual at the smoke-box end. Their diameter was 16in. and stroke 22in.\r\nThe coupled wheels were 5ft. and the trailing wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter.\r\n\r\nThe frames were “inside,” and the driving and leading wheels were\r\nprovided with inside bearings only, but by a curious practice of\r\nbolting on to the main frames—at about the middle of the fire-box—an\r\nelongated portion, which curved outwards, the trailing wheels were\r\nprovided with outside bearings. The rams actuating the boiler\r\nfeed pumps were simply extensions of the piston-rods, the pumps being\r\nfixed between the leading and driving wheels. The engine was provided\r\nwith a steam-pressure gauge, fixed on a vertical pillar over the top of\r\nthe fire-box—indeed, in much the same position the steam gauge still\r\noccupies, save that “No. 353” had no cab or weather-board, and it\r\ntherefore appeared singular to see the gauge in the place indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—“PLATO,” A SIX-COUPLED SADDLE TANK BANKING\r\nENGINE, SOUTH DEVON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nRotatory valves for locomotives are almost annual “inventions,” and as\r\nold friends as the “biggest gooseberry” and “sea serpent,” which appear\r\nregularly year by year. Under such circumstances, we may be excused for\r\ngiving an account of Locking and Cook’s patent rotatory valve, fixed\r\nto the York and North Midland Railway engine, “No. 48,” on January\r\n26th, 1854, and taken out in May of the same year, the locomotive in\r\nthe interim having run 10,000 miles. “No. 48” was used on the Hull and\r\nBridlington branch; and although she was an old engine, having been\r\nbuilt for the Hull and Selby Railway in 1840, yet with the rotatory\r\nvalve, good old “48” is stated to have consumed 20 per cent. less coke\r\nthan a modern engine doing the same work on the same branch; we also\r\nread that when the valve was removed no perceptible wearing was to be\r\nnoticed. We are not, however, aware that “No. 48” or any other of the\r\nYork and North Midland Railway locomotives were afterwards fitted with\r\nLocking and Cook’s patent rotatory valves.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Tosh, locomotive superintendent of the Maryport and Carlisle\r\nRailway, designed in 1854 a powerful goods engine to work the heavy\r\nmineral traffic over the railway. This engine had six-coupled wheels,\r\n4ft. 7in. diameter; cylinders, 16¾in. by 22in. stroke; heating\r\nsurface—tubes, 1,181ft.; fire-box, 84ft.; total, 1,265 sq. ft.; steam\r\npressure, 120lb.; weight, 26 tons 12 cwt.; cost, £2,175. She hauled\r\na train of 100 loaded wagons, weighing 445 tons, for a distance of\r\n28 miles in 1¾ hours. The line is of a very undulating character,\r\nincluding an ascent nine miles long, one mile of which is 1 in 192. The\r\nwagons were borrowed from the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and the\r\n100 only weighed 172 tons, or an average of less than 1¾ tons each.\r\n\r\nThe dead weight of mineral wagons has largely increased since 1854,\r\nalthough it is to be feared their carrying capacity has not increased\r\nin the same proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—THE FIRST TYPE OF NARROW-GAUGE PASSENGER\r\nENGINES ON THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the growth of narrow-gauge lines in the districts\r\nserved by the G.W.R., together with the amalgamations and alliances\r\nof narrow-gauge railways with the G.W.R., made it necessary for the\r\nlatter railway to provide narrow-gauge engines. Fig. 73 represents one\r\nof the first narrow-gauge Great Western locomotives. It will be seen\r\nthat Daniel Gooch introduced all his well-known features into these\r\nengines. These locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock, and Co. The\r\n“single” driving wheels were 6ft. 6in. diameter, the cylinders being\r\n15½in. diameter, and the stroke 22in. Compensation levers connected the\r\nleading and driving springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—“ROBIN HOOD,” A BROAD-GAUGE EXPRESS ENGINE,\r\nWITH COUPLED WHEELS 7FT. IN DIAMETER]\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Sir D. Gooch designed a class of coupled express broad-guage\r\nengines for the Great Western Railway. These engines had a group of\r\nfour leading wheels, like the “Lord of the Isles” class. The driving\r\nand trailing wheels were coupled, and were 7ft. in diameter. At that\r\ntime, no coupled wheels of so large a diameter had been constructed.\r\nThe cylinders were 17in. diameter, with a 24in. stroke. R. Stephenson\r\nand Co. built the engines, of which there were 10. They were a most\r\nsuccessful class of engine, and ran about 500,000 miles each before\r\nbeing “scrapped.” “Robin Hood” (Fig. 74) was one of these engines. By\r\nreference to the illustration, it will be seen that the tender was\r\nfitted with the sentinel box for the “travelling porter” that formerly\r\naccompanied the G.W. broad-gauge expresses.\r\n\r\nFig. 75 represents the inspection or cab engine of the N.B.R., it is\r\nnumbered 879, and was originally built by Messrs. Neilson and Co.,\r\nin 1850, for the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. She is now used for\r\ninspection purposes. The cylinders are 10in. diameter by 15in. stroke.\r\nOther dimensions are: Wheels, leading and trailing, 3ft. diameter;\r\ndriving, 5ft. diameter; wheel base, 15ft. 8in.; centre of leading to\r\ncentre of driving, 10ft. 8in.; centre of driving to centre of trailing,\r\n5ft. Tubes, No. 88, 1¾in. diameter outside. Heating surface: Tubes, 324\r\nsq. ft.; fire-box, 35 sq. ft.; total, 359 sq. ft. Fire-grate, 5 sq.\r\nft. Weight, in working order, 22 tons 1cwt. 3qrs. Tank capacity, 426\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY INSPECTION ENGINE, No.\r\n879]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Improvements in coal-burning locomotives—Beattie’s\r\n        system—Trials of the “Canute”—Yorston’s plan—Cudworth’s\r\n        successful efforts—Yarrow’s apparatus—D.

The year 1855\r\nfound the locomotive, or rather those responsible for its working, on\r\nthe threshold of successful experiments, which resulted in the complete\r\nsubstitution of the “black diamonds” in their natural state for\r\nlocomotive fuel in preference to the use of coal after it had undergone\r\nthe process of carbonification necessary to form coke.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that steam-users never had a preference for\r\ncoke, but they were compelled to use it, because the more volatile coal\r\nproduced so much smoke in the process of combustion that legislative\r\naction (which compels locomotive engines to be so constructed as “to\r\nconsume their own smoke”) practically prevented the use of coal until\r\nscience discovered a method of consuming the smoke.\r\n\r\nThere had been various attempts to reach this desirable state, and we\r\nhave from time to time in this series of articles described certain\r\nof these efforts; but none of them up to the date under review had\r\nbeen sufficiently successful to warrant the adoption of any one of the\r\nmethods proposed as a complete smoke-consumer.\r\n\r\nThe successful efforts made by Beattie, of the London and South Western\r\nRailway, to solve the problem of smoke consumption in the locomotive\r\nso as to admit of coal being used as fuel stand out prominently. The\r\nsalient points of his smoke-consuming locomotive comprised an enlarged\r\nfire-box, a combustion chamber, the transverse division of the fire-box\r\nby means of an inclined water bridge, and the fire-box arched with\r\nfire-bricks. A perforated fire-door for the admission of air to the\r\nfire-box was another of the features of Beattie’s system, as were\r\nalso the use of the ashpan dampers and the employment of an auxiliary\r\nsteam jet in the chimney for use when the engine was at rest and the\r\nordinary exhaust blast consequently not available. With the addition of\r\na feed-water heating apparatus Beattie reduced the fuel consumption to\r\n.12 from .17lb. per ton mile.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the London and South Western Railway locomotive\r\n“Canute” (an engine filled with Beattie’s coal-burning apparatus)\r\nwere:—Cylinders (outside), 15in. diameter, 21in. stroke; driving\r\nwheels, 6ft. 6in. diameter. The fire-box was 4ft. 11in. long, 3ft.\r\n6in. wide, 5ft. 1in. deep at the back, and 4ft. 1in. in front. The\r\ncombustion chamber had a flat roof, was 4ft. 2in. long, and 3ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter. The tubes were 6ft. long, 1¼in. diameter, and 373 in number.\r\nTotal area of fire-grate, 16 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe heating surface of the “Canute” was as follows:—Box, 107 sq. ft.;\r\ncombustion chamber, 37 sq. ft.; tubes, 625 sq. ft.; total, 769 sq.\r\nft. in addition to which red-hot bricks presented a surface of 80\r\nsq. ft., not, however, for heating the water, but for the purpose of\r\nburning the smoke. Four series of trials were made with the “Canute”\r\nengine No. 135, and these are detailed in “Locomotive Engineering.”\r\nThe experiments are described as “1st, the engine in its usual order,\r\nwith coal, bricks, and hot feed-water; 2nd, with coal, bricks, and cold\r\nwater; 3rd, with coke, bricks, and hot feed-water; 4th, with coal and\r\nhot feed-water, but without the bricks.” Three different kinds of coals\r\nwere used for the experiments. The following is a brief summary of the\r\nexperiments:—1st, a regular express train, of 10½ coaches, weighing 66\r\ntons, or with the engine and tender, 99 tons. Average speed, exclusive\r\nof stoppages, 34 miles an hour; consumption of coal, 15lb. per train\r\nmile; water evaporated, 9.35lb. per lb. of coal consumed; average\r\ntemperature of heated feed-water, 187 degrees. 2nd trial, a weighted\r\ntrain of 28 coaches, weighing with engine and tender 236 tons. Average\r\nspeed, exclusive of stoppages, 30¾ miles an hour; coal consumed,\r\n28¾lb. per mile, 8.87lb. of water evaporated by each pound of coal;\r\ntemperature of feed-water, 212 degrees. 3rd experiment, with an express\r\ntrain, but without the fire-bricks in the fire-box, showed that a\r\nsaving of 12 per cent. was due to the use of the fire-bricks, and with\r\ncoke instead of coal as fuel, the saving was 24 per cent. in favour\r\nof coal; whilst the use of the feed-water heating apparatus showed a\r\nsaving of 30 per cent. of fuel. Beattle’s apparatus is illustrated by\r\nFig. 76, the “Dane,” being a similar locomotive to “Canute.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—THE “DANE,” L. & S.W.R., FITTED WITH BEATTIE’S\r\nPATENT APPARATUS FOR BURNING COAL]\r\n\r\nAs the feed-water heating apparatus was an important innovation in\r\nlocomotive practice, it will be of interest if we append a description\r\nof the same. In outward appearance, the most noticeable portion of\r\nthe apparatus was the condenser, a cylindrical appendage placed in\r\na vertical position on the top of the smoke-box and in front of the\r\nchimney. From a casual glance, the condenser much resembled the\r\nsteam-pipe of a steamship which is usually to be observed outside the\r\nsmoke-stack. From the bottom of the condenser, outside the engine, a\r\npipe conveyed the heated water and steam back to the tender. The method\r\nof working was for the exhaust steam to be discharged from the blast\r\npipe into the condenser, which, as previously explained, was on the top\r\nof the smoke-box, and consequently right over the blast orifice. Here\r\nthe exhaust steam was mixed with a jet of cold water, which was pumped\r\ninto a condenser. The result of such meeting was the condensing of the\r\nsteam and heating of the water, which flowed by gravitation through the\r\npipe previously described. The supply pump for the boiler was worked\r\noff this pipe, and both the heated water and that from the tender\r\nwere together pumped into the boiler. If the boiler were not being\r\nfed, the heated water from the condenser, instead of passing into the\r\nboiler, flowed through the pipe into the tender, and thus raised the\r\ntemperature of the whole of the water in that vessel.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that before entering the boiler the temperature\r\nof the feed-water was further increased by passing through a special\r\nheating apparatus, fixed in the smoke-box. This smoke-box chamber was\r\nheated by the exhaust steam, which passed through it after leaving the\r\nblast pipe, and before entering the external condenser placed above it.\r\nBy these methods the temperature of the feed-water was raised above the\r\nboiling point before entering the boiler.\r\n\r\nThe engines of this design gave satisfaction, both as regards\r\nsmoke-consuming and feed-water heating, and to Beattie, therefore, is\r\ndue much of the honour of successfully overcoming the defects that\r\npreviously existed in so-called “smoke-consuming” locomotives. The\r\n“Canute” can, therefore, be considered amongst the earliest of the\r\nlocomotives burning coal in such a manner as to consume the smoke. It\r\nshould be mentioned that in later engines built under Beattie’s patent\r\nthe external condenser fixed on the top of the smoke-box in front of\r\nthe funnel was not used, a modified form of interior apparatus being\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that at this period Beattie was alone in the\r\nfield of experiment relating to “smoke-consuming” locomotives. Several\r\nother engineers were engaged in the same useful research, amongst whom\r\nwe mention Yorston, Cudworth, Yarrow, D. K. Clark, Wilson, Lee and\r\nJacques (jointly), Sinclair, and Douglas. Yorston’s plan was patented\r\nby Sharp, Stewart, and Co. in 1855. The fire-box was divided into two\r\nparts by a transverse mid-feather, which was perforated by a series of\r\ntubes, to allow the coal gases to escape and air to enter. The coal was\r\nfed into the portion of the fire-box next the tubes, the front part\r\nbeing reserved for coke; separate fire-doors were used for introducing\r\nthe coke and coal into the fire-box. The air entering through the\r\nperforations in the fire-box, at the tube-plate end, was expected to\r\nforce the smoke, etc., from the coal fire over the incandescent coke,\r\nwhere the combustion of the coal would be completed. The system,\r\nhowever, appears to have been better in theory than practice, as no\r\nparticular steps were taken to push the invention in question.\r\n\r\nWith Cudworth’s system the opposite course was adopted, and resulted in\r\nhis engines taking a foremost position among those burning coal as fuel.\r\n\r\nMr. Cudworth, the locomotive superintendent of the South Eastern\r\nRailway appears to have made his first experiments with engine No. 142,\r\nwhich during July, 1857, was tried as a coke-burning locomotive; but\r\nduring October and November of the same year experiments were made with\r\nthis engine, fitted with Cudworth’s patent grate, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—CUDWORTH’S SLOPING FIRE-GRATE, FOR BURNING\r\nCOAL, AS FITTED TO SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY LOCOMOTIVES]\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of Cudworth’s standard passenger engines were\r\nas follows:—Cylinders, 16in. by 24in. stroke; driving wheels, 6ft.\r\ndiameter; wheel base, 15ft.; heating surface, 965ft.; grate area, 21\r\nsq. ft. Total weight in working order 30½ tons, of which the leading\r\naxle supported 9 tons 9 cwt., driving 10¾ cwt., and trailing 10 tons\r\n6 cwt. The tender was carried on six wheels, and weighed in working\r\norder 20½ tons. These engines had inside cylinders and “back-coupled”\r\ndriving wheels, and for many years comprised the principal type of\r\nSouth Eastern passenger locomotives. Several of them are still running,\r\nbut rebuilt, their former distinguishing features—viz., the large brass\r\ndome on the centre of the boiler barrel, the raised fire-box, with a\r\nbrass encased Salter safety valve, the sloping fire-grate, and the\r\npeculiar chimney—all having been removed during the present locomotive\r\n_régime_.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature in Cudworth’s system was the long, sloping fire-box,\r\nwhich was 7ft. 6in. in length, the grate being 7ft. long, illustrated\r\nby Fig. 77. The fire-box was divided into two parts by a longitudinal\r\nmid-feather, thus forming two furnaces, with separate doors; the two\r\nfurnaces united at the lower end—in front of the tube-plate. The coal\r\nwas introduced alternately into each furnace, being placed just within\r\nthe doors; the sloping grate and the motion of the engine caused the\r\nfuel to gradually slide down the grate towards the tube-plate, and by\r\nthe time the fuel had reached the lower end of the grate, the smoke had\r\nbecome separated from the carbon of the coal, and was consumed by the\r\nincandescent mass of fire at the lower end of the grate, as it passed\r\nover the same on its way to the tubes.\r\n\r\nCudworth employed neither combustion chambers nor air-bricks in his\r\nsystem; but air was admitted to the fire-box by means of a damper fixed\r\nin the front of the lower end of the grate. A steam-jet was fixed in\r\nthe chimney to create a sufficient draught when the engine was still.\r\nCudworth’s “smoke-consuming” locomotives were as economical in coal as\r\nBeattie’s, whilst the former’s system was much more simple.\r\n\r\nOn March 18th, 1857, Thomas Yarrow, of Arbroath, was granted a patent\r\nfor his smoke-consuming apparatus for locomotives, which was used on\r\nthe Scottish North Eastern Railway. The leading characteristic of the\r\ndesign was a flat arch of fire-bricks constructed inside an ordinary\r\nfire-box. The lower end of the arch commenced below the bottom row of\r\ntubes, and the arch was continued upwards in a slanting direction till\r\nwithin 8 or 10 inches of the roof of the fire-box. Upon the top of this\r\narch were fixed a number of tubes, through which the vapours passed\r\nbefore reaching the ordinary boiler tubes. Hot air was supplied to\r\nthe fire by means of pipes with trumpet-shaped mouths placed in front\r\nof the ashpan. The fire-bars were fixed on a transverse rocking-shaft\r\nfitted with several short arms, upon which the ends of the fire-bars\r\nrested. To prevent the formation of clinkers, an occasional rock was\r\ngiven to the fire-bars by the fireman, a sector being provided for the\r\npurpose. Yarrow’s system required the coal to be placed at the extreme\r\nfront of the fire-box, so that the smoke was forced by the brick arch\r\nto return towards the fire-door before it could get over the arch and\r\nenter the tubes, and in the passage the denser portion of the smoke\r\nwas burnt. The patent also included the use of a steam-jet in the\r\nchimney for use when the engine was not working, and the heating of the\r\nfeed-water by means of the exhaust steam.\r\n\r\nLate in 1857 D. K. Clark devised his system of smoke-consuming\r\nfurnaces: the air was forced through tubes into the fire-box by the\r\naction of minute jets of steam, which acted much in the same way as the\r\nblast pipe in the smoke-box. The air-tubes were 1½in. diameter, with\r\nthe steam-jet orifice contracted to one-sixteenth inch diameter.\r\n\r\nThe first locomotive fitted with D. E. Clark’s system was one of the\r\nNorth London Railway’s tanks. This was in January, 1858, but only one\r\nside of the fire-box was fitted; four air-tubes were employed, and with\r\na small fire the prevention of smoke was complete. In April of the same\r\nyear one of the passenger engines on the Eastern Counties Railway was\r\nfitted with Clark’s apparatus. Four air-tubes were fitted to one side\r\nof the fire-box, and three to the other side. In the following January\r\na South Eastern Railway passenger locomotive was fitted with two rows\r\nof seven tubes each, through the front and back of the fire-box. In\r\nMarch, 1859, a Great North of Scotland Railway engine was fitted with\r\ntubes on Clark’s system, with such satisfactory results that the\r\nwhole locomotive stock of that railway was speedily fitted with the\r\napparatus. No complete investigation appears to have been made as to\r\nthe work performed by the jets of steam as employed by Clark. It is\r\ngenerally supposed that the steam had a merely mechanical effect—viz.,\r\nthat of drawing the air into the fire-box. It has also been suggested\r\nthat the steam produced a chemical combination which facilitated the\r\ncombustion of the volatile gases, besides precipitating the unconsumed\r\ncarbonaceous matter on the fire. The result of the adoption of the\r\nsystem on the Great North of Scotland Railway’s locomotives was such\r\nthat the coal consumption fell to under .2lb. of coal per ton mile.\r\nA trial was also made of Clark’s system on the London, Brighton, and\r\nSouth Coast Railway, one of the old passenger engines being fitted\r\nwith air-tubes and steam-jets to the front of the fire-box, with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Mr. Edward Wilson, who supplied the Oxford, Worcester, and\r\nWolverhampton Railway with locomotive power by contract, fitted his\r\nsystem to several of the engines on that line. Mr. David Joy, the\r\ninventor of the celebrated Joy valve gear, was at that time locomotive\r\nsuperintendent of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway,\r\nand he possesses records of many runs of the engines so fitted, and\r\nthe comparisons between the fitted and unfitted engines show an\r\nimmense saving of fuel by the former; indeed, the coal consumption\r\nwas remarkably low considering the severe nature of the line between\r\nOxford and Worcester. Some short time ago Mr. Joy showed the writer the\r\ntabulated results of these trials, and, if memory serves correctly, the\r\ncoal consumption averaged about 21lb. per train mile. Wilson’s system\r\nconsisted in fixing several tubes from the bottom of the fire-box\r\nunderneath the whole length of the boiler and smoke-box, so that the\r\nmouths of the air-tubes projected in front of the engine, and the\r\nresistance of the train when travelling forced the air through the\r\ntubes into the fire-box. By his method Wilson obtained a forced draught\r\nwithout the expenditure of the steam, which was necessary in Clark’s\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nLee and Jacques’ system was introduced on the East Lancashire Railway\r\nin July, 1858. It consisted of a narrow fire-brick arch, and a\r\ndeflector fixed at the top of the underhung fire-door. The deflector\r\nprojected in a downward sloping direction into the fire-box. A valve\r\nfor controlling the supply of air to the fire-box was fitted to the\r\nfire-door, and this valve was worked by means of a sector. The air\r\nentered the fire-box through the valve, and the deflector caused the\r\nair to be projected downwards on to the fuel, whilst the brick arch\r\nprevented the immediate escape of the gases, and kept them within the\r\nfire-box sufficiently long for the smoke to be consumed.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1858, Mr. Sinclair, the locomotive superintendent of the\r\nEastern Counties Railway, commenced to fit some locomotives with the\r\ndeflecting plate, etc., on a plan introduced by a Mr. Frodsham. The\r\nfire-door was underhung, and the baffle-plate was fixed above it, to\r\ndirect the air down on to the fuel; whilst instead of a brick arch, two\r\nsteam-jets were used, one on each side of the door. These also helped\r\nto force the air on to the burning fuel and to drive the liberated, but\r\nunconsumed, smoke back into the fire, when it was consumed.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas’s plan was adopted by the Birkenhead Railway. He combined\r\nthe use of an inclined fire-grate of large area, and a baffle-plate. In\r\nJanuary, 1858, when first introduced, the deflector was fixed to the\r\ninner side of the fire-door, but in June of the same year an underhung\r\nfire-door and movable baffle-plate were employed. These afterwards gave\r\nplace to a plain inverted scoop, to project the air right on to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—“NUNTHORPE,” A STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY\r\nPASSENGER ENGINE, BUILT IN 1856]\r\n\r\nAfter reading the description of the various plans adopted for the\r\nconsumption of the smoke, readers will at once observe that each and\r\nevery designer had the same object in view—viz., to supply a sufficient\r\nvolume of air to the fire, and mix the air with the unconsumed gases\r\ngiven off by the burning coal, and then to prevent the immediate escape\r\nof this gaseous mixture from the fire-box. Being retained within the\r\nheated fire-box, the temperature of the vapour was raised sufficiently,\r\nso that the vapour readily burnt when forced by the steam deflector,\r\nor brick arch (according to the system adopted), back on to the\r\nincandescent fuel. As stated, the object of all the inventors was the\r\nsame, but the methods adopted were different, and these latter (though\r\nsome systems had advantages that others lacked) were successful in each\r\ncase; but from the whole could be chosen some that certainly were more\r\nnoteworthy, both as regards simplicity of application and design, and\r\nothers that were more successful in attaining the object in view—viz.,\r\na consumption of the smoke given off by the coal. In these four\r\nyears—1855-59—however, the problem of consuming the coal smoke, was\r\nsuccessfully accomplished, and the era of the coal-burning locomotive\r\ndefinitely inaugurated.\r\n\r\nFig. 78 is an illustration of the “Nunthorpe,” No. 117 of the Stockton\r\nand Darlington Railway. This engine shows a distinct advance in\r\nlocomotive construction; indeed, it is possible at the present time to\r\nsee on some lines engines somewhat similar in appearance still at work.\r\nShe was built by Gilkes, Wilson and Co., in 1856, and was intended for\r\npassenger traffic. Four of the six wheels were coupled, these being\r\n5ft. in diameter. The cylinders were inside, 16in. in diameter, and\r\nwith 19in. stroke. The tender was on six wheels, and the tank capacity\r\nwas 1,200 gallons. The cost of the engine was £2,550. It will be\r\nobserved that the weather-board of the “Nunthorpe” afforded very little\r\nprotection to the driver and fireman, but its inclusion in the design\r\nof the engine was a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—BEATTIE’S 4-COUPLED TANK ENGINE, L. & S.W.R.,\r\n1857]\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Beattie designed a handy class of passenger tank engines for\r\nthe L. and S.W.R. Three were built at first, and named “Nelson,”\r\n“Howe,” and “Hood.” They had four coupled wheels, 5ft. diameter, and a\r\nsmall pair of leading wheels. The cylinders, which were outside, were\r\n15in. diameter, the stroke being 20in. These engines are illustrated by\r\nFig. 79. They were good locomotives, and “Hood” and “Howe” continued in\r\nwork till 1885.\r\n\r\nFairlie is usually given the credit of introducing double locomotives\r\nwith a centre foot-plate. By reference to Chapter IX., it will be seen\r\nthat the design was patented by Pearson, of the Bristol and Exeter\r\nRailway, as long ago as 1847, and in 1855 a double engine, built by\r\nR. Stephenson and Co., was at work on the Giovi incline of the Turin\r\nand Genoa Railway. The incline in question commences 7¾ miles after\r\nleaving Genoa, and is six miles long, the average gradient being 1 in\r\n36. The double locomotive was of the tank type. The wheels were 3ft.\r\n6in. diameter, the cylinders 14in. diameter, and the stroke 22in.\r\nThe machine actually appears to have been two engines placed fire-box\r\nto fire-box, and connected by means of a foot-plate between the two\r\nfire-boxes. The combination, with fuel and water, weighed 50 tons. In\r\nfine weather a load of 100 tons was hauled up the Giovi bank at 15\r\nmiles an hour; in bad weather the load was reduced to 70 tons.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the East Kent Railway from Chatham to Faversham\r\nwas opened in January, 1858, the original locomotives being designed by\r\nCrampton, who was one of the contractors for the construction of the\r\nline. The engines in question were “tanks,” and weighed 32 tons each—at\r\nthat period considered an excessive weight for an engine. They were\r\nalso unsteady and generally unsatisfactory, frequently running off the\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Sinclair was appointed locomotive superintendent of the\r\nEastern Counties Railway in 1858, and his first design of engines\r\nwas a class for working the goods traffic, of which only six were\r\nconstructed, Rothwell and Co. being the builders. The engines had a\r\npair of leading wheels, 3ft. 7in. diameter, and two pairs of coupled\r\nwheels, 5ft. diameter; the cylinders were 18in. diameter, the stroke\r\nbeing 22in.\r\n\r\nDuring the following years another class of goods engines (Fig. 80)\r\nwere built by various firms from Mr. Sinclair’s improved design.\r\nIndeed, as will be seen later on, some were even constructed by the\r\nFrench firm of Schneider and Co. These had outside cylinders, and\r\ninside frames to all wheels. The coupled wheels (D. and T.) were 6ft.\r\n3in. diameter, and the leading 3ft. 9in. diameter. The boiler was 10ft.\r\n9in. long by 4ft. 2in. diameter, and contained 203 tubes, of 1¾in.\r\ndiameter; heating space, 1,122 sq. ft.; weight, 35½ tons. Twenty-one of\r\nthese engines, built by Neilson and Co., had Beattie’s patent fire-box,\r\nwhich was surmounted by a large dome. These were numbered 307 to 327.\r\nWhen Mr. W. Adams was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Great\r\nEastern Railway, he rebuilt several of these engines with a leading\r\nbogie in place of the pair of wheels.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1858, a design of locomotive engine was patented, four\r\npairs of coupled wheels being employed, all of which were located\r\nunder the boiler barrel. The two leading pairs of wheels had outside\r\naxle-boxes, and the two trailing pairs inside axle-boxes, the latter\r\nhaving a lateral motion. The cylinders were inside, under the\r\nsmoke-box, but the method proposed for working the locomotive was of\r\na curious type, being somewhat after the fashion employed in ancient\r\nsteamboats, the pistons working out towards the front buffer beams,\r\nbut connected to the leading wheels by outside cranks working off the\r\ncross-heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 80.—SINCLAIR’S OUTSIDE CYLINDER, 4-COUPLED GOODS\r\nENGINE, EASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY. (REBUILT)]\r\n\r\nA design for four-wheel tank engines was patented by S. D. Davison, in\r\nFebruary, 1859, the leading feature being plate-iron frames formed into\r\ntanks for holding a supply of water.\r\n\r\nAttention must now be given to an invention that has proved of enormous\r\nvalue to the locomotive engineer, but which from its simplicity of\r\naction, yet apparent impossibility, was not at first deemed worthy\r\nof practical use. On July 23rd, 1858, a patent was granted to H. J.\r\nGiffard, a Frenchman, for his injector, or boiler feeder, which in\r\na short period almost completely superseded feed pumps, with their\r\nattendant friction, uncertainty of action, and excessive outlay for\r\nmaintenance and repair. But above these minor disadvantages of the feed\r\npumps, the injector removed from the minds of locomotive engineers that\r\ngreat source of danger, a short supply of water in the boilers, as\r\nwell as the additional expense and inconvenience of “exercising” the\r\nlocomotives solely for the purpose of filling the boiler, or, where\r\nsuch a method was inconvenient, of working the engine over a “race” for\r\nthe same purpose. The theory of the injector did not originate with\r\nGiffard, for as long ago as 1806 Nicholson mentioned it as applicable\r\nfor forcing water, whilst other philosophers have suggested its\r\nutility; indeed, the principle was used in connection with vacuum sugar\r\nboiling pans 20 years before Giffard’s patent. The story of Giffard’s\r\naccidental discovery of the action of steam and water in supplying a\r\nsteam boiler with additional water reads almost like an extravagant\r\nromance, but many other great inventions and scientific discoveries\r\nhad beginnings that appeared quite as improbable. The action of the\r\ninjector, although curious, is well known, and therefore needs no\r\ndescription here. It is stated that Ramsbottom’s “Problem,” built at\r\nCrewe in November, 1859, was the first locomotive fitted with Giffard’s\r\n“injector.” This engine was the prototype of the world-famous “Lady\r\nof the Lake” class. Her dimensions were, outside cylinders, 16in. by\r\n24in.; single driving wheels, 7ft. 7½in. diameter; weight in working\r\norder, 27 tons. These engines have inside frames and bearings to all\r\nthe six wheels.\r\n\r\nAn invention of Mr. Ramsbottom in connection with the improvement of\r\nthe working of the locomotive deserves attention at this point. We\r\nrefer to his self-filling tender apparatus, as introduced in 1860 on\r\nthe London and North Western Railway system, and afterwards partially\r\non the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, but which until the last\r\nyear or so has not been used on other lines. The speed competition of\r\nrecent years, and the expiration of the patent, has now caused the\r\nGreat Western, Great Eastern, and North Eastern to adopt the water\r\npick-up apparatus. One advantage of the system is, of course, the\r\nconsiderable reduction in the dead weight—a not unimportant factor\r\nin express train running. The superiority of Ramsbottom’s system is\r\neasily seen by comparing the small light tenders in use on the London\r\nand North Western Railway with the gigantic ones adopted by the Great\r\nNorthern, Midland, and other lines running long distances without\r\nstopping, but which systems are unsupplied with the water trough and\r\nthe necessary pick-up apparatus. The first pair of water troughs appear\r\nto have been put down near Conway, on the North Wales section of the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway. They were of cast-iron, 441 yards\r\nlong, 18in. wide, and 7in. deep, the water being 5in. deep. At each\r\nend of the main trough was an additional length of 16 yards, rising\r\n1 in 100. It was towards the end of 1860 that the first trial of the\r\ntrough system was made. Here, again, as in the case of the “injector,”\r\nthe arrangement requisite to produce the effect is so simple that at\r\nfirst blush the effect appears to be the result of some marvellous\r\nsecret power rather than the operation of a simple natural law, the\r\neffect of the travelling scoop upon the water being exactly the same\r\nas if the water were forced against a stationary scoop at a velocity\r\nequal to that at which the train is travelling. The lowest speed at\r\nwhich the apparatus works properly is something about 22 miles an hour.\r\nThis speed, however, brings it within the scope of fast goods trains,\r\nwhilst express trains can scoop up the water when travelling at 50\r\nmiles an hour, and can pick up about 1,500 gallons in the length of\r\nthe trough—quarter of a mile. The speed of the train would not appear\r\nto have much effect upon the water picked up in passing over a trough,\r\nas although with a slower train less water would be raised per second,\r\nyet the extra length of time spent in travelling over the trough would\r\ncompensate for the smaller amount of water raised per second. The\r\nwater supply-pipe is fixed inside the tender; it is slightly curved\r\nthroughout its entire length, and is expanded towards its upper end to\r\nabout ten times the area of the bottom, in order to reduce the speed\r\nor force of the incoming stream, which is directed downwards by the\r\nbent end or delivering mouth at the top of the pipe. To the lower end\r\nof this pipe is fitted a movable dip-pipe, which is curved forward in\r\nthe direction of the motion of the tender, so as to act as a species\r\nof scoop. This dip-pipe is rendered movable and adjustable in various\r\nways, with a view to its being drawn up clear of any impediments, such\r\nas ballast heaps lying on the way, and also to regulate the depth of\r\nimmersion in the water of the feed-water trough, the dip-pipe being\r\ncapable of sliding up inside the feed-pipe by a convenient arrangement\r\nof rods and levers.\r\n\r\nIn order that the dip-pipe may enter and leave the feed-trough freely\r\nat each end, the rail surface at that part of the line is lowered a few\r\ninches, a descending gradient at one end of the trough serving to allow\r\nthe dip-pipe to descend gradually into the trough, whilst a rising\r\ngradient at the opposite end enables it to rise out of the trough\r\nagain, the intervening length of line between the two gradients being\r\nlevel. To meet emergencies, Mr. Ramsbottom provided a small ice-plough,\r\nto be used occasionally during severe frost for the purpose of breaking\r\nup and removing any ice which might form in the trough. This plough\r\nconsisted of a small carriage mounted on four wheels, and provided with\r\nan angular-inclined perforated top, which worked its way under the ice\r\non being pushed along the bottom of the trough, and effectually broke\r\nit up and discharged it over each side.\r\n\r\nA very powerful class of broad-gauge saddle tank locomotives was\r\ndesigned by Brunel for working the heavy coal traffic over the severe\r\ngradients of the Vale of Neath Railway. These engines were supported\r\nby six-coupled wheels of 4ft. 9in. diameter, the cylinders being 18in.\r\ndiameter, and the stroke 24in. The heating surface was 1,417.6 sq.\r\nft.; the water capacity of tanks was 1,500 gallons. The engines, which\r\nwere fitted with Dubs’ wedge motion, were built by the Vulcan Foundry\r\nCompany, and weighed 50 tons in working order. A noteworthy performance\r\nof one of these locomotives consisted in hauling a train of 25 loaded\r\nbroad-gauge trucks, each weighing 15 tons, the gross weight, including\r\nthe engine, amounting to 425 tons. This train travelled up a bank of 1\r\nin 90 for a distance of 4½ miles. Such a load on the gradient mentioned\r\nis equal to one of 1,275 tons on the level, and in a general way we\r\ndo not find engines hauling trains of the latter weight upon our most\r\nlevel lines. The Vale of Neath performance must, therefore, be regarded\r\nas an exceptional locomotive feat. These engines were numbered 13,\r\n14, and 15, and not being provided with compensating beams between\r\nthe wheels, it is stated that one axle frequently carried 20 tons of\r\nthe total weight. During 1860 these three locomotives were, under the\r\nadvice of Mr. Harrison, rebuilt as tender engines, to reduce the weight\r\non the wheels, the excessive amount of which had been very destructive\r\nto the permanent-way. The cost of the alterations to the engines and\r\nthe addition of the tenders was £700 each engine. About the same\r\ntime some of the other Vale of Neath six-wheels-coupled engines were\r\nconverted into four-wheels-coupled bogie locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive now to be described had but a very shadowy existence; it\r\nwas rather a tentative essay to produce a steam locomotive without the\r\naid of a fire. The idea when proposed by Sir John Fowler was not new,\r\nfor more or less successful essays had already been made on a small\r\nscale, with engines, the steam for propelling which was generated in\r\nthe same manner as in Fowler’s locomotive.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 a railway was incorporated as the North Metropolitan; the\r\nnext year a new Act was obtained, and the title changed to the\r\nMetropolitan. This authorised the construction of a railway from\r\nthe Great Western Railway at Paddington to the General Post Office;\r\npowers were afterwards obtained to allow the City terminus to be in\r\nFarringdon Street instead of at the Post Office. The Great Western\r\nRailway subscribed £175,000 of the capital, and for the convenience\r\nof that Company’s through traffic the Metropolitan was laid out\r\non the mixed-gauge, and when it was first opened it was worked on\r\nthe broad-gauge only, by the Great Western Railway—a most sensible\r\narrangement, and one which ought never to have been relinquished,\r\nseeing how well adapted the wider vehicles were for conveying the\r\nimmense crowds that travel by every train on this line.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Incorporation specially provided that the line was to be\r\nworked without annoyance from steam or fire. At first it was proposed\r\nto convert the water into steam by means of red-hot bricks placed\r\naround the boiler, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Fowler designed such\r\na locomotive, which was built by a Newcastle firm, and tried on the\r\nMetropolitan Railway between Bishop’s Road and Edgware Road Stations\r\nbefore the line was opened. The first trial took place on Thursday,\r\nNovember 28th, 1861. The following is an account of the trip:—“The\r\nengine was of considerable size, and it was stated that it could run on\r\nthe railway from the Great Western at Paddington to Finsbury Pavement\r\nwithout allowing the escape of steam from the engine or smoke from\r\nthe fire. A few open trucks were provided with seats, and when the\r\ngentlemen were seated, the new engine propelled them under the covered\r\nway of the Metropolitan Railway to the first station at the eastern\r\nside of the Edgware Road, and back again to the Great Western Station,\r\nthe steam and smoke being shut off. The tunnel, or covered way, was\r\nperfectly fresh and free from vapour or smoke. On the signal being\r\ngiven to work the engine in the ordinary way, a cloud of smoke, dust,\r\nand steam soon covered the train, and continued until it emerged from\r\nthe tunnel into the open air. The experiment was perfectly successful,\r\nbut it was understood that engines so constructed would be rather more\r\nexpensive to work than those running in the ordinary way.” To work the\r\nMetropolitan Railway on this system would have required the erection\r\nof immense boilers at both ends of the line to heat the water for the\r\nlocomotive, and also furnaces for making the bricks red-hot, whilst the\r\ncharging of the locomotive boilers with hot water and the fire-boxes\r\nwith hot bricks would have occupied some considerable time at the end\r\nof each trip.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, well known that the experiment was very far from\r\nbeing “perfectly successful.” Indeed, “failure” would be a much\r\nbetter definition of the hot-brick engine, since the proposed method\r\nof working was not carried out. We understand the engine was sold\r\nto Mr. Isaac Watt Boulton, the well-known purchaser of second-hand\r\nlocomotives, and for some time remained in his “railway museum” before\r\nbeing finally scrapped. The Metropolitan Railway had, consequently,\r\nupon the failure of the hot-brick engine, to fall back upon the Great\r\nWestern Railway for working the underground line, until Sir John\r\nFowler’s later design of engines, constructed by Beyer, Peacock, and\r\nCo., were ready to work the traffic.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Fletcher, Jennings, and Co., of Whitehaven, designed a handy\r\ntype of saddle tank engine for shunting purposes, etc. The engine ran\r\non four wheels, 3ft. 4in. diameter, the wheel base being 6ft. The\r\ncylinders were 10in. diameter, with 20in. stroke. Allan’s straight\r\nlink motion was employed, and was worked off the leading axle (it\r\nwill be understood that the four wheels were coupled). This method\r\nof actuating the valves was not conducive to good working, as, of\r\ncourse, if the coupling-rods worked slack the valve gear motion became\r\ndisorganised.\r\n\r\nFig. 81 is a photograph of engine No. 75, of the Taff Vale Railway,\r\nbuilt at the Company’s Cardiff Works in 1860. The six-coupled wheels\r\nwere 4ft. 8in. diameter, the cylinders were 16in. diameter, and the\r\nstroke was 24in. No. 75 weighed 32 tons in working order; the steam\r\npressure was 130 lbs. per sq. in. She was employed in the heavy mineral\r\ntraffic of the Taff Vale Railway, and from her design well calculated\r\nto work over the heavy gradient of that system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—SIX-COUPLED MINERAL ENGINE, TAFF VALE RWY.,\r\nBUILT 1860]\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the L. and S.W. Railway purchased some second-hand engines from\r\na contractor. They were built by Manning, Wardle, and Co., Leeds, and\r\ncomprised six-wheels-coupled saddle tank engines. The wheels were 3ft.\r\ndiameter; cylinders, 12in. by 18in. stroke; wheel base, 10ft. 3in.;\r\nlength over buffers, 21ft. 6in.; weight, empty, 14 tons 8 cwt., loaded,\r\n16 tons 4 cwt. The fire-box was surmounted by a safety valve enclosed\r\nwithin a high fluted pillar. The steam pressure was 120lb. One of these\r\nengines is leased to the Lee-on-the-Solent (Light) Railway, and may be\r\nseen working the traffic on this little line, which, by the way, spends\r\nover twopence to earn each penny of its gross income.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the London and South Western Railway and its goods\r\nlocomotives, it is as well to record the dimensions of the “Meteor,”\r\nNo. 57, constructed at Nine Elms in 1863 from the designs of Mr.\r\nBeattie. The cylinders were 16½in. diameter, 22in. stroke; the leading\r\nwheels were 3ft. 3in., and the coupled (D. and T.) wheels 5ft.\r\ndiameter; the wheel base was 14ft., of which 8ft. 2½in. was between\r\nthe coupled wheels. The leading wheels were under the boiler, and the\r\nfront buffer beam was about 6ft. in advance of the centre of this\r\naxle. An immense dome was fixed on the raised fire-box; the safety\r\nvalve was within an inverted urn-shaped case on the boiler barrel. The\r\nweather-board had slight side-wings, and was curved upwards at the top,\r\nand so formed an incipient cab. The fire-box sloped from the tube-plate\r\ntowards the foot-plate. The total weight, in working order, was 32\r\ntons 18 cwt., of which 11 tons 9 cwt. was on the leading, 11½ tons on\r\nthe driving, and 9 tons 18 cwt. on the trailing axle. The tender was\r\nsupported on six wheels, 3ft. 9¾in. diameter, and had a tank capacity\r\nof 1,950 gallons.\r\n\r\nBy a marvellous addition of a big head and a bigger tail (to say\r\nnothing of various legs), the diminutive body of the East Kent Railway\r\nhad, in August, 1859, blossomed into the London, Chatham and Dover\r\nRailway; and for this railway 24 locomotives were supplied by various\r\nfirms from Crampton’s designs. They were numbered 3 to 26. The design\r\nwas peculiar—a leading bogie having wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter, and\r\na base of 4ft., and four-coupled wheels 5ft. 6in. diameter. The\r\ncylinders were outside, and had a stroke of 22in., the diameter being\r\n16in. As in the “London” and other Crampton engines, the cylinders\r\nwere placed about midway between the smoke and fire-boxes, whilst the\r\nconnecting-rods actuated the rear pair of coupled wheels, so that in\r\ndescribing the position of the wheels of these engines we should have\r\nto enumerate them as “leading bogie,” “centre,” and “ driving.” A\r\ncompensation lever connected the centre and driving wheels. Gooch’s\r\nvalve gear was used. Like other engines of Crampton’s design, this\r\nclass was a failure, and within three or four years they were rebuilt\r\nas six-wheel engines, with inside cylinders and outside frames; some of\r\nthem, as reconstructed without a bogie, are still in active service on\r\nthe London, Chatham and Dover Railway.\r\n\r\nBefore the grave faults inherent in the previously described class of\r\nengines had been, fully appreciated, the London, Chatham, and Dover\r\nRailway had arranged for a second batch of engines from another of\r\nCrampton’s designs. These consisted of five engines constructed by R.\r\nStephenson and Co. in 1862. The locomotives in question were worked on\r\nthe principle patented by W. Bridges Adams, and previously described\r\nin an earlier chapter—viz., an intermediate driving shaft, coupled by\r\noutside rods to the driving wheels, situated behind the fire-box. The\r\ncylinders were 16in. diameter by 22in. stroke, and within the frames.\r\nThe driving wheels were 6ft. 6½in. diameter, and bogie wheels 4ft.\r\n0½in. diameter. Cudworth’s sloping fire-box, fitted with a longitudinal\r\nmid-feather, was employed. The heating surface amounted to 1,200 sq.\r\nft., made up of 130 sq. ft. fire-box and 1,070 sq. ft. tubes, which\r\nwere 2in. diameter, 10ft. 10in. long, and 189 in number. The grate area\r\nwas 26 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe engines in question were named, etc., as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Company’s No.    Name.        Builder’s No.\r\n\r\n        27          “Echo”            1381\r\n        28          “Coquette”        1382\r\n        29          “Flirt”           1383\r\n        30          “Flora”           1384\r\n        31          “Sylph”           1385\r\n\r\nAs remarked in describing the previous class, Crampton’s engines were\r\nin this case also found to be unsuitable, so that the London, Chatham\r\nand Dover Railway rebuilt the five engines, when the intermediate\r\ndriving shaft was provided with a pair of wheels, and the engines\r\nbecame “four-coupled bogies.” The diameter of the cylinders was\r\nincreased to 17in.; the Cudworth fire-box was dispensed with, and the\r\nheating surface reduced, the present dimensions being—fire-box, 100 sq.\r\nft.; tubes, 987 sq. ft.; grate area, 16¼ sq. ft.; weight in working\r\norder: on bogie, 14 tons 12 cwt.; driving wheels, 14 tons 12 cwt.; and\r\non trailing wheels, 10 tons; total, 38 tons 16 cwt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Brougham,” Stockton and Darlington Railway—L. & N.W.R. engines\r\n        at the 1862 Exhibition—Sinclair’s “Single” engines for the\r\n        G.E.R.—French locomotives on the G.E.R.—L. & S.W.R. tank\r\n        engines, afterward converted to tender engines—Conner’s\r\n        8ft. 2in. “Single” engine on the Caledonian Railway—The\r\n        lilliputian “Tiny,” the Crewe Works locomotive—“Dignity\r\n        and Impudence”—Bridges Adams’ radial axle tank engines—His\r\n        springtyres— Account of the St. Helens Railway locomotive\r\n        with these innovations—Broad-gauge engines for the\r\n        Metropolitan Railway—Rupture between the Great Western and\r\n        Metropolitan —Sturrock to the rescue—G.N. tender engines\r\n        on the Metropolitan—Delivery of the Underground Company’s\r\n        own engines—Great Northern “condensing” locomotives—The\r\n        Bissell bogie truck well advertised—End of the\r\n        “hot-brick” engine—Sturrock’s steam-tender engines on the\r\n        G.N.R.—Sinclair’s tank engine with Bissell trucks—Fell’s\r\n        system of locomotive traction—Tried on the Cromford and\r\n        High Peak line—Adopted on the Mount Cenis Railway—Spooner’s\r\n        locomotives for the Festiniog Railway—Fairlie’s\r\n        double-bogie engines—The “Welsh Pony” and “Little\r\n        Wonder”—Fairlie’s combined trains and engines—Cudworth’s\r\n        trailing bogie North London engines, a model for tank\r\n        locomotive constructors—Pryce’s designs for the North\r\n        London Railway.\r\n\r\nFig. 82 illustrates the “Brougham,” No. 160, of the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway. This engine was designed for hauling passenger\r\ntrains. She was a bogie engine, as will be noticed by reference to\r\nthe illustration, and had four-coupled wheels 6ft. in diameter. The\r\ncylinders, placed outside, were 16in. in diameter, with a stroke\r\nof 24in. The tender was on six wheels, and the tank was capable of\r\ncarrying 1,400 gallons. No. 160 was constructed in 1860, not a very\r\nlong time prior to the amalgamation with the North Eastern Railway\r\nCompany, by R. Stephenson and Co., of Newcastle, at a cost of £2,500.\r\n\r\nThe London and North Western Railway exhibited at the London\r\nInternational Exhibition of 1862 a locomotive constructed at Wolverton\r\nfrom the designs of Mr. McConnell; the engine was built the previous\r\nyear, was numbered 373, and named “Caithness.” The cylinders were 18in.\r\nby 24in.; driving wheels, 7ft. 7⅛in. diameter; L. and T., 4ft. 7½in.;\r\nsteam pressure, 150lb.; wheel base, 18ft.; heating surface (14 tubes\r\n1⅞in. diameter, 9ft. 4in. long), 980.319 sq. ft.; fire-box, 242.339\r\nsq. ft.; weight in working order (engine and tender) 59 tons 14 cwt.\r\nA combustion chamber 2ft. 8in. long was provided. Two other engines\r\nof this design were built, No. 372 “Delamere” and No. 272 “Maberley.”\r\nApparently these engines were not very successful, as we do not find\r\naccounts of their later performances.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Fairbairn and Co. constructed for the Great Eastern Railway\r\na class of “single” engines designed by Mr. R. Sinclair. These\r\nlocomotives had outside cylinders, 16 ft. by 24 in.; driving wheels,\r\n7 ft. 3 in., and leading and trailing wheels, 3 ft. 9 in. diameter;\r\nheating surface, tubes (203, 1¾ in. diameter), 957.6 sq. ft.; fire-box,\r\n94.9 sq. ft.; grate area, 15.27 sq. ft.; weight, 32 tons, of which 13\r\ntons 13 cwt. 1 qr. was on the driving axle. Gooch’s link motion was\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—“BROUGHAM,” No. 160, STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe design in question was of rather attractive appearance, the open\r\nsplasher being an attractive feature, as was also the cab—somewhat of\r\nan innovation 35 years ago. Mr. S. W. Johnson succeeded Mr. Sinclair\r\nat the end of 1865 as Great Eastern Railway locomotive superintendent,\r\nand under the _régime_ of the former some of these engines were rebuilt\r\nwith a leading bogie, and the diameter of the cylinders was increased\r\nto 18 in. Another form of cab was introduced, the Salter safety valve\r\non the dome was removed, and one of Ramsbottom design placed on\r\nthe flush top fire-box, which had superseded the raised pattern as\r\nemployed in this class of engine by Mr. Sinclair. One of the engines\r\nof this class (No. 0295) was in active service as recently as July,\r\n1894. In connection with this class of engine a special circumstance\r\nneeds mention—viz., that 16 of these locomotives were made—not “in\r\nGermany,” but in the country of her foe; the French engineering firm\r\nwith the German name of Schneider, in 1865, contracting to supply the\r\n16 locomotives at a less price than any English maker. This event was\r\ncertainly a curiosity in the economic history of this country’s trade.\r\nWe import many articles; let us hope, however, that foreign locomotives\r\nwill not again be seen on English railways. There is some consolation\r\nto be found in the statement that all the British locomotive builders\r\nwere so full of orders at the time that they practically refused to\r\naccept orders for the engines in question by tendering for them at\r\noutside prices, so that consequently the order had to be given to a\r\nforeign firm.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Beyer, Peacock and Co. commenced to construct a class of tank\r\nengines for the London and South Western Railway from the designs of\r\nMr. J. Beattie. The locomotives in question had outside cylinders\r\n16½in. by 20in. stroke; four coupled wheels, 5ft. 7in. diameter; and a\r\npair of leading wheels, 3ft. 7¾in. diameter. The boiler contained 186\r\ntubes, 1⅝in. diameter. The heating surface was made up of tubes 715.17\r\nsq. ft., and fire-box 80 sq. ft. The grate area was 14.2 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nA lock-up safety valve was placed on the front ring of the boiler\r\nbarrel, and two of Salter’s pattern on the immense dome which\r\nsurmounted the raised fire-box. The steam pressure was 130lb. The\r\nengine weighed in working order 29 tons 17 cwt., of which 10½ tons\r\nwas on the driving axle. We have already stated that the engines were\r\nbuilt as tanks, but Mr. W. Adams, who had succeeded Mr. J. Beattie as\r\nlocomotive superintendent of the London and South Western Railway,\r\nadded tenders to some of their engines in 1883. It is a common practice\r\nto rebuild tender engines as “tanks,” but the opposite practice is\r\nsomewhat of a novelty. The tenders were supported on six wheels, 3ft.\r\n9¾in. diameter, and weighed 20¾ tons in working order, the water\r\ncapacity being 1,950 gallons.\r\n\r\nAn engine that attracted considerable attention at the 1862 Exhibition\r\nwas one built by Neilson and Co. from the designs of Mr. B. Conner,\r\nlocomotive superintendent of the Caledonian Railway (Fig. 83). The\r\nengine in question had outside cylinders, 17¼in. diameter, with a\r\nstroke of 24in.; driving 8ft. 2in. in diameter, with inside bearings\r\nand underhung springs. The trailing and leading wheels had outside\r\nbearings. The engine had 1,172 sq. ft. of heating surface; the grate\r\narea was 13.9 sq. ft.; wheel base, 15ft. 8in.; weight, empty, 27¼ tons;\r\nin working order, 30 tons 13 cwt., of which 14 tons 11 cwt. was on the\r\ndriving axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—CONNER’S 8FT. 2IN. “SINGLE” ENGINE, CALEDONIAN\r\nRAILWAY (REBUILT)]\r\n\r\nColburn describes the locomotive as a “fine, well-constructed engine,\r\nstanding gracefully on its wheels, large, yet compact, and qualified to\r\nrun at any speed with ease and steadiness.” Nor can this description\r\nbe in any measure contradicted. For, until Stirling built his famous\r\n8ft. 1in. “singles” for the Great Northern Railway, Conner’s 8ft. 2in.\r\nCaledonian engines were far and away the most graceful locomotives ever\r\nplaced on the 4ft. 8½in. gauge. In general design, the engine was a\r\nmodification of the old Crewe pattern engine. The dome was, however,\r\nof rather a peculiar shape: it was placed on the top of the raised\r\nfire-box. The driving axle was of cast steel, and the tyres of Krupp\r\nsteel. The large number of spokes in the driving wheels was noticeable,\r\nbeing at only 10in. centres at the rim of the wheels. The slide-valves\r\nwere provided with 1½in. lap. A great improvement was the provision of\r\na cab, and that of not disproportionate dimensions, considering the\r\n“year of grace” in which the engine was constructed. Trains of nine\r\ncarriages were hauled at an average speed of 40 miles an hour, with a\r\ncoal consumption of 2½lb. per mile; 14 loaded carriages were frequently\r\ntaken up the terrible Beattock bank, 10 miles in length, at 30 miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe late Khedive of Egypt was so taken with the appearance of this\r\nengine when it was at the Exhibition that he immediately ordered one\r\nfor his own railway. He was searching for a locomotive to convey him\r\nat 70 miles an hour, and Conner’s 8ft. 2in. single appeared to be the\r\none most likely to fulfil his requirements. Nor do we hear that he was\r\nin any way disappointed with his purchase.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the Caledonian Railway has still a\r\nspecimen of this notable design unscrapped—may it ever remain so. To\r\nprevent our appetite becoming vitiated with a galaxy of Brobdingnagian\r\nlocomotives, we will descend to the other end of the scale, and detail\r\nthe Lilliputian “Tiny,” as used in the Crewe locomotive works. The\r\nrailway is of 18in. gauge, and was opened in May, 1862, for a length\r\nof three-eighths of a mile. In its course the engine traverses curves\r\nof 15ft. radius each, no difficulty being found in going round these\r\ncurves with loads of 12 to 15 tons, or in taking 7ft. 6in. wheel\r\nforgings or tyres on edge by means of trucks specially adapted for the\r\npurpose. This engine has four-wheels-coupled; inside cylinders, 4¼in.\r\ndiameter, and 6in. stroke; the wheels are 15in. in diameter, on a base\r\nof 3ft. The total heating surface is about 42 sq. ft. A No. 2 Giffard’s\r\ninjector supplied the boiler with water; this precious liquid is stored\r\nin a saddle tank, with a capacity of 28 gallons. “Tiny,” when “right\r\nand tight and ready for action,” weighs only 2½ tons.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Lilliputian engines consist in hauling materials to\r\nand from different parts of the works, and as the 18in. rails are in\r\nmost places laid parallel with the standard gauge lines, “Tiny” is also\r\ncalled upon to fly shunt the trucks, etc., when necessary.\r\n\r\nAn engine of this type, the “Nipper,” forms with the giant “Cornwall”\r\nthat well-known photographic picture—the railway “Dignity and\r\nImpudence.”\r\n\r\nFig. 84 represents Sharp, Stewart, and Co.’s standard design of\r\npassenger engine of this period. The “Albion” was delivered to the\r\nCambrian Railway in May, 1863. She was an inside cylinder engine,\r\nwith a pair of leading wheels, and an enclosed Salter safety valve.\r\nAltogether, the “Albion” is a fair example of locomotive practice 36\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nWe have on previous occasions referred to the improvements in\r\nlocomotive construction introduced by Mr. W. Bridges Adams, and we now\r\nhave again to record a successful employment of his design. In the\r\nfirst week of November, 1863, Mr. James Cross, locomotive engineer of\r\nthe St. Helens Railway, completed a tank locomotive, supported on eight\r\nwheels, the leading and trailing pairs of which were fitted with the\r\nradial axle-boxes patented by Mr. W. B. Adams; whilst the four coupled\r\nwheels were fitted with spring tyres, which were another invention of\r\nthe same engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—“ALBION,” CAMBRIAN RAILWAYS, 1863]\r\n\r\nThe St. Helens Railway was famous—or, from an engineer’s point of\r\nview, we should say, perhaps, infamous—for the severe gradients, sharp\r\ncurves, and numerous points, crossings, and junctions. The inclines\r\nwere as steep as 1 in 35, 1 in 70, and 1 in 85, whilst the curves were\r\nconstructed with radii of 300ft. and 500ft., and reverse or S curves\r\nwere also more frequent than pleasant. The St. Helens Railway was\r\nonly 30 miles long, but within two miles of the St. Helens Station no\r\nless than 12 miles of sidings were located. We do not mean to suggest\r\nthat the whole line of railway was so thickly covered with siding\r\nconnections, but such were distributed over the remaining mileage of\r\nthe railway in too plentiful profusion. Here, then, was a length of\r\nrailway containing the three great hindrances to smooth and quick\r\nrunning, but the locomotive about to be described was so constructed as\r\nto successfully overcome these impediments.\r\n\r\nThis engine had inside cylinders, 15in. diameter and 20in. stroke.\r\nThe coupled wheels were 5ft. 1in. in diameter, the rigid wheel base\r\nbeing 8ft., but as these wheels had spring tyres, each pair of wheels\r\nwas practically as free to traverse the curves as uncoupled wheels.\r\nOther dimensions were:—Heating surface, 687 sq. ft.; grate area, 16.25\r\nsq. ft.; total wheel base, 22ft.; weight in working order, on leading\r\nwheels, 7 tons 15 cwt.; on driving, 11¾ tons; on rear coupled, 11¼\r\ntons; on trailing, 10 tons, including 4¼ tons water and 1¼ tons coal.\r\nTotal weight, 40¾ tons.\r\n\r\nThe boiler contained 121 tubes, 10ft. 11in. long, and 1⅞in. diameter;\r\nsteam pressure, 140lb.; water capacity of tank, 950 gallons. The\r\nfire-grate was 5ft. long, and sloped from the door to the tube-plate.\r\nThe springs of the coupled wheels were connected by means of a\r\ncompensation lever. The dome was placed on the raised fire-box, and\r\nfitted with a screw-down safety valve; a second valve of the same\r\npattern was fixed on the boiler barrel. A roomy and well-enclosed cab,\r\nfitted with side windows, thoroughly protected the enginemen.\r\n\r\nAdams’ radial axle-boxes are, of course, still in use on the Great\r\nNorthern Railway, London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, and other lines,\r\nso that a detailed account here is not necessary, the salient feature\r\nbeing that they are made with a radius, having its centre in the centre\r\nof the adjoining axle, the axle-box guide-boxes being curved to fit. In\r\nthe engine we are now describing the radius of the boxes was 7ft., and\r\nthe lateral play of the boxes was 4½in. on each side. The spring-pins\r\nwere not fixed on the top of the boxes, but were each fitted with a\r\nsmall roller to allow the boxes to freely traverse. The axle-boxes\r\nweighed 3½ cwt. each.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that when an engine fitted with these boxes\r\nenters a right-hand curve the flanges of the leading wheels draw the\r\nboxes to the right, so that the engine itself remains a tangent to\r\nthe curve, whilst, since the axle-boxes are themselves curved, the\r\neffect is that the right-hand side axles are brought nearer the rigid\r\nwheels, and consequently the radial wheels on the opposite side of the\r\nengine further from the fixed wheels, the whole effect of the radial\r\naxle-boxes being that the trailing and leading axles actually become\r\nradii of the curves being traversed, although the flanges continue\r\nparallel to the rails.\r\n\r\nAdams’ spring tyres require a more precise description, and before we\r\ndescribe them, readers may perhaps be reminded that Adams had strong\r\nviews on the subject of railway rolling stock wheels. He enters rather\r\nfully into the matter in his book, “Roads and Rails,” especially in\r\nthe chapter dealing with “the mechanical causes of accidents.” In\r\nthis, Adams maintains that the usual forms of wheels are in reality\r\nrollers, and not wheels.\r\n\r\nThe spring tyres had been tried on the North London Railway, Eastern\r\nCounties, and on another locomotive on the St. Helens Railway, before\r\nthe engine now under review was constructed. Upon the coupled wheels\r\nof the new locomotive for the latter railway, double spring hoops were\r\nemployed, the single form having been used in the three previously\r\nmentioned engines. The plan adopted was as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The tyres chosen were constructed with a deep rib in front; this was\r\nbored out, internally, to a depth of ¾in., and to a conical section,\r\nand, of course, parallel to the tread. A flat edge, ⅜in. wide, was thus\r\nleft on either side.\r\n\r\n“The springs, formed of tempered hoop steel, were placed on the inner\r\nsurface of the tyres. Corresponding curves were turned across the outer\r\ncircumference of the wheels. The wheels were forced into the cones\r\ncontaining the springs, and retained by three 1in. bolts, and a flat\r\nring in the groove at the back of the tyre, the effort of the spring\r\ntyres being to allow of a slight lateral motion in running round curves\r\nand also to give a better grip of the rails, as the tyres, by reason\r\nof the weight upon them being transmitted through the tyre springs,\r\nslightly flattened upon the rails, and so presented a larger surface\r\nfor adhesion between the tyres and rails.”\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of the working of the radial axle\r\nand spring tyre locomotive on the St. Helens Railway is extracted from\r\na paper by Mr. J. Cross, the designer of the locomotive, and read\r\nbefore the Institution of Civil Engineers. Mr. Cross stated that “the\r\nengine was completed in the first week of November, 1863, and has since\r\nbeen running very regularly, taking its turn of duty with passenger\r\ntrains or coal trains, or as a shunting engine; and about the numerous\r\nworks connected by sharp curves with the St. Helens line. The motion\r\nround curves is free from all jerking, and on straight lines the\r\nspeed is more than 60 miles an hour; either end of the engine being\r\nfirst, without any train behind to give steadiness; and the motion is\r\nso smooth that it has only been by taking the actual time that the\r\nengineers have convinced themselves of the fact of the speed exceeding\r\n40 miles an hour. It was built to traverse curves of 200ft. radius.\r\nThis it does with the greatest facility, and it has regularly worked\r\nthe passenger trains round a curve of 1,000ft. radius, going directly\r\noff the straight line by a pair of facing points at a speed of more\r\nthan 30 miles an hour, and it has gone round curves of 132ft. radius.\r\nIt has also run a train of 12 passenger carriages, weighted up to 100\r\ntons, exclusive of its own weight, at 60 miles an hour on the level.\r\nFrom the advantages it possesses over the ordinary mixed engines for\r\nweighting the trailing coupled wheel, it, without difficulty, on a wet,\r\nslippery day, started, and took this load up a gradient of 1 in 70,\r\ndrawing seven of the carriages with a load weighing 72 tons 5 cwt.,\r\nup a gradient of 1 in 36, round a curve of 440ft. radius; and coal\r\ntrains of 250 tons are worked over long gradients of 1 in 200 with the\r\ngreatest ease.\r\n\r\n“It is evident, then, that engines on this principle, affording\r\nfacilities for the use of high power in hilly countries, are peculiarly\r\nadapted for Metropolitan lines, where sharp curves are a necessity\r\n(being equally safe whichever end is foremost), and are also well\r\nsuited for light lines in India and the Colonies. It may likewise\r\nbe remarked that carriages and wagons on this principle would carry\r\nheavier freights, with a saving in the proportion of dead weight, while\r\ntheir friction round curves would be less than at present.”\r\n\r\nThe improvements adopted in the construction of this locomotive for the\r\nSt. Helens Railway were so successful that, as usual, other claimants,\r\nwho appropriated the radial axle-boxes as their invention, were soon\r\ncontending with Adams and Cross as to who was entitled to the honour of\r\nintroducing the improvement.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the Metropolitan Railway was opened on January\r\n18th, 1863, and the line was then worked on the broad-gauge by the\r\nGreat Western Railway for a percentage of the receipts. The Great\r\nWestern Railway provided the stations, staff, locomotives, and rolling\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nMr. D. Gooch, in 1862, designed a special class of tank engines for\r\nworking the Metropolitan Railway. They were six-wheel engines, the\r\ndriving and trailing wheels being 6ft. diameter and coupled. The\r\ncylinders were outside. A special form of fire-box and baffle-plate was\r\nemployed, and tanks were provided beneath the boiler barrel, into which\r\nthe exhaust steam was discharged by means of a reversing valve fitted\r\nto the bottom of the blast pipe. When in the open air, the waste steam\r\nescaped up the chimney in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe first of these engines were named: Bee, Hornet, Locust, Gnat, Wasp,\r\nMosquito, Bug, Khan, Kaiser, Mogul, Shah, and Czar. Later ones were\r\nnamed after flowers and Great Western Railway officers.\r\n\r\nA dispute arose between the two companies at the beginning of August,\r\n1865, and immediately developed into a complete rupture. The smaller\r\n_quasi vassal_ railway, through the energy displayed by its chief\r\nofficers, successfully overcame the apparently insurmountable obstacles\r\nthat beset it, and consequently the Metropolitan Railway asserted its\r\ncomplete independence of the Great Western Railway, and has since\r\nmaintained it.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a nine days’ wonder that the Metropolitan Railway was\r\ncalled upon to perform, for it had to obtain from somewhere locomotives\r\nand carriages to work the underground line, commencing on the morning\r\nof August 10th, 1863.\r\n\r\nMr. Sturrock, the locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern\r\nRailway, had at this time under construction a class of condensing-tank\r\nengines that he had designed to work the Great Northern Railway traffic\r\nover the Metropolitan Railway. The directors of the Metropolitan\r\nRailway in this emergency applied to Mr. Sturrock for assistance, and\r\nby working day and night he managed to fit up some Great Northern\r\ntender engines with a temporary condensing apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was to provide some kind of condensing apparatus on\r\nthe Great Northern tender engines, it being necessary to use flexible\r\nconnecting pipes between the engine and tender strong enough to\r\nwithstand the steam pressure, but Mr. Sturrock was successful enough to\r\ncontrive the necessary flexible pipes by which the exhaust steam was\r\nconveyed from the engine to the water-tank of the tender, but these\r\npipes very frequently burst, and all concerned were far from sorry when\r\nthe proper engines were delivered.\r\n\r\nAn order for eighteen had already been placed with a well-known\r\nManchester firm of locomotive builders by the Metropolitan Railway,\r\nBeyer, Peacock, and Co. building them from the designs of the late Mr.\r\n(afterwards Sir) John Fowler.\r\n\r\nThe type is well known to London readers, the engines having side\r\ntanks, a leading bogie, the wheels of which were 3ft. diameter, with a\r\nbase of 4ft. The driving and trailing wheels (coupled) were 5ft 9in.\r\ndiameter, their base being 8ft. 10in.; the total wheel base being\r\n20ft. 9in., or to centre of bogie, 18ft. 9in. The cylinders were\r\noutside, slightly inclined from the horizontal, 17in. diameter, and\r\n24in. stroke. The grate area was 19 sq. ft. The fire-boxes had sloping\r\ngrates, which were 6in. deeper at the front than the back. The boiler\r\nbarrel was 4ft. in diameter, and 10ft. 3in. long; it contained 166\r\ntubes, 2in. diameter, the total heating surface being 1,014 sq. ft. The\r\nworking pressure was nominally 130lb. per sq. in., but when working\r\nthrough the tunnels, condensing the steam, and with the dampers closed,\r\na very much lower pressure resulted. The frames were inside, the dome\r\n(fitted with a Salter valve) was on the boiler barrel, close to the\r\nsmoke-box, a sand-box being also fixed on the boiler barrel at the back\r\nof the dome.\r\n\r\nThe bogie truck was built of plate frames, and was on the Bissell\r\nsystem, turning on a centre-pin fixed to the engine frame, at a radial\r\ndistance of 6ft. 8in. from the centre of the truck. “Locomotive\r\nEngineering” says that “this radial length ensures a nearly correct\r\nradiality of the bogie to curves of all radii, the proper length of\r\nthe radius to ensure exact radiality of the centre of the bogie for\r\nall curves being 7ft. 2in., or 6in. more than the actual length—a\r\ndifference which is, perhaps, of no great importance in practice.”\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of effectually condensing the exhaust steam the side\r\ntanks were only filled with water to within 6in. of the top, and the\r\nsteam was discharged upon the surface of the water, from a 7in. pipe on\r\neach side—one to each tank. Into the mouth of these 7in. pipes a 4in.\r\npipe was projected a short distance, and the other end of the 4in. pipe\r\nwas below the surface of the water, so that a portion of the steam was\r\ndischarged right into the water in the tanks, and agitated the water\r\nsufficiently to prevent the surface of the water from becoming too hot,\r\nas would have been the case if the same portion of the water had always\r\nbeen presented to the waste steam. The tanks held 1,000 gallons, and at\r\nthe end of a journey the water had become too warm to properly condense\r\nthe exhaust, and it therefore became necessary to quickly empty the\r\ntanks and to take in a fresh supply of cold water.\r\n\r\nTo expeditiously perform the former operation, each tank was provided\r\nwith a pipe 7in. in diameter; this led to a cast-iron valve-box being\r\nplaced below the foot-plate. By means of a screw, worked from the\r\nfoot-plate, a 10in. valve was operated, and the water in the tanks\r\ncould be discharged into the pits below the engine in the course of\r\nsome 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the names and builders’ numbers of the first\r\nlocomotives constructed for the Metropolitan Railway:\r\n\r\n    Engine  Name.

Weight of engine in working order: on bogie, 11 tons 3½ cwt.;\r\ndriving, 15 tons 9½ cwt.; and trailing, 15 tons 10 cwt. Total weight,\r\n42 tons 3 cwt.\r\n\r\nMr. Sturrock’s engines for working the Great Northern trains over the\r\nMetropolitan Railway were numbered 241 to 250, their leading dimensions\r\nbeing:—Cylinders (inside), 16½in. diameter, 22in. stroke; leading and\r\ndriving wheels (coupled), 5ft. 6in.; trailing wheels, 4ft. diameter;\r\nwheel base, L. to D., 7ft. 6in.; D. to T., 11ft. 9in.; total, 19ft.\r\n3in. Weight, empty, 32 tons 4 cwt. 1 qr.; in working order, 39 tons 12\r\ncwt. 2 qrs.\r\n\r\nThese Great Northern Railway locomotives were fitted with Adams’ radial\r\naxle-boxes to the trailing wheels, and commenced working at the end of\r\nOctober, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe patentee of the Bissell bogie truck did not intend to hide\r\nthe light of his invention under a bushel, for he advertised the\r\nimprovement in a truly American style. The following advertisement was\r\nto be found in the columns of the sober railway newspapers soon after\r\nthe Metropolitan locomotives were at work:—\r\n\r\n    “Important to Railway Directors, Engineers, and the Travelling\r\n        public.\r\n\r\n    “No more accidents from engines running off the line (see\r\n        Queen’s letter to Railway Directors copied in the railway\r\n        papers January 28th, 1866).\r\n\r\n    “The Bissell bogie, or safety truck, for locomotive engines, so\r\n        much prized on American and foreign railroads for the great\r\n        safety and economy it affords on curved roadways, after\r\n        years of probationary trial in England, has at length been\r\n        adopted by John Fowler, Esq., C.E., F.G.S., upon all\r\n        the new engines, eighteen in number, now working on the\r\n        Metropolitan Railway, and by Robert Sinclair, Esq., C.E.,\r\n        upon twenty new eight-wheeled engines on the Great Eastern\r\n        Railway, which may be seen daily. The royalty for the use\r\n        of the Bissell Patents has been reduced to £10 per engine,\r\n        so that every engine requiring a bogie underframe should be\r\n        provided with the Bissell safety truck. Apply to——.”\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of railway advertisements we take the opportunity\r\nto record the obituary announcement of the tentative “hot-brick”\r\nengine, previously referred to, designed to work on the Metropolitan\r\nRailway. It appeared in the railway newspapers during the early months\r\nof 1865, and was to the following effect: “Metropolitan Railway. One\r\nlocomotive engine for sale, either entire or in parts. For particulars\r\napply to the Locomotive Superintendent, Bishop’s Road, Paddington.”\r\n\r\nReference must here be made to Mr. Sturrock’s system of steam tenders,\r\nas adopted by him to work the heavy coal and goods trains on the Great\r\nNorthern Railway. In addition to the usual engine, the pistons of a\r\npair of cylinders, 12in. diameter, with a stroke of 17in. actuated\r\nthe centre axle of the tender, and the six tender wheels were coupled\r\nby outside rods. The tender wheels were 4ft. 6in. diameter. The\r\nsteam tenders weighed about 35 tons, with water and coal, and of\r\nthis weight over 13 tons was on the driving wheels. After use in the\r\ntender cylinders, the exhaust steam was condensed in the tender tank.\r\nForty-six of these steam tenders were constructed, and some are still\r\nrunning, but as simple tenders, the propelling apparatus having been\r\ndone away with many years ago. Fig. 85A represents a Great Northern\r\nengine fitted with one of Sturrock’s patent steam tenders.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Sinclair, whilst locomotive superintendent of the Great\r\nEastern Railway, only designed one type of tank engine, and Neilson and\r\nCo. constructed the first of this class in 1864. Twenty of the class\r\nwere built, being originally intended to work the Enfield Town Branch,\r\nbut in later years these engines were used on the North Woolwich line.\r\nThe engines (Fig. 86A) were supported by eight wheels, the leading and\r\ntrailing being 3ft. 7in. diameter, and the driving and back coupled\r\n5ft. 6in. diameter. The cylinders were outside, 15in. diameter, and\r\n22in. stroke. The leading and trailing wheels were fitted with the\r\nBissell truck, referred to in the advertisement just quoted. So that\r\nalthough the whole wheel base was 17ft. 4in., the rigid base—that of\r\nthe coupled wheels—was only 6ft. The boiler was 13ft. 6in. long, and\r\nthe water was carried in the tanks beneath the boiler and between\r\nthe frames. An enclosed cab with front and rear spectacle plates was\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85A.—A GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY ENGINE, FITTED WITH\r\nONE OF STURROCK’S PATENT STEAM TENDERS.]\r\n\r\nThis improvement so delighted the Great Eastern Railway drivers that\r\nthey presented a testimonial to Mr. R. Sinclair in May, 1864, in which\r\nthey described him as the “inventor” of the weather-board or “cab,” as\r\nfitted to locomotives. The tank engines in question weighed 38 tons 6\r\ncwt. 3 qrs., of which weight 20 tons 5 cwt. 2 qrs. was on the coupled\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86A.—SINCLAIR’S DESIGN OF TANK ENGINE FOR THE\r\nEASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1863, Mr. J. B. Fell patented a locomotive designed for\r\nworking over extremely steep gradients. At that time there was a\r\nbreak 47 miles long in the continuity of the iron road communication\r\nbetween France and Italy by the Mount Cenis route. This break has\r\nin later years been abolished by the construction and working of\r\nthe famous Mount Cenis tunnel. Brassey and Co. in 1863 proposed\r\nthat during the construction of the tunnel a temporary mountain\r\nrailway worked on Fell’s system should be built over the mountain.\r\nAn experimental locomotive was, therefore, constructed at the Canada\r\nWorks, Birkenhead. This engine weighed 14½ tons loaded. The boiler\r\nwas 2ft. 9in. diameter, and 7ft. 9½in. long, and contained 100 tubes\r\nof 1½in. external diameter. The heating surface was 420 sq. ft., and\r\nthe grate area 6½ sq. ft. The engine had two sets of machinery—one\r\nfor working the vertical wheels, acting on the ordinary carrying\r\nrails, and the other actuated the special horizontal clutch wheels,\r\nwhich were pressed against the centre rail. The outside cylinders\r\nwhich worked the four-coupled vertical wheels, of 2ft. 3in. diameter,\r\nwere 11¾in. diameter, the stroke being 18in. The horizontal coupled\r\nwheels were 16in. diameter, with a base of 19in.; these were driven\r\nby inside cylinders 11in. diameter and 10in. stroke. A pressure of 12\r\ntons, actuated by means of a screw apparatus, could be applied to the\r\nhorizontal wheels.\r\n\r\nBy permission of the London and North Western Railway, an experimental\r\nrailway, 800 yards long, was laid down upon the Whalley Bridge Incline\r\nof the Cromford and High Peak Railway.\r\n\r\nThe gauge was 3ft. 7⅝in., and there were 180 yards of straight line on\r\na gradient of 1 in 13.5, and 150 yards of curves, with radii of 2½ and\r\n3½ chains, on a gradient of 1 in 12. The third rail upon this line, to\r\nbe clipped between the horizontal driving wheels of the engine, was\r\nlaid on its side, 7½in. above the other rails.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a series of experiments carried on from September,\r\n1863, to February, 1864, the engine, working up to a pressure of 120lb.\r\nto the square inch, never failed, with a maximum load of 30 tons, to\r\ntake a load of 24 tons up the above inclines and round the curves. The\r\nouter cylinders working on the four vertical wheels could only draw\r\nup, besides the weight of the engine, a loaded wagon weighing seven\r\ntons; while the inside cylinders, acting upon the horizontal wheels,\r\nwhich pressed with 12 tons against the middle rail, enabled the engine\r\nto take up 24 tons on the same day and under the same conditions. The\r\ninside cylinders alone were able to carry up the engine itself, round\r\nthe curves, and exhibited the power of taking up altogether 17 tons.\r\n\r\nThe results of the experiments on the High Peak Railway were considered\r\nso satisfactory that the line up Mount Cenis was commenced without\r\ndelay. The engine was not properly adapted for working the mountain\r\ntraffic, in consequence of the crowded and complicated nature of the\r\nmachinery, and also because the feed-oil dropped on to the horizontal\r\nwheels and lessened the bite on the centre rail. The weight on the\r\nhorizontal wheels was increased to 16 tons, and an additional pair of\r\nguide wheels acting on the centre rail was provided at the trailing end\r\nof the engine, after the High Peak experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade was at that time so far interested in railway\r\nmatters as to send out Captain Tyler, one of its inspectors, to report\r\non the Mount Cenis Railway. We extract from his report the following\r\naccount of the working of this engine on the mountain railway:—\r\n\r\n“In the course of two days I took six trips with this engine up and\r\ndown the experimental line, carrying each time a load of 16 tons, in\r\nthree wagons, including the weight of the wagons, and it performed in\r\nthe ascent 1,800 metres in 8⅛min., with a loss of 14lb. of steam and of\r\n5⅓in. of water in the gauge-glass, at steam pressure, varying between\r\n92 and 125lb. to the square inch in the boiler, as the average of all\r\nthose experiments.\r\n\r\n“The speed attained was in every case greater than that which it is\r\nproposed to run with the same load with the express trains; and the\r\naverage speed, as above given, was at the rate of 13⅓ kilometres (or 8⅓\r\nEnglish miles) per hour, instead of 12 kilometres (or 7½ English miles)\r\nper hour, which is the highest running speed allowed in the programme\r\ngiven to the French Government for this part of the line.\r\n\r\n“The weather was fine and calm, and the bearing rails were in\r\nfirst-rate order; but the middle rail, as well as the horizontal\r\nwheels, were oily, and, therefore, in a condition very unfavourable for\r\ngood adhesion.”\r\n\r\nA second engine was built on Fell’s system specially for working\r\nover the steep Mount Cenis Railway, and in its construction several\r\nimprovements, suggested by the shortcomings of the first engine, were\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe second engine was built partly of steel, and weighed 13 tons empty,\r\nand 16 tons 17 cwt. fully loaded, afterwards increased to 17 tons 2\r\ncwt. The boiler was 8ft. 4½in. long, and 3ft. 2in. in diameter, and\r\ncontained 158 tubes of 1½in. external diameter. Fire-box and tubes\r\ncontained altogether 600 superficial feet of heating surface, and\r\nthere were 10ft. of fire-grate area. There were only two cylinders,\r\nwith a diameter of 15in. and stroke of 16in., which worked both the\r\nfour-coupled horizontal and four-coupled vertical wheels, which were\r\nall 27in. in diameter. The wheel base of the vertical wheels was\r\n6ft 10in., and that of the horizontal wheels, 2ft. 4in. The maximum\r\npressure in the boiler was 120lb., and the effective pressure on the\r\npiston was 75lb. to the square inch.\r\n\r\nBesides possessing a greater amount of boiler power, this engine\r\ntravelled more steadily than No. 1, its machinery was more easily\r\nattended to, and the pressure upon its horizontal wheels could be\r\nregulated by the engine-driver at pleasure from the foot-plate. This\r\npressure was applied through an iron rod connected by means of right\r\nand left-handed screws, with a beam on each side of the middle rail,\r\nand these beams acted upon volute springs which pressed the horizontal\r\nwheels against that rail.\r\n\r\nThe pressure employed during the experiments was 2½ tons on each\r\nhorizontal wheel, or 10 tons altogether; but the pressure actually\r\nprovided for, and which when necessary was employed, was 6 tons upon\r\neach, or 24 tons upon the four horizontal wheels.\r\n\r\nThe vertical wheels were worked indirectly by piston-rods from the\r\nfront, and the horizontal wheels directly by piston-rods from the back\r\nof the cylinders.\r\n\r\nHaving already given Captain Tyler’s account of his experiments with\r\nthe first engine, we cannot do better than reproduce his statement\r\nconcerning the second of the Fell engines, built for the Mount Cenis\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nCaptain Tyler stated that with the new engine he “was able to take up\r\n1,800 metres of the experimental line with the same load as before, of\r\n16 tons in three wagons, in 6¼ minutes, or at a speed of 17¾ kilometres\r\nper hour, as against 12 kilometres per hour which it is proposed to run\r\nwith the express trains. The steam pressure in the boiler fell from\r\n112lb. to 102½lb., and 3in. of water were lost in the gauge-glass,\r\nthe feed having been turned on during the latter period only of this\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n“The engine exerted in this instance, omitting the extra resistance\r\nfrom curves, about 177 horse-power; or, adding 10 per cent. for the\r\nresistance from curves, 195 horse-power, or more than 12 horse-power to\r\neach ton of its own weight, and nearly 60 horse-power in excess of what\r\nwas required to take the same load up the same gradient and curves at\r\n12 kilometres per hour, as proposed in the programme. I observed on the\r\nfollowing day that 40lb. of steam-pressure in the boiler, or one-third\r\nof the maximum pressure employed, was sufficient to move the engine\r\nalone up a gradient of 1 in 12½; and the friction of carriages or\r\nwagons being proportionately much less than that of an engine, the same\r\nengine ought, _à fortiori_, to be able to move a gross load of three\r\ntimes its own weight, or 48 tons, at its greatest working pressure, up\r\nthe same gradient.”\r\n\r\nHaving now given some details of locomotives constructed for working on\r\na foreign steep grade railway, it will not be out of place to describe\r\nthe special forms of engines designed for the Welsh narrow-gauge line,\r\nusually called the Festiniog Railway. The line has been open for a\r\ngreat number of years, but up to June, 1863, had only been used for\r\nconveying slates from the quarries to the shipping port. Horses were\r\nemployed to haul the empty trucks up to the quarries, the loaded wagons\r\nrunning down to Portmadoc by gravity.\r\n\r\nThe average gradient for 12½ miles was 1 in 92, the steepest 1 in 60.\r\nThe radii of the curves ranged between two and four chains. Unlike the\r\nMount Cenis line just reviewed, the Festiniog Railway was worked with\r\nlocomotives depending solely on the adhesion of the carrying wheels, no\r\ncentral rail being provided. The gauge was 1ft. 11½in.\r\n\r\nThe engines were designed by Mr. C. E. Spooner, the engineer of the\r\nrailway. At first two were constructed, England and Co. being the\r\nbuilders. These miniature iron horses (one was more correctly called\r\nthe “Welsh _Pony_”) had two pairs of coupled wheels, with a wheel base\r\nof 5ft. The cylinders, which were outside the framing, were 8½in. in\r\ndiameter, with a length of stroke of 12in., and they were only 6in.\r\nabove the rails.\r\n\r\nThe maximum working pressure of the steam was 200lb. to the square\r\ninch. Water was carried in tanks surrounding the boilers, and coal in\r\nsmall four-wheel tenders.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest of these engines weighed 7½ tons in working order, and\r\nthey cost £900 each. They could take up, at 10 miles an hour, about 50\r\ntons, including the weight of the carriages and trucks, but exclusive\r\nof that of the engine and tender. They actually conveyed daily on\r\nthe up journey an average of 50 tons of goods and 100 passengers,\r\nbesides parcels. Two hundred and sixty tons of slates were taken down\r\nto Portmadoc daily. The engines were well adapted for convenience in\r\nstarting and in working at slow speeds, but their short wheel base and\r\nthe weight overhanging the trailing wheels gave them more or less of a\r\njumping motion when running.\r\n\r\nSafety guards, similar in form to snow ploughs, were afterwards added\r\nin front of the engines, behind the tenders, and under the platforms of\r\nthe brake-vans, in consequence of their being so near to the rails.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years’ experience of these four-wheel locomotives, the\r\ndirectors of the Festiniog Railway determined to experiment with an\r\nengine constructed on Fairlie’s double-bogie system, and the “Little\r\nWonder” was constructed. In February, 1870, several trials were made\r\nwith this engine, when a train of 72 wagons, of a total length of\r\n648ft., and of a gross weight, including the engine, of 206 tons 2\r\nqrs., was drawn up an incline of 1 in 85 at a speed of five miles an\r\nhour, the steam pressure being 200lb. per square inch. The “Welsh\r\nPony’s” best performance in these trials upon the same gradient, but\r\nwith a pressure of 150lb., consisted in drawing 26 wagons, the gross\r\nload of which, with engine, amounted to 73 tons 16 cwt. Tabulated, the\r\nresult of these trials were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                    Total     Gravity.   Frictional\r\n                                 resistance.    lbs.     resistance.\r\n                                lbs. per ton    per         lbs.\r\n                                    gross.      ton.      per ton.\r\n\r\n    “Little Wonder”                    40        26.3       13.7\r\n    “Welsh Pony” with 150lbs steam     51.4      26.3       25.1\r\n         ”         ”  130lbs steam     44.5      26.3       18.2\r\n\r\nThe general arrangements of the “Little Wonder” may be described as\r\nfollows. The boiler was double, having two fire-boxes united back to\r\nback with two distinct barrels and sets of flue-tubes, and consequently\r\na chimney at each end. A bogie was placed under each barrel, and each\r\nbogie had two pairs of wheels coupled together, worked independently\r\nby a pair of steam-cylinders to each bogie. Thus a total wheel base\r\nof 19ft. 1in. in length was covered by the bogies; each bogie had a\r\n5ft. wheel base, and the distance between the centres of the bogies\r\nwas 14ft. 1in. The four cylinders were 8³/₁₆in. in diameter, and\r\nhad a stroke of 13in.; the wheels were 2ft. 4in. in diameter. The\r\ncombined grate area was 11 sq. ft., and the heating surface 730 sq. ft.\r\nFairlie’s system of double engines soon came into repute for working\r\nsteep gradients, and many very powerful engines were and are still\r\nconstructed on his system for use on foreign railways. Fairlie, in\r\nconjunction with Samuels, adapted his system to a species of combined\r\nlocomotive and carriage, and, in 1869, one was constructed for working\r\non the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway between Swanley Junction and\r\nSevenoaks. Seven passenger compartments were provided in this vehicle,\r\naccommodation comprising seats for 16 first-class and 50 second-class\r\npassengers; its total length was 43ft., and weight, empty, 13½ tons.\r\nThe leading end was supported by the engine bogie, and the trailing end\r\nby an ordinary bogie truck. Curves of only 50ft. radius were easily\r\npassed over by the combination vehicle.\r\n\r\nLeaving Fairlie and his combinations, both of locomotives and\r\ncarriages, and also of double locomotives, we now glance at a class\r\nof tank engines designed by Cudworth for working the trains between\r\nCannon Street and Charing Cross upon the opening of the former terminus\r\nin 1866. These engines were seven in number, and were constructed at\r\nthe Canada Works. They were of the “coupled in front” pattern, with a\r\ntrailing bogie. The cylinders were inside, 15in. diameter and 20in.\r\nstroke. The coupled wheels were 5ft. 6in. diameter. Outside frames were\r\nemployed, and also compensation beams both to the coupled and bogie\r\nwheels. The coal bunker, with water-tank under, was of exceptional\r\nlength. It was always a puzzle to the writer as to how a stout driver\r\ncould manage to squeeze through the narrow entrances to the foot-plate,\r\nespecially as these apertures were situate at the side of the fire-box;\r\nbut evidently the “trick was done” by following the axiom, “Where\r\nthere’s a will there’s a way,” and doubtless the drivers, if asked,\r\nwould have replied, “It’s very easy if you only know the way.” These\r\nSouth Eastern Railway locomotives were numbered 235 to 241.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Gowan, locomotive superintendent of the Great North of\r\nScotland Railway, designed a class of engine, which Neilson and Co.\r\nconstructed. The design was stated to be that of a “goods” locomotive,\r\nbut upon examination we find the engines in question to be no other\r\nthan the popular four-coupled behind, with a leading bogie and\r\noutside cylinders. The latter were arranged in a horizontal position\r\nimmediately below the frames. The coupled wheels were 5ft. 6½in.\r\ndiameter, with underhung springs connected by means of an equalising\r\nlever-beam. The bogie wheels were 3ft. in diameter, with a base of 6ft.\r\nInside bearings were supplied to the bogie axles. The boiler barrel\r\nmeasured 10ft. 10⅛in. between the tube-plates, its external diameter\r\nwas 4ft. 1in., and it contained 206 tubes of 1¾in. diameter. The engine\r\nwas fitted with D. K. Clarke’s system of smoke-consuming apparatus,\r\npreviously described. The fire-box was of the raised pattern, and the\r\nsteam dome was placed on it. The engine weighed 39 tons 13 cwt., and\r\nthe tender 27 tons, in working order.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance this “goods” engine resembled in a remarkable\r\ndegree the London and South Western Railway express passenger engines\r\nas built by Mr. Adams. The tender was carried on six wheels.\r\n\r\nFig. 85B represents Beattie’s standard design of goods engine for the L.\r\nand S.W.R. in 1866, the wheels were 5ft. 1in. diameter, the cylinders\r\nbeing inside, and having a diameter of 17in., the stroke 24in. Beyer,\r\nPeacock and Co. were the builders. Fig. 86B represents an engine of this\r\nclass as rebuilt some years later at Nine Elms Works.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Mr. W. Adams placed upon the North London Railway the\r\nfirst locomotive constructed from a design which has, in its broad\r\nfeatures and general outline, ever since been a model of simplicity,\r\nattractiveness, and utility, showing, as the design does, what engines\r\nconstructed to work important local traffic should be like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85B.—BEATTIE’S STANDARD GOODS ENGINE, L. & S.W.R.,\r\n1866]\r\n\r\nIn its original form there were some points that need alteration, as\r\nthey certainly spoilt the general symmetrical effect of an otherwise\r\nartistic appearance. We may as well allude to these defects at once,\r\nand then proceed to detail the locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe first of such blots on the design was the placing of a cylindrical\r\nsand-box on the top of the boiler barrel, between the chimney and\r\nthe dome. To show that such a position for this useful appendage was\r\nnot necessary, we mention that only the driving wheels were supplied\r\nwith sand from this unsightly excrescence, the supply of sand for the\r\ntrailing wheels (for use when running bunker in front) being placed\r\nin an unobtrusive position. If the latter sand-boxes could thus be\r\nlocated, why was it necessary to place that for the leading wheels\r\nin so conspicuous a position? This example of awkward location of so\r\nuseful an adjunct is further emphasised when we remember that these\r\nengines run just as frequently bunker first as chimney first. Further,\r\nin consequence of the position of this sand-box, the rod for working\r\nthe sand valves was carried along the top of the boiler barrel, several\r\ninches above its surface, thus still more detracting from the symmetry\r\nof the design. The other feature we wish to allude to, is the shape of\r\nthe dome cover, the whole of which was of a needlessly ugly contour.\r\nThen, again, in later years an enclosed cab was added, the back and\r\nfront of which, being of sheet-iron, extending to the extreme of the\r\ncoal bunker, and with no return sides, has given a rather toy-like\r\nappearance to these otherwise fine locomotives. We are glad to be able\r\nto mention that when these engines were rebuilt, the objectionable\r\nsand-box was removed, and a more pleasing form of steam dome provided,\r\nbut this improvement was in a great measure negatived by the black\r\nenamelled iron which is now used for the cover in place of the bright\r\nbrass formerly employed for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86B.—BEATTIE’S GOODS ENGINE, L. & S.W.R., REBUILT]\r\n\r\nHaving thus mentioned the defects in appearance, rather than utility,\r\nof the North London Railway passenger tanks (Fig. 87), we can proceed\r\nto do justice to this really fine class of engines designed by Mr.\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\nThe outside cylinders were 17in. diameter, and the stroke was 24in.\r\nThe driving and trailing wheels (coupled) were 5ft. 3in. diameter, the\r\nbogie wheels being 2ft. 9in. diameter. The heating surface was 1,015\r\nsq. feet. The boiler was 4ft. 1in. diameter, and contained 200 tubes\r\nof 1¾in. diameter. A good feature in the design was the high steam\r\npressure employed—viz., 160lb. per sq. in.—and there can be no doubt\r\nthat much of the success of this class of engine can be traced to the\r\nuse of so high a pressure of steam at a time—29 years ago—when other\r\nlines were using a much lower pressure. Indeed, to-day it is only\r\nnecessary to watch a North London and any of several other railway\r\ncompanies’ trains starting side by side, and it will be observed that\r\nthe North London generally gets away first; these engines are, in fact,\r\ncapital at starting, and soon attain a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—ADAMS’S PASSENGER TANK ENGINE, N.L.R., AS\r\nREBUILT BY MR. PRYCE]\r\n\r\nThe weight was as follows:—\r\n\r\n                        Empty.         Loaded.\r\n                        tons cwt.      tons cwt.\r\n    On bogie wheels     15 14          14 14½\r\n    On driving wheels   11 11          14  5\r\n    On trailing wheels  11  7          14 12½\r\n                       ------         ----------\r\n    Total               38 12          43 12\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—PRYCE’S 6-COUPLED TANK GOODS ENGINE, NORTH\r\nLONDON RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, when empty, the bogie axles supported 19½\r\ncwt. more of the gross weight than when the engine was in working\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe wheel base of the bogie was 5ft. 8in. The coupled wheels have\r\nunderhung springs connected by a compensation beam. India-rubber\r\nsprings are used in connection with the hanging of the springs, and\r\nalso to guide the bogie, etc., and it was found that such springs\r\nanswered the use to which they were put in a most admirable manner.\r\n\r\nIn all the new engines that have lately been built, and when rebuilding\r\nold engines of this type, the cylinders have been increased to 17½in.\r\ndiameter, and other things considerably modified in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—LOCOMOTIVE AND TRAVELLING CRANE, N.L.R.]\r\n\r\nMr. Pryce has also built 24 powerful six-wheel tank engines (Fig. 88)\r\nfor dealing with the N.L.R. goods traffic. These engines are very\r\nefficient. They have outside cylinders 17in. diameter, 24in. stroke,\r\nand 4ft. 4in. coupled wheels. Boiler pressure, 160lb. per sq. in.\r\nWeight in working order, 45 tons 9 cwt., all available for adhesion.\r\nThe total wheel base is 11ft. 4in.; consequently, they take curves\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nThe coal consumption of these engines was very satisfactory. The trains\r\nof the North London Railway consist of twelve vehicles, weighing,\r\nempty, 90 tons 14 cwt., and loaded 112 tons 6 cwt., but the coal\r\nconsumption, with very frequent stoppages, only averaged 30.28lb. per\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nFig. 89 represents the combined saddle-tank locomotive and crane\r\nbelonging to the North London Railway, as recently rebuilt by Mr.\r\nPryce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Beattie’s express engines—Kendall’s three-cylinder engine\r\n        for the Blythe and Tyne Railway—Heavy engines for the\r\n        Metropolitan and St. John’s Wood Railway—Sold to the\r\n        Taff Vale Railway—“The most powerful locomotive in\r\n        the world” for sale—“Jinks’s Babies”—The “Areo-steam”\r\n        locomotive on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway—Tank\r\n        engines on the Furness Railway—Patrick Stirling’s\r\n        world-famous “8ft. singles” for the G.W.R.—Webb’s\r\n        “Precedents” for the L. and N.W.R.—The “John Ramsbottom”\r\n        —“The Firefly,” an engine that has “played many\r\n        parts”—J.

The coupled wheels were 7ft.\r\n1in. diameter, and the leading wheels 4ft. diameter. The heating\r\nsurface was 1,102 sq. ft. Weight of engine in working order, 35 tons\r\n11 cwt. For some years this class of engine was the favourite express\r\nengine on the L. and S.W.R.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—“PYTHON,” A 7FT. 1IN. COUPLED EXPRESS ENGINE,\r\nLONDON AND SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nLocomotive engineers have always one great difficulty to provide\r\nfor—viz., the extra power required to start locomotives, especially\r\non steep inclines, and as such grades are particularly _en évidence_\r\non the mineral lines, it is not surprising to find Mr. W. Kendall, of\r\nPercy Main, Northumberland, patenting a locomotive designed to overcome\r\nthe defects just indicated. The patent is dated October 26th, 1867. The\r\nengine was of the three-cylinder type, with one inside and two outside\r\ncylinders. When running on a level road only the inside cylinder was\r\nused, but for starting or ascending inclines the power of all three was\r\nbrought into use, the whole arrangement of the power being actuated by\r\nthe reversing gear apparatus. By a peculiar adaptation of the lap of\r\nthe valves, a small quantity of steam was admitted to the valves of\r\nthe outside cylinders when these cylinders were not working, for the\r\npurpose of lubrication. The engine in question was built at the Percy\r\nMain Works of the Blythe and Tyne Railway. She was of the “four-coupled\r\nbehind” type, with a single pair of leading wheels. The inside\r\ncylinder was connected in the usual manner to the cranked axle of the\r\ncentre wheels, the outside cylinders actuating the trailing pairs of\r\nwheels. Without diagrams it is rather difficult to explain the method\r\nemployed to prevent the pistons, etc., of the outside cylinders from\r\nreciprocating, but shortly it may be stated that the connecting-rod\r\nwas divided into two pieces, and at the joint each end fitted into an\r\nenclosed link. When disconnected, that portion of the rod coupled to\r\nthe wheels which was in the link merely travelled up and down the link,\r\nwhilst the part connected with the piston, etc., was at rest. By means\r\nof a screw gear this latter portion of the connecting-rod was lowered\r\nin the link, and engaged with the other part of the rod, which was\r\ncoupled to the wheels, and so the outside cylinders were brought into\r\naction. If required, the outside cylinders could be used independently\r\nof the one inside cylinder, so that the engine could be a one, two, or\r\nthree cylinder locomotive. Separate regulators were provided for the\r\ninside and outside cylinders, but the handles were coupled together,\r\nso that, if required, one movement actuated the admission of steam to\r\nall the cylinders. To prevent too strong a blast, the driver could, by\r\nthe operation of a ball valve, discharge the exhaust steam from the\r\noutside cylinders into the atmosphere by means of a pipe in front of\r\nthe engine. On the other hand, the whole of the exhaust from the three\r\ncylinders could be discharged up the chimney in the usual manner if\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nUpon April 13th, 1868, the Metropolitan and St. John’s Wood Railway was\r\nopened for traffic. The line branches from the Metropolitan Railway at\r\nBaker Street, and was worked by the Metropolitan Company. The gradients\r\non the short line are very severe, and it was not considered advisable\r\nto attempt to work the railway by the usual type of engine employed on\r\nthe underground line; so Mr Burnett, the then locomotive superintendent\r\nof the Metropolitan Railway, designed a special class of engine for\r\nthe St. John’s Wood Railway. These were constructed by the Worcester\r\nEngine Company, and were numbered 34 to 38. They were provided with six\r\ncoupled wheels of 4ft. diameter, with outside bearings; the cylinders\r\nwere 20in. diameter, with a 24in. stroke; they were placed within\r\nthe frames at 2ft. 2in. centres. The wheel base of these powerful\r\nlocomotives was divided as follows:—L. to D., 6ft. 10in.; D. to T.,\r\n7ft. 2in. The boiler was 11ft. long, and 4ft. 3in. diameter, and\r\ncontained 176 tubes of 2in. diameter.\r\n\r\nThe fire-boxes were exceptionally large, the measurements being:\r\nLength, outside 7ft. 1in., inside 6ft. 6in.; width, outside 4ft.,\r\ninside 3ft. 6in. The depth was 5ft. 5in. in front, sloping to 3ft.\r\n11in. at back. The steam pressure was 140lb.; heating surface, 1,165\r\nsq. ft.; grate area, 22½ sq. ft. The water capacity of the tanks was\r\n1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThese mammoth engines weighed 46 tons in working order, and it was\r\nsoon discovered that they were far too powerful for working the light\r\ntraffic over the St John’s Wood line, the ordinary type of Metropolitan\r\nlocomotives being quite capable of successfully working the trains over\r\nthese inclines. So, in 1873, when the Taff Vale Railway was in urgent\r\nneed of some powerful engines for hauling the heavy coal trains over\r\nthe Penarth Dock lines, the Metropolitan Railway succeeded in disposing\r\nof these five engines to the South Wales Company, and they can still be\r\nseen employed on work more adapted to their construction than was that\r\nof hauling light passenger trains on the St. John’s Wood Railway.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that both the patentee and builders of the “double-bogie”\r\nlocomotives had a very exalted opinion of the capabilities of\r\nthese peculiar engines. In December, 1870, G. England and Co. were\r\nadvertising for sale by private tender to the best bidder “the most\r\npowerful locomotive at present known upon any railway in the United\r\nKingdom, irrespective of gauge.”\r\n\r\nThis “most powerful” locomotive was constructed for the 4ft. 8½in.\r\ngauge on Fairlie’s double-bogie system. She had four cylinders, 15in.\r\ndiameter and 22in. stroke, eight wheels, all drivers of 4ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter, and with steel tyres.\r\n\r\nAmongst other useful features claimed for this “most powerful”\r\nlocomotive, we read that she “would take a load up an incline at a\r\nspeed exceeding that of any other engine at present known, and would\r\nround the sharpest curves with ease.”\r\n\r\n“Jinks’s Babies” consisted of a batch of ten engines constructed\r\ntowards the end of 1871, and early in 1872. They had outside cylinders,\r\n17in. diameter and 30in. stroke, with a leading bogie and four coupled\r\nwheels of 7ft. diameter; they had, perhaps, as good a right to the\r\ntitle “most powerful” as the Fairlie engine just mentioned.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, however, “Jinks’s Babies” were not successful.\r\nThey were built at the Stockton and Darlington Locomotive Works, at\r\nDarlington, and originally numbered 238 to 240, etc., and upon the\r\nconsolidation of the North Eastern Railway were renumbered 1238 to\r\n1240, etc. They were rebuilt by Mr. Fletcher as six-wheel engines,\r\nthe bogie giving place to a single pair of leading wheels, and the\r\nstroke of the pistons was reduced from 30in. to 26in. Even after this\r\nmetamorphosis, “Jinks’s Babies” could not be truthfully described as\r\nsuccessful locomotives. Amongst other peculiarities the circular valves\r\nshould be enumerated. The steam pressure was 140lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway fitted up an engine with\r\nan apparatus said to have been invented by Mr. Richard Eaton, but\r\ncalled “Warsop’s Aero-Steam system,” by means of which a continuous\r\nsupply of heated air was forced into the bottom of the boiler, so\r\ncausing the water to be continually agitated, and thereby preventing\r\nincrustation of the metal, as well as more quickly generating\r\nsteam, and last—but far from least—economising the fuel. The engine\r\nexperimented upon was a six-coupled goods, No. 369, with cylinders\r\n15in. by 24in., 5ft. wheels, and working at a pressure of 130lb. per\r\nsq. in. An air pump, single acting, 6in. diameter by 2ft. stroke, with\r\npiston and metallic rings, driven from one of the main cross-heads,\r\nwas secured to the framework of the engine in the place originally\r\noccupied by the feed-pump. The compressed air passed along a pipe 1½in.\r\nin diameter, 6ft. long, to a coil of 1½in. lap-welded iron pipe, within\r\nthe smoke-box, 61ft. in length, so arranged as to avoid contact with\r\nthe blast pipe or the ashes deposited in the smoke-box by the action of\r\nthe blast. After traversing the coil, the expanded air became heated\r\nto a temperature nearly as high as that of the waste gases, and thus\r\nranging between 500 degrees and 800 degrees, or 850 degrees Fahr.,\r\nlifted the self-acting valve, and entered the perforated distributing\r\npipe within the boiler, and was constantly passing in jets through\r\nthe water to the steam space, whence the combined powers of steam and\r\nair proceeded to the cylinders to carry out their duty. A very simple\r\napparatus was used when desirable to stop compression, by keeping the\r\ninlet valve open when steam was shut off; otherwise an undue proportion\r\nof air would enter the boiler, and impede the feed-water injectors.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, occasions arose where a judicious use of the air\r\ninjection was made with great advantage, even with steam shut off. It\r\nis stated that “on March 21st, 1872, there was a heavy fall of snow,\r\nand the driver of No. 369 had to make the most of his resources. In\r\ncoming down Rainford bank he had but 100lb. of steam at Balcarres\r\nsiding, with steam shut off. He allowed the air pump to continue work,\r\nand in 400 yards his gauge rose to 140, when he opened his regulator\r\nagain to mount the incline with his heavy load, and so successfully\r\ngained the summit.” The annexed table shows the working of engine No.\r\n369, with and without the apparatus, and also of an exactly similar\r\nengine, No. 38, employed on the same length of line, and hauling the\r\nsame trains. No. 38 was not fitted with the apparatus.\r\n\r\n    ------------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n                            |            |   Coal     | Average lbs.\r\n            Engine.         | Miles run. | consumed.  |  per mile.\r\n    ------------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n                            |            | Tons. cwt. |\r\n    369 (without apparatus) |   21,948   |  403    6  |   42.92\r\n    369 (with apparatus)    |   27,934   |  472   10  |   37.89\r\n    38 (without apparatus)  |   28,053   |  550   10  |   43.95\r\n    ------------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\nAlthough the above glowing statement is made about this invention,\r\nwhich was fitted to no less than six engines, and tried for a period of\r\nabout five years, it was not found to be commercially successful, the\r\npower consumed in working the pump, and the cost of repairs running\r\naway with the economy supposed to have been gained in the original\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Furness Railway introduced a powerful design of\r\nsix-coupled tank engines. The cylinders were: Inside, 18in. diameter\r\nand 24in. stroke; heating surface tubes, 1,048 sq. ft.; fire-box, 96\r\nsq. ft.; grate area, 15 sq. ft. The frames were “inside.” The side\r\ntanks were capable of containing 1,000 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nWeight in working order: L., 13 tons 13 cwt.; D., 16 tons 6 cwt.;\r\nT., 14 tons 15 cwt.; total, 44 tons 14 cwt. On the level this class\r\nof engine hauled 372 tons at 20 miles an hour, and up an incline of\r\n1 in 80 a load of 367 tons was drawn at 11¾ miles an hour. The steam\r\npressure was 145lb., and the coal consumption 40.16lb. per mile.\r\n\r\nThe name of Patrick Stirling, the late locomotive superintendent of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, will long be remembered and held in high honour\r\namongst those of his _confrères_, consequent upon his successful design\r\nof 1870, in which year he built the first of his now world-famous 8ft.\r\n1in. singles, a type of locomotive which immediately leaped into public\r\nfavour, which for elegance and simplicity of design it is not saying\r\ntoo much in stating that no modern engine has surpassed or is likely to\r\nsurpass. These engines soon showed the travelling public that really\r\nexpress speed could be safely indulged in for continuous runs of great\r\nlength without fear of accident or failure. Indeed, modern express\r\nspeed can date its foundation from the introduction of these engines.\r\nThe Great Northern Railway undoubtedly owes its popularity and fame as\r\nthe “express” route to the successful running of Patrick Stirling’s\r\n8ft. 1in. outside cylinder “single” engines.\r\n\r\nThe following may be accepted as a correct description of the earlier\r\ntype of this locomotive design. Later engines of the same class have,\r\nin common with the development of locomotive design, increased in\r\nweight, grate, tube, and cylinder area, and steam pressure; but the\r\ngeneral outline to-day, as seen in Fig. 91, is the same as that of\r\n27 years ago, and we do not think this compliment can be paid to\r\nthe design of any other locomotive built at the present time. The\r\ncylinders were 18in. diameter, with a length of stroke of 28in. The\r\nsmall ends of the connecting-rods were furnished with solid bushes of\r\ngun metal. The inner and the outer fire-boxes were connected together\r\nby stays, screwed into each of the plates, without the intervention\r\nof iron girder bars. By this arrangement, which had been in use for\r\nsome time in Belgium, the large amount of deposit generally existing\r\nupon girder-boxes was prevented, the facility for cleansing was much\r\ngreater, and the liability of the tube holes in the copper-plate to\r\nbecome oval had been got rid of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—8FT. 1IN. “SINGLE” EXPRESS ENGINE, GREAT\r\nNORTHERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe heating surface in this engine was, in the tubes, 1,043, and in\r\nthe fire-box 122 sq. ft. The fire-grate had an area of 17.6 sq. ft.\r\nWhen the engine was in working order, the weights upon the driving,\r\ntrailing, and bogie wheels were 15, 8, and 15 tons respectively. The\r\ndistance from the centre of the trailing wheels to the centre of the\r\nbogie pin was 19ft. 5in. These engines were capable of drawing a weight\r\nof 356 tons on a level at a speed of 45 miles an hour, with a working\r\npressure of 140lb. to the sq. in. The consumption of coal, with trains\r\naveraging sixteen carriages of 10 tons weight each, had been 27lb. per\r\nmile, including getting up steam and piloting. The cost of maintaining\r\nand renewing passenger engines on the Great Northern Railway was in\r\n1873 estimated to amount to 2½d. per mile.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary type of engines on the “West Coast” route was the\r\ncelebrated “Precedent” class, illustrated by “John Ramsbottom” (Fig.\r\n92).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 92..—“JOHN RAMSBOTTOM,” ONE OF WEBB’S “PRECEDENT”\r\nCLASS, L. & N.W. RWY.]\r\n\r\nThese London and North Western Railway locomotives were constructed\r\nat the Crewe Works, from the designs of Mr. F. W. Webb, locomotive\r\nsuperintendent, the first of them being constructed in December, 1874.\r\nThe engines, as our readers well know, have four-coupled wheels, 6ft.\r\n6in. diameter, and a leading pair of wheels 3ft. 9in. diameter. The\r\nprincipal dimensions originally were—they may vary a little in some\r\ndetails in certain engines—inside cylinders, 17in. diameter, with a\r\nstroke of 24in. Heating surface, 980 sq. ft. in tubes, and 103.5 sq.\r\nft. in fire-box; grate area, 17.1 sq. ft.; weight in working order, L.,\r\n10 tons 5 cwt.; D., 11 tons 10 cwt.; T., 11 tons; total, 32 tons 15\r\ncwt. Steam pressure, 120lb.; wheel base, 15ft. 8in.\r\n\r\nThe most famous engine of this class is the “Charles Dickens,” No. 955,\r\nbuilt at Crewe in 1882; the “Inimitable” is shedded at Manchester, and\r\nthe daily journey to and from Euston consists of 366½ miles; the trains\r\nworked by this engine are the 8.30 a.m. up, and the 4 p.m. down. As\r\nlong ago as September 21st, 1891, the “Charles Dickens” had obtained\r\nthe premier position in engine mileage. On that day “she”—if the shades\r\nof “Boz” will allow the bull—completed her millionth mile, consisting,\r\nof 2,651 trips between Manchester and London, in addition to 92 other\r\njourneys. During this period of 9 years 219 days the engine had burned\r\n12,515 tons of coal. Up to the end of February, 1893, the total mileage\r\nof “Charles Dickens” amounted to 1,138,557, and up to the present time\r\nit has exceeded the enormous total of 1,600,000 miles!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—“FIREFLY,” A L. & S.W.R. OUTSIDE CYLINDER TANK\r\nENGINE]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1874, Mr. Webb introduced another type of locomotive for the\r\nLondon and North Western Railway: the “Precursor,” No. 2145, gives its\r\ntitle to the design in question.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders were 17in. by 24in. stroke. The leading wheels were\r\n3ft. 6in. diameter, whilst the driving and trailing wheels (coupled)\r\nwere 5ft. 6in. diameter. The tubes contributed 980 sq. ft., and the\r\nfire-box 94.6 sq. ft., of the heating surface. The weight in working\r\norder was 31 tons 8 cwt.\r\n\r\n“Firefly”, (Fig. 93) is one of the numerous six-wheel outside cylinder\r\ntank engines built from the designs of J. Beattie by Beyer, Peacock and\r\nCo. for the L. and S.W.R. between 1863 and 1875. The cylinders were\r\n15½in. by 20in. stroke, the leading wheels 3ft. 7¾in. diameter, and the\r\ncoupled wheels 5ft. 7in. diameter. The heating surface was 795.17 sq.\r\nft.; the weight, in working order, 34 tons 12 cwt. A number of these\r\nengines had the cylinder diameter increased to 16½in, and a tender\r\nadded by W. Adams in 1883. “Firefly” was built in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—“KENSINGTON,” A 4-COUPLED PASSENGER ENGINE,\r\nL.B. & S.C.R.]\r\n\r\n“Kensington” (Fig. 94), a L., B. and S.C. locomotive, was, in December,\r\n1872, rebuilt by Mr. Stroudley in the form illustrated. The cylinders\r\nwere 17in. by 24in. stroke; coupled wheels, 6ft. 6in. diameter; leading\r\nwheels, 4ft. 3in. diameter. In 1872, “Kensington” was domeless, that\r\nappendage being added later. This engine was originally a single\r\nengine, built by R. Stephenson and Co. in 1864. Altogether, this\r\nengine, like many individuals, has “played many parts.”\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a period in locomotive history when the engines to\r\nbe described are of comparatively modern construction, a very large\r\nproportion of them being still in work on the various lines of railway,\r\nand readers interested in such matters are probably acquainted with the\r\nparticulars of the locomotives. Under such circumstances, a detailed\r\nand particular account of each design would be rather wearisome,\r\ntherefore the general features of modern engines will be less fully\r\ndescribed. At the same time any uncommon points in their design or\r\nconstruction will be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe standard type of express passenger engines now used on the South\r\nEastern Railway has developed from a class introduced by Mr. J.\r\nStirling, when locomotive superintendent of the Glasgow and South\r\nWestern Railway.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 he constructed at the Kilmarnock Works an engine with a leading\r\nbogie and four coupled wheels of 7ft. diameter. The cylinders were\r\ninside, 18in. diameter and 26in. stroke. In this design, as in the\r\nlater type on the South Eastern Railway, the boiler was unprovided with\r\na dome, but in the latter the duplex safety valve is placed about the\r\ncentre of the boiler barrel, whilst on the Glasgow and South Western\r\nRailway engines it surmounts a flush top fire-box.\r\n\r\nMr. Stirling’s reversing apparatus is a very useful contrivance; it\r\nenables the driver to reverse his engine without the expenditure of any\r\nmuscular power. At first the new reversing gear was frequently mistaken\r\nfor the Westinghouse air-brake pumps. It consists of two vertical\r\ncylinders placed tandem fashion at the side of the boiler barrel. One\r\npiston-rod passes through both cylinders, and the pistons are attached\r\nto it; this rod is connected with the reversing apparatus. One cylinder\r\ncontains steam, the other oil. The duty of the latter is to prevent\r\nthe movement of the piston or rod. It will be understood that, since\r\nthe cylinder is quite full of oil, it is impossible for the piston and\r\nconnections to move unless the oil can pass from one side of the piston\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by a handle, which also actuates the valve of the\r\nsteam reversing cylinder so that when the steam is admitted into one\r\ncylinder to move the piston, the oil is at the same time permitted to\r\nflow through a valve to the other piston, and the reversing apparatus\r\nis worked.\r\n\r\nThe oil keeps the piston in any desired position. As soon as the oil\r\ncannot pass from one side of the piston face to the other, the gear is\r\nfirmly locked.\r\n\r\nMr. A. M. Watkin became locomotive superintendent of the South Eastern\r\nRailway in 1876, and he introduced a very pretty design of express\r\npassenger engines. Twenty engines of the type were constructed: Nos.\r\n259 to 268 by Sharp, Stewart, and Co., and Nos. 269 to 278 by the\r\nAvonside Engine Company. Inside frames were provided; the leading\r\nwheels were 4ft. and the four-coupled wheels 6ft. 6in. diameter. The\r\ncylinders were 17in. diameter and 24in. stroke. The weight in working\r\norder was 34½ tons; the total heating surface, 1,103½ sq. ft. The\r\nsplashers to the coupled wheels were of open-work design. The chimney\r\nwas of the rimless South Eastern pattern; a dome was provided on the\r\ncentre of the boiler barrel, and a duplex safety valve on the fire-box\r\ntop. A cab very much resembling the standard London and North Western\r\nRailway pattern was fitted to the engines.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these engines, as rebuilt by Mr. Stirling, remain in work\r\nat the present time; they are principally employed on the Mid-Kent\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Mr. Stroudley, the then locomotive superintendent of the\r\nLondon, Brighton and South Coast Railway, built the “Grosvenor” with\r\n6ft. 9in. single driving wheels, inside cylinders 17in. by 24in., and a\r\ntotal heating surface of 1,132 sq. ft. The “Stroudley” speed indicator\r\nwas fitted to this engine. On August 13th, 1876, the “Grosvenor”\r\nconveyed a train from Victoria to Portsmouth (87 miles) without a stop.\r\nThis was the first occasion on which such a trip had been performed;\r\nthe time taken was 110 minutes.\r\n\r\nNo other engine exactly similar to the “Grosvenor” was constructed; but\r\nin 1877 the “Abergavenny”—with 6ft. 6in. single drivers and cylinders\r\n16in. by 22in.—was built, and in 1880 the first of the “G” class of\r\nsingles was turned out at the Brighton Works. These also have single\r\ndriving wheels 6ft. 6in. in diameter, but the cylinders are 17in.\r\ndiameter, the stroke being 24in. The weight on the driving wheel is 13\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nAn interesting era in the evolution of the steam locomotive is at this\r\npoint arrived at—viz., the first really practical trial of compound\r\nengines, or the use of steam twice over for the purpose of propelling a\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Webb, the chief mechanical engineer of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway, is due the honour of introducing the compound system\r\non an extended scale in railway practice. Although 21 years have now\r\npassed since the premier attempt of giving the system a fair trial\r\non an English railway was made, it does not seem to have gained much\r\nfavour with English locomotive engineers. Indeed, at the present\r\ntime, excepting a few minor trials elsewhere, the London and North\r\nWestern Railway is the only company that constructs and uses compound\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\nMr. Webb employs the three-cylinder type of engine, which is an\r\nadaptation of the system introduced by M. Mallet on the Bayonne and\r\nBiarritz Railway. Three engines were built from Mr. Mallet’s design by\r\nSchneider and Co., Creusot, and were brought into use in July, 1876.\r\nIn these locomotives Mallet employed two outside cylinders, one being\r\n15¾in. and the other 9½in. diameter.\r\n\r\nMr. Webb uses three cylinders: an inside cylinder for the l.p. steam\r\nand two outside cylinders for the high-pressure steam. But at first\r\none of Trevithick’s old “single” engines was fitted up on Mallet’s\r\ntwo-cylinder plan. This was in 1878. The engine worked successfully for\r\nfive years on the Ashley and Nuneaton branch of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway, and thereupon Mr. Webb decided to construct compound\r\nengines on his three-cylinder system.\r\n\r\nThe first of such engines was the “Experiment.” Her outside h.p.\r\ncylinders were 11½in. diameter, the inside l.p. being 26in. diameter.\r\nJoy’s celebrated valve gear was employed to regulate the admission of\r\nsteam to the cylinders.\r\n\r\n“Webb” compounds have two pairs of driving wheels, but these are\r\nuncoupled, so that practically the engines are “singles.” Whether\r\nthe four driving wheels work well together, or whether, on the other\r\nhand, there exists a considerable amount of either slip or skidding is\r\nanother matter. The trailing pair of wheels is driven from the h.p.\r\ncylinders, and the middle pair from the inside or l.p. cylinder.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowen-Cooke, an authority on London and North Western Railway\r\nlocomotive practice, sums up the advantages of the “Webb” compound\r\nsystem under the five following heads:—\r\n\r\n1. Greater power.\r\n\r\n2. Economy in the consumption of fuel.\r\n\r\n3. The whole of the available power of the steam used.\r\n\r\n4. A more even distribution of the strains upon the working parts, and\r\nlarger bearing surfaces for the axles.\r\n\r\n5. The same freedom of running as with a single engine, with the same\r\nadhesion to the rails as a coupled engine.\r\n\r\nThe 6ft. wheel type of London and North Western Railway compound was\r\nintroduced in 1884. The outside cylinders are 14in. and the inside\r\n30in. diameter, stroke 24in. Joy’s gear is used for all the valves;\r\nthe valves to the outside cylinders are below, and the valve of the\r\nl.p. cylinder is above the cylinder. The boiler steam-pressure is\r\n175lb. per square in., but it is reduced to 80lb. when entering the\r\nlow-pressure cylinder. The weight of the engine in working order is 42\r\ntons 10 cwt. Heating surface: Tubes, 1,242 sq. ft.; fire-box, 159.1 sq.\r\nft.; total, 1,401.5 sq. ft. Grate area, 20.5 sq. ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—“TEUTONIC,” A L. & N.W.R. “COMPOUND” LOCOMOTIVE\r\nON WEBB’S SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nAn engine built to this design—the “Marchioness of Stafford”—was\r\nexhibited at the London Inventions Exhibition of 1885, and gained the\r\ngold medal.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the first of the “Teutonic” (Fig. 95) class of 7ft. 1in.\r\ncompounds was constructed at Crewe Works. The leading wheels of this\r\ntype are 4ft. 1½in. diameter. Total weight in working order, 45 tons 10\r\ncwt. In these engines Mr. Webb’s loose eccentric motion is used for the\r\nlow-pressure inside cylinder, but Joy’s gear is retained for the h.p.\r\noutside cylinders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.—“QUEEN EMPRESS,” ONE OF WEBB’S COMPOUND\r\nLOCOMOTIVES, L. & N.W.R.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of compound is the “Greater Britain.” During 1897 the\r\n“Greater Britain” and other engines of the class were coloured red,\r\nwhite, and blue, and employed to haul the Royal train when travelling\r\nover the London and North Western Railway system. They were then\r\nnicknamed the “Diamond Jubilees.”\r\n\r\nThe special feature of this class is the length of the boiler, which is\r\ndivided into two portions by means of a central combustion chamber. The\r\nheating surface is: fire-box, 120.6 sq. ft.; combustion chamber, 39.1\r\nsq. ft.; front set of tubes, 875 sq. ft.; back set of tubes, 506.2 sq.\r\nft. total, 1540.9 sq. ft. The two pairs of driving wheels are located\r\nin front of the fire-box, and in addition there are a pair of leading\r\nand a pair of trailing wheels.\r\n\r\nAn engine of this class—the “Queen Empress” (Fig. 96)—was exhibited\r\nat the World’s Fair held at Chicago in 1893. Her leading dimensions\r\nare: Two high-pressure cylinders, 15in. diameter by 24in. stroke; one\r\nlow-pressure cylinder, 30in. diameter by 24in. stroke; wheels—driving,\r\n7ft. 1in. diameter (four in number); leading, 4ft. 1½in. diameter;\r\ntrailing, 4ft. 1½in. diameter. Weight on each pair of driving wheels,\r\n16 tons. Total weight of engine in working order, 52 tons 15 cwt. Total\r\nwheel base, 23ft. 8in. Centre to centre of driving wheels, 8ft. 3in.\r\n\r\nThe most recent type of compound goods locomotives constructed by\r\nMr. Webb has eight-coupled wheels, three pairs of which are located\r\nunder the fire-box, the trailing pair being close to the back of the\r\nfire-box. The outside cylinders are below the top of the frame-plate,\r\nand incline towards the rear. This type of engine was designed by Mr.\r\nF. W. Webb, chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Western\r\nRailway, principally for working the heavy mineral traffic over that\r\nCompany’s South Wales district, the first engine being built in 1893.\r\nThe wheels (all coupled) are 4ft. 5½in. in diameter, with tyres 3in.\r\nthick. The distance between the centres of each pair is 5ft. 9in., the\r\ntotal wheel base being 17ft. 3in. All the cylinders drive on to one\r\naxle—the second from the front of the engine; the two high-pressure\r\ncylinders are connected to crank pins in the wheels set at right angles\r\nto each other, the low-pressure cylinder being connected to a centre\r\ncrank-pin set at an angle of 135 degrees with the high-pressure cranks;\r\nthe high-pressure cylinders are 15in. diameter by 24in. stroke, and\r\nthe low-pressure cylinders are 30in. diameter by 24in. stroke. All\r\nthe cylinders are bolted together and in line, the low-pressure being\r\nplaced immediately under the smoke-box, and the high-pressure cylinders\r\non each side outside the frames, the steam chests being within the\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nThe engine weighs, in working order, 53 tons 18 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe empty weights are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                          Tons. Cwts.\r\n\r\n    Leading wheels         12    10\r\n    Driving wheels         14     8\r\n    Intermediate wheels    12    14\r\n    Trailing wheels         9    15\r\n                          ---------\r\n    Total (Empty)          47    47\r\n\r\nThe latest type of a passenger compound locomotive built by Mr Webb is\r\nthe 7ft. four-wheels-coupled engine “Black Prince” (Fig. 97), which was\r\nbuilt at the Crewe Works in July, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe engine has two high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders, all\r\nbeing in line, and driving on to one axle, the high and low pressure\r\ncranks being directly opposite each other.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of this engine is the method adapted for working\r\nthe valves, two sets of gear only being used for working the four\r\nvalves.\r\n\r\nJoy’s valve motion is used for the low-pressure valves, the valve\r\nspindles being prolonged through the front of the steam chest, and on\r\nthe end of the spindle a cross-head is fixed which engages with a lever\r\nof the first order, carried on a pivot firmly secured to the engine\r\nframe. The other end of this lever engages with a cross-head fixed\r\non the end of the high pressure valve spindle, and by this means the\r\nrequisite motion is given to the high pressure valve.\r\n\r\nThe leading end of the engine is carried on a double radial truck, the\r\ncentre of which is fitted with Mr. Webb’s radial axle-box and central\r\ncontrolling spring. This arrangement permits of 1in. side play, and\r\ngives greater freedom to the truck when passing round curves than is\r\npossible in the ordinary type of bogie with a rigid centre-pin.\r\n\r\nOne important object aimed at in the construction of this engine has\r\nbeen to get all the bearing surfaces throughout as large as possible.\r\nEach of the four journals in the radial truck is 6¼in. diameter and\r\n1Oin. long. The driving axle, in addition to the two ordinary bearings,\r\nwhich are each 7½in. diameter and 9in. long, has a central bearing\r\nbetween the two cranks, 7in. diameter and 5½in. long. In the trailing\r\naxle the journals are 7½in. diameter, by 13½in. long.\r\n\r\nThis engine made its first trip on August 2nd, 1897, and since then has\r\nbeen principally engaged in working the “up” dining saloon express,\r\nwhich leaves Crewe at 5.20 p.m., running through to Willesden without\r\na stop—a distance of 152½ miles—and returning the same night with the\r\nScotch sleeping saloon express, which leaves Euston at 11.50 p.m.,\r\nrunning through to Crewe without a stop, 158 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.—“BLACK PRINCE,” L. & N.W.R., A 4-COUPLED\r\n4-CYLINDER, COMPOUND ENGINE, WITH DOUBLE RADIAL TRACK]\r\n\r\nThe total distance run by this engine up to June 30th, 1898, was 52,034\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe high-pressure cylinders are 15in. diameter by 24in. stroke, and the\r\nlow-pressure cylinders are 20½in. diameter by 24in. stroke.\r\n\r\nThe heating surface is: Tubes, 1,241.3 sq. ft.; fire-box, 159.1 sq.\r\nft.; total 1,409.1 sq. ft. Grate area, 20.5 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nA concise survey of other compound locomotives will be of interest at\r\nthis juncture.\r\n\r\nMr. Wordsell, the then locomotive superintendent of the Great Eastern\r\nRailway, in 1882 built a compound engine, with two inside cylinders,\r\nthe h.p. 18in. and the l.p. 26in. diameter; the stroke was 24in.; steam\r\npressure, 160lb. per sq. in. The coupled wheels were 7ft. diameter. The\r\nengine was fitted with a leading bogie, the wheels of which were 3ft.\r\n1in. diameter; with her tender she weighed 77 tons in working order;\r\nher number was 230. A similar engine, No. 702, with Joy’s valve gear,\r\nwas built in 1885.\r\n\r\nMr. Wordsell also built a two-cylinder, six-coupled goods engine for\r\nthe Great Eastern Railway, on the compound principle. This was fitted\r\nwith the ordinary link motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Wordsell, upon his appointment as locomotive superintendent of the\r\nNorth Eastern Railway, introduced compound engines on that line. These\r\nwere provided with two cylinders, both inside, with the valves on top.\r\n\r\nThe h.p. cylinder is 18in. and the l.p. 26in. in diameter, the stroke\r\nbeing 24in. Mr. Worthington thus describes the North Eastern Railway\r\nstandard compound goods engine:—“In outside appearance this engine is\r\nneat, simple, and substantial. It weighs 40 tons 7 cwt., and has six\r\ncoupled 5ft. 1¼in. in diameter.\r\n\r\n“The cylinders are placed, as in the passenger compound engines,\r\nbeneath the slide-valves and inside the frames.\r\n\r\n“The chief features of this goods engine to be observed are the\r\nstarting and intercepting valves, which enable the engine-driver to\r\nstart the engine by admitting sufficient high-pressure steam to the\r\nlarge cylinder without interfering with the small cylinder, in case the\r\nlatter is not in a position to start the train alone.\r\n\r\n“The two valves are operated by steam controlled by one handle. If the\r\nengine does not start when the regulator is opened, which will occur\r\nwhen the high-pressure valve covers both steam ports, the driver pulls\r\nthe additional small handle, which closes the passage from the receiver\r\nto the low-pressure cylinder, and also admits a small amount of steam\r\nto the low-pressure steam chest, so that the two cylinders together\r\ndevelop additional starting power.\r\n\r\n“After one or two strokes of the engine the exhaust steam from the\r\nhigh-pressure cylinder automatically forces the two valves back to\r\ntheir normal position, and the engine proceeds working compound.”\r\n\r\nThe North Eastern Railway has other compound engines constructed on\r\nthe Wordsell and Van Borries system, a 6ft. 8¼in. four-coupled, with a\r\nleading bogie of locomotive, being turned out in 1886. Engines of this\r\ntype have a heating surface of 1,323.3 sq. ft., a grate area of 17.33\r\nsq. ft., and a working pressure of 175lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nAnother North Eastern Railway type of compound has 7ft. 6in. single\r\ndriving wheels and a leading bogie. The h.p. cylinder is 20in., and the\r\nl.p. 26in. diameter, compared with 18in. and 26in. in the four-coupled\r\nclass, the stroke being the same in each design—viz., 24in.\r\n\r\nThe first of the 7ft. 6in. compound class of locomotives was\r\nconstructed at the Gateshead Works in 1890. The engines of this design\r\nappear capable of doing very heavy work with a low coal consumption,\r\nthe average being 28lb. per mile, which, considering the heavy traffic\r\nand speed maintained, is low, being, in fact, 2lb. per mile below that\r\nof any other class of engine engaged on the same traffic.\r\n\r\nWith a train of 18 coaches, weighing 310 tons (including 87 tons, the\r\nweight of the engine and tender), a speed of 86 miles an hour was\r\nattained on a level portion of the road, the horse-power indicated\r\nbeing 1,068. These engines have a commodious cab, and the tenders\r\ncarrying 3,900 gallons of water, thus making it possible for the run of\r\n125 miles, from Newcastle to Edinburgh, to be performed without a stop.\r\nThere is also a class of six-coupled tank engines, with a trailing\r\nradial axle. The stroke is 24in., and the diameter of cylinders h.p.\r\n18in., and l.p. 26in. Compound engines have also been tried on the\r\nGlasgow and South Western Railway and on the London and South Western\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of express locomotives being fitted with leading bogies\r\nwere speedily recognised by most of the locomotive superintendents. Mr.\r\nS. W. Johnson, the Midland chief, introduced a design of such engines\r\nin 1876. The steam pressure of the early engines of this class was\r\n140lb., but in later years this was increased to 160lb., whilst in the\r\nrecent engines the pressure is still further augmented.\r\n\r\nThe same progress is to be noticed in the diameter of the cylinders of\r\nthe Midland engines, the diameter having increased from 17½in. in 1876\r\nto 19½in. at the present time. The size of the coupled wheels has also\r\nincreased from 6ft. 6in. to 7ft. 9in. The length of stroke has been the\r\nsame in all engines of this design—viz., 26in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—JOHNSON’S 7FT. 9IN. “SINGLE” ENGINE, MIDLAND\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe new Midland single express engines are illustrated by Fig. 98.\r\nThese locomotives have inside cylinders 19½in. diameter, with a stroke\r\nof 26in. The driving wheels are 7ft. 9in. in diameter. By standing on\r\na railway station platform alongside one of these engines, one gets a\r\ngood idea of their immense proportions, the abnormally high pitch of\r\nthe boiler being especially noticeable.\r\n\r\nMr. Stroudley, in his “Gladstone” class of engines for the London,\r\nBrighton and South Coast Railway, adopted an entirely opposite\r\npractice. His engines had the leading and driving wheels coupled,\r\nand a pair of smaller trailing wheels. The coupled wheels are 6ft.\r\n6in. diameter, and the trailing 4ft. 6in. diameter. The cylinders are\r\ninside, and measure 18¼1in. diameter, the stroke being 26in.\r\n\r\nThe reversing apparatus is actuated by means of compressed air,\r\nsupplied by the Westinghouse brake pump; whilst part of the exhaust\r\nsteam is projected against the flanges of the leading wheels, and upon\r\ncondensation upon the flanges forms a lubricant to the flange surface,\r\nwhen pressing against the inner sides of the rails. Fig. 99 is from a\r\nphotograph of “George A. Wallis,” an engine of the “Gladstone” class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.—“GEORGE A. WALLIS,” AN ENGINE OF THE\r\n“GLADSTONE” CLASS, L.B. & S.C.R.]\r\n\r\nThe “Tennant” (Fig. 100) class of express engines, on the North Eastern\r\nRailway, deserves mention, being the design of a general manager during\r\nthe North Eastern locomotive interregnum of 1885.\r\n\r\nThe engines have four-coupled wheels, 7ft. diameter, and a leading pair\r\nof small wheels, cylinders being 18in. diameter, and 24in. stroke.\r\n\r\nThe cab is somewhat similar to the Stirling pattern on the Great\r\nNorthern Railway.\r\n\r\nThe North British Railway engine, No. 592, was exhibited at the\r\nEdinburgh Exhibition of 1886, and Mr. Holmes, her designer, was awarded\r\nthe gold medal.\r\n\r\nThe driving and trailing wheels are coupled, their diameter being 7ft.\r\nThe fore part of the machine is supported on a four-wheeled bogie.\r\nThe symmetrical appearance of this and other North British Railway\r\nlocomotives is spoilt by having the safety valve located above the dome\r\ncasing. The cylinders are 18in. diameter, and 26in. stroke. No. 602,\r\nanother engine of this design, is notorious as being the first engine\r\nto cross the Forth Bridge, when formally opened by the Prince of Wales\r\non March 4th, 1890, the Marchioness of Tweeddale driving the engine\r\nupon the occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes, in 1890, introduced another very similar design of North\r\nBritish Railway engines, but with coupled wheels only 6ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter. These are known as the “633” class, illustrated by Fig. 101.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Great Eastern Railway, we have to chronicle some types\r\nof locomotives designed by Mr. Holden. The express passenger engines\r\nhave a pair of small leading wheels and four-coupled wheels of 7ft.\r\ndiameter, with cylinders 18in. by 24in. The valves are below the\r\ncylinders, which, by the way, are both cast in one piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.—“1463,” N.E.R., ONE OF THE “TENNANT”\r\nLOCOMOTIVES]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this design of locomotive, the triumph of skilled\r\nmechanism, combined with the application of scientific research,\r\ndeserves record, seeing that a troublesome waste product has been\r\nturned into a valuable calorific agent. We refer to the introduction of\r\nliquid fuel for locomotive purposes, as carried out under Mr. Holden’s\r\npatent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—HOLMES’S TYPE OF EXPRESS ENGINES FOR THE NORTH\r\nBRITISH RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nNow, sanitary authorities have large powers, and they are very fond of\r\nabusing these powers, and pushing matters to extreme issues—although at\r\ntimes, as we know from personal experience, they sometimes exceed their\r\nstatutory powers, and find themselves in a tight place from which they\r\ncan only retreat by payment of compensation and heavy law costs.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the pollution of streams the authorities have\r\nvery wide powers, and when they found the waters of the never clear\r\nor limpid Channelsea and Lea were further polluted by some oily,\r\niridescent matter, with a pungent odour, the sanitary inspectors were\r\nsoon ferreting out the offenders. The waste products from the Great\r\nEastern Railway oil-gasworks at Stratford were found to be responsible\r\nfor the nuisance, and the service of a notice requiring immediate\r\nabatement of the same was the result of the discovery.\r\n\r\nMr. Holden, remembering the good old proverb, “Necessity is the mother\r\nof invention,” soon commenced to experiment with the matter which the\r\nsanitary authorities refused to allow to be emptied into the already\r\nimpure waterways under their jurisdiction. The result of a series\r\nof trials on, first a six-coupled tank engine, and then on a single\r\nexpress, was a four-coupled express engine on the G.E.R., No. 760,\r\nnamed “Petrolea.”\r\n\r\nThis locomotive was constructed in 1886, and in general appearance is\r\nsimilar to the four-coupled express engine just described. The heating\r\narrangements are, however, supplemented by the liquid fuel burning\r\napparatus, which may be briefly described as follows: The oil fuel is\r\ncarried on this engine in a rectangular tank of 500 gallons capacity,\r\nbut in later examples occupies two cylindrical reservoirs, which\r\ncontain 650 gallons, placed on the top of the tender water-tanks, one\r\non each side.\r\n\r\nThe liquid fuel is supplied to these reservoirs through man-holes at\r\nthe foot-plate end. The feed-pipes from these tanks unite on the tender\r\nfoot-plate at the centre, and from this junction the oil is conveyed by\r\nthe flexible hose pipe to the engine, where the supply is again divided\r\nto feed the two burners situated on the fire-box front just under the\r\nfootboard.\r\n\r\nBoth the liquid in the tanks and the injected air are heated before\r\nuse, the former by means of steam coils in the tanks, and the latter\r\nby coiled pipes in the smoke-box. The heated liquid fuel and air are\r\ninjected into the fire-box, through two nozzles in the form of fine\r\nspray, steam being injected at the same moment through an outer ring of\r\nthe same nozzles. The steam divides the mixture of air and liquid into\r\nsuch fine particles that it immediately ignites when in contact with\r\nthe incandescent coal and chalk fire already provided in the fire-box.\r\nThe fire-box is fitted with a brick arch deflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—7FT. SINGLE ENGINE, G.E.R., FITTED WITH\r\nHOLDEN’S LIQUID FUEL APPARATUS]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the apparatus is controlled by a four-way cock fitted on\r\nthe fire-box case, near the position usually occupied by the regulator.\r\nThe positions of the cock in question are: (1) steam to warm coils in\r\nliquid fuel tank; (2) steam to ring-blowers on injectors; (3) steam to\r\ncentre jets of ejectors; and (4) steam to clear out the liquid fuel\r\npipes and ejectors. The success of “Petrolea” was so apparent and\r\nunquestionable that Mr. Holden’s patent system of burning liquid fuel\r\nwas immediately fitted to other Great Eastern Railway locomotives, with\r\nthe result that at the present time a number are fitted with his patent\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe following Great Eastern Railway locomotives have been fitted to\r\nburn liquid fuel:—\r\n\r\n     9 four-wheel coupled express engines.\r\n     6 single express engines. (Fig. 102)\r\n     1 six-wheel coupled goods engine.\r\n     1 six-wheel coupled tank, and\r\n    20 four-wheel coupled bogie tanks.\r\n\r\nand the 10 engines of the new class of “single” bogie expresses. (Fig.\r\n103.)\r\n\r\nThe application of the “Serve” corrugated tube has also been introduced\r\non the Great Eastern Railway in connection with the liquid fuel. The\r\ngoods engine and also two of the express passenger engines have the\r\n“Serve” tubes. The experiment of burning liquid fuel has been very\r\nsuccessful, only 16lb. of oil having been consumed per mile run,\r\nagainst an average of 35lb. of coal per mile, with coal-fired engines.\r\n\r\nSome very handsome Bogie Single Express Locomotives have recently been\r\nbuilt at the Stratford Works of the G.E.R. Company to the designs of\r\nMr. James Holden. They have been specially constructed for running the\r\nfast Cromer traffic. The boiler has a telescopic barrel 11ft. long,\r\nin two plates, and is 4ft. 3in. diameter outside the smaller ring.\r\nIt contains 227 tubes 1¾in. external diameter, and the height of its\r\ncentre line above the rail level is 7ft. 9in.\r\n\r\nThe fire-box is 7ft. long, and 4ft. ½ in. wide outside, and has a grate\r\narea of 21.37 sq. ft., and is fired with oil fuel. The total heating\r\nsurface is 1,292.7 sq. ft., the tubes giving 1,178.5 sq. ft., and the\r\nfire-box 114.2 sq. ft. The working pressure is 160 lbs. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nThe driving wheels are 7ft., the bogie wheels are 3ft. 9in., and the\r\ntrailing wheels 4ft. diameter. The total wheel base is 22ft. 9in., the\r\nbogie wheels centres being 6ft. 6in. apart, from centre of bogie pin to\r\ncentre of driving wheel is 10ft. 6in., and from centre of driving wheel\r\nto centre of trailing is 9ft. The total length of engine and tender,\r\nover buffers, is 53ft. 3in.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are 18in. diameter by 26in. stroke, the distance between\r\ncentres being 24in. The slide-valves are arranged underneath, and are\r\nfitted with a small valve, which allows any water that may collect in\r\nthe slide-valve to drain off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.—“No. 10,” THE LATEST TYPE OF G.E.R. EXPRESS\r\nENGINE, FIRED WITH LIQUID FUEL]\r\n\r\nSteam sanding apparatus is fitted at front and back of the driving\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nMacallan’s variable blast pipe is used, the diameter of the pipe being\r\n5¼in., and of the cap 4¾in.\r\n\r\nThis variable pipe is being adopted on all the Company’s engines. The\r\npipe has a hinged top, operated from the foot-plate. When the hinged\r\ntop is on the pipe, the area is that of a suitable ordinary pipe, and\r\nwhen the top is moved off the area is about 30 per cent. larger.\r\n\r\nIt is found that a large proportion of the work of the engines can be\r\ndone with the larger exhaust outlet, the result being a reduced back\r\npressure in the cylinders and also a reduced vacuum in the smoke-box,\r\nand less disturbance of the fire and consequent saving of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe tender is capable of carrying 2,790 gallons of water, 715 gallons\r\nof oil fuel, and 1½ tons of coal. It is provided with a water scoop for\r\nreplenishing the tank whilst running.\r\n\r\nThe weights of the engine and tender in working order are: engine, 48½\r\ntons; tender, 36 tons; total, 84½ tons.\r\n\r\nThe oil-firing arrangements embody a number of ingenious details, among\r\nthem the supply of hot air for combustion from a series of cast-iron\r\nheaters placed around the inside of the smoke-box, the air being drawn\r\nfrom the front through the heaters to the burners for the exhausting\r\naction of the steam-jets used for injecting the oil fuel. The latter\r\nis warmed before leaving the tender in a cylindrical heating chamber,\r\nthrough which the exhaust steam from the air-brake pump circulates.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the oil supply is effected by a neatly designed gear\r\nattached to the cover and hood of the ordinary fire-door, and finally\r\nthe burners or injectors are so constructed that should one require\r\ncleaning, inspection, or renewal, the internal cones can all be removed\r\nfrom the casing by simply unscrewing one large nut. These engines have\r\npolished copper chimney tops, and are painted and lined in the standard\r\nG.E.R. style, and fitted with the Westinghouse automatic brake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Modern L.B. and S.C.R. locomotives—Four-coupled in front\r\n        passenger tank—Six-coupled tank with radial trailing\r\n        wheels—Goods engines—“Bessemer,” four-coupled bogie\r\n        express—“Inspector”—Standard L.C. and D.R. passenger\r\n        engines—Goods locomotives—Three classes of tanks—Cambrian\r\n        locomotives, passenger, goods, and tank—S.E. engines—A\r\n        “Prize Medal” locomotive—Stirling’s goods and tank\r\n        engine—His latest type of express engines—Adams’\r\n        locomotives on the L. & S.W.R.—Mixed traffic\r\n        engines—Passenger and six-coupled tanks—Drummond’s\r\n        “Windcutter” smoke-box—His four-cylinder express\r\n        engine—North British passenger locomotives—Engines for the\r\n        West Highland Railway—Holme’s goods and tank engines—His\r\n        latest express type of engine—Classification of N.B.R.\r\n        locomotives—N.B.R. inspection or cab engine—L. and Y.\r\n        locomotives—Aspinall’s water “pick-up” apparatus—Severe\r\n        gradients on the L. and Y. system—7ft. 3in. coupled\r\n        expresses—“A” class of goods engines—Standard tank\r\n        engines—L. and Y. oil-burning tank locomotives—Caledonian\r\n        Railway engines—Drummond’s famous “Dunalastairs”—Excelled\r\n        by his “Dunalastairs 2”—Six-coupled “condensing” tender\r\n        engines—“Carbrooke” class—Dimensions of 44 types of\r\n        Caledonian locomotives\r\n\r\nThe modern engines on the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway are\r\ndesigned by Mr. Billinton, and comprise—\r\n\r\nThe four-coupled in front tank with a trailing bogie, of which\r\n“Havant,” No. 363, is an example. This engine was built at Brighton\r\nWorks, 1897. Inside cylinders, 18in. by 26in.; diameter of coupled\r\nwheels, 5ft. 6in. diameter. Heating surface, 1,189 sq. ft. Steam\r\npressure, 160lb. Weight in working order, 47 tons.\r\n\r\n“Watersfield,” No. 457, built at Brighton in 1895, is a specimen of the\r\nsix-coupled goods tank engines, with radial trailing wheels. This class\r\nhave inside cylinders, 18in. by 26in.; heating surface, 1,200 sq. ft.;\r\ndiameter of wheels, 4ft. 6in.; steam pressure 160lb.; weight in working\r\norder, 51 tons.\r\n\r\nNo. 449 represents the six-coupled goods tender engines, built by\r\nVulcan Foundry Co. in 1894, from Mr. Billinton’s designs.

Fig.\r\n104 is from a photograph of “Goldsmith,” an engine of this class.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this short description of the London, Brighton, and\r\nSouth Coast Railway locomotives, attention must be called to the\r\ncombined engine and carriage named “Inspector,” No. 481 (Fig. 105).\r\nThis engine was constructed in 1869 by Sharp, Stewart, and Co., as an\r\nordinary four-coupled passenger tank, and rebuilt in its present form\r\nsome 11 years or so ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—“GOLDSMITH,” ONE OF THE NEW L.B. & S.C.R.\r\nEXPRESS PASSENGER ENGINES]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are inside, 10½in. diameter, 16in. stroke; coupled\r\nwheels, 4ft. diameter; weight in working order, about 20 tons; steam\r\npressure, 120lb. In addition to the coupled wheels there are also a\r\npair of leading and a pair of trailing wheels. There is no steam dome,\r\nand the side tanks are as long as the boiler barrel, being extended on\r\neach side to the smoke-box. The inspection car is fixed on to the back\r\nof the coal bunker, its floor is some distance below the level of the\r\nengine frames, and the car is entered from a platform at the end, which\r\nis in turn entered from the outside by steps on either side, as in a\r\ntram-car. The back of the platform is quite open, whilst the partition\r\ndividing the platform from the enclosed portion of the car is glazed,\r\nso that anyone sitting with his back to the coal bunker can see the\r\npermanent-way, etc., over which “Inspector” has just passed without\r\nleaving his seat if necessary. There is a speaking tube, to enable\r\nthose in the saloon to communicate with the driver.\r\n\r\nA special form of indicator board, not used for any other train, is\r\ncarried by “Inspector”—viz., a white board with black horizontal\r\nstripes.\r\n\r\nThe modern locomotives of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway are\r\nbuilt from designs prepared by Mr. William Kirtley, the Company’s\r\nlocomotive superintendent. The main line passenger engines (Fig. 106)\r\nare of the M3 class, and have the following dimensions:—\r\n\r\n    Cylinders, 18in. diameter, 26in. stroke;\r\n    Coupled wheels, 6ft. 6in. in chamber;\r\n    Bogie     ”     3ft. 6in.    ”\r\n    Heating surface: tubes, 1,000.2 sq. ft.; fire-box, 110 sq. ft.\r\n    Grate area, 17 sq. ft.; working pressure, 150lb.\r\n    Weight, in working order, 42 tons 9 cwt., of which the driving\r\n        and trailing coupled wheels support 28 tons 18 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.—“INSPECTOR,” LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST\r\nRY.]\r\n\r\nThe standard tender, for both goods and passenger engines, is carried\r\non six wheels, and, loaded, weighs 34 tons; accommodation is provided\r\nfor 4¾ tons of coal, and 2,600 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nThe standard goods engines have six-coupled wheels, 5ft. in diameter.\r\n\r\n    Cylinders, 18in. by 26in .;\r\n    Heating surface: tubes, 1,000.4 sq. ft.; fire-box, 102 sq. ft.;\r\n        working pressure, 150lb. per sq. in.;\r\n    Weight, in working order: leading 13 tons 2 cwt.; driving, 15 tons\r\n        4½ cwt.; trailing, 10 tons 19½ cwt.; total, 39 tons 6 cwt.\r\n\r\nThese engines are known as “Class B2.”\r\n\r\nThe tank engines consist of three classes.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of those for working the main line and suburban services\r\nare as follows:—\r\n\r\nInside cylinders, with an incline of 1 in 10, 17in. diameter; 24in.\r\nstroke. Wheels, four-coupled in front, 5ft. 6in. diameter. A trailing\r\nbogie with 3ft. wheels. Heating surface: tubes, 971.7 sq. ft.;\r\nfire-box, 99.3 sq. ft.; grate area, 16¼ sq. ft. Tank capacity, 1,100\r\ngallons of water, 2 tons of coal. Weight, in working order, 49 tons 15\r\ncwt. Steam pressure, 150lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nThese engines are officially described as Class R.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—“No. 192,” ONE OF THE STANDARD EXPRESS\r\nPASSENGER LOCOMOTIVES, LONDON, CHATHAM AND DOVER RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe A class of bogie tank engines were specially designed for working\r\nthrough tunnels. The inside cylinders are 17½in. diameter, and 26in.\r\nstroke. The coupled (leading and driving) wheels are 5ft. 6in.\r\ndiameter, the wheels of the trailing bogie being 3ft. in diameter. The\r\nheating surface is made up as follows: Tubes, 995 sq. ft.; fire-box,\r\n100 sq. ft.; grate area, 16½ sq. ft.; working pressure, 150lb.; water\r\ncapacity of tanks, 970 gallons; fuel space, 80 cubic ft.; weight, in\r\nworking order, 51 tons.\r\n\r\nAll of these engines are fitted with steam condensing apparatus to\r\nallow of working over the Metropolitan Railway between Snow Hill and\r\nKing’s Cross and Snow Hill and Moorgate Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—STANDARD EXPRESS PASSENGER ENGINE, CAMBRIAN\r\nRAILWAYS]\r\n\r\nClass T comprises the goods or shunting tanks. These have six-coupled\r\nwheels of 4ft. 6in. diameter, with a wheel bore of 15ft. The cylinders\r\nare inside, with a 17in. diameter and 24in. stroke. The heating surface\r\nis as follows: Tubes, 799.3 sq. ft.; fire-box, 88.7 sq. ft.; grate\r\narea, 15 sq. ft.; steam pressure, 150lb.; tank capacity, 830 gallons;\r\ncoal bunker, 48 cubic ft.; weight, in working order, 40¾ tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 these shunting engines were fitted with the Westinghouse\r\nAutomatic Brake, which is the continuous brake adopted by the London,\r\nChatham and Dover Railway.\r\n\r\nIn general outline the modern locomotives on the Cambrian Railways are\r\nsimilar to those of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway.\r\n\r\nThe express passenger engines (Fig. 107) on the Cambrian Railway have\r\na leading bogie, with wheels 3ft. 6in. diameter, and four coupled\r\nwheels of 6ft. diameter. The inside cylinders are inclined 1 in 15, and\r\nare 18in. diameter, and 24in. stroke. The heating surface is: Tubes,\r\n1,057 sq. ft.; fire-box, 99½ sq. ft.; grate area, 17 sq. ft. There are\r\n230 tubes, 10ft. ⁵/₁₆th in. long, and 1¾in. diameter. The wheel base\r\nis: Centre to centre of bogie, 5ft. 6in.; leading to trailing, 7ft.;\r\ncentre of bogie to driving, 9ft. 3½in.; and driving to trailing, 8ft.\r\n3in.; Boiler pressure, 16lb. per sq. inch. These engines have underhung\r\nsprings to the driving and trailing wheels, are fitted with a steam\r\nsanding apparatus, the vacuum brake, screw reversing gear, and other\r\nimprovements. They were built by Sharp, Stewart, and Co., Atlas Works,\r\nGlasgow, the particular one we have described having been turned out in\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nThe modern goods engines numbered 73 to 77 were built by Neilson and\r\nCo., Glasgow, in 1894, the maker’s numbers being 4,691 to 4,695. The\r\nsix-coupled driving wheels are 5ft. 1½in. diameter; the wheel base\r\nbeing: leading to driving, 7ft. 5in.; driving to trailing, 7ft. 10in.\r\nThe springs to all the wheels are underhung, the driving wheel springs\r\nbeing of Timmis’ patent design. Steam sanding apparatus is provided in\r\nfront of the leading wheels. The cylinders are inside, and are inclined\r\n1 in 10. The boiler barrel is 10ft. 3in. long, and contains 204 tubes\r\nof 1¾in. diameter; the heating surface being: tubes, 986.2 sq. ft.;\r\nfire-box, 98.3 sq. ft.; fire-grate area, 16½ sq. ft.; working pressure,\r\n160lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nThe tenders have six wheels, 3ft. 10in. diameter, with a wheel base of\r\n12ft., equally divided. Water capacity, 2,500 gallons; coal space, 200\r\ncubic ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.—STANDARD PASSENGER TANK ENGINE, CAMBRIAN\r\nRAILWAYS]\r\n\r\nThe above dimensions are those of the Cambrian Railways modern standard\r\ntender, and apply both to the passenger and goods engines.\r\n\r\nThe bogie passenger tank engines (Fig. 108) have inside cylinders,\r\n17in. diameter, 24in. stroke, inclined 1 in 9. The coupled wheels\r\n(leading and driving) are 5ft. 3in. diameter, the bogie wheels being\r\n3ft. 1½in. diameter. The boiler barrel is 10ft. 2¾in. long, and\r\ncontains 134 tubes of 2in. diameter, and 38 tubes of 1¾in. diameter\r\nBoiler pressure, 160lb. per sq. inch. Heating surface: Tubes, 920.1 sq.\r\nft.; fire-box, 90 sq. ft.; grate area, 13.3 sq. ft. The tanks contain\r\n1,200 gallons of water, and the bunkers 2 tons of coal. The total\r\nwheel base is 20ft. 1in., the coupling side-rods being 7ft. 8in. long.\r\nWeight, in working order, 45 tons 9 cwt. 3 qrs.\r\n\r\nThese engines were built by Nasmyth, Wilson, and Co., Ltd., Bridgewater\r\nFoundry, near Manchester.\r\n\r\nMr. James Stirling, the present locomotive superintendent of the South\r\nEastern Railway, soon after his appointment, took steps to thoroughly\r\nrenovate and classify the various types of locomotives on the system.\r\n\r\nHe has now succeeded in doing so; indeed, save for a few 6ft. D. and\r\nT. coupled, of Cudworth’s design, now rebuilt without a dome, and the\r\nsix-wheel four-coupled express engines built during the short Watkin\r\nlocomotive _régime_, and now rebuilt by Mr. Stirling, nearly every\r\nengine on the South Eastern Railway is from Mr. Stirling’s own designs.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that Mr. James Stirling, like his brother, the\r\nlate Patrick Stirling, of Great Northern Railway fame, does not believe\r\nin a steam dome. Another feature of resemblance in their designs is\r\ndiscovered in the style of cab. Patrick favoured a brass encased safety\r\nvalve, located on the top of the fire-box; whilst James chooses the\r\nboiler barrel for the position of that useful feature in a locomotive,\r\nwhich he, however, constructs after the Ramsbottom type.\r\n\r\nThe modern South Eastern Railway engines all have inside cylinders, and\r\nMr. Stirling’s excellent reversing gear previously described. They may\r\nbe divided into the following classes:—\r\n\r\n    Four-wheels coupled bogie express engine—of two sets of dimensions.\r\n    Four-wheels coupled bogie passenger engine.\r\n    Four-wheels coupled bogie tank engine.\r\n    Six-wheels coupled goods engine.\r\n    Six-wheels coupled shunting tank engine.\r\n\r\nThe standard express class of engines was introduced about 15 years\r\nago, and the locomotives were then painted black, but fortunately for\r\ntheir appearance, Mr. Stirling has recently reverted to the South\r\nEastern Railway colour obtaining before his appointment as locomotive\r\nsuperintendent, and the newer engines are now painted a pleasing tint\r\nof olive green. “No. 240” (Fig. 109), an engine of this class, was\r\nexhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, and obtained the Gold Medal.\r\n\r\nThe leading dimensions are: Cylinders, 19in. diameter, 26in. stroke\r\n(incline 1 in 30); leading bogie wheels, 3ft. 9in. diameter; wheel\r\nbase of bogie, 5ft. 4in.; driving and trailing wheels (coupled), 7ft.\r\ndiameter; wheel base of coupled wheels, 8ft. 6in. The driving wheels\r\nhave Timmis’s springs; the trailing wheels underhung laminated springs.\r\n\r\nThe tender is carried on six wheels of 4ft. diameter, with a wheel\r\nbase of 12ft., equally divided. The tender tank holds 2,650 gallons of\r\nwater, and the coal capacity is 4 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—“No. 240,” THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY ENGINE\r\nTHAT OBTAINED THE GOLD MEDAL AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION, 1889]\r\n\r\nWeight, in working order: on bogie, 13 tons 12 cwt.; driving wheels, 15\r\ntons 18 cwt.; on trailing wheels, 13 tons; tender. L., 10 tons 6 cwt.;\r\ncentre, 10 tons 1 cwt.; T., 10 tons 3 cwt.; total weight of engine and\r\ntender, 73 tons.\r\n\r\nFrom the above description it will be seen that these locomotives are\r\nfinely proportioned and should be capable of doing excellent service.\r\nThey are good for hauling heavy loads, and the “direct” line viâ\r\nSevenoaks has some severe gradients, which these engines negotiate in\r\nfine style.\r\n\r\nAnother point in their favour is the coal consumption, the average\r\nbeing low, although the fuel is of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe speed, however, of the fast trains is disappointing. Probably it is\r\nnot right to blame the engines for this, but rather the timing of the\r\ntrains.\r\n\r\nWhilst other railways are accelerating their services, the South\r\nEastern Railway retrogrades in the matter of speed.\r\n\r\nYet there is not a finer length of line in the kingdom for showing what\r\nan engine can do than that between Redhill and Folkestone, or leaving\r\nthe main line at Ashford and on to Ramsgate. For many miles these\r\ntracks are practically straight and level; but no advantage is taken of\r\nthe circumstances so far as speed is concerned; hence travellers are\r\napt to blame the locomotives. These probably have never had a chance to\r\nshow what speed they are capable of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.—STANDARD GOODS ENGINE, SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nMr. Stirling’s other class of bogie tender engines is very similar\r\nin appearance to the one just described, but of smaller dimensions.\r\nThe engines now to be described were first constructed some years\r\nbefore the 7ft. coupled expresses; indeed, soon after Mr. Stirling\r\nwas appointed locomotive superintendent. They are principally used\r\nfor working the passenger trains on the North Kent line (London to\r\nMaidstone).\r\n\r\nCylinders, 18in. by 26in. (incline 1 in 15); bogie wheels, 3 ft. 8in.\r\ndiameter; wheel base, 5ft. 4in.; driving and trailing wheels (coupled),\r\n6ft. 0½in. diameter (wheel base, 8ft. 2in.); springs and framing\r\nsimilar to the 7ft. class; tender wheels, 3ft. 8in. diameter; wheel\r\nbase, 12ft., equally divided; water capacity, 2,000 gallons; coal, 3\r\ntons. Weights in working order: on bogie, 12 tons 12 cwt.; driving\r\naxle, 14 tons 2 cwt.; trailing, 11 tons 5 cwt.; tender, L., 8 tons\r\n12 cwt.; centre, 8 tons 2 cwt.; T., 9 tons; total weight (engine and\r\ntender), 63 tons 13 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe tender goods engines (Fig. 110) have six wheels (coupled) of 5ft.\r\n2in. diameter; cylinders, 18in. by 26in. (incline 1 in 9); wheel base,\r\nL. to D., 7ft. 4in.; D. to T., 8ft. 2in. The tenders are of similar\r\ndimensions to the 6ft. passenger engines, with 100 gallons additional\r\nwater capacity. Weights in working order: engine, L., 12 tons 2 cwt.;\r\nD., 15 tons 3 cwt.; T., 11 tons. Tender, L., 9 tons 5 cwt.; C., 9 tons\r\n1 cwt.; T., 9 tons 17 cwt.; total (engine and tender), 64 tons 18 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.—STANDARD PASSENGER TANK LOCOMOTIVE, S.E. RWY.]\r\n\r\nThe four-wheels-coupled bogie tanks (Fig. 111) have the leading and\r\ndriving wheels coupled; these are 5ft. 6in. diameter; cylinders,\r\n18in. by 26in. (incline 1 in 9); trailing bogie, with wheels, 3ft.\r\n9in. diameter; side water-tanks, capacity, 1,050 gallons; coal bunker\r\ncapacity, 30 cwt.; wheel base, L. to D., 7ft. 5in.; D. to bogie centre,\r\n11ft. 11in.; bogie wheel base, 5ft. 4in. Weight in working order: L.,\r\n13 tons 17 cwt.; D., 16 tons; bogie, 18 tons 16 cwt.; total, 48 tons 13\r\ncwt.\r\n\r\nThe above is a capital type of passenger tank engine, of which the\r\nSouth Eastern Railway possess a large and increasing number. They are\r\nmostly constructed by Glasgow firms, whilst the tender engines are\r\nbuilt at Ashford Works.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar type of bogie tanks, fitted with condensing\r\napparatus, and used for working the through South Eastern trains over\r\nthe Metropolitan Railway to the Great Northern Railway. Some of these\r\nengines were also used for hauling the South Eastern trains through the\r\nThames Tunnel, when the through service between Croydon (Addiscombe\r\nRoad) and Liverpool Street was in operation. For this purpose they were\r\nfitted with a short funnel, to enable them to clear the Thames Tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe illustration (Fig. 112) shows Mr. Stirling’s latest type of express\r\nengine for the South Eastern Railway, the first of which commenced to\r\nwork at the end of July, 1898. Several differences of detail compared\r\nwith Mr. Stirling’s previous South Eastern Express engines are\r\nintroduced. The more noticeable are the large bright brass stand upon\r\nwhich the safety valves are mounted, the improvement in the shape of\r\nthe cab on the engine, whilst the sides of the tender are painted in\r\ntwo panels, with the Company’s coat of arms between (Mr. Stirling, it\r\nwill be observed, has not slavishly copied other practice in lettering\r\nthe tenders S.E.R.); the springs are below the frames, and steps at the\r\nback are provided on either side of the tender.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the wheels and cylinders, the stroke, and wheel base\r\nremain the same. The tender is a trifle longer, making the total length\r\nover buffers 52ft. 8in., instead of 52ft. 4in. The working pressure\r\nis now 170lb. per sq. in., there being 215 tubes of 1⅝in. external\r\ndiameter, 10ft. 4½in. long. The other differences in the dimensions are\r\ntabulated below:—\r\n\r\n           “440” Class,                                “240” Class,\r\n           illustrated                                 illustrated\r\n           by FIG. 112.                                by FIG. 109.\r\n\r\n    Rail level to centre of Boiler    7ft. 10in.              7ft. 5in.\r\n    Total Heating Surface          1,100 sq. ft.         1,020½ sq. ft.\r\n\r\n    To top of Chimney is 13ft. 4in. in both classes,\r\n         the new Engines having Funnels 2in. shorter.\r\n\r\n     Weight loaded—\r\n\r\n                  ENGINE.

Mr. Stirling is to be\r\ncongratulated upon the appearance of the machines.\r\n\r\nThe standard engines now in work on the London and South Western\r\nRailway were constructed from the designs of Mr. Adams, the late\r\nlocomotive superintendent, who resigned about three years ago. Mr.\r\nD. Drummond, who succeeded Mr. Adams, has built several new types of\r\nengines, viz., large bogie tank engines, six-wheels-coupled goods\r\nengines, four-wheels-coupled bogie express engines, as well as a\r\n“four-cylinder” engine, which latter is decidedly a new departure in\r\nLondon and South Western Railway practice. The most important of Mr.\r\nAdams’ designs can be classified thus:\r\n\r\n    Four-coupled bogie express engine and tender.\r\n    Four-wheels-coupled in front, mixed engine and tender.\r\n    Six-wheels-coupled goods engine and tender.\r\n    Four-wheels-coupled bogie tank engine; and\r\n    Six-wheels-coupled bogie shunting tank engine.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of four-wheels-coupled bogie passenger engines,\r\nboth of the same design, but of different dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe appended table will show the variations in the two classes:\r\n\r\n     (A) = Design No.                   (H) = Heating Surface Tubes.\r\n     (B) = Cylinders.

A notable feature in the design is the distance\r\nthe frames project in front of the smoke-box. The style of cab is also\r\nvery neat.\r\n\r\nA great feature in Mr. Adams’ later engines was his patent vortex blast\r\npipe, the introduction of which very considerably reduced the coal\r\nconsumption of the locomotives fitted with the invention.\r\n\r\nThe mixed traffic engines have inside cylinders, 18in. diameter,\r\n26in. stroke, leading and driving wheels (coupled) 6ft. diameter, and\r\ntrailing wheels 4ft. diameter, underhung springs and compensation beams\r\nto the coupled wheels; steam pressure, 160lb. The heating surface and\r\ngrate area are similar to the “26” design. Tractive force on rails,\r\n11,700lb. Tender capacity the same as “43” design.\r\n\r\nThe six-coupled goods engines have inside cylinders, 17½in. diameter,\r\n26in. stroke; wheels, 5ft. 1in. diameter; steam pressure, 140lb.;\r\nunderhung springs; boiler barrel, 10ft. 6in. long, 4ft. 4in. diameter;\r\nfire-box, 5ft. 10in. long, 5ft. high. The smoke-box front inclines,\r\nso that the box is wider at the base than at the top, as is the case\r\nwith the London and North Western goods engines. There are 218 tubes of\r\n1¾in. external diameter; the heating surface being: tubes, 1,079 sq.\r\nft.; fire-box, 108 sq. ft.; grate area, 17.8 sq. ft. Tractive force on\r\nrails, 10,442lb.; water capacity of tender, 2,500 gallons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.—ADAMS’S STANDARD EXPRESS ENGINE, LONDON AND\r\nSOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe suburban and other short distance passenger traffic is performed\r\nby tank engines, having the leading and driving wheels coupled, and\r\na trailing bogie. The cylinders are inside, 18in. diameter, 26in.\r\nstroke; coupled wheels, 5ft. 7in. diameter; bogie wheels, 3ft.\r\ndiameter; heating surface and grate area the same as in the “26” class\r\nand the mixed traffic engines already described. Steam pressure, 160lb.\r\nper sq. in.; fuel space of bunkers, 80 cubic ft.; water capacity of\r\ntanks, 1,200 gallons. Tractive force on rails, 12,573lb.\r\n\r\nThe six-wheels-coupled shunting tanks are altogether of smaller\r\ndimensions, the cylinders being 17½in. diameter, and having a 24in.\r\nstroke wheels, 4ft. 10in. diameter; boiler barrel, 9ft. 5in. long and\r\n4ft. 2in. diameter, containing 201 tubes of 1¾in. external diameter.\r\nThe heating surface is: tubes, 897.76 sq. ft.; fire-box, 89.75 sq. ft.;\r\nthe fire-box is 5ft. long and 4ft. 9in. high, the grate area being\r\n13.83 sq. ft.; the steam pressure, 160lb. Tractive force on rails,\r\n12,672lb.; fuel capacity of bunker, 77½ cubic ft.; capacity of water\r\ntanks, 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by F. Moore\r\n\r\nFIG. 114.—A “WINDCUTTER” LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE, “No. 136,” L. & S.W.R.,\r\nFITTED WITH A CONVEX SMOKE-BOX DOOR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.—DRUMMOND’S 4-CYLINDER ENGINE, LONDON AND SOUTH\r\nWESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe London and South Western Railway at one time had an extraordinarily\r\nlarge number of different designs of locomotives, and at the present\r\ntime the number of designs in use probably exceeds that on any other\r\nBritish railway, despite the fact that the older classes are being\r\nrapidly “scrapped,” although some of the very ancient types have in\r\nrecent years been rebuilt with new boilers. The older engines of\r\nBeattie design mostly have names, but this practice, unfortunately,\r\nhas been disregarded by recent London and South Western Railway\r\nlocomotive superintendents, save in the case of one tank engine, named\r\n“Alexandra,” under special circumstances, and even this name has lately\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Drummond has become chief at Nine Elms, two at least of his\r\ninnovations deserve notice. One is an experiment with a windcutter\r\nsmoke box door (Fig. 114), constructed in the belief that the wind\r\nresistance is thereby decreased. In addition to the tender engine 136\r\nbeing so fitted, this form of convex smoke-box door is fitted to a L.\r\nand S.W.R. tank engine, and also to some of the tender goods engines.\r\n\r\nAnother type of engine, designed by Mr. Drummond, that has attracted\r\nconsiderable attention, is the four-cylinder engine (Fig. 115), built\r\nat Nine Elms at the end of 1897. This engine is supported on four\r\ndriving wheels (uncoupled) of 6ft. 7in. diameter, and a leading bogie.\r\nJoy’s valve gear is used for the outside cylinders; all the cylinders\r\nare 15in. diameter; the stroke is 26in. A very large heating surface,\r\nincluding the water tubes in the fire-box, amounting to 1,700 sq. ft.,\r\nis provided. The steam pressure is 175lb. per sq. in. The tender is\r\ncarried on two four-wheel bogies, and carries 4,300 gallons of water.\r\nThe motion is reversed by means of a steam apparatus. A portion of the\r\nexhaust steam is discharged at the back of the tender.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive works of the North British Railway are situated at\r\nCowlairs, Glasgow, and Mr. M. Holmes is the present locomotive\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nOriginally the North British Railway works were located at St.\r\nMargaret’s, near Edinburgh, but when the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway\r\nwas amalgamated with the North British, in 1865, the Cowlairs works of\r\nthe former were chosen as the locomotive headquarters of the Company.\r\n\r\nConsiderable power is required to work the trains over the North\r\nBritish system, as not only are the trains heavy, but many are run at a\r\ngood speed, whilst steep gradients are not unknown.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, surprising that “single” engines should be absent\r\nfrom the locomotive stock.\r\n\r\nThe passenger engines are mostly of the four-coupled leading bogie\r\ntype. (Fig. 116).\r\n\r\nThe principal passenger engines have the coupled wheels of 6ft. 6in.\r\nand 7ft. diameter, both with cylinders 18in. by 26in. The steam\r\npressure is 140lb. usually, but some of the engines are credited with\r\nan additional 10lb. per sq. in.\r\n\r\nThe other dimensions are:\r\n\r\n                                7FT. WHEELS.   6FT. 6IN. WHEELS.\r\n    Heating Surface Tubes       1,007 sq. ft.    1,148 sq. ft.\r\n    Fire-box                      119   ”          118   ”\r\n    Grate Area                     22   ”           20   ”\r\n    Weight in Working order    45 tons 5 cwt.   46 tons 10 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe driving wheels of both sizes have a weight of 15 tons 12 cwt. upon\r\nthem. The tenders weigh 32 tons, and hold 5 tons of coal and 2,500\r\ngallons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.—FOUR-COUPLED PASSENGER ENGINE WITH LEADING\r\nBOGIE, N.B.R.]\r\n\r\nEngines of these classes work the East Coast expresses between\r\nEdinburgh and Berwick, 57 miles 42 chains. The booked time is 72\r\nminutes, but the runs are frequently performed under the hour; indeed,\r\na train has been timed from start to stop in 57 minutes 21 seconds, on\r\nthe journey up from Edinburgh to Berwick.\r\n\r\nFor working the West Highland Railway Mr. Holmes designed a class of\r\nfour-coupled bogie engines of exceptional power. The coupled wheels are\r\nonly 5ft. 7in. in diameter; cylinders, 18in. diameter, 24in. stroke;\r\nheating surface tubes, 1,130.41 sq. ft.; fire-box, 104.72 sq. ft.;\r\ngrate area, 17 sq. ft.; steam pressure, 150lb. per sq. in.; weight of\r\nengine in working order, 43 tons 6 cwt., of which 14½ tons rest on the\r\ndriving axle.\r\n\r\nThe tender is similar to that previously described.\r\n\r\nGoods engines are very numerous on the North British Railway, the most\r\nmodern ones being known as the “18in. standard” type. These have six\r\ncoupled wheels of 5ft. diameter; cylinders, 18in. by 26in. stroke;\r\nheating surface tubes, 1,139.96 sq. ft.; fire-box, 107.74 sq. ft.;\r\ngrate area, 17 sq. ft.; weight in working order, 40 tons 13 cwt., of\r\nwhich 15 tons 8 cwt. are supported by the driving wheels. The tender is\r\nof the usual type. Other goods engines have cylinders 17in. diameter,\r\nwith 26in. stroke.\r\n\r\nThe short distance passenger traffic is worked by four classes of tank\r\nengines, one type of which is very similar to the London, Brighton,\r\nand South Coast “terriers,” though of larger dimensions. These have\r\ncylinders 15in. by 22in., coupled wheels, 4ft. 6in. diameter, tanks to\r\nhold 600 gallons of water, and weigh 33½ tons in working order. Another\r\nclass of bogie tank has coupled wheels 5ft. in diameter, a leading\r\nbogie with solid wheels 2ft. 6in. diameter, cylinders 16in. by 22in.\r\nstroke. These engines originally condensed the exhaust steam, but the\r\nusual practice is now followed, and the exhaust is used as a blast for\r\nincreasing the draught.\r\n\r\nThe two other classes of tank engines have the following dimensions:\r\n\r\n    494 Class: Cylinders, 17in. by 26in.; diameter of driving wheels,\r\n    6ft.; water capacity, 950 gallons; coal, 30 cwt.; weight,\r\n    47 tons 4 cwt.\r\n\r\n    586 Class: Cylinders, 17in. by 24in.; diameter of driving wheels,\r\n    5ft. 9in.; water capacity, 1,281 gallons; coal, 50 cwt.; weight,\r\n    50 tons 7 cwt.\r\n\r\nThere is a handy little type of saddle tanks, known as “shunting pugs.”\r\nThese run on four (coupled) wheels of 3ft. 8in. diameter; they have\r\noutside cylinders, 14in. diameter and 20in. stroke. The wheel base\r\nis 7ft.; weight in working order, 28 tons 15 cwt.; water capacity of\r\nsaddle tank, 720 gallons.\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes’ latest type of express engines for the N.B.R. (Fig. 117)\r\nhas a working pressure of 175lb. per sq. in. The principal dimensions\r\nbeing: Cylinders, 18¾in. diameter by 26in. stroke. Wheels: Bogie,\r\n3ft. 6in. diameter; driving and trailing, 6ft. 6in. diameter; wheel\r\nbase, 22ft. 1in.; centre of bogie to centre of driving wheels, 9ft.\r\n10in.; centre of driving to centre of trailing wheels, 9ft.

It is not, therefore, surprising to find\r\nthat the Horwich works are quite equal to all, and exceed many other,\r\nof the railway establishments in the matter of modern machine tools,\r\nand in the general completeness of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nMr. J. A. F. Aspinall is chief mechanical engineer of the Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire Railway, and under his supervision the locomotive stock\r\nof the railway has been raised to a degree of excellence seldom\r\nequalled and never exceeded.\r\n\r\nThis position has been attained because Mr. Aspinall has always shown\r\na determination to introduce the best features of all kinds into his\r\nlocomotive designs. The Joy valve gear is very extensively employed\r\nin the construction of Lancashire and Yorkshire locomotives, and has\r\nalways given excellent results on that line.\r\n\r\nFor many years past the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway has adopted\r\nthe Ramsbottom system of water-tanks, while the pick-up apparatus is\r\nactuated by a vacuum arrangement patented by Mr. Aspinall. The water\r\ntroughs are situate at nine different places on the system—viz:—\r\n\r\n                                                           Register No.\r\n    Horbury Junction: East end of Horbury Junction Station      3\r\n    Hoscar Moss: Between Hoscar Moss and Burscough Bridge       7\r\n    Kirkby: Between Kirkby and Fazakerly                        5\r\n    Lea Road: Between Lea Road and Salwick                      6\r\n    Rufford: Between Rufford and Burscough North Junction       8\r\n    Smithy Bridge: West end of Smithy Bridge Station            1\r\n    Sowerby Bridge: West end of Sowerby Bridge Tunnel           2\r\n    Walkden: Between Moorside and Wardley and Walkden           4\r\n    Whittey Bridge: West end of Whittey Bridge Station          9\r\n\r\nVery severe gradients are to be found on the Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\nRailway, many stretches of 1 in 50, between which rate of inclination\r\nand that of 1 in 100 very many banks exist, some of which are of\r\nconsiderable length; whilst from Baxenden to Accrington the line falls\r\n1 in 40 for two miles at a stretch, and at the same rate for 1¼ miles,\r\nfrom Padiham Junction to Padiham Station, and also for 1¾ miles at 1 in\r\n40 from Hoddlesden Junction to Hoddlesden. From Britannia to Bacup the\r\ngradients are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Fall 286 yards,   1 in 61.\r\n    Fall 550 yards,   1 in 35.\r\n    Fall 154 yards,   1 in 70.\r\n    Fall 1,056 yards, 1 in 34.\r\n\r\nBut this bank is even eclipsed in severity by the Oldham incline of 1\r\nin 27 for three-quarters of a mile. All these stiff banks are worked by\r\nlocomotive engines without the help of stationary engines.\r\n\r\nEvery train which leaves Victoria Station, Manchester, in an eastward\r\ndirection, has to start off by ascending a serious incline of 1 in 77,\r\nfollowed by another of 1 in 65, round a sharp S curve, on its way to\r\nNewton Heath, or else to ascend gradients towards Miles Platting of 1\r\nin 59 and 1 in 49.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—FOUR-WHEELS-COUPLED, SADDLE TANK ENGINE,\r\nLONDON AND NORTH WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe locomotive stock consists of 1,333 engines. Of this number, 590 are\r\nof the standard types described below as being of the three leading\r\ntypes designed by Mr. Aspinall. The balance is made up mainly of\r\nengines of older forms, which are gradually being replaced with engines\r\nof the standard type, though a large number of these engines have been\r\naltered so as to require a boiler of one type only.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive sheds of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway are\r\nsituate and numbered as below:—\r\n\r\n    Newton Heath, No. 1; Low Moor, No. 2; Sowerby Bridge, No. 3;\r\n    Leeds, No. 4; Mirfield, No. 5; Wakefield, No. 6; Normanton, No. 7;\r\n    Barnsley, No. 8; Knottingley, No. 9; Goole, No. 10; Doncaster,\r\n    No. 11; ——, No. 12; Agecroft, No. 13; Bolton, No. 14;\r\n    Horwich, No. 15; Wigan, No. 16; Southport, No. 17; Sandhills,\r\n    No. 18; Aintree Sidings, No. 19; Bury, No. 20; Bacup, No. 21;\r\n    Accrington, No. 22; Burnley, No. 23; Skipton, No. 24; Lower\r\n    Darwen, No. 25; Hellifield, No. 26; Lostock Hall, No. 27; Chorley,\r\n    No. 28; Ormskirk, No. 29; Fleetwood, No. 30; Blackpool (Talbot\r\n    Road), No. 31; and Blackpool (Central), No. 32.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118A.—STANDARD EXPRESS PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE,\r\nLANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to describe some of the types of Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe “H” or Standard class of four-wheels coupled passenger engines is\r\nillustrated by engine No. 1,093 (Fig. 118A). The cylinders are inside,\r\nand the axles also have the bearings inside. The principal dimensions\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    Cylinders, 18in. diameter by 26in. stroke.\r\n    Bogie wheels, 3ft. 0½in. diameter.\r\n    Coupled wheels (driving and trailing), 7ft. 3in. diameter.\r\n    Wheel base, 21ft. 6½in.\r\n    Centre of bogie to centre of driving wheel, 10ft. 2½in.\r\n    Centre of driving to centre of trailing wheel, 8ft. 7in.\r\n    Weight loaded (bogie), 13 tons 16 cwt.\r\n      ”      ”  (driving), 16 tons 10 cwt.\r\n      ”      ”  (trailing), 14 tons 10 cwt.\r\n    Total, 44 tons 16 cwt.\r\n    Boiler, 4ft. 2in. diameter, 10ft. 7⅜in. long.\r\n    Fire-box, 6 ft. long, 4ft. 1in. wide, 5ft,. 10in. high.\r\n    Number of tubes, 220.\r\n    Tubes (outside diameter), 1¾in.\r\n    Heating surface, tubes, 1,108.73sq. ft.\r\n       ”       ”   fire-box, 107.681sq. ft.\r\n    Total, 1,216.41sq. ft.\r\n    Fireg-rate area, 18.75sq. ft.\r\n    Pressure of steam per sq. inch, 160lbs.\r\n    Weight of 6-wheel tender, loaded, 26 tons 2 cwt. 2 qrs.\r\n    Capacity of water-tank of tender, 1,800 gallons.\r\n    Fuel capacity of tender, 3 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—STANDARD 8-WHEEL PASSENGER TANK ENGINE, L. &\r\nY.R.]\r\n\r\nThe “A” or standard class goods engines have cylinders, boilers,\r\nheating surface, steam pressure, etc., the same as the “H” class of\r\npassenger engines just described; whilst a similar pattern of tender is\r\nemployed, the six-coupled wheels are 5ft. 1in. diameter; the wheel base\r\nis: L. to D., 7ft. 9in.; D. to T., 8ft. 7in.; total, 16ft. 4in. Weight\r\nin working order: L., 13 tons 16 cwt. 2 qr.; D., 15 tons; T., 13 tons 6\r\ncwt. 2 qr.; total, 42 tons 3 cwt.\r\n\r\nTank engines are employed to work the trains between Manchester and\r\nBlackburn, a distance of 24½ miles, of which 13 miles are on rising\r\ngradients, and six on falling gradients, most of them being steeper\r\nthan 1 in 100. The most serious gradients affecting the working of this\r\nline are those from Bolton up towards Entwistle, where, for a mile and\r\na quarter, the gradient is 1 in 72, and for the following 4½ miles is 1\r\nin 74; a more serious incline than the celebrated one over Shap Fell.\r\nThese tank engines are fitted with the water pick-up apparatus which\r\ncan be used when running either chimney or bunker in front. The trains\r\neach consist of thirteen coaches, which including the engine weigh\r\nabout 250 tons.\r\n\r\nThe engines (Fig. 119) have eight wheels—viz., a pair of leading\r\nradial, two pairs of coupled, and a pair of trailing radial. The\r\ncylinders are inside, and have 26in. stroke, the diameter being 18in.\r\nThe diameters of the wheels are:—\r\n\r\n    Radial, 3ft. 7¾in.\r\n    Coupled (driving and trailing), 5ft. 8in.\r\n    Wheel base, 24ft. 4in., divided as follows:—Front radial wheel to\r\n      centre of driving, 7ft. 10½in.; driving to rear coupled,\r\n      8ft. 7in.; rear coupled to trailing radial, 7ft. 10½in.\r\n    Weight loaded (leading radial wheel), 13 tons 10 cwt.\r\n      ”      ”    (driving), 16 tons 12 cwt.\r\n      ”      ”    (rear coupled), 15 tons 2 cwt.\r\n      ”      ”    (trailing radial), 10 tons 15 cwt.\r\n    Total, 55 tons 19 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.—OIL-FIRED SADDLE TANK SHUNTING ENGINE,\r\nLANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe boiler, fire-box, etc., dimensions are the same as the “H” class.\r\nThe tanks of these locomotives hold 1,340 gallons of water, and the\r\nbunkers two tons of coal.\r\n\r\nThe above three classes form the leading types of locomotives of Mr.\r\nAspinall’s designing. Fig. 120 illustrates a four-wheel-coupled saddle\r\ntank locomotive designed by Mr. Aspinall, and fired with oil, on\r\nHolden’s system. It is used for shunting at Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.—“DUNALASTAIR,” CALEDONIAN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nAt the present time the locomotives of the Caledonian Railway hold\r\nfirst place in the popular mind for speed and hauling capacity. This\r\nresult has been attained through the remarkable performances of the\r\nengines of the “Dunalastair” class, constructed at St. Rollox Works\r\nfrom the designs of Mr. J. F. McIntosh, the present locomotive\r\nsuperintendent of the Caledonian Railway.\r\n\r\nThese engines (Fig. 121) have been frequently described, but it is as\r\nwell to recapitulate the leading dimensions. The cylinders are inside,\r\n18¼in. diameter and 26in. stroke. The engine is supported by a leading\r\nbogie, and by four-coupled wheels of 6ft. 6in. diameter. The bogie\r\nwheel base is 6ft. 6in.; centre of bogie to driving wheel, 9ft. 11in.;\r\nD. to T., 9ft.; total length over buffers (engine and tender), 53ft.\r\n9¾in. The weight in working order is: Engine—bogie, 15 tons 14 cwt. 3\r\nqr.; D., 16 tons; T., 15 tons 5 cwt.; tender—L., 12 tons 13 cwt.; M.,\r\n13 tons 4 cwt.; and T., 13 tons 4 cwt. 2 qr.; total, 86 tons 1 cwt. 1\r\nqr.\r\n\r\nThe tractive force is 14,400lb. Water capacity of tender is 3,570\r\ngallons. The working pressure is 160lb. The leading feature of the\r\nengine consists of the large heating surface—viz., tubes, 1,284.45 sq.\r\nft., and fire-box, 118.78 sq. ft. To obtain this result the boiler has\r\nbeen “high pitched,” giving the engine a rather squat appearance, and\r\ncausing the driving wheels to appear to be of smaller diameter than is\r\nactually the case.\r\n\r\nAn extended cab is provided for the protection of the driver and\r\nfireman. The splendid work performed by these machines has frequently\r\nbeen chronicled, the principal feature being the daily run from\r\nCarlisle to Stirling, 118 miles, in 123 minutes, without a stop; this\r\ntrip includes the tremendous pull up the Beattock Bank, with a rise of\r\n650ft. in ten miles. Yet Sir James Thompson, the general manager of\r\nthe Caledonian Railway, said of this class of engine, “But, effective\r\nas it is, we are already improving upon it, and it will undoubtedly be\r\nsuperseded by our next type of engines.”\r\n\r\nAs Sir J. Thompson intimated, Mr. McIntosh improved upon the above\r\ntype, the result being the excellent “Dunalastair 2” (Fig. 123). These\r\nfine engines also are employed to haul the heavy West Coast corridor\r\ntrains between Carlisle and Glasgow, and Edinburgh and the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.—ONE OF McINTOSH’S FAMOUS “DUNALASTAIR 2,”\r\nCALEDONIAN RAILWAY EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVES]\r\n\r\nFrom Glasgow to Carlisle one of the engines hauls the 2.0 p.m. corridor\r\ntrain without a pilot throughout the journey, the weight of the train,\r\nexcluding passengers, luggage, and tender of engine, is upwards of 350\r\ntons. The dimensions are: wheels, 6ft. 6in., D. and T. coupled, with\r\nleading bogie; cylinders 19in. by 26in. Tender runs on two four-wheel\r\nbogies; water capacity, 4,125 gallons. The weights on wheels are as\r\nfollows: engine—bogie, 16 tons 6 cwt.; driving wheels, 16 tons 17 cwt.;\r\ntrailing, 15 tons 17 cwt.—total, 49 tons. Tender: front bogie, 22 tons\r\n11¾ cwt.; hind bogie, 22 tons 6¼ cwt.—total, 45 tons. Total weight of\r\nengine and tender in working order, 94 tons. Total length over buffers\r\n(engine and tender), 57ft. 3¾in.; tractive force, 16,840lb.; working\r\npressure, 175lb. per sq. in. Heating surface: tubes, 1,381.22 sq. ft.;\r\nfire-box, 118.78 sq. ft.—total, 1,500 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nBogie wheel base, 6ft. 6in.; centre of bogie to driving, 10ft. 11in.;\r\ndriving to trailing, 9ft.; distance between bogie centres of tender,\r\n11ft. 3in.; total tender wheel base, 16ft. 9in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.—SIX-WHEELS-COUPLED CONDENSING ENGINE,\r\nCALEDONIAN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nAnother new type of engine introduced by Mr. McIntosh has 5ft. 6in.\r\ncoupled wheels. It is a passenger-goods, or mixed traffic engine (Fig.\r\n123), for working goods, mineral and heavy passenger and excursion\r\ntrains through the Glasgow Central Underground Railway. Wheel base,\r\nL. to D., 7ft. 6in.; D. to T., 8ft. 9in.; cylinders, 18in. by 26in.;\r\nsix-wheeled tender; water capacity, 2,800 gallons.\r\n\r\nAnother good design of Caledonian Railway engines is the “Carbrook”\r\n(Fig. 124) class, constructed from Mr. D. Drummond’s specification with\r\na leading bogie, and four-coupled wheels of 6ft. 6in. diameter. The\r\nweight of these engines is: bogie, 14 tons 15 cwt.; D., 15 tons 4 cwt.;\r\nT., 15 tons; L., 10 tons 16 cwt. 2 qr.; M., 14 tons 6 cwt. 3 qr. Wheel\r\nbase: bogie, 6ft. 6in.; centre of bogie to D., 9ft. 1Oin.; D. to T.,\r\n9ft.; total length over buffers (engine and tender), 54ft. 6in. Water\r\ncapacity of tender, 3,560 gallons. The safety valve is located on top\r\nof the dome, an unsymmetrical practice which spoils the outline. There\r\nis also another type of Mr. Drummond’s engines, with cylinders, 18in.\r\nby 26in. stroke. Wheel base and water capacity as in the “Dunalastair”\r\nclass; but the weight and tractive force are dissimilar. The former, on\r\nbogie, is 14 tons 13 cwt. 2 qr.; D., 15 tons 7 cwt. 3 qr.; tender, L.,\r\n12 tons 13 cwt.; M., 13 tons 4 cwt.; T., 13 tons 4 cwt. 2 qr.; total,\r\n84 tons 6 cwt. 3 qr. The tractive force is 12,900lb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.—“CARBROOK,” ONE OF DRUMMOND’S EXPRESS ENGINES\r\nFOR THE CALEDONIAN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nTo give full details of all the 44 types of Caledonian Railway engines\r\nwould be rather wearisome to the reader, so of the remaining classes,\r\nparticulars only are appended:—\r\n\r\nPASSENGER ENGINES WITH TENDERS.\r\n\r\nDiameter of Driving Wheels:\r\n\r\n    5ft. 9in. four-coupled, with leading bogie.

The fire-box and roof slopes backwards,\r\nso that when the engine works bunker first up the incline, the water is\r\nlevel over the top of the fire-box. She is fitted with, two draw-bars\r\nfor attaching a wire rope. This rope is coupled to a low draw-bar under\r\nthe drag-plate, so as to keep the rope below the axles of the wagons,\r\nwhich follow the engine down the incline, or are pushed up before the\r\nengine. “143” has cast-iron “Sleigh” brakes acting on the rails, in\r\naddition to the usual steam brakes on the wheels. The dome is placed on\r\nthe fire-box, and the regulator is within it, so as to ensure dry steam\r\nwhen working on the incline. Wheels, 5ft. 3in. diameter. Cylinders,\r\n17½in. by 26in.

(I.)—Great Southern and Western\r\n        standard passenger design—A locomotive for an Irish “light”\r\n        railway.\r\n\r\nThe broad-guage having been finally abandoned on the G.W.R. in May,\r\n1892, it became necessary to re-arrange the locomotive power. Previous\r\nto that date Mr. W. Dean, the G.W.R. Locomotive Superintendent, had\r\nconstructed at Swindon several six-wheeled express locomotives (Fig.\r\n127), with “single” driving wheels, 7ft. 8in. in diameter, inside\r\ncylinders 20in. in diameter, and a stroke of 24in., and weighing 44\r\ntons 4 cwt., of which 13 tons 4 cwt. was on the leading axle.\r\n\r\nThis class of engine was designed to work the West of England expresses\r\nbetween London and Newton Abbot, consequent upon the conversion of\r\nthe gauge, and the locomotives were therefore built upon strictly\r\nnarrow-gauge dimensions, but some few of them were worked on the West\r\nof England expresses whilst the gauge was yet broad, and for this\r\npurpose the wheels were fixed outside the framing. In this condition\r\nthey had a very curious and ungainly appearance, intensified by the\r\nsquat chimney, large dome, and bulged fire-box covering.\r\n\r\nAfter the alteration of the gauge had been effected, and the wheels\r\nof the engines of this class had been fixed in their normal position,\r\ntheir appearance was considerably improved, but there still remained\r\nabout the locomotives a somewhat indescribable want of symmetry and\r\nunison of outline. However, it was decided to substitute a bogie for\r\nthe pair of leading wheels, whilst the diameter of the cylinders was\r\nreduced to 19 itches. These alterations, coupled with other minor\r\nimprovements, added to the admittedly good qualities of the engines as\r\nlocomotive machines, soon caused the class, thus improved, to gain a\r\nhigh place in the estimation of both experts and the railway public.\r\nThe amount of bright brass about the engines and the names carried by\r\nthem—mostly those of famous broad-gauge engines, or popular broad and\r\nnarrow-gauge, Great Western Railway officials—have also added to the\r\nprestige of the design. Let cynics say what they will, one feels more\r\ninterest for, say, the “Rover” than he can ever expect to for plain\r\n“No. 999.”\r\n\r\nThe adoption of water troughs on the Great Western Railway, and the\r\naddition of the “pick-up” apparatus to the tenders of these engines,\r\nenables the Great Western Railway to perform many daily runs for length\r\nand speed that, a few years back, would rightly have been considered\r\nquite phenomenal. Happily, we improve with giant strides in matters\r\nlocomotive at the tail end of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo F. Moore\r\n\r\nFIG. 127.—7FT. 8IN. “SINGLE” CONVERTIBLE ENGINE, GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of the normal gauge over the whole of the Great\r\nWestern Railway system, engines of this class are now used on the\r\nexpresses on all sections where the character of the gradients allows\r\nsuch engines to be run with proper economy. Under these circumstances,\r\nit is not surprising to learn that additional batches of engines of\r\nMr. Dean’s 7ft. 8in. “single” design (Fig. 128) are being added to the\r\nGreat Western Railway locomotive stock at not infrequent intervals.\r\nAt the present time, there are 71 of these engines at work, and nine\r\nothers under construction—probably a larger number of one class of\r\nmodern express locomotives than can be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.—“EMPRESS OF INDIA,” A STANDARD GREAT WESTERN\r\n7FT. 8IN. SINGLE EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nThe huge pipe for delivering the feed-water to the boilers of these\r\nengines, formerly placed in a conspicuous position, has been removed,\r\nan alteration that has added much to the beauty of outline of these\r\nfine-looking locomotives.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean has constructed a class of four-coupled engines, with a\r\nleading bogie, known as the “Armstrong” class. In its salient features,\r\nthe design is a modification of the 7ft. 8in. single class described\r\nabove, but naturally several of the dimensions are dissimilar in the\r\ntwo classes. “Armstrong” is No. 7, “Gooch” (Fig. 129), No. 8, “Charles\r\nSaunders,” No. 14, and “Brunel,” No. 16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.—“GOOCH,” A 4-COUPLED EXPRESS ENGINE, GREAT\r\nWESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nImmediately subsequent to the change of gauge in May, 1892, a class of\r\ntank engines, with wheels four-coupled in front and a trailing bogie,\r\nwas built for working the fast passenger traffic west of Newton Abbot.\r\nThe bogies of these engines were fitted with Mansel wheels—quite an\r\nexceptional practice in locomotive building.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean has since designed another class of locomotive to work the\r\nfast train traffic over the severe gradients and curves so common to\r\nthe Great Western Railway main line west of Newton Abbot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.—“PENDENNIS CASTLE,” ONE OF THE GREAT WESTERN\r\n“HILL CLIMBERS”]\r\n\r\nThese engines are popularly called the “Devonshire” or “Pendennis\r\nCastle” class (Fig. 130), after the name given to the first engine\r\nconstructed on the plan. A prominent feature of the design is the\r\n“extension” smoke-box—a feature copied from modern American practice.\r\nBefore constructing the “Pendennis Castle,” Mr. Dean had fitted another\r\nengine—No. 426—with an extended smoke-box, and the result of the\r\ntrials made with this locomotive satisfied the Great Western Railway\r\nlocomotive superintendent as to the advantages of the arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders of this class are 18in. diameter, the stroke being 26in.\r\nThe coupled wheels (D. and T.) are 5ft. 7½in. diameter, that of the\r\n(leading) bogie being 3ft. 7½in. The use of Mansel wheels has also\r\nbeen adopted both for the bogies and the tenders of the locomotives of\r\nthis class. The frames are double, and are specially contracted at the\r\nsmoke-box end to allow sufficient play to the bogie wheels. Both inside\r\nand outside bearings are provided for the driving axle. The boiler is\r\nof steel, the heating surface being: Tubes, 1,285.58 sq. ft.; fire-box,\r\n112.60 sq. ft.; steam pressure, 160lb.; grate area, 19 sq. ft.; weight\r\nof engine, 46 tons, of which 15 tons 7 cwt. is on the driving axle, 17½\r\ntons on the bogie, and 13 tons 3 cwt. on the trailing (coupled) axle.\r\nThe tender holds 2,000 gallons of water, and weighs, loaded, 24 tons.\r\nTen engines of this design were originally constructed at Swindon—viz.:—\r\n\r\n    3252 Duke of Cornwall.\r\n    3253 Pendennis Castle.\r\n    3254 Boscawen.\r\n    3255 Cornubia.\r\n    3256 Excalibur.\r\n    3257 Guinevere.\r\n    3258 King Arthur.\r\n    3259 Lizard.\r\n    3260 Merlin.\r\n    3261 Mount Edgcumbe.\r\n\r\nThese proved so satisfactory in performing the peculiar duties required\r\nfrom passenger engines on the West of England main line of the Great\r\nWestern Railway that a second batch of twenty was put in hand. These\r\ncommenced running in the early months of 1898. They are named and\r\nnumbered as follows:—\r\n\r\n    3262 Powderham.          3277 Earl of Devon.\r\n    3263 Sir Lancelot.       3278 Eddystone.\r\n    3264 St. Anthony.        3279 Exmoor.\r\n    3265 St. Germans.        3280 Falmouth.\r\n    3266 St. Ives.           3281 Fowey.\r\n    3267 St. Michael.        3282 Maristowe.\r\n    3268 Tamar.              3283 Mounts Bay.\r\n    3269 Tintagel.           3284 Newquay.\r\n    3270 Trevithick.         3285 St. Erth.\r\n    3271 Tre Pol and Pen.    3286 St. Just.\r\n    3272 Amyas.              3287 St. Agnes.\r\n    3273 Armorel.            3288 Tresco.\r\n    3274 Cornishman.         3289 Trefusis.\r\n    3275 Chough.             3290 Torbay.\r\n    3276 Dartmoor.           3291 Tregenna.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these engines have the tenders fitted with the water pick-up\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe names, it will be observed, should specially please the patrons of\r\nthe Great Western Railway residing in Devon and Cornwall, and help to\r\npalliate the keen regret with which the abolition of the broad-gauge\r\nwas felt in those counties.\r\n\r\nAmong types of Great Western locomotives, one may be mentioned—the 7ft.\r\n“singles” (Fig. 131), largely used for hauling the express trains on\r\nthe Birmingham and Northern lines. The cylinders are 18in. diameter,\r\nthe stroke being 24in. Heating surface, 1,250.31 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.—SINGLE EXPRESS ENGINE, 6-WHEEL TYPE, GREAT\r\nWESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nMany of the passenger trains on the Gloucester and Weymouth sections\r\nare worked by the 6ft. 6in. four-coupled engines, illustrated by engine\r\n2,202 (Fig. 132). The leading dimensions of this class are: Cylinders,\r\n17in. diameter; stroke, 24in.; heating surface, 1,363.5 sq. ft. Weight\r\nof engine and tender, in working order, 59 tons 8 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.—6FT. 6IN. 4-COUPLED PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE,\r\nGREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nNorth of Wolverhampton, for working the West to North expresses, and\r\nfor other fast trains in the North Western district of the G.W.R., the\r\nengines represented by 3,225 (Fig. 133) are largely used. This class\r\nhas cylinders 18in. by 24in. stroke; leading wheels 4ft. diameter,\r\nand coupled, driving, and trailing wheels, 6ft. diameter. The heating\r\nsurface totals to 1,468.82 sq. ft.; and the weight of engine and\r\ntender, including the load of 4 tons of coal and 3,000 gallons of\r\nwater, amounts to 74½ tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.—6FT. 4-COUPLED PASSENGER ENGINE, GREAT WESTERN\r\nRAILWAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.—“BARRINGTON,” NEW TYPE OF 4-COUPLED ENGINE,\r\nGREAT WESTERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\n“Barrington” (Fig. 134) is one of Mr. Dean’s latest type of express\r\npassenger engine. These powerful locomotives are somewhat of the\r\n“Devonshire” type, having an extended smoke-box, whilst the “Belpaire”\r\nfire-box is also introduced. In the framing, it will be noticed,\r\nearly G.W. practice is reverted to. The cylinders are 18in. by 26in.\r\nstroke. The bogie wheels are 4ft., and the coupled wheels 6ft. 8in. in\r\ndiameter. The engine weighs 51 tons 13 cwt.; the tender, with the same\r\namount of water and coal as “3,225” class, 32½ tons.\r\n\r\nA good deal of the G.W. passenger trains are hauled by smart little\r\nsix-wheel (four-coupled) tank engines, which are specially noted for\r\ngetting away quickly, and immediately attained high speeds. “No. 576”\r\n(Fig. 135) represents a coupled in front engine of this description,\r\nbut the more generally known Great Western Railway passenger tank\r\nengines have the driving and trailing wheels coupled; these are 5ft.\r\ndiameter, the cylinders being 16in. diameter by 24ft. stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.—4-COUPLED IN FRONT PASSENGER TANK ENGINE,\r\nG.W.R.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dean’s latest creation for the Great Western Railway is named “Bull\r\nDog,” No. 3,312, and the design will be known as the “Bull Dog” class.\r\nExcept that the bogie wheels have spokes, the wheels, framing, and\r\nmotion are similar to the “Devonshire” class (Fig. 130). The boiler\r\nis of gigantic proportions; the fire-box is of the Belpaire type, and\r\nprojects over the top and sides of the boiler barrel. The smoke-box\r\nis extended, and steaming reversing gear is employed, whilst another\r\nimprovement, Davies and Metcalfe’s patent exhaust steam injector, is\r\nfitted to the engine, and is being extensively adopted on Great Western\r\nRailway locomotives. The name-plates are on the sides of the fire-box;\r\nthe clack valves are below the boiler barrel, behind the smoke-box. The\r\ncab of the “Bull Dog” extends to the edge of the foot-plate, with a\r\ndoor in the front on the fireman’s side.\r\n\r\nBefore closing these remarks on modern Great Western Railway\r\nlocomotives, some description of No. 36 is necessary. Here again we\r\nhave an adaptation of American practice—a six-wheels-coupled engine,\r\nwith a leading bogie, and an extension, smoke-box. The cylinders are\r\ninside, 20in. diameter by 24in. stroke, with the steam chests below\r\nthem. The driving wheels are 4ft. 6in. diameter, the bogie wheels only\r\n2ft. 8in. diameter. All the wheels have outside bearings, and the\r\ndriving wheels have inside bearings in addition. The boiler contains\r\n150 “Serve” tubes of 2½in. diameter. The total heating surface is 2,385\r\nsq. ft.; steam pressure, 165lb.; grate area, 35 sq. ft. The weight is\r\nas follows: On bogie, 12 tons 6 cwt.; leading coupled wheels, 15 tons\r\n12 cwt.; driving wheels, 16 tons 11 cwt.; and trailing wheels, 15 tons\r\n1 cwt. Total weight of engine, 59½ tons; of tender, 32 tons; together,\r\n91½ tons. The tender is fitted with a water pick-up apparatus. This\r\nlocomotive has been employed in hauling goods trains for many months\r\npast, and it is stated to have hauled a train weighing 450 tons through\r\nthe Severn Tunnel—despite the severe gradients and length—in ten\r\nminutes, although for such a load two goods engines of the usual Great\r\nWestern design would be required, and they would take 18 minutes to\r\nperform the trip.\r\n\r\nConsequent upon the death of the late Mr. Patrick Stirling—one of the\r\nbest locomotive superintendents of his time—the directors of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway appointed Mr. H. A. Ivatt to the supreme command at\r\nDoncaster. Mr. Ivatt received his early training in the science of\r\nlocomotive construction at Crewe, and left the Great Southern and\r\nWestern Railway (Ireland), where he was locomotive superintendent, to\r\nsucceed Mr. P. Stirling on the Great Northern Railway.\r\n\r\nMr. Ivatt, having decided opinions of his own relative to locomotive\r\ndesign, soon set to work to introduce his ideas on the Great Northern\r\nsystem; so that after many years—more than two decades—of domeless\r\nlocomotives, Doncaster awoke one morning to find a Stirling 8ft.\r\n“single” fitted with a steam dome encased in a green-painted cover.\r\nIt was certainly a great surprise—the colour especially, for many had\r\nhoped to see bright brass—but those interested survived the shock, and\r\nwaited to see some engines of Mr. Ivatt’s design on the Great Northern\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nSeveral engines, with pronounced Ivatt features, were soon running,\r\nbut the main designs of all of them are cast after distinctly Stirling\r\nmodels, as they were already under construction at the time of Mr.\r\nIvatt’s appointment.\r\n\r\nIn the 1070 class (four-coupled, six-wheeled engines) we find that the\r\ndome and cab, amongst external signs, are the work of the new chief\r\nat Doncaster; whilst those of the 1073 design have his leading bogie,\r\nsplasher over the coupled-wheels, dome, and cab.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.—“No. 1312,” ONE OF MR. IVATT’S (1073) SMALLER\r\nCLASS OF 4-COUPLED BOGIE ENGINES FOR THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nComing to “No. 34,” a rebuilt 8ft. “single,” Mr. Ivatt is responsible\r\nfor the dome, cab, and safety valve casing, whilst in the 1206,\r\nsix-coupled saddle tanks, we again find the dome and new pattern valve\r\ncasing.\r\n\r\nReaders will notice that we have only referred to the apparent details\r\nthat are attributed to Mr. Ivatt, but, by reference to the appended\r\ntables of dimensions, they will find that several alterations that\r\ndo not so readily meet with notice have been made in other matters\r\nconnected with the Great Northern locomotives.\r\n\r\n6FT. 6IN.

The boiler centre\r\nstands 8ft. 3in. above the level of the rails. The cylinders are 18in.\r\ndiameter by 26in. stroke. The grate area is 23 sq. ft. As this engine\r\nis only just out of the Doncaster shops none of her performances have\r\nas yet been recorded, but if she prove as good as she looks the Great\r\nNorthern Railway will have a valuable addition to its already numerous\r\n“single” locomotives.\r\n\r\nAnd now, perhaps, may be ventured an opinion on Mr. Ivatt’s innovations\r\nin Great Northern locomotive practice. In the first place, from an\r\naesthetic point, there can be no two opinions that a dome greatly\r\nimproves the appearance of a locomotive, but one of bright brass is\r\ninfinitely superior to one covered with green paint. “To win the\r\neye is to win all,” and plenty of bright brass about a locomotive\r\nis certainly an attraction; a large amount of the popularity of the\r\nGreat Western engines is due to the fine display of brass. The same\r\nreason that causes us to prefer a brass dome makes us sorry to see\r\nthe Stirling brass casing of the safety valve give place to Mr.\r\nIvatt’s design. Green paint undoubtedly is a good thing, but then you\r\ncan have “too much of a good thing.” Again, a curved splasher for\r\ncoupled wheels, following the outlines of both wheels, looks much\r\nneater than the design used with Class 1073. The bogie is decidedly\r\nan improvement; so is an extended cab, but graceful outlines might be\r\nused in connection with the latter. Mr. Ivatt has certainly introduced\r\nsome decided improvements into the composition of the Great Northern\r\nRailway locomotives, but the _tout ensemble_ might be more pleasing;\r\na few alterations in matters of detail would give observers a more\r\nappreciative opinion of modern Great Northern Railway engines.\r\n\r\nNow water troughs are so much in fashion, it should not be difficult to\r\nfind suitable locations for them on the Great Northern system, and with\r\na double-bogie tank engine, with, outside cylinders, a 9ft. or larger\r\ndriving wheel, York ought to be reached in less than three hours from\r\nKing’s Cross, and without an intermediate stop. Will the 19th century\r\nsee such an achievement? We hope so, but fear to prophesy; its sands\r\nare almost run.\r\n\r\nThe Manson engines of the Great North of Scotland Railway deserve\r\nnotice. As long ago as 1878 and 1879 it was decided to place heavier\r\nand more powerful engines on that railway. The engines weighed 41\r\ntons 5 cwt. each, and the tender 28 tons 5 cwt. in working order. The\r\nworking pressure was 150lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Mr. Manson, who succeeded Mr. Cowan, got some six-wheel coupled\r\ninside cylinder tank engines from Kitson and Co., of Leeds. The\r\nfollowing are the principal dimensions, viz.:—\r\n\r\n    Cylinders                 16in. by 24in.\r\n    Coupled wheels            4ft. 6in. diameter.\r\n    Wheel base                13ft. 8in.\r\n    Tubes                               140—1¾in. external diameter.\r\n    Heating surface—Tubes                690sq. ft.\r\n    Heating surface—Fire-box              66sq. ft.\r\n                                         ----------\r\n           Total                          756sq. ft.\r\n    Working steam pressure              140lb. per sq. in.\r\n    Weight in working order             37 tons 7 cwts.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Messrs. Kitson and Co. also supplied some four coupled\r\npassenger engines, with leading bogie and a six-wheeled tender.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are “inside,” and the bogie is Kitson’s swing link type,\r\nwhich this Company has used since 1884. These engines were delivered\r\nwith a brick arch in the fire-box, but this was afterwards taken out\r\nand air-tubes put into the front and rear of the fire-box, so as to\r\nconsume the smoke. The principal dimensions are:—\r\n\r\n    Cylinders                              17½in. by 26in.\r\n    Coupled wheels                         6ft. 0in. diameter.\r\n    Bogie wheels                           3ft. 0in. diameter.\r\n    Tender wheels                          (6), 3ft. 9in. diameter.\r\n    Wheel base of engine                   20ft. 8in.\r\n    Wheel base of tender                   11ft. 0in.\r\n    Total wheel base of engine and tender  40ft. 3⅝in.\r\n    Tubes                                  189—1¾in. external diameter.\r\n    Heating surface—Tubes                     946sq. ft.\r\n    Heating surface—Fire-box                   90sq. ft.\r\n                                              -----------\r\n           Total                           1,036sq. ft.\r\n      Tank capacity                        2,000 gallons.\r\n      Working steam pressure               140lb. per sq. in.\r\n      Weight in working order—Engine        37 tons 2 cwts.\r\n       ”        ”       ”      Tender        29 tons 0 cwts.\r\n                                             ---------------\r\n           Total                             66 tons 2 cwts.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Mr. Manson brought out his engine with inside cylinders,\r\nhaving the valves placed on the top, which were of the balanced type\r\nintroduced by Mr. Cowan. The valves were driven by the ordinary\r\nStephenson link motion working on a rocking-shaft. In other respects\r\nthe engine very much resembled those just described, except that the\r\nengine and tender were coupled by a central bar and one solid central\r\nrolling block in place of side spring buffers.\r\n\r\n    The cylinders were 18in. by 26in.\r\n          and the coupled wheels 6ft. 0½in. diameter.\r\n    The engine weighed                     41 tons 9 cwts.\r\n    The tender weighed                     29 tons 0 cwts.\r\n                  In working order.\r\n    They were built by Messrs. Kitson and Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mr. Manson increased the capacity of the tender to 3,000\r\ngallons, and in doing this introduced a bogie tender. The tender was\r\ncarried on eight wheels 3ft. 9½in. diameter. The four trailing wheels\r\nwere fixed, and the four leading carried a bogie similar to that on the\r\nengine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.—“No. 100,” ONE OF THE “T” CLASS, 4-COUPLED\r\nPASSENGER ENGINES, GREAT NORTH OF SCOTLAND RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nThe wheel base of the tender was 16ft. 6in., and the weight in working\r\norder 38 tons. The engine for these tenders was the same as that just\r\ndescribed. These were built by Stephenson and Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 Mr. James Johnson, who succeeded Mr. Manson, designed some\r\nheavy bogie tank engines. They were four-wheels-coupled in front, with\r\ntrailing four-wheeled bogie. The valves were of the ordinary type,\r\nplaced between the cylinders, which were “inside.”\r\n\r\nThese engines were fitted with the brick arch, and since that time all\r\nthe Company’s engines have had the air-tubes removed, and brick arches\r\nfitted.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal dimensions:—\r\n\r\n    Cylinders                 17½in. by 26in.\r\n    Coupled wheels            5ft. 0in. diameter.\r\n    Bogie wheels              3ft. 0½in. diameter.\r\n    Fixed wheel base          7ft. 6in.\r\n    Bogie wheel base          5ft. 6in.\r\n    Total wheel base          22ft. 0in.\r\n    Tubes                     220—1¾in. external diameter.\r\n    Heating surface—Tubes        1,093.5sq. ft.\r\n      ”       ”      Fire-box      113.5sq. ft.\r\n                                 --------------\r\n           Total                 1,207.0sq. ft.\r\n\r\n    Grate area                18sq. ft.\r\n    Working steam pressure    165lb. per sq. in.\r\n    Tank capacity             1,200 gallons.\r\n    Bunker capacity           2 tons coal.\r\n    Weight in working order   53 tons 15 cwts.\r\n\r\n    Built by Neilson.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Mr. Johnson designed some inside cylinder passenger\r\nengines (Fig. 139), which had the same size of boiler as the bogie tank\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nThey had a four-wheeled bogie in front, and four-coupled driving\r\nwheels. The tender was on six wheels, and carried the same amount of\r\nwater as the bogie tenders previously described. Spring buffers are\r\nused between engine and tender. The principal dimensions are:—\r\n\r\n    Cylinders                                18in. by 26in.\r\n    Coupled wheels                           6ft. 1in. diameter.\r\n    Bogie wheels                             3ft. 9½in. diameter.\r\n    Tender wheels                            6—4ft. 1in. diameter.\r\n    Wheel base of engine                     21ft. 9½in.\r\n    Wheel base of tender                     13ft. 0in.\r\n    Total wheel base of engine and tender    43ft. 4½in.\r\n    Working pressure                         165 lb. per sq. in.\r\n    Weight in working order—Engine             43 tons 18 cwts.\r\n      ”         ”       ”    Tender             35 tons  0 cwts.\r\n                                                ----------------\r\n        Total                                   78 tons 18 cwts.\r\n\r\n    Built by Neilson and Co.\r\n\r\nThis is the present standard type of passenger engines on the Great\r\nNorth of Scotland Railway.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the engines of the Furness Railway, previously\r\ndescribed, others deserve recognition, and it should be placed on\r\nrecord that the red-brown colour distinguishing the locomotives of\r\nthis line has been the standard colour for a number of years. Some\r\nsixteen years or so back, the Midland Railway discarded green as the\r\ndistinguishing colour for its engines, and adopted the red-brown shade\r\nof the Furness Railway. Some people have imagined that the Furness\r\nRailway locomotives are painted in imitation of the Midland, but the\r\nfacts show the opposite to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 a type of four-wheels-coupled passenger engines were introduced\r\non the Furness Railway. The leading dimensions of these were:—\r\n\r\n    Diameter of cylinders                 1ft.  4in.\r\n    Stroke                                1ft.  8in.\r\n    Diameter of coupled wheels            6ft.  7½in.\r\n    Diameter of leading wheels            3ft.  8in.\r\n\r\n                CENTRE TO CENTRE OF WHEELS.\r\n    Leading to driving                    6ft.  6in.\r\n    Driving to trailing                   7ft.  9in.\r\n    Total wheel base                     14ft.  3in.\r\n    Diameter of boiler (mean)             3ft. 11in.\r\n    Length of barrel                     10ft.  0in.\r\n    Length of fire-box (shell)            4ft.  4in.\r\n    Number of tubes                      157—2in. external diameter.\r\n\r\n                     HEATING SURFACE.\r\n    Tubes                                839.5sq. ft.\r\n    Fire-box                              77.0sq. ft.\r\n                                         ------------\r\n            Total                        916.5sq. ft.\r\n\r\n                   TENDER (Four Wheels).\r\n    Grate area                            11.5sq. ft.\r\n    Diameter of wheels                    3ft. 8in.\r\n    Wheel base                            9ft. 6in.\r\n    Capacity of tank                     1,200 gallons.\r\n    Capacity coal                        3 tons.\r\n    Total wheel base, engine and tender  12ft. 0in.\r\n\r\n                WEIGHTS IN WORKING ORDER.\r\n                                           T.
