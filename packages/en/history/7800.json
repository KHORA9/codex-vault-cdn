LONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the wey to al good aventure.--CHAUCER\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY SISTER \"MILLIE\" IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF A LIFELONG SYMPATHY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nAfter the Chandos Portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which\r\nis attributed to Richard Burbage or John Taylor. In the catalogue of the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery the following description is given:\r\n\r\n      \"The Chandos Shakespeare was the property of John Taylor,\r\n      the player, by whom or by Richard Burbage it was painted.\r\n      The picture was left by the former in his will to Sir\r\n      William Davenant. After his death it was bought by\r\n      Betterton, the actor, upon whose decease Mr. Keck of the\r\n      Temple purchased it for 40 guineas, from whom it was\r\n      inherited by Mr. Nicoll of Michenden House, Southgate,\r\n      Middlesex, whose only daughter married James, Marquess of\r\n      Caernarvon, afterwards Duke of Chandos, father to Ann\r\n      Eliza, Duchess of Buckingham.\"\r\n\r\n    The above is written on paper attached to the back of the canvas.\r\n    Its authenticity, however, has been doubted in some quarters.\r\n\r\n    Purchased at the Stowe Sale, September 1848, by the Earl of\r\n    Ellesmere, and presented by him to the nation, March 1856.\r\n\r\n    Dimensions: 22 in. by 16-3/4 in.\r\n\r\nThis reproduction of the portrait was made from a miniature copy on ivory\r\nby Caroline King Phillips.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe last thing we find in making a book is to know what to put\r\nfirst.--Pascal\r\n\r\nWhen an author has finished his history, after months or years of happy\r\nwork, there comes a dismal hour when he must explain its purpose and\r\napologize for its shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThe explanation in this case is very simple and goes back to a personal\r\nexperience. When the author first studied the history of our literature\r\nthere was put into his hands as a textbook a most dreary catalogue of dead\r\nauthors, dead masterpieces, dead criticisms, dead ages; and a boy who knew\r\nchiefly that he was alive was supposed to become interested in this\r\nliterary sepulchre or else have it said that there was something hopeless\r\nabout him. Later he learned that the great writers of England and America\r\nwere concerned with life alone, as the most familiar, the most mysterious,\r\nthe most fascinating thing in the world, and that the only valuable or\r\ninteresting feature of any work of literature is its vitality.\r\n\r\nTo introduce these writers not as dead worthies but as companionable men\r\nand women, and to present their living subject as a living thing, winsome\r\nas a smile on a human face,--such was the author's purpose in writing this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe apology is harder to frame, as anyone knows who has attempted to gather\r\nthe writers of a thousand years into a single volume that shall have the\r\nthree virtues of brevity, readableness and accuracy. That this record is\r\nbrief in view of the immensity of the subject is plainly apparent. That it\r\nmay prove pleasantly readable is a hope inspired chiefly by the fact that\r\nit was a pleasure to write it, and that pleasure is contagious. As for\r\naccuracy, every historian who fears God or regards man strives hard enough\r\nfor that virtue; but after all his striving, remembering the difficulty of\r\ncriticism and the perversity of names and dates that tend to error as the\r\nsparks fly upward, he must still trust heaven and send forth his work with\r\nsomething of Chaucer's feeling when he wrote:\r\n\r\n  O littel bookë, thou art so unconning,\r\n  How darst thou put thy-self in prees for drede?\r\n\r\nWhich _may_ mean, to one who appreciates Chaucer's wisdom and humor,\r\nthat having written a little book in what seemed to him an unskilled or\r\n\"unconning\" way, he hesitated to give it to the world for dread of the\r\n\"prees\" or crowd of critics who, even in that early day, were wont to look\r\nupon each new book as a camel that must be put through the needle's eye of\r\ntheir tender mercies.\r\n\r\nIn the selection and arrangement of his material the author has aimed to\r\nmake a usable book that may appeal to pupils and teachers alike. Because\r\nhistory and literature are closely related (one being the record of man's\r\ndeed, the other of his thought and feeling) there is a brief historical\r\nintroduction to every literary period. There is also a review of the\r\ngeneral literary tendencies of each age, of the fashions, humors and ideals\r\nthat influenced writers in forming their style or selecting their subject.\r\nThen there is a biography of every important author, written not to offer\r\nanother subject for hero-worship but to present the man exactly as he was;\r\na review of his chief works, which is intended chiefly as a guide to the\r\nbest reading; and a critical estimate or appreciation of his writings based\r\npartly upon first-hand impressions, partly upon the assumption that an\r\nauthor must deal honestly with life as he finds it and that the business of\r\ncriticism is, as Emerson said, \"not to legislate but to raise the dead.\"\r\nThis detailed study of the greater writers of a period is followed by an\r\nexamination of some of the minor writers and their memorable works.\r\nFinally, each chapter concludes with a concise summary of the period under\r\nconsideration, a list of selections for reading and a bibliography of works\r\nthat will be found most useful in acquiring a larger knowledge of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn its general plan this little volume is modeled on the author's more\r\nadvanced _English Literature_ and _American Literature_; but the\r\nmaterial, the viewpoint, the presentation of individual writers,--all the\r\ndetails of the work are entirely new. Such a book is like a second journey\r\nthrough ample and beautiful regions filled with historic associations, a\r\njourney that one undertakes with new companions, with renewed pleasure and,\r\nit is to be hoped, with increased wisdom. It is hardly necessary to add\r\nthat our subject has still its unvoiced charms, that it cannot be exhausted\r\nor even adequately presented in any number of histories. For literature\r\ndeals with life; and life, with its endlessly surprising variety in unity,\r\nhas happily some suggestion of infinity.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J.

In an old English book, written before Columbus dreamed\r\nof a westward journey to find the East, is the story of a traveler who set\r\nout to search the world for wisdom. Through Palestine and India he passed,\r\ntraveling by sea or land through many seasons, till he came to a wonderful\r\nisland where he saw a man plowing in the fields. And the wonder was, that\r\nthe man was calling familiar words to his oxen, \"such wordes as men speken\r\nto bestes in his owne lond.\" Startled by the sound of his mother tongue he\r\nturned back on his course \"in gret mervayle, for he knewe not how it myghte\r\nbe.\" But if he had passed on a little, says the old record, \"he would have\r\nfounden his contree and his owne knouleche.\"\r\n\r\nFacing a new study of literature our impulse is to search in strange places\r\nfor a definition; but though we compass a world of books, we must return at\r\nlast, like the worthy man of _Mandeville's Travels_, to our own\r\nknowledge. Since childhood we have been familiar with this noble subject of\r\nliterature. We have entered into the heritage of the ancient Greeks, who\r\nthought that Homer was a good teacher for the nursery; we have made\r\nacquaintance with Psalm and Prophecy and Parable, with the knightly tales\r\nof Malory, with the fairy stories of Grimm or Andersen, with the poetry of\r\nShakespeare, with the novels of Scott or Dickens,--in short, with some of\r\nthe best books that the world has ever produced. We know, therefore, what\r\nliterature is, and that it is an excellent thing which ministers to the joy\r\nof living; but when we are asked to define the subject, we are in the\r\nposition of St. Augustine, who said of time, \"If you ask me what time is, I\r\nknow not; but if you ask me not, then I know.\" For literature is like\r\nhappiness, or love, or life itself, in that it can be understood or\r\nappreciated but can never be exactly described. It has certain describable\r\nqualities, however, and the best place to discover these is our own\r\nbookcase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TREE AND THE BOOK]\r\n\r\nHere on a shelf are a Dictionary, a History of America, a text on\r\nChemistry, which we read or study for information; on a higher shelf are\r\n_As You Like It_, _Hiawatha_, _Lorna Doone_, _The Oregon\r\nTrail_, and other works to which we go for pleasure when the day's work\r\nis done. In one sense all these and all other books are literature; for the\r\nroot meaning of the word is \"letters,\" and a letter means a character\r\ninscribed or rubbed upon a prepared surface. A series of letters\r\nintelligently arranged forms a book, and for the root meaning of \"book\" you\r\nmust go to a tree; because the Latin word for book, _liber_, means the\r\ninner layer of bark that covers a tree bole, and \"book\" or \"boc\" is the old\r\nEnglish name for the beech, on whose silvery surface our ancestors carved\r\ntheir first runic letters.\r\n\r\nSo also when we turn the \"leaves\" of a book, our mind goes back over a long\r\ntrail: through rattling printing-shop, and peaceful monk's cell, and gloomy\r\ncave with walls covered with picture writing, till the trail ends beside a\r\nshadowy forest, where primitive man takes a smooth leaf and inscribes his\r\nthought upon it by means of a pointed stick. A tree is the Adam of all\r\nbooks, and everything that the hand of man has written upon the tree or its\r\nproducts or its substitutes is literature. But that is too broad a\r\ndefinition; we must limit it by excluding what does not here concern us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOOKS OF KNOWLEDGE AND OF POWER]\r\n\r\nOur first exclusion is of that immense class of writings--books of science,\r\nhistory, philosophy, and the rest--to which we go for information. These\r\naim to preserve or to systematize the discoveries of men; they appeal\r\nchiefly to the intellect and they are known as the literature of knowledge.\r\nThere remains another large class of writings, sometimes called the\r\nliterature of power, consisting of poems, plays, essays, stories of every\r\nkind, to which we go treasure-hunting for happiness or counsel, for noble\r\nthoughts or fine feelings, for rest of body or exercise of spirit,--for\r\nalmost everything, in fine, except information. As Chaucer said, long ago,\r\nsuch writings are:\r\n\r\n  For pleasaunce high, and for noon other end.\r\n\r\nThey aim to give us pleasure; they appeal chiefly to our imagination and\r\nour emotions; they awaken in us a feeling of sympathy or admiration for\r\nwhatever is beautiful in nature or society or the soul of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ART OF LITERATURE]\r\n\r\nThe author who would attempt books of such high purpose must be careful of\r\nboth the matter and the manner of his writing, must give one thought to\r\nwhat he shall say and another thought to how he shall say it. He selects\r\nthe best or most melodious words, the finest figures, and aims to make his\r\nstory or poem beautiful in itself, as a painter strives to reflect a face\r\nor a landscape in a beautiful way. Any photographer can in a few minutes\r\nreproduce a human face, but only an artist can by care and labor bring\r\nforth a beautiful portrait. So any historian can write the facts of the\r\nBattle of Gettysburg; but only a Lincoln can in noble words reveal the\r\nbeauty and immortal meaning of that mighty conflict.\r\n\r\nTo all such written works, which quicken our sense of the beautiful, and\r\nwhich are as a Jacob's ladder on which we mount for higher views of nature\r\nor humanity, we confidently give the name \"literature,\" meaning the art of\r\nliterature in distinction from the mere craft of writing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PASSING AND THE PERMANENT]\r\n\r\nSuch a definition, though it cuts out the greater part of human records, is\r\nstill too broad for our purpose, and again we must limit it by a process of\r\nexclusion. For to study almost any period of English letters is to discover\r\nthat it produced hundreds of books which served the purpose of literature,\r\nif only for a season, by affording pleasure to readers. No sooner were they\r\nwritten than Time began to winnow them over and over, giving them to all\r\nthe winds of opinion, one generation after another, till the hosts of\r\nephemeral works were swept aside, and only a remnant was left in the hands\r\nof the winnower. To this remnant, books of abiding interest, on which the\r\nyears have no effect save to mellow or flavor them, we give the name of\r\ngreat or enduring literature; and with these chiefly we deal in our present\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE QUALITY OF GREATNESS]\r\n\r\nTo the inevitable question, What are the marks of great literature? no\r\npositive answer can be returned. As a tree is judged by its fruits, so is\r\nliterature judged not by theory but by the effect which it produces on\r\nhuman life; and the judgment is first personal, then general. If a book has\r\npower to awaken in you a lively sense of pleasure or a profound emotion of\r\nsympathy; if it quickens your love of beauty or truth or goodness; if it\r\nmoves you to generous thought or noble action, then that book is, for you\r\nand for the time, a great book. If after ten or fifty years it still has\r\npower to quicken you, then for you at least it is a great book forever. And\r\nif it affects many other men and women as it affects you, and if it lives\r\nwith power from one generation to another, gladdening the children as it\r\ngladdened the fathers, then surely it is great literature, without further\r\nqualification or need of definition. From this viewpoint the greatest poem\r\nin the world--greatest in that it abides in most human hearts as a loved\r\nand honored guest--is not a mighty _Iliad_ or _Paradise Lost_ or\r\n_Divine Comedy_; it is a familiar little poem of a dozen lines,\r\nbeginning \"The Lord is my Shepherd.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that great literature, which appeals to all classes of men\r\nand to all times, cannot go far afield for rare subjects, or follow new\r\ninventions, or concern itself with fashions that are here to-day and gone\r\nto-morrow. Its only subjects are nature and human nature; it deals with\r\ncommon experiences of joy or sorrow, pain or pleasure, that all men\r\nunderstand; it cherishes the unchanging ideals of love, faith, duty,\r\nfreedom, reverence, courtesy, which were old to the men who kept their\r\nflocks on the plains of Shinar, and which will be young as the morning to\r\nour children's children.\r\n\r\nSuch ideals tend to ennoble a writer, and therefore are great books\r\ncharacterized by lofty thought, by fine feeling and, as a rule, by a\r\nbeautiful simplicity of expression. They have another quality, hard to\r\ndefine but easy to understand, a quality which leaves upon us the\r\nimpression of eternal youth, as if they had been dipped in the fountain\r\nwhich Ponce de Leon sought for in vain through the New World. If a great\r\nbook could speak, it would use the words of the Cobzar (poet) in his \"Last\r\nSong\":\r\n\r\n  The merry Spring, he is my brother,\r\n    And when he comes this way\r\n  Each year again, he always asks me:\r\n    \"Art thou not yet grown gray?\"\r\n  But I. I keep my youth forever,\r\n    Even as the Spring his May.\r\n\r\nA DEFINITION. Literature, then, if one must formulate a definition, is the\r\nwritten record of man's best thought and feeling, and English literature is\r\nthe part of that record which belongs to the English people. In its\r\nbroadest sense literature includes all writing, but as we commonly define\r\nthe term it excludes works which aim at instruction, and includes only the\r\nworks which aim to give pleasure, and which are artistic in that they\r\nreflect nature or human life in a way to arouse our sense of beauty. In a\r\nstill narrower sense, when we study the history of literature we deal\r\nchiefly with the great, the enduring books, which may have been written in\r\nan elder or a latter day, but which have in them the magic of all time.\r\n\r\nOne may easily challenge such a definition, which, like most others, is far\r\nfrom faultless. It is difficult, for example, to draw the line sharply\r\nbetween instructive and pleasure-giving works; for many an instructive book\r\nof history gives us pleasure, and there may be more instruction on\r\nimportant matters in a pleasurable poem than in a treatise on ethics.\r\nAgain, there are historians who allege that English literature must include\r\nnot simply the works of Britain but everything written in the English\r\nlanguage. There are other objections; but to straighten them all out is to\r\nbe long in starting, and there is a pleasant journey ahead of us. Chaucer\r\nhad literature in mind when he wrote:\r\n\r\n  Through me men goon into that blisful place\r\n       Of hertës hele and dedly woundës cure;\r\n  Through me men goon unto the wells of grace,\r\n       Ther grene and lusty May shal ever endure:\r\n       This is the wey to al good aventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  Then the warrior, battle-tried, touched the sounding glee-wood:\r\n  Straight awoke the harp's sweet note; straight a song uprose,\r\n  Sooth and sad its music. Then from hero's lips there fell\r\n  A wonder-tale, well told.\r\n\r\n                    _Beowulf_, line 2017 (a free rendering)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its beginnings English literature is like a river, which proceeds not\r\nfrom a single wellhead but from many springs, each sending forth its\r\nrivulet of sweet or bitter water. As there is a place where the river\r\nassumes a character of its own, distinct from all its tributaries, so in\r\nEnglish literature there is a time when it becomes national rather than\r\ntribal, and English rather than Saxon or Celtic or Norman. That time was in\r\nthe fifteenth century, when the poems of Chaucer and the printing press of\r\nCaxton exalted the Midland above all other dialects and established it as\r\nthe literary language of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRIBUTARIES OF LITERATURE]\r\n\r\nBefore that time, if you study the records of Britain, you meet several\r\ndifferent tribes and races of men: the native Celt, the law-giving Roman,\r\nthe colonizing Saxon, the sea-roving Dane, the feudal baron of Normandy,\r\neach with his own language and literature reflecting the traditions of his\r\nown people. Here in these old records is a strange medley of folk heroes,\r\nArthur and Beowulf, Cnut and Brutus, Finn and Cuchulain, Roland and Robin\r\nHood. Older than the tales of such folk-heroes are ancient riddles, charms,\r\ninvocations to earth and sky:\r\n\r\n  Hal wes thu, Folde, fira moder!\r\n  Hail to thee, Earth, thou mother of men!\r\n\r\nWith these pagan spells are found the historical writings of the Venerable\r\nBede, the devout hymns of Cædmon, Welsh legends, Irish and Scottish fairy\r\nstories, Scandinavian myths, Hebrew and Christian traditions, romances from\r\ndistant Italy which had traveled far before the Italians welcomed them. All\r\nthese and more, whether originating on British soil or brought in by\r\nmissionaries or invaders, held each to its own course for a time, then met\r\nand mingled in the swelling stream which became English literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONEHENGE, ON SALISBURY PLAIN\r\nProbably the ruins of a temple of the native Britons]\r\n\r\nTo trace all these tributaries to their obscure and lonely sources would\r\nrequire the labor of a lifetime. We shall here examine only the two main\r\nbranches of our early literature, to the end that we may better appreciate\r\nthe vigor and variety of modern English. The first is the Anglo-Saxon,\r\nwhich came into England in the middle of the fifth century with the\r\ncolonizing Angles, Jutes and Saxons from the shores of the North Sea and\r\nthe Baltic; the second is the Norman-French, which arrived six centuries\r\nlater at the time of the Norman invasion. Except in their emphasis on\r\npersonal courage, there is a marked contrast between these two branches,\r\nthe former being stern and somber, the latter gay and fanciful. In\r\nAnglo-Saxon poetry we meet a strong man who cherishes his own ideals of\r\nhonor, in Norman-French poetry a youth eagerly interested in romantic tales\r\ngathered from all the world. One represents life as a profound mystery, the\r\nother as a happy adventure.\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON OR OLD-ENGLISH PERIOD (450-1050)\r\n\r\nSPECIMENS OF THE LANGUAGE. Our English speech has changed so much in the\r\ncourse of centuries that it is now impossible to read our earliest records\r\nwithout special study; but that Anglo-Saxon is our own and not a foreign\r\ntongue may appear from the following examples. The first is a stanza from\r\n\"Widsith,\" the chant of a wandering gleeman or minstrel; and for comparison\r\nwe place beside it Andrew Lang's modern version. Nobody knows how old\r\n\"Widsith\" is; it may have been sung to the accompaniment of a harp that was\r\nbroken fourteen hundred years ago. The second, much easier to read, is from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was prepared by King Alfred from an older\r\nrecord in the ninth century:\r\n\r\n  Swa scrithende\r\n      gesceapum hweorfath,\r\n  Gleomen gumena\r\n      geond grunda fela;\r\n  Thearfe secgath,\r\n      thonc-word sprecath,\r\n  Simle, suth oththe north\r\n      sumne gemetath,\r\n  Gydda gleawne\r\n      geofam unhneawne.\r\n\r\n  So wandering on\r\n      the world about,\r\n  Gleemen do roam\r\n      through many lands;\r\n  They say their needs,\r\n      they speak their thanks,\r\n  Sure, south or north\r\n      someone to meet,\r\n  Of songs to judge\r\n      and gifts not grudge.\r\n\r\n    Her Hengest and Aesc, his sunu, gefuhton wid Bryttas on thaere\r\n    stowe the is gecweden Creccanford, and thaer ofslogon feower\r\n    thusenda wera. And tha Bryttas tha forleton Cent-lond, and mid\r\n    myclum ege flugon to Lundenbyrig.\r\n\r\n    At this time Hengist and Esk, his son, fought with the Britons at\r\n    the place that is called Crayford, and there slew four thousand\r\n    men. And the Britons then forsook Kentland, and with much fear fled\r\n    to London town.\r\n\r\nBEOWULF. The old epic poem, called after its hero Beowulf, is more than\r\nmyth or legend, more even than history; it is a picture of a life and a\r\nworld that once had real existence. Of that vanished life, that world of\r\nancient Englishmen, only a few material fragments remain: a bit of linked\r\narmor, a rusted sword with runic inscriptions, the oaken ribs of a war\r\ngalley buried with the Viking who had sailed it on stormy seas, and who was\r\nentombed in it because he loved it. All these are silent witnesses; they\r\nhave no speech or language. But this old poem is a living voice, speaking\r\nwith truth and sincerity of the daily habit of the fathers of modern\r\nEngland, of their adventures by sea or land, their stern courage and grave\r\ncourtesy, their ideals of manly honor, their thoughts of life and death.\r\n\r\nLet us hear, then, the story of _Beowulf_, picturing in our\r\nimagination the story-teller and his audience. The scene opens in a great\r\nhall, where a fire blazes on the hearth and flashes upon polished shields\r\nagainst the timbered walls. Down the long room stretches a table where men\r\nare feasting or passing a beaker from hand to hand, and anon crying _Hal!\r\nhal!_ in answer to song or in greeting to a guest. At the head of the\r\nhall sits the chief with his chosen ealdormen. At a sign from the chief a\r\ngleeman rises and strikes a single clear note from his harp. Silence falls\r\non the benches; the story begins:\r\n\r\n  Hail! we of the Spear Danes in days of old\r\n  Have heard the glory of warriors sung;\r\n  Have cheered the deeds that our chieftains wrought,\r\n  And the brave Scyld's triumph o'er his foes.\r\n\r\n    Then because there are Scyldings present, and because brave men\r\n    revere their ancestors, the gleeman tells a beautiful legend of how\r\n    King Scyld came and went: how he arrived as a little child, in a\r\n    war-galley that no man sailed, asleep amid jewels and weapons; and\r\n    how, when his life ended at the call of Wyrd or Fate, they placed\r\n    him against the mast of a ship, with treasures heaped around him\r\n    and a golden banner above his head, gave ship and cargo to the\r\n    winds, and sent their chief nobly back to the deep whence he came.\r\n\r\n    So with picturesque words the gleeman thrills his hearers with a\r\n    vivid picture of a Viking's sea-burial. It thrills us now, when the\r\n    Vikings are no more, and when no other picture can be drawn by an\r\n    eyewitness of that splendid pagan rite.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE STORY OF HEOROT]\r\n\r\n    One of Scyld's descendants was King Hrothgar (Roger) who built the\r\n    hall Heorot, where the king and his men used to gather nightly to\r\n    feast, and to listen to the songs of scop or gleeman. [Footnote:\r\n    Like Agamemnon and the Greek chieftains, every Saxon leader had his\r\n    gleeman or minstrel, and had also his own poet, his scop or\r\n    \"shaper,\" whose duty it was to shape a glorious deed into more\r\n    glorious verse. So did our pagan ancestors build their monuments\r\n    out of songs that should live in the hearts of men when granite or\r\n    earth mound had crumbled away.] \"There was joy of heroes,\" but in\r\n    one night the joy was changed to mourning. Out on the lonely fens\r\n    dwelt the jotun (giant or monster) Grendel, who heard the sound of\r\n    men's mirth and quickly made an end of it. One night, as the thanes\r\n    slept in the hall, he burst in the door and carried off thirty\r\n    warriors to devour them in his lair under the sea. Another and\r\n    another horrible raid followed, till Heorot was deserted and the\r\n    fear of Grendel reigned among the Spear Danes. There were brave men\r\n    among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were\r\n    powerless against the monster? \"Their swords would not bite on his\r\n    body.\"\r\n\r\n    For twelve years this terror continued; then the rumor of Grendel\r\n    reached the land of the Geats, where Beowulf lived at the court of\r\n    his uncle, King Hygelac. No sooner did Beowulf hear of a dragon to\r\n    be slain, of a friendly king \"in need of a man,\" than he selected\r\n    fourteen companions and launched his war-galley in search of\r\n    adventure.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE SAILING OF BEOWULF]\r\n\r\n    At this point the old epic becomes a remarkable portrayal of daily\r\n    life. In its picturesque lines we see the galley set sail, foam\r\n    flying from her prow; we catch the first sight of the southern\r\n    headlands, approach land, hear the challenge of the \"warder of the\r\n    cliffs\" and Beowulf's courteous answer. We follow the march to\r\n    Heorot in war-gear, spears flashing, swords and byrnies clanking,\r\n    and witness the exchange of greetings between Hrothgar and the\r\n    young hero. Again is the feast spread in Heorot; once more is heard\r\n    the song of gleemen, the joyous sound of warriors in comradeship.\r\n    There is also a significant picture of Hrothgar's wife, \"mindful of\r\n    courtesies,\" honoring her guests by passing the mead-cup with her\r\n    own hands. She is received by these stern men with profound\r\n    respect.\r\n\r\n    When the feast draws to an end the fear of Grendel returns.\r\n    Hrothgar warns his guests that no weapon can harm the monster, that\r\n    it is death to sleep in the hall; then the Spear Danes retire,\r\n    leaving Beowulf and his companions to keep watch and ward. With the\r\n    careless confidence of brave men, forthwith they all fall asleep:\r\n\r\n      Forth from the fens, from the misty moorlands,\r\n      Grendel came gliding--God's wrath he bore--\r\n      Came under clouds until he saw clearly,\r\n      Glittering with gold plates, the mead-hall of men.\r\n      Down fell the door, though hardened with fire-bands,\r\n      Open it sprang at the stroke of his paw.\r\n      Swollen with rage burst in the bale-bringer,\r\n      Flamed in his eyes a fierce light, likest fire.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE FIGHT WITH GRENDEL]\r\n\r\n    Throwing himself upon the nearest sleeper Grendel crushes and\r\n    swallows him; then he stretches out a paw towards Beowulf, only to\r\n    find it \"seized in such a grip as the fiend had never felt before.\"\r\n    A desperate conflict begins, and a mighty uproar,--crashing of\r\n    benches, shoutings of men, the \"war-song\" of Grendel, who is trying\r\n    to break the grip of his foe. As the monster struggles toward the\r\n    door, dragging the hero with him, a wide wound opens on his\r\n    shoulder; the sinews snap, and with a mighty wrench Beowulf tears\r\n    off the whole limb. While Grendel rushes howling across the fens,\r\n    Beowulf hangs the grisly arm with its iron claws, \"the whole\r\n    grapple of Grendel,\" over the door where all may see it.\r\n\r\n    Once more there is joy in Heorot, songs, speeches, the liberal\r\n    giving of gifts. Thinking all danger past, the Danes sleep in the\r\n    hall; but at midnight comes the mother of Grendel, raging to avenge\r\n    her son. Seizing the king's bravest companion she carries him away,\r\n    and he is never seen again.\r\n\r\n    Here is another adventure for Beowulf. To old Hrothgar, lamenting\r\n    his lost earl, the hero says simply:\r\n\r\n      Wise chief, sorrow not. For a man it is meet\r\n      His friend to avenge, not to mourn for his loss;\r\n      For death comes to all, but honor endures:\r\n      Let him win it who will, ere Wyrd to him calls,\r\n      And fame be the fee of a warrior dead!\r\n\r\n    Following the trail of the _Brimwylf_ or _Merewif_\r\n    (sea-wolf or sea-woman) Beowulf and his companions pass through\r\n    desolate regions to a wild cliff on the shore. There a friend\r\n    offers his good sword Hrunting for the combat, and Beowulf accepts\r\n    the weapon, saying:\r\n\r\n                   ic me mid Hruntinge\r\n      Dom gewyrce, oththe mec death nimeth.\r\n                         I with Hrunting\r\n      Honor will win, or death shall me take.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE DRAGON'S CAVE]\r\n\r\n    Then he plunges into the black water, is attacked on all sides by\r\n    the _Grundwrygen_ or bottom monsters, and as he stops to fight\r\n    them is seized by the _Merewif_ and dragged into a cave, a\r\n    mighty \"sea-hall\" free from water and filled with a strange light.\r\n    On its floor are vast treasures; its walls are adorned with\r\n    weapons; in a corner huddles the wounded Grendel. All this Beowulf\r\n    sees in a glance as he turns to fight his new foe.\r\n\r\n    Follows then another terrific combat, in which the brand Hrunting\r\n    proves useless. Though it rings out its \"clanging war-song\" on the\r\n    monster's scales, it will not \"bite\" on the charmed body. Beowulf\r\n    is down, and at the point of death, when his eye lights on a huge\r\n    sword forged by the jotuns of old. Struggling to his feet he seizes\r\n    the weapon, whirls it around his head for a mighty blow, and the\r\n    fight is won. Another blow cuts off the head of Grendel, but at the\r\n    touch of the poisonous blood the steel blade melts like ice before\r\n    the fire.\r\n\r\n    Leaving all the treasures, Beowulf takes only the golden hilt of\r\n    the magic sword and the head of Grendel, reënters the sea and\r\n    mounts up to his companions. They welcome him as one returned from\r\n    the dead. They relieve him of helmet and byrnie, and swing away in\r\n    a triumphal procession to Heorot. The hero towers among them, a\r\n    conspicuous figure, and next to him comes the enormous head of\r\n    Grendel carried on a spear-shaft by four of the stoutest thanes.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE FIREDRAKE]\r\n\r\n    More feasting, gifts, noble speeches follow before the hero returns\r\n    to his own land, laden with treasures. So ends the first part of\r\n    the epic. In the second part Beowulf succeeds Hygelac as chief of\r\n    the Geats, and rules them well for fifty years. Then a \"firedrake,\"\r\n    guarding an immense hoard of treasure (as in most of the old dragon\r\n    stories), begins to ravage the land. Once more the aged Beowulf\r\n    goes forth to champion his people; but he feels that \"Wyrd is close\r\n    to hand,\" and the fatalism which pervades all the poem is finely\r\n    expressed in his speech to his companions. In his last fight he\r\n    kills the dragon, winning the dragon's treasure for his people; but\r\n    as he battles amid flame and smoke the fire enters his lungs, and\r\n    he dies \"as dies a man,\" paying for victory with his life. Among\r\n    his last words is a command which reminds us again of the old\r\n    Greeks, and of the word of Elpenor to Odysseus:\r\n\r\n        \"Bid my brave men raise a barrow for me on the headland,\r\n        broad, high, to be seen far out at sea: that hereafter\r\n        sea-farers, driving their foamy keels through ocean's mist,\r\n        may behold and say, ''Tis Beowulf's mound!'\"\r\n\r\n    The hero's last words and the closing scenes of the epic, including\r\n    the funeral pyre, the \"bale-fire\" and another Viking burial to the\r\n    chant of armed men riding their war steeds, are among the noblest\r\n    that have come down to us from beyond the dawn of history.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, is the story of _Beowulf_. It is recorded on a\r\nfire-marked manuscript, preserved as by a miracle from the torch of the\r\nDanes, which is now one of the priceless treasures of the British Museum.\r\nThe handwriting indicates that the manuscript was copied about the year\r\n1100, but the language points to the eighth or ninth century, when the poem\r\nin its present form was probably composed on English soil. [Footnote:\r\nMaterials used in _Beowulf_ are very old, and may have been brought to\r\nEngland during the Anglo-Saxon invasion. Parts of the material, such as the\r\ndragon-fights, are purely mythical. They relate to Beowa, a superman, of\r\nwhom many legends were told by Scandinavian minstrels. The Grendel legend,\r\nfor example, appears in the Icelandic saga of Gretti, who slays the dragon\r\nGlam. Other parts of _Beowulf_ are old battle songs; and still others,\r\nrelating to King Hygelac and his nephew, have some historical foundation.\r\nSo little is known about the epic that one cannot safely make any positive\r\nstatement as to its origin. It was written in crude, uneven lines; but a\r\nrhythmic, martial effect, as of marching men, was produced by strong accent\r\nand alliteration, and the effect was strengthened by the harp with which\r\nthe gleeman always accompanied his recital.]\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON SONGS. Beside the epic of _Beowulf_ a few mutilated poems\r\nhave been preserved, and these are as fragments of a plate or film upon\r\nwhich the life of long ago left its impression. One of the oldest of these\r\npoems is \"Widsith,\" the \"wide-goer,\" which describes the wanderings and\r\nrewards of the ancient gleeman. It begins:\r\n\r\n  Widsith spake, his word-hoard unlocked,\r\n  He who farthest had fared among earth-folk and tribe-folk.\r\n\r\nThen follows a recital of the places he had visited, and the gifts he had\r\nreceived for his singing. Some of the personages named are real, others\r\nmythical; and as the list covers half a world and several centuries of\r\ntime, it is certain that Widsith's recital cannot be taken literally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEANING OF WIDSITH]\r\n\r\nTwo explanations offer themselves: the first, that the poem contains the\r\nwork of many scops, each of whom added his travels to those of his\r\npredecessor; the second, that Widsith, like other gleemen, was both\r\nhistorian and poet, a keeper of tribal legends as well as a shaper of\r\nsongs, and that he was ever ready to entertain his audience with things new\r\nor old. Thus, he mentioned Hrothgar as one whom he had visited; and if a\r\nhearer called for a tale at this point, the scop would recite that part of\r\n_Beowulf_ which tells of the monster Grendel. Again, he named Sigard\r\nthe Volsung (the Siegfrid of the _Niebelungenlied_ and of Wagner's\r\nopera), and this would recall the slaying of the dragon Fafnir, or some\r\nother  story of the old Norse saga. So every name or place which Widsith\r\nmentioned was an invitation. When he came to a hall and \"unlocked his\r\nword-hoard,\" he offered his hearers a variety of poems and legends from\r\nwhich they made their own selection. Looked at in this way, the old poem\r\nbecomes an epitome of Anglo-Saxon literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPES OF SAXON POETRY]\r\n\r\nOther fragments of the period are valuable as indicating that the\r\nAnglo-Saxons were familiar with various types of poetry. \"Deor's Lament,\"\r\ndescribing the sorrows of a scop who had lost his place beside his chief,\r\nis a true lyric; that is, a poem which reflects the author's feeling rather\r\nthan the deed of another man. In his grief the scop comforts himself by\r\nrecalling the afflictions of various heroes, and he ends each stanza with\r\nthe refrain:\r\n\r\n  That sorrow he endured; this also may I.\r\n\r\nAmong the best of the early poems are: \"The Ruined City,\" reflecting the\r\nfeeling of one who looks on crumbling walls that were once the abode of\r\nhuman ambition; \"The Seafarer,\" a chantey of the deep, which ends with an\r\nallegory comparing life to a sea voyage; \"The Wanderer,\" which is the\r\nplaint of one who has lost home, patron, ambition, and as the easiest way\r\nout of his difficulty turns _eardstappa_, an \"earth-hitter\" or tramp;\r\n\"The Husband's Message,\" which is the oldest love song in our literature;\r\nand a few ballads and battle songs, such as \"The Battle of Brunanburh\"\r\n(familiar to us in Tennyson's translation) and \"The Fight at Finnsburgh,\"\r\nwhich was mentioned by the gleemen in _Beowulf_, and which was then\r\nprobably as well known as \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" is to modern\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nAnother early war song, \"The Battle of Maldon\" or \"Byrhtnoth's Death,\" has\r\nseldom been rivaled in savage vigor or in the expression of deathless\r\nloyalty to a chosen leader. The climax of the poem is reached when the few\r\nsurvivors of an uneven battle make a ring of spears about their fallen\r\nchief, shake their weapons in the face of an overwhelming horde of Danes,\r\nwhile Byrhtwold, \"the old comrade,\" chants their defiance:\r\n\r\n  The sterner shall thought be, the bolder our hearts,\r\n  The greater the mood as lessens our might.\r\n\r\nWe know not when or by whom this stirring battle cry was written. It was\r\ncopied under date of 991 in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, and is\r\ncommonly called the swan song of Anglo-Saxon poetry. The lion song would be\r\na better name for it.\r\n\r\nLATER PROSE AND POETRY. The works we have just considered were wholly pagan\r\nin spirit, but all reference to Thor or other gods was excluded by the\r\nmonks who first wrote down the scop's poetry.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of these monks a reform swept over pagan England, and\r\nliterature reflected the change in a variety of ways. For example, early\r\nAnglo-Saxon poetry was mostly warlike, for the reason that the various\r\nearldoms were in constant strife; but now the peace of good will was\r\npreached, and moral courage, the triumph of self-control, was exalted above\r\nmere physical hardihood. In the new literature the adventures of Columb or\r\nAidan or Brendan were quite as thrilling as any legends of Beowulf or\r\nSigard, but the climax of the adventure was spiritual, and the emphasis was\r\nalways on moral heroism.\r\n\r\nAnother result of the changed condition was that the unlettered scop, who\r\ncarried his whole stock of poetry in his head, was replaced by the literary\r\nmonk, who had behind him the immense culture of the Latin language, and who\r\nwas interested in world history or Christian doctrine rather than in tribal\r\nfights or pagan mythology. These monks were capable men; they understood\r\nthe appeal of pagan poetry, and their motto was, \"Let nothing good be\r\nwasted.\" So they made careful copy of the scop's best songs (else had not a\r\nshred of early poetry survived), and so the pagan's respect for womanhood,\r\nhis courage, his loyalty to a chief,--all his virtues were recognized and\r\nturned to religious account in the new literature. Even the beautiful pagan\r\nscrolls, or \"dragon knots,\" once etched on a warrior's sword, were\r\nreproduced in glowing colors in the initial letters of the monk's\r\nilluminated Gospel.\r\n\r\nA third result of the peaceful conquest of the missionaries was that many\r\nmonasteries were established in Britain, each a center of learning and of\r\nwriting. So arose the famous Northumbrian School of literature, to which we\r\nowe the writings of Bede, Cædmon, Cynewulf and others associated with\r\ncertain old monasteries, such as Peterborough, Jarrow, York and Whitby, all\r\nnorth of the river Humber.\r\n\r\nBEDE. The good work of the monks is finely exemplified in the life of the\r\nVenerable Bede, or Bæda (_cir_. 673-735), who is well called the\r\nfather of English learning. As a boy he entered the Benedictine monastery\r\nat Jarrow; the temper of his manhood may be judged from a single sentence\r\nof his own record:\r\n\r\n    \"While attentive to the discipline of mine order and the daily care\r\n    of singing in the church, my constant delight was in learning or\r\n    teaching or writing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly too much to say that this gentle scholar was for half a\r\ncentury the teacher of Europe. He collected a large library of manuscripts;\r\nhe was the author of some forty works, covering the whole field of human\r\nknowledge in his day; and to his school at Jarrow came hundreds of pupils\r\nfrom all parts of the British Isles, and hundreds more from the Continent.\r\nOf all his works the most notable is the so-called \"Ecclesiastical History\"\r\n(_Historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum_) which should be named the\r\n\"History of the Race of Angles.\" This book marks the beginning of our\r\nliterature of knowledge, and to it we are largely indebted for what we know\r\nof English history from the time of Cæsar's invasion to the early part of\r\nthe eighth century.\r\n\r\nAll the extant works of Bede are in Latin, but we are told by his pupil\r\nCuthbert that he was \"skilled in our English songs,\" that he made poems and\r\ntranslated the Gospel of John into English. These works, which would now be\r\nof priceless value, were all destroyed by the plundering Danes.\r\n\r\nAs an example of Bede's style, we translate a typical passage from his\r\nHistory. The scene is the Saxon _Witenagemôt_, or council of wise men,\r\ncalled by King Edward (625) to consider the doctrine of Paulinus, who had\r\nbeen sent from Rome by Pope Gregory. The first speaker is Coifi, a priest\r\nof the old religion:\r\n\r\n    \"Consider well, O king, this new doctrine which is preached to us;\r\n    for I now declare, what I have learned for certain, that the old\r\n    religion has no virtue in it. For none of your people has been more\r\n    diligent than I in the worship of our gods; yet many receive more\r\n    favors from you, and are preferred above me, and are more\r\n    prosperous in their affairs. If the old gods had any discernment,\r\n    they would surely favor me, since I have been most diligent in\r\n    their service. It is expedient, therefore, if this new faith that\r\n    is preached is any more profitable than the old, that we accept it\r\n    without delay.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Coifi, who as a priest has hitherto been obliged to ride upon an\r\nass with wagging ears, calls loudly for a horse, a prancing horse, a\r\nstallion, and cavorts off, a crowd running at his heels, to hurl a spear\r\ninto the shrine where he lately worshiped. He is a good type of the\r\npolitical demagogue, who clamors for progress when he wants an office, and\r\nwhose spear is more likely to be hurled at the back of a friend than at the\r\nbreast of an enemy.\r\n\r\nThen a pagan chief rises to speak, and we bow to a nobler motive. His\r\nallegory of the mystery of life is like a strain of Anglo-Saxon poetry; it\r\nmoves us deeply, as it moved his hearers ten centuries ago:\r\n\r\n    \"This present life of man, O king, in comparison with the time that\r\n    is hidden from us, is as the flight of a sparrow through the room\r\n    where you sit at supper, with companions around you and a good fire\r\n    on the hearth. Outside are the storms of wintry rain and snow. The\r\n    sparrow flies in at one opening, and instantly out at another:\r\n    whilst he is within he is sheltered from the winter storms, but\r\n    after a moment of pleasant weather he speeds from winter back to\r\n    winter again, and vanishes from your sight into the darkness whence\r\n    he came. Even so the life of man appears for a little time; but of\r\n    what went before and of what comes after we are wholly ignorant. If\r\n    this new religion can teach us anything of greater certainty, it\r\n    surely deserves to be followed.\" [Footnote: Bede, _Historia_,\r\n    Book II, chap xiii, a free translation]\r\n\r\nCÆDMON (SEVENTH CENTURY). In a beautiful chapter of Bede's History we may\r\nread how Cædmon (d. 680) discovered his gift of poetry. He was, says the\r\nrecord, a poor unlettered servant of the Abbess Hilda, in her monastery at\r\nWhitby. At that time (and here is an interesting commentary on monastic\r\nculture) singing and poetry were so familiar that, whenever a feast was\r\ngiven, a harp would be brought in, and each monk or guest would in turn\r\nentertain the company with a song or poem to his own musical accompaniment.\r\nBut Cædmon could not sing, and when he saw the harp coming down the table\r\nhe would slip away ashamed, to perform his humble duties in the monastery:\r\n\r\n    \"Now it happened once that he did this thing at a certain\r\n    festivity, and went out to the stable to care for the horses, this\r\n    duty being assigned him for that night. As he slept at the usual\r\n    time one stood by him, saying, 'Cædmon, sing me something.' He\r\n    answered, 'I cannot sing, and that is why I came hither from the\r\n    feast.' But he who spake unto him said again, 'Cædmon, sing to me.'\r\n    And he said, 'What shall I sing?' And that one said, 'Sing the\r\n    beginning of created things.' Thereupon Cædmon began to sing verses\r\n    that he had never heard before, of this import:\r\n\r\n      Nu scylun hergan hefaenriches ward ...\r\n      Now shall we hallow the warden of heaven,\r\n      He the Creator, he the Allfather,\r\n      Deeds of his might and thoughts of his mind....\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CÆDMON CROSS AT WHITBY ABBEY]\r\n\r\nIn the morning he remembered the words, and came humbly to the monks to\r\nrecite the first recorded Christian hymn in our language. And a very noble\r\nhymn it is. The monks heard him in wonder, and took him to the Abbess\r\nHilda, who gave order that Cædmon should receive instruction and enter the\r\nmonastery as one of the brethren. Then the monks expounded to him the\r\nScriptures. He in turn, reflecting on what he had heard, echoed it back to\r\nthe monks \"in such melodious words that his teachers became his pupils.\"\r\nSo, says the record, the whole course of Bible history was turned into\r\nexcellent poetry.\r\n\r\nAbout a thousand years later, in the days of Milton, an Anglo-Saxon\r\nmanuscript was discovered containing a metrical paraphrase of the books of\r\nGenesis, Exodus and Daniel, and these were supposed to be some of the poems\r\nmentioned in Bede's narrative. A study of the poems (now known as the\r\nCædmonian Cycle) leads to the conclusion that they were probably the work\r\nof two or three writers, and it has not been determined what part Cædmon\r\nhad in their composition. The nobility of style in the Genesis poem and the\r\npicturesque account of the fallen angels (which reappears in _Paradise\r\nLost_) have won for Cædmon his designation as the Milton of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period. [Footnote: A friend of Milton, calling himself\r\nFranciscus Junius, first printed the Cædmon poems in Antwerp (_cir_.\r\n1655) during Milton's lifetime. The Puritan poet was blind at the time, and\r\nit is not certain that he ever saw or heard the poems; yet there are many\r\nparallelisms in the earlier and later works which warrant the conclusion\r\nthat Milton was influenced by Cædmon's work.]\r\n\r\nCYNEWULF (EIGHTH CENTURY). There is a variety of poems belonging to the\r\nCynewulf Cycle, and of some of these Cynewulf (born _cir_. 750) was\r\ncertainly the author, since he wove his name into the verses in the manner\r\nof an acrostic. Of Cynewulf's life we know nothing with certainty; but from\r\nvarious poems which are attributed to him, and which undoubtedly reflect\r\nsome personal experience, scholars have constructed the following\r\nbiography,--which may or may not be true.\r\n\r\nIn his early life Cynewulf was probably a wandering scop of the old pagan\r\nkind, delighting in wild nature, in adventure, in the clamor of fighting\r\nmen. To this period belong his \"Riddles\" [Footnote: These riddles are\r\nancient conundrums, in which some familiar object, such as a bow, a ship, a\r\nstorm lashing the shore, the moon riding the clouds like a Viking's boat,\r\nis described in poetic language, and the last line usually calls on the\r\nhearer to name the object described. See Cook and Tinker, _Translations\r\nfrom Old English Poetry_.] and his vigorous descriptions of the sea and\r\nof battle, which show hardly a trace of Christian influence. Then came\r\ntrouble to Cynewulf, perhaps in the ravages of the Danes, and some deep\r\nspiritual experience of which he writes in a way to remind us of the\r\nPuritan age:\r\n\r\n    \"In the prison of the night I pondered with myself. I was stained\r\n    with my own deeds, bound fast in my sins, hard smitten with\r\n    sorrows, walled in by miseries.\"\r\n\r\nA wondrous vision of the cross, \"brightest of beacons,\" shone suddenly\r\nthrough his darkness, and led him forth into light and joy. Then he wrote\r\nhis \"Vision of the Rood\" and probably also _Juliana_ and _The\r\nChrist_. In the last period of his life, a time of great serenity, he\r\nwrote _Andreas_, a story of St. Andrew combining religious instruction\r\nwith extraordinary adventure; _Elene_, which describes the search for\r\nthe cross on which Christ died, and which is a prototype of the search for\r\nthe Holy Grail; and other poems of the same general kind. [Footnote: There\r\nis little agreement among scholars as to who wrote most of these poems. The\r\nonly works to which Cynewulf signs his name are _The Christ_,\r\n_Elene_, _Juliana_ and _Fates of the Apostles_. All others\r\nare doubtful, and our biography of Cynewulf is largely a matter of pleasant\r\nspeculation.] Aside from the value of these works as a reflection of\r\nAnglo-Saxon ideals, they are our best picture of Christianity as it\r\nappeared in England during the eighth and ninth centuries.\r\n\r\nALFRED THE GREAT (848-901). We shall understand the importance of Alfred's\r\nwork if we remember how his country fared when he became king of the West\r\nSaxons, in 871. At that time England lay at the mercy of the Danish\r\nsea-rovers. Soon after Bede's death they fell upon Northumbria, hewed out\r\nwith their swords a place of settlement, and were soon lords of the whole\r\nnorth country. Being pagans (\"Thor's men\" they called themselves) they\r\nsacked the monasteries, burned the libraries, made a lurid end of the\r\ncivilization which men like Columb and Bede had built up in\r\nNorth-Humberland. Then they pushed southward, and were in process of\r\npaganizing all England when they were turned back by the heroism of Alfred.\r\nHow he accomplished his task, and how from his capital at Winchester he\r\nestablished law and order in England, is recorded in the histories. We are\r\ndealing here with literature, and in this field Alfred is distinguished in\r\ntwo ways: first, by his preservation of early English poetry; and second,\r\nby his own writing, which earned for him the title of father of English\r\nprose. Finding that some fragments of poetry had escaped the fire of the\r\nDanes, he caused search to be made for old manuscripts, and had copies made\r\nof all that were legible. [Footnote: These copies were made in Alfred's\r\ndialect (West Saxon) not in the Northumbrian dialect in which they were\r\nfirst written.] But what gave Alfred deepest concern was that in all his\r\nkingdom there were few priests and no laymen who could read or write their\r\nown language. As he wrote sadly:\r\n\r\n    \"King Alfred sends greeting to Bishop Werfrith in words of love and\r\n    friendship. Let it be known to thee that it often comes to my mind\r\n    what wise men and what happy times were formerly in England, ... I\r\n    remember what I saw before England had been ravaged and burned, how\r\n    churches throughout the whole land were filled with treasures of\r\n    books. And there was also a multitude of God's servants, but these\r\n    had no knowledge of the books: they could not understand them\r\n    because they were not written in their own language. It was as if\r\n    the books said, 'Our fathers who once occupied these places loved\r\n    wisdom, and through it they obtained wealth and left it to us. We\r\n    see here their footprints, but we cannot follow them, and therefore\r\n    have we lost both their wealth and their wisdom, because we would\r\n    not incline our hearts to their example.' When I remember this, I\r\n    marvel that good and wise men who were formerly in England, and who\r\n    had learned these books, did not translate them into their own\r\n    language. Then I answered myself and said, 'They never thought that\r\n    their children would be so careless, or that learning would so\r\n    decay.'\" [Footnote: A free version of part of Alfred's preface to\r\n    his translation of Pope Gregory's _Cura Pastoralis_, which\r\n    appeared in English as the Hirdeboc or Shepherd's Book.]\r\n\r\nTo remedy the evil, Alfred ordered that every freeborn Englishman should\r\nlearn to read and write his own language; but before he announced the order\r\nhe followed it himself. Rather late in his boyhood he had learned to spell\r\nout an English book; now with immense difficulty he took up Latin, and\r\ntranslated the best works for the benefit of his people. His last notable\r\nwork was the famous _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANGLO-SAXON CHRONICLE]\r\n\r\nAt that time it was customary in monasteries to keep a record of events\r\nwhich seemed to the monks of special importance, such as the coming of a\r\nbishop, the death of a king, an eclipse of the moon, a battle with the\r\nDanes. Alfred found such a record at Winchester, rewrote it (or else caused\r\nit to be rewritten) with numerous additions from Bede's History and other\r\nsources, and so made a fairly complete chronicle of England. This was sent\r\nto other monasteries, where it was copied and enlarged, so that several\r\ndifferent versions have come down to us. The work thus begun was continued\r\nafter Alfred's death, until 1154, and is the oldest contemporary history\r\npossessed by any modern nation in its own language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANGLO-NORMAN OR MIDDLE-ENGLISH PERIOD (1066-1350)\r\n\r\nSPECIMENS OF THE LANGUAGE. A glance at the following selections will show\r\nhow Anglo-Saxon was slowly approaching our English speech of to-day. The\r\nfirst is from a religious book called _Ancren Riwle_ (Rule of the\r\nAnchoresses, _cir_. 1225). The second, written about a century later,\r\nis from the riming chronicle, or verse history, of Robert Manning or Robert\r\nof Brunne. In it we note the appearance of rime, a new thing in English\r\npoetry, borrowed from the French, and also a few words, such as \"solace,\"\r\nwhich are of foreign origin:\r\n\r\n    \"Hwoso hevide iseid to Eve, theo heo werp hire eien therone, 'A!\r\n    wend te awei; thu worpest eien o thi death!' hwat heved heo\r\n    ionswered? 'Me leove sire, ther havest wouh. Hwarof kalenges tu me?\r\n    The eppel that ich loke on is forbode me to etene, and nout forto\r\n    biholden.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Whoso had said (or, if anyone had said) to Eve when she cast her\r\n    eye theron (i.e. on the apple) 'Ah! turn thou away; thou castest\r\n    eyes on thy death!' what would she have answered? 'My dear sir,\r\n    thou art wrong. Of what blamest thou me? The apple which I look\r\n    upon is forbidden me to eat, not to behold.'\"\r\n\r\n  Lordynges that be now here,\r\n  If ye wille listene and lere [1]\r\n  All the story of Inglande,\r\n  Als Robert Mannyng wryten it fand,\r\n  And on Inglysch has it schewed,\r\n  Not for the lered [2] but for the lewed, [3]\r\n  For tho that on this land wonn [4]\r\n  That ne Latin ne Frankys conn, [5]\r\n  For to hauf solace and gamen\r\n  In felauschip when they sitt samen; [6]\r\n  And it is wisdom for to wytten [7]\r\n  The state of the land, and haf it wryten.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: learn]\r\n  [Footnote 2: learned]\r\n  [Footnote 3: simple or ignorant]\r\n  [Footnote 4: those that dwell]\r\n  [Footnote 5: That neither Latin nor French know]\r\n  [Footnote 6: together]\r\n  [Footnote 7: know]\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN CONQUEST. For a century after the Norman conquest native poetry\r\ndisappeared from England, as a river may sink into the earth to reappear\r\nelsewhere with added volume and new characteristics. During all this time\r\nFrench was the language not only of literature but of society and business;\r\nand if anyone had declared at the beginning of the twelfth century, when\r\nNorman institutions were firmly established in England, that the time was\r\napproaching when the conquerors would forget their fatherland and their\r\nmother tongue, he would surely have been called dreamer or madman. Yet the\r\nunexpected was precisely what happened, and the Norman conquest is\r\nremarkable alike for what it did and for what it failed to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMESDAY BOOK\r\nFrom a facsimile edition published in 1862.\r\nThe volumes, two in number, were kept in the chest here shown]\r\n\r\nIt accomplished, first, the nationalization of England, uniting the petty\r\nSaxon earldoms into one powerful kingdom; and second, it brought into\r\nEnglish life, grown sad and stern, like a man without hope, the spirit of\r\nyouth, of enthusiasm, of eager adventure after the unknown,--in a word, the\r\nspirit of romance, which is but another name for that quest of some Holy\r\nGrail in which youth is forever engaged.\r\n\r\nNORMAN LITERATURE. One who reads the literature that the conquerors brought\r\nto England must be struck by the contrast between the Anglo-Saxon and the\r\nNorman-French spirit. For example, here is the death of a national hero as\r\nportrayed in _The Song of Roland_, an old French epic, which the\r\nNormans first put into polished verse:\r\n\r\n  Li quens Rollans se jut desuz un pin,\r\n  Envers Espaigne en ad turnet son vis,\r\n  De plusurs choscs a remembrer le prist....\r\n\r\n    \"Then Roland placed himself beneath a pine tree. Towards Spain he\r\n    turned his face. Of many things took he remembrance: of various\r\n    lands where he had made conquests; of sweet France and his kindred;\r\n    of Charlemagne, his feudal lord, who had nurtured him. He could not\r\n    refrain from sighs and tears; neither could he forget himself in\r\n    need. He confessed his sins and besought the Lord's mercy. He\r\n    raised his right glove and offered it to God; Saint Gabriel from\r\n    his hand received the offering. Then upon his breast he bowed his\r\n    head; he joined his hands and went to his end. God sent down his\r\n    cherubim, and Saint Michael who delivers from peril. Together with\r\n    Saint Gabriel they departed, bearing the Count's soul to Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not put Roland's ceremonious exit into rime and meter; neither do\r\nwe offer any criticism of a scene in which the death of a national hero\r\nstirs no interest or emotion, not even with the help of Gabriel and the\r\ncherubim. One is reminded by contrast of Scyld, who fares forth alone in\r\nhis Viking ship to meet the mystery of death; or of that last scene of\r\nhuman grief and grandeur in _Beowulf_ where a few thanes bury their\r\ndead chief on a headland by the gray sea, riding their war steeds around\r\nthe memorial mound with a chant of sorrow and victory.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is even more marked in the mass of Norman literature: in\r\nromances of the maidens that sink underground in autumn, to reappear as\r\nflowers in spring; of Alexander's journey to the bottom of the sea in a\r\ncrystal barrel, to view the mermaids and monsters; of Guy of Warwick, who\r\nslew the giant Colbrant and overthrew all the knights of Europe, just to\r\nwin a smile from his Felice; of that other hero who had offended his lady\r\nby forgetting one of the commandments of love, and who vowed to fill a\r\nbarrel with his tears, and did it. The Saxons were as serious in speech as\r\nin action, and their poetry is a true reflection of their daily life; but\r\nthe Normans, brave and resourceful as they were in war and statesmanship,\r\nturned to literature for amusement, and indulged their lively fancy in\r\nfables, satires, garrulous romances, like children reveling in the lore of\r\nelves and fairies. As the prattle of a child was the power that awakened\r\nSilas Marner from his stupor of despair, so this Norman element of gayety,\r\nof exuberant romanticism, was precisely what was needed to rouse the\r\nsterner Saxon mind from its gloom and lethargy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NORMAN STAIR, CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\nTHE NEW NATION. So much, then, the Normans accomplished: they brought\r\nnationality into English life, and romance into English literature. Without\r\nessentially changing the Saxon spirit they enlarged its thought, aroused\r\nits hope, gave it wider horizons. They bound England with their laws,\r\ncovered it with their feudal institutions, filled it with their ideas and\r\ntheir language; then, as an anticlimax, they disappeared from English\r\nhistory, and their institutions were modified to suit the Saxon\r\ntemperament. The race conquered in war became in peace the conquerors. The\r\nNormans speedily forgot France, and even warred against it. They began to\r\nspeak English, dropping its cumbersome Teutonic inflections, and adding to\r\nit the wealth of their own fine language. They ended by adopting England as\r\ntheir country, and glorifying it above all others. \"There is no land in the\r\nworld,\" writes a poet of the thirteenth century, \"where so many good kings\r\nand saints have lived as in the isle of the English. Some were holy martyrs\r\nwho died cheerfully for God; others had strength or courage like to that of\r\nArthur, Edmund and Cnut.\"\r\n\r\nThis poet, who was a Norman monk at Westminster Abbey, wrote about the\r\nglories of England in the French language, and celebrated as the national\r\nheroes a Celt, a Saxon and a Dane. [Footnote: The significance of this old\r\npoem was pointed out by Jusserand, _Literary History of the English\r\nPeople_, Vol. I, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nSo in the space of two centuries a new nation had arisen, combining the\r\nbest elements of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French people, with a\r\nconsiderable mixture of Celtic and Danish elements. Out of the union of\r\nthese races and tongues came modern English life and letters.\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY AND THE LEGENDS OF ARTHUR. Geoffrey of Monmouth was a Welshman,\r\nfamiliar from his youth with Celtic legends; also he was a monk who knew\r\nhow to write Latin; and the combination was a fortunate one, as we shall\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nLong before Geoffrey produced his celebrated History (_cir._ 1150),\r\nmany stories of the Welsh hero Arthur [Footnote: Who Arthur was has never\r\nbeen determined. There was probably a chieftain of that name who was active\r\nin opposing the Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain, about the year 500; but\r\nGildas, who wrote a Chronicle of Britain only half a century later, does\r\nnot mention him; neither does Bede, who made study of all available records\r\nbefore writing his History. William of Malmesbury, a chronicler of the\r\ntwelfth century, refers to \"the warlike Arthur of whom the Britons tell so\r\nmany extravagant fables, a man to be celebrated not in idle tales but in\r\ntrue history.\" He adds that there were two Arthurs, one a Welsh war-chief\r\n(not a king), and the other a myth or fairy creation. This, then, may be\r\nthe truth of the matter, that a real Arthur, who made a deep impression on\r\nthe Celtic imagination, was soon hidden in a mass of spurious legends. That\r\nBede had heard these legends is almost certain; that he did not mention\r\nthem is probably due to the fact that he considered Arthur to be wholly\r\nmythical.] were current in Britain and on the Continent; but they were\r\nnever written because of a custom of the Middle Ages which required that,\r\nbefore a legend could be recorded, it must have the authority of some Latin\r\nmanuscript. Geoffrey undertook to supply such authority in his _Historia\r\nregum britanniae_, or History of the Kings of Britain, in which he\r\nproved Arthur's descent from Roman ancestors. [Footnote: After the landing\r\nof the Romans in Britain a curious mingling of traditions took place, and\r\nin Geoffrey's time native Britons considered themselves as children of\r\nBrutus of Rome, and therefore as grandchildren of Æneas of Troy.] He quoted\r\nliberally from an ancient manuscript which, he alleged, established\r\nArthur's lineage, but which he did not show to others. A storm instantly\r\narose among the writers of that day, most of whom denounced Geoffrey's\r\nLatin manuscript as a myth, and his History as a shameless invention. But\r\nhe had shrewdly anticipated such criticism, and issued this warning to the\r\nhistorians, which is solemn or humorous according to your point of view:\r\n\r\n    \"I forbid William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon to speak of\r\n    the kings of Britain, since they have not seen the book which\r\n    Walter Archdeacon of Oxford [who was dead, of course] brought out\r\n    of Brittany.\"\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that Geoffrey was an impostor, but in such matters\r\none should be wary of passing judgment. Many records of men, cities,\r\nempires, have suddenly arisen from the tombs to put to shame the scientists\r\nwho had denied their existence; and it is possible that Geoffrey had seen\r\none of the legion of lost manuscripts. The one thing certain is, that if he\r\nhad any authority for his History he embellished the same freely from\r\npopular legends or from his own imagination, as was customary at that time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHURIAN ROMANCES]\r\n\r\nHis work made a sensation. A score of French poets seized upon his\r\nArthurian legends and wove them into romances, each adding freely to\r\nGeoffrey's narrative. The poet Wace added the tale of the Round Table, and\r\nanother poet (Walter Map, perhaps) began a cycle of stories concerning\r\nGalahad and the quest of the Holy Grail. [Footnote: The Holy Grail, or San\r\nGraal, or Sancgreal, was represented as the cup from which Christ drank\r\nwith his disciples at the Last Supper. Legend said that the sacred cup had\r\nbeen brought to England, and Arthur's knights undertook, as the most\r\ncompelling of all duties, to search until they found it.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of these Arthurian romances, which reappear so often in English\r\npoetry, is forever shrouded in mystery. The point to remember is, that we\r\nowe them all to the genius of the native Celts; that it was Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth who first wrote them in Latin prose, and so preserved a treasure\r\nwhich else had been lost; and that it was the French _trouvères,_ or\r\npoets, who completed the various cycles of romances which were later\r\ncollected in Malory's _Morte d' Arthur._\r\n\r\nTYPES OF MIDDLE-ENGLISH LITERATURE. It has long been customary to begin the\r\nstudy of English literature with Chaucer; but that does not mean that he\r\ninvented any new form of poetry or prose. To examine any collection of our\r\nearly literature, such as Cook's _Middle-English Reader_, is to\r\ndiscover that many literary types were flourishing in Chaucer's day, and\r\nthat some of these had grown old-fashioned before he began to use them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: METRICAL ROMANCES]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, for example, the favorite type of literature in\r\nEngland was the metrical romance, which was introduced by the French poets,\r\nand written at first in the French language. The typical romance was a\r\nrambling story dealing with the three subjects of love, chivalry and\r\nreligion; it was filled with adventures among giants, dragons, enchanted\r\ncastles; and in that day romance was not romance unless liberally supplied\r\nwith magic and miracle. There were hundreds of such wonder-stories,\r\narranged loosely in three main groups: the so-called \"matter of Rome\" dealt\r\nwith the fall of Troy in one part, and with the marvelous adventures of\r\nAlexander in the other; the \"matter of France\" celebrated the heroism of\r\nCharlemagne and his Paladins; and the \"matter of Britain\" wove the magic\r\nweb of romance around Arthur and his knights of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nOne of the best of the metrical romances is \"Sir Gawain and the Green\r\nKnight,\" which may be read as a measure of all the rest. If, as is commonly\r\nbelieved, the unknown author of \"Sir Gawain\" wrote also \"The Pearl\" (a\r\nbeautiful old elegy, or poem of grief, which immortalizes a father's love\r\nfor his little girl), he was the greatest poet of the early Middle-English\r\nperiod. Unfortunately for us, he wrote not in the king's English or speech\r\nof London (which became modern English) but in a different dialect, and his\r\npoems should be read in a present-day version; else will the beauty of his\r\nwork be lost in our effort to understand his language.\r\n\r\nOther types of early literature are the riming chronicles or verse\r\nhistories (such as Layamon's _Brut_, a famous poem, in which the\r\nArthurian legends appear as part of English history), stories of travel,\r\ntranslations, religious poems, books of devotion, miracle plays, fables,\r\nsatires, ballads, hymns, lullabies, lyrics of love and nature,--an\r\nastonishing collection for so ancient a time, indicative at once of our\r\nchanging standards of poetry and of our unchanging human nature. For the\r\nfeelings which inspired or gave welcome to these poems, some five or six\r\nhundred years ago, are precisely the same feelings which warm the heart of\r\na poet and his readers to-day. There is nothing ancient but the spelling in\r\nthis exquisite Lullaby, for instance, which was sung on Christmas eve:\r\n\r\n  He cam also stylle\r\n    Ther his moder was\r\n  As dew in Aprylle\r\n    That fallyt on the gras;\r\n  He cam also stylle\r\n    To his moderes bowr\r\n  As dew in Aprylle\r\n    That fallyt on the flour;\r\n  He cam also stylle\r\n    Ther his moder lay\r\n  As dew in Aprylle\r\n    That fallyt on the spray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In reading this beautiful old lullaby the _e_ in \"stylle\"\r\nand \"Aprylle\" should be lightly sounded, like _a_ in \"China.\"]\r\n\r\nOr witness this other fragment from an old love song, which reflects the\r\nfeeling of one who \"would fain make some mirth\" but who finds his heart sad\r\nwithin him:\r\n\r\n  Now wold I fayne som myrthis make\r\n  All oneli for my ladys sake,\r\n    When I hir se;\r\n  But now I am so ferre from hir\r\n    Hit will nat be.\r\n\r\n  Thogh I be long out of hir sight,\r\n  I am hir man both day and night,\r\n    And so will be;\r\n  Wherfor, wold God as I love hir\r\n    That she lovd me!\r\n\r\n  When she is mery, then I am glad;\r\n  When she is sory, then am I sad,\r\n    And causë whi:\r\n  For he livith nat that lovith hir\r\n    So well as I.\r\n\r\n  She sayth that she hath seen hit wreten\r\n  That 'seldyn seen is soon foryeten.'\r\n    Hit is nat so;\r\n  For in good feith, save oneli hir,\r\n    I love no moo.\r\n\r\n  Wherfor I pray, both night and day,\r\n  That she may cast al care away,\r\n    And leve in rest\r\n  That evermo, where'er she be,\r\n    I love hir best;\r\n\r\n  And I to hir for to be trew,\r\n  And never chaunge her for noon new\r\n    Unto myne ende;\r\n  And that I may in hir servise\r\n    For evyr amend.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The two poems quoted above hardly belong to the Norman-French\r\nperiod proper, but rather to a time when the Anglo-Saxon had assimilated\r\nthe French element, with its language and verse forms. They were written,\r\nprobably, in the age of Chaucer, or in what is now called the Late\r\nMiddle-English period.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY OF BEGINNINGS. The two main branches of our literature are\r\n    the Anglo-Saxon and the Norman-French, both of which received some\r\n    additions from Celtic, Danish and Roman sources. The Anglo-Saxon\r\n    literature came to England with the invasion of Teutonic tribes,\r\n    the Angles, Saxons and Jutes (_cir._ 449). The Norman-French\r\n    literature appeared after the Norman conquest of England, which\r\n    began with the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\r\n\r\n    The Anglo-Saxon literature is classified under two heads, pagan and\r\n    Christian. The extant fragments of pagan literature include one\r\n    epic or heroic poem, _Beowulf_, and several lyrics and battle\r\n    songs, such as \"Widsith,\" \"Deor's Lament,\" \"The Seafarer,\" \"The\r\n    Battle of Brunanburh\" and \"The Battle of Maldon.\" All these were\r\n    written at an unknown date, and by unknown poets.\r\n\r\n    The best Christian literature of the period was written in the\r\n    Northumbrian and the West-Saxon schools. The greatest names of the\r\n    Northumbrian school are Bede, Cædmon and Cynewulf. The most famous\r\n    of the Wessex writers is Alfred the Great, who is called \"the\r\n    father of English prose.\"\r\n\r\n    The Normans were originally Northmen, or sea rovers from\r\n    Scandinavia, who settled in northern France and adopted the\r\n    Franco-Latin language and civilization. With their conquest of\r\n    England, in the eleventh century, they brought nationality into\r\n    English life, and the spirit of romance into English literature.\r\n    Their stories in prose or verse were extremely fanciful, in marked\r\n    contrast with the stern, somber poetry of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n    The most notable works of the Norman-French period are: Geoffrey's\r\n    _History of the Kings of Britain_, which preserved in Latin\r\n    prose the native legends of King Arthur; Layamon's _Brut_, a\r\n    riming chronicle or verse history in the native tongue; many\r\n    metrical romances, or stories of love, chivalry, magic and\r\n    religion; and various popular songs and ballads. The greatest poet\r\n    of the period is the unknown author of \"Sir Gawain and the Green\r\n    Knight\" (a metrical romance) and probably also of \"The Pearl,\" a\r\n    beautiful elegy, which is our earliest _In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING. Without special study of Old English it is\r\n    impossible to read our earliest literature. The beginner may,\r\n    however, enter into the spirit of that literature by means of\r\n    various modern versions, such as the following:\r\n\r\n    _Beowulf_. Garnett's Beowulf (Ginn and Company), a literal\r\n    translation, is useful to those who study Anglo-Saxon, but is not\r\n    very readable. The same may be said of Gummere's The Oldest English\r\n    Epic, which follows the verse form of the original. Two of the best\r\n    versions for the beginner are Child's Beowulf, in Riverside\r\n    Literature Series (Houghton), and Earle's The Deeds of Beowulf\r\n    (Clarendon Press).\r\n\r\n    _Anglo-Saxon Poetry_. The Seafarer, The Wanderer, The\r\n    Husband's Message (or Love Letter), Deor's Lament, Riddles, Battle\r\n    of Brunanburh, selections from The Christ, Andreas, Elene, Vision\r\n    of the Rood, and The Phoenix,--all these are found in an excellent\r\n    little volume, Cook and Tinker, Translations from Old English\r\n    Poetry (Ginn and Company).\r\n\r\n    _Anglo-Saxon Prose_. Good selections in Cook and Tinker,\r\n    Translations from Old English Prose (Ginn and Company). Bede's\r\n    History, translated in Everyman's Library (Dutton) and in the Bohn\r\n    Library (Macmillan). In the same volume of the Bohn Library is a\r\n    translation of The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Alfred's Orosius (with\r\n    stories of early exploration) translated in Pauli's Life of Alfred.\r\n\r\n    _Norman-French Period_. Selections in Manly, English Poetry,\r\n    and English Prose (Ginn and Company); also in Morris and Skeat,\r\n    Specimens of Early English (Clarendon Press). The Song of Roland in\r\n    Riverside Literature Series, and in King's Classics. Selected\r\n    metrical romances in Ellis, Specimens of Early English Metrical\r\n    Romances (Bohn Library); also in Morley, Early English Prose\r\n    Romances, and in Carisbrooke Library Series. Sir Gawain and the\r\n    Green Knight, modernized by Weston, in Arthurian Romances Series.\r\n    Andrew Lang, Aucassin and Nicolette (Crowell). The Pearl,\r\n    translated by Jewett (Crowell), and by Weir Mitchell (Century).\r\n    Selections from Layamon's Brut in Morley, English Writers, Vol.\r\n    III. Geoffrey's History in Everyman's Library, and in King's\r\n    Classics. The Arthurian legends in The Mabinogion (Everyman's\r\n    Library); also in Sidney Lanier's The Boy's King Arthur and The\r\n    Boy's Mabinogion (Scribner). A good single volume containing the\r\n    best of Middle-English literature, with notes, is Cook, A Literary\r\n    Middle-English Reader (Ginn and Company).\r\n\r\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Our first selection, from _Piers Plowman_\r\n(_cir._ 1362), is the satire of Belling the Cat. The language is that\r\nof the common people, and the verse is in the old Saxon manner, with accent\r\nand alliteration. The scene is a council of rats and mice (common people)\r\ncalled to consider how best to deal with the cat (court), and it satirizes\r\nthe popular agitators who declaim against the government. The speaker is a\r\nrat, \"a raton of renon, most renable of tonge\":\r\n\r\n  \"I have y-seen segges,\" quod he,\r\n    \"in the cite of London\r\n  Beren beighes ful brighte\r\n    abouten here nekkes....\r\n  Were there a belle on here beighe,\r\n    certes, as me thynketh,\r\n  Men myghte wite where thei went,\r\n    and awei renne!\r\n  And right so,\" quod this raton,\r\n    \"reson me sheweth\r\n  To bugge a belle of brasse\r\n    or of brighte sylver,\r\n  And knitten on a colere\r\n    for owre comune profit,\r\n  And hangen it upon the cattes hals;\r\n    than hear we mowen\r\n  Where he ritt or rest\r\n    or renneth to playe.\" ...\r\n  Alle this route of ratones\r\n    to this reson thei assented;\r\n  Ac tho the belle was y-bought\r\n    and on the beighe hanged,\r\n  Ther ne was ratoun in alle the route,\r\n    for alle the rewme of Fraunce,\r\n  That dorst have y-bounden the belle\r\n    aboute the cattis nekke.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"I have seen creatures\" (dogs), quoth he,\r\n    \"in the city of London\r\n  Bearing collars full bright\r\n    around their necks....\r\n  Were there a bell on those collars,\r\n    assuredly, in my opinion,\r\n  One might know where the dogs go,\r\n    and run away from them!\r\n  And right so,\" quoth this rat,\r\n    \"reason suggests to me\r\n  To buy a bell of brass\r\n    or of bright silver,\r\n  And tie it on a collar\r\n    for our common profit,\r\n  And hang it on the cat's neck;\r\n    in order that we may hear\r\n  Where he rides or rests\r\n    or runneth to play.\" ...\r\n  All this rout (crowd) of rats\r\n    to this reasoning assented;\r\n  But when the bell was bought\r\n    and hanged on the collar,\r\n  There was not a rat in the crowd\r\n    that, for all the realm of France\r\n  Would have dared to bind the bell\r\n    about the cat's neck.\r\n\r\nThe second selection is from Chaucer's \"Wife of Bath's Tale\" (_cir_.\r\n1375). It was written \"in the French manner\" with rime and meter, for the\r\nupper classes, and shows the difference between literary English and the\r\nspeech of the common people:\r\n\r\n  In th' olde dayës of the Kyng Arthour,\r\n  Of which that Britons speken greet honour,\r\n  Al was this land fulfild of fayerye.\r\n  The elf-queene with hir joly companye\r\n  Dauncëd ful ofte in many a grene mede;\r\n  This was the olde opinion, as I rede.\r\n  I speke of manye hundred yeres ago;\r\n  But now kan no man see none elves mo.\r\n\r\nThe next two selections (written _cir_. 1450) show how rapidly the\r\nlanguage was approaching modern English. The prose, from Malory's _Morte\r\nd' Arthur_, is the selection that Tennyson closely followed in his\r\n\"Passing of Arthur.\" The poetry, from the ballad of \"Robin Hood and the\r\nMonk,\" is probably a fifteenth-century version of a much older English\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n    \"'Therefore,' sayd Arthur unto Syr Bedwere, 'take thou Excalybur my\r\n    good swerde, and goo with it, to yonder water syde, and whan thou\r\n    comest there I charge the throwe my swerde in that water, and come\r\n    ageyn and telle me what thou there seest.'\r\n\r\n    \"'My lord,' sayd Bedwere, 'your commaundement shal be doon, and\r\n    lyghtly brynge you worde ageyn.'\r\n\r\n    \"So Syr Bedwere departed; and by the waye he behelde that noble\r\n    swerde, that the pomel and the hafte was al of precyous stones; and\r\n    thenne he sayd to hym self, 'Yf I throwe this ryche swerde in the\r\n    water, thereof shal never come good, but harme and losse.' And\r\n    thenne Syr Bedwere hydde Excalybur under a tree.\"\r\n\r\n  In somer, when the shawes be sheyne,\r\n    And leves be large and long,\r\n  Hit is full mery in feyr foreste\r\n    To here the foulys song:\r\n\r\n  To se the dere draw to the dale,\r\n    And leve the hillës hee,\r\n  And shadow hem in the levës grene,\r\n    Under the grene-wode tre.\r\n\r\n    HISTORICAL OUTLINE. The history of England during this period is\r\n    largely a record of strife and confusion. The struggle of the House\r\n    of Commons against the despotism of kings; the Hundred Years War\r\n    with France, in which those whose fathers had been Celts, Danes,\r\n    Saxons, Normans, were now fighting shoulder to shoulder as\r\n    Englishmen all; the suffering of the common people, resulting in\r\n    the Peasant Rebellion; the barbarity of the nobles, who were\r\n    destroying one another in the Wars of the Roses; the beginning of\r\n    commerce and manufacturing, following the lead of Holland, and the\r\n    rise of a powerful middle class; the belated appearance of the\r\n    Renaissance, welcomed by a few scholars but unnoticed by the masses\r\n    of people, who remained in dense ignorance,--even such a brief\r\n    catalogue suggests that many books must be read before we can enter\r\n    into the spirit of fourteenth-century England. We shall note here\r\n    only two circumstances, which may help us to understand Chaucer and\r\n    the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: MODERN PROBLEMS]\r\n\r\n    The first is that the age of Chaucer, if examined carefully, shows\r\n    many striking resemblances to our own. It was, for example, an age\r\n    of warfare; and, as in our own age of hideous inventions, military\r\n    methods were all upset by the discovery that the foot soldier with\r\n    his blunderbuss was more potent than the panoplied knight on\r\n    horseback. While war raged abroad, there was no end of labor\r\n    troubles at home, strikes, \"lockouts,\" assaults on imported workmen\r\n    (the Flemish weavers brought in by Edward III), and no end of\r\n    experimental laws to remedy the evil. The Turk came into Europe,\r\n    introducing the Eastern and the Balkan questions, which have ever\r\n    since troubled us. Imperialism was rampant, in Edward's claim to\r\n    France, for example, or in John of Gaunt's attempt to annex\r\n    Castile. Even \"feminism\" was in the air, and its merits were\r\n    shrewdly debated by Chaucer's Wife of Bath and his Clerk of\r\n    Oxenford. A dozen other \"modern\" examples might be given, but the\r\n    sum of the matter is this: that there is hardly a social or\r\n    political or economic problem of the past fifty years that was not\r\n    violently agitated in the latter half of the fourteenth century.\r\n    [Footnote: See Kittredge, _Chaucer and his Poetry_ (1915), pp.\r\n    2-5.]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: REALISTIC POETRY]\r\n\r\n    A second interesting circumstance is that this medieval age\r\n    produced two poets, Langland and Chaucer, who were more realistic\r\n    even than present-day writers in their portrayal of life, and who\r\n    together gave us such a picture of English society as no other\r\n    poets have ever equaled. Langland wrote his _Piers Plowman_ in\r\n    the familiar Anglo-Saxon style for the common people, and pictured\r\n    their life to the letter; while Chaucer wrote his _Canterbury\r\n    Tales_, a poem shaped after Italian and French models,\r\n    portraying the holiday side of the middle and upper classes.\r\n    Langland drew a terrible picture of a degraded land, desperately in\r\n    need of justice, of education, of reform in church and state;\r\n    Chaucer showed a gay company of pilgrims riding through a\r\n    prosperous country which he called his \"Merrie England.\" Perhaps\r\n    the one thing in common with these two poets, the early types of\r\n    Puritan and Cavalier, was their attitude towards democracy.\r\n    Langland preached the gospel of labor, far more powerfully than\r\n    Carlyle ever preached it, and exalted honest work as the patent of\r\n    nobility. Chaucer, writing for the court, mingled his characters in\r\n    the most democratic kind of fellowship and, though a knight rode at\r\n    the head of his procession, put into the mouth of the Wife of Bath\r\n    his definition of a gentleman:\r\n\r\n      Loke who that is most vertuous alway,\r\n      Privee and apert, [1] and most entendeth aye\r\n      To do the gentle dedes that he can,\r\n      And take him for the grettest gentilman.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote [1]: Secretly and openly.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY CHAUCER (_cir_. 1340-1400)\r\n\r\n  \"Of Chaucer truly I know not whether to marvel more, either that he in\r\n  that misty time could see so clearly, or that we in this clear age walk\r\n  so stumblingly after him.\"\r\n                                    (Philip Sidney, _cir_. 1581)\r\n\r\nIt was the habit of Old-English chieftains to take their scops with them\r\ninto battle, to the end that the scop's poem might be true to the outer\r\nworld of fact as well as to the inner world of ideals. The search for\r\n\"local color\" is, therefore, not the newest thing in fiction but the oldest\r\nthing in poetry. Chaucer, the first in time of our great English poets, was\r\ntrue to this old tradition. He was page, squire, soldier, statesman,\r\ndiplomat, traveler; and then he was a poet, who portrayed in verse the\r\nmany-colored life which he knew intimately at first hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAUCER]\r\n\r\nFor example, Chaucer had to describe a tournament, in the Knight's Tale;\r\nbut instead of using his imagination, as other romancers had always done,\r\nhe drew a vivid picture of one of those gorgeous pageants of decaying\r\nchivalry with which London diverted the French king, who had been brought\r\nprisoner to the city after the victory of the Black Prince at Poitiers. So\r\nwith his Tabard Inn, which is a real English inn, and with his Pilgrims,\r\nwho are real pilgrims; and so with every other scene or character he\r\ndescribed. His specialty was human nature, his strong point observation,\r\nhis method essentially modern. And by \"modern\" we mean that he portrayed\r\nthe men and women of his own day so well, with such sympathy and humor and\r\nwisdom, that we recognize and welcome them as friends or neighbors, who are\r\nthe same in all ages. From this viewpoint Chaucer is more modern than\r\nTennyson or Longfellow.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Chaucer's boyhood was spent in London, near Westminster,\r\n    where the brilliant court of Edward was visible to the favored\r\n    ones; and near the Thames, where the world's commerce, then\r\n    beginning to ebb and flow with the tides, might be seen of every\r\n    man. His father was a vintner, or wine merchant, who had enough\r\n    influence at court to obtain for his son a place in the house of\r\n    the Princess Elizabeth. Behold then our future poet beginning his\r\n    knightly training as page to a highborn lady. Presently he\r\n    accompanied the Black Prince to the French wars, was taken prisoner\r\n    and ransomed, and on his return entered the second stage of\r\n    knighthood as esquire or personal attendant to the king. He married\r\n    a maid of honor related to John of Gaunt, the famous Duke of\r\n    Lancaster, and at thirty had passed from the rank of merchant into\r\n    official and aristocratic circles.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PERIODS OF WORK]\r\n\r\n    The literary work of Chaucer is conveniently, but not accurately,\r\n    arranged in three different periods. While attached to the court,\r\n    one of his duties was to entertain the king and his visitors in\r\n    their leisure. French poems of love and chivalry were then in\r\n    demand, and of these Chaucer had great store; but English had\r\n    recently replaced French even at court, and King Edward and Queen\r\n    Philippa, both patrons of art and letters, encouraged Chaucer to\r\n    write in his native language. So he made translations of favorite\r\n    poems into English, and wrote others in imitation of French models.\r\n    These early works, the least interesting of all, belong to what is\r\n    called the period of French influence.\r\n\r\n    Then Chaucer, who had learned the art of silence as well as of\r\n    speech, was sent abroad on a series of diplomatic missions. In\r\n    Italy he probably met the poet Petrarch (as we infer from the\r\n    Prologue to the Clerk's Tale) and became familiar with the works of\r\n    Dante and Boccaccio. His subsequent poetry shows a decided advance\r\n    in range and originality, partly because of his own growth, no\r\n    doubt, and partly because of his better models. This second period,\r\n    of about fifteen years, is called the time of Italian influence.\r\n\r\n    In the third or English period Chaucer returned to London and was a\r\n    busy man of affairs; for at the English court, unlike those of\r\n    France and Italy, a poet was expected to earn his pension by some\r\n    useful work, literature being regarded as a recreation. He was in\r\n    turn comptroller of customs and superintendent of public works;\r\n    also he was at times well supplied with money, and again, as the\r\n    political fortunes of his patron John of Gaunt waned, in sore need\r\n    of the comforts of life. Witness his \"Complaint to His Empty\r\n    Purse,\" the humor of which evidently touched the king and brought\r\n    Chaucer another pension.\r\n\r\n    Two poems of this period are supposed to contain autobiographical\r\n    material. In the _Legend of Good Women_ he says:\r\n\r\n      And as for me, though that my wit be lytë,\r\n      On bokës for to rede I me delytë.\r\n\r\n    Again, in _The House of Fame_ he speaks of finding his real\r\n    life in books after his daily work in the customhouse is ended.\r\n    Some of the \"rekeninges\" (itemized accounts of goods and duties) to\r\n    which he refers are still preserved in Chaucer's handwriting:\r\n\r\n      For whan thy labour doon al is,\r\n      And hast y-maad thy rekeninges,\r\n      In stede of reste and newë thinges\r\n      Thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon,\r\n      And, also domb as any stoon,\r\n      Thou sittest at another boke\r\n      Til fully dawsëd is thy loke,\r\n      And livest thus as an hermytë,\r\n      Although thine abstinence is lytë.\r\n\r\n    Such are the scanty facts concerning England's first great poet,\r\n    the more elaborate biographies being made up chiefly of guesses or\r\n    doubtful inferences. He died in the year 1400, and was buried in\r\n    St. Benet's chapel in Westminster Abbey, a place now revered by all\r\n    lovers of literature as the Poets' Corner.\r\n\r\n    ON READING CHAUCER. Said Caxton, who was the first to print\r\n    Chaucer's poetry, \"He writeth no void words, but all his matter is\r\n    full of high and quick sentence.\" Caxton was right, and the modern\r\n    reader's first aim should be to get the sense of Chaucer rather\r\n    than his pronunciation. To understand him is not so difficult as\r\n    appears at first sight, for most of the words that look strange\r\n    because of their spelling will reveal their meaning to the ear if\r\n    spoken aloud. Thus the word \"leefful\" becomes \"leveful\" or\r\n    \"leaveful\" or \"permissible.\"\r\n\r\n    Next, the reader should remember that Chaucer was a master of\r\n    versification, and that every stanza of his is musical. At the\r\n    beginning of a poem, therefore, read a few lines aloud, emphasizing\r\n    the accented syllables until the rhythm is fixed; then make every\r\n    line conform to it, and every word keep step to the music. To do\r\n    this it is necessary to slur certain words and run others together;\r\n    also, since the mistakes of Chaucer's copyists are repeated in\r\n    modern editions, it is often necessary to add a helpful word or\r\n    syllable to a line, or to omit others that are plainly superfluous.\r\n\r\n    This way of reading Chaucer musically, as one would read any other\r\n    poet, has three advantages: it is easy, it is pleasant, and it is\r\n    far more effective than the learning of a hundred specifications\r\n    laid down by the grammarians.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: RULES FOR READING]\r\n\r\n    As for Chaucer's pronunciation, you will not get that accurately\r\n    without much study, which were better spent on more important\r\n    matters; so be content with a few rules, which aim simply to help\r\n    you enjoy the reading. As a general principle, the root vowel of a\r\n    word was broadly sounded, and the rest slurred over. The\r\n    characteristic sound of _a_ was as in \"far\"; _e_ was\r\n    sounded like _a_, _i_ like _e_, and all diphthongs\r\n    as broadly as possible,--in \"floures\" (flowers), for example, which\r\n    should be pronounced \"floorës.\"\r\n\r\n    Another rule relates to final syllables, and these will appear more\r\n    interesting if we remember that they represent the dying\r\n    inflections of nouns and adjectives, which were then declined as in\r\n    modern German. Final _ed_ and _es_ are variable, but the\r\n    rhythm will always tell us whether they should be given an extra\r\n    syllable or not. So also with final _e_, which is often\r\n    sounded, but not if the following word begins with a vowel or with\r\n    _h_. In the latter case the two words may be run together, as\r\n    in reading Virgil. If a final _e_ occurs at the end of a line,\r\n    it may be lightly pronounced, like _a_ in \"China,\" to give\r\n    added melody to the verse.\r\n\r\n    Applying these rules, and using our liberty as freely as Chaucer\r\n    used his, [Footnote: The language was changing rapidly in Chaucer's\r\n    day, and there were no printed books to fix a standard. Sometimes\r\n    Chaucer's grammar and spelling are according to rule, and again as\r\n    heaven pleases.] the opening lines of _The Canterbury Tales_\r\n    would read something like this:\r\n\r\n      Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote\r\n        _Whan that Apreelë with 'is shoorës sohtë_\r\n\r\n      The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,\r\n        _The drooth of March hath paarcëd to the rohtë_\r\n\r\n      And bathed every veyne in swich licour,\r\n        _And bahthëd ev'ree vyne in swech lecoor,_\r\n\r\n      Of which vertu engendred is the flour;\r\n        _Of whech varetu engendred is the floor;_\r\n\r\n      Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth\r\n        _Whan Zephirus aik with 'is swaite braith_\r\n\r\n      Inspired hath in every holt and heeth\r\n        _Inspeerëd hath in ev'ree holt and haith_\r\n\r\n      The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne\r\n        _The tendre croopës, and th' yoongë sonnë_\r\n\r\n      Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,\r\n        _Hath in the Ram 'is hawfë coors ironnë,_\r\n\r\n      And smale fowles maken melodye,\r\n        _And smawlë foolës mahken malyodieë,_\r\n\r\n      That slepen al the night with open ye\r\n        _That slaipen awl the nicht with open eë_\r\n\r\n      (So priketh hem nature in hir corages)\r\n        _(So priketh 'eem nahtur in hir coorahgës)_\r\n\r\n      Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages.\r\n        _Than longen folk to goon on peelgrimahgës._\r\n\r\nEARLY WORKS OF CHAUCER. In his first period, which was dominated by French\r\ninfluence, Chaucer probably translated parts of the _Roman de la\r\nRose_, a dreary allegorical poem in which love is represented as a\r\nqueen-rose in a garden, surrounded by her court and ministers. In\r\nendeavoring to pluck this rose the lover learns the \"commandments\" and\r\n\"sacraments\" of love, and meets with various adventures at the hands of\r\nVirtue, Constancy, and other shadowy personages of less repute. Such\r\nallegories were the delight of the Middle Ages; now they are as dust and\r\nashes. Other and better works of this period are _The Book of the\r\nDuchess_, an elegy written on the death of Blanche, wife of Chaucer's\r\npatron, and various minor poems, such as \"Compleynte unto Pitee,\" the\r\ndainty love song \"To Rosemunde,\" and \"Truth\" or the \"Ballad of Good\r\nCounsel.\"\r\n\r\nCharacteristic works of the second or Italian period are _The House of\r\nFame_, _The Legend of Good Women_, and especially _Troilus and\r\nCriseyde_. The last-named, though little known to modern readers, is one\r\nof the most remarkable narrative poems in our literature. It began as a\r\nretelling of a familiar romance; it ended in an original poem, which might\r\neasily be made into a drama or a \"modern\" novel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORY OF TROILUS]\r\n\r\n    The scene opens in Troy, during the siege of the city by the\r\n    Greeks. The hero Troilus is a son of Priam, and is second only to\r\n    the mighty Hector in warlike deeds. Devoted as he is to glory, he\r\n    scoffs at lovers until the moment when his eye lights on Cressida.\r\n    She is a beautiful young widow, and is free to do as she pleases\r\n    for the moment, her father Calchas having gone over to the Greeks\r\n    to escape the doom which he sees impending on Troy. Troilus falls\r\n    desperately in love with Cressida, but she does not know or care,\r\n    and he is ashamed to speak his mind after scoffing so long at love.\r\n    Then appears Pandarus, friend of Troilus and uncle to Cressida, who\r\n    soon learns the secret and brings the young people together. After\r\n    a long courtship with interminable speeches (as in the old\r\n    romances) Troilus wins the lady, and all goes happily until Calchas\r\n    arranges to have his daughter brought to him in exchange for a\r\n    captured Trojan warrior. The lovers are separated with many tears,\r\n    but Cressida comforts the despairing Troilus by promising to\r\n    hoodwink her doting father and return in a few days. Calchas,\r\n    however, loves his daughter too well to trust her in a city that\r\n    must soon be given over to plunder, and keeps her safe in the Greek\r\n    camp. There the handsome young Diomede wins her, and presently\r\n    Troilus is killed in battle by Achilles.\r\n\r\nSuch is the old romance of feminine fickleness, which had been written a\r\nhundred times before Chaucer took it bodily from Boccaccio. Moreover he\r\nhumored the old romantic delusion which required that a lover should fall\r\nsick in the absence of his mistress, and turn pale or swoon at the sight of\r\nher; but he added to the tale many elements not found in the old romances,\r\nsuch as real men and women, humor, pathos, analysis of human motives, and a\r\nsense of impending tragedy which comes not from the loss of wealth or\r\nhappiness but of character. Cressida's final thought of her first lover is\r\nintensely pathetic, and a whole chapter of psychology is summed up in the\r\nline in which she promises herself to be true to Diomede at the very moment\r\nwhen she is false to Troilus:\r\n\r\n  \"Allas! of me unto the worldës ende\r\n  Shal neyther ben ywríten nor y-songë\r\n  No good word; for these bookës wol me shende.\r\n  O, rollëd shal I ben on many a tongë!\r\n  Thurghout the world my bellë shal be rongë,\r\n  And wommen moste wol haten me of allë.\r\n  Allas, that swich a cas me sholdë fallë!\r\n  They wol seyn, in-as-much as in me is,\r\n  I have hem doon dishonour, weylawey!\r\n  Al be I not the firste that dide amis,\r\n  What helpeth that to doon my blame awey?\r\n  But since I see ther is no betre wey,\r\n  And that too late is now for me to rewé,\r\n  To Diomede, algate, I wol be trewé.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CANTERBURY TALES. The plan of gathering a company of people and letting\r\neach tell his favorite story has been used by so many poets, ancient and\r\nmodern, that it is idle to seek the origin of it. Like Topsy, it wasn't\r\nborn; it just grew up. Chaucer's plan, however, is more comprehensive than\r\nany other in that it includes all classes of society; it is also more\r\noriginal in that it does not invent heroic characters but takes such men\r\nand women as one might meet in any assembly, and shows how typical they are\r\nof humanity in all ages. As Lowell says, Chaucer made use in his\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ of two things that are everywhere regarded as\r\nsymbols of human life; namely, the short journey and the inn. We might add,\r\nas an indication of Chaucer's philosophy, that his inn is a comfortable\r\none, and that the journey is made in pleasant company and in fair weather.\r\n\r\n    An outline of Chaucer's great work is as follows. On an evening in\r\n    springtime the poet comes to Tabard Inn, in Southwark, and finds it\r\n    filled with a merry company of men and women bent on a pilgrimage\r\n    to the shrine of Thomas à Becket in Canterbury.\r\n\r\n    After supper appears the jovial host, Harry Bailey, who finds the\r\n    company so attractive that he must join it on its pilgrimage. He\r\n    proposes that, as they shall be long on the way, they shall furnish\r\n    their own entertainment by telling stories, the best tale to be\r\n    rewarded by the best of suppers when the pilgrims return from\r\n    Canterbury. They assent joyfully, and on the morrow begin their\r\n    journey, cheered by the Knight's Tale as they ride forth under the\r\n    sunrise. The light of morning and of springtime is upon this work,\r\n    which is commonly placed at the beginning of modern English\r\n    literature.\r\n\r\nAs the journey proceeds we note two distinct parts to Chaucer's record. One\r\npart, made up of prologues and interludes, portrays the characters and\r\naction of the present comedy; the other part, consisting of stories,\r\nreflects the comedies and tragedies of long ago. The one shows the\r\nperishable side of the men and women of Chaucer's day, their habits, dress,\r\nconversation; the other reveals an imperishable world of thought, feeling,\r\nideals, in which these same men and women discover their kinship to\r\nhumanity. It is possible, since some of the stories are related to each\r\nother, that Chaucer meant to arrange the _Canterbury Tales_ in\r\ndramatic unity, so as to make a huge comedy of human society; but the work\r\nas it comes down to us is fragmentary, and no one has discovered the order\r\nin which the fragments should be fitted together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILGRIMS SETTING OUT FROM THE \"TABARD\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROLOGUE]\r\n\r\nThe Prologue is perhaps the best single fragment of the _Canterbury\r\nTales_. In it Chaucer introduces us to the characters of his drama: to\r\nthe grave Knight and the gay Squire, the one a model of Chivalry at its\r\nbest, \"a verray parfit gentil knight,\" the other a young man so full of\r\nlife and love that \"he slept namore than dooth a nightingale\"; to the\r\nmodest Prioress, also, with her pretty clothes, her exquisite manners, her\r\nboarding-school accomplishments:\r\n\r\n  And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,\r\n  After the scole of Stratford attë Bowë,\r\n  For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowë.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this dainty figure is the coarse Wife of Bath, as garrulous\r\nas the nurse in _Romeo and Juliet_. So one character stands to another\r\nas shade to light, as they appear in a typical novel of Dickens. The\r\nChurch, the greatest factor in medieval life, is misrepresented by the\r\nhunting Monk and the begging Friar, and is well represented by the Parson,\r\nwho practiced true religion before he preached it:\r\n\r\n  But Christës lore and his apostles twelvë\r\n  He taughte, and first he folwëd it himselvë.\r\n\r\nTrade is represented by the Merchant, scholarship by the poor Clerk of\r\nOxenford, the professions by the Doctor and the Man-of-law, common folk by\r\nthe Yeoman, Frankelyn (farmer), Miller and many others of low degree.\r\nProminent among the latter was the Shipman:\r\n\r\n  Hardy he was, and wys to undertakë;\r\n  With many a tempest hadde his berd been shakë.\r\n\r\nFrom this character, whom Stevenson might have borrowed for his _Treasure\r\nIsland_, we infer the barbarity that prevailed when commerce was new,\r\nwhen the English sailor was by turns smuggler or pirate, equally ready to\r\nsail or scuttle a ship, and to silence any tongue that might tell tales by\r\nmaking its wretched owner \"walk the plank.\" Chaucer's description of the\r\nlatter process is a masterpiece of piratical humor:\r\n\r\n  If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond,\r\n  By water he sente hem hoom to every lond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIETY OF TALES]\r\n\r\nSome thirty pilgrims appear in the famous Prologue, and as each was to tell\r\ntwo stories on the way to Canterbury, and two more on the return, it is\r\nprobable that Chaucer contemplated a work of more than a hundred tales.\r\nOnly four-and-twenty were completed, but these are enough to cover the\r\nfield of light literature in that day, from the romance of love to the\r\nhumorous animal fable. Between these are wonder-stories of giants and\r\nfairies, satires on the monks, parodies on literature, and some examples of\r\ncoarse horseplay for which Chaucer offers an apology, saying that he must\r\nlet each pilgrim tell his tale in his own way.\r\n\r\nA round dozen of these tales may still be read with pleasure; but, as a\r\nsuggestion of Chaucer's variety, we name only three: the Knight's romance\r\nof \"Palamon and Arcite,\" the Nun's Priest's fable of \"Chanticleer,\" and the\r\nClerk's old ballad of \"Patient Griselda.\" The last-named will be more\r\ninteresting if we remember that the subject of woman's rights had been\r\nhurled at the heads of the pilgrims by the Wife of Bath, and that the Clerk\r\ntold his story to illustrate his different ideal of womanhood.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARM OF CHAUCER. The first of Chaucer's qualities is that he is an\r\nexcellent story-teller; which means that he has a tale to tell, a good\r\nmethod of telling it, and a philosophy of life which gives us something to\r\nthink about aside from the narrative. He had a profound insight of human\r\nnature, and in telling the simplest story was sure to slip in some nugget\r\nof wisdom or humor: \"What wol nat be mote need be left,\" \"For three may\r\nkeep counsel if twain be away,\" \"The lyf so short, the craft so long to\r\nlerne,\" \"Ful wys is he that can himselven knowe,\"\r\n\r\n  The firste vertue, sone, if thou wilt lere,\r\n  Is to restreine and kepen wel thy tonge.\r\n\r\nThere are literally hundreds of such \"good things\" which make Chaucer a\r\nconstant delight to those who, by a very little practice, can understand\r\nhim almost as easily as Shakespeare. Moreover he was a careful artist; he\r\nknew the principles of poetry and of story-telling, and before he wrote a\r\nsong or a tale he considered both his subject and his audience, repeating\r\nto himself his own rule:\r\n\r\n  Ther nis no werkman, whatsoever he be,\r\n  That may bothe werkë wel and hastily:\r\n  This wol be doon at leysur, parfitly.\r\n\r\nA second quality of Chaucer is his power of observation, a power so\r\nextraordinary that, unlike other poets, he did not need to invent scenes or\r\ncharacters but only to describe what he had seen and heard in this\r\nwonderful world. As he makes one of his characters say:\r\n\r\n  For certeynly, he that me made\r\n  To comen hider seydë me:\r\n  I shouldë bothë hear et see\r\n  In this place wonder thingës.\r\n\r\nIn the _Canterbury Tales_ alone he employs more than a score of\r\ncharacters, and hardly a romantic hero among them; rather does he delight\r\nin plain men and women, who reveal their quality not so much in their\r\naction as in their dress, manner, or tricks of speech. For Chaucer has the\r\nglance of an Indian, which passes over all obvious matters to light upon\r\none significant detail; and that detail furnishes the name or the adjective\r\nof the object. Sometimes his descriptions of men or nature are microscopic\r\nin their accuracy, and again in a single line he awakens the reader's\r\nimagination,--as when Pandarus (in _Troilus_), in order to make\r\nhimself unobtrusive in a room where he is not wanted, picks up a manuscript\r\nand \"makes a face,\" that is, he pretends to be absorbed in a story,\r\n\r\n            and fand his countenance\r\n  As for to loke upon an old romance.\r\n\r\nA dozen striking examples might be given, but we shall note only one. In\r\nthe _Book of the Duchess_ the poet is in a forest, when a chase sweeps\r\nby with whoop of huntsman and clamor of hounds. After the hunt, when the\r\nwoods are all still, comes a little lost dog:\r\n\r\n  Hit com and creep to me as lowë\r\n  Right as hit haddë me y-knowë,\r\n  Hild down his heed and jiyned his eres,\r\n  And leyde al smouthë doun his heres.\r\n  I wolde han caught hit, and anoon\r\n  Hit fleddë and was fro me goon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHAUCER'S HUMOR]\r\n\r\nNext to his power of description, Chaucer's best quality is his humor, a\r\nhumor which is hard to phrase, since it runs from the keenest wit to the\r\nbroadest farce, yet is always kindly and human. A mendicant friar comes in\r\nout of the cold, glances about the snug kitchen for the best seat:\r\n\r\n  And fro the bench he droof awey the cat.\r\n\r\nSometimes his humor is delicate, as in touching up the foibles of the\r\nDoctor or the Man-of-law, or in the Priest's translation of Chanticleer's\r\nevil remark about women:\r\n\r\n                  _In principio_\r\n  _Mulier est hominis confusio._\r\n  Madame, the sentence of this Latin is:\r\n  Woman is mannes joye and al his blis.\r\n\r\nThe humor broadens in the Wife of Bath, who tells how she managed several\r\nhusbands by making their lives miserable; and occasionally it grows a\r\nlittle grim, as when the Maunciple tells the difference between a big and a\r\nlittle rascal. The former does evil on a large scale, and,\r\n\r\n  Lo! therfor is he cleped a Capitain;\r\n  But for the outlawe hath but small meynee,\r\n  And may not doon so gret an harm as he,\r\n  Ne bring a countree to so gret mischeef,\r\n  Men clepen him an outlawe or a theef.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FREEDOM FROM BIAS]\r\n\r\nA fourth quality of Chaucer is his broad tolerance, his absolute\r\ndisinterestedness. He leaves reforms to Wyclif and Langland, and can laugh\r\nwith the Shipman who turns smuggler, or with the worldly Monk whose\r\n\"jingling\" bridle keeps others as well as himself from hearing the chapel\r\nbell. He will not even criticize the fickle Cressida for deserting Troilus,\r\nsaying that men tell tales about her, which is punishment enough for any\r\nwoman. In fine, Chaucer is content to picture a world in which the rain\r\nfalleth alike upon the just and the unjust, and in which the latter seem to\r\nhave a liberal share of the umbrellas. He enjoys it all, and describes its\r\ninhabitants as they are, not as he thinks they ought to be. The reader may\r\nthink that this or that character deserves to come to a bad end; but not so\r\nChaucer, who regards them all as kindly, as impersonally as Nature herself.\r\n\r\nSo the Canterbury pilgrims are not simply fourteenth-century Englishmen;\r\nthey are human types whom Chaucer met at the Tabard Inn, and whom later\r\nEnglish writers discover on all of earth's highways. One appears unchanged\r\nin Shakespeare's drama, another in a novel of Jane Austen, a third lives\r\nover the way or down the street. From century to century they change not,\r\nsave in name or dress. The poet who described or created such enduring\r\ncharacters stands among the few who are called universal writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAUCER'S CONTEMPORARIES AND SUCCESSORS\r\n\r\nSomeone has compared a literary period to a wood in which a few giant oaks\r\nlift head and shoulders above many other trees, all nourished by the same\r\nsoil and air. If we follow this figure, Langland and Wyclif are the only\r\ngrowths that tower beside Chaucer, and Wyclif was a reformer who belongs to\r\nEnglish history rather than to literature.\r\n\r\nLANGLAND. William Langland (_cir_. 1332--1400) is a great figure in\r\nobscurity. We are not certain even of his name, and we must search his work\r\nto discover that he was, probably, a poor lay-priest whose life was\r\ngoverned by two motives: a passion for the poor, which led him to plead\r\ntheir cause in poetry, and a longing for all knowledge:\r\n\r\n  All the sciences under sonnë, and all the sotyle craftës,\r\n  I wolde I knew and couthë, kyndely in mynë hertë.\r\n\r\nHis chief poem, _Piers Plowman_ (_cir_. 1362), is a series of\r\nvisions in which are portrayed the shams and impostures of the age and the\r\nmisery of the common people. The poem is, therefore, as the heavy shadow\r\nwhich throws into relief the bright picture of the _Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\nFor example, while Chaucer portrays the Tabard Inn with its good cheer and\r\nmerry company, Langland goes to another inn on the next street; there he\r\nlooks with pure eyes upon sad or evil-faced men and women, drinking,\r\ngaming, quarreling, and pictures a scene of physical and moral degradation.\r\nOne must look on both pictures to know what an English inn was like in the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nBecause of its crude form and dialect _Piers Plowman_ is hard to\r\nfollow; but to the few who have read it and entered into Langland's\r\nvision--shared his passion for the poor, his hatred of shams, his belief in\r\nthe gospel of honest work, his humor and satire and philosophy--it is one\r\nof the most powerful and original poems in English literature. [Footnote:\r\nThe working classes were beginning to assert themselves in this age, and to\r\nproclaim \"the rights of man.\" Witness the followers of John Ball, and his\r\ninfluence over the crowd when he chanted the lines:\r\n\r\n  When Adam delved and Eve span,\r\n  Who was then the gentleman?\r\n\r\nLangland's poem, written in the midst of the labor agitation, was the first\r\nglorification of labor to appear in English literature. Those who read it\r\nmay make an interesting comparison between \"Piers Plowman\" and a modern\r\nlabor poem, such as Hood's \"Song of the Shirt\" or Markham's \"The Man with\r\nthe Hoe.\"]\r\n\r\nMALORY. Judged by its influence, the greatest prose work of the fifteenth\r\ncentury was the _Morte d'Arthur_ of Thomas Malory (d. 1471). Of the\r\nEnglish knight who compiled this work very little is known beyond this,\r\nthat he sought to preserve in literature the spirit of medieval knighthood\r\nand religion. He tells us nothing of this purpose; but Caxton, who received\r\nthe only known copy of Malory's manuscript and published it in 1485, seems\r\nto have reflected the author's spirit in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"I according to my copy have set it in imprint, to the intent that\r\n    noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the gentle\r\n    and virtuous deeds that some knyghts used in those days, by which\r\n    they came to honour, and how they that were vicious were punished\r\n    and put oft to shame and rebuke.... For herein may be seen noble\r\n    chivalry, courtesy, humanity, hardness, love, friendship,\r\n    cowardice, murder, hate, virtue and sin. Do after the good, and\r\n    leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renommee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN CAERLEON ON USK\r\nThe traditional home of King Arthur]\r\n\r\nMalory's spirit is further indicated by the fact that he passed over all\r\nextravagant tales of foreign heroes and used only the best of the Arthurian\r\nromances. [Footnote: For the origin of the Arthurian stories see above,\r\n\"Geoffrey and the Legends of Arthur\" in Chapter II. An example of the way\r\nthese stories were enlarged is given by Lewis, _Beginnings of English\r\nLiterature_, pp 73-76, who records the story of Arthur's death as told,\r\nfirst, by Geoffrey, then by Layamon, and finally by Malory, who copied the\r\ntale from French sources. If we add Tennyson's \"Passing of Arthur,\" we\r\nshall have the story as told from the twelfth to the nineteenth century.]\r\nThese had been left in a chaotic state by poets, and Malory brought order\r\nout of the chaos by omitting tedious fables and arranging his material in\r\nsomething like dramatic unity under three heads: the Coming of Arthur with\r\nits glorious promise, the Round Table, and the Search for the Holy Grail:\r\n\r\n    \"And thenne the kynge and al estates wente home unto Camelot, and\r\n    soo wente to evensonge to the grete mynster, and soo after upon\r\n    that to souper; and every knyght sette in his owne place as they\r\n    were to forehand. Thenne anone they herd crakynge and cryenge of\r\n    thonder, that hem thought the place shold alle to dryve. In the\r\n    myddes of this blast entred a sonne beaume more clerer by seven\r\n    tymes than ever they sawe daye, and al they were alyghted of the\r\n    grace of the Holy Ghoost. Then beganne every knyghte to behold\r\n    other, and eyther sawe other by theire semynge fayrer than ever\r\n    they sawe afore. Not for thenne there was no knyght myghte speke\r\n    one word a grete whyle, and soo they loked every man on other, as\r\n    they had ben domb. Thenne ther entred into the halle the Holy\r\n    Graile, covered with whyte samyte, but ther was none myghte see\r\n    hit, nor who bare hit. And there was al the halle fulfylled with\r\n    good odoures, and every knyght had suche metes and drynkes as he\r\n    best loved in this world. And when the Holy Grayle had be borne\r\n    thurgh the halle, thenne the holy vessel departed sodenly, that\r\n    they wyste not where hit becam....\r\n\r\n    \"'Now,' said Sir Gawayne, 'we have ben served this daye of what\r\n    metes and drynkes we thoughte on, but one thynge begyled us; we\r\n    myght not see the Holy Grayle, it was soo precyously coverd.\r\n    Therfor I wil mak here avowe, that to morne, withoute lenger\r\n    abydyng, I shall laboure in the quest of the Sancgreal; that I\r\n    shalle hold me oute a twelve moneth and a day, or more yf nede be,\r\n    and never shalle I retorne ageyne unto the courte tyl I have sene\r\n    hit more openly than hit hath ben sene here.'... Whan they of the\r\n    Table Round herde Syr Gawayne saye so, they arose up the most party\r\n    and maade suche avowes as Sire Gawayne had made.\"\r\n\r\nInto this holy quest sin enters like a serpent; then in quick succession\r\ntragedy, rebellion, the passing of Arthur, the penitence of guilty\r\nLauncelot and Guinevere. The figures fade away at last, as Shelley says of\r\nthe figures of the Iliad, \"in tenderness and inexpiable sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nAs the best of Malory's work is now easily accessible, we forbear further\r\nquotation. These old Arthurian legends, the common inheritance of all\r\nEnglish-speaking people, should be known to every reader. As they appear in\r\n_Morte d'Arthur_ they are notable as an example of fine old English\r\nprose, as a reflection of the enduring ideals of chivalry, and finally as a\r\nstorehouse in which Spenser, Tennyson and many others have found material\r\nfor some of their noblest poems.\r\n\r\nCAXTON. William Caxton (d. 1491) is famous for having brought the printing\r\npress to England, but he has other claims to literary renown. He was editor\r\nas well as printer; he translated more than a score of the books which came\r\nfrom his press; and, finally, it was he who did more than any other man to\r\nfix a standard of English speech.\r\n\r\nIn Caxton's day several dialects were in use, and, as we infer from one of\r\nhis prefaces, he was doubtful which was most suitable for literature or\r\nmost likely to become the common speech of England. His doubt was dissolved\r\nby the time he had printed the _Canterbury Tales_ and the _Morte\r\nd'Arthur_. Many other works followed in the same \"King's English\"; his\r\nsuccessor at the printing press, Wynkyn de Worde, continued in the same\r\nline; and when, less than sixty years after the first English book was\r\nprinted, Tyndale's translation of the New Testament had found its way to\r\nevery shire in England, there was no longer room for doubt that the\r\nEast-Midland dialect had become the standard of the English nation. We have\r\nbeen speaking and writing that dialect ever since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ALMONRY, WESTMINSTER\r\nCaxton's printing office From an old print]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORY OF THE PRINTING PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe story of how printing came to England, not as a literary but as a\r\nbusiness venture, is a very interesting one. Caxton was an English merchant\r\nwho had established himself at Bruges, then one of the trading centers of\r\nEurope. There his business prospered, and he became governor of the\r\n_Domus Angliae_, or House of the English Guild of Merchant\r\nAdventurers. There is romance in the very name. With moderate wealth came\r\nleisure to Caxton, and he indulged his literary taste by writing his own\r\nversion of some popular romances concerning the siege of Troy, being\r\nencouraged by the English princess Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, into\r\nwhose service he had entered.\r\n\r\nCopies of his work being in demand, Caxton consulted the professional\r\ncopyists, whose beautiful work we read about in a remarkable novel called\r\n_The Cloister and the Hearth_. Then suddenly came to Bruges the rumor\r\nof Gutenberg's discovery of printing from movable types, and Caxton\r\nhastened to Germany to investigate the matter, led by the desire to get\r\ncopies of his own work as cheaply as possible. The discovery fascinated\r\nhim; instead of a few copies of his manuscript he brought back to Bruges a\r\npress, from which he issued his _Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy_\r\n(1474), which was probably the first book to appear in English print. Quick\r\nto see the commercial advantages of the new invention, Caxton moved his\r\nprinting press to London, near Westminster Abbey, where he brought out in\r\n1477 his _Dictes and Sayinges of the Philosophers_, the first book\r\never printed on English soil. [Footnote: Another book of Caxton's, _The\r\nGame and Playe of the Chesse_ (1475) was long accorded this honor, but\r\nit is fairly certain that the book on chess-playing was printed in Bruges.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST PRINTED BOOKS]\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset Caxton's venture was successful, and he was soon busy\r\nin supplying books that were most in demand. He has been criticized for not\r\nprinting the classics and other books of the New Learning; but he evidently\r\nknew his business and his audience, and aimed to give people what they\r\nwanted, not what he thought they ought to have. Chaucer's _Canterbury\r\nTales_, Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, Mandeville's _Travels_,\r\nÆsop's _Fables_, parts of the _Æneid_, translations of French\r\nromances, lives of the saints (The Golden Legend), cookbooks, prayer books,\r\nbooks of etiquette,--the list of Caxton's eighty-odd publications becomes\r\nsignificant when we remember that he printed only popular books, and that\r\nthe titles indicate the taste of the age which first looked upon the marvel\r\nof printing.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR BALLADS. If it be asked, \"What is a ballad?\" any positive answer\r\nwill lead to disputation. Originally the ballad was probably a chant to\r\naccompany a dance, and so it represents the earliest form of poetry. In\r\ntheory, as various definitions indicate, it is a short poem telling a story\r\nof some exploit, usually of a valorous kind. In common practice, from\r\nChaucer to Tennyson, the ballad is almost any kind of short poem treating\r\nof any event, grave or gay, in any descriptive or dramatic way that appeals\r\nto the poet.\r\n\r\nFor the origin of the ballad one must search far back among the social\r\ncustoms of primitive times. That the Anglo-Saxons were familiar with it\r\nappears from the record of Tacitus, who speaks of their _carmina_ or\r\nnarrative songs; but, with the exception of \"The Fight at Finnsburgh\" and a\r\nfew other fragments, all these have disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages ballads were constantly appearing among the common\r\npeople, [Footnote: Thus, when Sidney says, \"I never heard the old song of\r\nPercy and Douglass that I found not my heart moved more than with a\r\ntrumpet,\" and when Shakespeare shows Autolycus at a country fair offering\r\n\"songs for men and women of all sizes,\" both poets are referring to popular\r\nballads. Even later, as late as the American Revolution, history was first\r\nwritten for the people in the form of ballads.] but they were seldom\r\nwritten, and found no standing in polite literature. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury, however, certain men who had grown weary of the formal poetry of\r\nPope and his school turned for relief to the old vigorous ballads of the\r\npeople, and rescued them from oblivion. The one book to which, more than\r\nany other, we owe the revival of interest in balladry is _Percy's\r\nReliques of Ancient English Poetry_ (1765).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MARKS OF A BALLAD]\r\n\r\nThe best of our ballads date in their present form from the fifteenth or\r\nsixteenth century; but the originals were much older, and had been\r\ntransmitted orally for years before they were recorded on manuscript. As we\r\nstudy them we note, as their first characteristic, that they spring from\r\nthe unlettered common people, that they are by unknown authors, and that\r\nthey appear in different versions because they were changed by each\r\nminstrel to suit his own taste or that of his audience.\r\n\r\nA second characteristic is the objective quality of the ballad, which deals\r\nnot with a poet's thought or feeling (such subjective emotions give rise to\r\nthe lyric) but with a man or a deed. See in the ballad of \"Sir Patrick\r\nSpence\" (or Spens) how the unknown author goes straight to his story:\r\n\r\n  The king sits in Dumferling towne,\r\n    Drinking the blude-red wine:\r\n  \"O whar will I get guid sailor\r\n    To sail this schip of mine?\"\r\n\r\n  Up and spak an eldern knicht,\r\n    Sat at the king's richt kne:\r\n  \"Sir Patrick Spence is the best sailor\r\n    That sails upon the se.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a brief pause to tell us of Sir Patrick's dismay when word comes\r\nthat the king expects him to take out a ship at a time when she should be\r\nriding to anchor, then on goes the narrative:\r\n\r\n  \"Mak hast, mak haste, my mirry men all,\r\n    Our guid schip sails the morne.\"\r\n  \"O say na sae, my master deir,\r\n    For I feir a deadlie storme:\r\n\r\n  \"Late, late yestreen I saw the new moone\r\n    Wi the auld moone in hir arme,\r\n  And I feir, I feir, my deir master,\r\n    That we will cum to harme.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end there is no wailing, no moral, no display of the poet's feeling,\r\nbut just a picture:\r\n\r\n  O lang, lang may the ladies stand,\r\n    Wi thair gold kems in their hair,\r\n  Waiting for thair ain deir lords,\r\n    For they'll se thame na mair.\r\n\r\n  Haf owre, haf owre to Aberdour,\r\n    It's fiftie fadom deip,\r\n  And thair lies guid Sir Patrick Spence,\r\n    Wi the Scots lords at his feit.\r\n\r\nDirectness, vigor, dramatic action, an ending that appeals to the\r\nimagination,--most of the good qualities of story-telling are found in this\r\nold Scottish ballad. If we compare it with Longfellow's \"Wreck of the\r\nHesperus,\" we may discover that the two poets, though far apart in time and\r\nspace, have followed almost identical methods.\r\n\r\nOther good ballads, which take us out under the open sky among vigorous\r\nmen, are certain parts of \"The Gest of Robin Hood,\" \"Mary Hamilton,\" \"The\r\nWife of Usher's Well,\" \"The Wee Wee Man,\" \"Fair Helen,\" \"Hind Horn,\"\r\n\"Bonnie George Campbell,\" \"Johnnie O'Cockley's Well,\" \"Catharine Jaffray\"\r\n(from which Scott borrowed his \"Lochinvar\"), and especially \"The Nutbrown\r\nMayde,\" sweetest and most artistic of all the ballads, which gives a\r\npopular and happy version of the tale that Chaucer told in his \"Patient\r\nGriselda.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The period included in the Age of Chaucer and the Revival\r\n    of Learning covers two centuries, from 1350 to 1550. The chief\r\n    literary figure of the period, and one of the greatest of English\r\n    poets, is Geoffrey Chaucer, who died in the year 1400. He was\r\n    greatly influenced by French and Italian models; he wrote for the\r\n    middle and upper classes; his greatest work was _The Canterbury\r\n    Tales_.\r\n\r\n    Langland, another poet contemporary with Chaucer, is famous for his\r\n    _Piers Plowman_, a powerful poem aiming at social reform, and\r\n    vividly portraying the life of the common people. It is written in\r\n    the old Saxon manner, with accent and alliteration, and is\r\n    difficult to read in its original form.\r\n\r\n    After the death of Chaucer a century and a half passed before\r\n    another great writer appeared in England. The time was one of\r\n    general decline in literature, and the most obvious causes were:\r\n    the Wars of the Roses, which destroyed many of the patrons of\r\n    literature; the Reformation, which occupied the nation with\r\n    religious controversy; and the Renaissance or Revival of Learning,\r\n    which turned scholars to the literature of Greece and Rome rather\r\n    than to English works.\r\n\r\n    In our study of the latter part of the period we reviewed: (1) the\r\n    rise of the popular ballad, which was almost the only type of\r\n    literature known to the common people. (2) The work of Malory, who\r\n    arranged the best of the Arthurian legends in his _Morte\r\n    d'Arthur._ (3) The work of Caxton, who brought the first\r\n    printing press to London, and who was instrumental in establishing\r\n    the East-Midland dialect as the literary language of England.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

In such triumphant lines, falling from the\r\n    lips of that old imperialist John of Gaunt, did Shakespeare\r\n    reflect, not the rebellious spirit of the age of Richard II, but\r\n    the boundless enthusiasm of his own times, when the defeat of\r\n    Spain's mighty Armada had left England \"in splendid isolation,\"\r\n    unchallenged mistress of her own realm and of the encircling sea.\r\n    For it was in the latter part of Elizabeth's reign that England\r\n    found herself as a nation, and became conscious of her destiny as a\r\n    world empire.\r\n\r\n    There is another and darker side to the political shield, but the\r\n    student of literature is not concerned with it. We are to remember\r\n    the patriotic enthusiasm of the age, overlooking the frequent\r\n    despotism of \"good Queen Bess\" and entering into the spirit of\r\n    national pride and power that thrilled all classes of Englishmen\r\n    during her reign, if we are to understand the outburst of\r\n    Elizabethan literature. Nearly two centuries of trouble and danger\r\n    had passed since Chaucer died, and no national poet had appeared in\r\n    England. The Renaissance came, and the Reformation, but they\r\n    brought no great writers with them. During the first thirty years\r\n    of Elizabeth's reign not a single important literary work was\r\n    produced; then suddenly appeared the poetry of Spenser and Chapman,\r\n    the prose of Hooker, Sidney and Bacon, the dramas of Marlowe,\r\n    Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and a score of others,--all voicing the\r\n    national feeling after the defeat of the Armada, and growing silent\r\n    as soon as the enthusiasm began to wane.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. Next to the patriotic spirit of Elizabethan\r\nliterature, its most notable qualities are its youthful freshness and\r\nvigor, its romantic spirit, its absorption in the theme of love, its\r\nextravagance of speech, its lively sense of the wonder of heaven and earth.\r\nThe ideal beauty of Spenser's poetry, the bombast of Marlowe, the boundless\r\nzest of Shakespeare's historical plays, the romantic love celebrated in\r\nunnumbered lyrics,--all these speak of youth, of springtime, of the joy and\r\nthe heroic adventure of human living.\r\n\r\nThis romantic enthusiasm of Elizabethan poetry and prose may be explained\r\nby the fact that, besides the national impulse, three other inspiring\r\ninfluences were at work. The first in point of time was the rediscovery of\r\nthe classics of Greece and Rome,--beautiful old poems, which were as new to\r\nthe Elizabethans as to Keats when he wrote his immortal sonnet, beginning:\r\n\r\n  Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold.\r\n\r\nThe second awakening factor was the widespread interest in nature and the\r\nphysical sciences, which spurred many another Elizabethan besides Bacon to\r\n\"take all knowledge for his province.\" This new interest was generally\r\nromantic rather than scientific, was more concerned with marvels, like the\r\nphilosopher's stone that would transmute all things to gold, than with the\r\nsimple facts of nature. Bacon's chemical changes, which follow the\r\n\"instincts\" of metals, are almost on a par with those other changes\r\ndescribed in Shakespeare's song of Ariel:\r\n\r\n  Full fathom five thy father lies;\r\n       Of his bones are coral made;\r\n  Those are pearls that were his eyes:\r\n       Nothing of him that doth fade\r\n  But doth suffer a sea-change\r\n  Into something rich and strange.\r\n\r\nThe third factor which stimulated the Elizabethan imagination was the\r\ndiscovery of the world beyond the Atlantic, a world of wealth, of beauty,\r\nof unmeasured opportunity for brave spirits, in regions long supposed to be\r\npossessed of demons, monsters, Othello's impossible\r\n\r\n          cannibals that each other eat,\r\n  The anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\n  Do grow beneath their shoulders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NEW WORLD]\r\n\r\nWhen Drake returned from his voyage around the world he brought to England\r\ntwo things: a tale of vast regions just over the world's rim that awaited\r\nEnglish explorers, and a ship loaded to the hatches with gold and jewels.\r\nThat the latter treasure was little better than a pirate's booty; that it\r\nwas stolen from the Spaniards, who had taken it from poor savages at the\r\nprice of blood and torture,--all this was not mentioned. The queen and her\r\nfavorites shared the treasure with Drake's buccaneers, and the New World\r\nseemed to them a place of barbaric splendor, where the savage's wattled hut\r\nwas roofed with silver, his garments beaded with all precious jewels. As a\r\npopular play of the period declares:\r\n\r\n    \"Why, man, all their dripping pans are pure gold! The prisoners\r\n    they take are fettered in gold; and as for rubies and diamonds,\r\n    they goe forth on holydayes and gather 'hem by the seashore to hang\r\n    on their children's coates.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the American settlements opened England's eyes to the stern reality\r\nof things, it was the romance of the New World that appealed most\r\npowerfully to the imagination, and that influenced Elizabethan literature\r\nto an extent which we have not yet begun to measure.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INFLUENCE. We shall understand the imitative quality of early\r\nElizabethan poetry if we read it in the light of these facts: that in the\r\nsixteenth century England was far behind other European nations in culture;\r\nthat the Renaissance had influenced Italy and Holland for a century before\r\nit crossed the Channel; that, at a time when every Dutch peasant read his\r\nBible, the masses of English people remained in dense ignorance, and the\r\nmajority of the official classes were like Shakespeare's father and\r\ndaughter in that they could neither read nor write. So, when the new\r\nnational spirit began to express itself in literature, Englishmen turned to\r\nthe more cultured nations and began to imitate them in poetry, as in dress\r\nand manners. Shakespeare gives us a hint of the matter when he makes Portia\r\nridicule the apishness of the English. In _The Merchant of Venice_\r\n(Act I, scene 2) the maid Nerissa is speaking of various princely suitors\r\nfor Portia's hand. She names them over, Frenchman, Italian, Scotsman,\r\nGerman; but Portia makes fun of them all. The maid tries again:\r\n\r\n  _Nerissa_. What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron of\r\n        England?\r\n\r\n  _Portia_.  You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,\r\n        nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will\r\n        come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the\r\n        English. He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can converse\r\n        with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his\r\n        doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany\r\n        and his behaviour every where.\r\n\r\nWhen Wyatt and Surrey brought the sonnet to England, they brought also the\r\nhabit of imitating the Italian poets; and this habit influenced Spenser and\r\nother Elizabethans even more than Chaucer had been influenced by Dante and\r\nPetrarch. It was the fashion at that time for Italian gentlemen to write\r\npoetry; they practiced the art as they practiced riding or fencing; and\r\npresently scores of Englishmen followed Sidney's example in taking up this\r\nphase of foreign education. It was also an Italian custom to publish the\r\nworks of amateur poets in the form of anthologies, and soon there appeared\r\nin England _The Paradise of Dainty Devices, A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant\r\nInventions_ and other such collections, the best of which was\r\n_England's Helicon_ (1600). Still another foreign fashion was that of\r\nwriting a series of sonnets to some real or imaginary mistress; and that\r\nthe fashion was followed in England is evident from Spenser's\r\n_Amoretti_, Sidney's _Astrophel and Stella_, Shakespeare's\r\n_Sonnets_, and other less-famous effusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPENSER AND THE LYRIC POETS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHAEL DRAYTON]\r\n\r\nLYRICS OF LOVE. Love was the subject of a very large part of the minor\r\npoems of the period, the monotony being relieved by an occasional ballad,\r\nsuch as Drayton's \"Battle of Agincourt\" and his \"Ode to the Virginian\r\nVoyage,\" the latter being one of the first poems inspired by the New World.\r\nSince love was still subject to literary rules, as in the metrical\r\nromances, it is not strange that most Elizabethan lyrics seem to the modern\r\nreader artificial. They deal largely with goddesses and airy shepherd folk;\r\nthey contain many references to classic characters and scenes, to Venus,\r\nOlympus and the rest; they are nearly all characterized by extravagance of\r\nlanguage. A single selection, \"Apelles' Song\" by Lyly, may serve as typical\r\nof the more fantastic love lyrics:\r\n\r\n  Cupid and my Campaspe played\r\n  At cards for kisses; Cupid paid.\r\n  He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows,\r\n  His mother's doves and team of sparrows:\r\n  Loses them too; then down he throws\r\n  The coral of his lip, the rose\r\n  Growing on's cheek (but none knows how);\r\n  With these the crystal of his brow,\r\n  And then the dimple of his chin.\r\n  All these did my Campaspe win.\r\n  At last he set her both his eyes;\r\n  She won, and Cupid blind did rise.\r\n  O Love, has she done this to thee?\r\n  What shall, alas! become of me?\r\n\r\nMUSIC AND POETRY. Another reason for the outburst of lyric poetry in\r\nElizabethan times was that choral music began to be studied, and there was\r\ngreat demand for new songs. Then appeared a theory of the close relation\r\nbetween poetry and music, which was followed by the American poet Lanier\r\nmore than two centuries later. [Footnote: Much of Lanier's verse seems more\r\nlike a musical improvisation than like an ordinary poem. His theory that\r\nmusic and poetry are subject to the same laws is developed in his\r\n_Science of English Verse._ It is interesting to note that Lanier's\r\nancestors were musical directors at the courts of Elizabeth and of James\r\nI.] This interesting theory is foreshadowed in several minor works of the\r\nperiod; for example, in Barnfield's sonnet \"To R. L.,\" beginning:\r\n\r\n  If music and sweet poetry agree,\r\n  As they must needs, the sister and the brother,\r\n  Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,\r\n  Because thou lov'st the one, and I the other.\r\n\r\nThe stage caught up the new fashion, and hundreds of lyrics appeared in the\r\nElizabethan drama, such as Dekker's \"Content\" (from the play of _Patient\r\nGrissell), which almost sets itself to music as we read it:\r\n\r\n  Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?\r\n         O sweet content!\r\n  Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexed?\r\n         O punishment!\r\n  Dost laugh to see how fools are vexed\r\n  To add to golden numbers golden numbers?\r\n    O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content!\r\n\r\n  _Work apace, apace, apace, apace!\r\n  Honest labour bears a lovely face.\r\n  Then hey noney, noney; hey noney, noney!_\r\n\r\n  Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?\r\n         O sweet content!\r\n  Swim'st thou in wealth, yet sink'st in thine own tears?\r\n         O punishment!\r\n  Then he that patiently want's burden bears\r\n  No burden bears, but is a king, a king.\r\n    O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content!\r\n\r\nSo many lyric poets appeared during this period that we cannot here\r\nclassify them; and it would be idle to list their names. The best place to\r\nmake acquaintance with theo is not in a dry history of literature, but in\r\nsuch a pleasant little book as Palgrave's _Golden Treasury_, where\r\ntheir best work is accessible to every reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDMUND SPENSER (1552-1599)\r\n\r\nSpenser was the second of the great English poets, and it is but natural to\r\ncompare him with Chaucer, who was the first. In respect of time nearly two\r\ncenturies separate these elder poets; in all other respects, in aims,\r\nideals, methods, they are as far apart as two men of the same race can well\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Very little is known of Spenser; he appears in the light,\r\n    then vanishes into the shadow, like his Arthur of _The Faery\r\n    Queen_. We see him for a moment in the midst of rebellion in\r\n    Ireland, or engaged in the scramble for preferment among the\r\n    queen's favorites; he disappears, and from his obscurity comes a\r\n    poem that is like the distant ringing of a chapel bell, faintly\r\n    heard in the clatter of the city streets. We shall try here to\r\n    understand this poet by dissolving some of the mystery that\r\n    envelops him.\r\n\r\n    He was born in London, and spent his youth amid the political and\r\n    religious dissensions of the times of Mary and Elizabeth. For all\r\n    this turmoil Spenser had no stomach; he was a man of peace, of\r\n    books, of romantic dreams. He was of noble family, but poor; his\r\n    only talent was to write poetry, and as poetry would not buy much\r\n    bread in those days, his pride of birth was humbled in seeking the\r\n    patronage of nobles:\r\n\r\n      Full little knowest thou, that hast not tried,\r\n      What hell it is in suing long to bide: ...\r\n      To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,\r\n      To spend, to give, to want, to be undone.\r\n\r\n    To the liberality of a patron he owed his education at Cambridge.\r\n    It was then the heyday of Renaissance studies, and Spenser steeped\r\n    himself in Greek, Latin and Italian literatures. Everything that\r\n    was antique was then in favor at the universities; there was a\r\n    revival of interest in Old-English poetry, which accounts largely\r\n    for Spenser's use of obsolete words and his imitation of Chaucer's\r\n    spelling.\r\n\r\n    After graduation he spent some time in the north of England,\r\n    probably as a tutor, and had an unhappy love affair, which he\r\n    celebrated in his poems to Rosalind. Then he returned to London,\r\n    lived by favor in the houses of Sidney and Leicester, and through\r\n    these powerful patrons was appointed secretary to Lord Grey de\r\n    Wilton, the queen's deputy in Ireland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EDMUND SPENSER]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SPENSER'S EXILE]\r\n\r\n    From this time on our poet is represented as a melancholy Spenser's\r\n    \"exile,\" but that is a poetic fiction. At that time Ireland, having\r\n    refused to follow the Reformation, was engaged in a desperate\r\n    struggle for civil and religious liberty. Every English army that\r\n    sailed to crush this rebellion was accompanied by a swarm of\r\n    parasites, each inspired by the hope of getting one of the rich\r\n    estates that were confiscated from Irish owners. Spenser seems to\r\n    have been one of these expectant adventurers who accompanied Lord\r\n    Grey in his campaign of brutality. To the horrors of that campaign\r\n    the poet was blind; [Footnote: The barbarism of Spenser's view, a\r\n    common one at that time, is reflected in his _View of the Present\r\n    State of Ireland._ Honorable warfare on land or sea was unknown\r\n    in Elizabeth's day. Scores of pirate ships of all nations were then\r\n    openly preying on commerce. Drake, Frobisher and many other\r\n    Elizabethan \"heroes\" were at times mere buccaneers who shared their\r\n    plunder with the queen. In putting down the Irish rebellion Lords\r\n    Grey and Essex used some of the same horrible methods employed by\r\n    the notorious Duke of Alva in the Netherlands.] his sympathies were\r\n    all for his patron Grey, who appears in The Faery Queen as Sir\r\n    Artegall, \"the model of true justice.\"\r\n\r\n    For his services Spenser was awarded the castle of Kilcolman and\r\n    3000 acres of land, which had been taken from the Earl of Desmond.\r\n    In the same way Raleigh became an Irish landlord, with 40,000 acres\r\n    to his credit; and so these two famous Elizabethans were thrown\r\n    together in exile, as they termed it. Both longed to return to\r\n    England, to enjoy London society and the revenues of Irish land at\r\n    the same time, but unfortunately one condition of their immense\r\n    grants was that they should occupy the land and keep the rightful\r\n    owners from possessing it.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WORK IN IRELAND]\r\n\r\n    In Ireland Spenser began to write his masterpiece _The Faery\r\n    Queen_. Raleigh, to whom the first three books were read, was so\r\n    impressed by the beauty of the work that he hurried the poet off to\r\n    London, and gained for him the royal favor. In the poem \"Colin\r\n    Clout's Come Home Again\" we may read Spenser's account of how the\r\n    court impressed him after his sojourn in Ireland.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: RALEIGH'S BIRTHPLACE, BUDLEIGH SALTERTON.\r\n      Hayes, Devonshire]\r\n\r\n    The publication of the first parts of _The Faery Queen_ (1590)\r\n    raised Spenser to the foremost place in English letters. He was\r\n    made poet-laureate, and used every influence of patrons and of\r\n    literary success to the end that he be allowed to remain in London,\r\n    but the queen was flint-hearted, insisting that he must give up his\r\n    estate or occupy it. So he returned sorrowfully to \"exile,\" and\r\n    wrote three more books of _The Faery Queen_. To his other\r\n    offices was added that of sheriff of County Cork, an adventurous\r\n    office for any man even in times of peace, and for a poet, in a\r\n    time of turmoil, an invitation to disaster. Presently another\r\n    rebellion broke out, Kilcolman castle was burned, and the poet's\r\n    family barely escaped with their lives. It was said by Ben Jonson\r\n    that one of Spenser's children and some parts of _The Faery\r\n    Queen_ perished in the fire, but the truth of the saying has not\r\n    been established.\r\n\r\n    Soon after this experience, which crushed the poet's spirit, he was\r\n    ordered on official business to London, and died on the journey in\r\n    1599. As he was buried beside Chaucer, in Westminster Abbey, poets\r\n    were seen casting memorial verses and the pens that had written\r\n    them into his tomb.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: CHARACTER]\r\n\r\n    In character Spenser was unfitted either for the intrigues among\r\n    Elizabeth's favorites or for the more desperate scenes amid which\r\n    his Lot was cast. Unlike his friend Raleigh, who was a man of\r\n    action, Spenser was essentially a dreamer, and except in Cambridge\r\n    he seems never to have felt at home. His criticism of the age as\r\n    barren and hopeless, and the melancholy of the greater part of his\r\n    work, indicate that for him, at least, the great Elizabethan times\r\n    were \"out of joint.\" The world, which thinks of Spenser as a great\r\n    poet, has forgotten that he thought of himself as a disappointed\r\n    man.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF SPENSER. The poems of Spenser may be conveniently grouped in three\r\nclasses. In the first are the pastorals of _The Shepherd's Calendar_,\r\nin which he reflects some of the poetical fashions of his age. In the\r\nsecond are the allegories of _The Faery Queen_, in which he pictures\r\nthe state of England as a struggle between good and evil. In the third\r\nclass are his occasional poems of friendship and love, such as the\r\n_Amoretti_. All his works are alike musical, and all remote from\r\nordinary life, like the eerie music of a wind harp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHEPHERD'S CALENDAR]\r\n\r\n_The Shepherd's Calendar_ (1579) is famous as the poem which announced\r\nthat a successor to Chaucer had at last appeared in England. It is an\r\namateurish work in which Spenser tried various meters; and to analyze it is\r\nto discover two discordant elements, which we may call fashionable poetry\r\nand puritanic preaching. Let us understand these elements clearly, for\r\napart from them the _Calendar_ is a meaningless work.\r\n\r\nIt was a fashion among Italian poets to make eclogues or pastoral poems\r\nabout shepherds, their dancing, piping, love-making,--everything except a\r\nshepherd's proper business. Spenser followed this artificial fashion in his\r\n_Calendar_ by making twelve pastorals, one for each month of the year.\r\nThese all take the form of conversations, accompanied by music and dancing,\r\nand the personages are Cuddie, Diggon, Hobbinoll, and other fantastic\r\nshepherds. According to poetic custom these should sing only of love; but\r\nin Spenser's day religious controversy was rampant, and flattery might not\r\nbe overlooked by a poet who aspired to royal favor. So while the January\r\npastoral tells of the unhappy love of Colin Clout (Spenser) for Rosalind,\r\nthe springtime of April calls for a song in praise of Elizabeth:\r\n\r\n  Lo, how finely the Graces can it foot\r\n    To the instrument!\r\n  They dancen deffly and singen soote,\r\n    In their merriment.\r\n  Wants not a fourth Grace to make the dance even?\r\n  Let that room to my Lady be yeven.\r\n    She shall be a Grace,\r\n    To fill the fourth place,\r\n  And reign with the rest in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn May the shepherds are rival pastors of the Reformation, who end their\r\nsermons with an animal fable; in summer they discourse of Puritan theology;\r\nOctober brings them to contemplate the trials and disappointments of a\r\npoet, and the series ends with a parable comparing life to the four seasons\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nThe moralizing of _The Shepherd's Calendar_ and the uncouth spelling\r\nwhich Spenser affected detract from the interest of the poem; but one who\r\nhas patience to read it finds on almost every page some fine poetic line,\r\nand occasionally a good song, like the following (from the August pastoral)\r\nin which two shepherds alternately supply the lines of a roundelay:\r\n\r\n  Sitting upon a hill so high,\r\n      Hey, ho, the high hill!\r\n  The while my flock did feed thereby,\r\n      The while the shepherd's self did spill,\r\n  I saw the bouncing Bellibone,\r\n      Hey, ho, Bonnibell!\r\n  Tripping over the dale alone;\r\n      She can trip it very well.\r\n  Well deckéd in a frock of gray,\r\n      Hey, ho, gray is greet!\r\n  And in a kirtle of green say;\r\n      The green is for maidens meet.\r\n  A chaplet on her head she wore,\r\n      Hey, ho, chapelet!\r\n  Of sweet violets therein was store,\r\n      She sweeter than the violet.\r\n\r\nTHE FAERY QUEEN. Let us hear one of the stories of this celebrated poem,\r\nand after the tale is told we may discover Spenser's purpose in writing all\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SIR GUYON]\r\n\r\n    From the court of Gloriana, Queen of Faery, the gallant Sir Guyon\r\n    sets out on adventure bent, and with him is a holy Palmer, or\r\n    pilgrim, to protect him from the evil that lurks by every wayside.\r\n    Hardly have the two entered the first wood when they fall into the\r\n    hands of the wicked Archimago, who spends his time in devising\r\n    spells or enchantments for the purpose of leading honest folk\r\n    astray.\r\n\r\n      For all he did was to deceive good knights,\r\n      And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame.\r\n\r\n    Escaping from the snare, Guyon hears a lamentation, and turns aside\r\n    to find a beautiful woman dying beside a dead knight. Her story is,\r\n    that her man has been led astray by the Lady Acrasia, who leads\r\n    many knights to her Bower of Bliss, and there makes them forget\r\n    honor and knightly duty. Guyon vows to right this wrong, and\r\n    proceeds on the adventure.\r\n\r\n    With the Palmer and a boatman he embarks in a skiff and crosses the\r\n    Gulf of Greediness, deadly whirlpools on one side, and on the other\r\n    the Magnet Mountain with wrecks of ships strewed about its foot.\r\n    Sighting the fair Wandering Isles, he attempts to land, attracted\r\n    here by a beautiful damsel, there by a woman in distress; but the\r\n    Palmer tells him that these seeming women are evil shadows placed\r\n    there to lead men astray. Next he meets the monsters of the deep,\r\n    \"sea-shouldering whales,\" \"scolopendras,\" \"grisly wassermans,\"\r\n    \"mighty monoceroses with unmeasured tails.\" Escaping these, he\r\n    meets a greater peril in the mermaids, who sing to him alluringly:\r\n\r\n      This is port of rest from troublous toil,\r\n      The world's sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil.\r\n\r\n    Many other sea-dangers are passed before Guyon comes to land, where\r\n    he is immediately charged by a bellowing herd of savage beasts.\r\n    Only the power of the Palmer's holy staff saves the knight from\r\n    annihilation.\r\n\r\n    This is the last physical danger which Guyon encounters. As he goes\r\n    forward the country becomes an earthly paradise, where pleasures\r\n    call to him from every side. It is his soul, not his body, which is\r\n    now in peril. Here is the Palace of Pleasure, its wondrous gates\r\n    carved with images representing Jason's search for the Golden\r\n    Fleece. Beyond it are parks, gardens, fountains, and the beautiful\r\n    Lady Excess, who squeezes grapes into a golden cup and offers it to\r\n    Guyon as an invitation to linger. The scene grows ever more\r\n    entrancing as he rejects the cup of Excess and pushes onward:\r\n\r\n      Eftsoones they heard a most melodious sound\r\n      Of all that mote delight a dainty ear,\r\n      Such as at once might not on living ground,\r\n      Save in this paradise, be heard elsewhere:\r\n      Right hard it was for wight which did it hear\r\n      To read what manner music that mote be;\r\n      For all that pleasing is to living ear\r\n      Was there consorted in one harmony;\r\n      Birds, voices, instruments, winds, waters, all agree.\r\n\r\n    Amid such allurements Guyon comes at last to where beautiful\r\n    Acrasia lives, with knights who forget their knighthood. From the\r\n    open portal comes a melody, the voice of an unseen singer lifting\r\n    up the old song of Epicurus and of Omar:\r\n\r\n      Gather the rose of love whilst yet is time.\r\n\r\n    The following scenes in the Bower of Bliss were plainly suggested\r\n    by the Palace of Circe, in the _Odyssey_; but where Homer is\r\n    direct, simple, forceful, Spenser revels in luxuriant details. He\r\n    charms all Guyon's senses with color, perfume, beauty, harmony;\r\n    then he remembers that he is writing a moral poem, and suddenly his\r\n    delighted knight turns reformer. He catches Acrasia in a net woven\r\n    by the Palmer, and proceeds to smash her exquisite abode with\r\n    puritanic thoroughness:\r\n\r\n      But all those pleasaunt bowers and palace brave\r\n      Guyon brake down with rigour pitilesse.\r\n\r\n    As they fare forth after the destruction, the herd of horrible\r\n    beasts is again encountered, and lo! all these creatures are men\r\n    whom Acrasia has transformed into brutal shapes. The Palmer\r\n    \"strooks\" them all with his holy staff, and they resume their human\r\n    semblance. Some are glad, others wroth at the change; and one named\r\n    Grylle, who had been a hog, reviles his rescuers for disturbing\r\n    him; which gives the Palmer a final chance to moralize:\r\n\r\n      Let Grylle be Grylle and have his hoggish mind;\r\n      But let us hence depart while weather serves and wind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OTHER STORIES]\r\n\r\nSuch is Spenser's story of Sir Guyon, or Temperance. It is a long story,\r\ndrifting through eighty-seven stanzas, but it is only a final chapter or\r\ncanto of the second book of _The Faery Queen_. Preceding it are eleven\r\nother cantos which serve as an introduction. So leisurely is Spenser in\r\ntelling a tale! One canto deals with the wiles of Archimago and of the\r\n\"false witch\" Duessa; in another the varlet Braggadocchio steals Guyon's\r\nhorse and impersonates a knight, until he is put to shame by the fair\r\nhuntress Belphoebe, who is Queen Elizabeth in disguise. Now Elizabeth had a\r\nhawk face which was far from comely, but behold how it appeared to a poet:\r\n\r\n  Her face so fair, as flesh it seemëd not,\r\n  But heavenly portrait of bright angel's hue,\r\n  Clear as the sky, withouten blame or blot,\r\n  Through goodly mixture of complexions due;\r\n  And in her cheek the vermeil red did shew\r\n  Like roses in a bed of lilies shed,\r\n  The which ambrosial odours from them threw\r\n  And gazers' sense with double pleasure fed,\r\n  Able to heal the sick and to revive the dead.\r\n\r\nThere are a dozen more stanzas devoted to her voice, her eyes, her hair,\r\nher more than mortal beauty. Other cantos of the same book are devoted to\r\nGuyon's temptations; to his victories over Furor and Mammon; to his rescue\r\nof the Lady Alma, besieged by a horde of villains in her fair Castle of\r\nTemperance. In this castle was an aged man, blind but forever doting over\r\nold records; and this gives Spenser the inspiration for another long canto\r\ndevoted to the ancient kings of Britain. So all is fish that comes to this\r\npoet's net; but as one who is angling for trout is vexed by the nibbling of\r\nchubs, the reader grows weary of Spenser's story before his story really\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST BOOK]\r\n\r\nOther books of _The Faery Queen_ are so similar in character to the\r\none just described that a canto from any one of them may be placed without\r\nchange in any other. In the first book, for example, the Redcross Knight\r\n(Holiness) fares forth accompanied by the Lady Una (Religion). Straightway\r\nthey meet the enchanter Archimago, who separates them by fraud and magic.\r\nThe Redcross Knight, led to believe that his Una is false, comes, after\r\nmany adventures, to Queen Lucifera in the House of Pride; meanwhile Una\r\nwanders alone amidst perils, and by her beauty subdues the lion and the\r\nsatyrs of the wood. The rest of the book recounts their adventures with\r\npaynims, giants and monsters, with Error, Avarice, Falsehood and other\r\nallegorical figures.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to outline such a poem, for the simple reason that it has\r\nno outlines. It is a phantasmagoria of beautiful and grotesque shapes, of\r\nromance, morality and magic. Reading it is like watching cloud masses,\r\naloft and remote, in which the imagination pictures men, monsters,\r\nlandscapes, which change as we view them without cause or consequence.\r\nThough _The Faery Queen_ is overfilled with adventure, it has no\r\naction, as we ordinarily understand the term. Its continual motion is\r\nwithout force or direction, like the vague motions of a dream.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLAN OF THE FAERY QUEEN]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was Spenser's object in writing _The Faery Queen_? His\r\nprofessed object was to use poetry in the service of morality by portraying\r\nthe political and religious affairs of England as emblematic of a worldwide\r\nconflict between good and evil. According to his philosophy (which, he\r\ntells us, he borrowed from Aristotle) there were twelve chief virtues, and\r\nhe planned twelve books to celebrate them. [Footnote: Only six of these\r\nbooks are extant, treating of the Redcross Knight or Holiness, Sir Guyon or\r\nTemperance, Britomartis or Chastity, Cambel and Triamond or Friendship, Sir\r\nArtegall or Justice, and Sir Calidore or Courtesy. The rest of the\r\nallegory, if written, may have been destroyed in the fire of Kilcolman.] In\r\neach book a knight or a lady representing a single virtue goes forth into\r\nthe world to conquer evil. In all the books Arthur, or Magnificence (the\r\nsum of all virtue), is apt to appear in any crisis; Lady Una represents\r\nreligion; Archimago is another name for heresy, and Duessa for falsehood;\r\nand in order to give point to Spenser's allegory the courtiers and\r\nstatesmen of the age are all flattered as glorious virtues or condemned as\r\nugly vices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ALLEGORY]\r\n\r\nThose who are fond of puzzles may delight in giving names and dates to\r\nthese allegorical personages, in recognizing Elizabeth in Belphoebe or\r\nBritomart or Marcella, Sidney in the Redcross Knight, Leicester in Arthur,\r\nRaleigh in Timias, Mary Stuart in Duessa, and so on through the list of\r\ncharacters good or evil. The beginner will wisely ignore all such\r\ninterpretation, and for two reasons: first, because Spenser's allegories\r\nare too shadowy to be taken seriously; and second, because as a chronicler\r\nof the times he is outrageously partisan and untrustworthy. In short, to\r\nsearch for any reality in _The Faery Queen_ is to spoil the poem as a\r\nwork of the imagination. \"If you do not meddle with the allegory,\" said\r\nHazlitt, \"the allegory will not meddle with you.\"\r\n\r\nMINOR POEMS. The minor poems of Spenser are more interesting, because more\r\nhuman, than the famous work which we have just considered. Prominent among\r\nthese poems are the _Amoretti_, a collection of sonnets written in\r\nhonor of the Irish girl Elizabeth, who became the poet's wife. They are\r\nartificial, to be sure, but no more so than other love poems of the period.\r\nIn connection with a few of these sonnets may be read Spenser's four\r\n\"Hymns\" (in honor of Love, Beauty, Heavenly Love and Heavenly Beauty) and\r\nespecially his \"Epithalamium,\" a marriage hymn which Brooke calls, with\r\npardonable enthusiasm, \"the most glorious love song in the English\r\nlanguage.\"\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF SPENSER. In reading _The Faery Queen_ one must note the\r\ncontrast between Spenser's matter and his manner. His matter is: religion,\r\nchivalry, mythology, Italian romance, Arthurian legends, the struggles of\r\nSpain and England on the Continent, the Reformation, the turmoil of\r\npolitical parties, the appeal of the New World,--a summary of all stirring\r\nmatters that interested his own tumultuous age. His manner is the reverse\r\nof what one might expect under the circumstances. He writes no stirring\r\nepic of victory or defeat, and never a downright word of a downright man,\r\nbut a dreamy, shadowy narrative as soothing as the abode of Morpheus:\r\n\r\n  And, more to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\n  A trickling stream from high rock tumbling downe,\r\n  And ever-drizzling rain upon the loft,\r\n  Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\n  Of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne.\r\n  No other noyse, nor people's troublous cryes,\r\n  As still are wont t' annoy the wallëd towne,\r\n  Might there be heard; but careless Quiet lyes\r\n  Wrapt in eternal silence far from enemyes.\r\n\r\nSuch stanzas (and they abound in every book of _The Faery Queen_) are\r\npoems in themselves; but unfortunately they distract attention from the\r\nstory, which soon loses all progression and becomes as the rocking of an\r\nidle boat on the swell of a placid sea. The invention of this melodious\r\nstanza, ever since called \"Spenserian,\" was in itself a notable achievement\r\nwhich influenced all subsequent English poetry. [Footnote: The Spenserian\r\nwas an improvement on the _ottava-rima_, or eight-line stanza, of the\r\nItalians. It has been used by Burns in \"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\" by\r\nShelley in \"The Revolt of Islam,\" by Byron in \"Childe Harold,\" by Keats in\r\n\"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" and by many other poets.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPENSER'S FAULTS]\r\n\r\nAs Spenser's faults cannot be ignored, let us be rid of them as quickly as\r\npossible. We record, then: the unreality of his great work; its lack of\r\nhuman interest, which causes most of us to drop the poem after a single\r\ncanto; its affected antique spelling; its use of _fone_ (foes),\r\n_dan_ (master), _teene_ (trouble), _swink_ (labor), and of\r\nmany more obsolete words; its frequent torturing of the king's English to\r\nmake a rime; its utter lack of humor, appearing in such absurd lines as,\r\n\r\n  Astond he stood, and up his hair did hove.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAL IDEAL]\r\n\r\nSuch defects are more than offset by Spenser's poetic virtues. We note,\r\nfirst, the moral purpose which allies him with the medieval poets in aim,\r\nbut not in method. By most medieval romancers virtue was regarded as a\r\nmeans to an end, as in the _Morte d' Arthur_, where a knight made a\r\nvow of purity in order to obtain a sight of the Holy Grail. With Spenser\r\nvirtue is not a means but an end, beautiful and desirable for its own sake;\r\nwhile sin is so pictured that men avoid it because of its intrinsic\r\nugliness. This is the moral secret of _The Faery Queen_, in which\r\nvirtues are personified as noble knights or winsome women, while the vices\r\nappear in the repulsive guise of hags, monsters and \"loathy beasts.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SENSE OF BEAUTY]\r\n\r\nSpenser's sense of ideal beauty or, as Lanier expressed it, \"the beauty of\r\nholiness and the holiness of beauty,\" is perhaps his greatest poetic\r\nquality. He is the poet-painter of the Renaissance; he fills his pages with\r\ndescriptions of airy loveliness, as Italian artists covered the high\r\nceilings of Venice with the reflected splendor of earth and heaven.\r\nMoreover, his sense of beauty found expression in such harmonious lines\r\nthat one critic describes him as having set beautiful figures moving to\r\nexquisite music.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this beauty and melody, Spenser has been the inspiration\r\nof nearly all later English singers. Milton was one of the first to call\r\nhim master, and then in a long succession such diverse poets as Dryden,\r\nBurns, Wordsworth, Scott, Shelley, Keats, Byron, Tennyson and Swinburne.\r\nThe poet of \"Faery\" has influenced all these and more so deeply that he has\r\nwon the distinctive title of \"the poets' poet.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMATISTS\r\n\r\n\"Few events in our literary history are so startling as this sudden rise of\r\nthe Elizabethan drama,\" says Green in his _History of the English\r\nPeople_, and his judgment is echoed by other writers who speak of the\r\n\"marvelous efflorescence\" of the English drama as a matter beyond\r\nexplanation. Startling it may be, with its frank expression of a nation's\r\nlife, the glory and the shame of it; but there is nothing sudden or\r\ninexplicable about it, as we may see by reviewing the history of\r\nplaywriting in England.\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS DRAMA. In its simplicity the drama is a familiar story retold\r\nto the eye by actors who \"make believe\" that they are the heroes of the\r\naction. In this elemental form the play is almost as old as humanity.\r\nIndeed, it seems to be a natural impulse of children to act a story which\r\nhas given them pleasure; of primitive men also, who from time immemorial\r\nhave kept alive the memory of tribal heroes by representing their deeds in\r\nplay or pantomime. Thus, certain parts of _Hiawatha_ are survivals of\r\ndramatic myths that were once acted at the spring assembly of the Algonquin\r\nIndians. An interesting fact concerning these primitive dramas, whether in\r\nIndia or Greece or Persia, is that they were invariably associated with\r\nsome religious belief or festival.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST MIRACLES]\r\n\r\nA later example of this is found in the Church, which at an early age began\r\nto make its holy-day services more impressive by means of Miracle plays and\r\nMysteries. [Footnote: In France any play representing the life of a saint\r\nwas called _miracle_, and a play dealing with the life of Christ was\r\ncalled _mystère_. In England no such distinction was made, the name\r\n\"Miracle\" being given to any drama dealing with Bible history or with the\r\nlives of the saints.] At Christmas time, for example, the beautiful story\r\nof Bethlehem would be made more vivid by placing in a corner of the parish\r\nchurch an image of a babe in a manger, with shepherds and the Magi at hand,\r\nand the choir in white garments chanting the _Gloria in excelsis_.\r\nOther festivals were celebrated in a similar way until a cycle of simple\r\ndramas had been prepared, clustering around four cardinal points of\r\nChristian teaching; namely, Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Doomsday or\r\nthe Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROWTH OF THE MIRACLES]\r\n\r\nAt first such plays were given in the church, and were deeply religious in\r\nspirit. They made a profound impression in England especially, where people\r\nflocked in such numbers to see them that presently they overflowed to the\r\nchurchyard, and from there to the city squares or the town common. Once\r\noutside the church, they were taken up by the guilds or trades-unions, in\r\nwhose hands they lost much of their religious character. Actors were\r\ntrained for the stage rather than for the church, and to please the crowds\r\nelements of comedy and buffoonery were introduced, [Footnote: In the\r\n\"Shepherd's Play\" or \"Play of the Nativity,\" for example, the adoration of\r\nthe Magi is interrupted by Mak, who steals a sheep and carries it to his\r\nwife. She hides the carcass in a cradle, and sings a lullaby to it while\r\nthe indignant shepherds are searching the house.] until the sacred drama\r\ndegenerated into a farce. Here and there, however, a true Miracle survived\r\nand kept its character unspotted even to our own day, as in the famous\r\nPassion Play at Oberammergau.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CYCLES OF PLAYS]\r\n\r\nWhen and how these plays came to England is unknown. By the year 1300 they\r\nwere extremely popular, and continued so until they were replaced by the\r\nElizabethan drama. Most of the important towns of England had each its own\r\ncycle of plays [Footnote: At present only four good cycles of Miracles are\r\nknown to exist; namely, the Chester, York, Townley (or Wakefield) and\r\nCoventry plays. The number of plays varies, from twenty-five in the Chester\r\nto forty-eight in the York cycle.] which were given once a year, the\r\nperformance lasting from three to eight days in a prolonged festival. Every\r\nguild responsible for a play had its own stage, which was set on wheels and\r\ndrawn about the town to appointed open places, where a crowd was waiting\r\nfor it. When it passed on, to repeat the play to a different audience,\r\nanother stage took its place. The play of \"Creation\" would be succeeded by\r\nthe \"Temptation of Adam and Eve,\" and so on until the whole cycle of\r\nMiracles from \"Creation\" to \"Doomsday\" had been performed. It was the play\r\nnot the audience that moved, and in this trundling about of the stage van\r\nwe are reminded of Thespis, the alleged founder of Greek tragedy, who went\r\nabout with his cart and his play from one festival to another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORALITIES]\r\n\r\nTwo other dramatic types, the Morality and the Interlude, probably grew out\r\nof the religious drama. In one of the old Miracles we find two characters\r\nnamed Truth and Righteousness, who are severe in their denunciation of\r\nAdam, while Mercy and Peace plead for his life. Other virtues appear in\r\nother Miracles, then Death and the Seven Deadly Sins, until we have a play\r\nin which all the characters are personified virtues or vices. Such a play\r\nwas called a Morality, and it aimed to teach right conduct, as the Miracles\r\nhad at first aimed to teach right doctrine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTERLUDES]\r\n\r\nThe Interlude was at first a crude sketch, a kind of ancient side show,\r\nintroduced into the Miracle plays after the latter had been taken up by the\r\nguilds. A boy with a trained pig, a quarrel between husband and wife,--any\r\nfarce was welcome so long as it amused the crowd or enlivened the Miracle.\r\nIn time, however, the writing of Interludes became a profession; they\r\nimproved rapidly in character, were separated from the Miracles, and were\r\nperformed at entertainments or \"revels\" by trade guilds, by choir boys and\r\nby companies of strolling actors or \"minstrels.\" At the close of such\r\nentertainments the minstrels would add a prayer for the king (an\r\ninheritance from the religious drama), and this impressive English custom\r\nstill survives in the singing of \"God Save the King\" at the end of a public\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nTHE SECULAR DRAMA. When the Normans came to England they brought with them\r\na love of pageants, or spectacles, that was destined to have an important\r\ninfluence on the drama. These pageants, representing scenes from history or\r\nmythology (such as the bout between Richard and Saladin, or the combat\r\nbetween St. George and the Dragon), were staged to celebrate feasts, royal\r\nweddings, treaties or any other event that seemed of special importance.\r\nFrom Norman times they increased steadily in favor until Elizabeth began\r\nher \"progresses\" through England, when every castle or town must prepare a\r\nplay or pageant to entertain the royal visitor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MASQUE]\r\n\r\nFrom simple pantomime the pageant developed into a masque; that is, a\r\ndramatic entertainment accompanied by poetry and music. Hundreds of such\r\nmasques were written and acted before Shakespeare's day; the taste for them\r\nsurvived long after the Elizabethan drama had decayed; and a few of them,\r\nsuch as _The Sad Shepherd_ of Ben Jonson and the _Comus_ of\r\nMilton, may still be read with pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POPULAR COMEDY]\r\n\r\nWhile the nobles were thus occupied with pageants and masques, the common\r\npeople were developing a crude drama in which comedy predominated. Such\r\nwere the Christmas plays or \"mummings,\" introducing the characters of Merry\r\nAndrew and Old King Cole, which began in England before the Conquest, and\r\nwhich survived in country places down to our own times. [Footnote: In\r\nHardy's novel _The Return of the Native_ may be found a description of\r\nthese mummings (from \"mum,\" a mask) in the nineteenth century. In Scott's\r\nnovel _The Abbot_ we have a glimpse of other mummings, such as were\r\ngiven to celebrate feast days of the Church.] More widespread than the\r\nmummings were crude spectacles prepared in celebration of secular\r\nholidays,--the May Day plays, for example, which represented the adventures\r\nof Robin Hood and his merry men. To these popular comedies the Church\r\ncontributed liberally, though unwillingly; its holy days became holidays to\r\nthe crowd, and its solemn fasts were given over to merriment, to the\r\n_festa fatuorum_, or play of fools, in which such characters as Boy\r\nBishop, Lord of Misrule and various clowns or jesters made a scandalous\r\ncaricature of things ecclesiastical. Such plays, prepared largely by clerks\r\nand choir boys, were repeatedly denounced by priest or bishop, but they\r\nincreased rapidly from the twelfth to the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPREAD OF THE DRAMA]\r\n\r\nBy the latter date England seemed in danger of going spectacle-mad; and we\r\nmay understand the symptoms if we remember that the play was then almost\r\nthe only form of popular amusement; that it took the place of the modern\r\nnewspaper, novel, political election and ball game, all combined. The trade\r\nguilds, having trained actors for the springtime Miracles, continued to\r\ngive other plays throughout the year. The servants of a nobleman, having\r\ngiven a pageant to welcome the queen, went out through the country in\r\nsearch of money or adventure, and presented the same spectacle wherever\r\nthey could find an audience. When the Renaissance came, reviving interest\r\nin the classics, Latin plays were taken up eagerly and presented in\r\nmodified form by every important school or university in England. In this\r\nway our first regular comedy, _Ralph Royster Doyster_ (written by\r\nNicholas Udall, Master of Eton, and acted by his schoolboys _cir_.\r\n1552), was adapted from an old Latin comedy, the _Miles Gloriosus_ of\r\nPlautus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOY ACTORS]\r\n\r\nThe awakened interest in music had also its influences on the English\r\ndrama. The choir boys of a church were frequently called upon to furnish\r\nmusic at a play, and from this it was but a step to furnish both the play\r\nand the music. So great was the demand to hear these boys that certain\r\nchoir masters (those of St. Paul's and the Chapel Royal) obtained the right\r\nto take any poor boy with a good voice and train him, ostensibly for the\r\nservice of the Church, but in reality to make a profitable actor out of\r\nhim. This dangerous practice was stimulated by the fact that the feminine\r\nparts in all plays had to be taken by boys, the stage being then deemed an\r\nunfit place for a woman. And it certainly was. If a boy \"took to his\r\nlines,\" his services were sold from one company to another, much as the\r\npopular ball player is now sold, but with this difference, that the poor\r\nboy had no voice or profit in the transaction. Some of these lads were\r\ncruelly treated; all were in danger of moral degradation. The abuse was\r\nfinally suppressed by Parliament, but not until the choir-boy players were\r\nrivals of the regular companies, in which Shakespeare and Ben Jonson played\r\ntheir parts.\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL AND ENGLISH DRAMA. At the time of Shakespeare's birth two types\r\nof plays were represented in England. The classic drama, modeled upon Greek\r\nor Roman plays, was constructed according to the dramatic \"unities,\" which\r\nAristotle foreshadowed in his _Treatise on Poetry_. According to this\r\nauthority, every play must be concerned with a \"single, important and\r\ncomplete event\"; in other words, it must have \"unity of action.\" A second\r\nrule, relating to \"unity of time,\" required that the events represented in\r\na play must all occur within a single day. A third provided that the action\r\nshould take place in the same locality, and this was known as the \"unity of\r\nplace.\" [Footnote: The Roman philosopher and dramatist Seneca (d. 65 A.D.)\r\nis supposed to have established this rule. The influence of Aristotle on\r\nthe \"unities\" is a matter of dispute.] Other rules of classic drama\r\nrequired that tragedy and comedy should not occur in the same play, and\r\nthat battles, murders and all such violent affairs should never be\r\nrepresented on the stage but be announced at the proper time by a\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NATIVE DRAMA]\r\n\r\nThe native plays ignored these classic unities. The public demanded\r\nchronicle plays, for example, in which the action must cover years of time,\r\nand jump from court to battlefield in following the hero. Tragedy and\r\ncomedy, instead of being separated, were represented as meeting at every\r\ncrossroad or entering the church door side by side. So the most solemn\r\nMiracles were scandalized by humorous Interludes, and into the most tragic\r\nof Shakespeare's scenes entered the fool and the jester. A Greek playwright\r\nmight object to brutalizing scenes before a cultured audience, but the\r\ncrowds who came to an Elizabethan play were of a temper to enjoy a Mohawk\r\nscalp dance. They were accustomed to violent scenes and sensations; they\r\nhad witnessed the rack and gibbet in constant operation; they were familiar\r\nwith the sight of human heads decorating the posts of London Bridge or\r\ncarried about on the pikes of soldiers. After witnessing such horrors free\r\nof cost, they would follow their queen and pay their money to see a chained\r\nbear torn to pieces by ferocious bulldogs. Then they would go to a play,\r\nand throw stones or dead cats at the actors if their tastes were not\r\ngratified.\r\n\r\nTo please such crowds no stage action could possibly be too rough; hence\r\nthe riotousness of the early theaters, which for safety were placed outside\r\nthe city limits; hence also the blood and thunder of Shakespeare's\r\n_Adronicus_ and the atrocities represented in the plays of Kyd and\r\nMarlowe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TWO SCHOOLS]\r\n\r\nFollowing such different ideals, two schools of playwrights appeared in\r\nEngland. One school, the University Wits, to whom we owe our first real\r\ntragedy, _Gorboduc_, [Footnote: This play, called also _Ferrex and\r\nPorrex_, was written by Sackville and Norton, and played in 1562, only\r\ntwo years before Shakespeare's birth. It related how Gorboduc divided his\r\nBritish kingdom between his two sons, who quarreled and threw the whole\r\ncountry into rebellion--a story much like that used by Shakespeare in\r\n_King Lear_. The violent parts of this first tragedy were not\r\nrepresented on the stage but were announced by a messenger. At the end of\r\neach act a \"chorus\" summed up the situation, as in classic tragedy.\r\n_Gorboduc_ differed from all earlier plays in that it was divided into\r\nacts and scenes, and was written in blank verse. It is generally regarded\r\nas the first in time of the Elizabethan dramas. A few comedies divided into\r\nacts and scenes were written before _Gorboduc_, but not in the blank\r\nverse with which we associate an Elizabethan play.] aimed to make the\r\nEnglish drama like that of Greece and Rome. The other, or native, school\r\naimed at a play which should represent life, or please the crowd, without\r\nregard to any rules ancient or modern. The best Elizabethan drama was a\r\ncombination of classic and native elements, with the latter predominating.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S PREDECESSORS. In a general way, all unknown men who for three\r\ncenturies had been producing miracle plays, moralities, interludes, masques\r\nand pageants were Shakespeare's predecessors; but we refer here to a small\r\ngroup of playwrights who rapidly developed what is now called the\r\nElizabethan drama. The time was the last quarter of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nBy that time England was as excited over the stage as a modern community\r\nover the \"movies.\" Plays were given on every important occasion by choir\r\nboys, by noblemen's servants, by court players governed by the Master of\r\nRevels, by grammar schools and universities, by trade guilds in every shire\r\nof England. Actors were everywhere in training, and audiences gathered as\r\nto a bull-baiting whenever a new spectacle was presented. Then came the\r\nawakening of the national consciousness, the sense of English pride and\r\npower after the defeat of the Armada, and this new national spirit found\r\nexpression in hundreds of chronicle plays representing the past glories of\r\nBritain. [Footnote: Over two hundred chronicle plays, representing almost\r\nevery important character in English history, appeared within a few years.\r\nShakespeare wrote thirteen plays founded on English history, and three on\r\nthe history of other countries.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this \"psychological moment,\" when English patriotism was aroused\r\nand London was as the heart of England, that a group of young\r\nactors--Greene, Lyly, Peele, Dekker, Nash, Kyd, Marlowe, and others of less\r\ndegree--seized upon the crude popular drama, enlarged it to meet the needs\r\nof the time, and within a single generation made it such a brilliant\r\nreflection of national thought and feeling as no other age has thus far\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMARLOWE. The best of these early playwrights, each of whom contributed some\r\nelement of value, was Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), who is sometimes\r\ncalled the father of the Elizabethan drama. He appeared in London sometime\r\nbefore 1587, when his first drama _Tamburlaine_ took the city by\r\nstorm. The prologue of this drama is at once a criticism and a promise:\r\n\r\n  From jigging veins of rhyming mother-wits,\r\n  And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay,\r\n  We'll lead you to the stately tent of war,\r\n  Where you shall hear the Scythian Tamburlaine\r\n  Threatening the world with high-astounding terms,\r\n  And scourging kingdoms with his conquering sword.\r\n\r\nThe \"jigging\" refers to the doggerel verse of the earlier drama, and\r\n\"clownage\" to the crude horseplay intended to amuse the crowd. For the\r\ndoggerel is substituted blank verse, \"Marlowe's mighty line\" as it has ever\r\nsince been called, since he was the first to use it with power; and for the\r\n\"clownage\" he promises a play of human interest revolving around a man\r\nwhose sole ambition is for world power,--such ambition as stirred the\r\nEnglish nation when it called halt to the encroachments of Spain, and\r\nannounced that henceforth it must be reckoned with in the councils of the\r\nContinent. Though _Tamburlaine_ is largely rant and bombast, there is\r\nsomething in it which fascinates us like the sight of a wild bull on a\r\nrampage; for such was Timur, the hero of the first play to which we\r\nconfidently give the name Elizabethan. In the latter part of the play the\r\naction grows more intense; there is a sense of tragedy, of impending doom,\r\nin the vain attempt of the hero to oppose fate. He can conquer a world but\r\nnot his own griefs; he ends his triumphant career with a pathetic admission\r\nof failure: \"And Tamburlaine, the Scourge of God, must die.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARLOWE'S DRAMAS]\r\n\r\nThe succeeding plays of Marlowe are all built on the same model; that is,\r\nthey are one-man plays, and the man is dominated by a passion for power.\r\n_Doctor Faustus_, the most poetical of Marlowe's works, is a play\r\nrepresenting a scholar who hungers for more knowledge, especially the\r\nknowledge of magic. In order to obtain it he makes a bargain with the\r\ndevil, selling his soul for twenty-four years of unlimited power and\r\npleasure. [Footnote: The story is the same as that of Goethe's\r\n_Faust_. It was a favorite story, or rather collection of stories, of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and was first printed as the _History of Johann\r\nFaust_ in Frankfort, in 1587. Marlowe's play was written, probably, in\r\nthe same year.] _The Jew of Malta_ deals with the lust for such power\r\nas wealth gives, and the hero is the money-lender Barabas, a monster of\r\navarice and hate, who probably suggested to Shakespeare the character of\r\nShylock in _The Merchant of Venice_. The last play written by Marlowe\r\nwas _Edward II_, which dealt with a man who might have been powerful,\r\nsince he was a king, but who furnished a terrible example of weakness and\r\npetty tyranny that ended miserably in a dungeon.\r\n\r\nAfter writing these four plays with their extraordinary promise, Marlowe,\r\nwho led a wretched life, was stabbed in a tavern brawl. The splendid work\r\nwhich he only began (for he died under thirty years of age) was immediately\r\ntaken up by the greatest of all dramatists, Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564-1616)\r\n\r\n    \"The name of Shakespeare is the greatest in all literature. No man\r\n    ever came near to him in the creative power of the mind; no man\r\n    ever had such strength and such variety of imagination.\" (Hallam)\r\n\r\n    \"Shakespeare's mind is the horizon beyond which, at present, we do\r\n    not see.\" (Emerson)\r\n\r\n    \"I do not believe that any book or person or event in my life ever\r\n    made so great an impression on me as the plays of Shakespeare. They\r\n    appear to be the work of some heavenly genius.\" (Goethe)\r\n\r\nShakespeare's name has become a signal for enthusiasm. The tributes quoted\r\nabove are doubtless extravagant, but they were written by men of mark in\r\nthree different countries, and they serve to indicate the tremendous\r\nimpression which Shakespeare has left upon the world. He wrote in his day\r\nsome thirty-seven plays and a few poems; since then as many hundred volumes\r\nhave been written in praise of his accomplishment. He died three centuries\r\nago, without caring enough for his own work to print it. At the present\r\ntime unnumbered critics, historians, scholars, are still explaining the\r\nmind and the art displayed in that same neglected work. Most of these\r\neulogists begin or end their volumes with the remark that Shakespeare is so\r\ngreat as to be above praise or criticism. As Taine writes, before plunging\r\ninto his own analysis, \"Lofty words, eulogies are all used in vain;\r\nShakespeare needs not praise but comprehension merely.\"\r\n\r\n    LIFE. It is probably because so very little is known about\r\n    Shakespeare that so many bulky biographies have been written of\r\n    him. Not a solitary letter of his is known to exist; not a play\r\n    comes down to us as he wrote it. A few documents written by other\r\n    men, and sometimes ending in a sprawling signature by Shakespeare,\r\n    which looks as if made by a hand accustomed to almost any labor\r\n    except that of the pen,--these are all we have to build upon. One\r\n    record, in dribbling Latin, relates to the christening of\r\n    \"Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere\"; a second, unreliable as a\r\n    village gossip, tells an anecdote of the same person's boyhood; a\r\n    third refers to Shakespeare as \"one of his Majesty's poor players\";\r\n    a fourth records the burial of the poet's son Hamnet; a fifth\r\n    speaks of \"Willi. Shakspere, gentleman\"; a sixth is a bit of\r\n    wretched doggerel inscribed on the poet's tombstone; a seventh\r\n    tells us that in 1622, only six years after the poet's death, the\r\n    public had so little regard for his art that the council of his\r\n    native Stratford bribed his old company of players to go away from\r\n    the town without giving a performance.\r\n\r\n    It is from such dry and doubtful records that we must construct a\r\n    biography, supplementing the meager facts by liberal use of our\r\n    imagination.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: EARLY DAYS]\r\n\r\n    In the beautiful Warwickshire village of Stratford our poet was\r\n    born, probably in the month of April, in 1564. His mother, Mary\r\n    Arden, was a farmer's daughter; his father was a butcher and small\r\n    tradesman, who at one time held the office of high bailiff of the\r\n    village. There was a small grammar school in Stratford, and\r\n    Shakespeare may have attended it for a few years. When he was about\r\n    fourteen years old his father, who was often in lawsuits, was\r\n    imprisoned for debt, and the boy probably left school and went to\r\n    work. At eighteen he married Anne Hathaway, a peasant's daughter\r\n    eight years older than himself; at twenty-three, with his father\r\n    still in debt and his own family of three children to provide for,\r\n    Shakespeare took the footpath that led to the world beyond his\r\n    native village. [Footnote: Such is the prevalent opinion of\r\n    Shakespeare's early days; but we are dealing here with surmises,\r\n    not with established facts. There are scholars who allege that\r\n    Shakespeare's poverty is a myth; that his father was prosperous to\r\n    the end of his days; that he probably took the full course in Latin\r\n    and Greek at the Stratford school. Almost everything connected with\r\n    the poet's youth is still a matter of dispute.]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: IN LONDON]\r\n\r\n    From Stratford he went to London, from solitude to crowds, from\r\n    beautiful rural scenes to dirty streets, from natural country\r\n    people to seekers after the bubble of fame or fortune. Why he went\r\n    is largely a matter of speculation. That he was looking for work;\r\n    that he followed a company of actors, as a boy follows a circus;\r\n    that he was driven out of Stratford after poaching on the game\r\n    preserves of Sir Thomas Lucy, whom he ridiculed in the plays of\r\n    _Henry VI_ and _Merry Wives_,--these and other theories\r\n    are still debated. The most probable explanation of his departure\r\n    is that the stage lured him away, as the printing press called the\r\n    young Franklin from whatever else he undertook; for he seems to\r\n    have headed straight for the theater, and to have found his place\r\n    not by chance or calculation but by unerring instinct. England was\r\n    then, as we have noted, in danger of going stage mad, and\r\n    Shakespeare appeared to put method into the madness.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: ACTOR AND PLAYWRIGHT]\r\n\r\n    Beginning, undoubtedly, as an actor of small parts, he soon learned\r\n    the tricks of the stage and the humors of his audience. His first\r\n    dramatic work was to revise old plays, giving them some new twist\r\n    or setting to please the fickle public. Then he worked with other\r\n    playwrights, with Lyly and Peele perhaps, and the horrors of his\r\n    _Titus Andronicus_ are sufficient evidence of his\r\n    collaboration with Marlowe. Finally he walked alone, having learned\r\n    his steps, and _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Midsummer Nights\r\n    Dream_ announced that a great poet and dramatist had suddenly\r\n    appeared in England.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE LIBRARY, STRATFORD GRAMMAR SCHOOL ATTENDED BY\r\n    SHAKESPEARE]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PERIOD OF GLOOM]\r\n\r\n    This experimental period of Shakespeare's life in London was\r\n    apparently a time of health, of joyousness, of enthusiasm which\r\n    comes with the successful use of one's powers. It was followed by a\r\n    period of gloom and sorrow, to which something of bitterness was\r\n    added. What occasioned the change is again a matter of speculation.\r\n    The first conjecture is that Shakespeare was a man to whom the low\r\n    ideals of the Elizabethan stage were intolerable, and this opinion\r\n    is strengthened after reading certain of Shakespeare's sonnets,\r\n    which reflect a loathing for the theaters and the mannerless crowds\r\n    that filled them. Another conjectural cause of his gloom was the\r\n    fate of certain noblemen with whom he was apparently on terms of\r\n    friendship, to whom he dedicated his poems, and from whom he\r\n    received substantial gifts of money. Of these powerful friends, the\r\n    Earl of Essex was beheaded for treason, Pembroke was banished, and\r\n    Southampton had gone to that grave of so many high hopes, the Tower\r\n    of London. Shakespeare may have shared the sorrow of these men, as\r\n    once he had shared their joy, and there are critics who assume that\r\n    he was personally implicated in the crazy attempt of Essex at\r\n    rebellion.\r\n\r\n    Whatever the cause of his grief, Shakespeare shows in his works\r\n    that he no longer looks on the world with the clear eyes of youth.\r\n    The great tragedies of this period, _Lear_, _Macbeth_,\r\n    _Hamlet_, _Othello_ and _Cæsar_, all portray man not\r\n    as a being of purpose and high destiny, but as the sport of chance,\r\n    the helpless victim who cries out, as in _Henry IV_, for a\r\n    sight of the Book of Fate, wherein is shown\r\n\r\n                           how chances mock,\r\n      And changes fill the cup of alteration\r\n      With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,\r\n      The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,\r\n      What perils past, what crosses to ensue,\r\n      Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: RETURN TO STRATFORD]\r\n\r\n    For such a terrible mood London offered no remedy. For a time\r\n    Shakespeare seems to have gloried in the city; then he wearied of\r\n    it, grew disgusted with the stage, and finally, after some\r\n    twenty-four years (_cir_. 1587-1611), sold his interest in the\r\n    theaters, shook the dust of London from his feet, and followed his\r\n    heart back to Stratford. There he adopted the ways of a country\r\n    gentleman, and there peace and serenity returned to him. He wrote\r\n    comparatively little after his retirement; but the few plays of\r\n    this last period, such as _Cymbeline_, _Winter's Tale_\r\n    and _The Tempest_, are the mellowest of all his works.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SHAKESPEARE THE MAN]\r\n\r\n    After a brief period of leisure, Shakespeare died at his prime in\r\n    1616, and was buried in the parish church of Stratford. Of his\r\n    great works, now the admiration of the world, he thought so little\r\n    that he never collected or printed them. From these works many\r\n    attempts are made to determine the poet's character, beliefs,\r\n    philosophy,--a difficult matter, since the works portray many types\r\n    of character and philosophy equally well. The testimony of a few\r\n    contemporaries is more to the point, and from these we hear that\r\n    our poet was \"very good company,\" \"of such civil demeanor,\" \"of\r\n    such happy industry,\" \"of such excellent fancy and brave notions,\"\r\n    that he won in a somewhat brutal age the characteristic title of\r\n    \"the gentle Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMAS OF SHAKESPEARE. In Shakespeare's day playwrights were producing\r\nvarious types of drama: the chronicle play, representing the glories of\r\nEnglish history; the domestic drama, portraying homely scenes and common\r\npeople; the court comedy (called also Lylian comedy, after the dramatist\r\nwho developed it), abounding in wit and repartee for the delight of the\r\nupper classes; the melodrama, made up of sensational elements thrown\r\ntogether without much plot; the tragedy of blood, centering in one\r\ncharacter who struggles amidst woes and horrors; romantic comedy and\r\nromantic tragedy, in which men and women were more or less idealized, and\r\nin which the elements of love, poetry, romance, youthful imagination and\r\nenthusiasm predominated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNE HATHAWAY'S COTTAGE]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Shakespeare essayed all these types--the\r\nchronicle play in _Henry IV_, the domestic drama in _Merry\r\nWives_, the court comedy in _Loves Labor's Lost_, the melodrama in\r\n_Richard III_, the tragedy of blood in _King Lear_, romantic\r\ntragedy in _Romeo and Juliet_, romantic comedy in _As You Like\r\nIt_--and that in each he showed such a mastery as to raise him far above\r\nall his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EARLY DRAMAS]\r\n\r\nIn his experimental period of work (_cir_. 1590-1595) Shakespeare\r\nbegan by revising old plays in conjunction with other actors. _Henry\r\nVI_ is supposed to be an example of such tinkering work. The first part\r\nof this play (performed by Shakespeare's company in 1592) was in all\r\nprobability an older work made over by Shakespeare and some unknown\r\ndramatist. From the fact that Joan of Arc appears in the play in two\r\nentirely different characters, and is even made to do battle at Rouen\r\nseveral years after her death, it is almost certain that _Henry VI_ in\r\nits present form was composed at different times and by different authors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAIN ROOM, ANNE HATHAWAY'S COTTAGE]\r\n\r\n_Love's Labor's Lost_ is an example of the poet's first independent\r\nwork. In this play such characters as Holofernes the schoolmaster, Costard\r\nthe clown and Adriano the fantastic Spaniard are all plainly of the \"stock\"\r\nvariety; various rimes and meters are used experimentally; blank verse is\r\nnot mastered; and some of the songs, such as \"On a Day,\" are more or less\r\nartificial. Other plays of this early experimental period are _Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona_ and _Richard III_, the latter of which shows\r\nthe influence and, possibly, the collaboration of Marlowe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SECOND PERIOD]\r\n\r\nIn the second period (_cir_. 1595-1600) Shakespeare constructed his\r\nplots with better skill, showed a greater mastery of blank verse, created\r\nsome original characters, and especially did he give free rein to his\r\nromantic imagination. All doubt and experiment vanished in the confident\r\nenthusiasm of this period, as if Shakespeare felt within himself the coming\r\nof the sunrise in _Romeo and Juliet_:\r\n\r\n  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\n  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\r\n\r\nThough some of his later plays are more carefully finished, in none of them\r\nare we so completely under the sway of poetry and romance as in these early\r\nworks, written when Shakespeare first felt the thrill of mastery in his\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn _Midsummer Nights Dream_, for example, the practical affairs of\r\nlife seem to smother its poetic dreams; but note how the dream abides with\r\nus after the play is over. The spell of the enchanted forest is broken when\r\nthe crowd invades its solitude; the witchery of moonlight fades into the\r\nlight of common day; and then comes Theseus with his dogs to drive not the\r\nfoxes but the fairies out of the landscape. As Chesterton points out, this\r\nmasterful man, who has seen no fairies, proceeds to arrange matters in a\r\npractical way, with a wedding, a feast and a pantomime, as if these were\r\nthe chief things of life. So, he thinks, the drama is ended; but after he\r\nand his noisy followers have departed to slumber, lo! enter once more Puck,\r\nOberon, Titania and the whole train of fairies, to repeople the ancient\r\nworld and dance to the music of Mendelssohn:\r\n\r\n  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,\r\n  While we sing, and bless this place.\r\n\r\nSo in _The Merchant of Venice_ with its tragic figure of Shylock, who\r\nis hurried off the stage to make place for a final scene of love, moonlight\r\nand music; so in every other play of this period, the poetic dream of life\r\ntriumphs over its practical realities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THIRD PERIOD]\r\n\r\nDuring the third period, of maturity of power (_cir._ 1600-1610),\r\nShakespeare was overshadowed by some personal grief or disappointment. He\r\nwrote his \"farewell to mirth\" in _Twelfth Night_, and seems to have\r\nreflected his own perturbed state in the lines which he attributes to\r\nAchilles in _Troilus and Cressida_:\r\n\r\n  My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd,\r\n  And I myself see not the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nHis great tragedies belong to this period, tragedies which reveal increased\r\ndramatic power in Shakespeare, but also his loss of hope, his horrible\r\nconviction that man is not a free being but a puppet blown about by every\r\nwind of fate or circumstance. In _Hamlet_ great purposes wait upon a\r\nfeeble will, and the strongest purpose may be either wrecked or consummated\r\nby a trifle. The whole conception of humanity in this play suggests a\r\nclock, of which, if but one small wheel is touched, all the rest are thrown\r\ninto confusion. In _Macbeth_ a man of courage and vaulting ambition\r\nturns coward or traitor at the appearance of a ghost, at the gibber of\r\nwitches, at the whisper of conscience, at the taunts of his wife. In\r\n_King Lear_ a monarch of high disposition drags himself and others\r\ndown to destruction, not at the stern command of fate, but at the mere\r\nsuggestion of foolishness. In _Othello_ love, faith, duty, the\r\nfidelity of a brave man, the loyalty of a pure woman,--all are blasted,\r\nwrecked, dishonored by a mere breath of suspicion blown by a villain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAST DRAMAS]\r\n\r\nIn his final period, of leisurely experiment (_cir._ 1610-1616),\r\nShakespeare seems to have recovered in Stratford the cheerfulness that he\r\nhad lost in London. He did little work during this period, but that little\r\nis of rare charm and sweetness. He no longer portrayed human life as a\r\ncomedy of errors or a tragedy of weakness but as a glowing romance, as if\r\nthe mellow autumn of his own life had tinged all the world with its own\r\ngolden hues. With the exception of _As You Like It_ (written in the\r\nsecond period), in which brotherhood is pictured as the end of life, and\r\nlove as its unfailing guide, it is doubtful if any of the earlier plays\r\nleaves such a wholesome impression as _The Winter's Tale_ or _The\r\nTempest_, which were probably the last of the poet's works.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a list of Shakespeare's thirty-four plays (or thirty-seven,\r\ncounting the different parts of _Henry IV_ and _Henry VI_)\r\narranged according to the periods in which they were probably written. The\r\ndates are approximate, not exact, and the chronological order is open to\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD, EARLY EXPERIMENT (1590-1595). _Titus Andronicus_,\r\n_Henry VI_, _Love's Labor's Lost_, _Comedy of Errors_,\r\n_Two Gentlemen of Verona_, _Richard III_, _Richard II_,\r\n_King John._\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD, DEVELOPMENT (1595-1600). _Romeo and Juliet_,\r\n_Midsummer Night's Dream_, _Merchant of Venice_, _Henry IV_,\r\n_Henry V_, _Merry Wives of Windsor_, _Much Ado About\r\nNothing_, _As You Like It._\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD, MATURITY AND TROUBLE (1600-1610). _Twelfth Night_,\r\n_Taming of the Shrew_, _Julius Caesar_, _Hamlet_, _Troilus\r\nand Cressida_, _All's Well that Ends Well_, _Measure for\r\nMeasure_, _Othello_, _King Lear_, _Macbeth_, _Antony\r\nand Cleopatra_, _Timon of Athens._\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD, LATER EXPERIMENT (1610-1616). _Coriolanus_,\r\n_Pericles_, _Cymbeline_, _The Winter's Tale_, _The\r\nTempest_, _Henry VIII_ (left unfinished, completed probably by\r\nFletcher).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRAGEDY AND COMEDY]\r\n\r\nThe most convenient arrangement of these plays appears in the First Folio\r\n(1623) [Footnote: This was the first edition of Shakespeare's plays. It was\r\nprepared seven years after the poet's death by two of his fellow actors,\r\nHeminge and Condell. It contained all the plays now attributed to\r\nShakespeare with the exception of _Pericles_.] where they are grouped\r\nin three classes called tragedies, comedies and historical plays. The\r\ntragedy is a drama in which the characters are the victims of unhappy\r\npassions, or are involved in desperate circumstances. The style is grave\r\nand dignified, the movement stately; the ending is disastrous to\r\nindividuals, but illustrates the triumph of a moral principle. These rules\r\nof true tragedy are repeatedly set aside by Shakespeare, who introduces\r\nelements of buffoonery, and who contrives an ending that may stand for the\r\ntriumph of a principle but that is quite likely to be the result of\r\naccident or madness. His best tragedies are _Macbeth_, _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, _Hamlet_, _King Lear_ and _Othello_.\r\n\r\nComedy is a type of drama in which the elements of fun and humor\r\npredominate. The style is gay; the action abounds in unexpected incidents;\r\nthe ending brings ridicule or punishment to the villains in the plot, and\r\nsatisfaction to all worthy characters. Among the best of Shakespeare's\r\ncomedies, in which he is apt to introduce serious or tragic elements, are\r\n_As You Like It_, _Merchant of Venice_, _Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_, _The Winter's Tale_, and _The Tempest_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAWDOR CASTLE, SCOTLAND, ASSOCIATED WITH MACBETH]\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking there are only two dramatic types, all others, such as\r\nfarce, melodrama, tragi-comedy, lyric drama, or opera, and chronicle play,\r\nbeing modifications of comedy or tragedy. The historical play, to which\r\nElizabethans were devoted, aimed to present great scenes or characters from\r\na past age, and were generally made up of both tragic and comic elements.\r\nThe best of Shakespeare's historical plays are _Julius Cæsar_,\r\n_Henry IV_, _Henry V_, _Richard III_ and _Coriolanus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHAT TO READ]\r\n\r\nThere is no better way to feel the power of Shakespeare than to read in\r\nsuccession three different types of plays, such as the comedy of _As You\r\nLike It_, the tragedy of _Macbeth_ and the historical play of\r\n_Julius Cæsar_. Another excellent trio is _The Merchant of\r\nVenice_, _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Henry IV_; and the reading of\r\nthese typical plays might well be concluded with _The Tempest_, which\r\nwas probably Shakespeare's last word to his Elizabethan audience.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF SHAKESPEARE. As the thousand details of a Gothic cathedral\r\nreceive character and meaning from its towering spire, so all the works of\r\nShakespeare are dominated by his imagination. That imagination of his was\r\nboth sympathetic and creative. It was sympathetic in that it understood\r\nwithout conscious effort all kinds of men, from clowns to kings, and all\r\nhuman emotions that lie between the extremes of joy and sorrow; it was\r\ncreative in that, from any given emotion or motive, it could form a human\r\ncharacter who should be completely governed by that motive. Ambition in\r\nMacbeth, pride in Coriolanus, wit in Mercutio, broad humor in Falstaff,\r\nindecision in Hamlet, pure fancy in Ariel, brutality in Richard, a\r\npassionate love in Juliet, a merry love in Rosalind, an ideal love in\r\nPerdita,--such characters reveal Shakespeare's power to create living men\r\nand women from a single motive or emotion.\r\n\r\nOr take a single play, _Othello_, and disregarding all minor\r\ncharacters, fix attention on the pure devotion of Desdemona, the jealousy\r\nof Othello, the villainy of Iago. The genius that in a single hour can make\r\nus understand these contrasting characters as if we had met them in the\r\nflesh, and make our hearts ache as we enter into their joy, their anguish,\r\ntheir dishonor, is beyond all ordinary standards of measurement. And\r\n_Othello_ must be multiplied many times before we reach the limit of\r\nShakespeare's creative imagination. He is like the genii of the _Arabian\r\nNights_, who produce new marvels while we wonder at the old.\r\n\r\nSuch an overpowering imagination must have created wildly, fancifully, had\r\nit not been guided by other qualities: by an observation almost as keen as\r\nthat of Chaucer, and by the saving grace of humor. We need only mention the\r\nlatter qualities, for if the reader will examine any great play of\r\nShakespeare, he will surely find them in evidence: the observation keeping\r\nthe characters of the poet's imagination true to the world of men and\r\nwomen, and the humor preventing some scene of terror or despair from\r\noverwhelming us by its terrible reality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS FAULTS]\r\n\r\nIn view of these and other qualities it has become almost a fashion to\r\nspeak of the \"perfection\" of Shakespeare's art; but in truth no word could\r\nbe more out of place in such a connection. As Ben Jonson wrote in his\r\n_Timber_:\r\n\r\n    \"I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to\r\n    Shakespeare that in his writing, whatever he penned, he never\r\n    blotted out a line. My answer hath been, 'Would he had blotted a\r\n    thousand.'\"\r\n\r\nEven in his best work Shakespeare has more faults than any other poet of\r\nEngland. He is in turn careless, extravagant, profuse, tedious,\r\nsensational; his wit grows stale or coarse; his patriotism turns to\r\nbombast; he mars even such pathetic scenes as the burial of Ophelia by\r\nbuffoonery and brawling; and all to please a public that was given to\r\nbull-baiting.\r\n\r\nThese certainly are imperfections; yet the astonishing thing is that they\r\npass almost unnoticed in Shakespeare. He reflected his age, the evil and\r\nthe good of it, just as it appeared to him; and the splendor of his\r\nrepresentation is such that even his faults have their proper place, like\r\nshadows in a sunlit landscape.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS VIEW OF LIFE]\r\n\r\nOf Shakespeare's philosophy we may say that it reflected equally well the\r\nviews of his hearers and of the hundred characters whom he created for\r\ntheir pleasure. Of his personal views it is impossible to say more than\r\nthis, with truth: that he seems to have been in full sympathy with the\r\nolder writers whose stories he used as the sources of his drama. [Footnote:\r\nThe chief sources of Shakespeare's plays are: (1) Older plays, from which\r\nhe made half of his dramas, such as _Richard III_, _Hamlet_,\r\n_King John_. (2) Holinshed's _Chronicles_, from which he obtained\r\nmaterial for his English historical plays. (3) Plutarch's _Lives_,\r\ntranslated by North, which furnished him material for _Caesar_,\r\n_Coriolanus_, _Antony and Cleopatra_. (4) French, Italian and\r\nSpanish romances, in translations, from which he obtained the stories of\r\n_The Merchant of Venice_, _Othello_, _Twelfth Night_ and\r\n_As You Like It_.] Now these stories commonly reflected three things\r\nbesides the main narrative: a problem, its solution, and the consequent\r\nmoral or lesson. The problem was a form of evil; its solution depended on\r\ngoodness in some form; the moral was that goodness triumphs finally and\r\ninevitably over evil.\r\n\r\nMany such stories were cherished by the Elizabethans, the old tale of\r\n\"Gammelyn\" for example (from which came _As You Like It_); and just as\r\nin our own day popular novels are dramatized, so three centuries ago\r\naudiences demanded to see familiar stories in vigorous action. That is why\r\nShakespeare held to the old tales, and pleased his audience, instead of\r\ninventing new plots. But however much he changed the characters or the\r\naction of the story, he remained always true to the old moral:\r\n\r\n  That goodness is the rule of life,\r\n  And its glory and its triumph.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's women are his finest characters, and he often portrays the\r\nlove of a noble woman as triumphing over the sin or weakness of men. He has\r\nlittle regard for abnormal or degenerate types, such as appear in the later\r\nElizabethan drama; he prefers vigorous men and pure women, precisely as the\r\nold story-tellers did; and if Richard or some other villain overruns his\r\nstage for an hour, such men are finally overwhelmed by the very evil which\r\nthey had planned for others. If they drag the innocent down to a common\r\ndestruction, these pure characters never seem to us to perish; they live\r\nforever in our thought as the true emblems of humanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAL EMPHASIS]\r\n\r\nIt was Charles Lamb who referred to a copy of Shakespeare's plays as \"this\r\nmanly book.\" The expression is a good one, and epitomizes the judgment of a\r\nworld which has found that, though Shakespeare introduces evil or vulgar\r\nelements into his plays, his emphasis is always upon the right man and the\r\nright action. This may seem a trite thing to say in praise of a great\r\ngenius; but when you reflect that Shakespeare is read throughout the\r\ncivilized world, the simple fact that the splendor of his poetry is\r\nbalanced by the rightness of his message becomes significant and\r\nimpressive. It speaks not only for Shakespeare but for the moral quality of\r\nthe multitudes who acknowledge his mastery. Wherever his plays are read, on\r\nland or sea, in the crowded cities of men or the far silent places of the\r\nearth, there the solitary man finds himself face to face with the\r\nunchanging ideals of his race, with honor, duty, courtesy, and the moral\r\nimperative,\r\n\r\n  This above all: to thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ELIZABETHAN DRAMA AFTER SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nThe drama began to decline during Shakespeare's lifetime. Even before his\r\nretirement to Stratford other popular dramatists appeared who catered to a\r\nvulgar taste by introducing more sensational elements into the stage\r\nspectacle. In consequence the drama degenerated so rapidly that in 1642,\r\nonly twenty-six years after the master dramatist had passed away,\r\nParliament closed the theaters as evil and degrading places. This closing\r\nis charged to the zeal of the Puritans, who were rapidly rising into power,\r\nand the charge is probably well founded. So also was the Puritan zeal. One\r\nwho was compelled to read the plays of the period, to say nothing of\r\nwitnessing them, must thank these stern old Roundheads for their insistence\r\non public decency and morality. In the drama of all ages there seems to be\r\na terrible fatality which turns the stage first to levity, then to\r\nwickedness, and which sooner or later calls for reformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS BEAUMONT]\r\n\r\nAmong those who played their parts in the rise and fall of the drama, the\r\nchief names are Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Middleton, Webster, Heywood,\r\nDekker, Massinger, Ford and Shirley. Concerning the work of these\r\ndramatists there is wide diversity of opinion. Lamb regards them, Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher especially, as \"an inferior sort of Sidneys and Shakespeares.\"\r\nLandor writes of them poetically:\r\n\r\n                              They stood around\r\n  The throne of Shakespeare, sturdy but unclean.\r\n\r\nLowell finds some small things to praise in a large collection of their\r\nplays. Hazlitt regards them as \"a race of giants, a common and noble brood,\r\nof whom Shakespeare was simply the tallest.\" Dyce, who had an extraordinary\r\nknowledge of all these dramatists, regards such praise as absurd, saying\r\nthat \"Shakespeare is not only immeasurably superior to the dramatists of\r\nhis time, but is utterly unlike them in almost every respect.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FLETCHER\r\nFrom the engraving by Philip Oudinet published 1811]\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to decide where such doctors disagree. It may not be\r\namiss, however, to record this personal opinion: that these playwrights\r\nadded little to the drama and still less to literature, and that it is\r\nhardly worth while to search out their good passages amid a welter of\r\nrepulsive details. If they are to be read at all, the student will find\r\nenough of their work for comparison with the Shakespearean drama in a book\r\nof selections, such as Lamb's _Specimens of English Dramatic Poetry_\r\nor Thayer's _The Best Elizabethan Plays_.\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON (1573?-1637). The greatest figure among these dramatists was\r\nJonson,--\"O rare Ben Jonson\" as his epitaph describes him, \"O rough Ben\r\nJonson\" as he was known to the playwrights with whom he waged literary\r\nwarfare. His first notable play, _Every Man in His Humour_, satirizing\r\nthe fads or humors of London, was acted by Shakespeare's company, and\r\nShakespeare played one of the parts. Then Jonson fell out with his fellow\r\nactors, and wrote _The Poetaster_ (acted by a rival company) to\r\nridicule them and their work. Shakespeare was silent, but the cudgels were\r\ntaken up by Marston and Dekker, the latter of whom wrote, among other and\r\nbetter plays, _Satiromastix_, which was played by Shakespeare's\r\ncompany as a counter attack on Jonson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEN JONSON]\r\n\r\nThe value of Jonson's plays is that they give us vivid pictures of\r\nElizabethan society, its speech, fashions, amusements, such as no other\r\ndramatist has drawn. Shakespeare pictures men and women as they might be in\r\nany age; but Jonson is content to picture the men and women of London as\r\nthey appeared superficially in the year 1600. His chief comedies, which\r\nsatirize the shams of his age, are: _Volpone, or the Fox_, a merciless\r\nexposure of greed and avarice; _The Alchemist_, a study of quackery as\r\nit was practiced in Elizabethan days; _Bartholomew Fair_, a riot of\r\nfolly; and _Epicoene, or the Silent Woman_, which would now be called\r\na roaring farce. His chief tragedies are _Sejanus_ and\r\n_Catiline_.\r\n\r\nIn later life Jonson was appointed poet laureate, and wrote many masques,\r\nsuch as the _Masque of Beauty_ and the unfinished _Sad Shepherd_.\r\nThese and a few lyrics, such as the \"Triumph of Charis\" and the song\r\nbeginning, \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\" are the pleasantest of\r\nJonson's works. At the end he abandoned the drama, as Shakespeare had done,\r\nand lashed it as severely as any Puritan in the ode beginning, \"Come leave\r\nthe loathëd stage.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PROSE WRITERS\r\n\r\nUnless one have antiquarian tastes, there is little in Elizabethan prose to\r\nreward the reader. Strange to say, the most tedious part of it was written\r\nby literary men in what was supposed to be a very fine style; while the\r\nsmall part that still attracts us (such as Bacon's _Essays_ or\r\nHakluyt's _Voyages_) was mostly written by practical men with no\r\nthought for literary effect.\r\n\r\nThis curious result came about in the following way. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury poetry was old, but English prose was new; for in the two centuries\r\nthat had elapsed since Mandeville wrote his _Travels_, Malory's\r\n_Morte d' Arthur_ (1475) and Ascham's _Scholemaster_ (1563) are\r\nabout the only two books that can be said to have a prose style. Then, just\r\nas the Elizabethans were turning to literature, John Lyly appeared with his\r\n_Euphues, or the Anatomy of Wit_ (1578), an alleged novel made up of\r\nrambling conversations upon love, education, fashion,--everything that came\r\ninto the author's head. The style was involved, artificial, tortured; it\r\nwas loaded with conceits, antitheses and decorations:\r\n\r\n    \"I perceive, Camilla, that be your cloth never so bad it will take\r\n    some colour, and your cause never so false it will bear some show\r\n    of probability; wherein you manifest the right nature of a woman,\r\n    who, having no way to win, thinketh to overcome with words.... Take\r\n    heed, Camilla, that seeking all the wood for a straight stick you\r\n    choose not at the last a crooked staff, or prescribing a good\r\n    counsel to others thou thyself follow the worst much like to Chius,\r\n    who selling the best wine to others drank himself of the lees.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FAD OF EUPHUISM]\r\n\r\nThis \"high fantastical\" style, ever since called euphuistic, created a\r\nsensation. The age was given over to extravagance and the artificial\r\nelegance of _Euphues_ seemed to match the other fashions. Just as\r\nElizabethan men and women began to wear grotesque ruffs about their necks\r\nas soon as they learned the art of starching from the Dutch, so now they\r\nbegan to decorate their writing with the conceits of Lyly. [Footnote: Lyly\r\ndid not invent the fashion; he carried to an extreme a tendency towards\r\nartificial writing which was prevalent in England and on the Continent. As\r\nis often the case, it was the extreme of fashion that became fashionable.]\r\nOnly a year after _Euphues_ appeared, Spenser published _The\r\nShepherd's Calendar_, and his prose notes show how quickly the style,\r\nlike a bad habit, had taken possession of the literary world. Shakespeare\r\nridicules the fashion in the character of Holofernes, in _Love's Labor's\r\nLost_, yet he follows it as slavishly as the rest. He could write good\r\nprose when he would, as is shown by a part of Hamlet's speech; but as a\r\nrule he makes his characters speak as if the art of prose were like walking\r\na tight rope, which must be done with a balancing pole and some\r\ncontortions. The scholars who produced the translation of the Scriptures\r\nknown as the Authorized Version could certainly write well; yet if you\r\nexamine their Dedication, in which, uninfluenced by the noble sincerity of\r\nthe Bible's style, they were free to follow the fashion, you may find there\r\nthe two faults of Elizabethan prose; namely, the habit of servile flattery\r\nand the sham of euphuism.\r\n\r\nAmong prose writers of the period the name that appears most frequently is\r\nthat of Philip Sidney (1554-1586). He wrote one of our first critical\r\nessays, _An Apologie for Poetrie_ (cir. 1581), the spirit of which may\r\nbe judged from the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Nowe therein of all sciences ... is our poet the monarch. For he\r\n    dooth not only show the way but giveth so sweete a prospect into\r\n    the way as will intice any man to enter into it. Nay, he dooth, as\r\n    if your journey should be through a faire vineyard, at the first\r\n    give you a  cluster of grapes, that, full of that taste, you may\r\n    long to passe further. He beginneth not with obscure definitions,\r\n    which must blur the margent with interpretations, and load the\r\n    memory with doubtfulnesse; but hee cometh to you with words set in\r\n    delightfull proportion, either accompanied with or prepared for the\r\n    well enchaunting skill of musicke; and with a tale, forsooth, he\r\n    cometh unto you,--with a tale which holdeth children from play and\r\n    old men from the chimney corner.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR PHILIP SIDNEY]\r\n\r\nSidney wrote also the pastoral romance _Arcadia_ which was famous in\r\nits day, and in which the curious reader may find an occasional good\r\npassage, such as the prayer to a heathen god, \"O All-seeing Light,\"--a\r\nprayer that became historic and deeply pathetic when King Charles repeated\r\nit, facing death on the scaffold. That was in 1649, more than half a\r\ncentury after _Arcadia_ was written:\r\n\r\n    \"O all-seeing Light, and eternal Life of all things, to whom\r\n    nothing is either so great that it may resist or so small that it\r\n    is contemned, look upon my miserie with thine eye of mercie, and\r\n    let thine infinite power vouchsafe to limite out some proportion of\r\n    deliverance unto me, as to thee shall seem most convenient. Let not\r\n    injurie, O Lord, triumphe over me, and let my faults by thy hands\r\n    be corrected, and make not mine unjuste enemie the minister of thy\r\n    justice. But yet, my God, if in thy wisdome this be the aptest\r\n    chastisement for my inexcusable follie; if this low bondage be\r\n    fittest for my over-hie desires; if the pride of my not-inough\r\n    humble hearte be thus to be broken, O Lord, I yeeld unto thy will,\r\n    and joyfully embrace what sorrow thou wilt have me suffer.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KING JAMES BIBLE]\r\n\r\nThe finest example of the prose of the period is the King James or\r\nAuthorized Version of the Bible, which appeared in 1611. This translation\r\nwas so much influenced by the earlier work of Wyclif, Tyndale, and many\r\nothers, that its style cannot properly be called Elizabethan or Jacobean;\r\nit is rather an epitome of English at its best in the two centuries between\r\nChaucer and Shakespeare. The forty-seven scholars who prepared this\r\ntranslation aimed at a faithful rendering of the Book which, aside from its\r\nspiritual teaching, contains some of the noblest examples of style in the\r\nwhole range of human literature: the elemental simplicity of the Books of\r\nMoses, the glowing poetry of Job and the Psalms, the sublime imagery of\r\nIsaiah, the exquisite tenderness of the Parables, the forged and tempered\r\nargument of the Epistles, the gorgeous coloring of the Apocalypse. All\r\nthese elements entered in some degree into the translation of 1611, and the\r\nresult was a work of such beauty, strength and simplicity that it remained\r\na standard of English prose for more than three centuries. It has not only\r\nbeen a model for our best writers; it has pervaded all the minor literature\r\nof the nation, and profoundly influenced the thought and the expression of\r\nthe whole English-speaking world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BACON (1561-1626)\r\n\r\n\"My name and memory I leave to foreign nations, and to mine own country\r\n_after some time is passed over_,\" said Bacon in his will. That\r\nreference to the future meant, not that England might learn to forget and\r\nforgive (for Bacon was not greatly troubled by his disgrace), but that she\r\nmight learn to appreciate his _Instauratio Magna_. In the same\r\ndocument the philosopher left magnificent bequests for various purposes,\r\nbut when these were claimed by the beneficiaries it was learned that the\r\ndebts of the estate were three times the assets. This high-sounding will is\r\nan epitome of Bacon's life and work.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Bacon belongs with Sidney and Raleigh in that group of\r\n    Elizabethans who aimed to be men of affairs, politicians,\r\n    reformers, explorers, rather than writers of prose or poetry. He\r\n    was of noble birth, and from an early age was attached to\r\n    Elizabeth's court. There he expected rapid advancement, but the\r\n    queen and his uncle (Lord Burghley) were both a little suspicious\r\n    of the young man who, as he said, had \"taken all knowledge for his\r\n    province.\"\r\n\r\n    Failing to advance by favor, Bacon studied law and entered\r\n    Parliament, where he rose rapidly to leadership. Ben Jonson writes\r\n    of him, in that not very reliable collection of opinions called\r\n    _Timber_:\r\n\r\n        \"There happened in my time one noble speaker who was full\r\n        of gravity in his speaking.... No man ever spake more\r\n        neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less\r\n        emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered.... The fear\r\n        of every man that heard him was lest he should make an\r\n        end.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FRANCIS BACON]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS TRIUMPH]\r\n\r\n    When Elizabeth died, Bacon saw his way open. He offered his\r\n    services to the royal favorite, Buckingham, and was soon in the\r\n    good graces of King James. He was made Baron Verulam and Viscount\r\n    St. Albans; he married a rich wife; he rose rapidly from one\r\n    political honor to another, until at sixty he was Lord High\r\n    Chancellor of England. So his threefold ambition for position,\r\n    wealth and power was realized. It was while he held the highest\r\n    state office that he published his _Novum Organum_, which\r\n    established his reputation as \"the first philosopher in Europe.\"\r\n    That was in 1620, the year when a handful of Pilgrims sailed away\r\n    unnoticed on one of the world's momentous voyages.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS DISGRACE]\r\n\r\n    After four years of power Bacon, who had been engaged with\r\n    Buckingham in selling monopolies, and in other schemes to be rich\r\n    at the public expense, was brought to task by Parliament. He was\r\n    accused of receiving bribes, confessed his guilt (it is said to\r\n    shield the king and Buckingham, who had shared the booty), was\r\n    fined, imprisoned, banished from court, and forbidden to hold\r\n    public office again. All these punishments except the last were\r\n    remitted by King James, to whom Bacon had been a useful tool. His\r\n    last few years were spent in scientific study at Gorhambury, where\r\n    he lived proudly, keeping up the appearance of his former grandeur,\r\n    until his death in 1626.\r\n\r\n    Such a sketch seems a cold thing, but there is little of divine\r\n    fire or human warmth in Bacon to kindle one's enthusiasm. His\r\n    obituary might well be the final word of his essay \"Of Wisdom for a\r\n    Man's Self\":\r\n\r\n        \"Whereas they have all their time sacrificed to themselves,\r\n        they become in the end sacrifices to the inconstancy of\r\n        fortune, whose wings they thought by their self-wisdom to\r\n        have pinioned.\"\r\n\r\n    Ben Jonson had a different and, possibly, a more just opinion. In\r\n    the work from which we have quoted he says:\r\n\r\n        \"My conceit of his person was never increased towards him\r\n        by his place or honours; but I have and do reverence him\r\n        for his greatness that was only proper to himself, in that\r\n        he seemed to me ever by his work one of the greatest men,\r\n        and most worthy of admiration, that had been in many ages.\r\n        In his adversity I ever prayed that God would give him\r\n        strength; for greatness he could not want.\"\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BACON. The _Essays_ of Bacon are so highly esteemed that the\r\ncritic Hallam declares it would be \"derogatory to a man of the slightest\r\nclaim to polite letters\" to be unacquainted with them. His first venture\r\nwas a tiny volume called _Essays, Religious Meditations, Places of\r\nPersuasion and Dissuasion_ (1597). This was modeled upon a French work\r\nby Montaigne (_Essais_, 1580) and was considered of small consequence\r\nby the author. As time went on, and his ambitious works were overlooked in\r\nfavor of his sketches, he paid more attention to the latter, revising and\r\nenlarging his work until the final edition of fifty-eight essays appeared\r\nin 1625. Then it was that Bacon wrote, \"I do now publish my Essays, which\r\nof all my works have been most current; for that, as it seems, they come\r\nhome to men's business and bosoms.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF THE ESSAYS]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of these works may be judged by the essay \"Of Friendship.\" This\r\npromises well, for near the beginning we read, \"A crowd is not company, and\r\nfaces are but a gallery of pictures, and talking is but a tinkling cymbal\r\nwhere there is no love.\" Excellent! As we read on, however, we find nothing\r\nof the love that beareth all things for a friend's sake. We are not even\r\nencouraged to be friendly, but rather to cultivate the friendship of other\r\nmen for the following advantages: that a friend is useful in saving us from\r\nsolitude; that he may increase our joy or diminish our trouble; that he\r\ngives us good counsel; that he can finish our work or take care of our\r\nchildren, if need be; and finally, that he can spare our modesty while\r\ntrumpeting our virtues:\r\n\r\n    \"How many things are there which a man cannot, with any face or\r\n    comeliness, say or do himself! A man can scarce allege his own\r\n    merits with modesty, much less extol them; a man cannot sometimes\r\n    brook to supplicate or beg; and a number of the like. But all these\r\n    things are graceful in a friend's mouth, which are blushing in a\r\n    man's own.\"\r\n\r\nIn old Arabic manuscripts one frequently finds a record having the\r\nappearance of truth; but at the very end, in parenthesis, one reads, \"This\r\nis all a lie,\" or \"This was my thought when I was sick,\" or some other\r\nenlightening climax. Bacon's essay \"Of Friendship\" might be more in accord\r\nwith the verities if it had a final note to the effect that the man who\r\ncultivates friendship in the Baconian way will never have or deserve a\r\nfriend in the world.\r\n\r\nSo with many other Baconian essays: with \"Love\" for example, in which we\r\nare told that it is impossible for a man to love and be wise; or with\r\n\"Negotiations,\" which informs us that, unless a man intends to use his\r\nletter to justify himself (lo! the politician), it is better to deal by\r\nspeech than by writing; for a man can \"disavow or expound\" his speech, but\r\nhis written word may be used against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BACON'S VIEW OF LIFE]\r\n\r\nTo some men, to most men, life offers a problem to be solved by standards\r\nthat are eternally right; to others life is a game, the object is to win,\r\nand the rules may be manipulated to one's own advantage. Bacon's moral\r\nphilosophy was that of the gamester; his leading motive was self-interest;\r\nso when he wrote of love or friendship or any other noble sentiment he was\r\ndealing with matters of which he had no knowledge. The best he could offer\r\nwas a \"counsel of prudence,\" and many will sympathize with John Wesley, who\r\ndeclared that worldly prudence is a quality from which an honest man should\r\npray God to be delivered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHAT TO READ]\r\n\r\nIt is only when Bacon deals with practical matters, leaving the high places\r\nof life, where he is a stranger, to write of \"Discourse\" or \"Gardens\" or\r\n\"Seeming Wise\" that his essays begin to strike home by their vigor and\r\nvitality. Though seldom profound or sympathetic, they are notable for their\r\nkeen observation and shrewd judgment of the ambitious world in which the\r\nauthor himself lived. Among those that are best worth reading are\r\n\"Studies,\" \"Wisdom for a Man's Self,\" \"Riches,\" \"Great Place,\" \"Atheism,\"\r\nand \"Travel.\"\r\n\r\nThe style of these essays is in refreshing contrast to most Elizabethan\r\nprose, to the sonorous periods of Hooker, to the ramblings of Sidney, to\r\nthe conceits of Lyly and Shakespeare. The sentences are mostly short,\r\nclear, simple; and so much meaning is crystallized in them that they\r\novershadow even the \"Poor Richard\" maxims of Franklin, the man who had a\r\ngenius for packing worldly wisdom into a convenient nutshell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMBITIOUS WORKS]\r\n\r\nOther works of Bacon are seldom read, and may be passed over lightly. We\r\nmention only, as indicative of his wide range, his _History of Henry\r\nVII_, his Utopian romance _The New Atlantis_, his Advancement of\r\nLearning and his _Novum Organum_. The last two works, one in English,\r\nthe other in Latin, were parts of the _Instauratio Magna_, or _The\r\nGreat Institution of True Philosophy_, a colossal work which Bacon did\r\nnot finish, which he never even outlined very clearly.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the _Instauratio_ was, first, to sweep away ancient\r\nphilosophy and the classic education of the universities; and second, to\r\nsubstitute a scheme of scientific study to the end of discovering and\r\nutilizing the powers of nature. It gave Bacon his reputation (in Germany\r\nespecially) of a great philosopher and scientist, and it is true that his\r\nvision of vast discoveries has influenced the thought of the world; but to\r\nread any part of his great work is to meet a mind that seems ingenious\r\nrather than philosophical, and fanciful rather than scientific. He had what\r\nhis learned contemporary Peter Heylyn termed \"a chymical brain,\" a brain\r\nthat was forever busy with new theories; and the leading theory was that\r\nsome lucky man would discover a key or philosopher's stone or magic\r\n_sesame_ that must straightway unlock all the secrets of nature.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the real scientists of his age were discovering secrets in the\r\nonly sure way, of hard, self-denying work. Gilbert was studying magnetism,\r\nHarvey discovering the circulation of the blood, Kepler determining the\r\nlaws that govern the planets' motions, Napier inventing logarithms, and\r\nGalileo standing in ecstasy beneath the first telescope ever pointed at the\r\nstars of heaven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS VAST PLANS]\r\n\r\nOf the work of these scientific heroes Bacon had little knowledge, and for\r\ntheir plodding methods he had no sympathy. He was Viscount, Lord\r\nChancellor, \"high-browed Verulam,\" and his heaven-scaling\r\n_Instauratio_ which, as he said, was \"for the glory of the Creator and\r\nfor the relief of man's estate\" must have something stupendous,\r\nElizabethan, about it, like the victory over the Armada. In his plans there\r\nwas always an impression of vastness; his miscellaneous works were like the\r\nstrange maps that geographers made when the wonders of a new world opened\r\nupon their vision. Though he never made an important discovery, his\r\nconviction that knowledge is power and that there are no metes or bounds to\r\nknowledge, his belief that the mighty forces of nature are waiting to do\r\nman's bidding, his thought of ships that navigate the air as easily as the\r\nsea,--all this Baconian dream of mental empire inspired the scientific\r\nworld for three centuries. It was as thoroughly Elizabethan in its way as\r\nthe voyage of Drake or the plays of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The most remarkable feature of the Elizabethan age was its\r\n    patriotic enthusiasm. This enthusiasm found its best expression on\r\n    the stage, in the portrayal of life in vigorous action; and dramas\r\n    were produced in such number and of such quality that the whole\r\n    period is sometimes called the age of the play. It was a time of\r\n    poetry rather than of prose, and nearly all of the poetry is\r\n    characterized by its emotional quality, by youthful freshness of\r\n    feeling, by quickened imagination, and by an extravagance of\r\n    language which overflows, even in Shakespeare, in a kind of\r\n    glorious bombast.\r\n\r\n    Our study of the literature of the age includes: (1) The outburst\r\n    of lyric poetry. (2) The life and works of Spenser, second in time\r\n    of the great English poets. (3) A review of the long history of the\r\n    drama, from the earliest church spectacle, through miracle,\r\n    morality, interlude, pageant and masque to the Elizabethan drama.\r\n    (4) The immediate forerunners of Shakespeare, of whom the most\r\n    notable was Marlowe. (5) The life and work of Shakespeare. (6) Ben\r\n    Jonson, the successors of Shakespeare, and the rapid decline of the\r\n    drama. (7) Elizabethan prose; the appearance of euphuism; Sidney's\r\n    _Apologie for Poetrie_; the Authorized Version of the\r\n    Scriptures; and the life and work of Francis Bacon.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

We are selfish men;\r\n    Oh! raise us up, return to us again,\r\n  And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.\r\n\r\n                   Wordsworth, \"Sonnet on Milton\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    HISTORICAL OUTLINE. The period from the accession of Charles I in\r\n    1625 to the Revolution of 1688 was filled with a mighty struggle\r\n    over the question whether king or Commons should be supreme in\r\n    England. On this question the English people were divided into two\r\n    main parties. On one side were the Royalists, or Cavaliers, who\r\n    upheld the monarch with his theory of the divine right of kings; on\r\n    the other were the Puritans, or Independents, who stood for the\r\n    rights of the individual man and for the liberties of Parliament\r\n    and people. The latter party was at first very small; it had\r\n    appeared in the days of Langland and Wyclif, and had been\r\n    persecuted by Elizabeth; but persecution served only to increase\r\n    its numbers and determination. Though the Puritans were never a\r\n    majority in England, they soon ruled the land with a firmness it\r\n    had not known since the days of William the Conqueror. They were\r\n    primarily men of conscience, and no institution can stand before\r\n    strong men whose conscience says the institution is wrong. That is\r\n    why the degenerate theaters were not reformed but abolished; that\r\n    is why the theory of the divine right of kings was shattered as by\r\n    a thunderbolt when King Charles was sent to the block for treason\r\n    against his country.\r\n\r\n    The struggle reached a climax in the Civil War of 1642, which ended\r\n    in a Puritan victory. As a result of that war, England was for a\r\n    brief period a commonwealth, disciplined at home and respected\r\n    abroad, through the genius and vigor and tyranny of Oliver\r\n    Cromwell. When Cromwell died (1658) there was no man in England\r\n    strong enough to take his place, and two years later \"Prince\r\n    Charlie,\" who had long been an exile, was recalled to the throne as\r\n    Charles II of England. He had learned nothing from his father's\r\n    fate or his own experience, and proceeded by all evil ways to\r\n    warrant this \"Epitaph,\" which his favorite, Wilmot, Earl of\r\n    Rochester, pinned on the door of his bedchamber:\r\n\r\n      Here lies our Sovereign Lord the King,\r\n        Whose word no man relies on,\r\n      Who never said a foolish thing,\r\n        Nor ever did a wise one.\r\n\r\n    The next twenty years are of such disgrace and national weakness\r\n    that the historian hesitates to write about them. It was called the\r\n    period of the Restoration, which meant, in effect, the restoration\r\n    of all that was objectionable in monarchy. Another crisis came in\r\n    the Revolution of 1688, when the country, aroused by the attempt of\r\n    James II to establish another despotism in Church and state,\r\n    invited Prince William of Orange (husband of the king's daughter\r\n    Mary) to the English throne. That revolution meant three things:\r\n    the supremacy of Parliament, the beginning of modern England, and\r\n    the final triumph of the principle of political liberty for which\r\n    the Puritan had fought and suffered hardship for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nTYPICAL WRITERS. Among the writers of the period three men stand out\r\nprominently, and such was the confusion of the times that in the whole\r\nrange of our literature it would be difficult to find three others who\r\ndiffer more widely in spirit or method. Milton represents the scholarship,\r\nthe culture of the Renaissance, combined with the moral earnestness of the\r\nPuritan. Bunyan, a poor tinker and lay preacher, reflects the tremendous\r\nspiritual ferment among the common people. And Dryden, the cool,\r\ncalculating author who made a business of writing, regards the Renaissance\r\nand Puritanism as both things of the past. He lives in the present, aims to\r\ngive readers what they like, follows the French critics of the period who\r\nadvocate writing by rule, and popularizes that cold, formal, precise style\r\nwhich, under the assumed name of classicism, is to dominate English poetry\r\nduring the following century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN MILTON (1608-1674)\r\n\r\n  Yet some there be that by due steps aspire\r\n  To lay their just hands on that golden key\r\n  That opes the palace of eternity:\r\n  To such my errand is.\r\n\r\nIn these words of the Attendant Spirit in _Comus_ we seem to hear\r\nMilton speaking to his readers. To such as regard poetry as the means of an\r\nhour's pleasant recreation he brings no message; his \"errand\" is to those\r\nwho, like Sidney, regard poetry as the handmaiden of virtue, or, like\r\nAristotle, as the highest form of human history.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Milton was born in London (1608) at a time when Shakespeare\r\n    and his fellow dramatists were in their glory. He grew up in a home\r\n    where the delights of poetry and music were added to the moral\r\n    discipline of the Puritan. Before he was twelve years old he had\r\n    formed the habit of studying far into the night; and his field\r\n    included not only Greek, Latin, Hebrew and modern European\r\n    literatures, but mathematics also, and science and theology and\r\n    music. His parents had devoted him in infancy to noble ends, and he\r\n    joyously accepted their dedication, saying, \"He who would not be\r\n    frustrate of his hope to write well ... ought himself to be a true\r\n    poem, that is, a composition and pattern of the best and\r\n    honorablest things.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: MILTON AT HORTON]\r\n\r\n    From St. Paul's school Milton went to Christ's College, Cambridge,\r\n    took his master's degree, wrote a few poems in Latin, Italian and\r\n    English, and formed a plan for a great epic, \"a poem that England\r\n    would not willingly let die.\" Then he retired to his father's\r\n    country-place at Horton, and for six years gave himself up to\r\n    music, to untutored study, and to that formal pleasure in nature\r\n    which is reflected in his work. Five short poems were the only\r\n    literary result of this retirement, but these were the most perfect\r\n    of their kind that England had thus far produced.\r\n\r\n    Milton's next step, intended like all others to cultivate his\r\n    talent, took him to the Continent. For fifteen months he traveled\r\n    through France and Italy, and was about to visit Greece when,\r\n    hearing of the struggle between king and Parliament, he set his\r\n    face towards England again. \"For I thought it base,\" he said, \"to\r\n    be traveling at my ease for culture when my countrymen at home were\r\n    fighting for liberty.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HOME LIFE]\r\n\r\n    To find himself, or to find the service to which he could devote\r\n    his great learning, seems to have been Milton's object after his\r\n    return to London (1639). While he waited he began to educate his\r\n    nephews, and enlarged this work until he had a small private\r\n    school, in which he tested some of the theories that appeared later\r\n    in his _Tractate on Education_. Also he married, in haste it\r\n    seems, and with deplorable consequences. His wife, Mary Powell, the\r\n    daughter of a Cavalier, was a pleasure-loving young woman, and\r\n    after a brief experience of Puritan discipline she wearied of it\r\n    and went home. She has been amply criticized for her desertion, but\r\n    Milton's house must have been rather chilly for any ordinary human\r\n    being to find comfort in. To him woman seemed to have been made for\r\n    obedience, and man for rebellion; his toplofty doctrine of\r\n    masculine superiority found expression in a line regarding Adam and\r\n    Eve, \"He for God only, she for God in him,\"--an old delusion, which\r\n    had been seriously disturbed by the first woman.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN MILTON]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PERIOD OF CONTROVERSY]\r\n\r\n    For a period of near twenty years Milton wrote but little poetry,\r\n    his time being occupied with controversies that were then waged\r\n    even more fiercely in the press than in the field. It was after the\r\n    execution of King Charles (1649), when England was stunned and all\r\n    Europe aghast at the Puritans' daring, that he published his\r\n    _Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_, the argument of which was,\r\n    that magistrates and people are equally subject to the law, and\r\n    that the divine right of kings to rule is as nothing beside the\r\n    divine right of the people to defend their liberties. That argument\r\n    established Milton's position as the literary champion of\r\n    democracy. He was chosen Secretary of the Commonwealth, his duties\r\n    being to prepare the Latin correspondence with foreign countries,\r\n    and to confound all arguments of the Royalists. During the next\r\n    decade Milton's pen and Cromwell's sword were the two outward\r\n    bulwarks of Puritanism, and one was quite as ready and almost as\r\n    potent as the other.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS BLINDNESS]\r\n\r\n    It was while Milton was thus occupied that he lost his eyesight,\r\n    \"his last sacrifice on the altar of English liberty.\" His famous\r\n    \"Sonnet on his Blindness\" is a lament not for his lost sight but\r\n    for his lost talent; for while serving the Commonwealth he must\r\n    abandon the dream of a great poem that he had cherished all his\r\n    life:\r\n\r\n      When I consider how my light is spent\r\n      Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,\r\n      And that one talent, which is death to hide,\r\n      Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent\r\n      To serve therewith my Maker, and present\r\n      My true account, lest he returning chide;\r\n      \"Doth God exact day labour, light denied?\"\r\n      I fondly ask; but Patience, to prevent\r\n      That murmur, soon replies, \"God doth not need\r\n      Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best\r\n      Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state\r\n      Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,\r\n      And post o'er land and ocean without rest;\r\n      They also serve who only stand and wait.\"\r\n\r\n    With the Restoration (1660) came disaster to the blind Puritan\r\n    poet, who had written too harshly against Charles I to be forgiven\r\n    by Charles II. He was forced to hide; his property was confiscated;\r\n    his works were burned in public by the hangman; had not his fame as\r\n    a writer raised up powerful friends, he would have gone to the\r\n    scaffold when Cromwell's bones were taken from the grave and hanged\r\n    in impotent revenge. He was finally allowed to settle in a modest\r\n    house, and to be in peace so long as he remained in obscurity. So\r\n    the pen was silenced that had long been a scourge to the enemies of\r\n    England.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS LONELINESS]\r\n\r\n    His home life for the remainder of his years impresses us by its\r\n    loneliness and grandeur. He who had delighted as a poet in the\r\n    English country, and more delighted as a Puritan in the fierce\r\n    struggle for liberty, was now confined to a small house, going from\r\n    study to porch, and finding both in equal darkness. He who had\r\n    roamed as a master through the wide fields of literature was now\r\n    dependent on a chance reader. His soul also was afflicted by the\r\n    apparent loss of all that Puritanism had so hardly won, by the\r\n    degradation of his country, by family troubles; for his daughters\r\n    often rebelled at the task of taking his dictation, and left him\r\n    helpless. Saddest of all, there was no love in the house, for with\r\n    all his genius Milton could not inspire affection in his own\r\n    people; nor does he ever reach the heart of his readers.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS MASTERPIECE]\r\n\r\n    In the midst of such scenes, denied the pleasure of hope, Milton\r\n    seems to have lived largely in his memories. He took up his early\r\n    dream of an immortal epic, lived with it seven years in seclusion,\r\n    and the result was _Paradise Lost_. This epic is generally\r\n    considered the finest fruit of Milton's genius, but there are two\r\n    other poems that have a more personal and human significance. In\r\n    the morning of his life he had written _Comus_, and the poem\r\n    is a reflection of a noble youth whose way lies open and smiling\r\n    before him. Almost forty years later, or just before his death in\r\n    1674, he wrote _Samson Agonistes_, and in this tragedy of a\r\n    blind giant, bound, captive, but unconquerable, we have a picture\r\n    of the agony and moral grandeur of the poet who takes leave of\r\n    life:\r\n\r\n      I feel my genial spirits droop, ...\r\n      My race of glory run, and race of shame;\r\n      And I shall shortly be with them that rest. [1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote [1]: From Milton's _Samson_. For the comparison we\r\n    are indebted to Henry Reed, _Lectures on English Literature_\r\n    (1863), p. 223.]\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: COTTAGE AT CHALFONT, ST. GILES, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE\r\n      Where Milton lived during the Plague, and where _Paradise Lost_ was\r\n      written]\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY POEMS. Milton's first notable poem, written in college days, was\r\nthe \"Ode on the Morning of Christ's Nativity,\" a chant of victory and\r\npraise such as Pindar might have written had he known the meaning of\r\nChristmas. In this boyish work one may find the dominant characteristic of\r\nall Milton's poetry; namely, a blending of learning with piety, a devotion\r\nof all the treasures of classic culture to the service of religion.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest of the Horton poems (so-called because they were written\r\nin the country-place of that name) are \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso,\" two\r\nof the most widely quoted works in our literature. They should be read in\r\norder to understand what people have admired for nearly three hundred\r\nyears, if not for their own beauty. \"L'Allegro\" (from the Italian, meaning\r\n\"the cheerful man\") is the poetic expression of a happy state of mind, and\r\n\"Il Penseroso\" [Footnote: The name is generally translated into\r\n\"melancholy,\" but the latter term is now commonly associated with sorrow or\r\ndisease. To Milton \"melancholy\" meant \"pensiveness.\" In writing \"Il\r\nPenseroso\" he was probably influenced by a famous book, Burton's _Anatomy\r\nof Melancholy_, which appeared in 1621 and was very widely read.] of a\r\nquiet, thoughtful mood that verges upon sadness, like the mood that follows\r\ngood music. Both poems are largely inspired by nature, and seem to have\r\nbeen composed out of doors, one in the morning and the other in the evening\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MASQUE OF COMUS]\r\n\r\n_Comus_ (1634), another of the Horton poems, is to many readers the\r\nmost interesting of Milton's works. In form it is a masque, that is, a\r\ndramatic poem intended to be staged to the accompaniment of music; in\r\nexecution it is the most perfect of all such poems inspired by the\r\nElizabethan love of pageants. We may regard it, therefore, as a late echo\r\nof the Elizabethan drama, which, like many another echo, is sweeter though\r\nfainter than the original. It was performed at Ludlow Castle, before the\r\nEarl of Bridgewater, and was suggested by an accident to the Earl's\r\nchildren, a simple accident, in which Milton saw the possibility of\r\n\"turning the common dust of opportunity to gold.\"\r\n\r\n    The story is that of a girl who becomes separated from her brothers\r\n    in a wood, and is soon lost. The magician Comus [Footnote: In\r\n    mythology Comus, the god of revelry, was represented as the son of\r\n    Dionysus (Bacchus, god of wine), and the witch Circe. In Greek\r\n    poetry Comus is the leader of any gay band of satyrs or dancers.\r\n    Milton's masque of _Comus_ was influenced by a similar story\r\n    in Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_, by Spenser's \"Palace of\r\n    Pleasure\" in _The Faery Queen_ (see above \"Sir Guyon\" in\r\n    Chapter IV), and by Homer's story of the witch Circe in the\r\n    _Odyssey_.] appears with his band of revelers, and tries to\r\n    bewitch the girl, to make her like one of his own brutish\r\n    followers. She is protected by her own purity, is watched over by\r\n    the Attendant Spirit, and finally rescued by her brothers. The\r\n    story is somewhat like that of the old ballad of \"The Children in\r\n    the Wood,\" but it is here transformed into a kind of morality play.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMUS AND THE TEMPEST]\r\n\r\nIn this masque may everywhere be seen the influence of Milton's\r\npredecessors and the stamp of his own independence; his Puritan spirit\r\nalso, which must add a moral to the old pagan tales. Thus, Miranda\r\nwandering about the enchanted isle (in Shakespeare's _The Tempest_)\r\nhears strange, harmonious echoes, to which Caliban gives expression:\r\n\r\n                             The isle is full of noises,\r\n  Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.\r\n  Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments\r\n  Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices,\r\n  That, if I then had waked after long sleep,\r\n  Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,\r\n  The clouds methought would open and show riches\r\n  Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked\r\n  I cried to dream again.\r\n\r\nThe bewildered girl in _Comus_ also hears mysterious voices, and has\r\nglimpses of a world not her own; but, like Sir Guyon of _The Faery\r\nQueen_, she is on moral guard against all such deceptions:\r\n\r\n            A thousand phantasies\r\n  Begin to throng into my memory,\r\n  Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,\r\n  And airy tongues that syllable men's names\r\n  On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.\r\n  These thoughts may startle well but not astound\r\n  The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended\r\n  By a strong-siding champion, Conscience.\r\n\r\nAgain, in _The Tempest_ we meet \"the frisky spirit\" Ariel, who sings\r\nof his coming freedom from Prospero's service:\r\n\r\n  Where the bee sucks, there suck I;\r\n  In a cowslip's bell I lie;\r\n  There I couch when owls do cry.\r\n  On a bat's back I do fly\r\n  After summer merrily:\r\n  Merrily, merrily shall I live now\r\n  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUDLOW CASTLE]\r\n\r\nThe Attendant Spirit in _Comus_ has something of Ariel's gayety, but\r\nhis joy is deeper-seated; he serves not the magician Prospero but the\r\nAlmighty, and comes gladly to earth in fulfilment of the divine promise,\r\n\"He shall give His angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.\"\r\nWhen his work is done he vanishes, like Ariel, but with a song which shows\r\nthe difference between the Elizabethan, or Renaissance, conception of\r\nsensuous beauty (that is, beauty which appeals to the physical senses) and\r\nthe Puritan's idea of moral beauty, which appeals to the soul:\r\n\r\n  Now my task is smoothly done,\r\n  I can fly or I can run\r\n  Quickly to the green earth's end,\r\n  Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,\r\n  And from thence can soar as soon\r\n  To the corners of the moon.\r\n  Mortals, that would follow me,\r\n  Love Virtue; she alone is free:\r\n  She can teach ye how to climb\r\n  Higher than the sphery chime;\r\n  Or if Virtue feeble were,\r\n  Heaven itself would stoop to her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LYCIDAS]\r\n\r\n_Lycidas_ (1637), last of the Horton poems, is an elegy occasioned by\r\nthe death of one who had been Milton's fellow student at Cambridge. It was\r\nan old college custom to celebrate important events by publishing a\r\ncollection of Latin or English poems, and _Lycidas_ may be regarded as\r\nMilton's wreath, which he offered to the memory of his classmate and to his\r\nuniversity. The poem is beautifully fashioned, and is greatly admired for\r\nits classic form; but it is cold as any monument, without a touch of human\r\ngrief or sympathy. Probably few modern readers will care for it as they\r\ncare for Tennyson's _In Memoriam_, a less perfect elegy, but one into\r\nwhich love enters as well as art. Other notable English elegies are the\r\n_Thyrsis_ of Matthew Arnold and the _Adonais_ of Shelley.\r\n\r\nMILTON'S LEFT HAND. This expression was used by Milton to designate certain\r\nprose works written in the middle period of his life, at a time of turmoil\r\nand danger. These works have magnificent passages which show the power and\r\nthe harmony of our English speech, but they are marred by other passages of\r\nbitter raillery and invective. The most famous of all these works is the\r\nnoble plea called _Areopagitica:_ [Footnote: From the Areopagus or\r\nforum of Athens, the place of public appeal. This was the \"Mars Hill\" from\r\nwhich St. Paul addressed the Athenians, as recorded in the Book of Acts.]\r\n_a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing_ (1644).\r\n\r\nThere was a law in Milton's day forbidding the printing of any work until\r\nit had been approved by the official Licenser of Books. Such a law may have\r\nbeen beneficial at times, but during the seventeenth century it was another\r\ninstrument of tyranny, since no Licenser would allow anything to be printed\r\nagainst his particular church or government. When _Areopagitica_ was\r\nwritten the Puritans of the Long Parliament were virtually rulers of\r\nEngland, and Milton pleaded with his own party for the free expression of\r\nevery honest opinion, for liberty in all wholesome pleasures, and for\r\ntolerance in religious matters. His stern confidence in truth, that she\r\nwill not be weakened but strengthened by attack, is summarized in the\r\nfamous sentence, \"I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue.\"\r\n\r\nTwo interesting matters concerning _Areopagitica_ are: first, that\r\nthis eloquent plea for the freedom of printing had to be issued in defiance\r\nof law, without a license; and second, that Milton was himself, a few years\r\nlater, under Cromwell's iron government, a censor of the press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SONNETS]\r\n\r\nMilton's rare sonnets seem to belong to this middle period of strife,\r\nthough some of them were written earlier. Since Wyatt and Surrey had\r\nbrought the Italian sonnet to England this form of verse had been employed\r\nto sing of love; but with Milton it became a heroic utterance, a trumpet\r\nWordsworth calls it, summoning men to virtue, to patriotism, to stern\r\naction. The most personal of these sonnets are \"On Having Arrived at the\r\nAge of Twenty-three,\" \"On his Blindness\" and \"To Cyriack Skinner\"; the most\r\nromantic is \"To the Nightingale\"; others that are especially noteworthy are\r\n\"On the Late Massacre,\" \"On his Deceased Wife\" [Footnote: This beautiful\r\nsonnet was written to his second wife, not to Mary Powell.] and \"To\r\nCromwell.\" The spirit of these sonnets, in contrast with those of\r\nElizabethan times, is finely expressed by Landor in the lines:\r\n\r\n  Few his words, but strong,\r\n  And sounding through all ages and all climes;\r\n  He caught the sonnet from the dainty hand\r\n  Of Love, who cried to lose it, and he gave the notes\r\n  To Glory.\r\n\r\nMILTON'S LATER POETRY. [Footnote: The three poems of Milton's later life\r\nare _Paradise Lost_, _Paradise Regained_ and _Samson\r\nAgonistes_. The last-named has been referred to above under \"His\r\nMasterpiece\". _Paradise Regained_ contains some noble passages, but is\r\ninferior to _Paradise Lost_, on which the poet's fame chiefly rests.]\r\nIt was in 1658, the year of Cromwell's death, when the political power of\r\nPuritanism was tottering, that Milton in his blindness began to write\r\n_Paradise Lost_. After stating his theme he begins his epic, as Virgil\r\nbegan the _Æneid_, in the midst of the action; so that in reading his\r\nfirst book it is well to have in mind an outline of the whole story, which\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PLAN OF PARADISE LOST]\r\n\r\n    The scene opens in Heaven, and the time is before the creation of\r\n    the world. The archangel Lucifer rebels against the Almighty, and\r\n    gathers to his banner an immense company of the heavenly hosts, of\r\n    angels and flaming cherubim. A stupendous three days' battle\r\n    follows between rebel and loyal legions, the issue being in doubt\r\n    until the Son goes forth in his chariot of victory. Lucifer and his\r\n    rebels are defeated, and are hurled over the ramparts of Heaven.\r\n    Down, down through Chaos they fall \"nine times the space that\r\n    measures day and night,\" until they reach the hollow vaults of\r\n    Hell.\r\n\r\n    In the second act (for _Paradise Lost_ has some dramatic as\r\n    well as epic construction) we follow the creation of the earth in\r\n    the midst of the universe; and herein we have an echo of the old\r\n    belief that the earth was the center of the solar system. Adam and\r\n    Eve are formed to take in the Almighty's affection the place of the\r\n    fallen angels. They live happily in Paradise, watched over by\r\n    celestial guardians. Meanwhile Lucifer and his followers are\r\n    plotting revenge in Hell. They first boast valiantly, and talk of\r\n    mighty war; but the revenge finally degenerates into a base plan to\r\n    tempt Adam and Eve and win them over to the fallen hosts.\r\n\r\n    The third act shows Lucifer, now called Satan or the Adversary,\r\n    with his infernal peers in Pandemonium, plotting the ruin of the\r\n    world. He makes an astounding journey through Chaos, disguises\r\n    himself in various forms of bird or beast in order to watch Adam\r\n    and Eve, is detected by Ithuriel and the guardian angels, and is\r\n    driven away. Thereupon he haunts vast space, hiding in the shadow\r\n    of the earth until his chance comes, when he creeps back into Eden\r\n    by means of an underground river. Disguising himself as a serpent,\r\n    he meets Eve and tempts her with the fruit of a certain \"tree of\r\n    knowledge,\" which she has been forbidden to touch. She eats the\r\n    fruit and shares it with Adam; then the pair are discovered in\r\n    their disobedience, and are banished from Paradise. [Footnote: In\r\n    the above outline we have arranged the events in the order in which\r\n    they are supposed to have occurred. Milton tells the story in a\r\n    somewhat confused way. The order of the twelve books of _Paradise\r\n    Lost_ is not the natural or dramatic order of the story.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MILTON'S MATERIALS]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this outline that Milton uses material from two\r\ndifferent sources, one an ancient legend which Cædmon employed in his\r\nParaphrase, the other the Bible narrative of Creation. Though the latter is\r\nbut a small part of the epic, it is as a fixed center about which all other\r\ninterests are supposed to revolve. In reading _Paradise Lost_,\r\ntherefore, with its vast scenes and colossal figures, one should keep in\r\nmind that every detail was planned by Milton to be closely related to his\r\ncentral theme, which is the fall of man.\r\n\r\nIn using such diverse materials Milton met with difficulties, some of which\r\n(the character of Lucifer, for example) were too great for his limited\r\ndramatic powers. In Books I and II Lucifer is a magnificent figure, the\r\nproudest in all literature, a rebel with something of celestial grandeur\r\nabout him:\r\n\r\n  \"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,\"\r\n  Said then the lost Archangel, \"this the seat\r\n  That we must change for Heaven? this mournful gloom\r\n  For that celestial light? Be it so, since he\r\n  Who now is sovran can dispose and bid\r\n  What shall be right: farthest from him is best,\r\n  Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme\r\n  Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,\r\n  Where joy forever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,\r\n  Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,\r\n  Receive thy new possessor, one who brings\r\n  A mind not to be changed by place or time.\r\n  The mind is its own place, and in itself\r\n  Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.\r\n  What matter where, if I be still the same,\r\n  And what I should be, all but less than he\r\n  Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least\r\n  We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built\r\n  Here for his envy, will not drive us hence;\r\n  Here we may reign secure; and in my choice\r\n  To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:\r\n  Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIn other books of _Paradise Lost_ the same character appears not as\r\nthe heroic rebel but as the sneaking \"father of lies,\" all his grandeur\r\ngone, creeping as a snake into Paradise or sitting in the form of an ugly\r\ntoad \"squat at Eve's ear,\" whispering petty deceits to a woman while she\r\nsleeps. It is probable that Milton meant to show here the moral results of\r\nrebellion, but there is little in his poem to explain the sudden degeneracy\r\nfrom Lucifer to Satan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MATTER AND MANNER]\r\n\r\nThe reader will note, also, the strong contrast between Milton's matter and\r\nhis manner. His matter is largely mythical, and the myth is not beautiful\r\nor even interesting, but childish for the most part and frequently\r\ngrotesque, as when cannon are used in the battle of the angels, or when the\r\nAlmighty makes plans,\r\n\r\n                         Lest unawares we lose\r\n  This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\r\n\r\nIndeed, all Milton's celestial figures, with the exception of the original\r\nLucifer, are as banal as those of the old miracle plays; and his Adam and\r\nEve are dull, wooden figures that serve merely to voice the poet's theology\r\nor moral sentiments.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this unattractive matter, Milton's manner is always and\r\nunmistakably \"the grand manner.\" His imagination is lofty, his diction\r\nnoble, and the epic of _Paradise Lost_ is so filled with memorable\r\nlines, with gorgeous descriptions, with passages of unexampled majesty or\r\nharmony or eloquence, that the crude material which he injects into the\r\nBible narrative is lost sight of in our wonder at his superb style.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF MILTON. If it be asked, What is Milton's adjective? the word\r\n\"sublime\" rises to the lips as the best expression of his style. This word\r\n(from the Latin _sublimis_, meaning \"exalted above the ordinary\") is\r\nhard to define, but may be illustrated from one's familiar experience.\r\n\r\n    You stand on a hilltop overlooking a mighty landscape on which the\r\n    new snow has just fallen: the forest bending beneath its soft\r\n    burden, the fields all white and still, the air scintillating with\r\n    light and color, the whole world so clean and pure that it seems as\r\n    if God had blotted out its imperfections and adorned it for his own\r\n    pleasure. That is a sublime spectacle, and the soul of man is\r\n    exalted as he looks upon it. Or here in your own village you see a\r\n    woman who enters a room where a child is stricken with a deadly and\r\n    contagious disease. She immolates herself for the suffering one,\r\n    cares for him and saves him, then lays down her own life. That is a\r\n    sublime act. Or you hear of a young patriot captured and hanged by\r\n    the enemy, and as they lead him forth to death he says, \"I regret\r\n    that I have but one life to give to my country.\" That is a sublime\r\n    expression, and the feeling in your heart as you hear it is one of\r\n    moral sublimity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBLIMITY]\r\n\r\nThe writer who lifts our thought and feeling above their ordinary level,\r\nwho gives us an impression of outward grandeur or of moral exaltation, is a\r\nsublime writer, has a sublime style; and Milton more than any other poet\r\ndeserves the adjective. His scenes are immeasurable; mountain, sea and\r\nforest are but his playthings; his imagination hesitates not to paint\r\nChaos, Heaven, Hell, the widespread Universe in which our world hangs like\r\na pendant star and across which stretches the Milky Way:\r\n\r\n  A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,\r\n  And pavement stars.\r\n\r\nNo other poet could find suitable words for such vast themes, but Milton\r\nnever falters. Read the assembly of the fallen hosts before Lucifer in Book\r\nI of _Paradise Lost_, or the opening of Hellgates in Book II, or the\r\ninvocation to light in Book III, or Satan's invocation to the sun in Book\r\nIV, or the morning hymn of Adam and Eve in Book V; or open _Paradise\r\nLost_ anywhere, and you shall soon find some passage which, by the\r\ngrandeur of its scene or by the exalted feeling of the poet as he describes\r\nit, awakens in you the feeling of sublimity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HARMONY]\r\n\r\nThe harmony of Milton's verse is its second notable quality. Many of our\r\npoets use blank verse, as many other people walk, as if they had no sense\r\nof rhythm within them; but Milton, by reason of his long study and practice\r\nof music, seems to be always writing to melody. In consequence it is easy\r\nto read his most prolix passages, as it is easy to walk over almost any\r\nkind of ground if one but keeps step to outward or inward music. Not only\r\nis Milton's verse stately and melodious, but he is a perfect master of\r\nwords, choosing them for their sound as well as for their sense, as a\r\nmusician chooses different instruments to express different emotions. Note\r\nthese contrasting descriptions of so simple a matter as the opening of\r\ngates:\r\n\r\n                       Heaven opened wide\r\n  Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound,\r\n  On golden hinges moving. On a sudden open fly\r\n  With impetuous recoil and jarring sound\r\n  Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\r\n  Harsh thunder.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with a poet of such magnificent qualities one should be wary of\r\ncriticism. That Milton's poetry has little human interest, no humor, and\r\nplenty of faults, may be granted. His _Paradise Lost_ especially is\r\novercrowded with mere learning or pedantry in one place and with pompous\r\ncommonplaces in another. But such faults appear trivial, unworthy of\r\nmention in the presence of a poem that is as a storehouse from which the\r\nauthors and statesmen of three hundred years have drawn their choicest\r\nimages and expressions. It stands forever as our supreme example of\r\nsublimity and harmony,--that sublimity which reflects the human spirit\r\nstanding awed and reverent before the grandeur of the universe; that\r\nharmony of expression at which every great poet aims and which Milton\r\nattained in such measure that he is called the organ-voice of England.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN BUNYAN (1628-1688)\r\n\r\nThere is a striking contrast between the poet and the prose writer of the\r\nPuritan age. Milton the poet is a man of culture, familiar with the best\r\nliterature of all ages; Bunyan the prose writer is a poor, self-taught\r\nlaborer who reads his Bible with difficulty, stumbling over the hard\r\npassages. Milton writes for the cultivated classes, in harmonious verse\r\nadorned with classic figures; Bunyan speaks for common men in sinewy prose,\r\nand makes his meaning clear by homely illustrations drawn from daily life.\r\nMilton is a solitary and austere figure, admirable but not lovable; Bunyan\r\nis like a familiar acquaintance, ruddy-faced, clear-eyed, who wins us by\r\nhis sympathy, his friendliness, his good sense and good humor. He is known\r\nas the author of one book, _The Pilgrim's Progress_, but that book has\r\nprobably had more readers than any other that England has ever produced.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. During Bunyan's lifetime England was in a state of religious\r\n    ferment or revival, and his experience of it is vividly portrayed\r\n    in a remarkable autobiography called _Grace Abounding to the\r\n    Chief of inners_. In reading this book we find that his life is\r\n    naturally separated into two periods. His youth was a time of\r\n    struggle with doubts and temptations; his later years were\r\n    characterized by inward peace and tireless labor. His peace meant\r\n    that he was saved, his labor that he must save others. Here, in a\r\n    word, is the secret of all his works.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN BUNYAN]\r\n\r\n    He was born (1628) in the village of Elstow, Bedfordshire, and was\r\n    the son of a poor tinker. He was sent to school long enough to\r\n    learn elementary reading and writing; then he followed the tinker's\r\n    trade; but at the age of sixteen, being offended at his father's\r\n    second marriage, he ran away and joined the army.\r\n\r\n    As a boy Bunyan had a vivid but morbid imagination, which led him\r\n    to terrible doubts, fears, fits of despondency, hallucinations. On\r\n    such a nature the emotional religious revivals of the age made a\r\n    tremendous impression. He followed them for years, living in a\r\n    state of torment, until he felt himself converted; whereupon he\r\n    turned preacher and began to call other sinners to repentance. Such\r\n    were his native power and rude eloquence that, wherever he went,\r\n    the common people thronged to hear him.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: IN BEDFORD JAIL]\r\n\r\n    After the Restoration all this was changed. Public meetings were\r\n    forbidden unless authorized by bishops of the Established Church,\r\n    and Bunyan was one of the first to be called to account. When\r\n    ordered to hold no more meetings he refused to obey, saying that\r\n    when the Lord called him to preach salvation he would listen only\r\n    to the Lord's voice. Then he was thrown into Bedford jail. During\r\n    his imprisonment he supported his family by making shoe laces, and\r\n    wrote _Grace Abounding_ and _The Pilgrim's Progress_.\r\n\r\n    After his release Bunyan became the most popular writer and\r\n    preacher in England. He wrote a large number of works, and went\r\n    cheerfully up and down the land, preaching the gospel to the poor,\r\n    helping the afflicted, doing an immense amount of good. He died\r\n    (1688) as the result of exposure while on an errand of mercy. His\r\n    works were then known only to humble readers, and not until long\r\n    years had passed did critics awaken to the fact that one of\r\n    England's most powerful and original writers had passed away with\r\n    the poor tinker of Elstow.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BUNYAN. From the pen of this uneducated preacher came nearly sixty\r\nworks, great and small, the most notable of which are: _Grace\r\nAbounding_ (1666), a kind of spiritual autobiography; _The Holy\r\nWar_ (1665), a prose allegory with a theme similar to that of Milton's\r\nepic; and _The Life and Death of Mr. Badman_ (1682), a character study\r\nwhich was a forerunner of the English novel. These works are seldom read,\r\nand Bunyan is known to most readers as the author of _The Pilgrim's\r\nProgress_ (1678). This is the famous allegory [Footnote: Allegory is\r\nfigurative writing, in which some outward object or event is described in\r\nsuch a way that we apply the description to humanity, to our mental or\r\nspiritual experiences. The object of allegory, as a rule, is to teach moral\r\nlessons, and in this it is like a drawn-out fable and like a parable. The\r\ntwo greatest allegories in our literature are Spenser's _Faery Queen_\r\nand Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_.] in which, under guise of telling\r\nthe story of a pilgrim in search of a city, Bunyan portrays the experiences\r\nof humanity in its journey from this world to the next. Here is an outline\r\nof the story:\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: STORY OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS]\r\n\r\n    In the City of Destruction lives a poor sinner called Christian.\r\n    When he learns that the city is doomed, he is terrified and flees\r\n    out of it, carrying a great burden on his back. He is followed by\r\n    the jeers of his neighbors, who have no fear. He seeks a safe and\r\n    abiding city to dwell in, but is ignorant how to find it until\r\n    Evangelist shows him the road.\r\n\r\n    As he goes on his journey Mr. Worldly Wiseman meets him and urges\r\n    him to return; but he hastens on, only to plunge into the Slough of\r\n    Despond. His companion Pliable is here discouraged and turns back.\r\n    Christian struggles on through the mud and reaches the Wicket Gate,\r\n    where Interpreter shows him the way to the Celestial City. As he\r\n    passes a cross beside the path, the heavy burden which he carries\r\n    (his load of sins) falls off of itself. Then with many adventures\r\n    he climbs the steep hill Difficulty, where his eyes behold the\r\n    Castle Beautiful. To reach this he must pass some fearful lions in\r\n    the way, but he adventures on, finds that the lions are chained, is\r\n    welcomed by the porter Watchful, and is entertained in the castle\r\n    overnight.\r\n\r\n    Dangers thicken and difficulties multiply as he resumes his\r\n    journey. His road is barred by the demon Apollyon, whom he fights\r\n    to the death. The way now dips downward into the awful Valley of\r\n    the Shadow. Passing through this, he enters the town of Vanity,\r\n    goes to Vanity Fair, where he is abused and beaten, and where his\r\n    companion Faithful is condemned to death. As he escapes from\r\n    Vanity, the giant Despair seizes him and hurls him into the gloomy\r\n    dungeon of Doubt. Again he escapes, struggles onward, and reaches\r\n    the Delectable Mountains. There for the first time he sees the\r\n    Celestial City, but between him and his refuge is a river, deep and\r\n    terrible, without bridge or ford. He crosses it, and the journey\r\n    ends as angels come singing down the streets to welcome Christian\r\n    into the city. [Footnote: This is the story of the first part of\r\n    _Pilgrim's Progress_, which was written in Bedford jail, but\r\n    not published till some years later. In 1684 Bunyan published the\r\n    second part of his story, describing the adventures of Christiana\r\n    and her children on their journey to the Celestial City. This\r\n    sequel, like most others, is of minor importance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUNYAN MEETINGHOUSE, SOUTHWARK]\r\n\r\nSuch an outline gives but a faint idea of Bunyan's great work, of its\r\nrealistic figures, its living and speaking characters, its knowledge of\r\nhumanity, its portrayal of the temptations and doubts that beset the\r\nordinary man, its picturesque style, which of itself would make the book\r\nstand out above ten thousand ordinary stories. _Pilgrim's Progress_ is\r\nstill one of our best examples of clear, forceful, idiomatic English; and\r\nour wonder increases when we remember that it was written by a man ignorant\r\nof literary models. But he had read his Bible daily until its style and\r\nimagery had taken possession of him; also he had a vivid imagination, a\r\nsincere purpose to help his fellows, and his simple rule of rhetoric was to\r\nforget himself and deliver his message. In one of his poems he gives us his\r\nrule of expression, which is an excellent one for writers and speakers:\r\n\r\n                         Thine only way,\r\n  Before them all, is to say out thy say\r\n  In thine own native language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN DRYDEN (1631-1700)\r\n\r\nFor fifty years Dryden lived in the city of Milton, in the country of John\r\nBunyan; but his works might indicate that he inhabited a different planet.\r\nUnlike his two great contemporaries, his first object was to win favor; he\r\nsold his talent to the highest bidder, won the leading place among\r\nsecond-rate Restoration writers, and was content to reflect a generation\r\nwhich had neither the hearty enthusiasm of Elizabethan times nor the moral\r\nearnestness of Puritanism.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Knowledge of Dryden's life is rather meager, and as his\r\n    motives are open to question we shall state here only a few facts.\r\n    He was born of a Puritan and aristocratic family, at Aldwinkle, in\r\n    1631. After an excellent education, which included seven years at\r\n    Trinity College, Cambridge, he turned to literature as a means of\r\n    earning a livelihood, taking a worldly view of his profession and\r\n    holding his pen ready to serve the winning side. Thus, he wrote his\r\n    \"Heroic Stanzas,\" which have a hearty Puritan ring, on the death of\r\n    Cromwell; but he turned Royalist and wrote the more flattering\r\n    \"Astræa Redux\" to welcome Charles II back to power.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS VERSATILITY]\r\n\r\n    In literature Dryden proved himself a man of remarkable\r\n    versatility. Because plays were in demand, he produced many that\r\n    catered to the evil tastes of the Restoration stage,--plays that he\r\n    afterwards condemned unsparingly. He was equally ready to write\r\n    prose or verse, songs, criticisms, political satires. In 1670 he\r\n    was made poet laureate under Charles II; his affairs prospered; he\r\n    became a literary dictator in London, holding forth nightly in\r\n    Will's Coffeehouse to an admiring circle of listeners. After the\r\n    Revolution of 1688 he lost his offices, and with them most of his\r\n    income.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN DRYDEN\r\n    From a picture by Hudson in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge]\r\n\r\n    In his old age, being reduced to hackwork, he wrote obituaries,\r\n    epitaphs, paraphrases of the tales of Chaucer, translations of\r\n    Latin poets,--anything to earn an honest living. He died in 1700,\r\n    and was buried beside Chaucer in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n    Such facts are not interesting; nor do they give us a true idea of\r\n    the man Dryden. To understand him we should have to read his works\r\n    (no easy or pleasant task) and compare his prose prefaces, in which\r\n    he is at his best, with the comedies in which he is abominable.\r\n    When not engaged with the degenerate stage, or with political or\r\n    literary or religious controversies, he appears sane,\r\n    well-balanced, good-tempered, manly; but the impression is not a\r\n    lasting one. He seems to have catered to the vicious element of his\r\n    own age, to have regretted the misuse of his talent, and to have\r\n    recorded his own judgment in two lines from his ode \"To the Memory\r\n    of Mrs. Killigrew\":\r\n\r\n      O gracious God, how far have we\r\n      Profaned thy heavenly grace of poesy!\r\n\r\nWORKS OF DRYDEN. The occasional poems written by Dryden may be left in the\r\nobscurity into which they fell after they had been applauded. The same may\r\nbe said of his typical poem \"Annus Mirabilis,\" which describes the\r\nwonderful events of the year 1666, a year which witnessed the taking of New\r\nAmsterdam from the Dutch and the great fire of London. Both events were\r\ncelebrated in a way to contribute to the glory of King Charles and to\r\nDryden's political fortune. Of all his poetical works, only the odes\r\nwritten in honor of St. Cecilia are now remembered. The second ode,\r\n\"Alexander's Feast,\" is one of our best poems on the power of music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS PLAYS]\r\n\r\nDryden's numerous plays show considerable dramatic power, and every one of\r\nthem contains some memorable line or passage; but they are spoiled by the\r\nauthor's insincerity in trying to satisfy the depraved taste of the\r\nRestoration stage. He wrote one play, _All for Love_, to please\r\nhimself, he said, and it is noticeable that this play is written in blank\r\nverse and shows the influence of Shakespeare, who was then out of fashion.\r\nIf any of the plays are to be read, _All for Love_ should be selected,\r\nthough it is exceptional, not typical, and gives but a faint idea of\r\nDryden's ordinary dramatic methods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SATIRES]\r\n\r\nIn the field of political satire Dryden was a master, and his work here is\r\ninteresting as showing that unfortunate alliance between literature and\r\npolitics which led many of the best English writers of the next century to\r\nsell their services to the Whigs or Tories. Dryden sided with the later\r\nparty and, in a kind of allegory of the Bible story of Absalom's revolt\r\nagainst David, wrote \"Absalom and Achitophel\" to glorify the Tories and to\r\ncastigate the Whigs. This powerful political satire was followed by others\r\nin the same vein, and by \"MacFlecknoe,\" which satirized certain poets with\r\nwhom Dryden was at loggerheads. As a rule, such works are for a day, having\r\nno enduring interest because they have no human kindness, but occasionally\r\nDryden portrays a man of his own time so well that his picture applies to\r\nthe vulgar politician of all ages, as in this characterization of Burnet:\r\n\r\n  Prompt to assail and careless of defence,\r\n  Invulnerable in his impudence,\r\n  He dares the world, and eager of a name\r\n  He thrusts about and justles into fame;\r\n  So fond of loud report that, not to miss.\r\n  Of being known (his last and utmost bliss),\r\n  He rather would be known for what he is.\r\n\r\nThese satires of Dryden were largely influential in establishing the heroic\r\ncouplet, [Footnote: The heroic couplet consists of two iambic pentameter\r\nlines that rime. By \"pentameter\" is meant that the line has five feet or\r\nmeasures; by \"iambic,\" that each foot contains two syllables, the first\r\nshort or unaccented, the second long or accented.] which dominated the\r\nfashion of English poetry for the next century. The couplet had been used\r\nby earlier poets, Chaucer for example; but in his hands it was musical and\r\nunobtrusive, a minor part of a complete work. With Dryden, and with his\r\ncontemporary Waller, the making of couplets was the main thing; in their\r\nhands the couplet became \"closed,\" that is, it often contained a complete\r\nthought, a criticism, a nugget of common sense, a poem in itself, as in\r\nthis aphorism from \"MacFlecknoe\":\r\n\r\n  All human things are subject to decay,\r\n  And when Fate summons, monarchs must obey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROSE WORKS]\r\n\r\nIn his prose works Dryden proved himself the ablest critic of his time, and\r\nthe inventor of a neat, serviceable style which, with flattery to\r\nourselves, we are wont to call modern. Among his numerous critical works we\r\nnote especially \"An Essay of Dramatic Poesy,\" \"Of Heroic Plays,\" \"Discourse\r\non Satire,\" and the Preface to his _Fables_. These have not the vigor\r\nor picturesqueness of Bunyan's prose, but they are written clearly, in\r\nshort sentences, with the chief aim of being understood. If we compare them\r\nwith the sonorous periods of Milton, or with the pretty involutions of\r\nSidney, we shall see why Dryden is called \"the father of modern prose.\" His\r\nsensible style appears in this criticism of Chaucer:\r\n\r\n    \"He must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature,\r\n    because, as it has been truly observed of him, he has taken into\r\n    the compass of his _Canterbury Tales_ the various manners and\r\n    humours (as we now call them) of the whole English nation in his\r\n    age. Not a single character has escaped him.... We have our fathers\r\n    and great-grand-dames all before us as they were in Chaucer's days:\r\n    their general characters are still remaining in mankind, and even\r\n    in England, though they are called by other names than those of\r\n    monks and friars and canons and lady abbesses and nuns; for mankind\r\n    is ever the same, and nothing lost out of nature though everything\r\n    is altered.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECONDARY WRITERS\r\n\r\nPURITAN AND CAVALIER VERSE. The numerous minor poets of this period are\r\noften arranged in groups, but any true classification is impossible since\r\nthere was no unity among them. Each was a law unto himself, and the result\r\nwas to emphasize personal oddity or eccentricity. It would seem that in\r\nwriting of love, the common theme of poets, Puritan and Cavalier must alike\r\nspeak the common language of the heart; but that is precisely what they did\r\nnot do. With them love was no longer a passion, or even a fashion, but any\r\nfantastic conceit that might decorate a rime. Thus, Suckling habitually\r\nmade love a joke:\r\n\r\n  Why so pale and wan, fond lover,\r\n    Prithee why so pale?\r\n  Will, when looking well wont move her,\r\n    Looking ill prevail?\r\n    Prithee why so pale?\r\n\r\nCrashaw turned from his religious poems to sing of love in a way to appeal\r\nto the Transcendentalists, of a later age:\r\n\r\n  Whoe'er she be,\r\n  That not impossible she\r\n  That shall command my heart and me.\r\n\r\nAnd Donne must search out some odd notion from natural (or unnatural)\r\nhistory, making love a spider that turns the wine of life into poison; or\r\nfrom mechanics, comparing lovers to a pair of dividers:\r\n\r\n  If they be two, they are two so\r\n    As stiff twin compasses are two:\r\n  Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\r\n    To move, but doth if the other do.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE HERBERT\r\nFrom a rare print by White, prefixed to his poems]\r\n\r\nSeveral of these poets, commonly grouped in a class which includes Donne,\r\nHerbert, Cowley, Crashaw, and others famous in their day, received the name\r\nof metaphysical poets, not because of their profound thought, but because\r\nof their eccentric style and queer figures of speech. Of all this group\r\nGeorge Herbert (1593-1633) is the sanest and the sweetest. His chief work,\r\n_The Temple_, is a collection of poems celebrating the beauty of\r\nholiness, the sacraments, the Church, the experiences of the Christian\r\nlife. Some of these poems are ingenious conceits, and deserve the derisive\r\nname of \"metaphysical\" which Dr. Johnson flung at them; but others, such as\r\n\"Virtue,\" \"The Pulley,\" \"Love\" and \"The Collar,\" are the expression of a\r\nbeautiful and saintly soul, speaking of the deep things of God; and\r\nspeaking so quietly withal that one is apt to miss the intensity that lurks\r\neven in his calmest verses. Note in these opening and closing stanzas of\r\n\"Virtue\" the restraint of the one, the hidden glow of the other:\r\n\r\n  Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n    The bridal of the earth and sky!\r\n  The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\n    For thou must die.\r\n\r\n  Only a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\n    Like seasoned timber, never gives;\r\n  But, though the whole world turn to coal,\r\n    Then chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAVALIER POETS]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the disciplined Puritan spirit of Herbert is the gayety of\r\nanother group, called the Cavalier poets, among whom are Carew, Suckling\r\nand Lovelace. They reflect clearly the spirit of the Royalists who followed\r\nKing Charles with a devotion worthy of a better master. Robert Herrick\r\n(1591-1674) is the best known of this group, and his only book,\r\n_Hesperides and Noble Numbers_ (1648), reflects the two elements found\r\nin most of the minor poetry of the age; namely, Cavalier gayety and Puritan\r\nseriousness. In the first part of the book are some graceful verses\r\ncelebrating the light loves of the Cavaliers and the fleeting joys of\r\ncountry life:\r\n\r\n  I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds and bowers,\r\n  Of April, May, of June and July flowers;\r\n  I sing of Maypoles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,\r\n  Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal cakes.\r\n\r\nIn _Noble Numbers_ such poems as \"Thanksgiving,\" \"A True Lent,\"\r\n\"Litany,\" and the child's \"Ode on the Birth of Our Saviour\" reflect the\r\nbetter side of the Cavalier, who can be serious without pulling a long\r\nface, who goes to his devotions cheerfully, and who retains even in his\r\nreligion what Andrew Lang calls a spirit of unregenerate happiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BUTLER'S HUDIBRAS]\r\n\r\nSamuel Butler (1612-1680) may also be classed with the Cavalier poets,\r\nthough in truth he stands alone in this age, a master of doggerel rime and\r\nof ferocious satire. His chief work, _Hudibras_, a grotesque\r\ncaricature of Puritanism, appeared in 1663, when the restored king and his\r\nfavorites were shamelessly plundering the government. The poem (probably\r\nsuggested by _Don Quixote_) relates a rambling story of the adventures\r\nof Sir Hudibras, a sniveling Puritan knight, and his squire Ralpho. Its\r\ndoggerel style may be inferred from the following:\r\n\r\n  Besides, 'tis known he could speak Greek\r\n  As naturally as pigs squeak;\r\n  That Latin was no more difficle\r\n  Than to a blackbird 'tis to whistle:\r\n  Being rich in both, he never scanted\r\n  His bounty unto such as wanted.\r\n\r\nSuch was the stuff that the Royalists quoted to each other as wit; and the\r\nwit was so dear to king and courtiers that they carried copies of\r\n_Hudibras_ around in their pockets. The poem was enormously popular in\r\nits day, and some of its best lines are still quoted; but the selections we\r\nnow meet give but a faint idea of the general scurrility of a work which\r\namused England in the days when the Puritan's fanaticism was keenly\r\nremembered, his struggle for liberty quite forgotten.\r\n\r\nPROSE WRITERS. Of the hundreds of prose works that appeared in Puritan\r\ntimes very few are now known even by name. Their controversial fires are\r\nsunk to ashes; even the causes that produced or fanned them are forgotten.\r\nMeanwhile we cherish a few books that speak not of strife but of peace and\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR THOMAS BROWNE]\r\n\r\nThomas Browne (1605-1682) was a physician, vastly learned in a day when he\r\nand other doctors gravely prescribed herbs or bloodsuckers for witchcraft;\r\nbut he was less interested in his profession than in what was then called\r\nmodern science. His most famous work is _Religio Medici_ (Religion of\r\na Physician, 1642), a beautiful book, cherished by those who know it as one\r\nof the greatest prose works in the language. His _Urn Burial_ is even\r\nmore remarkable for its subtle thought and condensed expression; but its\r\ncharm, like that of the Silent Places, is for the few who can discover and\r\nappreciate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISAAC WALTON]\r\n\r\nIsaac Walton (1593-1683), or Isaak, as he always wrote it, was a modest\r\nlinen merchant who, in the midst of troublous times, kept his serenity of\r\nspirit by attending strictly to his own affairs, by reading good books, and\r\nby going fishing. His taste for literature is reflected with rare\r\nsimplicity in his _Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, George Herbert and\r\nBishop Sanderson_, a series of biographies which are among the earliest\r\nand sweetest in our language. Their charm lies partly in their refined\r\nstyle, but more largely in their revelation of character; for Walton chose\r\nmen of gentle spirit for his subjects, men who were like himself in\r\ncherishing the still depths of life rather than its noisy shallows, and\r\nwrote of them with the understanding of perfect sympathy. Wordsworth\r\nexpressed his appreciation of the work in a noble sonnet beginning:\r\n\r\n  There are no colours in the fairest sky\r\n  So fair as these. The feather whence the pen\r\n  Was shaped that traced the lives of these good men\r\n  Dropped from an angel's wing.\r\n\r\nWalton's love of fishing, and of all the lore of trout brooks and spring\r\nmeadows that fishing implies, found expression in _The Compleat Angler,\r\nor Contemplative Man's Recreation_ (1653). This is a series of\r\nconversations in which an angler convinces his friends that fishing is not\r\nmerely the sport of catching fish, but an art that men are born to, like\r\nthe art of poetry. Even such a hard-hearted matter as impaling a minnow for\r\nbait becomes poetical, for this is the fashion of it: \"Put your hook in at\r\nhis mouth, and out at his gills, and do it as if you loved him.\" It is\r\nenough to say of this old work, the classic of its kind, that it deserves\r\nall the honor which the tribe of anglers have given it, and that you could\r\nhardly find a better book to fall asleep over after a day's fishing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVELYN AND PEPYS]\r\n\r\nNo such gentle, human, lovable books were produced in Restoration times.\r\nThe most famous prose works of the period are the diaries of John Evelyn\r\nand Samuel Pepys. The former was a gentleman, and his _Diary_ is an\r\ninteresting chronicle of matters large and small from 1641 to 1697. Pepys,\r\nthough he became Secretary of the Admiralty and President of the Royal\r\nSociety, was a gossip, a chatterbox, with an eye that loved to peek into\r\nclosets and a tongue that ran to slander. His _Diary_, covering the\r\nperiod from 1660 to 1669, is a keen but malicious exposition of private and\r\npublic life during the Restoration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The literary period just studied covers the last three\r\n    quarters of the seventeenth century. Its limits are very\r\n    indefinite, merging into Elizabethan romance on the one side, and\r\n    into eighteenth century formalism on the other. Historically, the\r\n    period was one of bitter conflict between two main political and\r\n    religious parties, the Royalists, or Cavaliers, and the Puritans.\r\n    The literature of the age is extremely diverse in character, and is\r\n    sadly lacking in the unity, the joyousness, the splendid enthusiasm\r\n    of Elizabethan prose and poetry.\r\n\r\n    The greatest writer of the period was John Milton. He is famous in\r\n    literature for his early or Horton poems, which are Elizabethan in\r\n    spirit; for his controversial prose works, which reflect the strife\r\n    of the age; for his epic of _Paradise Lost_, and for his\r\n    tragedy of _Samson_.\r\n\r\n    Another notable Puritan, or rather Independent, writer was John\r\n    Bunyan, whose works reflect the religious ferment of the\r\n    seventeenth century. His chief works are _Grace Abounding_, a\r\n    kind of spiritual biography, and _The Pilgrim's Progress_, an\r\n    allegory of the Christian life which has been more widely read than\r\n    any other English book.\r\n\r\n    The chief writer of the Restoration period was John Dryden, a\r\n    professional author, who often catered to the coarser tastes of the\r\n    age. There is no single work by which he is gratefully remembered.\r\n    He is noted for his political satires, for his vigorous use of the\r\n    heroic couplet, for his modern prose style, and for his literary\r\n    criticisms.\r\n\r\n    Among the numerous minor poets of the period, Robert Herrick and\r\n    George Herbert are especially noteworthy. A few miscellaneous prose\r\n    works are the _Religio Medici_ of Thomas Browne, _The\r\n    Compleat Angler_ of Isaac Walton, and the diaries of Pepys and\r\n    Evelyn.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

The most striking political feature of the\r\n    times was the rise of constitutional and party government. The\r\n    Revolution of 1688, which banished the Stuarts, had settled the\r\n    king question by making Parliament supreme in England, but not all\r\n    Englishmen were content with the settlement. No sooner were the\r\n    people in control of the government than they divided into hostile\r\n    parties: the liberal Whigs, who were determined to safeguard\r\n    popular liberty, and the conservative Tories, with tender memories\r\n    of kingcraft, who would leave as much authority as possible in the\r\n    royal hands. On the extreme of Toryism was a third party of\r\n    zealots, called the Jacobites, who aimed to bring the Stuarts back\r\n    to the throne, and who for fifty years filled Britain with plots\r\n    and rebellion. The literature of the age was at times dominated by\r\n    the interests of these contending factions.\r\n\r\n    The two main parties were so well balanced that power shifted\r\n    easily from one to the other. To overturn a Tory or a Whig cabinet\r\n    only a few votes were necessary, and to influence such votes London\r\n    was flooded with pamphlets. Even before the great newspapers\r\n    appeared, the press had become a mighty power in England, and any\r\n    writer with a talent for argument or satire was almost certain to\r\n    be hired by party leaders. Addison, Steele, Defoe, Swift,--most of\r\n    the great writers of the age were, on occasion, the willing\r\n    servants of the Whigs or Tories. So the new politician replaced the\r\n    old nobleman as a patron of letters.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SOCIAL LIFE]\r\n\r\n    Another feature of the age was the rapid development of social\r\n    life. In earlier ages the typical Englishman had lived much by\r\n    himself; his home was his castle, and in it he developed his\r\n    intense individualism;  but in the first half of the eighteenth\r\n    century some three thousand public coffeehouses and a large number\r\n    of private clubs appeared in London alone; and the sociability of\r\n    which these clubs were an expression was typical of all English\r\n    cities. Meanwhile country life was in sore need of refinement.\r\n\r\n    The influence of this social life on literature was inevitable.\r\n    Nearly all writers frequented the coffeehouses, and matters\r\n    discussed there became subjects of literature; hence the enormous\r\n    amount of eighteenth-century writing devoted to transient affairs,\r\n    to politics, fashions, gossip. Moreover, as the club leaders set\r\n    the fashion in manners or dress, in the correct way of taking snuff\r\n    or of wearing wigs and ruffles, so the literary leaders emphasized\r\n    formality or correctness of style, and to write prose like Addison,\r\n    or verse like Pope, became the ambition of aspiring young authors.\r\n\r\n    There are certain books of the period (seldom studied amongst its\r\n    masterpieces) which are the best possible expression of its thought\r\n    and manners. The Letters of Lord Chesterfield, for example,\r\n    especially those written to his son, are more significant, and more\r\n    readable, than anything produced by Johnson. Even better are the\r\n    Memoirs of Horace Walpole, and his gossipy Letters, of which\r\n    Thackeray wrote:\r\n\r\n        \"Fiddles sing all through them; wax lights, fine dresses,\r\n        fine jokes, fine plate, fine equipages glitter and sparkle;\r\n        never was such a brilliant, smirking Vanity Fair as that\r\n        through which he leads us.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SPREAD OF EMPIRE]\r\n\r\n    Two other significant features of the age were the large part\r\n    played by England in Continental wars, and the rapid expansion of\r\n    the British empire. These Continental wars, which have ever since\r\n    influenced British policy, seem to have originated (aside from the\r\n    important matter of self-interest) in a double motive: to prevent\r\n    any one nation from gaining overwhelming superiority by force of\r\n    arms, and to save the smaller \"buffer\" states from being absorbed\r\n    by their powerful neighbors. Thus the War of the Spanish Succession\r\n    (1711) prevented the union of the French and Spanish monarchies,\r\n    and preserved the smaller states of Holland and Germany. As Addison\r\n    then wrote, at least half truthfully:\r\n\r\n      'T is Britain's care to watch o'er Europe's fate,\r\n      And hold in balance each contending state:\r\n      To threaten bold, presumptuous kings with war,\r\n      And answer her afflicted neighbors' prayer. [1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote [1]: From Addison's Address to Liberty, in his poetical\r\n    \"Letter to Lord Halifax.\"]\r\n\r\n    The expansion of the empire, on the whole the most marvelous\r\n    feature of English history, received a tremendous impetus in this\r\n    age when India, Australia and the greater part of North America\r\n    were added to the British dominions, and when Captain Cook opened\r\n    the way for a belt of colonies around the whole world.\r\n\r\n    The influence of the last-named movement hardly appears in the\r\n    books which we ordinarily read as typical of the age. There are\r\n    other books, however, which one may well read for his own\r\n    unhampered enjoyment: such expansive books as Hawkesworth's\r\n    _Voyages_ (1773), corresponding to Hakluyt's famous record of\r\n    Elizabethan exploration, and especially the _Voyages of Captain\r\n    Cook_, [Footnote: The first of Cook's fateful voyages appears in\r\n    Hawkesworth's collection. The second was recorded by Cook himself\r\n    (1777), and the third by Cook and Captain King (1784). See Synge,\r\n    _Captain Cook's Voyages Around the World_ (London, 1897).]\r\n    which take us from the drawing-room chatter of politics or fashion\r\n    or criticism into a world of adventure and great achievement. In\r\n    such works, which make no profession of literary style, we feel the\r\n    lure of the sea and of lands beyond the horizon, which is as the\r\n    mighty background of English literature from Anglo-Saxon times to\r\n    the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to summarize the literature of this age, or to group such\r\nantagonistic writers as Swift and Addison, Pope and Burns, Defoe and\r\nJohnson, Goldsmith and Fielding, with any fine discrimination. It is simply\r\nfor convenience, therefore, that we study eighteenth-century writings in\r\nthree main divisions: the reign of so-called classicism, the revival of\r\nromantic poetry, and the beginnings of the modern novel. As a whole, it is\r\nan age of prose rather than of poetry, and in this respect it differs from\r\nall preceding ages of English literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *      *\r\n\r\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY CLASSICISM\r\n\r\nThe above title is an unfortunate one, but since it is widely used we must\r\ntry to understand it as best we can. Yet when one begins to define\r\n\"classicism\" one is reminded of that old bore Polonius, who tells how\r\nHamlet is affected:\r\n\r\n                      Your noble son is mad:\r\n  Mad, call I it; for to define true madness,\r\n  What is't but to be nothing else but mad?\r\n\r\nIn our literature the word \"classic\" was probably first used in connection\r\nwith the writers of Greece and Rome, and any English work which showed the\r\ninfluence of such writers was said to have a classic style. If we seek to\r\nthe root of the word, we shall find that it refers to the _classici_,\r\nthat is, to the highest of the classes into which the census divided the\r\nRoman people; hence the proper use of \"classic\" to designate the writings\r\nthat have won first rank in any nation. As Goethe said, \"Everything that is\r\ngood in literature is classical.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLASSIC AND PSEUDO-CLASSIC]\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the word \"classic\" came to have a different meaning, a\r\nmeaning now expressed by the word \"formal.\" In the Elizabethan age, as we\r\nhave seen, critics insisted that English plays should conform to the rules\r\nor \"unities\" of the Greek drama, and plays written according to such rules\r\nwere called classic. Again, in the eighteenth century, English poets took\r\nto studying ancient authors, especially Horace, to find out how poetry\r\nshould be written. Having discovered, as they thought, the rules of\r\ncomposition, they insisted on following such rules rather than individual\r\ngenius or inspiration. It is largely because of this adherence to rules,\r\nthis slavery to a fashion of the time, that so much of eighteenth-century\r\nverse seems cold and artificial, a thing made to order rather than the\r\nnatural expression of human feeling. The writers themselves were well\r\nsatisfied with their formality, however, and called their own the Classic\r\nor Augustan age of English letters. [Footnote: Though the eighteenth\r\ncentury was dominated by this formal spirit, it had, like every other age,\r\nits classic and romantic movements. The work of Gray, Burns and other\r\nromantic poets will be considered later.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALEXANDER POPE (1688-1744)\r\n\r\nIt was in 1819 that a controversy arose over the question, Was Pope a poet?\r\nTo have asked that in 1719 would have indicated that the questioner was\r\nignorant; to have asked it  a half century later might have raised a doubt\r\nas to his sanity, for by that time Pope was acclaimed as a master by the\r\ngreat majority of poets in England and America. We judge now, looking at\r\nhim in perspective and comparing him with Chaucer or Burns, that he was not\r\na great poet but simply the kind of poet that the age demanded. He belongs\r\nto eighteenth-century London exclusively, and herein he differs from the\r\nmaster poets who are at home in all places and expressive of all time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER POPE]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Pope is an interesting but not a lovable figure. Against the\r\n    petty details of his life we should place, as a background, these\r\n    amazing achievements: that this poor cripple, weak of body and\r\n    spiteful of mind, was the supreme literary figure of his age; that\r\n    he demonstrated how an English poet could live by his pen, instead\r\n    of depending on patrons; that he won greater fame and fortune than\r\n    Shakespeare or Milton received from their contemporaries; that he\r\n    dominated the fashion of English poetry during his lifetime, and\r\n    for many years after his death.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE WRITER]\r\n\r\n    Such are the important facts of Pope's career. For the rest: he was\r\n    born in London, in the year of the Revolution (1688). Soon after\r\n    that date his father, having gained a modest fortune in the linen\r\n    business, retired to Binfield, on the fringe of Windsor Forest.\r\n    There Pope passed his boyhood, studying a little under private\r\n    tutors, forming a pleasurable acquaintance with Latin and Greek\r\n    poets. From fourteen to twenty, he tells us, he read for amusement;\r\n    but from twenty to twenty-seven he read for \"improvement and\r\n    instruction.\" The most significant traits of these early years were\r\n    his determination to be a poet and his talent for imitating any\r\n    writer who pleased him. Dryden was his first master, from whom he\r\n    inherited the couplet, then he imitated the French critic Boileau\r\n    and the Roman poet Horace. By the time he was twenty four the\r\n    publication of his _Essay on Criticism_ and _The Rape of the\r\n    Lock_ had made him the foremost poet of England. By his\r\n    translation of Homer he made a fortune, with which he bought a\r\n    villa at Twickenham. There he lived in the pale sunshine of\r\n    literary success, and there he quarreled with every writer who\r\n    failed to appreciate his verses, his jealousy overflowing at last\r\n    in _The Dunciad_ (Iliad of Dunces), a witty but venomous\r\n    lampoon, in which he took revenge on all who had angered him.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TWICKENHAM PARISH CHURCH, WHERE POPE WAS BURIED\r\n    Pope lived at Twickenham for nearly thirty years]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE MAN]\r\n\r\n    Next to his desire for glory and revenge, Pope loved to be\r\n    considered a man of high character, a teacher of moral philosophy.\r\n    His ethical teaching appears in his _Moral Epistles_, his\r\n    desire for a good reputation is written large in his Letters, which\r\n    he secretly printed, and then alleged that they had been made\r\n    public against his wish. These Letters might impress us as the\r\n    utterances of a man of noble ideals, magnanimous with his friends,\r\n    patient with his enemies, until we reflect that they were published\r\n    by the author for the purpose of giving precisely that impression.\r\n\r\n    Another side of Pope's nature is revealed in this: that to some of\r\n    his friends, to Swift and Bolingbroke for example, he showed\r\n    gratitude, and that to his parents he was ever a dutiful son. He\r\n    came perhaps as near as he could to a real rather than an\r\n    artificial sentiment when he wrote of his old mother:\r\n\r\n      Me let the tender office long engage,\r\n      To rock the cradle of reposing age.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF POPE. Pope's first important work, _An Essay on Criticism_\r\n(1711), is an echo of the rules which Horace had formulated in his _Ars\r\nPoetica_, more than seventeen centuries before Pope was born. The French\r\ncritic Boileau made an alleged improvement of Horace in his _L'Art\r\nPoétique_, and Pope imitated both writers with his rimed _Essay_,\r\nin which he attempted to sum up the rules by which poetry should be judged.\r\nAnd he did it, while still under the age of twenty-five, so brilliantly\r\nthat his characterization of the critic is unmatched in our literature. A\r\nfew selections will serve to show the character of the work:\r\n\r\n  First follow nature, and your judgment frame\r\n  By her just standard, which is still the same:\r\n  Unerring nature, still divinely bright,\r\n  One clear, unchanged and universal light,\r\n  Life, force and beauty must to all impart,\r\n  At once the source and end and test of Art.\r\n\r\n  Poets, like painters, thus unskilled to trace\r\n  The naked nature and the living grace,\r\n  With gold and jewels cover every part,\r\n  And hide with ornaments their want of art.\r\n  True wit is nature to advantage dressed,\r\n  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.\r\n\r\n  Expression is the dress of thought, and still\r\n  Appears more decent, as more suitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RAPE OF THE LOCK]\r\n\r\nPope's next important poem, _The Rape of the Lock_ (1712), is his most\r\noriginal and readable work. The occasion of the poem was that a fop stole a\r\nlock of hair from a young lady, and the theft plunged two families into a\r\nquarrel which was taken up by the fashionable set of London. Pope made a\r\nmock-heroic poem on the subject, in which he satirized the fads and\r\nfashions of Queen Anne's age. Ordinarily Pope's fancy is of small range,\r\nand proceeds jerkily, like the flight of a woodpecker, from couplet to\r\ncouplet; but here he attempts to soar like the eagle. He introduces dainty\r\naerial creatures, gnomes, sprites, sylphs, to combat for the belles and\r\nfops in their trivial concerns; and herein we see a clever burlesque of the\r\nold epic poems, in which gods or goddesses entered into the serious affairs\r\nof mortals. The craftsmanship of the poem is above praise; it is not only a\r\nneatly pointed satire on eighteenth-century fashions but is one of the most\r\ngraceful works in English verse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ESSAY OF MAN]\r\n\r\nAn excellent supplement to _The Rape of the Lock_, which pictures the\r\nsuperficial elegance of the age, is _An Essay on Man_, which reflects\r\nits philosophy. That philosophy under the general name of Deism, had\r\nfancied to abolish the Church and all revealed religion, and had set up a\r\nnew-old standard of natural faith and morals. Of this philosophy Pope had\r\nsmall knowledge; but he was well acquainted with the discredited\r\nBolingbroke, his \"guide, philosopher and friend,\" who was a fluent exponent\r\nof the new doctrine, and from Bolingbroke came the general scheme of the\r\n_Essay on Man_.\r\n\r\nThe poem appears in the form of four epistles, dealing with man's place in\r\nthe universe, with his moral nature, with social and political ethics, and\r\nwith the problem of happiness. These were discussed from a common-sense\r\nviewpoint, and with feet always on solid earth. As Pope declares:\r\n\r\n  Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;\r\n  The proper study of mankind is man....\r\n  Created half to rise, and half to fall;\r\n  Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;\r\n  Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled;\r\n  The glory, jest and riddle of the world.\r\n\r\nThroughout the poem these two doctrines of Deism are kept in sight: that\r\nthere is a God, a Mystery, who dwells apart from the world; and that man\r\nought to be contented, even happy, in his ignorance of matters beyond his\r\nhorizon:\r\n\r\n  All nature is but art, unknown to thee;\r\n  All chance, direction which thou canst not see;\r\n  All discord, harmony not understood;\r\n  All partial evil, universal good;\r\n  And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,\r\n  One truth is clear: whatever is, is right.\r\n\r\nThe result is rubbish, so far as philosophy is concerned, but in the heap\r\nof incongruous statements which Pope brings together are a large number of\r\nquotable lines, such as:\r\n\r\n  Honor and shame from no condition rise;\r\n  Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\r\n\r\nIt is because of such lines, the care with which the whole poem is\r\npolished, and the occasional appearance of real beauty (such as the passage\r\nbeginning, \"Lo, the poor Indian\") that the _Essay on Man_ occupies\r\nsuch a high place in eighteenth-century literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE QUALITY OF POPE]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to examine other works of Pope, since the poems\r\nalready named give us the full measure of his strength and weakness. His\r\ntalent is to formulate rules of poetry, to satirize fashionable society, to\r\nmake brilliant epigrams in faultless couplets. His failure to move or even\r\nto interest us greatly is due to his second-hand philosophy, his inability\r\nto feel or express emotion, his artificial life apart from nature and\r\nhumanity. When we read Chaucer or Shakespeare, we have the impression that\r\nthey would have been at home in any age or place, since they deal with\r\nhuman interests that are the same yesterday, to-day and forever; but we can\r\nhardly imagine Pope feeling at ease anywhere save in his own set and in his\r\nown generation. He is the poet of one period, which set great store by\r\nformality, and in that period alone he is supreme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SWIFT (1667-1745)\r\n\r\nIn the history of literature Swift occupies a large place as the most\r\npowerful of English satirists; that is, writers who search out the faults\r\nof society in order to hold them up to ridicule. To most readers, however,\r\nhe is known as the author of _Gulliver's Travels_, a book which young\r\npeople still read with pleasure, as they read _Robinson Crusoe_ or any\r\nother story of adventure. In the fate of that book, which was intended to\r\nscourge humanity but which has become a source of innocent entertainment,\r\nis a commentary on the colossal failure of Swift's ambition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JONATHAN SWIFT]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Little need be recorded of Swift's life beyond the few facts\r\n    which help us to understand his satires. He was born in Dublin, of\r\n    English parents, and was so \"bantered by fortune\" that he was\r\n    compelled to spend the greater part of his life in Ireland, a\r\n    country which he detested. He was very poor, very proud; and even\r\n    in youth he railed at a mocking fate which compelled him to accept\r\n    aid from others. For his education he was dependent on a relative,\r\n    who helped him grudgingly. After leaving Trinity College, Dublin,\r\n    the only employment he could find was with another relative, Sir\r\n    William Temple, a retired statesman, who hired Swift as a secretary\r\n    and treated him as a servant. Galled by his position and by his\r\n    feeling of superiority (for he was a man of physical and mental\r\n    power, who longed to be a master of great affairs) he took orders\r\n    in the Anglican Church; but the only appointment he could obtain\r\n    was in a village buried, as he said, in a forsaken district of\r\n    Ireland. There his bitterness overflowed in _A Tale of a Tub_\r\n    and a few pamphlets of such satiric power that certain political\r\n    leaders recognized Swift's value and summoned him to their\r\n    assistance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SWIFT IN LONDON]\r\n\r\n    To understand his success in London one must remember the times.\r\n    Politics were rampant; the city was the battleground of Whigs and\r\n    Tories, whose best weapon was the printed pamphlet that justified\r\n    one party by heaping abuse or ridicule on the other. Swift was a\r\n    master of satire, and he was soon the most feared author in\r\n    England. He seems to have had no fixed principles, for he was ready\r\n    to join the Tories when that party came into power and to turn his\r\n    literary cannon on the Whigs, whom he had recently supported. In\r\n    truth, he despised both parties; his chief object was to win for\r\n    himself the masterful position in Church or state for which, he\r\n    believed, his talents had fitted him.\r\n\r\n    For several years Swift was the literary champion of the victorious\r\n    Tories; then, when his keen eye detected signs of tottering in the\r\n    party, he asked for his reward. He obtained, not the great\r\n    bishopric which he expected, but an appointment as Dean of St.\r\n    Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. Small and bitter fruit this seemed\r\n    to Swift, after his years of service, but even so, it was given\r\n    grudgingly. [Footnote: Swift's pride and arrogance with his\r\n    official superiors worked against him. Also he had published _A\r\n    Tale of a Tub_, a coarse satire against the churches, which\r\n    scandalized the queen and her ministers, who could have given him\r\n    preferment. Thackeray says, \"I think the Bishops who advised Queen\r\n    Anne not to appoint the author of the _Tale of a Tub_ to a\r\n    Bishopric gave perfectly good advice.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LIFE IN IRELAND]\r\n\r\n    When the Tories went out of power Swift's political occupation was\r\n    gone. The last thirty years of his life were spent largely in\r\n    Dublin. There in a living grave, as he regarded it, the scorn which\r\n    he had hitherto felt for individuals or institutions widened until\r\n    it included humanity. Such is the meaning of his _Gulliver's\r\n    Travels_. His only pleasure during these years was to expose the\r\n    gullibility of men, and a hundred good stories are current of his\r\n    practical jokes,--such as his getting rid of a crowd which had\r\n    gathered to watch an eclipse by sending a solemn messenger to\r\n    announce that, by the Dean's orders, the eclipse was postponed till\r\n    the next day. A brain disease fastened upon him gradually, and his\r\n    last years were passed in a state of alternate stupor or madness\r\n    from which death was a blessed deliverance.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF SWIFT. The poems of Swift, though they show undoubted power (every\r\nsmallest thing he wrote bears that stamp), may be passed over with the\r\ncomment of his relative Dryden, who wrote: \"Cousin Swift, you will never be\r\na poet.\" The criticism was right, but thereafter Swift jeered at Dryden's\r\npoetry. We may pass over also the _Battle of the Books_, the\r\n_Drapier's Letters_ and a score more of satires and lampoons. Of all\r\nthese minor works the _Bickerstaff Papers_, which record Swift's\r\npractical joke on the astrologers, are most amusing. [Footnote: Almanacs\r\nwere at that time published by pretender astrologers, who read fortunes or\r\nmade predictions from the stars. Against the most famous of these quacks,\r\nPartridge by name, Swift leveled his \"Predictions for the year 1708, by\r\nIsaac Bickerstaff.\" Among the predictions of coming events was this trifle:\r\nthat Partridge was doomed to die on March 29 following, about eleven\r\no'clock at night, of a raging fever. On March 30 appeared, in the\r\nnewspapers, a letter giving the details of Partridge's death, and then a\r\npamphlet called \"An Elegy of Mr. Partridge.\" Presently Partridge, who could\r\nnot see the joke, made London laugh by his frantic attempts to prove that\r\nhe was alive. Then appeared an elaborate \"Vindication of Isaac\r\nBickerstaff,\" which proved by the infallible stars that Partridge was dead,\r\nand that the astrologer now in his place was an impostor. This joke was\r\ncopied twenty-five years later by Franklin in his _Poor Richard's\r\nAlmanac._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GULLIVER'S TRAVELS]\r\n\r\nSwift's fame now rests largely upon his _Gulliver's Travels_, which\r\nappeared in 1726 under the title, \"Travels into Several Remote Nations of\r\nthe World, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a Surgeon and then a Captain of\r\nSeveral Ships.\" In the first voyage we are taken to Lilliput, a country\r\ninhabited by human beings about six inches tall, with minds in proportion.\r\nThe capers of these midgets are a satire on human society, as seen through\r\nSwift's scornful eyes. In the second voyage we go to Brobdingnag, where the\r\npeople are of gigantic stature, and by contrast we are reminded of the\r\npetty \"human insects\" whom Gulliver represents. The third voyage, to the\r\nIsland of Laputa, is a burlesque of the scientists and philosophers of\r\nSwift's day. The fourth leads to the land of the Houyhnhnms, where\r\nintelligent horses are the ruling creatures, and humanity is represented by\r\nthe Yahoos, a horribly degraded race, having the forms of men and the\r\nbestial habits of monkeys.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ferocious satire on the elegant society of Queen Anne's day.\r\nFortunately for our peace of mind we can read the book for its grim humor\r\nand adventurous action, as we read any other good story. Indeed, it\r\nsurprises most readers of _Gulliver_ to be told that the work was\r\nintended to wreck our faith in humanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF SWIFT]\r\n\r\nIn all his satires Swift's power lies in his prose style--a convincing\r\nstyle, clear, graphic, straightforward--and in his marvelous ability to\r\nmake every scene, however distant or grotesque, as natural as life itself.\r\nAs Emerson said, he describes his characters as if for the police. His\r\nweakness is twofold: he has a fondness for coarse or malodorous references,\r\nand he is so beclouded in his own soul that he cannot see his fellows in a\r\ntrue light. In one of his early works he announced the purpose of all his\r\nwriting:\r\n\r\n  My hate, whose lash just Heaven has long decreed,\r\n  Shall on a day make Sin and Folly bleed.\r\n\r\nThat was written at twenty-six, before he took orders in the Church. As a\r\ntheological student it was certainly impressed upon the young man that\r\nHeaven keeps its own prerogatives, and that sin and folly have never been\r\neffectually reformed by lashing. But Swift had a scorn of all judgment\r\nexcept his own. As the eyes of fishes are so arranged that they see only\r\ntheir prey and their enemies, so Swift had eyes only for the vices of men\r\nand for the lash that scourges them. When he wrote, therefore, he was not\r\nan observer, or even a judge; he was a criminal lawyer prosecuting humanity\r\non the charge of being a sham. A tendency to insanity may possibly account\r\nboth for his spleen against others and for the self-tortures which made\r\nhim, as Archbishop King said, \"the most unhappy man on earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOURNAL TO STELLA]\r\n\r\nThere is one oasis in the bitter desert of Swift's writings, namely, his\r\n_Journal to Stella_. While in the employ of Temple he was the daily\r\ncompanion of a young girl, Esther Johnson, who was an inmate of the same\r\nhousehold. Her love for Swift was pure and constant; wherever he went she\r\nfollowed and lived near him, bringing a ray of sunshine into his life, in a\r\nspirit which reminds us of the sublime expression of another woman: \"For\r\nwhither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy\r\npeople shall be my people, and thy God my God.\" She was probably married to\r\nSwift, but his pride kept him from openly acknowledging the union. While he\r\nwas at London he wrote a private journal for Esther (Stella) in which he\r\nrecorded his impressions of the men and women he met, and of the political\r\nbattles in which he took part. That journal, filled with strange\r\nabbreviations to which only he and Stella had the key, can hardly be called\r\nliterature, but it is of profound interest. It gives us glimpses of a woman\r\nwho chose to live in the shadow; it shows the better side of Swift's\r\nnature, in contrast with his arrogance toward men and his brutal treatment\r\nof women; and finally, it often takes us behind the scenes of a stage on\r\nwhich was played a mixed comedy of politics and society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON (1672-1719)\r\n\r\nIn Addison we have a pleasant reflection of the new social life of England.\r\nSelect almost any feature of that life, and you shall find some account of\r\nit in the papers of Addison: its party politics in his _Whig\r\nExaminer_; its \"grand tour,\" as part of a gentleman's education, in his\r\n_Remarks on Italy_; its adventure on foreign soil in such poems as\r\n\"The Campaign\"; its new drama of decency in his _Cato_; its classic\r\ndelusions in his _Account of the Greatest English Poets_; its frills,\r\nfashions and similar matters in his _Spectator_ essays. He tried\r\nalmost every type of literature, from hymns to librettos, and in each he\r\nsucceeded well enough to be loudly applauded. In his own day he was\r\naccounted a master poet, but now he is remembered as a writer of prose\r\nessays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH ADDISON]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Addison's career offers an interesting contrast to that of\r\n    Swift, who lived in the same age. He was the son of an English\r\n    clergyman, settled in the deanery of Lichfield, and his early\r\n    training left upon him the stamp of good taste and good breeding.\r\n    In school he was always the model boy; in Oxford he wrote Latin\r\n    verses on safe subjects, in the approved fashion; in politics he\r\n    was content to \"oil the machine\" as he found it; in society he was\r\n    shy and silent (though naturally a brilliant talker) because he\r\n    feared to make some slip which might mar his prospects or the\r\n    dignity of his position.\r\n\r\n    A very discreet man was Addison, and the only failure he made of\r\n    discretion was when he married the Dowager Countess of Warwick,\r\n    went to live in her elegant Holland House, and lived unhappily ever\r\n    afterwards. The last is a mere formal expression. Addison had not\r\n    depth enough to be really unhappy. From the cold comfort of the\r\n    Dowager's palace he would slip off to his club or to Will's Coffee\r\n    house. There, with a pipe and a bottle, he would loosen his\r\n    eloquent tongue and proceed to \"make discreetly merry with a few\r\n    old friends.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MAGDALEN COLLEGE OXFORD]\r\n\r\n    His characteristic quality appears in the literary work which\r\n    followed his Latin verses. He began with a flattering \"Address to\r\n    Dryden,\" which pleased the old poet and brought Addison to the\r\n    attention of literary celebrities. His next effort was \"The Peace\r\n    of Ryswick,\" which flattered King William's statesmen and brought\r\n    the author a chance to serve the Whig party. Also it brought a\r\n    pension, with a suggestion that Addison should travel abroad and\r\n    learn French and diplomacy, which he did, to his great content, for\r\n    the space of three years.\r\n\r\n    The death of the king brought Addison back to England. His pension\r\n    stopped, and for a time he lived poorly \"in a garret,\" as one may\r\n    read in Thackeray's _Henry Esmond_. Then came news of an\r\n    English victory on the Continent (Marlborough's victory at\r\n    Blenheim), and the Whigs wanted to make political capital out of\r\n    the event. Addison was hunted up and engaged to write a poem. He\r\n    responded with \"The Campaign,\" which made him famous. Patriots and\r\n    politicians ascribed to the poem undying glory, and their judgment\r\n    was accepted by fashionable folk of London. To read it now is to\r\n    meet a formal, uninspired production, containing a few stock\r\n    quotations and, incidentally, a sad commentary on the union of\r\n    Whiggery and poetry.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS PATH OF ROSES]\r\n\r\n    From that moment Addison's success was assured. He was given\r\n    various offices of increasing importance; he entered Parliament; he\r\n    wrote a classic tragedy, _Cato_, which took London by storm\r\n    (his friend Steele had carefully \"packed the house\" for the first\r\n    performance); his essays in _The Spectator_ were discussed in\r\n    every fashionable club or drawing-room; he married a rich countess;\r\n    he was appointed Secretary of State. The path of politics, which\r\n    others find so narrow and slippery, was for Addison a broad road\r\n    through pleasant gardens. Meanwhile Swift, who could not follow the\r\n    Addisonian way of kindness and courtesy, was eating bitter bread\r\n    and railing at humanity.\r\n\r\n    After a brief experience as Secretary of State, finding that he\r\n    could not make the speeches expected of him, Addison retired on a\r\n    pension. His unwavering allegiance to good form in all matters\r\n    appears even in his last remark, \"See how a Christian can die.\"\r\n    That was in 1719. He had sought the easiest, pleasantest way\r\n    through life, and had found it. Thackeray, who was in sympathy with\r\n    such a career, summed it up in a glowing panegyric:\r\n\r\n        \"A life prosperous and beautiful, a calm death; an immense\r\n        fame and affection afterwards for his happy and spotless\r\n        name.\"\r\n\r\nWORKS OF ADDISON. Addison's great reputation was won chiefly by his poetry;\r\nbut with the exception of a few hymns, simple and devout, his poetical\r\nworks no longer appeal to us. He was not a poet but a verse-maker. His\r\nclassic tragedy _Cato_, for example (which met with such amazing\r\nsuccess in London that it was taken over to the Continent, where it was\r\nacclaimed \"a masterpiece of regularity and elegance\"), has some good\r\npassages, but one who reads the context is apt to find the elegant lines\r\nrunning together somewhat drowsily. Nor need that reflect on our taste or\r\nintelligence. Even the cultured Greeks, as if in anticipation of classic\r\npoems, built two adjoining temples, one dedicated to the Muses and the\r\nother to Sleep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ESSAYS]\r\n\r\nThe _Essays_ of Addison give us the full measure of his literary\r\ntalent. In his verse, as in his political works, he seems to be speaking to\r\nstrangers; he is on guard over his dignity as a poet, as Secretary of\r\nState, as husband of a countess; but in his _Essays_ we meet the man\r\nat his ease, fluent, witty, light-hearted but not frivolous,--just as he\r\ntalked to his friends in Will's Coffeehouse. The conversational quality of\r\nthese _Essays_ has influenced all subsequent works of the same\r\ntype,--a type hard to define, but which leaves the impression of pleasant\r\ntalk about a subject, as distinct from any learned discussion.\r\n\r\nThe _Essays_ cover a wide range: fashions, dress, manners, character\r\nsketches, letters of travel, ghost stories, satires on common vices,\r\nweek-end sermons on moral subjects. They are never profound, but they are\r\nalways pleasant, and their graceful style made such a lasting impression\r\nthat, half a century later, Dr. Johnson summed up a general judgment when\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n    \"Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not\r\n    coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and\r\n    nights to the volumes of Addison.\"\r\n\r\nADDISON AND STEELE. Of these two associates Richard Steele (1672-1729) had\r\nthe more original mind, and his writings reveal a warm, human sympathy that\r\nis lacking in the work of his more famous contemporary. But while Addison\r\ncultivated his one talent of writing, Steele was like Defoe in that he\r\nalways had some new project in his head, and some old debt urging him to\r\nput the project into immediate execution. He was in turn poet, political\r\npamphleteer, soldier, dramatist, member of Parliament, publisher, manager\r\nof a theater, following each occupation eagerly for a brief season, then\r\nabandoning it cheerfully for another,--much like a boy picking blueberries\r\nin a good place, who moves on and on to find a better bush, eats his\r\nberries on the way, and comes home at last with an empty pail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR RICHARD STEELE\r\nFrom the engraving by Freeman after original by J. Richardson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TATLER AND THE SPECTATOR]\r\n\r\nWhile holding the political office of \"gazetteer\" (one who had a monopoly\r\nof official news) the idea came to Steele of publishing a literary\r\nmagazine. The inventive Defoe had already issued _The Review_ (1704),\r\nbut that had a political origin. With the first number of _The Tatler_\r\n(1709) the modern magazine made its bow to the public. This little sheet,\r\npublished thrice a week and sold at a penny a copy, contained more or less\r\npolitics, to be sure, but the fact that it reflected the gossip of\r\ncoffeehouses made it instantly popular. After less than two years of\r\ntriumph Steele lost his official position, and _The Tatler_ was\r\ndiscontinued. The idea remained, however, and a few months later appeared\r\n_The Spectator_ (1711), a daily magazine which eschewed politics and\r\ndevoted itself to essays, reviews, letters, criticisms,--in short, to\r\n\"polite\" literature. Addison, who had been a contributor to _The\r\nTatler_ entered heartily into the new venture, which had a brief but\r\nglorious career. He became known as \"Mr. Spectator,\" and the famous\r\nSpectator Essays are still commonly attributed to him, though in truth\r\nSteele furnished a large part of them. [Footnote: Of the _Tatler_\r\nessays Addison contributed 42, Steele about 180, and some 36 were the work\r\nof the two authors in collaboration. Of the _Spectator_ essays Addison\r\nfurnished 274, Steele 236, and about 45 were the work of other writers. In\r\nsome of the best essays (\"Sir Roger de Coverley,\" for example) the two men\r\nworked together. Steele is supposed to have furnished the original ideas,\r\nthe humor and overflowing kindness of such essays, while the work of\r\npolishing and perfecting the style fell to the more skillful Addison.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADDISONIAN STYLE]\r\n\r\nBecause of their cultivated prose style, Steele and Addison were long\r\nregarded as models, and we are still influenced by them in the direction of\r\nclearness and grace of expression. How wide their influence extended may be\r\nseen in American literature. Hardly had _The Spectator_ appeared when\r\nit crossed the Atlantic and began to dominate our English style on both\r\nsides of the ocean. Franklin, in Boston, studied it by night in order to\r\nimitate it in the essay which he slipped under the printing-house door next\r\nmorning; and Boyd, in Virginia, reflects its influence in his charming\r\nJournal of exploration. Half a century later, the Hartford Wits were\r\nwriting clever sketches that seemed like the work of a new \"Spectator\";\r\nanother half century, and Irving, the greatest master of English prose in\r\nhis day, was still writing in the Addisonian manner, and regretting as he\r\nwrote that the leisurely style showed signs, in a bustling age, \"of\r\nbecoming a little old-fashioned.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. JOHNSON AND HIS CIRCLE\r\n\r\nSince Caxton established the king's English as a literary language our\r\nprose style has often followed the changing fashion of London. Thus, Lyly\r\nmade it fantastic, Dryden simplified it, Addison gave it grace; and each\r\nleader set a fashion which was followed by a host of young writers. Hardly\r\nhad the Addisonian style crossed the Atlantic, to be the model for American\r\nwriters for a century, when London acclaimed a new prose fashion--a\r\nponderous, grandiloquent fashion, characterized by mouth-filling words,\r\nantithetical sentences, rounded periods, sonorous commonplaces--which was\r\neagerly adopted by orators and historians especially. The man who did more\r\nthan any other to set this new oratorical fashion in motion was the same\r\nDr. Samuel Johnson who advised young writers to study Addison as a model.\r\nAnd that was only one of his amusing inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nJohnson was a man of power, who won a commanding place in English letters\r\nby his hard work and his downright sincerity. He won his name of \"the great\r\nlexicographer\" by his _Dictionary_, which we no longer consult, but\r\nwhich we remember as the first attempt at a complete English lexicon. If\r\none asks what else he wrote, with the idea of going to the library and\r\ngetting a book for pleasure, the answer must be that Johnson's voluminous\r\nworks are now as dead as his dictionary. One student of literature may be\r\ninterested in such a melancholy poem as \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\";\r\nanother will be entertained by the anecdotes or blunt criticisms of the\r\n_Lives of the Poets_; a third may be uplifted by the _Rambler\r\nEssays_, which are well called \"majestically moral productions\"; but we\r\nshall content ourselves here by recording Johnson's own refreshing\r\ncriticism of certain ancient authors, that \"it is idle to criticize what\r\nnobody reads.\" Perhaps the best thing he wrote was a minor work, which he\r\ndid not know would ever be published. This was his manly Letter to Lord\r\nChesterfield, a nobleman who had treated Johnson with discourtesy when the\r\npoor author was making a heroic struggle, but who offered his patronage\r\nwhen the Dictionary was announced as an epoch-making work. In his noble\r\nrefusal of all extraneous help Johnson unconsciously voiced Literature's\r\ndeclaration of independence: that henceforth a book must stand or fall on\r\nits own merits, and that the day of the literary patron was gone forever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON\r\nFrom the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The story of Johnson's life (1709-1784) has been so well told\r\n    that one is loath to attempt a summary of it. We note, therefore, a\r\n    few plain facts: that he was the son of a poor bookseller; that\r\n    despite poverty and disease he obtained his classic education; that\r\n    at twenty-six he came to London, and, after an experience with\r\n    patrons, rebelled against them; that he did every kind of hackwork\r\n    to earn his bread honestly, living in the very cellar of Grub\r\n    Street, where he was often cold and more often hungry; that after\r\n    nearly thirty years of labor his services to literature were\r\n    rewarded by a pension, which he shared with the poor; that he then\r\n    formed the Literary Club (including Reynolds, Pitt, Gibbon,\r\n    Goldsmith, Burke, and almost every other prominent man in London)\r\n    and indulged nightly in his famous \"conversations,\" which were\r\n    either monologues or knockdown arguments; and that in his old age\r\n    he was regarded as the king of letters, the oracle of literary\r\n    taste in England.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: DR. JOHNSON'S HOUSE (BOLT COURT, FLEET ST.)\r\n      From the print by Charles J. Smith]\r\n\r\n    Such is the bare outline of Johnson's career. To his character, his\r\n    rough exterior and his kind heart, his vast learning and his Tory\r\n    prejudices, his piety, his melancholy, his virtues, his frailty,\r\n    his \"mass of genuine manhood,\" only a volume could do justice.\r\n    Happily that volume is at hand. It is Boswell's _Life of\r\n    Johnson_, a famous book that deserves its fame.\r\n\r\nBOSWELL'S JOHNSON. Boswell was an inquisitive barrister who came from\r\nEdinburgh to London and thrust himself into the company of great men. To\r\nJohnson, then at the summit of his fame, \"Bozzy\" was devotion itself,\r\nfollowing his master about by day or night, refusing to be rebuffed,\r\njotting down notes of what he saw and heard. After Johnson's death he\r\ngathered these notes together and, after seven years of labor, produced his\r\nincomparable _Life of Johnson_ (1791).\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Boswell's work may be traced to two causes. First, he had\r\na great subject. The story of any human life is interesting, if truthfully\r\ntold, and Johnson's heroic life of labor and pain and reward was passed in\r\na capital city, among famous men, at a time which witnessed the rapid\r\nexpansion of a mighty empire. Second, Boswell was as faithful as a man\r\ncould be to his subject, for whom he had such admiration that even the\r\ndictator's frailties seemed more impressive than the virtues of ordinary\r\nhumanity. So Boswell concealed nothing, and felt no necessity to distribute\r\neither praise or blame. He portrayed a man just as that man was, recorded\r\nthe word just as the word was spoken; and facing the man we may see his\r\nenraptured audience,--at a distance, indeed, but marvelously clear, as when\r\nwe look through the larger end of a field glass at a landscape dominated by\r\na mountain. One who reads this matchless biography will know Johnson better\r\nthan he knows his own neighbor; he will gain, moreover, a better\r\nunderstanding of humanity, to reflect which clearly and truthfully is the\r\nprime object of all good literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Boswell]\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE (1729-1797). This brilliant Irishman came up to London as a\r\nyoung man of twenty-one. Within a few years--such was his character, his\r\neducation, his genius--he had won a reputation among old statesmen as a\r\npolitical philosopher. Then he entered Parliament, where for twenty years\r\nthe House listened with growing amazement to his rhythmic periods, and he\r\nwas acclaimed the most eloquent of orators.\r\n\r\nAmong Burke's numerous works those on America, India and France are\r\ndeservedly the most famous. Of his orations on American subjects a student\r\nof literature or history may profitably read \"On Taxation\" (1774) and \"On\r\nConciliation\" (1775), in which Burke presents the Whig argument in favor of\r\na liberal colonial policy. The Tory view of the same question was bluntly\r\npresented by Johnson in his essay \"Taxation No Tyranny\"; while like a\r\nreverberation from America, powerful enough to carry across the Atlantic,\r\ncame Thomas Paine's \"Common Sense,\" which was a ringing plea for colonial\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDMUND BURKE\r\nFrom the print by John Jones, after Romney]\r\n\r\nOf Burke's works pertaining to India \"The Nabob of Arcot's Debts\" (1785)\r\nand the \"Impeachment of Warren Hastings\" (1786) are interesting to those who\r\ncan enjoy a long flight of sustained eloquence. Here again Burke presents\r\nthe liberal, the humane view of what was then largely a political question;\r\nbut in his _Reflections on the French Revolution_ (1790) he goes over\r\nto the Tories, thunders against the revolutionists or their English\r\nsympathizers, and exalts the undying glories of the British constitution.\r\nThe _Reflections_ is the most brilliant of all Burke's works, and is\r\nadmired for its superb rhetorical style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BURKE'S METHOD]\r\n\r\nTo examine any of these works is to discover the author's characteristic\r\nmethod: first, his framework or argument is carefully constructed so as to\r\nappeal to reason; then this framework is buried out of sight and memory by\r\na mass of description, digression, emotional appeal, allusions,\r\nillustrative matter from the author's wide reading or from his prolific\r\nimagination. Note this passage from the _French Revolution_:\r\n\r\n    \"It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of\r\n    France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never\r\n    lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more\r\n    delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and\r\n    cheering the elevated sphere she had just begun to move in,\r\n    glittering like the morning star, full of life and splendor and\r\n    joy. Oh, what a revolution! And what a heart must I have to\r\n    contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little\r\n    did I dream, when she added titles of veneration to those of\r\n    distant, enthusiastic, respectful love, that she should ever be\r\n    obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in\r\n    that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such\r\n    disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation\r\n    of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords\r\n    must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that\r\n    threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone. That\r\n    of sophisters, economists and calculators has succeeded; and the\r\n    glory of Europe is extinguished for ever. Never, never more shall\r\n    we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud\r\n    submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the\r\n    heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an\r\n    exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of\r\n    nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is\r\n    gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of\r\n    honour, which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage\r\n    whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched,\r\n    and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its\r\n    grossness.\"\r\n\r\nThat is finely expressed, but it has no bearing on the political matter in\r\nquestion; namely, whether the sympathy of England should be extended to the\r\nFrench revolutionists in their struggle for liberty. This irrelevancy of\r\nBurke suggests our first criticism: that he is always eloquent, and usually\r\nright; but he is seldom convincing, and his eloquence is a hindrance rather\r\nthan a help to his main purpose. So we are not surprised to hear that his\r\neloquent speech on Conciliation emptied the benches; or that after his\r\nsupreme effort in the impeachment of Hastings--an effort so tremendously\r\ndramatic that spectators sobbed, screamed, were carried out in fits--the\r\nobject of all this invective was acquitted by his judges. Reading the works\r\nnow, they seem to us praiseworthy not for their sustained eloquence, which\r\nis wearisome, but for the brilliancy of certain detached passages which\r\ncatch the eye like sparkling raindrops after a drenching shower. It was the\r\nsplendor of such passages, their vivid imagery and harmonious rhythm, which\r\nled Matthew Arnold to assert that Burke was the greatest master of prose\r\nstyle in our literature. Anybody can make such an assertion; nobody can\r\nprove or disprove it.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORIANS. Perhaps it was the rapid expansion of the empire in the\r\nlatter, part of the eighteenth century which aroused such interest in\r\nhistorical subjects that works of history were then more eagerly welcomed\r\nthan poetry or fiction. Gibbon says in his _Memoirs_ that in his day\r\n\"history was the most popular species of composition.\" It was also the best\r\nrewarded; for while Johnson, the most renowned author of his time, wrote a\r\nromance (_Rasselas_) hoping to sell it for enough to pay for his\r\nmother's funeral, Robertson easily disposed of his _History of the\r\nEmperor Charles V_ for £4500; and there were others who were even better\r\npaid for popular histories, the very titles of which are now forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GIBBON]\r\n\r\nOf all the historical works of the age, and their name was legion, only one\r\nsurvives with something of its original vitality, standing the double test\r\nof time and scholarship. This is _The Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire_ (1776), a work which remained famous for a century, and which\r\nstill has its admiring readers. It was written by Edward Gibbon\r\n(1737-1794), who belonged to the Literary Club that gathered about Johnson,\r\nand who cultivated his style, he tells us, first by adopting the dictator's\r\nrounded periods, and then practicing them \"till they moved to flutes and\r\nhautboys.\"\r\n\r\nThe scope of Gibbon's work is enormous. It begins with the Emperor Trajan\r\n(A.D. 98) and carries us through the convulsions of a dying civilization,\r\nthe descent of the Barbarians on Rome, the spread of Christianity, the\r\nCrusades, the rise of Mohammedanism,--through all the confused history of\r\nthirteen centuries, ending with the capture of Constantinople by the Turks,\r\nin 1453. The mind that could grasp such vast and chaotic materials, arrange\r\nthem in orderly sequence and resent them as in a gorgeous panorama, moves\r\nus to wonder. To be sure, there are many things to criticize in Gibbon's\r\nmasterpiece,--the author's love of mere pageants; his materialism; his\r\ninability to understand religious movements, or even religious motives; his\r\nlifeless figures, which move as if by mechanical springs,--but one who\r\nreads the _Decline and Fall_ may be too much impressed by the\r\nevidences of scholarship, of vast labor, of genius even, to linger over\r\nfaults. It is a \"monumental\" work, most interesting to those who admire\r\nmonuments; and its style is the perfection of that oratorical, Johnsonese\r\nstyle which was popular in England in 1776, and which, half a century\r\nlater, found its best American mouthpiece in Daniel Webster. The influence\r\nof Gibbon may still be seen in the orators and historians who, lacking the\r\ncharm of simplicity, clothe even their platitudes in high-sounding phrases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD GIBBON\r\nFrom an enamel by H Bone, R.A.; after Sir Joshua Reynolds]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF ROMANTIC POETRY\r\n\r\nEvery age has had its romantic poets--that is, poets who sing the dreams\r\nand ideals of life, and whose songs seem to be written naturally,\r\nspontaneously, as from a full heart [Footnote: For specific examples of\r\nformal and romantic poetry see the comparison between Addison and\r\nWordsworth below, under \"Natural vs Formal Poetry\", Chapter VII]--but in\r\nthe eighteenth century they were completely overshadowed by formal\r\nversifiers who made poetry by rule. At that time the imaginative verse\r\nwhich had delighted an earlier age was regarded much as we now regard an\r\nold beaver hat; Shakespeare and Milton were neglected, Spenser was but a\r\nname, Chaucer was clean forgotten. If a poet aspired to fame, he imitated\r\nthe couplets of Dryden or Pope, who, as Cowper said,\r\n\r\n  Made poetry a mere mechanic art,\r\n  And every warbler has his tune by heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GRAY\r\nfrom a portrait by Benjamin Wilson, in the possession of John Murray]\r\n\r\nAmong those who made vigorous protest against the precise and dreary\r\nformalism of the age were Collins and Gray, whose names are commonly\r\nassociated in poetry, as are the names of Addison and Steele in prose. They\r\nhad the same tastes, the same gentle melancholy, the same freedom from the\r\nbondage of literary fashion. Of the two, William Collins (1721-1759) was\r\nperhaps the more gifted poet. His exquisite \"Ode to Evening\" is without a\r\nrival in its own field, and his brief elegy beginning, \"How sleep the\r\nbrave,\" is a worthy commemoration of a soldier's death and a nation's\r\ngratitude. It has, says Andrew Lang, the magic of an elder day and of all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThomas Gray (1716-1771) is more widely known than his fellow poet, largely\r\nbecause of one fortunate poem which \"returned to men's bosoms\" as if sure\r\nof its place and welcome. This is the \"Elegy Written in a Country\r\nChurchyard\" (1750), which has been translated into all civilized tongues,\r\nand which is known, loved, quoted wherever English is spoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOKE POGES CHURCHYARD, SHOWING PART OF THE CHURCH AND\r\nGRAY'S TOMB]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRAY'S ELEGY]\r\n\r\nTo criticize this favorite of a million readers seems almost ruthless, as\r\nif one were pulling a flower to pieces for the sake of giving it a\r\nbotanical name. A pleasanter task is to explain, if one can, the immense\r\npopularity of the \"Elegy.\" The theme is of profound interest to every man\r\nwho reveres the last resting place of his parents, to the nation which\r\ncherishes every monument of its founders, and even to primitive peoples,\r\nlike the Indians, who refuse to leave the place where their fathers are\r\nburied, and who make the grave a symbol of patriotism. With this great\r\ntheme our poet is in perfect sympathy. His attitude is simple and reverent;\r\nhe treads softly, as if on holy ground. The natural setting or atmosphere\r\nof his poem, the peace of evening falling on the old churchyard at Stoke\r\nPoges, the curfew bell, the cessation of daily toil, the hush which falls\r\nupon the twilight landscape like a summons to prayer,--all this is exactly\r\nas it should be. Finally, Gray's craftsmanship, his choice of words, his\r\nsimple figures, his careful fitting of every line to its place and context,\r\nis as near perfection as human skill could make it.\r\n\r\nOther poems of Gray, which make his little book precious, are the four\r\nodes: \"To Spring,\" \"On a Distant Prospect of Eton College,\" \"The Progress\r\nof Poesy\" and \"The Bard,\" the last named being a description of the\r\ndramatic end of an old Welsh minstrel, who chants a wild prophecy as he\r\ngoes to his death. These romantic odes, together with certain translations\r\nwhich Gray made from Norse mythology, mark the end of \"classic\" domination\r\nin English poetry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH (1728-1774)\r\n\r\nMost versatile of eighteenth-century writers was \"poor Noll,\" a most\r\nimprovident kind of man in all worldly ways, but so skillful with his pen\r\nthat Johnson wrote a sincere epitaph to the effect that Goldsmith attempted\r\nevery form of literature, and adorned everything which he attempted. The\r\nform of his verse suggests the formal school, and his polished couplets\r\nrival those of Pope; but there the resemblance ceases. In his tenderness\r\nand humor, in his homely subjects and the warm human sympathy with which he\r\ndescribes them, Goldsmith belongs to the new romantic school of poetry.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The life of Goldsmith has inspired many pens; but the\r\n    subject, far from being exhausted, is still awaiting the right\r\n    biographer. The poet's youthful escapades in the Irish country, his\r\n    classical education at Trinity College, Dublin, and his vagabond\r\n    studies among gypsies and peddlers, his childish attempts at\r\n    various professions, his wanderings over Europe, his shifts and\r\n    makeshifts to earn a living in London, his tilts with Johnson at\r\n    the Literary Club, his love of gorgeous raiment, his indiscriminate\r\n    charity, his poverty, his simplicity, his success in the art of\r\n    writing and his total failure in the art of living,--such\r\n    kaleidoscopic elements make a brief biography impossible. The\r\n    character of the man appears in a single incident.\r\n\r\n    Landing one day on the Continent with a flute, a spare shirt and a\r\n    guinea as his sole outward possessions, the guinea went for a feast\r\n    and a game of cards at the nearest inn, and the shirt to the first\r\n    beggar that asked for it. There remained only the flute, and with\r\n    that Goldsmith fared forth confidently, like the gleeman of old\r\n    with his harp, delighted at seeing the world, utterly forgetful of\r\n    the fact that he had crossed the Channel in search of a medical\r\n    education.\r\n\r\n    That aimless, happy-go-lucky journey was typical of Goldsmith's\r\n    whole life of forty-odd years. Those who knew him loved but\r\n    despaired of him. When he passed away (1774) Johnson summed up the\r\n    feeling of the English literary world in the sentence, \"He was a\r\n    very great man, let not his frailties be remembered.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVER GOLDSMITH\r\nAfter the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds]\r\n\r\nGOLDSMITH'S PROSE AND VERSE. Among the forgotten works of Goldsmith we note\r\nwith interest several that he wrote for children: a fanciful _History of\r\nEngland_, an entertaining but most unreliable _Animated Nature_,\r\nand probably also the tale of \"Little Goody Twoshoes.\" These were written\r\n(as were all his other works) to satisfy the demands of his landlady, or to\r\npay an old debt, or to buy a new cloak,--a plum-colored velvet cloak,\r\nwherewith to appear at the opera or to dazzle the Literary Club. From among\r\nhis works we select four, as illustrative of Goldsmith's versatility.\r\n\r\n_The Citizen of the World_, a series of letters from an alleged\r\nChinese visitor, invites comparison with the essays of Addison or Steele.\r\nAll three writers are satirical, all have a high moral purpose, all are\r\nmasters of a graceful style, but where the \"Spectator\" touches the surface\r\nof life, Goldsmith often goes deeper and probes the very spirit of the\r\neighteenth century. Here is a paragraph from the first letter, in which the\r\nalleged visitor, who has heard much of the wealth and culture of London,\r\nsets down his first impressions:\r\n\r\n    \"From these circumstances in their buildings, and from the dismal\r\n    looks of the inhabitants, I am induced to conclude that the nation\r\n    is actually poor, and that, like the Persians, they make a splendid\r\n    figure everywhere but at home. The proverb of Xixofou is, that a\r\n    man's riches may be seen in his eyes if we judge of the English by\r\n    this rule, there is not a poorer nation under the sun.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"CHESHIRE CHEESE,\" LONDON, SHOWING DR. JOHNSON'S FAVORITE\r\nSEAT The tavern, which still stands, was the favorite haunt of both Johnson\r\nand Goldsmith]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DESERTED VILLAGE]\r\n\r\n_The Deserted Village_ (1770) is the best remembered of Goldsmith's\r\npoems, or perhaps one should say \"verses\" in deference to critics like\r\nMatthew Arnold who classify the work with Pope's _Essay on Man_, as a\r\nrimed dissertation rather than a true poem.\r\n\r\nTo compare the two works just mentioned is to discover how far Goldsmith is\r\nfrom his formal model. In Pope's \"Essay\" we find common sense, moral maxims\r\nand some alleged philosophy, but no emotion, no romance, no men or women.\r\nThe \"Village,\" on the other hand, is romantic even in desolation; it\r\nawakens our interest, our sympathy; and it gives us two characters, the\r\nParson and the Schoolmaster, who live in our memories with the best of\r\nChaucer's creations. Moreover, it makes the commonplace life of man ideal\r\nand beautiful, and so appeals to readers of widely different tastes or\r\nnationalities. Of the many ambitious poems written in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the two most widely read (aside from the songs of Burns) are\r\nGoldsmith's \"Village,\" which portrays the life of simple country people,\r\nand Gray's \"Elegy,\" which laments their death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANONBURY TOWER (LONDON)\r\nGoldsmith lived here when he wrote the \"Vicar of Wakefield\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VICAR OF WAKEFIELD]\r\n\r\nGoldsmith's one novel, _The Vicar of Wakefield_ (1766), has been well\r\ncalled \"the Prince Charming\" of our early works of fiction. This work has a\r\nthreefold distinction: its style alone is enough to make it pleasant\r\nreading; as a story it retains much of its original charm, after a century\r\nand a half of proving; by its moral purity it offered the best kind of\r\nrebuke to the vulgar tendency of the early English novel, and influenced\r\nsubsequent fiction in the direction of cleanness and decency.\r\n\r\nThe story is that of a certain vicar, or clergyman, Dr. Primrose and his\r\nfamily, who pass through heavy trials and misfortunes. These might crush or\r\nembitter an ordinary man, but they only serve to make the Vicar's love for\r\nhis children, his trust in God, his tenderness for humanity, shine out more\r\nclearly, like star's after a tempest. Mingled with these affecting trials\r\nare many droll situations which probably reflect something of the author's\r\npersonal escapades; for Goldsmith was the son of a clergyman, and brought\r\nhimself and his father into his tale. As a novel, that is, a reflection of\r\nhuman life in the form of a story, it contains many weaknesses; but despite\r\nits faults of moralizing and sentimentality, the impression which the story\r\nleaves is one of \"sweetness and light.\" Swinburne says that, of all novels\r\nhe had seen rise and fall in three generations, _The Vicar of\r\nWakefield_ alone had retained the same high level in the opinion of its\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER]\r\n\r\nAnother notable work is Goldsmith's comedy _She Stoops to Conquer_. The\r\ndate of that comedy (1773) recalls the fact that, though it has been played\r\nfor nearly a century and a half, during which a thousand popular plays have\r\nbeen forgotten, it is still a prime favorite on the amateur stage. Perhaps\r\nthe only other comedies of which the same can be said with approximate\r\ntruth are _The Rivals_ (1775) and _The School for Scandal_ (1777)\r\nof Richard Brinsley Sheridan.\r\n\r\nThe plot of _She Stoops to Conquer_ is said to have been suggested by\r\none of Goldsmith's queer adventures. He arrived one day at a village,\r\nriding a borrowed nag, and with the air of a lordly traveler asked a\r\nstranger to direct him \"to the best house in the place.\" The stranger\r\nmisunderstood, or else was a rare wag, for he showed the way to the abode\r\nof a wealthy gentleman. There Goldsmith made himself at home, ordered the\r\nservants about, invited his host to share a bottle of wine,--in short, made\r\na great fool of himself. Evidently the host was also a wag, for he let the\r\njoke run on till the victim was ready to ride away. [Footnote: There is\r\nsome doubt as to the source of Goldsmith's plot. It may have been suggested\r\nby an earlier French comedy by Marivaux.]\r\n\r\nFrom some such crazy escapade Goldsmith made his comedy of manners, a\r\nlively, rollicking comedy of topsy-turvy scenes, all hinging upon the\r\nincident of mistaking a private house for a public inn. We have called\r\n_She Stoops to Conquer_ a comedy of eighteenth-century manners, but\r\nour continued interest in its absurdities would seem to indicate that it is\r\na comedy of human nature in all ages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS (1759-1796)\r\n\r\nBurns is everywhere acclaimed the poet of Scotland, and for two good\r\nreasons: because he reflects better than any other the emotions of the\r\nScottish people, and because his book is a summary of the best verse of his\r\nnative land. Practically all his songs, such as \"Bonnie Boon\" and \"Auld\r\nLang Syne,\" are late echoes of much older verses; his more ambitious poems\r\nborrow their ideas, their satire or sentiment, their form even, from\r\nFerguson, Allan Ramsay and other poets, all of whom aimed (as Scott aimed\r\nin \"Lochinvar\") to preserve the work of unnamed minstrels whose lines had\r\nbeen repeated in Highlands or Lowlands for two centuries. Burns may be\r\nregarded, therefore, as a treasury of all that is best in Scottish song.\r\nHis genius was to take this old material, dear to the heart of the native,\r\nand give it final expression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT BURNS\r\nAfter Alexander Nasmyth]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The life of Burns is one to discourage a biographer who does\r\n    not relish the alternative of either concealing the facts or\r\n    apologizing for his subject. We shall record here only a few\r\n    personal matters which may help us to understand Burns's poetry.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the most potent influence in his life was that which came\r\n    from his labor in the field. He was born in a clay biggin, or\r\n    cottage, in the parish of Alloway, near the little town of Ayr.\r\n\r\n      Auld Ayr, wham neer a town surpasses\r\n      For honest men and bonnie lasses.\r\n\r\n    His father was a poor crofter, a hard working, God fearing man of\r\n    the Covenanter type, who labored unceasingly to earn a living from\r\n    the soil of a rented farm. The children went barefoot in all\r\n    seasons, almost from the time they could walk they were expected to\r\n    labor and at thirteen Bobbie was doing a man's work at the plow or\r\n    the reaping. The toil was severe, the reward, at best, was to\r\n    escape dire poverty or disgraceful debt, but there was yet a\r\n    nobility in the life which is finely reflected in \"The Cotter's\r\n    Saturday Night,\" a poem which ranks with Whittier's \"Snow Bound\"\r\n    among the best that labor has ever inspired.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"ELLISLAND\"\r\n    The hundred acre farm near Dumfries where Burns worked as a farmer.\r\n    The happiest days of his life were spent here, 1787-1791]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE ELEMENT OF NATURE]\r\n\r\n    As a farmer's boy Burns worked in the open, in close contact with\r\n    nature, and the result is evident in all his verse. Sunshine or\r\n    storm, bird song or winter wind, the flowers, the stars, the dew of\r\n    the morning,--open Burns where you will, and you are face to face\r\n    with these elemental realities. Sometimes his reflection of nature\r\n    is exquisitely tender, as in \"To a Mouse\" or \"To a Mountain Daisy\";\r\n    but for the most part he regards nature not sentimentally, like\r\n    Gray, or religiously, like Wordsworth and Bryant, but in a breezy,\r\n    companionable way which suggests the song of \"Under the Greenwood\r\n    Tree\" in _As You Like It_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS EDUCATION]\r\n\r\n    Another influence in Burns's life came from his elementary\r\n    education. There were no ancient classics studied in the school\r\n    which he attended,--fortunately, perhaps, for his best work is free\r\n    from the outworn classical allusions which decorate the bulk of\r\n    eighteenth-century verse. In the evening he listened to tales from\r\n    Scottish history, which stirred him deeply and made him live in a\r\n    present world rather than in the misty region of Greek mythology.\r\n    One result of this education was the downright honesty of Burns's\r\n    poems. Here is no echo from a vanished world of gods and goddesses,\r\n    but the voice of a man, living, working, feeling joy or sorrow in\r\n    the presence of everyday nature and humanity.\r\n\r\n    For another formative influence Burns was indebted to Betty\r\n    Davidson, a relative and an inmate of the household, who carried\r\n    such a stock of old wives' tales as would scare any child into fits\r\n    on a dark night. Hear Burns speak of her:\r\n\r\n        \"She had, I suppose, the largest collection in the country\r\n        of tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,\r\n        brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies,\r\n        elf-candles, dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantrips,\r\n        giants, enchanted towers, dragons, and other trumpery. This\r\n        cultivated the latent seeds of poetry, but had so strong an\r\n        effect upon my imagination that to this hour, in my\r\n        nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a sharp look-out in\r\n        suspicious places.\"\r\n\r\n    Reflections of these grotesque superstitions appear in such poems\r\n    as the \"Address to the Deil\" and \"Tam o' Shanter.\" The latter is\r\n    commonly named as one of the few original works of Burns, but it is\r\n    probably a retelling of some old witch-tale of Betty Davidson.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: EVIL ELEMENTS]\r\n\r\n    The evil influence in Burns's life may be only suggested. It leads\r\n    first to the tavern, to roistering and dissipation, to\r\n    entanglements in vulgar love affairs; then swiftly to the loss of a\r\n    splendid poetic gift, to hopeless debts, to degrading poverty, to\r\n    an untimely death. Burns had his chance, if ever poet had it, after\r\n    the publication of his first book (the famous Kilmarnock edition of\r\n    1786) when he was called in triumph to Edinburgh. There he sold\r\n    another edition of his poems for a sum that seemed fabulous to a\r\n    poor crofter; whereupon he bought a farm and married his Jean\r\n    Armour. He was acclaimed throughout the length and breadth of his\r\n    native land, his poems were read by the wise and by the ignorant,\r\n    he was the poet of Scotland, and the nation, proud of its gifted\r\n    son, stood ready to honor and follow him. But the old habits were\r\n    too strong, and Burns took the downhill road. To this element of\r\n    dissipation we owe his occasional bitterness, railing and\r\n    coarseness, which make an expurgated edition of his poems essential\r\n    to one who would enjoy the reading.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE VILLAGE OF TARBOLTON, NEAR WHICH BURNS LIVED\r\n    WHEN ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OLD]\r\n\r\n    There is another element, often emphasized for its alleged\r\n    influence on Burns's poetry. During his lifetime the political\r\n    world was shaken by the American and French revolutions, democracy\r\n    was in the air, and the watchwords \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\"\r\n    inspired many a song besides the _Marseillaise_ and many a\r\n    document besides the Declaration of Independence. That Burns was\r\n    aware of this political commotion is true, but he was not much\r\n    influenced by it. He was at home only in his own Scottish field,\r\n    and even there his interests were limited,--not to be compared with\r\n    those of Walter Scott, for example. When the Bastille was stormed,\r\n    and the world stood aghast, Burns was too much engrossed in\r\n    personal matters to be greatly moved by distant affairs in France.\r\n    Not to the Revolution, therefore, but to his Scottish blood do we\r\n    owe the thrilling \"Scots Wha Hae,\" one of the world's best battle\r\n    songs, not to the new spirit of democracy abroad but to the old\r\n    Covenanter spirit at home do we owe \"A Man's a Man for a' That\"\r\n    with its assertion of elemental manhood.\r\n\r\nTHE SONGS OF BURNS. From such an analysis of Burns's life one may forecast\r\nhis subject and his method. Living intensely in a small field, he must\r\ndiscover that there are just two poetic subjects of abiding interest. These\r\nare Nature and Humanity, and of these Burns must write from first-hand\r\nknowledge, simply, straightforwardly, and with sincerity. Moreover, as\r\nBurns lives in an intense way, reading himself rather than books, he must\r\ndiscover that the ordinary man is more swayed by strong feeling than by\r\nlogical reasons. He will write, therefore, of the common emotions that lie\r\nbetween the extremes of laughter and tears, and his appeal will be to the\r\nheart rather than to the head of his reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AULD ALLOWAY KIRK\r\nMade famous by the poem of \"Tam o'Shanter\"]\r\n\r\nThis emotional power of Burns, his masterful touch upon human heartstrings,\r\nis the first of his poetic qualities; and he has others which fairly force\r\nthemselves upon the attention. For example, many of his lyrics (\"Auld Lang\r\nSyne,\" \"Banks o' Doon,\" \"Flow Gently, Sweet Afton,\" \"O Wert Thou in the\r\nCauld Blast\") have been repeatedly set to music; and the reason is that\r\nthey were written to music, that in such poems Burns was refashioning some\r\nold material to the tune of a Scottish song. There is a singing quality in\r\nhis poetry which not only makes it pleasant reading but which is apt to set\r\nthe words tripping to melody. For a specific example take this stanza from\r\n\"Of a' the Airts,\" a lyric which one can hardly read without making a tune\r\nto match it:\r\n\r\n  I see her in the dewy flow'rs,\r\n    I see her sweet and fair;\r\n  I hear her in the tunefu' birds,\r\n    I hear her charm the air:\r\n  There's not a bonie flow'r that springs\r\n    By fountain, shaw or green,\r\n  There's not a bonie bird that sings,\r\n    But minds me o' my Jean.\r\n\r\nSympathy is another marked characteristic of Burns, a wide, all-embracing\r\nsympathy that knows no limit save for hypocrites, at whom he pointed his\r\nkeenest satire. His feeling for nature is reflected in \"To a Mouse\" and \"To\r\na Daisy\"; his comradeship with noble men appears in \"The Cotter's Saturday\r\nNight,\" with riotous and bibulous men in \"The Jolly Beggars,\" with\r\nsmugglers and their ilk in \"The Deil's Awa' with the Exciseman,\" [Footnote:\r\nBurns was himself an exciseman; that is, a collector of taxes on alcoholic\r\nliquors. He wrote this song while watching a smuggler's craft, and waiting\r\nin the storm for officers to come and make an arrest.] with patriots in\r\n\"Bannockburn,\" with men who mourn in \"To Mary in Heaven,\" and with all\r\nlovers in a score of famous lyrics. Side by side with Burns's sympathy (for\r\nSmiles live next door to Tears) appears his keen sense of humor, a humor\r\nthat is sometimes rollicking, as in \"Contented wi' Little,\" and again too\r\nbroad for decency. For the most part, however, Burns contents himself with\r\ndry, quiet sarcasm delivered with an air of great seriousness:\r\n\r\n  Ah, gentle dames, it gars me greet\r\n  To think how mony counsels sweet,\r\n  How mony lengthened sage advices\r\n  The husband frae the wife despises!\r\n\r\nWHY BURNS IS READ. Such qualities, appearing on almost every page of\r\nBurns's little book of poetry, show how widely he differs from the formal\r\nschool of Pope and Dryden. They labor to compose poetry, while Burns gives\r\nthe impression of singing, as naturally as a child sings from a full heart.\r\nAgain, most eighteenth-century poets wrote for the favored few, but Burns\r\nwrote for all his neighbors. His first book was bought farmers, plowboys,\r\nmilkmaids,--by every Lowlander who could scrape together three shillings to\r\nbuy a treasure. Then scholars got hold of it, taking it from humble hands,\r\nand Burns was called to Edinburgh to prepare a larger edition of his songs.\r\nFor a half century Scotland kept him to herself, [Footnote: Up to 1850\r\nBurns was rarely mentioned in treatises on English literature. One reason\r\nfor his late recognition was that the Lowland vocabulary employed in most\r\nof his poems was only half intelligible to the ordinary English reader]\r\nthen his work went wide in the world, to be read again by plain men and\r\nwomen, by sailors on the sea, by soldiers round the campfire, by farmers,\r\nmechanics, tradesmen, who in their new homes in Australia or America warmed\r\nthemselves at the divine fire which was kindled, long ago, in the little\r\nclay biggin at Alloway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNS'S MAUSOLEUM]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GENIUS OF BURNS]\r\n\r\nIf one should ask, Why this world wide welcome to Burns, the while Pope\r\nremains a mark for literary criticism? the answer is that Burns has a most\r\nextraordinary power of touching the hearts of common men. He is one of the\r\nmost democratic of poets, he takes for his subject a simple experience--a\r\nfamily gathering at eventide, a fair, a merrymaking, a joy, a grief, the\r\nfinding of a flower, the love of a lad for a lass--and with rare simplicity\r\nreflects the emotion that such an experience awakens. Seen through the\r\npoet's eyes, this simple emotion becomes radiant and lovely, a thing not of\r\nearth but of heaven. That is the genius of Burns, to ennoble human feeling,\r\nto reveal some hidden beauty in a commonplace experience. The luminous\r\nworld of fine thought and fine emotion which we associate with the name of\r\npoetry he opened not to scholars alone but to all humble folk who toil and\r\nendure. As a shoemaker critic once said, \"Burns confirms my former\r\nsuspicion that the world was made for me as well as for Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMINOR POETS OF ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\nThere were other poets who aided in the romantic revival, and among them\r\nWilliam Cowper (1731-1800) is one of the most notable. His most ambitious\r\nworks, such as _The Task_ and the translation of Homer into blank\r\nverse, have fallen into neglect, and he is known to modern readers chiefly\r\nby a few familiar hymns and by the ballad of \"John Gilpin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM COWPER\r\nFrom the rare engraving by W Blake (1802) After the painting by T\r\nLawrence, R A (1793)]\r\n\r\nLess gifted but more popular than Cowper was James Macpherson (1736-1796),\r\nwho made a sensation that spread rapidly over Europe and America with his\r\n_Fingal_ (1762) and other works of the same kind,--wildly heroic poems\r\nwhich, he alleged, were translations from Celtic manuscripts written by an\r\nancient bard named Ossian. Another and better literary forgery appeared in\r\na series of ballads called _The Rowley Papers_, dealing with medieval\r\nthemes. These were written by \"the marvelous boy\" Thomas Chatterton\r\n(1752-1770), who professed to have found the poems in a chest of old\r\nmanuscripts. The success of these forgeries, especially of the \"Ossian\"\r\npoems, is an indication of the awakened interest in medieval poetry and\r\nlegend which characterized the whole romantic movement.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, Thomas Percy (1729-1811) did a notable work when he\r\npublished, after years of research, his _Reliques of Ancient English\r\nPoetry_ (1765). This was a collection of old ballads, which profoundly\r\ninfluenced Walter Scott, and which established a foundation for all later\r\nworks of balladry.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting figure in the romantic revival is William Blake\r\n(1757-1827), a strange, mystic child, a veritable John o' Dreams, whom some\r\ncall madman because of his huge, chaotic, unintelligible poems, but whom\r\nothers regard as the supreme poetical genius of the eighteenth century. His\r\nonly readable works are the boyish _Poetical Sketches_ (1783) and two\r\nlater volumes called _Songs of Innocence_ and _Songs of\r\nExperience_ (1794). Even these contain much to make us question Blake's\r\nsanity; but they contain also a few lyrics that might have been written by\r\nan elf rather than a man,--beautiful, elusive lyrics that haunt us like a\r\nstrain of gypsy music, a memory of childhood, a bird song in the night:\r\n\r\n  Can the eagle see what is in the pit,\r\n    Or wilt thou go ask the mole?\r\n  Can wisdom be put in a silver rod,\r\n    Or love in a golden bowl?\r\n\r\nIn the witchery of these lyrics eighteenth-century poetry appears\r\ncommonplace; but they attracted no attention, even \"Holy Thursday,\" the\r\nsweetest song of poor children ever written, passing unnoticed. That did\r\nnot trouble Blake, however, who cared nothing for rewards. He was a\r\nchildlike soul, well content\r\n\r\n  To see the world in a grain of sand,\r\n    And a heaven in a wild flower;\r\n  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,\r\n    And eternity in an hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY ENGLISH NOVEL\r\n\r\nAn important literary event of the eighteenth century was the appearance of\r\nthe modern novel. This invention, generally credited to the English,\r\ndiffers radically from the old romance, which was known to all civilized\r\npeoples. Walter Scott made the following distinction between the two types\r\nof fiction: the romance is a story in which our interest centers in\r\nmarvelous incidents, brought to pass by extraordinary or superhuman\r\ncharacters; the novel is a story which is more natural, more in harmony\r\nwith our experience of life. Such a definition, though faulty, is valuable\r\nin that it points to the element of imagination as the distinguishing mark\r\nbetween the romance and the true novel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ROMANCE]\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the romances of Arthur or Sindbad or the Green Knight.\r\nHere are heroes of more than human endurance, ladies of surpassing\r\nloveliness, giants, dragons, enchanters, marvelous adventures in the land\r\nof imagination. Such fanciful stories, valuable as a reflection of the\r\nideals of different races, reached their highest point in the Middle Ages,\r\nwhen they were used to convey the ideals of chivalry and knightly duty.\r\nThey grew more fantastic as they ran to seed, till in the Elizabethan age\r\nthey had degenerated into picaresque stories (from _picaro_, \"a\r\nrogue\") which recounted the adventures not of a noble knight but of some\r\nscoundrel or outcast. They were finally laughed out of literature in\r\nnumerous burlesques, of which the most famous is _Don Quixote_ (1605).\r\nIn the humor of this story, in the hero's fighting windmills and meeting so\r\nmany adventures that he had no time to breathe, we have an excellent\r\ncriticism not of chivalry, as is sometimes alleged, but of extravagant\r\npopular romances on the subject. [Footnote: _Don Quixote_ is commonly\r\nnamed as a type of extravagant humor, but from another viewpoint it is a\r\nsad book, intensely sad. For it recounts the experience of a man who had a\r\nknightly heart and who believed the world to be governed by knightly\r\nideals, but who went forth to find a world filled with vulgarity and\r\nvillainy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NOVEL]\r\n\r\nCompare now these old romances with _Ivanhoe_ or _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_ or _Lorna Doone_ or _A Tale of Two Cities_. In each of\r\nthe last-named novels one may find three elements: a story, a study, and an\r\nexercise of the creative imagination. A modern work of fiction must still\r\nhave a good story, if anybody is to read it; must contain also a study or\r\nobservation of humanity, not of superhuman heroes but of men and women who\r\nwork or play or worship in close relationship to their fellows. Finally,\r\nthe story and the study must be fused by the imagination, which selects or\r\ncreates various scenes, characters, incidents, and which orders or arranges\r\nits materials so as to make a harmonious work that appeals to our sense of\r\ntruth and beauty; in other words, a work of art.\r\n\r\nSuch is the real novel, a well-told story in tune with human experience,\r\nholding true to life, exercising fancy but keeping it under control,\r\narousing thought as well as feeling, and appealing to our intellect as well\r\nas to our imagination. [Footnote: This convenient division of prose fiction\r\ninto romances and novels is open to challenge. Some critics use the name\r\n\"novel\" for any work of prose fiction. They divide novels into two classes,\r\nstories (or short stories) and romances. The story relates simple or\r\ndetached incidents; the romance deals with life in complex relations,\r\ndominated by strong emotions, especially by the emotion of love.\r\n\r\nOther critics arrange prose fiction in the following classes: novels of\r\nadventure (Robinson Crusoe, The Last of the Mohicans), historical novels\r\n(Ivanhoe, The Spy), romantic novels (Lorna Doone, The Heart of Midlothian),\r\nnovels of manners (Cranford, Pride and Prejudice), novels of personality\r\n(Silas Marner, The Scarlet Letter), novels of purpose (Oliver Twist, Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin).\r\n\r\nStill another classification arranges fiction under two heads, romance and\r\nrealism. In the romance, which portrays unusual incidents or characters, we\r\nsee the ideal, the poetic side of humanity; in the realistic novel, dealing\r\nwith ordinary men and women, the prosaic element of life is emphasized.]\r\n\r\nDEFOE (1661-1731). Among the forerunners of the modern novel is Daniel Foe,\r\nauthor of _Robinson Crusoe_, who began to call himself \"Defoe\" after\r\nhe attained fame. He produced an amazing variety of wares: newspapers,\r\nmagazines, ghost stories, biographies, journals, memoirs, satires,\r\npicaresque romances, essays on religion, reform, trade, projects,--in all\r\nmore than two hundred works. These were written in a picturesque style and\r\nwith such a wealth of detail that, though barefaced inventions for the most\r\npart, they passed for veracious chronicles. One critic, thinking of the\r\nvividly realistic _Journal of the Plague Year_ and _Memoirs of a\r\nCavalier_, says that \"Defoe wrote history, but invented the facts\";\r\nanother declares that \"the one little art of which Defoe was past master\r\nwas the art of forging a story and imposing it on the world as truth.\" The\r\nlong list of his works ends with a _History of the Devil_, in 1726.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL DEFOE]\r\n\r\n    Foe's career was an extraordinary one. By nature and training he\r\n    seems to have preferred devious ways to straight, and to have\r\n    concealed his chief motive whether he appeared as reformer or\r\n    politician, tradesman or writer, police-spy or friend of outcasts.\r\n    His education, which he picked up from men and circumstance, was\r\n    more varied than any university could have given him. Perhaps the\r\n    chief factor in this practical education was his ability to turn\r\n    every experience to profitable account. As a journalist he invented\r\n    the modern magazine (his _Review_ appeared in 1704, five years\r\n    before Steele's _Tatler_); also he projected the interview,\r\n    the editorial, the \"scoop,\" and other features which still figure\r\n    in our newspapers. As a hired pamphleteer, writing satires against\r\n    Whigs or Tories, he learned so many political secrets that when one\r\n    party fell he was the best possible man to be employed by the\r\n    other. While sitting in the stocks (in punishment for writing a\r\n    satirical pamphlet that set Tories and Churchmen by the ears) he\r\n    made such a hit with his doggerel verses against the authorities\r\n    that crowds came to the pillory to cheer him and to buy his poem.\r\n    While in durance vile, in the old Newgate Prison, he mingled freely\r\n    with all sorts of criminals (there were no separate cells in those\r\n    days), won their secrets, and used them to advantage in his\r\n    picaresque romances. He learned also so much of the shady side of\r\n    London life that no sooner was he released than he was employed as\r\n    a secret service agent, or spy, by the government which had jailed\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CUPOLA HOUSE Defoe's residence at Bury]\r\n\r\n    It is as difficult to find the real Foe amidst such devious trails\r\n    as to determine where a caribou is from the maze of footprints\r\n    which he leaves behind him. He seems to have been untiring in his\r\n    effort to secure better treatment of outcast folk, he speaks of\r\n    himself with apparent sincerity, as having received his message\r\n    from the Divine Spirit, but the impression which he made upon the\r\n    upper classes was reflected by Swift, who called him \"a grave,\r\n    dogmatical rogue\". For many years he was a popular hero, trusted\r\n    not only by the poor but by the criminal classes (ordinarily keen\r\n    judges of honesty in other men), until his secret connection with\r\n    the government became known. Then suspicion fell upon him, his\r\n    popularity was destroyed and he fled from London. The last few\r\n    years of his life were spent in hiding from real or imaginary\r\n    enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROBINSON CRUSOE]\r\n\r\nDefoe was approaching his sixtieth year when he wrote _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_ (1719), a story which has been read through out the civilized\r\nworld, and which, after two centuries of life, is still young and vigorous.\r\nThe first charm of the book is in its moving adventures, which are\r\nsurprising enough to carry us through the moralizing passages. These also\r\nhave their value; for who ever read them without asking, What would I have\r\ndone or thought or felt under such circumstances? The work of society is\r\nnow so comfortably divided that one seldom dreams of being his own\r\nmechanic, farmer, hunter, herdsman, cook and tailor, as Crusoe was.\r\nThinking of his experience we are brought face to face with our dependence\r\non others, with our debt to the countless, unnamed men whose labor made\r\ncivilization possible. We understand also the pioneers, who in the far,\r\nlonely places of the earth have won a home and country from the wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhen the adventures are duly appreciated we discover another charm of\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_, namely, its intense reality. Defoe had that\r\nexperience of many projects, and that vivid imagination, which enabled him\r\nto put himself in the place of his hero, [Footnote: The basis of\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ was the experience of an English sailor, Alexander\r\nSelkirk, or Selcraig, who was marooned on the lonely island of Juan\r\nFernandez, off the coast of Chile. There he lived in solitude for the space\r\nof five years before he was rescued. When Selkirk returned to England\r\n(1709) an account of his adventures appeared in the public press.] to\r\nanticipate his needs, his feelings, his labors and triumph. That Crusoe was\r\nheroic none will deny; yet his heroism was of a different kind from that\r\nwhich we meet in the old romances. Here was no knight \"without fear and\r\nwithout reproach,\" but a plain man with his strength and weakness. He\r\ndespaired like other men; but instead of giving way to despair he drew up a\r\nlist of his blessings and afflictions, \"like debtor and creditor,\" found a\r\nreasonable balance in his favor, and straightway conquered himself,--which\r\nis the first task of all real heroes. Again, he had horrible fears; he beat\r\nhis breast, cried out as one in mortal terror; then \"I thought that would\r\ndo little good, so I began to make a raft.\" So he overcame his fears, as he\r\novercame the difficulties of the place, by setting himself to do alone what\r\na whole race of men had done before him. _Robinson Crusoe_ is\r\ntherefore history as well as fiction; its subject is not Alexander Selkirk\r\nbut Homo Sapiens; its lesson is the everlasting triumph of will and work.\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON. One morning in 1740 the readers of London found a new work for\r\nsale in the bookshops. It was made up of alleged letters from a girl to her\r\nparents, a sentimental girl who opened her heart freely, explaining its\r\nhopes, fears, griefs, temptations, and especially its moral sensibilities.\r\nSuch a work of fiction was unique at that time. Delighted readers waited\r\nfor another and yet another volume of the same story, till more than a year\r\nhad passed and _Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded_ reached its happy ending.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST NOVEL]\r\n\r\nThe book made a sensation in England; it was speedily translated, and\r\nrepeated its triumph on the other side of the Channel. Comparatively few\r\npeople could read it now without being bored, but it is famous in the\r\nhistory of literature as the first English novel; that is, a story of a\r\nhuman life under stress of emotion, told by one who understood the tastes\r\nof his own age, and who strove to keep his work true to human nature in all\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe author of _Pamela_, Samuel Richardson (1689--1761), was a very\r\nproper person, well satisfied with himself, who conducted a modest business\r\nas printer and bookseller. For years he had practiced writing, and had\r\noften been employed by sentimental young women who came to him for model\r\nlove letters. Hence the extraordinary knowledge of feminine feelings which\r\nRichardson displayed; hence also the epistolary form in which his novels\r\nwere written. His aim in all his work was to teach morality and correct\r\ndeportment. His strength was in his power to analyze and portray emotions.\r\nHis weakness lay in his vanity, which led him to shun masculine society and\r\nto foregather at tea tables with women who flattered him.\r\n\r\nLed by the success of _Pamela_, which portrayed the feelings of a\r\nservant girl, the author began another series of letters which ended in the\r\neight-volume novel _Clarissa, or The History of a Young Lady_ (1748).\r\nThe story appeared in installments, which were awaited with feverish\r\nimpatience till the agony drew to an end, and the heroine died amid the\r\nsobs of ten thousand readers. Yet the story had power, and the central\r\nfigure of Clarissa was impressive in its pathos and tragedy. The novel\r\nwould still be readable if it were stripped of the stilted conversations\r\nand sentimental gush in which Richardson delighted; but that would leave\r\nprecious little of the story.\r\n\r\nFIELDING. In vigorous contrast with the prim and priggish Richardson is\r\nHenry Fielding (1707-1754), a big, jovial, reckless man, full of animal\r\nspirits, who was ready to mitigate any man's troubles or forget his own by\r\nmeans of a punch bowl or a venison potpie. He was noble born, but seems to\r\nhave been thrown on the world to shift for himself. After an excellent\r\neducation he studied law, and was for some years a police magistrate, in\r\nwhich position he increased his large knowledge of the seamy side of life.\r\nHe had a pen for vigorous writing, and after squandering two modest\r\nfortunes (his own and his wife's) he proceeded to earn his living by\r\nwriting buffooneries for the stage. Then appeared Richardson's _Pamela,\r\nor Virtue Rewarded_, and in ridiculing its sentimental heroine Fielding\r\nfound his vocation as a novelist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BURLESQUE OF RICHARDSON]\r\n\r\nHe began _Joseph Andrews_ (1742) as a joke, by taking for his hero an\r\nalleged brother of Pamela, who was also virtuous but whose reward was to be\r\nkicked out of doors. Then the story took to the open road, among the inns\r\nand highways of an age when traveling in rural England was almost as\r\nadventurous as campaigning in Flanders. In the joy of his story Fielding\r\nsoon forgot his burlesque of Richardson, and attempted what he called a\r\nrealistic novel; that is, a story of real life. The morality and decorum\r\nwhich Richardson exalted appeared to Fielding as hypocrisy; so he devoted\r\nhimself to a portrayal of men and manners as he found them.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there were plenty of good men and manners at that time, but\r\nFielding had a vagabond taste that delighted in rough scenes, and of these\r\nalso eighteenth-century England could furnish an abundance. Hence his\r\n_Joseph_ Andrews is a picture not of English society, as is often\r\nalleged, but only of the least significant part of society. The same is\r\ntrue of _Tom Jones_ (1749), which is the author's most vigorous work,\r\nand of _Amelia_ (1751), in which, though he portrays one good woman,\r\nhe repeats many of the questionable incidents of his earlier works.\r\n\r\nThere is power in all these novels, the power of keen observation, of rough\r\nhumor, of downright sincerity; but unhappily the power often runs to waste\r\nin long speeches to the reader, in descriptions of brutal or degrading\r\nscenes, and in a wholly unnecessary coarseness of expression.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE EARLY NOVELS. The idea of the modern novel seems to have\r\nbeen developed by several English authors, each of whom, like pioneers in a\r\nnew country, left his stamp on subsequent works in the same field.\r\nRichardson's governing motive may be summed up in the word \"sensibility,\"\r\nwhich means \"delicacy of feeling,\" and which was a fashion, almost a\r\nfetish, in eighteenth-century society. Because it was deemed essential to\r\ndisplay proper or decorous feeling on all occasions, Richardson's heroines\r\nwere always analyzing their emotions; they talked like a book of etiquette;\r\nthey indulged in tears, fainting, transports of joy, paroxysms of grief,\r\napparently striving to make themselves as unlike a real woman as possible.\r\nIt is astonishing how far and wide this fad of sensibility spread through\r\nthe literary world, and how many gushing heroines of English and American\r\nfiction during the next seventy-five years were modeled on Pamela or\r\nClarissa.\r\n\r\nIn view of this artificial fashion, the influence of Fielding was like the\r\nrush of crisp air into a hot house. His aim was realistic, that is, to\r\nportray real people in their accustomed ways. Unfortunately his aim was\r\nspoiled by the idea that to be realistic one must go to the gutter for\r\nmaterial. And then appeared Goldsmith, too much influenced by the fad of\r\nsensibility, but aiming to depict human life as governed by high ideals,\r\nand helping to cleanse the English novel from brutality and indecency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THREEFOLD INFLUENCE]\r\n\r\nThere were other early novelists, a host of them, but in Richardson,\r\nFielding and Goldsmith we have enough. Richardson emphasized the analysis\r\nof human feeling or motive, and that of itself was excellent; but his\r\nexaggerated sentimentality set a bad fashion which our novelists were\r\nalmost a century in overcoming. Fielding laid stress on realism, and that\r\nhis influence was effective is shown in the work of his disciple Thackeray,\r\nwho could be realistic without being coarse. And Goldsmith made all\r\nsubsequent novelists his debtors by exalting that purity of domestic life\r\nto which every home worthy of the name forever strives or aspires.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, What novels of the early type ought one to read? the answer\r\nis simple. Unless you want to curdle your blood by a tale of mystery and\r\nhorror (in which case Mrs. Radcliffe's _Mysteries of Udolpho_ will\r\nserve the purpose) there are only two that young readers will find\r\nsatisfactory: the realistic _Robinson Crusoe_ by Defoe, and the\r\nromantic _Vicar of Wakefield_ by Goldsmith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. What we call eighteenth-century literature appeared\r\n    between two great political upheavals, the English Revolution of\r\n    1688 and the French Revolution of 1789. Some of the chief\r\n    characteristics of that literature--such as the emphasis on form,\r\n    the union of poetry with politics, the prevalence of satire, the\r\n    interest in historical subjects--have been accounted for, in part\r\n    at least, in our summary of the history of the period.\r\n\r\n    The writings of the century are here arranged in three main\r\n    divisions: the reign of formalism (miscalled classicism), the\r\n    revival of romantic poetry, and the development of the modern\r\n    novel. Our study of the so-called classic period includes: (1) The\r\n    meaning of classicism in literature. (2) The life and works of\r\n    Pope, the leading poet of the age; of Swift, a master of satire; of\r\n    Addison and Steele, the graceful essayists who originated the\r\n    modern literary magazine. (3) The work of Dr. Johnson and his\r\n    school; in which we have included, for convenience, Edmund Burke,\r\n    most eloquent of English orators, and Gibbon the historian, famous\r\n    for his _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_.\r\n\r\n    Our review of the romantic writers of the age covers: (1) The work\r\n    of Collins and Gray, whose imaginative poems are in refreshing\r\n    contrast to the formalism of Pope and his school. (2) The life and\r\n    works of Goldsmith, poet, playwright, novelist; and of Burns, the\r\n    greatest of Scottish song writers. (3) A glance at other poets,\r\n    such as Cowper and Blake, who aided in the romantic revival. (4)\r\n    The renewed interest in ballads and legends, which showed itself in\r\n    Percy's _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_, and in two\r\n    famous forgeries, the _Ossian_ poems of Macpherson and _The\r\n    Rowley Papers_ of the boy Chatterton.\r\n\r\n    Our study of the novel includes: (1) The meaning of the modern\r\n    novel, as distinct from the ancient romance. (2) A study of Defoe,\r\n    author of _Robinson Crusoe_, who was a forerunner of the\r\n    modern realistic novelist. (3) The works of Richardson and of\r\n    Fielding, contrasting types of eighteenth-century story-tellers.\r\n    (4) The influence of Richardson's sentimentality, of Fielding's\r\n    realism, and of Goldsmith's moral purity on subsequent English\r\n    fiction.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

By\r\ndemocracy we mean the assumption by common men of the responsibilities of\r\ngovernment, with a consequent enlargement of human liberty. Romanticism, as\r\nwe use the term here, means simply that literature, like politics, has\r\nbecome liberalized; that it is concerned with the common life of men, and\r\nthat the delights of literature, like the powers of government, are no\r\nlonger the possession of the few but of the many.\r\n\r\n    HISTORICAL OUTLINE. To study either democracy or romanticism, the\r\n    Whig party or the poetry of Wordsworth, is to discover how greatly\r\n    England was influenced by matters that appeared beyond her borders.\r\n    The famous Reform Bill (1832) which established manhood suffrage,\r\n    the emancipation of the slaves in all British colonies, the\r\n    hard-won freedom of the press, the plan of popular\r\n    education,--these and numberless other reforms of the age may be\r\n    regarded as part of a general movement, as the attempt to fulfill\r\n    in England a promise made to the world by two events which occurred\r\n    earlier and on foreign soil. These two events, which profoundly\r\n    influenced English politics and literature, were the Declaration of\r\n    Independence and the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TWO REVOLUTIONS]\r\n\r\n    In the Declaration we read, \"We hold these truths to be\r\n    self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed\r\n    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these\r\n    are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Glorious words!\r\n    But they were not new; they were old and familiar when Jefferson\r\n    wrote them. The American Revolution, which led up to the\r\n    Declaration, is especially significant in this: that it began as a\r\n    struggle not for new privileges but for old rights. So the\r\n    constructive character of that Revolution, which ended with a\r\n    democracy and a noble constitution, was due largely to the fact\r\n    that brave men stood ready to defend the old freedom, the old\r\n    manhood, the old charters, \"the good old cause\" for which other\r\n    brave men had lived or died through a thousand years.\r\n\r\n    A little later, and influenced by the American triumph, came\r\n    another uprising of a different kind. In France the unalienable\r\n    rights of man had been forgotten during ages of tyranny and class\r\n    privilege; so the French Revolution, shouting its watchwords of\r\n    Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, had no conception of that liberty\r\n    and equality which were as ancient as the hills. Leaders and\r\n    followers of the Revolution were clamoring for new privileges, new\r\n    rights, new morals, new creeds. They acclaimed an \"Age of Reason\"\r\n    as a modern and marvelous discovery; they dreamed not simply of a\r\n    new society, but of a new man. A multitude of clubs or parties,\r\n    some political, some literary or educational, some with a pretense\r\n    of philosophy, sprang up as if by magic, all believing that they\r\n    must soon enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but nearly all forgetful of\r\n    the fact that to enter the Kingdom one must accept the old\r\n    conditions, and pay the same old price. Partly because of this\r\n    strange conception of liberty, as a new thing to be established by\r\n    fiat, the terrible struggle in France ended in the ignoble military\r\n    despotism of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: EFFECT OF THE REVOLUTIONS]\r\n\r\n    These two revolutions, one establishing and the other clamoring for\r\n    the dignity of manhood, created a mighty stir throughout the\r\n    civilized world. Following the French Revolution, most European\r\n    nations were thrown into political ferment, and the object of all\r\n    their agitation, rebellion, upheaval, was to obtain a greater\r\n    measure of democracy by overturning every form of class or caste\r\n    government. Thrones seemed to be tottering, and in terror of their\r\n    houses Continental sovereigns entered into their Holy Alliance\r\n    (1815) with the unholy object of joining forces to crush democracy\r\n    wherever it appeared.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND LITERATURE. The young writers of liberty-loving England\r\nfelt the stir, the _sursum_ of the age. Wordsworth, most sedate of\r\nmen, saw in the French Revolution a glorious prophecy, and wrote with\r\nunwonted enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\r\n  But to be young was very Heaven.\r\n\r\nColeridge and Southey formed their grand scheme of a Pantisocracy, a\r\ngovernment of perfect equality, on the banks of the Susquehanna. Scott\r\n(always a Tory, and therefore distrustful of change) reflected the\r\ndemocratic enthusiasm in a score of romances, the chief point of which was\r\nthis: that almost every character was at heart a king, and spake right\r\nkingly fashion. Byron won his popularity largely because he was an\r\nuncompromising rebel, and appealed to young rebels who were proclaiming the\r\nnecessity of a new human society. And Shelley, after himself rebelling at\r\nalmost every social law of his day, wrote his _Prometheus Unbound_,\r\nwhich is a vague but beautiful vision of humanity redeemed in some magical\r\nway from all oppression and sorrow.\r\n\r\nAll these and other writers of the age give the impression, as we read them\r\nnow, that they were gloriously expectant of a new day of liberty that was\r\nabout to dawn on the world. Their romantic enthusiasm, so different from\r\nthe cold formality of the age preceding, is a reflection, like a rosy\r\nsunset glow, of the stirring scenes of revolution through which the world\r\nhad just passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WORDSWORTH (1770-1850)\r\n\r\nThere is but one way to know Wordsworth, and that way leads to his nature\r\npoems. Though he lived in a revolutionary age, his life was singularly\r\nuneventful. His letters are terribly prosaic; and his _Excursion_, in\r\nwhich he attempted an autobiography, has so many dull lines that few have\r\npatience to read it. Though he asserted, finely, that there is but one\r\ngreat society on earth, \"the noble living and the noble dead,\" he held no\r\ncommunion with the great minds of the past or of the present. He lived in\r\nhis own solitary world, and his only real companion was nature. To know\r\nnature at first hand, and to reflect human thought or feeling in nature's\r\npure presence,--this was his chief object. His field, therefore, is a small\r\none, but in that field he is the greatest master that England has thus far\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WORDSWORTH]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Wordsworth is as inseparably connected with the English Lake\r\n    District as Burns with the Lowlands or Scott with the Border. A\r\n    large part of the formative period of his life was spent out of\r\n    doors amid beautiful scenery, where he felt the abounding life of\r\n    nature streaming upon him in the sunshine, or booming in his ears\r\n    with the steady roar of the March winds. He felt also (what\r\n    sensitive spirits still feel) a living presence that met him in the\r\n    loneliest wood, or spoke to him in the flowers, or preceded him\r\n    over the wind-swept hills. He was one of those favored mortals who\r\n    are surest of the Unseen. From school he would hurry away to his\r\n    skating or bird-nesting or aimless roaming, and every new day\r\n    afield was to him \"One of those heavenly days that cannot die.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WORDSWORTH AND THE REVOLUTION]\r\n\r\n    From the Lake Region he went to Cambridge, but found little in\r\n    college life to attract or hold him. Then, stirred by the promise\r\n    of the Revolution, he went to France, where his help was eagerly\r\n    sought by rival parties; for in that day every traveler from\r\n    America or England, whether an astute Jefferson or a lamblike\r\n    Wordsworth, was supposed to be, by virtue of his country, a master\r\n    politician Wordsworth threw himself rather blindly into the\r\n    Revolution, joined the Girondists (the ruling faction in 1792) and\r\n    might have gone to the guillotine with the leaders of that party\r\n    had not his friends brought him home by the simple expedient of\r\n    cutting off his supply of money. Thus ended ingloriously the only\r\n    adventure that ever quickened his placid life.\r\n\r\n    For a time Wordsworth mourned over the failure of his plans, but\r\n    his grief turned to bitterness when the Revolution passed over into\r\n    the Reign of Terror and ended in the despotism of Napoleon. His\r\n    country was now at war with France, and he followed his country,\r\n    giving mild support to Burke and the Tory party. After a few\r\n    uncertain years, during which he debated his calling in life, he\r\n    resolved on two things: to be a poet, and to bring back to English\r\n    poetry the romantic spirit and the naturalness of expression which\r\n    had been displaced by the formal elegance of the age of Pope and\r\n    Johnson.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WORDSWORTH'S DESK IN HAWKSHEAD SCHOOL]\r\n\r\n    For that resolution we are indebted partly to Coleridge, who had\r\n    been attracted by some of Wordsworth's early poems, and who\r\n    encouraged him to write more. From the association of these two men\r\n    came the famous _Lyrical Ballads_ (1798), a book which marks\r\n    the beginning of a new era in English poetry.\r\n\r\n    To Wordsworth's sister Dorothy we are even more indebted. It was\r\n    she who soothed Wordsworth's disappointment, reminded him of the\r\n    world of nature in which alone he was at home, and quietly showed\r\n    him where his power lay. As he says, in _The Prelude_\r\n\r\n      She whispered still that brightness would return,\r\n      She, in the midst of all preserved me still\r\n      A poet, made me seek beneath that name,\r\n      And that alone, my office upon earth\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PERSONAL TRAITS]\r\n\r\n    The latter half of Wordsworth's life was passed in the Lake Region,\r\n    at Grasmere and Rydal Mount for the most part, the continuity being\r\n    broken by walking trips in Britain or on the Continent. A very\r\n    quiet, uneventful life it was, but it revealed two qualities which\r\n    are of interest to Wordsworth's readers. The first was his devotion\r\n    to his art; the second was his granite steadfastness. His work was\r\n    at first neglected, while the poems of Scott, Byron and Tennyson in\r\n    succession attained immense popularity. The critics were nearly all\r\n    against him; misunderstanding his best work and ridiculing the\r\n    rest. The ground of their opposition was, that his theory of the\r\n    utmost simplicity in poetry was wrong; their ridicule was made\r\n    easier by the fact that Wordsworth produced as much bad work as\r\n    good. Moreover, he took himself very seriously, had no humor, and,\r\n    as visitors like Emerson found to their disappointment, was\r\n    interested chiefly in himself and his own work. For was he not\r\n    engaged in the greatest of all projects, an immense poem (_The\r\n    Recluse_) which should reflect the universe in the life of one\r\n    man, and that man William Wordsworth? Such self-satisfaction\r\n    invited attack; even Lamb, the gentlest of critics, could hardly\r\n    refrain from poking fun at it:\r\n\r\n        \"Wordsworth, the great poet, is coming to town; he is to\r\n        have apartments in the Mansion House. He says he does not\r\n        see much difficulty in writing like Shakespeare, if he had\r\n        a mind to try it. It is clear that nothing is wanting but\r\n        the mind.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS TRIUMPH]\r\n\r\n    Slowly but surely Wordsworth won recognition, not simply in being\r\n    made Laureate, but in having his ideal of poetry vindicated. Poets\r\n    in England and America began to follow him; the critics were\r\n    silenced, if not convinced. While the popularity of Scott and Byron\r\n    waned, the readers of Wordsworth increased steadily, finding him a\r\n    poet not of the hour but of all time. \"If a single man plant\r\n    himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide,\" says\r\n    Emerson, \"the huge world will come around to him.\" If the reading\r\n    world has not yet come around to Wordsworth, that is perhaps not\r\n    the poet's fault.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH: HIS THEME AND THEORY. The theory which Wordsworth and Coleridge\r\nformulated was simply this: that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of\r\npowerful human feeling. Its only subjects are nature and human nature; its\r\nonly object is to reflect the emotions awakened by our contemplation of the\r\nworld or of humanity; its language must be as direct and simple as\r\npossible, such language as rises unbidden to the lips whenever the heart is\r\ntouched. Though some of the world's best poets have taken a different view,\r\nWordsworth maintained steadily that poetry must deal with common subjects\r\nin the plainest language; that it must not attempt to describe, in elegant\r\nphrases, what a poet is supposed to feel about art or some other subject\r\nselected for its poetic possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURAL VS. FORMAL POETRY]\r\n\r\nIn the last contention Wordsworth was aiming at the formal school of\r\npoetry, and we may better understand him by a comparison. Read, for\r\nexample, his exquisite \"Early Spring\" (\"I heard a thousand blended notes\").\r\nHere in twenty-four lines are more naturalness, more real feeling finely\r\nexpressed, than you can find in the poems of Dryden, Johnson and Addison\r\ncombined. Or take the best part of \"The Campaign,\" which made Addison's\r\nfortune, and which was acclaimed the finest thing ever written:\r\n\r\n  So when an angel by divine command\r\n  With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\r\n  (Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past)\r\n  Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\r\n  And, pleased th' Almighty's orders to perform,\r\n  Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.\r\n\r\nTo know how artificial that famous simile is, read a few lines from\r\nWordsworth's \"On the Sea-Shore,\" which lingers in our mind like a strain of\r\nHandel's music:\r\n\r\n  It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,\r\n    The holy time is quiet as a Nun\r\n    Breathless with adoration; the broad sun\r\n  Is sinking down in its tranquillity;\r\n  The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea:\r\n    Listen! the mighty Being is awake,\r\n    And doth with his eternal motion make\r\n  A sound like thunder--everlastingly.\r\n\r\nIf such comparisons interest the student, let him read Addison's \"Letter to\r\nLord Halifax,\" with its Apostrophe to Liberty, which was considered sublime\r\nin its day:\r\n\r\n  O Liberty, thou goddess heavenly bright,\r\n  Profuse of bliss, and pregnant with delight!\r\n  Eternal pleasures in thy presence reign,\r\n  And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton train;\r\n  Eased of her load, Subjection grows more light,\r\n  And Poverty looks cheerful in thy sight;\r\n  Thou mak'st the gloomy face of nature gay,\r\n  Giv'st beauty to the sun, and pleasure to the day.\r\n\r\nPlace beside that the first four lines of Wordsworth's sonnet \"To\r\nSwitzerland\" (quoted at the head of this chapter), or a stanza from his\r\n\"Ode to Duty\":\r\n\r\n  Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear\r\n    The Godhead's most benignant grace;\r\n  Nor know we anything so fair\r\n    As is the smile upon thy face:\r\n  Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,\r\n  And fragrance in thy footing treads;\r\n    Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,\r\n    And the most ancient heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.\r\n\r\nTo follow such a comparison is to understand Wordsworth by sympathy; it is\r\nto understand also the difference between poetry and formal verse.\r\n\r\nTHE POEMS OF WORDSWORTH. As the reading of literature is the main thing,\r\nthe only word of criticism which remains is to direct the beginner; and\r\ndirection is especially necessary in dealing with Wordsworth, who wrote\r\nvoluminously, and who lacked both the critical judgment and the sense of\r\nhumor to tell him what parts of his work were inferior or ridiculous:\r\n\r\n  There's something in a flying horse,\r\n  There's something in a huge balloon!\r\n\r\nTo be sure; springs in the one, gas in the other; but if there were\r\nanything more poetic in horse or balloon, Wordsworth did not discover it.\r\nThere is something also in a cuckoo clock, or even in\r\n\r\n  A household tub, one such as those\r\n  Which women use to wash their clothes.\r\n\r\nSuch banalities are to be found in the work of a poet who could produce the\r\nexquisite sonnet \"On Westminster Bridge,\" the finely simple \"I Wandered\r\nLonely as a Cloud,\" the stirring \"Ode to Duty,\" the tenderly reflective\r\n\"Tintern Abbey,\" and the magnificent \"Intimations of Immortality,\" which\r\nEmerson (who was not a very safe judge) called \"the high water mark of\r\npoetry in the nineteenth century.\" These five poems may serve as the first\r\nmeasure of Wordsworth's genius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POEMS OF NATURE]\r\n\r\nA few of Wordsworth's best nature poems are: \"Early Spring,\" \"Three Years\r\nShe Grew,\" \"The Fountain,\" \"My Heart Leaps Up,\" \"The Tables Turned,\" \"To a\r\nCuckoo,\" \"To a Skylark\" (the second poem, beginning, \"Ethereal minstrel\")\r\nand \"Yarrow Revisited.\" The spirit of all his nature poems is reflected in\r\n\"Tintern Abbey,\" which gives us two complementary views of nature,\r\ncorresponding to Wordsworth's earlier and later experience. The first is\r\nthat of the boy, roaming foot-loose over the face of nature, finding, as\r\nColeridge said, \"Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere.\" The second\r\nis that of the man who returns to the scenes of his boyhood, finds them as\r\nbeautiful as ever, but pervaded now by a spiritual quality,--\"something\r\nwhich defies analysis, undefined and ineffable, which must be felt and\r\nperceived by the soul.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this spiritual view of nature, as a reflection of the Divine, which\r\nprofoundly influenced Bryant, Emerson and other American writers. The\r\nessence of Wordsworth's teaching, in his nature poems, appears in the last\r\ntwo lines of his \"Skylark,\" a bird that soars the more gladly to heaven\r\nbecause he must soon return with joy to his own nest:\r\n\r\n  Type of the wise, who soar but never roam:\r\n  True to the kindred points of heaven and home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POEMS OF HUMBLE LIFE]\r\n\r\nOf the poems more closely associated with human life, a few the best are:\r\n\"Michael,\" \"The Highland Reaper,\" \"The Leech Gatherers,\" \"Margaret\" (in\r\n_The Excursion_), \"Brougham Castle,\" \"The Happy Warrior,\" \"Peel Castle\r\nin a Storm,\" \"Three Years She Grew,\" \"She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways\"\r\nand \"She was a Phantom of Delight.\" In such poems we note two significant\r\ncharacteristics: that Wordsworth does not seek extraordinary characters,\r\nbut is content to show the hidden beauty in the lives of plain men and\r\nwomen; and that his heroes and heroines dwell, as he said, where \"labor\r\nstill preserves his rosy face.\" They are natural men and women, and are\r\ntherefore simple and strong; the quiet light in their faces is reflected\r\nfrom the face of the fields. In his emphasis on natural simplicity, virtue,\r\nbeauty, Wordsworth has again been, as he desired, a teacher of multitudes.\r\nHis moral teaching may be summed up in three lines from _The\r\nExcursion_:\r\n\r\n  The primal duties shine aloft like stars;\r\n  The charities that soothe and heal and bless\r\n  Are scattered at the feet of man like flowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SONNETS]\r\n\r\nIn the number and fine quality of his sonnets Wordsworth has no superior in\r\nEnglish poetry. Simplicity, strength, deep thought, fine feeling, careful\r\nworkmanship,--these qualities are present in measure more abundant than can\r\nbe found elsewhere in the poet's work:\r\n\r\n        Bees that soar for bloom,\r\n  High as the highest peak of Furness-fells,\r\n  Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells.\r\n\r\nIn these three lines from \"On the Sonnet\" (which should be read entire) is\r\nthe explanation why Wordsworth, who was often diffuse, found joy in\r\ncompressing his whole poem into fourteen lines. A few other sonnets which\r\ncan be heartily recommended are: \"Westminster Bridge,\" \"The Seashore,\" \"The\r\nWorld,\" \"Venetian Republic,\" \"To Sleep,\" \"Toussaint L'Ouverture,\"\r\n\"Afterthoughts,\" \"To Milton\" (sometimes called \"London, 1802\") and the\r\nfarewell to Scott when he sailed in search of health, beginning, \"A trouble\r\nnot of clouds or weeping rain.\"\r\n\r\nNot until one has learned to appreciate Wordsworth at his best will it be\r\nsafe to attempt _The Prelude, or the Growth of a Poet's Mind_. Most\r\npeople grow weary of this poem, which is too long; but a few read it with\r\npleasure for its portrayal of Wordsworth's education at the hand of Nature,\r\nor for occasional good lines which lure us on like miners in search of\r\ngold. _The Prelude_, though written at thirty-five, was not published\r\ntill after Wordsworth's death, and for this reason: he had planned an\r\nimmense poem, dealing with Nature, Man and Society, which he called _The\r\nRecluse_, and which he likened to a Gothic cathedral. His _Prelude_\r\nwas the \"ante-chapel\" of this work; his miscellaneous odes, sonnets and\r\nnarrative poems were to be as so many \"cells and oratories\"; other parts of\r\nthe structure were _The Home at Grasmere_ and _The Excursion_,\r\nwhich he may have intended as transepts, or as chapels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. OSWALD'S CHURCH, GRASMERE\r\nWordsworth's body was buried in the churchyard See _The Excursion_, Book V]\r\n\r\nThis great work was left unfinished, and one may say of it, as of Spenser's\r\n_Faery Queen_, that it is better so. Like other poets of venerable\r\nyears Wordsworth wrote many verses that were better left in the inkpot; and\r\nit is a pity, in dealing with so beautiful and necessary a thing as poetry,\r\nthat one should ever reach the point of saying, sadly but truthfully,\r\n\"Enough is too much.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLERIDGE AND SOUTHEY\r\n\r\nThe story of these two men is a commentary on the uncertainties of literary\r\nfortune. Both won greater reward and reputation than fell to the lot of\r\nWordsworth; but while the fame of the latter poet mounts steadily with the\r\nyears, the former have become, as it were, footnotes to the great\r\ncontemporary with whom they were associated, under the name of \"Lake\r\nPoets,\" for half a glorious century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE]\r\n\r\nSAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE (1772-1834). The tragedy _Remorse_, which\r\nColeridge wrote, is as nothing compared with the tragedy of his own life.\r\nHe was a man of superb natural gifts, of vast literary culture, to whose\r\ngenius the writers of that age--Wordsworth, Hazlitt, Lamb, De Quincey,\r\nShelley, Landor, Southey--nearly all bear witness. He might well have been\r\na great poet, or critic, or philosopher, or teacher; but he lacked the will\r\npower to direct his gifts to any definite end. His irresolution became\r\npitiful weakness when he began to indulge in the drug habit, which soon\r\nmade a slave of him. Thereafter he impressed all who met him with a sense\r\nof loss and inexpressible sorrow.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LIFE OF COLERIDGE]\r\n\r\n    Coleridge began to read at three years of age; at five he had gone\r\n    through the Bible and the Arabian Nights; at thirty he was perhaps\r\n    the most widely read man of his generation in the fields of\r\n    literature and philosophy. He was a student in a famous charity\r\n    school in London when he met Charles Lamb, who records his memories\r\n    of the boy and the place in his charming essay of \"Christ's\r\n    Hospital.\" At college he was one of a band of enthusiasts inspired\r\n    by the French Revolution, and with Southey he formed a plan to\r\n    establish in America a world-reforming Pantisocracy, or communistic\r\n    settlement, where all should be brothers and equals, and where a\r\n    little manual work was to be tempered by much play, poetry and\r\n    culture. Europeans had queer ideas of America in those days. This\r\n    beautiful plan failed, because the reformers did not have money\r\n    enough to cross the ocean and stake out their Paradise.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE COLERIDGE COTTAGE, NETHER STOWEY, IN\r\n    SOMERSETSHIRE]\r\n\r\n    The next important association of Coleridge was with Wordsworth and\r\n    his sister Dorothy, in Somerset, where the three friends planned\r\n    and published the _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798. In this work\r\n    Wordsworth attempted to portray the charm of common things, and\r\n    Coleridge to give reality to a world of dreams and fantasies.\r\n    Witness the two most original poems in the book, \"Tintern Abbey\"\r\n    and \"The Ancient Mariner.\"\r\n\r\n    During the latter part of his life Coleridge won fame by his\r\n    lectures on English poetry and German philosophy, and still greater\r\n    fame by his conversations,--brilliant, heaven-scaling monologues,\r\n    which brought together a company of young enthusiasts. And\r\n    presently these disciples of Coleridge were spreading abroad a new\r\n    idealistic philosophy, which crossed the ocean, was welcomed by\r\n    Emerson and a host of young writers or reformers, and appeared in\r\n    American literature as Transcendentalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n        [Sidenote: STORIES OF COLERIDGE]\r\n\r\n        Others who heard the conversations were impressed in a\r\n        somewhat different way. Keats met Coleridge on the road,\r\n        one day, and listened dumbfounded to an ecstatic discourse\r\n        on poetry, nightingales, the origin of sensation, dreams\r\n        (four kinds), consciousness, creeds, ghost stories,--\"he\r\n        broached a thousand matters\" while the poets were walking a\r\n        space of two miles.\r\n\r\n        Walter Scott, meeting Coleridge at a dinner, listened with\r\n        his head in a whirl to a monologue on fairies, the\r\n        classics, ancient mysteries, visions, ecstasies, the\r\n        psychology of poetry, the poetry of metaphysics. \"Zounds!\"\r\n        says Scott, \"I was never so bethumped with words.\"\r\n\r\n        Charles Lamb, hurrying to his work, encountered Coleridge\r\n        and was drawn aside to a quiet garden. There the poet took\r\n        Lamb by a button of his coat, closed his eyes, and began to\r\n        discourse, his right hand waving to the rhythm of the\r\n        flowing words. No sooner was Coleridge well started than\r\n        Lamb slyly took out his penknife, cut off the button, and\r\n        escaped unobserved. Some hours later, as he passed the\r\n        garden on his return, Lamb heard a voice speaking most\r\n        musically; he turned aside in wonder, and there stood\r\n        Coleridge, his eyes closed, his left hand holding the\r\n        button, his right hand waving, \"still talking like an\r\n        angel.\"\r\n\r\n    Such are the stories, true or apocryphal, of Coleridge's\r\n    conversations. Their bewildering quality appears, somewhat dimmed,\r\n    in his prose works, which have been finely compared with the flight\r\n    of an eagle on set wings, sweeping in wide circles, balancing,\r\n    soaring, mounting on the winds. But we must note this difference:\r\n    that the eagle keeps his keen eye on the distant earth, and always\r\n    knows just where he is; while Coleridge sees only the wonders of\r\n    Cloudland, and appears to be hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS PROSE AND POETRY]\r\n\r\nThe chief prose works of Coleridge are his _Biographia Literaria_ (a\r\nbrilliant patchwork of poetry and metaphysics), _Aids to Reflection_,\r\n_Letters and Table Talk_ (the most readable of his works), and\r\n_Lectures and Notes on Shakespeare_. These all contain fine gold, but\r\nthe treasure is for those doughty miners the critics rather than for\r\nreaders who go to literature for recreation. Among the best of his\r\nmiscellaneous poems (and Coleridge at his best has few superiors) are\r\n\"Youth and Age,\" \"Love Poems,\" \"Hymn before Sunrise,\" \"Ode to the Departing\r\nYear,\" and the pathetic \"Ode to Dejection,\" which is a reflection of the\r\npoet's saddened but ever hopeful life.\r\n\r\nTwo other poems, highly recommended by most critics, are the fragments\r\n\"Kubla Khan\" and \"Christabel\"; but in dealing with these the reader may do\r\nwell to form his own judgment. Both fragments contain beautiful lines, but\r\nas a whole they are wandering, disjointed, inconsequent,--mere sketches,\r\nthey seem, of some weird dream of mystery or terror which Coleridge is\r\ntrying in vain to remember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ANCIENT MARINER]\r\n\r\nThe most popular of Coleridge's works is his imperishable \"Rime of the\r\nAncient Mariner,\" a wildly improbable poem of icebound or tropic seas, of\r\nthirst-killed sailors, of a phantom ship sailed by a crew of ghosts,--all\r\nportrayed in the vivid, picturesque style of the old ballad. When the\r\n\"Mariner\" first appeared it was dismissed as a cock-and-bull story; yet\r\nsomehow readers went back to it, again and again, as if fascinated. It was\r\npassed on to the next generation; and still we read it, and pass it on. For\r\nthis grotesque tale differs from all others of its kind in that its lines\r\nhave been quoted for over a hundred years as a reflection of some profound\r\nhuman experience. That is the genius of the work: it takes the most\r\nfantastic illusions and makes them appear as real as any sober journey\r\nrecorded in a sailor's log book. [Footnote: In connection with the \"Ancient\r\nMariner\" one should read the legends of \"The Flying Dutchman\" and \"The\r\nWandering Jew.\" Poe's story \"A Manuscript Found in a Bottle\" is based on\r\nthese legends and on Coleridge's poem.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time our enjoyment of the \"Mariner\" is somewhat hampered by\r\nthe critical commentaries which have fastened upon the poem, like barnacles\r\non an old ship. It has been studied as a type of the romantic ballad, as a\r\nmoral lesson, as a tract against cruelty to animals, as a model of college\r\nEnglish. But that is no way to abuse a poet's fancy! To appreciate the\r\n\"Mariner\" as the author intended, one should carry it off to the hammock or\r\norchard; there to have freedom of soul to enjoy a well-spun yarn, a\r\ngorgeous flight of imagination, a poem which illustrates Coleridge's\r\ndefinition of poetry as \"the bloom and the fragrance of all human\r\nknowledge, thoughts, emotions, language.\" It broadens one's sympathy, as\r\nwell as one's horizon, to accompany this ancient sailor through scenes of\r\nterror and desolation:\r\n\r\n  O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been\r\n  Alone on a wide, wide sea:\r\n  So lonely 't was, that God himself\r\n  Scarce seemed there to be.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such scenes come blessed memories of a real world, of the\r\nbeauty of unappreciated things, such as the \"sweet jargoning\" of birds:\r\n\r\n  And now 'twas like all instruments,\r\n  Now like a lonely flute;\r\n  And now it is an angel's song,\r\n  That makes the heavens be mute.\r\n\r\n  It ceased; yet still the sails made on\r\n  A pleasant noise till noon,\r\n  A noise like of a hidden brook\r\n  In the leafy month of June,\r\n  That to the sleeping woods all night\r\n  Singeth a quiet tune.\r\n\r\nWhoever is not satisfied with that for its own sake, without moral or\r\nanalysis, has missed the chief interest of all good poetry.\r\n\r\nROBERT SOUTHEY. In contrast with the irresolution of Coleridge is the\r\nsteadfastness of Southey (1774-1843), a man of strong character, of\r\nenormous industry. For fifty years he worked steadily, day and half the\r\nnight, turning out lyrics, ballads, epics, histories, biographies,\r\ntranslations, reviews,--an immense amount of stuff, filling endless\r\nvolumes. Kind nature made up for Southey's small talent by giving him a\r\ngreat opinion of it, and he believed firmly that his work was as immortal\r\nas the _Iliad_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT SOUTHEY]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few short poems, such as the \"Battle of Blenheim,\"\r\n\"Lodore,\" \"The Inchcape Rock\" and \"Father William\" (parodied in the\r\nnonsense of _Alice in Wonderland_), the mass of Southey's work is\r\nalready forgotten. Deserving of mention, however, are his _Peninsular\r\nWar_ and his _Life of Nelson_, both written in a straightforward\r\nstyle, portraying patriotism without the usual sham, and a first-class\r\nfighting man without brag or bluster. Curious readers may also be attracted\r\nby the epics of Southey (such as _Madoc_, the story of a Welsh prince\r\nwho anticipated Columbus), which contain plenty of the marvelous adventures\r\nthat give interest to the romances of Jules Verne and the yarns of Rider\r\nHaggard.\r\n\r\nIt as Southey's habit to work by the clock, turning out chapters as another\r\nman might dig potatoes. One day, as he plodded along, a fairy must have\r\nwhispered in his car; for he suddenly produced a little story, a gem, a\r\ntreasure of a story, and hid it away in a jungle of chapters in a book\r\ncalled _The Doctor_. Somebody soon discovered the treasure; indeed,\r\none might as well try to conceal a lighted candle as to hide a good story;\r\nand now it is the most famous work to be found in Southey's hundred volumes\r\nof prose and verse. Few professors could give you any information\r\nconcerning _The Doctor_, but almost any child will tell you all about\r\n\"The Three Bears.\" The happy fate of this little nursery tale might\r\nindicate that the final judges of literature are not always or often the\r\nlearned critics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY POETS\r\n\r\nThe above title is often applied to Byron and Shelley, and for two reasons,\r\nbecause they were themselves rebellious of heart, and because they voiced\r\nthe rebellion of numerous other young enthusiasts who, disappointed by the\r\nfailure of the French Revolution to bring in the promised age of happiness,\r\nwere ready to cry out against the existing humdrum order of society. Both\r\npoets were sadly lacking in mental or moral balance, and finding no chance\r\nin England to wage heroic Warfare against political tyranny, as the French\r\nhad done, they proceeded in rather head long fashion to an attack on well\r\nestablished customs in society, and especially did they strike out wildly\r\nagainst \"the monster Public Opinion.\" Because the \"monster\" was stronger\r\nthan they were, and more nearly right, their rebellion ended in tragedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRETA HALL (IN THE LAKE REGION)\r\nWhere Southey lived, 1803-1839]\r\n\r\n    LIFE OF BYRON. In the life of George Gordon, Lord Byron\r\n    (1788-1824), is so much that call for apology or silence that one\r\n    is glad to review his career in briefest outline.\r\n\r\n    Of his family, noble in name but in nothing else, the least said\r\n    the better. He was born in London, but spent his childhood in\r\n    Aberdeen, under the alternate care or negligence of his erratic\r\n    mother. At ten he fell heir to a title, to the family seat of\r\n    Newstead Abbey, and to estates yielding an income of some £1400 per\r\n    year,--a large income for a poet, but as nothing to a lord\r\n    accustomed to make ducks and drakes of his money. In school and\r\n    college his conduct was rather wild, and his taste fantastic For\r\n    example, he kept a bulldog and a bear in his rooms, and read\r\n    romances instead of books recommended by the faculty. He tells us\r\n    that he detested poetry; yet he wrote numerous poems which show\r\n    plainly that he not only read but copied some of the poets.\r\n    [Footnote: These poems (revised and published as _Hours of\r\n    Idleness_) were savagely criticized in the _Edinburgh\r\n    Review_. Byron answered with his satiric _English Bards and\r\n    Scotch Reviewers_, which ridiculed not only his Scottish critics\r\n    but also Wordsworth, Scott,--in fact, most of the English poets,\r\n    with the exception of Pope, whom he praised as the only poet\r\n    ancient or modern who was not a barbarian.]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A LITERARY LION]\r\n\r\n    At twenty-one Byron entered the House of Lords, and almost\r\n    immediately thereafter set sail for Lisbon and the Levant. On his\r\n    return he published the first two cantos of _Childe Harold's\r\n    Pilgrimage_, which made him famous. Though he affected to\r\n    despise his triumph, he followed it up shrewdly by publishing\r\n    _The Giaour_, _The Corsair_ and _Lara_, in which the\r\n    same mysterious hero of his first work reappears, under different\r\n    disguises, amid romantic surroundings. The vigor of these poems\r\n    attracted many readers, and when it was whispered about that the\r\n    author was recounting his own adventures, Byron became the center\r\n    of literary interest. At home he was a social lion; abroad he was\r\n    acclaimed the greatest of British poets. But his life tended more\r\n    and more to shock the English sense of decency; and when his wife\r\n    (whom he had married for her money) abruptly left him, public\r\n    opinion made its power felt. Byron's popularity waned; his vanity\r\n    was wounded; he left his country, vowing never to return. Also he\r\n    railed against what he called British hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LORD BYRON After the portrait by T. Phillips]\r\n\r\n    In Geneva he first met Shelley, admired him, was greatly helped by\r\n    him, and then grossly abused his hospitality. After a scandalous\r\n    career in Italy he went to help the Greeks in their fight for\r\n    independence, but died of fever before he reached the battle line.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF BYRON. There is one little song of Byron which serves well as\r\nthe measure of his poetic talent. It is found in _Don Juan_, and it\r\nbegins as follows:\r\n\r\n  'T is sweet to hear\r\n    At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep\r\n  The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,\r\n    By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;\r\n  'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;\r\n    'T is sweet to listen, as the night-winds creep\r\n  From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high\r\n  The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.\r\n\r\n  'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark\r\n    Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home;\r\n  'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark\r\n    Our coming, and look brighter when we come;\r\n  'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,\r\n    Or lulled by falling waters; sweet the hum\r\n  Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,\r\n  The lisp of children, and their earliest words.\r\n\r\nThat is not great poetry, and may not be compared with a sonnet of\r\nWordsworth; but it is good, honest sentiment expressed in such a melodious\r\nway that we like to read it, and feel better after the reading. In the next\r\nstanza, however, Byron grows commonplace and ends with:\r\n\r\n  Sweet is revenge, especially to women,\r\n  Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.\r\n\r\nAnd that is bad sentiment and worse rime, without any resemblance to\r\npoetry. The remaining stanzas are mere drivel, unworthy of the poet's\r\ntalent or of the reader's patience.\r\n\r\nIt is so with a large part of Byron's work; it often begins well, and\r\nusually has some vivid description of nature, or some gallant passage in\r\nswinging verse, which stirs us like martial music; then the poem falls to\r\nearth like a stone, and presently appears some wretched pun or jest or\r\nscurrility. Our present remedy lies in a book of selections, in which we\r\ncan enjoy the poetry without being unpleasantly reminded of the author's\r\nbesetting sins of flippancy and bad taste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MANFRED]\r\n\r\nOf the longer poems of Byron, which took all Europe by storm, only three or\r\nfour are memorable. _Manfred_ (1817) is a dramatic poem, in which the\r\nauthor's pride, his theatric posing, his talent for rhythmic expression,\r\nare all seen at their worst or best. The mysterious hero of the poem lives\r\nin a gloomy castle under the high Alps, but he is seldom found under roof.\r\nInstead he wanders amidst storms and glaciers, holding communion with\r\npowers of darkness, forever voicing his rebellion, his boundless pride, his\r\nbottomless remorse. Nobody knows what the rebellion and the remorse are all\r\nabout. Some readers may tire of the shadowy hero's egoism, but few will\r\nfail to be impressed by the vigor of the verse, or by the splendid\r\nreflection of picturesque scenes. And here and there is a lyric that seems\r\nto set itself to music.\r\n\r\n  Mont Blanc is the monarch of mountains,\r\n    They crowned him long ago\r\n  On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,\r\n    With a diadem of snow\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWSTEAD ABBEY AND BYRON OAK]\r\n\r\n_Cain_ (1821) is another dramatic poem, reflecting the rebellion of\r\nanother hero, or rather the same hero, who appears this time as the elder\r\nson of Adam. After murdering his brother, the hero takes guidance of\r\nLucifer and explores hell; where, instead of repentance, he finds occasion\r\nto hate almost everything that is dear to God or man. The drama is a kind\r\nof gloomy parody of Milton's _Paradise Lost_, as _Manfred_ is a\r\nparody of Goethe's _Faust_. Both dramas are interesting, aside from\r\ntheir poetic passages, as examples of the so-called Titan literature, to\r\nwhich we shall presently refer in our study of Shelley's _Prometheus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHILDE HAROLD]\r\n\r\nThe most readable work of Byron is _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_, a\r\nbrilliant narrative poem, which reflects the impressions of another\r\nmisanthropic hero in presence of the romantic scenery of the Continent. It\r\nwas the publication of the first two cantos of this poem in 1812, that made\r\nByron the leading figure in English poetry, and these cantos are still\r\nwidely read as a kind of poetic guidebook. To many readers, however, the\r\nthird and fourth cantos are more sincere and more pleasurable. The most\r\nmemorable parts of _Childe Harold_ are the \"Farewell\" in the first\r\ncanto, \"Waterloo\" in the third, and \"Lake Leman,\" \"Venice,\" \"Rome,\" \"The\r\nColiseum\", \"The Dying Gladiator\" and \"The Ocean\" in the fourth. When one\r\nhas read these magnificent passages he has the best of which Byron was\r\ncapable. We have called _Childe Harold_ the most readable of Byron's\r\nworks, but those who like a story will probably be more interested in\r\n_Mazeppa_ and _The Prisoner of Chillon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE OF CHILLON]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BYRONIC HERO]\r\n\r\nOne significant quality of these long poems is that they are intensely\r\npersonal, voicing one man's remorse or rebellion, and perpetually repeating\r\nhis \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!\" They are concerned with the same\r\nhero (who is Byron under various disguises) and they picture him as a\r\nproud, mysterious stranger, carelessly generous, fiendishly wicked,\r\nprofoundly melancholy, irresistibly fascinating to women. Byron is credited\r\nwith the invention of this hero, ever since called Byronic; but in truth\r\nthe melodramatic outcast was a popular character in fiction long before\r\nByron adopted him, gave him a new dress and called him Manfred or Don Juan.\r\nA score of romances (such as Mrs. Radcliffe's _The Italian_ in\r\nEngland, and Charles Brockden Brown's _Wieland_ in America) had used\r\nthe same hero to add horror to a grotesque tale; Scott modified him\r\nsomewhat, as the Templar in _Ivanhoe_, for example; and Byron made him\r\nmore real by giving him the revolutionary spirit, by employing him to voice\r\nthe rebellion against social customs which many young enthusiasts felt so\r\nstrongly in the early part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TWO VIEWS OF BYRON]\r\n\r\nThe vigor of this stage hero, his rebellious spirit, his picturesque\r\nadventures, the gaudy tinsel (mistaken for gold) in which he was\r\ndressed,--all this made a tremendous impression in that romantic age.\r\nGoethe called Byron \"the prince of modern poetry, the most talented and\r\nimpressive figure which the literary world has ever produced\"; and this\r\nunbalanced judgment was shared by other critics on the Continent, where\r\nByron is still regarded as one of the greatest of English poets.\r\n\r\nSwinburne, on the other hand, can hardly find words strong enough to\r\nexpress his contempt for the \"blare and brassiness\" of Byron; but that also\r\nis an exaggeration. Though Byron is no longer a popular hero, and though\r\nhis work is more rhetorical than poetical, we may still gladly acknowledge\r\nthe swinging rhythm, the martial dash and vigor of his best verse. Also,\r\nremembering the Revolution, we may understand the dazzling impression which\r\nhe made upon the poets of his day. When the news came from Greece that his\r\nmeteoric career was ended, the young Tennyson wept passionately and went\r\nout to carve on a stone, \"Byron is dead,\" as if poetry had perished with\r\nhim. Even the coldly critical Matthew Arnold was deeply moved to write:\r\n\r\n  When Byron's eyes were closed in death\r\n     We bowed our head, and held our breath.\r\n  He taught us little, but our soul\r\n     Had _felt_ him like the thunder roll.\r\n\r\n    LIFE OF SHELLEY. The career of Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) is,\r\n    in comparison with that of Byron, as a will-o'-the-wisp to a\r\n    meteor. Byron was of the earth earthy; he fed upon coarse food,\r\n    shady adventures, scandal, the limelight; but Shelley\r\n\r\n      Seemed nourished upon starbeams, and the stuff\r\n      Of rainbows and the tempest and the foam.\r\n\r\n    He was a delicate child, shy, sensitive, elflike, who wandered\r\n    through the woods near his home, in Sussex, on the lookout for\r\n    sprites and hobgoblins. His reading was of the wildest kind; and\r\n    when he began the study of chemistry he was forever putting\r\n    together things that made horrible smells or explosions, in\r\n    expectation that the genii of the _Arabian Nights_ would rise\r\n    from the smoke of his test tube.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A YOUNG REBEL]\r\n\r\n    At Eton the boy promptly rebelled against the brutal fagging\r\n    system, then tolerated in all English schools. He was presently in\r\n    hot water, and the name \"Mad Shelley,\" which the boys gave him,\r\n    followed him through life. He had been in the university (Oxford)\r\n    hardly two years when his head was turned by some book of shallow\r\n    philosophy, and he printed a rattle-brained tract called \"The\r\n    Necessity of Atheism.\" This got him into such trouble with the Dons\r\n    that he was expelled for insubordination.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE WIND AND THE WHIRLWIND]\r\n\r\n    Forthwith Shelley published more tracts of a more rebellious kind.\r\n    His sister Helen put them into the hands of her girl friend,\r\n    Harriet Westbrook, who showed her belief in revolutionary theories\r\n    by running away from school and parental discipline and coming to\r\n    Shelley for \"protection.\" These two social rebels, both in the\r\n    green-apple stage (their combined age was thirty-five), were\r\n    presently married; not that either of them believed in marriage,\r\n    but because they were compelled by \"Anarch Custom.\"\r\n\r\n    After some two years of a wandering, will-o'-the-wisp life, Shelley\r\n    and his wife were estranged and separated. The young poet then met\r\n    a certain William Godwin, known at that time as a novelist and\r\n    evolutionary philosopher, and showed his appreciation of Godwin's\r\n    radical teaching by running away with his daughter Mary, aged\r\n    seventeen. The first wife, tired of liberalism, drowned herself,\r\n    and Shelley was plunged into remorse at the tragedy. The right to\r\n    care for his children was denied him, as an improper person, and he\r\n    was practically driven out of England by force of that public\r\n    opinion which he had so frequently outraged or defied.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY]\r\n\r\n    Life is a good teacher, though stern in its reckoning, and in Italy\r\n    life taught Shelley that the rights and beliefs of other men were\r\n    no less sacred than his own. He was a strange combination of hot\r\n    head and kind heart, the one filled with wild social theories, the\r\n    other with compassion for humanity. He was immensely generous with\r\n    his friends, and tender to the point of tears at the thought of\r\n    suffering men,--not real men, such as he met in the streets (even\r\n    the beggars in Italy are cheerful), but idealized men, with\r\n    mysterious sorrows, whom he met in the clouds. While in England his\r\n    weak head had its foolish way, and his early poems, such as\r\n    _Queen Mab_, are violent declamations. In Italy his heart had\r\n    its day, and his later poems, such as _Adonais_ and\r\n    _Prometheus Unbound_, are rhapsodies ennobled by Shelley's\r\n    love of beauty and by his unquenchable hope that a bright day of\r\n    justice must soon dawn upon the world. He was drowned (1822) while\r\n    sailing his boat off the Italian coast, before he had reached the\r\n    age of thirty years.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF SHELLEY. In the longer poems of Shelley there are two\r\nprominent elements, and two others less conspicuous but more important. The\r\nfirst element is revolt. The poet was violently opposed to the existing\r\norder of society, and lost no opportunity to express his hatred of Tyranny,\r\nwhich was Shelley's name for what sober men called law and order. Feeding\r\nhis spirit of revolution were numerous anarchistic theories, called the new\r\nphilosophy, which had this curious quality: that they hotly denied the old\r\nfaith, law, morality, as other men formulated such matters, and fervently\r\nbelieved any quack who appeared with a new nostrum warranted to cure all\r\nsocial disorders.\r\n\r\nThe second obvious element in Shelley's poetry is his love of beauty, not\r\nthe common beauty of nature or humanity which Wordsworth celebrated, but a\r\nstrange \"supernal\" beauty with no \"earthly\" quality or reality. His best\r\nlines leave a vague impression of something beautiful and lovely, but we\r\nknow not what it is.\r\n\r\nLess conspicuous in Shelley's poems are the sense of personal loss or grief\r\nwhich pervades them, and the exquisite melody of certain words which he\r\nused for their emotional effect rather than to convey any definite meaning.\r\nLike Byron he sang chiefly of his own feelings, his rage or despair, his\r\nsorrow or loneliness. He reflected his idea of the origin and motive of\r\nlyric poesy in the lines:\r\n\r\n                 Most wretched men\r\n  Are cradled into poetry by wrong;\r\n  They learn in suffering what they teach in song,--\r\n\r\nan idea which Poe adopted in its entirety, and which Heine expressed in a\r\nsentimental lyric, telling how from his great grief he made his little\r\nsongs:\r\n\r\n  Aus meinen groszen Schmerzen\r\n  Mach' ich die kleinen Lieder.\r\n\r\nHardly another English poet uses words so musically as Shelley (witness\r\n\"The Cloud\" and \"The Skylark\"), and here again his idea of verbal melody\r\nwas carried to an extreme by Poe, in whose poetry words are used not so\r\nmuch to express ideas as to awaken vague emotions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALASTOR]\r\n\r\nAll the above-named qualities appear in _Alastor_ (the Spirit of\r\nSolitude), which is less interesting as a poem than as a study of Shelley.\r\nIn this poem we may skip the revolt, which is of no consequence, and follow\r\nthe poet in his search for a supernally lovely maiden who shall satisfy his\r\nlove for ideal beauty. To find her he goes, not among human habitations,\r\nbut to gloomy forests, dizzy cliffs, raging torrents, tempest-blown\r\nseashore,--to every place where a maiden in her senses would not be. Such\r\nplaces, terrible or picturesque, are but symbols of the poet's soul in its\r\nsuffering and loneliness. He does not find his maiden (and herein we read\r\nthe poet's first confession that he has failed in life, that the world is\r\ntoo strong for him); but he sees the setting moon, and somehow that pale\r\ncomforter brings him peace with death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROMETHEUS]\r\n\r\nIn _Prometheus Unbound_ Shelley uses the old myth of the Titan who\r\nrebelled against the tyranny of the gods, and who was punished by being\r\nchained to a rock. [Footnote: The original tragedy of _Prometheus\r\nBound_ was written by Æschylus, a famous old Greek dramatist. The same\r\npoet wrote also _Prometheus Unbound_, but the latter drama has been\r\nlost. Shelley borrowed the idea of his poem from this lost drama.] In this\r\npoem Prometheus (man) is represented as being tortured by Jove (law or\r\ncustom) until he is released by Demogorgon (progress or necessity);\r\nwhereupon he marries Asia (love or goodness), and stars and moon break out\r\ninto a happy song of redemption.\r\n\r\nObviously there is no reality or human interest in such a fantasy. The only\r\npleasurable parts of the poem are its detached passages of great melody or\r\nbeauty; and the chief value of the work is as a modern example of Titan\r\nliterature. Many poets have at various times represented mankind in the\r\nperson of a Titan, that is, a man written large, colossal in his courage or\r\npower or suffering: Æschylus in _Prometheus_, Marlowe in\r\n_Tamburlaine_, Milton in Lucifer, of _Paradise Lost_, Goethe in\r\n_Faust_, Byron in _Manfred_, Shelley in _Prometheus\r\nUnbound_. The Greek Titan is resigned, uncomplaining, knowing himself to\r\nbe a victim of Fate, which may not be opposed; Marlowe's Titan is bombastic\r\nand violent; Milton's is ambitious, proud, revengeful; Goethe's is cultured\r\nand philosophical; Byron's is gloomy, rebellious, theatrical. So all these\r\npoets portray each his own bent of mind, and something also of the temper\r\nof the age, in the character of his Titan. The significance of Shelley's\r\npoem is in this: that his Titan is patient and hopeful, trusting in the\r\nspirit of Love to redeem mankind from all evil. Herein Shelley is far\r\nremoved from the caviling temper of his fellow rebel Byron. He celebrates a\r\ngolden age not of the past but of the future, when the dream of justice\r\ninspired by the French Revolution shall have become a glorious reality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS BEST POEMS]\r\n\r\nThese longer poems of Shelley are read by the few; they are too vague, with\r\ntoo little meaning or message, for ordinary readers who like to understand\r\nas well as to enjoy poetry. To such readers the only interesting works of\r\nShelley are a few shorter poems: \"The Cloud,\" \"To a Skylark,\" \"Ode to the\r\nWest Wind,\" \"Indian Serenade,\" \"A Lament,\" \"When the Lamp is Lighted\" and\r\nsome parts of _Adonais_ (a beautiful elegy in memory of Keats), such\r\nas the passage beginning, \"Go thou to Rome.\" For splendor of imagination\r\nand for melody of expression these poems have few peers and no superiors in\r\nEnglish literature. To read them is to discover that Shelley was at times\r\nso sensitive, so responsive to every harmony of nature, that he seemed like\r\nthe poet of Alastor,\r\n\r\n  A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings\r\n  The breath of Heaven did wander.\r\n\r\nThe breath of heaven is constant, but lutes and strings are variable\r\nmatters of human arrangement. When Shelley's lute was tuned to nature it\r\nbrought forth aerial melody; when he strained its strings to voice some\r\nsocial rebellion or anarchistic theory it produced wild discord.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN KEATS (1795-1821)\r\n\r\n  A thing of beauty is a joy forever:\r\n  Its loveliness increases; it will never\r\n  Pass into nothingness, but still will keep\r\n  A bower quiet for us, and a sleep\r\n  Full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing.\r\n\r\nThe above lines, from _Endymion_, reflect the ideal of the young\r\nsinger whom we rank with the best poets of the nineteenth century. Unlike\r\nother romanticists of that day, he seems to have lived for poetry alone and\r\nto have loved it for its own sake, as we love the first spring flowers. His\r\nwork was shamefully treated by reviewers; it was neglected by the public;\r\nbut still he wrote, trying to make each line perfect, in the spirit of\r\nthose medieval workmen who put their hearts into a carving that would rest\r\non some lofty spire far above the eyes of men. To reverence beauty wherever\r\nhe found it, and then in gratitude to produce a new work of beauty which\r\nshould live forever,--that was Keats's only aim. It is the more wonderful\r\nin view of his humble origin, his painful experience, his tragic end.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Only twenty-five years of life, which included seven years of\r\n    uncongenial tasks, and three of writing, and three of wandering in\r\n    search of health,--that sums up the story of Keats. He was born in\r\n    London; he was the son of a hostler; his home was over the stable;\r\n    his playground was the dirty street. The family prospered, moved to\r\n    a better locality, and the children were sent to a good school.\r\n    Then the parents died, and at fifteen Keats was bound out to a\r\n    surgeon and apothecary. For four years he worked as an apprentice,\r\n    and for three years more in a hospital; then, for his heart was\r\n    never in the work, he laid aside his surgeon's kit, resolving never\r\n    to touch it again.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TWO POETIC IDEALS]\r\n\r\n    Since childhood he had been a reader, a dreamer, but not till a\r\n    volume of Spenser's _Faery Queen_ was put into his hands did\r\n    he turn with intense eagerness to poetry. The influence of that\r\n    volume is seen in the somewhat monotonous sweetness of his early\r\n    work. Next he explored the classics (he had read Virgil in the\r\n    original, but he knew no Greek), and the joy he found in Chapman's\r\n    translation of Homer is reflected in a noble sonnet. From that time\r\n    on he was influenced by two ideals which he found in Greek and\r\n    medieval literature, the one with its emphasis on form, the other\r\n    with its rich and varied coloring.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN KEATS]\r\n\r\n    During the next three years Keats published three small volumes,\r\n    his entire life's work. These were brutally criticized by literary\r\n    magazines; they met with ridicule at the hands of Byron, with\r\n    indifference on the part of Scott and Wordsworth. The pathetic\r\n    legend that the poet's life was shortened by this abuse is still\r\n    repeated, but there is little truth in it. Keats held manfully to\r\n    his course, having more weighty things than criticism to think\r\n    about. He was conscious that his time was short; he was in love\r\n    with his Fannie Brawne, but separated from her by illness and\r\n    poverty; and, like the American poet Lanier, he faced death across\r\n    the table as he wrote. To throw off the consumption which had\r\n    fastened upon him he tried to live in the open, making walking\r\n    trips in the Lake Region; but he met with rough fare and returned\r\n    from each trip weaker than before. He turned at last to Italy,\r\n    dreading the voyage and what lay beyond. Night fell as the ship put\r\n    to sea; the evening star shone clear through the storm clouds, and\r\n    Keats sent his farewell to life and love and poetry in the sonnet\r\n    beginning:\r\n\r\n      Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art.\r\n\r\n    He died soon after his arrival in Rome, in 1821. Shelley, who had\r\n    hailed Keats as a genius, and who had sent a generous invitation to\r\n    come and share his home, commemorated the poet's death and the\r\n    world's loss in _Adonais_, which ranks with Milton's\r\n    _Lycidas_, Tennyson's _In Memoriam_ and Emerson's\r\n    _Threnody_ among the great elegiac poems of our literature.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF KEATS. The first small volume of Keats (_Poems_, 1817)\r\nseems now like an experiment. The part of that experiment which we cherish\r\nabove all others is the sonnet \"On Chapman's Homer,\" which should be read\r\nentire for its note of joy and for its fine expression of the influence of\r\nclassic poetry. The second volume, _Endymion_, may be regarded as a\r\npromise. There is little reality in the rambling poem which gives title to\r\nthe volume (the story of a shepherd beloved of a moon-goddess), but the\r\nbold imagery of the work, its Spenserian melody, its passages of rare\r\nbeauty,--all these speak of a true poet who has not yet quite found himself\r\nor his subject. A third volume, _Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes\r\nand Other Poems_ (1820), is in every sense a fulfillment, for it\r\ncontains a large proportion of excellent poetry, fresh, vital, melodious,\r\nwhich improves with years, and which carries on its face the stamp of\r\npermanency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS BEST POEMS]\r\n\r\nThe contents of this little volume may be arranged, not very accurately, in\r\nthree classes, In the first are certain poems that by their perfection of\r\nform show the Greek or classic spirit. Best known of these poems are the\r\nfragment \"Hyperion,\" with its Milton-like nobility of style, and \"Lamia,\"\r\nwhich is the story of an enchantress whom love transforms into a beautiful\r\nwoman, but who quickly vanishes because of her lover's too great\r\ncuriosity,--a parable, perhaps, of the futility of science and philosophy,\r\nas Keats regarded them.\r\n\r\nOf the poems of the second class, which reflect old medieval legends, \"The\r\nPot of Basil,\" \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" are\r\npraised by poets and critics alike. \"St. Agnes,\" which reflects a vague\r\nlonging rather than a story, is the best known; but \"La Belle Dame\" may\r\nappeal to some readers as the most moving of Keats's poems. The essence of\r\nall old metrical romances is preserved in a few lines, which have an added\r\npersonal interest from the fact that they may reveal something of the\r\npoet's sad love story.\r\n\r\nIn the third class are a few sonnets and miscellaneous poems, all permeated\r\nby the sense of beauty, showing in every line the genius of Keats and his\r\nexquisite workmanship. The sonnets \"On the Sea,\" \"When I have Fears,\" \"On\r\nthe Grasshopper and Cricket\" and \"To Sleep\"; the fragment beginning \"In a\r\ndrear-nighted December\"; the marvelous odes \"On a Grecian Urn,\" \"To a\r\nNightingale\" and \"To Autumn,\" in which he combines the simplicity of the\r\nold classics with the romance and magic of medieval writers,--there are no\r\nworks in English of a similar kind that make stronger appeal to our ideal\r\nof poetry and of verbal melody. Into the three stanzas of \"Autumn,\" for\r\nexample, Keats has compressed the vague feelings of beauty, of melancholy,\r\nof immortal aspiration, which come to sensitive souls in the \"season of\r\nmists and mellow fruitfulness.\" It may be compared, or rather contrasted,\r\nwith another poem on the same subject which voices the despair in the heart\r\nof the French poet Verlaine, who hears \"the sobbing of the violins of\r\nautumn\":\r\n\r\n  Les sanglots longs\r\n  Des violons\r\n      De l'automne\r\n  Blessent mon coeur\r\n  D'une langueur\r\n      Monotone.\r\n\r\nKEATS: AN ESSAY OF CRITICISM. Beyond recommending a few of his poems for\r\ntheir beauty, there is really so little to be said of Keats that critics\r\nare at their wit's end to express their appreciation. So we read of Keats's\r\n\"pure aestheticism,\" his \"copious perfection,\" his \"idyllic visualization,\"\r\nhis \"haunting poignancy of feeling,\" his \"subtle felicities of diction,\"\r\nhis \"tone color,\" and more to the same effect. Such criticisms are\r\ndoubtless well meant, but they are harder to follow than Keats's\r\n\"Endymion\"; and that is no short or easy road of poesy. Perhaps by trying\r\nmore familiar ways we may better understand Keats, why he appeals so\r\nstrongly to poets, and why he is so seldom read by other people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SENSE OF BEAUTY]\r\n\r\nThe first characteristic of the man was his love for every beautiful thing\r\nhe saw or heard. Sometimes the object which fascinated him was the\r\nwidespread sea or a solitary star; sometimes it was the work of man, the\r\nproduct of his heart and brain attuned, such as a passage from Homer, a\r\nlegend of the Middle Ages, a vase of pure lines amid the rubbish of a\r\nmuseum, like a bird call or the scent of violets in a city street. Whatever\r\nthe object that aroused his sense of beauty, he turned aside to stay with\r\nit a while, as on the byways of Europe you will sometimes see a man lay\r\ndown his burden and bare his head before a shrine that beckons him to pray.\r\nWith this reverence for beauty Keats had other and rarer qualities: the\r\npower to express what he felt, the imagination which gave him beautiful\r\nfigures, and the taste which enabled him to choose the finest words, the\r\nmost melodious phrases, wherewith to reflect his thought or mood or\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the power of Keats, to be simple and reverent in the presence of\r\nbeauty, and to give his feeling poetic or imaginative expression. In\r\nrespect of such power he probably had no peer in English literature. His\r\nlimitations were twofold: he looked too exclusively on the physical side of\r\nbeauty, and he lived too far removed from the common, wholesome life of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SENSE AND SOUL]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate our criticism: that man whom we saw by the wayside shrine\r\nacknowledged the presence of some spiritual beauty and truth, the beauty of\r\nholiness, the ineffable loveliness of God. So the man who trains a child,\r\nor gives thanks for a friend, or remembers his mother, is always at heart a\r\nlover of beauty,--the moral beauty of character, of comradeship, of\r\nself-sacrifice. But the poetry of Keats deals largely with outward matters,\r\nwith form, color, melody, odors, with what is called \"sensuous\" beauty\r\nbecause it delights our human senses. Such beauty is good, but it is not\r\nsupreme. Moreover, the artist who would appeal widely to men must by\r\nsympathy understand their whole life, their mirth as well as their sorrow,\r\ntheir days of labor, their hours of play, their moments of worship. But\r\nKeats, living apart with his ideal of beauty, like a hermit in his cell,\r\nwas able to understand and to voice only one of the profound interests of\r\nhumanity. For this reason, and because of the deep note of sadness which\r\nsounds through all his work like the monotone of the sea, his exquisite\r\npoems have never had any general appreciation. Like Spenser, who was his\r\nfirst master, he is a poet's poet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMINOR POETS OF ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\nIn the early nineteenth century the Literary Annuals appeared, took root\r\nand flourished mightily in England and America. These annuals (such a\r\nvigorous crop should have been called hardy annuals) were collections of\r\ncontemporary prose or verse that appeared once a year under such\r\nsentimental names as \"Friendship's Offering,\" \"The Token\" and \"The\r\nGarland.\" That they were sold in large numbers on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic speaks of the growing popular interest in literature. Moreover,\r\nthey served an excellent purpose at a time when books and libraries were\r\nless accessible than they are now. They satisfied the need of ordinary\r\nreaders for poetry and romance; they often made known to the world a\r\ntalented author, who found in public approval that sweet encouragement\r\nwhich critics denied him; they made it unlikely that henceforth \"some mute,\r\ninglorious Milton\" should remain either mute or inglorious; and they not\r\nonly preserved the best work of minor poets but, what is much better, they\r\ngave it a wide reading.\r\n\r\nThanks to such collections, from which every newspaper filled its Poet's\r\nCorner, good poems which else might have hid their little light under a\r\nbushel--Campbell's \"Hohenlinden,\" Mrs. Hemans' \"Landing of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers,\" Hunt's \"Abou ben Adhem,\" Hood's \"The Song of the Shirt,\" and many\r\nothers--are now as widely known as are the best works of Wordsworth or\r\nByron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIGH HUNT]\r\n\r\nWe can name only a few poets of the age, leaving the reader to form\r\nacquaintance with their songs in an anthology. Especially worthy of\r\nremembrance are: Thomas Campbell, who greatly influenced the American poets\r\nHalleck and Drake; Thomas Moore, whose _Irish Melodies_ have an\r\nattractive singing quality; James Hogg (The Ettrick Shepherd); John Keble,\r\nauthor of _The Christian Year_; Thomas Hood; Felicia Hemans; and Leigh\r\nHunt, whose encouragement of Keats is as memorable as his \"Abou ben Adhem\"\r\nor \"The Glove and the Lions.\" There are other poets of equal rank with\r\nthose we have ventured to name, and their melodious quality is such that a\r\nmodern critic has spoken of them, in terms commonly applied to the\r\nElizabethans, as \"a nest of singing birds\"; which would be an excellent\r\nfigure if we could forget the fact that birds in a nest never sing. Their\r\nwork is perhaps less imaginative (and certainly less fantastic) than that\r\nof Elizabethan singers, but it comes nearer to present life and reality.\r\n\r\nOne of the least known of these minor poets, Thomas Beddoes, was gifted in\r\na way to remind us of the strange genius of Blake. He wrote not much, his\r\nlife being too broken and disappointed; but running through his scanty\r\nverse is a thread of the pure gold of poetry. In a single stanza of his\r\n\"Dream Pedlary\" he has reflected the spirit of the whole romantic movement:\r\n\r\n  If there were dreams to sell,\r\n       What would you buy?\r\n  Some cost a passing bell,\r\n       Some a light sigh\r\n  That shakes from Life's fresh crown\r\n  Only a rose leaf down.\r\n  If there were dreams to sell,\r\n  Merry and sad to tell,\r\n  And the crier rang the bell,\r\n      What would you buy?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF WALTER SCOTT (1771-1832)\r\n\r\nTo read Scott is to read Scotland. Of no other modern author can it so\r\nfreely be said that he gave to literature a whole country, its scenery, its\r\npeople, its history and traditions, its ideals of faith and courage and\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nThat is a large achievement, but that is not all. It was Scott, more than\r\nany other author, who brought poetry and romance home to ordinary readers;\r\nand with romance came pleasure, wholesome and refreshing as a drink from a\r\nliving spring. When he began to write, the novel was in a sad\r\nstate,--sentimental, sensational, fantastic, devoted to what Charles Lamb\r\ndescribed as wildly improbable events and to characters that belong neither\r\nto this world nor to any other conceivable one. When his work was done, the\r\nnovel had been raised to its present position as the most powerful literary\r\ninfluence that bears upon the human mind. Among novelists, therefore, Scott\r\ndeserves his title of \"the first of the modern race of giants.\"\r\n\r\n    LIFE. To his family, descendants of the old Borderers, Scott owed\r\n    that intensely patriotic quality which glows in all his work. He is\r\n    said to have borne strong resemblance to his grandfather, \"Old\r\n    Bardie Scott,\" an unbending clansman who vowed never to cut his\r\n    beard till a Stuart prince came back to the throne. The clansmen\r\n    were now citizens of the Empire, but their loyalty to hereditary\r\n    chiefs is reflected in Scott's reverence for everything pertaining\r\n    to rank or royalty.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FIRST IMPRESSIONS]\r\n\r\n    He was born (1771) in Edinburgh, but his early associations were\r\n    all of the open country. Some illness had left him lame of foot,\r\n    and with the hope of a cure he was sent to relatives at Sandy\r\n    Knowe. There in the heart of the Border he spent his days on the\r\n    hills with the shepherds, listening to Scottish legends. At bedtime\r\n    his grandmother told him tales of the clans; and when he could read\r\n    for himself he learned by heart Percy's _Reliques of Ancient\r\n    Poetry_. So the scenes which he loved because of their wild\r\n    beauty became sacred because of their historical association. Even\r\n    in that early day his heart had framed the sentiment which found\r\n    expression in his _Lay of the Last Minstrel_:\r\n\r\n      Breathes there the man with soul so dead,\r\n      Who never to himself hath said:\r\n            This is my own, my native land?\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WORK AND PLAY]\r\n\r\n    At school, and at college at Edinburgh, the boy's heart was never\r\n    in his books, unless perchance they contained something of the\r\n    tradition of Scotland. After college he worked in his father's law\r\n    office, became an advocate, and for twenty years followed the law.\r\n    His vacations were spent \"making raids,\" as he said, into the\r\n    Highlands, adding to his enormous store of old tales and ballads. A\r\n    companion on one of these trips gives us a picture of the man:\r\n\r\n        \"Eh me, sic an endless fund o' humour and drollery as he\r\n        had wi' him! Never ten yards but we were either laughing or\r\n        roaring and singing. Whenever we stopped, how brawlie he\r\n        suited himsel' to everybody! He aye did as the lave did;\r\n        never made himsel' the great man, or took ony airs in the\r\n        company.\"\r\n\r\n    This boyish delight in roaming, in new scenes, in new people met\r\n    frankly under the open sky, is characteristic of Scott's poems and\r\n    novels, which never move freely until they are out of doors. The\r\n    vigor of these works may be partially accounted for by the fact\r\n    that Scott was a hard worker and a hearty player,--a capital\r\n    combination.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS POEMS]\r\n\r\n    He was past thirty when he began to write. [Footnote: This refers\r\n    to original composition. In 1796 Scott published some translations\r\n    of German romantic ballads, and in 1802 his _Minstrelsy of the\r\n    Scottish Border_. The latter was a collection of old ballads, to\r\n    some of which Scott gave a more modern form.] By that time he had\r\n    been appointed Clerk of Sessions, and also Sheriff of Selkirkshire\r\n    (he took that hangman's job, and kept it even after he had won\r\n    fame, just for the money there was in it); and these offices,\r\n    together with his wife's dowry, provided a comfortable income. When\r\n    his first poem, _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_ (1805), met\r\n    with immense success he gladly gave up the law, and wrote\r\n    _Marmion_ (1808) and _The Lady of the Lake_ (1810). These\r\n    increased his good fortune; but his later poems were of inferior\r\n    quality, and met with a cool reception. Meanwhile Byron had\r\n    appeared to dazzle the reading public. Scott recognized the greater\r\n    poetic genius of the author of _Childe Harold_, and sought\r\n    another field where he was safe from all rivals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WALTER SCOTT]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FIRST ROMANCES]\r\n\r\n    Rummaging in a cabinet one day after some fishing tackle, he found\r\n    a manuscript long neglected and forgotten. Instead of going fishing\r\n    Scott read his manuscript, was fascinated by it, and presently\r\n    began to write in headlong fashion. In three weeks he added\r\n    sixty-five chapters to his old romance, and published it as\r\n    _Waverley_ (1814) without signing his name. Then he went away\r\n    on another \"raid\" to the Highlands. When he returned, at the end of\r\n    the summer, he learned that his book had made a tremendous\r\n    sensation, and that Fame, hat in hand, had been waiting at his door\r\n    for some weeks.\r\n\r\n    In the next ten years Scott won his name of \"the Wizard of the\r\n    North,\" for it seemed that only magic could produce stories of such\r\n    quality in such numbers: _Guy Mannering_, _Rob Roy_,\r\n    _Old Mortality_, _Redgauntlet_, _Heart of\r\n    Midlothian_, portraying the deathless romance of Scotland; and\r\n    _Ivanhoe_, _Kenilworth_, _The Talisman_ and other\r\n    novels which changed dull history to a drama of fascinating\r\n    characters. Not only England but the Continent hailed this\r\n    magnificent work with delight. Money and fame poured in upon the\r\n    author. Fortune appeared for once \"with both hands full.\" Then the\r\n    crash came.\r\n\r\n    To understand the calamity one must remember that Scott regarded\r\n    literature not as an art but as a profitable business; that he\r\n    aimed to be not a great writer but a lord of high degree. He had\r\n    been made a baronet, and was childishly proud of the title; his\r\n    work and his vast earnings were devoted to the dream of a feudal\r\n    house which should endure through the centuries and look back to\r\n    Sir Walter as its noble founder. While living modestly on his\r\n    income at Ashestiel he had used the earnings of his poems to buy a\r\n    rough farm at Clarty Hole, on the Tweed, and had changed its\r\n    unromantic name to Abbotsford. More land was rapidly added and\r\n    \"improved\" to make a lordly estate; then came the building of a\r\n    castle, where Scott entertained lavishly, as lavishly as any laird\r\n    or chieftain of the olden time, offering to all visitors \"the\r\n    honors of Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ABBOTSFORD]\r\n\r\n    Enormous sums were spent on this bubble, and still more money was\r\n    needed. To increase his income Scott went into secret partnership\r\n    with his publishers, indulged in speculative ventures, ran the firm\r\n    upon the shoals, drew large sums in advance of his earnings.\r\n    Suddenly came a business panic; the publishing firm failed\r\n    miserably, and at fifty five Scott, having too much honest pride to\r\n    take advantage of the bankruptcy laws, found himself facing a debt\r\n    of more than a hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS LAST YEARS]\r\n\r\n    His last years were spent in an heroic struggle to retrieve his\r\n    lost fortunes. He wrote more novels, but without much zest or\r\n    inspiration; he undertook other works, such as the voluminous\r\n    _Life of Napoleon_, for which he was hardly fitted, but which\r\n    brought him money in large measure. In four years he had repaid the\r\n    greater part of his debt, but mind and body were breaking under the\r\n    strain. When the end came, in 1832, he had literally worked himself\r\n    to death. The murmur of the Tweed over its shallows, music that he\r\n    had loved since childhood, was the last earthly sound of which he\r\n    was conscious. The house of Abbotsford, for which he had planned\r\n    and toiled, went into strange hands, and the noble family which he\r\n    had hoped to found died out within a few years. Only his work\r\n    remains, and that endures the wear of time and the tooth of\r\n    criticism.\r\n\r\nTHE POEMS OF SCOTT. Three good poems of Scott are _Marmion_, _The\r\nLay of the Last Minstrel_ and _The Lady of the Lake_; three others,\r\nnot so good, are _Rokeby_, _Vision of Don Roderick_ and _Lord\r\nof the Isles_. Among these _The Lady of the Lake_ is such a\r\nfavorite that, if one were to question the tourists who annually visit the\r\nTrossachs, a surprisingly large number of them would probably confess that\r\nthey were led not so much by love of natural beauty as by desire to visit\r\n\"Fair Ellen's Isle\" and other scenes which Scott has immortalized in verse.\r\n\r\nWe may as well admit frankly that even the best of these poems is not\r\nfirst-class; that it shows careless workmanship, and is lacking in the\r\nfiner elements of beauty and imagination. But Scott did not aim to create a\r\nwork of beauty; his purpose was to tell a good story, and in that he\r\nsucceeded. His _Lady of the Lake_, for example, has at least two\r\nvirtues: it holds the reader's attention; and it fulfills the first law of\r\npoetry, which is to give pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF THE POEMS]\r\n\r\nAnother charm of the poems, for young readers especially, is that they are\r\nsimple, vigorous, easily understood. Their rapid action and flying verse\r\nshow hardly a trace of conscious effort. Reading them is like sweeping\r\ndownstream with a good current, no labor required save for steering, and\r\nattention free for what awaits us around the next bend. When the bend is\r\npassed, Scott has always something new and interesting: charming scenery,\r\nheroic adventure, picturesque incidents (such as the flight of the Fiery\r\nCross to summon the clans), interesting fragments of folklore, and\r\noccasionally a ballad like \"Lochinvar,\" or a song like \"Bonnie Dundee,\"\r\nwhich stays with us as a happy memory long after the poem is forgotten.\r\n\r\nA secondary reason for the success of these poems was that they satisfied a\r\nfashion, very popular in Scott's day, which we have not yet outgrown. That\r\nfashion was to attribute chivalrous virtues to outlaws and other merry men,\r\nwho in their own day and generation were imprisoned or hanged, and who\r\ndeserved their fate. Robin Hood's gang, for example, or the Raiders of the\r\nBorder, were in fact a tough lot of thieves and cutthroats; but when they\r\nappeared in romantic literature they must of course appeal to ladies; so\r\nScott made them fine, dashing, manly fellows, sacrificing to the fashion of\r\nthe hour the truth of history and humanity. As Andrew Lang says:\r\n\r\n    \"In their own days the Border Riders were regarded as public\r\n    nuisances by statesmen, who attempted to educate them by means of\r\n    the gibbet. But now they were the delight of fine ladies,\r\n    contending who should be most extravagant in encomium. A blessing\r\n    on such fine ladies, who know what is good when they see it!\"\r\n    [Footnote: Quoted in Nicoll and Seccombe, _A History of English\r\n    Literature_, Vol. Ill, p. 957.]\r\n\r\nSCOTT'S NOVELS. To appreciate the value of Scott's work one should read\r\nsome of the novels that were fashionable in his day,--silly, sentimental\r\nnovels, portraying the \"sensibilities\" of imaginary ladies. [Footnote: In\r\nAmerica, Cooper's first romance, _Precaution_ (1820), was of this\r\nartificial type. After Scott's outdoor romances appeared, Cooper discovered\r\nhis talent, and wrote _The Spy_ and the Leather-Stocking tales. Maria\r\nEdgeworth and Jane Austen began to improve or naturalize the English novel\r\nbefore Scott attempted it.] That Scott was influenced by this inane fashion\r\nappears plainly in some of his characters, his fine ladies especially, who\r\npose and sentimentalize till we are mortally weary of them; but this\r\ninfluence passed when he discovered his real power, which was to portray\r\nmen and women in vigorous action. _Waverley_, _Rob Roy_,\r\n_Ivanhoe_, _Redgauntlet_,--such stories of brave adventure were\r\nlike the winds of the North, bringing to novel-readers the tang of the sea\r\nand the earth and the heather. They braced their readers for life, made\r\nthem feel their kinship with nature and humanity. Incidentally, they\r\nannounced that two new types of fiction, the outdoor romance and the\r\nhistorical novel, had appeared with power to influence the work of Cooper,\r\nThackeray, Dickens and a host of minor novelists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT WINDOW (MELROSE ABBEY)]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: GROUPS OF STORIES]\r\n\r\n    The most convenient way of dealing with Scott's works is to arrange\r\n    them in three groups. In the first are the novels of Scotland:\r\n    _Waverley_, dealing with the loyalty of the clans to the\r\n    Pretender; _Old Mortality_, with the faith and struggles of\r\n    the Covenanters; _Redgauntlet_, with the plots of the\r\n    Jacobites; _The Abbot_ and _The Monastery_, with the\r\n    traditions concerning Mary Queen of Scots; _Guy Mannering, The\r\n    Antiquary_ and _The Heart of Midlothian_, with private life\r\n    and humble Scottish characters.\r\n\r\n    In the second group are the novels which reveal the romance of\r\n    English history: _Ivanhoe_, dealing with Saxon and Norman in\r\n    the stormy days when Richard Lionheart returned to his kingdom;\r\n    _Kenilworth_, with the intrigues of Elizabeth's Court; _The\r\n    Fortunes of Nigel_, with London life in the days of Charles\r\n    First; _Woodstock_, with Cromwell's iron age; _Peveril of\r\n    the Peak_, with the conflict between Puritan and Cavalier during\r\n    the Restoration period.\r\n\r\n    In the third group are the novels which take us to foreign lands:\r\n    _Quentin Durward_, showing us the French court as dominated by\r\n    the cunning of Louis Eleventh, and _The Talisman_, dealing\r\n    with the Third Crusade.\r\n\r\n    In the above list we have named not all but only the best of\r\n    Scott's novels. They differ superficially, in scenes or incidents;\r\n    they are all alike in motive, which is to tell a tale of adventure\r\n    that shall be true to human nature, no matter what liberties it may\r\n    take with the facts of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF THE NOVELS]\r\n\r\nIn all these novels the faults are almost as numerous as the virtues; but\r\nwhile the faults appear small, having little influence on the final result,\r\nthe virtues are big, manly, wholesome,--such virtues as only the greatest\r\nwriters of fiction possess. Probably all Scott's faults spring from one\r\nfundamental weakness: he never had a high ideal of his own art. He wrote to\r\nmake money, and was inclined to regard his day's labor as \"so much\r\nscribbling.\" Hence his style is frequently slovenly, lacking vigor and\r\nconcentration; his characters talk too much, apparently to fill space; he\r\ncaters to the romantic fashion (and at the same time indulges his Tory\r\nprejudice) by enlarging on the somewhat imaginary virtues of knights,\r\nnobles, feudal or royal institutions, and so presents a one-sided view of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Scott strove to be true to the great movements of\r\nhistory, and to the moral forces which, in the end, prevail in all human\r\nactivity. His sympathies were broad; he mingled in comradeship with all\r\nclasses of society, saw the best in each; and from his observation and\r\nsympathy came an enormous number of characters, high or low, good or bad,\r\ngrave or ridiculous, but nearly all natural and human, because drawn from\r\nlife and experience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENE AND INCIDENT]\r\n\r\nAnother of Scott's literary virtues is his love of wild nature, which led\r\nhim to depict many grand or gloomy scenes, partly for their own sake, but\r\nlargely because they formed a fitting background for human action. Thus,\r\n_The Talisman_ opens with a pen picture of a solitary Crusader moving\r\nacross a sun-scorched desert towards a distant island of green. Every line\r\nin that description points to action, to the rush of a horseman from the\r\noasis, to the fierce trial of arms before the enemies speak truce and drink\r\ntogether from the same spring. Many another of Scott's descriptions of wild\r\nnature is followed by some gallant adventure, which we enjoy the more\r\nbecause we imagine that adventures ought to occur (though they seldom do)\r\namid romantic surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOTT'S TOMB IN DRYBURGH ABBEY]\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. At least one novel in each group should be read; but if it be\r\nasked, Which one? the answer is as much a matter of taste as of judgment.\r\nOf the novels dealing with Scottish life, _Waverley_, which was\r\nScott's first attempt, is still an excellent measure of his story-telling\r\ngenius; but there is more adventurous interest in _Old Mortality_ or\r\n_Rob Roy_; and in _The Heart of Midlothian_ (regarded by many as\r\nthe finest of Scott's works) one feels closer to nature and human nature,\r\nand especially to the heart of Scotland. _Ivanhoe_ is perhaps the best\r\nof the romances of English history; and of stories dealing with adventure\r\nin strange lands, _The Talisman_ will probably appeal strongest to\r\nyoung readers, and _Quentin Durward_ to their elders. To these may be\r\nadded _The Antiquary_, which is a good story, and which has an element\r\nof personal interest in that it gives us glimpses of Scott himself,\r\nsurrounded by old armor, old legends, old costumes,--mute testimonies to\r\nthe dreams and deeds of yesterday's men and women.\r\n\r\nSuch novels should be read once for the story, as Scott intended; and then,\r\nif one should grow weary of modern-problem novels, they may be read again\r\nfor their wholesome, bracing atmosphere, for their tenderness and wisdom,\r\nfor their wide horizons, for their joy of climbing to heights where we look\r\nout upon a glorious Present, and a yet more glorious Past that is not dead\r\nbut living.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOTHER FICTION WRITERS\r\n\r\nOf the work of Walter Scott we have already spoken. When such a genius\r\nappears, dominating his age, we think of him as a great inventor, and so he\r\nwas; but like most other inventors his trail had been blazed, his way\r\nprepared by others who had gone before him. His first romance,\r\n_Waverley_, shows the influence of earlier historical romances, such\r\nas Jane Porter's _Thaddeus of Warsaw_ and _Scottish Chiefs_; in\r\nhis later work he acknowledged his indebtedness to Maria Edgeworth, whose\r\n_Castle Rackrent_ had aroused enthusiasm at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. In brief, the romantic movement greatly encouraged\r\nfiction writing, and Scott did excellently what many others were doing\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nTwo things are noticeable as we review the fiction of this period: the\r\nfirst, that nearly all the successful writers were women; [Footnote: The\r\nlist includes: Fanny Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Jane Porter, Maria Edgeworth,\r\nSusan Ferrier, Sydney Owenson (Lady Morgan), Mary Brunton, Hannah More,\r\nMary Russell Mitford,--all of whom were famous in their day, and each of\r\nwhom produced at least one \"best seller\"] the second, that of these writers\r\nonly one, the most neglected by her own generation, holds a secure place in\r\nthe hearts of present-day readers. If it be asked why Jane Austen's works\r\nendure while others are forgotten, the answer is that almost any trained\r\nwriter can produce a modern romance, but it takes a genius to write a\r\nnovel. [Footnote: The difference between the modern romance and the novel\r\nis evident in the works of Scott and Miss Austen. Scott takes an unusual\r\nsubject, he calls up kings, nobles, chieftains, clansmen, robber barons,--a\r\nhost of picturesque characters; he uses his imagination freely, and makes a\r\nstory for the story's sake. Miss Austen takes an ordinary country village,\r\nobserves its people as through a microscope, and portrays them to the life.\r\nShe is not interested in making a thrilling story, but in showing us men\r\nand women as they are; and our interest is held by the verity of her\r\nportrayal. (For a different distinction between romance and novel, see \"THE\r\nEARLY ENGLISH NOVEL\" above, Chapter VI.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. HANNAH MORE]\r\n\r\nJANE AUSTEN. The rare genius of Miss Austen (1775-1817) was as a forest\r\nflower during her lifetime. While Fanny Burney, Jane Porter and Maria\r\nEdgeworth were widely acclaimed, this little woman remained almost unknown,\r\nfollowing no school of fiction, writing for her own pleasure, and\r\ndestroying whatever did not satisfy her own sense of fitness. If she had\r\nany theory of fiction, it was simply this: to use no incident but such as\r\nhad occurred before her eyes, to describe no scene that was not familiar,\r\nand to portray only such characters as she knew intimately, their speech,\r\ndress, manner, and the motives that governed their action. If unconsciously\r\nshe followed any rule of expression, it was that of Cowper, who said that\r\nto touch and retouch is the secret of almost all good writing. To her\r\ntheory and rule she added personal charm, intelligence, wit, genius of a\r\nhigh order. Neglected by her own generation, she has now an ever-widening\r\ncircle of readers, and is ranked by critics among the five or six greatest\r\nwriters of English fiction.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HER LIFE]\r\n\r\n    Jane Austen's life was short and extremely placid. She was born\r\n    (1775) in a little Hampshire village; she spent her entire life in\r\n    one country parish or another, varying the scene by an occasional\r\n    summer at the watering-place of Bath, which was not very exciting.\r\n    Her father was an easy-going clergyman who read Pope, avoided\r\n    politics, and left preaching to his curate. She was one of a large\r\n    family of children, who were brought up to regard elegance of\r\n    manner as a cardinal virtue, and vulgarity of any kind as the\r\n    epitome of the seven deadly sins. Her two brothers entered the\r\n    navy; hence the flutter in her books whenever a naval officer comes\r\n    on a furlough to his native village. She spent her life in homely,\r\n    pleasant duties, and did her writing while the chatter of family\r\n    life went on around her. Her only characters were visitors who came\r\n    to the rectory, or who gathered around the tea-table in a\r\n    neighbor's house. They were absolutely unconscious of the keen\r\n    scrutiny to which they were subjected; no one whispered to them, \"A\r\n    chiel's amang ye, takin' notes\"; and so they had no suspicion that\r\n    they were being transferred into books.\r\n\r\n    The first three of Miss Austen's novels were written at Steventon,\r\n    among her innocent subjects, but her precious manuscripts went\r\n    begging in vain for a publisher. [Footnote: _Northanger\r\n    Abbey_, _Pride and Prejudice_ and _Sense and\r\n    Sensibility_ were written between 1796 and 1799, when Jane\r\n    Austen had just passed her twenty-first year. Her first novel was\r\n    bought by a publisher who neglected to print it. The second could\r\n    not be sold till after the third was published, in 1811.] The last\r\n    three, reflecting as in a glass the manners of another parish, were\r\n    written at Chawton, near Winchester. Then the good work suddenly\r\n    began to flag. The same disease that, a little later, was to call\r\n    halt to Keats's poetry of beauty now made an end of Miss Austen's\r\n    portrayal of everyday life. When she died (1817) she was only\r\n    forty-two years old, and her heart was still that of a young girl.\r\n    A stained-glass window in beautiful old Winchester Cathedral speaks\r\n    eloquently of her life and work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOVELS AND CHARACTERS]\r\n\r\nIf we must recommend one of Miss Austen's novels, perhaps _Pride and\r\nPrejudice_ is the most typical; but there is very little to justify this\r\nchoice when the alternative is _Northanger Abbey_, or _Emma_, or\r\n_Sense and Sensibility_, or _Persuasion_, or _Mansfield\r\nPark_. All are good; the most definite stricture that one can safely\r\nmake is that _Mansfield Park_ is not so good as the others. Four of\r\nthe novels are confined to country parishes; but in _Northanger Abbey_\r\nand _Persuasion_ the horizon is broadened to include a watering place,\r\nwhither genteel folk went \"to take the air.\"\r\n\r\nThe characters of all these novels are: first, the members of five or six\r\nfamilies, with their relatives, who try to escape individual boredom by\r\ngregariousness; and second, more of the same kind assembled at a local fair\r\nor sociable. Here you meet a dull country squire or two, a feeble-minded\r\nbaronet, a curate laboriously upholding the burden of his dignity, a doctor\r\ntrying to hide his emptiness of mind by looking occupied, an uncomfortable\r\nmale person in tow of his wife, maiden aunts, fond mammas with their\r\nawkward daughters, chatterboxes, poor relations, spoiled children,--a\r\ncharacteristic gathering. All these, except the spoiled children, talk with\r\nperfect propriety about the weather. If in the course of a long day\r\nanything witty is said, it is an accident, a phenomenon; conversation\r\nhalts, and everybody looks at the speaker as if he must have had \"a rush of\r\nbrains to the head.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER SMALL FIELD]\r\n\r\nSuch is Jane Austen's little field, an eddy of life revolving endlessly\r\naround small parish interests. Her subjects are not even the whole parish,\r\nbut only \"the quality,\" whom the favored ones may meet at Mrs. B's\r\nafternoon at home. They read proper novels, knit wristlets, discuss fevers\r\nand their remedies, raise their eyebrows at gossip, connive at matrimony,\r\nand take tea. The workers of the world enter not here; neither do men of\r\nideas, nor social rebels, nor the wicked, nor the happily unworthy poor;\r\nand the parish is blessed in having no reformers.\r\n\r\nIn this barren field, hopeless to romancers like Scott, there never was\r\nsuch another explorer as Jane Austen. Her demure observation is marvelously\r\nkeen; sometimes it is mischievous, or even a bit malicious, but always\r\nsparkling with wit or running over with good humor. Almost alone in that\r\nromantic age she had no story to tell, and needed none. She had never met\r\nany heroes or heroines. Plots, adventures, villains, persecuted innocence,\r\nskeletons in closets,--all the ordinary machinery of fiction seemed to her\r\nabsurd and unnecessary. She was content to portray the life that she knew\r\nbest, and found it so interesting that, a century later, we share her\r\nenthusiasm. And that is the genius of Miss Austen, to interest us not by a\r\nromantic story but by the truth of her observation and by the fidelity of\r\nher portrayal of human nature, especially of feminine nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE ON ENGLISH FICTION]\r\n\r\nThere is one more thing to note in connection with Miss Austen's work;\r\nnamely, her wholesome influence on the English novel. In _Northanger\r\nAbbey_ and in _Sense and Sensibility_ she satirizes the popular\r\nromances of the period, with their Byronic heroes, melodramatic horrors and\r\nperpetual harping on some pale heroine's sensibilities. Her satire is\r\nperhaps the best that has been written on the subject, so delicate, so\r\nflashing, so keen, that a critic compares it to the exploit of Saladin (in\r\n_The Talisman_) who could not with his sword hack through an iron\r\nmace, as Richard did, but who accomplished the more difficult feat of\r\nslicing a gossamer veil as it floated in the air.\r\n\r\nSuch satire was not lost; yet it was Miss Austen's example rather than her\r\nprecept which put to shame the sentimental romances of her day, and which\r\ninfluenced subsequent English fiction in the direction of truth and\r\nnaturalness. Young people still prefer romance and adventure as portrayed\r\nby Scott and his followers, and that is as it should be; but an\r\nincreasingly large number of mature readers (especially those who are\r\ninterested in human nature) find a greater charm in the novel of characters\r\nand manners, as exemplified by Jane Austen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CRITICS AND ESSAYISTS\r\n\r\nFrom the seventeenth to the nineteenth century (or from Shakespeare to\r\nWordsworth) England was preparing a great literature; and then appeared\r\nwriters whose business or pleasure it was to appreciate that literature, to\r\npoint out its virtues or its defects, to explain by what principle this or\r\nthat work was permanent, and to share their enjoyment of good prose and\r\npoetry with others,--in a word, the critics.\r\n\r\nIn the list of such writers, who give us literature at second hand, the\r\nnames of Leigh Hunt, William Hazlitt, Walter Savage Landor, Charles Lamb\r\nand Thomas De Quincey are written large. The two last-named are selected\r\nfor special study, not because of their superior critical ability (for\r\nHazlitt was probably a better critic than either), but because of a few\r\nessays in which these men left us an appreciation of life, as they saw it\r\nfor themselves at first hand.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LAMB (1775-1834). There is a little book called _Essays of\r\nElia_ which stands out from all other prose works of the age. If we\r\nexamine this book to discover the source of its charm, we find it pervaded\r\nby a winsome \"human\" quality which makes us want to know the man who wrote\r\nit. In this respect Charles Lamb differs from certain of his\r\ncontemporaries. Wordsworth was too solitary, Coleridge and De Quincey too\r\nunbalanced, Shelley too visionary and Keats too aloof to awaken a feeling\r\nof personal allegiance; but the essays of Lamb reveal two qualities which,\r\nlike fine gold, are current among readers of all ages. These are sympathy\r\nand humor. By the one we enter understandingly into life, while the other\r\nkeeps us from taking life too tragically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES LAMB.\r\nFrom the engraving by S. Aslent Edwards]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS LIFE]\r\n\r\n    Lamb was born (1775) in the midst of London, and never felt at home\r\n    anywhere else. London is a world in itself, and of all its corners\r\n    there were only three that Lamb found comfortable. The first was\r\n    the modest little home where he lived with his gifted sister Mary,\r\n    reading with her through the long evenings, or tenderly caring for\r\n    her during a period of insanity; the second was the commercial\r\n    house where he toiled as a clerk; the third was the busy street\r\n    which lay between home and work,--a street forever ebbing and\r\n    flowing with a great tide of human life that affected Lamb\r\n    profoundly, mysteriously, as Wordsworth was affected by the hills\r\n    or the sea.\r\n\r\n    The boy's education began at Christ's Hospital, where he met\r\n    Coleridge and entered with him into a lifelong friendship. At\r\n    fifteen he left school to help support his family; and for the next\r\n    thirty-three years he was a clerk, first in the South Sea House,\r\n    then in the East India Company. Rather late in life he began to\r\n    write, his prime object being to earn a little extra money, which\r\n    he sadly needed. Then the Company, influenced partly by his\r\n    faithful service and partly by his growing reputation, retired him\r\n    on a pension. Most eagerly, like a boy out of school, he welcomed\r\n    his release, intending to do great things with his pen; but\r\n    curiously enough he wrote less, and less excellently, than before.\r\n    His decline began with his hour of liberty. For a time, in order\r\n    that his invalid sister might have quiet, he lived outside the\r\n    city, at Islington and Enfield; but he missed the work, the street,\r\n    the crowd, and especially did he miss his old habits. He had no\r\n    feeling for nature, nor for any art except that which he found in\r\n    old books. \"I hate the country,\" he wrote; and the cause of his\r\n    dislike was that, not knowing what to do with himself, he grew\r\n    weary of a day that was \"all day long.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAST INDIA HOUSE, LONDON\r\nWhere Charles Lamb worked for many years. From an engraving by\r\nM. Tombleson, after a drawing made by Thomas H Shepherd in 1829]\r\n\r\nThe earlier works of Lamb (some poems, a romance and a drama) are of little\r\ninterest except to critics. The first book that brought him any\r\nconsiderable recognition was the _Tales from Shakespeare_. This was a\r\nsummary of the stories used by Shakespeare in his plays, and was largely\r\nthe work of Mary Lamb, who had a talent for writing children's books. The\r\ncharm of the _Tales_ lies in the fact that the Lambs were so familiar\r\nwith old literature that they reproduced the stories in a style which might\r\nhave done credit to a writer in the days of Elizabeth. The book is still\r\nwidely read, and is as good as any other if one wants that kind of book.\r\nBut the chief thing in _Macbeth_ or _The Tempest_ is the poetry,\r\nnot the tale or the plot; and even if one wants only the story, why not get\r\nit from Shakespeare himself? Another and better book by Lamb of the same\r\ngeneral kind is _Specimens of English Dramatic Poets Contemporary with\r\nShakespeare_. In this book he saves us a deal of unprofitable reading by\r\ngathering together the best of the Elizabethan dramas, to which he adds\r\nsome admirable notes of criticism or interpretation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY LAMB\r\nAfter the portrait by F. S. Cary]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ESSAYS OF ELIA]\r\n\r\nMost memorable of Lamb's works are the essays which he contributed for many\r\nyears to the London magazines, and which he collected under the titles\r\n_Essays of Elia_ (1823) and _Last Essays of Elia_ (1830).\r\n[Footnote: The name \"Elia\" (pronounced ee'-li-ä) was a pseudonym, taken\r\nfrom an old Italian clerk (Ellia) in the South Sea House. When \"Elia\"\r\nappears in the _Essays_ he is Charles Lamb himself; \"Cousin Bridget\"\r\nis sister Mary, and \"John Elia\" is a brother. The last-named was a selfish\r\nkind of person, who seems to have lived for himself, letting Charles take\r\nall the care of the family.] To the question, Which of these essays should\r\nbe read? the answer given must depend largely upon personal taste. They are\r\nall good; they all contain both a reflection and a criticism of life, as\r\nLamb viewed it by light of his personal experience. A good way to read the\r\nessays, therefore, is to consider them as somewhat autobiographical, and to\r\nuse them for making acquaintance with the author at various periods of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor example, \"My Relations\" and \"Mackery End\" acquaint us with Lamb's\r\nfamily and descent; \"Old Benchers of the Inner Temple\" with his early\r\nsurroundings; \"Witches and Other Night-fears\" with his sensitive childhood;\r\n\"Recollections of Christ's Hospital\" and \"Christ's Hospital Five-and-thirty\r\nYears Ago\" with his school days and comradeship with Coleridge; \"The South\r\nSea House\" with his daily work; \"Old China\" with his home life; \"The\r\nSuperannuated Man\" with his feelings when he was retired on a pension; and\r\nfinally, \"Character of the Late Elia,\" in which Lamb whimsically writes his\r\nown obituary.\r\n\r\nIf these call for too much reading at first, then one may select three or\r\nfour typical essays: \"Dream Children,\" notable for its exquisite pathos;\r\n\"Dissertation on Roast Pig,\" famous for its peculiar humor; and \"Praise of\r\nChimney Sweepers,\" of which it is enough to say that it is just like\r\nCharles Lamb. To these one other should be added, \"Imperfect Sympathies,\"\r\nor \"A Chapter on Ears,\" or \"Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist,\" in order to\r\nappreciate how pleasantly Lamb could write on small matters of no\r\nconsequence. Still another good way of reading (which need not be\r\nemphasized, since everybody favors it) is to open the _Essays_ here or\r\nthere till we find something that interests us,--a method which allows\r\nevery reader the explorer's joy of discovery.\r\n\r\nTo read such essays is to understand the spell they have cast on successive\r\ngenerations of readers. They are, first of all, very personal; they begin,\r\nas a rule, with some pleasant trifle that interests the author; then,\r\nalmost before we are aware, they broaden into an essay of life itself, an\r\nessay illuminated by the steady light of Lamb's sympathy or by the flashes\r\nof his whimsical humor. Next, we note in the _Essays_ their air of\r\nliterary culture, which is due to Lamb's wide reading, and to the excellent\r\ntaste with which he selected his old authors,--Sidney, Brown, Burton,\r\nFuller, Walton and Jeremy Taylor. Often it was the quaintness of these\r\nauthors, their conceits or oddities, that charmed him. These oddities\r\nreappear in his own style to such an extent that even when he speaks a\r\nlarge truth, as he often does, he is apt to give the impression of being a\r\nlittle harebrained. Yet if you examine his queer idea or his merry jest,\r\nyou may find that it contains more cardinal virtue than many a sober moral\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAMB BUILDING, INNER TEMPLE, LONDON]\r\n\r\nOn the whole _Elia_ is the quintessence of modern essay-writing from\r\nAddison to Stevenson. There are probably no better works of the same kind\r\nin our literature. Some critics aver that there are none others so good.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DE QUINCEY (1785-1859). It used to be said in a college classroom\r\nthat what De Quincey wrote was seldom important and always doubtful, but\r\nthat we ought to read him for his style; which means, as you might say,\r\nthat caviar is a stomach-upsetting food, but we ought to eat a little of it\r\nbecause it comes in a pretty box.\r\n\r\nTo this criticism, which reflects a prevalent opinion, we may take some\r\nexceptions. For example, what De Quincey has to say of Style, though it\r\nwere written in style-defying German, is of value to everyone who would\r\nteach that impossible subject. What he says or implies in \"Levana\" (the\r\ngoddess who performed \"the earliest office of ennobling kindness\" for a\r\nnewborn child, lifting him from the ground, where he was first laid, and\r\npresenting his forehead to the stars of heaven) has potency to awaken two\r\nof the great faculties of humanity, the power to think and the power to\r\nimagine. Again, many people are fascinated by dreams, those mysterious\r\nfantasies which carry us away on swift wings to meet strange experiences;\r\nand what De Quincey has to say of dreams, though doubtful as a dream\r\nitself, has never been rivaled. To a few mature minds, therefore, De\r\nQuincey is interesting entirely apart from his dazzling style and\r\ninimitable rhetoric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS DE QUINCEY From an engraving by C. H. Jeens]\r\n\r\n    To do justice to De Quincey's erratic, storm-tossed life; to record\r\n    his precocious youth, his marvelous achievements in school or\r\n    college, his wanderings amid lonely mountains or more lonely city\r\n    streets, his drug habits with their gorgeous dreams and terrible\r\n    depressions, his timidity, his courtesy, his soul-solitude, his\r\n    uncanny genius,--all that is impossible in a brief summary. Let it\r\n    suffice, then, to record: that he resembled his friend Coleridge,\r\n    both in his character and in his vast learning; that he studied in\r\n    profound seclusion for twenty years; then for forty years more,\r\n    during which time his brain was more or less beclouded by opium, he\r\n    poured out a flood of magazine articles, which he collected later\r\n    in fourteen chaotic volumes. These deal with an astonishing variety\r\n    of subjects, and cover almost every phase of mental activity from\r\n    portraying a nightmare to building a philosophical system. If he\r\n    had any dominating interest in his strange life, it was the study\r\n    of literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL WORKS]\r\n\r\nThe historian can but name a few characteristic works of De Quincey,\r\nwithout recommending any of them to readers. To those interested in De\r\nQuincey's personality his _Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_ will\r\nbe illuminating. This book astonished Londoners in 1821, and may well\r\nastonish a Bushman in the year 2000. It records his wandering life, and the\r\nalternate transport or suffering which resulted from his drug habits. This\r\nmay be followed by his _Suspiria de Profundis_ (Sighs from the\r\nDepths), which describes, as well as such a thing could be done, the\r\nphantoms born of opium dreams. There are too many of the latter, and the\r\nreader may well be satisfied with the wonderful \"Dream Fugue\" in _The\r\nEnglish Mail Coach_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOVE COTTAGE, GRASMERE\r\nHere both Wordsworth and De Quincey resided]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of De Quincey's review of history, one should try\r\n_Joan of Arc_ or _The Revolt of the Tartars_, which are not\r\nhistorical studies but romantic dreams inspired by reading history. In the\r\ncritical field, \"The Knocking at the Gate in _Macbeth_,\" \"Wordsworth's\r\nPoetry\" and the \"Essay on Style\" are immensely suggestive. As an example of\r\ningenious humor \"Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts\" is often\r\nrecommended; but it has this serious fault, that it is not humorous. For a\r\nconcrete example of De Quincey's matter and manner there is nothing better\r\nthan \"Levana or Our Ladies of Sorrow\" (from the _Suspiria_), with its\r\n_mater lachrymarum_ Our Lady of Tears, _mater suspiriorum_ Our\r\nLady of Sighs, and that strange phantom, forbidding and terrible, _mater\r\ntenebrarum_ Our Lady of Darkness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DE QUINCEY'S STYLE]\r\n\r\nThe style of all these works is indescribable. One may exhaust the whole\r\nlist of adjectives--chanting, rhythmic, cadenced, harmonious,\r\nimpassioned--that have been applied to it, and yet leave much to say.\r\nTherefore we note only these prosaic elements: that the style reflects De\r\nQuincey's powers of logical analysis and of brilliant imagination; that it\r\nis pervaded by a tremendous mental excitement, though one does not know\r\nwhat the stir is all about; and that the impression produced by this\r\nnervous, impassioned style is usually spoiled by digressions, by\r\nhairsplitting, and by something elusive, intangible, to which we can give\r\nno name, but which blurs the author's vision as a drifting fog obscures a\r\nfamiliar landscape.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such strictures, De Quincey's style is still, as when it\r\nfirst appeared, a thing to marvel at, revealing as it does the grace, the\r\nharmony, the wide range and the minute precision of our English speech.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The early nineteenth century is notable for the rapid\r\n    progress of democracy in English government, and for the triumph of\r\n    romanticism in English literature. The most influential factor of\r\n    the age was the French Revolution, with its watchwords of Liberty,\r\n    Equality, Fraternity. English writers felt the stir of the times,\r\n    and were inspired by the dream of a new human society ruled by\r\n    justice and love. In their writing they revolted from the formal\r\n    standards of the age of Pope, followed their own genius rather than\r\n    set rules, and wrote with feeling and imagination of the two great\r\n    subjects of nature and humanity. Such was the contrast in politics\r\n    and literature with the preceding century that the whole period is\r\n    sometimes called the age of revolution.\r\n\r\n    Our study of the literature of the period includes: (1) The poets\r\n    Wordsworth and Coleridge, who did not so much originate as give\r\n    direction to the romantic revival. (2) Byron and Shelley, often\r\n    called revolutionary poets. (3) The poet Keats, whose works are\r\n    famous for their sense of beauty and for their almost perfect\r\n    workmanship.

Amid the many changes which make the reign of\r\n    Victoria the most progressive in English history, one may discover\r\n    three tendencies which have profoundly affected our present life\r\n    and literature. The first is political and democratic: it may be\r\n    said to have begun with the Reform Bill of 1832; it is still in\r\n    progress, and its evident end is to deliver the government of\r\n    England into the hands of the common people. In earlier ages we\r\n    witnessed a government which laid stress on royalty and class\r\n    privilege, the spirit of which was clarioned by Shakespeare in the\r\n    lines:\r\n\r\n      Not all the water in the rough rude sea\r\n      Can wash the balm from an anointed king.\r\n\r\n    In the Victorian or modern age the divine right of kings is as\r\n    obsolete as a suit of armor; the privileges of royalty and nobility\r\n    are either curbed or abolished, and ordinary men by their\r\n    representatives in the House of Commons are the real rulers of\r\n    England.\r\n\r\n    With a change in government comes a corresponding change in\r\n    literature. In former ages literature was almost as exclusive as\r\n    politics; it was largely in the hands of the few; it was supported\r\n    by princely patrons; it reflected the taste of the upper classes.\r\n    Now the masses of men begin to be educated, begin to think for\r\n    themselves, and a host of periodicals appear in answer to their\r\n    demand for reading matter. Poets, novelists, essayists,\r\n    historians,--all serious writers feel the inspiration of a great\r\n    audience, and their works have a thousand readers where formerly\r\n    they had but one. In a word, English government, society and\r\n    literature have all become more democratic. This is the most\r\n    significant feature of modern history.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT]\r\n\r\n    The second tendency may be summed up in the word \"scientific.\" At\r\n    the basis of this tendency is man's desire to know the truth, if\r\n    possible the whole truth of life; and it sets no limits to the\r\n    exploring spirit, whether in the heavens above or the earth beneath\r\n    or the waters under the earth. From star-dust in infinite space\r\n    (which we hope to measure) to fossils on the bed of an ocean which\r\n    is no longer unfathomed, nothing is too great or too small to\r\n    attract man, to fascinate him, to influence his thought, his life,\r\n    his literature. Darwin's _Origin of Species_ (1859), which\r\n    laid the foundation for a general theory of evolution, is one of\r\n    the most famous books of the age, and of the world. Associated with\r\n    Darwin were Wallace, Lyell, Huxley, Tyndall and many others, whose\r\n    essays are, in their own way, quite as significant as the poems of\r\n    Tennyson or the novels of Dickens.\r\n\r\n    It would be quite as erroneous to allege that modern science began\r\n    with these men as to assume that it began with the Chinese or with\r\n    Roger Bacon; the most that can be said truthfully is, that the\r\n    scientific spirit which they reflected began to dominate our\r\n    thought, to influence even our poetry and fiction, even as the\r\n    voyages of Drake and Magellan furnished a mighty and mysterious\r\n    background for the play of human life on the Elizabethan stage. The\r\n    Elizabethans looked upon an enlarging visible world, and the wonder\r\n    of it is reflected in their prose and poetry; the Victorians\r\n    overran that world almost from pole to pole, then turned their\r\n    attention to an unexplored world of invisible forces, and their\r\n    best literature thrills again with the grandeur of the universe in\r\n    which men live.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: IMPERIALISM]\r\n\r\n    A third tendency of the Victorian age in England is expressed by\r\n    the word \"imperialism.\" In earlier ages the work of planting\r\n    English colonies had been well done; in the Victorian age the\r\n    scattered colonies increased mightily in wealth and power, and were\r\n    closely federated into a world-wide Empire of people speaking the\r\n    same noble speech, following the same high ideals of justice and\r\n    liberty.\r\n\r\n    The literature of the period reflects the wide horizons of the\r\n    Empire. Among historical writers, Parkman the American was one of\r\n    the first and best to reflect the imperial spirit. In such works as\r\n    _A Half-Century of Conflict_ and _Montcalm and Wolfe_ he\r\n    portrayed the conflict not of one nation against another but rather\r\n    of two antagonistic types of civilization: the military and feudal\r\n    system of France against the democratic institutions of the\r\n    Anglo-Saxons. Among the explorers, Mungo Park had anticipated the\r\n    Victorians in his _Travels in the Interior of Africa_ (1799),\r\n    a wonderful book which set England to dreaming great dreams; but\r\n    not until the heroic Livingstone's _Missionary Travels and\r\n    Research in South Africa, The Zambesi and its Tributaries_ and\r\n    _Last Journals_ [Footnote: In connection with Livingstone's\r\n    works, Stanley's _How I Found Livingstone_ (1872) should also\r\n    be read. Livingstone died in Africa in 1873, and his\r\n    _Journals_ were edited by another hand. For a summary of his\r\n    work and its continuation see _Livingstone and the Exploration of\r\n    Central Africa_ (London, 1897).] appeared was the veil lifted\r\n    from the Dark Continent. Beside such works should be placed\r\n    numerous stirring journals of exploration in Canada, in India, in\r\n    Australia, in tropical or frozen seas,--wherever in the round world\r\n    the colonizing genius of England saw opportunity to extend the\r\n    boundaries and institutions of the Empire. Macaulay's _Warren\r\n    Hastings_, Edwin Arnold's _Indian Idylls_, Kipling's\r\n    _Soldiers Three_,--a few such works must be read if we are to\r\n    appreciate the imperial spirit of modern English history and\r\n    literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. POETS OF THE VICTORIAN AGE\r\n\r\nALFRED TENNYSON (1809-1892)\r\n\r\nThough the Victorian age is notable for the quality and variety of its\r\nprose works, its dominant figure for years was the poet Tennyson. He alone,\r\nof all that brilliant group of Victorian writers, seemed to speak not for\r\nhimself but for his age and nation; and the nation, grown weary of Byronic\r\nrebellion, and finding its joy or sorrow expressed with almost faultless\r\ntaste by one whose life was noble, gave to Tennyson a whole-souled\r\nallegiance such as few poets have ever won. In 1850 he was made Laureate to\r\nsucceed Wordsworth, receiving, as he said,\r\n\r\n  This laurel, greener from the brow\r\n  Of him that uttered nothing base;\r\n\r\nand from that time on he steadily adhered to his purpose, which was to know\r\nhis people and to be their spokesman. Of all the poets who have been called\r\nto the Laureateship, he is probably the only one of whom it can truthfully\r\nbe said that he understood his high office and was worthy of it.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. When we attempt a biography of a person we assume\r\n    unconsciously that he was a public man; but that is precisely what\r\n    Tennyson refused to be. He lived a retired life of thoughtfulness,\r\n    of communion with nature, of friendships too sacred for the world's\r\n    gaze, a life blameless in conduct, unswerving in its loyalty to\r\n    noble ideals. From boyhood to old age he wrote poetry, and in that\r\n    poetry alone, not in biography or letters or essays of criticism,\r\n    do we ever touch the real man.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TENNYSON'S BIRTHPLACE, SOMERSBY RECTORY,\r\n    LINCOLNSHIRE]\r\n\r\n    Tennyson was the son of a cultured clergyman, and was born in the\r\n    rectory of Somersby, Lincolnshire, in 1809, the same year that saw\r\n    the birth of Lincoln and Darwin. Like Milton he devoted himself to\r\n    poetry at an early age; in his resolve he was strengthened by his\r\n    mother; and from it he never departed. The influences of his early\r\n    life, the quiet beauty of the English landscape, the surge and\r\n    mystery of the surrounding sea, the emphasis on domestic virtues,\r\n    the pride and love of an Englishman for his country and his\r\n    country's history,--these are everywhere reflected in the poet's\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    His education was largely a matter of reading under his father's\r\n    direction. He had a short experience of the grammar school at\r\n    Louth, which he hated forever after. He entered Cambridge, and\r\n    formed a circle of rare friends (\"apostles\" they called themselves)\r\n    who afterwards became famous; but he left college without taking a\r\n    degree, probably because he was too poor to continue his course.\r\n    Not till 1850 did he earn enough by his work to establish a home of\r\n    his own. Then he leased a house at Farringford, Isle of Wight,\r\n    which we have ever since associated with Tennyson's name. But his\r\n    real place is the Heart of England.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A POET AND HIS CRITICS]\r\n\r\n    His first book (a boyish piece of work, undertaken with his brother\r\n    Charles) appeared under the title _Poems by Two Brothers_\r\n    (1827). In 1830, and again in 1832, he published a small volume\r\n    containing such poems as \"The Palace of Art,\" \"The Lotos-Eaters,\"\r\n    \"The Lady of Shalott\" and \"The Miller's Daughter\"; but the critics\r\n    of the age, overlooking the poet's youth and its promise, treated\r\n    the volumes unmercifully. Tennyson, always sensitive to criticism,\r\n    was sensible enough to see that the critics had ground for their\r\n    opinions, if not for their harshness; and for ten long years, while\r\n    he labored to perfect his art, his name did not again appear in\r\n    print.\r\n\r\n    There was another reason for his silence. In 1833 his dearest\r\n    friend, Arthur Hallam, died suddenly in Vienna, and it was years\r\n    before Tennyson began to recover from the blow. His first\r\n    expression of grief is seen in the lyric beginning, \"Break, break,\r\n    break,\" which contains the memorable stanza:\r\n\r\n      And the stately ships go on\r\n        To their haven under the hill;\r\n      But O for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n       And the sound of a voice that is still!\r\n\r\n    Then he began that series of elegies for his friend which appeared,\r\n    seventeen years later, as _In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HE WINS AND HOLDS HIS PLACE]\r\n\r\n    Influenced by his friends, Tennyson broke his long silence with a\r\n    volume containing \"Morte d'Arthur,\" \"Locksley Hall,\" \"Sir Galahad,\"\r\n    \"Lady Clare\" and a few more poems which have never lost their power\r\n    over readers; but it must have commanded attention had it contained\r\n    only \"Ulysses,\" that magnificent appeal to manhood, reflecting the\r\n    indomitable spirit of all those restless explorers who dared\r\n    unknown lands or seas to make wide the foundations of imperial\r\n    England. It was a wonderful volume, and almost its first effect was\r\n    to raise the hidden Tennyson to the foremost place in English\r\n    letters.\r\n\r\n    Whatever he wrote thereafter was sure of a wide reading. Critics,\r\n    workingmen, scientists, reformers, theologians,--all recognized the\r\n    power of the poet to give melodious expression to their thought or\r\n    feeling. Yet he remained averse to everything that savored of\r\n    popularity, devoting himself as in earlier days to poetry alone. As\r\n    a critic writes, \"Tennyson never forgot that the poet's work was to\r\n    convince the world of love and beauty; that he was born to do that\r\n    work, and do it worthily.\"\r\n\r\n    There are two poems which are especially significant in view of\r\n    this steadfast purpose. The first is \"Merlin and the Gleam,\" which\r\n    reflects Tennyson's lifelong devotion to his art; the other is\r\n    \"Crossing the Bar,\" which was his farewell and hail to life when\r\n    the end came in 1892.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF TENNYSON. There is a wide variety in Tennyson's work: legend,\r\nromance, battle song, nature, classic and medieval heroes, problems of\r\nsociety, questions of science, the answer of faith,--almost everything that\r\ncould interest an alert Victorian mind found some expression in his poetry.\r\nIt ranges in subject from a thrush song to a religious philosophy, in form\r\nfrom the simplest love lyric to the labored historical drama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL SHORT POEMS]\r\n\r\nOf the shorter poems of Tennyson there are a few which should be known to\r\nevery student: first, because they are typical of the man who stands for\r\nmodern English poetry; and second, because one is constantly meeting\r\nreferences to these poems in books or magazines or even newspapers. Among\r\nsuch representative poems are: \"The Lotos-Eaters,\" a dream picture\r\ncharacterized by a beauty and verbal melody that recall Spenser's work;\r\n\"Locksley Hall\" and \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After,\" the one a romance\r\nthrobbing with youth and hope, the other representing the same hero grown\r\nold, despondent and a little carping, but still holding fast to his ideals;\r\n\"Sir Galahad,\" a medieval romance of purity; \"Ulysses,\" an epitome of\r\nexploration in all ages; \"The Revenge,\" a stirring war song; \"Rizpah,\" a\r\ndramatic portrayal of a mother's grief for a wayward son; \"Romney's\r\nRemorse,\" a character study of Tennyson's later years; and a few shorter\r\npoems, such as \"The Higher Pantheism,\" \"Flower in the Crannied Wall,\"\r\n\"Wages\" and \"The Making of Man,\" which reflect the poet's mood before the\r\nproblems of science and of faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED TENNYSON]\r\n\r\nTo these should be added a few typical patriotic pieces, which show\r\nTennyson speaking as Poet Laureate for his country: \"Ode on the Death of\r\nWellington,\" \"Charge of the Light Brigade,\" \"Defense of Lucknow,\" \"Hands\r\nall Round,\" and the imperial appeal of \"Britons, Hold Your Own\" or, as it\r\nis tamely called, \"Opening of the Indian and Colonial Exposition.\" The\r\nbeginner may also be reminded of certain famous little melodies, such as\r\nthe \"Bugle Song,\" \"Sweet and Low,\" \"Tears,\" \"The Brook,\" \"Far, Far, Away\"\r\nand \"Crossing the Bar,\" which are among the most perfect that England has\r\nproduced. And, as showing Tennyson's extraordinary power of youthful\r\nfeeling, at least one lyric of his old age should be read, such as \"The\r\nThrostle\" (a song that will appeal especially to all bird lovers),\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n  \"Summer is coming, summer is coming,\r\n     I know it, I know it, I know it;\r\n  Light again, leaf again, life again, love again\"--\r\n     Yes, my wild little poet!\r\n\r\nHere Tennyson is so merged in his subject as to produce the impression that\r\nthe lyric must have been written not by an aged poet but by the bird\r\nhimself. Reading the poem one seems to hear the brown thrasher on a twig of\r\nthe wild-apple tree, pouring his heart out over the thicket which his mate\r\nhas just chosen for a nesting place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IDYLLS OF THE KING]\r\n\r\nOf the longer works of Tennyson the most notable is the _Idylls of the\r\nKing_, a series of twelve poems retelling part of the story of Arthur\r\nand his knights. Tennyson seems to have worked at this poem in haphazard\r\nfashion, writing the end first, then a fragment here or there, at intervals\r\nduring half a century. Finally he welded his material into its present\r\nform, making it a kind of allegory of human life, in which man's animal\r\nnature fights with his spiritual aspirations. As Tennyson wrote, in his\r\n\"Finale\" to Queen Victoria:\r\n\r\n        Accept this old, imperfect tale,\r\n  New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul.\r\n\r\nThe beginner will do well to forget the allegory and read the poem for its\r\nsustained beauty of expression and for its reflection of the modern ideal\r\nof honor. For, though Malory and Tennyson tell the same story, there is\r\nthis significant difference between the _Morte d' Arthur_ and the\r\n_Idylls of the King_: one is thoroughly medieval, and the other almost\r\nas thoroughly modern. Malory in simple prose makes his story the expression\r\nof chivalry in the Middle Ages; his heroes are true to their own time and\r\nplace. Tennyson in melodious blank verse changes his material freely so as\r\nto make it a reflection of a nineteenth-century gentleman disguised in a\r\nsuit of armor and some old knightly raiment.\r\n\r\nOne may add that some readers cleave to Tennyson, while others greatly\r\nprefer Malory. There is little or no comparison between the two, and\r\nselections from both should be read, if only to understand how this old\r\nromance of Arthur has appealed to writers of different times. In making a\r\nselection from the _Idylls_ (the length of the poem is rather\r\nforbidding) it is well to begin with the twelfth book, \"The Passing of\r\nArthur,\" which was first to be written, and which reflects the noble spirit\r\nof the entire work.\r\n\r\nIn _The Princess: a Medley_ the poet attempts the difficult task of\r\ncombining an old romantic story with a modern social problem; and he does\r\nnot succeed very well in harmonizing his incongruous materials.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE PRINCESS]\r\n\r\n    The story is, briefly, of a princess who in youth is betrothed to a\r\n    prince. When she reaches what is called the age of discretion\r\n    (doubtless because that age is so frequently marked by\r\n    indiscretions) she rebels against the idea of marriage, and founds\r\n    a college, herself the principal, devoted to the higher education\r\n    of women. The prince, a gallant blade, and a few of his followers\r\n    disguise themselves as girls and enter the school. When an unruly\r\n    masculine tongue betrays him he is cast out with maledictions on\r\n    his head. His father comes with an army, and makes war against the\r\n    father of the princess. The prince joins blithely in the fight, is\r\n    sore wounded, and is carried to the woman's college as to a\r\n    hospital. The princess nurses him, listens to his love tale, and\r\n    the story ends in the good old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nThere are many beautiful passages in _The Princess_, and had Tennyson\r\nbeen content to tell the romantic story his work would have had some\r\npleasant suggestion of Shakespeare's _As You Like It_; but the social\r\nproblem spoils the work, as a moralizing intruder spoils a bit of innocent\r\nfun. Tennyson is either too serious or not serious enough; he does not know\r\nthe answer to his own problem, and is not quite sincere in dealing with it\r\nor in coming to his lame and impotent conclusion. Few readers now attempt\r\nthe three thousand lines of _The Princess_, but content themselves\r\nwith a few lyrics, such as \"Ask Me No More,\" \"O Swallow Flying South,\"\r\n\"Tears,\" \"Bugle Song\" and \"Sweet and Low,\" which are familiar songs in many\r\nhouseholds that remember not whence they came. [Footnote: The above\r\ncriticism of _The Princess_ applies, in some measure, to Tennyson's\r\n_Maud: a Monodrama_, a story of passionate love and loss and sorrow.\r\nTennyson wrote also several dramatic works, such as _Harold_,\r\n_Becket_ and _Queen Mary_, in which he attempted to fill some of\r\nthe gaps in Shakespeare's list of chronicle plays.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENGLISH IDYLS]\r\n\r\nMore consistent than _The Princess_ is a group of poems reflecting the\r\nlife and ideals of simple people, to which Tennyson gave the general name\r\nof _English Idyls_. The longest and in some respects the best of these\r\nis \"Enoch Arden,\" a romance which was once very popular, but which is now\r\nin danger of being shelved because the modern reader prefers his romance in\r\nprose form. Certain of the famous poems which we have already named are\r\nclassed among these English idyls; but more typical of Tennyson's purpose\r\nin writing them are \"Dora,\" \"The Gardener's Daughter\" and \"Aylmer's Field,\"\r\nin which he turns from ancient heroes to sing the romance of present-day\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMERHOUSE AT FARRINGFORD\r\nHere Tennyson wrote \"Enoch Arden\"]\r\n\r\nAmong mature readers, who have met the sorrows of life or pondered its\r\nproblems, the most admired of Tennyson's work is _In Memoriam_ (1850),\r\nan elegy inspired by the death of Arthur Hallam. As a memorial poem it\r\ninvites comparison with others, with Milton's \"Lycidas,\" or Shelley's\r\n\"Adonais,\" or Gray's \"Elegy in a Country Churchyard.\" Without going deeply\r\ninto the comparison we may note this difference: that Tennyson's work is\r\nmore personal and sympathetic than any of the others. Milton had only a\r\nslight acquaintance with his human subject (Edward King) and wrote his poem\r\nas a memorial for the college rather than for the man; Shelley had never\r\nmet Keats, whose early death he commemorates; Gray voiced an impersonal\r\nmelancholy in the presence of the unknown dead; but Tennyson had lost his\r\ndearest friend, and wrote to solace his own grief and to keep alive a\r\nbeautiful memory. Then, as he wrote, came the thought of other men and\r\nwomen mourning their dead; his view broadened with his sympathy, and he\r\nwrote other lyrics in the same strain to reflect the doubt or fear of\r\nhumanity and its deathless faith even in the shadow of death.\r\n\r\nIt is this combination of personal and universal elements which makes _In\r\nMemoriam_ remarkable. The only other elegy to which we may liken it is\r\nEmerson's \"Threnody,\" written after the death of his little boy. But where\r\nTennyson offers an elaborate wreath and a polished monument, Emerson is\r\ncontent with a rugged block of granite and a spray of nature's evergreen.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PLAN OF THE POEM]\r\n\r\n    _In Memoriam_ occupied Tennyson at intervals for many years,\r\n    and though he attempted to give it unity before its publication in\r\n    1850, it is still rather fragmentary. Moreover, it is too long; for\r\n    the poet never lived who could write a hundred and thirty-one\r\n    lyrics upon the same subject, in the same manner, without growing\r\n    monotonous.\r\n\r\n    There are three more or less distinct parts of the work, [Footnote:\r\n    Tennyson divided _In Memoriam_ into nine sections. Various\r\n    attempts have recently been made to organize the poem and to make a\r\n    philosophy of it, but these are ingenious rather than convincing.]\r\n    corresponding to three successive Christmas seasons. The first part\r\n    (extending to poem 30) is concerned with grief and doubt; the\r\n    second (to poem 78) exhibits a calm, serious questioning of the\r\n    problem of faith; the third introduces a great hope amid tender\r\n    memories or regrets, and ends (poem 106) with that splendid outlook\r\n    on a new year and a new life, \"Ring Out Wild Bells.\" This was\r\n    followed by a few more lyrics of mounting faith, inspired by the\r\n    thought that divine love rules the world and that our human love is\r\n    immortal and cannot die. The work ends, rather incongruously, with\r\n    a marriage hymn for Tennyson's sister.\r\n\r\n    The spirit of _In Memoriam_ is well reflected in the \"Proem\"\r\n    or introductory hymn, \"Strong Son of God, Immortal Love\"; its\r\n    message is epitomized in the last three lines:\r\n\r\n        One God, one law, one element,\r\n        And one far-off divine event\r\n      To which the whole creation moves.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF TENNYSON. The charm of Tennyson is twofold. As the voice of\r\nthe Victorian Age, reflecting its thought or feeling or culture, its\r\nintellectual quest, its moral endeavor, its passion for social justice, he\r\nrepresents to us the spirit of modern poetry; that is, poetry which comes\r\nclose to our own life, to the aims, hopes, endeavors of the men and women\r\nof to-day. With this modern quality Tennyson has the secret of all old\r\npoetry, which is to be eternally young. He looked out upon a world from\r\nwhich the first wonder of creation had not vanished, where the sunrise was\r\nstill \"a glorious birth,\" and where love, truth, beauty, all inspiring\r\nrealities, were still waiting with divine patience to reveal themselves to\r\nhuman eyes.\r\n\r\nThere are other charms in Tennyson: his romantic spirit, his love of\r\nnature, his sense of verbal melody, his almost perfect workmanship; but\r\nthese the reader must find and appreciate for himself. The sum of our\r\ncriticism is that Tennyson is a poet to have handy on the table for the\r\npleasure of an idle hour. He is also (and this is a better test) an\r\nexcellent poet to put in your pocket when you go on a journey. So shall you\r\nbe sure of traveling in good company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT BROWNING (1812-1889)\r\n\r\nIn their lifelong devotion to a single purpose the two chief poets of the\r\nVictorian Age are much alike; in most other respects they are men of\r\ncontrasts. Tennyson looked like a poet, Browning like a business man.\r\nTennyson was a solitary singer, never in better company than when alone;\r\nBrowning was a city man, who must have the excitement of society.\r\nTennyson's field was the nation, its traditions, heroes, problems, ideals;\r\nbut Browning seldom went beyond the individual man, and his purpose was to\r\nplay Columbus to some obscure human soul. Tennyson was at times rather\r\nnarrowly British; Browning was a cosmopolitan who dealt broadly with\r\nhumanity. Tennyson was the poet of youth, and will always be read by the\r\nyoung in heart; Browning was the philosopher, the psychologist, the poet of\r\nmature years and of a few cultivated readers.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Browning portrays so many different human types as to make us\r\n    marvel, but we may partly understand his wide range of\r\n    character-studies by remembering he was an Englishman with some\r\n    Celtic and German ancestors, and with a trace of Creole\r\n    (Spanish-Negro) blood. He was born and grew up at Camberwell, a\r\n    suburb of London, and the early home of Ruskin. His father was a\r\n    Bank-of-England clerk, a prosperous man and fond of books, who\r\n    encouraged his boy to read and to let education follow the lead of\r\n    fancy. Before Browning was twenty years old, father and son had a\r\n    serious talk which ended in a kind of bargain: the boy was to live\r\n    a life of culture, and the father was to take care of all financial\r\n    matters,--an arrangement which suited them both very well.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROBERT BROWNING]\r\n\r\n    Since boyhood Browning had been writing romantic verses, influenced\r\n    first by Byron, then by Shelley, then by Keats. His first published\r\n    works, _Pauline_ and _Paracelsus_, were what he called\r\n    soul-studies, the one of a visionary, \"a star-treader\" (its hero\r\n    was Shelley), the other of a medieval astrologer somewhat like\r\n    Faust. These two works, if one had the patience of a puzzle-worker\r\n    to read them, would be found typical of all the longer poems that\r\n    Browning produced in his sixty years of writing.\r\n\r\n    These early works were not read, were not even criticized; and it\r\n    was not till 1846 that Browning became famous, not because of his\r\n    books but because he eloped with Elizabeth Barrett, who was then\r\n    the most popular poet in England. [Footnote: The fame of Miss\r\n    Barrett in mid century was above that of Tennyson or Browning. She\r\n    had been for a long time an invalid. Her father, a tyrannical kind\r\n    of person, insisted on her keeping her room, and expected her to\r\n    die properly there. He had no personal objection to Browning, but\r\n    flouted the idea of his famous daughter marrying with anybody.] The\r\n    two went to Florence, discovered that they were \"made for each\r\n    other,\" and in mutual helpfulness did their best work. They lived\r\n    at \"Casa Guidi,\" a house made famous by the fact that Browning's\r\n    _Men and Women_ and Mrs. Browning's _Sonnets from the\r\n    Portuguese_ were written there.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MRS. BROWNING'S TOMB IN THE PROTESTANT CEMETERY AT\r\n    FLORENCE]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE BROWNING CULT]\r\n\r\n    This happy period of work was broken by Mrs. Browning's death in\r\n    1861. Browning returned to England with his son, and to forget his\r\n    loss he labored with unusual care on _The Ring and the Book_\r\n    (1868), his bulkiest work. The rest of his life was spent largely\r\n    in London and in Venice. Fame came to him tardily, and with some\r\n    unfortunate results. He became known as a poet to be likened unto\r\n    Shakespeare, but more analytical, calling for a superior\r\n    intelligence on the part of his readers, and presently a multitude\r\n    of Browning clubs sprang up in England and America. Delighted with\r\n    his popularity among the elect, Browning seems to have cultivated\r\n    his talent for obscurity, or it may be that his natural\r\n    eccentricity of style increased with age, as did Wordsworth's\r\n    prosiness. Whatever the cause, his work grew steadily worse until a\r\n    succession of grammar defying volumes threatened to separate all\r\n    but a few devotees from their love of Browning. He died in Venice\r\n    in 1889. On the day of his death appeared in London his last book,\r\n    _Asolando_. The \"Epilogue\" to that volume is a splendid finale\r\n    to a robust life.\r\n\r\n      One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,\r\n      Never doubted clouds would break,\r\n      Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,\r\n      Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,\r\n      Sleep to wake\r\n\r\n    Tennyson's \"Crossing the Bar\" is a beautiful swan song; but\r\n    Browning's last poem is a bugle call, and it sounds not \"taps\" but\r\n    the \"reveille.\"\r\n\r\nBROWNING'S DRAMATIC QUALITY. Nearly all the works of Browning are dramatic\r\nin spirit, and are commonly dramatic also in form. Sometimes he writes a\r\ndrama for the stage, such as _A Blot in the 'Scutcheon_, _Colombe's\r\nBirthday_ and _In a Balcony_,--dramas without much action, but\r\npacked with thought in a way that would have delighted the Schoolmen. More\r\noften his work takes the form of a dramatic monologue, such as \"My Last\r\nDuchess\" and \"The Bishop Orders his Tomb,\" in which one person speaks and,\r\nlike Peter, his speech bewrayeth him; for he reveals very plainly the kind\r\nof man he is. Occasionally Browning tries to sing like another poet, but\r\neven here his dramatic instinct is strong. He takes some crisis, some\r\nunexpected meeting or parting of the ways of life, and proceeds to show the\r\nhero's character by the way he faces the situation, or talks about it. So\r\nwhen he attempts even a love song, such as \"The Last Ride Together,\" or a\r\nballad, such as \"The Pied Piper,\" he regards his subject from an unusual\r\nviewpoint and produces what he calls a dramatic lyric.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACTION VS. THOUGHT]\r\n\r\nThere are at least two ways in which Browning's work differs from that of\r\nother dramatists. When a trained playwright produces a drama his rule is,\r\n\"Action, more action, and still more action.\" Moreover, he stands aside in\r\norder to permit his characters to reveal their quality by their own speech\r\nor action. For example, Shakespeare's plays are filled with movement, and\r\nhe never tells you what he thinks of Portia or Rosalind or Macbeth, or what\r\nought to become of them. He does not need to tell. But Browning often halts\r\nhis story to inform you how this or that situation should be met, or what\r\nmust come out of it. His theory is that it is not action but thought which\r\ndetermines human character; for a man may be doing what appears to be a\r\nbrave or generous deed, yet be craven or selfish at heart; or he may be\r\nengaged in some apparently sinful proceeding in obedience to a motive that\r\nwe would acclaim as noble if the whole truth were known \"It is the soul and\r\nits thoughts that make the man,\" says Browning, \"little else is worthy of\r\nstudy.\" So he calls most of his works soul studies. If we label them now\r\ndramas, or dramatic monologues, or dramatic lyrics (the three\r\nclassifications of his works), we are to remember that Browning is the one\r\ndramatist who deals with thoughts or motives rather than with action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PALAZZO REZZONICO BROWNING'S HOME IN VENICE]\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. One should begin with the simplest of Browning's works, and\r\npreferably with those in which he shows some regard for verbal melody. As\r\nromantic love is his favorite theme, it is perhaps well to begin with a few\r\nof the love lyrics \"My Star,\" \"By the Fireside,\" \"Evelyn Hope,\" and\r\nespecially \"The Last Ride Together\". To these may be added some of the\r\nsongs that brighten the obscurity of his longer pieces, such as \"I Send my\r\nHeart,\" \"Oh Love--No Love\" and \"There's a Woman Like a Dewdrop\". Next in\r\norder are the ballads, \"The Pied Piper,\" \"Hervé Riel\" and \"How they Brought\r\nthe Good News\"; and then a few miscellaneous short poems, such as \"Home\r\nThoughts from Abroad,\" \"Prospice,\" \"The Boy and the Angel\" and \"Up at a\r\nVilla--Down in the City.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES]\r\n\r\nThe above poems are named not because they are particularly fine examples\r\nof their kind, but by way of introduction to a poet who is rather hard to\r\nread. When these are known, and are found not so obscure as we feared, then\r\nwill be the time to attempt some of Browning's dramatic monologues. Of\r\nthese there is a large variety, portraying many different types of\r\ncharacter, but we shall name only a few. \"Andrea del Sarto\" is a study of\r\nthe great Italian painter, \"the perfect painter,\" whose love for a pretty\r\nbut shallow woman was as a millstone about his neck. \"My Last Duchess\" is a\r\npowerfully drawn outline of a vain and selfish nobleman. \"Abt Vogler\" is a\r\nstudy of the soul of a musician. \"Rabbi ben Ezra,\" one of the most typical\r\nof Browning's works, is the word of an old man who faces death, as he had\r\nfaced life, with magnificent courage. \"An Epistle\" relates the strange\r\nexperience of Karshish, an Arab physician, as recorded in a letter to his\r\nmaster Abib. Karshish meets Lazarus (him who was raised from the dead) and,\r\nregarding him as a patient, describes his symptoms,--such symptoms as a man\r\nmight have who must live on earth after having looked on heaven. The\r\nphysician's half-scoffing words show how his habitual skepticism is shaken\r\nby a glimpse of the unseen world. He concludes, but his doubt is stronger\r\nthan his conclusion, that Lazarus must be a madman:\r\n\r\n  \"And thou must love me who have died for thee.\"\r\n  The madman saith He said so: it is strange!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAUL]\r\n\r\nAnother poem belonging to the same group (published under the general title\r\nof _Men and Women_) is \"Saul,\" which finely illustrates the method\r\nthat makes Browning different from other poets. He would select some\r\nfamiliar event, the brief record of which is preserved in history, and say,\r\n\"Here we see merely the deed, the outward act or circumstance of life: now\r\nlet us get acquainted with these men or women by showing that they thought\r\nand felt precisely as we do under similar conditions.\" In \"Saul\" he\r\nreproduces the scene recorded in the sixteenth chapter of the first Book of\r\nSamuel, where the king is \"troubled by an evil spirit\" and the young David\r\ncomes to play the harp before him. Saul is represented as the\r\ndisillusioned, the despairing man who has lost all interest in life, and\r\nDavid as the embodiment of youthful enthusiasm. The poem is a remarkable\r\nportrayal of the ancient scene and characters; but it is something greater\r\nthan that; it is a splendid song of the fullness and joy of a brave,\r\nforward-looking life inspired by noble ideals. It is also one of the best\r\nanswers ever given to the question, Is life worth living? The length of the\r\npoem, however, and its many difficult or digressive passages are apt to\r\nrepel the beginner unless he have the advantage of an abridged version.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PIPPA PASSES]\r\n\r\nOf the longer works of Browning, only _Pippa Passes_ can be\r\nrecommended with any confidence that it will give pleasure to the reader.\r\nOther works, such as _The Ring and the Book_, [Footnote: _The Ring\r\nand the Book_ is remarkable for other things than its inordinate length.\r\nIn it Browning tells how he found an old book containing the record of a\r\nmurder trial in Rome,--a horrible story of a certain Count Guido, who in a\r\njealous rage killed his beautiful young wife. That is the only story\r\nelement of the poem, and it is told, with many irritating digressions, at\r\nthe beginning. The rest of the work is devoted to \"soul studies,\" the\r\nsubjects being nine different characters who rehearse the same story, each\r\nfor his own justification. Thus, Guido gives his view of the matter, and\r\nPompilia the wife gives hers. \"Half Rome,\" siding with Guido, is\r\npersonified to tell one tale, and then \"The Other Half\" has its say. Final\r\njudgment rests with the Pope, an impressive figure, who upholds the\r\ndecision of the civil judges. Altogether it is a remarkable piece of work;\r\nbut it would have been more remarkable, better in every way, if fifteen\r\nthousand of its twenty thousand lines had been left in the inkpot.] are\r\ndoubtless more famous; but reading them is like solving a puzzle: a few\r\nenjoy the matter, and therefore count it pleasure, but to the majority it\r\nis a task to be undertaken as mental discipline.\r\n\r\n    _Pippa_ is the story of a working girl, a silk weaver of\r\n    Asolo, who has a precious holiday and goes forth to enjoy it,\r\n    wishing she could share her happiness with others, especially with\r\n    the great people of her town. But the great live in another world,\r\n    she thinks, a world far removed from that of the poor little\r\n    working girl; so she puts the wish out of her head, and goes on her\r\n    way singing:\r\n\r\n      The year's at the spring,\r\n      And day's at the morn;\r\n      Morning's at seven;\r\n      The hillside's dew-pearled;\r\n      The lark's on the wing;\r\n      The snail's on the thorn:\r\n      God's in his heaven--\r\n      All's right with the world!\r\n\r\n    It happens that her songs come, in succession, to the ears of the\r\n    four greatest people in Asolo at moments when they are facing a\r\n    terrible crisis, when a straw may turn them one way or the other,\r\n    to do evil or to do good. In each case the song and the pure heart\r\n    of the singer turn the scale in the right direction; but Pippa\r\n    knows nothing of her influence. She enjoys her holiday and goes to\r\n    bed still happy, still singing, quite ignorant of the wonder she\r\n    has accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIAZZA OF SAN LORENZO, FLORENCE\r\nWhere Browning bought the book in which he found the story of\r\n\"The Ring and the Book\"]\r\n\r\nA mere story-teller would have brought Pippa and the rescued ones together,\r\nmaking an affecting scene with rewards, in the romantic manner; but\r\nBrowning is content to depict a bit of ordinary human life, which is daily\r\nfilled with deeds worthy to be written in a book of gold, but of which only\r\nthe Recording Angel takes any notice.\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF BROWNING. Comparatively few people appreciate the force, the\r\ndaring, the vitality of Browning, and those who know him best are least\r\ninclined to formulate a favorable criticism. They know too well the faults\r\nof their hero, his whims, crotchets, digressions, garrulity; his disjointed\r\nideas, like rich plums in a poor pudding; his ejaculatory style, as of a\r\nman of second thoughts; his wing-bound fancy, which hops around his subject\r\nlike a grasshopper instead of soaring steadily over it like an eagle. Many\r\nof his lines are rather gritty:\r\n\r\n  Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast?\r\n\r\nand half his blank verse is neither prose nor poetry:\r\n\r\n  What, you, Sir, come too? (Just the man I'd meet.)\r\n  Be ruled by me and have a care o' the crowd:\r\n  This way, while fresh folk go and get their gaze:\r\n  I'll tell you like a book and save your shins.\r\n  Fie, what a roaring day we've had! Whose fault?\r\n  Lorenzo in Lucina,--here's a church!\r\n\r\nInstead of criticism, therefore, his admirers offer this word of advice:\r\nTry to like Browning; in other words, try to understand him. He is not\r\n\"easy\"; he is not to be read for relaxation after dinner, but in the\r\nmorning and in a straight-backed chair, with eyes clear and intellect at\r\nattention. If you so read him, you must soon discover that he has something\r\nof courage and cheer which no other poet can give you in such full measure.\r\nIf you read nothing else, try at least \"Rabbi ben Ezra,\" and after the\r\nreading reflect that the optimism of this poem colors everything that the\r\nauthor wrote. For Browning differs from all other poets in this: that they\r\nhave their moods of doubt or despondency, but he has no weary days or\r\nmelancholy hours. They sing at times in the twilight, but Browning is the\r\nherald of the sunrise. Always and everywhere he represents \"the will to\r\nlive,\" to live bravely, confidently here; then forward still with cheerful\r\nhearts to immortality:\r\n\r\n  Grow old along with me!\r\n  The best is yet to be,\r\n  The last of life, for which the first was made:\r\n  Our times are in his hand\r\n  Who saith, \"A whole I planned,\r\n  Youth shows but half: trust God: see all, nor be afraid!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOTHER VICTORIAN POETS\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING (1806-1861). Among the lesser poets of the age\r\nthe most famous was Elizabeth Barrett, who eloped in romantic fashion with\r\nBrowning in 1846. Her early volumes, written while she was an invalid, seem\r\nnow a little feverish, but a few of her poems of childhood, such as\r\n\"Hector\" and \"Little Ellie,\" have still their admirers. Later she became\r\ninterested in social problems, and reflected the passion of the age for\r\nreform in such poems as \"The Cry of the Children,\" a protest against child\r\nlabor which once vied in interest with Hood's famous \"Song of the Shirt.\"\r\nAlso she wrote _Aurora Leigh_, a popular novel in verse, having for\r\nits subject a hero who was a social reformer. Then Miss Barrett married\r\nRobert Browning after a rather emotional and sentimental courtship, as\r\nreflected in certain extravagant pages of the Browning _Letters_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SONNETS]\r\n\r\nIn her new-found happiness she produced her most enduring work, the\r\n_Sonnets from the Portuguese_ (1850). This is a collection of love\r\nsongs, so personal and intimate that the author thought perhaps to disguise\r\nthem by calling them \"From the Portuguese.\" In reality their source was no\r\nfurther distant than her own heart, and their hero was seen across the\r\nbreakfast table every morning. They reflect Mrs. Browning's love for her\r\nhusband, and those who read them should read also Browning's answer in \"One\r\nWord More.\" Some of the sonnets (\"I Thought How Once\" and \"How Do I Love\r\nThee,\" for example) are very fine, and deserve their high place among love\r\npoems; but others, being too intimate, raise a question of taste in showing\r\none's heart throbs to the public. Some readers may question whether many of\r\nthe _Sonnets_ and most of the _Letters_ had not better been left\r\nexclusively to those for whom they were intended.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW ARNOLD (1822-1888). The work of this poet (a son of Dr. Arnold of\r\nRugby, made famous by _Tom Brown's Schooldays_) is in strong contrast\r\nto that of the Brownings, to the robust optimism of the one and to the\r\nemotionalism of the other. He was a man of two distinct moods: in his\r\npoetry he reflected the doubt or despair of those whose faith had been\r\nshaken by the alleged discoveries of science; in prose he became almost\r\nlight-hearted as he bantered middle-class Englishmen for their old-fogy\r\nprejudices, or tried to awaken them to the joys of culture. In both moods\r\nhe was coldly intellectual, appealing to the head rather than to the heart\r\nof his readers; and it is still a question whether his poetry or his\r\ncriticism will be longest remembered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE POET OF OXFORD]\r\n\r\nArnold is called the poet of Oxford, as Holmes is of Harvard, and those who\r\nknow the beautiful old college town will best appreciate certain verses in\r\nwhich he reflects the quiet loveliness of a scene that has impressed so\r\nmany students, century after century. To general readers one may safely\r\nrecommend Arnold's elegies written in memory of the poet Clough, such as\r\n\"Thyrsis\" and \"The Scholar Gypsy\"; certain poems reflecting the religious\r\ndoubts of the age, such as \"Dover Beach,\" \"Morality\" and \"The Future\"; the\r\nlove lyrics entitled \"Switzerland\"; and a few miscellaneous poems, such as\r\n\"Resignation,\" \"The Forsaken Merman,\" \"The Last Word,\" and \"Geist's Grave.\"\r\n\r\nTo these some critics would add the long narrative poem \"Sohrab and\r\nRustum,\" which is one of the models set before students of \"college\r\nEnglish.\" The reasons for the choice are not quite obvious; for the story,\r\nwhich is taken from the Persian _Shah Namah_, or Book of Kings, is\r\nrather coldly told, and the blank verse is far from melodious.\r\n\r\nIn reading these poems of Arnold his own motives should be borne in mind.\r\nHe tried to write on classic lines, repressing the emotions, holding to a\r\nsevere, unimpassioned style; and he proceeded on the assumption that poetry\r\nis \"a criticism of life.\" It is not quite clear what he meant by his\r\ndefinition, but he was certainly on the wrong trail. Poetry is the natural\r\nlanguage of man in moments of strong or deep feeling; it is the expression\r\nof life, of life at high tide or low tide; when it turns to criticism it\r\nloses its chief charm, as a flower loses its beauty and fragrance in the\r\nhands of a botanist. Some poets, however (Lucretius among the ancients,\r\nPope among the moderns, for example), have taken a different view of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATTHEW ARNOLD]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LITERARY CRITIC]\r\n\r\nArnold's chief prose works were written, curiously enough, after he was\r\nappointed professor of poetry at Oxford. There he proceeded, in a sincere\r\nbut somewhat toplofty way to enlighten the British public on the subject of\r\nculture. For years he was a kind of dictator of literary taste, and he is\r\nstill known as a master of criticism; but to examine his prose is to\r\ndiscover that it is notable for its even style and occasional good\r\nexpressions, such as \"sweetness and light,\" rather than for its\r\nilluminating ideas.\r\n\r\nFor example, in _Literature and Dogma_ and other books in which Arnold\r\nattempted to solve the problems of the age, he was apt to make large\r\ntheories from a small knowledge of his subject. So in his _Study of\r\nCeltic Literature_ (an interesting book, by the way) he wrote with\r\nsurprising confidence for one who had no first-hand acquaintance with his\r\nmaterial, and led his readers pleasantly astray in the flowery fields of\r\nCeltic poetry. Moreover, he had one favorite method of criticism, which was\r\nto take the bad lines of one poet and compare them with the good lines of\r\nanother,--a method which would make Shakespeare a sorry figure if he\r\nhappened to be on the wrong side of the comparison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHAT TO READ]\r\n\r\nIn brief, Arnold is always a stimulating and at times a provoking critic;\r\nhe stirs our thought, disturbs our pet prejudices, challenges our\r\nopposition; but he is not a very reliable guide in any field. What one\r\nshould read of his prose depends largely on one's personal taste. The essay\r\n_On Translating Homer_ is perhaps his most famous work, but few\r\nreaders are really interested in the question of hexameters. _Culture and\r\nAnarchy_ is his best plea for a combination of the moral and\r\nintellectual or, as he calls them, the Hebrew and Greek elements in our\r\nhuman education. Among the best of the shorter works are \"Emerson\" in\r\n_Discourses in America_, and \"Wordsworth,\" \"Byron\" and \"The Study of\r\nPoetry\" in _Essays in Criticism_.\r\n\r\nTHE PRE-RAPHAELITES. In the middle of the nineteenth century, or in 1848 to\r\nbe specific, a number of English poets and painters banded themselves\r\ntogether as a Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. [Footnote: The name was used\r\nearlier by some German artists, who worked together in Rome with the\r\npurpose of restoring art to the medieval simplicity and purity which, as\r\nwas alleged, it possessed before the time of the Italian painter Raphael.\r\nThe most famous artists of the English brotherhood were John Everett\r\nMillais and William Holman Hunt.] They aimed to make all art more simple,\r\nsincere, religious, and to restore \"the sense of wonder, reverence and awe\"\r\nwhich, they believed, had been lost since medieval times. Their sincerity\r\nwas unquestioned; their influence, though small, was almost wholly good;\r\nbut unfortunately they were, as Morris said, like men born out of due\r\nseason. They lived too much apart from their own age and from the great\r\nstream of common life out of which superior art proceeds. For there was\r\nnever a great book or a great picture that was not in the best sense\r\nrepresentative, that did not draw its greatness from the common ideals of\r\nthe age in which it was produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANOR HOUSE OF WILLIAM MORRIS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROSSETTI]\r\n\r\nThe first poet among the Pre-Raphaelites was Dante Gabriel Rossetti\r\n(1828-1882), the son of an exiled Italian writer. Like others of the group\r\nhe was both painter and poet, and seemed to be always trying to put into\r\nhis verse the rich coloring which belonged on canvas. Perhaps the most\r\nromantic episode of his life was, that upon the death of his wife (the\r\nbeautiful model, Lizzie Siddal, who appears in Millais' picture \"Ophelia\")\r\nhe buried his poetry with her. After some years his friends persuaded him\r\nthat his poems belonged to the living, and he exhumed and published them\r\n(_Poems_, 1870). His most notable volume, _Ballads and Sonnets_,\r\nappeared eleven years later. The ballads are nearly all weird, uncanny, but\r\nwith something in them of the witchery of Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner.\"\r\nThe sonnets under the general title of \"The House of Life\" are devoted to\r\nthe poet's lost love, and rank with Mrs. Browning's _From the\r\nPortuguese_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM MORRIS\r\nFrom a photograph by Walker and Cockerell]\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris (1834-1896) has been called by his admirers the most Homeric\r\nof English poets. The phrase was probably applied to him because of his\r\n_Sigurd the Volsung_, in which he uses the material of an old\r\nIcelandic saga. There is a captivating vigor and swing in this poem, but it\r\nlacks the poetic imagination of an earlier work, _The Defence of\r\nGuenevere,_ in which Morris retells in a new way some of the fading\r\nmedieval romances. His best-known work in poetry [Footnote: Some readers\r\nwill be more interested in Morris's prose romances, _The House of the\r\nWolfings_, _The Roots of the Mountains_ and _The Story of the\r\nGlittering Plain_] is _The Earthly Paradise_, a collection of\r\ntwenty-four stories strung together on a plan somewhat resembling that of\r\nthe _Canterbury Tales_. A band of mariners are cast away on an island\r\ninhabited by a superior race of men, and to while away the time the seamen\r\nand their hosts exchange stories. Some of these are from classic sources,\r\nothers from Norse legends or hero tales. The stories are gracefully told,\r\nin very good verse; but in reading them one has the impression that\r\nsomething essential is lacking, some touch, it may be, of present life and\r\nreality. For the island is but another Cloudland, and the characters are\r\nshadowy creatures having souls but no bodies; or else, as some may find,\r\nhaving the appearance of bodies and no souls whatever. Indeed, in reading\r\nthe greater part of Pre-Raphaelite literature, one is reminded of Morris's\r\nestimate of himself, in the Prelude to _The Earthly Paradise_:\r\n\r\n  Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time,\r\n  Why should I strive to set the crooked straight?\r\n  Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme\r\n  Beats with light wing against the ivory gate,\r\n  Telling a tale not too importunate\r\n  To those who in the sleepy region stay,\r\n  Lulled by the singer of an empty day.\r\n\r\nALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE (1837-1909). This voluminous writer, born in the\r\nyear of Victoria's accession, is yet so close to our own day that it is\r\ndifficult to think of him as part of an age that is gone. As a poet he was\r\na master of verbal melody, and had such a command of verse forms that he\r\nwon his title of \"inventor of harmonies.\" As a critic he showed a wide\r\nknowledge of English and French literature, a discriminating taste, and an\r\nenthusiasm which bubbled over in eulogy of those whom he liked, and which\r\nemptied vials of wrath upon Byron, Carlyle and others who fell under his\r\ndispleasure. His criticisms are written in an extravagant, almost a\r\ntorrential, style; at times his prose falls into a chanting rhythm so\r\nattractive in itself as to make us overlook the fact that the praise and\r\ncensure which he dispenses with prodigal liberality are too personal to be\r\nquite trustworthy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS POETRY]\r\n\r\nWe are still too near Swinburne to judge him accurately, and his place in\r\nthe long history of English poetry is yet to be determined. We note here\r\nonly two characteristics which may or may not be evident to other readers.\r\nIn the first place, with his marvelous command of meter and melody,\r\nSwinburne has a fatal fluency of speech which tends to bury his thought in\r\na mass of jingling verbiage. As we read we seem to hear the question, \"What\r\nreadest thou, Hamlet?\" and again the Dane makes answer, \"Words, words,\r\nwords.\" Again, like the Pre-Raphaelites with whom he was at one time\r\nassociated, Swinburne lived too much apart from the tide of common life. He\r\nwrote for the chosen few, and in the mass of his verse one must search long\r\nfor a passage of which one may say, This goes home to the hearts of men,\r\nand abides there in the treasure-house of all good poetry.\r\n\r\nAmong the longer works of Swinburne his masterpiece is the lyrical drama\r\n_Atalanta in Calydon_. If one would merely sample the flavor of the\r\npoet, such minor works as \"Itylus\" and the fine sea pieces, \"Off Shore,\"\r\n\"By the North Sea\" and \"A Forsaken Garden\" may be recommended. Nor should\r\nwe overlook what, to many, is Swinburne's best quality; namely, his love of\r\nchildren, as reflected in such poems as \"The Salt of the Earth\" and \"A\r\nChild's Laughter.\" Among the best of his prose works are his _William\r\nBlake_, _Essays and Studies_, _Miscellanies_ and _Studies in\r\nProse and Verse_.\r\n\r\nSONGS IN MANY KEYS. In calling attention to the above-named poets, we have\r\nmerely indicated a few who seem to be chief; but the judgment is a personal\r\none, and subject to challenge. The American critic Stedman, in his\r\n_Victorian Anthology_, recognizes two hundred and fifty singers; of\r\nthese eighty are represented by five or more poems; and of the eighty a few\r\nare given higher places than those we have selected as typical. There are\r\nmany readers who prefer the _Goblin Market_ of Christina Rossetti to\r\nanything produced by her gifted brother, who place Jean Ingelow above\r\nElizabeth Barrett, who find more pleasure in Edwin Arnold's _Light of\r\nAsia_ than in all the poems of Matthew Arnold, and who cannot be\r\ninterested in even the best of Pre-Raphaelite verse because of its\r\nunreality. Many men, many minds! Time has not yet recorded its verdict on\r\nthe Victorians, and until there is some settled criticism which shall\r\nexpress the judgment of several generations of men, the best plan for the\r\nbeginner is to make acquaintance with all the minor poets in an anthology\r\nor book of selections. It may even be a mistake to call any of these poets\r\nminor; for he who has written one song that lives in the hearts of men has\r\nproduced a work more enduring than the pyramids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. THE VICTORIAN NOVELISTS\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS (1812-1870)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DICKENS]\r\n\r\nAmong the Victorian novelists were two men who were frequent rivals in the\r\nrace for fame and fortune. Thackeray, well born and well bred, with\r\nartistic tastes and literary culture, looked doubtfully at the bustling\r\nlife around him, found his inspiration in a past age, and tried to uphold\r\nthe best traditions of English literature. Dickens, with little education\r\nand less interest in literary culture, looked with joy upon the struggle\r\nfor democracy, and with an observation that was almost microscopic saw all\r\nits picturesque details of speech and character and incident. He was the\r\neye of the mighty Victorian age, as Tennyson was its ear, and Browning its\r\npsychologist, and Carlyle its chronic grumbler.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. In the childhood of Dickens one may see a forecast of his\r\n    entire career. His father, a good-natured but shiftless man\r\n    (caricatured as Mr. Micawber in _David Copperfield_), was a\r\n    clerk in the Navy Pay Office, at Portsmouth. There Dickens was born\r\n    in 1812. The father's salary was £80 per year, enough at that time\r\n    to warrant living in middle-class comfort rather than in the\r\n    poverty of the lower classes, with whom Dickens is commonly\r\n    associated. The mother was a sentimental woman, whom Dickens, with\r\n    questionable taste, has caricatured as Mrs. Micawber and again as\r\n    Mrs. Nickleby. Both parents were somewhat neglectful of their\r\n    children, and uncommonly fond of creature comforts, especially of\r\n    good dinners and a bowl of punch. Though there is nothing in such a\r\n    family to explain Dickens's character, there is much to throw light\r\n    on the characters that appear in his novels.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE STAGE]\r\n\r\n    The boy himself was far from robust. Having no taste for sports, he\r\n    amused himself by reading romances or by listening to his nurse's\r\n    tales,--beautiful tales, he thought, which \"almost scared him into\r\n    fits.\" His elfish fancy in childhood is probably reflected in Pip,\r\n    of _Great Expectations_. He had a strong dramatic instinct to\r\n    act a story, or sing a song, or imitate a neighbor's speech, and\r\n    the father used to amuse his friends by putting little Charles on a\r\n    chair and encouraging him to mimicry,--a dangerous proceeding,\r\n    though it happened to turn out well in the case of Dickens.\r\n\r\n    This stagey tendency increased as the boy grew older. He had a\r\n    passion for private theatricals, and when he wrote a good story was\r\n    not satisfied till he had read it in public. When _Pickwick_\r\n    appeared (1837) the young man, till then an unknown reporter, was\r\n    brought before an immense audience which included a large part of\r\n    England and America. Thereafter he was never satisfied unless he\r\n    was in the public eye; his career was a succession of theatrical\r\n    incidents, of big successes, big lecture tours, big\r\n    audiences,--always the footlights, till he lay at last between the\r\n    pale wax tapers. But we are far ahead of our story.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE LONDON STREETS]\r\n\r\n    When Dickens was nine years old his family moved to London. There\r\n    the father fell into debt, and by the brutal laws of the period was\r\n    thrown into prison. The boy went to work in the cellar of a\r\n    blacking factory, and there began that intimate acquaintance with\r\n    lowly characters which he used later to such advantage. He has\r\n    described his bitter experience so often (in _David\r\n    Copperfield_ for instance) that the biographer may well pass\r\n    over it. We note only this significant fact: that wherever Dickens\r\n    went he had an instinct for exploration like that of a farm dog,\r\n    which will not rest in a place till he has first examined all the\r\n    neighborhood, putting his nose into every likely or unlikely spot\r\n    that may shelter friend or enemy. So Dickens used his spare hours\r\n    in roaming the byways of London by night, so he gained his\r\n    marvelous knowledge of that foreign land called The Street, with\r\n    its flitting life of gamins and nondescripts, through which we pass\r\n    daily as through an unknown country.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE SCRAMBLE FOR PLACE]\r\n\r\n    A small inheritance brought the father from prison, the family was\r\n    again united, and for two years the boy attended the academy which\r\n    he has held up to the laughter and scorn of two continents. There\r\n    the genius of Dickens seemed suddenly to awaken. He studied little,\r\n    being given to pranks and theatricals, but he discovered within him\r\n    an immense ambition, an imperious will to win a place and a name in\r\n    the great world, and a hopeful temper that must carry him over or\r\n    under all obstacles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GADSHILL PLACE, NEAR ROCHESTER\r\n    The last residence of Dickens]\r\n\r\n    No sooner was his discovery made than he left school and entered a\r\n    law office, where he picked up enough knowledge to make court\r\n    practices forever ridiculous, in _Bleak House_ and other\r\n    stories. He studied shorthand and quickly mastered it; then\r\n    undertook to report parliamentary speeches (a good training in\r\n    oratory) and presently began a prosperous career as a reporter.\r\n    This had two advantages; it developed his natural taste for odd\r\n    people and picturesque incidents, and it brought him close to the\r\n    great reading public. To please that public, to humor its whims and\r\n    prejudices, its love for fun and tears and sentimentality, was\r\n    thereafter the ruling motive in Dickens's life.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LITERARY VENTURES]\r\n\r\n    His first literary success came with some short stories contributed\r\n    to the magazines, which appeared in book form as _Sketches by\r\n    Boz_ (1835). A publisher marked these sketches, engaged Dickens\r\n    to write the text or letterpress for some comic pictures, and the\r\n    result was _Pickwick_, which took England and America by\r\n    storm. Then followed _Oliver Twist_, _Nicholas Nickleby_,\r\n    _Old Curiosity Shop_,--a flood of works that made readers rub\r\n    their eyes, wondering if such a fountain of laughter and tears were\r\n    inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n    There is little else to record except this: that from the time of\r\n    his first triumph Dickens held his place as the most popular writer\r\n    in English. With his novels he was not satisfied, but wrote a\r\n    history of England, and edited various popular magazines, such as\r\n    _Household Words_. Also he gave public readings, reveling in\r\n    the applause, the lionizing, which greeted him wherever he went. He\r\n    earned much money; he bought the place \"Gadshill,\" near Rochester,\r\n    which he had coveted since childhood; but he was a free spender,\r\n    and his great income was less than his fancied need. To increase\r\n    his revenue he \"toured\" the States in a series of readings from his\r\n    own works, and capitalized his experience in _American Notes_\r\n    and parts of _Martin Chuzzlewit_.\r\n\r\n    A question of taste must arise even now in connection with these\r\n    works. Dickens had gone to a foreign country for just two things,\r\n    money and applause; he received both in full measure; then he bit\r\n    the friendly hand which had given him what he wanted. [Footnote:\r\n    The chief source of Dickens's irritation was the money loss\r\n    resulting from the \"pirating\" of his stories. There was no\r\n    international copyright in those days; the works of any popular\r\n    writer were freely appropriated by foreign publishers. This custom\r\n    was wrong, undoubtedly, but it had been in use for centuries.\r\n    Scott's novels had been pirated the same way; and until Cooper got\r\n    to windward of the pirates (by arranging for foreign copyrights)\r\n    his work was stolen freely in England and on the Continent. But\r\n    Dickens saw only his own grievance, and even at public dinners was\r\n    apt to make his hosts uncomfortable by proclaiming his rights or\r\n    denouncing their moral standards. Moreover, he had a vast conceit\r\n    of himself, and, like most visitors of a week, thought he knew\r\n    America like a book. It was as if he looked once at the welter cast\r\n    ashore by mighty Lake Superior in a storm, and said, \"What a dirty\r\n    sea!\"] Thackeray, who followed him to America, had a finer sense of\r\n    the laws of hospitality and good breeding.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE PRICE OF POPULARITY]\r\n\r\n    In 1844 Dickens resolved to make both ends meet, and carried out\r\n    his resolve with promptness and precision. To decrease expenses he\r\n    went to the Continent, and lived there, hungry for the footlights,\r\n    till a series of stories ending with _Dombey and Son_ put his\r\n    finances on a secure basis. Then he returned to London, wrote more\r\n    novels, and saved a fortune for his descendants, who promptly spent\r\n    it. Evidently it was a family trait. More and more he lived on his\r\n    nerves, grew imperious, exacting, till he separated from his wife\r\n    and made wreck of domestic happiness. The self-esteem of which he\r\n    made comedy in his novels was for him a tragedy. Also he resumed\r\n    the public readings, with their false glory and nervous wear and\r\n    tear, which finally brought him to the grave.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DICKEN'S BIRTHPLACE, LANDPORT, PORTSEA]\r\n\r\n    He died, worn out by his own exertions, in 1870. He had steadily\r\n    refused titles and decorations, but a grateful nation laid his body\r\n    to rest in the Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey. It is doubtful\r\n    whether he would have accepted this honor, which was forced upon\r\n    him, for he had declared proudly that by his works alone he would\r\n    live in the memory of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF DICKENS. In the early stories of Dickens is a promise of all the\r\nrest. His first work was called _Sketches by Boz_, and \"Boz\" was\r\ninvented by some little girl (was it in _The Vicar of Wakefield?_) who\r\ncould not say \"Moses\"; also it was a pet name for a small brother of\r\nDickens. There was, therefore, something childlike in this first title, and\r\nchildhood was to enter very largely into the novelist's work. He could\r\nhardly finish a story without bringing a child into it; not an ordinary\r\nchild, to make us smile,  but a wistful or pathetic child whose sorrows,\r\nsince we cannot help them, are apt to make our hearts ache.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PATHETIC ELEMENT]\r\n\r\nDickens is charged with exaggerating the woes of his children, and the\r\ncharge is true; but he had a very human reason for his method. In the first\r\nplace, the pathetic quality of his children is due to this simple fact,\r\nthat they bear the burden and the care of age. And burdens which men or\r\nwomen accept for themselves without complaint seem all wrong, and are\r\nwrong, when laid upon a child's innocent shoulders. Again, Dickens sought\r\nto show us our error in thinking, as most grown-ups do, that childish\r\ntroubles are of small account. So they are, to us; but to the child they\r\nare desperately real. Later in life we learn that troubles are not\r\npermanent, and so give them their proper place; but in childhood a trouble\r\nis the whole world; and a very hopeless world it is while it lasts. Dickens\r\nknew and loved children, as he knew the public whom he made to cry with his\r\nLittle Nell and Tiny Tim; and he had discovered that tears are the key to\r\nmany a heart at which reason knocks in vain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PICKWICKIAN HUMOR]\r\n\r\nThe second work, _Pickwick,_ written in a harum-scarum way, is even\r\nmore typical of Dickens in its spirit of fun and laughter. He had been\r\nengaged, as we have noted, to furnish a text for some comic drawings, thus\r\nreversing the usual order of illustration. The pictures were intended to\r\npoke fun at a club of sportsmen; and Dickens, who knew nothing of sport,\r\nbravely set out with Mr. Winkle on his rook-shooting. Then, while the story\r\nwas appearing in monthly numbers, the illustrator committed suicide;\r\nDickens was left with Mr. Pickwick on his hands, and that innocent old\r\ngentleman promptly ran away with the author. Not being in the least\r\nadventurous, Mr. Pickwick was precisely the person for whom adventures were\r\nlying in wait; but with his chivalrous heart within him, and Sam Weller on\r\nguard outside, he was not to be trifled with by cabman or constable. So\r\nthese two took to the open road, and to the inns where punch, good cheer\r\nand the unexpected were awaiting them. Never was such another book! It is\r\nnot a novel; it is a medley of fun and drollery resulting from high animal\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MOTIVE OF HORROR]\r\n\r\nIn his next novel, _Oliver Twist_, the author makes a new departure by\r\nusing the motive of horror. One of his heroes is an unfortunate child, but\r\nwhen our sympathies for the little fellow are stretched to the point of\r\ntears, Dickens turns over a page and relieves us by Pickwickian laughter.\r\nAlso he has his usual medley of picturesque characters and incidents, but\r\nthe shadow of Fagin is over them all. One cannot go into any house in the\r\nbook, and lock the door and draw the shades, without feeling that somewhere\r\nin the outer darkness this horrible creature is prowling. The horror which\r\nFagin inspires is never morbid; for Dickens with his healthy spirit could\r\nnot err in this direction. It is a boyish, melodramatic horror, such as\r\nimmature minds seek in \"movies,\" dime novels, secret societies, detective\r\nstories and \"thrillers\" at the circus.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth work, _Nicholas Nickleby_, Dickens shows that he is\r\nnearing the limit of his invention so far as plot is concerned. In this\r\nnovel he seems to rest a bit by writing an old-fashioned romance, with its\r\nhero and villain and moral ending. But if you study this or any subsequent\r\nwork of Dickens, you are apt to find the four elements already noted;\r\nnamely, an unfortunate child, humorous interludes, a grotesque or horrible\r\ncreature who serves as a foil to virtue or innocence, and a medley of\r\ncharacters good or bad that might be transferred without change to any\r\nother story. The most interesting thing about Dickens's men and women is\r\nthat they are human enough to make themselves at home anywhere.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO READ. Whether one wants to study the method of Dickens or to enjoy\r\nhis works, there is hardly a better plan for the beginner than to read in\r\nsuccession _Pickwick_, _Oliver Twist_ and _Nicholas\r\nNickleby_, which are as the seed plot out of which grow all his stories.\r\nFor the rest, the reader must follow his own fancy. If one must choose a\r\nsingle work, perhaps _Copperfield_ is the most typical. \"Of all my\r\nbooks,\" said Dickens, \"I like this the best; like many parents I have my\r\nfavorite child, and his name is David Copperfield.\" Some of the heroines of\r\nthis book are rather stagey, but the Peggotys, Betsy Trotwood, Mrs.\r\nGummidge, the Micawbers,--all these are unrivaled. \"There is no writing\r\nagainst such power,\" said Thackeray, who was himself writing\r\n_Pendennis_ while Dickens was at work on his masterpiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARD OF REINDEER INN, DANBURY\r\nThe scene of the races, in _Old Curiosity Shop_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TALE OF TWO CITIES]\r\n\r\nOpinion is divided on the matter of _A Tale of Two Cities_. Some\r\ncritics regard it as the finest of Dickens's work, revealing as it does his\r\npowers of description and of character-drawing without his usual\r\nexaggeration. Other critics, who regard the exaggeration of Dickens as his\r\nmost characteristic quality, see in _Two Cities_ only an evidence of\r\nhis weakening power. It has perhaps this advantage over other works of the\r\nauthor, that of them we remember only the extraordinary scenes or\r\ncharacters, while the entire story of _Two Cities_ remains with us as\r\na finished and impressive thing. But there is also this disadvantage, that\r\nthe story ends and is done with, while _Pickwick_ goes on forever. We\r\nmay lose sight of the heroes, but we have the conviction, as Chesterton\r\nsays, that they are still on the road of adventure, that Mr. Pickwick is\r\nsomewhere drinking punch or making a speech, and that Sam Weller may step\r\nout from behind the next stable and ask with a droll wink what we are up to\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that our reading of Dickens must not end\r\nuntil we are familiar with some of his Yuletide stories, in which he gladly\r\nfollowed the lead of Washington Irving. The best of all his short stories\r\nis _A Christmas Carol_, which one must read but not criticize. At best\r\nit is a farce, but a glorious, care-lifting, heart-warming farce. Would\r\nthere were more of the same kind!\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF DICKENS. The first quality of Dickens is his extravagant\r\nhumor. This was due to the fact that he was alive, so thoroughly,\r\nconsciously alive that his vitality overflowed like a spring. Here, in a\r\nword, is the secret of that bubbling spirit of prodigality which occasions\r\nthe criticism that Dickens produced not characters but caricatures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS EXAGGERATION]\r\n\r\nThe criticism is true; but it proclaims the strength of the novelist rather\r\nthan his weakness. Indeed, it is in the very exaggeration of Dickens that\r\nhis astonishing creative power is most clearly manifest. There is something\r\nprimal, stupendous, in his grotesque characters which reminds us of the\r\nuncouth monsters that nature created in her sportive moods. Some readers,\r\nmeeting with Bunsby, are reminded of a walrus; and who ever saw a walrus\r\nwithout thinking of the creature as nature's Bunsby? So with Quilp, Toots,\r\nSqueers, Pumblechook; so with giraffes, baboons, dodoes, dromedaries,--all\r\nare freaks from the æsthetic viewpoint, but think of the overflowing energy\r\nimplied in creating them!\r\n\r\nThe same sense of prodigality characterized Dickens even in his sober\r\nmoods, when he portrayed hundreds of human characters, and not a dead or\r\ndull person among them. To be sure they are all exaggerated; they weep too\r\ncopiously, eat or drink too intemperately, laugh too uproariously for\r\nnormal men; but to criticize their superabundant vitality is to criticize\r\nBeowulf or Ulysses or Hiawatha; nay, it is to criticize life itself, which\r\nat high tide is wont to overflow in heroics or absurdity. The exuberance of\r\nPickwick, Micawber, Pecksniff, Sairey Gamp, Sam Weller and a host of others\r\nis perhaps the most normal thing about them; it is as the rattling of a\r\nsafety valve, which speaks not of stagnant water but of a full head of\r\nsteam. For Dickens deals with life, and you can exaggerate life as much as\r\nyou please, since there is no end to either its wisdom or foolishness.\r\nNothing but a question can be added to the silent simplicity of death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATEHOUSE AT ROCHESTER, NEAR DICKENS'S HOME]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS MOTIVE AND METHOD]\r\n\r\nAside from his purpose of portraying life as he saw it, in all its strange\r\ncomplexity, Dickens had a twofold object in writing. He was a radical\r\ndemocrat, and he aimed to show the immense hopefulness and compassion of\r\nDemocracy on its upward way to liberty. He was also a reformer, with a\r\nprofound respect for the poor, but no respect whatever for ancient laws or\r\ninstitutions that stood in the way of justice. The influence of his novels\r\nin establishing better schools, prisons, workhouses, is beyond measure; but\r\nwe are not so much interested in his reforms as in his method, which was\r\nunique. He aimed to make men understand the oppressed, and to make a\r\nlaughing stock of the oppressors; and he succeeded as no other had ever\r\ndone in making literature a power in the land. Thus, the man or the law\r\nthat stands defiantly against public opinion is beaten the moment you make\r\nthat man or that law look like a joke; and Dickens made a huge joke of the\r\nparish beadle (as Mr. Bumble) and of many another meddlesome British\r\ninstitution. Moreover, he was master of this paradox: that to cure misery\r\nyou must meet it with a merry heart,--this is on the principle that what\r\nthe poor need is not charity but comradeship. By showing that humble folk\r\nmight be as poor as the Cratchits and yet have the medicine of mirth, the\r\ndivine gift of laughter, he made men rejoice with the poor even while they\r\nrelieved the poverty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS FAULTS]\r\n\r\nAs for the shortcomings of Dickens, they are so apparent that he who runs\r\nmay read. We may say of him, as of Shakespeare, that his taste is\r\nquestionable, that he is too fond of a mere show, that his style is often\r\nmelodramatic, that there is hardly a fault in the whole critical category\r\nof which he is not habitually guilty. But we may say of him also that he is\r\nnever petty or mean or morbid or unclean; and he could not be dull if he\r\ntried. His faults, if you analyze them, spring from precisely the same\r\nsource as his virtues; that is, from his abundant vitality, from his excess\r\nof life and animal spirits. So we pardon, nay, we rejoice over him as over\r\na boy who must throw a handspring or raise a _whillilew_ when he\r\nbreaks loose from school. For Dickens, when he started his triumphal\r\nprogress with _Pickwick_, had a glorious sense of taking his cue from\r\nlife and of breaking loose from literary traditions. In comparison with\r\nRuskin or Thackeray he is not a good writer, but something more--a\r\nsplendidly great writer. If you would limit or define his greatness, try\r\nfirst to marshal his array of characters, characters so vital and human\r\nthat we can hardly think of them as fictitious or imaginary creatures; then\r\nremember the millions of men and women to whom he has given pure and\r\nlasting pleasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY (1811-1863)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY\r\nFrom a drawing by Samuel Laurence]\r\n\r\nIn fiction Thackeray stands to Dickens as Hamilton to Jefferson in the\r\nfield of politics. The radical difference between the novelists is\r\nexemplified in their attitude toward the public. Thackeray, who lived among\r\nthe privileged classes, spoke of \"this great stupid public,\" and thought\r\nthat the only way to get a hearing from the common people was to \"take them\r\nby the ears.\" He was a true Hamiltonian. Dickens had an immense sympathy\r\nfor the common people, a profound respect for their elemental virtues; and\r\nin writing for them he was, as it were, the Jefferson, the triumphant\r\ndemocrat of English letters. Thackeray was intellectual; he looked at men\r\nwith critical eyes, and was a realist and a pessimist. Dickens was\r\nemotional; he looked at men with kindled imagination, judged them by the\r\ndreams they cherished in their hearts, and was a romanticist and an\r\noptimist. Both men were humorists; but where Thackeray was delicately\r\nsatirical, causing us a momentary smile, Dickens was broadly comic or\r\nfarcical, winning us by hearty laughter.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. To one who has been trained, like Dickens, in the school of\r\n    hardship it seems the most natural thing in the world to pass over\r\n    into a state of affluence. It is another matter to fare sumptuously\r\n    every day till luxurious habits are formed, and then be cast\r\n    suddenly on one's own resources, face to face with the unexpected\r\n    monster of bread and butter. This was Thackeray's experience, and\r\n    it colored all his work.\r\n\r\n    A second important matter is that Thackeray had a great tenderness\r\n    for children, a longing for home and homely comforts; but as a\r\n    child he was sent far from his home in India, and was thrown among\r\n    young barbarians in various schools, one of which, the\r\n    \"Charterhouse,\" was called the \"Slaughterhouse\" in the boy's\r\n    letters to his mother. \"There are three hundred and seventy boys in\r\n    this school,\" wrote; \"I wish there were only three hundred and\r\n    sixty-nine!\" He married for love, and with great joy began\r\n    housekeeping; then a terrible accident happened, his wife was taken\r\n    to an insane asylum, and for the rest of his life Thackeray was a\r\n    wanderer amid the empty splendors of clubs and hotels.\r\n\r\n    These two experiences did not break Thackeray, but they bowed him.\r\n    They help to explain the languor, the melancholy, the gentle\r\n    pessimism, as if life had no more sunrises, of which we are vaguely\r\n    conscious in reading _The Virginians_ or _The Newcomes_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: EARLY YEARS]\r\n\r\n    Thackeray was born (1811) in Calcutta, of a family of English\r\n    \"nabobs\" who had accumulated wealth and influence as factors or\r\n    civil officers. At the death of his father, who was a judge in\r\n    Bengal, the child was sent to England to be educated. Here is a\r\n    significant incident of the journey:\r\n\r\n        \"Our ship touched at an island, where my black servant took\r\n        me a walk over rocks and hills till we passed a garden,\r\n        where we saw a man walking. 'That is Bonaparte,' said the\r\n        black; 'he eats three sheep every day, and all the children\r\n        he can lay hands on.'\"\r\n\r\n    Napoleon was then safely imprisoned at St. Helena; but his shadow,\r\n    as of a terrible ogre, was still dark over Europe.\r\n\r\n    Thackeray's education, at the Charterhouse School and at Cambridge,\r\n    was neither a happy nor a profitable experience, as we judge from\r\n    his unflattering picture of English school life in\r\n    _Pendennis_. He had a strongly artistic bent, and after\r\n    leaving college studied art in Germany and France. Presently he\r\n    lost his fortune by gambling and bad investments, and was\r\n    confronted by the necessity of earning his living. He tried the\r\n    law, but gave it up because, as he said, it had no soul. He tried\r\n    illustrating, having a small talent for comic drawings, and sought\r\n    various civil appointments in vain. As a last resource he turned to\r\n    the magazines, wrote satires, sketches of travel, burlesques of\r\n    popular novelists, and, fighting all the time against his habit of\r\n    idleness, slowly but surely won his way.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LITERARY LABOR]\r\n\r\n    His first notable work, _Vanity Fair_ (1847), won a few\r\n    readers' and the critics' judgment that it was \"a book written by a\r\n    gentleman for gentlemen\" was the foundation of Thackeray's\r\n    reputation as a writer for the upper classes. Other notable novels\r\n    followed, _Henry Esmond_, _Pendennis_, _The\r\n    Newcomes_, _The Virginians_, and two series of literary and\r\n    historical essays called _English Humorists_ and _The Four\r\n    Georges_. The latter were delivered as lectures in a successful\r\n    tour of England and America. Needless to say, Thackeray hated\r\n    lecturing and publicity; he was driven to his \"dollar-hunting\" by\r\n    necessity.\r\n\r\n    In 1860 his fame was firmly established, and he won his first\r\n    financial success by taking charge of the _Cornhill Magazine_,\r\n    which prospered greatly in his hands. He did not long enjoy his\r\n    new-found comfort, for he died in 1863. His early sketches had been\r\n    satirical in spirit, his first novels largely so; but his last\r\n    novels and his Cornhill essays were written in a different\r\n    spirit,--not kinder, for Thackeray's heart was always right, but\r\n    broader, wiser, more patient of human nature, and more hopeful.\r\n\r\n    In view of these later works some critics declare that Thackeray's\r\n    best novel was never written. His stories were produced not\r\n    joyously but laboriously, to earn his living; and when leisure came\r\n    at last, then came death also, and the work was over.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF THACKERAY. It would be flying in the face of all the critics to\r\nsuggest that the beginner might do well to postpone the famous novels of\r\nThackeray, and to meet the author at his best, or cheerfulest, in such\r\nforgotten works as the _Book of Ballads_ and _The Rose and the\r\nRing_. The latter is a kind of fairy story, with a poor little good\r\nprincess, a rich little bad princess, a witch of a godmother, and such\r\nvillainous characters as Hedzoff and Gruffanuff. It was written for some\r\nchildren whom Thackeray loved, and is almost the only book of his which\r\nleaves the impression that the author found any real pleasure in writing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HENRY ESMOND]\r\n\r\nIf one must begin with a novel, then _Henry Esmond_ (1852) is the\r\nbook. This is an historical novel; the scene is laid in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, during the reign of Queen Anne; and it differs from most other\r\nhistorical novels in this important respect: the author knows his ground\r\nthoroughly, is familiar not only with political events but with the\r\nthoughts, ideals, books, even the literary style of the age which he\r\ndescribes. The hero of the novel, Colonel Esmond, is represented as telling\r\nhis own story; he speaks as a gentleman spoke in those days, telling us\r\nabout the politicians, soldiers, ladies and literary men of his time, with\r\nfrank exposure of their manners or morals. As a realistic portrayal of an\r\nage gone by, not only of its thoughts but of the very language in which\r\nthose thoughts were expressed, _Esmond_ is the most remarkable novel\r\nof its kind in our language. It is a prodigy of realism, and it is written\r\nin a charming prose style.\r\n\r\nOne must add frankly that _Esmond_ is not an inspiring work, that the\r\natmosphere is gloomy, and the plot a disappointment. The hero, after ten\r\nyears of devotion to a woman, ends his romance by happily marrying with her\r\nmother. Any reader could have told him that this is what he ought to have\r\ndone, or tried to do, in the beginning; but Thackeray's heroes will never\r\ntake the reader's good advice. In this respect they are quite human.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VANITY FAIR]\r\n\r\nThe two social satires of Thackeray are _Vanity Fair_ (1847) and\r\n_The History of Arthur Pendennis_ (1849). The former takes its title\r\nfrom that fair described in _Pilgrim's Progress_, where all sorts of\r\ncheats are exposed for sale; and Thackeray makes his novel a moralizing\r\nexposition of the shams of society. The slight action of the story revolves\r\nabout two unlovely heroines, the unprincipled Becky Sharp and the spineless\r\nAmelia. We call them both unlovely, though Thackeray tries hard to make us\r\nadmire his tearful Amelia and to detest his more interesting Becky. Meeting\r\nthese two contrasting characters is a variety of fools and snobs, mostly\r\nwell-drawn, all carefully analyzed to show the weakness or villainy that is\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nOne interesting but unnoticed thing about these minor characters is that\r\nthey all have their life-size prototypes in the novels of Dickens.\r\nThackeray's characters, as he explains in his preface, are \"mere puppets,\"\r\nwho must move when he pulls the strings. Dickens does not have to explain\r\nthat his characters are men and women who do very much as they please. That\r\nis, perhaps, the chief difference between the two novelists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PENDENNIS]\r\n\r\n_Pendennis_ is a more readable novel than _Vanity Fair_ in this\r\nrespect, that its interest centers in one character rather than in a\r\nvariety of knaves or fools. Thackeray takes a youthful hero, follows him\r\nthrough school and later life, and shows the steady degeneration of a man\r\nwho is governed not by vicious but by selfish impulses. From beginning to\r\nend _Pendennis_ is a penetrating ethical study (like George Eliot's\r\n_Romola_), and the story is often interrupted while we listen to the\r\nauthor's moralizing. To some readers this is an offense; to others it is a\r\npleasure, since it makes them better acquainted with the mind and heart of\r\nThackeray, the gentlest of Victorian moralists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AFTERTHOUGHTS]\r\n\r\nThe last notable works of Thackeray are like afterthoughts. _The\r\nVirginians_ continues the story of Colonel Esmond, and _The\r\nNewcomes_ recounts the later fortunes of Arthur Pendennis. _The\r\nVirginians_ has two or three splendid scenes, and some critics regard\r\n_The Newcomes_ as the finest expression of the author's genius; but\r\nboth works, which appeared in the leisurely form of monthly instalments,\r\nare too languid in action for sustained interest. We grow acquainted with\r\ncertain characters, and are heartily glad when they make their exit;\r\nperhaps someone else will come, some adventurer from the road or the inn,\r\nto relieve the dullness. The door opens, and in comes the bore again to\r\ntake another leave. That is realism, undoubtedly; and Laura Pendennis is as\r\nrealistic as the mumps, which one may catch a second time. The atmosphere\r\nof both novels--indeed, of all Thackeray's greater works, with the\r\nexception of _English Humorists_ and _The Four Georges_--is\r\nrather depressing. One gets the impression that life among \"the quality\" is\r\na dreary experience, hardly worth the effort of living.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHARTERHOUSE SCHOOL\r\n  After a rare engraving by J. Rogers from the drawing made by Thomas H.\r\n  Shepherd at the time Thackeray was a student there]\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY: A CRITICISM. It is significant that Thackeray's first work\r\nappeared in a college leaflet called \"The Snob,\" and that it showed a\r\ntalent for satire. In his earlier stories he plainly followed his natural\r\nbent, for his _Vanity Fair_, _Barry Lyndon_ (a story of a\r\nscoundrelly adventurer) and several minor works are all satires on the\r\ngeneral snobbery of society. This tendency of the author reached a climax\r\nin 1848, when he wrote _The Book of Snobs._ It is still an\r\nentertaining book, witty, and with a kind of merciless fairness about its\r\ncruel passages; yet some readers will remember what the author himself said\r\nlater, that he was something of a snob himself to write such a book. The\r\nchief trouble with the half of his work is that he was so obsessed with the\r\nidea of snobbery that he did injustice to humanity, or rather to his\r\ncountrymen; for Thackeray was very English, and interest in his characters\r\ndepends largely on familiarity with the life he describes. His pictures of\r\nEnglish servants, for instance, are wonderfully deft, though one might wish\r\nthat he had drawn them with a more sympathetic pencil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PERSONAL ELEMENT]\r\n\r\nIn the later part of his life the essential kindness of the man came to the\r\nsurface, but still was he hampered by his experience and his philosophy.\r\nHis experience was that life is too big to be grasped, too mysterious to be\r\nunderstood; therefore he faced life doubtfully, with a mixture of timidity\r\nand respect, as in _Henry Esmond_. His philosophy was that every\r\nperson is at heart an egoist, is selfish in spite of himself; therefore is\r\nevery man or woman unhappy, because selfishness is the eternal enemy of\r\nhappiness. This is the lesson written large in _Pendennis_. He lived\r\nin the small world of his own class, while the great world of Dickens--the\r\nworld of the common people, with their sympathy, their eternal hopefulness,\r\ntheir enjoyment of whatever good they find in life--passed unnoticed\r\noutside his club windows. He conceived it to be the business of a novelist\r\nto view the world with his own eyes, to describe it as he saw it; and it\r\nwas not his fault that his world was a small one. Fate was answerable for\r\nthat. So far as he went, Thackeray did his work admirably, portraying the\r\nfew virtues and the many shams of his set with candor and sincerity. Though\r\nhe used satire freely (and satire is a two-edged weapon), his object was\r\nnever malicious or vindictive but corrective; he aimed to win or drive men\r\nto virtue by exposing the native ugliness of vice.\r\n\r\nThe result of his effort may be summed up as follows: Thackeray is a\r\nnovelist for the few who can enjoy his accurate but petty views of society,\r\nand his cultivated prose style. He is not very cheerful; he does not seek\r\nthe blue flower that grows in every field, or the gold that is at every\r\nrainbow's end, or the romance that hides in every human heart whether of\r\nrich or poor. Therefore are the young not conspicuous among his followers.\r\n\r\n       *       *      *       *        *\r\n\r\nMARY ANN EVANS, \"GEORGE ELIOT\" (1819-1880)\r\n\r\nMore than other Victorian story-tellers George Eliot regarded her work with\r\ngreat seriousness as a means of public instruction. Her purpose was to show\r\nthat human life is effective only as it follows its sense of duty, and that\r\nsociety is as much in need of the moral law as of daily bread. Other\r\nnovelists moralized more or less, Thackeray especially; but George Eliot\r\nmade the teaching of morality her chief business.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. In the work as in the face of George Eliot there is a certain\r\n    masculine quality which is apt to mislead one who reads _Adam\r\n    Bede_ or studies a portrait of the author. Even those who knew\r\n    her well, and who tried to express the charm of her personality,\r\n    seem to have overlooked the fact that they were describing a woman.\r\n    For example, a friend wrote:\r\n\r\n        \"Everything in her aspect and presence was in keeping with\r\n        the bent of her soul. The deeply lined face, the too marked\r\n        and massive features, were united with an air of delicate\r\n        refinement, which in one way was the more impressive,\r\n        because it seemed to proceed so entirely from within. Nay,\r\n        the inward beauty would sometimes quite transform the\r\n        outward harshness; there would be moments when the thin\r\n        hands that entwined themselves in their eagerness, the\r\n        earnest figure that bowed forward to speak and hear, the\r\n        deep gaze moving from one face to another with a grave\r\n        appeal,--all these seemed the transparent symbols that\r\n        showed the presence of a wise, benignant soul.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A CLINGING VINE]\r\n\r\n    That is very good, but somehow it is not feminine. So the\r\n    impression has gone forth that George Eliot was a \"strong-minded\"\r\n    woman; but that is far from the truth. One might emphasize her\r\n    affectionate nature, her timidity, her lack of confidence in her\r\n    own judgment; but the essence of the matter is this, that so\r\n    dependent was she on masculine support that she was always\r\n    idealizing some man, and looking up to him as a superior being. In\r\n    short, she was one of \"the clinging kind.\" Though some may regard\r\n    this as traditional nonsense, it was nevertheless the most\r\n    characteristic quality of the woman with whom we are dealing.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HER GIRLHOOD]\r\n\r\n    Mary Ann Evans, or Marian as she was called, was born (1819) and\r\n    spent her childhood in Shakespeare's county of Warwickshire. Her\r\n    father (whose portrait she has faintly drawn in the characters of\r\n    Adam Bede and Caleb Garth) was a strong, quiet man, a farmer and\r\n    land agent, who made a companion of his daughter rather than of his\r\n    son, the two being described more or less faithfully in the\r\n    characters of Maggie and Tom Tulliver in _The Mill on the\r\n    Floss_. At twelve years of age she was sent to a boarding\r\n    school; at fifteen her mother died, and she was brought home to\r\n    manage her father's house. The rest of her education--which\r\n    included music and a reading knowledge of German, Italian and\r\n    Greek--was obtained by solitary study at intervals of rest from\r\n    domestic work. That the intervals were neither long nor frequent\r\n    may be inferred from the fact that her work included not only her\r\n    father's accounts and the thousand duties of housekeeping but also\r\n    the managing of a poultry yard, the making of butter, and other\r\n    farm or dairy matters which at that time were left wholly to women.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GEORGE ELIOT\r\n    From a portrait painted in Rome by M. d'Albert Durade, and now in\r\n    Geneva]\r\n\r\n    The first marked change in her life came at the age of twenty-two,\r\n    when the household removed to Coventry, and Miss Evans was there\r\n    brought in contact with the family of a wealthy ribbon-maker named\r\n    Bray. He was a man of some culture, and the atmosphere of his\r\n    house, with its numerous guests, was decidedly skeptical. To Miss\r\n    Evans, brought up in a home ruled by early Methodist ideals of\r\n    piety, the change was a little startling. Soon she was listening to\r\n    glib evolutionary theories that settled everything from an\r\n    earthworm to a cosmos; next she was eagerly reading such unbaked\r\n    works as Bray's _Philosophy of Necessity_ and the essays of\r\n    certain young scientists who, without knowledge of either\r\n    philosophy or religion, were cocksure of their ability to provide\r\n    \"modern\" substitutes for both at an hour's notice.\r\n\r\n    Miss Evans went over rather impulsively to the crude skepticism of\r\n    her friends; then, finding no soul or comfort in their theories,\r\n    she invented for herself a creed of duty and morality, without\r\n    however tracing either to its origin. She was naturally a religious\r\n    woman, and there is no evidence that she found her new creed very\r\n    satisfactory. Indeed, her melancholy and the gloom of her novels\r\n    are both traceable to the loss of her early religious ideals.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HER UNION WITH LEWES]\r\n\r\n    A trip abroad (1849) was followed by some editorial work on _The\r\n    Westminster Review_, then the organ of the freethinkers. This in\r\n    turn led to her association with Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill\r\n    and other liberals, and to her union with George Henry Lewes in\r\n    1854. Of that union little need be said except this: though it\r\n    lacked the law and the sacrament, it seems to have been in other\r\n    respects a fair covenant which was honestly kept by both parties.\r\n    [Footnote: Lewes was separated from his first wife, from whom he\r\n    was unable to obtain a legal divorce. This was the only obstacle to\r\n    a regular marriage, and after facing the obstacle for a time the\r\n    couple decided to ignore it. The moral element in George Eliot's\r\n    works is due largely, no doubt, to her own moral sense; but it was\r\n    greatly influenced by the fact that, in her union with Lewes, she\r\n    had placed herself in a false position and was morally on the\r\n    defensive against society.]\r\n\r\n    Encouraged by Lewes she began to write fiction. Her first attempt,\r\n    \"Amos Barton,\" was an excellent short story, and in 1859 she\r\n    produced her first novel, _Adam Bede_, being then about forty\r\n    years old. The great success of this work had the unusual effect of\r\n    discouraging the author. She despaired of her ability, and began to\r\n    agonize, as she said, over her work; but her material was not yet\r\n    exhausted, and in _The Mill on the Floss_ and _Silas\r\n    Marner_ she repeated her triumph.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: ON A PEDESTAL]\r\n\r\n    The rest of her life seems a matter of growth or of atrophy,\r\n    according to your point of view. She grew more scientific, as she\r\n    fancied, but she lost the freshness and inspiration of her earlier\r\n    novels. The reason seems to be that her head was turned by her fame\r\n    as a moralist and exponent of culture; so she forgot that she \"was\r\n    born to please,\" and attempted something else for which she had no\r\n    particular ability: an historical novel in _Romola_, a drama\r\n    in _The Spanish Gypsy_, a theory of social reform in _Felix\r\n    Holt_, a study of the Hebrew race in _Daniel Deronda_, a\r\n    book of elephantine gambols in _The Opinions of Theophrastus\r\n    Such_. More and more she \"agonized\" over these works, and though\r\n    each of them contained some scene or passage of rare power, it was\r\n    evident even to her admirers that the pleasing novelist of the\r\n    earlier days had been sacrificed to the moral philosopher.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SHE RENEWS HER YOUTH]\r\n\r\n    The death of Lewes (1878) made an end, as she believed, of all\r\n    earthly happiness. For twenty-four years he had been husband,\r\n    friend and literary adviser, encouraging her talent, shielding her\r\n    from every hostile criticism. Left suddenly alone in the world, she\r\n    felt like an abandoned child; her writing stopped, and her letters\r\n    echoed the old gleeman's song, \"All is gone, both life and light.\"\r\n    Then she surprised everybody by marrying an American banker, many\r\n    years her junior, who had been an intimate friend of the Lewes\r\n    household. Once more she found the world \"intensely interesting,\"\r\n    for at sixty she was the same clinging vine, the same\r\n    hero-worshiper, as at sixteen. The marriage occurred in 1880, and\r\n    her death the same year. An elaborate biography, interesting but\r\n    too fulsome, was written by her husband, John Walter Cross.\r\n\r\nWORKS. George Eliot's first works in fiction were the magazine stories\r\nwhich she published later as _Scenes of Clerical Life_ (1858). These\r\nwere produced comparatively late in life, and they indicate both\r\noriginality and maturity, as if the author had a message of her own, and\r\nhad pondered it well before writing it. That message, as reflected in \"Amos\r\nBarton\" and \"Janet's Repentance,\" may be summarized in four cardinal\r\nprinciples: that duty is the supreme law of life; that the humblest life is\r\nas interesting as the most exalted, since both are subject to the same law;\r\nthat our daily choices have deep moral significance, since they all react\r\non character and their total result is either happiness or misery; and that\r\nthere is no possible escape from the reward or punishment that is due to\r\none's individual action.\r\n\r\nSuch is the message of the author's first work. In its stern insistence on\r\nthe moral quality of life and of every human action, it distinguishes\r\nGeorge Eliot from all other fiction writers of the period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER BEST NOVELS]\r\n\r\nIn her first three novels she repeats the same message with more detail,\r\nand with a gleam of humor here and there to light up the gloomy places.\r\n_Adam Bede_ (1859) has been called a story of early Methodism, but in\r\nreality it is a story of moral principles which work their inevitable ends\r\namong simple country people. The same may be said of _The Mill on the\r\nFloss_ (1860) and of _Silas Marner_ (1861). The former is as\r\ninteresting to readers of George Eliot as _Copperfield_ is to readers\r\nof Dickens, because much of it is a reflection of a personal experience;\r\nbut the latter work, having more unity, more story interest and more\r\ncheerfulness, is a better novel with which to begin our acquaintance with\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRIFF HOUSE, GEORGE ELIOT'S EARLY HOME IN WARWICKSHIRE]\r\n\r\nThe scene of all these novels is laid in the country; the characters are\r\ntrue to life, and move naturally in an almost perfect setting. One secret\r\nof their success is that they deal with people whom the author knew well,\r\nand with scenes in which she was as much at home as Dickens was in the\r\nLondon streets. Each of the novels, notwithstanding its faulty or\r\nmelancholy conclusion, leaves an impression so powerful that we gladly, and\r\nperhaps uncritically, place it among the great literary works of the\r\nVictorian era.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATER WORKS]\r\n\r\nOf the later novels one cannot speak so confidently. They move some critics\r\nto enthusiasm, and put others to sleep. Thus, _Daniel Deronda_ has\r\nsome excellent passages, and Gwendolen is perhaps the best-drawn of all\r\nGeorge Eliot's characters; but for many readers the novel is spoiled by\r\nscientific jargon, by essay writing on the Jews and other matters of which\r\nthe author knew little or nothing at first hand. In _Middlemarch_ she\r\nreturned to the scenes with which she was familiar and produced a novel\r\nwhich some critics rank very high, while others point to its superfluous\r\nessays and its proneness to moralizing instead of telling a story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROMOLA]\r\n\r\n_Romola_ is another labored novel, a study of Italy during the\r\nRenaissance, and a profound ethical lesson. If you can read this work\r\nwithout criticizing its Italian views, you may find in the characters of\r\nTito and Romola, one selfish and the other generous, the best example of\r\nGeorge Eliot's moral method, which is to show the cumulative effect on\r\ncharacter of everyday choices or actions. You will find also a good story,\r\none of the best that the author told. But if you read _Romola_ as an\r\nhistorical novel, with some knowledge of Italy and the Renaissance, you may\r\ndecide that George Eliot--though she slaved at this novel until, as she\r\nsaid, it made an old woman of her--did not understand the people or the\r\ncountry which she tried to describe. She portrayed life not as she had seen\r\nand known and loved it, but as she found it reflected at second hand in the\r\nworks of other writers.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF GEORGE ELIOT. Of the moral quality of George Eliot we have\r\nalready said enough. To our summary of her method this should be added,\r\nthat she tried to make each of her characters not individual but typical.\r\nIn other words, if Tito came finally to grief, and Adam arrived at a state\r\nof gloomy satisfaction (there is no real happiness in George Eliot's\r\nworld), it was not because Tito and Adam lived in different times or\r\ncircumstances, but because both were subject to the same eternal laws. Each\r\nmust have gone to his own place whether he lived in wealth or poverty, in\r\nFlorence or England, in the fifteenth or the nineteenth century. The moral\r\nlaw is universal and unchanging; it has no favorites, and makes no\r\nexceptions. It is more like the old Greek conception of Nemesis, or the\r\nAnglo-Saxon conception of Wyrd, or Fate, than anything else you will find\r\nin modern fiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FATE AND SELF-SACRIFICE]\r\n\r\nIn this last respect George Eliot again differs radically from her\r\ncontemporaries. In her gloomy view of life as an unanswerable puzzle she is\r\nlike Thackeray; but where Thackeray offers a cultured resignation, a\r\ngentlemanly making the best of a bad case, George Eliot advocates\r\nself-sacrifice for the good of others. In her portrayal of weak or sinful\r\ncharacters she is quite as compassionate as Dickens, and more thoughtfully\r\ncharitable; for where Dickens sometimes makes light of misery, and relieves\r\nit by the easy expedient of good dinners and all-around comfort for saints\r\nand sinners, George Eliot remembers the broken moral law and the suffering\r\nof the innocent for the guilty. Behind every one of her characters that\r\ndoes wrong follows an avenging fate, waiting the moment to exact the full\r\npenalty; and before every character that does right hovers a vision of\r\nsacrifice and redemption.\r\n\r\nHer real philosophy, therefore, was quite different from that which her\r\nscientific friends formulated for her, and was not modern but ancient as\r\nthe hills. On the one hand, she never quite freed herself from the old\r\npagan conception of Nemesis, or Fate; on the other, her early Methodist\r\ntraining entered deep into her soul and made her mindful of the Cross that\r\nforever towers above humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOTHER VICTORIAN NOVELISTS\r\n\r\nWe have followed literary custom rather than individual judgment in\r\nstudying Dickens, Thackeray and George Eliot as the typical Victorian\r\nnovelists. On Dickens, as the most original genius of the age, most people\r\nare agreed; but the rank of the other two is open to question. There are\r\ncritics besides Swinburne who regard Charlotte Brontë as a greater genius\r\nthan George Eliot; and many uncritical readers find more pleasure or profit\r\nin the Barchester novels of Anthony Trollope than in anything written by\r\nThackeray. It may even be that the three or four leading novels of the age\r\nwere none of them written by the novelists in question; but it is still\r\nessential to know their works if only for these reasons: that they greatly\r\ninfluenced other story-tellers of the period, and that they furnish us a\r\nstandard by which to judge all modern fiction.\r\n\r\nTo treat the many Victorian novelists adequately would in itself require a\r\nvolume. We shall note here only a few leading figures, naming in each case\r\na novel or two which may serve as an invitation to a better acquaintance\r\nwith their authors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOTTE BRONTË]\r\n\r\nThe Brontë sisters, Charlotte and Emily, made a tremendous sensation in\r\nEngland when, from their retirement, they sent out certain works of such\r\npassionate intensity that readers who had long been familiar with novels\r\nwere startled into renewed attention. Reading these works now we recognize\r\nthe genius of the writers, but we recognize also a morbid, unwholesome\r\nquality, which is a reflection not of English life but of the personal and\r\nunhappy temperament of two girls who looked on life first as a gorgeous\r\nromance and then as a gloomy tragedy.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Brontë (1816-1855) was perhaps the more gifted of the two\r\nsisters, and her best-known works are _Jane Eyre_ and _Villette_.\r\nThe date of the latter novel (1853) was made noteworthy by the masterpiece\r\nof another woman novelist, Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865), who was the\r\nexact opposite of the Brontë sisters,--serene, well-balanced, and with a\r\nfund of delicious humor. All these qualities and more appeared in\r\n_Cranford_ (1853), a series of sketches of country life (first\r\ncontributed to Dickens's _Household Words_) which together form one of\r\nthe most charming stories produced during the Victorian era. The same\r\nauthor wrote a few other novels and an admirable _Life of Charlotte\r\nBrontë_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARLES READE]\r\n\r\nCharles Reade (1814-1884) was a follower of Dickens in his earlier novels,\r\nsuch as _Peg Woffington_; but he made one notable departure when he\r\nwrote _The Cloister and the Hearth_ (1861). This is a story of student\r\nlife and vagabond life in Europe, in the stirring times that followed the\r\ninvention of printing. The action moves rapidly; many different characters\r\nappear; the scene shifts from Holland across Europe to Italy, and back\r\nagain; adventures of a startling kind meet the hero at every stage of his\r\nfoot journey. It is a stirring tale, remarkably well told; so much will\r\nevery uncritical reader gladly acknowledge. Moreover, there are critics\r\nwho, after studying _The Cloister and the Hearth_, rank it with the\r\nbest historical novels in all literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. ELIZABETH GASKELL\r\nFrom the portrait by George Richmond, R.A.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TROLLOPE]\r\n\r\nAnthony Trollope (1815-1882) began as a follower of Thackeray, but in the\r\nimmense range of his characters and incidents he soon outstripped his\r\nmaster. Perhaps his best work is _Barchester Towers_ (1857), one of a\r\nseries of novels which picture with marvelous fidelity the life of a\r\ncathedral town in England.\r\n\r\nAnother novelist who followed Thackeray, and then changed his allegiance to\r\nDickens, was Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873). He was essentially an imitator, a\r\nfollower of the market, and before Thackeray and Dickens were famous he had\r\nfollowed almost every important English novelist from Mrs. Radcliffe to\r\nWalter Scott. Two of his historical novels, _Rienzi_ and _The Last\r\nDays of Pompeii_, may be mildly recommended. The rest are of the popular\r\nand somewhat trashy kind; critics jeer at them, and the public buys them in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming books of the Victorian age was produced by Richard\r\nBlackmore (1825-1900). He wrote several novels, some of them of excellent\r\nquality, but they were all overshadowed by his beautiful old romance of\r\n_Lorna Doone_ (1869). It is hard to overpraise such a story, wholesome\r\nand sweet as a breath from the moors, and the critic's praise will be\r\nunnecessary if the reader only opens the book. It should be read, with\r\n_Cranford_, if one reads nothing else of Victorian fiction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD DODDRIDGE BLACKMORE]\r\n\r\nTwo other notable romances of a vanished age came from the hand of Charles\r\nKingsley (1819-1875). He produced many works in poetry and prose, but his\r\nfame now rests upon _Hypatia_, _Westward Ho!_ and a few stories\r\nfor children. _Hypatia_ (1853) is an interesting novel dealing with\r\nthe conflict of pagan and Christian ideals in the early centuries.\r\n_Westward Ho!_ (1855) is a stirring narrative of seafaring and\r\nadventure in the days of Elizabeth. It has been described as a \"stunning\"\r\nboys' book, and it would prove an absorbing story for any reader who likes\r\nadventure were it not marred by one serious fault. The author's personal\r\nbeliefs and his desire to glorify certain Elizabethan adventurers lead him\r\nto pronounce judgment of a somewhat wholesale kind. He treats one religious\r\nparty of the period to a golden halo, and the other to a lash of scorpions;\r\nand this is apt to alienate many readers who else would gladly follow Sir\r\nAmyas Leigh on his gallant ventures in the New World or on the Spanish\r\nMain. Kingsley had a rare talent for writing for children (his heart never\r\ngrew old), and his _Heroes_ and _Water Babies_ are still widely\r\nread as bedtime stories.\r\n\r\nOf the later Victorian novelists, chief among them being Meredith, Hardy\r\nand Stevenson, little may be said here, as they are much too near us to\r\njudge of their true place in the long perspective of English literature.\r\nMeredith, with the analytical temper and the disconnected style of\r\nBrowning, is for mature readers, not for young people. Hardy has decided\r\npower, but is too hopelessly pessimistic for anybody's comfort,--except in\r\nhis earlier works, which have a romantic charm that brightens the obscurity\r\nof his later philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON\r\nFrom a photograph]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STEVENSON]\r\n\r\nIn Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) we have the spirit of romance\r\npersonified. His novels, such as _Kidnapped_ and _David Balfour_,\r\nare stories of adventure written in a very attractive style; but he is more\r\nwidely known, among young people at least, by his charming _Child's\r\nGarden of Verses_ and his _Treasure Island_ (1883). This last is a\r\nkind of dime-novel of pirates and buried treasure. If one is to read\r\nstories of that kind, there is no better place to begin than with this\r\nmasterpiece of Stevenson. Other works by the same versatile author are the\r\nnovels, _Master of Ballantrae_, _Weir of Hermiston_ and _Dr.\r\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde_; various collections of essays, such as\r\n_Virginibus Puerisque_ and _Familiar Studies of Men and Books_;\r\nand some rather thin sketches of journeying called _An Inland Voyage_\r\nand _Travels with a Donkey_.\r\n\r\nThe cheery spirit of Stevenson, who bravely fought a losing battle with\r\ndisease, is evident in everything he wrote; and it was the author's spirit,\r\nquite as much as his romantic tales or fine prose style, that won for him a\r\nlarge and enthusiastic following. Of all the later Victorians he seems, at\r\nthe present time, to have the widest circle of cultivated readers and to\r\nexercise the strongest influence on our writers of fiction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII. VICTORIAN ESSAYISTS AND HISTORIANS\r\n\r\nThere is rich reading in Victorian essays, which reflect not only the\r\npractical affairs of the age but also the ideals that inspire every great\r\nmovement whether in history or literature. For example, the intense\r\nreligious interests of the period, the growth of the Nonconformists or\r\nIndependents, the Oxford movement, which aimed to define the historic\r\nposition of the English Church, the chill of doubt and the glow of renewed\r\nfaith in face of the apparent conflict between the old religion and the new\r\nscience,--all these were brilliantly reflected by excellent writers, among\r\nwhom Martineau, Newman and Maurice stand out prominently. The deep thought,\r\nthe serene spirit and the fine style of these men are unsurpassed in\r\nVictorian prose.\r\n\r\nSomewhat apart from their age stood a remarkable group of\r\nhistorians--Hallam, Freeman, Green, Gardiner, Symonds and others no less\r\npraiseworthy--who changed the whole conception of history from a record of\r\npolitical or military events to a profound study of human society in all\r\nits activities. In another typical group were the critics, Pater, Bagehot,\r\nHutton, Leslie Stephen, who have given deeper meaning and enlarged pleasure\r\nto the study of literature. In a fourth group were the scientists--Darwin,\r\nWallace, Lyell, Mivart, Tyndall, Mill, Spencer, Huxley, and their\r\nfollowers--some of whom aimed not simply to increase our knowledge but to\r\nuse the essay, as others used the novel, to portray some new scene in the\r\nold comedy of human life. Darwin was a great and, therefore, a modest man;\r\nbut some of his disciples were sadly lacking in humor. Spencer and Mill\r\nespecially wrote with colossal self-confidence, as if the world no longer\r\nwore its veil of mystery. They remind us, curiously, that while poetry\r\nendures forever, nothing on earth is more subject to change and error than\r\nso-called scientific truth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL WRITERS]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in a small volume to do justice to so many writers,\r\nreflecting nature or humanity from various angles, and sometimes insisting\r\nthat a particular angle was the only one from which a true view could be\r\nobtained. Some rigorous selection is necessary; and we name here for\r\nspecial study Macaulay, Carlyle, Ruskin, who are commonly regarded as the\r\ntypical Victorian essayists. This selection does not mean, however, that\r\nsome other group might not be quite as representative of their age and\r\nnation. Our chosen authors stand not for Victorian thought but only for\r\ncertain interesting phases thereof. Macaulay, the busy man of affairs,\r\nvoiced the pride of his generation in British traditions. Carlyle lived\r\naloof, grumbling at democracy, denouncing its shams, calling it to\r\nrepentance. Ruskin, a child of fortune, was absorbed in art till the burden\r\nof the world oppressed him; whereupon he gave his money to the cause of\r\nsocial reform and went himself among the poor to share with them whatever\r\nwealth of spirit he possessed. These three men, utterly unlike in\r\ncharacter, were as one in their endeavor to make modern literature a power\r\nwherewith to uplift humanity. They illustrate, better even than poets or\r\nnovelists, the characteristic moral earnestness of the Victorian era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY (1800-1859)\r\n\r\nTo many readers the life of Macaulay is more interesting than any of his\r\nbooks. For the details of that brilliantly successful life, which fairly\r\nwon and richly deserved its success, the student is referred to Trevelyan's\r\nfine biography. We record here only such personal matters as may help to\r\nexplain the exuberant spirit of Macaulay's literary work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. One notes first of all the man's inheritance. The Norse\r\n    element predominated in him, for the name Macaulay (son of Aulay)\r\n    is a late form of the Scandinavian _Olafson_. His mother was a\r\n    brilliant woman of Quaker descent; his father, at one time governor\r\n    of the Sierra Leone Colony in Africa, was a business man who gained\r\n    a fortune in trade, and who spent the whole of it in helping to\r\n    free the slaves. In consequence, when Macaulay left college he\r\n    faced the immediate problem of supporting himself and his family, a\r\n    hard matter, which he handled not only with his customary success\r\n    but also with characteristic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    Next we note Macaulay's personal endowment, his gift of rapid\r\n    reading, his marvelous memory which suggests Coleridge and Cotton\r\n    Mather. He read everything from Plato to the trashiest novel, and\r\n    after reading a book could recall practically the whole of it after\r\n    a lapse of twenty years. To this photographic memory we are\r\n    indebted for the wealth of quotation, allusion and anecdote which\r\n    brightens almost every page of his writings.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS BRILLIANT CAREER]\r\n\r\n    After a brilliant career at college Macaulay began the study of\r\n    law. At twenty-five he jumped into prominence by a magazine essay\r\n    on Milton, and after that his progress was uninterrupted. He was\r\n    repeatedly elected to Parliament; he was appointed legal adviser to\r\n    the Supreme Council of India, in which position he acquired the\r\n    knowledge that appears in his essays on Clive and Hastings; he\r\n    became Secretary for War, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron\r\n    Macaulay of Rothley. It was said of him at that time that he was\r\n    \"the only man whom England ever made a lord for the power of his\r\n    pen.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS RECREATION]\r\n\r\n    The last thing we note, because it was to Macaulay of least moment,\r\n    is his literary work. With the exception of the _History of\r\n    England_ his writing was done at spare moments, as a relaxation\r\n    from what he considered more important labors. In this respect, of\r\n    writing for pleasure in the midst of practical affairs, he\r\n    resembles the Elizabethan rather than the Victorian authors.\r\n\r\n    While at work on his masterpiece Macaulay suddenly faltered, worn\r\n    out by too much work. He died on Christmas Day (1859) and was\r\n    buried in the place which he liked best to visit, the Poets' Corner\r\n    of Westminster Abbey. From the day on which he attracted notice by\r\n    his Milton essay he had never once lost his hold on the attention\r\n    of England. Gladstone summed up the matter in oratorical fashion\r\n    when he said, \"Full-orbed Macaulay was seen above the horizon; and\r\n    full-orbed, after thirty-five years of constantly emitted splendor,\r\n    he sank below it.\" But Macaulay's final comment, \"Well, I have had\r\n    a happy life,\" is more suggestive of the man and his work.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF MACAULAY. Macaulay's poems, which he regarded as of no\r\nconsequence, are practically all in the ballad style. Among them are\r\nvarious narratives from French or English history, such as \"The Battle of\r\nIvry\" and \"The Armada,\" and a few others which made a popular little book\r\nwhen they were published as _Lays of Ancient Rome_ (1842). The prime\r\nfavorite not only of the _Lays_ but of all Macaulay's works is\r\n\"Horatius Cocles,\" or \"Horatius at the Bridge.\" Those who read its stirring\r\nlines should know that Macaulay intended it not as a modern ballad but as\r\nan example of ancient methods of teaching history. According to Niebuhr the\r\nearly history of Rome was written in the form of popular ballads; and\r\nMacaulay attempted to reproduce a few of these historical documents in the\r\nheroic style that roused a Roman audience of long ago to pride and love of\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ESSAYS]\r\n\r\nThe essays of Macaulay appeared in the magazines of that day; but though\r\nofficial England acclaimed their brilliancy and flooded their author with\r\ninvitations to dine, nobody seemed to think of them as food for ordinary\r\nreaders till a Philadelphia publisher collected a few of them into a book,\r\nwhich sold in America like a good novel. That was in 1841, and not till two\r\nyears had passed did a London publisher gain courage to issue the\r\n_Critical and Historical Essays_, a book which vindicated the taste of\r\nreaders of that day by becoming immensely popular.\r\n\r\nThe charm of such a book is evident in the very first essay, on Milton.\r\nHere is no critic, airing his rules or making his dry talk palatable by a\r\nfew quotations; here is a live man pleading for another man whom he\r\nconsiders one of the greatest figures in history. Macaulay may be mistaken,\r\npossibly, but he is going to make you doff your hat to a hero before he is\r\ndone; so he speaks eloquently not only of Milton but of the classics on\r\nwhich Milton fed, of the ideals and struggles of his age, of the\r\nCommonwealth and the Restoration,--of everything which may catch your\r\nattention and then focus it on one Titanic figure battling like Samson\r\namong the Philistines. It may be that your sympathies are with the\r\nPhilistines rather than with Samson; but presently you stop objecting and\r\nare carried along by the author's eloquence as by a torrent. His style is\r\nthe combined style of novelist and public speaker, the one striving to make\r\nhis characters real, the other bound to make his subject interesting.\r\n\r\nThat is Macaulay's way in all his essays. They are seldom wholly right in\r\ntheir judgments; they are so often one-sided that the author declared in\r\nlater life he would burn them all if he could; but they are all splendid,\r\nall worth reading, not simply for their matter but for their style and for\r\nthe wealth of allusion with which Macaulay makes his subject vital and\r\ninteresting. Among the best of the literary essays are those on Bunyan,\r\nAddison, Bacon, Johnson, Goldsmith and Byron; among the historical essays\r\none may sample Macaulay's variety in Lord Clive, Frederick the Great,\r\nMachiavelli and Mirabeau.\r\n\r\nCareful readers may note a difference between these literary and historical\r\nessays. Those on Bunyan, Johnson and Goldsmith, for example (written\r\noriginally for the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_), are more finished and\r\nmore careful of statement than others in which the author talks freely,\r\nsharing without measure or restraint \"the heaped-up treasures of his\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY OF ENGLAND]\r\n\r\nMacaulay began to write his _History of England_ with the declaration\r\nthat he would cover the century and a half following the accession of James\r\nII (1685), and that he would make his story as interesting as any novel.\r\nOnly the latter promise was fulfilled. His five volumes, the labor of more\r\nthan a decade, cover only sixteen years of English history; but these are\r\npictured with such minuteness and such splendor that we can hardly imagine\r\nanyone brave enough to attempt to finish the record in a single lifetime.\r\n\r\nOf this masterpiece of Macaulay we may confidently say three things: that\r\nfor many years it was the most popular historical work in our language;\r\nthat by its brilliant style and absorbing interest it deserved its\r\npopularity, as literature if not as history; and that, though it contains\r\nits share of error and more than its share of Whig partisanship, it has\r\nprobably as few serious faults as any other history which attempts to cover\r\nthe immense field of the political, social and intellectual life of a\r\nnation. Read, for example, one of the introductory chapters (the third is\r\nexcellent) which draws such a picture of England in the days of the Stuarts\r\nas no other historian has ever attempted. When you have finished that\r\nchapter, with its wealth of picturesque detail, you may be content to read\r\nMacaulay simply for the pleasure he gives you, and go to some other\r\nhistorian for accurate information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881)\r\n\r\nThere is little harmony of opinion concerning Carlyle, criticism of the man\r\nbeing divided between praise and disparagement. If you are to read only one\r\nof his works, it is perhaps advisable to avoid all biographies at first and\r\nto let the _Essay on Burns_ or _Heroes and Hero Worship_ make its\r\nown impression. But if you intend to read more widely, some knowledge of\r\nCarlyle's personal history is essential in order to furnish the grain of\r\nsalt with which most of his opinions must be taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS CARLYLE\r\nFrom engraving by Sartain from a daguerrotype]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. In the village of Ecclefechan Carlyle was born in 1795, the\r\n    year before Burns's death. His father was a stone-mason, an honest\r\n    man of caustic tongue; his mother, judged by her son's account, was\r\n    one of nature's noblewomen. The love of his mother and a proud\r\n    respect for his father were the two sentiments in Carlyle that went\r\n    with him unchanged through a troubled and oft-complaining life.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS WRESTLINGS]\r\n\r\n    Of his tearful school days in Annandale and of his wretched years\r\n    at Edinburgh University we have glimpses in _Sartor Resartus_.\r\n    In the chapters of the same book entitled \"The Everlasting Nay\" and\r\n    \"The Everlasting Yea\" is a picture of the conflict between doubt\r\n    and faith in the stormy years when Carlyle was finding himself. He\r\n    taught school, and hated it; he abandoned the ministry, for which\r\n    his parents had intended him; he resolved on a literary life, and\r\n    did hack work to earn his bread. All the while he wrestled with his\r\n    gloomy temper or with the petty demons of dyspepsia, which he was\r\n    wont to magnify into giant doubts and despairs.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: CARLYLE AND EMERSON]\r\n\r\n    In 1826 he married Jane Welsh, and went to live in a house she had\r\n    inherited at Craigenputtock, or Hill of the Hawks. There on a\r\n    lonely moorland farm he spent six or seven years, writing books\r\n    which few cared to read; and there Emerson appeared one day (\"He\r\n    came and went like an angel,\" said the Carlyles) with the\r\n    heartening news that the neglected writings were winning a great\r\n    audience in America. The letters of Carlyle and Emerson, as edited\r\n    by Charles Eliot Norton, are among the pleasantest results of\r\n    Carlyle's whole career.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: MRS. CARLYLE]\r\n\r\n    Carlyle's wife was a brilliant but nervous woman with literary\r\n    gifts of her own. She had always received attention; she expected\r\n    and probably deserved admiration; but so did Carlyle, who expected\r\n    also to be made the center of all solicitude when he called heaven\r\n    and earth to witness against democracy, crowing roosters, weak tea\r\n    and other grievous afflictions. After her death (in London, 1866)\r\n    he was plunged into deepest grief. In his _Reminiscences_ and\r\n    _Letters_ he fairly deifies his wife, calling her his queen,\r\n    his star, his light and joy of life, and portrays a companionship\r\n    as of two mortals in a Paradise without a serpent. All that is\r\n    doubtless as it should be, in a romance; but the unfortunate\r\n    publication of Mrs. Carlyle's letters and journals introduced a\r\n    jarring note of reality. A jungle of controversial writings has\r\n    since grown up around the domestic relations of the\r\n    Carlyles,--impertinent, deplorable writings, which serve no purpose\r\n    but to make us cry, \"Enough, let them rest in peace!\" Both had\r\n    sharp tongues, and probably both were often sorry.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WORK IN LONDON]\r\n\r\n    From the moors the Carlyles went to London and settled for the\r\n    remainder of their lives in a house in Cheyne Row, in the suburb of\r\n    Chelsea. There Carlyle slowly won recognition, his success being\r\n    founded on his _French Revolution_. Invitations began to pour\r\n    in upon him; great men visited and praised him, and his fame spread\r\n    as \"the sage of Chelsea.\" Then followed his _Cromwell_ and\r\n    _Frederick the Great_, the latter completed after years of\r\n    complaining labor which made wreck of home happiness. And then came\r\n    a period of unusual irritation, to which we owe, in part at least,\r\n    Carlyle's railings against progress and his deplorable criticism of\r\n    England's great men and women,--poor little Browning, animalcular\r\n    De Quincey, rabbit-brained Newman, sawdustish Mill, chattering\r\n    George Eliot, ghastly-shrieky Shelley, once-enough Lamb,\r\n    stinted-scanty Wordsworth, poor thin fool Darwin and his book\r\n    (_The Origin of Species_, of which Carlyle confessed he never\r\n    read a page) which was wonderful as an example of the stupidity of\r\n    mankind.\r\n\r\n    Such criticisms were reserved for Carlyle's private memoirs. The\r\n    world knew him only by his books, and revered him as a great and\r\n    good man. He died in 1881, and of the thousand notices which\r\n    appeared in English or American periodicals of that year there is\r\n    hardly one that does not overflow with praise.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CARLYLE'S HOUSE, CHEYNE ROW, CHELSEA, LONDON]\r\n\r\n    In the home at Chelsea were numerous letters and journals which\r\n    Carlyle committed to his friend Froude the historian. The\r\n    publication of these private papers raised a storm of protest.\r\n    Admirers of Carlyle, shocked at the revelation of another side to\r\n    their hero, denounced Froude for his disloyalty and malice;\r\n    whereupon the literary world divided into two camps, the Jane\r\n    Carlyleists and the Thomas Carlyleists, as they are still called.\r\n    That Froude showed poor taste is evident; but we must acquit him of\r\n    all malice. Private papers had been given him with the charge to\r\n    publish them if he saw fit; and from them he attempted to draw not\r\n    a flattering but a truthful portrait of Carlyle, who had always\r\n    preached the doctrine that a man must speak truth as he sees it.\r\n    Nor will Carlyle suffer in the long run from being deprived of a\r\n    halo which he never deserved. Already the crustiness of the man\r\n    begins to grow dim in the distance; it is his rugged earnestness\r\n    that will be longest remembered.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF CARLYLE. The beginner will do well to make acquaintance with\r\nCarlyle in some of the minor essays, which are less original but more\r\npleasing than his labored works. Among the best essays are those on Goethe\r\n(who was Carlyle's first master), Signs of the Times, Novalis, and\r\nespecially Scott and Burns. With Scott he was not in sympathy, and though\r\nhe tried as a Scotsman to be \"loyal to kith and clan,\" a strong touch of\r\nprejudice mars his work. With Burns he succeeded better, and his picture of\r\nthe plowboy genius in misfortune is one of the best we have on the subject.\r\nThis _Essay on Burns_ is also notable as the best example of Carlyle's\r\nearly style, before he compounded the strange mixture which appeared in his\r\nlater books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEROES AND HERO WORSHIP]\r\n\r\nThe most readable of Carlyle's longer works is _Heroes and Hero\r\nWorship_ (1840), which deals with certain leaders in the fields of\r\nreligion, poetry, war and politics. It is an interesting study to compare\r\nthis work with the _Representative Men_ of Emerson. The latter looks\r\nupon the world as governed by ideals, which belong not to individuals but\r\nto humanity. When some man appears in whom the common ideal is written\r\nlarge, other men follow him because they see in him a truth which they\r\nrevere in their own souls. So the leader is always in the highest sense a\r\nrepresentative of his race. But Carlyle will have nothing of such\r\ndemocracy; to him common men are stupid or helpless and must be governed\r\nfrom without. Occasionally, when humanity is in the Slough of Despond,\r\nappears a hero, a superman, and proceeds by his own force to drag or drive\r\nhis subjects to a higher level. When the hero dies, humanity must halt and\r\npray heaven to send another master.\r\n\r\nIt is evident before one has read much of _Heroes_ that Carlyle is at\r\nheart a force-worshiper. To him history means the biography of a few\r\nheroes, and heroism is a matter of power, not of physical or moral courage.\r\nThe hero may have the rugged courage of a Cromwell, or he may be an\r\neasy-living poet like Shakespeare, or a ruthless despot like Napoleon, or\r\nan epitome of all meanness like Rousseau; but if he shows superior force of\r\nany kind, that is the hallmark of his heroism, and before such an one\r\nhumanity should bow down. Of real history, therefore, you will learn\r\nnothing from _Heroes_; neither will you get any trustworthy\r\ninformation concerning Odin, Mahomet and the rest of Carlyle's oddly\r\nconsorted characters. One does not read the book for facts but for a new\r\nview of old matters. With hero-worshipers especially it ranks very high\r\namong the thought-provoking books of the past century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FRENCH REVOLUTION]\r\n\r\nOf the historical works [Footnote: These include _Oliver Cromwell's\r\nLetters and Speeches_ (1850) and _History of Frederick the Great_\r\n(1858).] of Carlyle the most famous is _The French Revolution_ (1837).\r\nOn this work Carlyle spent much heart-breaking labor, and the story of the\r\nfirst volume shows that the author, who made himself miserable over petty\r\nmatters, could be patient in face of a real misfortune. [Footnote: The\r\nmanuscript of the first volume was submitted to Carlyle's friend Mill (him\r\nof the \"sawdustish\" mind) for criticism. Mill lent it to a lady, who lost\r\nit. When he appeared \"white as a ghost\" to confess his carelessness, the\r\nCarlyles did their best to make light of it. Yet it was a terrible blow to\r\nthem; for aside from the wearisome labor of doing the work over again, they\r\nwere counting on the sale of the book to pay for their daily bread.]\r\nMoreover, it furnishes a striking example of Carlyle's method, which was\r\nnot historical in the modern sense, but essentially pictorial or dramatic.\r\nHe selected a few dramatic scenes, such as the storming of the Bastille,\r\nand painted them in flaming colors. Also he was strong in drawing\r\nportraits, and his portrayal of Robespierre, Danton and other actors in the\r\nterrible drama is astonishingly vigorous, though seldom accurate. His chief\r\npurpose in drawing all these pictures and portraits was to prove that order\r\ncan never come out of chaos save by the iron grip of a governing hand.\r\nHence, if you want to learn the real history of the French Revolution, you\r\nmust seek elsewhere; but if you want an impression of it, an impression\r\nthat burns its way into the mind, you will hardly find the equal of\r\nCarlyle's book in any language.\r\n\r\nOf Carlyle's miscellaneous works one must speak with some hesitation. As an\r\nexpression of what some call his prophetic mood, and others his ranting,\r\none who has patience might try _Shooting Niagara_ or the _Latter Day\r\nPamphlets_. A reflection of his doctrine of honest work as the cure for\r\nsocial ills is found in _Past and Present_; and for a summary of his\r\nphilosophy there is nothing quite so good as his early _Sartor\r\nResartus_ (1834).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SARTOR RESARTUS]\r\n\r\nThe last-named work is called philosophy only by courtesy. The title means\r\n\"the tailor retailored,\" or \"the patcher repatched,\" and the book professed\r\nto be \"a complete Resartus philosophy of clothes.\" Since everything wears\r\nclothes of some kind (the soul wears a body, and the body garments; earth\r\nputs forth grass, and the firmament stars; ideas clothe themselves in\r\nwords; society puts on fashions and habits), it can be seen that Carlyle\r\nfelt free to bring in any subject he pleased; and so he did. Moreover, in\r\norder to have liberty of style, he represented himself to be the editor not\r\nthe author of _Sartor_. The alleged author was a German professor,\r\nDiogenes Teufelsdroeckh, an odd stick, half genius, half madman, whose\r\nchaotic notes Carlyle professed to arrange with a running commentary of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this overlabored plan _Sartor_ has no plan at all.\r\nIt is a jumble of thoughts, notions, attacks on shams, scraps of German\r\nphilosophy,--everything that Carlyle wrote about during his seven-years\r\nsojourn on his moorland farm. The only valuable things in _Sartor_ are\r\na few autobiographical chapters, such as \"The Everlasting Yea,\" and certain\r\npassages dealing with night, the stars, the yearnings of humanity, the\r\nsplendors of earth and heaven. Note this picture of Teufelsdroeckh standing\r\nalone at the North Cape, \"looking like a little belfry\":\r\n\r\n    \"Silence as of death, for Midnight, even in the Arctic latitudes,\r\n    has its character: nothing but the granite cliffs ruddy-tinged, the\r\n    peaceable gurgle of that slow-heaving Polar Ocean, over which in\r\n    the utmost North the great Sun hangs low and lazy, as if he too\r\n    were slumbering. Yet is his cloud-couch wrought of crimson and\r\n    cloth-of-gold; yet does his light stream over the mirror of waters,\r\n    like a tremulous fire-pillar shooting downwards to the abyss, and\r\n    hide itself under my feet. In such moments Solitude also is\r\n    invaluable; for who would speak, or be looked on, when behind him\r\n    lies all Europe and Africa, fast asleep, except the watchmen; and\r\n    before him the silent Immensity and Palace of the Eternal, whereof\r\n    our Sun is but a porch-lamp?\"\r\n\r\nThe book has several such passages, written in a psalmodic style, appealing\r\nto elemental feeling, to our sense of wonder or reverence before the\r\nmystery of life and death. It is a pity that we have no edition of\r\n_Sartor_ which does justice to its golden nuggets by the simple\r\nexpedient of sifting out the mass of rubbish in which the gold is hidden.\r\nThe central doctrines of the book are the suppression of self, or\r\nselfishness, and the value of honest work in contrast with the evil of\r\nmammon-worship.\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF CARLYLE. Except in his literary essays Carlyle's\r\n\"rumfustianish growlery of style,\" as he called it, is so uneven that no\r\ndescription will apply to it. In moments of emotion he uses a chanting\r\nprose that is like primitive poetry. Sometimes he forgets Thomas Carlyle,\r\nkeeps his eye on his subject, and describes it in vivid, picturesque words;\r\nthen, when he has nothing to say, he thinks of himself and tries to hold\r\nyou by his manner, by his ranting or dogmatism. In one mood he is a poet,\r\nin another a painter, in a third a stump speaker. In all moods he must have\r\nyour ear, but he succeeds better in getting than in holding it. It has been\r\nsaid that his prose is on a level with Browning's verse, but a better\r\ncomparison may be drawn between Carlyle and Walt Whitman. Of each of these\r\nwriters the best that can be said is that his style was his own, that it\r\nserved his purpose, and that it is not to be imitated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS TWO SIDES]\r\n\r\nIn formulating any summary of Carlyle the critic must remember that he is\r\ndealing with a man of two sides, one prejudiced, dogmatic, jealous of\r\nrivals, the other roughly sincere. On either side Carlyle is a man of\r\ncontradictions. For an odious dead despot like Frederick, who happens to\r\nplease him, he turns criticism into eulogy; and for a living poet like\r\nWordsworth he tempers praise by spiteful criticism. [Footnote: Carlyle's\r\npraise of Wordsworth's \"fine, wholesome rusticity\" is often quoted, but\r\nonly in part. If you read the whole passage (in _Reminiscences_) you\r\nwill find the effect of Carlyle's praise wholly spoiled by a heartless\r\ndissection of a poet, with whom, as Carlyle confessed, he had very slight\r\nacquaintance.] He writes a score of letters to show that his grief is too\r\ndeep for words. He is voluble on \"the infinite virtue of silence.\" He\r\nproclaims to-day that he \"will write no word on any subject till he has\r\nstudied it to the bottom,\" and to-morrow will pronounce judgment on America\r\nor science or some other matter of which he knows nothing. In all this\r\nCarlyle sees no inconsistency; he is sincere in either role, of prophet or\r\nstump speaker, and even thinks that humor is one of his prime qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCH HOME, ECCLEFECHAN\r\nThe birthplace of Carlyle]\r\n\r\nAnother matter to remember is Carlyle's constant motive rather than his\r\nconstant mistakes. He had the gloomy conviction that he was ordained to cry\r\nout against the shams of society; and as most modern things appeared to him\r\nas shams, he had to be very busy. Moreover, he had an eye like a hawk for\r\nthe small failings of men, especially of living men, but was almost blind\r\nto their large virtues. This hawklike vision, which ignores all large\r\nmatters in a swoop on some petty object, accounts for two things: for the\r\nmarvelous detail of Carlyle's portraits, and for his merciless criticism of\r\nthe faults of society in general, and of the Victorian age in particular.\r\n\r\nSuch a writer invites both applause and opposition, and in Carlyle's case\r\nthe one is as hearty as the other. The only point on which critics are\r\nfairly well agreed is that his rugged independence of mind and his\r\npicturesque style appealed powerfully to a small circle of readers in\r\nEngland and to a large circle in America. It is doubtful whether any other\r\nessayist, with the possible exception of the serene and hopeful Emerson,\r\nhad a more stimulating influence on the thought of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN RUSKIN (1819-1900)\r\n\r\nThe prose of Ruskin is a treasure house. Nature portrayed as everyman's\r\nHoly Land; descriptions of mountain or landscape, and more beautiful\r\ndescriptions of leaf or lichen or the glint of light on a breaking wave;\r\nappreciations of literature, and finer appreciations of life itself;\r\nstartling views of art, and more revolutionary views of that frightful\r\nwaste of human life and labor which we call political economy,--all these\r\nand many more impressions of nature, art and human society are eloquently\r\nrecorded in the ten thousand pages which are the work of Ruskin's hand.\r\n\r\nIf you would know the secret that binds all his work together, it may be\r\nexpressed in two words, sensitiveness and sincerity. From childhood Ruskin\r\nwas extremely sensitive to both beauty and ugliness. The beauty of the\r\nworld and of all noble things that ever were accomplished in the world\r\naffected him like music; but he shrank, as if from a blow, from all\r\nsordidness and evil, from the mammon-worship of trade, from the cloud of\r\nsmoke that hung over a factory district as if trying to shield from the eye\r\nof heaven so much needless poverty and aimless toil below. So Ruskin was a\r\nman halting between two opinions: the artist in him was forever troubled by\r\nthe reformer seeking to make the crooked places of life straight and its\r\nrough places plain. He made as many mistakes as another man; in his pages\r\nyou may light upon error or vagary; but you will find nothing to make you\r\ndoubt his entire sincerity, his desire to speak truth, his passion for\r\nhelping his fellow men.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The early training of Ruskin may explain both the strength\r\n    and the weakness of his work. His father was a wealthy wine\r\n    merchant, his mother a devout woman with puritanic ideas of duty.\r\n    Both parents were of Scottish and, as Ruskin boasted, of plebeian\r\n    descent. They had but one child, and in training him they used a\r\n    strange mixture of severity and coddling, of wisdom and nonsense.\r\n\r\n    The young Ruskin was kept apart from other boys and from the sports\r\n    which breed a modesty of one's own opinion; his time, work and\r\n    lonely play were minutely regulated; the slightest infringement of\r\n    rules brought the stern discipline of rod or reproof. On the other\r\n    hand he was given the best pictures and the best books; he was\r\n    taken on luxurious journeys through England and the Continent; he\r\n    was furnished with tutors for any study to which he turned his\r\n    mind. When he went up to Oxford, at seventeen, he knew many things\r\n    which are Greek to the ordinary boy, but was ignorant of almost\r\n    everything that a boy knows, and that a man finds useful in dealing\r\n    with the world.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN RUSKIN\r\n    From a photograph by Elliott and Fry]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TRAINING AND ITS RESULTS]\r\n\r\n    There were several results of this early discipline. One was\r\n    Ruskin's devotion to art, which came from his familiarity with\r\n    pictures and galleries; another was his minute study of natural\r\n    objects, which were to him in place of toys; a third was his habit\r\n    of \"speaking his mind\" on every subject; a fourth was his rhythmic\r\n    prose style, which came largely from his daily habit of memorizing\r\n    the Bible. Still another result of his lonely magnificence, in\r\n    which he was deprived of boys' society, was that his affection went\r\n    out on a flood tide of romance to the first attractive girl he met.\r\n    So he loved, and was laughed at, and was desperately unhappy. Then\r\n    he married, not the woman of his choice, but one whom his parents\r\n    picked out for him. The tastes of the couple were hopelessly\r\n    different; the end was estrangement, with humiliation and sorrow\r\n    for Ruskin.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TWENTY YEARS OF ART]\r\n\r\n    At twenty-four he produced his first important work, _Modern\r\n    Painters_ (1843), which he began as a defense of the neglected\r\n    artist Turner. This controversial book led Ruskin to a deeper study\r\n    of his subject, which resulted in four more volumes on modern\r\n    painting. Before these were completed he had \"fairly created a new\r\n    literature of art\" by his _Seven Lamps of Architecture_ and\r\n    _Stones of Venice_. He was appointed professor of fine arts at\r\n    Oxford; he gave several series of lectures which appeared later as\r\n    _Lectures on Architecture and Painting_, _Michael Angelo and\r\n    Tintoret_, _Val d'Arno_ and _The Art of England_.\r\n\r\n    By this time he was renowned as an art critic; but his theories\r\n    were strongly opposed and he was continually in hot water. In his\r\n    zeal to defend Turner or Millais or Burne-Jones he was rather\r\n    slashing in his criticism of other artists. The libel suit brought\r\n    against him by Whistler, whom he described as a coxcomb who flung a\r\n    pot of paint in the face of the public, is still talked about in\r\n    England. The jury (fancy a jury wrestling with a question of art!)\r\n    found Ruskin guilty, and decided that he should pay for the\r\n    artist's damaged reputation the sum of one farthing. Whistler ever\r\n    afterwards wore the coin on his watch chain.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: RUSKIN THE REFORMER]\r\n\r\n    It was about the year 1860 that Ruskin came under the influence of\r\n    Carlyle, and then began the effort at social reform which made\r\n    wreck of fame and hope and peace of mind. Carlyle had merely\r\n    preached of manual work; but Ruskin, wholehearted in whatever he\r\n    did, went out to mend roads and do other useful tasks to show his\r\n    belief in the doctrine. Carlyle railed against the industrial\r\n    system of England; but Ruskin devoted his fortune to remedying its\r\n    evils. He established model tenements; he founded libraries and\r\n    centers of recreation for workingmen; he took women and children\r\n    out of factories and set them to spinning or weaving in their own\r\n    homes; he founded St. George's Guild, a well-housed community which\r\n    combined work with education, and which shared profits fairly among\r\n    the workers.\r\n\r\n    England at first rubbed its eyes at these reforms, then shrugged\r\n    its shoulders as at a harmless kind of madman. But Ruskin had the\r\n    temper of a crusader; his sword was out against what was even then\r\n    called \"vested interests,\" and presently his theories aroused a\r\n    tempest of opposition. Thackeray, who as editor of the _Cornhill\r\n    Magazine_ had gladly published Ruskin's first economic essays,\r\n    was forced by the clamor of readers to discontinue the series.\r\n    [Footnote: While these essays were appearing, there was published\r\n    (1864) a textbook of English literature. It spoke well of Ruskin's\r\n    books of art, but added, \"Of late he has lost his way and has\r\n    written things--papers in the _Cornhill_ chiefly--which are\r\n    not likely to add to his fame as a writer or to his character as a\r\n    man of common sense\" (Collier, _History of English\r\n    Literature_, p. 512).] To this reform period belong _Unto This\r\n    Last_ and other books dealing with political economy, and also\r\n    _Sesame and Lilies_, _Crown of Wild Olive_ and _Ethics\r\n    of the Dust_, which were written chiefly for young people.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: END OF THE CRUSADE]\r\n\r\n    For twenty years this crusade continued; then, worn out and\r\n    misunderstood by both capitalists and workingmen, Ruskin retired\r\n    (1879) to a small estate called \"Brantwood\" in the Lake District,\r\n    His fortune had been spent in his attempt to improve labor\r\n    conditions, and he lived now upon the modest income from his books.\r\n    Before he died, in 1900, his friend Charles Eliot Norton persuaded\r\n    him to write the story of his early life in _Præterita_. The\r\n    title is strange, but the book itself is, with one exception, the\r\n    most interesting of Ruskin's works.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF RUSKIN. The works of Ruskin fall naturally into three classes,\r\nwhich are called criticisms of art, industry and life, but which are, in\r\nfact, profound studies of the origin and meaning of art on the one hand,\r\nand of the infinite value of human life on the other.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of his art criticisms are _St. Mark's Rest_ and\r\n_Mornings in Florence_, which are widely used as guidebooks, and which\r\nmay be postponed until the happy time when, in Venice or Florence, one may\r\nread them to best advantage. Meanwhile, in _Seven Lamps of\r\nArchitecture_ or _Stones of Venice_ or the first two volumes of\r\n_Modern Painters_, one may grow acquainted with Ruskin's theory of\r\nart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS THEORY OF ART]\r\n\r\nHis fundamental principle was summarized by Pope in the line, \"All nature\r\nis but art unknown to thee.\" That nature is the artist's source of\r\ninspiration, that art at its best can but copy some natural beauty, and\r\nthat the copy should be preceded by careful and loving study of the\r\noriginal,--this was the sum of his early teaching. Next, Ruskin looked\r\nwithin the soul of the artist and announced that true art has a spiritual\r\nmotive, that it springs from the noblest ideals of life, that the moral\r\nvalue of any people may be read in the pictures or buildings which they\r\nproduced. A third principle was that the best works of art, reflecting as\r\nthey do the ideals of a community, should belong to the people, not to a\r\nfew collectors; and a fourth exalted the usefulness of art in increasing\r\nnot only the pleasure but the power of life. So Ruskin urged that art be\r\ntaught in all schools and workshops, and that every man be encouraged to\r\nput the stamp of beauty as well as of utility upon the work of his hands;\r\nso also he formulated a plan to abolish factories, and by a system of hand\r\nlabor to give every worker the chance and the joy of self-expression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY OF ECONOMICS]\r\n\r\nIn his theory of economics Ruskin was even more revolutionary. He wrote\r\nseveral works on the subject, but the sum of his teaching may be found in\r\n_Unto This Last_; and the sum is that political economy is merely\r\ncommercial economy; that it aims to increase trade and wealth at the\r\nexpense of men and morals. \"There is no wealth but life,\" announced Ruskin,\r\n\"life including all its power of love, of joy and of admiration.\" And with\r\nminute exactness he outlined a plan for making the nation wealthy, not by\r\nmore factories and ships, but by increasing the health and happiness of\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of a century earlier Thomas Jefferson, in America, had\r\npleaded for the same ideal of national wealth, and had characterized the\r\nrace of the nations for commercial supremacy as a contagion of insanity.\r\nJefferson was called a demagogue, Ruskin a madman; but both men were\r\nprofoundly right in estimating the wealth of a nation by its store of\r\nhappiness for home consumption rather than by its store of goods for\r\nexport. They were misunderstood because they were too far in advance of\r\ntheir age to speak its trade language. They belong not to the past or\r\npresent, but to the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOR YOUNG READERS]\r\n\r\nIf but one work of Ruskin is to be read, let it be _Sesame and Lilies_\r\n(1865), which is one of the books that no intelligent reader can afford to\r\nneglect. The first chapter, \"Of Kings' Treasuries,\" is a noble essay on the\r\nsubject of reading. The second, \"Of Queens' Gardens,\" is a study of woman's\r\nlife and education, a study which may appear old-fashioned now, but which\r\nhas so much of truth and beauty that it must again, like Colonial\r\nfurniture, become our best fashion. These two essays [Footnote: A third\r\nessay, \"The Mystery of Life,\" was added to _Sesame and Lilies_. It is\r\na sad, despairing monologue, and the book might be better off without it.]\r\ncontain Ruskin's best thought on books and womanly character, and also an\r\noutline of his teaching on nature, art and society. If we read _Sesame\r\nand Lilies_ in connection with two other little books, _Crown of Wild\r\nOlive_, which treats of work, trade and war, and _Ethics of the\r\nDust_, which deals with housekeeping, we shall have the best that Ruskin\r\nproduced for his younger disciples.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF RUSKIN. To the sensitiveness and sincerity of Ruskin we have\r\nalready called attention. There is a third quality which appears\r\nfrequently, and which we call pedagogical insistence, because the author\r\nseems to labor under the impression that he must drive something into one's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThis insistent note is apt to offend readers until they learn of Ruskin's\r\nmotive and experience. He lived in a commercial age, an age that seemed to\r\nhim blind to the beauty of the world; and the purpose of his whole life\r\nwas, as he said, to help those who, having eyes, see not. His aim was high,\r\nhis effort heroic; but for all his pains he was called a visionary, a man\r\nwith a dream book. Yet he was always exact and specific. He would say, \"Go\r\nto a certain spot at a certain hour, look in a certain direction, and such\r\nand such beauties shall ye see.\" And people would go, and wag their heads,\r\nand declare that no such prospect as Ruskin described was visible to mortal\r\neyes. [Footnote: For example, Ruskin gave in _Fors Clavigera_ a\r\ndescription of a beautiful view from a bridge over the Ettrick, in\r\nScotland. Some people have sought that view in vain, and a recent critic\r\ninsists that it is invisible (Andrew Lang, _History of English\r\nLiterature_, p. 592). In Venice or Florence you may still meet travelers\r\nwith one of Ruskin's books in hand, peering about for the beauty which he\r\nsays is apparent from such and such a spot and which every traveler ought\r\nto see.]\r\n\r\nNaturally Ruskin, with his dogmatic temper, grew impatient of such\r\nblindness; hence the increasing note of insistence, of scolding even, to\r\nwhich critics have called attention. But we can forgive much in a writer\r\nwho, with marvelously clear vision, sought only to point out the beauty of\r\nnature and the moral dignity of humanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruskin's Style]\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Ruskin's style, its musical rhythm or cadence, its wealth of\r\nfigure and allusion, its brilliant coloring, like a landscape of his\r\nfavorite artist Turner,--all this is a source of pleasure to the reader,\r\nentirely aside from the subject matter. Read, for example, the description\r\nof St. Mark's Cathedral in _Stones of Venice_, or the reflected\r\nglories of nature in _Præterita_, or the contrast between Salisbury\r\ntowers and Giotto's campanile in _Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and\r\nsee there descriptive eloquence at its best. That this superb eloquence was\r\ndevoted not to personal or party ends, but to winning men to the love of\r\nbeauty and truth and right living, is the secret of Ruskin's high place in\r\nEnglish letters and of his enduring influence on English life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The age of Victoria (1837-1901) approaches our own so\r\n    closely that it is still difficult to form an accurate judgment of\r\n    its history or literature. In a review of the history of the age we\r\n    noted three factors, democracy, science, imperialism, which have\r\n    profoundly influenced English letters from 1850 to the present\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    Our study of Victorian literature includes (1) The life and works\r\n    of the two greater poets of the age, Tennyson and Browning. (2) The\r\n    work of Elizabeth Barrett, Matthew Arnold, Rossetti, Morris and\r\n    Swinburne, who were selected from the two hundred representive\r\n    poets of the period. (3) The life and the chief works of the major\r\n    novelists, Dickens, Thackeray and George Eliot. (4) A review of\r\n    some other novelists of the age, the Brontë Sisters, Mrs. Gaskell,\r\n    Anthony Trollope, Blackmore, Kingsley, Meredith, Hardy and\r\n    Stevenson. (5) The typical essayists and historians, Macaulay,\r\n    Carlyle, Ruskin, with a review of other typical groups of writers\r\n    in the fields of religion, history and science.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING. Typical selections from all authors named\r\n    in the text are found in Manly, English Poetry, English Prose;\r\n    Pancoast, Standard English Poems, Standard English Prose; and\r\n    several other collections, which are especially useful in a study\r\n    of the minor writers. The works of the major authors may be read to\r\n    much better advantage in various inexpensive editions prepared for\r\n    school use. Only a few such editions are named below for each\r\n    author, but a fairly complete list is given under Texts in the\r\n    General Bibliography.\r\n\r\n    Tennyson's selected minor poems, Idylls of the King, The Princess\r\n    and In Memoriam, in Standard English Classics, Riverside\r\n    Literature, Pocket Classics, Silver Classics.

The literatures of Europe began with wonder tales\r\nof a golden age, with stories of fairy ships, of kings akin to gods, of\r\nheroes who ventured into enchanted regions and there waged battle with\r\ndragons or the powers of darkness. American literature began with\r\nhistorical records, with letters of love and friendship, with diaries or\r\njournals of exploration, with elegiac poems lamenting the death of beloved\r\nleaders or hearth companions,--in a word, with the chronicles of human\r\nexperience. In this respect, of recording the facts and the truth of life\r\nas men and women fronted life bravely in the New World, our early\r\nliterature differs radically from that of any other great nation: it brings\r\nus face to face not with myths or shadows but with our ancestors.\r\n\r\nTWO VIEWS OF THE PIONEERS. It has become almost a habit among historians to\r\ndisparage early American literature, and nearly all our textbooks apologize\r\nfor it on the ground that the forefathers had no artistic feeling, their\r\nsouls being oppressed by the gloom and rigor of Puritanism.\r\n\r\nEven as we read this apology our eyes rest contentedly upon a beautiful old\r\npiece of Colonial furniture, fashioned most artistically by the very men\r\nwho are pitied for their want of art. We remember also that the Puritans\r\nfurnished only one of several strong elements in early American life, and\r\nthat wherever the Puritan influence was strongest there books and literary\r\nculture did most abound: their private libraries, for example, make our own\r\nappear rather small and trashy by comparison. [Footnote: When Plymouth\r\nconsisted of a score of cabins and a meetinghouse it had at least two\r\nexcellent libraries. Bradford had over three hundred books, and Brewster\r\nfour hundred, consisting of works of poetry, philosophy, science, devotion,\r\nand miscellanies covering the entire field of human knowledge. In view of\r\nthe scarcity of books in 1620, one of these collections, which were common\r\nin all the New England settlements, was equivalent to a modern library of\r\nthirty or forty thousand volumes.] Cotton Mather, disciplined in the\r\nstrictest of Puritan homes, wrote his poems in Greek, conducted a large\r\nforeign correspondence in Latin, read enormously, published four hundred\r\nworks, and in thousands of citations proved himself intimate with the\r\nworld's books of poetry and history, science and religion. That the leaders\r\nof the colonies, south and north, were masters of an excellent prose style\r\nis evident from their own records; that their style was influenced by their\r\nfamiliarity with the best literature appears in many ways,--in the immense\r\ncollection of books in Byrd's mansion in Virginia, for instance, or in the\r\nabundant quotations that are found in nearly all Colonial writings. Before\r\nentering college (and there was never another land with so few people and\r\nso many colleges as Colonial America) boys of fourteen passed a classical\r\nexamination which few graduates would now care to face; and the men of our\r\nearly legislatures produced state papers which for force of reasoning and\r\nlucidity of expression have never been surpassed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE QUESTION OF ART]\r\n\r\nAgain, our whole conception of American art may be modified by these\r\nconsiderations: that it requires more genius to build a free state than to\r\nmake a sonnet, and the Colonists were mighty state-builders; that a ship is\r\na beautiful object, and American ships with their graceful lines and\r\ntowering clouds of canvas were once famous the world over; that\r\narchitecture is a noble art, and Colonial architecture still charms us by\r\nits beauty and utility after three hundred years of experimental building.\r\n\"Art\" is a great word, and we use it too narrowly when we apply it to an\r\node of Shelley or a mutilated statue of Praxiteles, but are silent before a\r\nColonial church or a free commonwealth or the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO \"WESTOVER,\" HOME OF WILLIAM BYRD]\r\n\r\nInstead of an apology for our early literature, therefore, we offer this\r\npossible explanation: that our forefathers, who set their faces to one of\r\nthe most heroic tasks ever undertaken by man, were too busy with great\r\ndeeds inspired by the ideal of liberty to find leisure for the epic or\r\ndrama in which the deeds and the ideal should be worthily reflected. They\r\nleft that work of commemoration to others, and they are still waiting\r\npatiently for their poet. Meanwhile we read the straightforward record\r\nwhich they left as their only literary memorial, not as we read the\r\nimaginative story of Beowulf or Ulysses, but for the clear light of truth\r\nwhich it sheds upon the fathers and mothers of a great nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIAL PERIOD (1607-1765)\r\n\r\nThe Colonial period extends from the first English settlement at Jamestown\r\nto the Stamp Act and other measures of \"taxation without representation\"\r\nwhich tended to unite the colonies and arouse the sleeping spirit of\r\nnationality. During this century and a half the Elizabethan dramatists\r\nproduced their best work; Milton, Bunyan, Dryden and a score of lesser\r\nwriters were adding to the wealth of English literature; but not a single\r\nnoteworthy volume crossed the Atlantic to reflect in Europe the lyric of\r\nthe wilderness, the drama of the commonwealth, the epic of democracy. Such\r\nbooks as were written here dealt largely with matters of religion,\r\ngovernment and exploration; and we shall hardly read these books with\r\nsympathy, and therefore with understanding, unless we remember two facts:\r\nthat the Colonists, grown weary of ancient tyranny, were determined to\r\nwrite a new page in the world's history; and that they reverently believed\r\nGod had called them to make that new page record the triumph of freedom and\r\nmanhood. Hence the historical impulse and the moral or religious bent of\r\nnearly all our early writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLYMOUTH IN 1662. BRADFORD'S HOUSE ON RIGHT]\r\n\r\nANNALISTS AND HISTORIANS. Of the fifty or more annalists of the period we\r\nselect two as typical of the rest. The first is William Bradford\r\n(_cir_. 1590-1657), a noble and learned man, at one time governor of\r\nthe Plymouth Colony. In collaboration with Winslow he wrote a Journal of\r\nthe _Mayflower's_ voyage (long known as _Mourt's Relation_), and\r\nhe continued this work independently by writing _Of Plimouth\r\nPlantation_, a ruggedly sincere history of the trials and triumph of the\r\nPilgrim Fathers. The second annalist is William Byrd (1674-1744), who, a\r\ncentury after Bradford, wrote his _History of the Dividing Line_ and\r\ntwo other breezy Journals that depict with equal ease and gayety the\r\nsouthern society of the early days and the march or campfire scenes of an\r\nexploring party in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BYRD]\r\n\r\nThese two writers unconsciously reflected two distinct influences in\r\nColonial literature, which are epitomized in the words \"Puritan\" and\r\n\"Cavalier.\" Bradford, though a Pilgrim (not a Puritan), was profoundly\r\ninfluenced by the puritanic spirit of his age, with its militant\r\nindependence, its zeal for liberty and righteousness, its confidence in the\r\ndivine guidance of human affairs. When he wrote his history, therefore, he\r\nwas in the mood of one to whom the Lord had said, as to Abraham, \"Get thee\r\nout of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house; and\r\nI will make of thee a great nation.\" Byrd, though born and bred in\r\ndemocratic Virginia, had in him something of the aristocrat. He reminds us\r\nof the gay Cavaliers who left England to escape the stern discipline of\r\nCromwell and the triumphant Puritans. When he looked forth upon his goodly\r\nplantation, or upon the wilderness with its teeming game, he saw them not\r\nwith the eyes of prophet or evangelist, but as one who remembered that it\r\nwas written, \"And God saw everything that he had made; and behold it was\r\nvery good.\" So he wrote his Journal in an entertaining way, making the best\r\nof misfortune, cracking a joke at difficulty or danger, and was well\r\ncontent to reflect this pleasant world without taking it upon his\r\nconscience to criticize or reform it.\r\n\r\nThe same two types of Cavalier and Puritan appear constantly in our own and\r\nother literatures as representative of two world-views, two philosophies.\r\nChaucer and Langland were early examples in English poetry, the one with\r\nhis _Canterbury Tales_, the other with his _Piers Plowman_; and\r\never since then the same two classes of writers have been reflecting the\r\nsame life from two different angles. They are not English or American but\r\nhuman types; they appear in every age and in every free nation.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL POETRY. There were several recognized poets in Colonial days, and\r\neven the annalists and theologians had a rhyming fancy which often broke\r\nloose from the bounds of prose. The quantity of Colonial verse is therefore\r\nrespectable, but the quality of it suffered from two causes: first, the\r\nwriters overlooked the feeling of their own hearts (the true source of\r\nlyric poetry) and wrote of Indian wars, theology and other unpoetic\r\nmatters; second, they wrote poetry not for its own sake but to teach moral\r\nor religious lessons. [Footnote: The above criticism applies only to poetry\r\nwritten in English for ordinary readers. At that time many college men\r\nwrote poetry in Greek and Latin, and the quality of it compares favorably\r\nwith similar poetry written in England during the same period. Several\r\nspecimens of this \"scholars' poetry\" are preserved in Mather's\r\n_Magnalia_; and there is one remarkable poem, in Greek, which was\r\nwritten in Harvard College by an Indian (one of Eliot's \"boys\") who a few\r\nyears earlier had been a whooping savage.] Thus, the most widely read poem\r\nof the period was _The Day of Doom_, which aimed frankly to recall\r\nsinners from their evil ways by holding before their eyes the terrors of\r\nthe last judgment. It was written by Michael Wigglesworth in 1662. This\r\nman, who lived a heroic but melancholy life, had a vein of true poetry in\r\nhim, as when he wrote his \"Dear New England, Dearest Land to Me,\" and from\r\nhis bed of suffering sent out the call to his people:\r\n\r\n  Cheer on, brave souls, my heart is with you all.\r\n\r\nBut he was too much absorbed in stern theological dogmas to find the beauty\r\nof life or the gold of poesie; and his masterpiece, once prized by an\r\nimmense circle of readers, seems now a grotesque affair, which might appear\r\neven horrible were it not rendered harmless by its jigging, Yankee-Doodle\r\nversification.\r\n\r\nThe most extravagantly praised versifier of the age, and the first to win a\r\nreputation in England as well as in America, was Anne Bradstreet\r\n(1612-1672), who wrote a book of poems that a London publisher proudly\r\nissued under the title of _The Tenth Muse_ (1650). The best of\r\nColonial poets was Thomas Godfrey of Philadelphia (1736-1763), whose\r\n_Juvenile Poems, with the Prince of Parthia, a Tragedy_ contained a\r\nfew lyrics, odes and pastorals that were different in form and spirit from\r\nanything hitherto attempted on this side of the Atlantic. This slender\r\nvolume was published in 1765, soon after Godfrey's untimely death. With its\r\nevident love of beauty and its carefulness of poetic form, it marks the\r\nbeginning here of artistic literature; that is, literature which was\r\nwritten to please readers rather than to teach history or moral lessons.\r\n\r\nNATURE AND HUMAN NATURE. In the literature of the world the two subjects of\r\nabiding poetic interest are nature and human nature; but as these subjects\r\nappear in Colonial records they are uniformly prosaic, and the reason is\r\nvery simple. Before nature can be the theme of poets she must assume her\r\nwinsome mood, must \"soothe and heal and bless\" the human heart after the\r\nclamor of politics, the weariness of trade, the cruel strife of society. To\r\nread Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\" or Bryant's \"To a Waterfowl\" is to\r\nunderstand the above criticism. But the nature which the Colonists first\r\nlooked upon seemed wild and strange and often terrible. Their somber\r\nforests were vast, mysterious, forbidding; and they knew not what perils\r\nlurked in them or beyond them. The new climate might give them sunshine or\r\nhealing rain, but was quite as likely to strike their houses with\r\nthunderbolts or harrow their harvests with a cyclone. Meanwhile marauding\r\ncrows pulled up their precious corn; fierce owls with tufted heads preyed\r\nupon their poultry; bears and eagles harried their flocks; the winter wail\r\nof the wolf pack or the scream of a hungry panther, sounding through icy,\r\necholess woods, made them shiver in their cabins and draw nearer the\r\nblazing fire of pine knots on the hearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW AMSTERDAM (NEW YORK) IN 1663]\r\n\r\nWe can understand, therefore, why there was little poetry of nature in\r\nColonial literature, and why, instead of sonnets to moonbeams or\r\nnightingales, we meet quaint and fascinating studies of natural or\r\nunnatural history. Such are Josselyn's _New England's Rarities\r\nDiscovered_ and the first part of William Wood's _New England's\r\nProspect_; and such are many chapters of Byrd's _Dividing Line_ and\r\nother annals that deal with plant or animal life,--books that we now read\r\nwith pleasure, since the nature that was once wild and strange has become\r\nin our eyes familiar and dear.\r\n\r\nAs for the second subject of poetic interest, human nature, the Colonists\r\nhad as much of that as any other people; but human nature as it revealed\r\nitself in religious controversy, or became a burden in the immigrants that\r\nwere unloaded on our shores for the relief of Europe or the enrichment of\r\nthe early transportation companies, as Bradford and Beverley both tell\r\nus,--this furnished a vital subject not for poetry but for prose and\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INDIANS]\r\n\r\nThe Indians especially, \"the wild men\" as they were called, slipping out of\r\nthe shadows or vanishing into mysterious distances, were a source of\r\nanxiety and endless speculation to the early settlers. European writers\r\nlike Rousseau, who had never seen an Indian or heard a war-whoop, had been\r\nindustrious in idealizing the savages, attributing to them all manner of\r\nnoble virtues; and the sentimental attitude of these foreign writers was\r\nreflected here, after the eastern Indians had well-nigh vanished, in such\r\nstories as Mrs. Morton's _Quabi, or The Virtues of Nature_, a romance\r\nin verse which was published in 1790. In the same romantic strain are\r\nCooper's _Last of the Mohicans_, Helen Hunt's _Ramona_ and some\r\nof the early poems of Freneau and Whittier.\r\n\r\nThe Colonists, on the other hand, had no poetic illusions about the\r\nsavages. Their enjoyment of this phase of human nature was hardly possible\r\nso long as they had to proceed warily on a forest trail, their eyes keen\r\nfor the first glimpse of a hideously painted face, their ears alert for the\r\ntwang of a bowstring or the hiss of a feathered arrow. Their deep but\r\npractical interest in the Indians found expression in scores of books,\r\nwhich fall roughly into three groups. In the first are the scholarly works\r\nof the heroic John Eliot, \"the apostle to the Indians\"; of Daniel Gookin\r\nalso, and of a few others who made careful studies of the language and\r\ncustoms of the various Indian tribes. In the second group are the startling\r\nexperiences of men and women who were carried away by the savages, leaving\r\nslaughtered children and burning homes behind them. Such are Mary\r\nRowlandson's _The Sovereignty and Goodness of God_ and John Williams's\r\n_The Redeemed Captive_, both famous in their day, and still of lively\r\ninterest. In the third group are the fighting stories, such as John Mason's\r\n_History of the Pequot War_. The adventures and hairbreadth escapes\r\nrecorded as sober facts in these narratives were an excellent substitute\r\nfor fiction during the Colonial period. Moreover, they furnished a motive\r\nand method for the Indian tales and Wild West stories which have since\r\nappeared as the sands of the sea for multitude.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS WRITERS. A very large part of our early writings is devoted to\r\nreligious subjects, and for an excellent reason; namely, that large numbers\r\nof the Colonists came to America to escape religious strife or persecution\r\nat home. In the New World they sought religious peace as well as freedom of\r\nworship, and were determined to secure it not only for themselves but for\r\ntheir children's children. Hence in nearly all their writings the religious\r\nmotive was uppermost. Hardly were they settled here, however, when they\r\nwere rudely disturbed by agitators who fomented discord by preaching each\r\nhis own pet doctrine or heresy. Presently arose a score of controversial\r\nwriters; and then Anne Hutchinson, Roger Williams and the early Quakers\r\nwere disciplined or banished, not because of their faith (for the fact is\r\nthat all the colonies contained men of widely different beliefs who lived\r\npeaceably together), but because these unbalanced reformers were\r\nobstinately bent upon stirring up strife in a community which had crossed\r\nthree thousand miles of ocean in search of peace.\r\n\r\nOf the theological writers we again select two, not because they were\r\ntypical,--for it is hard to determine who, among the hundred writers that\r\nfronted the burning question of religious tolerance, were representative of\r\ntheir age,--but simply because they towered head and shoulders above their\r\ncontemporaries. These are Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards; the one the\r\nmost busy man of his age in politics, religion, education and all\r\nphilanthropic endeavor; the other a profound thinker, who was in the world\r\nbut not of it, and who devoted the great powers of his mind to such\r\nproblems as the freedom of the human will and the origin of the religious\r\nimpulse in humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON MATHER]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COTTON MATHER]\r\n\r\nCotton Mather (1663-1728) is commonly known by his _Wonders of the\r\nInvisible World_, which dealt with the matter of demons and witchcraft;\r\nbut that is one of the least of his four hundred works, and it has given a\r\nwrong impression of the author and of the age in which he lived. His chief\r\nwork is the _Magnalia Christi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of\r\nNew England_ (1702), which is a strange jumble of patriotism and\r\npedantry, of wisdom and foolishness, written in the fantastic style of\r\nRobert Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_. The most interesting and\r\nvaluable parts of this chaotic work are the second and third books, which\r\ngive us the life stories of Bradford, Winthrop, Eliot, Phipps and many\r\nother heroic worthies who helped mightily in laying the foundation of the\r\nAmerican republic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JONATHAN EDWARDS]\r\n\r\nThe most famous works of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) are the so-called\r\n_Freedom of the Will_ and the _Treatise Concerning the Religious\r\nAffections_; but these are hard reading, not to be lightly undertaken.\r\nIt is from the author's minor and neglected works that one receives the\r\nimpression that he was a very great and noble man, shackled by a terrible\r\ntheology. By his scholarship, his rare sincerity, his love of truth, his\r\noriginal mind and his transparent style of writing he exercised probably a\r\ngreater influence at home and abroad than any other writer of the colonial\r\nera. In Whittier's poem \"The Preacher\" there is a tribute to the tender\r\nhumanity of Edwards, following this picture of his stern thinking:\r\n\r\n  In the church of the wilderness Edwards wrought,\r\n  Shaping his creed at the forge of thought;\r\n  And with Thor's own hammer welded and bent\r\n  The iron links of his argument,\r\n  Which strove to grasp in its mighty span\r\n  The purpose of God and the fate of man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD (1765-1800)\r\n\r\nThe literary period included in the above term is, in general, the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century; more particularly it extends from the Stamp\r\nAct (1765), which united the colonies in opposition to Britain's policy of\r\ntaxation, to the adoption of the Constitution (1787) and the inauguration\r\nof Washington as first president of the new nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARTY LITERATURE]\r\n\r\nThe writings of this stormy period reflect the temper of two very different\r\nclasses who were engaged in constant literary Party warfare. In the tense\r\nyears which preceded the Literature Revolution the American people\r\nseparated into two hostile parties: the Tories, or Loyalists, who supported\r\nthe mother country; and the Whigs, or Patriots, who insisted on the right\r\nof the colonies to manage their own affairs, and who furnished the armies\r\nthat followed Washington in the War of Independence. Then, when America had\r\nwon a place among the free nations of the world, her people were again\r\ndivided on the question of the Constitution. On the one side were the\r\nFederalists, who aimed at union in the strictest sense; that is, at a\r\nstrongly centralized government with immense powers over all its parts. On\r\nthe other side were the Anti-Federalists, or Antis, who distrusted the\r\nmonarchical tendency of every centralized government since time began, and\r\nwho aimed to safeguard democracy by leaving the governing power as largely\r\nas possible in the hands of the several states. It is necessary to have\r\nthese distinctions clearly in mind in reading Revolutionary literature, for\r\na very large part of its prose and poetry reflects the antagonistic aims or\r\nideals of two parties which stood in constant and most bitter opposition.\r\n\r\nIn general, the literature of the Revolution is dominated by political and\r\npractical interests; it deals frankly with this present world, aims to find\r\nthe best way through its difficulties, and so appears in marked contrast\r\nwith the theological bent and pervasive \"other worldliness\" of Colonial\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN. Standing between the two eras, and marking the\r\ntransition from spiritual to practical interests, is Benjamin Franklin\r\n(1706-1790), a \"self-made\" man, who seems well content with his handiwork.\r\nDuring the latter part of his life and for a century after his death he was\r\nheld up to young Americans as a striking example of practical wisdom and\r\nworldly success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Franklin's patriotic service belongs to political rather\r\nthan to literary history; for though his pen was busy for almost seventy\r\nyears, during which time he produced an immense amount of writing, his end\r\nwas always very practical rather than aesthetic; that is, he aimed to\r\ninstruct rather than to please his readers. Only one of his works is now\r\nwidely known, the incomplete _Autobiography_, which is in the form of\r\na letter telling a straightforward story of Franklin's early life, of the\r\ndisadvantages under which he labored and the industry by which he overcame\r\nthem. For some reason the book has become a \"classic\" in our literature,\r\nand young Americans are urged to read it; though they often show an\r\nindependent taste by regarding it askance. As an example of what may be\r\naccomplished by perseverance, and as a stimulus to industry in the prosaic\r\nmatter of getting a living, it doubtless has its value; but one will learn\r\nnothing of love or courtesy or reverence or loyalty to high ideals by\r\nreading it; neither will one find in its self-satisfied pages any\r\nconception of the moral dignity of humanity or of the infinite value of the\r\nhuman soul. The chief trouble with the _Autobiography_ and most other\r\nworks of Franklin is that in them mind and matter, character and\r\nreputation, virtue and prosperity, are for the most part hopelessly\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a sincerity, a plain directness of style in the\r\nwritings of Franklin which makes them pleasantly readable. Unlike some\r\nother apostles of \"common sense\" he is always courteous and of a friendly\r\nspirit; he seems to respect the reader as well as himself and, even in his\r\nargumentative or humorous passages, is almost invariably dignified in\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN'S SHOP]\r\n\r\nOther works of Franklin which were once popular are the maxims of his\r\n_Poor Richard's Almanac_, which appeared annually from 1732 to 1757.\r\nThese maxims--such as \"Light purse, heavy heart,\" \"Diligence is the mother\r\nof good luck,\" \"He who waits upon Fortune is never sure of a dinner,\" \"God\r\nhelps them who help themselves,\" \"Honesty is the best policy,\" and many\r\nothers in a similar vein--were widely copied in Colonial and European\r\npublications; and to this day they give to Americans abroad a reputation\r\nfor \"Yankee\" shrewdness. The best of them were finally strung together in\r\nthe form of a discourse (the alleged speech of an old man at an auction,\r\nwhere people were complaining of the taxes), which under various titles,\r\nsuch as \"The Way to Wealth\" and \"Father Abraham's Speech,\" has been\r\ntranslated into every civilized language. Following is a brief selection\r\nfrom which one may judge the spirit of the entire address:\r\n\r\n    \"It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people\r\n    one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its service; but\r\n    idleness taxes many of us much more; sloth, by bringing on\r\n    diseases, absolutely shortens life. Sloth, like rust, consumes\r\n    faster than labor wears, while 'The used key is always bright,' as\r\n    Poor Richard says. 'But dost thou love life? Then do not squander\r\n    time, for that is the stuff life is made of,' as Poor Richard says.\r\n    How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting\r\n    that the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be\r\n    sleeping enough in the grave, as Poor Richard says. If time be of\r\n    all things the most precious, wasting time must be, as Poor Richard\r\n    says, the greatest prodigality; since, as he elsewhere tells us,\r\n    'Lost time is never found again,' and what we call time enough\r\n    always proves little enough. Let us, then, be up and be doing, and\r\n    doing to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less\r\n    perplexity. 'Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry, all\r\n    easy'; and, 'He that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce\r\n    overtake his business at night'; while 'Laziness travels so slowly\r\n    that Poverty soon overtakes him.' 'Drive thy business, let not that\r\n    drive thee'; and, 'Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man\r\n    healthy, wealthy and wise,' as Poor Richard says.\"\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY POETRY. The poetry of the Revolution, an abundant but weedy\r\ncrop, was badly influenced by two factors: by the political strife between\r\nPatriots and Loyalists, and by the slavish imitation of Pope and other\r\nformalists who were then the models for nearly all versifiers on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic. The former influence appears in numerous ballads or\r\nnarrative poems, which were as popular in the days of Washington as ever\r\nthey were in the time of Robin Hood. Every important event of the\r\nRevolution was promptly celebrated in verse; but as the country was then\r\nsharply divided, almost every ballad had a Whig or a Tory twist to it. In\r\nconsequence we must read two different collections, such as Moore's\r\n_Songs and Ballads of the American Revolution_ and Sargent's\r\n_Loyalist Poetry of the Revolution_, for supplementary views of the\r\nsame great struggle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HARTFORD WITS]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Pope and his school is especially noticeable in the work\r\nof a group of men called the Hartford Wits, who at the beginning of our\r\nnational life had the worthy ambition to create a national literature.\r\nProminent among these so-called wits were Joel Barlow (1754-1812) and\r\nTimothy Dwight (1752-1817). In such ponderous works as Barlow's\r\n_Columbiad_ and Dwight's _Conquest of Canaan_, both written in\r\nmechanical rhymed couplets, we have a reflection not of the glories of\r\nAmerican history, as the authors intended, but of two aspiring men who,\r\nwithout genius or humor, hoped by industry to produce poems that in size at\r\nleast should be worthy of a country that stretched between two oceans.\r\n\r\nMore gifted than either of his fellow \"wits\" was John Trumbull (1750-1831),\r\nwho had the instinct of a poet but who was led aside by the strife of Whigs\r\nand Tories into the barren field of political satire. His best-known work\r\nis _M'Fingal_ (1775), a burlesque poem in the doggerel style of\r\nButler's _Hudibras_, which ridiculed a Tory squire and described his\r\nbarbarous punishment at the hands of a riotous mob of Whigs. It was the\r\nmost widely quoted poem of the entire Revolutionary period, and is still\r\ninteresting as an example of rough humor and as a reflection of the\r\nmilitant age in which it was produced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRENEAU]\r\n\r\nBy far the best poet of the Revolution was Philip Freneau (1752-1832). In\r\nhis early years he took Milton instead of Pope for his poetic master; then,\r\nas his independence increased, he sought the ancient source of all poetry\r\nin the feeling of the human heart in presence of nature or human nature. In\r\nsuch poems as \"The House of Night,\" \"Indian Burying Ground,\" \"Wild\r\nHoneysuckle,\" \"Eutaw Springs,\" \"Ruins of a Country Inn\" and a few others in\r\nwhich he speaks from his own heart, he anticipated the work of Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge and other leaders of what is now commonly known as the romantic\r\nrevival in English poetry.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution drew on apace Freneau abandoned his poetic dream and\r\nexercised a ferocious talent for satiric verse in lashing English generals,\r\nnative Tories, royal proclamations and other matters far removed from\r\npoetry. In later years he wrote much prose also, and being a radical and\r\noutspoken democrat he became a thorn in the side of Washington and the\r\nFederal party. The bulk of his work, both prose and verse, is a red-peppery\r\nkind of commentary on the political history of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP FRENEAU]\r\n\r\nORATORS AND STATESMEN. For a full century, or from the Stamp Act to the\r\nCivil War, oratory was a potent influence in molding our national life; and\r\nunlike other influences, which grow by slow degrees, it sprang into\r\nvigorous life in the period of intense agitation that preceded the\r\nRevolution. Never before or since has the power of the spoken word been\r\nmore manifest than during the years when questions of state were debated,\r\nnot by kings or counselors behind closed doors, but by representative men\r\nin open assembly, by farmers and artisans in town halls fronting a village\r\ngreen, by scholarly ministers in the pulpits of churches whose white\r\nsteeples with their golden vanes spoke silently, ceaselessly, of God and\r\nFreedom as the two motives which had inspired the fathers to brave the\r\nperils of a savage wilderness.\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous addresses of the age were the speech of James Otis in\r\nthe town hall at Boston (1761) and the \"Liberty or Death\" speech of Patrick\r\nHenry to the Virginia burgesses assembled in St. John's church in Richmond\r\n(1775). To compare these stirring appeals to patriotism with the\r\nparliamentary addresses of a brilliant contemporary, Edmund Burke, is to\r\nnote a striking difference between English and American oratory of the\r\nperiod, the one charming the ear by its eloquence, the other rousing the\r\nwill to action like a bugle call.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS JEFFERSON]\r\n\r\nThe statesmen of the Revolution, that glorious band whom Washington led,\r\nwere also voluminous writers and masters of a clear, forceful style; but it\r\nwould probably surprise them now to find themselves included in a history\r\nof literature. In truth, they hardly belong there; for they wrote not with\r\nany artistic impulse to create a work of beauty that should please their\r\nreaders; their practical aim was to inculcate sound political principles or\r\nto move their readers to the right action. If we contrast them with certain\r\nof their British contemporaries, with Goldsmith and Burns for example, the\r\ntruth of the above criticism will be evident. Nevertheless, these statesmen\r\nproduced a body of so-called citizen literature, devoted to the principles\r\nand duties of free government, which has never been rivaled in its own\r\nfield and which is quite as remarkable in its own way as the nature poetry\r\nof Bryant or the romances of Cooper or any other purely literary work\r\nproduced in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]\r\n\r\nHAMILTON AND JEFFERSON. These two statesmen, who became bitter antagonists\r\nduring the struggle over the Constitution, may be selected as typical of\r\nall the rest. The story of their splendid services in the cause of liberty\r\ncannot be told here; such men belong to history rather than to literature;\r\nbut we may at least note that they deserve more careful and unprejudiced\r\nstudy than rival political parties have thus far given them. Their work has\r\na broad human interest which extends far beyond the borders of America,\r\nsince they stand for two radically different conceptions of life, one\r\naristocratic, the other democratic, which appear in every age and explain\r\nthe political and social divisions among free peoples. Hamilton (the\r\nFederalist) denied the right and the ability of common men to govern\r\nthemselves; he was the champion of aristocracy, of class privilege, of\r\ncentralized power in the hands of the few whom he deemed worthy by birth or\r\ntalent to govern a nation. The most significant trait of Jefferson (the\r\nAnti-Federalist) was his lifelong devotion to democracy. He believed in\r\ncommon men, in their ability to choose the right and their purpose to\r\nfollow it, and he mightily opposed every tendency to aristocracy or class\r\nprivilege in America. In the struggle over the Constitution he was fearful\r\nthat the United States government would become monarchical if given too\r\nmuch authority, and aimed to safeguard democracy by leaving the governing\r\npower as largely as possible in the hands of the several states. To readers\r\nwho are not politicians the most interesting thing concerning these two\r\nleaders is that Hamilton, the champion of aristocracy, was obscurely born\r\nand appeared here as a stranger to make his own way by his own efforts;\r\nwhile Jefferson, the uncompromising democrat, came from an excellent\r\nVirginia family and was familiar from his youth with aristocratic society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTICELLO, THE HOME OF JEFFERSON IN VIRGINIA\r\nThe westward front]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL WRITINGS]\r\n\r\nThe best-known work of Hamilton (to which Madison and Jay contributed\r\nliberally) is _The Federalist_ (1787). This is a remarkable series of\r\nessays supporting the Constitution and illuminating the principles of union\r\nand federation. The one work of Jefferson which will make his name\r\nremembered to all ages is the _Declaration of Independence_. Besides\r\nthis document, which is less a state paper than a prose chant of freedom,\r\nhe wrote a multitude of works, a part of which are now collected in ten\r\nlarge volumes. These are known only to historians; but the casual reader\r\nwill find many things of interest in Jefferson's _Letters_, in his\r\n_Autobiography_ and in his _Summary View of the Rights of\r\nAmerica_ (1774). The last-named work gave Burke some information and\r\ninspiration for his famous oration \"On Conciliation with America\" and was a\r\npotent influence in uniting the colonies in their struggle for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS WORKS. In the miscellaneous works of the period may be found\r\nmore pleasurable reading than in the portly volumes that contain the epics\r\nof the Hartford Wits or the arguments of Revolutionary statesmen. As a type\r\nof the forceful political pamphlet, a weapon widely used in England and\r\nAmerica in the eighteenth century, there is nothing equal to Thomas Paine's\r\n_Common Sense_ (1776) and _The Crisis_ (1776-1783). The former\r\nhastened on the Declaration of Independence; the latter cheered the young\r\nPatriots in their struggle to make that Declaration valid in the sight of\r\nall nations. Jonathan Carver's _Travels through the Interior Parts of\r\nNorth America_ (1778) is an excellent outdoor book dealing with\r\npicturesque incidents of exploration in unknown wilds. The letters of\r\nAbigail Adams, Eliza Wilkinson and Dolly Madison portray quiet scenes of\r\ndomestic life and something of the brave, helpful spirit of the mothers of\r\nthe Revolution. Crèvecoeur's _Letters from an American Farmer_ (1782)\r\ndraws charming, almost idyllic, pictures of American life during the\r\nRevolutionary period, and incidentally calls attention to the \"melting\r\npot,\" in which people of various races are here fused into a common stock.\r\nThis mongrel, melting-pot idea (a crazy notion) is supposed to be modern,\r\nand has lately occasioned some flighty dramas and novels; but that it is as\r\nold as unrestricted immigration appears plainly in one of Crèvecoeur's\r\nfanciful sketches:\r\n\r\n    \"What then is the American, this new man? He is either a European\r\n    or a descendant of a European; hence that strange mixture of blood,\r\n    which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a\r\n    family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch,\r\n    whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have\r\n    now four wives of different nations. _He_ is an American who,\r\n    leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives\r\n    new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new\r\n    government he obeys, the new rank he holds. He becomes an American\r\n    by being received in the broad lap of our great Alma Mater.\r\n\r\n    \"Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men\r\n    whose labours and posterity will one day cause great changes in the\r\n    world. Americans are the western pilgrims, who are carrying along\r\n    with them that great mass of arts, sciences, vigour and industry\r\n    which began long since in the East; they will finish the great\r\n    circle. The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here\r\n    they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population\r\n    which has ever appeared, and which hereafter will become distinct\r\n    by the power of the different climate they inhabit. The American is\r\n    a new man, who acts upon new principles; he must therefore\r\n    entertain new ideas and form new opinions. From involuntary\r\n    idleness, servile dependence, penury and useless labour he has\r\n    passed to toils of a very different nature, rewarded by ample\r\n    subsistence. This is an American.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the _Journal of John Woolman_ (1774), written by a\r\ngentle member of the society of Friends, which records a spiritual rather\r\nthan a worldly experience, and which in contrast with the general tumult of\r\nRevolutionary literature is as a thrush song in the woods at twilight. It\r\nis a book for those who can appreciate its charm of simplicity and\r\nsincerity; but the few who know it are inclined to prize it far above the\r\nsimilar work of Franklin, and to unite with Channing in calling it \"the\r\nsweetest and purest autobiography in the English language.\"\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF AMERICAN FICTION. Those who imagine that American fiction\r\nbegan with Irving or Cooper or Poe, as is sometimes alleged, will be\r\ninterested to learn of Susanna Rowson (daughter of an English father and an\r\nAmerican mother), whose later stories, at least, belong to our literature.\r\nIn 1790 she published _Charlotte Temple_, a romance that was immensely\r\npopular in its own day and that has proved far more enduring than any\r\nmodern \"best seller.\" During the next century the book ran through more\r\nthan one hundred editions, the last appearing in 1905; and from first to\r\nlast it has had probably more readers than any novel of Scott or Cooper or\r\nDickens. The reception of this work indicates the widespread interest in\r\nfiction here in the late eighteenth century. Moreover, as there were then\r\ntwo types of fiction in England, the sentimentalism of Richardson and the\r\nrealism of Fielding, so in America the gushing romances of Mrs. Rowson were\r\nopposed by the _Female Quixotism_ and other alleged realistic stories\r\nof Tabitha Tenney. Both schools of fiction had here their authors and their\r\nmultitudinous readers while Irving and Cooper were learning their alphabet\r\nand Poe was yet unborn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES BROCKDEN BROWN]\r\n\r\nInto the crude but hopeful beginnings of American fiction we shall not\r\nenter, for the simple reason that our earliest romances are hardly worth\r\nthe time or patience of any but historical students. At the close of the\r\nRevolutionary period, however, appeared a writer whom we may call with some\r\njustice the first American novelist. This was Charles Brockden Brown\r\n(1771-1810), who is worthy to be remembered on three counts: he was the\r\nfirst in this country to follow literature as a profession; he chose\r\nAmerican rather than foreign heroes, and pictured them against an American\r\nbackground; and finally, his use of horrible or grotesque incidents was\r\ncopied by Poe, his Indian adventures suggested a fruitful theme to Cooper,\r\nand his minute analysis of motives and emotions was carried out in a more\r\nartistic way by Hawthorne. Hence we may find in Brown's neglected works\r\nsomething of the material and the method of our three greatest writers of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MOTIVE OF HORROR]\r\n\r\nThe six romances of Brown are all dominated by the motive of horror, and\r\nare modeled on the so-called Gothic novel with its sentimental heroine, its\r\ndiabolical villain, its ghastly mystery, its passages of prolonged agony.\r\nIf we ask why an American writer should choose this bizarre type, the\r\nanswer is that agonizing stories were precisely what readers then wanted,\r\nand Brown depended upon his stories for his daily bread. At the present\r\ntime a different kind of fiction is momentarily popular; yet if we begin\r\none of Brown's bloodcurdling romances, the chances are that we shall finish\r\nit, since it appeals to that strange interest in morbid themes which leads\r\nso many to read Poe or some other purveyor of horrors and mysteries.\r\n_Wieland_ (1798) is commonly regarded as the best of Brown's works,\r\nbut is too grotesque and horrible to be recommended. _Edgar Huntley_\r\n(1801), with its Indian adventures depicted against a background of wild\r\nnature, is a little more wholesome, and may serve very well as a type of\r\nthe romances that interested readers a century or more ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The Colonial period covers the century and a half from the\r\n    settlement of Jamestown, in 1607, to the Stamp Act of 1765. The\r\n    literature of this early age shows two general characteristics, one\r\n    historical, the other theological. The Colonists believed that they\r\n    were chosen by God to establish a new nation of freemen; hence\r\n    their tendency to write annals and to preserve every document that\r\n    might be of use to the future republic. Moreover, they were for the\r\n    most part religious men and women; they aimed to give their\r\n    children sound education and godly character; hence their\r\n    insistence on schools and universities (seven colleges were quickly\r\n    founded in the wilderness) for the training of leaders of the\r\n    people; hence also the religious note which sounds through nearly\r\n    all their writing.\r\n\r\n    In our review of the Colonial period we noted four classes of\r\n    writers: (i) The annalists and historians, of whom Bradford and\r\n    Byrd were selected as typical of two classes of writers who appear\r\n    constantly in our own and other literatures. (2) The poets, of whom\r\n    Wigglesworth, Anne Bradstreet and Godfrey are the most notable. (3)\r\n    A few characteristic books dealing with nature and the Indians,\r\n    which served readers of those days in the place of fiction. (4)\r\n    Theological writers, among whom Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards\r\n    are the most conspicuous.\r\n\r\n    The Revolutionary period extends from 1765 to the close of the\r\n    century. A large part of the literature of this period deals, in\r\n    the early years, with the strife of Loyalists and Patriots or, in\r\n    the later years, with the word wars of Federalists and\r\n    Anti-Federalists. These are the political parties into which\r\n    America was divided by the Revolution and by the question of the\r\n    Constitution. In general, Revolutionary writing has a practical\r\n    bent in marked contrast with the theological spirit of Colonial\r\n    writing.\r\n\r\n    Our study of Revolutionary literature includes: (1) Benjamin\r\n    Franklin who marks the transition from Colonial to Revolutionary\r\n    times, from spiritual to worldly interests. (2) Revolutionary\r\n    poetry, with its numerous ballads and political satires; the effort\r\n    of the Hartford Wits to establish a national literature; and the\r\n    work of Philip Freneau, who was a romantic poet at heart, but who\r\n    was led aside by the strife of the age into political and satiric\r\n    writing. (3) Orators and statesmen, of whom Otis and Henry,\r\n    Hamilton and Jefferson were selected as typical. (4) Miscellaneous\r\n    writers such as Paine, Crevecoeur, Carver, Abigail Adams and John\r\n    Woolman who reflected the life of the times from various angles.\r\n    (5) Charles Brockden Brown, and the beginning of American fiction.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

It was in the early part of the nineteenth\r\n    century that America began to be counted among the great nations of\r\n    the world, and it was precisely at that time that she produced her\r\n    first national literature, a literature so broadly human that it\r\n    appealed not only to the whole country but to readers beyond the\r\n    sea. Irving, Cooper and Bryant are commonly regarded as the first\r\n    notable New World writers; and we may better understand them and\r\n    their enthusiastic young contemporaries if we remember that they\r\n    \"grew up with the country\"; that they reflected life at a time when\r\n    America, having won her independence and emerged from a long period\r\n    of doubt and struggle, was taking her first confident steps in the\r\n    sun and becoming splendidly conscious of her destiny as a leader\r\n    among the world's free people.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: NATIONAL ENTHUSIASM]\r\n\r\n    Indeed, there was good reason for confidence in those early days;\r\n    for never had a young nation looked forth upon a more heartening\r\n    prospect. The primitive hamlets of Colonial days had been replaced\r\n    by a multitude of substantial towns, the somber wilderness by a\r\n    prosperous farming country. The power of a thousand rivers was\r\n    turning the wheels of as many mills or factories, and to the\r\n    natural wealth of America was added the increase of a mighty\r\n    commerce with other nations. By the Louisiana Purchase and the\r\n    acquisition of Florida her territory was vastly increased, and\r\n    still her sturdy pioneers were pressing eagerly into more spacious\r\n    lands beyond the Mississippi. Best of all, this enlarging nation,\r\n    once a number of scattered colonies holding each to its own course,\r\n    was now the Union; her people were as one in their patriotism,\r\n    their loyalty, their intense conviction that the brave New World\r\n    experiment in free government, once scoffed at as an idle dream,\r\n    was destined to a glorious future. American democracy was not\r\n    merely a success; it was an amazing triumph. Moreover, this\r\n    democracy, supposed to be the weakest form of government, had\r\n    already proved its power; it had sent its navy abroad to humble the\r\n    insolent Barbary States, and had measured the temper of its soul\r\n    and the strength of its arm in the second war with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    In fine, the New World had brought forth a hopeful young giant of a\r\n    nation; and its hopefulness was reflected, with more of zeal than\r\n    of art, in the prose and poetry of its literary men. Just as the\r\n    enthusiastic Elizabethan spirit reflected itself in lyric or drama\r\n    after the defeat of the Armada, so the American spirit seemed to\r\n    exult in the romances of Cooper and Simms; in the verse of\r\n    Pinckney, Halleck, Drake and Percival; in a multitude of national\r\n    songs, such as \"The American Flag,\" Warren's Address, \"Home Sweet\r\n    Home\" and \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" We would not venture to liken\r\n    one set of writings to the other, for we should be on the weak side\r\n    of an Elizabethan comparison; we simply note that a great national\r\n    enthusiasm was largely responsible for the sudden appearance of a\r\n    new literature in the one land as in the other.\r\n\r\nLITERARY ENVIRONMENT. In the works of four writers, Irving, Cooper, Bryant\r\nand Poe, we have the best that the early national period produced; but we\r\nshall not appreciate these writers until we see them, like pines in a wood,\r\nlifting their heads over numerous companions, all drawing their nourishment\r\nfrom the same soil and air. The growth of towns and cities in America had\r\nled to a rapid increase of newspapers, magazines and annuals (collections\r\nof contemporary prose and verse), which called with increasing emphasis for\r\npoems, stories, essays, light or \"polite\" literature. The rapid growth of\r\nthe nation set men to singing the old psalm of _Sursum Corda_, and\r\nevery man and woman who felt the impulse added his story or his verse to\r\nthe national chorus. When the first attempt at a summary of American\r\nliterature was made in 1837, the author, Royal Robbins, found more than two\r\nthousand living writers demanding his attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KNICKERBOCKER SCHOOL]\r\n\r\nIt was due, one must think, to geography rather than to any spirit of\r\nsectionalism, to difficulty of travel between the larger towns rather than\r\nto any difference of aim or motive, that the writers of this period\r\nassociated themselves in a number of so-called schools or literary centers.\r\nNew York, which now offered a better field for literary work than Boston or\r\nPhiladelphia, had its important group of writers called the Knickerbocker\r\nSchool, which included Fitz-Greene Halleck and Joseph Rodman Drake, both\r\npoets and cheerful satirists of New World society; the versatile Nathaniel\r\nParker Willis, writer of twenty volumes of poems, essays, stories and\r\nsketches of travel; and James Kirke Paulding, also a voluminous writer, who\r\nworked with Irving in the _Salmagundi_ essays and whose historical\r\nnovels, such as _The Dutchman's Fireside_ (1831), are still mildly\r\ninteresting. [Footnote: Irving, Cooper and Bryant are sometimes classed\r\namong the Knickerbockers; but the work of these major writers is national\r\nrather than local or sectional, and will be studied later in detail.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUTHERN WRITERS]\r\n\r\nIn the South was another group of young writers, quite as able and\r\nenthusiastic as their northern contemporaries. Among these we note\r\nespecially William Gilmore Simms (1806-1870), whose _Yemassee_,\r\n_Border Beagles_, _Katherine Walton_ and many other historical\r\nromances of Colonial and Revolutionary days were of more than passing\r\ninterest. He was a high-minded and most industrious writer, who produced\r\nover forty volumes of poems, essays, biographies, histories and tales; but\r\nhe is now remembered chiefly by his novels, which won him the title of \"the\r\nCooper of the South.\" At least one of his historical romances should be\r\nread, partly for its own sake and partly for a comparison with Cooper's\r\nwork in the same field. Thus _The Yemassee_ (1835), dealing with\r\nfrontier life and Indian warfare, may be read in connection with Cooper's\r\n_The Deerslayer_ (1841), which has the same general theme; or _The\r\nPartisan_ (1835), dealing with the bitter struggle of southern Whigs and\r\nTories during the Revolution, may well be compared with Cooper's _The\r\nSpy_ (1821), which depicts the same struggle in a northern environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS]\r\n\r\nOther notable writers of the South during this period were Richard Henry\r\nWilde the poet, now remembered by the song (from an unfinished opera)\r\nbeginning, \"My life is like the summer rose\"; William Wirt, the essayist\r\nand biographer; and John Pendleton Kennedy, writer of essays and stories\r\nwhich contain many charming pictures of social life in Virginia and\r\nMaryland in the days \"before the war.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEW ENGLAND AND THE WEST]\r\n\r\nIn New England was still another group, who fortunately avoided the name of\r\nany school. Sparks, Prescott, Ticknor, Story, Dana,--the very names\r\nindicate how true was Boston to her old scholarly traditions. Meanwhile\r\nConnecticut had its popular poet in James Gates Percival; Maine had its\r\nversatile John Neal; and all the northern states were reading the \"goody\r\ngoody\" books of Peter Parley (Samuel Goodrich), the somewhat Byronic\r\n_Zophiel_ and other emotional poems of Maria Gowen Brooks (whom\r\nSouthey called \"Maria del Occidente\"), and the historical romances of\r\nCatherine Sedgwick and Sarah Morton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN PENDLETON KENNEDY]\r\n\r\nThe West also (everything beyond the Alleghenies was then the West) made\r\nits voice heard in the new literature. Timothy Flint wrote a very\r\ninteresting _Journal_ from his missionary experiences, and a highly\r\ncolored romance from his expansive imagination; and James Hall drew some\r\nvigorous and sympathetic pictures of frontier life in _Letters from the\r\nWest_, _Tales of the Border_ and _Wilderness and Warpath_.\r\n\r\nThere are many other writers who won recognition before 1840, but those we\r\nhave named are more than enough; for each name is an invitation, and\r\ninvitations when numerous are simply bothersome. For example, the name of\r\nCatherine Sedgwick invites us to read _Hope Leslie_ and _The\r\nLinwoods_, both excellent in their day, and still interesting as\r\nexamples of the novels that won fame less than a century ago; or the name\r\nof Kennedy leads us to _Swallow Barn_ (alluring title!) with its\r\nbright pictures of Virginia life, and to _Horseshoe Robinson_, a crude\r\nbut stirring tale of Revolutionary heroism. The point in naming these minor\r\nwriters, once as popular as any present-day favorite, is simply this: that\r\nthe major authors, whom we ordinarily study as typical of the age, were not\r\nisolated figures but part of a great romantic movement in literature; that\r\nthey were influenced on the one hand by European letters, and on the other\r\nby a host of native writers who were all intent on reflecting the expanding\r\nlife of America in the early part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON IRVING (1783-1859)\r\n\r\nA very pleasant writer is Irving, a man of romantic and somewhat\r\nsentimental disposition, but sound of motive, careful of workmanship,\r\ninvincibly cheerful of spirit. The genial quality of his work may be due to\r\nthe fact that from joyous boyhood to serene old age he did very much as he\r\npleased, that he lived in what seemed to him an excellent world and wrote\r\nwith no other purpose than to make it happy. In summarizing his career an\r\nadmirer of Irving is reminded of what the Book of Proverbs says of wisdom:\r\n\"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAN AND HIS TIMES]\r\n\r\nThe historian sees another side of Irving's work. Should it be asked, \"What\r\ndid he do that had not been as well or better done before him?\" the first\r\nanswer is that the importance of any man's work must be measured by the age\r\nin which he did it. A schoolboy now knows more about electricity than ever\r\nFranklin learned; but that does not detract from our wonder at Franklin's\r\nkite. So the work of Irving seems impressive when viewed against the gray\r\nliterary dawn of a century ago. At that time America had done a mighty work\r\nfor the world politically, but had added little of value to the world's\r\nliterature. She read and treasured the best books; but she made no\r\ncontribution to their number, and her literary impotence galled her\r\nsensitive spirit. As if to make up for her failure, the writers of the\r\nKnickerbocker, Charleston and other \"schools\" praised each other's work\r\nextravagantly; but no responsive echo came from overseas, where England's\r\nterse criticism of our literary effort was expressed in the scornful\r\nquestion, \"Who reads an American book?\"\r\n\r\nIrving answered that question effectively when his _Sketch Book_,\r\n_Bracebridge Hall_ and _Tales of a Traveller_ found a multitude\r\nof delighted readers on both sides of the Atlantic. His graceful style was\r\nhardly rivaled by any other writer of the period; and England, at a time\r\nwhen Scott and Byron were playing heroic parts, welcomed him heartily to a\r\nplace on the literary stage. Thus he united the English and the American\r\nreader in a common interest and, as it were, charmed away the sneer from\r\none face, the resentment from the other. He has been called \"father of our\r\nAmerican letters\" for two reasons: because he was the first to win a\r\nlasting literary reputation at home and abroad, and because of the\r\nformative influence which his graceful style and artistic purpose have ever\r\nsince exerted upon our prose writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON IRVING]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Two personal characteristics appear constantly in Irving's\r\n    work: the first, that he was always a dreamer, a romance seeker;\r\n    the second, that he was inclined to close his eyes to the heroic\r\n    present and open them wide to the glories, real or imaginary, of\r\n    the remote past. Though he lived in an American city in a day of\r\n    mighty changes and discoveries, he was far less interested in the\r\n    modern New York than in the ancient New Amsterdam; and though he\r\n    was in Europe at the time of the Napoleonic wars, he apparently saw\r\n    nothing of them, being then wholly absorbed in the battles of the\r\n    long-vanished Moors. Only once, in his books of western\r\n    exploration, did he seriously touch the vigorous life of his own\r\n    times; and critics regard these books as the least important of all\r\n    his works.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: BOYHOOD]\r\n\r\n    He was born in New York (1783) when the present colossal city was a\r\n    provincial town that retained many of its quaint Dutch\r\n    characteristics. Over all the straggling town, from the sunny\r\n    Battery with its white-winged ships to the Harlem woods where was\r\n    good squirrel shooting, Irving rambled at ease on many a day when\r\n    the neighbors said he ought to have been at his books. He was the\r\n    youngest of the family; his constitution was not rugged, and his\r\n    gentle mother was indulgent. She would smile when he told of\r\n    reading a smuggled copy of the _Arabian Nights_ in school,\r\n    instead of his geography; she was silent when he slipped away from\r\n    family prayers to climb out of his bedroom window and go to the\r\n    theater, while his sterner father thought of him as sound asleep in\r\n    his bed.\r\n\r\n    Little harm came from these escapades, for Irving was a merry lad\r\n    with no meanness in him; but his schooling was sadly neglected. His\r\n    brothers had graduated from Columbia; but on the plea of delicate\r\n    health he abandoned the idea of college, with a sigh in which there\r\n    was perhaps as much satisfaction as regret. At sixteen he entered a\r\n    law office, where he gave less time to studying Blackstone than to\r\n    reading novels and writing skits for the newspapers.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FINDING HIMSELF]\r\n\r\n    This happy indifference to work and learning, this disposition to\r\n    linger on the sunny side of the street, went with Irving through\r\n    life. Experimentally he joined his brothers, who were in the\r\n    hardware trade; but when he seemed to be in danger of consumption\r\n    they sent him to Europe, where he enjoyed himself greatly, and\r\n    whence he returned perfectly well. Next he was sent on business to\r\n    England; and there, when the Irving Brothers failed, their business\r\n    having been ruined by the War of 1812, Irving manfully resolved to\r\n    be no longer a burden on others and turned to literature for his\r\n    support. With characteristic love of doing what he liked he refused\r\n    a good editorial position (which Walter Scott obtained for him) and\r\n    busied himself with his _Sketch Book_ (1820). This met with a\r\n    generous welcome in England and America, and it was followed by the\r\n    equally popular _Bracebridge Hall_ and _Tales of a\r\n    Traveller_. By these three works Irving was assured not only of\r\n    literary fame but, what was to him of more consequence, of his\r\n    ability to earn his living.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LIFE ABROAD]\r\n\r\n    Next we find him in Spain, whither he went with the purpose of\r\n    translating Navarrete's _Voyages of Columbus_, a Spanish book,\r\n    in which he saw a chance of profit from his countrymen's interest\r\n    in the man who discovered America. Instead of translating another\r\n    man's work, however, he wrote his own _Life and Times of\r\n    Columbus_ (1828). The financial success of this book (which is\r\n    still our most popular biography of the great explorer) enabled\r\n    Irving to live comfortably in Spain, where he read diligently and\r\n    accumulated the material for his later works on Spanish history.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"SUNNYSIDE,\" HOME OF IRVING]\r\n\r\n    By this time Irving's growing literary fame had attracted the\r\n    notice of American politicians, who rewarded him with an\r\n    appointment as secretary of the legation at London. This pleasant\r\n    office he held for two years, but was less interested in it than in\r\n    the reception which English men of letters generously offered him.\r\n    Then he apparently grew homesick, after an absence of seventeen\r\n    years, and returned to his native land, where he was received with\r\n    the honor due to a man who had silenced the galling question, \"Who\r\n    reads an American book?\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS MELLOW AUTUMN]\r\n\r\n    The rest of Irving's long life was a continued triumph. Amazed at\r\n    first, and then a little stunned by the growth, the hurry, the\r\n    onward surge of his country, he settled back into the restful past,\r\n    and was heard with the more pleasure by his countrymen because he\r\n    seemed to speak to them from a vanished age. Once, inspired by the\r\n    tide of life weeping into the West, he journeyed beyond the\r\n    Mississippi and found material for his pioneering books; but an\r\n    active life was far from his taste, and presently he built his\r\n    house \"Sunnyside\" (appropriate name) at Tarrytown on the Hudson.\r\n    There he spent the remainder of his days, with the exception of\r\n    four years in which he served the nation as ambassador to Spain.\r\n    This honor, urged upon him by Webster and President Tyler, was\r\n    accepted with characteristic modesty not as a personal reward but\r\n    as a tribute which America had been wont to offer to the profession\r\n    of letters.\r\n\r\nCHIEF WORKS OF IRVING. A good way to form a general impression of Irving's\r\nworks is to arrange them chronologically in five main groups. The first,\r\nconsisting of the _Salmagundi_ essays, the _Knickerbocker\r\nHistory_ and a few other trifles, we may call the Oldstyle group, after\r\nthe pseudonym assumed by the author. [Footnote: Ever since Revolutionary\r\ndays it had been the fashion for young American writers to use an assumed\r\nname. Irving appeared at different times as \"Jonathan Oldstyle,\" \"Diedrich\r\nKnickerbocker\" and \"Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\"] The second or Sketch-Book\r\ngroup includes the _Sketch Book_, _Bracebridge Hall_ and _Tales\r\nof a Traveller_. The third or Alhambra group, devoted to Spanish and\r\nMoorish themes, includes _The Conquest of Granada_, _Spanish Voyages\r\nof Discovery_, _The Alhambra_ and certain similar works of a later\r\nperiod, such as _Moorish Chronicles_ and _Legends of the Conquest of\r\nSpain_. The fourth or Western group contains _A Tour on the\r\nPrairies_, _Astoria_ and _Adventures of Captain Bonneville_.\r\nThe fifth or Sunnyside group is made up chiefly of biographies, _Oliver\r\nGoldsmith_, _Mahomet and his Successors_ and _The Life of\r\nWashington_. Besides these are some essays and stories assembled under\r\nthe titles of _Spanish Papers_ and _Wolfert's Roost_.\r\n\r\nThe _Salmagundi_ papers and others of the Oldstyle group would have\r\nbeen forgotten long ago if anybody else had written them. In other words,\r\nour interest in them is due not to their intrinsic value (for they are all\r\n\"small potatoes\") but to the fact that their author became a famous\r\nliterary man. Most candid readers would probably apply this criticism also\r\nto the _Knickerbocker History_, had not that grotesque joke won an\r\nundeserved reputation as a work of humor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KNICKERBOCKER HISTORY]\r\n\r\nThe story of the Knickerbocker fabrication illustrates the happy-go-lucky\r\nmethod of all Irving's earlier work. He had tired of his _Salmagundi_\r\nfooling and was looking for variety when his eyes lighted on Dr. Mitchill's\r\n_Picture of New York_, a grandiloquent work written by a prominent\r\nmember of the Historical Society. In a light-headed moment Irving and his\r\nbrother Peter resolved to burlesque this history and, in the approved\r\nfashion of that day, to begin with the foundation of the world. Then Peter\r\nwent to Europe on more important business, and Irving went on with his joke\r\nalone. He professed to have discovered the notes of a learned Dutch\r\nantiquarian who had recently disappeared, leaving a mass of manuscript and\r\nan unpaid board-bill behind him. After advertising in the newspapers for\r\nthe missing man, Irving served notice on the public that the profound value\r\nof Knickerbocker's papers justified their publication, and that the\r\nproceeds of the book would be devoted to paying the board-bill. Then\r\nappeared, in time to satisfy the aroused curiosity of the Historical\r\nSociety, to whom the book was solemnly dedicated, the _History of New\r\nYork from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by\r\nDiedrich Knickerbocker_ (1809).\r\n\r\nThis literary hoax made an instant sensation; it was denounced for its\r\nscandalous irreverence by the members of the Historical Society, especially\r\nby those who had Dutch ancestors, but was received with roars of laughter\r\nby the rest of the population. Those who read it now (from curiosity, for\r\nits merriment has long since departed, leaving it dull as any\r\nthrice-repeated joke) are advised to skip the first two books, which are\r\nvery tedious fooling, and to be content with an abridged version of the\r\nstories of Wouter van Twiller, William the Testy and Peter the Headstrong.\r\nThese are the names of real Dutch governors of New Amsterdam, and the dates\r\ngiven are exact dates; but there history ends and burlesque begins. The\r\ncombination of fact and nonsense and the strain of gravity in which\r\nabsurdities are related have led some critics to place the _Knickerbocker\r\nHistory_ first in time of the notable works of so-called American humor.\r\nThat is doubtless a fair classification; but other critics assert that real\r\nhumor is as purely human as a smile or a tear, and has therefore no\r\nnational or racial limitations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SKETCH BOOK]\r\n\r\nThe _Sketch Book_, chief of the second group of writings, is perhaps\r\nthe best single work that Irving produced. We shall read it with better\r\nunderstanding if we remember that it was the work of a young man who,\r\nhaving always done as he pleased, proceeds now to write of whatever\r\npleasant matter is close at hand. Being in England at the time, he\r\nnaturally finds most of his material there; and being youthful, romantic\r\nand sentimental, he colors everything with the hue of his own disposition.\r\nHe begins by chatting of the journey and of the wide sea that separates him\r\nfrom home. He records his impressions of the beautiful English country,\r\ntells what he saw or felt during his visit to Stratford on Avon, and what\r\nhe dreamed in Westminster Abbey, a place hallowed by centuries of worship\r\nand humanized by the presence of the great dead. He sheds a ready tear over\r\na rural funeral, and tries to make us cry over the sorrows of a poor widow;\r\nthen to relieve our feelings he pokes a bit of fun at John Bull. Something\r\ncalls his attention to Isaac Walton, and he writes a Waltonian kind of\r\nsketch about a fisherman. In one chapter he comments on contemporary\r\nliterature; then, as if not quite satisfied with what authors are doing, he\r\nlays aside his record of present impressions, goes back in thought to his\r\nhome by the Hudson, and produces two stories of such humor, charm and\r\noriginality that they make the rest of the book appear almost commonplace,\r\nas the careless sketches of a painter are forgotten in presence of his\r\ninspired masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThese two stories, the most pleasing that Irving ever wrote, are \"Rip van\r\nWinkle\" and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\" They should be read if one reads\r\nnothing else of the author's twenty volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIP VAN WINKLE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPANISH THEMES]\r\n\r\nThe works on Spanish themes appeal in different ways to different readers.\r\nOne who knows his history will complain (and justly) that Irving is\r\nsuperficial, that he is concerned with picturesque rather than with\r\nimportant incidents; but one who likes the romance of history, and who\r\nreflects that romance plays an important part in the life of any people,\r\nwill find the legends and chronicles of this Spanish group as interesting\r\nas fiction. We should remember, moreover, that in Irving's day the romance\r\nof old Spain, familiar enough to European readers, was to most Americans\r\nstill fresh and wondrous. In emphasizing the romantic or picturesque side\r\nof his subject he not only pleased his readers but broadened their horizon;\r\nhe also influenced a whole generation of historians who, in contrast with\r\nthe scientific or prosaic historians of to-day, did not hesitate to add the\r\nelement of human interest to their narratives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ALHAMBRA]\r\n\r\nThe most widely read of all the works of the Spanish group is _The\r\nAlhambra_ (1832). This is, on the surface, a collection of\r\nsemihistorical essays and tales clustering around the ancient palace, in\r\nGranada, which was the last stronghold of the Moors in Europe; in reality\r\nit is a record of the impressions and dreams of a man who, finding himself\r\non historic ground, gives free rein to his imagination. At times, indeed,\r\nhe seems to have his eye on his American readers, who were then in a\r\nromantic mood, rather than on the place or people he was describing. The\r\nbook delighted its first critics, who called it \"the Spanish Sketch Book\";\r\nbut though pleasant enough as a romantic dream of history, it hardly\r\ncompares in originality with its famous predecessor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WESTERN STORIES]\r\n\r\nExcept to those who like a brave tale of exploration, and who happily have\r\nno academic interest in style, Irving's western books are of little\r\nconsequence. In fact, they are often omitted from the list of his important\r\nworks, though they have more adventurous interest than all the others\r\ncombined. _A Tour on the Prairies_, which records a journey beyond the\r\nMississippi in the days when buffalo were the explorers' mainstay, is the\r\nbest written of the pioneer books; but the _Adventures of Captain\r\nBonneville_, a story of wandering up and down the great West with plenty\r\nof adventures among Indians and \"free trappers,\" furnishes the most\r\nexcitement. Unfortunately this journal, which vies in interest with\r\nParkman's _Oregon Trail_, cannot be credited to Irving, though it\r\nbears his name on the title-page. [Footnote: The _Adventures_ is\r\nchiefly the work of a Frenchman, a daring free-rover, who probably tried in\r\nvain to get his work published. Irving bought the work for a thousand\r\ndollars, revised it slightly, gave it his name and sold it for seven or\r\neight times what he paid for it. In _Astoria_, the third book of the\r\nwestern group, he sold his services to write up the records of the fur\r\nhouse established by John Jacob Astor, and made a poor job of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD DUTCH CHURCH, SLEEPY HOLLOW\r\nMentioned by Irving in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIOGRAPHIES]\r\n\r\nOf the three biographies _Oliver Goldsmith_ (1849) is the best,\r\nprobably because Irving had more sympathy and affinity with the author of\r\n\"The Deserted Village\" than with Mahomet or Washington. The _Life of\r\nWashington_ (1855-1859) was plainly too large an undertaking for\r\nIrving's limited powers; but here again we must judge the work by the\r\nstandards of its own age and admit that it is vastly better than the\r\npopular but fictitious biographies of Washington written by Weems and other\r\nromancers. Even in Irving's day Washington was still regarded as a demigod;\r\nhis name was always printed in capitals; and the rash novelist who dared to\r\nbring him into a story (as Cooper did in _The Spy_) was denounced for\r\nhis lack of reverence. In consequence of this false attitude practically\r\nall Washington's biographers (with the exception of the judicious Marshall)\r\ndepicted him as a ponderously dignified creature, stilted, unlovely,\r\nunhuman, who must always appear with a halo around his head. Irving was too\r\nmuch influenced by this absurd fashion and by his lack of scholarship to\r\nmake a trustworthy book; but he gave at least a touch of naturalness and\r\nhumanity to our first president, and set a new biographical standard by\r\nattempting to write as an honest historian rather than as a mere\r\nhero-worshiper.\r\n\r\nAN APPRECIATION OF IRVING. The three volumes of the Sketch-Book group and\r\nthe romantic _Alhambra_ furnish an excellent measure of Irving's\r\nliterary talent. At first glance these books appear rather superficial,\r\ndealing with pleasant matters of no consequence; but on second thought\r\npleasant matters are always of consequence, and Irving invariably displays\r\ntwo qualities, humor and sentiment, in which humanity is forever\r\ninterested. His humor, at first crude and sometimes in doubtful taste (as\r\nin his _Knickerbocker History_) grew more refined, more winning in his\r\nlater works, until a thoughtful critic might welcome it, with its kindness,\r\nits culture, its smile in which is no cynicism and no bitterness, as a true\r\nexample of \"American\" humor,--if indeed such a specialized product ever\r\nexisted. His sentiment was for the most part tender, sincere and manly.\r\nThough it now seems somewhat exaggerated and at times dangerously near to\r\nsentimentality, that may not be altogether a fault; for the same criticism\r\napplies to Longfellow, Dickens and, indeed, to most other writers who have\r\nwon an immense audience by frankly emphasizing, or even exaggerating, the\r\nhonest sentiments that plain men and women have always cherished both in\r\nlife and in literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STYLE OF IRVING]\r\n\r\nThe style of Irving, with its suggestion of Goldsmith and Addison (who were\r\nhis first masters), is deserving of more unstinted praise. A \"charming\"\r\nstyle we call it; and the word, though indefinite, is expressive of the\r\nsatisfaction which Irving's manner affords his readers. One who seeks the\r\nsource of his charm may find it in this, that he cherished a high opinion\r\nof humanity, and that the friendliness, the sense of comradeship, which he\r\nfelt for his fellow men was reflected in his writing; unconsciously at\r\nfirst, perhaps, and then deliberately, by practice and cultivation. In\r\nconsequence, we do not read Irving critically but sympathetically; for\r\nreaders are like children, or animals, in that they are instinctively drawn\r\nto an author who trusts and understands them.\r\n\r\nThackeray, who gave cordial welcome to Irving, and who called him \"the\r\nfirst ambassador whom the New World of letters sent to the Old,\" was deeply\r\nimpressed by the fact not that the young American had an excellent prose\r\nstyle but that \"his gate was forever swinging to visitors.\" That is an\r\nilluminating criticism; for we can understand the feeling of the men and\r\nwomen of a century ago who, having read the _Sketch Book_, were eager\r\nto meet the man who had given them pleasure by writing it. In brief, though\r\nIrving wrote nothing of great import, though he entered not into the stress\r\nof life or scaled its heights or sounded its deeps, we still read him for\r\nthe sufficient but uncritical reason that we like him.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, of winning our personal allegiance, Irving stands in\r\nmarked contrast to his greatest American contemporary, Cooper. We read the\r\none because we are attracted to the man, the other for the tale he has to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT (1794-1878)\r\n\r\nBryant has been called \"the father of American song,\" and the year 1821,\r\nwhen his first volume appeared, is recorded as the natal year of American\r\npoetry. Many earlier singers had won local reputations, but he was the\r\nfirst who was honored in all the states and who attained by his poetry\r\nalone a dominating place in American letters.\r\n\r\nThat was long ago; and times have changed, and poets with them. In any\r\ncollection of recent American verse one may find poems more imaginative or\r\nmore finely wrought than any that Bryant produced; but these later singers\r\nstand in a company and contribute to an already large collection, while\r\nBryant stood alone and made a brave beginning of poetry that we may\r\nhonestly call native and national. Before he won recognition by his\r\nindependent work the best that our American singers thought they could do\r\nwas to copy some English original; but after 1821 they dared to be\r\nthemselves in poetry, as they had ever been in politics. They had the\r\nsuccessful Bryant for a model, and the young Longfellow was one of his\r\npupils. Moreover, he stands the hard test of time, and seems to have no\r\nsuccessor. He is still our Puritan poet,--a little severe, perhaps, but\r\nAmerican to the core,--who reflects better than any other the rugged spirit\r\nof that puritanism which had so profoundly influenced our country during\r\nthe early, formative days of the republic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT]\r\n\r\n    LIFE. In the boyhood of Bryant we shall find the inspiration for\r\n    all his enduring work. He was of Pilgrim stock, and was born (1794)\r\n    in the little village of Cummington, in western Massachusetts.\r\n    There, with the Berkshire Hills and the ancient forest forever in\r\n    sight, he grew to man's stature, working on the farm or attending\r\n    the district school by day, and reading before the open fire at\r\n    night. His father was a physician, a scholarly man who directed his\r\n    son's reading. His mother was a Puritan, one of those quiet,\r\n    inspiring women who do their work cheerfully, as by God's grace,\r\n    and who invariably add some sign or patent of nobility to their\r\n    sons and daughters. There was also in the home a Puritan\r\n    grandfather who led the family devotions every evening, and whose\r\n    prayers with their rich phraseology of psalm or prophecy were\r\n    \"poems from beginning to end.\" So said Bryant, who attributed to\r\n    these prayers his earliest impulse to write poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Between these two influences, nature without and puritanism within,\r\n    the poet grew up; in their shadow he lived and died; little else of\r\n    consequence is reflected in the poems that are his best memorial.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE CITIZEN]\r\n\r\n    The visible life of Bryant lies almost entirely outside the realm\r\n    of poesie. He as fitted for Williams by country ministers, as was\r\n    customary in that day; but poverty compelled him to leave college\r\n    after two brief terms. Then he studied law, and for nine or ten\r\n    years practiced his profession doggedly, unwillingly, with many a\r\n    protest at the chicanery he was forced to witness even in the\r\n    sacred courts of justice. Grown weary of it at last, he went to New\r\n    York, found work in a newspaper office, and after a few years'\r\n    apprenticeship became editor of _The Evening Post_, a position\r\n    which he held for more than half a century. His worldly affairs\r\n    prospered; he became a \"leading citizen\" of New York, prominent in\r\n    the social and literary affairs of a great city; he varied the\r\n    routine of editorship by trips abroad, by literary or patriotic\r\n    addresses, by cultivating a country estate at Long Island. In his\r\n    later years, as a literary celebrity, he loaned his name rather too\r\n    freely to popular histories, anthologies and gift books, which\r\n    better serve their catchpenny purpose if some famous man can be\r\n    induced to add \"tone\" to the rubbish.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE POET]\r\n\r\n    And Bryant's poetry? Ah, that was a thing forever apart from his\r\n    daily life, an almost sacred thing, to be cherished in moments\r\n    when, his day's work done, he was free to follow his spirit and\r\n    give outlet to the feelings which, as a strong man and a Puritan,\r\n    he was wont to restrain. He had begun to write poetry in childhood,\r\n    when his father had taught him the value of brevity or compression\r\n    and \"the difference between poetic enthusiasm and fustian.\"\r\n    Therefore he wrote slowly, carefully, and allowed ample time for\r\n    change of thought or diction. So his early \"Thanatopsis\" was hidden\r\n    away for years till his father found and published it, and made\r\n    Bryant famous in a day. All this at a time when English critics\r\n    were exalting \"sudden inspiration,\" \"sustained effort\" and poems\r\n    \"done at one sitting.\"\r\n\r\n    Once Bryant had found himself (and the blank verse and simple\r\n    four-line stanza which suited his talent) he seldom changed, and he\r\n    never improved. His first little volume, _Poems_ (1821),\r\n    contains some of his best work. In the next fifty years he added to\r\n    the size but not to the quality of that volume; and there is little\r\n    to indicate in such poems as \"Thanatopsis\" and \"The Flood of Years\"\r\n    that the one was written by a boy of seventeen and the other by a\r\n    sage of eighty. His love of poetry as a thing apart from life is\r\n    indicated by the fact that in old age, to forget the grief\r\n    occasioned by the death of his wife, he gave the greater part of\r\n    six years to a metrical translation of the Greek poet Homer. That\r\n    he never became a great poet or even fulfilled his early promise is\r\n    due partly to his natural limitations, no doubt, but more largely\r\n    to the fact that he gave his time and strength to other things. And\r\n    a poet is like other men in that he cannot well serve two masters.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF BRYANT. Besides the translation of the _Iliad_ and the\r\n_Odyssey_ there are several volumes of prose to Bryant's credit, but\r\nhis fame now rests wholly on a single book of original poems. The best of\r\nthese (the result of fifty years of writing, which could easily be printed\r\non fifty pages) may be grouped in two main classes, poems of death and\r\npoems of nature; outside of which are a few miscellaneous pieces, such as\r\n\"The Antiquity of Freedom,\" \"Planting of the Apple Tree\" and \"The Poet,\" in\r\nwhich he departs a little from his favorite themes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POEMS OF DEATH]\r\n\r\nBryant's poems on death reflect something of his Puritan training and of\r\nhis personal experience while threatened with consumption; they are also\r\nindicative of the poetic fashion of his age, which was abnormally given to\r\nfunereal subjects and greatly influenced by such melancholy poems as Gray's\r\n\"Elegy\" and Young's \"Night Thoughts.\" He began his career with\r\n\"Thanatopsis\" (or \"View of Death\"), a boyhood piece which astonished\r\nAmerica when it was published in 1817, and which has ever since been a\r\nfavorite with readers. The idea of the poem, that the earth is a vast\r\nsepulcher of human life, was borrowed from other poets; but the stately\r\nblank verse and the noble appreciation of nature are Bryant's own. They\r\nmark, moreover, a new era in American poetry, an original era to replace\r\nthe long imitative period which had endured since Colonial times. Other and\r\nperhaps better poems in the same group are \"The Death of the Flowers,\" \"The\r\nReturn of Youth\" and \"Tree Burial,\" in which Bryant goes beyond the pagan\r\nview of death presented in his first work.\r\n\r\nThat death had a strange fascination for Bryant is evident from his\r\nreturning again and again to a subject which most young poets avoid. Its\r\nsomber shadow and unanswered question intrude upon nearly all of his nature\r\npieces; so much so that even his \"June\" portrays that blithe, inspiring\r\nmonth of sunshine and bird song as an excellent time to die. It is from\r\nsuch poems that one gets the curious idea that Bryant never was a boy, that\r\nhe was a graybeard at sixteen and never grew any younger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POEMS OF NATURE]\r\n\r\nIt is in his poems of nature that Bryant is at his best. Even here he is\r\nnever youthful, never the happy singer whose heart overflows to the call of\r\nthe winds; he is rather the priest of nature, who offers a prayer or hymn\r\nof praise at her altar. And it may be that his noble \"Forest Hymn\" is\r\nnearer to a true expression of human feeling, certainly of primitive or\r\nelemental feeling, than Shelley's \"Skylark\" or Burns's \"Mountain Daisy.\"\r\nThoreau in one of his critical epigrams declared it was not important that\r\na poet should say any particular thing, but that he should speak in harmony\r\nwith nature; that \"the tone of his voice is the main thing.\" If that be\r\ntrue, Bryant is one of our best poets. He is always in harmony with nature\r\nin her prevailing quiet mood; his voice is invariably gentle, subdued,\r\nmerging into the murmur of trees or the flow of water,--much like Indian\r\nvoices, but as unlike as possible to the voices of those who go to nature\r\nfor a picnic or a camping excursion.\r\n\r\nAmong the best of his nature poems are \"To a Waterfowl\" (his most perfect\r\nsingle work), \"Forest Hymn,\" \"Hymn to the Sea,\" \"Summer Wind,\" \"Night\r\nJourney of a River,\" \"Autumn Woods,\" \"To a Fringed Gentian,\" \"Among the\r\nTrees,\" \"The Fountain\" and \"A Rain Dream.\" To read such poems is to\r\nunderstand the fact, mentioned in our biography, that Bryant's poetry was a\r\nthing apart from his daily life. His friends all speak of him as a\r\ncompanionable man, receptive, responsive, abounding in cheerful anecdote,\r\nand with a certain \"overflowing of strength\" in mirth or kindly humor; but\r\none finds absolutely nothing of this genial temper in his verse. There he\r\nseems to regard all such bubblings and overflowings as unseemly levity (lo!\r\nthe Puritan), which he must lay aside in poetry as on entering a church. He\r\nis, as we have said, the priest of nature, in whom reverence is uppermost;\r\nand he who reads aloud the \"Forest Hymn,\" with its solemn organ tone, has\r\nan impression that it must be followed by the sublime invitation, \"O come,\r\nlet us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRYANT'S HOME, AT CUMMINGTON]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IN LIGHTER MOOD]\r\n\r\nThough Bryant is always serious, it is worthy of note that he is never\r\ngloomy, that he entirely escapes the pessimism or despair which seizes upon\r\nmost poets in times of trouble. Moreover, he has a lighter mood, not gay\r\nbut serenely happy, which finds expression in such poems as \"Evening Wind,\"\r\n\"Gladness of Nature\" and especially \"Robert of Lincoln.\" The exuberance of\r\nthe last-named, so unlike anything else in Bryant's book of verse, may be\r\nexplained on the assumption that not even a Puritan could pull a long face\r\nin presence of a bobolink. The intense Americanism of the poet appears in\r\nnearly all his verse; and occasionally his patriotism rises to a prophetic\r\nstrain, as in \"The Prairie,\" for example, written when he first saw what\r\nwas then called \"the great American desert.\" It is said that the honeybee\r\ncrossed the Mississippi with the first settlers, and Bryant looks with\r\nkindled imagination on this little pioneer who\r\n\r\n  Fills the savannas with his murmurings,\r\n  And hides his sweets, as in the golden age,\r\n  Within the hollow oak. I listen long\r\n  To his domestic hum, and think I hear\r\n  The sound of that advancing multitude\r\n  Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground\r\n  Comes up the laugh of children, the soft voice\r\n  Of maidens, and the sweet and solemn hymn\r\n  Of Sabbath worshippers. The low of herds\r\n  Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain\r\n  Over the dark brown furrows. All at once\r\n  A fresher wind sweeps by, and breaks my dream,\r\n  And I am in the wilderness alone.\r\n\r\nOUR PIONEER POET. From one point of view our first national poet is a\r\nsummary of all preceding American verse and a prophecy of better things to\r\ncome. To be specific, practically all our early poetry shows the\r\ninclination to moralize, to sing a song and then add a lesson to it. This\r\nis commonly attributed to Puritan influence; but in truth it is a universal\r\npoetic impulse, a tribute to the early office of the bard, who was the\r\ntribal historian and teacher as well as singer. This ancient didactic or\r\nmoralizing tendency is very strong in Bryant. To his first notable poem,\r\n\"Thanatopsis,\" he must add a final \"So live\"; and to his \"Waterfowl\" must\r\nbe appended a verse which tells what steadfast lesson may be learned from\r\nthe mutable phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nAgain, most of our Colonial and Revolutionary poetry was strongly (or\r\nweakly) imitative, and Bryant shows the habit of his American predecessors.\r\nThe spiritual conception of nature revealed in some of his early poems is a\r\nNew World echo of Wordsworth; his somber poems of death indicate that he\r\nwas familiar with Gray and Young; his \"Evening Wind\" has some suggestion of\r\nShelley; we suspect the influence of Scott's narrative poems in the\r\nneglected \"Stella\" and \"Little People of the Snow.\" But though influenced\r\nby English writers, the author of \"Thanatopsis\" was too independent to\r\nimitate them; and in his independence, with the hearty welcome which it\r\nreceived from the American public, we have a prophecy of the new poetry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS ORIGINALITY]\r\n\r\nThe originality and sturdy independence of Bryant are clearly shown in his\r\nchoice of subjects. In his early days poetry was formal and artificial,\r\nafter the manner of the eighteenth century; the romantic movement had\r\nhardly gained recognition in England; Burns was known only to his own\r\ncountrymen; Wordsworth was ridiculed or barely tolerated by the critics;\r\nand poets on both sides of the Atlantic were still writing of larks and\r\nnightingales, of moonlight in the vale, of love in a rose-covered cottage,\r\nof ivy-mantled towers, weeping willows, neglected graves,--a medley of\r\ntears and sentimentality. You will find all these and little else in _The\r\nGarland_, _The Token_ and many other popular collections of the\r\nperiod; but you will find none of them in Bryant's first or last volume.\r\nFrom the beginning he wrote of Death and Nature; somewhat coldly, to be\r\nsure, but with manly sincerity. Then he wrote of Freedom, the watchword of\r\nAmerica, not as other singers had written of it but as a Puritan who had\r\nlearned in bitter conflict the price of his heritage:\r\n\r\n  O Freedom! thou art not, as poets dream,\r\n  A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,\r\n  And wavy tresses gushing from the cap\r\n  With which the Roman master crowned his slave\r\n  When he took off the gyves. A bearded man,\r\n  Armed to the teeth, art thou; one mailéd hand\r\n  Grasps the broad shield, and one the sword; thy brow,\r\n  Glorious in beauty though it be, is scarred\r\n  With tokens of old wars; thy massive limbs\r\n  Are strong with struggling.\r\n\r\nHe wrote without affectation of the Past, of Winter, of the North Star, of\r\nthe Crowded Street, of the Yellow Violet and the Fringed Gentian. If the\r\nlast-named poems now appear too simple for our poetic taste, remember that\r\nsimplicity is the hardest to acquire of all literary virtues, and that it\r\nwas the dominant quality of Bryant. Remember also that these modest flowers\r\nof which he wrote so modestly had for two hundred years brightened our\r\nspring woods and autumn meadows, waiting patiently for the poet who should\r\nspeak our appreciation of their beauty. Another century has gone, and no\r\nother American poet has spoken so simply or so well of other neglected\r\ntreasures: of the twin flower, for example, most fragrant of all blooms; or\r\nof that other welcome-nodding blossom, beloved of bumblebees, which some\r\ncall \"wild columbine\" and others \"whippoorwill's shoes.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, Bryant was and is our pioneer poet in the realm of native\r\nAmerican poetry. As Emerson said, he was our first original poet, and was\r\noriginal because he dared to be sincere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES FENIMORE COOPER (1789-1851)\r\n\r\nIn point of time Cooper is the first notable American novelist. Judging by\r\nthe booksellers, no other has yet approached him in the sustained interest\r\nof his work or the number of his readers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAN]\r\n\r\nOn first analysis we shall find little in Cooper to account for his abiding\r\npopularity. The man himself was not exactly lovable; indeed, he had almost\r\na genius for stirring up antagonism. As a writer he began without study or\r\nliterary training, and was stilted or slovenly in most of his work. He was\r\nprone to moralize in the midst of an exciting narrative; he filled\r\ncountless pages with \"wooden\" dialogue; he could not portray a child or a\r\nwoman or a gentleman, though he was confident that he had often done so to\r\nperfection. He did not even know Indians or woodcraft, though Indians and\r\nwoodcraft account for a large part of our interest in his forest romances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE STORYTELLER]\r\n\r\nOne may enjoy a good story, however, without knowing or caring for its\r\nauthor's peculiarities, and the vast majority of readers are happily not\r\ncritical but receptive. Hence if we separate the man from the author, and\r\nif we read _The Red Rover_ or _The Last of the Mohicans_ \"just\r\nfor the story,\" we shall discover the source of Cooper's power as a writer.\r\nFirst of all, he has a tale to tell, an epic tale of heroism and manly\r\nvirtue. Then he appeals strongly to the pioneer spirit, which survives in\r\nall great nations, and he is a master at portraying wild nature as the\r\nbackground of human life. The vigor of elemental manhood, the call of\r\nadventure, the lure of primeval forests, the surge and mystery of the\r\nsea,--these are written large in Cooper's best books. They make us forget\r\nhis faults of temper or of style, and they account in large measure for his\r\npopularity with young readers of all nations; for he is one of the few\r\nAmerican writers who belong not to any country but to humanity. At present\r\nhe is read chiefly by boys; but half a century or more ago he had more\r\nreaders of all classes and climes than any other writer in the world.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The youthful experiences of Cooper furnished him with the\r\n    material for his best romances. He was born (1789) in New Jersey;\r\n    but while he was yet a child the family removed to central New\r\n    York, where his father had acquired an immense tract of wild land,\r\n    on which he founded the village that is still called Cooperstown.\r\n    There on the frontier of civilization, where stood the primeval\r\n    forest that had witnessed many a wild Indian raid, the novelist\r\n    passed his boyhood amid the picturesque scenes which he was to\r\n    immortalize in _The Pioneers_ and _The Deerslayer_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS TRAINING]\r\n\r\n    Cooper picked up a little \"book learning\" in a backwoods school and\r\n    a little more in a minister's study at Albany. At thirteen he\r\n    entered Yale; but he was a self-willed lad and was presently\r\n    dismissed from college. A little later, after receiving some scant\r\n    nautical training on a merchantman, he entered the navy as\r\n    midshipman; but after a brief experience in the service he married\r\n    and resigned his commission. That was in 1811, and the date is\r\n    significant. It was just before the second war with Great Britain.\r\n    The author who wrote so much and so vividly of battles, Indian\r\n    raids and naval engagements never was within sight of such affairs,\r\n    though the opportunity was present. In his romances we have the\r\n    product of a vigorous imagination rather than of observation or\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JAMES FENIMORE COOPER]\r\n\r\n    His literary work seems now like the result of whim or accident.\r\n    One day he flung down a novel that he was reading, declaring to his\r\n    wife that he could write a better story himself. \"Try it,\"\r\n    challenged his wife. \"I will,\" said Cooper; and the result was\r\n    _Precaution_, a romance of English society. He was then a\r\n    farmer in the Hudson valley, and his knowledge of foreign society\r\n    was picked up, one must think, from silly novels on the subject.\r\n\r\n    Strange to say, the story was so well received that the gratified\r\n    author wrote another. This was _The Spy_ (1821), dealing with\r\n    a Revolutionary hero who had once followed his dangerous calling in\r\n    the very region in which Cooper was now living. The immense success\r\n    of this book fairly drove its author into a career. He moved to New\r\n    York City, and there quickly produced two more successful romances.\r\n    Thus in four years an unknown man without literary training had\r\n    become a famous writer, and had moreover produced four different\r\n    types of fiction: the novel of society in _Precaution_, the\r\n    historical romance in _The Spy_, and the adventurous romance\r\n    of forest and of ocean in _The Pioneers_ and _The Pilot_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: YEARS OF STRIFE]\r\n\r\n    Cooper now went abroad, as most famous authors do. His books,\r\n    already translated into several European languages, had made him\r\n    known, and he was welcomed in literary circles; but almost\r\n    immediately he was drawn into squabbles, being naturally inclined\r\n    that way. He began to write political tirades; and even his\r\n    romances of the period (_The Bravo_, _The Heidenmauer_,\r\n    _The Headsman_) were devoted to proclaiming the glories of\r\n    democracy. Then he returned home and proceeded to set his\r\n    countrymen by the ears (in such books as _Home as Found_) by\r\n    writing too frankly of their crudity in contrast with the culture\r\n    of Europe. Then followed long years of controversy and lawsuits,\r\n    during which our newspapers used Cooper scandalously, and Cooper\r\n    prosecuted and fined the newspapers. It is a sorry spectacle, of no\r\n    interest except to those who would understand the bulk of Cooper's\r\n    neglected works. He was an honest man, vigorous, straightforward,\r\n    absolutely sincere; but he was prone to waste his strength and\r\n    embitter his temper by trying to force his opinion on those who\r\n    were well satisfied with their own. He had no humor, and had never\r\n    pondered the wisdom of \"Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OTSEGO HALL, HOME OF COOPER]\r\n\r\n    The last years of his life were spent mostly at the old home at\r\n    Cooperstown, no longer a frontier settlement but a thriving\r\n    village, from which Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook had long since\r\n    departed. Before his death (1851) the fires of controversy had sunk\r\n    to ashes; but Cooper never got over his resentment at the public,\r\n    and with the idea of keeping forever aloof he commanded that none\r\n    of his private papers be given to biographers. It is for lack of\r\n    such personal letters and documents that no adequate life of Cooper\r\n    has yet been written.\r\n\r\nCOOPER'S WORKS. There are over sixty volumes of Cooper, but to read them\r\nall would savor of penance rather than of pleasure. Of his miscellaneous\r\nwritings only the _History of the Navy_ and _Lives of Distinguished\r\nNaval Officers_ are worthy of remembrance. Of his thirty-two romances\r\nthe half, at least, may be ignored; though critics may differ as to whether\r\ncertain books (_The Bravo_ and _Lionel Lincoln_, for example)\r\nshould be placed in one half or the other. There remain as the measure of\r\nCooper's genius some sixteen works of fiction, which fall naturally into\r\nthree groups: the historical novels, the tales of pioneer life, and the\r\nromances of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SPY]\r\n\r\n_The Spy_ was the first and probably the best of Cooper's historical\r\nromances. Even his admirers must confess that it is crudely written, and\r\nthat our patriotic interest inclines us to overestimate a story which\r\nthrows the glamor of romance over the Revolution. Yet this faulty tale\r\nattempts to do what very few histories have ever done fairly, namely, to\r\npresent both sides or parties of the fateful conflict; and its unusual\r\nsuccess in this difficult field may be explained by a bit of family\r\nhistory. Cooper was by birth and training a stanch Whig, or Patriot; but\r\nhis wife, to whom he was devotedly attached, was the daughter of an\r\nunbending Tory, or Loyalist; and his divided allegiance is plainly apparent\r\nin his work. Ordinarily his personal antagonisms, his hatred of \"Yankees,\"\r\nPuritans and all politicians of the other party, are dragged into his\r\nstories and spoil some of them; but in _The Spy_ he puts his\r\nprejudices under restraint, tells his tale in an impersonal way, dealing\r\nhonestly with both Whigs and Tories, and so produces a work having the\r\ndouble interest of a good adventure story and a fair picture of one of the\r\nheroic ages of American history.\r\n\r\nAside from its peculiar American interest, _The Spy_ has some original\r\nand broadly human elements which have caused it, notwithstanding its\r\ndreary, artificial style, to be highly appreciated in other countries, in\r\nSouth American countries especially. The secret of its appeal lies largely\r\nin this, that in Harvey Birch, a brave man who serves his country without\r\nhope or possibility of reward, Cooper has strongly portrayed a type of the\r\nhighest, the most unselfish patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe other historical novels differ greatly in value. Prominent among them\r\nare _Mercedes of Castile_, dealing with Columbus and the discovery of\r\nAmerica; _Satanstoe_ and _The Wept of Wish-Ton-Wish_, depicting\r\nColonial life in New York and New England respectively; and _Lionel\r\nLincoln_, which is another story of the Revolution, more labored than\r\n_The Spy_ and of less sustained interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SEA STORIES]\r\n\r\nCooper's first sea story, _The Pilot_ (1823), was haphazard enough in\r\nboth motive and method, [Footnote: The Waverley novels by \"the great\r\nunknown\" were appearing at this time. Scott was supposed to be the author\r\nof them, but there was much debate on the subject. One day in New York a\r\nmember of Cooper's club argued that Scott could not possibly have written\r\n_The Pirate_ (which had just appeared), because the nautical skill\r\ndisplayed in the book was such as only a sailor could possess. Cooper\r\nmaintained, on the contrary, that _The Pirate_ was the work of a\r\nlandsman; and to prove it he declared that he would write a sea story as it\r\nshould be written; that is, with understanding as well as with imagination.\r\n_The Pilot_ was the result.] but it gave pleasure to a multitude of\r\nreaders, and it amazed critics by showing that the lonely sea could be a\r\nplace of romantic human interest. Cooper was thus the first modern novelist\r\nof the ocean; and to his influence we are partly indebted for the stirring\r\ntales of such writers as Herman Melville and Clark Russell. A part of the\r\naction of _The Pilot_ takes place on land (the style and the\r\ncharacters of this part are wretchedly stilted), but the chief interest of\r\nthe story lies in the adventures of an American privateer commanded by a\r\ndisguised hero, who turns out to be John Paul Jones. Cooper could not\r\nportray such a character, and his effort to make the dashing young captain\r\nheroic by surrounding him with a fog of mystery is like his labored attempt\r\nto portray the character of Washington in _The Spy_. On the other\r\nhand, he was thoroughly at home on a ship or among common sailors; his sea\r\npictures of gallant craft driven before the gale are magnificent; and Long\r\nTom Coffin is perhaps the most realistic and interesting of all his\r\ncharacters, not excepting even Leatherstocking.\r\n\r\nAnother and better romance of the sea is _The Red Rover_ (1828). In\r\nthis story the action takes place almost wholly on the deep, and its vivid\r\nword pictures of an ocean smiling under the sunrise or lashed to fury by\r\nmidnight gales are unrivaled in any literature. Other notable books of the\r\nsame group are _The Water Witch_, _Afloat and Ashore_ and _Wing\r\nand Wing_. Some readers will prize these for their stories; but to\r\nothers they may appear tame in comparison with the superb descriptive\r\npassages of _The Red Rover_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEATHERSTOCKING TALES]\r\n\r\nWhen Cooper published _The Pioneers_ (1823) he probably had no\r\nintention of writing a series of novels recounting the adventures of Natty\r\nBumppo, or Leatherstocking, and his Indian friend Chingachgook; otherwise\r\nhe would hardly have painted so shabby a picture of these two old heroes,\r\nneglected and despised in a land through which they had once moved as\r\nmasters. Readers were quick to see, however, that these old men had an\r\nadventurous past, and when they demanded the rest of the story Cooper wrote\r\nfour other romances, which are as so many acts in the stirring drama of\r\npioneer life. When these romances are read, therefore, they should be taken\r\nin logical sequence, beginning with _The Deerslayer_, which portrays\r\nthe two heroes as young men on their first war trail, and following in\r\norder with _The Last of the Mohicans_, _The Pathfinder_, _The\r\nPioneers_ and _The Prairie_. If one is to be omitted, let it be\r\n_The Pathfinder_, which is comparatively weak and dull; and if only\r\none is to be read, _The Last of the Mohicans_ is an excellent choice.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a century of novel writing, these five books remain our most\r\npopular romances of pioneer days, and Leatherstocking is still a wingéd\r\nname, a name to conjure with, in most civilized countries. Meanwhile a\r\nthousand similar works have come and gone and been forgotten. To examine\r\nthese later books, which attempt to satisfy the juvenile love of Indian\r\nstories, is to discover that they are modeled more or less closely on the\r\noriginal work of the first American novelist.\r\n\r\nCOOPER'S SCENES AND CHARACTERS. Even in his outdoor romances Cooper was\r\nforever attempting to depict human society, especially polite society; but\r\nthat was the one subject he did not and could not understand. The sea in\r\nits grandeur and loneliness; the wild lakes, stretching away to misty,\r\nunknown shores or nestling like jewels in their evergreen setting; the\r\nforest with its dim trails, its subdued light, its rustlings, whisperings,\r\nhints of mystery or peril,--these are his proper scenes, and in them he\r\nmoves as if at ease in his environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOPER'S CAVE\r\nScene of Indian fight in _The Last of the Mohicans_]\r\n\r\nIn his characters we soon discover the same contrast. If he paints a hero\r\nof history, he must put him on stilts to increase his stature. If he\r\nportrays a woman, he calls her a \"female,\" makes her a model of decorum,\r\nand bores us by her sentimental gabbing. If he describes a social\r\ngathering, he instantly betrays his unfamiliarity with real society by\r\ntalking like a book of etiquette. But with rough men or manly men on land\r\nor sea, with half-mutinous crews of privateers or disciplined man-of-war's\r\nmen, with woodsmen, trappers, Indians, adventurous characters of the border\r\nor the frontier,--with all these Cooper is at home, and in writing of them\r\nhe rises almost to the height of genius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RETURN TO NATURE]\r\n\r\nIf we seek the secret of this contrast, we shall find it partly in the\r\nauthor himself, partly in a popular, half-baked philosophy of the period.\r\nThat philosophy was summed up in the words \"the return to nature,\" and it\r\nalleged that all human virtues flow from solitude and all vices from\r\ncivilization. Such a philosophy appealed strongly to Cooper, who was\r\ncontinually at odds with his fellows, who had been expelled from Yale, who\r\nhad engaged in many a bitter controversy, who had suffered abuse from\r\nnewspapers, and who in every case was inclined to consider his opponents as\r\nblockheads. No matter in what society he found himself, in imagination he\r\nwas always back in the free but lawless atmosphere of the frontier village\r\nin which his youth was spent. Hence he was well fitted to take the point of\r\nview of Natty Bumppo (in _The Pioneers_), who looked with hostile eyes\r\nupon the greed and waste of civilization; hence he portrayed his uneducated\r\nbackwoods hero as a brave and chivalrous gentleman, without guile or fear\r\nor selfishness, who owed everything to nature and nothing to society.\r\nEurope at that time was ready to welcome such a type with enthusiasm. The\r\nworld will always make way for him, whether he appears as a hero of fiction\r\nor as a man among men.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. The faults of Cooper--his stilted style and\r\nslipshod English, his tedious moralizing, his artificial dialogue, his\r\nstuffed gentlemen and inane \"females,\" his blunders in woodcraft--all these\r\nare so easily discovered by a casual reader that the historian need not\r\nlinger over them. His virtues are more interesting, and the first of these\r\nis that he has a story to tell. Ever since Anglo-Saxon days the\r\n\"tale-bringer\" has been a welcome guest, and that Cooper is a good\r\ntale-bringer is evident from his continued popularity at home and abroad.\r\nHe may not know much about the art of literature, or about psychology, or\r\nabout the rule that motives must be commensurate with actions; but he knows\r\na good story, and that, after all, is the main thing in a novel.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a love of manly action in Cooper and a robustness of\r\nimagination which compel attention. He is rather slow in starting his tale;\r\nbut he always sees a long trail ahead, and knows that every turn of the\r\ntrail will bring its surprise or adventure. It is only when we analyze and\r\ncompare his plots that we discover what a prodigal creative power he had.\r\nHe wrote, let us say, seven or eight good stories; but he spoiled ten times\r\nthat number by hasty or careless workmanship. In the neglected _Wept of\r\nWish-Ton-Wish_, for example, there is enough wasted material to furnish\r\na modern romancer or dramatist for half a lifetime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESCRIPTIVE POWER]\r\n\r\nAnother fine quality of Cooper is his descriptive power, his astonishing\r\nvigor in depicting forest, sea, prairie,--all the grandeur of wild nature\r\nas a background of human heroism. His descriptions are seldom accurate, for\r\nhe was a careless observer and habitually made blunders; but he painted\r\nnature as on a vast canvas whereon details might be ignored, and he\r\nreproduced the total impression of nature in a way that few novelists have\r\never rivaled. It is this sustained power of creating a vast natural stage\r\nand peopling it with elemental men, the pioneers of a strong nation, that\r\nlargely accounts for Cooper's secure place among the world's fiction\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORAL QUALITY]\r\n\r\nFinally, the moral quality of Cooper, his belief in manhood and womanhood,\r\nhis cleanness of heart and of tongue, are all reflected in his heroes and\r\nheroines. Very often he depicts rough men in savage or brutal situations;\r\nbut, unlike some modern realists, there is nothing brutal in his morals,\r\nand it is precisely where we might expect savagery or meanness that his\r\nsimple heroes appear as chivalrous gentlemen \"without fear and without\r\nreproach.\" That he was here splendidly true to nature and humanity is\r\nevident to one who has met his typical men (woodsmen, plainsmen, lumbermen,\r\nlonely trappers or timber-cruisers) in their own environment and\r\nexperienced their rare courtesy and hospitality. In a word, Cooper knew\r\nwhat virtue is, virtue of white man, virtue of Indian, and he makes us know\r\nand respect it. Of a hundred strong scenes which he has vividly pictured\r\nthere is hardly one that does not leave a final impression as pure and\r\nwholesome as the breath of the woods or the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDGAR ALLAN POE (1809-1849)\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant task to estimate Irving or Bryant, but Poe offers a hard\r\nnut for criticism to crack. The historian is baffled by an author who\r\nsecretes himself in the shadow, or perplexed by conflicting biographies, or\r\nput on the defensive by the fact that any positive judgment or opinion of\r\nPoe will almost certainly be challenged.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, therefore, we are to assume that Poe is one of the most\r\ndebatable figures in our literature. His life may be summed up as a pitiful\r\nstruggle for a little fame and a little bread. When he died few missed him,\r\nand his works were neglected. Following his recognition in Europe came a\r\nrevival of interest here, during which Poe was absurdly overpraised and the\r\nAmerican people berated for their neglect of a genius. Then arose a\r\nliterary controversy which showed chiefly that our critics were poles apart\r\nin their points of view. Though the controversy has long endured, it has\r\nsettled nothing of importance; for one reader regards Poe as a literary\r\n_poseur_, a writer of melodious nonsense in verse and of grotesque\r\nhorrors in prose; while another exalts him as a double master of poetry and\r\nfiction, an artist without a peer in American letters.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between these extremes hides the truth; but we shall not here\r\nattempt to decide whether it is nearer one side or the other. We note\r\nmerely that Poe is a writer for such mature readers as can appreciate his\r\nuncanny talent. What he wrote of abiding interest or value to young people\r\nmight be printed in a very small book.\r\n\r\n    BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. Notwithstanding all that has been written\r\n    about Poe, we do not and cannot know him as we know most other\r\n    American authors, whose lives are as an open book. He was always a\r\n    secretive person, \"a lover of mystery and retreats,\" and such\r\n    accounts of his life as he gave out are not trustworthy. He came\r\n    from a good Maryland family, but apparently from one of those\r\n    offshoots that are not true to type. His father left the study of\r\n    law to become a strolling actor, and presently married an English\r\n    actress. It was while the father and mother were playing their\r\n    parts in Boston that Edgar was born, in 1809.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EDGAR ALLAN POE]\r\n\r\n    Actors led a miserable life in those days, and the Poes were no\r\n    exception. They died comfortless in Richmond; their three children\r\n    were separated; and Edgar was adopted by John Allan, a wealthy\r\n    tobacco merchant. It was in the luxurious Allan home that the boy\r\n    began the drinking habits which were his bane ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: POE'S SCHOOL DAYS]\r\n\r\n    The Allans were abroad on business from 1815 to 1820, and during\r\n    these years Edgar was at a private school in the suburbs of London.\r\n    It was the master of that school who described the boy as a clever\r\n    lad spoiled by too much pocket money. The prose tale \"William\r\n    Wilson\" has some reflection of these school years, and, so far as\r\n    known, it is the only work in which Poe introduced any of his\r\n    familiar experiences.\r\n\r\n    Soon after his return to Richmond the boy was sent to the\r\n    University of Virginia, where his brilliant record as a student was\r\n    marred by his tendency to dissipation. After the first year Mr.\r\n    Allan, finding that the boy had run up a big gambling debt, took\r\n    him from college and put him to work in the tobacco house.\r\n    Whereupon Edgar, always resentful of criticism, quarreled with his\r\n    foster father and drifted out into the world. He was then at\r\n    eighteen, a young man of fine bearing, having the taste and manners\r\n    of a gentleman, but he had no friend in the world, no heritage of\r\n    hard work, no means of earning a living.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WEST RANGE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS WANDERINGS]\r\n\r\n    Next we hear vaguely of Poe in Boston where he published a tiny\r\n    volume, _Tamerlane and Other Poems, by a Bostonian_ (1827).\r\n    Failing to win either fame or money by his poetry he enlisted in\r\n    the army under an assumed name and served for about two years. Of\r\n    his army life we know nothing, nor do we hear of him again until\r\n    his foster father secured for him an appointment to the military\r\n    academy at West Point. There Poe made an excellent beginning, but\r\n    he soon neglected his work, was dismissed, and became an Ishmael\r\n    again. After trying in vain to secure a political office he went to\r\n    Baltimore, where he earned a bare living by writing for the\r\n    newspapers. The popular but mythical account of his life (for which\r\n    he himself is partly responsible) portrays him at this period in a\r\n    Byronic rôle, fighting with the Greeks for their liberty.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FIRST SUCCESS]\r\n\r\n    His literary career began in 1833 when his \"Manuscript Found in a\r\n    Bottle\" won for him a prize offered by a weekly newspaper. The same\r\n    \"Manuscript\" brought him to the attention of John Pendleton\r\n    Kennedy, who secured for him a position on the staff of the\r\n    _Southern Literary Messenger_. He then settled in Richmond,\r\n    and in his grasp was every thing that the heart of a young author\r\n    might desire. He had married his cousin, Virginia Clem, a beautiful\r\n    young girl whom he idolized; he had a comfortable home and an\r\n    assured position; Kennedy and other southern writers were his loyal\r\n    friends; the _Messenger_ published his work and gave him a\r\n    reputation in the literary world of America. Fortune stood smiling\r\n    beside him, when he quarreled with his friends, left the Messenger\r\n    and began once more his struggle with poverty and despair.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A LIFE OF FRAGMENTS]\r\n\r\n    It would require a volume to describe the next few years, and we\r\n    must pass hurriedly over them. His pen was now his only hope, and\r\n    he used it diligently in an effort to win recognition and a living.\r\n    He tried his fortune in different cities; he joined the staffs of\r\n    various periodicals; he projected magazines of his own. In every\r\n    project success was apparently within his reach when by some\r\n    weakness or misfortune he let his chance slip away. He was living\r\n    in Fordham (a suburb of New York, now called the Bronx) when he did\r\n    his best work; but there his wife died, in need of the common\r\n    comforts of life; and so destitute was the home that an appeal was\r\n    made in the newspapers for charity. One has but to remember Poe's\r\n    pride to understand how bitter was the cup from which he drank.\r\n\r\n    After his wife's death came two frenzied years in which not even\r\n    the memory of a great love kept him from unmanly wooing of other\r\n    women; but Poe was then unbalanced and not wholly responsible for\r\n    his action. At forty he became engaged to a widow in Richmond, who\r\n    could offer him at least a home. Generous friends raised a fund to\r\n    start him in life afresh; but a little later he was found\r\n    unconscious amid sordid surroundings in Baltimore. He died there,\r\n    in a hospital, before he was able to give any lucid account of his\r\n    last wanderings. It was a pitiful end; but one who studies Poe at\r\n    any part of his career has an impression of a perverse fate that\r\n    dogs the man and that insists on an ending in accord with the rest\r\n    of the story.\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF POE. Most people read Poe's poetry for the melody that is in\r\nit. To read it in any other way, to analyze or explain its message, is to\r\ndissect a butterfly that changes in a moment from a delicate, living\r\ncreature to a pinch of dust, bright colored but meaningless. It is not for\r\nanalysis, therefore, but simply for making Poe more intelligible that we\r\nrecord certain facts or principles concerning his verse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY OF POETRY]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first thing to note is that Poe is not the poet of smiles and\r\ntears, of joy and sorrow, as the great poets are, but the poet of a single\r\nmood,--a dull, despairing mood without hope of comfort. Next, he had a\r\ntheory (a strange theory in view of his mood) that the only object of\r\npoetry is to give pleasure, and that the pleasure of a poem depends largely\r\non melody, on sound rather than on sense. Finally, he believed that poetry\r\nshould deal with beauty alone, that poetic beauty is of a supernal or\r\nunearthly kind, and that such beauty is forever associated with melancholy.\r\nTo Poe the most beautiful imaginable object was a beautiful woman; but\r\nsince her beauty must perish, the poet must assume a tragic or despairing\r\nattitude in face of it. Hence his succession of shadowy Helens, and hence\r\nhis wail of grief that he has lost or must soon lose them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RAVEN]\r\n\r\nAll these poetic theories, or delusions, appear in Poe's most widely known\r\nwork, \"The Raven,\" which has given pleasure to a multitude of readers. It\r\nis a unique poem, and its popularity is due partly to the fact that nobody\r\ncan tell what it means. To analyze it is to discover that it is extremely\r\nmelodious; that it reflects a gloomy mood; that at the root of its sorrow\r\nis the mysterious \"lost Lenore\"; and that, as in most of Poe's works, a\r\nfantastic element is introduced, an \"ungainly fowl\" addressed with\r\ngrotesque dignity as \"Sir, or Madame,\" to divert attention from the fact\r\nthat the poet's grief is not simple or human enough for tears:\r\n\r\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, _still_ is sitting\r\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\n  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\n  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\nEqually characteristic of the author are \"To One in Paradise,\" \"The\r\nSleeper\" and \"Annabel Lee,\"--all melodious, all in hopeless mood, all\r\nexpressive of the same abnormal idea of poetry. Other and perhaps better\r\npoems are \"The Coliseum,\" \"Israfel,\" and especially the second \"To Helen,\"\r\nbeginning, \"Helen, thy beauty is to me.\"\r\n\r\nYoung readers may well be content with a few such lyrics, leaving the bulk\r\nof Poe's poems to such as may find meaning in their vaporous images. As an\r\nexample, study these two stanzas from \"Ulalume,\" a work which some may find\r\nvery poetic and others somewhat lunatic:\r\n\r\n  The skies they were ashen and sober;\r\n    The leaves they were crispéd and sere--\r\n    The leaves they were withering and sere;\r\n  It was night in the lonesome October\r\n    Of my most immemorial year;\r\n  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\n    In the misty mid region of Weir--\r\n  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n    In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\n  Here once, through an alley Titanic\r\n    Of cypress, I roamed with my soul--\r\n    Of cypress, with Psyche, my soul.\r\n  These were days when my heart was volcanic\r\n    As the scoriac rivers that roll--\r\n    As the lavas that restlessly roll\r\n  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,\r\n    In the ultimate climes of the pole--\r\n  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek,\r\n    In the realms of the boreal pole.\r\n\r\nThis is melodious, to be sure, but otherwise it is mere word juggling, a\r\nstringing together of names and rimes with a total effect of lugubrious\r\nnonsense. It is not to be denied that some critics find pleasure in\r\n\"Ulalume\"; but uncritical readers need not doubt their taste or\r\nintelligence if they prefer counting-out rimes, \"The Jabberwock,\" or other\r\nnonsense verses that are more frankly and joyously nonsensical.\r\n\r\nPOE'S FICTION. Should it be asked why Poe's tales are nearly all of the\r\nbloodcurdling variety, the answer is that they are a triple reflection of\r\nhimself, of the fantastic romanticism of his age, and of the taste of\r\nreaders who were then abnormally fond of ghastly effects in fiction. Let us\r\nunderstand these elements clearly; for otherwise Poe's horrible stories\r\nwill give us nothing beyond the mere impression of horror.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAN AND HIS TIMES]\r\n\r\nTo begin with the personal element, Poe was naturally inclined to\r\nmorbidness. He had a childish fear of darkness and hobgoblins; he worked\r\nlargely \"on his nerves\"; he had an abnormal interest in graves, ghouls and\r\nthe terrors which preternatural subjects inspire in superstitious minds. As\r\na writer he had to earn his bread; and the fiction most in demand at that\r\ntime was of the \"gothic\" or _Mysteries of Udolpho_ kind, with its\r\ndiabolical villain, its pallid heroine in a haunted room, its medley of\r\nmystery and horror. [Footnote: As Richardson suggests, the popular novels\r\nof Poe's day are nearly all alike in that they remind us of the fat boy in\r\n_Pickwick_, who \"just wanted to make your flesh creep.\" Jane Austen\r\n(and later, Scott and Cooper) had written against this morbid tendency, but\r\nstill the \"gothic\" novel had its thousands of shuddering readers on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic.] At the beginning of the century Charles Brockden\r\nBrown had made a success of the \"American gothic\" (a story of horror\r\nmodified to suit American readers), and Poe carried on the work of Brown\r\nwith precisely the same end in view, namely, to please his audience. He\r\nused the motive of horror partly because of his own taste and training, no\r\ndoubt, but more largely because he shrewdly \"followed the market\" in\r\nfiction. Then as now there were many readers who enjoyed, as Stevenson\r\nsays, being \"frightened out of their boots,\" and to such readers he\r\nappealed. His individuality and, perhaps, his chief excellence as a\r\nstory-writer lay in his use of strictly logical methods, in his ability to\r\nmake the most impossible yarn seem real by his reasonable way of telling\r\nit. Moreover, he was a discoverer, an innovator, a maker of new types,\r\nsince he was the first to introduce in his stories the blend of calm,\r\nlogical science and wild fancy of a terrifying order; so he served as an\r\ninspiration as well as a point of departure for Jules Verne and other\r\nwriters of the same pseudo-scientific school.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROUPS OF STORIES]\r\n\r\nPoe's numerous tales may be grouped in three or four classes. Standing by\r\nitself is \"William Wilson,\" a story of double personality (one good and one\r\nevil genius in the same person), to which Stevenson was indebted in his\r\n_Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_. Next are the tales of\r\npseudo-science and adventure, such as \"Hans Pfaall\" and the \"Descent into\r\nthe Maelstrom,\" which represent a type of popular fiction developed by\r\nJules Verne, H. G. Wells and many others, all of whom were more or less\r\ninfluenced by Poe. A third group may be called the ingenious-mystery\r\nstories. One of the most typical of these is \"The Gold Bug,\" a tale of\r\ncipher-writing and buried treasure, which contains the germ, at least, of\r\nStevenson's _Treasure Island_. To the same group belong \"The Murders\r\nin the Rue Morgue\" and other stories dealing with the wondrous acumen of a\r\ncertain Dupin, who is the father of \"Old Sleuth,\" \"Sherlock Holmes\" and\r\nother amateur detectives who do such marvelous things in fiction,--to\r\natone, no doubt, for their extraordinary dullness in real life.\r\n\r\nStill another group consists of phantom stories,--ghastly yarns that serve\r\nno purpose but to make the reader's spine creep. The mildest of these\r\nhorrors is \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" which some critics place at\r\nthe head of Poe's fiction. It is a \"story of atmosphere\"; that is, a story\r\nin which the scene, the air, the vague \"feeling\" of a place arouse an\r\nexpectation of some startling or unusual incident. Many have read this\r\nstory and found pleasure therein; but others ask frankly, \"Why bother to\r\nwrite or to read such palpable nonsense?\" With all Poe's efforts to make it\r\nreal, Usher's house is not a home or even a building in which dwells a man;\r\nit is a vacuum inhabited by a chimera. Of necessity, therefore, it tumbles\r\ninto melodramatic nothingness the moment the author takes leave of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHAT TO READ]\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, \"What shall one read of Poe's fiction?\" the answer must\r\ndepend largely upon individual taste. \"The Gold Bug\" is a good story,\r\nhaving the adventurous interest of finding a pirate's hidden gold; at\r\nleast, that is how most readers regard it, though Poe meant us to be\r\ninterested not in the gold but in his ingenious cryptogram or secret\r\nwriting. The allegory of \"William Wilson\" is perhaps the most original of\r\nPoe's works; and for a thriller \"The House of Usher\" may be recommended as\r\nthe least repulsive of the tales of horror. To the historian the chief\r\ninterest of all these tales lies in the influence which they have exerted\r\non a host of short-story writers at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _SOUTHERN LITERARY MESSENGER_ BUILDING]\r\n\r\nAN ESTIMATE OF POE. Any summary of such a difficult subject is\r\nunsatisfactory and subject to challenge. We shall try here simply to\r\noutline Poe's aim and method, leaving the student to supply from his own\r\nreading most of the details and all the exceptions.\r\n\r\nPoe's chief purpose was not to tell a tale for its own sake or to portray a\r\nhuman character; he aimed to produce an effect or impression in the\r\nreader's mind, an impression of unearthly beauty in his poems and of\r\nunearthly horror in his prose. Some writers (Hawthorne, for example) go\r\nthrough life as in a dream; but if one were to judge Poe by his work, one\r\nmight think that he had suffered a long nightmare. Of this familiar\r\nexperience, his youth, his army training, his meeting with other men, his\r\nimpressions of nature or humanity, there is hardly a trace in his work; of\r\ndespair, terror and hallucinations there is a plethora.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS METHOD]\r\n\r\nHis method was at once haphazard and carefully elaborated,--a paradox, it\r\nseems, till we examine his work or read his records thereof. In his poetry\r\nwords appealed to him, as they appeal to some children, not so much for\r\ntheir meaning as for their sound. Thus the word \"nevermore,\" a gloomy,\r\nterrible word, comes into his mind, and he proceeds to brood over it. The\r\nshadow of a great loss is in the word, and loss meant to Poe the loss of\r\nbeauty in the form of a woman; therefore he invents \"the lost Lenore\" to\r\nrime with his \"nevermore.\" Some outward figure of despair is now needed,\r\nsomething that will appeal to the imagination; and for that Poe selects the\r\nsable bird that poets have used since Anglo-Saxon times as a symbol of\r\ngloom or mystery. Then carefully, line by line, he hammers out \"The Raven,\"\r\na poem which from beginning to end is built around the word \"nevermore\"\r\nwith its suggestion of pitiless memories.\r\n\r\nOr again, Poe is sitting at the bedside of his dead wife when another word\r\nsuddenly appeals to him. It is Shakespeare's\r\n\r\n                    Duncan is in his grave;\r\n  After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.\r\n\r\nAnd from that word is born \"For Annie,\" with an ending to the first stanza\r\nwhich is an epitome of the poem, and which Longfellow suggested as a\r\nfitting epitaph for Poe's tomb:\r\n\r\n  And the fever called \"Living\"\r\n    Is conquered at last.\r\n\r\nHe reads Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" and his \"Manuscript\r\nFound in a Bottle\" is the elaborated result of his chance inspiration. He\r\nsees Cooper make a success of a sea tale, and Irving of a journal of\r\nexploration; and, though he knows naught of the sea or the prairie, he\r\nproduces his hair-raising _Arthur Gordon Pym_ and his _Journal of\r\nJulius Rodman_. Some sailor's yarn of a maelstrom in the North Sea comes\r\nto his ears, and he fabricates a story of a man who went into the\r\nwhirlpool. He sees a newspaper account of a premature burial, and his\r\n\"House of Usher\" and several other stories reflect the imagined horror of\r\nsuch an experience. The same criticism applies to his miscellaneous\r\nthrillers, in which with rare cunning he uses phantoms, curtains, shadows,\r\ncats, the moldy odor of the grave,--and all to make a gruesome tale\r\ninspired by some wild whim or nightmare.\r\n\r\nIn fine, no other American writer ever had so slight a human basis for his\r\nwork; no other ever labored more patiently or more carefully. The unending\r\ncontroversy over Poe commonly reduces itself to this deadlock: one reader\r\nasks, \"What did he do that was worth a man's effort in the doing?\" and\r\nanother answers, \"What did he do that was not cleverly, skillfully done?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The early part of the nineteenth century (sometimes called\r\n    the First National period of American letters) was a time of\r\n    unusual enthusiasm. The country had recently won its independence\r\n    and taken its place among the free nations of the world; it had\r\n    emerged triumphant from a period of doubt and struggle over the\r\n    Constitution and the Union; it was increasing with amazing rapidity\r\n    in territory, in population and in the wealth which followed a\r\n    successful commerce; its people were united as never before by\r\n    noble pride in the past and by a great hope for the future. It is\r\n    not surprising, therefore, that our first really national\r\n    literature (that is, a literature which was read by practically the\r\n    whole country, and which represented America to foreign nations)\r\n    should appear in this expansive age as an expression of the\r\n    national enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: CHIEF WRITERS]\r\n\r\n    The four chief writers of the period are: Irving, the pleasant\r\n    essayist, story-teller and historian; Bryant, the poet of primeval\r\n    nature; Cooper, the novelist, who was the first American author to\r\n    win world-wide fame; and Poe, the most cunning craftsman among our\r\n    early writers, who wrote a few melodious poems and many tales of\r\n    mystery or horror. Some critics would include also among the major\r\n    writers William Gilmore Simms (sometimes called \"the Cooper of the\r\n    South\"), author of many adventurous romances dealing with pioneer\r\n    life and with Colonial and Revolutionary history.\r\n\r\n    The numerous minor writers of the age are commonly grouped in local\r\n    schools. The Knickerbocker school, of New York, includes the poets\r\n    Halleck and Drake, the novelist Paulding, and one writer of\r\n    miscellaneous prose and verse, Nathaniel P. Willis, who was for a\r\n    time more popular than any other American writer save Cooper. In\r\n    the southern school (led by Poe and Simms) were Wilde, Kennedy and\r\n    William Wirt. The West was represented by Timothy Flint and James\r\n    Hall. In New England were the poets Percival and Maria Brooks, the\r\n    novelists Sarah Morton and Catherine Sedgwick, and the historians\r\n    Sparks and Bancroft. The writers we have named are merely typical;\r\n    there were literally hundreds of others who were more or less\r\n    widely known in the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FOREIGN INFLUENCE]\r\n\r\n    The first common characteristic of these writers was their\r\n    patriotic enthusiasm; the second was their romantic spirit. The\r\n    romantic movement in English poetry was well under way at this\r\n    time, and practically all our writers were involved in it. They\r\n    were strongly influenced, moreover, by English writers of the\r\n    period or by settled English literary traditions. Thus, Irving\r\n    modeled his style closely on that of Addison; the early poetry of\r\n    Bryant shows the influence of Wordsworth; the weird tales of Poe\r\n    and his critical essays were both alike influenced by Coleridge;\r\n    and the quickening influence of Scott appears plainly in the\r\n    romances of Cooper. The minor writers were even more subject to\r\n    foreign influences, especially to German and English romanticism.\r\n    There was, however, a sturdy independence in the work of most of\r\n    these writers which stamps it as original and unmistakably\r\n    American. The nature poetry of Bryant with its rugged strength and\r\n    simplicity, the old Dutch legends and stories of Irving, the\r\n    pioneer romances of Cooper and Simms, the effective short stories\r\n    of Poe,--these have hardly a counterpart in foreign writings of the\r\n    period.

To study the history of America after 1840 is to\r\n    have our attention drawn as by a powerful lodestone to the Civil\r\n    War. It looms there in the middle of the nineteenth century, a\r\n    stupendous thing, dominating and dwarfing all others. To it\r\n    converge many ways that then seemed aimless or wandering, the\r\n    unanswered questions of the Constitution, the compromises of\r\n    statesmen, the intrigues of politicians, the clamor of impatient\r\n    reformers, the silent degradation of the slave. And from it, all\r\n    its passion and suffering forgotten, its heroism remembered,\r\n    proceed the unexpected blessings of a finer love of country, a\r\n    broader sense of union, a surer faith in democracy, a better\r\n    understanding of the spirit of America, more gratitude for her\r\n    glorious past, more hope for her future. So every thought or\r\n    mention of the mighty conflict draws us onward, as the first sight\r\n    of the Rockies, massive and snow crowned, lures the feet of the\r\n    wanderer on the plains.\r\n\r\n    We shall not attempt here to summarize the war between the South\r\n    and the North or even to list its causes and consequences. The\r\n    theme is too vast. We note only that the main issues of the\r\n    conflict, state rights and slavery, had been debated for the better\r\n    part of a century, and might still have found peaceful solution had\r\n    they not been complicated by the minor issues of such an age of\r\n    agitation as America never saw before and, as we devoutly hope, may\r\n    never see again.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"The Man\" (Abraham Lincoln)]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE AGE OF AGITATION]\r\n\r\n    Such agitation was perhaps inevitable in a country that had grown\r\n    too rapidly for its government to assimilate the new possessions.\r\n    By the Oregon treaty, the war with Mexico and the annexation of\r\n    Texas vast territories had suddenly been added to the Union, each\r\n    with its problem that called for patient and wise deliberation, but\r\n    that a passionate and half-informed Congress was expected to settle\r\n    overnight. With the expansion of territory in the West came a\r\n    marvelous increase of trade and wealth in the North, and a\r\n    corresponding growth in the value of cotton and slave labor in the\r\n    South. Then arose an economic strife; the agricultural interests of\r\n    one part of the country clashed with the manufacturing interests of\r\n    another (in such matters as the tariff, for example), and in the\r\n    tumult of party politics it was impossible to reach any harmonious\r\n    adjustment. Finally, the violent agitation of the slave question\r\n    forced it to the front not simply as a moral or human but as a\r\n    political issue; for the old \"balance of power\" between the states\r\n    was upset when the North began to outstrip the South in population,\r\n    and every state was then fiercely jealous of its individual rights\r\n    and obligations in a way that we can now hardly comprehend.\r\n\r\n    As a result of these conflicting interests and the local or\r\n    sectional passions which they aroused, there was seldom a year\r\n    after 1840 when the country did not face a situation of extreme\r\n    difficulty or danger. Indeed, even while Webster was meditating his\r\n    prophetic oration with its superb climax of \"Liberty and Union, now\r\n    and forever, one and inseparable,\" many of the most thoughtful\r\n    minds, south and north, believed that Congress faced a problem\r\n    beyond its power to solve; that no single government was wise\r\n    enough or strong enough to meet the situation, especially a\r\n    government divided against itself.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE WIND AND THE WHIRLWIND]\r\n\r\n    In the midst of the political tumult, which was increased by the\r\n    clamor of agitators and reformers, came suddenly the secession of a\r\n    state from the Union, an act long threatened, long feared, but\r\n    which arrived at last with the paralyzing effect of a thunderbolt.\r\n    Then the clamor ceased; minor questions were swept aside as by a\r\n    tempest, and the main issues were settled not by constitutional\r\n    rights, not by orderly process of law or the ballot, but by the\r\n    fearful arbitrament of the sword. And even as the thunderbolt fell\r\n    and the Union trembled, came also unheralded one gaunt, heroic,\r\n    heaven-sent man to lead the nation in its hour of peril:\r\n\r\n      Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,\r\n        Gentle and merciful and just!\r\n      Who in the fear of God didst bear\r\n        The sword of power, a nation's trust!\r\n\r\n    Such is an outline of the period of conflict, an outline to which\r\n    the political measures or compromises of the time, its sectional\r\n    antagonism, its score of political parties, its agitators,\r\n    reformers, and all other matters of which we read confusedly in the\r\n    histories, are but so many illuminating details.\r\n\r\n    SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL CHANGES. The mental ferment of the period\r\n    was almost as intense as its political agitation. Thus, the\r\n    antislavery movement, which aimed to rescue the negro from his\r\n    servitude, was accompanied by a widespread communistic attempt to\r\n    save the white man from the manifold evils of our competitive\r\n    system of industry. Brook Farm [Footnote: This was a Massachusetts\r\n    society, founded in 1841 by George Ripley. It included Hawthorne,\r\n    Dana and Curtis in its large membership, and it had the support of\r\n    Emerson, Greeley, Channing, Margaret Fuller and a host of other\r\n    prominent men and women] was the most famous of these communities;\r\n    but there were more than thirty others scattered over the country,\r\n    all holding property in common, working on a basis of mutual\r\n    helpfulness, aiming at a nobler life and a better system of labor\r\n    than that which now separates the capitalist and the workingman.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WIDENING HORIZONS]\r\n\r\n    This brave attempt at human brotherhood, of which Brook Farm was\r\n    the visible symbol, showed itself in many other ways: in the\r\n    projection of a hundred social reforms; in the establishment of\r\n    lyceums throughout the country, where every man with a message\r\n    might find a hearing. In education our whole school system was\r\n    changed by applying the methods of Pestalozzi, a Swiss reformer;\r\n    for the world had suddenly become small, thanks to steam and\r\n    electricity, and what was spoken in a corner the newspapers\r\n    immediately proclaimed from the housetops. In religious circles the\r\n    Unitarian movement, under Channing's leadership, gained rapidly in\r\n    members and in influence; in literature the American horizon was\r\n    broadened by numerous translations from the classic books of\r\n    foreign countries; in the realm of philosophy the western mind was\r\n    stimulated by the teaching of the idealistic system known as\r\n    Transcendentalism.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TRANSCENDENTALISM]\r\n\r\n    Emerson was the greatest exponent of this new philosophy, which\r\n    made its appearance here in 1836. It exalted the value of the\r\n    individual man above society or institutions; and in dealing with\r\n    the individual it emphasized his freedom rather than his subjection\r\n    to authority, his soul rather than his body, his inner wealth of\r\n    character rather than his outward possessions. It taught that\r\n    nature was an open book of the Lord in which he who runs may read a\r\n    divine message; and in contrast with eighteenth-century philosophy\r\n    (which had described man as a creature of the senses, born with a\r\n    blank mind, and learning only by experience), it emphasized the\r\n    divinity of man's nature, his inborn ideas of right and wrong, his\r\n    instinct of God, his passion for immortality,--in a word, his\r\n    higher knowledge which transcends the knowledge gained from the\r\n    senses, and which is summarized in the word \"Transcendentalism.\"\r\n\r\n    We have described this in the conventional way as a new philosophy,\r\n    though in truth it is almost as old as humanity. Most of the great\r\n    thinkers of the world, in all ages and in all countries, have been\r\n    transcendentalists; but in the original way in which the doctrine\r\n    was presented by Emerson it seemed like a new revelation, as all\r\n    fine old things do when they are called to our attention, and it\r\n    exercised a profound influence on our American life and literature.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE PERIOD. The violent political agitation and the profound\r\nsocial unrest of the period found expression in multitudinous works of\r\nprose or verse; but the curious fact is that these are all minor works, and\r\ncould without much loss be omitted from our literary records. They are\r\nmostly sectional in spirit, and only what is national or human can long\r\nendure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINOR WORKS]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate our criticism, the terrible war that dominates the period\r\nnever had any worthy literary expression; there are thousands of writings\r\nbut not a single great poem or story or essay or drama on the subject. The\r\nantislavery movement likewise brought forth its poets, novelists, orators\r\nand essayists; some of the greater writers were drawn into its whirlpool of\r\nagitation, and Whittier voiced the conviction that the age called for a man\r\nrather than a poet in a cry which was half defiance and half regret:\r\n\r\n  Better than self-indulgent years\r\n    The outflung heart of youth,\r\n  Than pleasant songs in idle ears\r\n    The tumult of the truth!\r\n\r\nThat was the feeling in the heart of many a promising young southern or\r\nnorthern poet in midcentury, just as it was in 1776, when our best writers\r\nneglected literature for political satires against Whigs or Tories. Yet of\r\nthe thousand works which the antislavery agitation inspired we can think of\r\nonly one, Mrs. Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, which lives with power to\r\nour own day; and there is something of universal human nature in that\r\nfamous book, written not from knowledge or experience but from the\r\nimagination, which appeals broadly to our human sympathy, and which makes\r\nit welcome in countries where slavery as a political or a moral issue has\r\nlong since been forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS]\r\n\r\nThough the ferment of the age produced no great books, it certainly\r\ninfluenced our literature, making it a very different product from that of\r\nthe early national period. For example, nearly every political issue soon\r\nbecame a moral issue; and there is a deep ethical earnestness in the essays\r\nof Emerson, the poems of Longfellow and the novels of Hawthorne which sets\r\nthem apart, as of a different spirit, from the works of Irving, Poe and\r\nCooper.\r\n\r\nAgain, the mental unrest of the period showed itself in a passion for new\r\nideas, new philosophy, new prose and poetry. We have already spoken of the\r\ntranscendental philosophy, but even more significant was the sudden\r\nbroadening of literary interest. American readers had long been familiar\r\nwith the best English poets; now they desired to know how our common life\r\nhad been reflected by poets of other nations. In answer to that desire\r\ncame, first, the establishment of professorships of _belles-lettres_\r\nin our American colleges; and then a flood of translations from European\r\nand oriental literatures. As we shall presently see, every prominent writer\r\nfrom Emerson to Whitman was influenced by new views of life as reflected in\r\nthe world's poetry. Longfellow is a conspicuous example; with his songs\r\ninspired by Spanish or German or Scandinavian originals he is at times more\r\nlike an echo of Europe than a voice from the New World.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LONGFELLOW, AT FALMOUTH (NOW PORTLAND), MAINE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN AGE OF POETRY]\r\n\r\nFinally, this period of conflict was governed more largely than usual by\r\nideals, by sentiment, by intense feeling. Witness the war, with the heroic\r\nsentiments which it summoned up south and north. As the deepest human\r\nfeeling cannot be voiced in prose, we confront the strange phenomenon of an\r\nAmerican age of poetry. This would be remarkable Poetry enough to one who\r\nremembers that the genius of America had hitherto appeared practical and\r\nprosaic, given to action rather than speech, more concerned to \"get on\" in\r\nlife than to tell what life means; but it is even more remarkable in view\r\nof the war, which covers the age with its frightful shadow. As Lincoln, sad\r\nand overburdened, found the relief of tears in the beautiful ending of\r\nLongfellow's \"Building of the Ship,\" so, it seems, the heart of America,\r\ntorn by the sight of her sons in conflict, found blessed relief in songs of\r\nlove, of peace, of home, of beauty,--of all the lovely and immortal ideals\r\nto which every war offers violent but impotent contradiction. And this may\r\nbe the simple explanation of the fact that the most cherished poems\r\nproduced by any period of war are almost invariably its songs of peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GREATER POETS\r\n\r\nHENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW (1807-1882)\r\n\r\nWhen Longfellow sent forth his _Voices of the Night_, in 1839, that\r\nmodest little volume met with a doubly warm reception. Critics led by Poe\r\npounced on the work to condemn its sentimentality or moralizing, while a\r\nmultitude of readers who needed no leader raised a great shout of welcome.\r\n\r\nNow as then there are diverse critical opinions of Longfellow, and\r\nunfortunately these opinions sometimes obscure the more interesting facts:\r\nthat Longfellow is still the favorite of the American home, the most\r\nhonored of all our elder poets; that in foreign schools his works are\r\ncommonly used as an introduction to English verse, and that he has probably\r\nled more young people to appreciate poetry than any other poet who ever\r\nwrote our language. That strange literary genius Lafcadio Hearn advised his\r\nJapanese students to begin the study of poetry with Longfellow, saying that\r\nthey might learn to like other poets better in later years, but that\r\nLongfellow was most certain to charm them at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this advice, given to the antipodes, was probably this, that\r\nyoung hearts and pure hearts are the same the world over, and Longfellow is\r\nthe poet of the young and pure in heart.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The impression of serenity in Longfellow's work may be\r\n    explained by the gifts which Fortune offered him in the way of\r\n    endowment, training and opportunity. By nature he was a gentleman;\r\n    his home training was of the best; to his college education four\r\n    years of foreign study were added, a very unusual thing at that\r\n    time; and no sooner was he ready for his work than the way opened\r\n    as if the magic _Sesame_ were on his lips. His own college\r\n    gave him a chair of modern languages and literature, which was the\r\n    very thing he wanted; then Harvard offered what seemed to him a\r\n    wider field, and finally his country called him from the\r\n    professor's chair to teach the love of poetry to the whole nation.\r\n    Before his long and beautiful life ended he had enjoyed for half a\r\n    century the two rewards that all poets desire, and the most of them\r\n    in vain; namely, fame and love. The first may be fairly won; the\r\n    second is a free gift.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW]\r\n\r\n    Longfellow was born (1807) in the town of Falmouth, Maine, which\r\n    has since been transformed into the city of Portland. Like Bryant\r\n    he was descended from Pilgrim stock; but where the older poet's\r\n    training had been strictly puritanic, Longfellow's was more liberal\r\n    and broadly cultured. Bryant received the impulse to poetry from\r\n    his grandfather's prayers, but Longfellow seems to have heard his\r\n    first call in the sea wind. Some of his best lyrics sing of the\r\n    ocean; his early book of essays was called _Driftwood_, his\r\n    last volume of poetry _In the Harbor_; and in these lyrics and\r\n    titles we have a reflection of his boyhood impressions in looking\r\n    forth from the beautiful Falmouth headland, then a wild,\r\n    wood-fringed pasture but now a formal park:\r\n\r\n      I remember the black wharves and the slips,\r\n        And the sea tides tossing free,\r\n      And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,\r\n      And the beauty and mystery of the ships,\r\n        And the magic of the sea.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE CALL OF BOOKS]\r\n\r\n    This first call was presently neglected for the more insistent\r\n    summons of literature; and thereafter Longfellow's inspiration was\r\n    at second hand, from books rather than from nature or humanity.\r\n    Soon after his graduation from Bowdoin (1825) he was offered a\r\n    professorship in modern languages on condition that he prepare\r\n    himself for the work by foreign study. With a glad heart he\r\n    abandoned the law, which he had begun to study in his father's\r\n    office, and spent three happy years in France, Spain and Italy.\r\n    There he steeped himself in European poetry, and picked up a\r\n    reading knowledge of several languages. Strangely enough, the\r\n    romantic influence of Europe was reflected by this poet in a book\r\n    of prose essays, _Outre Mer_, modeled on Irving's _Sketch\r\n    Book_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: YEARS OF TEACHING]\r\n\r\n    For five years Longfellow taught the modern languages at Bowdoin,\r\n    and his subject was so new in America that he had to prepare his\r\n    own textbooks. Then, after another period of foreign study (this\r\n    time in Denmark and Germany), he went to Harvard, where he taught\r\n    modern languages and literature for eighteen years. In 1854 he\r\n    resigned his chair, and for the remainder of his life devoted\r\n    himself whole-heartedly to poetry.\r\n\r\n    His literary work began with newspaper verses, the best of which\r\n    appear in the \"Earlier Poems\" of his collected works. Next he\r\n    attempted prose in his _Outre Mer_, _Driftwood Essays_\r\n    and the romances _Hyperion_ and _Kavanagh_. In 1839\r\n    appeared his first volume of poetry, _Voices of the Night_,\r\n    after which few years went by without some notable poem or volume\r\n    from Longfellow's pen. His last book, _In the Harbor_,\r\n    appeared with the news of his death, in 1882.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS SERENITY]\r\n\r\n    Aside from these \"milestones\" there is little to record in a career\r\n    so placid that we remember by analogy \"The Old Clock on the\r\n    Stairs.\" For the better part of his life he lived in Cambridge,\r\n    where he was surrounded by a rare circle of friends, and whither\r\n    increasing numbers came from near or far to pay the tribute of\r\n    gratitude to one who had made life more beautiful by his singing.\r\n    Once only the serenity was broken by a tragedy, the death of the\r\n    poet's wife, who was fatally burned before his eyes,--a tragedy\r\n    which occasioned his translation of Dante's _Divina Commedia_\r\n    (by which work he strove to keep his sorrow from overwhelming him)\r\n    and the exquisite \"Cross of Snow.\" The latter seemed too sacred for\r\n    publication; it was found, after the poet's death, among his\r\n    private papers.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HIS WORK AND INFLUENCE]\r\n\r\n    Reading Longfellow's poems one would never suspect that they were\r\n    produced in an age of turmoil. To be sure, one finds a few poems on\r\n    slavery (sentimental effusions, written on shipboard to relieve the\r\n    monotony of a voyage), but these were better unwritten since they\r\n    added nothing to the poet's song and took nothing from the slave's\r\n    burden. Longfellow has been criticized for his inaction in the\r\n    midst of tumult, but possibly he had his reasons. When everybody's\r\n    shouting is an excellent time to hold your tongue. He had his own\r\n    work to do, a work for which he was admirably fitted; that he did\r\n    not turn aside from it is to his credit and our profit. One demand\r\n    of his age was, as we have noted elsewhere, to enter into the\r\n    wealth of European poetry; and he gave thirty years of his life to\r\n    satisfying that demand. Our own poetry was then sentimental, a kind\r\n    of \"sugared angel-cake\"; and Longfellow, who was sentimental enough\r\n    but whose sentiment was balanced by scholarship, made poetry that\r\n    was like wholesome bread to common men. Lowell was a more brilliant\r\n    writer, and Whittier a more inspired singer; but neither did a work\r\n    for American letters that is comparable to that of Longfellow, who\r\n    was essentially an educator, a teacher of new ideas, new values,\r\n    new beauty. His influence in broadening our literary culture, in\r\n    deepening our sympathy for the poets of other lands, and in making\r\n    our own poetry a true expression of American feeling is beyond\r\n    measure.\r\n\r\nMINOR POEMS. It was by his first simple poems that Longfellow won the\r\nhearts of his people, and by them he is still most widely and gratefully\r\nremembered. To name these old favorites (\"The Day is Done,\" \"Resignation,\"\r\n\"Ladder of St. Augustine,\" \"Rainy Day,\" \"Footsteps of Angels,\" \"Light of\r\nStars,\" \"Reaper and the Flowers,\" \"Hymn to the Night,\" \"Midnight Mass,\"\r\n\"Excelsior,\" \"Village Blacksmith,\" \"Psalm of Life\") is to list many of the\r\npoems that are remembered and quoted wherever in the round world the\r\nEnglish language is spoken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESPER SONGS]\r\n\r\nOrdinarily such poems are accepted at their face value as a true expression\r\nof human sentiment; but if we examine them critically, remembering the\r\npeople for whom they were written, we may discover the secret of their\r\npopularity. The Anglo-Saxons are first a busy and then a religious folk;\r\nwhen their day's work is done their thoughts turn naturally to higher\r\nmatters; and any examination of Longfellow's minor works shows that a large\r\nproportion of them deal with the thoughts or feelings of men at the close\r\nof day. Such poems would be called _Abendlieder_ in German; a good\r\nOld-English title for them would be \"Evensong\"; and both titles suggest the\r\nelement of faith or worship. In writing these poems Longfellow had,\r\nunconsciously perhaps, the same impulse that leads one man to sing a hymn\r\nand another to say his prayers when the day is done. Because he expresses\r\nthis almost universal feeling simply and reverently, his work is dear to\r\nmen and women who would not have the habit of work interfere with the\r\ndivine instinct of worship.\r\n\r\nFurther examination of these minor poems shows them to be filled with\r\nsentiment that often slips over the verge of sentimentality. The sentiments\r\nexpressed are not of the exalted, imaginative kind; they are the sentiments\r\nof plain people who feel deeply but who can seldom express their feeling.\r\nNow, most people are sentimental (though we commonly try to hide the fact,\r\nmore's the pity), and we are at heart grateful to the poet who says for us\r\nin simple, musical language what we are unable or ashamed to say for\r\nourselves. In a word, the popularity of Longfellow's poems rests firmly on\r\nthe humanity of the poet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL POEMS]\r\n\r\nBesides these vesper songs are a hundred other short poems, among which the\r\nreader must make his own selection. The ballads should not be neglected,\r\nfor Longfellow knew how to tell a story in verse. If he were too prone to\r\nadd a moral to his tale (a moral that does not speak for itself were better\r\nomitted), we can overlook the fault, since his moral was a good one and his\r\nreaders liked it. The \"occasional\" poems, also, written to celebrate\r\npersons or events (such as \"Building of the Ship,\" \"Hanging of the Crane,\"\r\n\"Morituri Salutamus,\" \"Bells of Lynn,\" \"Robert Burns,\" \"Chamber over the\r\nGate\") well deserved the welcome which the American people gave them. And\r\nthe sonnets (such as \"Three Friends,\" \"Victor and Vanquished,\" \"My Books,\"\r\n\"Nature,\" \"Milton,\" \"President Garfield,\" \"Giotto's Tower\") are not only\r\nthe most artistic of Longfellow's works but rank very near to the best\r\nsonnets in the English language.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN IDYLS. In the same spirit in which Tennyson wrote his _English\r\nIdyls_ the American poet sent forth certain works reflecting the beauty\r\nof common life on this side of the ocean; and though he never collected or\r\ngave them a name, we think of them as his \"American Idyls.\" Many of his\r\nminor poems belong to this class, but we are thinking especially of\r\n_Evangeline_, _Miles Standish_ and _Hiawatha_. The\r\nlast-named, with its myths and legends clustering around one heroic\r\npersonage, is commonly called an epic; but its songs of Chibiabos,\r\nMinnehaha, Nokomis and the little Hiawatha are more like idyllic pictures\r\nof the original Americans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EVANGELINE]\r\n\r\n_Evangeline: a Tale of Acadie_ (1847) met the fate of Longfellow's\r\nearlier poems in that it was promptly attacked by a few critics while a\r\nmultitude of people read it with delight. Its success may be explained on\r\nfour counts. First, it is a charming story, not a \"modern\" or realistic but\r\na tender, pathetic story such as we read in old romances, and such as young\r\npeople will cherish so long as they remain young people. Second, it had a\r\nNew World setting, one that was welcomed in Europe because it offered\r\nreaders a new stage, more vast, shadowy, mysterious, than that to which\r\nthey were accustomed; and doubly welcomed here because it threw the glamor\r\nof romance over familiar scenes which deserved but had never before found\r\ntheir poet. Third, this old romance in a new setting was true to universal\r\nhuman nature; its sentiments of love, faith and deathless loyalty were such\r\nas make the heart beat faster wherever true hearts are found. Finally, it\r\nwas written in an unusual verse form, the unrimed hexameter, which\r\nLongfellow handled as well, let us say, as most other English poets who\r\nhave tried to use that alluring but difficult measure. For hexameters are\r\nlike the Italian language, which is very easy to \"pick up,\" but which few\r\nforeigners ever learn to speak with the rhythm and melody of a child of\r\nTuscany.\r\n\r\nLongfellow began his hexameters fairly well, as witness the opening lines\r\nof _Evangeline_:\r\n\r\n  This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,\r\n  Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\r\n  Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,\r\n  Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.\r\n  Loud from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced neighboring ocean\r\n  Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.\r\n\r\nOccasionally also he produced a very good but not quite perfect line or\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n  And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,\r\n  So with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation,\r\n  Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.\r\n\r\nOne must confess, however, that such passages are exceptional, and that one\r\nmust change the proper stress of a word too frequently to be enthusiastic\r\nover Longfellow's hexameters. Some of his lines halt or hobble, refusing to\r\nmove to the chosen measure, and others lose all their charm when spoken\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n  When she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.\r\n\r\nThat line has been praised by critics, but one must believe that they never\r\npronounced it. To voice its sibilant hissing is to understand the symbol\r\nfor a white man in the Indian sign language; that is, two fingers of a hand\r\nextended before the face, like the fork of a serpent's tongue. [Footnote:\r\nThis curious symbol, a snake's tongue to represent an Englishman, was\r\ninvented by some Indian whose ears were pained by a language in which the\r\n_s_ sounds occur too frequently. Our plurals are nearly all made that\r\nway, unfortunately; but Longfellow was able to make a hissing line without\r\nthe use of a single plural.] On the whole, Longfellow's verse should be\r\njudged not by itself but as a part of the tale he was telling. Holmes\r\nsummed up the first impression of many readers by saying that he found\r\nthese \"brimming lines\" an excellent medium for a charming story.\r\n\r\nThat is more than one can truthfully say of the next important idyl, _The\r\nCourtship of Miles Standish_ (1858). The story is a good one and, more\r\nthan all the histories, has awakened a romantic interest in the Pilgrims;\r\nbut its unhappy hexameters go jolting along, continually upsetting the\r\nmusical rhythm, until we wish that the tale had been told in either prose\r\nor poetry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SONG OF HIAWATHA]\r\n\r\n_The Song of Hiawatha_ (1855) was Longfellow's greatest work, and by\r\nit he will probably be longest remembered as a world poet. The materials\r\nfor this poem, its musical names, its primitive traditions, its fascinating\r\nfolklore, were all taken from Schoolcraft's books about the Ojibway\r\nIndians; its peculiar verse form, with its easy rhythm and endless\r\nrepetition, was copied from the _Kalevala_, the national epic of\r\nFinland. Material and method, the tale and the verse form, were finely\r\nadapted to each other; and though Longfellow showed no originality in\r\n_Hiawatha_, his poetic talent or genius appears in this: that these\r\ntales of childhood are told in a childlike spirit; that these forest\r\nlegends have the fragrance of hemlock in them; and that as we read them,\r\neven now, we seem to see the wigwam with its curling smoke, and beyond the\r\nwigwam the dewy earth, the shining river, and the blue sky with its pillars\r\nof tree trunks and its cloud of rustling leaves. The simplicity and\r\nnaturalness of primitive folklore is in this work of Longfellow, who of a\r\nhundred writers at home and abroad was the first to reveal the poetry in\r\nthe soul of an Indian.\r\n\r\nAs the poem is well known we forbear quotation; as it is too long, perhaps,\r\nwe express a personal preference in naming \"Hiawatha's Childhood,\" his\r\n\"Friends,\" his \"Fishing\" and his \"Wooing\" as the parts most likely to\r\nplease the beginner. The best that can be said of _Hiawatha_ is that\r\nit adds a new tale to the world's storybook. That book of the centuries has\r\nonly a few stories, each of which portrays a man from birth to death,\r\nfronting the problems of this life, meeting its joy or sorrow in man\r\nfashion, and then setting his face bravely to \"Ponemah,\" the Land of the\r\nHereafter. That Longfellow added a chapter to the volume which preserves\r\nthe stories of Ulysses, Beowulf, Arthur and Roland is undoubtedly his best\r\nor most enduring achievement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TAPROOM, WAYSIDE INN, SUDBURY]\r\n\r\nHIS EXPERIMENTAL WORKS. Unless the student wants to encourage a sentimental\r\nmood by reading _Hyperion_, Longfellow's prose works need not detain\r\nus. Much more valuable and readable are his translations from various\r\nEuropean languages, and of these his metrical version of _The Divine\r\nComedy_ of Dante is most notable. He attempted also several dramatic\r\nworks, among which _The Spanish Student_ (1843) is still readable,\r\nthough not very convincing. In _Christus: a Mystery_ he attempted a\r\nmiracle play of three acts, dealing with Christianity in the apostolic,\r\nmedieval and modern eras; but not even his admirers were satisfied with the\r\nresult. \"The Golden Legend\" (one version of which Caxton printed on the\r\nfirst English press, and which a score of different poets have paraphrased)\r\nis the only part of _Christus_ that may interest young readers by its\r\nromantic portrayal of the Middle Ages. To name such works is to suggest\r\nLongfellow's varied interests and his habit of experimenting with any\r\nsubject or verse form that attracted him in foreign literatures.\r\n\r\nThe _Tales of a Wayside Inn_ (1863-1873) is the most popular of\r\nLongfellow's miscellaneous works. Here are a score of stories from ancient\r\nor modern sources, as told by a circle of the poet's friends in the Red\r\nHorse Inn, at Sudbury. The title suggests at once the _Canterbury\r\nTales_ of Chaucer; but it would be unwise to make any comparison between\r\nthe two works or the two poets. The ballad of \"Paul Revere's Ride\" is the\r\nbest known of the _Wayside Inn_ poems; the Viking tales of \"The Saga\r\nof King Olaf\" are the most vigorous; the mellow coloring of the Middle Ages\r\nappears in such stories as \"The Legend Beautiful\" and \"The Bell of Atri.\"\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF LONGFELLOW. The broad sympathy of Longfellow, which made\r\nhim at home in the literatures of a dozen nations, was one of his finest\r\nqualities. He lived in Cambridge; he wrote in English; he is called the\r\npoet of the American home; but had he lived in Finland and written in a\r\nScandinavian tongue, his poems must still appeal to us. Indeed, so simply\r\ndid he reflect the sentiments of the human heart that Finland or any other\r\nnation might gladly class him among its poets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A POET OF ALL PEOPLES]\r\n\r\nFor example, many Englishmen have written about their Wellington, but, as\r\nHearn says, not even Tennyson's poem on the subject is quite equal to\r\nLongfellow's \"Warden of the Cinque Ports.\" The spirit of the Spanish\r\nmissions, with their self-sacrificing monks and their soldiers \"with hearts\r\nof fire and steel,\" is finely reflected in \"The Bells of San Blas.\" The\r\nhalf-superstitious loyalty of the Russian peasant for his hereditary ruler\r\nhas never been better reflected than in \"The White Czar.\" The story of\r\nBelisarius has been told in scores of histories and books of poetry; but\r\nyou will feel a deeper sympathy for the neglected old Roman soldier in\r\nLongfellow's poem than in anything else you may find on the same theme. And\r\nthere are many other foreign heroes or brave deeds that find beautiful\r\nexpression in the verse of our American poet. Of late it has become almost\r\na critical habit to disparage Longfellow; but no critic has pointed out\r\nanother poet who has reflected with sympathy and understanding the feelings\r\nof so many widely different peoples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGFELLOW'S LIBRARY IN CRAIGIE HOUSE, CAMBRIDGE]\r\n\r\nNaturally such a poet had his limitations. In comparison with Chaucer, for\r\nexample, we perceive instantly that Longfellow knew only one side of life,\r\nthe better side. Unhappy or rebellious or turbulent souls were beyond his\r\nken. He wrote only for those who work by day and sometimes go to evensong\r\nat night, who hopefully train their children or reverently bury their dead,\r\nand who cleave to a writer that speaks for them the fitting word of faith\r\nor cheer or consolation on every proper occasion. As humanity is largely\r\nmade of such men and women, Longfellow will always be a popular poet. For\r\nhim, with his serene outlook, there were not nine Muses but only three, and\r\ntheir names were Faith, Hope and Charity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POETIC FAULTS]\r\n\r\nConcerning his faults, perhaps the most illuminating thing that can be said\r\nis that critics emphasize and ordinary readers ignore them. The reason for\r\nthis is that every poem has two elements, form and content: a critic looks\r\nchiefly at the one, an ordinary reader at the other. Because the form of\r\nLongfellow's verse is often faulty it is easy to criticize him, to show\r\nthat he copies the work of others, that he lacks originality, that his\r\nfigures are often forced or questionable; but the reader, the young reader\r\nespecially, may be too much interested in the charm of the poet's story or\r\nthe truth of his sentiment to dissect his poetic figures. Thus, in the\r\nbest-known of his earlier poems, \"A Psalm of Life,\" he uses the famous\r\nmetaphor of \"footprints on the sands of time.\" That is so bad a figure that\r\nto analyze is to reject it; yet it never bothers young people, who would\r\nunderstand the poet and like him just as well even had he written\r\n\"signboards\" instead of \"footprints.\" The point is that Longfellow is so\r\nobviously a true and pleasant poet that his faults easily escape attention\r\nunless we look for them. There is perhaps no better summary of our poet's\r\nqualities than to record again the simple fact that he is the poet of young\r\npeople, to whom sentiment is the very breath of life. Should you ask the\r\nreason for his supremacy in this respect, the answer is a paradox.\r\nLongfellow was not an originator; he had no new song to sing, no new tale\r\nto tell. He was the poet of old heroes, old legends, old sentiments and\r\nideals. Therefore he is the poet of youth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER (1807-1892)\r\n\r\nThe strange mixture of warrior and peace lover in Whittier has led to a\r\nstrange misjudgment of his work. From the obscurity of a New England farm\r\nhe emerged as the champion of the Abolitionist party, and for thirty\r\ntumultuous years his poems were as war cries. By such work was he judged as\r\n\"the trumpeter of a cause,\" and the judgment stood between him and his\r\naudience when he sang not of a cause but of a country. Even at the present\r\ntime most critics speak of Whittier as \"the antislavery poet.\" Stedman, for\r\nexample, focuses our attention on certain lyrics of reform which he calls\r\n\"words wrung from the nation's heart\"; but the plain fact is that only a\r\nsmall part of the nation approved these lyrics or took any interest in the\r\npoet who wrote them.\r\n\r\nSuch was Whittier on one side, a militant poet of reform, sending forth\r\nverses that had the brattle of trumpets and the waving of banners in them:\r\n\r\n  Lift again the stately emblem on the Bay State's rusted shield,\r\n  Give to Northern winds the Pine Tree on our banner's tattered field.\r\n  Sons of men who sat in council with their Bibles round the board,\r\n  Answering England's royal missive with a firm, \"Thus saith the Lord!\"\r\n  Rise again for home and freedom! set the battle in array!\r\n  What the fathers did of old time we their sons must do to-day.\r\n\r\nOn the other side he was a Friend, or Quaker, and the peaceful spirit of\r\nhis people found expression in lyrics of faith that have no equal in our\r\npoetry. He was also a patriot to the core. He loved America with a profound\r\nlove; her ideals, her traditions, her epic history were in his blood, and\r\nhe glorified them in ballads and idyls that reflect the very spirit of\r\nbrave Colonial days. To judge Whittier as a trumpeter, therefore, is to\r\nneglect all that is important in his work; for his reform poems merely\r\nawaken the dying echoes of party clamor, while his ballads and idyls belong\r\nto the whole American people, and his hymns of faith to the wider audience\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. The span of Whittier's life was almost the span of the\r\n    nineteenth century. He was born (1807) in the homestead of his\r\n    ancestors at Haverhill, Massachusetts, and spent his formative\r\n    years working in the fields by day, reading beside the open fire at\r\n    night, and spending a few terms in a \"deestrict\" school presided\r\n    over by teachers who came or went with the spring. His schooling\r\n    was, therefore, of the scantiest kind; his real education came from\r\n    a noble home, from his country's history, from his toil and outdoor\r\n    life with its daily contact with nature. The love of home and of\r\n    homely virtues, the glorification of manhood and womanhood, the\r\n    pride of noble traditions, and always a background of meadow or\r\n    woodland or sounding sea,--these were the subjects of Whittier's\r\n    best verse, because these were the things he knew most intimately.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FIRST VERSES]\r\n\r\n    It was a song of Burns that first turned Whittier to poetry; but\r\n    hardly had he begun to write songs of his own when Garrison, the\r\n    antislavery agitator, turned his thought from the peaceful farm to\r\n    the clamoring world beyond. Attracted by certain verses (Whittier's\r\n    sister Elizabeth had sent them secretly to Garrison's paper) the\r\n    editor came over to see his contributor and found to his surprise a\r\n    country lad who was in evident need of education. Instead of asking\r\n    for more poetry, therefore, Garrison awakened the boy's ambition.\r\n    For two terms he attended the Haverhill Academy, supporting himself\r\n    meanwhile by making shoes. Then his labor was needed at home; but\r\n    finding his health too delicate for farm work he chose other\r\n    occupations and contributed manfully to the support of his family.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER]\r\n\r\n    For several years thereafter Whittier was like a man trying to find\r\n    himself. He did factory work; he edited newspapers; he showed a\r\n    talent for political leadership; he made poems which he sold at a\r\n    price to remind him of what he had once received for making shoes.\r\n    While poetry and politics both called to him alluringly a crisis\r\n    arose; Garrison summoned him; and with a sad heart, knowing that he\r\n    left all hope of political or literary success behind, he went over\r\n    to the Abolitionist party. That was in 1833, when Whittier was\r\n    twenty-six years old. At that time the Abolitionists were detested\r\n    in the North as well as in the South, and to join them was to\r\n    become an outcast.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: STORM AND STRESS]\r\n\r\n    Then came the militant period of Whittier's life. He became editor\r\n    of antislavery journals; he lectured in the cause; he was stoned\r\n    for his utterances; his printing shop was burned by a mob.\r\n    Meanwhile his poems were sounding abroad like trumpet blasts,\r\n    making friends, making enemies. It was a passionate age, when\r\n    political enemies were hated like Hessians, but Whittier was always\r\n    chivalrous with his opponents. Read his \"Randolph of Roanoke\" for a\r\n    specific example. His \"Laus Deo\" (1865), a chant of exultation\r\n    written when he heard the bells ringing the news of the\r\n    constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery, was the last poem of\r\n    this period of storm and stress.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OAK KNOLL, WHITTIER'S HOME, DANVERS, MASSACHUSETTS]\r\n\r\n    In the following year Whittier produced _Snow-Bound_, his\r\n    masterpiece. Though he had been writing for half a century, he had\r\n    never won either fame or money by his verse; but the publication of\r\n    this beautiful idyl placed him in the front rank of American poets.\r\n    Thereafter he was a national figure, and the magazines which once\r\n    scorned his verses were now most eager to print them. So he made an\r\n    end of the poverty which had been his portion since childhood.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PEACEFUL YEARS]\r\n\r\n    For the remainder of his life he lived serenely at Amesbury, for\r\n    the most part, in a modest house presided over by a relative. He\r\n    wrote poetry now more carefully, for a wider audience, and every\r\n    few years saw another little volume added to his store: _Ballads\r\n    of New England_, _Miriam and Other Poems_, _Hazel\r\n    Blossoms_, _Poems of Nature_, _St. Gregory's Quest_,\r\n    _At Sundown_. When he died (1892) he was honored not so widely\r\n    perhaps as Longfellow, but more deeply, as we honor those whose\r\n    peace has been won through manful strife. Holmes, the ready poet of\r\n    all occasions, expressed a formal but sincere judgment in the\r\n    lines:\r\n\r\n      Best loved and saintliest of our singing train,\r\n        Earth's noblest tributes to thy name belong:\r\n      A lifelong record closed without a stain,\r\n        A blameless memory shrined in deathless song.\r\n\r\nEARLIER WORKS. [Footnote: Though we are concerned here with Whittier's\r\npoetry, we should at least mention certain of his prose works, such as\r\n_Legends of New England_, _Leaves from Margaret Smith's Journal_\r\nand _Old Portraits and Modern Sketches_. The chief value of these is\r\nin their pictures of Colonial life.] In Whittier's poetry we note three\r\ndistinct stages, and note also that he was on the wrong trail until he\r\nfollowed his own spirit. His earliest work was inspired by Burns, but this\r\nwas of no consequence. Next he fell under the spell of Scott and wrote\r\n\"Mogg Megone\" and \"The Bridal of Pennacook.\" These Indian romances in verse\r\nare too much influenced by Scott's border poems and also by sentimental\r\nnovels of savage life, such as Mrs. Child's _Hobomok_; they do not\r\nring true, and in this respect are like almost everything else in\r\nliterature on the subject of the Indians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REFORM POEMS]\r\n\r\nIn _Voices of Freedom_ (1849) and other poems inspired by the\r\nantislavery campaign Whittier for the first time came close to his own age.\r\nHe was no longer an echo but a voice, a man's voice, shouting above a\r\ntumult. He spoke not for the nation but for a party; and it was inevitable\r\nthat his reform lyrics should fall into neglect with the occasions that\r\ncalled them forth. They are interesting now not as poems but as sidelights\r\non a critical period of our history. Their intensely passionate quality\r\nappears in \"Faneuil Hall,\" \"Song of the Free,\" \"The Pine Tree,\" \"Randolph\r\nof Roanoke\" and \"The Farewell of an Indian Slave Mother.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a fine swinging rhythm in these poems, in \"Massachusetts to\r\nVirginia\" especially, which recalls Macaulay's \"Armada\"; and two of them at\r\nleast show astonishing power and vitality. One is \"Laus Deo,\" to which we\r\nhave referred in our story of the poet's life. The other is \"Ichabod\"\r\n(1850), written after the \"Seventh of March Speech\" of Webster, when that\r\nstatesman seemed to have betrayed the men who elected and trusted him.\r\nSurprise, anger, scorn, indignation, sorrow,--all these emotions were\r\nloosed in a flood after Webster's speech; but Whittier waited till he had\r\nfused them into one emotion, and when his slow words fell at last they fell\r\nwith the weight of judgment and the scorching of fire upon their victim. If\r\nwords could kill a man, these surely are the words. \"Ichabod\" is the most\r\npowerful poem of its kind in our language; but it is fearfully unjust to\r\nWebster. Those who read it should read also \"The Lost Occasion,\" written\r\nthirty years later, which Whittier placed next to \"Ichabod\" in the final\r\nedition of his poems. So he tried to right a wrong (unfortunately after the\r\nvictim was dead) by offering generous tribute to the statesman he had once\r\nmisjudged.\r\n\r\nBALLADS AND AMERICAN IDYLS. Whittier's manly heart and his talent for\r\nflowing verse made him an excellent ballad writer; but his work in this\r\nfield is so different from that of his predecessors that he came near to\r\ninventing a new type of poetry. Thus, many of the old ballads celebrate the\r\nbravery that mounts with fighting; but Whittier always lays emphasis on the\r\nhigher quality that we call moral courage. \"Barclay of Ury\" will illustrate\r\nour criticism: the verse has a martial swing; the hero is a veteran who has\r\nknown the lust of battle; but his courage now appears in self-mastery, in\r\nthe ability to bear in silence the jeers of a mob. Again, the old ballad\r\naims to tell a story, nothing else, and drives straight to its mark; but\r\nWhittier portrays the whole landscape and background of the action. He\r\ndeals largely with Colonial life in New England, and his descriptions of\r\nplace and people are unrivaled in our poetry. Read one of his typical\r\nballads, \"The Wreck of Rivermouth\" or \"The Witch's Daughter\" or \"The\r\nGarrison of Cape Ann\" or \"Skipper Ireson's Ride,\" and see how closely he\r\nidentifies himself with the place and time of his story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET IN OLD MARBLEHEAD\r\nSkipper Ireson's home on extreme right]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PATRIOTIC QUALITY]\r\n\r\nThere is one quality, however, in which our Quaker poet resembles the old\r\nballad makers, namely, his intense patriotism, and this recalls the fact\r\nthat ballads were the first histories, the first expression not only of\r\nbrave deeds but of the national pride which the deeds symbolized. Though\r\nWhittier keeps himself modestly in the background, as a story teller ought\r\nto do, he can never quite repress the love of his native land or the\r\nquickened heartbeats that set his verse marching as if to the drums. This\r\npatriotism, though intense, was never intolerant but rather sympathetic\r\nwith men of other lands, as appears in \"The Pipes at Lucknow\", a ballad\r\ndealing with a dramatic incident of the Sepoy Rebellion. The Scotsman who\r\ncould read that ballad unmoved, without a kindling of the eye or a stirring\r\nof the heart, would be unworthy of his clan or country.\r\n\r\nEven better than Whittier's ballads are certain narrative poems reflecting\r\nthe life of simple people, to which we give the name of idyls. \"Telling the\r\nBees,\" \"In School Days,\" \"My Playmate,\" \"Maud Muller,\" \"The Barefoot\r\nBoy,\"--there are no other American poems quite like these, none so tender,\r\nnone written with such perfect sympathy. Some of them are like photographs;\r\nand the lens that gathered them was not a glass but a human heart. Others\r\nsing the emotion of love as only Whittier, the Galahad of poets, could have\r\nsung it,--as in this stanza from \"A Sea Dream\":\r\n\r\n  Draw near, more near, forever dear!\r\n    Where'er I rest or roam,\r\n  Or in the city's crowded streets,\r\n    Or by the blown sea foam,\r\n    The thought of thee is home!\r\n\r\nSNOW-BOUND. The best of Whittier's idyls is _Snow-Bound_ (1866), into\r\nwhich he gathered a boy's tenderest memories. In naming this as the best\r\npoem in the language on the subject of home we do not offer a criticism but\r\nan invitation. Because all that is best in human life centers in the ideal\r\nof home, and because Whittier reflected that ideal in a beautiful way,\r\n_Snow-Bound_ should be read if we read nothing else of American\r\npoetry. There is perhaps only one thing to prevent this idyl from becoming\r\na universal poem: its natural setting can be appreciated only by those who\r\nlive within the snow line, who have seen the white flakes gather and drift,\r\nconfining every family to the circle of its own hearth fire in what Emerson\r\ncalls \"the tumultuous privacy of storm.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of the poem is simplicity itself. It opens with a description of a\r\nsnowstorm that thickens with the December night. The inmates of an old\r\nfarmhouse gather about the open fire, and Whittier describes them one by\r\none, how they looked to the boy (for _Snow-Bound_ is a recollection of\r\nboyhood), and what stories they told to reveal their interests. The rest of\r\nthe poem is a reverie, as of one no longer a boy, who looks into his fire\r\nand sees not the fire-pictures but those other scenes or portraits that are\r\ngraved deep in every human heart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARM OF SNOW-BOUND]\r\n\r\nTo praise such a work is superfluous, and to criticize its artless\r\nsincerity is beyond our ability. Many good writers have explained the poem;\r\nyet still its deepest charm escapes analysis, perhaps because it has no\r\nname. The best criticism that the present writer ever heard on the subject\r\ncame from a Habitant farmer in the Province of Quebec, a simple, unlettered\r\nman, who was a poet at heart but who would have been amazed had anyone told\r\nhim so. His children, who were learning English literature through the\r\nhappy medium of _Evangeline_ and _Snow-Bound_, brought the latter\r\npoem home from school, and the old man would sit smoking his pipe and\r\nlistening to the story. When they read of the winter scenes, of the fire\r\nroaring its defiance up the chimney-throat at the storm without,\r\n\r\n  What matter how the night behaved?\r\n  What matter how the north-wind raved?\r\n  Blow high, blow low, not all its snow\r\n  Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow,--\r\n\r\nthen he would stir in his chair, make his pipe glow fiercely, and blow a\r\ncloud of smoke about his head. But in the following scene, with its\r\nmemories of the dead and its immortal hope, he would sit very still, as if\r\nlistening to exquisite music. When asked why he liked the poem his face\r\nlighted: \"W'y I lak heem, M'sieu Whittier? I lak heem 'cause he speak de\r\ntrue. He know de storm, and de leetle _cabane_, and heart of de boy\r\nan' hees moder. _Oui, oui_, he know de man also.\"\r\n\r\nNature, home, the heart of a boy and a man and a mother,--the poet who can\r\nreflect such elemental matters so that the simple of earth understand and\r\nlove their beauty deserves the critic's best tribute of silence.\r\n\r\nPOEMS OF FAITH AND NATURE. Aside from the reform poems it is hard to group\r\nWhittier's works, which are all alike in that they portray familiar scenes\r\nagainst a natural background. In his _Tent on the Beach_ (1867) he\r\nattempted a collection of tales in the manner of Longfellow's _Wayside\r\nInn_, but of these only one or two ballads, such as \"Abraham Davenport\"\r\nand \"The Wreck of Rivermouth,\" are now treasured. The best part of the book\r\nis the \"Prelude,\" which pictures the poet among his friends and records his\r\nimpressions of sky and sea and shore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TWO VIEWS OF NATURE]\r\n\r\nThe outdoor poems of Whittier are interesting, aside from their own beauty,\r\nas suggesting two poetic conceptions of nature which have little in common.\r\nThe earlier regards nature as a mistress to be loved or a divinity to be\r\nworshiped for her own sake; she has her own laws or mercies, and man is but\r\none of her creatures. The Anglo-Saxon scops viewed nature in this way; so\r\ndid Bryant, in whose \"Forest Hymn\" is the feeling of primitive ages. Many\r\nmodern poets (and novelists also, like Scott and Cooper) have outgrown this\r\nconception; they regard nature as a kind of stage for the drama of human\r\nlife, which is all-important.\r\n\r\nWhittier belongs to this later school; he portrays nature magnificently,\r\nbut always as the background for some human incident, sad or tender or\r\nheroic, which appears to us more real because viewed in its natural\r\nsetting. Note in \"The Wreck of Rivermouth,\" for example, how the merry\r\nparty in their sailboat, the mowers on the salt marshes, the \"witch\"\r\nmumbling her warning, the challenge of a careless girl, the skipper's fear,\r\nthe river, the breeze, the laughing sea,--everything is exactly as it\r\nshould be. It is this humanized view of the natural world which makes\r\nWhittier's ballads unique and which gives deeper meaning to his \"Hampton\r\nBeach,\" \"Among the Hills,\" \"Trailing Arbutus,\" \"The Vanishers\" and other of\r\nhis best nature poems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHITTIER'S CREED]\r\n\r\nOur reading of Whittier should not end until we are familiar with \"The\r\nEternal Goodness,\" \"Trust,\" \"My Soul and I,\" \"The Prayer of Agassiz\" and a\r\nfew more of his hymns of faith. Our appreciation of such hymns will be more\r\nsympathetic if we remember, first, that Whittier came of ancestors whose\r\nsouls approved the opening proposition of the Declaration of Independence;\r\nand second, that he belonged to the Society of Friends, who believed that\r\nGod revealed himself directly to every human soul (the \"inner light\" they\r\ncalled it), and that a man's primal responsibility was to God and his own\r\nconscience. The creed of Whittier may therefore be summarized in two\r\narticles: \"I believe in the Divine love and in the equality of men.\" The\r\nlatter article appears in all his poems; the former is crystallized in \"The\r\nEternal Goodness,\" a hymn so trustful and reverent that it might well be\r\nthe evensong of humanity.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF WHITTIER. One may summarize Whittier in the statement\r\nthat he is the poet of the home and the hills, and of that freedom without\r\nwhich the home loses its chief joy and the hill its inspiration. In writing\r\nof such themes Whittier failed to win the highest honors of a poet; and the\r\nfailure was due not to his lack of culture, as is sometimes alleged (for\r\nthere is no other culture equal to right living), but rather to the stern\r\nconditions of his life, to his devotion to duty, to his struggle for\r\nliberty, to his lifelong purpose of helping men by his singing. Great poems\r\nare usually the result of seclusion, of aloofness, but Whittier was always\r\na worker in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NATURAL SINGER]\r\n\r\nHis naturalness is perhaps his best poetic virtue. There is in his verse a\r\nspontaneous \"singing\" quality which leaves the impression that poetry was\r\nhis native language. It is easy to understand why Burns first attracted\r\nhim, for both poets were natural singers who remind us of what Bede wrote\r\nof Cædmon: \"He learned not the art of poetry from men.\" Next to his\r\nspontaneity is his rare simplicity, his gift of speaking straight from a\r\nheart that never grew old. Sometimes his simplicity is as artless as that\r\nof a child, as in \"Maud Muller\"; generally it is noble, as in his modest\r\n\"Proem\" to _Voices of Freedom_; occasionally it is passionate, as in\r\nthe exultant cry of \"Laus Deo\"; and at times it rises to the simplicity of\r\npure art, as in \"Telling the Bees.\" The last-named poem portrays an old\r\nColonial custom which provided that when death came to a farmhouse the bees\r\nmust be told and their hives draped in mourning. It portrays also, as a\r\nperfect, natural background, the path to Whittier's home and his sister's\r\nold-fashioned flower garden, in which the daffodils still bloom where she\r\nplanted them long ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAN AND THE POET]\r\n\r\nThat Whittier was not a great poet, as the critics assure us, may be\r\nfrankly admitted. That he had elements of greatness is also without\r\nquestion; and precisely for this reason, because his power is so often\r\nmanifest in noble or exquisite passages, there is disappointment in reading\r\nhim when we stumble upon bad rimes, careless workmanship, mishandling of\r\nhis native speech. Our experience here is probably like that of Whittier's\r\nfriend Garrison. The latter had read certain poems that attracted him; he\r\ncame quickly to see the poet; and out from under the barn, his clothes\r\nsprinkled with hayseed, crawled a shy country lad who explained bashfully\r\nthat he had been hunting hens' nests. Anything could be forgiven after\r\nthat; interest in the boy would surely temper criticism of the poet.\r\n\r\nEven so our present criticism of Whittier's verse must include certain\r\nconsiderations of the man who wrote it: that he smacked of his native soil;\r\nthat his education was scanty and hardly earned; that he used words as his\r\nfather and mother used them, and was not ashamed of their rural accent. His\r\nown experience, moreover, had weathered him until he seemed part of a\r\nrugged landscape. He knew life, and he loved it. He had endured poverty,\r\nand glorified it. He had been farm hand, shoemaker, self-supporting\r\nstudent, editor of country newspapers, local politician, champion of\r\nslaves, worker for reform, defender of a hopeless cause that by the awful\r\njudgment of war became a winning cause. And always and everywhere he had\r\nbeen a man, one who did his duty as he saw it, spake truth as he believed\r\nit, and kept his conscience clean, his heart pure, his faith unshaken. All\r\nthis was in his verse and ennobled even his faults, which were part of his\r\nplain humanity. As Longfellow was by study of European literatures the poet\r\nof books and culture, so Whittier was by experience the poet of life. The\r\nhomely quality of his verse, which endears it to common men, is explained\r\non the ground that he was nearer than any other American poet to the body\r\nand soul of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL (1819-1891)\r\n\r\nThe work of Lowell is unusual and his rank or position hard to define.\r\nThough never a great or even a popular writer, he was regarded for a\r\nconsiderable part of his life as the most prominent man of letters in\r\nAmerica. At the present time his reputation is still large, but historians\r\nfind it somewhat easier to praise his works than to read them. As poet,\r\ncritic, satirist, editor and teacher he loomed as a giant among his\r\ncontemporaries, overtopping Whittier and Longfellow at one time; but he\r\nleft no work comparable to _Snow-Bound_ or _Hiawatha_, and one is\r\npuzzled to name any of his poems or essays that are fairly certain to give\r\npleasure. To read his volumes is to meet a man of power and brilliant\r\npromise, but the final impression is that the promise was not fulfilled,\r\nthat the masterpiece of which Lowell was capable was left unwritten.\r\n\r\n    BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. Lowell came from a distinguished family that\r\n    had \"made history\" in America. His father was a cultured clergyman;\r\n    he grew up in a beautiful home, \"Elmwood,\" in the college town of\r\n    Cambridge; among his first companions were the noble books that\r\n    filled the shelves of the family library. From the beginning,\r\n    therefore, he was inclined to letters; and though he often turned\r\n    aside for other matters, his first and last love was the love of\r\n    poetry.\r\n\r\n    At fifteen he entered Harvard, where he read almost everything, he\r\n    said, except the books prescribed by the faculty. Then he studied\r\n    law and opened an office in Boston, where he found few clients,\r\n    being more interested in writing verses than in his profession.\r\n    With his marriage in 1844 the first strong purpose seems to have\r\n    entered his indolent life. His wife was zealous in good works, and\r\n    presently Lowell, who had gayly satirized all reformers, joined in\r\n    the antislavery campaign and proceeded to make as many enemies as\r\n    friends by his reform poems.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: VARIED TASKS]\r\n\r\n    Followed then a period of hard, purposeful work, during which he\r\n    supported himself by editing _The Pennsylvania Freeman_ and by\r\n    writing for the magazines. In 1848, his banner year, he published\r\n    his best volume of _Poems_, _Sir Launfal_, _A Fable for\r\n    Critics_ and the first series of _The Biglow Papers_. It\r\n    was not these volumes, however, but a series of brilliant lectures\r\n    on the English poets that caused Lowell to be called to the chair\r\n    in Harvard which Longfellow had resigned. He prepared for this work\r\n    by studying abroad, and for some twenty years thereafter he gave\r\n    courses in English, Italian, Spanish and German literatures. For a\r\n    part of this time he was also editor in turn of _The Atlantic\r\n    Monthly_ and _The North American Review_.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LIFE ABROAD]\r\n\r\n    In the simpler days of the republic, when the first question asked\r\n    of a diplomat was not whether he had money enough to entertain\r\n    society in a proper style, the profession of letters was honored by\r\n    sending literary men to represent America in foreign courts, and\r\n    Lowell's prominence was recognized by his appointment as ambassador\r\n    to Spain (1877) and to England (1880). It was in this patriotic\r\n    service abroad that he won his greatest honors. In London\r\n    especially he made his power felt as an American who loved his\r\n    country, as a democrat who believed in democracy, and as a cultured\r\n    gentleman who understood Anglo-Saxon life because of his\r\n    familiarity with the poetry in which that life is most clearly\r\n    reflected. Next to keeping silence about his proper business,\r\n    perhaps the chief requirement of an ambassador is to make speeches\r\n    about everything else, and no other foreign speaker was ever\r\n    listened to with more pleasure than the witty and cultured Lowell.\r\n    One who summed up his diplomatic triumph said tersely that he found\r\n    the Englishmen strangers and left them all cousins.\r\n\r\n    He was recalled from this service in 1885. The remainder of his\r\n    life was spent teaching at Harvard, writing more poetry and editing\r\n    his numerous works. His first volume of poems, _A Year's\r\n    Life_, was published in 1841; his last volume, _Heartsease and\r\n    Rue_, appeared almost half a century later, in 1888. That his\r\n    death occurred in the same house in which he was born and in which\r\n    he had spent the greater part of his life is an occurrence so rare\r\n    in America that it deserves a poem of commemoration.\r\n\r\nLOWELL'S POETRY. There are golden grains everywhere in Lowell's verse but\r\nnever a continuous vein of metal. In other words, even his best work is\r\nnotable for occasional lines rather than for sustained excellence. As a\r\nspecific example study the \"Commemoration Ode,\" one of the finest poems\r\ninspired by the Civil War. The occasion of this ode, to commemorate the\r\ncollege students who had given their lives for their country, was all that\r\na poet might wish; the brilliant audience that gathered at Cambridge was\r\nmost inspiring; and beyond that local audience stood a nation in mourning,\r\na nation which had just lost a million of its sons in a mighty conflict. It\r\nwas such an occasion as Lowell loved, and one who reads the story of his\r\nlife knows how earnestly he strove to meet it. When the reading of his poem\r\nwas finished his audience called it \"a noble effort,\" and that is precisely\r\nthe trouble with the famous ode; it is too plainly an effort. It does not\r\nsing, does not overflow from a full heart, does not speak the inevitable,\r\nsatisfying word. In consequence (and perhaps this criticism applies to most\r\nambitious odes) we are rather glad when the \"effort\" is at an end. Yet\r\nthere are excellent passages in the poem, notably the sixth and the last\r\nstanzas, one with its fine tribute to Lincoln, the other expressive of\r\ndeathless loyalty to one's native land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LYRICS]\r\n\r\nThe best of Lowell's lyrics may be grouped in two classes, the first\r\ndealing with his personal joy or grief, the second with the feelings of the\r\nnation. Typical of the former are \"The First Snowfall\" and a few other\r\nlyrics reflecting the poet's sorrow for the loss of a little\r\ndaughter,--simple, human poems, in refreshing contrast with most others of\r\nLowell, which strive for brilliancy. The best of the national lyrics is\r\n\"The Present Crisis\" (1844). This was at first a party poem, a ringing\r\nappeal issued during the turmoil occasioned by the annexation of Texas; but\r\nnow, with the old party issues forgotten, we can all read it with pleasure\r\nas a splendid expression of the American heart and will in every crisis of\r\nour national history.\r\n\r\nIn the nature lyrics we have a double reflection, one of the external\r\nworld, the other of a poet who could not be single-minded, and who was\r\nalways confusing his own impressions of nature or humanity with those other\r\nimpressions which he found reflected in poetry. Read the charming \"To a\r\nDandelion,\" for example, and note how Lowell cannot be content with his\r\n\r\n  Dear common flower that grow'st beside the way,\r\n  Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold,\r\n\r\nbut must bring in Eldorado and twenty other poetic allusions to glorify a\r\nflower which has no need of external glory. Then for comparison read\r\nBryant's \"Fringed Gentian\" and see how the elder poet, content with the\r\nflower itself, tells you very simply how its beauty appeals to him. Or read\r\n\"An Indian-Summer Reverie\" with its scattered lines of gold, and note how\r\nLowell cannot say what he feels in his own heart but must search everywhere\r\nfor poetic images; and then, because he cannot find exactly what he seeks\r\nor, more likely, because he finds a dozen tempting allusions where one is\r\nplenty, he goes on and on in a vain quest that ends by leaving himself and\r\nhis reader unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR LAUNFAL]\r\n\r\nThe most popular of Lowell's works is _The Vision of Sir Launfal_\r\n(1848), in which he invents an Arthurian kind of legend of the search for\r\nthe Holy Grail. Most of his long poems are labored, but this seems to have\r\nbeen written in a moment of inspiration. The \"Prelude\" begins almost\r\nspontaneously, and when it reaches the charming passage \"And what is so\r\nrare as a day in June?\" the verse fairly begins to sing,--a rare occurrence\r\nwith Lowell. Critical readers may reasonably object to the poet's\r\nmoralizing, to his imperfect lines and to his setting of an Old World\r\nlegend of knights and castles in a New World landscape; but uncritical\r\nreaders rejoice in a moral feeling that is fine and true, and are content\r\nwith a good story and a good landscape without inquiring whether the two\r\nbelong together. Moreover, _Sir Launfal_ certainly serves the first\r\npurpose of poetry in that it gives pleasure and so deserves its continued\r\npopularity among young readers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SATIRES]\r\n\r\nTwo satiric poems that were highly prized when they were first published,\r\nand that are still formally praised by historians who do not read them, are\r\n_A Fable for Critics_ and _The Biglow Papers_. The former is a\r\nseries of doggerel verses filled with grotesque puns and quips aimed at\r\nAmerican authors who were prominent in 1848. The latter, written in a\r\ntortured, \"Yankee\" dialect, is made up of political satires and conceits\r\noccasioned by the Mexican and Civil wars. Both works contain occasional\r\nfine lines and a few excellent criticisms of literature or politics, but\r\nfew young readers will have patience to sift out the good passages from the\r\nmass of glittering rubbish in which they are hidden.\r\n\r\nMuch more worthy of the reader's attention are certain neglected works,\r\nsuch as Lowell's sonnets, his \"Prometheus,\" \"Columbus,\" \"Agassiz,\"\r\n\"Portrait of Dante,\" \"Washers of the Shroud,\" \"Under the Old Elm\" (with its\r\nnoble tribute to Washington) and \"Stanzas on Freedom,\" It is a pity that\r\nsuch poems, all of which contain memorable lines, should be kept from the\r\nwide audience they deserve, and largely because of the author's\r\ndigressiveness. To examine them is to conclude that, like most of Lowell's\r\nworks, they are not simple enough in feeling to win ordinary readers, like\r\nthe poetry of Longfellow, and not perfect enough in form to excite the\r\nadmiration of critics, like the best of Poe's melodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWELL'S HOUSE, CAMBRIDGE, IN WINTER]\r\n\r\nLOWELL'S PROSE. In brilliancy at least Lowell has no peer among American\r\nessayists, though others excel him in the better qualities of originality\r\nor charm or vigor. The best of his prose works are the scintillating essays\r\ncollected in _My Study Window_ and _Among My Books_. In his\r\npolitical essays he looked at humanity with his own eyes, but the titles of\r\nthe volumes just named indicate his chief interest as a prose writer, which\r\nwas to interpret the world's books rather than the world's throbbing life.\r\nFor younger readers the most pleasing of the prose works are the\r\ncomparatively simple sketches, \"My Garden Acquaintance,\" \"Cambridge Thirty\r\nYears Ago\" and \"On a Certain Condescension in Foreigners.\" In these\r\nsketches we meet the author at his best, alert, witty and so widely read\r\nthat he cannot help giving literary flavor to whatever he writes. Among the\r\nbest of his essays on literary subjects are those on Chaucer, Dante Keats,\r\nWalton and Emerson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALITY OF THE ESSAYS]\r\n\r\nOne who reads a typical collection of Lowell's essays is apt to be divided\r\nbetween open admiration and something akin to resentment. On the one hand\r\nthey are brilliant, stimulating, filled with \"good things\"; on the other\r\nthey are always digressive, sometimes fantastic and too often\r\nself-conscious; that is, they call our attention to the author rather than\r\nto his proper subject. When he writes of Dante he is concerned to reveal\r\nthe soul of the Italian master; but when he writes of Milton he seems\r\nchiefly intent on showing how much more he knows than the English editor of\r\nMilton's works. When he presents Emerson he tries to make us know and\r\nadmire the Concord sage; but when he falls foul of Emerson's friends,\r\nThoreau and Carlyle, his personal prejudices are more in evidence than his\r\nimpersonal judgment. In consequence, some of the literary essays are a\r\nbetter reflection of Lowell himself than of the men he wrote about.\r\n\r\nAn author must be finally measured, however, by his finest work, by his\r\nconstant purpose rather than by his changing mood; and the finest work of\r\nLowell, his critical studies of the elder poets and dramatists, are perhaps\r\nthe most solid and the most penetrating that our country has to show. He\r\ncertainly kept \"the great tradition\" in criticism, a tradition which\r\nenjoins us, in simple language, to seek only the best and to reverence it\r\nwhen we find it. As he wrote:\r\n\r\n  Great truths are portions of the soul of man;\r\n  Great souls are portions of eternity;\r\n  Each drop of blood that e'er through true heart ran\r\n  With lofty message, ran for thee and me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOLIVER WENDELL HOLMES (1809-1894)\r\n\r\nIt is a sad fate for a writer to be known as a humorist; nobody will take\r\nhim seriously ever afterward. Even a book suffers from such a reputation,\r\nthe famous _Don Quixote_ for example, which we read as a type of\r\nextravagant humor but which is in reality a tragedy, since it portrays the\r\ndisillusionment of a man who believed the world to be like his own heart,\r\nnoble and chivalrous, and who found it filled with villainy. Because Holmes\r\n(who was essentially a moralist and a preacher) could not repress the\r\nbubbling wit that was part of his nature, our historians must set him down\r\nas a humorist and name the \"One-Hoss Shay\" as his most typical work. Yet\r\nhis best poems are as pathetic as \"The Last Leaf,\" as sentimental as \"The\r\nVoiceless,\" as patriotic as \"Old Ironsides,\" as worshipful as the \"Hymn of\r\nTrust,\" as nobly didactic as \"The Chambered Nautilus\"; his novels are\r\nstudies of the obscure problems of heredity, and his most characteristic\r\nprose work, _The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table_, is an original\r\ncommentary on almost everything under the sun.\r\n\r\nEvidently we prize a laugh above any other product of literature, and\r\nbecause there is a laugh or a smile hidden in many a work of Holmes he must\r\nstill keep the place assigned to him as an \"American\" humorist. Even so, he\r\nis perhaps our most representative writer in this field; for he is as\r\nthoroughly American as a man can be, and his rare culture and kindness are\r\nin refreshing contrast to the crude horseplay or sensationalism that is\r\nunfortunately trumpeted abroad as New World humor.\r\n\r\n    A PLACID LIFE. Though Holmes never wrote a formal autobiography he\r\n    left a very good reflection of himself in his works, and it is in\r\n    these alone that we become acquainted with him,--a genial, witty,\r\n    observant, kind-hearted and pure-hearted man whom it is good to\r\n    know.\r\n\r\n    He belonged to what he called \"the Brahmin caste\" of intellectual\r\n    aristocrats (as described in his novel, _Elsie Venner_), for\r\n    he came from an old New England family extending back to Anne\r\n    Bradstreet and the governors of the Bay Colony. He was born in\r\n    Cambridge; he was educated at Andover and Harvard; he spent his\r\n    life in Boston, a city which satisfied him so completely that he\r\n    called it \"the hub of the solar system.\" Most ambitious writers\r\n    like a large field with plenty of change or variety, but Holmes was\r\n    content with a small and very select circle with himself at the\r\n    center of it.\r\n\r\n    For his profession he chose medicine and studied it four years, the\r\n    latter half of the time in Paris. At that period his foreign\r\n    training was as rare in medicine as was Longfellow's in poetry. He\r\n    practiced his profession in Boston and managed to make a success of\r\n    it, though patients were a little doubtful of a doctor who wrote\r\n    poetry and who opened his office with the remark that \"small\r\n    fevers\" would be \"gratefully received.\" Also he was for thirty-five\r\n    years professor of anatomy at the Harvard Medical School. What with\r\n    healing or teaching or learning, this doctor might have been very\r\n    busy; but he seems to have found plenty of leisure for writing, and\r\n    the inclination was always present. \"Whoso has once tasted type\" he\r\n    said, \"must indulge the taste to the end of his life.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE WRITER]\r\n\r\n    His literary work began at twenty-one, when he wrote \"Old\r\n    Ironsides\" in protest against the order to dismantle the frigate\r\n    _Constitution_, which had made naval history in the War of\r\n    1812. That first poem, which still rings triumphantly in our ears,\r\n    accomplished two things: it saved the glorious old warship, and it\r\n    gave Holmes a hold on public attention which he never afterward\r\n    lost. During the next twenty-five years he wrote poetry, and was so\r\n    much in demand to furnish verses for special occasions that he was\r\n    a kind of poet-laureate of his college and city. He was almost\r\n    fifty when the _Atlantic Monthly_ was projected and Lowell\r\n    demanded, as a condition of his editorship, that Holmes be engaged\r\n    as the first contributor. Feeling in the mood for talk, as he\r\n    commonly did, Holmes responded with _The Autocrat_. Thereafter\r\n    he wrote chiefly in prose, making his greatest effort in fiction\r\n    but winning more readers by his table talk in the form of essays.\r\n    His last volume, _Over the Teacups_, appeared when he was past\r\n    eighty years old.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: PET PREJUDICES]\r\n\r\n    We have spoken of the genial quality of Holmes as revealed in his\r\n    work, but we would hardly be just to him did we fail to note his\r\n    pet prejudices, his suspicion of reformers, his scorn of\r\n    homeopathic doctors, his violent antipathy to Calvinism. Though he\r\n    had been brought up in the Calvinistic faith (his father was an\r\n    old-style clergyman), he seemed to delight in clubbing or\r\n    satirizing or slinging stones at it. The very mildest he could do\r\n    was to refer to \"yon whey-faced brother\" to express his opinion of\r\n    those who still clung to puritanic doctrines. Curiously enough, he\r\n    still honored his father and was proud of his godly ancestors, who\r\n    were all stanch Puritans. The explanation is, of course, that\r\n    Holmes never understood theology, not for a moment; he only\r\n    disliked it, and was consequently sure that it must be wrong and\r\n    that somebody ought to put an end to it. In later years he mellowed\r\n    somewhat. One cannot truthfully say that he overcame his prejudice,\r\n    but he understood men better and was inclined to include even\r\n    reformers and Calvinists in what he called \"the larger humanity\r\n    into which I was born so long ago.\"\r\n\r\nWORKS OF HOLMES. In the field of \"occasional\" poetry, written to celebrate\r\nbirths, dedications, feasts and festivals of every kind, Holmes has never\r\nhad a peer among his countrymen. He would have made a perfect\r\npoet-laureate, for he seemed to rise to every occasion and have on his lips\r\nthe right word to express the feeling of the moment, whether of patriotism\r\nor sympathy or sociability. In such happy poems as \"The Boys,\" \"Bill and\r\nJo,\" \"All Here\" and nearly forty others written for his class reunions he\r\nreflects the spirit of college men who gather annually to live the \"good\r\nold days\" over again. [Footnote: It may add a bit of interest to these\r\npoems if we remember that among the members of the Class of '29 was Samuel\r\nSmith, author of \"America,\" a poem that now appeals to a larger audience\r\nthan the class poet ever dreamed of.] He wrote also some seventy other\r\npoems for special occasions, the quality of which may be judged from \"Old\r\nIronsides,\" \"Under the Violets,\" \"Grandmother's Story\" and numerous\r\nappreciations of Lowell, Burns, Bryant, Whittier and other well-known\r\npoets.\r\n\r\nAmong poems of more general interest the best is \"The Chambered Nautilus,\"\r\nwhich some read for its fine moral lesson and others for its beautiful\r\nsymbolism or almost perfect workmanship. Others that deserve to be\r\nremembered are \"The Last Leaf\" (Lincoln's favorite), \"Nearing the Snow\r\nLine,\" \"Meeting of the Alumni,\" \"Questions and Answers\" and \"The\r\nVoiceless,\"--none great poems but all good and very well worth the reading.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUMOROUS POEMS]\r\n\r\n\"The Deacon's Masterpiece, or the Wonderful One-Hoss Shay\" is the most\r\npopular of the humorous poems. Many readers enjoy this excellent skit\r\nwithout thinking what the author meant by calling it \"a logical story.\" It\r\nis, in fact, the best pebble that he hurled from his sling against his\r\n_bête noire_; for the old \"shay\" which went to pieces all at once was\r\na symbol of Calvinistic theology. That theology was called an iron chain of\r\nlogic, every link so perfectly forged that it could not be broken at any\r\npoint. Even so was the \"shay\" built, unbreakable in every single part; but\r\nwhen the deacon finds himself sprawling and dumfounded in the road beside\r\nthe wrecked masterpiece the poet concludes:\r\n\r\n  End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.\r\n  Logic is logic. That's all I say.\r\n\r\nOther typical verses of the same kind are \"The Height of the Ridiculous,\"\r\n\"Daily Trials,\" \"The Comet\" and \"Contentment.\" In the last-named poem\r\nHolmes may have been poking fun at the Brook Farmers and other enthusiasts\r\nwho were preaching the simple life. Poets and preachers of this gospel in\r\nevery age are apt to insist that to find simplicity one must return to\r\nnature or the farm, or else camp in the woods and eat huckleberries, as\r\nThoreau did; but Holmes remembered that some people must live in the city,\r\nwhile others incomprehensibly prefer to do so, and wrote his \"Contentment\"\r\nto express their idea of the simple life:\r\n\r\n  Little I ask; my wants are few;\r\n    I only wish a hut of stone\r\n  (A _very plain_ brown stone will do)\r\n    That I may call my own;\r\n  And close at hand is such a one,\r\n  In yonder street that fronts the sun.\r\n\r\n  I care not much for gold or land;\r\n    Give me a mortgage here and there,\r\n  Some good bank-stock, some note of hand,\r\n    Or trifling railroad share.\r\n  I only ask that Fortune send\r\n  A _little_ more than I shall spend.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE AUTOCRAT]\r\n\r\nThe most readable of the prose works is _The Autocrat of the Breakfast\r\nTable_ (1858), a series of monologues in which Holmes, who was called\r\nthe best talker of his age, transferred his talk in a very charming way to\r\npaper. As the book professes to record the conversation at the table of a\r\ncertain Boston boarding-house, it has no particular subject; the author\r\nrambles pleasantly from one topic to another, illuminating each by his\r\nwisdom or humor or sympathy. Other books of the same series are _The\r\nProfessor at the Breakfast Table_, _The Poet at the Breakfast\r\nTable_ and _Over the Teacups_. Most critics consider _The\r\nAutocrat_ the best and _The Poet_ second best of the series; but\r\nthere is a tender vein of sentiment and reminiscence in the final volume\r\nwhich is very attractive to older readers.\r\n\r\nThe slight story element in the breakfast-table books probably led Holmes\r\nto fiction, and he straightway produced three novels, _Elsie Venner_,\r\n_The Guardian Angel_ and _A Mortal Antipathy_. These are studies\r\nof heredity, of the physical element in morals, of the influence of mind\r\nover matter and other subjects more suitable for essays than for fiction;\r\nbut a few mature readers who care less for a story than for an observation\r\nor theory of life will find _The Guardian Angel_ an interesting novel.\r\nAnd some will surely prize _Elsie Venner_ for its pictures of New\r\nEngland life, its description of boarding school or evening party or social\r\nhierarchy, at a time when many a New England family had traditions to which\r\nit held as firmly and almost as proudly as any European court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD COLONIAL DOORWAY\r\nHolmes's birthplace, at Cambridge]\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF HOLMES. The intensely personal quality of the works just\r\nmentioned is their most striking characteristic; for Holmes always looks at\r\na subject with his own eyes, and measures its effect on the reader by a\r\nprevious effect produced upon himself. \"If I like this,\" he says in\r\nsubstance, \"why, you must like it too; if it strikes me as absurd, you\r\ncannot take any other attitude; for are we not both human and therefore\r\njust alike?\" It never occurred to Holmes that anybody could differ with him\r\nand still be normal; those who ventured to do so found the Doctor looking\r\nkeenly at them to discover their symptoms. In an ordinary egoist or\r\npolitician or theologian this would be insufferable; but strange to say it\r\nis one of the charms of Holmes, who is so witty and pleasant-spoken that we\r\ncan enjoy his dogmatism without the bother of objecting to it. In one of\r\nhis books he hints that talking to certain persons is like trying to pet a\r\nsquirrel; if you are wise, you will not imitate that frisky little beast\r\nbut assume the purring-kitten attitude while listening to the Autocrat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST-HAND IMPRESSIONS]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting quality of Holmes is what we may call his rationalism,\r\nhis habit of taking nothing for granted, of judging every matter by\r\nobservation rather than by tradition or sentiment or imagination; and\r\nherein he is in marked contrast with Longfellow and other romantic writers\r\nof the period. We shall enjoy him better if we remember his bent of mind.\r\nAs a boy he was fond of tools and machinery; as a man he was interested in\r\nphotography, safety razors, inventions of every kind; as a physician he\r\nrebelled against drugs (then believed to have almost magical powers, and\r\nimposed on suffering stomachs in horrible doses) and observed his patients\r\nclosely to discover what mentally ailed them; and as boy or man or\r\nphysician he cared very little for books but a great deal for his own\r\nobservation of life. Hence there is always a surprise in reading Holmes,\r\nwhich comes partly from his flashes of wit but more largely from his\r\nindependent way of looking at things and recording his first-hand\r\nimpressions. His _Autocrat_ especially is a treasure and ranks with\r\nThoreau's _Walden_ among the most original books of American\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIDNEY LANIER (1842-1881)\r\n\r\nThe name of Lanier is often associated with that of Timrod, and the two\r\nsouthern poets were outwardly alike in that they struggled against physical\r\nillness and mental depression; but where we see in Timrod the tragedy of a\r\npoet broken by pain and neglect, the tragedy of Lanier's life is forgotten\r\nin our wonder at his triumph. It is doubtful if any other poet ever raised\r\nso pure a song of joy out of conditions that might well have occasioned a\r\nwail of despair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDNEY LANIER]\r\n\r\nThe joyous song of Lanier is appreciated only by the few. He is not popular\r\nwith either readers or critics, and the difficulty of assigning him a place\r\nor rank may be judged from recent attempts. One history of American\r\nliterature barely mentions Lanier in a slighting reference to \"a small cult\r\nof poetry in parts of America\"; [Footnote: Trent, _History of American\r\nLiterature_ (1913), p. 471.] another calls him the only southern poet\r\nwho had a national horizon, and accords his work ample criticism;\r\n[Footnote: Moses, _Literature of the South_ (1910), pp 358-383] a\r\nthird describes him as \"a true artist\" having \"a lyric power hardly to be\r\nfound in any other American,\" but the brief record ends with the cutting\r\ncriticism that his work is \"hardly national.\" [Footnote: Wendell,\r\n_Literary History of America_ (1911), pp 495-498.] And so with all\r\nother histories, one dismisses him as the author of a vague rhapsody called\r\n\"The Marshes of Glynn,\" another exalts him as a poet who rivals Poe in\r\nmelody and far surpasses him in thought or feeling. Evidently there is no\r\nsettled criticism of Lanier, as of Bryant or Longfellow; he is not yet\r\nsecure in his position among the elder poets, and what we record here is\r\nsuch a personal appreciation as any reader may formulate for himself.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. America has had its Puritan and its Cavalier writers, but\r\n    seldom one who combines the Puritan's stern devotion to duty with\r\n    the Cavalier's joy in nature and romance and music. Lanier was such\r\n    a poet, and he owed his rare quality to a mixed ancestry. He was\r\n    descended on his mother's side from Scotch-Irish and Puritan\r\n    forbears, and on his father's side from Huguenot (French) exiles\r\n    who were musicians at the English court. One of his ancestors,\r\n    Nicholas Lanier, is described as \"a musician, painter and engraver\"\r\n    for Queen Elizabeth and King James, and as the composer of music\r\n    for some of Ben Jonson's masques.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: EARLY TRAITS]\r\n\r\n    His boyhood was spent at Macon, Georgia, where he was born in 1842.\r\n    A study of that boyhood reveals certain characteristics which\r\n    reappear constantly in the poet's work. One was his rare purity of\r\n    soul; another was his brave spirit; a third was his delight in\r\n    nature; a fourth was his passion for music. At seven he made his\r\n    first flute from a reed, and ever afterwards, though he learned to\r\n    play many instruments, the flute was to him as a companion and a\r\n    voice. With it he cheered many a weary march or hungry bivouac;\r\n    through it he told all his heart to the woman he loved; by it he\r\n    won a place when he had no other means of earning his bread. Hence\r\n    in \"The Symphony,\" a poem which fronts one of life's hard problems,\r\n    it is the flute that utters the clearest and sweetest note.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: IN WAR TIME]\r\n\r\n    Lanier had finished his course in Oglethorpe University (a\r\n    primitive little college in Midway, Georgia) and was tutoring there\r\n    when the war came, and the college closed its doors because\r\n    teachers and students were away at the first call to join the army.\r\n    For four years he was a Confederate soldier, serving in the ranks\r\n    with his brother and refusing the promotion offered him for gallant\r\n    conduct in the field. There was a time during this period when he\r\n    might have sung like the minstrels of old, for romance had come to\r\n    him with the war. By day he was fighting or scouting with his life\r\n    in his hand; but when camp fires were lighted he would take his\r\n    flute and slip away to serenade the girl who \"waited for him till\r\n    the war was over.\"\r\n\r\n    We mention these small incidents with a purpose. There is a\r\n    delicacy of feeling in Lanier's verse which might lead a reader to\r\n    assume that the poet was effeminate, when in truth he was as manly\r\n    as any Norse scald or Saxon scop who ever stood beside his chief in\r\n    battle. Of the war he never sang; but we find some reflection of\r\n    the girl who waited in the poem \"My Springs.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: WAR'S AFTERMATH]\r\n\r\n    Lanier was at sea, as signal officer on a blockade runner, when his\r\n    ship was captured by a Federal cruiser and he was sent to the\r\n    military prison at Point Lookout (1864). A hard and bitter\r\n    experience it was, and his only comfort was the flute which he had\r\n    hidden in his ragged sleeve. When released the following year he\r\n    set out on foot for his home, five hundred miles away, and reached\r\n    it more dead than alive; for consumption had laid a heavy hand upon\r\n    him. For weeks he was desperately ill, and during the illness his\r\n    mother died of the same wasting disease; then he rose and set out\r\n    bravely to earn a living,--no easy matter in a place that had\r\n    suffered as Georgia had during the war.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE GLEAM]\r\n\r\n    We shall not enter into his struggle for bread, or into his\r\n    wanderings in search of a place where he could breathe without\r\n    pain. He was a law clerk in his father's office at Macon when,\r\n    knowing that he had but a slender lease of life, he made his\r\n    resolve. To the remonstrances of his father he closed his ears,\r\n    saying that music and poetry were calling him and he must follow\r\n    the call. The superb climax of Tennyson's \"Merlin and the Gleam\"\r\n    was in his soul:\r\n\r\n      O young mariner,\r\n      Down to the haven\r\n      Call your companions,\r\n      Launch your vessel\r\n      And crowd your canvas,\r\n      And, ere it vanishes\r\n      Over the margin,\r\n      After it, follow it,\r\n      Follow the Gleam!\r\n\r\n    Thus bravely he went northward to Baltimore, taking his flute with\r\n    him. He was evidently a wonderful artist, playing not by the score\r\n    but making his instrument his voice, so that his audience seemed to\r\n    hear a soul speaking in melody. His was a magic flute. Soon he was\r\n    supporting himself by playing in the Peabody Orchestra, living\r\n    joyously meanwhile in an atmosphere of music and poetry and books;\r\n    for he was always a student, determined to understand as well as to\r\n    practice his art. He wrote poems, stories, anything to earn an\r\n    honest dollar; he gave lectures on music and literature; he planned\r\n    a score of books that he did not and could not write, for he was\r\n    living in a fever of mind and body. Music and poetry were surging\r\n    within him for expression; but his strength was failing, his time\r\n    short.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE STRUGGLE]\r\n\r\n    In 1879 he was appointed lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and\r\n    for the first time he had an assured income, small, indeed, but\r\n    very heartening since it was enough to support his family. He began\r\n    teaching with immense enthusiasm; but presently he was speaking in\r\n    a whisper from an invalid's chair. Under such circumstances were\r\n    uttered some of our most cheering words on art and poetry. Two\r\n    years later he died in a tent among the hills, near Asheville,\r\n    North Carolina, whither he had gone in a vain search for health.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: THE VILLAGE OF McGAHEYSVILLE, VIRGINIA\r\n      Near here Lanier spent his summers during the last years of his life]\r\n\r\n    There is in all Lanier's verse a fragmentariness, a sense of\r\n    something left unsaid, which we may understand better if we\r\n    remember that his heart was filled with the noblest emotions, but\r\n    that when he strove to write them his pen failed for weariness.\r\n    Read the daily miracle of dawn in \"Sunrise,\" for example, and find\r\n    there the waiting oaks, the stars, the tide, the marsh with its\r\n    dreaming pools, light, color, fragrance, melody,--everything except\r\n    that the hand which wrote the poem was too weak to guide the\r\n    pencil. The rush of impressions and memories in \"Sunrise,\" its\r\n    tender beauty and vague incompleteness, as of something left\r\n    unsaid, may be explained by the fact that it was Lanier's last\r\n    song.\r\n\r\nWORKS OF LANIER. Many readers have grown familiar with Lanier's name in\r\nconnection with _The Boy's Froissart_, _The Boy's King Arthur_,\r\n_The Boy's Mabinogion_ and _The Boy's Percy_, four books in which\r\nhe retold in simple language some of the old tales that are forever young.\r\nHis chief prose works, _The English Novel_ and _The Science of\r\nEnglish Verse_, are of interest chiefly to critics; they need not detain\r\nus here except to note that the latter volume is devoted to Lanier's pet\r\ntheory that music and poetry are governed by the same laws. Of more general\r\ninterest are his scattered \"Notes,\" which contain suggestions for many a\r\npoem that was never written, intermingled with condensed criticisms. Of the\r\npoet Swinburne he says, \"He invited me to eat; the service was silver and\r\ngold, but no food therein except salt and pepper.\" One might say less than\r\nthat with more words, or read a whole book to arrive at this summary of\r\nWhitman's style and bottomless philosophy: \"Whitman is poetry's butcher;\r\nhuge raw collops slashed from the rump of poetry, and never mind the\r\ngristle, is what he feeds our souls with.... His argument seems to be that\r\nbecause the Mississippi is long, therefore every American is a god.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS BEST POEMS]\r\n\r\nThose who read Lanier's poems should begin with the simplest, with his love\r\nsongs, \"My Springs\" and \"In Absence,\" or his \"Ballad of Trees and the\r\nMaster,\" or his outdoor poems, such as \"Tampa Robins,\" \"Song of the\r\nChattahoochee,\" \"Mocking Bird,\" and \"Evening Song.\" In the last-named\r\nlyrics he began the work (carried out more fully in his later poems) of\r\ninterpreting in words the harmony which his sensitive ear detected in the\r\nmanifold voices of nature.\r\n\r\nNext in order are the poems in which is hidden a thought or an ideal not to\r\nbe detected at first glance; for to Lanier poetry was like certain oriental\r\nidols which when opened are found to be filled with exquisite perfumes.\r\n\"The Stirrup Cup\" is one of the simplest of these allegories. It was a\r\ncustom in olden days when a man was ready to journey, for one who loved him\r\nto bring a glass of wine which he drank in the saddle; and this was called\r\nthe stirrup or parting cup. In the cup offered Lanier was a rare cordial,\r\nfilled with \"sweet herbs from all antiquity,\" and the name of the cordial\r\nwas Death:\r\n\r\n  Then, Time, let not a drop be spilt:\r\n  Hand me the cup whene'er thou wilt;\r\n  'T is thy rich stirrup cup to me;\r\n  I'll drink it down right smilingly.\r\n\r\nIn four stanzas of \"Night and Day\" he compresses the tragedy of\r\n_Othello_, not the tragedy that Shakespeare wrote but the tragedy that\r\nwas in the Moor's soul when Desdemona was gone. In \"Life and Song\" he\r\nsought to express the ideal of a poet, and the closing lines might well be\r\nthe measure of his own heroic life:\r\n\r\n  His song was only living aloud,\r\n  His work a singing with his hand.\r\n\r\nIn \"How Love Looked for Hell\" the lesson is hidden deeper; for the profound\r\nyet simple meaning of the poem is that, search high or low, Love can never\r\nfind hell because he takes heaven with him wherever he goes. Another poem\r\nof the same class, but longer and more involved, is \"The Symphony.\" Here\r\nLanier faces one of the greatest problems of the age, the problem of\r\nindustrialism with its false standards and waste of human happiness, and\r\nhis answer is the same that Tennyson gave in his later poems; namely, that\r\nthe familiar love in human hearts can settle every social question when\r\nleft to its own unselfish way:\r\n\r\n  Vainly might Plato's brain revolve it,\r\n  Plainly the heart of a child might solve it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARSHES OF GLYNN]\r\n\r\nThe longer poems of Lanier are of uneven merit and are all more or less\r\nfragmentary. The chief impression from reading the \"Psalm of the West,\" for\r\nexample, is that it is the prelude to some greater work that was left\r\nunfinished. More finely wrought and more typical of Lanier's mood and\r\nmethod is \"The Marshes of Glynn,\" his best-known work. It is a marvelous\r\npoem, one of the most haunting in our language; yet it is like certain\r\nsymphonies in that it says nothing, being all feeling,--vague,\r\ninexpressible feeling. Some readers find no meaning or satisfaction in it;\r\nothers hail it as a perfect interpretation of their own mood or emotion\r\nwhen they stand speechless before the sunrise or the afterglow or a\r\nlandscape upon which the very spirit of beauty and peace is brooding.\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF LANIER. In order to sympathize with Lanier, and so to\r\nunderstand him, it is necessary to keep in mind that he was a musician\r\nrather than a poet in our ordinary understanding of the term. In his verse\r\nhe used words, exactly as he used the tones of his flute, not so much to\r\nexpress ideas as to call up certain emotions that find no voice save in\r\nmusic. As he said, \"Music takes up the thread that language drops,\" which\r\nexplains that beautiful but puzzling line which closes \"The Symphony\":\r\n\r\n  Music is Love in search of a word.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MUSIC AND POETRY]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of \"The Symphony\" as an answer to the problem of industrial\r\nwaste and sorrow, but it contains also Lanier's confession of faith;\r\nnamely, that social evils arise among men because of their lack of harmony;\r\nand that spiritual harmony, the concord of souls which makes strife\r\nimpossible, may be attained through music. The same belief appears in\r\n_Tiger Lilies_ (a novel written by Lanier in his early days), in which\r\na certain character makes these professions:\r\n\r\n    \"To make a _home_ out of a household, given the raw\r\n    materials--to wit, wife, children, a friend or two and a house--two\r\n    other things are necessary. These are a good fire and good music.\r\n    And inasmuch as we can do without the fire for half the year, I may\r\n    say music is the one essential.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Late explorers say they have found some nations that have no God;\r\n    but I have not read of any that had no music.\" \"Music means\r\n    harmony, harmony means love, love means--God!\"\r\n\r\nOne may therefore summarize Lanier by saying that he was poet who used\r\nverbal rhythm, as a musician uses harmonious chords, to play upon our\r\nbetter feelings. His poems of nature give us no definite picture of the\r\nexternal world but are filled with murmurings, tremblings, undertones,--all\r\nthe vague impressions which one receives when alone in the solitudes, as if\r\nthe world were alive but inarticulate:\r\n\r\n  Ye marshes, how candid and simple and nothing-witholding and free\r\n  Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea!\r\n  Tolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun,\r\n  Ye spread and span like the catholic man that hath mightily won\r\n  God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain\r\n  And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain.\r\n\r\nHis poems of life have similar virtues and weaknesses: they are melodious;\r\nthey are nobly inspired; they appeal to our finest feelings; but they are\r\nalways vague in that they record no definite thought and speak no downright\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LANIER AND WHITTIER]\r\n\r\nThe criticism may be more clear if we compare Lanier with Whittier, a man\r\nequally noble, who speaks a language that all men understand. The poems of\r\nthe two supplement each other, one reflecting the reality of life, the\r\nother its mysterious dreams. In Whittier's poetry we look upon a landscape\r\nand a people, and we say, \"I have seen that rugged landscape with my own\r\neyes; I have eaten bread with those people, and have understood and loved\r\nthem.\" Then we read Lanier's poetry and say, \"Yes, I have had those\r\nfeelings at times; but I do not speak of them to others because I cannot\r\ntell what they mean to me.\" Both poets are good, and both fail of greatness\r\nin poetry, Whittier because he has no exalted imagination, Lanier because\r\nhe lacks primitive simplicity and strength. One poet sings a song to cheer\r\nthe day's labor, the other makes a melody to accompany our twilight\r\nreveries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"WALT\" WHITMAN (1819-1892)\r\n\r\nSince Whitman insisted upon being called \"Walt\" instead of Walter, so let\r\nit be. The name accords with the free-and-easy style of his verse. If you\r\ncan find some abridged selections from that verse, read them by all means;\r\nbut if you must search the whole of it for the passages that are worth\r\nreading, then pass it cheerfully by; for such another vain display of\r\negotism, vulgarity and rant never appeared under the name of poetry.\r\nWhitman was so absurdly fond of his \"chants\" and so ignorant of poetry that\r\nhe preserved the whole of his work in a final edition, and his publishers\r\nstill insist upon printing it, rubbish and all. The result is that the few\r\nrare verses which stamp him as a poet are apt to be overlooked in the\r\nmultitudinous gabblings which, of themselves, might mark him as a mere\r\nfreak or \"sensation\" in our modest literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALT WHITMAN]\r\n\r\n    BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. Ordinarily when we read poetry we desire to\r\n    know something of the man who wrote it, of his youth, his training,\r\n    the circumstance of his work and the personal ideals which made him\r\n    view life steadily in one light rather than in another. In dealing\r\n    with Whitman it is advisable to leave such natural curiosity\r\n    unsatisfied, and for two reasons: first, the man was far from\r\n    admirable or upright, and to meet him at certain stages is to lose\r\n    all desire to read his poetry; and second, he was so extremely\r\n    secretive about himself, while professing boundless good-fellowship\r\n    with all men, that we can seldom trust his own record, much less\r\n    that of his admirers. There are great blanks in the story of his\r\n    life; his real biography has not yet been written; and in the\r\n    jungle of controversial writings which has grown up around him one\r\n    loses sight of Whitman in a maze of extravagant or contradictory\r\n    opinions. [Footnote: Of the many biographies of Whitman perhaps the\r\n    best for beginners is Perry's _Walt Whitman_ (1906), in\r\n    American Men of Letters Series.]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: TRAITS AND INCIDENTS]\r\n\r\n    Let it suffice then to record, in catalogue fashion, that Whitman\r\n    was born (1819) on Long Island, of stubborn farmer stock; that he\r\n    spent his earliest years by the sea, which inspired his best verse;\r\n    that he grew up in the streets of Brooklyn and was always\r\n    fascinated by the restless tide of city life, as reflected in such\r\n    poems as \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\"; that his education was scanty\r\n    and of the \"picked up\" variety; that to the end of his life, though\r\n    ignorant of what literary men regard as the _a-b-c_ of\r\n    knowledge, he was supremely well satisfied with himself; that till\r\n    he was past forty he worked irregularly at odd jobs, but was by\r\n    choice a loafer; that he was a man of superb physical health and\r\n    gloried in his body, without much regard for moral standards; that\r\n    his strength was broken by nursing wounded soldiers during the war,\r\n    a beautiful and unselfish service; that he was then a government\r\n    clerk in Washington until partly disabled by a paralytic stroke,\r\n    and that the remainder of his life was spent at Camden, New Jersey.\r\n    His _Leaves of Grass_ (published first in 1855, and\r\n    republished with additions many times) brought him very little\r\n    return in money, and his last years were spent in a state of\r\n    semipoverty, relieved by the gifts of a small circle of admirers.\r\n\r\nWHITMAN'S VERSE. In a single book, _Leaves of Grass_, Whitman has\r\ncollected all his verse. This book would be a chaos even had he left his\r\nworks in the order in which they were written; but that is precisely what\r\nhe did not do. Instead, he enlarged and rearranged the work ten different\r\ntimes, mixing up his worst and his best verses, so that it is now very\r\ndifficult to trace his development as a poet. We may, however, tentatively\r\narrange his work in three divisions: his early shouting to attract\r\nattention (as summarized in the line \"I sound my barbaric yawp over the\r\nroofs of the world\"), his war poems, and his later verse written after he\r\nhad learned something of the discipline of life and poetry.\r\n\r\nThe quality of his early work may be judged from a few disjointed lines of\r\nhis characteristic \"Song of Myself\":\r\n\r\n  Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?\r\n  I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die, and I know\r\n                it.\r\n\r\n  I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and am\r\n                not contain'd between my hat and boots,\r\n  And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good,\r\n  The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\r\n\r\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\r\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\r\n  The clear light plays on the brown, gray and green intertinged,\r\n  The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\r\n  I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\r\n  I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\r\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\r\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\r\n\r\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\r\n  I tuck'd my trowser ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\r\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\r\n\r\nThus he rambles on, gabbing of every place or occupation or newspaper\r\nreport that comes into his head. When he ends this grotesque \"Song of\r\nMyself\" after a thousand lines or more, he makes another just like it. We\r\nread a few words here and there, amazed that any publisher should print\r\nsuch rubbish; and then, when we are weary of Whitman's conceit or bad\r\ntaste, comes a flash of insight, of imagination, of poetry:\r\n\r\n  Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\r\n  Healthy, free, the world before me,\r\n  The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\r\n  These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are\r\n                they?\r\n  Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\r\n                expands my blood?\r\n  Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\r\n  Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts\r\n                descend upon me?\r\n\r\nThere are, in short, hundreds of pages of such \"chanting\" with its grain of\r\nwheat hid in a bushel of chaff. We refer to it here not because it is worth\r\nreading but to record the curious fact that many European critics hail it\r\nas typical American poetry, even while we wonder why anybody should regard\r\nit as either American or poetic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOREIGN OPINION]\r\n\r\nThe explanation is simple. Europeans have not yet rid themselves of the\r\nidea that America is the strange, wild land Cooper's _Pioneers_, and\r\nthat any poetry produced here must naturally be uncouth, misshapen, defiant\r\nof all poetic laws or traditions. To such critics Whitman's crudity seems\r\ntypical of a country where one is in nightly danger of losing his scalp,\r\nwhere arguments are settled by revolvers, and where a hungry man needs only\r\nto shoot a buffalo or a bear from his back door. Meanwhile America, the\r\ncountry that planted colleges and churches in a wilderness, that loves\r\nliberty because she honors law, that never saw a knight in armor but that\r\nhas, even in her plainsmen and lumberjacks, a chivalry for woman that would\r\nadorn a Bayard,--that real America ignores the bulk of Whitman's work\r\nsimply because she knows that, of all her poets, he is the least\r\nrepresentative of her culture, her ideals, her heroic and aspiring life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DRUM TAPS]\r\n\r\nThe second division of Whitman's work is made up chiefly of verses written\r\nin war time, to some of which he gave the significant title, _Drum\r\nTaps_. In such poems as as \"Beat, Beat, Drums,\" \"Cavalry Crossing a\r\nFord\" and \"By the Bivouac's Fitful Flame\" he reflected the emotional\r\nexcitement of '61 and the stern days that followed. Note, for example, the\r\nstartling vigor of \"Ethiopia Saluting the Colors,\" which depicts an old\r\nnegro woman by the roadside, looking with wonder on the free flag which she\r\nsees for the first time aloft over marching men:\r\n\r\n  Who are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,\r\n  With your woolly-white and turban'd head and bare bony feet?\r\n  Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?\r\n\r\nAnother side of the war is reflected in such poems as \"Come up from the\r\nFields, Father,\" an exquisite picture of an old mother and father receiving\r\nthe news of their son's death on the battlefield. In the same class belong\r\ntwo fine tributes, \"O Captain, My Captain\" and \"When Lilacs Last in the\r\nDooryard Bloomed,\" written in moments of noble emotion when the news came\r\nthat Lincoln was dead. The former tribute, with its rhythmic swing and\r\nlyric refrain, indicates what Whitman might have done in poetry had he been\r\na more patient workman. So also does \"Pioneers,\" a lyric that is wholly\r\nAmerican and Western and exultant:\r\n\r\n       Have the elder races halted?\r\n  Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?\r\n  We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,\r\n       Pioneers! O Pioneers!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATER POEMS]\r\n\r\nIn the third class of Whitman's works are the poems written late in life,\r\nwhen he had learned to suppress his blatant egotism and to pay some little\r\nattention to poetic form and melody. Though his lines are still crude and\r\nirregular, many of them move to a powerful rhythm, such as the impressive\r\n\"With Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea,\" which suggests the surge and beat of\r\nbreakers on the shore. In others he gives finely imaginative expression to\r\nan ideal or a yearning, and his verse rises to high poetic levels. Note\r\nthis allegory of the spider, an insect that, when adrift or in a strange\r\nplace, sends out delicate filaments on the air currents until one thread\r\ntakes hold of some solid substance and is used as a bridge over the\r\nunknown:\r\n\r\n  A noiseless patient spider,\r\n  I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,\r\n  Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding\r\n  It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament out of itself,\r\n  Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.\r\n\r\n  And you, O my soul, where you stand,\r\n  Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\r\n  Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect\r\n                them,\r\n  Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold,\r\n  Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITMAN'S BIRTHPLACE, WEST HILLS, LONG ISLAND]\r\n\r\nAmong the best of Whitman's works are his poems to death. \"Joy, Shipmate,\r\nJoy,\" \"Death's Valley,\" \"Darest Thou Now, O Soul,\" \"Last Invocation,\"\r\n\"Good-Bye, My Fancy,\"--in such haunting lyrics he reflects the natural view\r\nof death, not as a terrible or tragic or final event but as a confident\r\ngoing forth to meet new experiences. Other notable poems that well repay\r\nthe reading are \"The Mystic Trumpeter,\" \"The Man-of-War Bird,\" \"The Ox\r\nTamer,\" \"Thanks in Old Age\" and \"Aboard at a Ship's Helm.\"\r\n\r\nIn naming the above works our purpose is simply to lure the reader away\r\nfrom the insufferable Whitmanesque \"chant\" and to attract attention to a\r\nfew poems that sound a new note in literature, a note of freedom, of joy,\r\nof superb confidence, which warms the heart when we hear it. When these\r\npoems are known others will suggest themselves: \"Rise, O Days, from Your\r\nFathomless Deeps,\" \"I Hear America Singing,\" \"There was a Boy Went Forth,\"\r\n\"The Road Unknown,\" \"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.\" There is magic\r\nin such names; but unfortunately in most cases the reader will find only an\r\nalluring title and a few scattered lines of poetry; the rest is Whitman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEMOCRACY]\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Song of Myself\" proclaimed himself the poet of democracy\r\nand wrote many verses on his alleged subject; but those who read them will\r\nsoon tire of one whose idea of democracy was that any man is as good, as\r\nwise, as godlike as any other. Perhaps his best work in this field is \"Thou\r\nMother with Thy Equal Brood,\" a patriotic poem read at \"Commencement\" time\r\nin Dartmouth College (1872). There is too much of vainglorious boasting in\r\nthe poem (for America should be modest, and can afford to be modest), but\r\nit has enough of prophetic vision and exalted imagination to make us\r\noverlook its unworthy spread-eagleism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRAYER OF COLUMBUS]\r\n\r\nAs a farewell to Whitman one should read what is perhaps his noblest single\r\nwork, \"The Prayer of Columbus.\" The poem is supposed to reflect the thought\r\nof Columbus when, as a worn-out voyager, an old man on his last expedition,\r\nhe looked out over his wrecked ships to the lonely sea beyond; but the\r\nreader may see in it another picture, that of a broken old man in his\r\nsolitary house at Camden, writing with a trembling hand the lines which\r\nreflect his unshaken confidence:\r\n\r\n  My terminus near,\r\n  The clouds already closing in upon me,\r\n  The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,\r\n  I yield my ships to Thee\r\n  My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,\r\n  My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd;\r\n  Let the old timbers part, I will not part,\r\n  I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,\r\n  Thee, Thee at least I know.\r\n\r\n  Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?\r\n  What do I know of life? what of myself?\r\n  I know not even my own work past or present;\r\n  Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,\r\n  Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,\r\n  Mocking, perplexing me.\r\n\r\n  And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?\r\n  As if some miracle, some hand divine, unseal'd my eyes,\r\n  Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,\r\n  And on the distant waves sail countless ships,\r\n  And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PROSE WRITERS\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882)\r\n\r\nEmerson is the mountaineer of our literature; to read him is to have the\r\nimpression of being on the heights. It is solitary there, far removed from\r\nordinary affairs; but the air is keen, the outlook grand, the heavens near.\r\nOur companions are the familiar earth by day or the mysterious stars by\r\nnight, and these are good if only to recall the silent splendor of God's\r\nuniverse amid the pother of human inventions. There also the very spirit of\r\nliberty, which seems to have its dwelling among the hills, enters into us\r\nand makes us sympathize with Emerson's message of individual freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is still a question whether Emerson should be classed with the poets or\r\nprose writers, and our only reason for placing him with the latter is that\r\nhis \"Nature\" seems more typical than his \"Wood Notes,\" though in truth both\r\nworks convey precisely the same message. He was a great man who used prose\r\nor verse as suited his mood at the moment; but he was never a great poet,\r\nand only on rare occasions was he a great prose writer.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. Emerson has been called \"the wingéd Franklin,\" \"the Yankee\r\n    Shelley\" and other contradictory names which strive to express the\r\n    union of shrewd sense and lofty idealism that led him to write\r\n    \"Hitch your wagon to a star\" and many another aphorism intended to\r\n    bring heaven and earth close together. We shall indicate enough of\r\n    his inheritance if we call him a Puritan of the Puritans, a\r\n    moralist descended from seven generations of heroic ministers who\r\n    had helped to make America a free nation, and who had practiced the\r\n    love of God and man and country before preaching it to their\r\n    congregations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RALPH WALDO EMERSON]\r\n\r\n    The quality of these ancestors entered into Emerson and gave him\r\n    the granite steadfastness that is one of his marked\r\n    characteristics. Meeting him in his serene old age one would hardly\r\n    suspect him of heroism; but to meet him in childhood is to\r\n    understand the kind of man he was, and must be. If you would\r\n    appreciate the quality of that childhood, picture to yourself a\r\n    bare house with an open fire and plenty of books, but little else\r\n    of comfort. There are a mother and six children in the house,\r\n    desperately poor; for the father is dead and has left his family\r\n    nothing and everything,--nothing that makes life rich, everything\r\n    in the way of ideals and blessed memories to make life wealthy. The\r\n    mother works as only a poor woman can from morning till night. The\r\n    children go to school by day; but instead of playing after\r\n    school-hours they run errands for the neighbors, drive cows from\r\n    pasture, shovel snow, pick huckleberries, earn an honest penny. In\r\n    the evening they read together before the open fire. When they are\r\n    hungry, as they often are, a Puritan aunt who shares their poverty\r\n    tells them stories of human endurance. The circle narrows when an\r\n    older brother goes to college; the rest reduce their meals and\r\n    spare their pennies in order to help him. After graduation he\r\n    teaches school and devotes his earnings to giving the next brother\r\n    his chance. All the while they speak courteously to each other,\r\n    remember their father's teaching that they are children of God, and\r\n    view their hard life steadily in the light of that sublime\r\n    doctrine.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE COLLEGE BOY]\r\n\r\n    The rest of the story is easily told. Emerson was born in Boston,\r\n    then a straggling town, in 1803. When his turn came he went to\r\n    Harvard, and largely supported himself there by such odd jobs as\r\n    only a poor student knows how to find. Wasted time he called it;\r\n    for he took little interest in college discipline or college fun\r\n    and was given to haphazard reading, \"sinfully strolling from book\r\n    to book, from care to idleness,\" as he said. Later he declared that\r\n    the only good thing he found in Harvard was a solitary chamber.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE PREACHER]\r\n\r\n    After leaving college he taught school and shared his earnings,\r\n    according to family tradition. Then he began to study for the\r\n    ministry; or perhaps we should say \"read,\" for Emerson never really\r\n    studied anything. At twenty-three he was licensed to preach, and\r\n    three years later was chosen pastor of the Second Church in Boston.\r\n    It was the famous Old North Church in which the Mathers had\r\n    preached, and the Puritan divines must have turned in their graves\r\n    when the young radical began to utter his heresies from the ancient\r\n    pulpit. He was loved and trusted by his congregation, but presently\r\n    he differed with them in the matter of the ritual and resigned his\r\n    ministry.\r\n\r\n    Next he traveled in Europe, where he found as little of value as he\r\n    had previously found in college. The old institutions, which roused\r\n    the romantic enthusiasm of Irving and Longfellow, were to him only\r\n    relics of barbarism. He went to Europe, he said, to see two men,\r\n    and he found them in Wordsworth and Carlyle. His friendship with\r\n    the latter and the letters which passed between \"the sage of\r\n    Chelsea\" and \"the sage of Concord\" (as collected and published by\r\n    Charles Eliot Norton in his _Correspondence of Carlyle and\r\n    Emerson_) are the most interesting result of his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE LECTURER]\r\n\r\n    On his return he settled in the village of Concord, which was to be\r\n    his home for the remainder of his long life. He began to lecture,\r\n    and so well was the \"Lyceum\" established at that time that he was\r\n    soon known throughout the country. For forty years this lecturing\r\n    continued, and the strange thing about it is that in all that time\r\n    he hardly met one audience that understood him or that carried away\r\n    any definite idea of what he had talked about. Something noble in\r\n    the man seemed to attract people; as Lowell said, they did not go\r\n    to hear what Emerson said but to hear Emerson.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE WRITER]\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile he was writing prose and poetry. His literary work began\r\n    in college and consisted largely in recording such thoughts or\r\n    quotations as seemed worthy of preservation. In his private\r\n    _Journal_ (now published in several volumes) may be found\r\n    practically everything he put into the formal works which he sent\r\n    forth from Concord. These had at first a very small circle of\r\n    readers; but the circle widened steadily, and the phenomenon is\r\n    more remarkable in view of the fact that the author avoided\r\n    publicity and had no ambition for success. He lived contentedly in\r\n    a country village; he cultivated his garden and his neighbors; he\r\n    spent long hours alone with nature; he wrote the thoughts that came\r\n    to him and sent them to make their own way in the world, while he\r\n    himself remained, as he said, \"far from fame behind the birch\r\n    trees.\"\r\n\r\n    The last years of his life were as the twilight of a perfect day.\r\n    His mental powers failed slowly; he seemed to drift out of the\r\n    present world into another of pure memories; even his friends\r\n    became spiritualized, lost the appearance of earth and assumed\r\n    their eternal semblance. When he stood beside the coffin of\r\n    Longfellow, looking intently into the poet's face, he was heard to\r\n    murmur, \"A sweet, a gracious personality, but I have forgotten his\r\n    name.\" To the inevitable changes (the last came in 1882) he adapted\r\n    himself with the same serenity which marked his whole life. He even\r\n    smiled as he read the closing lines of his \"Terminus\":\r\n\r\n      As the bird trims her to the gale,\r\n      I trim myself to the storm of time,\r\n      I man the rudder, reef the sail,\r\n      Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime:\r\n      \"Lowly faithful, banish fear,\r\n      Right onward drive unharmed;\r\n      The port, well worth the cruise, is near,\r\n      And every wave is charmed.\"\r\n\r\nEMERSON'S POETRY. There is a ruggedness in Emerson's verse which attracts\r\nsome readers while it repels others by its unmelodious rhythm. It may help\r\nus to measure that verse if we recall the author's criticism thereof. In\r\n1839 he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I am naturally keenly susceptible to the pleasures of rhythm, and\r\n    cannot believe but one day I shall attain to that splendid dialect,\r\n    so ardent is my wish; and these wishes, I suppose, are ever only\r\n    the buds of power; but up to this hour I have never had a true\r\n    success in such attempts.\"\r\n\r\nOne must be lenient with a poet who confesses that he cannot attain the\r\n\"splendid dialect,\" especially so since we are inclined to agree with him.\r\nIn the following passage from \"Each and All\" we may discover the reason for\r\nhis lack of success:\r\n\r\n  Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloaked clown\r\n  Of thee from the hill-top looking down;\r\n  The heifer that lows in the upland farm,\r\n  Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm;\r\n  The sexton, tolling his bell at noon,\r\n  Deems not that great Napoleon\r\n  Stops his horse, and lists with delight,\r\n  Whilst his files sweep round yon Alpine height;\r\n  Nor knowest thou what argument\r\n  Thy life to thy neighbor's creed has lent.\r\n  All are needed by each one;\r\n  Nothing is fair or good alone.\r\n  I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,\r\n  Singing at dawn on the alder bough;\r\n  I brought him home in his nest at even;\r\n  He sings the song, but it cheers not now,\r\n  For I did not bring home the river and sky:\r\n  He sang to my ear; they sang to my eye.\r\n  The delicate shells lay on the shore;\r\n  The bubbles of the latest wave\r\n  Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,\r\n  And the bellowing of the savage sea\r\n  Greeted their safe escape to me.\r\n  I wiped away the weeds and foam,\r\n  I fetched my sea-born treasures home;\r\n  But the poor, unsightly, noisome things\r\n  Had left their beauty on the shore\r\n  With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.\r\n\r\nOur first criticism is that the poem contains both fine and faulty lines,\r\nand that the total impression is an excellent one. Next, we note that the\r\nverse is labored; for Emerson was not a natural singer, like Whittier, and\r\nwas hampered by his tendency to think too much instead of giving free\r\nexpression to his emotion. [Footnote: Most good poems are characterized by\r\nboth thought and feeling, and by a perfection of form that indicates\r\nartistic workmanship. With Emerson the thought is the main thing; feeling\r\nor emotion is subordinate or lacking, and he seldom has the patience to\r\nwork over his thought until it assumes beautiful or perfect expression.]\r\nFinally, he is didactic; that is, he is teaching the lesson that you must\r\nnot judge a thing by itself, as if it had no history or connections, but\r\nmust consider it in its environment, as a part of its own world.\r\n\r\nAs in \"Each and All\" so in most of his verse Emerson is too much of a\r\nteacher or moralist to be a poet. In \"The Rhodora,\" one of his most perfect\r\npoems, he proclaims that \"Beauty is its own excuse for being\"; but\r\nstraightway he forgets the word and devotes his verse not to beauty but to\r\nsome ethical lesson. Very rarely does he break away from this unpoetic\r\nhabit, as when he interrupts the moralizing of his \"World Soul\" to write a\r\nlyric that we welcome for its own sake:\r\n\r\n  Spring still makes spring in the mind\r\n    When sixty years are told;\r\n  Love wakes anew this throbbing heart,\r\n    And we are never old.\r\n  Over the winter glaciers\r\n    I see the summer glow,\r\n  And through the wide-piled snowdrift\r\n    The warm rosebuds below.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL POEMS]\r\n\r\nThe most readable of Emerson's poems are those in which he reflects his\r\nimpressions of nature, such as \"Seashore,\" \"The Humble-Bee,\" \"The\r\nSnow-Storm,\" \"Days,\" \"Fable,\" \"Forbearance,\" \"The Titmouse\" and\r\n\"Wood-Notes.\" In another class are his philosophical poems devoted to\r\ntranscendental doctrines. The beginner will do well to skip these, since\r\nthey are more of a puzzle than a source of pleasure. In a third class are\r\npoems of more personal interest, such as the noble \"Threnody,\" a poem of\r\ngrief written after the death of Emerson's little boy; \"Good-Bye,\" in which\r\nthe poet bids farewell to fame as he hies him to the country; \"To Ellen,\"\r\nwhich half reveals his love story; \"Written in Rome,\" which speaks of the\r\nsociety he found in solitude; and the \"Concord Hymn,\" written at the\r\ndedication of Battle Monument, with its striking opening lines:\r\n\r\n  By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\r\n    Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,\r\n  Here once the embattled farmers stood,\r\n    And fired the shot heard round the world.\r\n\r\nPROSE WORKS. Perhaps the most typical of Emerson's prose works is his first\r\nbook, to which he gave the name _Nature_ (1836). In this he records\r\nnot his impressions of bird or beast or flower, as his neighbor Thoreau was\r\ndoing in _Walden_, but rather his philosophy of the universe. \"Nature\r\nalways wears the colors of the spirit\"; \"Every animal function, from the\r\nsponge up to Hercules, shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and\r\nwrong, and echo the ten commandments\"; \"The foundations of man are not in\r\nmatter but in spirit, and the element of spirit is eternity,\"--scores of\r\nsuch expressions indicate that Emerson deals with the soul of things, not\r\nwith their outward appearance. Does a flower appeal to him? Its scientific\r\nname and classification are of no consequence; like Wordsworth, he would\r\nunderstand what thought of God the flower speaks. To him nature is a mirror\r\nin which the Almighty reflects his thought; again it is a parable, a little\r\nstory written in trees or hills or stars; frequently it is a living\r\npresence, speaking melodiously in winds or waters; and always it is an\r\ninspiration to learn wisdom at first hand:\r\n\r\n    \"Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers.\r\n    It writes biographies, histories, criticisms. The foregoing\r\n    generations beheld God and Nature face to face; we, through their\r\n    eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the\r\n    universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of\r\n    insight, and not of tradition?\"\r\n\r\nThe last quotation might well be an introduction to Emerson's second work,\r\n_The American Scholar_ (1837), which was a plea for laying aside\r\nEuropean models and fronting life as free men in a new world. Holmes called\r\nthis work \"our intellectual Declaration of Independence,\" and it was\r\nfollowed by a succession of volumes--_Essays_, _Representative\r\nMen_, _Conduct of Life_, _Society and Solitude_ and several\r\nothers--all devoted to the same two doctrines of idealism and\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REPRESENTATIVE MEN]\r\n\r\nAmong these prose works the reader must make his own selection. All are\r\nworth reading; none is easy to read; even the best of them is better\r\nappreciated in brief instalments, since few can follow Emerson long without\r\nwearying. _English Traits_ is a keen but kindly criticism of \"our\r\ncousins\" overseas, which an American can read with more pleasure than an\r\nEnglishman. _Representative Men_ is a series of essays on Plato,\r\nShakespeare, Napoleon and other world figures, which may well be read in\r\nconnection with Carlyle's _Heroes and Hero Worship_, since the two\r\nbooks reflect the same subject from widely different angles. Carlyle was in\r\ntheory an aristocrat and a force-worshiper, Emerson a democrat and a\r\nbeliever in ideals. One author would relate us to his heroes in the\r\nattitude of slave to master, the other in the relation of brothers and\r\nequals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ESSAYS]\r\n\r\nOf the shorter prose works, collected in various volumes of _Essays_,\r\nwe shall name only a few in two main groups, which we may call the ideal\r\nand the practical. In the first group are such typical works as \"The\r\nOver-Soul,\" \"Compensation,\" \"Spiritual Laws\" and \"History\"; in the latter\r\nare \"Heroism,\" \"Self-Reliance,\" \"Literary Ethics\" (an address to young\r\ncollegians), \"Character\" and \"Manners.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to criticize such writings, which have a daring originality\r\nof thought and a springlike freshness of expression that set them apart\r\nfrom all other essays ancient or modern. They are the most quotable, the\r\nfittest to \"point a moral or adorn a tale\" that have ever appeared in our\r\nliterature; but they are also disjointed, oracular, hard to follow; and the\r\nexplanation is found in the manner of their production. When Emerson\r\nprojected a new lecture or essay he never thought his subject out or\r\nordered it from beginning to end. That would have been another man's way of\r\ndoing it. He collected from his notebooks such thoughts as seemed to bear\r\nupon his subject, strung them together, and made an end when he had enough.\r\nThe connection or relation between his thoughts is always frail and often\r\ninvisible; some compare it with the thread which holds the pearls of a\r\nnecklace together; others quote with a smile the epigram of Goldwin Smith,\r\nwho said that he found an Emersonian essay about as coherent as a bag of\r\nmarbles. And that suggests a fair criticism of all Emerson's prose; namely,\r\nthat it is a series of expressions excellent in themselves but having so\r\nlittle logical sequence that a paragraph from one essay may be placed at\r\nthe beginning, middle or end of any other, where it seems to be equally at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTRINE OF EMERSON. Since we constantly hear of \"idealism\" in\r\nconnection with Emerson, let us understand the word if we can; or rather\r\nthe fact, for idealism is the most significant quality of humanity. The\r\nterm will be better understood if we place it beside \"materialism,\" which\r\nexpresses an opposite view of life. The difference may be summarized in the\r\nstatement that the idealist is a man of spirit, or idea, in that he trusts\r\nthe evidence of the soul; while the materialist is a man of flesh, or\r\nsense, in that he believes only what is evident to the senses. One judges\r\nthe world by himself; the other judges himself by the world.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate our meaning: the materialist, looking outward, sees that the\r\nworld is made up of force-driven matter, of gas, carbon and mineral; and he\r\nsays, \"Even so am I made up.\" He studies an object, sees that it has its\r\nappointed cycle of growth and decay, and concludes, \"Even so do I appear\r\nand vanish.\" To him the world is the only reality, and the world perishes,\r\nand man is but a part of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE IDEALIST]\r\n\r\nThe idealist, looking first within, perceives that self-consciousness is\r\nthe great fact of life, and that consciousness expresses itself in words or\r\ndeeds; then he looks outward, and is aware of another Consciousness that\r\nexpresses itself in the lowly grass or in the stars of heaven. Looking\r\ninward he finds that he is governed by ideas of truth, beauty, goodness and\r\nduty; looking outward he everywhere finds evidence of truth and beauty and\r\nmoral law in the world. He sees, moreover, that while his body changes\r\nconstantly his self remains the same yesterday, to-day and forever; and\r\nagain his discovery is a guide to the outer world, with its seedtime and\r\nharvest, which is but the symbol or garment of a Divine Self that abides\r\nwithout shadow of change in a constantly changing universe. To him the only\r\nreality is spirit, and spirit cannot be harmed by fire or flood; neither\r\ncan it die or be buried, for it is immortal and imperishable.\r\n\r\nSuch, in simple words, was the idealism of Emerson, an idealism that was\r\nborn in him and that governed him long before he became involved in\r\ntranscendentalism, with its scraps of borrowed Hindu philosophy. It gave\r\nmessage or meaning to his first work, _Nature_, and to all the\r\nsubsequent essays or poems in which he pictured the world as a symbol or\r\nvisible expression of a spiritual reality. In other words, nature was to\r\nEmerson the Book of the Lord, and the chief thing of interest was not the\r\nbook but the idea that was written therein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INDIVIDUALIST]\r\n\r\nHaving read the universe and determined its spiritual quality, Emerson\r\nturned his eyes on humanity. Presently he announced that a man's chief\r\nglory is his individuality; that he is a free being, different from every\r\nother; that his business is to obey his individual genius; that he should,\r\ntherefore, ignore the Past with its traditions, and learn directly \"from\r\nthe Divine Soul which inspires all men.\" Having announced that doctrine, he\r\nspent the rest of his life in illustrating or enlarging it; and the sum of\r\nhis teaching was, \"Do not follow me or any other master; follow your own\r\nspirit. Never mind what history says, or philosophy or tradition or the\r\nsaints and sages. The same inspiration which led the prophets is yours for\r\nthe taking, and you have your work to do as they had theirs. Revere your\r\nown soul; trust your intuition; and whatever you find in your heart to do,\r\ndo it without doubt or fear, though all the world thunder in your ears that\r\nyou must do otherwise. As for the voice of authority, 'Let not a man quit\r\nhis belief that a popgun is a popgun, though the anointed and honorable of\r\nthe earth affirm it to be the crack of doom.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMERSON'S HOME, CONCORD]\r\n\r\nSuch was Emerson's pet doctrine of individualism. It appeared with\r\nstartling vigor in _The American Scholar_ at a time when our writers\r\nwere prone to imitate English poetry, German sentimentality or some other\r\nimported product. It came also with good grace from one whose life was\r\nnoble, but it had a weak or dangerous or grotesque side that Emerson\r\noverlooked. Thus, every crank or fanatic or rainbow-chaser is also an\r\nindividualist, and most of them believe as strongly as Emerson in the\r\nOver-Soul. The only difference is that they do not have his sense or\r\nintegrity or humor to balance their individualism. While Emerson exalted\r\nindividual liberty he seemed to forget that America is a country devoted to\r\n\"liberty under law,\" and that at every period of her history she has had\r\nneed to emphasize the law rather than the liberty. Moreover, individualism\r\nis a quality that takes care of itself, being finest in one who is least\r\nconscious of his own importance; and to study any strongly individual\r\ncharacter, a Washington or a Lincoln for example, is to discover that he\r\nstrove to be true to his race and traditions as well as to himself. Hence\r\nEmerson's doctrine, to live in the Present and have entire confidence in\r\nyourself, needs to be supplemented by another: to revere the Past with its\r\nimmortal heroes, who by their labor and triumph have established some\r\ntruths that no sane man will ever question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW WORLD WRITER]\r\n\r\nThere are other interesting qualities of Emerson, his splendid optimism,\r\nfor instance, which came partly from his spiritual view of the universe and\r\npartly from his association with nature; for the writer who is in daily\r\ncontact with sunshine or rain and who trusts his soul's ideals of truth and\r\nbeauty has no place for pessimism or despair; even in moments of darkness\r\nhe looks upward and reads his lesson:\r\n\r\n  Teach me your mood, O patient stars,\r\n    Who climb each night the ancient sky,\r\n  Leaving on space no shade, no scars,\r\n    No trace of age, no fear to die!\r\n\r\nThough he was and still is called a visionary, there is a practical quality\r\nin his writing which is better than anything you will find in _Poor\r\nRichard's Almanac_. Thus the burden of Franklin's teaching was the value\r\nof time, a lesson which the sage of Concord illuminates as with celestial\r\nlight in his poem \"Days,\" and to which he brings earth's candle in his\r\nprose essay \"Work and Days.\" [Footnote: The two works should be read in\r\nconnection as an interesting example of Emerson's use of prose and verse to\r\nreflect the same idea. Holmes selects the same two works to illustrate the\r\nessential difference between prose and poetry. See Holmes, _Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson_, p. 310.] Indeed, the more one reads Emerson the more is one\r\nconvinced that he is our typical New World writer, a rare genius who\r\ncombines the best qualities of Franklin and Edwards, having the practical\r\nsense of the one and the spiritual insight of the other. [Footnote: In 1830\r\nChanning published an essay, \"National Literature,\" in which he said that\r\nBenjamin Franklin and Jonathan Edwards were the only writers up to that\r\ntime who had worthily presented the American mind, with its practical and\r\nideal sides, to foreign readers.] With his idealism and individuality, his\r\nimagination that soars to heaven but is equally at home on solid earth, his\r\nsound judgment to balance his mysticism, his forceful style that runs from\r\nepigram to sustained eloquence, his straight-fibered manhood in which\r\ncriticism finds nothing to pardon or regret,--with all these sterling\r\nqualities he is one of the most representative writers that America has\r\never produced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HAWTHORNE (1804-1864)\r\n\r\nSome great writers belong to humanity, others to their own land or people.\r\nHawthorne is in the latter class apparently, for ever since Lowell rashly\r\ncharacterized him as \"the greatest imaginative genius since Shakespeare\"\r\nour critics commonly speak of him in superlatives. Meanwhile most European\r\ncritics (who acclaim such unequal writers as Cooper and Poe, Whitman and\r\nMark Twain) either leave Hawthorne unread or else wonder what Americans\r\nfind in him to stir their enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is that Hawthorne's field was so intensely local that only\r\nthose who are familiar with it can appreciate him. Almost any reader can\r\nenjoy Cooper, since he deals with adventurous men whom everybody\r\nunderstands; but Hawthorne deals with the New England Puritan of the\r\nseventeenth century, a very peculiar hero, and to enjoy the novelist one\r\nmust have some personal or historic interest in his subject. Moreover, he\r\nalienates many readers by presenting only the darker side of Puritanism. He\r\nis a man who never laughs and seldom smiles in his work; he passes over a\r\nhundred normal and therefore cheerful homes to pitch upon some gloomy\r\nhabitation of sin or remorse, and makes that the burden of his tale. In no\r\nother romancer do we find genius of such high order at work in so barren a\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n    LIFE. There is an air of reserve about Hawthorne which no biography\r\n    has ever penetrated. A schoolmate who met him daily once said, \"I\r\n    love Hawthorne; I admire him; but I do not know him. He lives in a\r\n    mysterious world of thought and imagination which he never permits\r\n    me to enter.\" That characterization applies as well to-day as when\r\n    it was first spoken, almost a century ago. To his family and to a\r\n    very few friends Hawthorne was evidently a genial man, [Footnote:\r\n    Intimate but hardly trustworthy pictures of Hawthorne and his\r\n    family are presented by his son, Julian Hawthorne, in _Nathaniel\r\n    Hawthorne and his Wife_. A dozen other memoirs have appeared;\r\n    but Hawthorne did not want his biography written, and there are\r\n    many unanswered questions in the story of his life.] but from the\r\n    world and its affairs he always held aloof, wrapped in his mantle\r\n    of mystery.\r\n\r\n    A study of his childhood may help us to understand the somber\r\n    quality of all his work. He was descended from the Puritans who\r\n    came to Boston with John Winthrop, and was born in the seaport of\r\n    Salem, Massachusetts, in 1804. He was only four years old when his\r\n    father, a sea captain, died in a foreign port; whereupon the mother\r\n    draped herself in weeds, retired from the sight of neighbors, and\r\n    for the next forty years made life as funereal as possible. Besides\r\n    the little boy there were two sisters in the family, and the elder\r\n    took her meals in her own room, as did the mother. The others went\r\n    about the darkened house on tiptoe, or peeped out at the world\r\n    through closed shutters.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE]\r\n\r\n    The shadow of that unnatural home was upon Hawthorne to the end of\r\n    his life; it accounts in part for his shyness, his fear of society,\r\n    his lack of interest in his own age or nation.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SECLUSION AT SALEM]\r\n\r\n    At seventeen Hawthorne went to Bowdoin College, where Longfellow\r\n    was his classmate and Franklin Pierce (later President of the\r\n    United States) one of his friends. His college life seems to have\r\n    been happy, even gay at times; but when he graduated (1825) and his\r\n    classmates scattered to find work in the world he returned to his\r\n    Salem home and secluded himself as if he had no interest in\r\n    humanity. It was doubtful, he said afterwards, whether a dozen\r\n    people knew of his existence in as many years.\r\n\r\n    All the while he was writing, gathering material for his romances\r\n    or patiently cultivating his fine style. For days he would brood\r\n    over a subject; then he would compose a story or parable for the\r\n    magazines. The stamp of originality was on all these works, but\r\n    they were seldom accepted. When they returned to him, having found\r\n    no appreciative editor, he was apt to burn them and complain that\r\n    he was neglected. Studying the man as he reveals himself at this\r\n    time in his _Note-Books_ (published in a garbled edition by\r\n    the Hawthorne family), one has the impression that he was a shy,\r\n    sensitive genius, almost morbidly afraid of the world. From a\r\n    distance he sent out his stories as \"feelers\", when these were\r\n    ignored he shrank into himself more deeply than before.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OLD CUSTOMHOUSE, BOSTON,\r\n    Where Hawthorne worked.]\r\n\r\n    Love brought him out of his retreat, as it has accomplished many\r\n    another miracle. When he became engaged his immediate thought was\r\n    to find work, and one of his friends secured a position for him in\r\n    the Boston customhouse, where he weighed coal until he was replaced\r\n    by a party spoilsman. [Footnote: Hawthorne profited three times by\r\n    the spoils system. When his Boston experience was repeated at Salem\r\n    he took his revenge in the opening chapter of _The Scarlet\r\n    Letter_, which ridicules those who received political jobs from\r\n    the other party.] There were no civil-service rules in those days.\r\n    Hoping to secure a home, he invested his savings in Brook Farm,\r\n    worked there for a time with the reformers, detested them, lost his\r\n    money and gained the experience which he used later in his\r\n    _Blithedale Romance_. Then he married, and lived in poverty\r\n    and great happiness for four years in the \"Old Manse\" at Concord.\r\n    Another friend obtained for him political appointment as surveyor\r\n    of the Salem customhouse; again he was replaced by a spoilsman, and\r\n    again he complained bitterly. The loss proved a blessing, however,\r\n    since it gave him leisure to write _The Scarlet Letter_, a\r\n    novel which immediately placed Hawthorne in the front rank of\r\n    American writers.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: FAREWELL GREATNESS]\r\n\r\n    He was now before an appreciative world, and in the flush of fine\r\n    feeling that followed his triumph he wrote _The House of the\r\n    Seven Gables, A Wonder Book_ and _The Snow Image_.\r\n    Literature was calling him most hopefully when, at the very prime\r\n    of life, he turned his back on fortune. His friend Pierce had been\r\n    nominated by the Democrats (1852), and he was asked to write the\r\n    candidate's biography for campaign purposes. It was hardly a worthy\r\n    task, but he accepted it and did it well. When Pierce was elected\r\n    he \"persuaded\" Hawthorne to accept the office of consul at\r\n    Liverpool. The emoluments, some seven thousand dollars a year,\r\n    seemed enormous to one who had lived straitly, and in the four\r\n    years of Pierce's administration our novelist saved a sum which,\r\n    with the income from his books, placed him above the fear of want.\r\n    Then he went for a long vacation to Italy, where he collected the\r\n    material for his _Marble Faun_. But he wrote nothing more of\r\n    consequence.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE UNFINISHED STORY]\r\n\r\n    The remainder of his life was passed in a pleasant kind of\r\n    hermitage in Emerson's village of Concord. His habits of solitude\r\n    and idleness (\"cursed habits,\" he called them) were again upon him;\r\n    though he began several romances--_Dr. Grimshawe's Secret_,\r\n    _Septimius Felton_, _The Ancestral Footstep_ and _The\r\n    Dolliver Romance_--he never made an end of them. In his work he\r\n    was prone to use some symbol of human ambition, and the symbol of\r\n    his own later years might well have been the unfinished manuscript\r\n    which lay upon the coffin when his body was laid under the pines in\r\n    the old Concord burying ground (1864). His friend Longfellow has\r\n    described the scene in his beautiful poem \"Hawthorne.\"\r\n\r\nSHORT STORIES AND SKETCHES. Many young people become familiar with\r\nHawthorne as a teller of bedtime stories long before they meet him in the\r\nrole of famous novelist. In his earlier days he wrote _Grandfather's\r\nChair_ (modeled on a similar work by Scott), dealing with Colonial\r\nlegends, and broadened his field in _Biographical Stories for\r\nChildren_. Other and better works belonging to the same juvenile class\r\nare _A Wonder Book_ (1851) and _Tanglewood Tales_ (1853), which\r\nare modern versions of the classic myths and stories that Greek mothers\r\nused to tell their children long ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PICTURES OF THE PAST]\r\n\r\nThe best of Hawthorne's original stories are collected in _Twice-Told\r\nTales_, _Mosses from an Old Manse_ and _The Snow Image and Other\r\nTwice-Told Tales_. As the bulk of this work is rather depressing we\r\nselect a few typical tales, arranging them in three groups. In the first\r\nare certain sketches, as Hawthorne called them, which aim not to tell a\r\nstory but to give an impression of the past. \"The Old Manse\" (in _Mosses\r\nfrom an Old Manse_) is an excellent introduction to this group. Others\r\nin which the author comes out from the gloom to give his humor a glimpse of\r\npale sunshine are \"A Rill from the Town Pump,\" \"Main Street,\" \"Little\r\nAnnie's Ramble,\" \"Sights from a Steeple\" and, as suggestive of Hawthorne's\r\nsolitary outings, \"Footprints on the Seashore.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALLEGORIES]\r\n\r\nIn the second group are numerous allegories and symbolical stories. To\r\nunderstand Hawthorne's method of allegory [Footnote: An allegory is a\r\nfigure of speech (in rhetoric) or a story (in literature) in which an\r\nexternal object is described in such a way that we apply the description to\r\nour own inner experience. Many proverbs, such as \"People who live in glass\r\nhouses should not throw stones,\" are condensed allegories. So also are\r\nfables and parables, such as the fable of the fox and the grapes, or the\r\nparable of the lost sheep. Bunyan's famous allegory, The Pilgrim's\r\nProgress, describes a journey from one city to another, but in reading it\r\nwe are supposed to think of a Christian's experience in passing through\r\nthis world to the next.] read \"The Snow Image,\" which is the story of a\r\nsnowy figure that became warm, living and companionable to some children\r\nuntil it was spoiled by a hard-headed person, without imagination or real\r\nsense, who forgot that he was ever a child himself or that there is such a\r\nbeautiful and precious thing as a child-view of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn his constant symbolism (that is, in his use of an outward sign or token\r\nto represent an idea) Hawthorne reflected a trait that is common to\r\nhumanity in all ages. Thus, every nation has its concrete symbol, its flag\r\nor eagle or lion; a great religion is represented by a cross or a crescent;\r\nin art and poetry the sword stands for war and the dove for peace; an\r\nindividual has his horseshoe or rabbit's foot or \"mascot\" as the simple\r\nexpression of an idea that may be too complex for words. Among primitive\r\npeople such symbols were associated with charms, magic, baleful or\r\nbenignant influences; and Hawthorne accepted this superstitious idea in\r\nmany of his works, though he was apt to hint, as in \"Lady Eleanor's\r\nMantle,\" that the magic of his symbol might have a practical explanation.\r\nIn this story the lady's gorgeous mantle is a symbol of pride; its\r\nblighting influence _may_ be due to the fact that,--but to tell the\r\nsecret is to spoil the story, and that is not fair to Hawthorne or the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BLACK VEIL]\r\n\r\nSome of these symbolic tales are too vague or shadowy to be convincing; in\r\nothers the author makes artistic use of some simple object, such as a\r\nflower or an ornament, to suggest the mystery that broods over every life.\r\nIn \"The Minister's Black Veil,\" for example, a clergyman startles his\r\ncongregation by appearing with a dark veil over his face. The veil itself\r\nis a familiar object; on a woman or a bonnet it would pass unnoticed; but\r\non the minister it becomes a portentous thing, at once fascinating and\r\nrepellent. Yesterday they knew the man as a familiar friend; to-day he is a\r\nstranger, and they fear him with a vague, nameless fear. Forty years he\r\nwears the mysterious thing, dies and is buried with it, and in all that\r\ntime they never have a glimpse of his face. Though there is a deal of\r\nnonsense in the story, and a hocus-pocus instead of a mystery, we must\r\nremember that veil as a striking symbol of the loneliness of life, of the\r\ngulf that separates a human soul from every other.\r\n\r\nAnother and better symbolic tale is \"The Great Stone Face,\" which appeals\r\nstrongly to younger readers, especially to those who have lived much out of\r\ndoors and who cherish the memory of some natural object, some noble tree or\r\nmossy cliff or singing brook, that is forever associated with their\r\nthoughts of childhood. To others the tale will have added interest in that\r\nit is supposed to portray the character of Emerson as Hawthorne knew him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEGENDARY TALES]\r\n\r\nIn the third group are numerous stories dealing with Colonial history, and\r\nof these \"The Gray Champion\" and \"The Gentle Boy\" are fairly typical.\r\nHawthorne has been highly praised in connection with these tales as \"the\r\nartist who created the Puritan in literature.\" Most readers will gladly\r\nrecognize the \"artist,\" since every tale has its line or passage of beauty;\r\nbut some will murmur at the \"creation.\" The trouble with Hawthorne was that\r\nin creating his Puritan he took scant heed of the man whom the Almighty\r\ncreated. He was not a scholar or even a reader; his custom was to brood\r\nover an incident of the past (often a grotesque incident, such as he found\r\nin Winthrop's old _Journal_), and from his brooding he produced an\r\nimaginary character, some heartless fanatic or dismal wretch who had\r\nnothing of the Puritan except the label. Of the real Puritan, who knew the\r\njoy and courtesy as well as the stern discipline of life, our novelist had\r\nonly the haziest notion. In consequence his \"Gentle Boy\" and parts also of\r\nhis _Scarlet Letter_ leave an unwarranted stain on the memory of his\r\nancestors. [Footnote: Occasionally, as in \"The Gray Champion\" and \"Endicott\r\nand the Red Cross,\" Hawthorne paints the stern courage of the Puritan, but\r\nnever his gentle or humane qualities. His typical tale presents the Puritan\r\nin the most unlovely guise. In \"The Maypole of Merrymount,\" for example,\r\nMorton and his men are represented as inoffensive, art-loving people who\r\nwere terrorized by the \"dismal wretches\" of a near-by colony of Puritans.\r\nNothing could be farther from the truth. Morton's crew were a lawless set\r\nand a scandal to New England; but they were tolerated until they put all\r\nthe settlements in danger by debauching the Indians and selling them rum,\r\nmuskets and gunpowder. The \"dismal wretches\" were the Pilgrims of\r\nPlymouth,--gentle, heroic men, lovers of learning and liberty, who\r\nprofoundly influenced the whole subsequent history of America.]\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR ROMANCES. The romances of Hawthorne are all studies of the effects\r\nof sin on human development. If but one of these romances is to be read,\r\nlet it be _The House of the Seven Gables_ (1851), which is a\r\npleasanter story than Hawthorne commonly tells, and which portrays one\r\ncharacter that he knew by experience rather than by imagination. Many of\r\nHawthorne's stories run to a text, and the text here is, \"The fathers have\r\neaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.\" The\r\ncharacters are represented as \"under a curse\"; [Foonote: This is a\r\nreflection of a family tradition. An ancestor of Hawthorne was judge at the\r\nSalem witch trials, in 1692. One of the poor creatures condemned to death\r\nis said to have left a curse on the judge's family. In his _Note\r\nBooks_ Hawthorne makes mention of the traditional curse, and analyzes\r\nits possible effect on his own character.] that is, they are bearing the\r\nburden and sorrow of some old iniquity committed before they were born; but\r\nthe affliction is banished in a satisfactory way without leaving us in the\r\nhaze of mystery that envelops so much of Hawthorne's work. His humor is\r\nalso in evidence, his interest in life overcomes for a time his absorption\r\nin shadowy symbols, and his whole story is brightened by his evident love\r\nof Phoebe Pyncheon, the most natural and winsome of all his characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE HOUSE OF SEVEN GABLES,\" SALEM (BUILT IN 1669)]\r\n\r\nThe other romances deal with the same general theme, the blighting effect\r\nof sin, but vary greatly in their scenes and characters. The _Marble\r\nFaun_ (published in England as _Transformation_, 1860) is the most\r\npopular, possibly because its scene is laid in Rome, a city to which all\r\ntravelers go, or aspire to go, before they die; but though it moves in \"an\r\natmosphere of art,\" among the studios of \"the eternal city,\" it is the\r\nleast artistic of all the author's works. [Footnote: The _Marble Faun_\r\nends in a fog, as if the author did not know what to do with his\r\ncharacters. It has the amateurish fault of halting the narrative to talk\r\nwith the reader; and it moralizes to such an extent that the heroine (who\r\nis pictured as of almost angelic virtue) eventually becomes a prig and a\r\npreacher,--two things that a woman must never be. Nevertheless, the romance\r\nhas a host of enthusiastic readers, and to criticize it adversely is to\r\nbring a storm about one's ears.] In _The Blithedale Romance_ (1852)\r\nHawthorne deals with the present rather than the past and apparently makes\r\nuse of his observation, since his scenes and characters are strongly\r\nsuggestive of the Brook Farm community of reformers, among whom he spent\r\none critical and unhappy year. _The Scarlet Letter_ (1850) is not only\r\nthe most original and powerful of the romances but is commonly ranked by\r\nour critics at the head of American fiction. The scene is laid in Boston,\r\nin the old Puritan days; the main characters are vividly drawn, and the\r\nplot moves to its gloomy but impressive climax as if Wyrd or Fate were at\r\nthe bottom of it.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF HAWTHORNE. Almost the first thing we notice in Hawthorne\r\nis his style, a smooth, leisurely, \"classic\" style which moves along, like\r\na meadow brook, without hurry or exertion. Gradually as we read we become\r\nconscious of the novelist's characters, whom he introduces with a veil of\r\nmystery around them. They are interesting, as dreams and other mysterious\r\nthings always are, but they are seldom real or natural or lifelike. At\r\ntimes we seem to be watching a pantomime of shadows, rather than a drama of\r\nliving men and women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: METHOD OF WORK]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these shadowy characters is found in Hawthorne's method\r\nof work, as revealed by the _Note-Books_ in which he stored his\r\nmaterial. Here is a typical record, which was occasioned, no doubt, by the\r\nauthor's meeting with some old nurse, whom he straightway changed from her\r\nreal semblance to a walking allegory:\r\n\r\n    \"Change from a gay young girl to an old woman. Melancholy events,\r\n    the effects of which have clustered around her character....\r\n    Becomes a lover of sick chambers, taking pleasure in receiving\r\n    dying breaths and laying out the dead. Having her mind full of\r\n    funeral reminiscences, and possessing more acquaintances beneath\r\n    the turf than above it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough of a story in itself; we need not read \"Edward Fane's\r\nRosebud\" to see how Hawthorne filled in the details. The strange thing is\r\nthat he never studied or questioned the poor woman to discover whether she\r\nwas anything like what he imagined her to be. On another page we read:\r\n\r\n    \"A snake taken into a man's stomach and nourished there from\r\n    fifteen to thirty five years, tormenting him most horribly.\" [Then\r\n    follows the inevitable moral.] \"Type of envy or some other evil\r\n    passion.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWTHORNE'S BIRTHPLACE, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS]\r\n\r\nThere are many such story-records in the _Note-Books_, but among them\r\nyou will find no indication that the story-teller ever examined the facts\r\nwith a purpose to discover whether a snake could survive thirty-five years,\r\nor minutes, in the acids of a human stomach, or how long a Puritan church\r\nwould tolerate a minister who went about with a veil on his face, or\r\nwhether any other of his symbols had any vital connection with human\r\nexperience. In a word, Hawthorne was prone to make life conform to his\r\nimagination, instead of making his imagination conform to life. Living as\r\nhe did in the twilight, between the day and the night, he seems to have\r\nmissed the chief lesson of each, the urge of the one and the repose of the\r\nother; and especially did he miss the great fact of cheerfulness. The\r\ndeathless courage of man, his invincible hope that springs to life under\r\nthe most adverse circumstances, like the cyclamen abloom under the snows of\r\nwinter,--this primal and blessed fact seems to have escaped his notice. At\r\ntimes he hints at it, but he never gives it its true place at the\r\nbeginning, middle and end of human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTIST AND MORALIST]\r\n\r\nThus far our analysis has been largely negative, and Hawthorne was a very\r\npositive character. He had the feeling of an artist for beauty; and he was\r\none of the few romancers who combine a strong sense of art with a puritanic\r\ndevotion to conscience and the moral law. Hence his stories all aim to be\r\nboth artistic and ethical, to satisfy our sense of beauty and our sense of\r\nright. In his constant moralizing he was like George Eliot; or rather, to\r\ngive the figure its proper sequence, George Eliot was so exclusively a\r\nmoralist after the Hawthornesque manner that one suspects she must have\r\nbeen familiar with his work when she began to write. Both novelists worked\r\non the assumption that the moral law is the basis of human life and that\r\nevery sin brings its inevitable retribution. The chief difference was that\r\nHawthorne started with a moral principle and invented characters to match\r\nit, while George Eliot started with a human character in whose experience\r\nshe revealed the unfolding of a moral principle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SOLITARY GENIUS]\r\n\r\nThe individuality of Hawthorne becomes apparent when we attempt to classify\r\nhim,--a vain attempt, since there is no other like him in literature. In\r\ndealing with almost any other novelist we can name his models, or at least\r\npoint out the story-tellers whose methods influenced his work; but\r\nHawthorne seems to have had no predecessor. Subject, style and method were\r\nall his own, developed during his long seclusion at Salem, and from them he\r\nnever varied. From his _Twice-Told Tales_ to his unfinished\r\n_Dolliver Romance_ he held steadily to the purpose of portraying the\r\nmoral law against a background of Puritan history.\r\n\r\nSuch a field would have seemed very narrow to other American writers, who\r\nthen, as now, were busy with things too many or things too new; but to\r\nHawthorne it was a world in itself, a world that lured him as the Indies\r\nlured Columbus. In imagination he dwelt in that somber Puritan world,\r\neating at its long-vanished tables or warming himself at its burnt-out\r\nfires, until the impulse came to reproduce it in literature. And he did\r\nreproduce it, powerfully, single-heartedly, as only genius could have done\r\nit. That his portrayal was inaccurate is perhaps a minor consideration; for\r\none writer must depict life as he meets it on the street or in books, while\r\nanother is confined to what Ezekiel calls \"the chambers of imagery.\"\r\nHawthorne's liberties with the facts may be pardoned on the ground that he\r\nwas not an historian but an artist. The historian tells what life has\r\naccomplished, the artist what life means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECONDARY WRITERS OF PROSE OR VERSE\r\n\r\nTHE POETS. Among the fifty or more poets of the period of conflict Henry\r\nTimrod, Paul Hamilton Hayne and Abram J. Ryan are notable for this reason,\r\nthat their fame, once local, seems to widen with the years. They are\r\ncommonly grouped as southern poets because of the war lyrics in which they\r\nvoiced the passionate devotion of the South to its leaders; but what makes\r\nthem now interesting to a larger circle of readers are their poems of an\r\nentirely different kind,--poems that reflect in a tender and beautiful way\r\nthe common emotions of men in all places and in all ages. Two other\r\nprominent singers of the southern school are Theodore O'Hara and James\r\nRyder Randall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY TIMROD]\r\n\r\nIn another group are such varied singers as Richard Henry Stoddard, George\r\nH. Boker, Henry Howard Brownell, Thomas B. Read, John G. Saxe, J. G.\r\nHolland and Bayard Taylor. These were all famous poets in their own day,\r\nand some of them were prolific writers, Holland and Taylor especially. The\r\nlatter produced thirty volumes of poems, essays, novels and sketches of\r\ntravel; but, with the exception of his fine translation of Goethe's\r\n_Faust_ and a few of his original lyrics, the works which he sent\r\nforth so abundantly are now neglected. He is typical of a hundred writers\r\nwho answer the appeal of to-day and win its applause, and who are forgotten\r\nwhen to-morrow comes with its new interests and its new favorites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE]\r\n\r\nFICTION WRITERS. Comparatively few novels were written during this period,\r\nperhaps because the terrible shadow of war was over the country and readers\r\nwere in no mood for fiction. The most popular romance of the age, and one\r\nof the most widely read books that America has ever produced, was _Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin_ (1852), which has been translated and dramatized into so\r\nmany tongues that it is known all over the earth. The author, Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe (1811-1896), wrote several other stories, all characterized\r\nby humor, kindness and intense moral earnestness. Some of these, such as\r\n_Oldtown Folks_, _The Minister's Wooing_, _The Pearl of Orr's\r\nIsland_ and _Oldtown Fireside Stories_ have decidedly more literary\r\ncharm than her famous story of slavery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TALES OF THE SEA]\r\n\r\nThe mid-century produced some very good sea stories, and in these we see\r\nthe influence of Cooper, who was the first to use the ocean successfully as\r\na scene of romantic interest. Dana's _Two Years before the Mast_\r\n(1840) was immensely popular when our fathers were boys. It contained,\r\nmoreover, such realistic pictures of sailor life that it was studied by\r\naspirants for the British and American navies in the days when the flag\r\nrippled proudly over the beautiful old sailing ships. This excellent book\r\nis largely a record of personal experience; but in the tales of Herman\r\nMelville (1819-1891) we have the added elements of imagination and\r\nadventure. _Typee_, _White Jacket_, _Moby Dick_,--these are\r\ncapital tales of the deep, the last-named especially.\r\n\r\n_Typee_ (a story well known to Stevenson, evidently) is remarkable for\r\nits graphic pictures of sailor life afloat and ashore in the Marquesas\r\nIslands, a new field in those days. The narrative is continued in _White\r\nJacket_, which tells of the return from the South Pacific aboard a\r\nman-of-war. In _Moby Dick_ we have the real experience of a sailorman\r\nand whaler (Melville himself) and the fictitious wanderings of a stout\r\ncaptain, a primeval kind of person, who is at times an interesting lunatic\r\nand again a ranting philosopher. In the latter we have an echo of Carlyle,\r\nwho was making a stir in America in 1850, and who affected Melville so\r\nstrongly that the latter soon lost his bluff, hearty, sailor fashion of\r\nwriting, which everybody liked, and assumed a crotchety style that nobody\r\ncared to read.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FROM ROMANCE TO REALISM]\r\n\r\nA few other novels of the period are interesting as showing the sudden\r\nchange from romance to realism, a change for which the war was partly\r\nresponsible, and which will be examined more closely in the following\r\nchapter. John Esten Cooke (1830-1886) may serve as a concrete example of\r\nthe two types of fiction. In his earlier romances, notably in _Leather\r\nStocking and Silk_ and _The Virginia Comedians_ (1854), he aimed to\r\ndo for the Cavalier society of the South what Hawthorne was doing for the\r\nold Puritan régime in New England; but his later stories, such as _Surrey\r\nof Eagle's Nest_, are chiefly notable for their realistic pictures of\r\nthe great war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ESTEN COOKE]\r\n\r\nThe change from romance to realism is more openly apparent in Theodore\r\nWinthrop and Edward Eggleston, whose novels deal frankly with pioneers of\r\nthe Middle West; not such pioneers as Cooper had imagined in _The\r\nPrairie_, but such plain men and women as one might meet anywhere beyond\r\nthe Alleghenies in 1850. Winthrop's _John Brent_ (1862) and\r\nEggleston's _The Hoosier Schoolmaster_ and _The Circuit Rider_\r\n(1874) are so true to a real phase of American life that a thoughtful\r\nreader must wonder why they are not better known. They are certainly\r\nrefreshing to one who tires of our present so-called realism with its\r\nabnormal or degenerate characters.\r\n\r\nMore widely read than any of the novelists just mentioned are certain\r\nothers who appeared in answer to the increasing demand of young people for\r\na good story. It is doubtful if any American writer great or small has\r\ngiven more pleasure to young readers than Louisa M. Alcott with her\r\n_Little Women_ (1868) and other stories for girls, or John T.\r\nTrowbridge, author of _Cudjo's Cave_, _Jack Hazard_, _A Chance\r\nfor Himself_ and several other juveniles that once numbered their boy\r\nreaders by tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUISA M. ALCOTT]\r\n\r\nTHOREAU. Among the many secondary writers of the period the most original\r\nand most neglected was Henry D. Thoreau (1817-1862), a man who differed\r\ngreatly from other mortals in almost every respect, but chiefly in this,\r\nthat he never was known to \"go with the crowd,\" not even on the rare\r\noccasions when he believed the crowd to be right. He was one of the few\r\npersons who select their own way through life and follow it without the\r\nslightest regard for the world's opinion.\r\n\r\nNumerous examples of Thoreau's oddity might be given, but we note here only\r\nhis strange determination to view life with his own eyes. This may appear a\r\nsimple matter until we reflect that most men measure life by what others\r\nhave said or written concerning life's values. They accept the standards of\r\ntheir ancestors or their neighbors; they conform themselves to a world in\r\nwhich governments and other long-established institutions claim their\r\nallegiance; they are trained to win success in such a world by doing one\r\nthing well, and to measure their success by the fame or money or office or\r\nsocial position which they achieve by a lifetime of labor and self-denial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY D. THOREAU]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS ORIGINALITY]\r\n\r\nThoreau sharply challenged this whole conception of life, which, he said,\r\nwas more a matter of habit than of reason or conviction. He saw in our\r\nsocial institutions as much of harm as of benefit to the individual. He\r\nlooked with distrust on all traditions, saying that he had listened for\r\nthirty years without hearing one word of sound advice from his elders. He\r\nwas a good workman and learned to do several things passing well; but he\r\nsaw no reason why a free man should repeat himself daily in a world of\r\ninfinite opportunities. Also he was a scholar, versed in classical lore and\r\nwidely read in oriental literature; but unlike his friend Emerson he seldom\r\nquoted the ancients, being more concerned with his own thoughts of life\r\nthan by the words of philosophers, and more fascinated by the wild birds\r\nthat ate crumbs from his table than by all the fabled gods of mythology. As\r\nfor success, the fame or money for which other men toiled seemed to him but\r\nempty bubbles; the only wealth he prized was his soul's increase in love\r\nand understanding: \"If the day and the night are such that you greet them\r\nwith joy, and life emits a fragrance like sweet-scented herbs--is more\r\nelastic, starry and immortal--that is your success.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WALDEN]\r\n\r\nThere are other interesting matters in Thoreau's philosophy, but these will\r\nappear plainly enough to one who reads his own record. His best-known work\r\nis _Walden_ (1854), a journal in which he recorded what he saw or\r\nthought or felt during the two years when he abandoned society to live in a\r\nhut on the shore of Walden Pond, near his native village of Concord. If\r\nthere be any definite lesson in the book, it is the proof of Thoreau's\r\ntheory that simplicity is needed for happiness, that men would be better\r\noff with fewer possessions, and that earning one's living should be a\r\nmatter of pleasure rather than of endless toil and anxiety. What makes\r\n_Walden_ valuable, however, is not its theories but its revelation of\r\nan original mind fronting the facts of life, its gleams of poetry and\r\nphilosophy, its startling paradoxes, its first-hand impressions of the\r\nworld, its nuggets of sense or humor, and especially its intimate\r\nobservation of the little wild neighbors in feathers or fur who shared\r\nThoreau's solitude. It is one of the few books in American literature that\r\nsuccessive generations have read with profit to themselves and with\r\nincreasing respect for the original genius who wrote it.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORIANS. The honored names of Bancroft, Sparks, Prescott, Motley and\r\nParkman are indicative of the importance attached to history-writing in\r\nAmerica ever since Colonial days, and of the remarkably fine and sometimes\r\nheroic quality of American historians. Another matter suggested by these\r\nnames is the changing standard or ideal of historical writing. In an\r\nearlier time history was a dry chronicle of important events, or of such\r\nevents as seemed important to the chronicler; at the present day it\r\nthreatens to degenerate into an equally dry chronicle of economic forces;\r\nand between these thirsty extremes are various highly colored records\r\nglorifying kings or conquerors or political parties as the chief things of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EPIC OF HISTORY]\r\n\r\nThese American historians had a different standard. They first consulted\r\nall available records to be sure of the facts or events. Then they closely\r\nexamined the scene in which the event had come to pass, knowing that\r\nenvironment is always a factor in human history. Finally they studied\r\nhistorical personages, not as others had described them but as they\r\nrevealed themselves in letters, diaries, speeches,--personal records\r\nrevealing human motives that all men understand, because man is everywhere\r\nthe same. From such a combination of event, scene and characters our\r\nhistorians wrote a dramatic narrative, giving it the heroic cast without\r\nwhich history, the prose epic of liberty, is little better than a dull\r\ncatalogue. Another very important matter was that they cultivated their\r\nstyle as well as their knowledge; they were literary men no less than\r\nhistorians, and in the conviction that the first object of literature is to\r\ngive pleasure they produced works that have charmed as well as instructed a\r\nmultitude of readers. There are chapters in Prescott's _Conquest of\r\nMexico_ and _Conquest of Peru_ over which one must sit up late, as\r\nover a novel of Scott; in Motley's _Rise of the Dutch Republic_ and\r\n_History of the United Netherlands_ there are scores of glowing\r\npassages dealing with great characters or great events which stir the\r\nreader like a tale of gallant adventure.\r\n\r\nPrescott deals with force in action, and the action at times seems to be an\r\nexaltation of violence and cruelty. Motley also delights in action; but he\r\nis at heart an apostle of liberty, or perhaps we should say, of the\r\nAmerican ideal of liberty, and his narrative often assumes the character of\r\na partisan chant of freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARKMAN]\r\n\r\nTo the native, at least, Francis Parkman (1823-1893) is probably the most\r\ninteresting of our historians, partly because of his lucid style and partly\r\nbecause of his American theme. Early in life he selected his subject (the\r\nOld French Wars) and spent the best part of forty years in making himself\r\nfamiliar not only with what occurred during the struggle between France and\r\nEngland for possession of the New World, but also with the primeval scene\r\nand all the motley characters of the fateful drama. It is doubtful if any\r\nother historian ever had a more minute knowledge of his subject; and the\r\nastonishing, the heroic part of the matter is that he attained this vast\r\nknowledge in spite of the handicap of almost constant suffering and\r\nblindness. In a dozen volumes he tells his story, volumes crowded with\r\naction or adventure, and written in such a vividly convincing style that\r\none has the impression that Parkman must have been an eye-witness of the\r\nevents which he describes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS PARKMAN]\r\n\r\nAmong these volumes the second part of _Pioneers of France in the New\r\nWorld_ and _La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West_ are\r\nrecommended to the beginner. The former deals with the career of Champlain,\r\nwho opened the way for future settlements in the North; the latter with one\r\nof the most adventurous, lion-hearted men that ever cheerfully faced toil\r\nand endless danger. Standing apart from Parkman's main theme is a single\r\nvolume, _The California and Oregon Trail_ (1849), which recounts the\r\npicturesque incidents of the author's trip through the Northwest, then an\r\nunknown country, with a tribe of unspoiled Indians. Those who like a tale\r\nof adventure need not go to fiction to find it, for it is here in Parkman's\r\nnarrative,--a tale of care-free wandering amid plains or mountains and,\r\nwhat is historically more important, a picture of a vanished life that will\r\nnever be seen here again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY. The period of conflict has no definite limits on either\r\n    side, but for convenience we may think of it as included between\r\n    the years 1840 and 1876. Its earlier years were filled with an\r\n    ever-increasing agitation of the questions of slavery and state\r\n    rights; its center was the Civil War; its close was the Centennial\r\n    Exposition at Philadelphia, which we have selected as an outward\r\n    symbol of a reunited country.\r\n\r\n    The most noticeable feature of the age, apart from the great war,\r\n    was its ceaseless political turmoil. Of deeper significance to the\r\n    student of literature was the profound mental unrest which showed\r\n    itself in reform movements, in various communistic societies like\r\n    Brook Farm, in an eager interest in the poetry of other nations, in\r\n    the establishment of college professorships of foreign literatures,\r\n    in the philosophical doctrine of transcendentalism, and in many\r\n    other efforts of mid-century Americans to enlarge their mental\r\n    horizon.\r\n\r\n    A host of minor writings of the period reflect the sectional\r\n    passions or interests that stirred our people deeply at the time,\r\n    but that are now almost forgotten. The comparatively small body of\r\n    major literature was concerned with the permanent ideals of America\r\n    or with the simple human feelings that have no age or nationality.\r\n    In general, it was a time of poetry rather than of prose, being\r\n    distinguished above all other periods of American literature by the\r\n    number and quality of its poets.\r\n\r\n    Our detailed study of the age includes: (1) The major or so-called\r\n    elder poets, Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, Lanier and\r\n    Whitman. (2) The life and work of Emerson, who was both poet and\r\n    prose writer. (3) The career of Hawthorne, the novelist of\r\n    Puritanism, who is commonly ranked at the head of American\r\n    fiction-writers. (4) A brief review of the secondary writers of\r\n    prose and verse. (5) An examination of the work of Thoreau, the\r\n    most individualistic writer in an age of individualism, and of\r\n    Parkman, whom we have selected as representative of the American\r\n    historians.\r\n\r\n    SELECTIONS FOR READING.

It was even\r\nsaid at the time of the Centennial Exposition that our countrymen had never\r\nmet, save on the battlefields of the Civil War, until the common interest\r\nin Jubilee Year drew men and women from the four quarters of America\r\n\"around the old family altar at Philadelphia.\" Whatever exaggeration there\r\nmay be in that fine poetic figure, it is certain that our literature, once\r\nconfined to a few schools or centers, began in the decade after 1870 to be\r\nbroadly representative of the whole country. Miller's _Songs of the\r\nSierras_, Hay's _Pike-County Ballads_, Harte's _Tales of the\r\nArgonauts_, Cable's _Old Creole Days_, Mark Twain's _Tom\r\nSawyer_, Miss Jewett's _Deephaven_, Stockton's _Rudder\r\nGrange_, Harris's _Uncle Remus_,--a host of surprising books\r\nsuddenly appeared with the announcement that America was too large for any\r\none man or literary school to be its spokesman. It is because of these new\r\nvoices, coming from North, South, East or West and heard with delight by\r\nthe whole nation, that we venture to call the years after 1876 the\r\nall-America period of our literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONTEMPORARY HISTORY]\r\n\r\nWe are still too near that period to make a history of it, for the simple\r\nreason that a true history implies distance and perspective. No historian\r\ncould read, much less measure and compare, a tenth part of the books that\r\nhave won recognition since 1876. In such works as he might select as\r\ntypical he must be governed by his own taste or judgment; and the writer\r\nwas never born who could by such personal standards forecast the judgment\r\nof time and of humanity. In a word, contemporary or \"up-to-date\" histories\r\nare vain attempts at the impossible; save in the unimportant matter of\r\nchronicling names or dates they are all alike untrustworthy. The student\r\nshould bear in mind, therefore, that the following summary of our recent\r\nliterature is based largely upon personal opinion; that it selects a few\r\nauthors by way of illustration, omitting many others who may be of equal or\r\ngreater importance. We are confronted by a host of books that serve the\r\nprime purpose of literature by giving pleasure; but what proportion of them\r\nare enduring books, or what few of them will be known to readers of the\r\nnext century as the _Sketch Book_ and _Snow-Bound_ are known to\r\nus,--these are questions that only Father Time can answer.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT STORY. The period after 1876 has been called the age of fiction,\r\nbut \"the short-story age\" might be a better name for it, since the short\r\nstory is apparently more popular than any other form of literature and\r\nsince it has been developed here more abundantly than in any other\r\nland,--possibly because America offers such an immense and ever-surprising\r\nfield to an author in search of a strange or picturesque tale. Readers of\r\nthe short story demand life and variety, and here are all races and tribes\r\nand conditions of men, living in all kinds of \"atmosphere\" from the\r\ntrapper's hut to the steel skyscraper and from the crowded city slums to\r\nthe vast open places where one's companionship is with the hills or the\r\nstars. Hence a double tendency in our recent stories, to make them\r\nexpressive of New World life and to make each story a reflection of some\r\npeculiar type of Americanism,--one of the many types that here meet in a\r\ncommon citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the above criticism may become evident by reviewing the\r\nhistory of the short story in America. Irving began with mere hints or\r\noutlines of stories (sketches he called them) and added a few legendary\r\ntales of the Dutch settlers on the Hudson. Then came Poe, dealing with the\r\nphantoms of his own brain rather than with human life or endeavor. Next\r\nappeared Hawthorne, who dealt largely in moral allegories and whose tales\r\nare always told in an atmosphere of mystery and twilight shadows. Finally,\r\nafter the war, came a multitude of writers who insisted on dealing with our\r\nAmerican life as it is, with miners, immigrants, money kings, mountaineers,\r\nplanters, cowboys, woodsmen,--a host of varied characters, each speaking\r\nthe speech and typifying the customs or ideals of his particular locality.\r\nIt was these _post-bellum_ writers who invented the so-called story of\r\nlocal color (a story true to a certain place or a certain class of men),\r\nwhich is America's most original contribution to the world's literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRET HARTE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRET HARTE]\r\n\r\nFrancis Bret Harte (1839-1902) is generally credited with the invention of\r\nthe local-color story; but he was probably indebted to earlier works of the\r\nsame kind, notably to Longstreet's _Georgia Scenes_ (1836) and\r\nBaldwin's _Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi_ (1853). He had\r\nfollowed the \"forty-niners\" to California in a headlong search for gold\r\nwhen, finding himself amid the picturesque scenes and characters of the\r\nearly mining camps, it suddenly occurred to him that he had before his eyes\r\na literary gold mine such as no other modern romancer had discovered.\r\nThereupon he wrote \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" (first published in _The\r\nOverland Monthly_, 1868), and followed it with \"The Outcasts of Poker\r\nFlat\" and \"Tennessee's Partner.\"\r\n\r\nThese stories took the literary world by storm, and almost overnight Harte\r\nbecame a celebrity. Following up his advantage he proceeded to write some\r\nthirty volumes of the same general kind, which were widely read and\r\npromptly forgotten. Though he was plainly too sentimental and sensational,\r\nthere was a sense of freshness or originality in his early stories and\r\npoems which made them wonderfully attractive. His first three tales were\r\nprobably his best, and they are still worth reading,--not for their\r\nliterary charm or truth but as interesting early examples of the\r\nlocal-color story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE W. CABLE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CABLE]\r\n\r\nThe interest aroused by the mining-camp tales influenced other American\r\nwriters to discover the neglected literary wealth of their several\r\nlocalities; but they were fortunately on guard against Harte's exaggerated\r\nsentimentality and related their stories with more art and more truth to\r\nnature. As a specific example read Cable's _Old Creole Days_ and\r\n_Madame Delphine_ with their exquisite pictures of life in the old\r\nFrench city of New Orleans. These are romances or creations of fancy, to be\r\nsure; but in their lifelike characters, their natural scenes and soft\r\nCreole dialect they are as realistic (that is, as true to a real type of\r\nAmerican life) as anything that can be found in literature. They are, in\r\nfact, studies as well as stories, such minute and affectionate studies of\r\nold people, old names and old customs as the great French novelist Balzac\r\nmade in preparation for his work. Though time holds its own secrets, one\r\ncan hardly avoid the conviction that _Old Creole Days_ and _Madame\r\nDelphine_ are not books of a day but permanent additions to American\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL STORY-WRITERS]\r\n\r\nCable was accompanied by so many other good writers that it would require a\r\nvolume to do them justice. We name only, by way of indicating the wide\r\nvariety that awaits the reader, the charming stories of Grace King and\r\nwriters Kate Chopin dealing with plantation life; the New England stories,\r\npowerful or brilliant or somber, of Sarah Orne Jewett, Rose Terry Cooke and\r\nMary E. Wilkins; the tender and cheery southern stories of Thomas Nelson\r\nPage; the impressive stories of mountaineer life by Mary Noailles Murfree\r\n(Charles Egbert Craddock); the humorous, _Alice-in-Wonderland_ kind of\r\nstories told by Frank Stockton; and a bewildering miscellany of other\r\nworks, of which the names Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Hamlin Garland, Alice\r\nFrench (Octave Thanet), Rowland Robinson, Frank Norris and Henry C. Bunner\r\nare as a brief but inviting index.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust at the present time to discriminate among these writers\r\nor to compare them with others, perhaps equally good, whom we have not\r\nnamed. Occasionally in the flood of short stories appears one that compels\r\nattention. Aldrich's \"Marjorie Daw,\" Edward Everett Hale's \"The Man without\r\na Country,\" Stockton's \"The Lady or the Tiger,\"--each of these impresses us\r\nso forcibly by its delicate artistry or appeal to patriotism or whimsical\r\nending that we hail it as a new classic, forgetting that the term \"classic\"\r\ncarries with it the implication of something old and proved, safe from\r\nchange or criticism. Undoubtedly a few of our recent stories deserve the\r\nname; they will be more widely known a century hence than they are now, and\r\nmay finally rank above \"Rip Van Winkle\" or \"The Gold Bug\" or \"The Snow\r\nImage\"; but until the perfect tale is sifted from the thousand that are\r\nalmost perfect, every ambitious critic is free to make his own prophecy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY E. WILKINS-FREEMAN]\r\n\r\nSOME RECENT NOVELISTS. There is a difference between our earlier and later\r\nfiction which becomes apparent when we compare specific examples. As a type\r\nof the earlier novel take Cooper's _The Spy_ or Longfellow's\r\n_Hyperion_ or Hawthorne's _The House of the Seven Gables_ or\r\nSimms's _Katherine Walton_ or Cooke's _The Virginia Comedians_,\r\nand read it in connection with a recent novel, such as Howells's _Annie\r\nKilburn_ or Miss Jewett's _Deephaven_ or Harold Frederick's\r\n_Illumination_ or James Lane Allen's _The Reign of Law_ or Frank\r\nNorris's _The Octopus_. Disregarding the important element of style,\r\nwe note that the earlier novels have a distant background in time or space;\r\nthat their chief interest lies in the story they have to tell; that they\r\ntake us far away from present reality into regions where people are more\r\nimpressive and sentiments more exalted than in our familiar, prosaic world.\r\nThe later novels interest us less by the story than by the analysis of\r\ncharacter; they deal with human life as it is here and now, not as we\r\nimagine it to have been elsewhere or in a golden age. In a word, our later\r\nnovels are realistic in purpose, and in this respect they are in marked\r\ncontrast with our novels of an earlier age, which are nearly all of the\r\nromantic kind. [Footnote: In the above comparison we have ignored a large\r\nnumber of recent novels that are quite as romantic as any written before\r\nthe war. Romance is still, as in all past ages, more popular than realism:\r\nwitness the millions of readers of Lew Wallace, E. P. Roe and other modern\r\nromancers.]\r\n\r\nThe realistic movement in American fiction began, as we have noted, with\r\nthe short-story writers; and presently the most talented of these writers,\r\nhaving learned the value of real scenes and characters, turned to the novel\r\nand produced works having the double interest of romance and realism; that\r\nis, they told an old romantic tale of love or heroism and set it amid\r\nscenes or characters that were typical of American life. Miss Jewett's\r\nnovels of northern village life, for example, are even finer than her short\r\nstories in the same field. The same criticism applies to Miss Murfree with\r\nher novels of mountaineer life in Tennessee, to James Lane Allen with his\r\nnovels of his native Kentucky, and to many another recent novelist who\r\ntells a brave tale of his own people. We call these, in the conventional\r\nway, novels of New England or the South or the West; in reality they are\r\nnovels of humanity, of the old unchanging tragedies or comedies of human\r\nlife, which seem more true or real to us because they appear in a familiar\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nThere is another school of realism which subordinates the story element,\r\nwhich avoids as untrue all unusual or heroic incidents and deals with\r\nordinary men or women; and of this school William Dean Howells is a\r\nconspicuous example. Judging him by his novels alone it would be difficult\r\nto determine his rank; but judging him by his high aim and distinguished\r\nstyle (a style remarkable for its charm and purity in an age too much\r\ninfluenced by newspaper slang and smartness) he is certainly one of the\r\nbest of our recent prose writers. Since his first modest volume appeared in\r\n1860 he has published many poems, sketches of travel, appreciations of\r\nliterature, parlor comedies, novels,--an immense variety of writings; but\r\nwhatever one reads of his sixty-odd books, whether _Venetian Life_ or\r\n_A Boys' Town_, one has the impression of an author who lives for\r\nliterature, who puts forth no hasty or unworthy work, and who aims steadily\r\nto be true to the best traditions of American letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS]\r\n\r\nIn middle life Howells turned definitely to fiction and wrote, among\r\nvarious other novels, _A Woman's Reason_, _The Minister's\r\nCharge_, _A Modern Instance_ and _The Rise of Silas Lapham_.\r\nThese are all realistic in that they deal frankly with contemporary life;\r\nbut in their plots and conventional endings they differ but little from the\r\ntypical romance. [Footnote: Several of Howells's earlier novels deal with\r\nNew England life, but superficially and without understanding. However\r\nminutely they depict its manners or mannerisms they seldom dip beneath the\r\nsurface. If the reader wants not the body but the soul of New England, he\r\nmust go to some other fiction writer, to Sarah Orne Jewett, for example, or\r\nto Rose Terry Cooke] Then Howells fell under the influence of Tolstoi and\r\nother European realists, and his later novels, such as _Annie\r\nKilburn_, _A Hazard of New Fortunes_ and _The Quality of\r\nMercy_, are rather aimless studies of the speech, dress, mannerisms and\r\ninanities of American life with precious little of its ideals,--which are\r\nthe only things of consequence, since they alone endure. He appears here as\r\nthe photographer rather than the painter of American life, and his work has\r\nthe limited interest of another person's family album.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARK TWAIN]\r\n\r\nAnother realist of a very different kind is Samuel L. Clemens (1835-1910),\r\nwho is more widely known by his pseudonym of Mark Twain. He grew up, he\r\ntells us, in \"a loafing, down-at-the-heels town in Missouri\"; he was\r\neducated \"on the river,\" and in most of his work he attempted to deal with\r\nthe rough-and-ready life which he knew intimately at first hand. His\r\n_Life on the Mississippi_, a vivid delineation of river scenes and\r\ncharacters, is perhaps his best work, or at least the most true to his aim\r\nand his experience. _Roughing It_ is another volume from his store of\r\npersonal observation, this time in the western mining camps; but here his\r\nrealism goes as far astray from truth as any old romance in that it\r\nexaggerates even the sensational elements of frontier life.\r\n\r\nThe remaining works of Mark Twain are, with one or two exceptions, of very\r\ndoubtful value. Their great popularity for a time was due largely to the\r\nauthor's reputation as a humorist,--a strange reputation it begins to\r\nappear, for he was at heart a pessimist, an iconoclast, a thrower of\r\nstones, and with the exception of his earliest work, _The Celebrated\r\nJumping Frog_ (1867), which reflected some rough fun or horseplay, it is\r\nquestionable whether the term \"humorous\" can properly be applied to any of\r\nhis books. Thus the blatant _Innocents Abroad_ is not a work of humor\r\nbut of ridicule (a very different matter), which jeers at travelers who\r\nprofess admiration for the scenery or institutions of Europe,--an\r\nadmiration that was a sham to Mark Twain because he was incapable of\r\nunderstanding it. So with the grotesque capers of _A Connecticut Yankee\r\nat King Arthur's Court_, with the sneering spirit of _The Man that\r\nCorrupted Hadleyburg_, with the labored attempts to be funny of\r\n_Adam's Diary_ and with other alleged humorous works; readers of the\r\nnext generation may ask not what we found to amuse us in such works but how\r\nwe could tolerate such crudity or cynicism or bad taste in the name of\r\nAmerican humor.\r\n\r\nThe most widely read of Mark Twain's works are _Tom Sawyer_ and\r\n_Huckleberry Finn_. The former, a glorification of a liar and his\r\ndime-novel adventures, has enough descriptive power to make the story\r\nreadable, but hardly enough to disguise its sensationalism, its\r\nlawlessness, its false standards of boy life and American life. In\r\n_Huckleberry Finn_, a much better book, the author depicts the life of\r\nthe Middle West as seen by a homeless vagabond. With a runaway slave as a\r\ncompanion the hero, Huck Finn, drifts down the Mississippi on a raft,\r\nmeeting with startling experiences at the hands of quacks and imposters of\r\nevery kind. One might suppose, if one took this picaresque record\r\nseriously, that a large section of our country was peopled wholly by knaves\r\nand fools. The adventures are again of a sensational kind; but the\r\ncharacters are powerfully drawn, and the vivid pictures of the mighty river\r\nby day or night are among the best examples of descriptive writing in our\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRANE AND NORRIS]\r\n\r\nStill another type of realism is suggested by the names Stephen Crane and\r\nFrank Norris. These young writers, influenced by the French novelist Zola,\r\ncondemned the old romance as false and proclaimed, somewhat grandly at\r\nfirst, that they would tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth. Then they straightway forgot that health and moral sanity are the\r\ntruth of life, and proceeded to deal with degraded or degenerate characters\r\nas if these were typical of humanity. Their earlier works are studies of\r\nbrutality, miscalled realism; but later Crane wrote his _Red Badge of\r\nCourage_ (a rather wildly imaginative story of the Civil War), and\r\nNorris produced works of real power in _The Octopus_ and _The\r\nPit_, one a prose epic of the railroad, the other of a grain of wheat\r\nfrom the time it is sown in the ground until it becomes a matter of good\r\nfood or of crazy speculation. There is an impression of vastness, of\r\ncontinental breadth and sweep, in these two novels which sets them apart\r\nfrom all other fiction of the period.\r\n\r\nThe flood of dialect stories which appeared after 1876 may seem at first\r\nglance to be mere variations of Bret Harte's local-color stories, but they\r\nare something more and better than that. The best of them--such, for\r\nexample, as Page's _In Ole Virginia_ or Rowland Robinson's _Danvis\r\nFolk_--are written on the assumption that we can never understand a man,\r\nthat is, the soul of a man, unless we know the very language in which he\r\nexpresses his thought or feeling. These dialect stories, therefore, are\r\nintimate studies of American life rather than of local speech or manners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HARRIS]\r\n\r\nJoel Chandler Harris (1848-1908) is not our best writer of dialect stories\r\nbut only the happy and most fortunate man who wrote _Uncle Remus_\r\n(1880), and wrote it, by the way, as part of his day's work as a newspaper\r\nman, without a thought that it was a masterpiece, a work of genius. The\r\nfirst charm of the book is that it fascinates children with its frolicsome\r\nadventures of Brer Rabbit, Brer Tarrypin, Brer B'ar, Brer Fox and the\r\nwonderful Tar Baby; the second, that it combines in a remarkable way a\r\nprimitive or universal with a local and intensely human interest. Thus,\r\nalmost everybody is interested in folklore, especially in the animal\r\nstories which are part of the tradition of every primitive tribe; but\r\nfolklore, as commonly written, is not a branch of fiction but of science.\r\nBefore it can enter the golden door of literature it must find or create\r\nsome human character who interests us not by his stories but by his\r\nhumanity; and Harris furnished this character in the person of Uncle Remus,\r\na very lovable old plantation negro, drawn with absolute fidelity to life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS]\r\n\r\nOther novelists have portrayed a negro in fiction, but Harris did a more\r\noriginal work by creating his Brer Rabbit. In the adventures of this\r\nhappy-go-lucky creature, with his childishness and humor, we have the\r\nsymbol not of any one negro but of the whole race of negroes as the author\r\nknew them intimately in a condition of servitude. The creation of these two\r\noriginal characters, as real as Poor Richard or Natty Bumppo and far more\r\nfascinating, is one of the most notable achievements of American fiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROBLEM NOVELS]\r\n\r\nAside from the realistic movement, our recent fiction is like a river\r\nflowing sluggishly over hidden bowlders: the surface is so broken by\r\nwhirlpools, eddies and aimless flotsam that it is difficult to determine\r\nthe main current. Here our attention is attracted by clever stories of\r\n\"society in the making,\" there by somber problem-novels dealing with city\r\nslums, lonely farms, department stores, political rings, business\r\ncorruption, religious creeds, social injustice,--with every conceivable\r\nmatter that can furnish a novelist not with a story but with a cry for\r\nreform. The propaganda novel is evidently a favorite in America; but\r\nwhether it has any real influence in reforming abuses, as the novels of\r\nDickens led to better schools and prisons in England, is yet to be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nOccasionally appears a reform novel great enough to make us forget the\r\nreform, such as Helen Hunt Jackson's _Ramona_ (1884). This famous\r\nstory began as an attempt to plead the cause of the oppressed Indian, to do\r\nfor him what _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ was supposed to have done for the\r\nnegro; it ended in an idyllic story so well told that readers forgot to\r\ncry, \"Lo, the poor Indian,\" as the author intended. At the present time\r\n_Ramona_ is not classed with the problem-novels but with the most\r\nreadable of American romances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POPULAR ROMANCES]\r\n\r\nWhile the new realistic novel occupied the attention of critics the old\r\nromance had, as usual, an immensely larger number of readers. Moral\r\nromances with a happy ending have always been popular, and of these E. P.\r\nRoe furnished an abundance. His _Barriers Burned Away_, _A Face\r\nIllumined_, _Opening of a Chestnut Burr_ and _Nature's Serial\r\nStory_ depict American characters in an American landscape, and have a\r\nwholesome atmosphere of manliness and cleanness that makes them eminently\r\n\"safe\" reading. Unfortunately they are melodramatic and sentimental, and\r\ncritics commonly sneer or jeer at them; but that is not a rational\r\ncriticism. Romances that won instant welcome from a host of readers and\r\nthat are still widely known after half a century have at least \"the power\r\nto live\"; and vitality, the quality that makes a character or a story\r\nendure, is always one of the marks of a good romance.\r\n\r\nAnother romancer untouched by the zeal for realism was Marion Crawford, who\r\nin a very interesting essay, _The Novel_, proclaimed with some show of\r\nreason that the novel was simply a \"pocket theater,\" a convenient stage\r\nwhereon the reader could enjoy by himself any comedy or tragedy that\r\npleased him. That Crawford lived abroad the greater part of his life and\r\nwas familiar with society in a dozen countries may explain the fact that\r\nhis forty-odd novels are nearly all of the social kind. His Roman novels,\r\n_Saracinesca_, _Sant' Ilario_ and a dozen others, are perhaps his\r\nbest work. They are good stories; they take us among cultured foreign\r\npeople and give us glimpses of a life that is hidden from most travelers;\r\nbut they are superficial and leave the impression that the author was a man\r\nwithout much heart, that he missed the deeper meanings of life because he\r\nhad little interest in them. His characters are as puppets that are sent\r\nthrough a play for our amusement and for no other reason. In this, however,\r\nhe remained steadily true to his own ideal of fiction as a convenient\r\nsubstitute for the theater. Moreover, he was a good workman; his stories\r\nwere for the most part well composed and very well written.\r\n\r\nMore popular even than the romances of Roe and Crawford are the stories\r\nwith a background of Colonial or Revolutionary history, a type to which\r\nAmerica has ever given hearty welcome. Ford's _Janice Meredith_,\r\nMitchell's _Hugh Wynne_, Mary Johnston's _To Have and to Hold_,\r\nMaurice Thompson's _Alice of Old Vincennes_, Churchill's _Richard\r\nCarvel_,--the reader can add to the list of recent historical romances\r\nalmost indefinitely; but no critic can now declare which shall be called\r\ngreat among them. To the same interesting group of writers belong Lew\r\nWallace, whose enormously popular _Ben Hur_ has obscured his better\r\nstory, _The Fair God_, and Mary Hartwell Catherwood, whose _Lady of\r\nFort St. John_ and other stirring tales of the Northwest have the same\r\nsavage wilderness background against which Parkman wrote his histories.\r\n\r\nFor other romances of the period we have no convenient term except to call\r\nthem old-fashioned. Such, for instance, are Blanche Willis Howard's _One\r\nSummer_ and Arthur Sherburne Hardy's _Passe Rose_ and _But Yet a\r\nWoman_,--pleasant, leisurely, exquisitely finished romances, which\r\nbelong to no particular time or place and which deserve the fine old name\r\nof romance, because they seem to grow young rather than old with the\r\npassing years.\r\n\r\nPOETRY SINCE 1876. It is commonly assumed that the last half century has\r\nbeen almost exclusively an age of prose. The student of literature knows,\r\non the contrary, that one difficulty of judging our recent poetry lies in\r\nthe amount and variety of it. Since 1876 more poetry has been published\r\nhere than in all the previous years of our history; and the quality of it,\r\nif one dare judge it as a whole, is surprisingly good. The designation of\r\n\"the prose age,\" therefore, should not blind us to the fact that America\r\nnever had so many poets as at present. Whether a future generation will\r\nrank any of these among our elder poets is another question. Of late years\r\nwe have had no singer to compare with Longfellow, to be sure; but we have\r\nhad a dozen singers who reflect the enlarging life of America in a way of\r\nwhich Longfellow never dreamed. He lived mostly in the past and was busy\r\nwith legends, folklore, songs of the night; our later singers live in the\r\npresent and write songs of the day. And this suggests the chief\r\ncharacteristic of recent poetry; namely, that it aims to be true to life as\r\nit is here and now rather than to life as it was romantically supposed to\r\nbe in classic or medieval times. [Footnote: The above characterization\r\napplies only to the best, or to what most critics deem best, of our recent\r\npoetry. It takes no account of a large mass of verse which leaves an\r\nimpression of faddishness in the matter of form or phrase or subject. Such\r\nverse appeals to the taste of the moment, but Time has an effective way of\r\ndealing with it and with all other insincerities in literature.]\r\n\r\nThis emancipation of our poetry from the past, with the loss and gain which\r\nsuch a change implies, was not easily accomplished, and the terrible\r\nreality of the great war was perhaps the decisive factor in the struggle.\r\nBefore the war our poetry was largely conventional, imitative, sentimental;\r\nand even after the war, when Miller's _Songs of the Sierras_ and John\r\nHay's _Pike-County Ballads_ began to sing, however crudely, of\r\nvigorous life, the acknowledged poets and critics of the time were\r\nscandalized. Thus, to read the letters of Bayard Taylor is to meet a poet\r\nwho bewails the lack of poetic material in America and who \"hungers,\" as he\r\nsays, for the romance and beauty of other lands. He writes _Songs of the\r\nOrient_, _Lars: a Pastoral of Norway_, _Prince Deukalion_ and\r\nmany other volumes which seem to indicate that poetry is to be found\r\neverywhere save at home. Even his \"Song of the Camp\" is located in the\r\nCrimea, as if heroism and tenderness had not recently bloomed on a hundred\r\nsouthern battlefields. So also Stedman wrote his _Alectryon_ and\r\n_The Blameless Prince_, and Aldrich spent his best years in making\r\nartificial nosegays (as Holmes told him frankly) when he ought to have been\r\nmaking poems. These and many other poets said proudly that they belonged to\r\nthe classic school; they all read Shelley and Keats, dreamed of medieval or\r\nclassic beauty, and in unnumbered reviews condemned the crudity of those\r\nwho were trying to find beauty at their own doors and to make poetry of the\r\nstuff of American life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STEDMAN AND ALDRICH]\r\n\r\nIt was the war, or rather the new American spirit that issued from the war,\r\nwhich finally assured these poets and critics that mythology and legend\r\nwere, so far as America was concerned, as dead as the mastodon, and that\r\nlife itself was the only vitally interesting subject of poetry. Edmund\r\nClarence Stedman (1833-1908), after writing many \"finished\" poems that were\r\npraised and forgotten, manfully acknowledged that he had been following the\r\nwrong trail and turned at last to the poetry of his own people. His\r\n_Alice of Monmouth_, an idyl of the war, and a few short pieces, such\r\nas \"Wanted: a Man,\" are the only parts of his poetical works that are now\r\nremembered. Thomas Bailey Aldrich (1836-1907) went through the same\r\ntransformation. He had a love of formal beauty, and in the exquisite finish\r\nof his verse has had few rivals in American poetry; but he spent the great\r\npart of his life in making pretty trifles. Then he seemed to waken to the\r\nmeaning of poetry as a noble expression of the truth or beauty of this\r\npresent life, and his last little book of _Songs and Sonnets_ contains\r\npractically all that is worth remembering of his eight or nine volumes of\r\nverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOAQUIN MILLER]\r\n\r\nOne of the first in time of the new singers was Cincinnatus Heine Miller\r\nor, as he is commonly known, Joaquin Miller (1841-1912). His _Songs of\r\nthe Sierras_ (1871) and other poems of the West have this advantage,\r\nthat they come straight from the heart of a man who has shared the stirring\r\nlife he describes and who loves it with an overmastering love. To read his\r\n_My Own Story_ or the preface to his _Ship in the Desert_ is to\r\nunderstand from what fullness of life came lines like these:\r\n\r\n  Room! room to turn round in, to breathe and be free,\r\n  To grow to be giant, to sail as at sea\r\n  With the speed of the wind on a steed with his mane\r\n  To the wind, without pathway or route or a rein.\r\n  Room! room to be free, where the white-bordered sea\r\n  Blows a kiss to a brother as boundless as he;\r\n  Where the buffalo come like a cloud on the plain,\r\n  Pouring on like the tide of a storm-driven main,\r\n  And the lodge of the hunter to friend or to foe\r\n  Offers rest, and unquestioned you come or you go.\r\n  My plains of America! seas of wild lands!...\r\n  I turn to you, lean to you, lift you my hands.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was a splendid promise in Miller, but the promise was never\r\nfulfilled. He wrote voluminously, feeling that he must express the lure and\r\nmagic of the boundless West; but he wrote so carelessly that the crude bulk\r\nof his verse obscures the originality of his few inspired lines. To read\r\nthe latter is to be convinced that he was a true poet who might have\r\naccomplished a greater work than Whitman, since he had more genius and\r\nmanliness than the eastern poet possessed; but his personal oddities, his\r\nzeal for reforms, his love of solitude, his endless quest after some\r\nunnamed good which kept him living among the Indians or wandering between\r\nMexico and the ends of Alaska,--all this hindered his poetic development.\r\nIt may be that an Indian-driven arrow, which touched his brain in one of\r\nhis numerous adventures, had something to do with his wanderings and his\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThere is a poetry of thought that can be written down in words, and there\r\nis another poetry of glorious living, keenly felt in the winds of the\r\nwilderness or the rush of a splendid horse or the flight of a canoe through\r\nthe rapids, for which there is no adequate expression. Miller could feel\r\nsuperbly this poetry of the mountaineer, the plainsman and the voyageur;\r\nthat he could even suggest or half reveal it to others makes him worthy to\r\nbe named among our most original singers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IRWIN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\nThe hundred other poets of the period are too near for criticism, too\r\nvaried even for classification; but we may at least note two or three\r\nsignificant groupings. In one group are the dialect poets, who attempt to\r\nmake poetry serve the same end as fiction of the local-color school. Irwin\r\nRussell, with his gay negro songs tossed off to the twanging accompaniment\r\nof his banjo, belongs in this group. His verses are notable not for their\r\ndialect (others have done that better) but for their fidelity to the negro\r\ncharacter as Russell had observed it in the old plantation days. There is\r\nlittle of poetic beauty in his work; it is chiefly remarkable for its\r\npromise, for its opening of a new field of poesie; but unfortunately the\r\npromise was spoiled by the author's fitful life and his untimely death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOAQUIN MILLER]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CARLETON AND RILEY]\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the dialect group in their effective use of the homely\r\nspeech of country people are several popular poets, of whom Will Carleton\r\nand James Whitcomb Riley are the most conspicuous. Carleton's \"Over the\r\nHills to the Poorhouse\" and other early songs won him a wide circle of\r\nreaders; whereupon he followed up his advantage with _Farm Ballads_\r\nand other volumes filled with rather crude but sincere verses of home and\r\nchildhood. For half a century these sentimental poems were as popular as\r\nthe early works of Longfellow, and they are still widely read by people who\r\nlike homely themes and plenty of homely sentiment in their poetry.\r\n\r\nRiley won an even larger following with his _Old Swimmin' Hole_,\r\n_Rhymes of Childhood Days_ and a dozen other volumes that aimed to\r\nreflect in rustic language the joys and sorrows of country people. Judged\r\nby the number of his readers he would be called the chief poet of the\r\nperiod; but judged by the quality of his work it would seem that he wrote\r\ntoo much, and wrote too often \"with his eye on the gallery.\" He was\r\nprimarily an entertainer, a platform favorite, and in his impersonation of\r\ncountry folk was always in danger of giving his audience what he thought\r\nthey would like, not what he sincerely felt to be true. Hence the\r\nimpression of the stage and a \"make-up\" in a considerable part of his work.\r\nAt times, however, Riley could forget the platform and speak from the heart\r\nas a plain man to plain men. His work at such moments has a deeper note,\r\nmore simple and sincere, and a few of his poems will undoubtedly find a\r\npermanent place in American letters. The best feature of his work is that\r\nhe felt no need to go far afield, to the Orient or to mythology, but found\r\nthe beauty of fine feeling at his door and dared to call one of his\r\ncollections _Poems Here at Home_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYPICAL POETS]\r\n\r\nIn a third group of recent poets are those who try to reflect the feeling\r\nof some one type or race of the many that make up the sum total of American\r\nlife. Such are Emma Lazarus, speaking finely for the Jewish race, and Paul\r\nLawrence Dunbar, voicing the deeper life of the negro,--not the negro of\r\nthe old plantation but the negro who was once a slave and must now prove\r\nhimself a man. In the same group we are perhaps justified in placing Lucy\r\nLarcom, singing for the mill girls of New England, and Eugene Field, who\r\nshows what fun and sentiment may brighten the life of a busy newspaper man\r\nin a great city.\r\n\r\nFinally come a larger number of poets who cannot be grouped, who sing each\r\nof what he knows or loves best: Celia Thaxter, of the storm-swept northern\r\nocean; Madison Cawein, of nature in her more tender moods; Edward Rowland\r\nSill, of the aspirations of a rare Puritan soul. More varied in their\r\nthemes are Edith Thomas, Emily Dickinson, Henry C. Bunner, Richard Watson\r\nGilder, George Edward Woodberry, William Vaughn Moody, Richard Hovey, and\r\nseveral others who are perhaps quite as notable as any of those whom we\r\nhave too briefly reviewed. They all sing of American life in its wonderful\r\ncomplexity and have added poems of real merit to the book of recent\r\nAmerican verse. And that is a very good book to read, more inspiring and\r\nperhaps more enduring than the popular book of prose fiction.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS PROSE. The historian who is perplexed by our recent poetry or\r\nfiction must be overwhelmed by the flood of miscellaneous works covering\r\nevery field of human endeavor. As one who wanders through a forest has no\r\nconception of the forest itself but only of individual trees, so the reader\r\nof latter-day literature can form no distinct impression of it as a whole\r\nbut must linger over the individual authors who happen to attract his\r\nattention. Hence in all studies of contemporary literature we have the\r\ninevitable confusion of what is important with what merely seems so because\r\nof its nearness or newness or appeal to our personal interests. The reader\r\nis amused by a _David Harum_, or made thoughtful by a _Looking\r\nBackward_, or wonderstruck by a _Life of Lincoln_ as big as a\r\nten-volume history; and he thinks, \"This is surely a book to live.\" But a\r\nyear passes and _David Harum_ is eclipsed by a more popular hero of\r\nfiction, _Looking Backward_ is relegated to the shelf of forgotten\r\ntracts, and Nicolay and Hay's \"monumental\" biography becomes a source book,\r\nwhich someone, it is to be hoped, will some day use in making a life of\r\nLincoln that will be worthy of the subject and of the name of literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE WRITERS]\r\n\r\nThere is one feature in our recent literature, however, which attracts the\r\nattention of all critics; namely, the number of nature writers who have\r\nrevealed to us the beauty of our natural environment, as Ruskin awakened\r\nhis readers to the beauty of art and Joaquin Miller to the unsung glory of\r\nthe pioneers. In this respect, of adding to our enjoyment of human life by\r\na new valuation of all life, our nature literature has no parallel in any\r\nage or nation.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, one must search continental literatures carefully to find\r\neven a single book that belongs unmistakably to the outdoor school. In\r\nEnglish literature we find several poets who sing occasionally of the\r\ncharms of nature, but only two books in fourteen centuries of writing that\r\ndeal frankly with the great outdoors for its own sake: one is Isaac\r\nWalton's _Complete Angler_ (1653), the other Gilbert White's\r\n_Natural History of Selborne_ (1789). [Footnote: There were other\r\nworks of a scientific nature, and some of exploration, but no real nature\r\nbooks until the first notable work of Richard Jefferies (one of the best of\r\nnature writers) appeared in 1878. By that time the nature movement in\r\nAmerica was well under way.] In American literature the story is shorter\r\nbut of the same tenor until recent times. From the beginning we have had\r\nmany journals of exploration; but though the joy of wild nature is apparent\r\nin such writings, they were written to increase our knowledge, not our\r\npleasure in life. Josselyn's _New England's Rarities_ (1672),\r\nAlexander Wilson's _American Ornithology_ (1801), Audubon's _Birds\r\nof America_ (1827),--these were our nearest approach to nature books\r\nuntil Thoreau's _Walden_ (1854) called attention to the immense and\r\nfascinating field which our writers had so long overlooked.\r\n\r\nThoreau, it will be remembered, was neglected by his own generation; but\r\nafter the war, when writers began to use the picturesque characters of\r\nplantation or mining camp as the material for a new American literature,\r\nthen the living world of nature seemed suddenly opened to their vision.\r\nBradford Torrey, himself a charming nature writer, edited Thoreau's\r\njournals, and lo! these neglected chronicles became precious because the\r\neyes of America were at last opened. Maurice Thompson wrote as a poet and\r\nscholar in the presence of nature, John Muir as a reverent explorer, and\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson as an artist with an eye single to beauty; then in\r\nrapid succession came Charles Abbott, Rowland Robinson, John Burroughs,\r\nOlive Thorne Miller, Florence Bailey, Frank Bolles, and a score more of a\r\nsomewhat later generation. Most of these are frankly nature writers, not\r\nscientists; they aim not simply to observe the shy, fleeting life of the\r\nwoods or fields but to reflect that life in such a way as to give us a new\r\npleasure by awakening a new sense of beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable spectacle, this rediscovery of nature in an age supposed\r\nto be given over to materialism, and its influence appears in every branch\r\nof our literature. The nature writers have evidently done a greater work\r\nthan they knew; they have helped a multitude of people to enjoy the beauty\r\nof a flower without pulling it to pieces for a Latin name, to appreciate a\r\nliving bird more than a stuffed skin, and to understand what Thoreau meant\r\nwhen he said that the _anima_ of an animal is the only interesting\r\nthing about him. Because they have given us a new valuation of life, a new\r\nsense of its sacredness and mystery, their work may appeal to a future\r\ngeneration as the most original contribution to recent literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature of recent times is the importance attached to\r\nhistorical and biographical works, which have increased so rapidly since\r\n1876 that there is now no period of American life and no important\r\ncharacter or event that lacks its historian. The number of such works is\r\nastonishing, but their general lack of style and broad human interest\r\nplaces them outside of the field of literature. The tendency of recent\r\nhistorical writing, for example, is to collect facts _about_ persons\r\nor events rather than to reproduce the persons or events so vividly that\r\nthe past lives again before our eyes. The result of such writing is to make\r\nhistory a puppet show in which dead figures are moved about by unseen\r\neconomic forces; meanwhile the only record that lives in literature is the\r\none that represents history as it really was in the making; that is, as a\r\ndrama of living, self-directing men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FISKE]\r\n\r\nThere is at least one recent historian, however, whose style gives\r\ndistinction to his work and makes it worthy of especial notice. This is\r\nJohn Fiske (1842-1901), whose field and method are both unusual. He began\r\nas a student of law and philosophy, and his first notable book, _Outlines\r\nof Cosmic Philosophy_, attracted instant attention in England and\r\nAmerica by its literary style and rare lucidity of statement. It was\r\nfollowed by a series of essays, such as _The Idea Of God_, _The\r\nDestiny Of Man_ and _The Origin of Evil_, which were so far above\r\nothers of their kind that for a time they were in danger of becoming\r\npopular. Of a thousand works occasioned by the theory of evolution, when\r\nthat theory was a nine days' wonder, they are among the very few that stand\r\nthe test of time by affording as much pleasure and surprise as when they\r\nwere first written.\r\n\r\nIt was comparatively late in life that our philosopher turned historian,\r\nand his first work in this field, _American Political Ideals Viewed from\r\nthe Standpoint of Universal History_, announced that here at last was a\r\nwriter with broad horizons, who saw America not as an isolated nation\r\nmaking a strange experiment but as adding a vital chapter to the great\r\nworld's history. It was a surprising work, unlike any other in the field of\r\nAmerican history, and it may fall to another generation to appreciate its\r\noriginality. Finally Fiske took up the study of particular periods or\r\nepochs, viewed them with the same deep insight, the same broad sympathy,\r\nand reflected them in a series of brilliant narratives: _Old Virginia and\r\nher Neighbors_, _The Beginnings of New England_, _Dutch and\r\nQuaker Colonies in America_ and a few others, the series ending\r\nchronologically with _A Critical Period of American History_, the\r\n\"critical\" period being the time of doubt and struggle over the\r\nConstitution. These narratives, though not unified, form a fairly complete\r\nhistory from the Colonial period to the formation of the Union.\r\n\r\nTo read any of these books is to discover that Fiske is concerned not\r\nchiefly with events but with the meaning or philosophy of events; that he\r\nhas a rare gift of delving below the surface, of seeing in the endeavors of\r\na handful of men at Jamestown or Plymouth or Philadelphia a profoundly\r\nsignificant chapter of universal history. Hence we seem to read in his\r\npages not the story of America but the story of Man. Moreover, he had\r\nenthusiasm; which means that his heart was young and that he could make\r\neven dull matters vital and interesting. Perhaps the best thing that can be\r\nsaid of his work is that it is a pleasure to read it,--a criticism which is\r\nspoken for mature or thoughtful readers rather than for those who read\r\nhistory for its dramatic or heroic interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LITERARY HISTORY]\r\n\r\nAnother feature of our recent prose is the number of books devoted to the\r\nstudy of American letters; and that, like the study of nature, is a\r\nphenomenon which is without precedent. Notwithstanding Emerson's plea for\r\nindependence in _The American Scholar_ (1837), our critics were busy\r\nlong after that date with the books of other lands, thinking that there was\r\nno American literature worthy of their attention. In the same year that\r\nEmerson made his famous address Royal Robbins made what was probably the\r\nfirst attempt at a history of American literature. [Footnote: _Chambers'\r\nHistory of the English Language and Literature, to which is added A History\r\nof American Contributions to the English Language and Literature, by Royal\r\nRobbins (Hartford, 1837)_. It is interesting to note that the author\r\ncomplained of the difficulty of his task in view of the fact that there\r\nwere at that time over two thousand living American authors.] It consisted\r\nof a few tag-ends attached to a dry catalogue of English writers, and the\r\nscholarly author declared that, as there was only one poor literary history\r\nthen in existence (namely, Chambers'), he must depend largely on his own\r\nmemory for correcting the English part of the book and creating a new\r\nAmerican part. Nor were conditions improved during the next forty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD EVERETT HALE]\r\n\r\nAfter the war, however, the viewpoint of our historians was changed. They\r\nbegan to regard American literature with increasing respect as an original\r\nproduct, as a true reflection of human life in a new field and under the\r\nstimulus of new incentives to play the fine old game of \"life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.\" In 1878 appeared Tyler's _History of American\r\nLiterature 1607-1765_ in two bulky volumes that surprised readers by\r\nrevealing a mass of important writings in a period supposed to be barren of\r\nliterary interest; and the surprise increased when the same author produced\r\ntwo more volumes dealing with the literature of the Revolution. In 1885\r\ncame Stedman's _Poets of America_, an excellent critical study of New\r\nWorld poetry; and two years later Richardson published the first of his two\r\nsplendid volumes of _American Literature_. These good beginnings were\r\nfollowed by a host of biographies dealing with every important American\r\nauthor, until we now have choice of a large assortment of literary material\r\nwhere Royal Robbins had none at all.\r\n\r\nSuch formal works are for the student, but the reader who goes to books for\r\nrecreation has also been remembered. Edward Everett Hale's _James Russell\r\nLowell and his Friends_, Higginson's _Old Cambridge_, Howells's\r\n_Literary Friends and Acquaintance_, Trowbridge's _My Own Story_,\r\nMrs. Field's _Authors and Friends_, Stoddard's _Homes and Haunts of\r\nour Elder Poets_, Curtis's _Homes of American Authors_, Mitchell's\r\n_American Lands and Letters_,--these are but few of many recent books\r\nof reminiscences, all bearing witness to the fact that American literature\r\nhas a history and tradition of its own. It is no longer an appendix to\r\nEnglish literature but an original record, to be cherished as we cherish\r\nany other precious national heritage, and to stand or fall among the\r\nliteratures of the world as it shall be found true or false to the\r\nfundamental ideals of American life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The following works, selected from a\r\n    much larger number, will be found useful for reference during the\r\n    entire course of study.\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN LITERATURE. There is unfortunately no series of scholarly\r\n    volumes covering the whole field, and nothing that approaches a\r\n    standard history of the subject. One of the best general surveys is\r\n    Richardson, American Literature, 2 vols. (Putnam, 1887). This is a\r\n    critical work, containing no biographical material, and the\r\n    historical sequence is broken by studying each type of literature\r\n    (fiction, poetry, etc.) by itself. Other general surveys,\r\n    containing a small amount of biography sadly interwoven with\r\n    critical matter, are Trent, American Literature (Appleton); Cairn,\r\n    History of American Literature (Oxford University Press); Wendell,\r\n    Literary History of America (Scribner); and the Cambridge American\r\n    Literature, 2 vols. (announced, 1916, Putnam). There are also a\r\n    score of textbooks dealing briefly with the subject.\r\n\r\n    Among histories dealing with selected authors in groups or with the\r\n    writers of some particular section of the country are National\r\n    Studies in American Letters (Macmillan), which includes Higginson's\r\n    Old Cambridge, Nicholson's The Hoosiers, Addison's The Clergy in\r\n    American Letters, etc.; Fulton, Southern Life in Southern\r\n    Literature; Moses, Literature of the South; Holliday, History of\r\n    Southern Literature; Wauchope, Writers of North Carolina; Lawton,\r\n    The New England Poets; Painter, Poets of Virginia; Venable,\r\n    Beginnings of Literary Culture in the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\n    _POETRY_. Stedman, Poets of America; Onderdonck, History of\r\n    American Verse; Collins, Poetry and Poets of America.\r\n\r\n    _FICTION_. Loshe, The Early American Novel; Erskine, Leading\r\n    American Novelists; Smith, The American Short Story; Baldwin,\r\n    American Short Stories; Perry, A Study of Prose Fiction; Howells,\r\n    Criticism in Fiction; James, The Art of Fiction; Crawford, The\r\n    Novel: What It Is.\r\n\r\n    _MISCELLANEOUS TYPES_. Jameson, History of Historical Writing\r\n    in America; Payne, Leading American Essayists; Brownell, American\r\n    Prose Masters; Haweis, American Humorists; Payne, American Literary\r\n    Criticisms; Sears, History of Oratory; Fuller and Trueblood,\r\n    British and American Eloquence; Seilhamer, History of the American\r\n    Theater; Hudson, Journalism in the United States; Thomas, History\r\n    of Printing in America.\r\n\r\n    A very useful little book is Whitcomb, Chronological Outlines of\r\n    American Literature (Macmillan), in which all important works are\r\n    arranged, first, in chronological order, year by year, and then\r\n    according to authors.\r\n\r\n    _BIOGRAPHY_. The best series of literary biographies is\r\n    American Men of Letters (Houghton). A few American authors are\r\n    included in English Men of Letters, Great Writers, the brief Beacon\r\n    Biographies and other series. Biographical collections are Adams,\r\n    Dictionary of American Authors; Cyclopedia of American Biography, 6\r\n    vols. (Appleton); Allibone, Dictionary of English Literature and\r\n    British and American Authors, 6 vols. (Lippincott); Howes, American\r\n    Bookmen; Fields, Biographical Notes and Personal Sketches.\r\n\r\n    _SELECTIONS_. Calhoun and MacAlarney, Readings from American\r\n    Literature, containing selections from all important authors in one\r\n    volume (Ginn and Company); Stedman and Hutchinson, Library of\r\n    American Literature, 11 vols. (Webster); Duyckinck, Cyclopedia of\r\n    American Literature, 2 vols. (Scribner); Bronson, American Poems\r\n    and American Prose, 2 vols. (University of Chicago Press);\r\n    Lounsbury, American Poems (Yale University Press); Stedman, An\r\n    American Anthology, supplementing the same author's Poets of\r\n    America (Houghton); Page, Chief American Poets, with very full\r\n    selections from our nine elder poets (Houghton); The Humbler Poets,\r\n    newspaper and magazine verse, 2 vols. (McClurg); Golden Treasury of\r\n    American Songs and Lyrics (Macmillan); Rittenhouse, Little Book of\r\n    Modern Verse (Houghton); Carpenter, American Prose (Macmillan);\r\n    Johnson, American Orations, 3 vols. (Putnam); Harding, Select\r\n    Orations (Macmillan).\r\n\r\n    Library of Southern Literature, 16 vols., a monumental work, edited\r\n    under supervision of the University of Virginia (Martin and Holt\r\n    Co., Atlanta); Trent, Southern Writers; Mims and Payne, Southern\r\n    Poetry; Kent, Southern Poets.\r\n\r\n    _SCHOOL TEXTS_. For the works of minor writers some of the\r\n    anthologies named above are necessary; but the major authors may be\r\n    read to better advantage in various inexpensive texts edited for\r\n    class use. Such, for example, are Standard English Classics (Ginn\r\n    and Company); Riverside Literature (Houghton); Pocket Classics\r\n    (Macmillan); Lake Classics (Scott); Maynard's English Classics\r\n    (Merrill); Silver Classics (Silver, Burdett); Johnson's English\r\n    Classics (Johnson); English Readings (Holt); Eclectic Classics\r\n    (American Book Co.); Everyman's Library (Dutton). There are nearly\r\n    a score more of these handy little editions, lists of which may be\r\n    obtained by writing to the various publishing houses, especially to\r\n    those that make a specialty of schoolbooks.\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN HISTORY. In studying our literature a good textbook of\r\n    history should always be at hand; such as Montgomery, Student's\r\n    American History, or Muzzey, American History, or Channing,\r\n    Students' History of the United States. More extended works are\r\n    much better, if the student has time or inclination to consult\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    A useful reference work in connection with our early literature is\r\n    American History Told by Contemporaries, edited by Hart, 4 vols.\r\n    (Macmillan). The American History Series, 6 vols. (Scribner), tells\r\n    the story of America by epochs, the different epochs being treated\r\n    by different authors. Another good history of the same kind is\r\n    Epochs of American History, 3 vols. (Longmans). The most complete\r\n    history is The American Nation, 27 vols. (Harper).\r\n\r\n    Political and party history in Stanwood, History of the Presidency\r\n    (Houghton), and Johnston, American Political History, 2 vols.\r\n    (Putnam).\r\n\r\n    Biographies of notable characters in American Statesmen (Houghton),\r\n    Makers of America (Dodd), Great Commanders (Appleton), True\r\n    Biographies (Lippincott), and various other series. National\r\n    Cyclopedia of American Biography, 15 vols. (White).\r\n\r\n    Bibliography of the subject in Channing, Hart and Turner, Guide to\r\n    the Study and Reading of American History, revised to 1912 (Ginn\r\n    and Company); and in Andrews, Gambrill and Tall, Bibliography of\r\n    History (Longmans).",
