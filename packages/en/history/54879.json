Did not everything finish with Napoleon? Ought I to have\r\nspoken of anything else? What person can possess any interest beside\r\nhim? Of whom and of what can there be any question after such a man?\r\nDante alone had the right to associate himself with the great poets\r\nwhom he meets in the regions of another life. How can one speak of\r\nLouis XVIII. in the stead of the Emperor? I blush when I think that, at\r\nthe present moment, I have to cant about a crowd of petty creatures, of\r\nwhom I myself am one, dubious and nocturnal beings that we were on a\r\nstage from which the great sun had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Bonapartists themselves had shrivelled up. Their members had become\r\nbent and shrunk; the soul was lacking to the new universe so soon as\r\nBonaparte withdrew his breath; objects faded from view from the moment\r\nwhen they were no longer illuminated by the light which had given them\r\ncolour and relief. At the commencement of these Memoirs, I had only\r\nmyself to speak of: well, there is always a sort of paramountcy in\r\nman's individual solitude. Later, I was surrounded by miracles: those\r\nmiracles kept up my voice; but at this present moment there is no more\r\nconquest of Egypt, no more Battles of Marengo, Austerlitz and Jena, no\r\nmore retreat from Russia, no more invasion of France, capture of Paris,\r\nreturn from Elba, Battle of Waterloo, funeral at St. Helena: what\r\nremains? Portraits to which only the genius of Molière could lend the\r\ngravity of comedy!\r\n\r\nWhile expressing myself upon our worthlessness, I taxed my conscience\r\nhome: I asked myself whether I did not purposely incorporate myself\r\nwith the nullity of these times, in order to acquire the right to\r\ncondemn the others, persuaded though I were _in petto_ that my name\r\nwould be read in the midst of all these obliterations. No, I am\r\nconvinced that we shall all fade out: first, because we have not in\r\nus the wherewithal to live; secondly, because the age in which we are\r\ncommencing or ending our days has itself not the wherewithal to make\r\nus live. Generations mutilated, exhausted, disdainful, faithless,\r\nconsecrated to the annihilation which they love, are unable to bestow\r\nimmortality; they have no power to create a renown; if you were to nail\r\nyour ear to their mouth, you would hear nothing: no sound issues from\r\nthe heart of the dead.\r\n\r\nOne thing strikes me, however: the little world to which I am now\r\ncoming was superior to the world which succeeded it in 1830; we were\r\ngiants in comparison with the society of maggots that has engendered\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration offers at least one point in which we can find\r\nimportance: after the dignity of one man, that man having passed, there\r\nwas born again the dignity of mankind. If despotism has been replaced\r\nby liberty, if we understand anything of independence, if we have lost\r\nthe habit of grovelling, if the rights of human nature are no longer\r\ndisregarded, we owe these things to the Restoration. Wherefore also I\r\nthrew myself into the fray in order, as far as I could, to revive the\r\nspecies when the individual had come to an end.\r\n\r\nCome, let us pursue our task! Let us descend, with a groan, to myself\r\nand my colleagues. You have seen me amid my dreams; you are about to\r\nsee me in my realities: if the interest decreases, if I fall, reader,\r\nbe just, make allowance for my subject!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I am made a peer of France.]\r\n\r\nAfter the second return of the King and the final disappearance of\r\nBonaparte, the Ministry being in the hands of M. le Duc d'Otrante and\r\nM. le Prince de Talleyrand, I was appointed president of the electoral\r\ncollege of the Department of the Loiret. The elections of 1815 gave\r\nthe King the _Chambre introuvable._[2] I was carrying all the votes\r\nat Orleans, when I received the Order which called me to the House\r\nof Peers[3]. My active career had hardly commenced, when it suddenly\r\nchanged its course: what would it have been if I had been sent to the\r\nElective Chamber? It is fairly probable that that career would, in\r\nthe event of my success, have ended in the Ministry of the Interior,\r\ninstead of taking me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My habits and\r\nmanners were more in touch with the peerage, and, although the latter\r\nbecame hostile to me from the first moment, by reason of my Liberal\r\nopinions, it is nevertheless certain that my doctrines concerning the\r\nliberty of the press and against the vassalage to foreigners gave the\r\nNoble Chamber the popularity which it enjoyed so long as it suffered my\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nI received, at my entrance, the only honour which my colleagues ever\r\ndid me during my fifteen years' residence in their midst: I was\r\nappointed one of the four secretaries for the session of 1816. Lord\r\nByron met with no more favour when he appeared in the House of Lords,\r\nand he left it for good: I ought to have returned to my deserts.\r\n\r\nMy first appearance in the tribune was to make a speech on the\r\nirremovability of the judges[4]: I applauded the principle, but\r\ncensured its immediate application. At the Revolution of 1830, the\r\nmembers of the Left who were most devoted to that revolution wished to\r\nsuspend the irremovability for a time.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February 1816, the Duc de Richelieu brought us the\r\nautograph will of the Queen. I ascended the tribune, and said:\r\n\r\n\"He who has preserved for us the will of Marie-Antoinette[5] had bought\r\nthe property of Montboisier: himself one of Louis XVI.'s judges, he\r\nraised in that property a monument to the memory of the defender of\r\nLouis XVI., and himself engraved on that monument an epitaph in French\r\nverse in praise of M. de Malesherbes. This astonishing impartiality\r\nshows that all is misplaced in the moral world.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March 1816, the question of the ecclesiastical\r\npensions[6] was discussed:\r\n\r\n\"You would,\" I said, \"refuse an allowance to the poor vicar who\r\ndevotes the remainder of his days to the altar, and you would accord\r\npensions to Joseph Lebon[7], who struck off so many heads; to François\r\nChabot[8], who asked for a law against the Emigrants of so simple a\r\ncharacter that a child might lead them to the guillotine; to Jacques\r\nRoux[9], who, refusing at the Temple to receive Louis XVI.'s will,\r\nreplied to the unfortunate monarch:\r\n\r\n\"'My only business is to take you to your death.'\"\r\n\r\nA bill had been introduced into the Hereditary Chamber relating to the\r\nelections. I declared myself in favour of the integral renewal of the\r\nChamber of Deputies. It was not until 1824, being then a minister, that\r\nI passed it into law.\r\n\r\nIt was also in this first speech on the law governing elections, in\r\n1816[10], that I said, in reply to an opponent:\r\n\r\n\"I will not refer to what has been said about Europe watching our\r\ndiscussions. Speaking for myself, gentlemen, I doubtless owe to the\r\nFrench blood that flows in my veins the impatience which I experience\r\nwhen, in order to influence my vote, people talk to me of opinions\r\nexisting outside my country; and, if civilized Europe tried to impose\r\nthe Charter on me, I should go to live in Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chamber of Peers.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April 1816, I introduced a motion to the Chamber relating\r\nto the Barbary Powers. The house decided that there was cause for its\r\ndiscussion. I was already thinking of combating slavery, before I\r\nobtained that favourable decision from the Peers, which was the first\r\npolitical intervention of a great Power on behalf of the Greeks:\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the ruins of Carthage,\" I said to my colleagues; \"I have\r\nmet among those ruins the successors of the unhappy Christians for\r\nwhose deliverance St. Louis sacrificed his life. Philosophy can take\r\nits share of the glory attached to the success of my motion and boast\r\nof having obtained in an age of light that for which religion strove in\r\nvain in an age of darkness.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself in an assembly in which my words, for three-fourths of\r\nthe time, turned against myself. One can move a popular chamber; an\r\naristocratic chamber is deaf. With no gallery, speaking in private\r\nbefore old men, dried-up remains of the old Monarchy, of the Revolution\r\nand of the Empire, anything that rose above the most commonplace seemed\r\nmadness. One day, the front row of arm-chairs, quite close to the\r\ntribune, was filled with venerable peers, one more deaf than the other,\r\ntheir heads bent forward, and holding to their ears a trumpet with the\r\nmouth turned towards the tribune. I sent them to sleep, which is very\r\nnatural. One of them dropped his ear-trumpet; his neighbour, awakened\r\nby the fall, wanted politely to pick up his colleague's trumpet; he\r\nfell down. The worst of it was that I began to laugh, although I was\r\njust then speaking pathetically on some subject of humanity, I forget\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nThe speakers who succeeded in that Chamber were those who spoke\r\nwithout ideas, in a level and monotonous tone, or who found terms of\r\nsensibility only in order to melt with pity for the poor ministers. M.\r\nde Lally-Tolendal thundered in favour of the public liberties: he made\r\nthe vaults of our solitude resound with the praises of three or four\r\nEnglish Lord Chancellors, his ancestors, he said. When his panegyric\r\nof the liberty of the press was finished, came a \"but\" based upon\r\n\"circumstances,\" which \"but\" left our honour safe, under the useful\r\nsupervision of the censorship.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration gave an impulse to men's minds; it set free the thought\r\nsuppressed by Bonaparte: the intellect, like a caryatic figure relieved\r\nof the entablature that bent its brow, lifted up its head. The Empire\r\nhad struck France with dumbness; liberty restored touched her and gave\r\nher back speech: oratorical talents existed which took up matters where\r\nthe Mirabeaus and Cazalès had left them, and the Revolution continued\r\nits course.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy labours were not limited to the tribune, so new to me. Appalled at\r\nthe systems which men were embracing and at France's ignorance of the\r\nprinciples of representative government, I wrote and had printed the\r\n_Monarchie selon la Charte._ This publication marked one of the great\r\nepochs of my political life: it made me take rank among the publicists;\r\nit served to determine opinion on the nature of our government. The\r\nEnglish papers praised the work to the skies; among us, the Abbé\r\nMorellet even could not recover from the transformation of my style and\r\nthe dogmatic precision of the truths.\r\n\r\nThe _Monarchie selon la Charte_ is a constitutional catechism: from\r\nit have been taken the greater part of the propositions which are put\r\nforward as new to-day. Thus the principle that \"the King reigns but\r\ndoes not govern\" is found fully set forth in Chapters IV., V., VI. and\r\nVII. on the Royal Prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional principles having been laid down in the first part\r\nof the _Monarchie selon la Charte_, I examine in the second the systems\r\nof the three ministries which till then had followed upon one another,\r\nfrom 1814 to 1816; in this part are brought together predictions\r\ntoo well verified since and expositions of doctrines at that time\r\nunperceived. These words appear in Chapter XXVI., in the Second Part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"It passes as unquestionable, in a certain party, that a\r\n    revolution of the nature of our own can end only by a change\r\n    of dynasty; others, more moderate, say by a change in the\r\n    order of right of succession to the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I was finishing my work, appeared the ordinance of the 5th of\r\nSeptember 1816[11]: this measure dispersed the few Royalists assembled\r\nto reconstruct the Legitimate Monarchy. I hastened to write the\r\n_Postscript_, which caused an explosion of anger on the part of M. le\r\nDuc de Richelieu and of Louis XVIII.'s favourite, M. Decazes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure of my pamphlet.]\r\n\r\nThe _Postscript_ added, I ran to M. Le Normant, my publisher's. On\r\narriving, I found constables and a police-commissary making out\r\ninstruments. They had seized parcels and affixed seals. I had not\r\ndefied Bonaparte to be intimidated by M. Decazes: I objected to the\r\nseizure; I declared that, as a free Frenchman and a peer of France, I\r\nwould yield only to force. The force arrived and I withdrew. I went\r\non the 18th of September to Messieurs Louis-Marthe Mesnier and his\r\ncolleague, notaries-royal; I protested in their office and called upon\r\nthem to register my statement of the fact of the apprehension of my\r\nwork, wishing to ensure the rights of French citizens by means of this\r\nprotest M. Baudé[12] followed my example in 1830.\r\n\r\nI next found myself engaged in a rather long correspondence with M.\r\nthe Chancellor, M. the Minister of Police and M. the Attorney-General\r\nBellart[13], until the 9th of November, on which day the Chancellor\r\ninformed me of the order made in my favour by the Court of First\r\nInstance, which placed me in possession of my seized work. In one of\r\nhis letters, M. the Chancellor told me that he had been distressed to\r\nsee the dissatisfaction which the King had publicly expressed with my\r\nwork. This dissatisfaction arose from the chapter in which I stood\r\nup against the establishment of a minister of General Police in a\r\nconstitutional country.\r\n\r\nIn my account of the journey to Ghent, you have seen Louis XVIII.'s\r\nvalue as a descendant of Hugh Capet; in my pamphlet, _Le Roi est mort:\r\nvive le roi!_[14] I have told the Prince's real qualities. But man is\r\nnot a simple unit: why are there so few faithful portraits? Because the\r\nmodel is made to pose at such or such a period of his life; ten years\r\nlater the portrait is no longer like.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. did not see far the objects before or around him; all\r\nseemed fair or foul to him according to the way he looked at it.\r\nSmitten with his century, it is to be feared that \"the most Christian\r\nKing\" regarded religion only as an elixir fit for the amalgam of drugs\r\nof which royalty is composed. The licentious imagination which he had\r\nreceived from his grandfather[15] might have inspired some distrust of\r\nhis enterprises; but he knew himself and, when he spoke in a positive\r\nmanner, he boasted (well knowing it), while laughing at himself. I\r\nspoke to him one day of the need of a new marriage for M. le Duc de\r\nBourbon, in order to bring back the race of the Condés to life. He\r\nstrongly approved of that idea, although he cared very little about the\r\nsad resurrection; but in this connection he spoke to me of the Comte\r\nd'Artois, and said:\r\n\r\n\"My brother might marry again without changing anything in the\r\nsuccession to the throne: he would only make cadets. As for me,\r\nI should only make elders; I do not want to disinherit M. le Duc\r\nd'Angoulême.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drew himself up with a capable and bantering air; but I had no\r\nintention of denying the King any power.\r\n\r\nSelfish and unprejudiced, Louis XVIII. desired his peace of mind at any\r\nprice: he supported his ministers so long as they held the majority; he\r\ndismissed them so soon as the majority was shaken and his tranquillity\r\nliable to be upset: he did not hesitate to fall back when, to obtain\r\nthe victory, he ought to have taken a step forward. His greatness was\r\npatience: he did not go towards events; events came to him.\r\n\r\nWithout being cruel, the King was not humane; tragic catastrophes\r\nneither astonished nor touched him; he was satisfied with saying to the\r\nDuc de Berry, who apologized for having had the misfortune to disturb\r\nthe King's sleep by his death:\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my night.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this quiet man would fly into horrible rages when\r\nannoyed; and also, this cold, unfeeling Prince had attachments which\r\nresembled passions: thus there succeeded each other in his intimacy the\r\nComte d'Avaray, M. de Blacas, M. Decazes[16]; Madame de Balbi[17],\r\nMadame de Cayla[18]. All these beloved persons were favourites;\r\nunfortunately they have a great deal too many letters in their hands.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. appeared to us in all the profundity of historic\r\ntradition; he showed himself with the favouritism of the ancient\r\nroyalties. Does the heart of our isolated monarchs contain a void which\r\nthey fill with the first object they light upon? Is it sympathy, the\r\naffinity of a nature analogous to their own? Is it a friendship which\r\ndrops down to them from Heaven to console their greatnesses? Is it a\r\nleaning for a slave who gives himself body and soul, before whom one\r\nconceals nothing, a slave who becomes a garment, a plaything, a fixed\r\nidea bound up with all the feelings, all the tastes, all the whims\r\nof him whom it has subdued and whom it holds under the empire of an\r\ninvincible fascination? The viler and closer a favourite has been,\r\nthe less easily is he to be dismissed, because he is in possession of\r\nsecrets which would put one to the blush if they were divulged: the\r\nchosen one derives a dual force from his own baseness and his master's\r\nweaknesses.\r\n\r\nWhen the favourite happens to be a great man, like the besetting\r\nRichelieu[19] or the undismissable Mazarin[20], the nations, while\r\ndetesting him, profit by his glory or his power; they only change a\r\nwretched king _de jure_ for an illustrious king _de facto._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc Decazes.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as M. Decazes was made a minister, the carriages blocked\r\nthe Quai Malaquais in the evenings to set down in the new-comer's\r\ndrawing-room all that was noblest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The\r\nFrenchman may do what he pleases, he will never be anything but a\r\ncourtier, no matter of whom, provided it be a power of the day.\r\n\r\nSoon there was formed, on behalf of the new favourite, a formidable\r\ncoalition of stupidities. In democratic society, prate about liberties,\r\ndeclare that you see the progress of the human race and the future of\r\nthings, adding to your speeches a few Crosses of the Legion of Honour,\r\nand you are sure of your place; in aristocratic society, play whist,\r\nutter commonplaces and carefully-prepared witticisms with a grave and\r\nprofound air, and the fortune of your genius is assured.\r\n\r\nBorn a fellow-countryman of Murat[21], but of Murat without a kingdom,\r\nM. Decazes had come to us from the mother of Napoleon[22]. He was\r\nfamiliar, obliging, never insolent; he wished me well; I do not know\r\nwhy, I did not care: thence came the commencement of my disgraces. That\r\nwas to teach me that one must never fail in respect to a favourite. The\r\nKing loaded him with kindnesses and credit, and subsequently married\r\nhim to a very well-born person, daughter to M. de Sainte-Aulaire[23].\r\nIt is true that M. Decazes served royalty too well; it was he who\r\nunearthed Marshal Ney in the mountains of Auvergne, where he had hidden\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFaithful to the inspirations of his throne, Louis XVIII. said of M.\r\nDecazes:\r\n\r\n\"I shall raise him up so high that the greatest lords will be envious\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\nThis phrase, borrowed from another king, was a mere anachronism: to\r\nraise up others, one must be sure of not descending; now, at the time\r\nwhen Louis XVIII. arrived, what were monarchs? If they could still make\r\na man's fortune, they could no longer make his greatness; they had\r\nbecome merely their favourites' bankers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duc Decazes.]\r\n\r\nMadame Princeteau[24], M. Decazes' sister, was an agreeable, modest and\r\nexcellent person; the King had fallen in love with her prospectively.\r\nM. Decazes, the father, whom I saw in the throne-room in full dress,\r\nsword at side, hat under his arm, made no success, however.\r\n\r\nAt last, the death of M. le Duc de Berry increased the ill-will on both\r\nsides and brought about the favourite's fall. I have said that \"his\r\nfeet slipped in the blood[25],\" which does not mean, Heaven forbid!\r\nthat he was guilty of the murder, but that he fell in the reddened pool\r\nthat formed under Louvel's knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had resisted the seizure of the _Monarchie selon la Charte_ to\r\nenlighten misled royalty and to uphold the liberty of thought and of\r\nthe press; I had frankly embraced our institutions, and I remained\r\nloyal to them.\r\n\r\nThese broils over, I remained bleeding from the wounds inflicted on\r\nme at the appearance of my pamphlet. I did not take possession of\r\nmy political career without bearing the scars of the blows which I\r\nreceived on entering upon that career: I felt ill at ease in it, I was\r\nunable to breathe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I am deprived of my place.]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, an Order[26] countersigned \"Richelieu\" struck me\r\noff the list of ministers of State, and I was deprived of a place\r\ntill then reputed irremovable; it had been given me at Ghent, and the\r\npension attached to that place was withdrawn from me: the hand which\r\nhad taken Fouché struck me.\r\n\r\nI have had the honour to be thrice stripped for the Legitimacy: first,\r\nfor following the sons of St. Louis into exile; the second time, for\r\nwriting in favour of the principles of the Monarchy, as \"granted;\" the\r\nthird, for keeping silence on a baleful law at the moment when I had\r\njust caused the triumph of our arms. The Spanish Campaign had given\r\nback soldiers to the White Flag, and, if I had been kept in power, I\r\nshould have carried back our frontiers to the banks of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nMy nature made me quite indifferent to the loss of my salary; I came\r\noff with going on foot again and, on rainy days, driving to the Chamber\r\nof Peers in a hackney-coach. In my popular conveyance, under the\r\nprotection of the rabble that surged around me, I re-entered into the\r\nrights of the proletariat of which I formed part: from my lofty chariot\r\nI looked down upon the train of kings.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to sell my books; M. Merlin put them up to auction at\r\nthe Salle Sylvestre in the Rue des Bons-Enfants[27]. I kept only\r\na little Greek Homer, whose margins were covered with attempts at\r\ntranslation and remarks in my handwriting. Soon it became necessary to\r\ntake energetic measures; I asked M. the Minister of the Interior for\r\nleave to raffle my country-house. The lottery was opened at the office\r\nof M. Denis, notary. There were ninety tickets at 1000 francs each:\r\nthe numbers were not taken up by the Royalists; the Dowager Madame la\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans[28] took three numbers; my friend, M. Lainé, the\r\nMinister of the Interior, who had countersigned the Order of the 5th of\r\nSeptember and consented in the Council to the striking off of my name,\r\ntook a fourth ticket under a false name. The money was returned to the\r\nsubscribers; M. Lainé, however, refused to withdraw his 1000 francs; he\r\nleft it with the notary for the poor.\r\n\r\nNot long after, my Vallée-aux-Loups was sold, as they sell the\r\nfurniture of the poor, on the Place du Châtelet. I suffered much by\r\nthis sale; I had become attached to my trees, planted and, so to speak,\r\nfull-grown in my memories. The reserve was 50,000 francs; it was\r\ncovered by M. le Vicomte de Montmorency[29], who alone dared to bid one\r\nhundred francs higher: the Vallée was knocked down to him[30]. He has\r\nsince inhabited my retreat. It is not a good thing to meddle with my\r\nfortunes: that man of virtue is no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the _Monarchie selon la Charte_ and at the\r\nopening of the new session in the month of November 1816, I continued\r\nmy contests. In the House of Peers, in the sitting of the 23rd of that\r\nmonth, I moved a proposition to the effect that the King be humbly\r\nbegged to order an investigation into the proceedings at the last\r\nelections. The corruption and violence of the Ministry during those\r\nelections were flagrant.\r\n\r\nIn giving my opinion on the Bill relating to Supply (21 March 1817),\r\nI spoke against Clause II. of that Bill: it had to do with the State\r\nforests which they proposed to appropriate for the Sinking Fund, in\r\norder afterwards to sell one hundred and fifty thousand hectares. These\r\nforests consisted of three kinds of properties: the ancient domains of\r\nthe Crown, a few commanderies of the Order of Malta, and the remainder\r\nof the goods of the Church. I do not know why, even to-day, I find a\r\nsad interest in my words; they bear some resemblance to my Memoirs:\r\n\r\n\"With all due deference to those who have administered only during our\r\ntroubles, it is not the material security but the ethics of a people\r\nthat constitute the public credit. Will the new owners make good the\r\ntitles of their new property? To deprive them there will be quoted\r\nto them instances of inheritances of nine centuries taken away from\r\ntheir former possessors. Instead of those inalienable patrimonies in\r\nwhich the same family outlived the race of the oaks, you will have\r\nunfixed properties in which the reeds will scarcely have time to\r\nspring up and die before they change masters. The homes will cease to\r\nbe the guardians of domestic morality; they will lose their venerable\r\nauthority; rights-of-way open to all comers, they will no longer be\r\nhallowed by the grandfather's chair and the cradle of the new-born\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"Peers of France, it is your cause that I am pleading here, not mine: I\r\nam speaking to you in the interests of your children; I shall have no\r\nconcern with posterity; I have no sons; I have lost my father's fields,\r\nand a few trees which I have planted will soon cease to be mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comte de Villèle.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the resemblance of opinions, then very keen, an intimacy had\r\nbeen established between the minorities of the two Chambers. France\r\nwas learning representative government. As I had been foolish enough\r\nto take it literally and make a real passion of it, to my prejudice, I\r\nsupported those who took it up, without troubling my head as to whether\r\ntheir opposition was not prompted by human motives rather than by a\r\npure love like that which I felt for the Charter: not that I was a\r\nsimpleton, but I idolized my lady-love and would have gone through fire\r\nto carry her off in my arms. It was during this constitutional attack\r\nthat I came to know M. de Villèle[31], in 1816. He was calmer; he\r\novercame his ardour; he, too, aimed at conquering liberty, but he laid\r\nsiege to it according to rule. He opened the trenches methodically: I,\r\nwho wanted to carry the place by assault, advanced to the escalade, and\r\noften found myself flung back into the ditch.\r\n\r\nI met M. de Villèle first at the Duchesse de Lévis'. He became the\r\nleader of the Royalist Opposition in the Elective Chamber, as I was\r\nin the Hereditary Chamber. He had as a friend his colleague M. de\r\nCorbière[32]. The latter never left his side, and people used to speak\r\nof \"Villèle and Corbière\" as they speak of \"Orestes and Pylades\" or\r\n\"Euryalus and Nisus.\"\r\n\r\nTo enter into fastidious details about persons whose names one will\r\nnot know to-morrow would be an idiotic vanity. Obscure and tedious\r\ncommotions, which one considers of immense interest and which interest\r\nnobody, bygone intrigues, which have decided no important event, should\r\nbe left to those devoutly happy persons who imagine themselves to be,\r\nor to have been, the object of the world's attention.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were proud moments in which my contentions with\r\nM. de Villèle seemed to me personally like the dissensions of Sulla\r\nand Marius, of Cæsar and Pompey. Together with the other members\r\nof the Opposition, we went pretty often to spend the evening in\r\ndeliberation at M. Piet's[33], in the Rue Thérèse. We arrived looking\r\nextremely ugly, and sat down round a room lighted by a flaring lamp.\r\nIn this legislative fog, we talked of the Bill introduced, of the\r\nmotion to be made, of the friend to be pushed into the secretaryship,\r\nthe questorship, the different committees. We were not unlike the\r\nassemblies of the early Christians, as depicted by the enemies of the\r\nFaith: we broached the worst news; we said that things were going to\r\nturn, that Rome would be troubled by divisions, that our armies would\r\nbe routed.\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle listened, summed up, and drew no conclusions; he was a\r\ngreat aid in business: a prudent mariner, he never put to sea in a\r\nstorm and, though he would cleverly enter a known harbour, he would\r\nnever have discovered the New World. I often observed, in the matter\r\nof our discussions concerning the sale of the goods of the clergy,\r\nthat the best Christians among us were the most eager in defense of\r\nthe constitutional doctrines. Religion is the well-spring of liberty:\r\nin Rome, the _flamen dialis_ wore only a hollow ring on his finger,\r\nbecause a solid ring had something of a chain; in his clothing and on\r\nhis head-dress the pontiff of Jupiter was forbidden to suffer a single\r\nknot.\r\n\r\nAfter the sitting, M. de Villèle would go away, accompanied by M.\r\nde Corbière. I studied many personalities, I learnt many things, I\r\noccupied myself with many interests at those meetings: finance, which\r\nI always understood, the army, justice, administration initiated me\r\ninto their several elements. I left those conferences somewhat more\r\nof a statesman and somewhat more persuaded of the poverty of all that\r\nknowledge. Throughout the night, between sleeping and waking, I saw the\r\ndifferent attitudes of the bald heads, the different expressions of the\r\nfaces of those untidy and ungainly Solons. It was all very venerable,\r\ntruly; but I preferred the swallow which woke me in my youth and the\r\nMuses who filled my dreams: the rays of the dawn which, striking\r\na swan, made the shadows of those white birds fall upon a golden\r\nbillow; the rising sun which appeared to me in Syria in the stem of a\r\npalm-tree, like the phoenix' nest, pleased me more.\r\n\r\nI felt that my fighting in the tribune, in a closed Chamber, and in the\r\nmidst of an assembly which was unfavourable to me, remained useless\r\nto victory, and that I required another weapon. The censorship being\r\nestablished over the periodical daily newspapers, I could fulfil my\r\nobject only by means of a free, semi-daily paper, with the aid of which\r\nI would at once attack the system of the Ministers and the opinions\r\nof the Extreme Left printed in the _Minerve_ by M. Étienne[34]. I was\r\nstaying at Noisiel with Madame la Duchesse de Lévis, in the summer of\r\n1818, when my publisher, M. Le Normant, came to see me. I told him\r\nof the idea which I had in mind; he caught fire, offered to run all\r\nrisks and undertook all expenses. I spoke to my friends, Messieurs de\r\nBonald[35] and de La Mennais[36], and asked them if they would take\r\npart: they agreed, and the paper was not long in appearing under the\r\ntitle of the _Conservateur._[37]\r\n\r\nThe revolution worked by this paper was unexampled: in France, it\r\nchanged the majority in the Chambers; abroad, it converted the spirit\r\nof the Cabinets.\r\n\r\nIn this way the Royalists owed to me the advantage of issuing from\r\nthe state of nullity into which they had fallen with peoples and\r\nkings. I put the pen into the hands of France's greatest families.\r\nI decked out the Montmorencys and the Lévises as journalists; I\r\ncalled out the arriere-ban; I made feudality march to the aid of the\r\nliberty of the press. I had got together the most brilliant men of the\r\nRoyalist party, Messieurs de Villèle, de Corbière, de Vitrolles[38],\r\nde Castelbajac[39], etc. I could not help blessing Providence every\r\ntime that I spread the red robe of a prince of the Church over the\r\n_Conservateur_ by way of a cover, and that I had the pleasure to read\r\nan article signed in full: \"The Cardinal de La Luzerne[40].\" But it\r\ncame to pass that, after I had led my knights on the constitutional\r\ncrusade, so soon as they had conquered power by the deliverance of\r\nliberty, so soon as they had become Princes of Edessa, of Antioch, of\r\nDamascus, they locked themselves up in their new States with Eleanor of\r\nAquitaine[41], and left me out in the cold at the foot of Jerusalem,\r\nwhere the infidels had recaptured the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Conservator._]\r\n\r\nMy polemical warfare began in the _Conservateur_ and lasted from 1818\r\nto 1820, that is to say, until the re-establishment of the censorship,\r\nfor which the death of the Duc de Berry was the pretext. During this\r\nfirst period of my polemics, I upset the old Ministry and placed M. de\r\nVillèle in power.\r\n\r\nAfter 1824, when I again took up my pen in pamphlets and in the\r\n_Journal des Débats_, the positions were changed. And yet, what did\r\nthose futile trifles matter to me, who had never believed in the time\r\nin which I lived, to me, who belonged to the past, to me, who had no\r\nfaith in kings, no conviction with regard to the peoples, to me, who\r\nhave never troubled about anything, except dreams, and then only on\r\ncondition that they lasted but a night!\r\n\r\nThe first article in the _Conservateur_[42] describes the position of\r\nthings at the moment when I entered the lists. During the two years\r\nfor which the paper lasted, I had successively to treat of accidents\r\nof the day and to examine interests of importance. I had occasion to\r\ncriticize the dastardliness of that \"private correspondence\" which the\r\nParis police was publishing in London. This \"private correspondence\"\r\nmight calumniate, but could not dishonour: that which is base has not\r\nthe power of debasing; honour alone is able to inflict dishonour.\r\n\r\n\"Anonymous calumniators,\" I said, \"have the courage to say who you are;\r\na little shame is soon over; add your names to your articles: it will\r\nbe only one contemptible word the more.\"\r\n\r\nI used sometimes to laugh at the ministers, and I gave vent to that\r\nironical propensity which I have always reproved in myself.\r\n\r\nFinally, under date 5 December 1818, the _Conservateur_ contained a\r\nserious article on the morality of interests and on that of duty: it\r\nwas this article, which made a stir, that gave birth to the phrase of\r\n\"moral interests\" and \"material interests,\" first put forward by me,\r\nand subsequently adopted by everybody. Here it is, much abridged; it\r\nrises above the compass of a newspaper, and it is one of my works to\r\nwhich my reason attaches some value. It has not aged, because the ideas\r\nwhich it contains are of all time:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The ministry has invented a new morality, the morality of\r\n    interests; that of duties is abandoned to fools. Now this\r\n    morality of interests, of which it is proposed to make the\r\n    ground-work of our government, has done more to corrupt the\r\n    people in a space of three years than the Revolution in a\r\n    quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n    \"That which destroys morality in the nations and, with\r\n    that morality, the nations themselves is not violence, but\r\n    seduction; and by seduction I mean all that is flattering and\r\n    specious in any false doctrine. Men often mistake error for\r\n    truth, because each faculty of the heart or the mind has its\r\n    false image: coldness resembles virtue, reasoning resembles\r\n    reason, emptiness resembles depth, and so on.\r\n\r\n    \"The eighteenth century was a destructive century; we\r\n    were all seduced. We distorted politics, we strayed into\r\n    guilty innovations while seeking a social existence in the\r\n    corruption of our morals. The Revolution came to rouse us: in\r\n    pushing the Frenchman out of his bed, it flung him into the\r\n    tomb. Nevertheless, the Reign of Terror is, perhaps, of all\r\n    the epochs of the Revolution, that which was least dangerous\r\n    to morality, because no conscience was forced: crime appeared\r\n    in all its frankness. Orgies in the midst of blood, scandals\r\n    that ceased to be so by dint of being horrible: that is all.\r\n    The women of the people came and worked at their knitting\r\n    round the murder-machine as round their fire-sides: the\r\n    scaffolds were the public morals and death the foundation\r\n    of the government. Nothing was clearer than the position\r\n    of every one: there was no talk of 'speciality,' nor of\r\n    'practicality,' nor of a 'system of interests.' That\r\n    balderdash of little minds and bad consciences was unknown.\r\n    They said to a man, 'You are a Royalist, a nobleman, rich:\r\n    die;' and he died. Antonelle[43] wrote that no count had\r\n    been found against certain prisoners, but that he had\r\n    condemned them as aristocrats: a monstrous frankness, which,\r\n    notwithstanding, allowed moral order to subsist; for society\r\n    is not ruined by killing the innocent as innocent, but by\r\n    killing him as guilty.\r\n\r\n    \"Consequently, those hideous times are times of great acts of\r\n    self-devotion. Then women went heroically to the scaffold;\r\n    fathers gave themselves up for their sons, sons for their\r\n    fathers; unexpected assistance was introduced into the\r\n    prisons, and the priest who was being hunted consoled the\r\n    victim by the side of the executioner who failed to recognise\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: On moral interests.]\r\n\r\n    \"Morality, under the Directory, had to combat the corruption\r\n    of morals rather than of doctrines; license prevailed. Men\r\n    were hurled into pleasures as they had been heaped up in\r\n    the prisons; they forced the present to advance joys on the\r\n    future, in the fear of seeing a revival of the past. Every\r\n    man, not having yet had time to create himself a home, lived\r\n    in the street, on the public walks, in the public rooms.\r\n    Familiarized with the scaffolds, and already half cut off\r\n    from the world, they did not think it worth the trouble to go\r\n    indoors. There was question only of arts, balls, fashions;\r\n    people changed their ornaments and clothes as readily as they\r\n    would have stripped themselves of their lives.\r\n\r\n    \"Under Bonaparte the seduction commenced again, but it was a\r\n    seduction that carried its own remedy: Bonaparte seduced by\r\n    means of the spell of glory, and all that is great carries a\r\n    principle of legislation within itself. He conceived that it\r\n    was useful to allow the doctrine of all peoples to be taught,\r\n    the morality of all times, the religion of eternity.\r\n\r\n    \"I should not be surprised to hear some one reply:\r\n\r\n    \"'To base society upon a _duty_, is to build it on a fiction;\r\n    to place it in an _interest_, is to establish it in a\r\n    reality.'\r\n\r\n    \"Now it is precisely _duty_ which is a fact and _interest_\r\n    a fiction. _Duty_, which takes its source in the Godhead,\r\n    descends first into the family, where it establishes a real\r\n    affinity between the father and the children; from there,\r\n    passing into society and dividing into two branches, in the\r\n    political order it rules the relations of the king and the\r\n    subject; in the moral order it establishes the tie of service\r\n    and protection, of benefits and gratitude.\r\n\r\n    \"Duty is therefore a most positive fact, since it gives to\r\n    human society the only lasting existence that the latter can\r\n    have.\r\n\r\n    \"Interest, on the contrary, is a fiction when it is taken as\r\n    people take it to-day, in its physical and rigorous sense,\r\n    since it is no longer in the evening what it was in the\r\n    morning; since it changes its nature at each moment; since,\r\n    founded on fortune, it has fortune's fickleness.\r\n\r\n    \"By the morality of interest, every citizen is at enmity\r\n    with the laws and the government, because in society it is\r\n    always the great number that suffers. People do not fight for\r\n    abstract ideas of order, of place, of the mother-land; or,\r\n    if they fight for them, it is because they attach ideas of\r\n    _sacrifice_ to them; then they emerge from the morality of\r\n    interest to enter into that of duty: so true is it that the\r\n    existence of society is not to be found outside that sacred\r\n    limit.\r\n\r\n    \"He who does his duty gains esteem; he who yields to his\r\n    interest is but little esteemed: it was very like the century\r\n    to draw a principle of government from a source of contempt!\r\n    Bring up politicians to think only of what affects them, and\r\n    you shall see how they will dress out the State; by that\r\n    means you will have only corrupt and hungry ministers, like\r\n    those mutilated slaves who governed the Lower Empire and who\r\n    sold all, remembering that they themselves had been sold.\r\n\r\n    \"Mark this: interests are powerful only so long as they\r\n    prosper; when times are harsh, they become enfeebled. Duties,\r\n    on the contrary, are never so energetic as when they are\r\n    painful to fulfil. When times are good, they grow lax. I like\r\n    a principle of government which grows great in misfortune:\r\n    that greatly resembles virtue.\r\n\r\n    \"What can be absurder than to cry to the people:\r\n\r\n    \"'Do not be devoted! Have no enthusiasm! Think only of your\r\n    interests!'\r\n\r\n    \"It is as though one were to say to them:\r\n\r\n    \"'Do not come to our assistance, abandon us if such be your\r\n    interest.'\r\n\r\n    \"With this profound policy, when the hour of devotion shall\r\n    have come, each one will shut his door, go to the window, and\r\n    watch the Monarchy pass[44].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was this article on the morality of interest and the morality of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of December 1819, I again mounted the tribune of the Chamber\r\nof Peers: I raised my voice against the bad Frenchmen who were able to\r\ngive us as a motive for tranquillity the watchfulness of the European\r\narmies:\r\n\r\n\"Had we need of guardians? Were they still going to talk of\r\ncircumstances? Were we again, by means of diplomatic notes, to receive\r\ncertificates of good conduct? And should we not only have changed a\r\ngarrison of Cossacks for a garrison of ambassadors?\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, I spoke of the foreigners as I have since\r\nspoken of them in the Spanish War; I was thinking of our delivery at a\r\nmoment when even the Liberals contended with me. Men opposed in opinion\r\nmake a deal of noise to attain silence! Let a few years arrive, and the\r\nactors will descend from the stage and the audience no longer be there\r\nto hiss or applaud them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of the Duc de Berry.]\r\n\r\nI had gone to bed, on the evening of the 13th of February, when the\r\nMarquis de Vibraye[45] came in to me to tell me of the assassination\r\nof the Duc du Berry. In his haste, he did not tell me the place where\r\nthe event had occurred. I dressed hurriedly and stepped into M. de\r\nVibraye's carriage. I was surprised to see the coachman take the Rue\r\nde Richelieu, and still more astonished when he stopped at the Opera:\r\nthe crowd about the approaches was immense. We went up, between two\r\nlines of soldiers, through the side-door on the left, and, as we were\r\nin our peers' coats, we were allowed to pass. We came to a sort of\r\nlittle ante-room: the space was obstructed with all the people of\r\nthe palace. I pushed my way as far as the door of a box and found\r\nmyself face to face with M. le Duc d'Orléans. I was struck with an\r\nill-disguised expression of jubilation in his eyes, across the contrite\r\ncountenance which he assumed: he saw the throne nearer at hand. My\r\nglance embarrassed him: he left the spot and turned his back to me.\r\nAround me, they were telling the details of the crime, the man's name,\r\nthe conjectures of the different participants in the arrest; they were\r\nexcited, busy: men love anything theatrical, especially death, when\r\nit is the death of one of the great. Each person who came out of the\r\nblood-stained laboratory was asked for news. They heard General A. de\r\nGirardin[46] relate how, having been left for dead on the battle-field,\r\nhe had nevertheless recovered from his wounds; this one was hoping\r\nand consoling himself, that other was repining. Soon contemplation\r\novercame the crowd, a silence fell; from the inside of the box came a\r\ndull sound: I held my ear laid to the door; I distinguished a rattle;\r\nthe sound ceased: the Royal Family had received the last breath of a\r\ngrandson of Louis XIV.! I entered at once.\r\n\r\nLet the reader picture to himself an empty playhouse, after the\r\ncatastrophe of a tragedy: the curtain raised, the orchestra deserted,\r\nthe lights extinguished, the machinery motionless, the scenery fixed\r\nand smoke-blackened, the actors, the singers, the dancers vanished\r\nthrough the trap-doors and secret passages!\r\n\r\nI have, in a separate work, given the life and death of M. le Duc de\r\nBerry. My reflections made at that time are still true to-day:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A son of St. Louis, the last scion of the Elder Branch,\r\n    escapes the crosses of a long banishment and returns to\r\n    his country; he begins to taste happiness; he indulges the\r\n    hope of seeing himself revive, of at the same time seeing\r\n    the monarchy revive in the children that God promises him:\r\n    suddenly he is struck down in the midst of his hopes, almost\r\n    in the arms of his wife. He is going to die, and he is not\r\n    full of years! Might he not accuse Heaven, ask It why It\r\n    treats him with such severity? Ah, how pardonable it would\r\n    have been in him to complain of his destiny! For, after all,\r\n    what harm did he do? He lived familiarly among us in perfect\r\n    simplicity, mingled in our pleasures and assuaged our pains;\r\n    already six of his relations have perished: why murder him\r\n    also, why seek out him, innocent, him so far from the throne,\r\n    twenty-seven years after the death of Louis XVI.? Let us\r\n    learn to know better the heart of a Bourbon! That heart, all\r\n    pierced by the dagger, was not able to find a single murmur\r\n    against us: not one regret for life, not one bitter word was\r\n    uttered by the Prince. A husband, son, father and brother, a\r\n    prey to every anguish of the mind, to every suffering of the\r\n    body, he does not cease to ask pardon for 'the man,' whom he\r\n    does not even call his assassin! The most impetuous becomes\r\n    suddenly the gentlest character. It is a man attached to\r\n    existence by every tie of the heart, it is a prince in the\r\n    flower of his youth, it is the heir to the fairest kingdom on\r\n    earth that is dying: and you would think that it was a poor\r\n    wretch who loses nothing here below.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duc de Berry.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murderer Louvel was a little man with a dirty and sorry face, such\r\nas one sees by the thousand on the Paris streets. He had something\r\nof the cur; he had a snarling and solitary air. It is probable that\r\nLouvel was not a member of any society: he was one of a sect, not of a\r\nplot; he belonged to one of those conspiracies of ideas, the members\r\nof which may sometimes come together, but most frequently act one by\r\none, according to their individual impulse. His brain fed on a single\r\nthought, even as a heart slakes its thirst on a single passion. His act\r\nwas consequent upon his principles: he would have liked to kill the\r\nwhole Dynasty at one blow. Louvel has his admirers even as Robespierre\r\nhas his. Our material society, the accomplice of every material\r\nenterprise, soon destroyed the chapel raised in expiation of a crime.\r\nWe abhor moral sentiment, because in it we behold the enemy and the\r\naccuser: tears would have appeared a recrimination; we were in a hurry\r\nto deprive a few Christians of a cross to weep at.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February 1820, the _Conservateur_[47] paid the tribute\r\nof its regrets to the memory of M. le Duc de Berry. The article\r\nconcluded with this verse of Racine's:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Si du sang de nos rois quelque goutte échappée[48]!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, that drop of blood now flows away on foreign soil!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of the Ministry.]\r\n\r\nM. Decazes fell. The censorship followed and, notwithstanding\r\nthe assassination of the Duc de Berry, I voted against it. The\r\n_Conservateur_ refusing to be soiled by it, that paper came to an end\r\nwith the following apostrophe to the Duc de Berry:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O Christian Prince, worthy son of St. Louis, illustrious\r\n    scion of so many kings, before descending into your last\r\n    resting-place, receive our last homage! You loved, you read a\r\n    work which the censorship is about to destroy. You sometimes\r\n    told us that that work was saving the Throne: alas, we were\r\n    not able to save your days! We are about to cease to write\r\n    at the moment when you cease to exist: we shall have the\r\n    sorrowful consolation of connecting the end of our labours\r\n    with the end of your life[49].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nM. le Duc de Bordeaux saw the light on the 29th of September 1820.\r\nThe new-born was called \"the child of Europe[50]\" and \"the child of\r\nmiracle[51],\" while waiting to become the child of exile.\r\n\r\nSome time before the Princess' confinement, three market-women of\r\nBordeaux, in the name of all the ladies their companions, had a cradle\r\nmade, and chose me to present them, their cradle and themselves, to\r\nMadame la Duchesse de Berry. Mesdames Dasté, Duranton and Aniche\r\ncame to see me. I hastened to ask the gentlemen in attendance for a\r\nceremonial audience. Suddenly, M. de Sèze thought that this honour was\r\nhis by right: it was said that I should never succeed at Court. I was\r\nnot yet reconciled with the Ministry, and I did not seem worthy of the\r\noffice of introducer of my humble ambassadresses. I got out of this\r\ngreat negociation, as usual, by paying their expenses.\r\n\r\nAll this became an affair of State; the pother found its way into\r\nthe papers. The Bordeaux ladies were aware of this, and wrote me the\r\nfollowing letter on the subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"BORDEAUX, 24 _October_ 1820.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"We owe you our thanks for the kindness which you have had\r\n    to lay our joy and our respects at the feet of Madame la\r\n    Duchesse de Berry: this time at least you will not have been\r\n    prevented from being our interpreter. We heard with the\r\n    greatest concern of the stir which M. le Comte de Sèze has\r\n    made in the newspapers, and, if we have kept silence, it\r\n    is because we feared to give you pain. Still, monsieur le\r\n    vicomte, none is better able than yourself to do homage to\r\n    truth and to undeceive M. de Sèze as to our real intentions\r\n    in our choice of an introducer to Her Royal Highness. We make\r\n    you the offer to state all that has passed in a newspaper of\r\n    your own choosing; and, as no one has the right to choose a\r\n    guide for us, and as we had been pleased to think until the\r\n    last moment that you would be that guide, what we shall state\r\n    in this respect will necessarily silence all tongues.\r\n\r\n    \"That is what we have determined upon, monsieur le vicomte;\r\n    but we thought it our duty to do nothing without your\r\n    consent. Rely upon it that we will most gladly publish the\r\n    handsome way in which you behaved towards everybody in the\r\n    matter of our presentation. If we are the cause of the\r\n    mischief, we are quite ready to redress it.\r\n\r\n    \"We are, and always shall be,\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur le vicomte,\r\n\r\n    \"Your most humble and most respectful servants,\r\n\r\n    \"Wives DASTÉ, DURANTON, ANICHE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: the new Ministry.]\r\n\r\nI replied to these generous ladies, who were so unlike the great ladies:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you, my dear ladies, for the offer you make me to\r\n    publish in a newspaper all that has happened with regard to\r\n    M. de Sèze. You are excellent Royalists, and I also am a good\r\n    Royalist: we must remember before all that M. de Sèze is an\r\n    honourable man, and that he has been the defender of our\r\n    King. That fine action is not wiped out by a little movement\r\n    of vanity. So let us keep silence: I am content with your\r\n    good accounts of me to your friends. I have already thanked\r\n    you for your excellent fruits: Madame de Chateaubriand and I\r\n    eat your chesnuts every day and talk of you.\r\n\r\n    \"Now permit your host to embrace you. My wife sends you a\r\n    thousand messages, and I remain\r\n\r\n    \"Your servant and friend,\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n    \"Paris, 2 November 1820.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut who thinks of these futile discussions to-day? The joys and\r\nfeasts of the christening are far behind us. When Henry was born, on\r\nMichaelmas Day, did not people say that the archangel was going to\r\ntrample the dragon under foot? It is to be feared, on the contrary,\r\nthat the flaming sword was drawn from its scabbard only to drive out\r\nthe innocent from the earthly paradise and to guard its gates against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHowever, the events which were becoming complicated determined nothing\r\nyet. The assassination of M. le Duc de Berry had brought about the fall\r\nof M. Decazes[52], which was not effected without heart-breakings. M.\r\nle Duc de Richelieu would not consent to afflict his aged master, save\r\non a promise from M. Molé[53] to give M. Decazes a mission abroad. He\r\nset out for the Embassy in London, where I was to replace him[54].\r\nNothing was finished. M. de Villèle remained in seclusion with his\r\nfatality, M. de Corbière. I on my side offered a great obstacle.\r\nMadame de Montcalm[55] never ceased urging me towards quiet: I was\r\nmuch inclined for it, sincerely wishing only to retire from public\r\nlife, which encroached upon me and for which I entertained a sovereign\r\ncontempt. M. de Villèle, although more supple, was not at that time\r\neasy to deal with.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to become a minister: one abruptly and by force, the\r\nother by length of time and by dexterity; the first was not for M. de\r\nVillèle's use: craftiness excludes energy, but is safer and less liable\r\nto lose the ground which it has gained. The essential point in this\r\nmanner of arriving is to accept many blows and to be able to swallow\r\na quantity of bitter pills: M. de Talleyrand made great use of this\r\ndietary of second-rate ambitions. Men generally rise to office through\r\ntheir mediocrity and remain there through their superiority. This\r\nconjunction of antagonistic elements is the rarest thing, and it is for\r\nthat reason that there are so few statesmen.\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle had precisely the commonplace qualities that cleared the\r\nground for him: he allowed noise to be made around him, in order to\r\ngather the fruits of the alarm that caught hold of the Court. Sometimes\r\nhe would deliver warlike speeches, in which, however, a few phrases\r\nallowed a glimmer of hope to pass of the existence of an approachable\r\nnature. I thought that a man of his stamp ought to commence by entering\r\npublic life, no matter how, and in a not too alarming position. It\r\nseemed to me that what he needed was first to be a minister without\r\nportfolio, in order one day to obtain the premiership itself. That\r\nwould give him a reputation for moderation, he would be dressed exactly\r\nto suit him; it would become evident that the parliamentary leader of\r\nthe Opposition was not an ambitious man, since he consented to make\r\nhimself so small in the interests of peace. Any man who has once been a\r\nminister, no matter by what right, becomes one again: a first ministry\r\nis the stepping-stone to the second; the individual who has worn the\r\nembroidered coat retains a smell of portfolio by which the offices find\r\nhim again sooner or later.\r\n\r\nMadame de Montcalm had told me, from her brother, that there was no\r\nlonger any ministry vacant, but that, if my two friends were willing\r\nto enter the Council as ministers of State without portfolio, the King\r\nwould be charmed, promising something better later. She added that,\r\nif I consented to go so far, I should be sent to Berlin. I answered\r\nthat that made no difference; that, for myself, I was always ready\r\nto leave and that I would go to the devil, in the event of the kings\r\nhaving any mission to their cousin to fulfil; but that I would not,\r\nhowever, accept exile, unless M. de Villèle accepted his entrance into\r\nthe Council. I should also have liked to place M. Lainé with my two\r\nfriends. I took the treble negociation upon myself. I had become the\r\nmaster of political France through my own powers. Few people doubt that\r\nit was I who made M. de Villèle's first ministry and who drove the\r\nMayor of Toulouse into the arena.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Under the Duc de Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nI found an invincible obstinacy in M. Lainé's character. M. de Corbière\r\ndid not want to become a mere member of the Council; I flattered him\r\nwith the hope of also obtaining the Public Instruction. M. de Villèle,\r\ngiving way only with repugnance to my desires, at first raised a\r\nthousand objections; his good wits and his ambition at last decided\r\nhim to set forward: everything was arranged. Here are the irrefutable\r\nproofs of what I have just related; wearisome documents of those little\r\nfacts which have justly passed into oblivion, but useful to my own\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"20 _December_[56], _half-past three._\r\n\r\n    \"To M. LE DUC DE RICHELIEU\r\n\r\n    \"I have had the honour to call on you, monsieur le duc, to\r\n    report on the state of things: all is going admirably. I have\r\n    seen the two friends: Villèle at last consents to enter the\r\n    Council as minister secretary of State, without portfolio,\r\n    if Corbière consents to enter on the same terms, with the\r\n    Directorship of Public Instruction. Corbière, on his side,\r\n    is willing to enter on those conditions, provided Villèle\r\n    approves. And so there are no difficulties left Complete your\r\n    work, monsieur le duc; see the two friends; and, when you\r\n    have heard what I am writing to you from their own mouths,\r\n    you will restore to France her internal peace, even as you\r\n    have given her peace with the foreigners.\r\n\r\n    \"Permit me to submit one more idea to you: would you think it\r\n    very inconvenient to make over to Villèle the directorship\r\n    vacant through the retirement of M. de Barante[57]? He\r\n    would then be placed in a more equal position with his\r\n    friend. Still, he told me positively that he would consent\r\n    to enter the Council without portfolio, if Corbière had the\r\n    Public Instruction. I say this only as a means the more of\r\n    completely satisfying the Royalists and of ensuring for\r\n    yourself an immense and steady majority.\r\n\r\n    \"I will lastly have the honour of pointing out to you that\r\n    the great royalist meeting takes place to-morrow evening at\r\n    Piet's, and that it would be very useful if the two friends\r\n    could to-morrow evening say something which would calm any\r\n    effervescence and prevent any division.\r\n\r\n    \"As I, monsieur le duc, am outside all this movement, you\r\n    will, I hope, see in my assiduity no more than the loyalty of\r\n    a man who desires his country's good and your successes.\r\n\r\n    \"Pray accept, monsieur le duc, the assurance of my high\r\n    regard.\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Wednesday._\r\n\r\n    \"I have just written to Messieurs de Villèle and de Corbière,\r\n    monsieur, and I have asked them to call on me this evening,\r\n    for one must not lose a moment in so useful a piece of\r\n    work. I thank you for having pushed on the business so\r\n    rapidly; I hope that we shall come to a happy conclusion.

What was good in it was that the first trial which I\r\nhad made of my political strength restored me my liberty; I was going\r\nto enjoy abroad that liberty within the power. At the bottom of this\r\nliberty, personally new to me, I saw I know not what confused romances\r\nin the midst of realities: was there nothing in Courts? Were not they\r\nsolitudes of another kind? Perhaps they were Elysian fields with their\r\nshades.\r\n\r\nI left Paris on the 1st of January 1821: the Seine was frozen, and for\r\nthe first time I was racing along the roads with the comforts of money.\r\nI was gradually recovering from my contempt for riches; I was beginning\r\nto feel that it was not unpleasant to roll in a good carriage, to be\r\nwell served, not to have to trouble about anything, and to be preceded\r\nby an enormous Warsaw courier, who was always famished and who, in\r\ndefault of the Tsars, would have devoured Poland unaided. But I soon\r\ngot used to my good fortune; I had the presentiment that it would not\r\nlast long and that I should soon be made to go on foot again, as was\r\nright and proper. Before I reached my destination, all that remained\r\nto me of the journey was my primitive taste for travel itself, the\r\ntaste for independence, the satisfaction of having broken the bonds of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nYou shall see, when I am returning from Prague in 1833, what I say\r\nof my old memories of the Rhine: I was obliged, because of the ice,\r\nto ascend its banks and to cross it above Mayence. I troubled myself\r\nlittle with \"Moguntia,\" its archbishop, its three or four sieges, and\r\nthe invention of printing, through which however I reigned. Frankfort,\r\nthe city of the Jews, delayed me only for one of their transactions: to\r\nchange some money.\r\n\r\nThe road was sad: the highway was snowy and hoar-frost covered the\r\nbranches of the pine-trees. I caught sight of Jena in the distance,\r\nwith the worms of its double battle[63]. I passed through Erfurt and\r\nWeimar: at Erfurt, the Emperor was wanting; at Weimar dwelt Goethe[64],\r\nwhom I had admired so much, and whom I admire much less. The singer of\r\nmatter lived, and his old dust still adhered around his genius. I might\r\nhave seen Goethe and did not see him; he leaves a gap in the procession\r\nof the celebrated persons who have defiled before my eyes.\r\n\r\nLuther's[65] tomb at Wittenberg did not tempt me: Protestantism in\r\nreligion is only an illogical heresy, in politics only an abortive\r\nrevolution. After eating, while crossing the Elbe, a little black loaf\r\nkneaded in tobacco-smoke, I should have wanted to drink out of Luther's\r\nbig glass, which is preserved as a relic. From there, passing through\r\nPotsdam and crossing the Spree, a river of ink along which crawl barges\r\nguarded by a white dog, I arrived in Berlin. There lived, as I have\r\nsaid, \"the mock Julian in his mock Athens.\" I sought in vain the sun of\r\nMount Hymettus. I wrote in Berlin the fourth book of these Memoirs. You\r\nhave found in it the description of that city, my trip to Potsdam, my\r\nmemories of the Great Frederic, of his horse, of his greyhounds and of\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\nAlighting on the 11th of January at an inn, I next went to live Unter\r\nden Linden, in the house which M. le Marquis de Bonnay had left, and\r\nwhich belonged to Madame la Duchesse de Dino: I was there received by\r\nMessieurs de Caux, de Flavigny[66] and de Gussy, the secretaries of\r\nlegation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambassador to Prussia.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, I had the honour of presenting to the King[67]\r\nM. le Marquis de Bonnay's letter of recall and my own credentials. The\r\nKing, lodged in an ordinary house, had two sentries at his door for all\r\ndistinction: entered who would; one spoke to him \"if he was at home.\"\r\nThis simplicity of the German sovereigns tends to make the name and\r\nprerogatives of the great less felt by the small. Frederic William went\r\nevery day, at the same hour, in an open cariole which he drove himself,\r\nin a cap and a grey cloak, to smoke his cigar in the Park. I used often\r\nto meet him and we continued our drive, each in his own direction. When\r\nhe entered Berlin again, the sentry at the Brandenburg Gate shouted at\r\nthe top of his voice; the guard took up arms and turned out; the King\r\npassed and all was over.\r\n\r\nOn the same day I paid my court to the Prince Royal[68] and the Princes\r\nhis brothers[69], very lively young officers. I saw the Grand-duke\r\nNicholas[70] and the Grand-duchess[71], newly married, who were being\r\nfeasted. I also saw the Duke[72] and Duchess of Cumberland[73], Prince\r\nWilliam[74], the King's brother, Prince Augustus of Prussia[75], for\r\na long time our prisoner: he had wished to marry Madame Récamier; he\r\nowned the admirable portrait which Gérard[76] painted of her and which\r\nshe had exchanged with the Prince for the picture of Corinna.\r\n\r\nI hastened to find M. Ancillon[77]. We were mutually acquainted through\r\nour works. I had met him in Paris with the Prince Royal, his pupil; he\r\nwas in charge of the Foreign Office in Berlin, ad interim, during the\r\nabsence of Count von Bernstorff[78]. His was a very touching life: his\r\nwife had lost her sight; all the doors in his house were left open; the\r\npoor blind woman wandered from room to room, among flowers, and sat\r\ndown at hap-hazard, like a caged nightingale: she sang well, and died\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nM. Ancillon, like many illustrious Prussians, was of French origin:\r\nas a Protestant minister, he had at first held very Liberal opinions;\r\nlittle by little he cooled. When I met him again in Rome, in 1828, he\r\nhad gone back to moderate monarchy, and he retrograded to absolute\r\nmonarchy. With an enlightened love of generous sentiments, he combined\r\na hatred and fear of the revolutionaries; it was this hatred that drove\r\nhim towards despotism, in order to ask for shelter there. Will they who\r\nstill extol 1793 and admire its crimes never understand to how great an\r\nextent the horror with which one is seized for those crimes acts as an\r\nobstacle to the establishment of liberty?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A fête at Court.]\r\n\r\nThere was a fête at Court, and with that commenced for me honours of\r\nwhich I was very unworthy. Jean Bart[79], to go to Versailles, put\r\non a coat of cloth-of-gold lined with cloth-of-silver, which made him\r\nvery uncomfortable. The Grand-duchess, now Empress of Russia, and the\r\nDuchess of Cumberland chose my arm in a polonaise: my worldly romances\r\nwere beginning. The air of the march was a kind of medley, composed of\r\nvarious pieces, among which, to my great satisfaction, I recognised the\r\nsong of King Dagobert[80]: that encouraged me and came to the rescue\r\nof my timidity. These fêtes were repeated; one of them in particular\r\ntook place in the King's Great Palace. Not caring to undertake the\r\ndescription on my own account, I give it as chronicled in the Berlin\r\n_Morgenblatt_ by the Baroness von Hohenhausen[81]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    BERLIN, 22 _March_ 1821 (_Morgenblatt_ No. 70).\r\n\r\n    \"One of the notable persons present at this entertainment\r\n    was the Vicomte de Chateaubriand, the French Minister, and\r\n    however great the splendour of the spectacle that unfolded\r\n    before their eyes, the fair Berlinese still kept a glance\r\n    for the author of _Atala_, that superb and melancholy novel,\r\n    in which the most ardent love succumbs in the fight against\r\n    religion. The death of Atala and Chactas' hour of happiness,\r\n    during a storm in the ancient forests of America, depicted in\r\n    Miltonian colours, will remain ever engraved in the memory\r\n    of all the readers of the novel. M. de Chateaubriand wrote\r\n    _Atala_ in his youth, painfully tried by his exile from\r\n    his country: hence the profound melancholy and the burning\r\n    passion which breathe throughout the work. At present this\r\n    consummate statesman has devoted his pen solely to politics.\r\n    His last work, the _Vie et la mort du duc de Berry_, is\r\n    written quite in the tone employed by the panegyrists of\r\n    Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de Chateaubriand is of a somewhat short, yet slender,\r\n    stature. His oval countenance has an expression of reverence\r\n    and melancholy. He has black hair and eyes: the latter\r\n    glow with the fire of his mind, which is pronounced in his\r\n    features.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have white hair: so forgive the Baroness von Hohenhausen for\r\nhaving sketched me in my good days, although already she grants me\r\nyears. The portrait, besides, is very handsome; but I owe it to my\r\nsincerity to say that it is not like.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house Unter den Linden was much too large for me, cold and\r\ndilapidated: I occupied only a small part of it. Among my colleagues,\r\nthe ministers and ambassadors, the only one worthy of note was M.\r\nd'Alopeus[82]. I have since met his wife and daughter[83] in Rome with\r\nthe Grand-duchess Helen[84]: if the latter had been in Berlin instead\r\nof the Grand-duchess Nicholas, her sister-in-law, I should have been\r\nbetter pleased.\r\n\r\nM. d'Alopeus, my colleague, had a gentle mania for believing himself to\r\nbe adored. He was persecuted by the passions which he inspired:\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" he used to say, \"I don't know what there is about me;\r\nwherever I go the women follow me. Madame d'Alopeus became obstinately\r\nattached to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have been an excellent Saint-Simonian. Private society has\r\nits own aspect, like public society: in the former, it is always\r\nattachments formed and broken off, family affairs, deaths, births,\r\nprivate sorrows and pleasures; the whole varied in appearance according\r\nto the centuries. In the other, it is always change of ministers,\r\nbattles lost or won, negociations with Courts, kings who disappear, or\r\nkingdoms that fall.\r\n\r\nUnder Frederic II.[85] Elector of Brandenburg, surnamed \"Iron-tooth\";\r\nunder Joachim II.[86], poisoned by the Jew Lippold[87]; under John\r\nSigismund[88], who added the Duchy of Prussia to his Electorate; under\r\nGeorge William[89], \"the Irresolute,\" who, losing his fortresses,\r\nallowed Gustavus Adolphus[90] to chat with the ladies of the Court\r\nand said, \"What is to be done? They have guns;\" under the Great\r\nElector[91], who found nothing in his States but \"heaps of ashes,\r\nwhich prevented the grass from growing[92],\" who gave audience to the\r\nAmbassador of Tartary, \"whose interpreter had a wooden nose and slit\r\nears;\" under his son, the first King of Prussia[93], who, startled out\r\nof his sleep by his wife, took the fever with fright and died of it:\r\nunder all these reigns, the different Memoirs display only a repetition\r\nof the same adventures in private life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House of Hohenzollern.]\r\n\r\nFrederic William I.[94], father of the great Frederic, a stern and\r\neccentric man, was brought up by Madame de Rocoules, the refugee: he\r\nloved a young woman who was unable to soften him; his drawing-room\r\nwas a smoking-room. He nominated the buffoon Gundling[95] President\r\nof the Royal Academy of Berlin; he shut up his son in the Citadel of\r\nCustrin, and Quatt had his head chopped off before the young Prince's\r\neyes: that was the private life of that time. Frederic the Great,\r\nhaving ascended the throne, had an intrigue with an Italian dancer,\r\nthe Barbarini, the only woman he ever approached: he contented himself\r\non his wedding-night with playing the flute under the window of the\r\nPrincess Elizabeth of Brunswick[96] when he married her. Frederic had\r\na taste for music and a mania for verses. The intrigues and epigrams\r\nof the two poets, Frederic and Voltaire[97], disturbed Madame de\r\nPompadour[98], the Abbé de Bernis[99] and Louis XV.[100] The Margravine\r\nof Bayreuth[101] was mixed up in all this with love, such as a poet\r\nmight feel. Literary parties at the King's; next, dogs on unclean\r\narm-chairs; next, concerts before statues of Antinous; next, great\r\ndinner-parties; next, a quantity of philosophy; next, the liberty of\r\nthe press and blows with the stick; next, a lobster or an eel-pie,\r\nwhich put an end to the days of an old great man who wanted to live:\r\nthese are the things with which private society occupied itself in that\r\ntime of letters and battles. And, notwithstanding, Frederic renovated\r\nGermany, established a counterpoise to Austria, and altered all\r\nGermany's relations and all her political interests.\r\n\r\nIn the later reigns, we find the Marble Palace, Frau Rietz[102], with\r\nher son, Alexander Count von der Marck, the Baroness von Stoltzenberg,\r\nmistress to the Margrave Schwed, and formerly an actress; Prince\r\nHenry[103] and his suspicious friends, Fräulein Voss, Frau Rietz's\r\nrival; an intrigue at a masked ball between a young Frenchman and the\r\nwife of a Prussian general; lastly Madame de F------, whose adventure\r\nwe can read in the _Histoire secrète de la cour de Berlin_[104]: who\r\nknows all those names? Who will remember ours? To-day, in the Prussian\r\ncapital, octogenarians scarcely preserve the memory of that past\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Berlin society.]\r\n\r\nThe habits of Berlin society suited me: people \"went to\r\nevening-parties\" between five and six; all was over by nine, and I used\r\nto go to bed just as though I had not been an ambassador. Sleep devours\r\nexistence, which is a good thing:\r\n\r\n\"The hours are short and life is long,\" says Fénelon.\r\n\r\nHerr Wilhelm von Humboldt[105], brother of my illustrious friend\r\nthe Baron Alexander, was in Berlin: I had known him as minister in\r\nRome; suspected by the Government because of his opinions, he led a\r\nretired life; to kill time, he learnt all the languages and even all\r\nthe dialects of the world. He reproduced the peoples, the ancient\r\ninhabitants of a soil, by means of the geographical denominations of\r\nthe country. One of his daughters talked ancient and modern Greek with\r\nequal ease; if one had happened on a good day, one might have chatted\r\nat table in Sanskrit.\r\n\r\nAdelbert von Chamisso[106] lived in the Botanical Gardens, some way\r\nfrom Berlin. I visited him in that solitude, where the plants froze in\r\nthe hot-houses. He was tall, with rather agreeable features. I felt an\r\nattraction towards that exile, a traveller like myself: he had seen the\r\nPolar seas to which I had hoped to penetrate. An Emigrant like myself,\r\nhe had been brought up in Berlin as a royal page. Adelberg, travelling\r\nthrough Switzerland, stopped for a moment at Coppet. He took part in\r\nan excursion on the lake, where he was in danger of being drowned. He\r\nwrote that same day:\r\n\r\n\"I clearly see that I must seek my safety on the high seas.\"\r\n\r\nHerr von Chamisso had been appointed professor at Napoléonville by M.\r\nde Fontanes; later Greek professor at Strasburg; he rejected the offer\r\nin these noble words:\r\n\r\n\"The first condition for working at the instruction of youth is\r\nindependence; though I admire Bonaparte's genius, it is not to my\r\ntaste.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way he refused the advantages offered to him by the\r\nRestoration:\r\n\r\n\"I have done nothing for the Bourbons,\" he said, \"and I cannot accept\r\nthe price of the services and the blood of my fathers. In this age,\r\nevery man must provide for his own existence.\"\r\n\r\nIn Herr von Chamisso's family this note is preserved, written in the\r\nTemple, in the hand of Louis XVI.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I recommend M. de Chamisso, one of my faithful servants, to\r\n    my brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Martyr King had hidden the little note in his bosom to have it\r\nhanded to his first page, Chamisso[107], Adelbert's uncle[108].\r\n\r\nHerr von Chamisso embarked on the ship equipped by Count\r\nRomanzoff[109], and, in company with Captain Kotzebue[110], discovered\r\nthe strait to the east of Behring's Straits and gave his name to one of\r\nthe islands from which Cook had caught sight of the American coast. In\r\nKamchatka he picked up a portrait of Madame Récamier on porcelain and\r\na copy of his little tale, _Peter Schlemihl_, translated into Dutch.\r\nAdelbert's hero, Peter Schlemihl, sold his shadow to the devil: I would\r\nrather have sold him my body.\r\n\r\nI remember Chamisso as I do the imperceptible breeze that lightly\r\nswayed the stalks of the heather through which I passed when returning\r\nto Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing a rule of Frederic II., the Princes and Princesses of the\r\nBlood in Berlin do not see the diplomatic body; but, thanks to the\r\ncarnival, to the marriage of the Duke of Cumberland with the Princess\r\nFrederica of Prussia, sister to the late Queen[111], thanks also to a\r\ncertain relaxation of etiquette which they permitted themselves, it was\r\nsaid, because of my person, I had occasion to be oftener with the Royal\r\nFamily than my colleagues. As from time to time I visited the Great\r\nPalace, I there met the Princess William[112]: she liked taking me\r\nover the apartments. I never saw a sadder expression than hers: in the\r\nuninhabited rooms at the back of the palace, on the Spree, she showed\r\nme a chamber haunted on certain days by a white lady, and, pressing\r\nherself against me with a certain terror, she looked like that white\r\nlady herself. On the other hand, the Duchess of Cumberland told me that\r\nshe and her sister the Queen of Prussia, when both still very young,\r\nhad heard their mother[113], who had recently died, talk to them from\r\nunder her closed curtains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederic William III.]\r\n\r\nThe King, into whose presence I came as I finished my sight-seeing,\r\ntook me to his oratories: he called my attention to the crucifixes\r\nand pictures, and ascribed the honour of those innovations to me,\r\nbecause, said he, having read in the _Génie du christianisme_ that the\r\nProtestants had stripped their cult too bare, he had thought my remark\r\njust: he had not yet reached the excess of his Lutheran fanaticism.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at the Opera, I had a box next to the Royal Box,\r\nsituated facing the stage. I talked with the Princesses; the King went\r\nout between the acts; I met him in the corridor: he would look round to\r\nsee that no one was near us and that we could not be overheard; then\r\nhe would confess to me, in a whisper, his detestation of Rossini[114]\r\nand his love of Gluck[115]. He branched out into lamentations on the\r\ndecadence of art, and, above all, on those gargling notes destructive\r\nof dramatic singing: he confided to me that he dared say this only to\r\nme, because of the people who surrounded him. If he saw any one coming,\r\nhe hurried back into his box.\r\n\r\nI saw a performance of Schiller's[116] Joan of Arc; the Cathedral of\r\nRheims was perfectly copied. The King, who was seriously religious,\r\nwith difficulty endured the representation of Catholic worship on the\r\nstage. Signor Spontini[117], composer of the _Vestal_, was manager of\r\nthe Opera. Madame Spontini, daughter of M. Érard[118], was pleasant,\r\nbut she seemed to atone for the volubility of the language of women\r\nby her own slowness in speaking: any word divided into syllables died\r\naway on her lips; if she had tried to say to you, \"I love you,\" a\r\nFrenchman's love would have had time to fly between the commencement\r\nand the end of those three words. She was unable to finish my name, and\r\nshe did not come to the end without a certain grace.\r\n\r\nA public musical assembly took place two or three times in the week.\r\nIn the evening, on returning from their work, little work-women, their\r\nbaskets on their arms, journeymen artisans, carrying the tools of their\r\ntrades, crowded promiscuously into a hall; on entering, they were given\r\na written sheet of music and they joined in the general chorus with\r\nastonishing precision. It was something surprising to hear those two or\r\nthree hundred blended voices. When the piece was finished, each resumed\r\nhis homeward road. We are very far from this feeling for harmony, a\r\npowerful means of civilization; it has introduced into the cottage of\r\nthe German peasants an education which our rustics lack: wherever there\r\nis a piano, there is no more grossness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the 13th of January, I opened the series of my dispatches with\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs. My mind easily accommodates itself\r\nto this kind of work: why not? Did not Dante[119], Ariosto[120] and\r\nMilton[121] succeed as well in politics as in poetry? No doubt I am\r\nnot Dante, nor Ariosto, nor Milton; nevertheless, Europe and France\r\nhave seen by the _Congrès de Vérone_ what I could do.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor in Berlin treated me, in 1816, as he treated M. de\r\nLameth[122] in his little verses at the commencement of the Revolution.\r\nWhen one is so amiable, he should not leave minute-books behind him,\r\nnor have the orderliness of a clerk when he has not the capacity of a\r\ndiplomatist. It happens, in the times in which we live, that a gust\r\nof wind sends into your place the man against whom you rose up; and,\r\nas the ambassador's duty is first to make himself acquainted with the\r\narchives of the embassy, behold him coming upon the notes in which he\r\nis dealt with in masterly fashion. What would you have? Those profound\r\nminds, which worked for the success of the good cause, could not think\r\nof everything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minute-book revelations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    EXTRACTS FROM THE MINUTE-BOOK OF M. DE BONNAY\r\n\r\n    No. 64. \"22 _November_ 1816.\r\n\r\n    \"All Europe has taken cognizance and approved of the words\r\n    which the King addressed to the newly-formed bureau of the\r\n    Chamber of Peers. I have been asked if it was possible that\r\n    men devoted to the King, that persons attached to his person\r\n    and holding places in his Household or in those of our\r\n    Princes had indeed been able to give their votes to put M. de\r\n    Chateaubriand into the secretaryship. My reply was that, as\r\n    the balloting was secret, no one could know how individual\r\n    votes went.\r\n\r\n    \"'Ah,' exclaimed a leading man, 'if the King could be assured\r\n    of it, I hope that the access to the Tuileries would be\r\n    forthwith closed to those faithless servants.'\r\n\r\n    \"I thought it my duty to make no answer, and I made no\r\n    answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"15 _October_ 1815.\r\n\r\n     . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    \"It will be the same, monsieur le duc, with the measures\r\n    of the 5th and of the 20th of September: both meet with\r\n    nothing but approval in Europe. But what is astonishing is\r\n    to see that very pure and very worthy Royalists continue\r\n    to be smitten with M. de Chateaubriand, notwithstanding the\r\n    publication of a book which lays down the principle that the\r\n    King of France, by virtue of the Charter, is no longer more\r\n    than a moral entity, essentially null, and without a will\r\n    of his own. If any other than he had put forward a similar\r\n    maxim, the same men, not without apparent reason, would have\r\n    qualified him as a Jacobin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere you have me finely put in my place. For the rest, it is a good\r\nlesson; that brings down our pride, by teaching us what will become of\r\nus when we are gone.\r\n\r\nFrom the dispatches of M. de Bonnay and those of some other ambassadors\r\nbelonging to the Old Order, it appears to me that the dispatches\r\ntreated less of diplomatic affairs than of anecdotes relating to\r\npersons in society and at Court; they reduced themselves to a journal,\r\nencomiastic like Dangeau's[123], or satirical like Tallemant's[124].\r\nAnd Louis XVIII. and Charles X. much preferred the amusing letters of\r\nmy colleagues to my serious correspondence. I could have laughed and\r\njested like my predecessors, but the time was past in which scandalous\r\nadventures and petty intrigues were connected with public business.\r\nWhat good would have resulted for my country from a portrait of M. de\r\nHardenberg[125], a handsome old man, white as a swan, deaf as a post,\r\ngoing to Rome without permission, amusing himself with too many things,\r\nbelieving in all sorts of dreams, given over in the last resort to\r\nmagnetism in the hands of Dr. Koreff[126], whom I used to meet on\r\nhorseback, trotting in sequestered neighbourhoods between the devil,\r\nmedicine and the Muses?\r\n\r\nThis contempt for a frivolous correspondence makes me say to M.\r\nPasquier in my letter of the 13th of February 1821, No. 13:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have not spoken to you, monsieur le baron, according to\r\n    custom, of the receptions, the balls, the spectacles, etc.; I\r\n    have not drawn little portraits nor composed useless satires\r\n    for you; I have tried to lift diplomacy out of mere gossip.\r\n    The reign of the commonplace will return when the time of the\r\n    extraordinary has passed: meanwhile, one should describe only\r\n    that which is destined to live and attack only that which\r\n    threatens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Berlin in Winter.]\r\n\r\nBerlin has left me a lasting memory, because the nature of the\r\nrecreations which I found there carried me back to the days of my\r\nchildhood and my youth; only, very real princesses filled the part\r\nof my Sylphide. Old rooks, my eternal friends, used to come to perch\r\non the lime-trees before my window; I threw food to them: when they\r\nhad caught too large a piece of bread, they threw it up again with\r\ninconceivable dexterity to catch a smaller one, in such a way that they\r\nwere able to take another a little larger, and so on up to the chief\r\npiece, which, held at the point of their beak, kept it open, without\r\npermitting any of the increasing layers of bread to fall. His meal\r\nover, the bird would sing after his fashion: _cantus cornicum ut secla\r\nvetusta._ I wandered in the desert spaces of frozen Berlin, but I did\r\nnot hear beautiful voices of young girls issue from its walls, as from\r\nthe old walls of Rome. Instead of white-bearded Capuchins dragging\r\ntheir sandals among flowers, I met soldiers making snow-balls.\r\n\r\nOne day, on turning the corner of the wall of circumvallation,\r\nHyacinthe[127] and I found ourselves face to face with so cutting an\r\neast wind that we were obliged to run across country to regain town,\r\nhalf-dead. We passed through enclosed grounds, and all the watch-dogs\r\nflew at our legs, pursuing us. That day, the thermometer went down to\r\n22 degrees below freezing-point. One or two sentries at Potsdam were\r\nfrozen to death.\r\n\r\nOn the further side of the park was an old abandoned pheasantry: the\r\nPrussian princes do not go shooting. I crossed a little wooden bridge\r\nover a canal leading out of the Spree and found myself among the\r\npine-wood columns which form the portico of the pheasantry. A fox,\r\nwhich reminded one of those in the mall at Combourg, came out of a hole\r\ncontrived in the wall of the preserve, passed the time of day, and\r\nretreated into his coppice.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Park, in Berlin, is a wood of oaks, birches,\r\nbeeches, limes and alders. It lies outside the Charlottenburg Gate, and\r\nis crossed by the high-road leading to that royal residence. To the\r\nright of the Park is an exercise-ground; to the left are booths.\r\n\r\nInside the Park, which was not at that time intersected with regular\r\nwalks, one saw meadows, uncultivated spots, and beech-wood benches, on\r\nwhich Young Germany not long ago had carved hearts pierced by daggers:\r\nunder these stabbed hearts one read the name of \"Sand[128].\" Flights of\r\ncrows, taking up their dwelling in the trees at the approach of spring,\r\nwere beginning to chatter. Living nature was reviving before vegetable\r\nnature, and quite black frogs were being gobbled up by ducks in the\r\nponds which here and there had thawed: those were the nightingales\r\nwhich \"opened the spring-time in the woods\" of Berlin. However, the\r\nPark was not without pretty animals: squirrels scrambled along the\r\nbranches or darted along the ground, sporting their tails as a flag.\r\nWhen I came near the merry-making, the actors climbed the trunks of\r\nthe oaks, stopped in a fork, and snarled at me as I passed below. Few\r\nstrollers frequented the forest, the uneven soil of which was lined and\r\ncut by canals. Sometimes I would meet a gouty old officer who, quite\r\nwarm and lively, would say to me, speaking of the pale ray of the sun\r\nunder which I was shivering with cold:\r\n\r\n\"That's scorching!\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, I came across the Duke of Cumberland, on horseback\r\nand almost blind, pulling up in front of an alder-tree, against\r\nwhich he had ridden and knocked his nose. Some six-horsed carriages\r\nwould pass: in them were the Austrian Ambassadress or the Princess\r\nvon Radziwill and her daughter, fifteen years of age, charming as\r\none of those clouds with maidens' faces that surround Ossian's\r\nmoon. The Duchess of Cumberland nearly always took the same walk as\r\nmyself: at one time, she was returning from a cottage where she had\r\nbeen relieving a poor woman of Spandau; at another, she stopped and\r\ngraciously told me that she had wanted to meet me: an amiable daughter\r\nof the thrones alighting from her car, like the Goddess of Night, to\r\nroam in the forest! I also saw her in her own house: she would repeat\r\nthat she wished to entrust me with her son, that little \"George[129],\"\r\nsince grown into the Prince whom his cousin Victoria[130] would, they\r\nsay, have liked to place by her side on the throne of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duchess of Cumberland.]\r\n\r\nThe Princess Frederica has since dragged out her days on the banks\r\nof the Thames, in those gardens at Kew which formerly saw me wander\r\nbetween my two acolytes, illusion and poverty. After my departure from\r\nBerlin, she honoured me with a correspondence; in it she describes,\r\nfrom hour to hour, the life of an inhabitant of those heaths where\r\nVoltaire passed, where Frederic died, where that Mirabeau hid himself\r\nwho was to commence the Revolution of which I was the victim. One's\r\nattention is captivated on seeing the links by which so many men are\r\nconnected who have never seen each other.\r\n\r\nHere are some extracts from the correspondence opened with me by H.R.H.\r\nthe Duchess of Cumberland:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"19 _April_[131], _Thursday._\r\n\r\n    \"This morning, on waking, I was handed the _last_ evidence of\r\n    your remembrance; later, I passed before your house. I saw\r\n    the windows open as usual, everything was in the same place,\r\n    except yourself! I cannot tell you what this made me feel! I\r\n    now no longer know where to find you; each moment carries you\r\n    farther away; the only fixed point is the 26th, the day on\r\n    which you count on arriving, and the memory which I retain of\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    \"God grant that you may find everything changed for the\r\n    better, both for yourself and for the general good!\r\n    Accustomed as I am to sacrifices, I shall know also how\r\n    to bear that of not seeing you again, if it is for your\r\n    happiness and that of France.\"\r\n\r\n    \"22.\r\n\r\n    \"Since Thursday, I have passed in front of your house every\r\n    day on my way to church; I prayed hard for you there. Your\r\n    windows are constantly open, that touches me: who pays you\r\n    that attention to follow your tastes and instructions, in\r\n    spite of your absence? It occurs to me sometimes that you\r\n    have not gone away; that business detains you, or that you\r\n    want to keep off intruders, so as to finish it at your ease.\r\n    Do not believe that that would mean a reproach: it is the\r\n    only way; but, if that be so, pray tell me, in confidence.\"\r\n\r\n    \"23.\r\n\r\n    \"It is so prodigiously warm to-day, even in church, that I\r\n    cannot take my walk at the usual time: that is all the same\r\n    to me now. The dear little wood has no charm left for me,\r\n    everybody bores me there! This sudden change from cold to\r\n    heat is common in the North; the inhabitants, with their\r\n    moderation of character and sentiments, do not resemble the\r\n    climate.\"\r\n\r\n    \"24.\r\n\r\n    \"Nature has grown much more beautiful; all the leaves have\r\n    come out since your departure: I should have liked them to\r\n    come two days earlier, so that you might have carried away in\r\n    your memory a more smiling picture of your stay here.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Berlin, 12 May 1821.\r\n\r\n    \"Thank God, here is a letter from you at last! I knew quite\r\n    well that you could not write to me earlier; but in spite of\r\n    the calculations which my reason made for me, three weeks,\r\n    or rather twenty-three days, are very long for friendship in\r\n    privation, and to remain without news is like the saddest\r\n    exile: still, memory and hope remained to me.\"\r\n\r\n    \"15 May.\r\n\r\n    \"It is not from my stirrup, like the Grand Turk, but still\r\n    from my bed that I write to you; but this retreat has given\r\n    me all the time to reflect on the new dietary which you\r\n    propose to make Henry V. observe. I like it much; the roast\r\n    lion can only do him great good; only I advise you to make\r\n    him begin with the heart. You will have to make your other\r\n    pupil[132] eat lamb, lest he should play the deuce too much.\r\n    It is absolutely necessary that this plan of education should\r\n    be realized and that George and Henry V. should become good\r\n    friends and good allies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frederica Queen of Hanover.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters from the Duchess.]\r\n\r\nH.R.H. the Duchess of Cumberland continued to write to me from the\r\nwaters at Ems, next from the waters at Schwalbach, and afterwards from\r\nBerlin, where she returned on the 22nd of September in the year 1821.\r\nShe wrote to me from Ems:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Coronation in England will happen without me; I am\r\n    grieved that the King[133] should have fixed on the saddest\r\n    day of my life to have himself crowned: the day on which I\r\n    lost that adored sister[134]. The death of Bonaparte[135]\r\n    has also made me think of the sufferings which he made him\r\n    endure.\"\r\n\r\n    \"BERLIN, 22 _September._\r\n\r\n    \"I have already revisited those long, solitary walks.\r\n    How much obliged I shall be to you if you send me, as\r\n    you promised, the verses which you have written for\r\n    Charlottenburg! I also again took the road leading to the\r\n    house in the wood where you were kind enough to help me in\r\n    relieving the poor woman of Spandau; how good you are to\r\n    remember that name! Everything reminds me of happy times. It\r\n    is not new to regret happiness.\r\n\r\n    \"As I was about to send off this letter, I hear that the King\r\n    has been detained at sea by the storms and probably driven on\r\n    to the Irish coast; he had not arrived in London on the 14th;\r\n    but you will know of his return before we do.\r\n\r\n    \"The poor Princess William to-day received the sad news\r\n    of the death of her mother, the Dowager Landgravine of\r\n    Hesse-Homburg.

I suppress a number of other affectionate\r\nletters: there is about them something suffering and restrained,\r\nresigned and noble, intimate and exalted; they serve as a counterpoise\r\nto what I have said that was perhaps too severe of the Sovereign\r\nHouses. A thousand years earlier, and the Princess Frederica, being a\r\ndaughter of Charlemagne, would have carried off Eginhard[136] at night\r\non her shoulders, lest he should leave traces in the snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just re-read this book in 1840: I cannot help being struck with\r\nthis continual romance of my life. What a series of missed destinies!\r\nHad I returned to England with little George, the possible heir to that\r\ncrown, I should have seen the new dream fade away which could have made\r\nme change my country, in the same way as, if I had not been married, I\r\nshould have remained, on the first occasion, in the land of Shakespeare\r\nand Milton. The young Duke of Cumberland, who has lost his sight, did\r\nnot marry his cousin the Queen of England. The Duchess of Cumberland\r\nhas become Queen of Hanover: where is she? Is she happy? Where am I?\r\nThank God, in a few days I shall no longer have to turn my eyes over my\r\npast life, nor to put these questions to myself. But it is impossible\r\nfor me not to pray Heaven to shed its favours over the last years of\r\nthe Princess Frederica[137].\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been sent to Berlin with the olive-branch, and because my\r\npresence brought trouble into the administration; but, knowing the\r\ninconstancy of fortune, and feeling that my political part was not\r\nplayed out, I watched events: I did not wish to abandon my friends. I\r\nsoon perceived that the reconciliation between the Royalist Party and\r\nthe Ministerial Party was not sincere; distrust and prejudice remained;\r\nthey did not do what they had promised me: they were beginning to\r\nattack me. The entrance into the Council of Messieurs de Villèle\r\nand de Corbière had excited the jealousy of the Extreme Right; it no\r\nlonger marched under the banner of the first, and he, whose ambition\r\nwas impatient, was beginning to grow weary. We exchanged some letters.\r\nM. de Villèle regretted having entered the Council: he was wrong;\r\nthe proof that I had seen right was that, before a year passed,\r\nhe had become Minister of Finance and M. de Corbière obtained the\r\nInterior[138].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter to the Baron Pasquier.]\r\n\r\nI also had an explanation with M. le Baron Pasquier; I wrote to him, on\r\nthe 10th of February 1821:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I hear from Paris, monsieur le baron, by the post which\r\n    arrived this morning, 9 February, that it was found amiss\r\n    that I should have written from Mayence to the Prince von\r\n    Hardenberg, or even that I should have sent him a messenger.\r\n    I have not written to M. de Hardenberg, and still less have\r\n    I sent him a messenger. I desire, monsieur le baron, to be\r\n    spared chicanery. When my services are no longer agreeable,\r\n    let me be told so roundly: I could not be done a greater\r\n    pleasure. I neither asked nor wished for the mission with\r\n    which I have been charged; it was neither by taste nor choice\r\n    that I accepted an honourable exile, but for the sake of\r\n    peace. If the Royalists have rallied to the Ministry, the\r\n    Ministry is aware that I had the good fortune to contribute\r\n    to that union. I should have some right to complain. What\r\n    has been done for the Royalists since my departure? I do** not\r\n    cease to write on their behalf: am I listened to? Monsieur le\r\n    baron, I have, thank God, other things to do in life than to\r\n    attend balls. My country claims me, my wife is ill and needs\r\n    my care, my friends want their guide again. I am either above\r\n    or below an embassy, or even a ministry of State. You cannot\r\n    lack men abler than myself to conduct diplomatic business;\r\n    so it would be unnecessary to seek pretexts to chicane with\r\n    me. I shall understand with half a word; and you will find me\r\n    willing to return to my obscurity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was sincere: that facility for cutting everything and\r\nregretting nothing would have given me great strength, if I had had any\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nMy diplomatic correspondence with M. Pasquier went on; continuing to\r\noccupy myself with the affair of Naples[139], I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 15. \"20 _February_ 1821.\r\n\r\n    \"Austria is doing a service to the monarchies by destroying\r\n    the Jacobin edifice in the Two Sicilies; but she would\r\n    ruin those same monarchies if the result of a salutary and\r\n    necessary expedition were to be the conquest of a province\r\n    or the oppression of a people. Naples must be freed from\r\n    demagogic independence, and monarchical liberty established\r\n    there; irons must be broken, not chains brought there. But\r\n    Austria does not desire a constitution in Naples: what will\r\n    she place there? Men? Where are they? It wants only one\r\n    Liberal priest and two hundred soldiers for the troubles to\r\n    begin all over again.\r\n\r\n    \"It is after the voluntary or forced occupation that you must\r\n    intervene to establish in Naples a constitutional government,\r\n    under which all social liberties will be respected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI always preserved a preponderance of opinion in France which obliged\r\nme to look at home affairs. I ventured to submit the following plan to\r\nmy minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Frankly adopt constitutional government.\r\n\r\n    \"Bring in a bill for septennial elections, without aiming at\r\n    retaining a portion of the present Chamber, which would be\r\n    suspicious, or keeping the whole, which would be dangerous.\r\n\r\n    \"Give up the laws of exception, a source of arbitrariness, an\r\n    eternal subject of quarrels and calumnies.\r\n\r\n    \"Free the communes from ministerial despotism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my despatch of the 3rd of March, No. 18, I reverted to Spain; I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"It may be possible that Spain will soon change her monarchy\r\n    into a republic: her Constitution must bear its fruit. The\r\n    King[140] will either fly or be killed or dethroned; he is\r\n    not strong enough to master the revolution. It is possible\r\n    again that this same Spain might exist for some time in a\r\n    popular state, if she were to form herself into federal\r\n    republics, an aggregation for which she is better suited\r\n    than any other country by the variety of her kingdoms, her\r\n    manners, her laws and even her language.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Naples affair returns three or four times more. On the 6th of\r\nMarch, No. 19, I observe:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"That the Legitimacy has not been able to take deep root in\r\n    a State which has so often changed masters and whose habits\r\n    have been upset by so many revolutions. Affections have not\r\n    had time to be born, manners to receive the uniform imprint\r\n    of centuries and institutions. In the Neapolitan nation are\r\n    many corrupt or wild men who have no mutual connection, and\r\n    who are attached to the Crown only by feeble bonds: royalty\r\n    is too near the _lazzarone_ and too far removed from the\r\n    Calabrian to be respected. The French had too many military\r\n    virtues to establish democratic liberty; the Neapolitans will\r\n    not have sufficient\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Official dispatches.]\r\n\r\nLastly, I said a few words about Portugal and again about Spain.\r\n\r\nThe rumour was being spread that John VI.[141] had embarked at Rio de\r\nJaneiro for Lisbon. It was a frolic of fortune worthy of our time that\r\na king of Portugal should fly to an European revolution to seek shelter\r\nagainst an American revolution, and pass at the foot of the rock on\r\nwhich was confined the conqueror who had formerly compelled him to take\r\nrefuge in the New World.\r\n\r\n\"All is to be feared from Spain,\" I said, on the 17th of March, No. 21;\r\n\"the revolution in the Peninsula will go through its periods, unless\r\nan arm arises capable of stopping it; but where is that arm? That is\r\nalways the question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat arm I had the good fortune to find in 1823: it was the arm of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI am pleased, in this passage from my dispatch of the 10th of April,\r\nNo. 26, to find again my jealous antipathy to the Allies and my\r\npreoccupation for the dignity of France; I said, writing of Piedmont:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I do not at all dread the prolongation of the troubles in\r\n    Piedmont[142] in its immediate results; but it may produce\r\n    a distant evil by justifying the military intervention of\r\n    Austria and Russia. The Russian Army is still moving, and has\r\n    received no counter-order.\r\n\r\n    \"See if, in that case, it would not be for the dignity and\r\n    security of France to occupy Savoy with twenty-five thousand\r\n    men during the whole time that Russia and Austria would\r\n    occupy Piedmont. I am persuaded that that act of vigour and\r\n    of high policy, while flattering French _amour-propre_,\r\n    would, for that reason alone, be very popular and do infinite\r\n    honour to the ministers. Ten thousand men of the Royal Guard\r\n    and a selection from the rest of our troops would easily make\r\n    you up an army of twenty-five thousand excellent and trusty\r\n    soldiers: the white cockade will be secured as soon as it has\r\n    faced the enemy.\r\n\r\n    \"I know, monsieur le baron, that we must avoid wounding\r\n    French _amour-propre_ and that the domination of the Russians\r\n    and Austrians in Italy may revolt our military pride; but we\r\n    have an easy means of contenting it, that is, to occupy Savoy\r\n    ourselves. The Royalists will be charmed and the Liberals\r\n    can only applaud when they see us take up an attitude worthy\r\n    of our strength. We should at the same time have the good\r\n    fortune to crush a demagogic revolution and the honour of\r\n    restoring the preponderance of our arms. It would show a\r\n    poor acquaintance with the French spirit to be afraid of\r\n    collecting twenty-five thousand men to march into a foreign\r\n    country and to cut an equal figure with the Russians and\r\n    Austrians as a military power. I would answer for the event\r\n    with my head. We have been able to remain neutral in the\r\n    Neapolitan affair; can we afford to do so, for our safety and\r\n    for our glory, in the Piedmontese troubles?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here my whole system lies disclosed: I was a Frenchman; I had\r\n    a bold policy long before the Spanish War, and I foresaw the\r\n    responsibility which my very successes, if I obtained any,\r\n    would cause to weigh upon my head.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A recollection of Mirabeau.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    All that I am recalling here can doubtless interest nobody;\r\n    but that is the drawback of Memoirs: when they have no\r\n    historical facts to relate, they tell you only about the\r\n    author's person and weary your life out with it. Let us\r\n    abandon these forgotten shadows! I prefer to remind you that\r\n    Mirabeau, then unknown, was, in 1786, fulfilling in Berlin an\r\n    unsuspected mission[143], and that he was obliged to train a\r\n    pigeon to announce to the King of France the last breath of\r\n    the terrible Frederic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I was thrown into some perplexity,\" says Mirabeau. \"That the\r\n    city gates would be shut was certain; it was even possible\r\n    that the drawbridges of the island of Potsdam would be raised\r\n    the moment death should take place, and should this happen\r\n    my uncertainty would continue as long as it should please\r\n    the new King. On the first supposition, how send off a\r\n    courier? There were no means of scaling the ramparts or the\r\n    palisadoes, without being exposed to a fray, for there are\r\n    sentinels at every forty paces behind the palisadoes, and\r\n    at every fifty behind the wall. What was to be done?... Had\r\n    I been ambassador, the certain symptoms of mortality would\r\n    have determined me to have sent off an express before death.\r\n    For what addition was the word death? How was I to act in my\r\n    present situation? It certainly was most important to serve,\r\n    and not merely to appear to have served....\r\n\r\n    \"I still had great reason to be diffident of the activity of\r\n    our embassy. How did I act? I sent a man, on whom I could\r\n    depend, with a strong and swift horse to a farm four miles\r\n    from Berlin, from the master of which I had some days before\r\n    received two pairs of pigeons, an experiment on the flight of\r\n    which had been made; so that, unless the bridges of the isle\r\n    of Potsdam were raised, I acted with certainty....\r\n\r\n    \"After considering, I did not find we were rich enough to\r\n    throw a hundred guineas away; I therefore renounced all my\r\n    fine projects, which had cost me some thought, some trouble,\r\n    and some louis; and I let fly my pigeons to my man with\r\n    the word 'Return.' Have I done well or ill? Of this I am\r\n    ignorant; but I had no express orders, and sometimes works of\r\n    supererogation gain but little applause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ambassadors were charged, during their residence abroad,\r\n    to draw up a memorandum on the condition of the peoples and\r\n    the governments to which they were accredited. This series of\r\n    memoranda might be useful to the historian. To-day the same\r\n    injunctions are issued, but scarcely one diplomatic agent\r\n    complies with it. I had too little time in my embassies to\r\n    finish off long studies; nevertheless, I made drafts for\r\n    them; my patience for work was not entirely unfruitful. I\r\n    find this commencement of a sketch of my investigations on\r\n    Germany:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"After the fall of Napoleon, the introduction of the\r\n    representative governments into the Germanic Confederation\r\n    reawakened in Germany those first ideas of innovation which\r\n    the Revolution had originally called forth there. They\r\n    fomented for some time with great violence: the youth of\r\n    the country had been called to its defense by a promise of\r\n    liberty; this promise had been greedily received by scholars\r\n    who found in their masters the inclination which science has\r\n    shown, in this century, to second liberal theories. Under\r\n    the sky of Germany, this love of liberty becomes a sort of\r\n    sombre and mysterious fanaticism, which is propagated by\r\n    means of secret societies. Sand came to strike terror into\r\n    Europe. That man, for the rest, who revealed the existence\r\n    of a powerful sect, was no more than a vulgar enthusiast; he\r\n    deceived himself and took a common mind for a transcendental\r\n    mind: his crime went to waste itself upon a writer whose\r\n    genius could not aspire to empire and had not enough of the\r\n    conqueror and the king to merit a dagger-thrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memorandum on Germany.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A sort of tribunal of political inquisition and the\r\n    suppression of the liberty of the press have stopped this\r\n    movement of men's minds; but it must not be believed that\r\n    they have broken its main-spring. Germany, like Italy,\r\n    to-day desires political unity, and with this idea, which\r\n    will remain dormant for a greater or lesser length of time\r\n    according to events and men, one can always be sure, by\r\n    arousing it, to stir the Germanic peoples. The princes or\r\n    ministers who may appear in the ranks of the Confederation\r\n    of the German States will hasten or delay the revolution in\r\n    this country, but they will not prevent the human race from\r\n    developing: every century has its dynasty. To-day there is\r\n    no one left in Germany, nor even in Europe: we have passed\r\n    from the giants to the dwarfs and fallen from the immense\r\n    into the narrow and limited. Bavaria, by means of the bureaus\r\n    formed by M. de Montgelas[144], still pushes on towards\r\n    new ideas, although she has receded in the race, while the\r\n    Landgraviate of Hesse would not even admit that there was\r\n    a revolution in Europe. The Prince[145] who has just died\r\n    wanted his soldiers, who had formerly been soldiers of Jerome\r\n    Bonaparte[146], to wear powder and pig-tails: he mistook old\r\n    fashions for old manners, forgetting that one can copy the\r\n    first, but that one can never restore the second.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Berlin and in the North, the monuments are fortresses; the\r\n    sight of them alone oppresses the heart. If you see these\r\n    places in populous and fertile countries, they give rise to\r\n    the idea of a legitimate defense; the women and children,\r\n    sitting and playing at some distance from the sentries, form\r\n    a rather agreeable contrast; but a fortress on heaths, in\r\n    a desert, only recalls human anger: against whom are those\r\n    ramparts raised, if not against poverty and independence? You\r\n    have to be myself to find a pleasure in prowling at the foot\r\n    of those bastions, in hearing the wind whistle through those\r\n    trenches, in seeing those breastworks raised in prevision\r\n    of enemies who perhaps will never appear. Those military\r\n    labyrinths, those guns mute in face of one another on salient\r\n    and gazoned angles, those stone watch-towers, where you see\r\n    nobody and whence no eye observes you, are of an incredible\r\n    grimness. If, in the dual solitude of nature and war, you\r\n    come across a daisy sheltered under the redan of a glacis,\r\n    that floral amenity relieves you. When, in the castles in\r\n    Italy, I saw goats suspended to the ruins and the goat-girl\r\n    sitting under a parasol pine; when, on the mediæval walls\r\n    with which Jerusalem is surrounded, my eyes plunged into the\r\n    Valley of Cedron upon some Arab women climbing up steeps\r\n    among pebble-stones, the sight was a sad one doubtless, but\r\n    history was there, and the silence of the present allowed the\r\n    sounds of the past to be heard all the more clearly.\r\n\r\n    I had asked for leave of absence on the occasion of the\r\n    baptism of the Duc de Bordeaux. Being granted this leave,\r\n    I prepared to start: Voltaire, in a letter to his niece,\r\n    says that he sees the Spree flow, that the Spree empties\r\n    itself into the Elbe, the Elbe into the sea, and that\r\n    the sea receives the Seine; he thus came down to Paris.\r\n    Before leaving Berlin, I went to pay a last visit to\r\n    Charlottenburg; it was not Windsor, nor Aranjuez, nor\r\n    Caserta, nor Fontainebleau[147]: the villa, supported by a\r\n    hamlet, is surrounded by an English park, of small extent,\r\n    from which waste land can be seen outside. The Queen of\r\n    Prussia here enjoys a peace which Bonaparte's memory will\r\n    no longer be able to disturb. What an uproar the conqueror\r\n    made, in the old days, in this refuge of silence, when he\r\n    arrived there with his flourishing trumpets and his legions\r\n    blooded at Jena! It was from Berlin, after wiping the kingdom\r\n    of Frederic the Great from the map, that he announced the\r\n    continental blockade and prepared the Moscow campaign in his\r\n    mind; his words had already carried death to the heart of an\r\n    accomplished sovereign: she now sleeps at Charlottenburg,\r\n    in a monumental vault; a statue, a fine portrait in marble,\r\n    represents her. I wrote some verses on the tomb for which the\r\n    Duchess of Cumberland asked me[148].\r\n\r\n    I arrived in Paris[149] at the time of the celebration for\r\n    the baptism of M. le Duc de Bordeaux. The cradle of the\r\n    descendant of Louis XIV., of which I had had the honour to\r\n    pay the carriage[150], has disappeared like that of the King\r\n    of Rome. In a time different from the present, Louvel's\r\n    outrage would have ensured the sceptre to Henry V.; but crime\r\n    no longer constitutes a right, except for the man who commits\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baptism of the Duc de Bordeaux.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the baptism of M. le Duc de Bordeaux[151], I was at\r\n    last reinstated in my ministry of State: M. de Richelieu had\r\n    taken it from me, M. de Richelieu restored it to me; the\r\n    reparation gave me no more pleasure than the wrong had given\r\n    me offense.\r\n\r\n    While I was looking forward to returning to see my crows, the\r\n    cards were being shuffled: M. de Villèle resigned[152]. Loyal\r\n    to my friendship and my political principles, I thought it\r\n    my duty to retire into private life with him. I wrote to M.\r\n    Pasquier:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 30 _July_ 1821.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE BARON,\r\n\r\n    \"When you were good enough to invite me to call on you, on\r\n    the 14th of this month, it was to tell me that my presence\r\n    was necessary in Berlin. I had the honour to reply that,\r\n    as Messieurs de Corbière and de Villèle appeared to be\r\n    retiring from office, it was my duty to follow them. In the\r\n    practice of representative government, it is the usage that\r\n    men of the same opinion should share the same fortune. What\r\n    usage demands, monsieur le baron, honour commands of me,\r\n    since it is a question, not of a favour, but of a disgrace.\r\n    In consequence, I now repeat to you in writing the offer\r\n    which I made to you verbally of my resignation as Minister\r\n    Plenipotentiary to the Court of Berlin. I hope, monsieur le\r\n    baron, that you will kindly lay it at the King's feet. I\r\n    entreat His Majesty to accept its motives and to believe in\r\n    my profound and respectful gratitude for the kindness with\r\n    which he has deigned to honour me.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI announced to M. le Comte de Bernstorff the event which was breaking\r\noff our diplomatic relations; he wrote in reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"Although I ought long to have expected the intelligence\r\n    which you have been good enough to send me, I am none the\r\n    less painfully affected by it. I know and respect the motives\r\n    which, in this delicate circumstance, have determined your\r\n    resolutions; but, while adding new claims to those which have\r\n    in this country won for you an universal esteem, they also\r\n    add to the regrets which are here felt at the certainty of a\r\n    loss long dreaded and for ever irreparable. These sentiments\r\n    are keenly shared by the King and the Royal Family, and I\r\n    am only awaiting the moment of your recall to tell you so\r\n    officially.\r\n\r\n    \"Bear me kindly in your remembrance, I pray you, and accept\r\n    the renewed expression of my inviolable devotion and of the\r\n    high regard with which I have the honour to be, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    \"BERNSTORFF.\"\r\n\r\n    \"BERLIN, 25 _August_ 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had hastened to express my friendship and my regrets to M. Ancillon:\r\nhis very beautiful reply (leaving my praises on one side) deserves to\r\nbe recorded here:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"BERLIN, 22 _September_ 1821.\r\n\r\n    \"And so, monsieur and illustrious friend, you are irrevocably\r\n    lost to us? I foresaw this misfortune, and yet it has\r\n    affected me as though it had been unexpected. We deserved\r\n    to keep you and to possess you, because at least we had the\r\n    feeble merit of feeling, recognizing, admiring all your\r\n    superiority. To tell you that the King, the Princes, the\r\n    Court and the Town regret you is to sound their praises\r\n    rather than yours; to tell you that I rejoice in these\r\n    regrets, that I am proud of them for the sake of my country\r\n    and that I acutely share them would be to fall far short of\r\n    the truth and to give you a very imperfect idea of what I\r\n    feel. Permit me to believe that you know me well enough to\r\n    read my heart. If that heart accuses you, my mind not only\r\n    absolves you, but more, does homage to your noble proceeding\r\n    and to the principles which dictated it. You owed France a\r\n    great lesson and a fine example; you have given her both by\r\n    refusing to serve a ministry which is unable to judge its\r\n    situation and which has not the mental courage necessary to\r\n    extricate itself from it. In a representative monarchy, the\r\n    ministers and those whom they employ in the first places\r\n    must form an homogeneous whole, all the parts of which are\r\n    jointly and severally responsible one to the other. There,\r\n    less than anywhere else, should a man separate himself from\r\n    his friends; he maintains himself and rises with them, he\r\n    descends and falls in the same way. You have proved the\r\n    truth of this maxim to France by resigning with Messieurs\r\n    de Villèle and Corbière. You have taught her at the same\r\n    time that fortune does not enter into consideration where\r\n    principles are concerned; and certainly, if yours had not had\r\n    reason, conscience and the experience of all the centuries\r\n    on their side, the sacrifice which they dictate to a man\r\n    like yourself would be sufficient to establish a powerful\r\n    presumption in their favour in the eyes of all who know\r\n    anything of dignity.\r\n\r\n    \"I impatiently await the result of the coming elections to\r\n    draw the horoscope of France. They will decide her future.\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, my illustrious friend; sometimes, from the heights\r\n    on which you dwell, shed a few drops of dew on a heart which\r\n    will cease to admire and love you only when it ceases to beat.\r\n\r\n    \"ANCILLON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I resign the Berlin embassy.]\r\n\r\nMindful of France's welfare, without occupying myself further with\r\nmyself or my friends, I at that period submitted the following note to\r\nMonsieur:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If the King did me the honour to consult me, this is what I\r\n    should propose for the good of his service and the repose of\r\n    France.\r\n\r\n    \"The Left Centre of the Elective Chamber is gratified at the\r\n    nomination of M.

The handwriting of H.R.H. the Duchess of Cumberland was so\r\ngreatly altered that I had some difficulty in recognising it. The\r\nletter bore the date of the 28th of September 1821: it is the last\r\nwhich I received from that royal hand[154]. Alas, the other noble\r\nfriends who at that time supported me in Paris have quitted this earth!\r\nShall I, then, remain with such stubbornness here below that none of\r\nthe persons to whom I have attached myself can survive me? Happy they\r\non whom age has the effect of wine and who lose their memory when they\r\nhave had their fill of days!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resignations of Messieurs de Villèle and de Corbière were not long\r\nin bringing about the dissolution of the Cabinet and the return of my\r\nfriends to the Council, as I had foreseen: M. le Vicomte de Montmorency\r\nwas appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. de Villèle Minister of\r\nFinance, M. de Corbière Minister of the Interior[155]. I had played too\r\ngreat a part in recent political movements and exercised too great an\r\ninfluence on public opinion to be left on one side. It was resolved\r\nthat I should replace M. le Duc Decazes at the London Embassy. Louis\r\nXVIII. always consented to send me away. I went to thank him; he spoke\r\nto me of his favourite with a constancy of attachment rare in kings; he\r\n\"begged\" me to remove from the mind of George IV. the prejudice which\r\nthat sovereign had conceived against M. Decazes, and myself to forget\r\nthe differences which had existed between me and the former Minister of\r\nPolice.

There is found the description of old England,\r\nand, as I retraced all this at the time of my embassy (1822), the\r\nchanges that had come over the manners and persons of the time between\r\n1793 and the end of the century struck me: I was naturally led to\r\ncompare what I saw in 1822 with what I had seen during the seven years\r\nof my exile across the Channel.\r\n\r\nIn this way were told, by anticipation, things which I should now have\r\nto place under the proper date of my diplomatic mission. I spoke to you\r\nof my emotion, of the feelings recalled to me by the sight of those\r\nspots dear to my memory; but perhaps you have not read that part of my\r\nbook? You have done well. It is enough that I should now tell you of\r\nthe place in which the gaps that will be found in the present story of\r\nmy embassy in London are filled up. You see me, therefore, writing in\r\n1839, among the dead of 1822 and the dead that went before in 1793.\r\n\r\nIn London, in the month of April 1822, I was within fifty leagues\r\nof Lady Sutton. I strolled in Kensington Gardens with my recent\r\nimpressions and the early past of my young years: a confusion of times\r\nwhich produces in me a confusion of memories; life which burns out\r\nmingles, like the fire of Corinth, the molten brass of the statues of\r\nthe Muses and Love, of the tripods and the tombs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marquess of Londonderry.]\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary holidays were still proceeding when I alighted at my\r\nhouse in Portland Place. The Under-secretary of State, Mr. Planta[157],\r\ninvited me, on behalf of the Marquess of Londonderry, to go to dine\r\nat North Cray, the noble lord's country-place. This villa, with a\r\nlarge tree before the windows on the garden side, looked out over some\r\nmeadows; a little underwood growing on hillocks distinguished this site\r\nfrom the ordinary English sites. Lady Londonderry[158] was much in\r\nvogue in her quality as a marchioness and as wife of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nMy dispatch of the 12th of April, No. 4, relates my first interview\r\nwith Lord Londonderry; it touches on the affairs with which I had to\r\noccupy myself:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 12 _April_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE[159],\r\n\r\n    \"I went two days ago, on Wednesday the 10th instant, to North\r\n    Cray. I shall now have the honour of giving you an account of\r\n    my conversation with the Marquess of Londonderry. It lasted\r\n    for an hour and a half before dinner, and we resumed it\r\n    later, but less at our ease, because we were no longer alone.\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Londonderry first asked for news of the King's health,\r\n    with a persistency which manifestly revealed a political\r\n    interest; when I had reassured him on this point, he passed\r\n    to the Ministry:\r\n\r\n    \"'It is consolidating itself,' he said.\r\n\r\n    \"I replied:\r\n\r\n    \"'It has never been shaken and, as it belongs to one opinion,\r\n    it will remain the master so long as that opinion prevails in\r\n    the Chambers.'\r\n\r\n    \"This brought us to speak of the elections: he seemed struck\r\n    by what I said of the advantage of a summer session to\r\n    restore order in the financial year; he had not till then\r\n    well understood the state of the question.\r\n\r\n    \"The war between Russia and Turkey next became the subject\r\n    of conversation. Lord Londonderry, when speaking of soldiers\r\n    and armies, appeared to me to be of the opinion of our late\r\n    ministry as to the danger there might be for us in getting\r\n    together large bodies of troops; I opposed this idea, I\r\n    maintained that there was nothing to be feared in leading the\r\n    French soldier into battle; that he would never be unfaithful\r\n    in the sight of the enemy's flag; that our army has lately\r\n    been increased; that it could be trebled to-morrow, if that\r\n    were necessary, without the smallest inconvenience; that, in\r\n    truth, a few non-commissioned officers might shout, 'Long\r\n    live the Charter!' in a garrison, but that our grenadiers\r\n    would always shout, 'Long live the King!' on the battle-field.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not know whether these greater politics made Lord\r\n    Londonderry forget the treaty of the negroes; he did not\r\n    say a word about it to me. Changing the subject, he spoke\r\n    of the message in which the President of the United States\r\n    invites Congress to recognise the independence of the Spanish\r\n    Colonies:\r\n\r\n    \"'Commercial interests,' I said to him, 'may derive some\r\n    advantage from it, but I doubt whether political interests\r\n    will find the same profit in it; there are already enough\r\n    political ideas in the world. To increase the mass of\r\n    those ideas is to compromise more and more the fate of the\r\n    monarchies in Europe.'\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Londonderry abounded in my sense and spoke these\r\n    remarkable words to me:\r\n\r\n    \"'As for us (the English), we are not at all disposed to\r\n    recognise those revolutionary governments.'\r\n\r\n    \"Was he sincere?\r\n\r\n    \"I have had, monsieur le vicomte, to report to you, word\r\n    for word, an important conversation. However, we must not\r\n    hide from ourselves the fact that England will sooner or\r\n    later recognise the independence of the Spanish Colonies;\r\n    public opinion and the impulse of her trade will drive her\r\n    to it. She has already, during the last three years, gone to\r\n    considerable expense to establish secret relations with the\r\n    revolted provinces north and south of the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon the whole, monsieur le vicomte, I have found in\r\n    the Marquess of Londonderry a man of sense, of perhaps\r\n    somewhat doubtful frankness; a man still steeped in the\r\n    old ministerial system; a man accustomed to a submissive\r\n    diplomacy and surprised, without being offended, at language\r\n    more worthy of France; a man, in short, who could not refrain\r\n    from a sort of astonishment while talking with one of those\r\n    Royalists who, since seven years, have been represented to\r\n    him as madmen or imbeciles.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these general affairs were mingled, as in all embassies, private\r\ntransactions. I had to occupy myself with the petitions of M. le Duc\r\nde Fitz-James[160], with the lawsuit of the ship _Eliza Ann_, with the\r\ndepredations of the Jersey fishermen on the Granville oyster-banks,\r\netc., etc. I regretted to be obliged to set aside a little pigeon-hole\r\nin my brain for the papers of the claimants. When one ransacks one's\r\nmemory, it is hard to come across Messieurs Usquin, Coppinger, Deliège\r\nand Piffre. But, in a few years, shall we be better known than those\r\ngentlemen? A certain M. Bonnet having died in America, all the Bonnets\r\nin France wrote to me to claim his succession; those tormentors write\r\nto me still! Yet it ought to be time to leave me in peace. It is all\r\nvery well for me to reply that, the little accident of the fall of the\r\nThrone having occurred, I no longer occupy myself with this world: they\r\nhold out and want their inheritance at all costs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Eastern question.]\r\n\r\nAs to the East, it was in contemplation to recall the different\r\nambassadors from Constantinople. I foresaw that England would not\r\nfollow the movement of the Continental Alliance, and I informed M. de\r\nMontmorency of this. The rupture which had been feared between Russia\r\nand the Porte did not happen: Alexander's moderation delayed the event.\r\nIn this connection, I made a great expenditure of going and coming,\r\nof sagacity and argument; I wrote a multitude of dispatches, which\r\nhave gone to must in our archives with the reports of events that\r\nnever occurred. I at least have this advantage over my colleagues,\r\nthat I attach no importance to my labours; I saw them, without a care,\r\nswallowed up in oblivion with all the lost ideas of mankind.\r\n\r\nParliament resumed its sittings on the 17th of April; the King returned\r\non the 18th, and I was presented to him on the 19th. I gave an account\r\nof this presentation in my dispatch of the 19th; it ended thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"H. B. M., thanks to his close and varied conversation, did\r\n    not give me an opening to tell him something with which the\r\n    King had specially charged me; but the favourable and early\r\n    occasion of a new audience is about to present itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"something\" with which the King had specially charged me related\r\nto M. le Duc Decazes. Later, I executed my orders: I told George\r\nIV. that Louis XVIII. was distressed at the coldness with which the\r\nAmbassador of His Most Christian Majesty had been received. George IV.\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Monsieur de Chateaubriand, I will confess to you: M. Decazes'\r\nmission was not to my liking; it was acting a little cavalierly towards\r\nme. My friendship for the King of France alone made me put up with a\r\nfavourite who had no other merit than his master's attachment. Louis\r\nXVIII. reckoned greatly on my good-will, and he was right; but I could\r\nnot carry indulgence so far as to treat M. Decazes with a distinction\r\nat which England would have taken offense. However, tell your King that\r\nI am touched by what he ordered you to represent to me, and that I\r\nshall always be happy to prove my real attachment for him.\"\r\n\r\nEmboldened by these words, I laid before George IV. all that came to\r\nmy mind in favour of M. Decazes. He answered, half in English, half in\r\nFrench:\r\n\r\n\"_À merveille!_ You are a true gentleman!\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Paris, I gave Louis XVIII. an account of this\r\nconversation: he seemed grateful to me. George IV. had spoken to me\r\nlike a well-bred but easy-going prince; he was free from bitterness\r\nbecause he thought of other things. Nevertheless it did not do to\r\ntrifle with him beyond moderation. One of his table-fellows[161] had\r\nwagered that he would ask George IV. to ring the bell, and that George\r\nIV. would obey. George IV. did in fact ring the bell and said to the\r\ngentleman-in-waiting:\r\n\r\n\"Show this gentleman the door.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of restoring strength and brilliancy to our arms continued to\r\ndominate me. I wrote to M. de Montmorency, on the 13th of April:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have had an idea, monsieur le vicomte, which I submit to\r\n    your judgment. Would you think it amiss that, in the form of\r\n    a conversation with Prince Esterhazy[162], I should give him\r\n    to understand that, if Austria required to withdraw a part of\r\n    her troops, we could replace them in Piedmont? A few rumours\r\n    spread as to an intended muster of our troops in Dauphiné\r\n    would give me a favourable pretext. I proposed to the former\r\n    ministry to garrison Savoy at the time of the revolt in June\r\n    1821[163]. He rejected that measure and I think that, in so\r\n    doing, he made a capital mistake. I persist in thinking that\r\n    the presence of some French troops in Italy would produce a\r\n    great effect on public opinion and that the King's Government\r\n    would derive much glory from it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our bold diplomacy.]\r\n\r\nProofs superabound of the noble character of our diplomacy during the\r\nRestoration. What does this matter to parties? Have I not read this\r\nvery morning, in a newspaper of the Left, that the Alliance forced us\r\nto act as its policeman and to make war on Spain, when the _Congrès\r\nde Vérone_ is there, when diplomatic documents show in an irrefutable\r\nmanner that all Europe, with the exception of Russia, objected to the\r\nwar; that not only did it object to it, but that England openly opposed\r\nit; and that Austria secretly thwarted us by most ignoble measures?\r\nThis will not prevent them from lying afresh to-morrow; they will not\r\neven take the trouble to examine the question, to read that of which\r\nthey speak \"knowingly\" without having read it! Every lie repeated\r\nbecomes a truth: one cannot have too great a contempt for human\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell[164], on the 25th of April, introduced a motion\r\nin the House of Commons on the state of the national representation\r\nin Parliament: Mr. Canning opposed it. The latter, in his turn,\r\nintroduced a Bill to repeal a portion of the Act depriving Catholic\r\npeers of their right of sitting and voting in the House. I was present\r\nat these sittings on the woolsack[165], where the Speaker had made me\r\nsit. Mr. Canning was present, in 1822, at the sitting of the House\r\nof Lords which rejected his Bill; he was hurt at a phrase of the old\r\nChancellor's[166]: the latter, speaking of the author of the Bill,\r\nexclaimed scornfully:\r\n\r\n\"They say he is leaving for India: ah, let him go, this fine gentleman,\r\nlet him go, and a good journey to him!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Canning said to me as we went out:\r\n\r\n\"I'll catch him yet.\"\r\n\r\nLord Holland spoke very well, without, however, recalling Mr. Fox. He\r\nused to spin round, so that he often presented his back to the House\r\nand addressed his remarks to the walls. The peers cried, \"Hear, hear!\"\r\nNo one was offended by this eccentricity.\r\n\r\nIn England, every one expresses himself as he can; petty pleading is\r\nunknown; there is no resemblance in the voice or in the delivery of the\r\nspeakers. The members listen patiently; they are not offended when the\r\nspeaker has no facility; let him splutter, let him hem and haw, let\r\nhim seek his words, they find that he has made \"a fine speech\" if he\r\nhas uttered a few phrases of good sense. This variety of men who have\r\nremained what nature made them ends by being agreeable; it breaks the\r\nmonotony. It is true that there are only a small number of lords and\r\nmembers of the House of Commons who get up to speak. We, always placed\r\nupon a stage, hold forth and gesticulate like a solemn puppet-show. It\r\nwas a useful study to me to pass from the secret and silent monarchy\r\nof Berlin to the public and noisy monarchy of London: one could derive\r\nsome instruction from the contrast between two nations at the two ends\r\nof the ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the King, the re-opening of Parliament, the commencement\r\nof the Season blended duty, business and pleasure: one could meet the\r\nministers only at Court, at balls, or in Parliament. To celebrate His\r\nMajesty's birthday, I dined with Lord Londonderry; I dined on the Lord\r\nMayor's[167] galley, which went up to Richmond: I prefer the miniature\r\n_Bucentaur_ in the arsenal at Venice, which no longer bears more than\r\nthe memory of the Doges and a Virgilian name. In the old days, as an\r\nEmigrant, lean and half-naked, I had amused myself, without being\r\nScipio, by throwing stones into the water along that bank now hugged by\r\nthe Lord Mayor's plump and well-lined barge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diners.]\r\n\r\nI also dined in the East End of the town with Mr. Rothschild[168] of\r\nLondon, of the younger branch of Salomon[169]: where did I not dine?\r\nThe roast-beef equalled that of the Tower of London in stateliness;\r\nthe fish were so long that one could not see their tails; ladies, whom\r\nI met there and nowhere else, sang like Abigail. I quaffed tokay not\r\nfar from the place which had seen me toss off water by the pitcherful\r\nand almost die of hunger; reclining against the silk-squabbed back of\r\nmy well-padded carriage, I saw that same Westminster where I had spent\r\na night locked in the Abbey, and around which I had strolled, covered\r\nwith mud, with Hingant and Fontanes. My house, the rent of which cost\r\nme twelve hundred pounds a year, was opposite the garret inhabited by\r\nmy cousin de La Boüétardais what time, in a red robe, he used to play\r\nthe guitar on a borrowed truckle-bed to which I had offered shelter\r\nbeside my own.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a question of those Emigrant hops at which we\r\nused to dance to the tune of the violin of a counsellor to the Breton\r\nParliament; it was Almack's, conducted by Collinet, that provided\r\nmy delight: a public ball under the patronage of the great ladies\r\nof the West End. There the old and the young dandies met. Among the\r\nold, shone the victor of Waterloo, who aired his glory like a snare\r\nfor women stretched across the quadrilles; at the head of the young,\r\nstood out Lord Clanwilliam[170], said to be the son of the Duke of\r\nRichmond[171]. He did wonderful things: he galloped out to Richmond\r\nand returned to Almack's after twice falling from his horse. He had a\r\ncertain manner of utterance, after the fashion of Alcibiades, which was\r\nthought enchanting. The fashions in words, the affectations of language\r\nand pronunciation changing, as they do, in almost every parliamentary\r\nsession in high society in London, an honest man is wonder-struck at\r\nno longer knowing English, which he believed himself to know perfectly\r\nsix months before. In 1822, the duty of the man of fashion was, at the\r\nfirst glance, to present an unhappy and ailing figure; he was expected\r\nto have something neglected about his person: long nails; beard worn\r\nneither full nor shaved, but seeming to have sprouted at a given moment\r\nby surprise, through forgetfulness, amid the preoccupations of despair;\r\na waving lock of hair; a profound, sublime, wandering and fatal glance;\r\nlips contracted in scorn of the human race; a heart bored, Byronian,\r\ndrowned in the disgust and mystery of existence.\r\n\r\nTo-day it is no longer so: the dandy must have a conquering,\r\nthoughtless, insolent air; he must attend to his dress, wear mustachios\r\nor a beard cut round like Queen Elizabeth's ruff or the radiant disk\r\nof the sun; he reveals the lofty independence of his character by\r\nkeeping his hat on his head, by lolling on the sofa, stretching out his\r\nboots before the noses of the ladies seated in admiration on chairs\r\nbefore him; he rides with a cane which he carries like a wax-taper,\r\nindifferent to the horse which chances to be between his legs. His\r\nhealth must be perfect and his soul always at the height of five or\r\nsix felicities. A few Radical dandies, those most advanced towards the\r\nfuture, possess a pipe.\r\n\r\nBut, no doubt, all these things are changed in the very time which I am\r\ntaking to describe them. They say that the dandy of the present moment\r\nmust no longer know if he exists, if the world is there, if there are\r\nwomen, and if he ought to salute his neighbour. Is it not curious to\r\nfind the original of the dandy under Henry III.?\r\n\r\n\"Those pretty minions,\" says the author of the _Isle des\r\nHermaphrodites_[172], \"wore their hair longish, curled and curled\r\nagain, showing above their little velvet caps, like the women, and\r\ntheir shirt-ruffs of linen all around, starched and half-a-foot wide,\r\nin such fashion that, to see their heads above their ruffs, it seemed\r\nas though it was the head of Saint John in a dish.\" They leave to go\r\nto Henry III.'s chamber, \"swinging their body, their heads and their\r\nlegs so that I thought at every turn that they must needs fall at full\r\nlength.... They found that manner of walking finer than any other.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: London society.]\r\n\r\nAll the English are mad by nature or by fashion.\r\n\r\nLord Clanwilliam passed quickly: I met him again at Verona; he became\r\nBritish Minister in Berlin after me. For a moment we followed the same\r\nroad, although we did not walk with the same step.\r\n\r\nNothing in London succeeded like insolence, as witness d'Orsay[173]\r\nthe brother of the Duchesse de Guiche[174]: he had taken to galloping\r\nin Hyde Park, leaping turnpike gates, gambling, treating the dandies\r\nwithout ceremony; he had an unequalled success and, to crown the whole,\r\nhe ended by carrying off an entire family, father, mother and children.\r\n\r\nThe ladies most in fashion pleased me little; there was one, however,\r\nwho was charming, Lady Gwydyr: she resembled a Frenchwoman in her tone\r\nand manners. Lady Jersey still maintained her position as a beauty.\r\nI met the Opposition at her house. Lady Conyngham belonged to the\r\nOpposition, and the King himself kept a secret liking for his old\r\nfriends. Among the patronesses of Almack's, one marked the Russian\r\nAmbassadress[175].\r\n\r\nThe Countess de Lieven had had some rather ridiculous affairs\r\nwith Madame d'Osmond[176] and George IV. As she was audacious and\r\nwas considered to be in favour at Court, she had become extremely\r\nfashionable. She was thought to have wit, because her husband was\r\nsupposed to have none, which was not true: M. de Lieven[177] was much\r\nsuperior to Madame. Madame de Lieven, with sharp and unprepossessing\r\nfeatures, is a commonplace, wearisome, arid woman, who has only one\r\nstyle of conversation: vulgar politics; for the rest, she knows nothing\r\nand she hides the dearth of her ideas under the abundance of her words.\r\nWhen she finds herself with people of merit, her sterility is silent;\r\nshe invests her nullity with a superior air of boredom, as though she\r\nhad the right to be bored; having fallen through the effect of time,\r\nand being unable to keep from meddling with something, the dowager of\r\nthe Congress has come from Verona to give, in Paris[178], with the\r\npermission of the magistrates of St. Petersburg, a representation\r\nof the diplomatic puerilities of former days. She keeps up private\r\ncorrespondences and has shown herself a specialist in unhappy\r\nmarriages. Our novices have rushed to her rooms to learn to know the\r\nfine world and the art of secrets; they entrust her with theirs, which,\r\nspread abroad by Madame de Lieven, change into underhand tittle-tattle.\r\nThe ministers, and those who aspire to become so, are quite proud to be\r\nprotected by a lady who has had the honour to see M. de Metternich at\r\nthe hours in which the great man, to refresh himself after the weight\r\nof business, amused himself by unravelling silk. Ridicule awaited\r\nMadame de Lieven in Paris. A serious doctrinaire[179] has fallen at\r\nOmphale's feet: \"Love, 'twas thou lost Troy.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was thus distributed in London: at six o'clock in the morning,\r\none hastened to a party of pleasure, consisting of a breakfast in\r\nthe country; one returned to lunch in London; one changed one's\r\ndress to walk in Bond Street or Hyde Park; one dressed again to dine\r\nat half-past seven; one dressed again for the Opera; at midnight,\r\none dressed once more for an evening party or rout. What a life of\r\nenchantment! I should a hundred times have preferred the galleys.\r\nThe supreme height of fashion was to be unable to make one's way\r\ninto the small rooms of a private ball, to remain on the stair-case\r\nblocked by the crowd, and to find one's self nose to nose with the\r\nDuke of Somerset[180]; a state of beatitude to which I once attained.\r\nThe English of the new breed are infinitely more frivolous than we;\r\ntheir heads are turned for a \"show:\" if the Paris executioner were\r\nto go to London, all England would run after him. Did not Marshal\r\nSoult enrapture the ladies[181], like Blücher, whose mustachios they\r\nkissed? Our marshal, who is not Antipater[182], nor Antigonus[183],\r\nnor Seleucus[184], nor Antiochus[185], nor Ptolemy[186], nor any\r\nof the captain-kings of Alexander, is a distinguished soldier, who\r\npillaged Spain while getting beaten, and with whom Capuchins redeemed\r\ntheir lives with pictures. But it is true that, in March 1814, he\r\npublished a furious proclamation against Bonaparte, whom he received\r\nin triumph a few days later: he has since done his Easter duty at\r\nSaint-Thomas-d'Aquin. They show his old boots in London for a shilling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English frivolity.]\r\n\r\nAll reputations are quickly made on the banks of the Thames and\r\nas quickly lost. In 1822, I found that great city immersed in the\r\nrecollection of Bonaparte; the people had passed from the vilification\r\nof \"Nick\" to a stupid enthusiasm. Memoirs of Bonaparte swarmed; his\r\nbust adorned every chimney-piece; his engravings shone in the windows\r\nof all the picture-dealers; his colossal statue, by Canova[187],\r\ndecorated the Duke of Wellington's stair-case. Could they not have\r\nconsecrated another sanctuary to Mars enchained? This deification seems\r\nrather the work of the vanity of a door-porter than of the honour of\r\na warrior. General, you did not defeat Napoleon at Waterloo: you only\r\nforced the last link of a destiny already shattered.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my official presentation to George IV., I saw him several\r\ntimes. The recognition of the Spanish Colonies by England was pretty\r\nwell decided upon; at least it seemed as though the ships of those\r\nindependent States were to be received under their own flag in the\r\nports of the British Empire. My dispatch of the 7th of May reports\r\na conversation which I had had with Lord Londonderry, and the ideas\r\nof that minister. This dispatch, important for the affairs of that\r\ntime, would be almost without interest for the reader of to-day. Two\r\nthings had to be distinguished in the position of the Spanish Colonies\r\nwith regard to England and France: commercial interests and political\r\ninterests. I entered into the details of those interests:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The more I see of the Marquess of Londonderry,\" I wrote\r\n    to M. de Montmorency, \"the subtler I find him. He is a man\r\n    full of resource, who never says what he means; one would\r\n    sometimes be tempted to think him a simple, easy man. In his\r\n    voice, his laugh, his look, he has something of M. Pozzo di\r\n    Borgo. He does not exactly inspire one with confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dispatch concludes thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If Europe is obliged to recognise the _de facto_ governments\r\n    in America, its whole policy must tend to bring monarchies\r\n    to life in the New World, instead of these revolutionary\r\n    republics which will send us their principles together with\r\n    the products of their soil.\r\n\r\n    \"In reading this dispatch, monsieur le vicomte, you\r\n    will doubtless, like myself, experience a movement of\r\n    satisfaction. It is already a great step forward in politics\r\n    to have forced England to wish to associate herself with us\r\n    in interests on which she would not have deigned to consult\r\n    us six months ago. I congratulate myself as a good Frenchman\r\n    on all that tends to put back our country in the high rank\r\n    which she should occupy among foreign nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duc de Richelieu.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was the basis of all my ideas and of all the negociations\r\non colonial affairs with which I occupied myself during the Spanish\r\nWar, almost a year before that war broke out.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of May, I went to Covent Garden, in the Duke of York's[188]\r\nbox. The King appeared. This sovereign, once detested, was greeted\r\nwith acclamations such as he would not, in other days, have received\r\nfrom the monks, the inhabitants of that former convent. On the 26th,\r\nthe Duke of York came to dinner at the Embassy: George IV. was greatly\r\ntempted to do me the same honour, but he feared the diplomatic\r\njealousies of my colleagues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of the Duc de Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nThe Vicomte de Montmorency refused to enter into negociations on the\r\nSpanish Colonies with the Cabinet of St. James. On the 19th of May, I\r\nheard of the almost sudden death of M. le Duc de Richelieu[189]. That\r\nhonest man had patiently borne his first retirement from office; but,\r\nwhen business came to be taken from him for too long a time, he failed\r\nbecause he had not a double life to replace that which he had lost. The\r\ngreat name of Richelieu has been handed down to our time only by women.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions continued in America. I wrote to M. de Montmorency:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 26.\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 28 _May_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"Peru has just adopted a monarchical Constitution. European\r\n    policy should employ every care to obtain a similar result\r\n    in the case of the colonies which declare themselves\r\n    independent. The United States are singularly afraid of the\r\n    establishment of an empire in Mexico. If ever the whole of\r\n    the New World is Republican, the monarchies of the Old World\r\n    will perish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much spoken of the distress of the Irish peasants, and\r\nsociety danced in order to console them. A great full-dress ball at the\r\nOpera occupied sensitive souls. The King, meeting me in a corridor,\r\nasked me what I was doing there and, taking me by the arm, he led me\r\nto his box.\r\n\r\nThe English pit, in my days of exile, was noisy and coarse; sailors\r\ndrank ale in the pit, ate oranges, apostrophized the boxes. I found\r\nmyself one evening next to a sailor who had entered the theatre drunk;\r\nhe asked me where he was; I told him:\r\n\r\n\"At Covent Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty garden, indeed!\" he exclaimed, seized, like Homer's gods, with\r\ninextinguishable laughter.\r\n\r\nInvited lately to an evening-party at Lord Lansdowne's[190], I was\r\npresented by His Majesty to a severe-looking lady, seventy-three years\r\nold: she was dressed in crape, wore a black veil like a diadem on her\r\nwhite hair, and resembled a queen who had abdicated her throne. She\r\ngreeted me in a solemn voice with three mangled sentences from the\r\n_Génie du Christianisme_; then she said to me, with no less solemnity:\r\n\r\n\"I am Mrs Siddons[191].\"\r\n\r\nIf she had said to me, \"I am Lady Macbeth,\" I should have believed her.\r\nI had seen her formerly on the stage in all the strength of her talent.\r\nOne has but to live to find again those wrecks of one century cast by\r\nthe billows of time upon the shore of another century.\r\n\r\nMy French visitors in London were M. le Duc[192] and Madame la Duchesse\r\nde Guiche[193], of whom I will talk to you at Prague; M. le Marquis\r\nde Custine, whom I had seen as a child at Fervacques; and Madame la\r\nVicomtesse de Noailles[194], as agreeable, witty and gracious as though\r\nshe were still wandering, at fourteen years of age, in the beautiful\r\ngardens of Méréville.\r\n\r\nPeople were weary of pleasure; the ambassadors were longing to go on\r\nleave; Prince Esterhazy was preparing to set out for Vienna: he hoped\r\nto be summoned to the Congress, for already they were speaking of a\r\ncongress. M. Rothschild[195] was returning to France after concluding\r\nwith his brother the Russian loan of twenty-three million roubles.\r\nThe Duke of Bedford[196] had fought a duel with the huge Duke of\r\nBuckingham[197], at the bottom of a pit, in Hyde Park; an insulting\r\nsong against the King of France, sent over from Paris and printed\r\nin the London papers, amused the Radical English mob, which laughed\r\nwithout knowing at what.\r\n\r\nI left, on the 6th of June, for Royal Lodge, where the King had gone.\r\nHe had invited me to dine and sleep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George IV.]\r\n\r\nI saw George IV. again on the 12th, 13th and 14th, at His Majesty's\r\nlevee, drawing-room and ball. On the 24th, I gave a fête to the\r\nPrince[198] and Princess[199] of Denmark: the Duke of York had invited\r\nhimself to it.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, the kindness with which the Marchioness Conyngham\r\ntreated me would have been an important thing: she told me that the\r\nidea of His Britannic Majesty's visit to the Continent was not quite\r\nabandoned. I religiously kept this great secret locked in my bosom.\r\nWhat important dispatches would have been written on this word of a\r\nfavourite in the time of Mesdames de Verneuil[200], de Maintenon[201],\r\ndes Ursins[202], de Pompadour! For the rest I should have heated\r\nmyself unduly to obtain any information out of the Court in London: in\r\nvain do you speak, they do not listen to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry especially was impassive: he embarrassed you at once\r\nby his sincerity as a minister and his reserve as a man. He explained\r\nhis policy frankly, with the iciest air, and kept a profound silence as\r\nto facts. He wore an air of indifference to what he said, even as to\r\nwhat he did not say; one could not tell what one was to believe of what\r\nhe showed or concealed. He would not have budged if you had \"caught him\r\nin the ear with a sausage,\" as Saint-Simon says.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry had a sort of Irish eloquence which often aroused\r\nthe laughter of the House of Lords and the gaiety of the public; his\r\nblunders were celebrated, but he also sometimes attained flashes of\r\neloquence which carried away the crowd, as, for instance, his words\r\nrelating to the Battle of Waterloo, which I have recalled.\r\n\r\nLord Harrowby[203] was President of the Council; he spoke correctly,\r\nlucidly, and as one acquainted with the facts. It would be considered\r\nunbecoming in London for a president of the ministers to express\r\nhimself prolixly or rhetorically. He was, moreover, a perfect\r\ngentleman for manner. One day, at the Pâquis, at Geneva, an Englishman\r\nwas announced: Lord Harrowby entered; I recognised him only with\r\ndifficulty: he had lost his old King; mine was exiled. It was the last\r\ntime that the England of my time of grandeur appeared before me.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned Sir Robert Peel[204] and Lord Westmorland[205] in the\r\n_Congrès de Vérone._\r\n\r\nI do not know if Lord Bathurst[206] was descended from or related to\r\nthat Earl Bathurst[207] of whom Sterne wrote:\r\n\r\n\"This nobleman ... is a prodigy; for at eighty-five he has all the wit\r\nand promptness of a man of thirty. A disposition to be pleased, and a\r\npower to please others beyond whatever I knew[208].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst, the minister of whom I am telling you, was well-informed\r\nand well-bred; he kept up the tradition of the old French manners of\r\ngood company. He had three or four daughters who ran, or rather who\r\nflew like sea-swallows, along the waves, white, tall, and slender. What\r\nhas become of them[209]? Did they fall into the Tiber with the young\r\nEnglishwoman of their name?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Liverpool.]\r\n\r\nLord Liverpool[210] was not, like Lord Londonderry, the principal\r\nminister; but he was the most influential and the most respected\r\nminister. He enjoyed that reputation of a religious man and a good man\r\nwhich does so much for him who possesses it; one comes to such a man\r\nwith the confidence which one has for a father; no action seems good\r\nif it is not approved by that godly person, invested with an authority\r\nfar superior to that of talent. Lord Liverpool was the son of Charles\r\nJenkinson, Baron Hawkesbury, Earl of Liverpool[211], the favourite\r\nof Lord Bute[212]. Almost all the English statesmen have begun with\r\nthe literary career, with pieces of poetry more or less good, or with\r\narticles, generally excellent, inserted in the reviews. A portrait\r\nremains of this first Earl of Liverpool when he was private secretary\r\nto Lord Bute; his family is greatly distressed by it: this vanity,\r\npuerile at all times, is doubtless much more so to-day; but we must\r\nnot forget that our most ardent revolutionaries took their hatred of\r\nsociety from natural disgraces or social inferiorities.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Lord Liverpool, who was inclined towards reforms,\r\nand to whom Mr. Canning owed his last ministry, was influenced,\r\ndespite the rigour of his religious principles, by some dislike of\r\nrecollections. At the time when I knew Lord Liverpool, he had almost\r\nreached a Puritan illumination. Habitually he lived alone with an old\r\nsister, some miles out of London. He spoke little; his countenance\r\nwas melancholy; he often bent an ear and seemed to be listening to\r\nsomething sad: one would have said that he was hearing his years fall,\r\nlike the drops of a winter's rain upon the pavement. For the rest, he\r\nhad no passions and he lived according to God.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker[213], Secretary to the Admiralty, famous as a speaker and as\r\na writer, belonged, like Mr. Canning, to the school of Mr. Pitt; but he\r\nwas more sophisticated than the latter. He occupied, at Whitehall, one\r\nof those gloomy apartments from which Charles I. had passed through a\r\nwindow to walk on the same level to the scaffold. One is astonished, in\r\nLondon, on entering the habitations where sit the directors of those\r\nestablishments whose weight makes itself felt to the ends of the earth.\r\nA few men in black frock-coats sitting at a bare table: that is all you\r\nsee; yet those are the directors of the British Navy, or the members of\r\nthat company of merchants, the successors of the Mogul emperors, who\r\nnumber two-hundred millions of subjects in India.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker came to visit me, two years ago, at the Infirmerie de\r\nMarie-Thérèse. He pointed out to me the similarity of our opinions and\r\nof our destinies. Events separate us from the world; politics make\r\nsolitaries, even as religion makes anchorites. When man dwells in the\r\ndesert, he finds within himself some distant image of the Infinite\r\nBeing who, living alone in immensity, sees the revolutions of the\r\nworlds accomplish themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the months of June and July, the affairs of Spain\r\nbegan seriously to occupy the Cabinet of London. Lord Londonderry and\r\nthe majority of the ambassadors displayed a ludicrous anxiety and\r\nalmost dread in talking of these affairs. The Ministry feared lest,\r\nin case of a rupture, we should get the better of the Spaniards; the\r\nministers of the other Powers trembled lest we should be beaten: they\r\nstill saw our army taking the tricolour cockade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispatch on Spanish affairs.]\r\n\r\nIn my dispatch of the 28th of June, No. 35, the dispositions of England\r\nare faithfully stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 35.\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 28 _June_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"It has been more difficult for me to tell you what Lord\r\n    Londonderry thinks, relative to Spain, than it will be easy\r\n    for me to penetrate the secret of the instructions given to\r\n    Sir W. A'Court[214]; however, I will leave nothing undone\r\n    to procure you the information for which you ask me in\r\n    your last dispatch, No. 18. If I have correctly estimated\r\n    the policy of the English Cabinet and the character of\r\n    Lord Londonderry, I am persuaded that Sir W. A'Court has\r\n    taken with him scarcely anything in writing. They will have\r\n    charged him verbally to observe the parties without mixing\r\n    in their quarrels. The Cabinet of St. James does not love\r\n    the Cortes, but it despises Ferdinand. It will certainly do\r\n    nothing for the Royalists. Besides, it will be enough that\r\n    our influence should be exercised in favour of one opinion\r\n    for the English influence to support the other. Our reviving\r\n    prosperity inspires a lively jealousy. It is true that there\r\n    is here, among the statesmen, a certain vague fear of the\r\n    revolutionary passions which are agitating Spain; but this\r\n    fear is silent in the presence of private interests: so much\r\n    so that if, on the one hand, Great Britain could exclude our\r\n    wares from the Peninsula and if, on the other, she could\r\n    recognise the independence of the Spanish Colonies, she\r\n    would easily resign herself to events and console herself\r\n    for the misfortunes which might overwhelm the Continental\r\n    monarchies anew. The same principle that prevents England\r\n    from withdrawing her ambassador from Constantinople makes her\r\n    send an ambassador to Madrid: she severs herself from the\r\n    common destinies and attends only to what she may be able to\r\n    make out of the revolutions of the empires.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReverting to the news from Spain in my dispatch of the 16th of July,\r\nNo. 40, I said to M. de Montmorency:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 40.\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 16 _July_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"The English newspapers, copying from the French newspapers,\r\n    this morning give news from Madrid up to and including the\r\n    8th. I never expected better from the King of Spain, and\r\n    I was not surprised. If that unhappy Prince is doomed to\r\n    perish, the manner of the catastrophe is not a matter of\r\n    indifference to the rest of the world: the dagger would\r\n    lay low only the Monarch, the scaffold might kill the\r\n    Monarchy. Already the judgments on Charles I. and Louis\r\n    XVI. are a great deal too much: Heaven preserve us from a\r\n    third judgment which would appear to establish, through the\r\n    authority of crimes, a sort of right of peoples and a body of\r\n    jurisprudence against the kings! We can now expect anything:\r\n    a declaration of war on the part of the Spanish Government\r\n    is one of the chances which the French Government must have\r\n    foreseen. In any case, we shall soon be obliged to put an end\r\n    to the sanitary cordon, for, once the month of September is\r\n    past and the plague not reappearing at Barcelona, it would\r\n    be a real mockery still to speak of a _sanitary cordon_; we\r\n    should therefore quite frankly confess to an _army_ and give\r\n    the reason which obliges us to maintain that army. Would\r\n    not that be equivalent to a declaration of war against the\r\n    Cortes? On the other hand, shall we break up the sanitary\r\n    cordon? That act of weakness would compromise the safety of\r\n    France, disgrace the ministry and revive the hopes of the\r\n    revolutionary faction in our midst.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc., etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Congress of Vienna and of Aix-la-Chapelle, the princes of\r\nEurope had their heads turned with congresses: it was there that one\r\namused one's self and divided a few peoples. Scarcely was the Congress,\r\ncommenced at Laibach and continued at Troppau, ended, when they thought\r\nof convoking another in Vienna, at Ferrara, or at Verona; Spanish\r\naffairs offered the occasion to hasten the moment. Each Court had\r\nalready marked out its ambassador.\r\n\r\nIn London, I saw every one preparing to leave for Verona: as my head\r\nwas full of Spanish affairs and as I was dreaming of a plan for the\r\nhonour of France, I thought I could be of some use to the new congress\r\nby making myself known in a respect which was not thought of. I had\r\nwritten to M. de Montmorency on the 24th of May; but I met with no\r\nfavour. The minister's long reply is evasive, embarrassed, entangled;\r\na marked aversion to me is ill-disguised under expressions of\r\nfriendliness; it ends with this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Since I am in a confidential mood, noble viscount, I wish\r\n    to tell you what I would not insert in an official dispatch,\r\n    but what has been urged upon me by some personal observations\r\n    and also by some opinions from persons who know the ground\r\n    well upon which you are placed. Has it not already occurred\r\n    to you that one must be mindful, with the English Ministry,\r\n    of certain effects of jealousy and temper which it is always\r\n    ready to conceive at direct marks of favour with the King\r\n    and of credit in society? You must tell me if you have not\r\n    happened to observe some traces of this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough whom had the complaints of my \"credit\" with the King and in\r\n\"society\" (meaning, I suppose, with the Marchioness Conyngham) reached\r\nthe Vicomte de Montmorency? I do not know.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from M. de Villèle.]\r\n\r\nForeseeing, through this private dispatch, that my game was lost with\r\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, I addressed myself to M. de Villèle,\r\nthen my friend, who did not lean much towards his colleague. In his\r\nletter of the 5th of May 1822, he at first replied with a favourable\r\nword:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 5 _May_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you,\" he said, \"for all that you have done for us in\r\n    London; the determination of the Court there on the subject\r\n    of the Spanish Colonies can have no influence on ours; the\r\n    position is very different; we must above all avoid being\r\n    prevented by a war with Spain from acting elsewhere, as we\r\n    must, if affairs in the East brought about new political\r\n    combinations in Europe.\r\n\r\n    \"We will not allow the French Government to be disgraced\r\n    through a failure to participate in the events which may\r\n    result from the present situation of the world; others may\r\n    intervene with more advantage, none with more courage or\r\n    loyalty.\r\n\r\n    \"People are greatly mistaken, I think, both as to the real\r\n    means of our country and as to the power which the King's\r\n    Government is still able to exercise within the forms which\r\n    it has laid down for itself; they offer more resources than\r\n    appears to be believed, and I hope that, when the time comes,\r\n    we shall know how to prove it.\r\n\r\n    \"You will help us, my dear friend, in these great\r\n    circumstances, if they offer themselves. We know it and rely\r\n    upon it; the honour will be for all, and it is not a question\r\n    at present of that partition which will be made according to\r\n    the services rendered; let us all vie in zeal as to who shall\r\n    render the most signal services.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not know, indeed, if this will turn to a congress; but,\r\n    in any case, I shall not forget what you have told me.\r\n\r\n    \"JH. DE VILLÈLE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this first word of good understanding, I brought pressure on the\r\nMinister of Finance through Madame la Duchesse de Duras; she had\r\nalready lent me the support of her friendship against the forgetfulness\r\nof the Court in 1814. She soon received this note from M. de Villèle:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"All that we were saying is said; all that lies in my heart\r\n    and in my mind to do for the public good and for my friend is\r\n    done and shall be done, be certain of it. I have no need to\r\n    be preached to nor to be converted, as I said before; I act\r\n    on conviction and sentiment.\r\n\r\n    \"Receive, madame, the homage of my affectionate respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy last dispatch, dated 9 August, informed M. de Montmorency that Lord\r\nLondonderry would leave for Vienna between the 15th and 20th. The swift\r\nand mighty contradiction of mortal projects was given me; I thought\r\nthat I had to speak to the Most Christian King's Council of human\r\naffairs only, whereas I had to report to it on the affairs of God:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Lord Londonberry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 12 _August_ 1822, _four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n    \"Dispatch transmitted to Paris by the Calais telegraph._\r\n\r\n    \"The Marquess of Londonderry died suddenly this morning,\r\n    12th, at nine o'clock in the morning, at his country-house at\r\n    North Cray.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquess of Londonderry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 49.\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 13 _August_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"If the weather has put no obstacle in the way of my\r\n    telegraphic dispatch, and if no accident has arrived to my\r\n    special messenger, sent off at four o'clock, I hope that you\r\n    have been the first on the Continent to receive the news of\r\n    the sudden death of Lord Londonderry.\r\n\r\n    \"This death was extremely tragic.

Fever broke out on Saturday the 10th\r\n    and Sunday the 11th; but it seemed to subside in the night\r\n    from Sunday to Monday, and on Monday morning the 12th the\r\n    patient seemed so well that his wife, who was nursing him,\r\n    thought she might leave him for a moment. Lord Londonderry,\r\n    whose head was wandering, finding himself alone, got up, went\r\n    into another room, seized a razor and, at the first attempt,\r\n    cut his jugular vein.

He was making a pleasure-trip of a\r\n    business journey. He was to be back on the 15th of October\r\n    for shooting-parties, arranged beforehand, to which he\r\n    had invited me. Providence ordained otherwise, and Lord\r\n    Londonderry has followed the Duc de Richelieu.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some details which did not enter into my dispatches.\r\n\r\nOn his return to London, George IV. told me that Lord Londonderry had\r\ngone to show him the scheme of instructions which he had drawn up for\r\nhimself and which he was to follow at the Congress. George IV. took up\r\nthe manuscript, the better to weigh its terms, and began to read it\r\naloud. He noticed that Lord Londonderry was not listening to him and\r\nthat he was turning his eyes round the ceiling of the closet:\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, my lord?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\n\"It's that insufferable John[215], sir, who is at the door; he will not\r\ngo away, though I am always telling him.\"\r\n\r\nThe King, astonished, folded up the manuscript and said:\r\n\r\n\"You are ill, my lord; go home; get yourself bled.\"\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry went out and went to buy the pen-knife with which he\r\ncut his throat.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, I continued my reports to M. de Montmorency:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Messengers have been sent in every direction, to the\r\n    watering-places, to the sea-side, to the country-houses,\r\n    to fetch the absent ministers. At the time of the accident\r\n    none of them were in London. They are expected to-day or\r\n    to-morrow; they will hold a Council, but they cannot decide\r\n    anything, for in the last result the King will appoint\r\n    their new colleague, and the King is in Edinburgh. It is\r\n    unlikely that His Britannic Majesty will hasten to make a\r\n    choice in the midst of the celebrations. The death of the\r\n    Marquess of Londonderry is a serious matter for England:\r\n    he was not loved, but he was feared; the Radicals hated\r\n    him, but they were afraid of him. Singularly courageous, he\r\n    overawed the Opposition, which did not dare to insult him too\r\n    much in Parliament or in the newspapers. His imperturbable\r\n    coolness, his profound indifference for men and things,\r\n    his instinct for despotism and his secret contempt for\r\n    constitutional liberties made him a minister well-fitted to\r\n    contend successfully with the tendencies of the century. His\r\n    defects became good qualities at a time when exaggeration and\r\n    democracy threaten the world.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"LONDON, 15 _August_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"Further intelligence confirms what I had the honour to tell\r\n    you touching the death of the Marquess of Londonderry, in my\r\n    ordinary dispatch of the day before yesterday, No. 49. Only,\r\n    the fatal instrument with which the unfortunate minister\r\n    cut his jugular vein was a pen-knife, and not a razor as I\r\n    told you. The coroner's report, which you will read in the\r\n    newspapers, will inform you fully. This inquest held on the\r\n    corpse of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, as though on\r\n    the body of a murderer, adds something still more terrible to\r\n    this event\r\n\r\n    \"You are doubtless now aware, monsieur le vicomte, that Lord\r\n    Londonderry had shown proofs of mental alienation some days\r\n    before his suicide and that the King himself had noticed it.\r\n    A slight circumstance to which I had paid no attention, but\r\n    which returned to my memory after the catastrophe, deserves\r\n    to be told. I had gone to see the Marquess of Londonderry,\r\n    some twelve or fifteen days ago. Contrary to his custom and\r\n    to the custom of the country, he received me familiarly\r\n    in his dressing-room. He was about to shave himself and,\r\n    laughing a sardonic laugh, he spoke to me in praise of the\r\n    English razors. I complimented him on the approaching closing\r\n    of the session:\r\n\r\n    \"'Yes,' said he, 'either that must come to an end, or I must.'\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Details of the suicide.]\r\n\r\nAll that the English Radicals and the French Liberals have told\r\nconcerning the death of Lord Londonderry, namely, that he killed\r\nhimself through political despair, feeling that the principles\r\nopposed to his own were going to triumph, is a pure fable invented by\r\nthe imagination of some, the party spirit and silliness of others.\r\nLord Londonderry was not the man to repent of having sinned against\r\nhumanity, for which he cared very little, nor against the enlightenment\r\nof the age, for which he had a profound contempt: madness had come into\r\nthe Castlereagh family through the women.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the Duke of Wellington, accompanied by Lord\r\nClanwilliam, should take Lord Londonderry's place at the Congress. The\r\nofficial instructions were reduced to this: to forget Italy entirely,\r\nnot to mix at all in the affairs of Spain, to negociate, where those of\r\nthe East were concerned, by maintaining peace without increasing the\r\ninfluence of Russia. The chances continued in favour of Mr. Canning,\r\nand the business of the Foreign Office was entrusted _ad interim_ to\r\nLord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\nI attended Lord Londonderry's funeral at Westminster on the 20th of\r\nAugust. The Duke of Wellington appeared moved; Lord Liverpool was\r\nobliged to cover his face with his hat to hide his tears. One heard a\r\nfew cries of insult and joy outside, as the body entered the Abbey.\r\nWere Colbert[216] and Louis XIV.[217] more respected? The living can\r\nteach nothing to the dead; the dead, on the contrary, instruct the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE VICOMTE DE MONTMORENCY TO THE VICOMTE DE CHATEAUBRIAND\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 17 _August._\r\n\r\n    \"Although there are no very important dispatches to entrust\r\n    to your faithful Hyacinthe, I wish nevertheless to send him\r\n    back, according to your own desire, noble viscount, and to\r\n    that which he has expressed to me, on behalf of Madame de\r\n    Chateaubriand, to see him return to you soon. I will make\r\n    use of this to send you a few words of a more confidential\r\n    character on the profound impression made upon us here, as in\r\n    London, by the terrible death of the Marquess of Londonderry,\r\n    and also, by the same occasion, on a matter to which you seem\r\n    to attach a very exaggerated and very exclusive interest.\r\n    The Council of the King has taken advantage of it and has\r\n    fixed for these days, immediately after the closing, which\r\n    took place this morning, the discussion of the principal\r\n    directions to be settled, the instructions to be given, and\r\n    also the persons to be selected: the first question is to\r\n    know if these will be one or several. You have somewhere, I\r\n    seem to think, expressed astonishment that we could think\r\n    of------, not to put you before him, you know very well\r\n    that he cannot be on the same line for us. If, after the\r\n    most mature examination, we did not think it possible to\r\n    avail ourselves of the good-will which you have very frankly\r\n    shown us in this respect, it would doubtless require, in\r\n    order to decide us, grave motives which I would communicate\r\n    to you with the same frankness: the postponement is rather\r\n    favourable to your desire, in this sense, that it would\r\n    be most inconvenient, both for you and for us, that you\r\n    should leave London within the next few weeks and before\r\n    the ministerial decision which continues to occupy all the\r\n    Cabinets. This strikes everybody so much that some friends\r\n    said to me the other day:\r\n\r\n    \"'If M. de Chateaubriand had come at once to Paris, it would\r\n    have been rather annoying for him to be obliged to leave\r\n    again for London.'\r\n\r\n    \"We therefore expect to make this important nomination on\r\n    the return from Edinburgh. The Chevalier Stuart[218] said\r\n    yesterday that surely the Duke of Wellington would go to\r\n    the Congress; it is important that we should know this at\r\n    the earliest possible moment. M. Hyde de Neuville arrived\r\n    yesterday in good health. I was delighted to see him. I renew\r\n    to you, noble viscount, all my inviolable sentiments.\r\n\r\n    \"MONTMORENCY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new letter from M. de Montmorency, mingled with some ironical\r\nphrases, fully confirmed my impression that he did not want me at the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI gave a dinner on St. Louis' Day[219], in honour of Louis XVIII., and\r\nI went to visit Hartwell in remembrance of the King's exile; I was\r\nfulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure. Royal misfortunes\r\nare so common nowadays that one feels but little interest in spots that\r\nhave not been inhabited by genius or virtue. All that I saw in the sad\r\nlittle park at Hartwell was the daughter of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plenipotentiary at Verona.]\r\n\r\nAt last, I suddenly received from M. de Villèle an unexpected note\r\nwhich gave the lie to my previsions and put an end to my uncertainties:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"27 _August_ 1822.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR CHATEAUBRIAND,\r\n\r\n    \"It has just been decided that, so soon as the proprieties\r\n    relating to the King's return to London permit you, you will\r\n    be authorized to come to Paris, thence to proceed to Vienna\r\n    or Verona, as one of the three plenipotentiaries charged to\r\n    represent France at the Congress. The two others will be\r\n    Messieurs de Caraman[220] and de La Ferronnays; which does\r\n    not prevent M. le Vicomte de Montmorency from leaving the\r\n    day after to-morrow for Vienna, in order to assist at the\r\n    conferences which may take place in that city before the\r\n    Congress. He is to return to Paris when the sovereigns leave\r\n    for Verona.\r\n\r\n    \"This for yourself alone. I am glad that this matter has\r\n    taken the turn which you desire. Cordially and entirely\r\n    yours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this note, I prepared to leave.\r\n\r\nThe thunder-bolt which incessantly falls at my feet followed me\r\neverywhere. With Lord Londonderry died old England, which had struggled\r\non till then in the midst of growing innovations. Supervened Mr.\r\nCanning: self-love carried him so far as to talk the language of the\r\npropagandist from his place in Parliament After him appeared the\r\nDuke of Wellington, a Conservative who came to pull down: when the\r\nsentence of societies is pronounced, the hand which was to build\r\nknows only how to demolish. Lord Grey[221], O'Connell[222], all those\r\nlabourers at ruins were working successively at the overthrow of the\r\nold institutions. Parliamentary reform, Irish emancipation, all things\r\nexcellent in themselves, became, thanks to the insalubrity of the time,\r\ncauses of destruction. Fear increased the evils: if men had not been so\r\ngreatly terrified at the threats, they would have been able to resist\r\nwith a certain success.\r\n\r\nWhat need had England to consent to our last troubles? Shut up in her\r\nisland and in her national enmities, she was sheltered. What need had\r\nthe Cabinet of St. James to dread the separation of Ireland? Ireland is\r\nonly England's long-boat: cut the painter, and the long-boat, separated\r\nfrom the big ship, will go to wreck amid the waves. Lord Liverpool\r\nhimself had sad forebodings. I dined with him one day: after dinner,\r\nwe talked at a window overlooking the Thames; down the river we saw\r\na portion of the City, of which the fog and smoke enlarged the bulk.\r\nI praised to my host the solidity of the English Monarchy, kept in\r\nbalance by the even swing of liberty and power. The venerable peer,\r\nraising and stretching out his arm, pointed to the City and said:\r\n\r\n\"What sense of solidity can there be with these enormous towns? A\r\nserious insurrection in London, and all is lost.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me as though I were finishing a journey in England like\r\nthat which I made, in earlier days, on the ruins of Athens, of\r\nJerusalem, of Memphis and Carthage. Summoning to my presence the\r\ncenturies of Albion, passing from renown to renown, seeing them\r\nswallowed up by turns, I feel a sort of painful giddiness. What has\r\nbecome of those brilliant and riotous days in which lived Shakespeare\r\nand Milton, Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, Cromwell and William[223],\r\nPitt and Burke? All that is finished; superiorities and mediocrities,\r\nhatreds and loves, bliss and wretchedness, oppressors and oppressed,\r\nexecutioners and victims, kings and people, all sleep in the same\r\nsilence and the same dust. But what nullities we are, if it is thus\r\nwith the most living part of the human kind, with the genius which\r\nlingers like a shadow of olden time in the present generation, but\r\nwhich no longer lives in itself and which does not know that it ever\r\nexisted!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in England.]\r\n\r\nHow many times has England, in the space of a few hundred years, been\r\ndestroyed? Through how many revolutions has she not passed to come\r\nto the brink of a greater, a more deep-laid revolution, which will\r\nenvelop posterity! I have seen those famous British parliaments in all\r\ntheir mightiness: what will become of them? I have seen England in her\r\nancient manners and in her ancient prosperity: everywhere the little\r\nlonely church with its steeple, Gray's country churchyard, everywhere\r\nnarrow and gravelled roads, valleys filled with cows, heaths spotted\r\nwith sheep, parks, country-houses, towns; few large forests, few birds,\r\nthe sea-breeze. It was not those plains of Andalusia, where I found the\r\nold Christians and the young loves among the voluptuous remains of the\r\npalace of the Moors in the midst of the aloes and palm-trees:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Quid dignum memorare tuis, Hispania, terris\r\n     Vox humana valet?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was not that Roman Campagna, whose irresistible charm is\r\nincessantly calling after me; those waves and that sun were not\r\nthe waves and the sun that bathe and light the promontory on which\r\nPlato[224] taught his disciples, that Sunium where I heard the cricket\r\nsing, in vain asking Minerva for the hearth of the priests of her\r\ntemple; but after all, such as she was, this England, surrounded by her\r\nships, covered with her herds and professing the cult of her great men,\r\nwas charming and redoubtable.\r\n\r\nTo-day her valleys are darkened by the smoke of forges and workshops,\r\nher roads changed into iron ways; and along those roads, in lieu of\r\nMilton and Shakespeare, move wandering boilers. Already the nurseries\r\nof knowledge, Oxford and Cambridge, are assuming a deserted aspect:\r\ntheir colleges and their Gothic chapels, half-abandoned, distress the\r\neye; in their cloisters, near the sepulchral stones of the middle ages,\r\nlie, forgotten, the marble annals of the ancient peoples of Greece:\r\nruins guarding ruins.\r\n\r\nBy these monuments, around which the void was beginning to form, I\r\nleft that part of my spring days which I had re-found; I parted a\r\nsecond time with my youth, on the same shore where I had abandoned it\r\nformerly: Charlotte had suddenly reappeared like that luminary, the\r\ndelight of the shades, which, delayed by the flight of the months,\r\nshould rise in the middle of the night. If you are not too weary, read\r\nin these Memoirs of the effect which the sudden vision of that woman\r\nproduced upon me in 1822. When she had distinguished me before, I did\r\nnot know those other Englishwomen who came to flock round me in my\r\nhour of power and renown: their homage was as fickle as my fortune.\r\nTo-day, after sixteen new years have passed away since my embassy in\r\nLondon, after so many new destructions, my eyes are carried back to\r\nthe daughter of the land of Desdemona and Juliet: she counts now in my\r\nmemory only from the day on which her unexpected presence rekindled the\r\ntorch of my recollections. A new Epimenides[225], awakened after a long\r\nsleep, I fix my gaze upon a beacon so much the brighter in that the\r\nothers are extinguished along the shore; one alone excepted will shine\r\nlong after me.\r\n\r\nI did not finish telling all that concerns Charlotte in the preceding\r\npages of these Memoirs: she came with a part of her family to see\r\nme in France, when I was a minister, in 1823. Through one of those\r\ninexplicable miseries of mankind, preoccupied as I was with a war on\r\nwhich depended the fate of the French Monarchy, something must no doubt\r\nhave been lacking in my voice, for Charlotte, returning to England,\r\nleft me a letter in which she shows herself hurt at the coldness of my\r\nreception. I have dared neither to write to her nor to send back to her\r\nsome literary fragments which she had restored to me and which I had\r\npromised to return to her augmented. If it were true that she had had a\r\ngenuine reason to complain, I would fling into the fire all that I have\r\ntold of my first sojourn across the sea.\r\n\r\nOften the thought has come to me to go to solve my doubts; but could\r\nI return to England, I, who am weak enough not to dare to visit the\r\npaternal rock on which I have marked out my tomb? I am afraid nowadays\r\nof my sensations: time, removing my young years, has made me like those\r\nsoldiers whose limbs have been left on the battle-field; my blood,\r\nhaving a less long road to travel, rushes into my heart with so rapid a\r\nflow that that old organ of my joys and sorrows throbs as though ready\r\nto burst. The wish to burn all that concerns Charlotte, although she is\r\ntreated with religious respect, is mingled in my mind with the longing\r\nto destroy these Memoirs: if they still belonged to me, or if I could\r\nbuy them back, I should succumb to the temptation. I have so great\r\na distaste for everything, so great a contempt for the present and\r\nfor the immediate future, so firm a conviction that men, henceforth,\r\ntaken all together as a public (and that for several centuries), will\r\nbe pitiable, that I blush to consume my last moments in the relating\r\nof past things, in the depicting of a finished world, of which the\r\nlanguage and the name will no more be understood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memories of Lady Sutton.]\r\n\r\nMan is as much deceived by the success of his wishes as by their\r\ndisappointment: I had desired, contrary to my natural instinct, to go\r\nto the Congress; taking advantage of a prejudice of M. de Villèle's,\r\nI had induced him to force M. de Montmorency's hand. Well, my real\r\ninclination was not for that which I had obtained; I should doubtless\r\nhave felt some spite, if I had been compelled to remain in England; but\r\nsoon the idea of going to see Lady Sutton, of making a journey through\r\nthe three kingdoms would have mastered the impulse of a superadded\r\nambition which is not inherent in my nature. God ordained differently,\r\nand I left for Verona: thence the change in my life, thence my\r\nministry, the Spanish War, my triumph, my fall, soon followed by that\r\nof the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nOne of the two handsome children on whose behalf Charlotte had asked me\r\nto interest myself, in 1822, has just been to see me in Paris: he is\r\nnow Captain Sutton; he is married to a charming young wife, and he has\r\ntold me that his mother has been very ill and has lately spent a winter\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nI embarked at Dover on the 8th of September 1822, at the same port\r\nfrom which, twenty-two years earlier, \"M. La Sagne of Neuchâtel\" had\r\nset sail. Between that first departure to the moment of writing,\r\nthirty-nine years have elapsed. When a man looks upon or listens to his\r\npast life, he seems to perceive on a deserted sea the track of a vessel\r\nthat has disappeared; he seems to hear the tolling of a bell of which\r\nthe old tower is not in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, in the order of dates, comes the place of the _Congrès de\r\nVérone_[226], which I have published in two volumes apart. Should any\r\none, by chance, feel a wish to read it, he can find it everywhere.\r\nMy Spanish War, the great political event of my life, was a gigantic\r\nundertaking. The Legitimacy was for the first time about to burn\r\npowder under the White Flag, to fire its first gun-shot after those\r\ngun-shots of the Empire which will be audible to the utmost posterity.\r\nTo bestride Spain with one step, to succeed on the same soil where\r\nformerly a conqueror's arms had encountered reverses, to do in six\r\nmonths what he was unable to do in seven years: who could have laid\r\nclaim to that prodigy? That is, however, what I did; but by how many\r\ncurses has not my head been smitten at the gaming-table at which the\r\nRestoration had seated me! I had before me a France hostile to the\r\nBourbons, and two great foreign ministers, Prince von Metternich and\r\nMr. Canning. Not a day passed but I received letters prophesying a\r\ncatastrophe, for the war with Spain was not at all popular, either\r\nin France or in Europe. Indeed, some time after my successes in the\r\nPeninsula, my fall was not long in arriving.\r\n\r\nIn our ardour, after the receipt of the telegraphic dispatch announcing\r\nthe deliverance of the King of Spain, we ministers hastened to the\r\nPalace. There I had a presentiment of my fall; I received a bucketful\r\nof cold water over my ears which brought me back to my habitual\r\nhumility. The King and Monsieur did not notice us. Madame la Duchesse\r\nd'Angoulême, distracted by her husband's triumph, had eyes for nobody.\r\nThat immortal victim wrote a letter on Ferdinand's deliverance ending\r\nin this exclamation, sublime in the mouth of a daughter of Louis XVI.:\r\n\r\n\"So it is proved that one can save an unfortunate king!\"\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, I returned, before the meeting of the council, to pay\r\nmy court to the Royal Family; the august Princess spoke an obliging\r\nsentence to each of my colleagues: to me she did not address a word. I\r\ndid not, certainly, deserve such an honour. The silence of the orphan\r\nof the Temple can never be ungrateful: Heaven has a right to the\r\nworship of the earth and owes nothing to any one.\r\n\r\nI then lingered on till Whitsuntide; still, my friends were not without\r\nanxiety; they often said to me:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dismissed from office.]\r\n\r\n\"You will be dismissed to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"This minute, if they like,\" I used to reply.\r\n\r\nOn Whitsunday, the 6th of June 1824, I had found my way to the first\r\ndrawing-rooms of Monsieur: an usher came to tell me that I was being\r\nasked for. It was Hyacinthe, my secretary. He told me, when he saw me,\r\nthat I was no longer in office. I opened the packet which he handed me;\r\nI found in it this note from M. de Villèle:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"In obedience to the King's orders, I am at once\r\n    communicating to Your Excellency a decree which His Majesty\r\n    has just issued.\r\n\r\n    \"The Sieur Comte de Villèle, President of our Council of\r\n    Ministers, is charged _ad interim_ with the business of the\r\n    Foreign Office, _vice_ the Sieur Vicomte de Chateaubriand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis decree was written in the hand of M. de Rainneville[227], who is\r\ngood enough still to be embarrassed at it in my presence. Why, gracious\r\nHeaven! Do I know M. de Rainneville? Have I ever given him a thought?\r\nI meet him pretty often. Has he ever perceived that I knew that the\r\ndecree by which I was struck off the list of ministers was written in\r\nhis hand?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, what had I done? Where did my intrigues or my ambition lie?\r\nHad I desired M. de Villèle's place, when going alone and in secret\r\nto walk in the depths of the Bois de Boulogne? It was that strange\r\nlife that ruined me. I had the simplicity to remain as Heaven had\r\nmade me and, because I longed for nothing, they thought that I wanted\r\neverything. To-day I can very well imagine that my life apart was a\r\ngreat mistake. What! You do not want to be anything? Go away! We do not\r\nchoose that a man should despise what we worship, nor that he should\r\nthink himself entitled to insult the mediocrity of our life.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of wealth and the disadvantages of poverty followed me\r\nto my lodging in the Rue de l'Université: on the day of my dismissal, I\r\nhad invitations sent out for a huge dinner-party at the Foreign Office;\r\nI had to send excuses to my guests and to pack three great courses,\r\nprepared for forty persons, into my little kitchen for two people.\r\nMontmirel and his assistants set to work and, cramming saucepans,\r\nfrying-pans and stewpans into every corner, he put his warmed-up\r\nmaster-piece under shelter. An old friend came to share the marooned\r\nsailor's first meal. The Town and the Court came hastening up, for\r\nthere was but one voice on the outrageousness of my dismissal after\r\nthe service which I had just rendered; they were convinced that my\r\ndisgrace would not last long; they gave themselves airs of independence\r\nin consoling a misfortune of a few days, at the end of which they would\r\nprofitably remind the unlucky man returned to power that they had not\r\nabandoned him.\r\n\r\nThey were mistaken; they wasted their courage; they had reckoned on\r\nmy lack of spirit, on my whining, on my toad-eating ambition, on my\r\neagerness to plead guilty, to wait standing on those who had driven me\r\nout: they ill knew me. I retired without even claiming the salary which\r\nwas due to me, without receiving a favour or a groat from the Court; I\r\nclosed my door to whosoever had betrayed me; I refused the condoling\r\ncrowd, and I took up arms. Then all dispersed; universal condemnation\r\nburst forth, and my game, which had at first seemed fine to the\r\ndrawing-rooms and ante-chambers, appeared horrible.\r\n\r\nShould I not have done better, after my discharge, to be silent? Had\r\nnot the brutality of the proceeding brought back the public to me?\r\nM. de Villèle has repeatedly said that the letter of dismissal was\r\ndelayed; by this accident it had the misfortune to be handed to me\r\nonly at the Palace. Perhaps this was so; but, when we play, we must\r\ncalculate the chances of the game; we must, above all, not write to a\r\nfriend of any worth a letter which we should be ashamed to address to\r\na guilty footman whom we would put out of doors without ceremony or\r\nremorse. The irritation of the Villèle party against myself was the\r\ngreater inasmuch as they wished to appropriate my work to themselves\r\nand as I had displayed ability in matters of which I had been supposed\r\nto know nothing.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, with silence and moderation, as they said, I should have been\r\nlauded by the race who live in perpetual adoration of the portfolio;\r\nby doing penance for my innocence, I should have prepared my return to\r\nthe Council. It would have been more in the common course of things;\r\nbut that was taking me for the man I am not; that was suspecting me of\r\na desire to recapture the helm of the State, the wish to make my way:\r\na desire and a wish which would not occur to me in a hundred thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe idea which I had of representative government led me to enter the\r\nOpposition: the systematic Opposition seems to me the only one suited\r\nto that form of government; the Opposition known as \"conscientious\"\r\nis impotent. Conscience can decide a moral fact, it is no judge of\r\nan intellectual fact. It is absolutely necessary to place one's self\r\nunder a leader, an appraiser of good laws and bad. If this be not so,\r\nthen your deputy takes his stupidity for his conscience and votes\r\naccordingly. The so-called \"conscientious Opposition\" consists in\r\nfluctuating between the parties, in champing the bit, in even voting,\r\nshould the case require, for the Ministry, in appearing magnanimous\r\nalthough fretting: an Opposition of mutinous imbecilities among the\r\nsoldiers, of ambitious capitulations among the chiefs. So long as\r\nEngland was sane, she never had other than a systematic Opposition:\r\na man came in and went out with his friends; on leaving office, he\r\ntook his place on the bench of the assailants. As he was considered to\r\nhave resigned because he did not wish to accept a system, that system,\r\nbeing retained by the Crown, must necessarily be combated. Now as men\r\nrepresent only principles, the systematic Opposition aimed only at\r\ncarrying _principles_ when it attacked _men._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of my fall.]\r\n\r\nMy fall made a great noise: those who displayed the most satisfaction\r\ncensured its form. I have since learnt that M. de Villèle hesitated; M.\r\nde Corbière decided the question:\r\n\r\n\"If he enters the Council by one door,\" he is reported to have said, \"I\r\ngo out by the other[228].\"\r\n\r\nI was allowed to go out: it was quite simple that they should prefer M.\r\nde Corbière to me. I bear him no ill-will: I was troubling him, he had\r\nme turned out; he did well.\r\n\r\nThe day after my dismissal and the following days, the _Journal des\r\nDébats_ contained these words, which do such honour to the Messieurs\r\nBertin:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"This is the second time that M. de Chateaubriand stands the\r\n    test of a solemn dismissal.\r\n\r\n    \"He was dismissed as a minister of State, in 1816, for\r\n    having attacked in his immortal work on the _Monarchie selon\r\n    la Charte_, the famous decree of the 5th of September,\r\n    pronouncing the dissolution of the _Chambre introuvable_ of\r\n    1815. Messieurs de Villèle and Corbière were then simple\r\n    deputies, leaders of the Royalist Opposition, and it was for\r\n    taking up their defense that M. de Chateaubriand became the\r\n    victim of the ministerial anger.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, in 1824, M. de Chateaubriand is again dismissed, and it\r\n    is Messieurs de Villèle and Corbière, since become ministers,\r\n    who sacrifice him. Singular thing! In 1816, he was punished\r\n    for speaking; in 1824, they punish him for holding his\r\n    tongue: his crime is that he kept silence in the discussion\r\n    on the law for reducing the rate of interest. Not every\r\n    disgrace is a misfortune; public opinion, the supreme judge,\r\n    will tell us in which class to place M. de Chateaubriand; it\r\n    will tell us also to whom this day's decree shall have proved\r\n    the more fatal, to the victor or the vanquished.\r\n\r\n    \"Who would have said, at the commencement of the session,\r\n    that we should thus spoil the results of the Spanish\r\n    Enterprise? What did we want this year? Nothing except the\r\n    Septennial Act (but, the complete Act) and the Budget. The\r\n    affairs of Spain, of the East, of the Americas, conducted as\r\n    they were, prudently and silently, would have been cleared\r\n    up; the fairest future lay before us; they wanted to gather\r\n    green fruit; it did not fall, and they imagined that they\r\n    could remedy precipitation by violence.\r\n\r\n    \"Anger and envy are evil counsellors; it is not by means of\r\n    the passions and by proceeding with jerks and starts that\r\n    States are governed.\r\n\r\n    \"_P.S._--The Septennial Act has been passed this evening\r\n    in the Chamber of Deputies. One may say that M. de\r\n    Chateaubriand's doctrines triumph after he has left the\r\n    Ministry. This Act, which he had long ago conceived as the\r\n    complement of our institutions, will, together with the\r\n    Spanish War, for ever mark his passing in public life. It\r\n    is very keenly regretted that M. de Corbière should, on\r\n    Saturday, have snatched the opportunity of speaking from him\r\n    who was then his illustrious colleague. The Chamber of Peers\r\n    would at least have heard the swan's song.\r\n\r\n    \"As for ourselves, it is with the liveliest regret that we\r\n    enter again upon a career of combats which we hoped that we\r\n    had, thanks to the union of the Royalists, abandoned for\r\n    ever; but honour, political loyalty, the good of France do\r\n    not permit us to hesitate as to the course which we should\r\n    take.\"\r\n\r\n    The signal for the reaction was thus given. M. de Villèle\r\n    was not too much alarmed by it at first; he did not know the\r\n    strength of men's opinions. Many years were necessary to\r\n    overthrow him, but he fell at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Comments in the _Débuts._]\r\n\r\n    I received from the President of the Council a letter which\r\n    settled everything and which proved, to my great simplicity,\r\n    that I had taken nothing of that which makes a man respected\r\n    and respectable:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 16 _June_ 1824.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"I have hastened to lay before His Majesty the Order by which\r\n    you are granted a full and entire discharge for the sums\r\n    which you have received from the Royal Treasury, for secret\r\n    expenses, during the whole time of your ministry.\r\n\r\n    \"The King has approved of all the provisions of this Order,\r\n    which I have the honour to forward you herewith in the\r\n    original.\r\n\r\n    \"Accept, monsieur le vicomte, etc.\"\r\n\r\n    My friends and I expedited a prompt correspondence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE VICOMTE DE CHATEAUBRIAND TO THE MARQUIS DE TALARU[229]\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 9 _June_ 1824.\r\n\r\n    \"I am no longer minister, my dear friend; they contend that\r\n    you are.

M.\r\nde La Ferronnays had accepted the functions of ambassador under my\r\nministry; later, I, in my turn, became ambassador under the ministry\r\nof M. de La Ferronnays: neither of us thought himself to be rising\r\nor descending. Fellow-countrymen and friends, we mutually did each\r\nother justice. M. de La Ferronnays endured the harshest trials without\r\ncomplaining; he remained loyal to his sufferings and to his noble\r\npoverty. After my fall, he acted on my behalf at St. Petersburg, as\r\nI would have acted on his. An honest man is always sure of being\r\nunderstood by an honest man. I am happy to produce this touching\r\nevidence of the courage, the loyalty and the elevation of soul of M. de\r\nLa Ferronnays. At the moment when I received this note, it was a very\r\nsuperior compensation to me for the capricious and hackneyed favours of\r\nfortune. It is only here, for the first time, that I think it right to\r\nviolate the secrecy which friendship recommended to me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from La Ferronays.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE COMTE DE LA FERRONAYS TO THE VICOMTE DE CHATEAUBRIAND\r\n\r\n    \"ST. PETERSBURG, 24 _July_ 1824.\r\n\r\n    \"The Russian mail of the day before yesterday brought me\r\n    your little letter of the 16th; it will be for me one of the\r\n    most precious of all those which I have had the happiness\r\n    to receive from you; I am keeping it as a title in which I\r\n    glory, and I have the firm hope and the intimate conviction\r\n    that soon I shall be able to present it to you in less\r\n    melancholy circumstances. I shall imitate, monsieur le\r\n    vicomte, the example which you set me, and I shall permit\r\n    myself no reflection upon an event which has, in so abrupt\r\n    and unexpected a manner, broken off the relations which the\r\n    service established between you and myself; the very nature\r\n    of those relations, the confidence with which you honoured\r\n    me, lastly, considerations of a much graver kind, because\r\n    they are not exclusively personal, will explain to you\r\n    sufficiently the motives and all the extent of my regrets.\r\n    What has just occurred still remains entirely inexplicable to\r\n    me; I am absolutely ignorant of the reasons, but I see the\r\n    effects; they were so easy, so natural to foresee, that I am\r\n    astonished that people were so little afraid to set them at\r\n    naught. I am too well acquainted, however, with the nobility\r\n    of the sentiments which animate you and with the purity of\r\n    your patriotism, not to be very sure that you will approve\r\n    of the conduct which I have thought right to follow in this\r\n    circumstance; it was required of me by my duty, by my love\r\n    for my country and even by the interest of your glory; and\r\n    you are too good a Frenchman to accept, in the position in\r\n    which you find yourself, the protection and the support of\r\n    foreigners. You have won for ever the confidence and esteem\r\n    of Europe; but it is France whom you serve, and you belong\r\n    to her alone. She may be unjust; but neither you nor your\r\n    real friends will ever suffer your cause to be made less pure\r\n    or less fine by entrusting its defense to foreign voices. I\r\n    have, therefore, silenced every kind of private feeling or\r\n    consideration in the presence of the general interest; I have\r\n    forestalled measures, the first effect of which would have\r\n    been to arouse dangerous divisions among us and to violate\r\n    the dignity of the Throne. This is the last service which I\r\n    have rendered here before my departure; you alone, monsieur\r\n    le vicomte, shall know of it; the confidence was due to you,\r\n    and I know the nobility of your character too well not to\r\n    feel very sure that you will keep my secret and that you will\r\n    consider my conduct, in this circumstance, consonant with the\r\n    sentiments which you have the right to exact from those whom\r\n    you honour with your friendship and your esteem.\r\n\r\n    \"Adieu, monsieur le vicomte: if the relations which I have\r\n    had the good fortune to have with you have been able to give\r\n    you a correct idea of my character, you must know that it\r\n    is not changes of position that can alter my sentiments,\r\n    nor will you ever doubt the attachment and devotion of one\r\n    who, in the actual circumstances, considers himself the most\r\n    fortunate of men to be placed by public opinion among the\r\n    number of your friends.\r\n\r\n    \"LA FERRONAYS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Messieurs de Fontenay[238] and de Pontcarré[239] are keenly\r\n    alive to the value of the remembrance in which you are good\r\n    enough to bear them: witnesses, like myself, of the increase\r\n    of consideration which France had gained since your entrance\r\n    into the ministry, it is quite simple that they should share\r\n    my sentiments and my regrets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI began the contest of my new opposition immediately after my fall;\r\nbut it was interrupted by the death of Louis XVIII.[240] and was not\r\nactively resumed until after the coronation of Charles X.[241] In the\r\nmonth of July, I joined Madame de Chateaubriand at Neuchâtel; she had\r\ngone there to wait for me, and had hired a cottage beside the lake.\r\nThe chain of the Alps unfolded itself north and south to a great\r\ndistance before us; we had our backs to the Jura, whose flanks, black\r\nwith pine-trees, rose perpendicularly over our heads. The lake was\r\ndeserted; a wooden gallery served me as an exercise-ground. I thought\r\nof _Milord Maréchal._[242] When I climbed to the top of the Jura, I saw\r\nthe Lake of Bienne, to whose breezes and waters Jean Jacques Rousseau\r\nowes one of his happiest inspirations. Madame de Chateaubriand went\r\nto visit Fribourg and a country-house which they had described to us\r\nas charming, and which she found icy-cold, although it was called the\r\n_Petite Provence._ A lean black cat, half wild, which caught little\r\nfish by dipping its paw into a large pail filled with water from the\r\nlake, was my only distraction. A quiet old woman, who was always\r\nknitting, prepared our banquet in an _huguenote._[243] had not lost the\r\nhabit of the collation of the country-mouse.\r\n\r\nNeuchâtel had had its good days; it had belonged to the Duchesse de\r\nLongueville[244]; Jean Jacques Rousseau had walked in an Armenian\r\ndress on its mountains, and Madame de Charrière[245], so daintily\r\nobserved by M. de Sainte-Beuve[246], had described its society in the\r\n_Lettres Neuchâteloises_; but Juliane, Mademoiselle de La Prise, Henri\r\nMeyer[247] were no longer there; I saw only poor Fauche-Borel[248], of\r\nthe old Emigration; he threw himself soon after from his window. The\r\nkept gardens of M. de Pourtalès[249] charmed me no more than did an\r\nEnglish rockery raised by man's hands in a neighbouring vineyard facing\r\nthe Jura. Berthier, last Prince of Neuchâtel, in the name of Bonaparte,\r\nwas forgotten, in spite of his little Simplon of the Val-de-Travers,\r\nand although he smashed his skull in the same way as Fauche-Borel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Louis XVIII.]\r\n\r\nThe King's illness called me back to Paris. The King died on the 16th\r\nof September, scarcely four months after my dismissal. My pamphlet,\r\nentitled _Le Roi est mort: vive le roi!_ in which I hailed the new\r\nSovereign, performed for Charles X. what my pamphlet _De Bonaparte et\r\ndes Bourbons_ had performed for Louis XVIII. I went to fetch Madame de\r\nChateaubriand at Neuchâtel, and we came to Paris to live in the Rue\r\ndu Regard. Charles X. made his reign popular at its commencement by\r\nabolishing the censorship; the coronation took place in the spring of\r\n1825. \"Already the bees were beginning to hum, the birds to warble, and\r\nthe lambs to gambol on the green.\"\r\n\r\nAmong my papers I find the following pages written at Rheims:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"RHEIMS, 26 _May_ 1825.\r\n\r\n    \"The King arrives the day after to-morrow; he will be crowned\r\n    on Sunday the 29th; I shall see him place on his head a\r\n    crown of which no one thought, in 1814, when I raised my\r\n    voice. I have contributed to opening the doors of France to\r\n    him; I have given him defenders, by bringing the Spanish War\r\n    to a satisfactory issue; I have caused the Charter to be\r\n    adopted, and I have succeeded in finding an army, the only\r\n    two things with which the King can reign at home and abroad:\r\n    what part is reserved for me at the coronation? That of an\r\n    outlaw. I come as one of the crowd to receive a ribbon,\r\n    distributed broadcast, which I do not even hold from Charles\r\n    X. The people whom I have served and placed turn their backs\r\n    on me. The King will hold my hands in his, he will see me at\r\n    his feet, when I take my oath, without being moved, even as\r\n    he sees me without interest recommencing my poverty. Does\r\n    that make a difference to me? No. Freed from the obligation\r\n    of going to the Tuileries, I am compensated for everything by\r\n    independence.\r\n\r\n    \"I am writing this page of my Memoirs in the room in which I\r\n    am forgotten amid all the noise. I have this morning visited\r\n    Saint-Remi and the Cathedral decorated with stained paper.\r\n    I shall not have had a clear idea of this latter edifice,\r\n    except from the decorations of Schiller's _Joan of Arc_, as\r\n    played before me in Berlin: operatic machinery has shown me,\r\n    on the banks of the Spree, what operatic machinery hides from\r\n    me, on the banks of the Vesle; for the rest, I have taken my\r\n    diversion among the old dynasties, from Clovis[250], with\r\n    his Franks and his pigeon descending from Heaven, to Charles\r\n    VII.[251], with Joan of Arc[252].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Je suis venu de mon pays\r\n    Pas plus haut qu'une botte,\r\n    Avecque mi, avecque mi,\r\n    Avecque ma marmotte[253].\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"'A sou-piece, sir, if you please!'\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: At Rheims.]\r\n\r\n    That is what a little Savoyard, just arrived at Rheims, sang\r\n    to me returning from my walk.\r\n\r\n    \"'And what have you come here for?' I asked him.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have come to the coronation, sir.'\r\n\r\n    \"'With your marmot?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Yes, sir, with-a _mi_, with-a _mi_, with-a my marmot,' he\r\n    replied, dancing and turning.\r\n\r\n    \"'Well, that's like me, my boy.'\r\n\r\n    \"That was not correct: I had come to the coronation without a\r\n    marmot, and a marmot is a great resource; I had nothing in my\r\n    box but some old dream or other which no passer-by would have\r\n    paid a sou-piece to see climb up a stick.\r\n\r\n    \"Louis XVII. and Louis XVIII. were not crowned; Charles X.'s\r\n    coronation comes immediately after Louis XVI.'s. Charles X.\r\n    was present at his brother's coronation; he represented the\r\n    Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror. Under what happy\r\n    auspices did not Louis XVI. ascend the throne? How popular\r\n    was he on succeeding Louis XV.! And yet, what did he come to?\r\n    The present coronation will be, not a coronation, but the\r\n    representation of a coronation: we shall see Marshal Moncey,\r\n    an actor in the coronation of Napoleon; that marshal, who\r\n    formerly celebrated in his army the death of the tyrant Louis\r\n    XVI., we shall now see brandishing the royal sword at Rheims,\r\n    in the quality of Count of Flanders or Duke of Aquitaine.\r\n    Who could be taken in by that parade? I would have wished no\r\n    pomp to-day: the King on horseback, the church bare, adorned\r\n    only with its old vaults and its old tombs; the two Chambers\r\n    present, the oath of fidelity to the Charter pronounced aloud\r\n    on the Gospels. There you would have the renewal of the\r\n    Monarchy; they might have recommenced it with liberty and\r\n    religion: unfortunately they had little love for liberty; if\r\n    still they had, at least, had the taste for glory!\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ah! que diront là-bas, sons les tombes poudreuses,\r\n    De tant de vaillants rois les ombres généreuses?\r\n    Que diront Pharamond, Clodion et Clovis,\r\n    Nos Pepins, nos Martels, nos Charles, nos Louis,\r\n    Qui de leur propre sang, à tous périls de guerre,\r\n    Ont acquis à leurs fils une si belle terre[254]?\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Lastly, has not the new coronation, to which the Pope\r\n    came to anoint a man as great as the chief of the Second\r\n    Dynasty[255], in changing the heads, destroyed the effect of\r\n    the ancient ceremony of our history? The people has been led\r\n    to believe that a pious rite dedicated no one to the throne,\r\n    or rendered indifferent the choice of the forehead to which\r\n    the holy oil was applied. The supernumeraries of Notre-Dame\r\n    de Paris, figuring likewise in the Cathedral of Rheims, will\r\n    be nothing more than the necessary characters in a scene that\r\n    has become vulgar: the advantage will remain with Napoleon,\r\n    who sends his walking gentlemen to Charles X. The figure of\r\n    the Emperor dominates everything henceforward. It stands at\r\n    the bottom of events and ideas: the pages of these lower days\r\n    to which we have come shrivel up under the glance of his\r\n    eagles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"RHEIMS, _Saturday, eve of the Coronation._[256]\r\n\r\n    \"I have seen the King's entry; I have seen pass the gilt\r\n    coaches of the monarch who but lately had not a horse to\r\n    ride; I have seen those carriages roll by filled with\r\n    courtiers who were not able to defend their master. This\r\n    herd went to the church to sing the _Te Deum_, and I went\r\n    to look at a Roman ruin and to walk by myself in a wood of\r\n    elm-trees called the 'Wood of Love.' I heard from afar the\r\n    jubilation of the bells, I contemplated the towers of the\r\n    Cathedral, secular witnesses of that ceremony which is always\r\n    the same and yet so different through history, the times,\r\n    ideas, manners, usages and customs. The Monarchy perished,\r\n    and the Cathedral was for some years turned into a stable.\r\n    Does Charles X., who sees it again to-day, remember that he\r\n    saw Louis XVI. anointed in the same place where he is to\r\n    be anointed in his turn? Will he believe that a coronation\r\n    yields protection against misfortune? There is no longer a\r\n    hand virtuous enough to heal the king's evil, no longer a\r\n    sacred phial salutary enough to render kings inviolable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI hurriedly wrote what has just been read on the half-blank pages of a\r\npamphlet entitled, _Le Sacre; par Barnage de Reims, avocat_, and on a\r\nprinted letter of the Grand Referendary, M. de Sémonville[257], saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Grand Referendary has the honour to inform His Lordship,\r\n    Monsieur le Vicomte de Chateaubriand, that places in the\r\n    chancel of Rheims Cathedral are intended and reserved for\r\n    those of Messieurs the Peers who wish to be present to-morrow\r\n    at His Majesty's consecration and coronation, at the ceremony\r\n    of the reception of the Chief and Sovereign Grand Master of\r\n    the Orders of the Holy Ghost and of St. Michael and of the\r\n    reception of Messieurs the Knights and Commanders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles X. nevertheless had intended to conciliate me. The Archbishop\r\nof Paris[258] spoke to him at Rheims of the men in the Opposition; the\r\nKing said:\r\n\r\n\"Those who will have nothing to do with me, I leave alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop rejoined:\r\n\r\n\"But, Sire, M. de Chateaubriand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, him I regret!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coronation of Charles X.]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop asked the King if he might tell me so; the King\r\nhesitated, took two or three turns in the room, and replied, \"Well,\r\nyes, tell him,\" and the Archbishop forgot to speak to me about it.\r\n\r\nAt the ceremony of the knights of the Orders, I was kneeling at the\r\nKing's feet at the moment when M. de Villèle was taking his oath.\r\nI exchanged two or three words of politeness with my companion in\r\nknighthood[259], with regard to a feather that had come loose from my\r\nhat. We left the Sovereign's knees, and all was done. The King, finding\r\na difficulty in removing his gloves to take my hands in his, had said\r\nto me, laughing:\r\n\r\n\"A gloved cat catches no mice.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thought that he had spoken to me at length, and the rumour\r\nwas spread of my return to favour. It is probable that Charles X.,\r\nthinking that the Archbishop had told me of his good-will towards me,\r\nexpected a word of thanks from me and was offended at my silence.\r\n\r\nThus have I assisted at the last coronation of the successors of\r\nClovis; I had occasioned it by the pages in which I had asked for the\r\ncoronation and depicted it in my pamphlet, _Le Roi est mort: vive\r\nle roi!_ Not that I had the least faith in the ceremony; but, as\r\neverything was lacking to the Legitimacy, it was necessary, to sustain\r\nit, to make use of everything, for better or for worse. I recalled\r\nAdalbéron's[260] definition: \"The coronation of a King of France is, a\r\npublic interest, not a private matter;\" I quoted the admirable prayer\r\nset apart for the coronation:\r\n\r\n\"O God, who by Thy virtues counselled Thy peoples, give to this Thy\r\nservant the spirit of Thy wisdom! Let to all men born be in these\r\ndays equity and justice: to friends succour, to enemies hinderance,\r\nto the afflicted consolation, to the lofty correction, to the rich\r\ninstruction, to the needy pity, to pilgrims hospitality, to poor\r\nsubjects peace and safety in the mother-land! Let him learn to command\r\nhimself, moderately to govern each one according to his state, so that,\r\nO Lord, he may give to all the people an example of life pleasing to\r\nThee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore reproducing in my pamphlet, _Le Roi est mort: vive le roi!_ this\r\nprayer preserved by Du Tillet[261], I had exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let us humbly beseech Charles X. to imitate his ancestors:\r\n    thirty-two sovereigns of the Third Dynasty have received the\r\n    royal unction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll my duties being fulfilled, I left Rheims, and was able to say, like\r\nJoan of Arc:\r\n\r\n\"My mission is ended.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: This book was written in 1839 and revised in December\r\n1846.--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Joseph Planta (1787-1847) was secretary to Lord\r\nLondonderry for many years.

The men\r\nwho fought by my side in the _Conservateur_, like myself, demanded\r\nthe restoration of the liberty of the press and the pen; they were\r\nin opposition like myself, in disgrace like myself, and they called\r\nthemselves my friends. On attaining power in 1820, through my labours\r\neven more than their own, they turned against the liberty of the\r\npress: the persecuted became persecutors; they ceased to be and to\r\ncall themselves my friends; they maintained that the license of the\r\npress had begun only on the 6th of June 1824, the day of my dismissal\r\nfrom office; their memory was short: had they re-read the opinions\r\nwhich they pronounced, the articles which they wrote against another\r\nministry and in favour of the liberty of the press, they would have\r\nbeen obliged to acknowledge that they, at least in 1818 or 1819, were\r\nthe submanagers of license.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my former adversaries were drawing closer to me.\r\nI tried to connect the partisans of independence with the Legitimate\r\nRoyalty, with more success than when I rallied the servants of the\r\nthrone and the altar to the Charter. My public had changed. I was\r\nobliged to warn the Government of the dangers of absolutism, after\r\nhaving cautioned it against popular enthusiasm. Accustomed as I was to\r\nrespect my readers, I did not give them a line which I had not written\r\nwith all the care of which I was capable: many of those opuscules of\r\na day have cost me more pains, in proportion, than the longest works\r\nthat have come from my pen. My life was incredibly full. Honour and\r\nmy country recalled me to the battle-field. I had reached an age at\r\nwhich men have need of rest; but, if I had judged my years by the\r\never-increasing hatred with which oppression and meanness inspired me,\r\nI might have believed myself restored to youth.\r\n\r\nI collected a society of writers around me to give uniformity to my\r\ncombats. Among them were peers, deputies, magistrates, young authors\r\ncommencing their career. To my house came Messieurs de Montalivet[263],\r\nSalvandy[264], Duvergier de Hauranne[265], many others who were my\r\npupils and who retail to-day, as new things under the Representative\r\nMonarchy, things which I taught them and which occur on every page of\r\nmy writings. M. de Montalivet has become Minister of the Interior and\r\na favourite of Philip's; men who care to follow the variations of a\r\ndestiny will find this note rather curious:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to send you the statement of the mistakes\r\n    which I found in the table of judgments of the Royal Court\r\n    that has been communicated to you. I have verified them\r\n    again, and I think I may answer for the correctness of the\r\n    list enclosed.\r\n\r\n    \"Pray, monsieur le vicomte, accept the homage of the profound\r\n    respect with which I have the honour to be,\r\n\r\n    \"Your very devoted colleague and sincere admirer,\r\n\r\n    \"MONTALIVET.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis did not prevent my \"respectful colleague and sincere admirer,\" M.\r\nle Comte de Montalivet, in his day so great a partisan of the liberty\r\nof the press, from making me, as an abettor of that liberty, enter M.\r\nGisquet's[266] prison.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of my new war of polemics, which lasted five years but\r\nended by triumphing, will prove the strength of ideas against facts\r\neven when supported by the power. I was thrown on the 6th of June 1824;\r\non the 21st, I had descended into the arena; I remained there till the\r\n18th of December 1826[267]: I entered alone, stripped and bare, and I\r\nemerged victorious. I am making history here in making an extract from\r\nthe arguments which I employed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My polemical warfare.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We have had the courage and the honour to wage a dangerous\r\n    war in presence of the liberty of the press, and it was\r\n    the first time that this noble spectacle was given to the\r\n    monarchy. We soon repented of our honesty. We had set the\r\n    newspapers at naught when they could injure only the success\r\n    of our soldiers and our captains; it became necessary to\r\n    reduce them to servitude when they dared to speak of the\r\n    clerks and ministers....\r\n\r\n    \"If those who administer the State seem completely ignorant\r\n    of the genius of France in serious matters, they are no less\r\n    foreign to it in those graceful and ornamental matters which\r\n    are mingled with and beautify the life of civilized nations.\r\n\r\n    \"The bounties which the Legitimate Government lavishes upon\r\n    the arts surpass the aids awarded to them by the Usurping\r\n    Government; but how are they dispensed? Vowed by nature and\r\n    taste to oblivion, the distributors of those bounties seem\r\n    to have an antipathy to renown; so invincible is their\r\n    obscurity that, when they approach lights, they make them\r\n    turn pale; one would say that they pour money on the arts to\r\n    extinguish them, as on our liberties to stifle them...[268]\r\n\r\n    \"If even the narrow mechanism within which France is pinched\r\n    resembled those finished models which one examines through\r\n    the magnifying-glass in the collector's cabinet, the delicacy\r\n    of that curiosity might interest one for a moment; but not at\r\n    all: it is a small thing badly constructed.\r\n\r\n    \"We have said that the system followed nowadays by the\r\n    administration offends against the genius of France: we\r\n    will try to prove that it also disregards the spirit of our\r\n    institutions.\r\n\r\n    \"The Monarchy has been restored in France without effort,\r\n    because it has the strength of our whole history, because the\r\n    crown is worn by a family which has almost seen the nation\r\n    born, which has formed it, civilized it, which has given it\r\n    all its liberties, which has made it immortal; but time has\r\n    reduced that monarchy to its realities. The age of fictions\r\n    in politics is past: one can no longer have a government of\r\n    adoration, of cult and of mystery; each one knows his rights;\r\n    nothing is possible without the limits of reason; and,\r\n    down to favour, the last illusion of absolute monarchies,\r\n    everything is weighed, everything valued to-day.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us make no mistake; a new era is commencing for the\r\n    nations; will it be a happier one? Providence knows. As for\r\n    us, it is given to us only to prepare ourselves for the\r\n    exigencies of the future. Let us not imagine that we can go\r\n    back: our only safety lies in the Charter.\r\n\r\n    \"The Constitutional Monarchy was not born among us of a\r\n    written system, even though it has a printed Code; it is the\r\n    daughter of time and of events, like the Old Monarchy of our\r\n    fathers.\r\n\r\n    \"Why should not liberty maintain herself in the edifice\r\n    raised by despotism and filled with its traces? Victory,\r\n    still so to speak decked with the three colours, has taken\r\n    refuge in the tent of the Duc d'Angoulême; the Legitimacy\r\n    inhabits the Louvre, even though the eagles be still seen\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n    \"In a constitutional monarchy, the public liberties are\r\n    respected; they are considered as the safeguard of the\r\n    Sovereign, the people and the laws.\r\n\r\n    \"We understand representative government otherwise. A company\r\n    is being formed (they say even two rival companies, for\r\n    competition is needful) to corrupt the newspapers with\r\n    bribes of money. They are not afraid to maintain scandalous\r\n    prosecutions against proprietors who have refused to sell\r\n    themselves; they would like to force them to be stigmatized\r\n    by the sentence of the tribunals. This trade being repugnant\r\n    to men of honour, they enlist, to support a Royalist\r\n    ministry, libellers who have persecuted the Royal Family\r\n    with their calumnies. They recruit all who served in the\r\n    former police and in the imperial ante-chamber, even as our\r\n    neighbours, when they wish to procure sailors, send the\r\n    press-gang into the taverns and disorderly houses. Those\r\n    convict-crews of free writers are embarked on five or six\r\n    bought newspapers, and what they say is called 'public\r\n    opinion' at the Ministers[269]'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere, very greatly abridged, and still perhaps at too great length, is\r\na specimen of my polemical warfare in my pamphlets and in the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_: in it will be found all the principles that are being\r\nproclaimed to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: I refuse my pension.]\r\n\r\nWhen I was turned out of the ministry, my pension as a minister of\r\nState was not restored to me; I did not claim it; but M. de Villèle,\r\nupon an observation of the King's, thought of sending me a new warrant\r\nfor that pension through M. de Peyronnet[270]. I refused it. Either I\r\nwas entitled to my former pension, or else I was not entitled to it: in\r\nthe first case I had no need for a new warrant; in the second, I did\r\nnot wish to become the pensioner of the President of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenes threw off the yoke: a Greek Committee was formed in\r\nParis, of which I was a member. The committee came together at M.\r\nTernaux'[271] on the Place des Victoires. The members used to arrive\r\none after the other at the meeting-place. M. le Général Sébastiani\r\ndeclared, when he had sat down, that it was a \"big affair;\" he made it\r\na long one: this displeased our practical chairman, M. Ternaux, who\r\nwould certainly have made a shawl for Aspasia, but who would not have\r\nwasted his time with her. The committee suffered from the dispatches\r\nof M. Fabvier; he scolded us roundly; he held us responsible for\r\nwhatever did not go according to his views, us, who had not won the\r\nBattle of Marathon. I devoted myself to the liberty of Greece: it\r\nseemed to me that I was fulfilling a duty towards a mother. I wrote a\r\n_Note_; I addressed myself to the successors of the Tsar of Russia, as\r\nI had addressed myself to him at Verona. The _Note_ was printed and\r\nsubsequently reprinted at the head of the _Itinéraire._\r\n\r\nI laboured to the same purpose in the House of Peers, to set a\r\npolitical body going. The following note from M. Molé shows the\r\nobstacles which I encountered and the circuitous methods which I was\r\nobliged to employ:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"You will find us all at the opening to-morrow, ready to fly\r\n    in your footsteps: I shall write to Lainé if I do not see\r\n    him. He must be allowed only to expect a few sentences about\r\n    the Greeks; but take care that you are not kept strictly\r\n    within the limits of all amendments, and that, relying on\r\n    the rules, they do not refuse to hear you. Perhaps they will\r\n    tell you to lay your motion on the table: you might then do\r\n    so subsidiarily and after having said all that you have to\r\n    say. Pasquier has been rather unwell, and I fear that he will\r\n    not be on his legs by to-morrow. As for the ballot, we shall\r\n    have it. What is worth more than all this is the arrangement\r\n    which you have made with your publishers. It is a fine thing\r\n    to recover by one's talent all that which the injustice and\r\n    ingratitude of men have taken from us.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours while life lasts,\r\n\r\n    \"MOLÉ.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreece has become free from the yoke of Islamism; but, instead of a\r\nfederal republic, as I wished, a Bavarian monarchy[272] has been set\r\nup at Athens. Now, as kings have no memory, I, who had in some small\r\nway served the cause of the Greeks, have not heard speak of them since,\r\nexcept in Homer. Greece delivered has not said, \"Thank you\" to me. She\r\nis as ignorant of my name and more so than on the day when I wept on\r\nher ruins when crossing her deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHellas, not yet royal, had been more grateful. Among a few children\r\nwhom the committee brought up was young Canaris: his father[273], a\r\nworthy descendant of the sailors of Mycale[274], wrote him a note which\r\nthe child translated into French on the blank space at foot. Here is\r\nthe translation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR CHILD,\r\n\r\n    \"None of the Greeks has had the same good fortune as\r\n    yourself: that of being selected by the benevolent society\r\n    which interests itself in us to learn the duties of man.

Madame Récamier wrote to me from Naples, on the 29th of\r\nOctober 1824:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have received a letter from Greece which has made a long\r\n    round before reaching me. In it I find some lines on yourself\r\n    which I want you to see; here they are:\r\n\r\n    \"'The decree of the 6th of June has come to our ears; it\r\n    has produced the liveliest sensation on our leaders. Their\r\n    best-founded hopes lying in the generosity of France, they\r\n    are anxiously asking themselves what the removal may forebode\r\n    of a man whose character promised them a support.'\r\n\r\n    \"If I am not mistaken, this testimony ought to please you. I\r\n    enclose the letter: the first page concerned only myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon you will read the life of Madame Récamier: you will know how sweet\r\nit was to me to receive a remembrance of the land of the Muses through\r\na woman who would have adorned it.\r\n\r\nAs for the note from M. Molé, given above, it alludes to the bargain\r\nwhich I had made relating to the publication of my Complete Works.\r\nThis arrangement ought, in fact, to have ensured the peace of my life;\r\nit nevertheless turned badly for me, although it was profitable to\r\nthe publishers to whom M. Ladvocat, after his bankruptcy, left my\r\nWorks[275]. In point of Plutus or Pluto (the mythologists confound the\r\ntwo), I am like Alcestes: I always see the fatal bark; like William\r\nPitt, and that is my excuse, I am a spendthrift, a _panier percé_: but\r\nI do not myself make the hole in the basket.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the General Preface to my Works, 1826, vol. I., I\r\naddress France in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O France, 'my dear country and my first love,' one of thy\r\n    sons, at the end of his career, is collecting beneath thy\r\n    eyes the claims which he may have to thy good-will. If he can\r\n    do no more for thee, thou canst do all for him, by declaring\r\n    that his attachment for thy religion, for thy King, for thy\r\n    liberties has been pleasing to thee. Fair and illustrious\r\n    mother-land, I would have desired a little glory only to\r\n    augment thine own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Chateaubriand, being ill, made a journey in the South of\r\nFrance, derived no benefit from it, and returned to Lyons, where\r\nDr. Prunelle[276] condemned her. I went to join her; I took her to\r\nLausanne, where she proved M. Prunelle in the wrong. At Lausanne\r\nI stayed in turn with M. de Sivry and with Madame de Cottens, a\r\nwarm-hearted, witty and unhappy woman. I saw Madame de Montolieu[277]:\r\nshe was living in retirement on a high hill; she died in the illusions\r\nof romance, like Madame de Genlis, her contemporary. Gibbon[278] had\r\ncomposed his History of the Roman Empire:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"It was ... as I sat musing among the ruins of the Capitol,\"\r\n    he writes at Lausanne, on the 27th of June 1787, \"while the\r\n    barefooted friars were singing vespers in the temple of\r\n    Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the\r\n    city first started to my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Madame de Custine.]\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël had appeared at Lausanne with Madame Récamier. The\r\nwhole Emigration, a whole finished world had stopped for some short\r\nmoments in that sad and smiling town, a sort of false city of Granada.\r\nMadame de Duras has recalled its memory in her Memoirs, and the\r\nfollowing note reached me there to tell me of the new loss which I was\r\ncondemned to suffer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"BEX, 13 _July_ 1826.\r\n\r\n    \"It is all over, monsieur, your friend[279] exists no more;\r\n    she gave up her soul to God, without pain, at a quarter to\r\n    eleven this morning. She was out driving as late as yesterday\r\n    evening. Nothing announced her end to be so near; what am I\r\n    saying? we did not think that her illness was to end in this\r\n    way. M. de Custine[280], whose sorrow does not permit him to\r\n    write to you himself, had been on one of the mountains around\r\n    Bex only yesterday morning, to order mountain-milk to be sent\r\n    down every morning for the dear sufferer.\r\n\r\n    \"I am too much overcome with grief to be able to enter into\r\n    longer details. We are getting ready to return to France with\r\n    the precious remains of the best of mothers and friends.\r\n    Enguerrand[281] will lie at rest between his two mothers.\r\n\r\n    \"We shall pass through Lausanne, where M. de Custine will\r\n    come to see you so soon as we arrive.\r\n\r\n    \"Receive, monsieur, the assurance of the respectful\r\n    attachment with which I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"BERSTŒCHER[282].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSee above and below what I have had the happiness and the unhappiness\r\nto recall touching the memory of Madame de Custine.\r\n\r\nMadame de Charrière's work, the _Lettres écrites de Lausanne_, well\r\ndescribes the scene which I had daily before my eyes, and the feelings\r\nof grandeur which it inspires:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I am sitting alone,\" says the mother of Cécile, \"opposite to\r\n    a window which looks upon the lake. I am grateful to you, ye\r\n    mountains, snow, and sun, for the pleasure which you afford\r\n    me. Above all, I am grateful to Thee, Thou Author of all the\r\n    things which I contemplate, for having created objects so\r\n    lovely to the sight.... O ye amiable and affecting beauties\r\n    of nature! My eyes are daily employed in contemplating you,\r\n    and ye fill my heart with perpetual rapture[283].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne I commenced the _Remarques_ on the first work of my life,\r\nthe _Essai sur les révolutions anciennes et modernes._ From my windows\r\nI saw the rocks of Meillerie:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Rousseau,\" I wrote in one of those _Remarques_, \"is\r\n    decidedly not above the authors of his time, except in some\r\n    sixty letters of the _Nouvelle Héloïse_ and in a few pages of\r\n    his _Rêveries_ and of his _Confessions._ There, placed in the\r\n    real nature of his talent, he attains an eloquence of passion\r\n    unknown before him. Voltaire and Montesquieu found models\r\n    of style in the writers of the age of Louis XIV.; Rousseau,\r\n    and even Buffon to some extent, in another manner, created a\r\n    language which was unknown to the Grand Century[284].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to Paris, my life was occupied between my installation in\r\nthe Rue d'Enfer, my renewed combats, in the House of Peers and in my\r\npamphlets, against the different Bills opposed to the public liberties,\r\nmy speeches and writings in favour of the Greeks, and my labours in\r\nconnection with the complete edition of my Works. The Emperor of Russia\r\ndied[285], and with him died the only royal friendship remaining to\r\nme. The Duc de Montmorency had become governor to the Duc de Bordeaux.\r\nHe did not long enjoy that weighty honour: he expired on Good Friday\r\n1826[286], in the Church of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin; at the hour when\r\nJesus expired on the Cross, he went with Christ's last sigh to God.\r\n\r\nThe attack against the Jesuits had begun; one heard the trite and\r\nthreadbare accusations against that famous Order, in which, it must be\r\nadmitted, reigns something disquieting, for a mysterious cloud always\r\ncovers the affairs of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from M. de Montlosier.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Jesuits, I received the following letter from M.\r\nde Montlosier, and I sent him the reply which will be read after the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Forsake not an old friend, for the new will not be like to\r\n    him.--ECCLES[287].\r\n\r\n    \"My dear friend, these words are not only of a high\r\n    antiquity, they are not only of a high wisdom; for the\r\n    Christian they are sacred. In addressing you, I invoke all\r\n    the authority that they possess. Never among old friends,\r\n    never among good citizens, has the need for drawing together\r\n    been greater. To dose up the ranks, to close up all the bonds\r\n    between us, to excite with emulation all our wishes, all\r\n    our efforts, all our sentiments is a duty commanded by the\r\n    eminently deplorable state of king and country. In addressing\r\n    these words to you, I know that they will be received by a\r\n    heart which has been rent by ingratitude and injustice; and\r\n    yet I still address them to you with confidence, certain as\r\n    I am that they will make their way through all the clouds.\r\n    In this delicate point, I do not know, my dear friend, if\r\n    you will be pleased with me; but, in the midst of your\r\n    tribulations, if perchance I have heard you accused, I have\r\n    not made it my business to defend you: I have not even\r\n    listened. I have said to myself, 'And if it were so?' I do\r\n    not know that Alcibiades did not display a little too much\r\n    humour when he put out of his own house the rhetorician who\r\n    could not show him the works of Homer. I do not know that\r\n    Hannibal did not display a little too much violence when\r\n    he threw from his seat the senator who was talking against\r\n    his opinion. If I were allowed to tell my way of thinking\r\n    of Achilles, perhaps I should not approve of his leaving\r\n    the army of the Greeks for some chit of a girl who had been\r\n    carried off from him. After that, it is enough to pronounce\r\n    the names of Alcibiades, Hannibal and Achilles to put an end\r\n    to all contention. It is the same to-day with the _iracundus,\r\n    inexorabilis_ Chateaubriand. When one has pronounced his\r\n    name, all is said and done. With that name, when I say to\r\n    myself, 'He is complaining,' I feel my affection moved; when\r\n    I say to myself, 'France is indebted to him,' I feel myself\r\n    penetrated with respect. Yes, my friend, France is indebted\r\n    to you. She must be indebted to you still further; she has\r\n    recovered from you her love for the religion of her fathers:\r\n    this benefit must be preserved to her; and for that, she must\r\n    be preserved from the mistakes of her priests, those priests\r\n    themselves preserved from the fatal declivity on which they\r\n    have placed themselves.\r\n\r\n    \"My dear friend, you and I, for long years, have not ceased\r\n    fighting. It remains to us to preserve the King and the State\r\n    from ecclesiastical, self-styled religious preponderance.\r\n    In the old situations, the evil with its roots lay within\r\n    ourselves: we could circumvent and master them. To-day the\r\n    branches which cover us within have their roots without.\r\n    Doctrines covered with the blood of Louis XVI. and Charles I.\r\n    have consented to leave their place to doctrines stained with\r\n    the blood of Henry IV. and Henry III. Neither you nor I will\r\n    surely suffer this state of things; it is to unite with you,\r\n    it is to receive your approval for my encouragement, it is to\r\n    offer you as a soldier my heart and my arms, that I write to\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    \"It is with these sentiments of admiration for yourself and\r\n    of a true devotion, that I implore you with affection and\r\n    also with respect.\r\n\r\n    \"COMTE DE MONTLOSIER.\r\n\r\n    \"RANDANNE, 28 _November_ 1825.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My reply to M. de Montlosier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 3 _December_ 1825.\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter, my dear old friend, is very serious, and yet it\r\n    has made me laugh where I am concerned. Alcibiades, Hannibal,\r\n    Achilles! You do not say all that to me seriously. As to the\r\n    chit of a girl of the son of Peleus, if it is my portfolio\r\n    that is in question, I protest to you that I did not love the\r\n    faithless one for three days, and that I did not regret her\r\n    for a quarter of an hour. My resentment is another matter.\r\n    M. de Villèle, to whom I was sincerely, heartily attached,\r\n    has not only been lacking towards the duties of friendship,\r\n    towards the public marks of affection which I gave him,\r\n    towards the sacrifices which I had made for him, but even in\r\n    the simplest matters of conduct.\r\n\r\n    \"The King had no further need of my services: nothing more\r\n    natural than to remove me from his counsels; but manner is\r\n    everything to an honest man and, as I had not stolen the\r\n    King's watch from his mantel-piece, I ought not to have been\r\n    _turned out_ as I was. I had made the Spanish War alone and\r\n    kept Europe in peace during that dangerous period; by that\r\n    single fact I had given an army to the Legitimacy and, of\r\n    all the ministers of the Restoration, I was the only one\r\n    thrust out of my office without any mark of remembrance\r\n    from the Crown, as though I had betrayed the Sovereign and\r\n    the country. M. de Villèle thought that I would accept that\r\n    treatment, and he has made a mistake. I have been a sincere\r\n    friend, I shall remain an irreconcilable enemy. I was\r\n    unluckily born; the injuries people do me never heal.\r\n\r\n    \"But this is too much about myself: let us speak of\r\n    something more important. I fear lest I should not come to\r\n    an understanding with you on serious objects, and that would\r\n    distress me greatly! I want the Charter, the whole Charter,\r\n    the public liberties to their full extent. Do you want them?\r\n\r\n    \"I want religion, like yourself; like you, I hate the\r\n    Congregation and those societies of hypocrites who transform\r\n    my servants into spies and who seek nothing at the altar but\r\n    power. But I think that the clergy, rid of those parasites,\r\n    may very well enter into a constitutional system and even\r\n    become the stay of our new institutions. Do you not wish\r\n    too much to separate it from the political order? Here I am\r\n    giving you a proof of my extreme impartiality. The clergy,\r\n    which, I venture to say, owes me so much, does not love me\r\n    at all, has never defended me nor rendered me any service.\r\n    But what matter? It is a question of being just and of seeing\r\n    what is good for religion and the monarchy.\r\n\r\n    \"I did not, old friend, doubt your courage; you will, I am\r\n    convinced, do all that will appear to you to be useful, and\r\n    your talent answers for your triumph. I shall expect to hear\r\n    from you again, and I embrace my faithful companion in exile\r\n    with all my heart.\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI resumed my controversies. Every day I had skirmishes and van-guard\r\nactions with the soldiers of the ministerial hangers-on; they did not\r\nalways fight with clean weapons. In the two first centuries of Rome,\r\nthey punished the horse-soldiers who rode badly to the charge, whether\r\nbecause they were too stout or not brave enough, by condemning them to\r\nundergo a bleeding: I made the chastisement my affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The universe is changing around us,\" I said: \"new peoples\r\n    are appearing upon the world's scene, ancient peoples are\r\n    rising again in the midst of ruins; astonishing discoveries\r\n    proclaim an approaching revolution in the arts of peace\r\n    and war: religion, politics, manners, all is assuming a\r\n    different character. Do we take notice of that movement? Are\r\n    we marching with society? Are we following the course of the\r\n    time? Are we preparing to keep our place in a transmuted or\r\n    growing civilization? No: the men who rule us are as foreign\r\n    to the state of things in Europe as though they belonged to\r\n    the people lately discovered in the interior of Africa. What\r\n    do they know then? The stock-exchange: and even that they\r\n    know badly. Are we condemned to bear the burden of obscurity\r\n    to punish us for having undergone the yoke of glory[288]?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transaction relating to San Domingo furnished me with the occasion\r\nto develop some points of our public right, of which no one was\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nComing to high considerations and announcing the transformation of\r\nthe world, I replied to opponents who had said to me, \"What! we might\r\nbe Republicans some day? Senseless chatter! Who dreams of a republic\r\nnowadays?\" etc. etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Attached by reason to the monarchical order of things,\"\r\n    I rejoined, \"I regard constitutional monarchy as the best\r\n    possible government at this epoch of society.\r\n\r\n    \"But, if they want to reduce everything to personal\r\n    interests, if they suppose that, for myself, I think I might\r\n    have everything to fear in a Republican State, they are\r\n    mistaken.\r\n\r\n    \"Would it treat me worse than the Monarchy has treated me?\r\n    Twice or three times have I been stripped bare for or by the\r\n    Monarchy: did the Empire, which would have done everything\r\n    for me had I been willing, disown me more rudely? I abhor\r\n    servitude; liberty pleases my natural independence; I prefer\r\n    that liberty in the monarchical order, but I can conceive it\r\n    in the popular order of things. Who has less to fear from the\r\n    future than I? I have that which no revolution can take from\r\n    me: without place, honours, or fortune, any government which\r\n    would not be stupid enough to disdain public opinion would\r\n    be obliged to reckon me for something. Popular governments,\r\n    above all, are composed of individual existences and make for\r\n    themselves a general value out of the particular value of\r\n    every citizen. I shall always be certain of the esteem of the\r\n    public, because I shall never do anything to lose it, and I\r\n    should perhaps find more justice among my enemies than among\r\n    my pretended friends.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, on computation, I should have no fear of\r\n    republics, as I should have no antipathy to liberty; I am not\r\n    a king; I await no crown; it is not my own cause that I plead.\r\n\r\n    \"I have said under another ministry, and speaking of that\r\n    ministry, that one morning we should go to the window to see\r\n    the Monarchy pass.\r\n\r\n    \"I say to the actual ministers:\r\n\r\n    \"'If you continue to do as you are doing, the whole\r\n    revolution might, within a given time, reduce itself to\r\n    _a new edition of the Charter in which they would content\r\n    themselves with changing only two or three words._[289]\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have underlined these last phrases to attract the reader's eyes\r\nto that striking prediction. Even to-day, when opinions are in full\r\nflight, when every man utters at random all that passes through his\r\nbrain, those Republican ideas expressed by a Royalist during the\r\nRestoration still sound daring. In point of the future, the pretended\r\nprogressive minds have no initiative in anything.\r\n\r\nMy last articles stirred up even M. de La Fayette, who, by way of\r\ncompliment, had a bay-leaf handed to me. The effect of my opinions, to\r\nthe great surprise of those who had not believed in them, made itself\r\nfelt from the book-sellers, who came to me in a deputation, to the\r\nparliament-men at first least allied to me in politics. The letter\r\ngiven below in proof of what I am putting forward will cause a certain\r\nsurprise because of its signature. Attention should be given only to\r\nthe significance of the letter, to the change which had occurred in\r\nthe ideas and position of the writer and the recipient: as to its\r\ncomposition, I am \"Bossuet\" and \"Montesquieu,\" that goes without\r\nsaying; that is the daily bread of us authors, just as ministers are\r\nalways Sully and Colbert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from General Sébastiani.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"Permit me to participate in the universal admiration: I have\r\n    too long entertained this sentiment to resist the need of\r\n    expressing it to you.\r\n\r\n    \"You unite the loftiness of Bossuet with the profundity of\r\n    Montesquieu: you have revived their pen and their genius.\r\n    Your articles are a great education to any statesman.\r\n\r\n    \"In the new method of warfare which you have created, you\r\n    recall the mighty hand of him who, in other fights, also\r\n    filled the world with his glory.

All the pusillanimous and ambitious spirits who had believed\r\nme lost began to see me come forth beaming from the whirlwinds of dust\r\nin the lists: it was my second Spanish War; I was triumphing over all\r\nparties at home as I had triumphed over France's enemies abroad. I\r\nhad had to discharge my duty in person, in the same way as, with my\r\ndispatches, I had paralyzed and rendered useless the dispatches of M.\r\nde Metternich and Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Foy[290] and the deputy Manuel[291] died and deprived the\r\nOpposition of the Left of its best speakers. M. de Serre[292] and\r\nCamille Jordan[293] also sank into the tomb. Even in my arm-chair at\r\nthe Academy, I was obliged to defend the liberty of the press against\r\nthe tearful supplications of M. de Lally-Tolendal[294]. The law on\r\nthe police of the press, which was called the \"Law of Justice and\r\nLove[295],\" owed its fall chiefly to my attacks. My _Opinion_ on this\r\nbill is a work of historical curiosity; I received compliments on it;\r\namong them occur two names which it is strange to recall:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"I appreciate the thanks which you are kind enough to address\r\n    to me.

I am glad to add my feeble efforts to your powerful\r\n    influence; and the frenzy of a ministry which plagues France\r\n    and would like to degrade it, while disquieting me as to\r\n    its approaching results, gives me the consoling assurance\r\n    that such a state of things cannot last long. You will\r\n    have powerfully contributed to put an end to it; and, if I\r\n    deserve some day that my name be placed far after yours in\r\n    the struggle which we must maintain against so much folly and\r\n    crime, I shall consider myself amply rewarded.\r\n\r\n    \"Accept, monsieur, the homage of a sincere admiration, of a\r\n    profound esteem and of the highest regard.\r\n\r\n    \"BENJAMIN CONSTANT.\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 21 _May_ 1827.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the time of which I am speaking that I attained the highest\r\npitch of my political importance. Through the Spanish War, I had\r\nswayed Europe; but a violent opposition was fighting against me in\r\nFrance. After my fall, I became, at home, the acknowledged ruler of\r\npublic opinion. Those who had accused me of committing an irreparable\r\nfault in resuming my pen were obliged to recognise that I had formed\r\nfor myself an empire mightier than the first. Young France had come\r\nover in its entirety to my side and has not left me since. In several\r\nof the industrial classes, the workmen were at my orders, and I could\r\nno longer take a step in the streets without being surrounded. Whence\r\ncame this popularity? From the fact that I knew the real spirit of\r\nFrance. I had set out for the combat with one newspaper, and I had\r\nbecome the master of all the rest. My daring came to me from my\r\nindifference: as it would have been all one to me had I failed, I\r\nadvanced towards success without troubling lest I fell on the way. All\r\nthat remains to me is this satisfaction with myself; for what matters\r\nto anybody, to-day, a past popularity which has rightly been effaced\r\nfrom the memory of all?\r\n\r\nThe King's saint's-day[296] having arrived, I took occasion of it to\r\nblaze forth a loyalty which my Liberal opinions have never impaired. I\r\npublished this article:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Another royal truce!\r\n\r\n    \"Peace to-day to the ministers!\r\n\r\n    \"Glory, honour, long happiness and long life to Charles X.!\r\n    It is St. Charles's Day!\r\n\r\n    \"It is we above all, the old companions in exile of our\r\n    Monarch, who should be asked to tell the history of Charles X.\r\n\r\n    \"You others, Frenchmen who have not been forced to leave your\r\n    country, you who received one Frenchman the more only to\r\n    escape imperial despotism and the foreign yoke, inhabitants\r\n    of the great and good town who have seen only the happy\r\n    Prince: when you crowded round him, on the 12th of April\r\n    1814; when, weeping with emotion, you touched consecrated\r\n    hands; when, on a brow ennobled by age and misfortune, you\r\n    found again all the graces of youth, as one sees beauty\r\n    through a veil, you perceived only virtue triumphant, and you\r\n    led the son of kings to the royal couch of his fathers.\r\n\r\n    \"But we, we have seen him sleep on the bare ground, like\r\n    ourselves homeless, like ourselves outlawed and despoiled.\r\n    Well, the goodness which charms you was the same; he wore\r\n    misfortune as he wears the crown to-day, without finding the\r\n    burden too heavy, with that Christian mildness which tempered\r\n    the vividness of his misfortune as it softens the vividness\r\n    of his prosperity.\r\n\r\n    \"To the bounties of Charles X. must be added all the bounties\r\n    with which his ancestors loaded us; the feast of a Most\r\n    Christian King is for the French a feast of gratitude:\r\n    let us therefore give way to the transports of grateful\r\n    acknowledgment with which it should inspire us. Let us allow\r\n    nothing to enter our souls that can for a moment render our\r\n    joy less pure! Woe to the men...! We were about to violate\r\n    the truce! God save the King[297]!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Article in praise of Charles X.]\r\n\r\nMy eyes have filled with tears while copying this page of my\r\ncontroversy, and I have not the courage to continue making extracts\r\nfrom it. O my King, you whom I had seen on foreign soil, I have\r\nseen you again on that same soil where you were about to die! When\r\nI was fighting for you so eagerly, to snatch you from hands which\r\nwere beginning to undo you, judge, by the words which I have just\r\ntranscribed, if I was your enemy or, rather, the fondest and sincerest\r\nof your servants! Alas, I speak to you, and you no longer hear me!\r\n\r\nThe Bill relating to the police of the press having been withdrawn,\r\nParis was illuminated at night. I was struck by the public\r\nmanifestation, an evil prognostication for the Monarchy: the opposition\r\nhad passed into the people, and the people, by its character,\r\ntransforms the opposition into a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe hatred of M. de Villèle went on increasing; the Royalists, as at\r\nthe time of the _Conservateur_, had become Constitutionalists again, at\r\nthe back of me. M. Michaud[298] wrote to me:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MY HONORABLE MASTER,\r\n\r\n    \"I had the announcement of your work on the censorship\r\n    printed yesterday, but the paragraph, consisting of\r\n    two lines, was struck out by messieurs the censors. M.\r\n    Capefigue[299] will explain to you why we have not left\r\n    blanks or dots.\r\n\r\n    \"If God does not come to our aid, all is lost; the Royalty\r\n    is like unhappy Jerusalem in the hands of the Turks: its\r\n    children can hardly approach it; to what a cause have we then\r\n    sacrificed ourselves!\r\n\r\n    \"MICHAUD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Opposition had at last communicated irascibility to the cold\r\ntemperament of M. de Villèle and rendered despotic the malevolent\r\nspirit of M. de Corbière. The latter had removed the Duc de\r\nLiancourt[300] from seventeen unpaid offices. The Duc de Liancourt was\r\nnot a saint, but he was a benevolent man, upon whom philanthropy had\r\nbestowed the title of venerable; by the softening influence of Time,\r\nold Revolutionaries no longer move except with an epithet, like the\r\ngods in Homer: it is always the respectable M. This, it is always the\r\ninflexible Citizen That, who, like Achilles, has never eaten broth\r\n(ἃ-χὺλος). On the occasion of the scandal that happened at M. de\r\nLiancourt's funeral, M. de Sémonville[301] said to us, in the Chamber\r\nof Peers:\r\n\r\n\"Be easy, my lords, such a thing shall never happen again; I will\r\nmyself conduct you to your last resting-place.\"\r\n\r\nThe King, in the month of April 1827, proposed to review the National\r\nGuard on the Champ de Mars[302]. Two days before this fatal review,\r\nprompted by my zeal, and asking no better than to lay down my arms,\r\nI addressed a letter to Charles X., which was handed to him by M. de\r\nBlacas, who acknowledged its receipt by this note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I did not lose a single moment, monsieur le vicomte, in\r\n    handing the King the letter which you did me the honour to\r\n    send me for His Majesty and, if he deigns to entrust me with\r\n    a reply, I shall show no less alacrity in forwarding it to\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n    \"Receive, monsieur le vicomte, my most sincere compliments.\r\n\r\n    \"BLACAS D'AULPS.\r\n\r\n    \"27 _April_, 1 P.M.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My letter to the King.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO THE KING\r\n\r\n    \"SIRE,\r\n\r\n    \"Permit a loyal subject, whom moments of agitation will\r\n    always find at the foot of the throne, to confide to Your\r\n    Majesty a few reflections which he thinks useful both to the\r\n    glory of the Crown and the happiness and safety of the King.\r\n\r\n    \"Sire, it is but too true, there is danger within the State,\r\n    but it is also certain that this danger is nothing if the\r\n    very principles of government be not thwarted.\r\n\r\n    \"A great secret has been revealed to me, Sire: your ministers\r\n    have had the misfortune to teach France that the people,\r\n    which was said no longer to _exist_, is still quite alive.\r\n    Paris, during twice twenty-four hours, has evaded authority.\r\n    The same scenes are being repeated throughout France: the\r\n    factions will not forget this attempt.\r\n\r\n    \"But popular assemblages, so dangerous under absolute\r\n    monarchies, because they take place in presence of the\r\n    Sovereign himself, mean little under the representative\r\n    monarchy, because they come into contact only with ministers\r\n    or laws. Between the monarch and the subjects is fixed a\r\n    barrier that stops everything: the two Chambers and the\r\n    public institutions. Outside these movements, the King always\r\n    finds his authority and his sacred Person sheltered.\r\n\r\n    \"But, Sire, there is one condition indispensable to the\r\n    general safety, and that is to act in the spirit of the\r\n    institutions: a resistance on the part of your Council to\r\n    that spirit would make popular movements as dangerous under\r\n    the representatative monarchy as they are under the absolute\r\n    monarchy.\r\n\r\n    \"I pass from theory to application:\r\n\r\n    \"Your Majesty is about to appear at the review: you will be\r\n    received as you should; but it is possible that, amid the\r\n    cries of 'God Save the King!' you will hear other cries which\r\n    will express the public opinion of the ministers.\r\n\r\n    \"Furthermore, Sire, it is false to say, as they do, that\r\n    there is a Republican faction at present; but it is true\r\n    that there are some partisans of an illegitimate monarchy:\r\n    now the latter are too clever not to avail themselves of the\r\n    opportunity and mingle their voices, on the 29th, with that\r\n    of France to impose upon the public.\r\n\r\n    \"What will the King do? Will he yield his ministers to the\r\n    popular clamour? That would be to kill the power. Will the\r\n    King keep his ministers? Those ministers will make all the\r\n    unpopularity that pursues them fall upon the head of their\r\n    august master. I am well aware that the King would have the\r\n    courage to burden himself with a personal sorrow to avoid\r\n    harm befalling the Monarchy; but it is possible, by the\r\n    simplest means, to avoid these calamities; permit me, Sire,\r\n    to tell it to you: it is possible by remaining within the\r\n    spirit of our institutions; the ministers have lost their\r\n    majority in the House of Peers and in the nation, the natural\r\n    consequences of that critical position is their resignation.\r\n    How, with a sense of their duty, could they persist, by\r\n    remaining in power, in compromising the Crown? By laying\r\n    their resignation at the feet of your Majesty they will calm\r\n    everything, they will end everything; it is no longer the\r\n    King who yields, it is the ministers who resign in accordance\r\n    with all the usages and all the principles of representative\r\n    government The King can afterwards take back those among them\r\n    whom he will think fit to retain: there are two whom public\r\n    opinion honours, M. le Duc de Doudeauville[303] and M. le\r\n    Comte de Chabrol[304].\r\n\r\n    \"The review would in this way lose its disadvantages and\r\n    be no more than an unmixed triumph. The Session will end\r\n    peaceably amid blessings showered on the King's head.\r\n\r\n    \"Sire, to dare to write you this letter, I must be very\r\n    firmly persuaded of the necessity for taking a resolution;\r\n    a very imperious sense of duty must have prompted me. The\r\n    ministers are my enemies; I am theirs; I forgive them as a\r\n    Christian; but I shall never forgive them as a man; in this\r\n    position, I should never have spoken to the King of their\r\n    retiring, if the safety of the Monarchy were not at stake.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame la Dauphine and Madame la Duchesse de Berry were insulted on\r\ngoing to the review; the King was generally well received; but one or\r\ntwo companies of the 6th Legion cried:\r\n\r\n\"Down with the ministers! Down with the Jesuits!\" Charles X. was\r\noffended, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"I came to receive homage, and not a lesson.\"\r\n\r\nHe often had noble words in his mouth which were not always supported\r\nby vigorous action: his spirit was bold, his character timid. On\r\nreturning to the Palace, Charles X. said to Marshal Oudinot[305]:\r\n\r\n\"The effect as a whole was satisfactory. There were a few marplots, but\r\nthe bulk of the National Guard is good: express my satisfaction to it.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle arrived. On their way back, some of the legions had\r\npassed by the Ministry of Finance and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Down with Villèle!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National Guard.]\r\n\r\nIrritated by all the previous attacks, the minister was no longer proof\r\nagainst the impulses of a cold anger; he proposed to the Council to\r\ndisband the National Guard. He was supported by Messieurs de Corbière,\r\nde Peyronnet, de Damas[306] and de Clermont-Tonnerre[307] and opposed\r\nby M. de Chabrol[308], the Bishop of Hermopolis[309] and the Duc de\r\nDoudeauville[310]. A royal decree pronounced the disbanding, the most\r\nbaleful blow struck at the Monarchy before the last blow of the days of\r\nJuly: if, at that moment, the National Guard had not been dissolved,\r\nthe barricades would not have gone forward. M. le Duc de Doudeauville\r\nsent in his resignation; he wrote the King a letter giving his motives\r\nand foretelling the future, which everybody, for the rest, foresaw.\r\n\r\nThe Government began to be afraid; the newspapers were redoubling in\r\naudacity and a plan of censorship was put forward against them, from\r\nhabit; there was even talk of a La Bourdonnaye[311] Ministry, in which\r\nM. de Polignac would have figured. I had had the misfortune to appoint\r\nM. de Polignac Ambassador to London, in spite of what M. de Villèle\r\nsaid to me: on this occasion he saw more clearly and further than I.\r\nOn entering the ministry, I had hastened to do something agreeable\r\nto Monsieur. The President of the Council had contrived to reconcile\r\nthe two brothers, in view of an approaching change of reign: he was\r\nsuccessful in that; I, taking it into my head for once in my life to\r\ntry to be shrewd, was stupid. Had M. Polignac not been an ambassador,\r\nhe would not have become Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle, beset on one side by the Royalist Liberal Opposition,\r\nplagued on the other by the requirements of the bishops, misled by\r\nthe prefects consulted, who were themselves misled[312], determined\r\nto dissolve the Electoral Chamber, despite the three hundred who\r\nremained faithful to him. The dissolution was preceded by the revival\r\nof the censorship[313]. I attacked more vigorously than ever[314]; the\r\ndifferent sections of the Opposition joined hands; the elections of\r\nthe small colleges all went against the ministry[315]; in Paris, the\r\nLeft triumphed; seven colleges returned M. Royer-Collard[316], and the\r\ntwo colleges before which M. de Peyronnet[317], a minister, presented\r\nhimself rejected him. Paris illuminated again; there were scenes of\r\nbloodshed; barricades were thrown up[318], and the troops sent to\r\nestablish order were obliged to fire: thus the way was prepared for\r\nthe last and fatal days. In the meantime, the news arrived of the\r\nBattle of Navarino[319], a success in which I could claim my share. The\r\ngreat misfortunes of the Restoration have been announced by victories;\r\nthey had difficulty in detaching themselves from the heirs of Louis the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chambers.]\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Peers enjoyed the public favour, thanks to its\r\nresistance to the oppressive laws; but it did not know how to defend\r\nitself: it allowed itself to be gorged with batches[320] against which\r\nI was almost the only one to protest. I prophesied to it that those\r\nnominations would vitiate its principle and cause it, in the long run,\r\nto lose all its strength in public opinion: was I mistaken? Those\r\nbatches, introduced with the object of breaking up a majority, have not\r\nonly destroyed the aristocracy in France, but have become the means\r\nwhich will be employed against the English aristocracy; the latter will\r\nbe stifled under a multitudinous fabrication of togas and will end by\r\nlosing its hereditary right, even as the distorted peerage has lost it\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nThe new Chamber, on its arrival, pronounced its famous refusal of\r\nco-operation. M. de Villèle, reduced to extremities, thought of\r\ndismissing part of his colleagues and negociated with Messieurs\r\nLaffitte[321] and Casimir Périer[322]. The two leaders of the\r\nOpposition of the Left lent an ear; the plot was discovered; M.\r\nLaffitte did not dare to take a resolution; the President's hour\r\nstruck and the portfolio fell from his hands[323]. I had cried out\r\naloud on withdrawing from office; M. de Villèle lay down: he had a\r\nfeeble desire to remain in the Chamber of Deputies; that was what he\r\nought to have made up his mind to, but he had neither a sufficiently\r\nprofound acquaintance with representative government nor a sufficiently\r\ngreat authority on outside opinion to play a part of that sort: the\r\nnew ministers demanded his banishment to the Chamber of Peers and he\r\naccepted it. I was consulted as to some substitutes for the cabinet and\r\nI invited them to take M. Casimir Périer and General Sébastiani: my\r\nwords were wasted.\r\n\r\nM. de Chabrol, charged with the construction of the new ministry, put\r\nme at the head of the list: I was indignantly struck out by Charles\r\nX. M. Portalis[324], the most miserable character that ever was,\r\na Federate during the Hundred Days, grovelling at the feet of the\r\nLegitimacy, of which he spoke as the most ardent Royalist would have\r\nblushed to speak, to-day lavish of his hackneyed adulation to Philip,\r\nreceived the Seals. At the War Office, M. de Caux[325] replaced M.\r\nde Clermont-Tonnerre. M. le Comte Roy[326], the skilful artisan of\r\nhis immense fortune, was given Finance. The Comte de La Ferronnays,\r\nmy friend, had the Foreign Office. M. de Martignac[327], entered the\r\nMinistry of the Interior; the King soon conceived a hatred for him.\r\nCharles X. obeyed his tastes rather than his principles: he disliked M.\r\nde Martignac because of his love of pleasure, yet he favoured Messieurs\r\nde Corbière and de Villèle, neither of whom went to Mass.\r\n\r\nM. de Chabrol and the Bishop of Hermopolis remained temporarily in the\r\nministry. The bishop, before retiring, came to see me; he asked me if I\r\nwould replace him as Minister of Public Instruction:\r\n\r\n\"Take M. Royer-Collard,\" said I to him, \"I have no desire to be a\r\nminister; but if the King wished absolutely to recall me to the\r\nCouncil, I would come back only through the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, in reparation of the affront which I received. And I can have\r\nno claim on that office, which is very well placed in the hands of my\r\nnoble friend.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of M. Mathieu de Montmorency, M. de Rivière[328] had\r\nbecome governor to the Duc de Bordeaux; from that time he worked for\r\nthe overthrow of M. de Villèle, for the devout Court Party had risen\r\nagainst the Minister of Finance. M. de Rivière met me by appointment\r\nin the Rue de Taranne, at M. de Marcellus', to make the same useless\r\nproposal to me which the Abbé de Frayssinous made later. M. de Rivière\r\ndied, and M. le Baron de Damas succeeded him about the person of the\r\nDuc de Bordeaux. The question remained therefore to find successors to\r\nM. de Chabrol and M. the Bishop of Hermopolis. The Abbé Feutrier[329],\r\nBishop of Beauvais, was installed at the Ministry of Public Worship,\r\nwhich was separated from the Public Instruction, the latter falling to\r\nM. de Vatimesnil[330]. Remained the Ministry of Marine: it was offered\r\nto me; I declined it. M. le Comte Roy asked me to tell him some one\r\nwho would be acceptable to me and whom I would select, in my shade\r\nof opinion. I mentioned M. Hyde de Neuville. The tutor of the Duc de\r\nBordeaux had also to be found; the Comte Roy spoke of it to me: M. de\r\nChéverus[331] at once occurred to my mind. The Minister of Finance\r\nhastened to Charles X.; the King said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection: Hyde for the Navy; but why cannot Chateaubriand\r\ntake that office himself? As for M. de Chéverus, it would be an\r\nexcellent choice; I am sorry not to have thought of it; two hours\r\nearlier, and the thing would have been done: tell Chateaubriand so; but\r\nM. Tharin[332] is appointed.\"\r\n\r\nM. Roy came to inform me of the success of his negociation; he added:\r\n\r\n\"The King wishes you to accept an embassy; if you like, you shall go to\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambassador to Rome.]\r\n\r\nThat word \"Rome\" had a magic effect upon me; I felt the temptation\r\nto which the anchorites were exposed in the desert. Charles X., in\r\naccepting for the Navy the friend whom I had suggested, was making\r\nthe first advances; I could no longer refuse what he expected of me:\r\nI therefore consented once more to go away. This time, at least, the\r\nplace of exile attracted me: _Pontificum veneranda sedes, sacrum\r\nsolium._ I felt myself seized with the desire to settle for good, with\r\nthe longing to disappear (even with some calculated idea of fame) in\r\nthe city of funerals, at the very moment of my triumph. I should no\r\nlonger have raised my voice, unless like Pliny's prophetic bird, to say\r\n_Ave_ every morning to the Capitol and the dawn. It may be that it was\r\nuseful to my country to get rid of me: by the weight which I feel to\r\nmyself, I can guess the burden which I must be to others. Minds of some\r\npower which prey upon themselves and turn upon themselves are tiring.\r\nDante places tortured souls, in the Inferno, on a bed of fire. M. le\r\nDuc de Laval, whom I was going to replace in Rome, was appointed to the\r\nEmbassy in Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore changing my subject, I beg leave to retrace my steps and relieve\r\nmyself of a burden. I did not enter without suffering into the details\r\nof my long difference with M. de Villèle. I have been accused of\r\ncontributing to the fall of the Legitimist Monarchy; it is right that I\r\nshould examine that reproach.\r\n\r\nThe events which happened under the ministry of which I formed part\r\nhave an importance which binds it to the common fortune of France:\r\nthere is no Frenchman but his lot has been affected by the good which\r\nI may have done, the ill which I have undergone. Through whimsical\r\nand inexplicable affinities, through secret relations which sometimes\r\nentwine lofty and vulgar destinies, the Bourbons prospered so long as\r\nthey deigned to listen to me, although I am far from believing, with\r\nthe poet, that \"my eloquence gave alms to the Royalty[333].\" So soon\r\nas it was thought right to break the reed that grew at the foot of the\r\nthrone, the crown leant over, soon to fall: often, by plucking a blade\r\nof grass, one causes a great ruin to crumble into dust.\r\n\r\nThese incontestable facts you may explain as you will; if they give\r\nto my political career a relative value which it does not possess of\r\nitself, I shall get no vainer, I feel no evil joy at the chance which\r\nconnects my short-lived name with the events of the centuries. Whatever\r\nthe variety of the accidents of my adventurous course, wherever names\r\nand facts may have led me, the last horizon of the picture is always\r\nthreatening and sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Juga cœpta moveri\r\n     Silvarum, visæque canes ululare per umbram[334].\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, if the scene has changed in a deplorable manner, I must, they say,\r\naccuse only myself: to avenge what appeared to me an injury, I divided\r\neverything, and this division in the last result produced the overthrow\r\nof the Throne. Let us see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comte de Villèle.]\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle has declared that it was impossible to govern either with\r\nme or without me. With me, there he was wrong; without me, at the time\r\nwhen M. de Villèle said that, he was saying the truth, for the most\r\nvaried opinions made up a majority for me.\r\n\r\nM. the President of the Council has never known me. I was sincerely\r\nattached to him; I had made him enter his first ministry, as is proved\r\nby M. le Duc de Richelieu's note of thanks and the other notes which I\r\nhave quoted. I had sent in my resignation as Plenipotentiary to Berlin\r\nwhen M. de Villèle retired. They persuaded him that, on his second\r\nentrance into office, I desired his place. I had no such desire. I do\r\nnot belong to the fearless race, deaf to the voice of devotion and\r\nreason. The truth is that I have no ambition; that is precisely the\r\npassion which I lack, because I have another that governs me. When I\r\nasked M. de Villèle to take some important dispatch to the King, to\r\nsave me the trouble of going to the Palace, in order to leave me at\r\nleisure to visit a Gothic chapel in the Rue Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre, he\r\nmight have felt assured against my ambition, if he had judged better of\r\nmy puerile candour or of the loftiness of my disdain.\r\n\r\nNothing attracts me in practical life, except, perhaps, the Foreign\r\nOffice. I was not insensible to the idea that the country would owe to\r\nme its liberty at home, its independence abroad. Far from seeking to\r\noverthrow M. de Villèle, I had said to the King:\r\n\r\n\"Sire, M. de Villèle is a most enlightened President; Your Majesty\r\nmust keep him for evermore at the head of your Councils.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Villèle did not notice it: my mind might lean towards domination,\r\nbut it was subject to my character; I found pleasure in my obedience,\r\nbecause it rid me of my will. My capital fault is weariness, distaste\r\nfor everything, perpetual doubt. Had a sovereign been found who,\r\nunderstanding me, had kept me at work by force, he would perhaps have\r\nturned me to some account: but Heaven rarely causes to be born together\r\nthe man who will and the man who can. When all is said and done, is\r\nthere a thing to-day for which one would take the trouble to get out of\r\nbed? We fall asleep to the sound of the kingdoms which fall during the\r\nnight and which are swept up each morning before our door.\r\n\r\nBesides, since M. de Villèle parted from me, politics had become\r\nderanged: the ultraism against which the wisdom of the President of\r\nthe Council still struggled had gone beyond him. The annoyance which\r\nhe experienced at the hands of opinion at home and of the movement\r\nof opinion abroad rendered him irritable: hence the fettering of\r\nthe press, the suppression of the National Guard of Paris, and so\r\nforth. Was I to allow the Monarchy to perish, in order to acquire the\r\nreputation of an hypocritical moderation on the look-out? I believed\r\nmyself most sincerely to be fulfilling a duty in fighting at the head\r\nof the Opposition, paying too much attention to the peril which I\r\nbeheld on one side, not enough struck with the contrary danger. When M.\r\nde Villèle was overthrown, I was consulted on the nomination of a new\r\nministry. If they had, as I suggested, taken M. Casimir Périer, General\r\nSébastiani and M. Royer-Collard, things might have held out. I would\r\nnot accept the department of the Navy and I made them give it to my\r\nfriend M. Hyde de Neuville; I also twice refused the Ministry of Public\r\nInstruction; never would I have entered the Council unless I were the\r\nmaster. I went to Rome to seek my other self among the ruins, for there\r\nare in my person two distinct beings, having no communication one with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nI will, however, make a loyal admission: my excessive resentment does\r\nnot justify me according to the rule and the time-honoured word of\r\nvirtue; but my whole life serves as my excuse.\r\n\r\nAn officer in the Navarre Regiment, I had returned from the forests\r\nof America to join the fleeing Legitimacy, to fight in its ranks\r\nagainst my own judgment, all without conviction, from sheer soldierly\r\nduty. I remained eight years on foreign soil, overwhelmed with every\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\nThis generous tribute paid, I returned to France in 1800. Bonaparte\r\nsought me out and placed me; on the death of the Duc d'Enghien, I\r\ndevoted myself once more to the memory of the Bourbons. My words on\r\nthe tomb of Mesdames at Trieste revived the wrath of the dispenser\r\nof empires; he threatened to have me cut down on the steps of the\r\nTuileries. The pamphlet _De Bonaparte et des Bourbons_ was worth to\r\nLouis XVIII., on his own confession, as much as a hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the popularity which I then enjoyed,\r\nanti-Constitutional France understood the institutions of the\r\nLegitimate Royalty. During the Hundred Days, the Monarchy saw me by\r\nits side in its second exile. Lastly, through the Spanish War, I had\r\ncontributed to the suppression of the conspiracies, to the union of\r\nopinions under one and the same cockade, and to the restoring of its\r\nrange to our cannon. The rest of my plans are well known: to extend our\r\nfrontiers, to give new crowns in the New World to the family of St.\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My difference with him.]\r\n\r\nThis long perseverance in the same sentiments perhaps merited some\r\nconsideration. Sensitive to affront, I did not find it possible also to\r\nput on one side what I might be worth, to forget entirely that I was\r\nthe restorer of religion, the author of the _Génie du Christianisme._\r\n\r\nMy agitation necessarily increased still further at the thought that\r\na paltry quarrel made our country miss an opportunity of greatness\r\nwhich it would not find again. Had they said to me, \"Your plans will be\r\nfollowed; what you have taken in hand will be carried out without you,\"\r\nI should have forgotten all for France. Unfortunately, I had the belief\r\nthat my ideas would not be adopted; the event has proved it.\r\n\r\nI was, perhaps, in error, but I was persuaded that M. le Comte de\r\nVillèle did not understand the society which he ruled; I am convinced\r\nthat the solid qualities of that able minister were inadequate at the\r\nhour of his ministry: he had come too early under the Restoration.\r\nFinancial operations, commercial companies, the industrial movement,\r\ncanals, steamboats, railways, high-roads, a material society which\r\nhas no passion save that of peace, which dreams only of the comforts\r\nof life, which wants to make of the future only a perpetual to-day:\r\nin this order of things, M. de Villèle would have been king. M. de\r\nVillèle wanted a time which could not be his and, from honour, he\r\nwill have nothing to do with a time which belongs to him. Under the\r\nRestoration, all the faculties of the mind were alive; all parties\r\ndreamt of realities or illusions; all, advancing or receding, came\r\ninto tumultuous collision; none purposed to remain where he was; to\r\nno earnest mind did the Constitutional Legitimacy seem to be the last\r\nword of the Republic or the Monarchy. We felt stirring in the ground\r\nunder our feet armies or revolutions which came to offer themselves\r\nfor extraordinary destinies. M. de Villèle was quite alive to this\r\nmovement; he saw the wings grow which, sprouting from the nation's\r\nshoulders, were about to restore it to its element, to the air, to\r\nspace, immense and light as it is. M. de Villèle wished to keep this\r\nnation to the ground, to fasten it down, but he never had the strength\r\nfor it. I, on the other hand, wished to occupy the French with glory,\r\nto fasten them up above, to endeavour to lead them to reality through\r\ndreams: that is what they love.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to be more humble, more prostrate, more Christian.\r\nUnfortunately I am subject to err; I have not the evangelic perfection:\r\nif a man struck me on the cheek, I should not turn to him the other\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nHad I conjectured the result, I should certainly have refrained; the\r\nmajority which voted the phrase of refusal to co-operate would not have\r\nvoted it, if they had foreseen the consequence of their vote. None\r\nseriously desired a catastrophe, except a few men apart. There was\r\nat first only a riot, and the Legitimacy alone transformed it into a\r\nrevolution: when the moment had come, it lacked the intelligence, the\r\nprudence, the resolution that could still save it. After all, it is a\r\nmonarchy fallen; many more will fall: I owed it only my fidelity; it\r\nwill have that ever.\r\n\r\nDevoted to the early adversities of the Monarchy, I have consecrated\r\nmyself to its final misfortunes: ill-fortune will always have for me a\r\nsecond. I have given back all, places, pensions, honours; and, in order\r\nthat I might have nothing more to ask of anybody, I have pledged my\r\ncoffin. O stern and rigid judges, virtuous and infallible Royalists,\r\nwho mixed an oath with your riches as you mix salt with the meats of\r\nyour banquets to preserve them, have a little indulgence in respect\r\nof my past bitternesses; I am expiating them to-day after my fashion,\r\nwhich is not yours. Do you think that, at the evening hour, at the hour\r\nat which the toiler seeks repose, he does not feel the weight of life,\r\nwhen that weight is cast back upon his shoulders? And yet, I need not\r\nhave borne the burden. I saw Philip in his palace, from the 1st to the\r\n6th of August 1830, as I shall tell when the time comes; it but lay\r\nwith me to hearken to generous words.\r\n\r\nLater, if I had been able to repent of doing right, it was still\r\npossible for me to retract the first impulse of my conscience. M.\r\nBenjamin Constant, the man so powerful then, wrote to me on the 20th of\r\nSeptember[335]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I would much rather write to you of yourself than of myself,\r\n    the thing would have more importance. I should like to be\r\n    able to speak to you of the loss which you are causing all\r\n    France to sustain by withdrawing yourself from her destinies,\r\n    you who have exercised so noble and wholesome an influence\r\n    upon her. But it would be indiscreet of me to treat personal\r\n    questions in this way, and I am bound, while groaning like\r\n    every Frenchman, to respect your scruples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy duties not yet seeming to me to be consummated, I have defended\r\nthe widow and the orphan, I have undergone the trial and the prison\r\nwhich Bonaparte, even in his greatest angers, spared me. I stand forth\r\nbetween my resignation on the death of the Duc d'Enghien and my cry on\r\nbehalf of the plundered child; I rest upon a prince shot dead and a\r\nprince in banishment; they sustain my old arms entwined in their feeble\r\narms: O Royalists, are you so well attended?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My sacrifices.]\r\n\r\nBut, the more I have tied down my life with the bonds of devotion\r\nand honour, the more have I changed my liberty of action for\r\nindependence of thought; that thought has resumed its nature. Now,\r\noutside everything, I appraise governments at their worth. Can one\r\nbelieve in the kings of the future? Is one to believe in the peoples\r\nof the present? The wise and disconsolate man of this century without\r\nconviction finds a wretched repose only in political atheism. Let\r\nthe young generations lull themselves with hopes: before hitting the\r\nmark, they will wait long years; the ages are proceeding towards the\r\ngeneral levelling, but they do not hasten their speed at the call of\r\nour desires. Time is a sort of eternity adapted to mortal things; it\r\ncounts the races and their sorrows for nothing in the works which it\r\naccomplishes.\r\n\r\nIt follows from what you have just read that, if what I advised had\r\nbeen done, if petty longings had not placed their own satisfaction\r\nbefore the interests of France; if those in power had shown a clearer\r\nappreciation of relative capacities; if the foreign Cabinets had,\r\nlike Alexander, deemed that the safety of the French Monarchy lay in\r\nLiberal institutions; if those Cabinets had not maintained the restored\r\nauthority in defiance of the principles of the Charter, the Legitimacy\r\nwould still be occupying the throne. Ah, what is past is past! It is\r\nuseless to turn back, to resume the place which we have quitted; we\r\nfind nothing of that which we left there: men, ideas, circumstances,\r\nall have faded away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: This book was written in 1839.--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: Marthe Camille Bachasson, Comte de Montalivet\r\n(1801-1880), inherited the title of peer on the death of his father\r\nand his elder brother (22 January and 12 October 1823), but was\r\nnot admitted to take his seat in the Upper Chamber until 12 May\r\n1826, because of his age.

Before\r\ncontinuing my story, I must speak of a woman of whom we shall not lose\r\nsight again till the end of these Memoirs. A correspondence is about to\r\nopen between us from Rome to Paris: it is necessary, therefore, to know\r\nto whom I am writing, how and at what period I became acquainted with\r\nMadame Récamier.\r\n\r\nShe met, in the different ranks of society, persons, more or less\r\ncelebrated, engaged upon the stage of the world: all offered her their\r\nworship. Her beauty mingles its ideal existence with the material facts\r\nof our history: a placid light illuminating a stormy picture.\r\n\r\nLet us resume once more the consideration of times gone by; let us\r\nendeavour, by the light of my setting sun, to trace a portrait on the\r\nsky where my night, which approaches, will soon spread its shadows.\r\n\r\nA letter published in the _Mercure_ after my return to France, in 1800,\r\nhad attracted the attention of Madame de Staël. I was not yet struck\r\noff the list of Emigrants; _Atala_ drew me from my obscurity. Madame\r\nBacciocchi (Élisa Bonaparte), at the request of M. de Fontanes, applied\r\nfor and obtained my erasure. Madame de Staël had interested herself in\r\nthis matter: I went to thank her. I cannot remember if it was Christian\r\nde Lamoignon or the author of _Corinne_[337] who introduced me to\r\nMadame Récamier, her friend; the latter was then living at her house\r\nin the Rue du Mont-Blanc. On emerging from my woods and the obscurity\r\nof my life, I was still quite timid; I scarce dared lift my eyes to a\r\nwoman surrounded by adorers.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a month later, I was at Madame de Staël's; she had\r\nreceived me at her toilet; she let Mademoiselle Olive dress her, while\r\nshe talked, twisting a little green branch between her fingers. Entered\r\nsuddenly Madame Récamier, dressed in a white gown; she sat down in\r\nthe middle of a sofa covered in blue silk. Madame de Staël, remaining\r\nstanding, continued her very animated conversation, and talked\r\neloquently; I hardly answered, my eyes fixed on Madame Récamier. I had\r\nnever imagined anything like her, and was more than ever discouraged:\r\nmy admiration changed into ill-humour against my person. Madame\r\nRécamier went out, and I did not see her again till twelve years later.\r\n\r\nTwelve years! What adverse power thus cuts and fritters away our\r\ndays, squandering them ironically on all the indifferences called\r\nattachments, on all the miseries styled felicities! Then, by a further\r\nderision, when it has blighted and spent the most precious part, it\r\nbrings you back to the starting-point of your career. And how does it\r\nbring you back? With your mind possessed with the foreign ideas, the\r\nimportunate phantoms, the deluded or incomplete feelings of a world\r\nwhich has left you no happiness. Those ideas, those phantoms, those\r\nfeelings place themselves between you and the bliss which you might\r\nstill enjoy. You return with your heart sick with regret, afflicted by\r\nthose errors of youth so painful to the memory in the modesty of years.\r\nThat is how I returned, after having been to Rome, to Syria, after\r\nseeing an empire go by, after becoming the man of noise, after ceasing\r\nto be the man of silence. What had Madame Récamier done? What had been\r\nher life?\r\n\r\nI have not known the greater portion of the existence at once brilliant\r\nand retired of which I am about to talk to you: I am obliged,\r\ntherefore, to betake myself to authorities other than mine; but they\r\nshall be unexceptionable. First, Madame Récamier has described to me\r\nfacts which she has witnessed and communicated to me valuable letters.\r\nShe has written, on what she has seen, notes of which she has permitted\r\nme to consult the text and, too rarely, to quote it. Next, Madame de\r\nStaël in her correspondence, Benjamin Constant in his recollections,\r\nsome printed, the others in manuscript, M. Ballanche in a notice on our\r\ncommon friend, Madame la Duchesse d'Abrantès in her sketches, Madame\r\nde Genlis in hers have furnished abundant materials for my narrative:\r\nI have only knotted all these fine names together, filling up the gaps\r\nwith my own statement, when some links of the chain of events were\r\noverlooked or broken.\r\n\r\nMontaigne says that men go gaping after future things[338]: I have the\r\npassion for gaping after past things. All is pleasure, particularly\r\nwhen we turn our eyes to the early years of those we love; we spin out\r\na cherished life; we extend the affection which we feel over days which\r\nwe never knew and which we revive; we adorn that which was with that\r\nwhich is; we recompose youthfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame Récamier.]\r\n\r\nAt Lyons, I have seen the Jardin des Plantes laid down on the ruins of\r\nthe ancient amphitheatre and in the gardens of the old Abbaye de la\r\nDéserte, now pulled down; the Rhone and the Saône flow at its feet;\r\nfar away rises the highest mountain in Europe, the first mile-post\r\nof Italy, with its white board above the clouds. Madame Récamier was\r\nplaced in this abbey; she there passed her childhood behind a grill\r\nwhich opened upon the outer church only at the elevation of the Mass.\r\nThen one saw young girls bowing down in the inner chapel of the\r\nconvent. The saint's-day of the abbess was the principal festival of\r\nthe community; the prettiest boarder paid the customary compliment:\r\nher dress was arranged, her hair plaited, her head veiled and crowned\r\nby the hands of her playmates; and all this in silence, for the hour\r\nof rising was one of those which were called \"grand silence\" in the\r\nmonasteries. It goes without saying that Juliette[339] had the honours\r\nof the day. Her father and mother, having settled in Paris, sent to\r\nfetch their child. From some rough drafts written by Madame Récamier, I\r\ngather this note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"On the eve of the day on which my aunt was to come to fetch\r\n    me, I was taken to the room of Madame the Abbess to receive\r\n    her blessing. The next day, bathed in tears, I went out\r\n    through the door, which I did not remember seeing opened to\r\n    admit me, found myself in a carriage with my aunt, and we\r\n    drove off for Paris.\r\n\r\n    \"I leave with regret a time so calm and so pure to enter upon\r\n    that of excitement. It often comes back to me as in a vague,\r\n    sweet dream, with its clouds of incense, its numberless\r\n    ceremonies, its processions in the gardens, its singing and\r\n    its flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose hours which have left a pious desert now rest in another\r\nreligious solitude, without having lost anything of their freshness and\r\ntheir harmony.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Constant, the wittiest man after Voltaire, strives to give\r\nan idea of Madame Récamier's early youth: he has drawn from the model\r\nwhose features he aimed at tracing a grace which was not natural to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Among the women of our time,\" he says, \"whom advantages of\r\n    feature, mind, or character have rendered famous, there is\r\n    one whom I wish to depict. Her beauty made her admired at\r\n    first; her soul next made itself known, and her soul appeared\r\n    even superior to her beauty. The habit of society supplied\r\n    her mind with the means to display itself, and her mind\r\n    remained below neither her beauty nor her soul.\r\n\r\n    \"At the age of barely fifteen[340], married to a man[341]\r\n    who, occupied by an immense amount of business, could not\r\n    guide her extreme youthfulness, Madame Récamier found herself\r\n    left almost entirely to herself in a country which was still\r\n    in a state of chaos.\r\n\r\n    \"Several women of the same period have filled Europe with\r\n    their diverse fames. The majority have paid tribute to their\r\n    century, some through indelicate loves, others by guilty\r\n    condescensions towards the successive tyrannies.\r\n\r\n    \"She whom I am describing emerged radiant and pure from\r\n    that atmosphere which blighted all that it did not corrupt.\r\n    Childhood was at first a safeguard for her, thanks to the\r\n    Author of this beautiful work, who made everything turn to\r\n    her advantage. Far removed from the world, in a solitude\r\n    beautified by the arts, she formed for herself a gentle\r\n    occupation out of all those attractive and poetic studies\r\n    which remain the charm of another age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Often also, surrounded by young companions, she indulged\r\n    with them in clamorous sports. Slender and light of foot,\r\n    she outstripped them in the race; she covered with a bandage\r\n    her eyes which were one day to penetrate every soul. Her\r\n    glance, to-day so expressive and so profound, which seems to\r\n    us to reveal mysteries unknown to herself, sparkled then only\r\n    with a lively and playful gaiety. Her beautiful hair, which\r\n    cannot become undone without filling us with perturbation,\r\n    then fell, without danger to any, over her white shoulders.\r\n    Laughter loud and long often interrupted her childish\r\n    conversation; but already one could perceive in her that nice\r\n    and quick observation which seizes upon the ridiculous, that\r\n    gentle malice which is amused by it without ever wounding,\r\n    and particularly that exquisite sentiment of eloquence,\r\n    purity and good taste, a real inborn nobility, the titles to\r\n    which are stamped upon privileged beings.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: madame Récamier.]\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Her girlhood.]\r\n\r\n    \"The great world of that time was too uncongenial to her\r\n    nature that she should not prefer retirement. She was\r\n    never seen in the houses open to all comers, the only\r\n    meeting-places possible when every closed company was\r\n    suspected; where all classes rushed, because there they could\r\n    talk and say nothing, meet and not be compromised; where ill\r\n    manners took the place of wit and disorder of gaiety. She was\r\n    never seen at the Court of the Directory, where the power\r\n    was at once terrible and familiar, inspiring dread without\r\n    escaping contempt.\r\n\r\n    \"However, Madame Récamier sometimes issued from her retreat\r\n    to go to the play or to the public walks and, in those places\r\n    frequented by all, her rare appearances were real events.\r\n    Every other object of those vast assemblies was forgotten,\r\n    and all flung themselves in her way. The man fortunate\r\n    enough to escort her had to overcome admiration as it were\r\n    an obstacle; his steps were at every moment delayed by the\r\n    onlookers crowding around her; she delighted in this success\r\n    with the gaiety of a child and the shyness of a young girl;\r\n    but her graceful dignity, which in her home distinguished\r\n    her from her young friends, abroad restrained the exuberant\r\n    throng. It was as though she reigned by her mere presence\r\n    over her companions and the public. Thus passed the first\r\n    years of Madame Récamier's marriage, between poetical\r\n    occupations, childish sports at home, and short and brilliant\r\n    appearances in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrupting the narrative of the author of _Adolphe_[342], I will say\r\nthat, in this society following upon the Terror, everybody feared to\r\nhave the air of possessing a home. People met in the public places,\r\nespecially in the Pavillon de Hanovre[343]: when I saw that pavilion,\r\nit was deserted like the hall of a yesterday's feast, or like a stage\r\nfrom which the actors had descended for ever. There were wont to come\r\ntogether young women escaped from prison, whom André Chénier had made\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Je ne veux point mourir encore[344].\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier had met Danton on his road to execution and, soon\r\nafter, she saw some of the fair victims snatched from men who had\r\nthemselves become victims of their own fury.\r\n\r\nI come back to my guide Benjamin Constant:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Madame Récamier's mind had need of another food. The\r\n    instinct for the beautiful caused her to delight beforehand,\r\n    without knowing them, in men distinguished by a reputation\r\n    for talent and genius.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de La Harpe was one of the first to appreciate this woman\r\n    who was destined one day to group around herself all the\r\n    celebrities of her age. He had met her in her childhood, he\r\n    saw her again married, and the conversation of this young\r\n    person of sixteen years possessed a thousand attractions\r\n    for a man whom his excessive self-esteem and the habit of\r\n    intercourse with the most intelligent men in France rendered\r\n    extremely difficult and hard to please.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de La Harpe divested himself, in the presence of Madame\r\n    Récamier, of most of the defects which made commerce with\r\n    him laborious and almost insupportable. He took pleasure in\r\n    acting as her guide: he admired the swiftness with which\r\n    her mind made good her want of experience and grasped all\r\n    that he revealed to her concerning the world and mankind.\r\n    It was at the time of the famous conversion which so many\r\n    people have qualified as hypocrisy. I have always regarded\r\n    that conversion as sincere. The sentiment of religion is an\r\n    inherent faculty in man; it is absurd to pretend that fraud\r\n    and falsehood have created that faculty. Nothing is put\r\n    into the human soul except what nature has put there. The\r\n    persecutions, the abuses of authority in favour of certain\r\n    dogmas can delude us personally and revolt us against what we\r\n    should feel if it were not imposed upon us; but, so soon as\r\n    the external causes have ceased, we return to our primitive\r\n    tendency: when there is no more courage in resisting, we\r\n    no longer applaud ourselves for our resistance. Now, the\r\n    Revolution having taken this merit from unbelief, the men\r\n    whom vanity alone had rendered unbelieving were able to\r\n    become religious in good faith.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de La Harpe was of that number; but he retained his\r\n    intolerant character and that bitterness of disposition which\r\n    made him conceive new hatreds without abjuring the old ones.\r\n    All those thorns of his devotion disappeared, however, when\r\n    he was with Madame Récamier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. de La Harpe.]\r\n\r\nHere are a few fragments of the letters from M. de La Harpe to Madame\r\nRécamier of which Benjamin Constant speaks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"SATURDAY, 28 _September._\r\n\r\n    \"What, madame, you carry your kindness so far as to wish to\r\n    honour a poor outlaw like myself with a visit! This time I\r\n    might say, like the ancient patriarchs, whom I resemble so\r\n    little otherwise, that 'an angel has come into my house.' I\r\n    well know that you like to do works of mercy; but, as things\r\n    go nowadays, all good is difficult, and this like the rest.\r\n    I must inform you, to my great regret, that to come alone\r\n    is first of all impossible, for many reasons: among others\r\n    that, with your youth and your face, the splendour of which\r\n    will follow you everywhere, you could not travel without a\r\n    waiting-maid, to whom prudence forbids me to confide the\r\n    secret of my retreat, which is not mine alone. You would\r\n    therefore have only one means of carrying out your generous\r\n    resolution, which would be to take counsel with Madame de\r\n    Clermont, who would bring you one day to her little sylvan\r\n    castle, and from there it would be very easy for you to\r\n    come with her. You are both made to appreciate and love one\r\n    another.... I am writing many verses at this moment. In\r\n    writing them, I often reflect that I shall one day be able\r\n    to read them to the fair and charming Juliet, whose mind is\r\n    as penetrating as her glance, and her taste as pure as her\r\n    soul. I would also willingly send you the fragment of Adonis\r\n    which you like, although it has become a little profane for\r\n    me; but I would want a promise that it shall not leave your\r\n    hands....\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, madame; I indulge with you in ideas which anyone\r\n    but yourself would think very extraordinary addressed to a\r\n    person of sixteen years; but I know that your sixteen years\r\n    are only in your face[345].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"SATURDAY[346].\r\n\r\n    \"It is long indeed, madame, since I had the pleasure of\r\n    talking with you, and, if you be sure, as you must be,\r\n    that this is one of my privations, you will make me no\r\n    reproaches....\r\n\r\n    \"You have read in my soul; you have seen there that I wore\r\n    in it the mourning for the public misfortunes and for my own\r\n    faults, and I could not but feel that this sad disposition\r\n    formed too strong a contrast with all the brilliancy that\r\n    encompasses your age and your charms. I even fear lest it\r\n    should sometimes have made itself felt in the few moments\r\n    which I have been permitted to spend with you, and I entreat\r\n    your indulgence therefore. But now, madame, when Providence\r\n    seems to show us a better future very near at hand, to whom\r\n    could I better than to yourself confide the joy which I\r\n    derive from hopes so sweet and, to my belief, so near? Who\r\n    will fill a greater place than you in the private pleasures\r\n    which will be mingled with the public joy? I shall then be\r\n    more susceptible and less unworthy of the delights of your\r\n    charming company, and how happy I shall deem myself still\r\n    to count for something in it! If you deign to attach the\r\n    same value to the fruit of my labour, you shall always be\r\n    the first to whom I shall hasten to present it. Then no\r\n    more contradictions nor obstacles; you shall always find me\r\n    at your orders, and none, I hope, will be able to blame me\r\n    for this preference. I shall say, 'Here is she who, at the\r\n    age of illusions and with all the brilliant advantages that\r\n    can excuse them, has known all the nobility and delicacy of\r\n    proceedings of the purest friendship and, in the midst of\r\n    every homage, has remembered an outlaw!' I shall say, 'Here\r\n    is she whose youth and grace I have seen grow amid a general\r\n    corruption which was never able to overtake them, she whose\r\n    reason at sixteen years has often put mine to shame!' and I\r\n    am sure that none will be tempted to contradict me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sadness of events, of age and of religion, hidden under a melting\r\nexpression, present in these letters a singular admixture of thought\r\nand style. Let us return once more to Benjamin Constant's narrative:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We come to the time when Madame Récamier saw herself for the\r\n    first time the object of a strong and regular passion. Till\r\n    then she had received unanimous worship from all who had met\r\n    her, but her manner of life nowhere offered centres of union\r\n    where one could be sure of finding her. She never received\r\n    at home and she had not yet formed a society where one could\r\n    penetrate every day to see her and try to please her.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Lucien Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\n    \"In the summer of 1799, Madame Récamier came to live at the\r\n    Château de Clichy, a quarter of a league from Paris. A man\r\n    since celebrated through different sorts of pretensions, and\r\n    even more celebrated through the advantages which he has\r\n    refused than through the successes which he has won, Lucien\r\n    Bonaparte, obtained an introduction to her.\r\n\r\n    \"He had not, till then, aspired to any save facile conquests\r\n    and, to obtain these, had studied only the romancing methods\r\n    which his want of knowledge of the world represented to him\r\n    as infallible. It is possible that he was enticed at first\r\n    by the idea of captivating the loveliest woman of his time.\r\n    Young, the leader of a party in the Council of the Five\r\n    Hundred, the brother of the first general of the age, he was\r\n    gratified at uniting the triumphs of a statesman and the\r\n    successes of a lover in his person.\r\n\r\n    \"He conceived the idea of having recourse to a fiction to\r\n    declare his love to Madame Récamier; he imagined a letter\r\n    from Romeo to Juliet, and sent it as a work of his to her who\r\n    bore the same name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is this letter from Lucien, known to Benjamin Constant; in the\r\nmidst of the revolutions which have stirred the world of reality, it is\r\nracy to see a Bonaparte plunge into the world of fictions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM ROMEO TO JULIET by the author of the _Tribu\r\n    indienne_[347]\r\n\r\n    \"VENICE, 29 _July._\r\n\r\n    \"Romeo writes to you, Juliet: if you refuse to read me, you\r\n    will be crueller than our parents whose long strife has at\r\n    last been appeased; no doubt that horrid strife will not\r\n    revive. ... A few days since, I knew you only by repute. I\r\n    had sometimes seen you in the temples and at feasts; I knew\r\n    you were the most beautiful; a thousand lips repeated your\r\n    praises, and your charms had struck but not dazzled me....\r\n    Why has peace delivered me to your empire? Peace! It reigns\r\n    in our families, but trouble reigns in my heart....\r\n\r\n    \"Recall to yourself the day when I was first presented\r\n    to you. We were celebrating at a large banquet the\r\n    reconciliation of our fathers. I had come from the Senate,\r\n    where the troubles raised against the Republic had created a\r\n    lively impression.... You arrived; then all flocked round:\r\n\r\n    \"'How lovely she is!' they cried....\r\n\r\n    \"The throng in the evening filled the gardens of Bedmar.\r\n    Importunate people, who are everywhere, took possession\r\n    of me. This time I had neither patience with them nor\r\n    affability: they kept me from you!... I wished to account for\r\n    the emotion that was overcoming me. I knew love and wished\r\n    to master it.... I was carried away, and with you left the\r\n    festive spot.\r\n\r\n    \"I have seen you since: love has seemed to smile upon me.\r\n    One day, seated at the water's edge, motionless and pensive,\r\n    you were stripping a rose of its leaves; alone with you,\r\n    I spoke.... I heard a sigh... vain illusion! Recovering\r\n    from my mistake, I saw indifference with its placid brow\r\n    seated between us two.... The passion which masters me found\r\n    utterance in my discourse, and yours bore the amiable and\r\n    cruel impress of childhood and pleasantry.\r\n\r\n    \"Each day I would wish to see you, as though the dart were\r\n    not fixed deep enough in my heart. The moments at which I see\r\n    you are very rare, and those young Venetians who surround you\r\n    and talk insipid gallantry to you are hateful to me. How is\r\n    it possible to talk to Juliet as to other women!\r\n\r\n    \"I have wanted to write to you; you will know me, you will\r\n    no longer refuse to believe me; my soul is ill at ease; it\r\n    thirsts for sentiment. If love has not stirred yours; if\r\n    Romeo in your eyes is but an ordinary man, oh, I conjure you\r\n    by the bonds which you have laid upon me, be severe with me\r\n    from kindness; do not smile to me again, do not speak to me\r\n    again, thrust me far from you. Tell me to go away and, if I\r\n    can execute that rigorous order, remember at least that Romeo\r\n    will ever love you; that none has ever reigned over him as\r\n    Juliet has; and that he can no longer cease to live for her,\r\n    at least in remembrance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a sober-minded man, all this is rather laughable: the Bonapartes\r\nused to live on theatres, novels and verses; is the life of Napoleon\r\nhimself aught else than a poem?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lucien's passion.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Constant continues, while commenting upon this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The style of this letter is evidently imitated from all the\r\n    novels that have depicted the passions, from _Werther_ to the\r\n    _Nouvelle Héloïse._ Madame Récamier easily discovered, from\r\n    several circumstances of detail, that she herself was the\r\n    object of the declaration offered as though simply for her\r\n    perusal. She was not sufficiently accustomed to the language\r\n    of love to be warned by experience that everything in the\r\n    expressions was, perhaps, not sincere; but a true and sure\r\n    instinct warned her; she replied with simplicity and even\r\n    gaiety, and showed much more indifference than disquietude or\r\n    fear. It needed no more for Lucien really to experience the\r\n    passion which he had at first somewhat exaggerated.\r\n\r\n    \"Lucien's letters grew truer, more eloquent, in proportion\r\n    as he grew more impassioned; certainly they always show the\r\n    ambition for ornamentation, the desire to attitudinize; he\r\n    cannot go to sleep without 'flinging himself into the arms of\r\n    Morpheus.' In the midst of his despair, he describes himself\r\n    as surrendered to the great occupations which surround him;\r\n    he is astonished that a man like him sheds tears; but, in all\r\n    this alloy of declamation and phrases, there is nevertheless\r\n    eloquence, sensibility and grief. At last, in a letter full\r\n    of passion in which he wrote to Madame Récamier, 'I cannot\r\n    hate you, but I can kill myself,' he suddenly makes a general\r\n    reflection: 'I am forgetting that love is not snatched, but\r\n    won,' and then adds, 'After receiving your note, I received\r\n    many of a diplomatic character; I learnt some news of which\r\n    public rumour has no doubt informed you. Congratulations\r\n    surround, deafen me... people talk to me of what is not you!\r\n    'Then another exclamation:\r\n\r\n    \"'How weak is nature compared to love!'\r\n\r\n    \"And yet this news which found Lucien unconcerned was an\r\n    immense piece of news: Bonaparte's disembarkation on his\r\n    return from Egypt.\r\n\r\n    \"A new destiny had landed with its promises and its threats;\r\n    the 18 Brumaire was not more than three weeks distant.\r\n\r\n    \"Barely escaped from the dangers of that day, which will\r\n    always fill so great a place in history, Lucien wrote to\r\n    Madame Récamier:\r\n\r\n    \"'I have seen your image!... You will have had my last\r\n    thought!'...\r\n\r\n    \"Madame Récamier contracted a friendship, which became daily\r\n    more intimate and which still endures, with a woman who was\r\n    illustrious in a very different way from that in which M. de\r\n    La Harpe was famous.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Necker, having been struck off the list of Emigrants,\r\n    charged Madame de Staël, his daughter, to sell a house which\r\n    he had. Madame Récamier bought it, and this was an occasion\r\n    for her to see Madame de Staël[348].\r\n\r\n    \"The sight of this celebrated woman at first filled her with\r\n    excessive timidity. The face of Madame de Staël has been\r\n    very widely discussed. But a proud glance, a sweet smile,\r\n    an habitual expression of kindliness, the absence of any\r\n    minute affectation and of any embarrassing reserve, caressing\r\n    words, praises somewhat direct but seeming to escape from\r\n    enthusiasm, an inexhaustible variety of enthusiasm surprise,\r\n    attract and conciliate almost all who approach her. I know\r\n    no woman, nor even any man, who is more convinced of her\r\n    own vast superiority to all the world and who makes this\r\n    conviction bear less hard upon others.\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing could be more engaging than the conversations of\r\n    Madame de Staël and Madame Récamier. The quickness of the\r\n    one in expressing a thousand new thoughts, the quickness of\r\n    the other in grasping and perceiving them; that masculine\r\n    and powerful mind which disclosed all, that delicate and\r\n    subtle mind which understood all; those revelations made by a\r\n    trained genius to a youthful intelligence worthy to receive\r\n    them: all this formed a union which it is impossible to\r\n    describe without having had the happiness to witness it one's\r\n    self.\r\n\r\n    \"The friendship of Madame Récamier for Madame de Staël was\r\n    strengthened by a sentiment which they both entertained:\r\n    filial love. Madame Récamier was fondly attached to her\r\n    mother, a woman of rare merit, whose health was already\r\n    giving rise to fears and whose loss her daughter has never\r\n    since ceased to regret. Madame de Staël had vowed a worship\r\n    to her father which his death has rendered but the more\r\n    exalted. Always overpowering in her manner of expressing\r\n    herself, she becomes still more so, above all, when speaking\r\n    of him. Her earnest voice, her eyes ready to grow wet with\r\n    tears, the sincerity of her enthusiasm moved the soul of even\r\n    those who did not share her opinion of that celebrated man.\r\n    Ridicule has frequently been cast on the praises which she\r\n    has awarded him in her writings; but, when you have heard her\r\n    on that subject, it is not possible to make it an object of\r\n    mockery, for nothing that is true is ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Staël.]\r\n\r\nThe letters of Corinne to her friend Madame Récamier began at the\r\nperiod here recalled by Benjamin Constant: they have a charm which is\r\nalmost akin to love; I will set forth a few:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"COPPET, 9 _September._\r\n\r\n    \"Do you recollect, fair Juliet, a person whom you loaded\r\n    with marks of interest last winter and who is bold enough to\r\n    invite you to do twice as much in the winter to come? How\r\n    do you govern the empire of beauty? One awards it you with\r\n    pleasure, that empire, because you are eminently good, and it\r\n    seems natural that so gentle a soul should have a charming\r\n    face to express it. Of all your admirers you know that I\r\n    prefer Adrien de Montmorency[349]. I have received letters\r\n    from him, remarkable for wit and grace, and I believe in the\r\n    solidity of his affections, notwithstanding the charm of his\r\n    manners. For the rest, that word 'solidity' suits me, who\r\n    claim to play but a very secondary part in his heart. But\r\n    you, who are the heroine of every sentiment, are exposed to\r\n    the great events out of which tragedies and novels are made.\r\n    Mine[350] is progressing at the foot of the Alps.

Are you still at\r\n    Clichy? In short, I ask for details of yourself. I love to\r\n    know what you are doing, to represent to myself the places in\r\n    which you dwell. Is not all a picture in the memories which\r\n    one retains of you? I add to this natural enthusiasm for your\r\n    rare advantages a great inclination for your company. Pray\r\n    accept kindly all that I offer you, and promise me that we\r\n    shall meet often in the coming winter.\"\r\n\r\n    \"COPPET, 30 _April._\r\n\r\n    \"Do you know, fair Juliet, that my friends have been\r\n    flattering me somewhat with the notion that you might come\r\n    here? Could you not give me that great pleasure? It is some\r\n    time since happiness spoilt me, and your arrival would be a\r\n    return of luck and would give me hopes for all that I desire.\r\n    Adrien and Mathieu say they will come. If you came with them,\r\n    a month's stay here would serve to show you our splendid\r\n    nature. My father says that you ought to choose Coppet for\r\n    your residence and that we should make our excursions from\r\n    there. My father is very eager in his desire to see you. You\r\n    know what they said of Homer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Par la voix des vieillards tu louais la beauté[351].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And independently of that beauty you are charming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the short Peace of Amiens[352], Madame Récamier took a journey\r\nto London with her mother. She had letters of introduction from the\r\nold Duc de Guignes, who had been Ambassador to England thirty years\r\nbefore. He had kept up a correspondence with the most brilliant women\r\nof the time: the Duchess of Devonshire[353], Lady Melbourne[354], the\r\nMarchioness of Salisbury[355], the Margravine of Anspach, with whom he\r\nhad been in love. His embassy was still celebrated, his memory green\r\namong those respectable ladies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame Récamier in London.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of novelty in England that, on the morning after\r\nher arrival, the newspapers were full of the foreign beauty. Madame\r\nRécamier received visits from nearly all the persons to whom she had\r\nsent letters. Among these persons, the most remarkable was the Duchess\r\nof Devonshire, then between forty-five and fifty years of age. She was\r\nstill in vogue and beautiful, although she had lost one eye, which\r\nshe concealed behind a lock of her hair. The first time that Madame\r\nRécamier appeared in public, it was in her company. The duchess took\r\nher to the Opera in her box, in which were the Prince of Wales, the Duc\r\nd'Orléans and his brothers the Duc de Montpensier[356] and the Comte\r\nde Beaujolais[357]: the first two were to become kings; one was on\r\nthe verge of the throne, the other was still separated from it by an\r\nabyss[358].\r\n\r\nEyes and opera-glasses were turned on the duchess' box. The Prince\r\nof Wales said to Madame Récamier that, if she did not want to be\r\nsuffocated, she must leave before the end of the performance.\r\nScarcely was she on her feet, before the doors of the boxes opened\r\nprecipitously; she escaped nothing, and was carried by the tide of the\r\ncrowd to her carriage.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Madame Récamier went to Kensington Gardens, accompanied\r\nby the Marquess of Douglas, later Duke of Hamilton[359], who has since\r\nreceived Charles X. at Holyrood[360], and by his sister the Duchess\r\nof Somerset[361]. The crowd flung itself on the fair foreigner's\r\nfootsteps. This effect was repeated each time she showed herself in\r\npublic; the newspapers resounded with her name; her portrait, engraved\r\nby Bartolozzi[362], was spread broadcast through England. The author\r\nof Antigone, M. Ballanche, adds that ships carried it as far as the\r\nisles of Greece: beauty returned to the spots where its image had been\r\ninvented. We have a sketch of Madame Récamier by David, a full-length\r\nportrait by Gérard, a bust by Canova. The portrait is Gérard's\r\nmaster-piece; but it does not please me, because I recognise the\r\nmodel's features in it without recognising the expression.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of Madame Récamier's departure, the Prince of Wales and the\r\nDuchess of Devonshire asked leave to call on her and to bring with them\r\nsome persons of their society. Music was performed. Together with the\r\nChevalier Marin, the first harper of the time, she played variations on\r\na theme by Mozart. This evening was mentioned in the public press as\r\na concert which the beautiful foreigner had given, on leaving, to the\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe next day, she set sail for the Hague and took three days to make\r\na crossing of sixteen hours. She has told me that, during those days\r\ndashed with storms, she read the _Génie du Christianisme_ straight\r\nthrough; I was \"revealed\" to her, to use her kind expression: I\r\nrecognise in this the good-will which the winds and the sea have always\r\nhad for me.\r\n\r\nNear the Hague, she visited the country-house of the Prince of Orange.\r\nThe Prince, having made her promise to go to see that residence, wrote\r\nher several letters in which he speaks of his reverses and of his hope\r\nto conquer them: William I. has, in fact, become a monarch[363]; at\r\nthat time one intrigued to become king as nowadays to become a deputy,\r\nand those candidates for the sovereignty used to throng round the feet\r\nof Madame Récamier as though she had crowns in her gift.\r\n\r\nThe following note from Bernadotte, who reigns to-day over Sweden[364],\r\nended Madame Récamier's journey to England: . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The English papers, while calming my apprehensions for\r\n    your health, have informed me of the dangers to which you\r\n    have been exposed. I at first blamed the people of London\r\n    for their too great assiduity, but, I confess to you, I\r\n    soon excused them, for I am an interested party when it is\r\n    necessary to justify persons who become indiscreet in order\r\n    to admire the charms of your celestial countenance.\r\n\r\n    \"Amid the lustre which surrounds you and which you deserve by\r\n    such manifold rights, deign sometimes to remember that the\r\n    being most devoted to you in nature is\r\n\r\n    \"BERNADOTTE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Staël's exil.]\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël, threatened with exile, attempted to settle down at\r\nMaffliers, a country-place eight leagues from Paris. She accepted the\r\nproposal made to her by Madame Récamier, on her return from England, to\r\nspend a few days with her at Saint-Brice; afterwards she went back to\r\nher first refuge. She relates what happened then, in the _Dix années\r\nd'exil_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I was at table,\" she says, \"with three of my friends in a\r\n    room from which one saw the high road and the entrance-door.\r\n    It was at the end of September[365], at four o'clock: a man\r\n    in grey, on horseback, stopped and rang; I was sure of my\r\n    fate; he asked for me; I received him in the garden. As I\r\n    went towards him, I was struck by the scent of the flowers\r\n    and the beauty of the sun. The sensations that come to us\r\n    through the combinations of society are so different from\r\n    those of nature! The man told me that he was the commandant\r\n    of the Versailles Gendarmery.... He showed me a letter,\r\n    signed by Bonaparte, which contained the order to remove me\r\n    to forty leagues from Paris, with an injunction to make me\r\n    leave within twenty-four hours, while treating me, however,\r\n    with all the consideration due to a woman whose name was\r\n    known.... I replied to the officer of gendarmes that to set\r\n    out within twenty-four hours might suit conscripts, but not\r\n    a woman and children. Consequently I proposed that he should\r\n    accompany me to Paris, where I had need of three days to make\r\n    the necessary arrangements for my journey. I therefore got\r\n    into my carriage with my children and this officer, who had\r\n    been selected as being the most literary of the gendarmes. In\r\n    fact, he paid me compliments on my writings.\r\n\r\n    \"'You see, monsieur,' I said to him, 'what comes of being an\r\n    intellectual woman. I beg you, dissuade the members of your\r\n    family from it, if you have occasion to do so.'\r\n\r\n    \"I tried to rouse myself with pride, but I felt the clutching\r\n    at my heart.\r\n\r\n    \"I stopped for a few moments at Madame Récamier's. I there\r\n    found General Junot[366], who, out of devotion for her,\r\n    promised to go the next day to speak to the First Consul. He\r\n    did so in fact with the greatest warmth....\r\n\r\n    \"On the eve of the last day given me, Joseph Bonaparte made\r\n    yet one attempt....\r\n\r\n    \"I was obliged to await the answer in an inn at two leagues\r\n    from Paris, not daring to return to my own home in town. A\r\n    day passed without the answer reaching me. Not wishing to\r\n    attract attention by remaining longer at the inn where I was,\r\n    I made the circuit of the walls of Paris to go to look for\r\n    another, also at two leagues from Paris, but on a different\r\n    road. This wandering life, at four steps from my friends and\r\n    my home, caused me a grief which I cannot recall without\r\n    shuddering[367].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël, instead of returning to Coppet, set out on her first\r\njourney to Germany. At that time she wrote me the letter on the death\r\nof Madame de Beaumont which I quoted when writing of my first journey\r\nto Rome.\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier gathered round her in Paris all that was most\r\ndistinguished in the oppressed parties and in the opinions which had\r\nnot yielded to victory. One saw there the lights of the old Monarchy\r\nand the new Empire: the Montmorencys, the Sabrans[368], the Lamoignons,\r\nGenerals Masséna, Moreau and Bernadotte; one destined for exile,\r\nanother for the throne. Illustrious foreigners also visited there: the\r\nPrince of Orange, the Prince of Bavaria[369], the brother[370] of the\r\nQueen of Prussia surrounded her, just as in London the Prince of Wales\r\nwas proud to carry her shawl. So irresistible was the attraction that\r\nEugène de Beauharnais[371] and the Emperor's very ministers went to\r\nthese assemblies. Bonaparte could not suffer success, even when it was\r\na woman's. He used to say:\r\n\r\n\"Since how long has the Council been held at Madame Récamier's?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Bernadotte.]\r\n\r\nI now return to Benjamin Constant:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"For a long time, Bonaparte, who had seized upon the\r\n    government, had been progressing towards tyranny. The most\r\n    opposite parties became incensed against him and, while\r\n    the bulk of the citizens were still allowing themselves to\r\n    be enervated by the tranquillity which was promised them,\r\n    the Republicans and the Royalists desired an inversion. M.\r\n    de Montmorency belonged to the latter by his birth, his\r\n    connections and his opinions. Madame Récamier cared for\r\n    politics only through her generous interest in the vanquished\r\n    of all parties. The independence of her character made her\r\n    averse to the Court of Napoleon, of which she had refused to\r\n    form part M. de Montmorency conceived the idea of confiding\r\n    his hopes to her, painted the restoration of the Bourbons\r\n    to her in colours calculated to arouse her enthusiasm,\r\n    and charged her to bring together two men at that time of\r\n    importance in France, Moreau and Bernadotte, to see if they\r\n    could unite against Bonaparte. She was intimately acquainted\r\n    with Bernadotte, who has since become Prince Royal of Sweden.\r\n    Something chivalrous in his appearance, something noble in\r\n    his manners, something very subtle in his intelligence,\r\n    something declamatory in his conversation make him a\r\n    remarkable man. Courageous in battle, bold in speech, but\r\n    timid in actions which are not military, irresolute in all\r\n    his designs, he has one thing which makes him very seductive\r\n    at first sight, but which, at the same time, places an\r\n    obstacle to any combination of plans with him, and that is a\r\n    habit of haranguing, a relic of his revolutionary education\r\n    which does not leave him. He sometimes has movements of real\r\n    eloquence; he knows it, he loves this kind of success and,\r\n    when he has entered upon the development of some general idea\r\n    connected with what he has heard in the clubs or the rostrum,\r\n    he loses sight of all that occupies him and is no longer\r\n    anything but an impassioned orator. That is what he appeared\r\n    in France during the early years of the reign of Bonaparte,\r\n    whom he always hated and by whom he was suspected, and that\r\n    again is what he has shown himself in these later days, amid\r\n    the disorder of Europe, of which, nevertheless, we owe the\r\n    liberation to him, because he reassured the foreigners by\r\n    showing them a Frenchman ready to march against the tyrant of\r\n    France and knowing how to say only such things as could have\r\n    an influence for his nation's good.\r\n\r\n    \"Anything that offers a woman the means of exercising power\r\n    is always agreeable to her. Moreover, in the idea of rousing\r\n    against the despotism of Bonaparte men important through\r\n    their dignities and their glory there was something generous\r\n    and noble which was bound to tempt Madame Récamier. She\r\n    therefore lent herself to M. de Montmorency's wishes. She\r\n    often threw Bernadotte and Moreau together at her house.\r\n    Moreau wavered, Bernadotte spouted. Madame Récamier took\r\n    Moreau's indecisive speeches for a commencement of resolution\r\n    and Bernadotte's harangues as a signal for the overthrow of\r\n    tyranny. The two generals, on their side, were enraptured\r\n    to see their discontent pampered by so much beauty, wit and\r\n    grace. There was, in fact, something romantic and poetic in\r\n    that young and bewitching woman who talked to them of the\r\n    liberty of their country. Bernadotte never ceased repeating\r\n    to Madame Récamier that she was made to electrify the world\r\n    and create fanatics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile noting the delicacy of this portraiture by Benjamin Constant,\r\nit must be said that Madame Récamier would never have entered into\r\npolitical interests but for the irritation which she felt at the\r\nbanishment of Madame de Staël. The future King of Sweden had a list\r\nof the generals who still held with the party of independence, but\r\nMoreau's name was not on it; it was the only one fit to be opposed\r\nto Napoleon's, only Bernadotte did not know what manner of man the\r\nBonaparte was whose power he was attacking.\r\n\r\nMadame Moreau[372] gave a ball: all Europe was there, excepting France,\r\nwhich was represented only by the Republican Opposition. In the course\r\nof this entertainment, General Bernadotte led Madame Récamier to a\r\nlittle drawing-room where only the sound of the music followed them to\r\nremind them where they were. Moreau passed into this drawing-room;\r\nBernadotte said to him, after long explanations:\r\n\r\n\"You have a popular name; you are the only one of us who can put\r\nhimself forward with the support of the people; see what you can do,\r\nwhat we can do under your leader-ship.\"\r\n\r\nMoreau repeated what he had often said before, that \"he felt the danger\r\nwith which liberty was threatened, that they must watch Bonaparte, but\r\nthat he feared civil war.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation was prolonged and became animated; Bernadotte lost\r\nhis temper, and said to General Moreau: \"You do not dare to take up the\r\ncause of liberty; well, then, Bonaparte will make sport of liberty and\r\nyou. It will perish in spite of our efforts and, as for you, you will\r\nbe involved in its ruin without having fought.\"\r\n\r\nProphetic words!\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier's mother was intimately acquainted with Madame Hulot,\r\nthe mother of Madame Moreau, and Madame Récamier had contracted with\r\nthe latter one of those childish friendships which it is a pleasure to\r\ncontinue in after life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The trial of General Moreau.]\r\n\r\nDuring General Moreau's trial, Madame Récamier spent all her time\r\nwith Madame Moreau. The latter told her friend that her husband\r\ncomplained that he had not yet seen her among the public which filled\r\nthe court and the bench. Madame Récamier arranged to be present at\r\nthe sitting on the day after this conversation. One of the judges, M.\r\nBrillat-Savarin[373], undertook to pass her in through a private door\r\nwhich opened on to the amphitheatre of the court. She raised her veil,\r\non entering, and cast a glance over the rows of prisoners in order to\r\nfind Moreau. He recognised her, rose and bowed. All eyes were turned in\r\nher direction; she hastened to descend the steps of the amphitheatre\r\nto reach the place intended for her. The prisoners were forty-seven\r\nin number; they filled the benches placed opposite the judges of the\r\ncourt. Each prisoner was placed between two gendarmes: the soldiers\r\ntreated General Moreau with deference and respect.\r\n\r\nMessieurs de Polignac and de Rivière attracted attention, but\r\nespecially Georges Cadoudal. Pichegru, whose name will remain\r\nassociated with that of Moreau, was missing from his side, or, rather,\r\none seemed to see his shadow there, for it was known that he was also\r\nmissing from prison[374].\r\n\r\nThere was no more question of Republicans: it was Royalist loyalty\r\nfighting against the new power; nevertheless, this cause of the\r\nLegitimacy and of its high-born partisans had, as its leader, a man of\r\nthe people, Georges Cadoudal. One saw him there, with the thought that\r\nthat so pious and so fearless head was about to fall on the scaffold,\r\nthat he, Cadoudal, alone, perhaps, would not be saved, for he would\r\ndo nothing to be saved. He defended only his friends; as for what\r\nconcerned him in particular, he told all. Bonaparte was not so generous\r\nas people supposed: eleven persons devoted to Georges perished with\r\nhim[375].\r\n\r\nMoreau did not speak. At the end of the sitting, the judge who had\r\nbrought Madame Récamier came to take her away. She crossed the bar\r\nat the opposite side to that by which she had entered, and passed by\r\nthe bench of the prisoners. Moreau came down, followed by his two\r\ngendarmes; he was separated from her only by a hand-rail. He addressed\r\na few words to her, which, in her startled condition, she did not hear;\r\nshe tried to reply, her voice broke.\r\n\r\nTo-day, when the times are changed and when Bonaparte's name alone\r\nseems to fill them, we do not conceive how small a hold his power as\r\nyet had. On the night preceding the sentence, during which the court\r\nsat, all Paris was on foot. Floods of people went towards the Palace of\r\nJustice. Georges wanted no mercy; he replied to them who wished to ask\r\nit for him:\r\n\r\n\"Do you promise me a finer occasion of death?\"\r\n\r\nMoreau, condemned to transportation, set out for Cadiz, whence he was\r\nto cross to America. Madame Moreau went to join him. Madame Récamier\r\nwas with her at her departure. She saw her kiss her son in his cradle\r\nand saw her turn back again to kiss him a second time; she took her to\r\nher carriage, and received her last farewell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from General Moreau.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Moreau wrote the following letter from Cadiz to his generous\r\nfriend:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"CHICLANA (near Cadiz), 12 _October_ 1804.\r\n\r\n    \"MADAME,\r\n\r\n    \"You will, no doubt, be pleased to hear news of two fugitives\r\n    in whom you have shown so much interest. After going through\r\n    all sorts of fatigues, by land and sea, we were hoping to\r\n    rest at Cadiz, when the yellow fever, which in some way may\r\n    be compared to the ills we had recently undergone, came to\r\n    besiege us in that town.\r\n\r\n    \"Although my wife's confinement obliged us to remain there\r\n    for more than a month during the sickness, we were lucky\r\n    enough to escape infection; only one of our servants caught\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    \"At last we are at Chiclana, a very pretty village at a few\r\n    leagues from Cadiz, enjoying good health, and my wife quite\r\n    convalescent, after giving me a very healthy daughter.\r\n\r\n    \"She is persuaded that you take as great an interest in this\r\n    event as in all that has happened to us, and she asks me to\r\n    acquaint you with it and to send you her kind remembrances.\r\n\r\n    \"I say nothing of the kind of life which we lead: it is\r\n    excessively tedious and monotonous, but at least we breathe\r\n    at liberty, although in the land of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you, madame, to receive the assurance of my respectful\r\n    attachment, and to believe me ever\r\n\r\n    \"Your most humble and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"V. MOREAU.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is dated from Chiclana, a spot which, together with glory,\r\nseemed to promise an assured reign to M. le Duc d'Angoulême: and yet\r\nhe appeared on that coast only with as fatal a result as Moreau, who\r\nhas been believed devoted to the Bourbons. Moreau, in the depths of\r\nhis soul, was devoted to liberty; when he had the misfortune to join\r\nthe Coalition, the question in his eyes was solely that of contending\r\nagainst the despotism of Bonaparte. Louis XVIII. said to M. de\r\nMontmorency, who was deploring the death of Moreau as a great loss to\r\nthe Crown:\r\n\r\n\"Not so great: Moreau was a Republican.\"\r\n\r\nThe general returned to Europe only to find the cannon-ball on which\r\nhis name was engraved by the finger of God.\r\n\r\nMoreau recalls to my mind another illustrious captain, Masséna. The\r\nlatter was going to the Army of Italy; he asked Madame Récamier for a\r\nwhite ribbon from the trimming of her dress. One day she received this\r\nnote in Masséna's hand:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The charming ribbon given him by Madame Récamier was worn by\r\n    General Masséna in the battles and the blockade of Genoa: it\r\n    never left the general and constantly promoted his victory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old manners peep out through the new manners of which they form the\r\nground-work. The gallantry of the knight of gentle birth appeared again\r\nin the plebeian soldier: the memory of the tournaments and crusades lay\r\nhidden in the feats of arms with which modern France has crowned her\r\nancient victories. Cisher, the companion of Charlemagne, did not deck\r\nhimself in the fight with his lady's colours:\r\n\r\n\"He carried,\" says the Monk of Saint-Gall[376], \"seven, eight, or even\r\nnine enemies strung on his lance.\"\r\n\r\nCisher went before and Masséna came after chivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël in Berlin heard of her father's illness; she hurried\r\nback, but M. Necker was dead[377] before she reached Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAt that time happened M. Récamier's ruin[378]; Madame de Staël was\r\nsoon informed of this unfortunate event. She at once wrote to Madame\r\nRécamier, her friend:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter from Madame de Staël.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"GENEVA, 17 _November._[379]\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, my dear Juliet, what pain have I felt at the shocking\r\n    news that reaches me! How I curse the exile which does not\r\n    permit me to be with you, to press you to my heart! You have\r\n    lost all that has to do with the ease and comfort of life;\r\n    but, if it were possible to be more loved, more interesting\r\n    than you are, that is what would have happened to you. I am\r\n    going to write to M. Récamier, whom I pity and respect. But,\r\n    tell me, would it be a dream to hope to see you here this\r\n    winter? If you were willing, three months spent here, in a\r\n    narrow circle where you would be passionately cared for:\r\n    but in Paris also you inspire that feeling. At any rate, I\r\n    will come to see you at Lyons, or anywhere outside my 'forty\r\n    leagues,' to embrace you, to tell you that I have felt more\r\n    tenderness for you than for any woman I have ever known. I\r\n    can say nothing to you by way of consolation, unless it be\r\n    that you will be loved and valued more than ever and that\r\n    the admirable features of your generosity and benevolence\r\n    will be known, in spite of yourself, through this misfortune,\r\n    as they never would have been without it. Certainly, to\r\n    compare your situation with what it was, you have lost; but\r\n    if it were possible for me to envy what I love, I would give\r\n    all that I am to be you. A beauty unmatched in Europe, a\r\n    stainless reputation, a proud and generous character, what a\r\n    fortune of happiness that remains in this sad life through\r\n    which we go so naked! Dear Juliet, let our friendship draw\r\n    closer; let it consist not only of generous services, which\r\n    have all come from you, but of a sustained correspondence, a\r\n    reciprocal desire to confide our thoughts in one another, a\r\n    life together. Dear Juliet, you shall make me come back to\r\n    Paris, for you are still an all-powerful person, and we shall\r\n    see each other every day; and, as you are younger than I, you\r\n    shall close my eyes, and my children shall be your friends.\r\n    My daughter cried this morning at my tears and yours. Dear\r\n    Juliet, we both enjoyed the luxury that surrounded you; your\r\n    fortune was ours, and I feel myself ruined because you are no\r\n    longer rich. Believe me, some happiness remains when one has\r\n    made herself loved thus.\r\n\r\n    \"Benjamin wants to write to you; he is much upset. Mathieu de\r\n    Montmorency has written me a very touching letter about you.\r\n    Dear friend, may your heart remain calm amid so many sorrows.\r\n    Alas, neither the death nor the indifference of your friends\r\n    threaten you, and those are the eternal wounds. Adieu, dear\r\n    angel, adieu! Respectfully I kiss your charming face....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier now became the object of a new interest: she left\r\nsociety without complaining and seemed as much made for solitude as for\r\nthe world. Her friends remained to her, \"and this time,\" M. Ballanche\r\nhas said, \"fortune withdrew alone.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël drew her friend to Coppet[380]. Prince Augustus of\r\nPrussia, captured at the Battle of Eylau[381], passed through Geneva on\r\nhis way to Italy: he fell in love with Madame Récamier. The intimate\r\nand private life that belongs to every man continued its course beneath\r\nthe general life, the blood of battles and the transformation of\r\nempires. The rich man, on waking, beholds his gilded panellings, the\r\npoor man his smoky rafters: there is but one sun-ray to give light to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nPrince Augustus, believing that Madame Récamier might consent to a\r\ndivorce, proposed to her in marriage. A record of this passion remains\r\nin the picture of Corinne, which the Prince obtained from Gérard; he\r\nmade a present of it to Madame Récamier as an undying reminder of the\r\nfeeling with which she had inspired him and of the intimate friendship\r\nwhich united Corinne and Juliet.\r\n\r\nThe summer was spent in merry-making: the world was upset; but it\r\nhappens that the echo of public catastrophes, mingling with the joys of\r\nyouth, redoubles their charm; we surrender ourselves the more eagerly\r\nto pleasures the nearer we feel to losing them.\r\n\r\nMadame de Genlis has made a novel out of this attachment of Prince\r\nAugustus. I found her one day in the throes of composition. She\r\nwas living at the Arsenal, surrounded by dusty books, in a gloomy\r\napartment. She expected nobody; she was dressed in a black gown; her\r\nwhite hair obscured her face; she held a harp between her knees, and\r\nher head was sunk upon her breast. Hanging on to the strings of the\r\ninstrument, she allowed her pale and emaciated hands to wander on\r\neither side of the sonorous wire-work, from which she drew feeble\r\nsounds, resembling the distant and undefinable voices of death. What\r\nwas the ancient sybil singing? She was singing Madame Récamier. She\r\nhad at first hated her, but had later been conquered by beauty and\r\ndistress. Madame de Genlis had just finished this page on Madame\r\nRécamier, giving her the name of Athenais:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince Augustus of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Prince entered the drawing-room, with Madame de Staël\r\n    showing him the way. Suddenly the door half opened, and\r\n    Athenais advanced. By the elegance of her figure, by the\r\n    dazzling brilliancy of her features, the Prince could not\r\n    fail to recognise her, but he had formed a quite different\r\n    idea of her: he had represented this woman to himself as\r\n    famous for her beauty, as proud of her successes, with an\r\n    assumed bearing and the kind of confidence which that sort\r\n    of celebrity only too often gives; and he saw a timid young\r\n    person step forward with embarrassment and blush as she\r\n    appeared. The sweetest sentiment mingled with his surprise.\r\n\r\n    \"After dinner, they did not go out, because of the excessive\r\n    heat; they went down into the gallery to make music until the\r\n    time came to take the air. After a few brilliant chords and\r\n    harmonious sounds of entrancing sweetness, Athenais sang to\r\n    her own accompaniment on the harp. The Prince listened to her\r\n    with rapture and, when she had finished, looked at her with\r\n    inexpressible commotion, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n    \"'And such talents!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël, in her maturity, loved Madame Récamier: Madame de\r\nGenlis, in her decrepitude, found back for her the accents of her\r\nyouth; the author of _Mademoiselle de Clermont_[382] lays the scene of\r\nher novel[383] at Coppet, with the author of _Corinne_, a rival whom\r\nshe detested: that was one wonder. Another wonder is to see me writing\r\nthese details. I am turning over letters which remind me of times in\r\nwhich I lived solitary and unknown. There was happiness without me on\r\nthe shores of Coppet, which I have not seen since without a certain\r\nmovement of envy. The things which have escaped me on earth, which\r\nhave fled from me, which I regret, would kill me, were I not so near\r\nmy tomb; but, at this short distance from eternal oblivion, truths and\r\ndreams are equally vain: at the end of one's life, all is time lost.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël set out a second time for Germany[384]. Here begins\r\nagain a series of letters to Madame Récamier, perhaps even more\r\ncharming than the first.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Madame de Staël's printed works which approaches\r\nthis naturalness, this eloquence, in which imagination lends its\r\nexpression to the feelings. The virtue of Madame Récamier's friendship\r\nmust have been great, since it was able to make a woman of genius\r\nproduce what was hidden and, as yet, unrevealed in her talent. We\r\ndivine, moreover, in the sad accent of Madame de Staël a secret\r\ndispleasure, of which the beauty would naturally be the confidant, she\r\nwho could never receive like wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël, having returned to France, came, in the spring of\r\n1810[385], to live at the Château de Chaumont[386], on the banks of the\r\nLoire, at forty leagues from Paris, the distance fixed by the radius of\r\nher banishment. Madame Récamier joined her at that country-house.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël was at that time supervising the impression of her work\r\non Germany; when it was on the point of publication, she sent it to\r\nBonaparte with this letter:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Staël to Napoleon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"SIRE,\r\n\r\n    \"I take the liberty of presenting to Your Majesty my work on\r\n    Germany. If you deign to read it, it seems to me that you\r\n    will find in it proof of a mind capable of some reflection\r\n    and ripened by time. Sire, it is twelve years since I\r\n    saw Your Majesty and since I was exiled. Twelve years of\r\n    misfortune modify all characters, and destiny teaches\r\n    resignation to those who suffer. Prepared to put to sea, I\r\n    beseech Your Majesty to grant me half-an-hour's conversation.\r\n    I believe that I have things to tell you which may interest\r\n    you, and it is on that score that I beseech you to grant\r\n    me the favour of speaking to you before my departure. I\r\n    will allow myself only one thing in this letter, which is\r\n    an explanation of the motives which oblige me to leave the\r\n    Continent, if I do not obtain permission from Your Majesty to\r\n    live at a country-place near enough to Paris for my children\r\n    to stay there. Your Majesty's disgrace casts so great a\r\n    disfavour in Europe upon the persons who are its object,\r\n    that I cannot take a step without encountering its effects.\r\n    Some fear to compromise themselves by seeing me, others\r\n    think themselves Romans when triumphing over that fear.\r\n    The simplest social relations become services which a proud\r\n    mind cannot put up with. Among my friends are some who have\r\n    allied themselves to my lot with admirable generosity; but\r\n    I have seen the most intimate sentiments shattered against\r\n    the necessity to live with me in solitude, and I have spent\r\n    my life during the past eight years between the dread of not\r\n    obtaining sacrifices and the sorrow of being the object of\r\n    them. It is perhaps ridiculous thus to enter into details of\r\n    one's impressions with the sovereign of the world; but that\r\n    which gave you the world, Sire, is a sovereign genius. And,\r\n    in respect of observation of the human heart, Your Majesty's\r\n    comprehension embraces the greatest and the most delicate\r\n    springs. My sons have no career, my daughter is thirteen\r\n    years of age; in a few years it will be necessary to settle\r\n    her: it would be selfish to compel her to live in the insipid\r\n    residences to which I am condemned. I shall therefore have\r\n    to part from her, alas! This life is unendurable, and I know\r\n    no remedy for it on the Continent. What city can I choose in\r\n    which Your Majesty's disgrace does not place an invincible\r\n    obstacle to both the settling of my children and my personal\r\n    repose? Your Majesty is not yourself, perhaps, aware of the\r\n    fear which most of the authorities of every country entertain\r\n    of exiles, and in this connection I should have things to\r\n    tell you which surely exceed what you may have ordered. Your\r\n    Majesty has been told that I regretted Paris because of the\r\n    Museum and Talma: this is an agreeable jest upon exile, in\r\n    other words upon the misfortune which Cicero and Bolingbroke\r\n    have declared to be the most insupportable of all; but, if I\r\n    were to love the master-pieces of art which France owes to\r\n    Your Majesty's conquests, if I were to love those beautiful\r\n    tragedies, the images of heroism: would it be for you, Sire,\r\n    to blame me for it? Is not the happiness of each individual\r\n    compounded of the nature of his faculties? And, if Heaven has\r\n    given me talents, have I not the imagination which renders\r\n    the enjoyment of the arts and the mind necessary? So many\r\n    people ask of Your Majesty real advantages of every kind!\r\n    Why should I blush to ask of you friendship, poetry, music,\r\n    pictures, all that ideal existence which I can enjoy without\r\n    swerving from the submission which I owe to the Monarch of\r\n    France?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unpublished letter was worth preserving[387]. Madame de Staël\r\nwas not, as has been contended, a blind and implacable enemy. She was\r\nlistened to no more than I, when I also saw myself obliged to write to\r\nBonaparte to ask him for the life of my cousin Armand. Alexander and\r\nCæsar would have been touched by this letter so lofty in tone, written\r\nby so famous a woman; but the confidence of the merit which judges\r\nitself the equal of the supreme dominion, that sort of familiarity of\r\nthe intellect which places itself on the level of the master of Europe\r\nto treat with him as from crown to crown appeared to Bonaparte but\r\nthe arrogance of a disordered self-esteem. He thought himself set at\r\ndefiance by all that had any independent greatness; to him baseness\r\nseemed fidelity, pride revolt: he did not know that true talent\r\nrecognises no Napoleons save in genius, that it has its right of entry\r\ninto the palaces as into the temples, because it is immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël left Chaumont and returned to Coppet[388]; Madame\r\nRécamier again hastened to go to her; M. Mathieu de Montmorency also\r\nremained devoted to her. Both were punished for it; they were smitten\r\nwith the very penalty which they had gone to console: the forty\r\nleagues' distance from Paris was inflicted on them[389].\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier retired to Châlons-sur-Marne[390] influenced in her\r\nselection by its propinquity to Montmirail[391], where Messieurs de La\r\nRochefoucauld-Doudeauville resided.\r\n\r\nA thousand details of Bonaparte's oppression have become lost in the\r\ngeneral tyranny: the persecuted persons dreaded to see their friends\r\nfor fear of compromising them; their friends dared not visit them, for\r\nfear of drawing down upon them some increase of severity. The unhappy\r\noutlaw, becoming as one infected with the plague, lived sequestered\r\nfrom the human race, in quarantine in the despot's hatred. You were\r\nwell received so long as your independence of opinion was unknown; so\r\nsoon as it became known, every one drew back; there remained around you\r\nnone save authorities spying on your connections, your feelings, your\r\ncorrespondence, your proceedings: such were those times of honour and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël's letters reveal the sufferings of that period, in\r\nwhich talents were at each moment threatened with a dungeon, in which\r\none busied one's self only with the means of escaping, in which one\r\naspired to flight as to a deliverance: when liberty has disappeared\r\nthere remains a country, but no more mother-land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Staël's marriage.]\r\n\r\nWhen writing to her friend that she did not wish to see her, from\r\napprehension of the evil which she might bring upon her, Madame de\r\nStaël did not say all: she was secretly married to M. de Rocca[392],\r\nwhence resulted a complication of difficulties by which the imperial\r\npolice profited. Madame Récamier, from whom Madame de Staël thought it\r\nright to conceal her new cares, was astonished, with good reason, at\r\nthe stubbornness which she displayed in forbidding her the entry of her\r\nplace at Coppet: though wounded by the resistance of Madame de Staël,\r\nfor whom she had already sacrificed herself, she persisted in her\r\nresolve to join her.\r\n\r\nAll the letters which ought to have restrained Madame Récamier only\r\nserved to confirm her in her intention; she started and, at Dijon,\r\nreceived this fatal note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I bid you adieu, dear angel of my life, with all the\r\n    tenderness of my soul. I recommend Auguste[393] to you:\r\n    let him see you and then let him see me again. You are a\r\n    celestial creature. If I had lived in your company, I should\r\n    have been too happy: fate carries me away. Adieu[394].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël was to meet Juliet again only to die. Her note struck\r\nthe traveller with a thunder-bolt: to fly suddenly, to depart before\r\npressing in her arms her who was hastening to fling herself into her\r\nadversity, was not that a cruel resolution on Madame de Staël's part?\r\nIt appeared to Madame Récamier that friendship might have been less\r\n\"carried away by fate.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël went in search of England by way of Germany and Sweden:\r\nthe power of Napoleon was a second sea separating Albion from Europe,\r\neven as the Ocean separates her from the world.\r\n\r\nAuguste, Madame de Staël's son, had lost his brother killed by a\r\nsword-thrust in a duel[395]; he married and had a son: this son, a few\r\nmonths old, followed him into the tomb. With Auguste de Staël the male\r\nposterity of an illustrious woman died out, for it does not revive in\r\nthe honourable, but unknown name of Rocca.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duchesse de Chevreuse.]\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier, left alone and full of regret, first sought a\r\nrefuge in her native town of Lyons[396]: there she met Madame de\r\nChevreuse[397], another exile. Madame de Chevreuse had been forced\r\nby the Emperor and, afterwards, by her own family to enter the new\r\nsociety. You would scarce find an historic name which did not consent\r\nto lose its honour rather than a single forest. Once engaged at the\r\nTuileries, Madame de Chevreuse thought she would be able to hold\r\nsway in a Court newly-issued from the camps: that Court, it is true,\r\nsought to acquaint itself with the airs of olden times, in the hope of\r\ncovering its recent origin; but the plebeian manner was still too rough\r\nto receive lessons from aristocratic impertinence. In a revolution\r\nwhich endures and which has taken its last step, as for instance in\r\nRome, the Patricians, a century after the fall of the Republic, could\r\nresign themselves to being no more than the Senate of the Emperors;\r\nthe past had nought wherewith to reproach the Emperors of the present,\r\nsince that past was finished; every existence was branded with a\r\nlike stigma. But in France the nobles who converted themselves into\r\nchamberlains were in too great a hurry; the new-born Empire disappeared\r\nbefore them, and they found themselves face to face with the old\r\nMonarchy raised to life again.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse, attacked by a disease of the chest, begged and was\r\nrefused the favour of ending her days in Paris; we do not expire when\r\nand where we please: Napoleon, who made so many dead, would never have\r\ndone with them if he had left them the choice of their tomb.\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier succeeded in forgetting her own sorrows only by\r\ninteresting herself in those of others; through the charitable\r\nconnivance of a sister of Mercy, she secretly visited the Spanish\r\nprisoners in Lyons. One of them, brave and handsome, a Christian like\r\nthe Cid, was passing away to God: seated on his straw, he played the\r\nguitar; his sword had betrayed his hand. So soon as he caught sight of\r\nhis benefactress, he sang her ballads of his country, having no other\r\nmeans to thank her. His enfeebled voice and the confused sounds of\r\nthe instrument were lost in the silence of the prison. The soldier's\r\ncomrades, half wrapped in their torn cloaks, their black locks hanging\r\nover their bronzed and emaciated faces, raised eyes, proud of their\r\nCastilian blood, moist with gratitude, on the exile who recalled to\r\nthem a mother, a sister, a sweetheart, and who bore the yoke of the\r\nsame tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard died. He could say with Zarviska, the young and valorous\r\nPolish poet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"An unknown hand shall close my eyes; the tolling of a\r\n    foreign bell shall announce my death, and voices which are\r\n    not those of my country shall pray for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMathieu de Montmorency came to Lyons to visit Madame Récamier. She then\r\nknew M. Camille Jordan and M. Ballanche, both worthy to swell the train\r\nof friendships attached to her noble life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier was too proud to solicit her recall. Fouché had long\r\nand to no purpose urged her to adorn the Court of the Emperor: the\r\ndetails of these palace negociations can be read in the writings of\r\nthe time. Madame Récamier retired to Italy[398]; M. de Montmorency\r\naccompanied her as far as Chambéry. She crossed the rest of the Alps\r\nwith no other travelling-companion than a little niece of seven, to-day\r\nMadame Lenormant[399].\r\n\r\nRome was at that time a French town, the capital of the Department of\r\nthe Tiber. The Pope was repining a prisoner at Fontainebleau, in the\r\npalace of Francis I.\r\n\r\nFouché was on a special mission in Italy and commanded in the city\r\nof the Cæsars, even as the chief of the black eunuchs commands in\r\nAthens: he merely passed through; M. de Norvins[400] was installed in\r\nthe quality of Minister of Police: the movement was bearing upon a\r\ndifferent point in Europe.\r\n\r\nConquered without having seen its second Alaric, the Eternal City lay\r\nsilent, plunged in its ruins. Artists dwelt alone on that heap of\r\ncenturies. Canova received Madame Récamier as though she were a Greek\r\nstatue which France was returning to the Vatican Museum: the pontiff\r\nof the arts, he inaugurated her into the honours of the Capitol in\r\ndeserted Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antonio Canova.]\r\n\r\nCanova had a house at Albano; he offered it to Madame Récamier; she\r\npassed the summer there. The balconied window of her bed-room was one\r\nof those large painter's casements which frame the landscape. It opened\r\nupon the ruins of Pompey's Villa; in the distance, over olive trees,\r\none saw the sun set in the sea. Canova returned at that hour; stirred\r\nby that beautiful sight, he loved to sing, with a Venetian accent and\r\na pleasant voice, the barcarolle, _O pescator dell'onda_; Madame\r\nRécamier accompanied him on the piano. The sculptor of Psyche and the\r\nMagdalen revelled in this harmony, and sought in Juliet's features the\r\ntype of the Beatrix which he was dreaming of one day making. Rome had\r\nof old seen Raphael and Michael Angelo crown their models in poetic\r\norgies, too freely related by Cellini[401]: how much superior to them\r\nwas this pure and decent little scene between an exiled woman and that\r\nsimple and gentle Canova!\r\n\r\nMore solitary than ever, Rome at that moment wore widow's weeds: she no\r\nlonger saw pass, blessing her as they did so, the peaceful sovereigns\r\nwho rejuvenated her old days with all the wonders of the arts. The\r\nnoise of the world had once again withdrawn from her; St. Peter's was\r\ndeserted like the Coliseum.\r\n\r\nI have read the eloquent letters which the most illustrious woman\r\nof our past days wrote to her friend; read the same feelings of\r\ntenderness, expressed with the most charming artlessness, in the\r\nlanguage of Petrarch[402], by the first sculptor of modern times. I\r\nwill not be guilty of the sacrilege of trying to translate them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Domenico, mattina._\r\n\r\n    \"Dio eterno? siamo vivi, o siamo morti? lo voglio esser\r\n    vivo, almeno per scriveri; si, lo vuole il mio cuore, anzi\r\n    mi comanda assolutamente di farlo. Oh! se'l conoscete bene\r\n    a fondo questo povero cuor mio, quanto, quanto mai ve ne\r\n    persuadereste! Ma per disgrazia mia pare ch'egli sia alquanto\r\n    all'oscuro per voi. Pazienza! Ditemi almeno come state di\r\n    saluto, se di più non volete dire; benchè mi abbiate promesso\r\n    di scrivere a di scrivermi dolce. Io davvero che avrei voluto\r\n    vedervi personalmente in questi giorni, ma non vi poteva\r\n    essere alcuna via di poterlo fare; anzi su di questo vi dirò\r\n    a voce delle cose curiose. Convenie dunque che mi contenti, a\r\n    forza, di vidervi in spirito. In questo modo sempre mi siete\r\n    presente, sempre vi veggo, sempre vi parlo, vi dico tante,\r\n    tante cose, ma tutte, tutte al vento, tutte! Pazienza anche\r\n    di questo! gran fatto che la cosa abbia d'andare sempre in\r\n    questo modo! voglio intanto però che siate certa, certissima\r\n    che l'anima mia vi ama molto più assai di quello che mai\r\n    possiate credere ed imaginare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier had succoured the Spanish prisoners in Lyons; another\r\nvictim of the power which struck her enabled her to exercise her\r\ncompassionate humour at Albano: a fisherman, accused of holding\r\nintelligence with the subjects of the Pope, had been tried and\r\nsentenced to death. The inhabitants of Albano entreated the stranger\r\nwho had taken refuge with them to intercede for the unfortunate man.\r\nShe was taken to the gaol; she saw the prisoner; struck by the man's\r\ndespair, she melted into tears. The unhappy man begged her to come\r\nto his assistance, to intercede for him, to save him; his prayer was\r\nthe more harrowing in that it was impossible to snatch him from the\r\npunishment. It was already night, and he was to be shot at sunrise.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Madame Récamier, although persuaded of the uselessness\r\nof her application, did not hesitate. She sent for her carriage and\r\nstepped into it, without the hope which she left to the condemned man.\r\nShe drove through the Campagna infested with brigands, reached Rome,\r\nand failed to find the Director of Police. She waited two hours at\r\nthe Palazzo Fiano, counting the minutes of a life of which the last\r\nwas approaching. When M. de Norvins arrived, she explained to him the\r\nobject of her journey. He replied that the sentence was pronounced and\r\nthat he had not the necessary power to suspend it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Albano fisherman.]\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier set out again heart-broken; the prisoner had ceased\r\nto live when she approached Albano. The inhabitants were awaiting the\r\nFrenchwoman on the road; so soon as they discovered her, they hastened\r\nup to her. The priest who had attended the culprit brought her his last\r\nvows: he thanked _la dama_, whom he had not ceased to seek with his\r\neyes while going to the place of execution; he begged her to pray for\r\nhim: for a Christian has not done with everything and is not beyond\r\nfear when he is no more. Madame Récamier was led by the ecclesiastic to\r\nthe church, where the crowd of handsome Albano peasant-women followed\r\nher. The fisherman had been shot at the hour at which the sun rose upon\r\nthe bark, now unguided, which he had been accustomed to steer over the\r\nseas and upon the shores which he had been accustomed to survey.\r\n\r\nTo become disgusted with conquerors, one must have known all the ills\r\nthey cause, one must have been a witness to the indifference with\r\nwhich men sacrifice to them the most inoffensive creatures in a corner\r\nof the globe in which they have never set foot. Of what consequence to\r\nBonaparte's successes were the days of a poor net-maker in the Papal\r\nStates? Undoubtedly, he never knew that that paltry fisherman existed;\r\namid the clatter of his struggle with kings, he did not so much as know\r\nthe name of his plebeian victim.\r\n\r\nThe world perceives in Napoleon naught save victories; the tears with\r\nwhich the triumphal columns are cemented do not fall from his eyes. And\r\nI, I think that, out of those despised sufferings, those calamities of\r\nthe small and the lowly, are formed, in the councils of Providence, the\r\nsecret causes which hurl the ruler from his pinnacle. When instances\r\nof injustice accumulate in such a way as to bear down the weight of\r\nfortune, the scale descends. There is blood which is dumb and blood\r\nwhich cries out: the blood of the battle-field is drunk in silence by\r\nthe earth; peaceable blood when shed spurts with a moan towards Heaven;\r\nGod receives it and avenges it. Bonaparte slew the Albano fisherman; a\r\nfew months later[403], he was banished among the fishermen of Elba, and\r\nhe died among those of St. Helena.\r\n\r\nDid my vague memory, scarce outlined in Madame Récamier's thoughts,\r\nappear to her amid the plains of the Tiber and the Anio? I had already\r\npassed through those melancholy wastes; I had left a tomb there\r\nhonoured by Juliet's friends. When M. de Montmorin's daughter[404]\r\ndied, in 1803, Madame de Staël and M. Necker wrote me letters of\r\nregret; you have seen those letters. Thus I received at Rome, almost\r\nbefore I knew Madame Récamier, letters dated from Coppet; it was the\r\nfirst sign of an affinity of destiny. Madame Récamier has also told me\r\nthat my Letter of 1804 to M. de Fontanes served her as a guide in 1814,\r\nand that she often read and re-read the following passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Whosoever has no tie left in life should come to live in\r\n    Rome. There he will find for company a land which will feed\r\n    his reflections and occupy his heart, and walks which will\r\n    always say something to him. The stone which he treads under\r\n    foot will speak to him; the dust which the wind raises\r\n    beneath his steps will contain some human greatness. If he\r\n    is unhappy, if he has mingled the ashes of those whom he\r\n    loved with so many illustrious ashes, with what charm will\r\n    he not pass from the sepulchre of the Scipios to the last\r\n    resting-place of a virtuous friend!... If he is a Christian,\r\n    ah! how can he then tear himself away from that land which\r\n    has become his country, from that land which has witnessed\r\n    the birth of a second empire, holier in its cradle, greater\r\n    in its might than that which preceded it, from that land\r\n    where the friends whom we have lost, sleeping with the\r\n    martyrs in the catacombs, under the eye of the Father of the\r\n    Faithful, appear as though they ought to be the first to\r\n    awake in their dust and seem to be nearer to the skies?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, in 1814, I was only a vulgar cicerone to Madame Récamier, the\r\ncommon property of all travellers; more fortunate in 1823, I had ceased\r\nto be a stranger to her and we were able to talk together of the Roman\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Naples, where Madame Récamier went in the autumn[405], the\r\noccupations of solitude ceased. Scarce had she alighted at her inn,\r\nwhen King Joachim's ministers came hastening up. Murat, forgetting the\r\nhand which had changed his whip[406] into a sceptre, was ready to join\r\nthe Coalition. Bonaparte had planted his sword in the middle of Europe,\r\nas the Gauls planted their blade in the middle of the _mallus_[407];\r\naround Napoleon's sword were drawn up in a circle kingdoms which he\r\ndistributed to his family. Caroline[408] had received that of Naples.\r\nMadame Murat was not so elegant an antique cameo as the Princess\r\nBorghese; but she had more expression and more wit than her sister. In\r\nthe firmness of her character one recognised the blood of Napoleon.\r\nIf the diadem had not been for her an ornament for a woman's head, it\r\nwould still have been the emblem of a queen's power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Caroline Murat.]\r\n\r\nCaroline received Madame Récamier with an alacrity which was the more\r\naffectionate that the oppression of tyranny made itself felt as far as\r\nPortici. Nevertheless, the city which possesses Virgil's[409] tomb\r\nand Tasso's[410] cradle, the city in which Horace[411], Livy[412],\r\nBoccaccio[413] and Sannazaro[414] lived, in which Durante[415] and\r\nCimarosa[416] were born, had been beautified by its new master. Order\r\nhad been restored; the _lazzaroni_ no longer played at ball with\r\nhuman heads to amuse Admiral Nelson[417] and Lady Hamilton[418].\r\nThe excavations at Pompeii had been extended; a road wound over the\r\nPosilipo[419], into whose flanks I had penetrated, in 1803[420], to go\r\nto ask at Liternum[421] for Scipio's retreat. Those new royalties of\r\na military dynasty had brought back life to regions in which before\r\nthem the moribund languor of an old race of kings had made itself\r\nmanifest. Robert Guiscard[422], William Iron-arm[423], Roger[424] and\r\nTancred[425] seemed to have returned, minus the chivalry.\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier was in Naples in February 1814; where was I then? In\r\nmy Vallée-aux-Loups, commencing the story of my life. I was concerning\r\nmyself with the sports of my childhood to the sound of the foreign\r\nsoldier's footsteps. The woman whose name was to close these Memoirs\r\nwas strolling on the _marine_ of Baja. Had I not a presentiment of the\r\ngood which was one day to come to me from that quarter, when I was\r\ndepicting the Parthenopian seduction in the _Martyrs_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Every morning, so soon as dawn began to appear, I went under\r\n    a portico.... The sun rose before me... it illumined with\r\n    its tenderest fires the mountain-chain of Salernum[426], the\r\n    blue sea studded with the white sails of the fishermen, the\r\n    islands of Capræ[427], Œnaria[428], Prochyta[429]... the cape\r\n    of Misenum[430] and Baiæ[431] with all its enchantments.\r\n\r\n    \"Flowers and fruits moist with dew are less sweet and less\r\n    fresh than the Neapolitan landscape emerging from the shades\r\n    of night. I was always surprised, on reaching the portico, to\r\n    find myself beside the sea; for the waves in that spot scarce\r\n    gave forth a fountain's gentle murmur. In an ecstasy before\r\n    that picture, I leant against a pillar and, void of thoughts,\r\n    desires, or plans, remained whole hours breathing a delicious\r\n    air. The charm was so intense that it seemed to me that that\r\n    divine air was transforming my own substance, and that, with\r\n    an unspeakable pleasure, I was rising towards the firmament\r\n    like a pure spirit....\r\n\r\n    \"To await or go in search of beauty; to see her come towards\r\n    us in a wherry and smile to us from amid the waves; to\r\n    float with her on the sea, while strewing its surface with\r\n    flowers; to follow the enchantress into the recesses of\r\n    that wood of myrtles and into the fortunate fields where\r\n    Virgil set Elysium; that was the occupation of our days....\r\n    Perhaps there are climates dangerous to virtue through their\r\n    extreme voluptuousness. And is it not this that an ingenious\r\n    fable strove to teach, when telling that Parthenope[432]\r\n    was built upon a syren's tomb? The velvet brilliancy of\r\n    the country-side, the lukewarm temperature of the air, the\r\n    rounded outlines of the mountains, the soft inflexions of the\r\n    streams and valleys form at Naples so many seductions for the\r\n    senses, which everything tends to rest, nothing to wound....\r\n\r\n    \"To escape the noonday heat, we would retire to that part of\r\n    the palace built under the sea. Stretched on beds of ivory,\r\n    we listened to the murmuring of the waves above our heads. If\r\n    some storm surprised us down in these retreats, the slaves\r\n    brought us lamps filled with the most precious nard of Araby.\r\n    Then entered young Neapolitan girls, bearing roses of Pæstum\r\n    in vases of Nola; while the billows moaned without, they\r\n    sang, performing tranquil dances before us which reminded\r\n    me of the manners of Greece: thus were realized for us the\r\n    fictions of the poets; we seemed in Neptune's cave to be\r\n    watching the sports of the Nereids[433].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier met, at Naples, Count von Neipperg[434] and the Duc\r\nde Rohan-Chabot[435]: one was destined to climb to the eagle's nest,\r\nthe other to wear the purple. They said of the latter that he was\r\ndevoted to red, having worn the coat of a chamberlain, the uniform of a\r\nlight-horseman of the Guard, and the robe of a cardinal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duc de Rohan.]\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Rohan was very pretty; he warbled plaintive ballads, painted\r\nlittle water-colours and was eminent for his coquettish and studied\r\ndress. When he became an abbé, his pious hair, tried by the iron,\r\nhad all a martyr's elegance. He used to preach at dusk, in sombre\r\noratories, before devout women, taking care, with the aid of two or\r\nthree artistically-distributed tapers, to light up his pale features in\r\nmezzotint, like a picture[436].\r\n\r\nWe cannot, at first sight, explain to ourselves how men whose names\r\nrendered them stupid by sheer force of pride came to accept wages from\r\na parvenu. Looking more closely into this aptness for entering service,\r\nwe find that it proceeded naturally from their manners: accustomed\r\nto the domestic condition, little recked they if the livery was\r\nchanged, provided the master were lodged at the castle under the same\r\nsign-board. Bonaparte's contempt appraised them at their true value;\r\nthe great soldier, abandoned by his own people, said to a great lady:\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact, there are only yourselves that know how to serve.\"\r\n\r\nReligion and death have passed the sponge over a few weaknesses, very\r\npardonable after all, of the Cardinal de Rohan. A Christian priest, he\r\nconsummated his sacrifice at Besançon, succouring the unhappy, feeding\r\nthe poor, clothing the orphan, and wearing out in good works his life,\r\nthe course of which was naturally shortened by deplorable ill-health.\r\n\r\nReader, if you grow impatient at these quotations, these accounts,\r\nreflect, first, that perhaps you have not read my works and, next, that\r\nI can no longer hear you; I am sleeping in the ground on which you\r\ntread; if you be angry with me, stamp on the ground, you will insult\r\nonly my bones. Reflect, moreover, that my writings form an essential\r\npart of that existence whose leaves I am unfolding. Ah, why had not\r\nmy pictures of Naples a background of truth! Why was not the daughter\r\nof the Rhone[437] the real woman of my imaginary delights? But no; if\r\nI was Augustine, Jerome, Eudorus, I was all these alone; my days went\r\nbefore the days of the friend of Corinne in Italy. How happy should\r\nI have been could I have spread my whole life under her feet like a\r\ncarpet of flowers! My life is rough and its unevenness hurts. May my\r\ndying hours at least reflect the tenderness and charm with which she\r\nhas filled them upon her who was beloved by all and of whom none had\r\never to complain!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murat, King of Naples.]\r\n\r\nMurat, King of Naples, born 25 March 1767, at the Bastide, near Cahors,\r\nwas sent to Toulouse for his studies. He took a dislike to letters,\r\nenlisted in the Ardennes Chasseurs, deserted, and ran away to Paris.\r\nAdmitted into Louis XVI.'s Constitutional Guard, he received, after\r\nthe disbanding of that guard, a cornetcy in the 12th Regiment of\r\nMounted Chasseurs. On the death of Robespierre, he was dismissed as a\r\nTerrorist[438]; the same thing happened to Bonaparte, and both soldiers\r\nwere left without resources. Murat was restored to favour on the 13\r\nVendémiaire, and became aide-de-camp to Napoleon. He served under him\r\nin the early Italian campaigns, took the Valtellina and added it to the\r\nCisalpine Republic[439]; he took part in the Egyptian Expedition and\r\ndistinguished himself at the Battle of Abukir[440]. Returning to France\r\nwith his master, he was ordered to turn out the Council of the Five\r\nHundred[441]. Bonaparte gave him his sister Caroline in marriage[442].\r\nMurat commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Marengo[443]. He was\r\nGovernor of Paris at the time of the death of the Duc d'Enghien and\r\nbemoaned in secret a murder which he had not the courage to condemn\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nBrother-in-law to Napoleon, and a marshal of the Empire[444], Murat\r\nentered Vienna in 1805[445]; he contributed to the victories of\r\nAusterlitz[446], Jena[447], Eylau[448], and Friedland[449], became\r\nGrand-duke of Berg[450], and invaded Spain in 1808.\r\n\r\nNapoleon recalled him and gave him the Crown of Naples. Proclaimed\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies on the 1st of August 1808, he pleased the\r\nNeapolitans through his magnificence, his theatrical dress, his\r\ncavalcades and his entertainments.\r\n\r\nSummoned in his capacity as a grand vassal of the Empire to the\r\ninvasion of Russia, he reappeared in all the battles and found himself\r\ncharged with the command of the retreat from Smolensk to Wilna[451].\r\nAfter manifesting his discontent, he left the army, following\r\nBonaparte's example, and went to warm himself in the sun of Naples, as\r\ndid his captain at the fireside of the Tuileries. Those men of triumph\r\ncould never accustom themselves to reverses. Then began his connexion\r\nwith Austria. He appeared once more in the camps of Germany in 1813,\r\nreturned to Naples after the loss of the Battle of Leipzig[452],\r\nand resumed his Austro-British negociations. Before entering into a\r\ncomplete alliance, Murat wrote Napoleon a letter which I have heard\r\nread by M. de Mosbourg[453]: he told his brother-in-law in this letter\r\nthat he had found the Peninsula in a very agitated condition, that\r\nthe Italians were demanding their national independence and that, if\r\nthis were not restored to them, it was to be feared that they should\r\njoin the European Coalition and thus increase the dangers of France.\r\nHe besought Napoleon to make peace, as the only means of preserving so\r\npowerful and fine an empire. He added that, if Bonaparte refused to\r\nlisten to him, he, Murat, abandoned at the further end of Italy, would\r\nfind himself compelled to leave his kingdom or embrace the interests\r\nof Italian liberty. This very reasonable letter was left for several\r\nmonths unanswered; Napoleon was, therefore, not able to reproach Murat\r\njustly with having betrayed him.\r\n\r\nMurat, obliged to make a quick choice, signed a treaty with the Court\r\nof Vienna on the 11th of January 1814; he bound himself to furnish\r\nthe Allies with a corps of thirty thousand men. As the price of his\r\ndefection, he was guaranteed his Kingdom of Naples, and his right of\r\nconquest over the Papal Marches. Madame Murat revealed this important\r\ntransaction to Madame Récamier. At the moment when he was about to\r\ndeclare himself openly, Murat, very much excited, met Madame Récamier\r\nat Caroline's, and asked her what she thought of the decision which he\r\nhad to take; he begged her to weigh well the interests of the people\r\nwhose sovereign he had become. Madame Récamier said to him:\r\n\r\n\"You are a Frenchman and you must remain faithful to the French.\"\r\n\r\nMurat's face became distorted; he rejoined:\r\n\r\n\"So I am a traitor? What can I do? It is too late!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw open a window and pointed to an English fleet entering under\r\nfull sail.\r\n\r\n\r\nVesuvius was in a state of eruption and throwing out flames. Two hours\r\nlater, Murat was on horseback at the head of his guards; the crowd\r\nsurrounded him, shouting, \"Long live King Joachim!\" He had forgotten\r\nall; he seemed drunk with delight. The next day, a great performance at\r\nthe Teatro di San-Carlo; the King and Queen were received with frantic\r\nacclamations unknown to people on this side of the Alps. The Envoy of\r\nFrancis II. was also applauded; the box of Napoleon's Minister was\r\nempty; Murat appeared troubled at this, as though he had seen the ghost\r\nof France at the back of that box.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Murat.]\r\n\r\nMurat's army, set in motion on the 16th of February 1814, forced Prince\r\nEugene to fall back upon the Adige. Napoleon, who had at first obtained\r\nunhoped for successes in Champagne, wrote to his sister Caroline\r\nsome letters which were captured by the Allies and their contents\r\ncommunicated to the English Parliament by Lord Castlereagh. He said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Your husband is very brave on the battle-field, but he is\r\n    weaker than a woman or a monk when he does not see the enemy\r\n    before him. He has no moral courage. He has been afraid, and\r\n    he would not risk to lose in one instant what he can hold\r\n    only through me and with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter, addressed to Murat himself, Napoleon said to his\r\nbrother-in-law:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I presume that you are not one of those who think that the\r\n    lion is dead; if that was your calculation, it would be\r\n    erroneous.... You have done me all the harm you could since\r\n    your departure from Wilna. The title of King has turned your\r\n    head; if you wish to keep it, behave yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMurat did not pursue the Viceroy to the Adige; he hesitated between\r\nthe Allies and the French, according to the chances which Bonaparte\r\nseemed to be winning or losing.\r\n\r\nIn the fields of Brienne, where Napoleon was educated by the old\r\nMonarchy, he gave, in the latter's honour, the last and most admirable\r\nof his blood-stained tourneys[454]. Favoured by the Carbonari, Joachim\r\nat one time wished to declare himself the liberator of Italy, at\r\nanother hoped to divide her between himself and Bonaparte become\r\nvictorious. One morning, a courier brought to Naples the news of the\r\nentry of the Russians into Paris. Madame Murat was still in bed and\r\nMadame Récamier was talking with her, seated at her pillow; an enormous\r\npile of letters and newspapers was laid upon the bed. Among the latter\r\nwas my pamphlet, _De Bonaparte and des Bourbons._ The Queen exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, here is a work by M. de Chateaubriand; we will read it together.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she went on opening her letters.\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier took the pamphlet and, after casting her eyes over it\r\nat random, placed it back on the bed and said to the Queen:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, you shall read it alone, I am obliged to return home.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon was relegated to Elba; the Allies, with rare cleverness, had\r\nplaced him on the coast of Italy. Murat learnt that they were trying\r\nat the Congress of Vienna to despoil him of the States which he had\r\nnevertheless bought so dear; he came to a secret understanding with his\r\nbrother-in-law, who had become his neighbour. One is always surprised\r\nthat the Napoleons should have relations: who knows the name of\r\nArrhidæus[455], the brother of Alexander? In the course of the year\r\n1814, the King and Queen of Naples gave an entertainment at Pompeii;\r\nan excavation was conducted to the sound of music: the ruins which\r\nCaroline and Joachim had dug up did not apprize them of their own ruin;\r\non the last borders of prosperity we hear but the last strains of the\r\ndream that passes away.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Peace of Paris, Murat formed part of the Alliance,\r\nthe Milanese having been handed back to Austria: the Neapolitans\r\nretired within the Roman Legations. Murat, perplexed, having changed\r\nhis interest, sallied forth from the Legations and marched with forty\r\nthousand men towards Upper Italy to make a diversion in favour of\r\nNapoleon[456]. At Parma, he refused the conditions which the affrighted\r\nAustrians offered him once more: to each of us comes a critical moment;\r\nill chosen or well, it decides our future. The Baron de Frimont[457]\r\nforced back Murat's troops, took the offensive and drove them before\r\nhim fighting to Macerata[458]. The Neapolitans left the ranks; their\r\nKing and general returned to Naples[459], accompanied by four lancers.\r\nHe went to his wife and said:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I have not been able to die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, a boat took him in the direction of the island of Ischia;\r\nhe joined at sea a smack carrying a few officers of his staff, and set\r\nsail with them for France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murat's flight.]\r\n\r\nMadame Murat, left behind alone, displayed admirable presence of mind.\r\nThe Austrians were on the point of appearing: in the passing from one\r\nauthority to another, an interval of anarchy might have been filled\r\nwith disorders. The Regent did not precipitate her retreat; she allowed\r\nthe German soldier to occupy the town and had her galleries lighted up\r\nat night. The people, seeing the lights from the outside, thinking that\r\nthe Queen was still there, remained quiet. Meantime Caroline left by a\r\nsecret stair-case and went on board ship. Seated on the poop, she saw\r\ngleaming on the bank the illuminated, but deserted palace from which\r\nshe was departing, an image of the dazzling dream which she had had\r\nduring her sleep in the realm of the fairies.\r\n\r\nCaroline met the frigate which was bringing Ferdinand[460] back. The\r\nship of the fugitive Queen fired a salute, the ship of the recalled\r\nKing did not return it: Prosperity does not recognise her sister\r\nAdversity. Thus do illusions, faded for the one, begin anew for the\r\nother; thus do the fickle destinies of humanity pass each other in the\r\nwinds and on the billows: smiling or baleful, one and the same abyss\r\nbears them or engulfs them.\r\n\r\nMurat was achieving his career elsewhere. On the 25th of May 1815,\r\nat ten o'clock at night, he landed in the Golfe Juan, where his\r\nbrother-in-law had landed. Fortune made Joachim play the parody of\r\nNapoleon. The latter did not believe in the strength of misfortune,\r\nnor in the succour which it brings to great minds: he forbade the\r\ndethroned King the approach to Paris; he consigned to the lazar-house\r\nthis man stricken with the plague of the conquered; he shut him up in\r\na country-house called _Plaisance_, near Toulon. He would have done\r\nbetter to show less dread of a contagion with which he had himself been\r\nseized: who knows what a soldier like Murat might have altered in the\r\nBattle of Waterloo?\r\n\r\nThe King of Naples, in his trouble, wrote to Fouché on the 19th of June\r\n1815:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I shall reply to those who accuse me of commencing\r\n    hostilities too soon that it was done at the Emperor's\r\n    formal demand and that, for three months, he did not cease\r\n    to reassure me as to his sentiments by accrediting ministers\r\n    to me and writing to me that he relied on me and would\r\n    never abandon me. It is only when people saw that I had\r\n    lost, together with the throne, the means of continuing the\r\n    powerful diversion which had lasted three months that they\r\n    tried to mislead public opinion by insinuating that I acted\r\n    on my own behalf and without the Emperor's knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere existed a generous and beautiful woman; when she arrived in\r\nParis, Madame Récamier received her and would not abandon her in times\r\nof misfortune. Among the papers which she has left behind were found\r\ntwo letters from Murat written in the month of June 1819; they are\r\nuseful to the study of history:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letters from Murat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    6 _June_ 1815.\r\n\r\n    \"I have lost the fairest existence for France's sake; I have\r\n    fought for the Emperor; it is for his cause that my wife and\r\n    my children are in captivity. The country is in danger, I\r\n    offer my services; they put off accepting them. I know not\r\n    if I am free or a prisoner. I must needs be involved in the\r\n    Emperor's ruin if he falls, and they deprive me of the means\r\n    of serving him and serving my own cause. I ask their reasons;\r\n    they reply obscurely and I am unable clearly to establish\r\n    my position. At one time I cannot go to Paris, where my\r\n    presence would injure the Emperor, and I must not join the\r\n    army, where my presence would too much attract the attention\r\n    of the soldiers. What am I to do? Wait: that is what they\r\n    reply. On the other hand, I am told that I am not forgiven\r\n    for having abandoned the Emperor last year, whereas letters\r\n    from Paris said, when I was recently fighting for France,\r\n    '_Every one here is delighted with the King._' The Emperor\r\n    wrote to me, _I rely on you, do you rely on me, I shall never\r\n    abandon you._' King Joseph wrote to me, '_The Emperor orders\r\n    me to write to you to move rapidly upon the Alps._' And\r\n    when, on arriving, I display generous sentiments and offer\r\n    to fight for France, I am sent into the Alps. Not a word of\r\n    consolation is addressed to one who never did him any other\r\n    wrong than to rely too greatly on generous sentiments which\r\n    he never entertained for me.\r\n\r\n    \"My friend, I come to ask you to inform me of the opinion\r\n    of France and the army regarding me. A man must know how to\r\n    endure all and my courage will make me rise superior to every\r\n    misfortune. All is lost save honour; I have lost the throne,\r\n    but I have preserved all my glory; I have been abandoned\r\n    by my soldiers, who were victorious in every fight, but I\r\n    have never been beaten. The desertion of twenty thousand men\r\n    placed me at the mercy of my enemies; a fisher's bark saved\r\n    me from captivity, and a merchant ship cast me in three days\r\n    on the coasts of France.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Near TOULON, 18 _June_ 1815.\r\n\r\n    \"I have just received your letter. I cannot describe to\r\n    you the different sensations which it made me experience.\r\n    I have been able for a moment to forget my misfortunes. I\r\n    am occupied only with my friend, whose noble and generous\r\n    soul comes to console me and show me its sorrow. Reassure\r\n    yourself: all is lost, but honour remains; my glory will\r\n    survive all my misfortunes, and my courage will be able to\r\n    make me rise superior to all the rigours of my destiny: have\r\n    no fear on that score. I have lost my throne and family\r\n    unmoved; but ingratitude has revolted me. I have lost all for\r\n    France, for her Emperor, by his order, and to-day he makes\r\n    it a crime in me to have done so. He refuses me permission\r\n    to fight and revenge myself, and I am not free to choose my\r\n    own retreat: can you conceive all my unhappiness? What can I\r\n    do? What decision can I take? I am a Frenchman and a father:\r\n    as a Frenchman, I must serve my country; as a father, I must\r\n    go to share my children's lot: honour lays upon me the duty\r\n    of fighting and nature tells me that I must belong to my\r\n    children. Which am I to obey? Cannot I satisfy both? Shall I\r\n    be allowed to listen to either? Already the Emperor refuses\r\n    me armies; and will Austria grant me the means to go to join\r\n    my children? Shall I ask them of her, I who have never been\r\n    willing to treat with her ministers? There is my situation:\r\n    give me advice. I shall await your reply, the Duc d'Otrante's\r\n    and Lucien's, before taking a determination. Consult opinion\r\n    well as to what it is thought right for me to do, for I am\r\n    free in the choice of my retreat; they are returning to the\r\n    past and making it a crime in me to have, by order, lost my\r\n    throne, when my family is languishing in captivity. Advise\r\n    me; listen to the voice of honour, to that of nature, and,\r\n    as an impartial judge, have the courage to write to me what\r\n    I am to do. I shall await your reply on the road between\r\n    Marseilles and Lyons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting aside the personal vanities and the illusions which issue from\r\nthe throne, even from a throne on which one has been seated but for a\r\nmoment, these letters show us the idea which Murat entertained of his\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nBonaparte lost the Empire a second time; Murat was a shelterless\r\nvagrant on the same sands which have since beheld the roamings of the\r\nDuchesse de Berry. Some smugglers consented, on the 22nd of August\r\n1815, to put him and three others across to Corsica. A tempest greeted\r\nhim: the felucca which plies between Bastia and Toulon took him on\r\nboard. Scarce had he left his shore-boat, when she split. Landing\r\nat Bastia on the 25th of August, he hastened to hide himself in the\r\nvillage of Vescovato, at old Colonna-Ceccaldi's[461]. Two hundred\r\nofficers joined him with General Franceschetti[462]. He marched on\r\nAjaccio: Bonaparte's maternal town alone still cared for her son; of\r\nall his Empire, Napoleon owned only his cradle. The garrison of the\r\ncitadel saluted Murat and wished to proclaim him King of Corsica: he\r\nrefused; he thought only the sceptre of the Two Sicilies equal to his\r\ngreatness. His aide-de-camp Macirone[463] brought him from Paris the\r\ndecision of Austria, by virtue of which he was to give up the title of\r\nKing and retire at will to Bohemia or Moldavia:\r\n\r\n\"It is too late,\" replied Joachim; \"my dear Macirone, the die is cast.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of September, Murat sailed for Italy; seven bottoms were\r\nladen with his two hundred and fifty followers: he had scorned to have\r\nfor his kingdom the narrow mother-land of the immense man; full of\r\nhope, led away by the example of a fortune higher than his own, he set\r\nout from the island whence Napoleon had issued to take possession of\r\nthe world: it is not the same spots, but similar geniuses, that produce\r\nthe same destinies.\r\n\r\nA storm dispersed the flotilla; Murat was cast ashore, on the 8th\r\nof October, in the Gulf of Santa Eufemia, almost at the moment when\r\nBonaparte was approaching the Rock of St. Helena[464].\r\n\r\nOf his seven praams, only two were left to him, including his own.\r\nLanding with some thirty men, he tried to stir up the population of the\r\ncoast; the inhabitants fired on his band. The two praams stood out to\r\nsea; Murat was betrayed. He ran to a stranded boat, tried to float it;\r\nthe boat would not move. Surrounded and captured, Murat, insulted by\r\nthe same mob that once used to shout itself hoarse with \"Long live King\r\nJoachim!\" was taken to Pizzo Castle. Upon him and his companions were\r\nseized insensate proclamations: they showed with what dreams men delude\r\nthemselves to their last hour.\r\n\r\nUnruffled in his prison, Murat said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall have only my Kingdom of Naples; my cousin Ferdinand will keep\r\nthe second Sicily.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Murat.]\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment a military commission was condemning Murat to\r\ndeath. When he heard his sentence, his firmness deserted him for a few\r\ninstants; he shed tears and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I am Joachim King of the Two Sicilies!\"\r\n\r\nHe forgot that Louis XVI. had been King of France, the Duc d'Enghien\r\ngrandson of the Grand Condé, and Napoleon arbiter of Europe: Death\r\nreckons as nothing what we may have been.\r\n\r\nA priest is always a priest, say and do what we will; he comes and\r\nrestores its failing strength to an intrepid heart. On the 13th of\r\nOctober 1815, Murat, after writing to his wife, was taken to a room in\r\nPizzo Castle, renewing in his romantic person the brilliant or tragic\r\nadventures of the middle ages. Twelve soldiers, who perhaps had served\r\nunder him, awaited him, drawn up in two lines. Murat saw them load\r\ntheir muskets, refused to let his eyes be bandaged, and himself, as an\r\nexperienced captain, chose the post where the bullets could best hit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen aim had been taken at him, at the moment of the fire, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Men, spare the face; aim at my heart!\"\r\n\r\nHe fell, holding in his hands the portraits of his wife and of his\r\nchildren: those portraits used before to adorn the hilt of his\r\nsword[465]. It was but one affair the more which the gallant man had\r\nsettled with life.\r\n\r\nThe different manners of death of Napoleon and Murat preserve the\r\ncharacters of their lives.\r\n\r\nMurat, so magnificent, was buried without state at Pizzo, in one of\r\nthose Christian churches in whose charitable bosom all ashes are\r\nmercifully received.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier, returning to France, passed through Rome at the moment\r\nwhen the Pope returned[466]. In another portion of these Memoirs, you\r\naccompanied Pius VII., set at liberty at Fontainebleau, to the gates of\r\nSt Peter's[467]. Joachim, still alive, was about to disappear, and Pius\r\nVII. was reappearing. Behind them, Napoleon was struck; the conqueror's\r\nhand let the King fall and raised the Pontiff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pope Pius VII.]\r\n\r\nPius VII. was received with shouts which shook the ruins of the city\r\nof ruins. The horses were taken from his carriage and the crowd drew\r\nhim to the steps of the Church of the Apostles. The Holy Father saw\r\nnothing, heard nothing; rapt in mind, his thought was far from the\r\nearth; only his hand rose over the people from the tender habit of\r\nblessing. He entered the basilica to the sound of trumpets, to the\r\nsinging of the _Te Deum_, to the acclamations of the Swiss of the\r\nreligion of William Tell. The thuribles wafted perfumes to him which he\r\ndid not inhale; he would not be carried on the _sedia gestatoria_ under\r\nthe shadow of the canopy and the palms; he walked like a shipwrecked\r\nman fulfilling his vow to Our Lady of Succour, and charged by Christ\r\nwith a mission which was to renew the face of the earth. He was clad\r\nin a white robe; his hair, which had remained black in spite of\r\nmisfortune and years, formed a contrast with the anchorite's pallor.\r\nOn arriving at the Tomb of the Apostles, he prostrated himself: he\r\nremained, without movement and as though dead, plunged in the depths of\r\nthe counsels of Providence. The emotion was profound; Protestants who\r\nwitnessed the scene wept scalding tears.\r\n\r\nWhat a subject for meditation! An infirm, decrepit priest,\r\nstrengthless, defenseless, taken from the Quirinal, carried captive\r\nto the heart of Gaul; a martyr, who awaited naught save his tomb,\r\ndelivered from the hands of Napoleon, who pressed the globe, resuming\r\nthe empire of an indestructible world, when the walls of a prison\r\nbeyond the seas were being prepared for that formidable gaoler of the\r\nnations and the kings!\r\n\r\nPius VII. outlived the Emperor; he saw the master-pieces, the faithful\r\nfriends which had accompanied him in his exile, brought back to the\r\nVatican. On his return from persecution, the septuagenarian Pontiff,\r\nprostrate beneath the cupola of St. Peter's, displayed at the same time\r\nall the weakness of man and the grandeur of God.\r\n\r\nOn descending the Savoy Alps, Madame Récamier, at Pont-de-Beauvoisin,\r\nfound the White Flag and the white cockade. The Corpus Christi\r\nprocessions, passing through the villages, seemed to have come back\r\nwith the Most Christian King. In Lyons, the traveller arrived in the\r\nmidst of a Restoration festival. The enthusiasm was unfeigned. At\r\nthe head of the rejoicings stood Alexis de Noailles[468] and Colonel\r\nClary, Joseph Bonaparte's brother-in-law. All that is told to-day of\r\nthe coldness and gloom with which the Legitimacy was received at the\r\nFirst Restoration is a shameless falsehood. Joy was general in the\r\ndifferent sections of opinion, even among the Conventionals, even among\r\nthe Imperialists, excepting the soldiers: their noble pride suffered\r\nfrom those reverses. Nowadays, when the weight of military government\r\nis no longer felt, when vanities are aroused, it is necessary to deny\r\nthe facts, because they do not accord with the theories of the moment.\r\nIt suits the purpose of a system that the nation should have received\r\nthe Bourbons with abhorrence and that the Restoration should have been\r\na time of oppression and misery. This leads to melancholy reflections\r\non human nature. If the Bourbons had the inclination and the strength\r\nto oppress, they might have looked forward to a long retention of the\r\nthrone. Bonaparte's violence and injustice, dangerous to his power\r\nthough they appeared, in reality served him: men are appalled by\r\niniquities, but manufacture a great idea out of them; they are disposed\r\nto regard as a superior being one who places himself above the laws.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël, who arrived in Paris before Madame Récamier, had\r\nwritten to her several times; only the following note reached her:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 20 _May_ 1814.\r\n\r\n    \"I am ashamed to be in Paris without you, dear angel of my\r\n    life: tell me your plans. Would you like me to go before you\r\n    to Coppet, where I am going to stay for four months? After\r\n    so many sufferings, my sweetest prospect is yourself, and\r\n    my heart is for ever devoted to you. One word as to your\r\n    departure and arrival. I await that note to know what I shall\r\n    do. I am writing to you to Rome, Naples, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Genlis.]\r\n\r\nMadame de Genlis, who had never had any relations with Madame Récamier,\r\nwas eager to become better acquainted with her. I find a passage\r\nexpressing a wish which, had it been realized, would have spared the\r\nreader my story:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"11 _October._\r\n\r\n    \"Here, madame, is the book which I had the honour to promise\r\n    you. I have marked the things which I should like you to\r\n    read....\r\n\r\n    \"Come, madame, to tell me your story 'in these words,' as\r\n    they do in the novels. Then I will afterwards ask you to\r\n    write it in the form of recollections, which will be full of\r\n    interest, because, in your earliest youth, you were cast,\r\n    with a bewitching face and a mind full of shrewdness and\r\n    penetration, into the midst of those whirlpools of errors\r\n    and follies; because you have seen everything; and because,\r\n    having preserved, during those stormy times, your religious\r\n    sentiment, a pure soul, a stainless life, an impressionable\r\n    and loyal heart, possessing neither envy nor hateful\r\n    passions, you will depict everything in the truest colours.\r\n    You are one of the phenomena of these days, and certainly the\r\n    most amiable.\r\n\r\n    \"You shall show me your 'Recollections;' my old experience\r\n    will offer some advice, and you will write a useful and\r\n    delightful work. Do not come and answer, 'I am not capable,'\r\n    etc., etc. I will permit you no commonplaces; they are\r\n    unworthy of your intelligence. You can cast back your eyes\r\n    over the past without remorse: this is, at all times, the\r\n    fairest of our privileges; in the days in which we live,\r\n    it is an inestimable one. Avail yourself of it for the\r\n    instruction of the young person[469] whom you are bringing\r\n    up; it will be the greatest boon you can show her.\r\n\r\n    \"Adieu, madame, permit me to tell you that I love you and\r\n    that I embrace you with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that Madame Récamier has returned to Paris[470], I will go back for\r\nsome time to my first guides. The Queen of Naples, uneasy about the\r\nresolutions of the Congress of Vienna, wrote to Madame Récamier to find\r\nher a man who would be capable of handling her interests in Vienna.\r\nMadame Récamier applied to Benjamin Constant and asked him to draw up a\r\nmemorandum. This circumstance had the most unfortunate influence upon\r\nthe author of the memorandum; a stormy sentiment was the result of\r\nan interview. Under the empire of this sentiment, Benjamin Constant,\r\nalready a violent Anti-Bonapartist, as is manifest in the _Esprit\r\nde conquête_[471], allowed opinions to overflow the course of which\r\nwas soon changed by events. Thence arose a reputation for political\r\nfickleness baleful to statesmen.\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier, while admiring Bonaparte, had remained true to her\r\nhatred against the oppressor of our liberties and the enemy of Madame\r\nde Staël. As for what concerned herself, she did not give it a thought\r\nand she made light of her exile. The letters which Benjamin Constant\r\nwrote to her at this time will serve as a study, if not of the human\r\nheart, at least of the human head: there we see all that could be\r\nmade of a passion by an ironical and romantic, serious and poetical\r\nintelligence. Rousseau is not more genuine, but he mingles with his\r\nimaginary loves a sincere melancholy and a real reverie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bonaparte had landed at Cannes; the perturbation due to his\r\napproach was beginning to make itself felt. Benjamin Constant wrote\r\nMadame Récamier this note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Forgive me if I avail myself of circumstances to trouble\r\n    you; but the opportunity is too favourable. My fate will be\r\n    decided in four or five days surely; for, though you used\r\n    to like not to think so, in order to have to show me less\r\n    interest, I am certainly, with Marmont, Chateaubriand and\r\n    Lainé, one of the four most compromised men in France. It\r\n    is, therefore, certain that, if we do not triumph, I shall\r\n    in a week be either an outlaw or a fugitive, or in a cell or\r\n    shot. Grant me then, during the two or three days which will\r\n    precede the battle, as much of your time and as many of your\r\n    hours as you can. If I die, you will be glad to have done me\r\n    this kindness and you would be sorry to have afflicted me. My\r\n    feeling for you is my life; one sign of indifference hurts me\r\n    more than, four days hence, my sentence of death could do.\r\n    And, when I feel that danger is a means of obtaining a sign\r\n    of interest from you, I derive from it nothing but joy.\r\n\r\n    \"Were you pleased with my article, and have you heard what\r\n    people say of it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Constant was right, he was as much compromised as I: attached\r\nto Bernadotte, he had served against Napoleon; he had published his\r\nwork _De l'esprit de conquête_, in which he handled the \"tyrant\"\r\nmore roughly than I handled him in my pamphlet _De Bonaparte et des\r\nBourbons._ He crowned his perils by talking in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March, at the moment when Bonaparte was at the gates of\r\nthe Capital, he had the firmness to affix his signature to an article\r\nin the _Journal des Débats_ ending with this phrase:\r\n\r\n\"I shall not, like a wretched turn-coat, go creeping from one power\r\nto the other, covering infamy with sophisms and stammering out profane\r\nwords to redeem a shameful life.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin Constant wrote to her who inspired him with these noble\r\nsentiments:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I am glad that my article has appeared; at least none can\r\n    now doubt my sincerity. Here is a note which some one wrote\r\n    to me after reading it: if I were to receive a similar one\r\n    from somebody else, I should be gay upon the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier always reproached herself for having unintentionally\r\nexercised so great an influence over an honourable destiny. Nothing,\r\nin fact, is more distressing than to inspire those fickle characters\r\nwith those energetic resolutions which they are incapable of keeping.\r\nOn the 20th of March, Benjamin Constant belied his article of the 19th.\r\nAfter driving a little distance away from town, he returned to Paris\r\nand allowed himself to be caught by Bonaparte's seductions. Appointed a\r\nState councillor[472], he obliterated his generous pages by working at\r\nthe draft of the Additional Act.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, he bore a secret wound at his heart; he no\r\nlonger with assurance broached the thought of posterity; his spoilt and\r\nsaddened life contributed in no small degree to his death. God preserve\r\nus from triumphing over the miseries from which the loftiest natures\r\nare not exempt! Heaven does not give us talents without attaching\r\ninfirmities to them: expiations offered to foolishness and envy. The\r\nweaknesses of a superior man are the black victims which antiquity\r\nsacrificed to the infernal gods, and still they never allow themselves\r\nto be disarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Krüdener.]\r\n\r\nMadame Récamier spent the Hundred Days in France, where Queen Hortense\r\ninvited her to stay; the Queen of Naples, on the other hand, offered\r\nher an asylum in Italy. The Hundred Days passed. Madame de Krüdener\r\naccompanied the Allies, who arrived once more in Paris. She had fallen\r\nfrom novel-writing into mysticism; she wielded a great empire over the\r\nmind of the Tsar of Russia.\r\n\r\nMadame de Krüdener lodged in a house in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\r\nThe garden of this house extended as far as the Champs-Élysées.\r\nAlexander used to arrive _incognito_ by a gate of the garden, and\r\npolitico-religious conversations would end with fervent prayers. Madame\r\nde Krüdener invited me to one of these celestial incantations: I, the\r\nman of every illusion, have a hatred of unreason, a loathing for the\r\nnebulous and a scorn for hocus-pocus; we are none of us perfect. The\r\nscene bored me; the more I tried to pray, the more I felt the dryness\r\nof my soul. I could find nothing to say to God, and the devil incited\r\nme to laugh. I had liked Madame de Krüdener better when, surrounded\r\nwith flowers and still inhabiting this paltry earth, she was writing\r\n_Valérie._ Only, I used to consider that my old friend M. Michaud, so\r\noddly mixed up in this idyll, had not enough of the shepherd about\r\nhim, notwithstanding his name. Madame de Krüdener, become a seraph,\r\nstrove to surround herself with angels; the proof is contained in this\r\ncharming note from Benjamin Constant to Madame Récamier:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Thursday._\r\n\r\n    \"I am a little embarrassed in fulfilling a commission which\r\n    Madame de Krüdener has just given me. She entreats you to\r\n    come looking as little beautiful as you can. She says that\r\n    you dazzle everybody and that, for that reason, all minds are\r\n    troubled and all attention becomes impossible. You cannot\r\n    lay aside your charmingness; but do not enhance it. I could\r\n    add many things about your beauty on this occasion, but I\r\n    have not the courage. One can be ingenious on the charm\r\n    which pleases, but not on that which kills. I shall see you\r\n    presently; you have told me five o'clock, but you will not\r\n    come in till six, and I shall not be able to say a word to\r\n    you. I shall try, however, to be amiable for this once again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not the Duke of Wellington also lay claim to the honour of\r\nattracting a glance from Juliet? One of his notes, which I transcribe,\r\nis curious only because of the signature:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 13 _January._\r\n\r\n    \"I confess, madame, that I do not much regret that business\r\n    will prevent me from calling on you after dinner, because,\r\n    every time I see you, I leave you more impressed with your\r\n    charms and less disposed to give my attention to _politics!!!_\r\n\r\n    \"I will call on you to-morrow on my return from the Abbé\r\n    Sicard's, in case you should be in, and in spite of the\r\n    effect which those dangerous visits produce on me.\r\n\r\n    \"Your most faithful servant,\r\n\r\n    \"WELLINGTON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return from Waterloo, entering Madame Récamier's drawing-room,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I have beaten him soundly!\"\r\n\r\nIn a French heart, his success would have made him lose the victory,\r\nhad he ever been able to lay claim to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Madame de Staël.]\r\n\r\nIt was at a sad time for the glory of France that I met Madame Récamier\r\nagain; it was at the time of the death of Madame de Staël. Returning\r\nto Paris after the Hundred Days, the author of Delphine had fallen ill\r\nagain; I had met her at her house and at Madame la Duchesse de Duras'.\r\nGradually, her condition growing worse, she was obliged to keep her\r\nbed. One morning, I went to her in the Rue Royale; the shutters of her\r\nwindows were two-thirds closed; the bed, pushed towards the wall at the\r\nback of the room, left only a space on the left; the curtains, drawn\r\nback on metal rods, formed two columns at the head of the bed. Madame\r\nde Staël, half sitting up, was propped up by pillows. I approached\r\nand, when my eyes had grown a little accustomed to the darkness, I\r\ndistinguished the patient. A burning fever fired her cheeks. Her bright\r\nglance met me in the dimness, and she said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my dear Francis[473]. I suffer, but that does not\r\nprevent me from loving you.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, which I pressed and kissed. As I raised my head,\r\nI saw on the opposite side of the bed, against the wall, something\r\nwhich rose up white and thin: it was M. de Rocca, with an emaciated\r\ncountenance, hollow cheeks, bloodshot eyes and a sallow complexion;\r\nhe was dying. I had never seen him, and I never saw him again. He did\r\nnot open his mouth; he bowed as he passed before me; the sound of his\r\nfootsteps was inaudible: he went away like a shadow. Stopping for a\r\nmoment at the door, \"the vaporous idol twitching its fingers\" turned\r\nback towards the bed to wave adieu to Madame de Staël. Those two ghosts\r\nlooking at one another in silence, one erect and pale, the other seated\r\nand coloured with a blood ready to flow down again and to congeal at\r\nthe heart, made one shudder.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, Madame de Staël changed her lodging. She invited\r\nme to dine with her, in the Rue Neuve-des-Mathurins: I went; she was\r\nnot in the drawing-room and was unable even to come in to dinner;\r\nbut she did not know that the fatal hour was so nigh. We sat down to\r\ntable. I found myself sitting by Madame Récamier. It was twelve years\r\nsince I had met her, and then I had seen her for but a moment. I did\r\nnot look at her, she did not look at me: we did not exchange a word.\r\nWhen, towards the end of dinner, she timidly addressed a few words to\r\nme on Madame de Staël's illness, I turned my head a little and raised\r\nmy eyes. I should fear to profane to-day through the mouth of my years\r\na sentiment which preserves all its youth in my memory and whose charm\r\nincreases as life withdraws. I separate my old days to discover behind\r\nthose days celestial apparitions, to hear from the bottom of the abyss\r\nthe harmonies of a happier region.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël died[474]. The last note which she wrote to Madame de\r\nDuras was traced in big crazy letters, like a child's. It contained an\r\naffectionate word for \"Francis.\" The talent which expires impresses one\r\nmore painfully than the individual who dies: it is a general desolation\r\nthat strikes society; every one at the same moment suffers the same\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nWith Madame de Staël disappeared a considerable portion of the time in\r\nwhich I had lived: many of those breaches which the fall of a superior\r\nintelligence forms in a century never close up again. Her death made on\r\nme a particular impression, with which was mingled a sort of mysterious\r\nastonishment: it was at that illustrious woman's that I had first met\r\nMadame Récamier and, after long days of separation, Madame de Staël\r\nbrought together again two travelling persons who had become almost\r\nstrangers to one another: she left them, at a funeral banquet, her\r\nmemory and the example of her immortal attachment.\r\n\r\nI went to see Madame Récamier in the Rue Basse-du-Rempart and,\r\nafterwards, in the Rue d'Anjou. When one has rejoined his destiny, he\r\nbelieves himself never to have left it: life, according to the opinion\r\nof Pythagoras, is only a reminiscence. Who does not, in the course\r\nof his days, recollect some little circumstances indifferent to all,\r\nexcept to him who recalls them? Belonging to the house in the Rue\r\nd'Anjou was a garden; in that garden, a bower of lime-trees, between\r\nwhose leaves I saw a moonbeam when I waited for Madame Récamier: does\r\nit not seem to me as though that beam were mine and as though, if I\r\nwent to look for it in the same place, I should find it? I scarce\r\nremember the sun which I have seen shine on many fore-heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abbaye-aux-Bois.]\r\n\r\nIt was at that time that I was obliged to sell the Vallée-aux-Loups,\r\nwhich Madame Récamier had hired, in half shares with M. de Montmorency.\r\nMore and more tried by fortune, Madame Récamier soon retired to the\r\nAbbaye-aux-Bois[475]. The Duchesse d'Abrantès speaks as follows of that\r\nabode:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Abbaye-aux-Bois, with all its dependencies, its\r\n    beautiful gardens, its extensive cloisters, in which played\r\n    young girls of all ages, with careless looks and frolicsome\r\n    words, was known only as a saintly abode to which a family\r\n    could safely entrust its hope; even then, it was known only\r\n    to the mothers who had an interest beyond its high walls.\r\n    But, once Sister Marie had closed the little gate surmounted\r\n    by an attic, the boundary of the saintly domain, one crossed\r\n    the great court-yard which separates the convent from the\r\n    street, not only as neutral, but as foreign ground.\r\n\r\n    \"To-day this is no longer so: the name of the Abbaye-aux-Bois\r\n    has become popular; its renown is general and familiar to all\r\n    classes. The woman who goes there for the first time and says\r\n    to her footmen, 'To the Abbaye-aux-Bois' is sure not to be\r\n    asked by them in which direction they have to drive....\r\n\r\n    \"Whence did it, in so short a time, derive so positive a\r\n    renown, so wide-spread an illustriousness? Do you see two\r\n    little windows, right up at the top, in the lofts, there,\r\n    above the large windows of the great stair-case? That is one\r\n    of the small rooms of the house. Well, nevertheless, the fame\r\n    of the Abbaye-aux-Bois took birth within its confines, came\r\n    down from there, and became popular. And how could it but\r\n    become popular, when all classes of society knew that, in\r\n    that little room, dwelt a being who led a life disinherited\r\n    of all joy and who, nevertheless, found words of consolation\r\n    for every sorrow, magic words to alleviate every pain,\r\n    succour for every misfortune?\r\n\r\n    \"When, from the recesses of his prison, Coudert[476] caught a\r\n    glimpse of the scaffold, whose pity was it that he invoked?\r\n    'Go to Madame Récamier,' he said to his brother[477] 'tell\r\n    her that I am innocent before God... she will understand\r\n    that evidence...' and Coudert was saved. Madame Récamier\r\n    joined in her generous action a man gifted with both talent\r\n    and kindness: M. Ballanche seconded her endeavours, and the\r\n    scaffold devoured one victim the less.\r\n\r\n    \"It might almost be described as a marvel offered to the\r\n    study of the human mind, that little cell in which a woman\r\n    of more than European reputation came to seek repose and a\r\n    decent asylum. The world is generally inclined to forget\r\n    those who no longer invite it to their banquets; it did not\r\n    forget her who, formerly, in the midst of her joys, lent an\r\n    even more willing ear to a complaint than to the accents of\r\n    pleasure. Not only was the little room on the third floor\r\n    of the Abbaye-aux-Bois the constant object of the errands\r\n    of Madame Récamier's friends, but, as though a fairy's\r\n    magic wand had relieved the steepness of the ascent, the\r\n    same strangers who used to ask as a favour to be admitted\r\n    to the elegant mansion on the Chaussée d'Antin continued\r\n    to beg the same boon. For them it was a sight really as\r\n    remarkable as any rarity in Paris to see, within a space of\r\n    ten feet by twenty, all opinions united under one banner,\r\n    marching in peace and almost hand in hand. The Vicomte de\r\n    Chateaubriand told Benjamin Constant of the unknown marvels\r\n    of America. Mathieu de Montmorency, with the urbanity\r\n    personal to himself, the chivalrous politeness of all that\r\n    bears his name, was as respectfully attentive to Madame\r\n    Bernadotte[478], who was about to reign in Sweden, as he\r\n    would have been to the sister[479] of Adelaide of Savoy[480],\r\n    daughter of Humbert the White-handed[481], that widow of\r\n    Louis the Fat[482] who married one of his ancestors[483]. And\r\n    the man of the feudal times had not a single bitter word for\r\n    the man of our days of liberty.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Society at the Abbaye.]\r\n\r\n    \"Seated side by side on the same divan, the duchess of the\r\n    Faubourg Saint-Germain became polite to the duchess of the\r\n    Empire; nothing seemed to shock in that unique room. When I\r\n    saw Madame Récamier again in that room, I had just returned\r\n    to Paris, after a long absence. I had a service to ask of\r\n    her, and went to her with confidence. I well knew, through\r\n    common friends, to how great a measure of strength her\r\n    courage had risen, but I myself lacked it when I saw her\r\n    there, under the loft, as peaceful and calm as in the gilded\r\n    drawing-rooms of the Rue du Mont-Blanc.\r\n\r\n    \"'What!' said I to myself. 'Nothing but sufferings!'\r\n\r\n    \"And my moist eye fixed itself upon her with an expression\r\n    which she must have understood. Alas, my memories passed\r\n    back over the years and recaptured the past! Ever beaten by\r\n    the storm, that woman, whom fame had placed at the very top\r\n    of the wreath of flowers of the age, had, for the last ten\r\n    years, seen her life surrounded by sorrows, the shock of\r\n    which was striking repeated blows at her heart and killing\r\n    her!...\r\n\r\n    \"When, guided by old memories and a constant attraction, I\r\n    selected the Abbaye-aux-Bois as my refuge, the little room\r\n    on the third storey was no longer inhabited by her whom I\r\n    should have gone to seek there; Madame Récamier at that time\r\n    occupied a more spacious apartment. It was there that I saw\r\n    her again. Death had thinned the ranks of the combatants\r\n    around her, and, of all those political champions, M. de\r\n    Chateaubriand was almost the only one among her friends\r\n    who had survived. But for him too the hour struck of hope\r\n    deceived and royal ingratitude. He was wise; he bade farewell\r\n    to those false pretenses of happiness, and relinquished the\r\n    uncertain power of the tribune to grasp one more practical.\r\n\r\n    \"You have already seen that, in this drawing-room at the\r\n    Abbaye-aux-Bois, there was question of other interests\r\n    besides literary interests, and that those who suffer may\r\n    turn towards it a look full of hope, Constantly occupied as\r\n    I have, for some months, been with all that relates to the\r\n    family of the Emperor, I have found a few documents which do\r\n    not seem to be devoid of interest at this moment.\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen of Spain[484] found herself under an absolute\r\n    necessity to return to France. She wrote to Madame Récamier\r\n    to beg her to interest herself in the request which she was\r\n    making to be allowed to come to Paris. M. de Chateaubriand\r\n    was at that time in office, and the Queen of Spain, knowing\r\n    the loyalty of his character, had every confidence in\r\n    the success of her appeal. Nevertheless, the thing was\r\n    difficult, because there was a law which affected all that\r\n    unhappy family, even in its most virtuous members. But M. de\r\n    Chateaubriand had in him that feeling of a noble pity for\r\n    misfortune, which later made him write those touching words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sur le compte des grands je ne suis pas suspect:\r\n    Leurs malheurs seulement attirent mon respect.\r\n    Je hais ce Pharaon, que l'éclat environne;\r\n    Mais s'il tombe, à l'instant j'honore sa couronne;\r\n    Il devient, à mes yeux, roi par l'adversité;\r\n    Des pleurs je reconnais l'auguste autorité:\r\n    Courtisan du malheur, etc., etc.[485]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"M. de Chateaubriand lent an ear to the interests of a person\r\n    in distress; he examined his duty, which did not lay upon him\r\n    the fear of dreading a weak woman, and, two days after the\r\n    request was made, he wrote to Madame Récamier that Madame\r\n    Joseph Bonaparte might return to France, asking where she\r\n    was, in order that he might send her, through M. Durand de\r\n    Moreuil, then our Minister to Brussels[486], permission to\r\n    come to France under the name of the Comtesse de Villeneuve.\r\n    He wrote at the same time to M. de Fagel[487].\r\n\r\n    \"I have related this fact with so much the more pleasure as\r\n    it honours both her who asked and the minister who obliged\r\n    her: the one through her noble confidence, the other through\r\n    his noble humanity[488].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame d'Abrantès praises my conduct far too highly: it was not worth\r\neven the trouble of remark; but, as she does not tell all there is to\r\ntell about the Abbaye-aux-Bois, I will supply what she has forgotten or\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captain Roger.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Roger[489], another Coudert, had been condemned to death.\r\nMadame Récamier had joined me in her pious work of saving him. Benjamin\r\nConstant had also interceded on behalf of this companion of Caron's,\r\nand had given the condemned man's brother the following letter for\r\nMadame Récamier:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I could not forgive myself, madame, for always importuning\r\n    you, but it is not my fault if there are incessant\r\n    condemnations to death. This letter will be delivered to\r\n    you by the brother of the unhappy Roger, sentenced with\r\n    Caron[490]. The story is very hateful and very well-known.\r\n    The name alone will acquaint M. de Chateaubriand with the\r\n    matter. He is fortunate enough to be at the same time the\r\n    first talent in the Ministry and the only minister under whom\r\n    no blood has been spilt. I say no more; I leave the rest to\r\n    your heart. It is very sad to have to write to you almost\r\n    exclusively on distressful matters; but you forgive me, I\r\n    know, and I am sure that you will add one more unfortunate to\r\n    the long list of those whom you have saved.\r\n\r\n    \"A thousand fond respects.\r\n\r\n    \"B. CONSTANT.\r\n\r\n    \"PARIS, 1 _March_ 1823.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Roger was set at liberty, he hastened to express his\r\ngratitude to his benefactress. One evening, after dinner, I was at\r\nMadame Récamier's as usual; suddenly appeared this officer. He said to\r\nus, in a southern accent:\r\n\r\n\"But for your intercession, my head would have rolled on the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\nWe were stupefied, for we had forgotten our merits; he shouted, red as\r\na turkey-cock:\r\n\r\n\"You don't remember?... You don't remember?...\" In vain we made\r\na thousand excuses for our lack of memory; he went off, striking\r\nthe spurs of his boots together again and again, as furious at our\r\nforgetting our good action as though he had had to reproach us with his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Talma asked Madame Récamier to allow him to meet\r\nme at her rooms in order to consult me on some verses in Ducis'\r\n_Othello_, which he was not allowed to speak as they stood. Leaving my\r\ndispatches, I hastened to keep the appointment; I spent the evening\r\nwith the modern Roscius recasting the unlucky lines. He proposed an\r\nalteration to me, I proposed another to him; we vied with each other\r\nin rhyming; we withdrew to the window-recess or to a corner to turn\r\nand re-turn a hemistich. We had much difficulty in agreeing as to the\r\nsense and the rhythm. It would have been rather curious to see me, the\r\nminister of Louis XVIII., and Talma, the king of the stage, forgetting\r\nwhat we might be, emulating each other in enthusiasm, and sending the\r\ncensorship and all the grandeurs of the world to the deuce. But, if\r\nRichelieu had his dramas performed while letting Gustavus Adolphus[491]\r\nloose on Europe, could not I, a humble secretary of State, busy myself\r\nwith the tragedies of others while seeking the independence of France\r\nin Madrid?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweet hours at the Abbaye.]\r\n\r\nMadame la Duchesse d'Abrantès, whose coffin I have saluted in the\r\nchurch at Chaillot, has described only the _inhabited_ abode of Madame\r\nRécamier; I will tell of the _solitary_ refuge. A dark corridor\r\nseparated two small rooms. I maintained that this vestibule was lit\r\nup with a gentle light. The bed-room was furnished with a library,\r\na harp, a piano, a portrait of Madame de Staël and a view of Coppet\r\nby moonlight; pots of flowers adorned the window-sills. When, quite\r\nbreathless with clambering up three flights of stairs, I entered the\r\ncell at the fall of evening, I was enraptured. The outlook from the\r\nwindows was over the garden of the Abbaye, in the green clumps of which\r\nthe nuns moved to and fro and school-girls ran hither and thither.\r\nThe top of an acacia-tree rose to the level of the eye. Sharp-pointed\r\nsteeples pierced the sky, and on the horizon appeared the hills of\r\nSèvres. The expiring sun gilded the picture and entered through the\r\nopen windows. Madame Récamier sat at her piano; the Angelus tolled:\r\nthe sound of the bell which seemed \"to weep the dying day, _pianger\r\nil giorno che si muore_[492],\" mingled with the last accents of the\r\nInvocation of the Night in Steibelt's[493] _Romeo and Juliet._ A few\r\nbirds came to nestle in the raised outer blinds; I joined the silence\r\nand solitude from afar, above the noise and tumult of a great city.\r\n\r\nGod, by giving me those hours of peace, indemnified me for my hours of\r\ntrouble; I foresaw the coming rest which my faith believes in and my\r\nhope invokes. Agitated as I was elsewhere with political occupations,\r\nor disgusted with the ingratitude of Courts, peacefulness of heart\r\nawaited me in the recesses of that retreat, like the coolness of the\r\nwoods when one leaves a scorching plain. I recovered my calm beside a\r\nwoman who spread serenity around her; and yet that serenity was not\r\nin any way too even, for it passed through deep affections. Alas, the\r\nmen whom I used to meet at Madame Récamier's, Mathieu de Montmorency,\r\nCamille Jordan, Benjamin Constant, the Duc de Laval, have gone to\r\njoin Hingant, Joubert, Fontanes, others who were absent from another\r\nabsent company. Amid those successive friendships have risen young\r\nfriends, the vernal offshoots of an old forest in which the felling\r\nis everlasting. I beg them, I beg M. Ampère, who will read this when\r\nI am gone, I ask them all to keep me in their memory: I make over to\r\nthem the thread of the life the end of which Lachesis is spinning out\r\non my distaff. My inseparable road-fellow, M. Ballanche, has found\r\nhimself alone at the commencement and at the end of my career; he has\r\nwitnessed my friendships broken by time as I have witnessed his carried\r\naway by the Rhone: rivers always undermine their banks.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune of my friends has often weighed heavily on me, and I\r\nhave never shrunk from the sacred burden: the moment of reward has\r\narrived; a serious attachment deigns to help me to support that which\r\nthe multitude of the bad days adds to their weight. As I draw near my\r\nend, it seems to me that all that has been dear to me has been dear\r\nto me in Madame Récamier, and that she was the hidden source of my\r\naffections. My memories of diverse ages, those of my dreams as well as\r\nthose of my realities, have become moulded, blended, confounded into\r\na compound of charms and sweet sufferings of which she has become the\r\nvisible embodiment She regulates my sentiments, in the same way as\r\nHeaven has set happiness, order and peace into my duties.\r\n\r\nI have followed the fair wanderer along the path which she has trodden\r\nso lightly; soon I shall go before her to a new country. As she passes\r\nin the midst of these Memoirs, in the windings of the basilica which I\r\nhasten to complete, she may come upon the chapel which here I dedicate\r\nto her; it will perhaps please her to rest in it: I have placed her\r\nimage there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: This book was written in Paris in 1839.--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: MADAME DE STAËL, _Corinne, ou l'Italie_ (Paris,\r\n1807).--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: Florio's MONTAIGNE, Booke I., chap.

EDMOND BIRÉ)\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESS OF VERONA AND THE SPANISH WAR\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs present a voluntary and compulsory gap. Nothing is\r\nsaid of the twenty months (October 1822 to June 1824) during which\r\nChateaubriand was, first, French Ambassador at the Congress of Verona\r\nand, later, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Paris; nothing of the\r\nSpanish War, which was nevertheless his work. Certainly he had no\r\nintention of placing in the shade the very events to which the honour\r\nof his name as a statesman is attached. He wished, on the contrary,\r\nto speak of them at his ease. Of all the various periods of his life,\r\nit is this which assumed the greatest development under his pen: a\r\ndevelopment so great that this narrative at first formed four volumes,\r\nreduced later to two, under circumstances which I will presently\r\nrelate. Those two volumes in reality form an integral portion of the\r\nMémoires d'Outre-tombe. That they do not figure there is due to the\r\nfact that the author feared, by giving them a place in his Memoirs, to\r\ndisturb the fine ordering of his book, in which the proportions are\r\nso well preserved, in which all the parts of the work harmonize among\r\nthemselves with an art so perfect. For this reason, and also in order\r\npublicly to revenge the Restoration for the calumnies of which it was\r\nthen the daily object, he decided, in 1838, to publish as a separate\r\nwork all that he had written on the Congress of Verona and the Spanish\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nHis manuscript, as I have just said, formed four volumes. This meant\r\neighty thousand francs (twenty thousand francs per volume) which fell\r\ndue to him, under the terms of his contract with the syndicate which\r\npossessed the right of publishing his future works. The four volumes\r\nwere almost printed, when M. de Marcellus and M. de La Ferronnays,\r\nalarmed at seeing certain diplomatic documents brought to light\r\nwhich were destined, according to them, to remain secret, entreated\r\nChateaubriand to sacrifice, here, there and everywhere, documents\r\nwhich, nevertheless, possessed the liveliest interest He consented to\r\nmost of the curtailments asked for, and gave his friends such liberal\r\nmeasure that the original four volumes became reduced to two actual\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Chateaubriand to M. de Marcellus, when the sacrifice was\r\nconsummated, \"the two of you cost me forty thousand francs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" rejoined M. de Marcellus; \"rather forty thousand francs\r\nthan regrets when it is too late.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chateaubriand replied:\r\n\r\n\"The thing is done now; I have respected your scruples and La\r\nFerronnays'; I have struck out a great deal to please you. But neither\r\nof you has placed himself sufficiently, in thought, outside his century\r\nand public affairs. To judge of an effect of tone, we should place\r\nourselves at a distance. It is by saying all that one distinguishes\r\none's self from the herd of buttoned-up and over-scrupulous statesmen.\r\nI have conceived diplomacy on a new plan; I speak out. You are wrong\r\nto dread my revelations; they could only do you credit. I tell you:\r\nyou will do later, La Ferronnays or you, when you think the danger\r\nlessened, and for the same reasons, what you are preventing me from\r\ndoing now. As far as I am concerned, I give you my authorization\r\nbeforehand[494].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Chateaubriand was induced to leave out of his Memoirs the Spanish\r\nWar, which was \"the great political event of his life,\" it is fitting\r\nthat I should here remind the reader, if only in a few words, that\r\nthis war was an act of high and great politics and not, as the enemies\r\nof the Restoration have repeated to satiety, an act of \"servitude and\r\nsubjection to the Northern Cabinets.\"\r\n\r\nWhen M. de Montmorency, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, went to\r\nthe Congress of Verona, he was the bearer of positive instructions\r\ncontaining these very words:\r\n\r\n\"France being the sole Power which is to act with her troops, she will\r\nbe the sole judge of that necessity. The plenipotentiaries must not\r\nconsent that the Congress should lay down the conduct of France with\r\nregard to Spain.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appendix to Book XI.]\r\n\r\nLed away by the generosity and elevation of his sentiments, which\r\nsometimes assumed a tinge of mysticism, to embrace a policy in which\r\nthe private initiative of each nation should disappear before the\r\ndecisions taken in common by a sort of directorate of the Great Powers\r\ncharged to secure the universal prevalence of the interests of justice\r\nand humanity, the loyal and chivalrous Mathieu de Montmorency had been\r\ninduced to demand that Russia, Austria, Prussia and France should\r\naddress a final notice to Spain, after which the ambassadors were to\r\nbe recalled. M. de Villèle declared himself against this collective\r\naction, in the council of ministers held at the Tuileries on the 25th\r\nof January 1822. He claimed the right of France to intervene alone.\r\nLouis XVIII. sided with his opinion, and declared that \"France occupied\r\na special position towards Spain; that for her to recall her ambassador\r\nwas either too much or too little;\" then he added:\r\n\r\n\"Louis XIV. destroyed the Pyrenees, I will not allow them to be set up\r\nagain; he placed my House on the Throne of Spain, I shall not allow\r\nit to fall from it; my Ambassador must not leave Madrid before the\r\nday when a hundred thousand Frenchmen are pushing forward to take his\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nTo speak in this way was to separate the action of France from that of\r\nthe other Powers; M. Duvergier de Hauranne does not hesitate to admit\r\nthis[495]. It was to disown M. de Montmorency; he forthwith resigned\r\nhis office. He had wished to make the Spanish question an European\r\nquestion; with Chateaubriand, his successor, it became a French\r\nquestion. At this the head of the British Cabinet, Mr. Canning[496],\r\ndisplayed a profound irritation. The hostility of England did not stop\r\nthe Government of Louis XVIII.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Keep up a high tone with the English ministers,\" wrote\r\n    Chateaubriand, on the 16th of January 1823, to M. de\r\n    Marcellus, France's representative in London.\r\n\r\n    \"Say and repeat to Mr. Canning,\" he wrote again in a dispatch\r\n    dated 28th January, \"that we are as anxious for peace as he,\r\n    and that England can obtain it before the opening of the\r\n    campaign, if she will hold the same language as ourselves and\r\n    demand the liberty of the King. But be sure to add that our\r\n    decision is taken, and that _nothing will make us go back._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the 13th of March 1823:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Canning is angry with me for not yielding to his threats\r\n    and casting France at the knees of England. He cannot go to\r\n    war, he has not so much as one half a plausible reason for\r\n    doing so, he feels this, and he is piqued at having gone so\r\n    far. But _war or no war, France will do what she must do, or\r\n    I shall cease to be minister..._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, in a postscript:\r\n\r\n\"Give parties, and _answer Mr. Canning firmly._\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of April:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"England feels that _this war is giving us back our influence\r\n    and restoring us to our place in Europe_; she must needs be\r\n    irritated and ill-disposed. Mr. Canning's self-esteem is\r\n    compromised: hence his violence and his ill-humour.... I\r\n    recommend you henceforth to show yourself cold and reserved\r\n    with Mr. Canning.... Be polite, but talk little; and let him\r\n    see, by your manner, _that the French Government knows its\r\n    strength and defends its dignity._[497]\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deeds were on a level with the words. Chateaubriand's policy had\r\nbeen able and firm: a prosperous and well-managed war crowned it. Read\r\nin what terms Benjamin Constant and General Foy, although speaking in\r\nthe name of the Opposition, judged the Spanish War:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"So far from contesting what our honourable colleague has\r\n    said on past events, I wish to recognise with him that the\r\n    whole of that memorable expedition has been full of glory\r\n    for our army, and I will add that this glory is so much\r\n    the finer in that it does not consist solely of military\r\n    successes. French generosity, inspiring even our private\r\n    soldiers, has always worked and sometimes happily succeeded\r\n    in making humanity prevail over vengeance, pity over fury,\r\n    and in protecting the disarmed enemy against the auxiliary\r\n    embittered by long reverses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus did Benjamin Constant express himself in the tribune of the\r\nChamber of Deputies, on the 28th of June 1824. In the same sitting,\r\nGeneral Foy added these words:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appendix to Book XI.]\r\n\r\n\"The swiftness of the operations in Spain and the plenitude of the\r\nmilitary success have deceived the expectations of those who were\r\nopposed to the war and surpassed the hopes of those who wished for it.\"\r\n\r\nAll truly liberal minds have agreed to recognise that the Spanish\r\nWar was not only politic, but legitimate and, above all, national.\r\nWhile strengthening the Government at home, it restored to France her\r\nliberty of action abroad. The Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle had freed\r\nour territory. The Congress of Verona and the campaign which followed\r\nemancipated our policy. We once more became a great nation.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot was, in 1823, one of the opponents of the expedition; this\r\ndid not prevent him, when he had himself passed through public life,\r\nfrom writing in his Memoirs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"As a bold stroke of dynastic and party politics, the\r\n    Spanish War succeeded fully. The sinister forebodings of\r\n    its adversaries were belied and the hopes of its supporters\r\n    surpassed. Put to the test together, the loyalty of the army\r\n    and the powerlessness of the conspirators seeking refuge\r\n    abroad were made manifest at the same time. The expedition\r\n    was an easy one, although not without glory. The Duc\r\n    d'Angoulême covered himself with credit. The prosperity and\r\n    tranquillity of France suffered from it in no way[498].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Sir Robert Peel, in a conversation with M. de Marcellus, thus\r\nsummed up the results of the campaign:\r\n\r\n\"Providence is on your side, you were right.... You have won a real\r\ninfluence on the Continent: a loyal army; flourishing finances; an\r\nheir to the Crown who has acquired as much glory by his courage as his\r\nmoderation[499].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: COMTE DE MARCELLUS, _Politique de la Restauration en\r\n1822 et 1823_, p. 49--B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: DUVERGIER DE HAURANNE, _Histoire du gouvernement\r\nparlementaire en France_, Vol. VII. p. 218.--B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: Lord Liverpool was Prime Minister, Canning Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs, in 1823.--T.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: MARCELLUS, _Politique de la Restauration_, pp. 123, 128,\r\n169, 201.--B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: GUIZOT, _Mémoires_, Vol. I. p. 258.--B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: MARCELLUS, _Politique de la Restauration_, p. 274.--B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII[500]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Embassy to Rome--Three kinds of materials-Diary of the road--Letters\r\nto Madame Récamier--Leo XII. and the Cardinals--The ambassadors--The\r\nold artists and the new artists--Old Roman society--Present manners\r\nof Rome--Town and country--Letter to M.

My\r\nMemoirs, as Memoirs, have gained by the story of Madame Récamier's\r\nlife: other persons have been brought upon the scene; we have seen\r\nNaples under Murat, Rome under Bonaparte, the Pope set free, returning\r\nto St. Peter's; unpublished letters of Madame de Staël, Benjamin\r\nConstant, Canova, La Harpe, Madame de Genlis, Lucien Bonaparte,\r\nMoreau, Bernadotte, Murat are preserved; the narrative of Benjamin\r\nConstant shows him in a new light. I have introduced the reader to a\r\nlittle \"out-of-the-way canton\" of the Empire, while that Empire was\r\naccomplishing its universal movement; I now find myself brought to my\r\nRoman Embassy. The distraction of a fresh subject will have been a\r\nrelief from myself: all has been to the reader's advantage.\r\n\r\nFor this book of my Roman Embassy there has been no lack of materials;\r\nthey are of three kinds:\r\n\r\nThe first contain the story of my innermost sentiments and of my\r\nprivate life, as related in the letters addressed to Madame Récamier.\r\n\r\nThe second set forth my public life: those are my dispatches.\r\n\r\nThe third are a medley of historical details concerning the popes,\r\nold Roman society, the changes that have taken place from century to\r\ncentury in that society, and so on.\r\n\r\nAmong these investigations are thoughts and descriptions, the fruit\r\nof my rambles. All this has been written in the space of seven months,\r\nthe time of the duration of my embassy, in the midst of festivities or\r\nserious occupations[501]. Nevertheless, my health was impaired. I could\r\nnot lift up my eyes without feeling dizziness; to admire the sky, I\r\nwas obliged to place it around me by climbing to the top of a palace\r\nor a hill. But I cured the lassitude of the body by means of mental\r\napplication: the exercise of my thought renewed my physical vigour;\r\nwhat would kill another man gives me life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My journey to Rome.]\r\n\r\nIn revising all this, I have been struck with one thing. On my arrival\r\nin the Eternal City, I feel a certain dislike and, for a moment, I\r\nbelieve that everything has changed; little by little, the fever of\r\nthe ruins overtakes me and I end, like a thousand other travellers, by\r\nadoring that which left me cold at first. Nostalgia is the regret of\r\none's native country; on the banks of the Tiber we also suffer from\r\n\"home-sickness,\" but it produces an opposite effect to its customary\r\neffect: we are seized with the love of solitudes and the distaste for\r\nour own country. I had already felt this \"sickness\" at the time of my\r\nfirst visit, and I was able to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agnosco veteris vestigia flammæ[502].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know how, when the Martignac Ministry was formed, the mere name\r\nof Italy had dispelled what remained of my repugnance; but I am never\r\nsure of my disposition in matters of joy: no sooner had I set out with\r\nMadame Chateaubriand than my natural melancholy joined me on the way.\r\nYou shall convince yourselves of this by my diary of the road:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"LAUSANNE, 22 _September_ 1828.\r\n\r\n    \"I left Paris on the 14th of this month; I spent the 16th at\r\n    Villeneuve-sur-Yonne: what memories! Joubert is gone; the\r\n    deserted Château de Passy[503] has changed masters; I have\r\n    been told, 'Be thou the cricket of the nights: _Esto cicada\r\n    noctium._'\"\r\n\r\n    \"ARONA, 25 _September_.\r\n\r\n    \"Arriving at Lausanne on the 22nd, I followed the road along\r\n    which disappeared two other women who wished me well and who,\r\n    in the order of nature, should have survived me. One, Madame\r\n    la Marquise de Custine, came to die at Bex; the other, Madame\r\n    la Duchesse de Duras, was hastening, not a year ago, to the\r\n    Simplon, flying before the face of death which overtook her\r\n    at Nice[504].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Noble Clara_, digne et constante amie,\r\n    Ton souvenir ne vit plus en ces lieux;\r\n    De ce tombeau l'on détourne les yeux;\r\n    Ton nom s'efface et le monde t'oublie[505]!\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The last letter which I received from Madame de Duras brings\r\n    home to us the bitterness of that last drop of life which we\r\n    shall all have to drain:\r\n\r\n    \"'NICE, 14 _November_ 1828.\r\n\r\n    \"'I have sent you an _asclepias carnata_; it is a laurel\r\n    creeper which grows in the open air, is not afraid of\r\n    the cold, and has a red flower like the camélia, with\r\n    an excellent smell; plant it under the windows of the\r\n    Benedictine's Library.\r\n\r\n    \"'I will tell you my news in a word: it is always the same\r\n    thing; I droop on my sofa all day, that is to say, all the\r\n    time that I am not driving or walking out, which I cannot do\r\n    for more than half-an-hour a day. I dream of the past: my\r\n    life has been so agitated, so varied, that I cannot say that\r\n    I am violently bored: if I could only do some needle-work or\r\n    rug-work, I should not feel unhappy. My present life is so\r\n    far removed from my past life that it seems to me as though I\r\n    were reading Memoirs or watching a play[506].'\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And so I have returned to Italy deprived of my friends, as I\r\n    left it five and twenty years ago.

Leaning on the balcony of the inn at Arona,\r\n    I gazed at the banks of the Lago Maggiore, blazoned with the\r\n    gold of the setting sun and edged with azure. Nothing was\r\n    more agreeable than this landscape, which the Castle edged\r\n    with its battlements. This sight afforded me neither pleasure\r\n    nor sentiment. The years of spring-time wed their hopes to\r\n    what they see; a young man goes a-roaming with what he loves,\r\n    or with the memories of his absent happiness. If he have no\r\n    bond, he seeks one; he flatters himself at each step that he\r\n    will find something; thoughts of felicity haunt him: this\r\n    disposition of his soul is reflected upon surrounding objects.\r\n\r\n    \"However, I notice the littleness of present society less\r\n    when I find myself alone.

She had concluded from this that we were in an\r\n    inn haunted by ghosts or inhabited by robbers. I had noticed\r\n    no shock as I lay in bed; nevertheless it was the case that\r\n    an earthquake had been felt in the Apennines: that which\r\n    overturns cities is able to throw down a woman's clothes.\r\n    I said as much to Madame de Chateaubriand; I also told her\r\n    that, in Spain, in the Vega del Xenil, I had passed without\r\n    accident through a village which had been turned upside\r\n    down the day before by a subterranean concussion.

He believes in revolutions, and goes so far as\r\nto think that, if he lives long enough, he has a chance of seeing the\r\nfall of the temporal power of the Papacy.\r\n\r\nThe cardinals are divided into three factions:\r\n\r\nThe first consists of those who try to march with the times; among\r\nthese are Benvenuti[559] and Oppizoni[560]. Benvenuti has become famous\r\nthrough his extirpation of brigandage and his mission to Ravenna\r\nafter Cardinal Rivarola[561]; Oppizoni, Archbishop of Bologna, has\r\nconciliated the various shades of opinion in this industrial and\r\nliterary town so difficult to govern.\r\n\r\nThe second faction is formed of the _zelanti_, who try to go backwards:\r\none of their leaders is Cardinal Odescalchi[562].\r\n\r\nLastly, the third faction comprises the immovable men, old men who will\r\nnot or cannot go either forwards or backwards: among these old ones is\r\nCardinal Vidoni[563], a kind of gendarme of the Treaty of Tolentino:\r\ntall and fat, with a red face, and a skull-cap worn on one side. When\r\nyou tell him that he has a chance of the Papacy, he replies, \"_Lo santo\r\nSpirito sarebber dunque ubriaco!_\" He plants trees at Ponte-Mole, where\r\nConstantine made the world Christian. I see those trees when I leave\r\nRome by the Porta del Popolo to return by the Porta Angelica. The\r\nmoment he catches sight of me at a distance, the cardinal shouts, \"_Ah!\r\nah! Signor Ambasciadore di Francia!_\" and then flies out against the\r\nmen who plant his pines. He does not follow the cardinalist etiquette;\r\nhe goes out accompanied by a single footman in a carriage to his fancy:\r\npeople forgive him everything, content to call him Madama Vidoni[564].\r\n\r\nMy ambassadorial colleagues are Count Lützow, the Austrian Ambassador,\r\na polished man; his wife sings well, always the same air, and is always\r\ntalking of her \"little children;\" the learned Baron Bunsen[565], the\r\nPrussian Minister, and friend of Niebuhr[566] the historian (I am\r\nin treaty with him to have the lease of his palace on the Capitol\r\ncancelled in my favour); Prince Gagarin, the Russian Minister, exiled\r\namong the past grandeurs of Rome by reason of banished loves: if he was\r\npreferred by the beautiful Madame Narischkine[567], who for a moment\r\ninhabited my hermitage at Aulnay, there must be some charm in his bad\r\ntemper; we prevail rather through our defects than our good qualities.\r\n\r\nM. de Labrador[568], the Spanish Ambassador, a faithful man, talks\r\nlittle, walks about alone, thinks a great deal, or does not think at\r\nall, I cannot make out which.\r\n\r\nOld Count Fuscaldo represents Naples as winter represents spring.\r\nHe has a great cardboard placard on which he studies, through his\r\nspectacles, not the rose-fields of Pæstum, but the names of\r\nsuspicious foreigners to whose passports he must not put his visa. I\r\nenvy him his palace (the Farnese), an admirable unfinished structure,\r\ncrowned by Michael Angelo, painted by Annibale Carracci, aided by his\r\nbrother Agostino, and sheltering under its portico the sarcophagus\r\nof Cæcilia Metella, who has lost nothing by the change of mausoleum.\r\nFuscaldo, ragged in mind and body, is said to have a mistress.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Celles[569], Ambassador of the King of the Netherlands,\r\nwas married to Mademoiselle de Valence[570], who is now dead. He has\r\nhad two daughters by her, who are consequently great-grand-daughters\r\nof Madame de Genlis. M. de Celles has remained a prefect because he\r\nused to be one; his character is that medley of the gossip, the petty\r\ntyrant, the recruiting sergeant and the steward which one never loves.\r\nIf you meet a man who, instead of acres, yards and feet, talks to\r\nyou of hectares, metres and decimetres, you have laid your hand on a\r\nprefect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My ambassadorial colleagues.]\r\n\r\nM. de Funchal, the semi-acknowledged Ambassador of Portugal, is a\r\nlittle, fat man, excitable, grimacing, green as a Brazil monkey and\r\nyellow as a Lisbon orange: he sings his negress, however, this modern\r\nCamoëns. A great lover of music, he keeps a sort of Paganini[571] in\r\nhis pay while awaiting the restoration of his King[572].\r\n\r\nHere and there I have caught glimpses of little sly-boots of ministers\r\nof various little States, very much scandalized to see how cheaply I\r\nhold my embassy: their buttoned-up, solemn and silent importance walks\r\nclose-legged and with short steps: it looks ready to burst with secrets\r\nwhich it does not know.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs ambassador in England in 1822[573], sought out the places and men\r\nthat I had formerly known in London in 1793; as Ambassador to the Holy\r\nSee in 1828, I hastened to visit the palaces and ruins, to ask after\r\nthe persons whom I had seen in Rome in 1803: of the palaces and ruins I\r\nhave found many there; of the persons, few.\r\n\r\nThe Palazzo Lancellotti, formerly let to Cardinal Fesch, is now\r\noccupied by its real owners, Prince Lancellotti[573] and the Princess\r\nLancellotti[574], daughter of Prince Massimo[575]. The house in which\r\nMadame de Beaumont lived, on the Piazza d'Espagna, has disappeared. As\r\nto Madame de Beaumont, she has remained in her last asylum and I have\r\nprayed with Pope Leo XII. at her tomb.\r\n\r\nCanova has also taken leave of the world[576]. I twice visited him in\r\nhis studio in 1803; he received me mallet in hand. He showed me, with\r\nthe simplest and gentlest air, his enormous statue of Bonaparte and\r\nhis Hercules and Lichas: he was anxious to persuade you that he was\r\nable to achieve energy of form; but even then his chisel refused to dig\r\ndeep into anatomy; the nymph lingered in the flesh in spite of him, and\r\nHebe reappeared in the wrinkles of his old men. I have met the first\r\nsculptor of my time upon my road; he has fallen from his scaffold, as\r\nGoujon[577] fell from the scaffold at the Louvre: death is always there\r\nto continue the eternal St. Bartholomew and to lay us low with its\r\ndarts.\r\n\r\nBut there is one still alive, to my great delight, and that is my old\r\nBoquet, the oldest of the French painters in Rome. Twice had he tried\r\nto leave his beloved _campagne_; he has gone as far as Genoa; his\r\nheart has failed him, and he has returned to his adopted home. I have\r\ncockered him up at the Embassy, as well as his son, for whom he has the\r\ntenderness of a mother. I have begun our old walks over again with him;\r\nI notice his old age only by the slowness of his steps; I feel a sort\r\nof emotion when I mimic a little child and measure my strides by his.\r\nWe have neither of us much longer before us to see the Tiber flow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman artists.]\r\n\r\nThe great artists, at their great period, led a very different life\r\nfrom that which they lead now: attached to the ceilings of the Vatican,\r\nto the walls of St. Peter's, to the partitions of the Farnese, they\r\nworked at their master-pieces suspended with them in mid-air.\r\nRaphael walked surrounded by his pupils, escorted by cardinals and\r\nprinces, like a senator of Ancient Rome, preceded and followed by\r\nhis clients. Charles V. sat thrice to Titian[578]. He picked up his\r\nbrush, and yielded the right to him when walking, even as Francis\r\nI. attended Leonardo da Vinci[579] on his death-bed. Titian went in\r\ntriumph to Rome; the immense Buonarotti received him there: at the\r\nage of ninety-nine, at Venice, Titian still held with a firm hand his\r\ncentury-old brush, the conqueror of the centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Grand-duke of Tuscany[580] secretly disinterred Michael Angelo,\r\nwho had died in Rome after laying, at the age of eighty-eight, the\r\ncoping-stone of the cupola of St. Peter's. Florence, with a magnificent\r\nfuneral, expiated on the ashes of its great painter the neglect which\r\nit had shown to the ashes of Dante, its great poet.\r\n\r\nVelasquez[581] twice visited Italy, and Italy twice rose to greet him.\r\nThe precursor of Murillo[582] resumed the road to Spain laden with the\r\nfruits of that Ausonian Hesperia, which had fallen into his hands: he\r\ncarried away a picture by each of the twelve most celebrated painters\r\nof that time.\r\n\r\nThose famous artists spent their days in adventures and feasting; they\r\ndefended towns and castles; they built churches, palaces and ramparts;\r\nthey gave and received mighty sword-thrusts, seduced women, took refuge\r\nin the cloisters, were absolved by the popes and saved by the princes.\r\nIn an orgy described by Benvenuto Cellini we see the names figure of\r\nMichael Angelo and of Giulio Romano[583].\r\n\r\nTo-day the scene has greatly changed; the artists in Rome live poor\r\nand in retirement. Perhaps this life contains a poetry which is as\r\ngood as the first. A society of German painters[584] has set itself\r\nto carry painting back to Perugino[585], in order to restore to it its\r\nChristian inspiration. Those young neophytes of St. Luke[586] maintain\r\nthat Raphael, in his second manner, became a pagan and that his talent\r\ndegenerated. Be it so; let us be pagans like the Raphaelite Virgins;\r\nlet our talent degenerate and grow enfeebled as in the picture of the\r\n_Transfiguration!_ This creditable error of the new sacred school is\r\nnone the less an error; it would follow that the stiffness and bad\r\ndrawing of the forms would be a proof of intuitive vision, whereas that\r\nexpression of faith which we observe in the works of the painters who\r\nprecede the Renascence comes from the fact, not that the figures are\r\nposed squarely and motionless as sphinxes but that painting believed\r\nas did its century. It is the thought, not the painting, of the\r\ncentury that is religious; so true is this, that the Spanish School\r\nis eminently pious in its expression, notwithstanding that it has the\r\ngrace and movement of the painting subsequent to the Renascence. Whence\r\ndoes this come? From the fact that _the Spaniards are Christians._\r\n\r\nI go to see the artists separately at work; the pupil sculptor lives\r\nin some grotto, under the evergreen oaks of the Villa Medici, where he\r\nfinishes his marble child giving a serpent to drink out of a shell. The\r\npainter inhabits a dilapidated house in some deserted spot; I find him\r\nalone, taking through his open window some view of the Roman Campagna.\r\nM. Schnetz's[587] _Brigand's Wife_ has become the mother asking of\r\nthe Madonna the cure of her son. Léopold Robert[588], returning from\r\nNaples, passed through Rome recently, bringing with him the enchanted\r\nscenes of that lovely clime, which he has simply stuck on to his canvas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guérin, Horace Vernet, Quecq.]\r\n\r\nGuérin has retired, like a sick dove, to the top of a pavilion of the\r\nVilla Medici. He listens, with his head under his wing, to the sound of\r\nthe wind from the Tiber; when he wakes up, he makes a pen-drawing of\r\nthe Death of Priam.\r\n\r\nHorace Vernet[589] is struggling to change his manner: will he succeed?\r\nThe snake which he twines round his neck, the dress which he affects,\r\nthe cigar which he smokes, the masks and foils with which he surrounds\r\nhimself remind one too much of the bivouac.\r\n\r\nWho has ever heard speak of my friend M. Quecq[590], the successor\r\nof Julius III.[591] in the cabin of Michael Angelo, Vignola[592] and\r\nTaddeo Zuccaro[593]? And yet he painted the _Death of Vitellius_ none\r\ntoo badly, in his nymphic grotto seized under distress. The waste\r\ngarden-plots are haunted by a crafty animal which M. Quecq occupies\r\nhimself in hunting: it is a fox, the great-grandson of Reynard the Fox,\r\nfirst of the name, and nephew of Ysengrin the Wolf.\r\n\r\nPinelli[594], between two fits of drunkenness, has promised me twelve\r\nscenes of dances, gambling and robbers. It is a pity that he starves\r\nthe big dog which lies at his door. Thorwaldsen[595] and Camuccini[596]\r\nare the two princes of the poor artists of Rome.\r\n\r\nSometimes those scattered artists meet and go together, on foot, to\r\nSubiaco. On the road, they scrawl grotesque figures on the walls of the\r\ninn at Tivoli. One day, perhaps, some Michael Angelo will be recognised\r\nby the charcoal drawing which he will have made on a work of Raphael's.\r\n\r\nI would like to have been born an artist: the solitude, the\r\nindependence, the sunshine amid ruins and master-pieces would suit me.\r\nI have no wants; a piece of bread, a pitcher of the _Aqua Felice_ would\r\ncontent me. My life has been wretchedly caught in the thickets on my\r\nroad; how happy should I have been, had I been the free bird that sings\r\nand builds its nest in those thickets!\r\n\r\nNicolas Poussin bought, out of his wife's dowry, a house on the Pincian\r\nHill, opposite another _casino_ which had belonged to Claude Gelée,\r\nsurnamed Lorraine[597]. My other fellow-countryman, Claude, also died\r\nin the lap of the Queen of the World[598]. If Poussin reproduces the\r\nRoman Campagna, even when the scene of his landscapes is set elsewhere,\r\nClaude Lorraine reproduces the skies of Rome, even when he paints ships\r\nand a sunset at sea.\r\n\r\nWhy was I not the contemporary of certain privileged creatures to whom\r\nI feel attracted in the different centuries? But I should have had to\r\nrise from the dead too often. Poussin and Claude Lorraine have trodden\r\nthe Capitol; kings have come there and not been worth so much as they.\r\nDe Brosses[599] there met the English Pretender[600]; I found there, in\r\n1803, the abdicated King of Sardinia and to-day, in 1828, I see there\r\nNapoleon's brother, the King of Westphalia. Rome in her decline offers\r\nan asylum to the fallen powers; her ruins are a place of sanctuary for\r\npersecuted glory and unfortunate talents.\r\n\r\nIf I had painted Roman society, a quarter of a century ago, as I\r\nhave just painted the Roman Campagna, I should be obliged to retouch\r\nmy portrait; it would no longer be like. Every generation lasts\r\nthirty-three years, the life of Christ (Christ is the type of all\r\nthings); every generation in our western world changes its outward\r\naspect. Man is placed in a picture whose frame is invariable, but\r\nwhose figures move. Rabelais[601] was in this city, in 1536, with the\r\nCardinal du Bellay[602]; he performed the functions of house-steward to\r\nHis Eminence; he \"carved and handed.\"\r\n\r\nRabelais, changed into \"Friar John of the Funnels,\" is not of the\r\nopinion of Montaigne, who heard scarce any bells in Rome and \"fewer\r\nthan in the most insignificant town in France[603];\" Rabelais, on\r\nthe contrary, hears many in the \"Ringing Island\" (Rome): \"some of us\r\ndoubted that it was the Dodonian Kettle[604].\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Old-time visitors to Rome.]\r\n\r\nFour and forty years after Rabelais, Montaigne found the banks of the\r\nTiber planted, and he observed that, on the 16th of March, there were\r\nroses and artichokes in Rome. The churches were bare, without statues\r\nof saints, without pictures, less ornate and less beautiful than the\r\nFrench churches. Montaigne was accustomed to \"the cloudy vastitie and\r\ngloomy canopies of our churches[605];\" he speaks several times of St.\r\nPeter's without describing it, insensible or indifferent as he appears\r\nto be to the arts. In the presence of so many master-pieces, no name\r\noffers itself to Montaigne's recollection; his memory does not speak to\r\nhim of Raphael nor of Michael Angelo, not yet sixteen years dead.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, ideas on the arts, on the philosophic influence of the\r\ngeniuses which have magnified or protected them, were not yet born.\r\nTime does for men what space does for monuments; we judge both one and\r\nthe other correctly only at a distance and from the point of view of\r\nperspective; viewed from too near, we do not see them; from too far, we\r\nno longer see them.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Essayes_ looked in Rome only for Ancient Rome:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The buildings in this bastard Rome, which the moderns were\r\n    raising upon, or appending to, the glorious structures of\r\n    the antique world, though they sufficed enough to excite the\r\n    admiration of the present age, yet seemed to him to bear a\r\n    close resemblance to those nests which the rooks and the\r\n    swallows construct upon the roofs and walls of the churches\r\n    in France, which the Huguenots have demolished[606].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sort of idea had Montaigne of Ancient Rome, if he regarded St.\r\nPeter's as a swallow's nest, hung on to the walls of the Coliseum?\r\n\r\nThe new Roman citizen by an \"authenticke bull\" of the year 1581\r\nA.D.[607] had remarked that the Roman ladies wore no masks, as they did\r\nin France; they appeared in public resplendent with pearls and precious\r\nstones, but \"they had the waist exceedingly loose, which gives them all\r\nthe appearance of being with child.\" The men were dressed in black,\r\nand although they were \"dukes, marquisses, counts,\" they \"are somewhat\r\nmean-looking[608].\"\r\n\r\nIt is not singular that St. Jerome remarks the gait of the Roman women,\r\nwhich gives them the appearance of being with child: _solutis genibus\r\nfractus incessus?_\r\n\r\nAlmost every day, when I go out through the Porta Angelica, I see\r\na mean house not far from the Tiber with a smoky French sign-board\r\nrepresenting a bear; it was there that Michael Lord of Montaigne landed\r\non arriving at Rome, not far from the hospital which served as an\r\nasylum to that poor madman[609], \"one most fitted under the ayre of\r\ntrue ancient poesie,\" whom Montaigne saw \"in so piteous a plight\" at\r\nFerrara, and \"rather spited than pitied him[610].\"\r\n\r\nIt was a memorable event when the seventeenth century deputed its\r\ngreatest Protestant poet and its most serious genius to visit great\r\nCatholic Rome in 1638. Leaning against the Cross, holding the Old and\r\nNew Testaments in her hands, with the guilty generations driven from\r\nEden behind her and the redeemed generations descended from the Garden\r\nof Olives before her, she said to the heretic born of yesterday:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want of your old mother?\"\r\n\r\nLeonora[611], the Roman, bewitched Milton[612]. Has it ever been\r\nremarked that Leonora appears once again in the Memoirs of Madame de\r\nMotteville[613], at the concerts of Cardinal Mazarin[614]?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Milton, the Abbé Arnold.]\r\n\r\nThe order of dates brings the Abbé Arnauld[615] to Rome after Milton.\r\nThis abbé, who had borne arms, relates an anecdote which is curious\r\non account of the name of one of its persons, while, at the same\r\ntime, it brings before us the manners of the courtesans. The \"hero of\r\nthe fable,\" the Duc de Guise[616], grandson of the Balafré, going in\r\nsearch of his Naples adventure, passed through Rome, in 1647: he there\r\nknew Nina Barcarola. Maison-Blanche, secretary to M. Deshayes[617],\r\nAmbassador to Constantinople, took it into his head to become the rival\r\nof the Duc de Guise. It was a bad business for him; they substituted\r\n(it was at night, in an unlighted room) a hideous old hag for Nina:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If the laughter was great on one side,\" says Arnauld, \"the\r\n    confusion on the other side was as great, as may well be\r\n    imagined. The Adonis, extricating himself with difficulty\r\n    from his divinity's embraces, ran quite naked out of the\r\n    house, as though the devil were at his heels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal de Retz tells us nothing on the subject of Roman manners.\r\nI prefer \"little\" Coulanges[618] and his two journeys of 1656 and\r\n1689: he celebrates those \"vineyards\" and \"gardens\" whose mere names\r\npossess a charm. When I walk to the Porta Pia, I meet almost all the\r\npersons named by Coulanges: those persons? No: their grandsons and\r\ngrand-daughters!\r\n\r\nMadame de Sévigné receives verses from Coulanges; she replies to him\r\nfrom the Château des Rochers in my poor Brittany, at ten leagues from\r\nCombourg:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"What a sad date after yours, my amiable cousin! It suits a\r\n    solitary like myself, and that of Rome suits you, whose star\r\n    is a wandering one. How gently has fortune treated you, as\r\n    you say, even though it have fastened a quarrel on you!!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Coulanges' first journey to Rome, in 1656, and his second\r\njourney, in 1689, thirty-three years elapsed: I reckon only twenty-five\r\nyears wasted between my first journey to Rome, in 1803, and my second\r\njourney, in 1828. If I had known Madame de Sévigné, I should have cured\r\nher of the grief of growing old.\r\n\r\nSpon[619], Misson[620], Dumont[621], Addison[622] successively follow\r\nCoulanges. Spon, with Wheler, his companion, acted as my guide over the\r\nruins of Athens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dumont, Addison, Labat.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to read in Dumont how the master-pieces which we\r\nadmire were disposed at the time of his journey in 1690: one saw\r\nat the Belvedere the statues of the Nile and the Tiber[623], the\r\nAntinous[624], the Cleopatra, the Laocoon[625] and the supposed torso\r\nof Hercules[626]. Dumont places in the gardens of the Vatican \"the\r\nbronze peacocks which once adorned the tomb of Scipio Africanus.\"\r\n\r\nAddison travels as a \"scholar[627],\" his trip is summed up in classical\r\nquotations tinged with English recollections; when passing through\r\nParis, he presented his poems to M. Boileau[628].\r\n\r\nPère Labat[629] follows the author of Cato: a singular man, this\r\nParisian monk of the Order of Preaching Friars. A missionary to the\r\nAntilles, a filibuster, an able mathematician, architect and soldier, a\r\nbrave gunner levelling the cannon like a grenadier, a learned critic,\r\nwho had restored the Dieppois to the possession of their original\r\ndiscovery in Africa[630], he had a mind inclined to raillery and a\r\ncharacter to liberty. I know of no traveller who gives clearer and\r\nmore exact ideas concerning the Pontifical Government. Labat walks the\r\nstreets, goes to the processions, meddles in everything and laughs at\r\nnearly everything.\r\n\r\nThe Preaching Friar relates how the Capuchins, at Cadiz, gave him\r\nsheets to his bed which had been quite new since ten years, and how\r\nhe saw a St. Joseph dressed in the Spanish fashion, sword at side,\r\nhat under its arm, powdered hair, and spectacles on nose. In Rome he\r\nattends a mass:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Never,\" he says, \"have I seen so many mutilated musicians\r\n    together, nor so numerous a symphony. Those who were judges\r\n    said that there was nothing so fine. I said as much, to make\r\n    believe that I was a judge too; but, if I had not had the\r\n    honour to form one of the train of the officiating priest, I\r\n    should have left the ceremony, which lasted at least three\r\n    good hours, which seemed to me quite six.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more I come down to the time at which I write, the more do the\r\nusages of Rome begin to resemble the usages of to-day. In the time of\r\nDe Brosses, the Roman women wore false hair; the custom proceeded from\r\nfar back; Propertius asks his \"life\" why she delights in adorning her\r\nhair:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Quid juvat ornato precedere, vita, capillo[631]?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gallic women, our mothers, supplied the hair of the Severinas,\r\nPiscas, Faustinas, Sabinas. Velleda says to Eudorus, speaking of her\r\nhair:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis my diadem, and I have kept it for thee[632].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA head of hair was not the greatest conquest of the Romans, but it\r\nwas one of the most lasting: we often take from the tombs of women\r\nthe whole of that ornament, which has resisted the scissors of the\r\ndaughters of the night, and we look in vain for the comely brow which\r\nit adorned. The perfumed tresses, the object of the idolatry of the\r\nlightest of the passions, have outlived empires; death, which shatters\r\nall chains, has been unable to break that net. To-day the Italians wear\r\ntheir own hair, which the women of the people plait with coquettish\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nDe Brosses, the traveller magistrate, bears, in his portraits and\r\nwritings, a false air of Voltaire, with whom he had a comical dispute\r\nabout a field. De Brosses often sat chatting on the edge of the bed\r\nof a Princess Borghese. In 1803, I saw in the Borghese Palace another\r\nprincess who was shining with all the brilliancy of her brother's\r\nglory: Pauline Bonaparte is no more[633]! Had she lived in the days of\r\nRaphael, he would have represented her in the form of one of those\r\nLoves which recline on the backs of the lions in the Farnese Palace,\r\nand the same languor would have carried off the painter and the model.\r\nHow many flowers have already passed away in those plains in which I\r\nmade Jerome and Augustine, Eudorus and Cymodocœa roam!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Brosses, King James III.]\r\n\r\nDe Brosses represents the English on the Piazza d'Espagna much as we\r\nsee them to-day, living together, making a great noise, eyeing poor\r\nmortals from head to foot, and returning to their brick-red dog-hole in\r\nLondon, after scarce so much as glancing at the Coliseum. De Brosses\r\nobtained the honour of paying his court to James III.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Of the two sons of the Pretender,\" he says, \"the elder[634]\r\n    is about twenty years old, the younger[635] fifteen. I have\r\n    heard say by those who know them thoroughly that the elder\r\n    is worth by far the more and is better loved in private;\r\n    that he has a good heart and great courage; that he feels\r\n    his position keenly and that, if he does not escape from\r\n    it one day, it will not be for want of fearlessness. I was\r\n    told that, being taken, when quite young, to the siege of\r\n    Gaeta[636], at the time of the conquest of the Kingdom of\r\n    Naples by the Spaniards, during the crossing his hat came to\r\n    fall into the sea. They wanted to pick it up:\r\n\r\n    \"'No,' said he, 'it is not worth while; I shall surely have\r\n    to go to fetch it myself one day.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Brosses believes that, if the Prince of Wales attempts anything, he\r\nwill not succeed, and he gives his reasons. Returning to Rome after his\r\ngallant exploits, Charles Edward, who bore the name of Count of Albany,\r\nlost his father[637]; he married the Princess of Stolberg-Gedern[638]\r\nand settled in Tuscany. Is it true that he secretly visited London in\r\n1753 and 1761, as Hume tells us, that he was present at the coronation\r\nof George III., and that he said to some one who recognised him in the\r\ncrowd:\r\n\r\n\"The man who is the object of all this pomp is he whom I envy least?\"\r\n\r\nThe Pretender's was not a happy union; the Countess of Albany separated\r\nfrom him and fixed her residence in Rome: it was there that another\r\ntraveller, Bonstetten[639], met her; the Bernese gentleman, in his old\r\nage, gave me to understand, at Geneva, that he had letters written in\r\nthe first youth of the Countess of Albany[640].\r\n\r\nAlfieri saw the wife of the Pretender at Florence, and fell in love\r\nwith her for life:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Twelve years afterwards,\" he says, \"at the moment I am\r\n    writing, and at an age when the illusions of the passions\r\n    have ceased to operate, I feel that I become daily more\r\n    attached to her, in proportion as time destroys the\r\n    brilliancy of her fleeting beauty, the only charm which she\r\n    owes not to herself. Whenever I reflect on her virtues, my\r\n    soul is elevated, improved and tranquillized, and I dare to\r\n    affirm that the feelings of her mind, which I have uniformly\r\n    endeavoured to fortify and confirm, are not dissimilar to my\r\n    own[641].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have met Madame d'Albany at Florence; age had apparently produced\r\nin her an effect contrary to that which it generally produces: time\r\nennobles the countenance and, when it belongs to an old race, imprints\r\nsome trace of that race on the brow which it has marked; the Countess\r\nof Albany was thick-set, with expressionless features and a common air.\r\nIf the women in Rubens' pictures were to grow old, they would be like\r\nMadame d'Albany at the age at which I met her. I am sorry that that\r\nheart, \"fortified and confirmed\" by Alfieri, should have had need of\r\nanother support[642]. I will here recall a passage from my Letter on\r\nRome to M. de Fontanes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Do you know that I only once saw Count Alfieri in my life,\r\n    and could you guess how? I saw him laid in his bier: I was\r\n    told that he had hardly altered; his physiognomy appeared to\r\n    me to be noble and grave; death doubtless gave it an added\r\n    severity; the coffin was a little too short, and they bent\r\n    the dead man's head upon his breast, which caused him to make\r\n    a terrible movement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is so sad as, at the end of our days, to read what we have\r\nwritten in our youth: all that was in the present is now in the past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Henry IX.]\r\n\r\nI saw for a moment in Rome, in 1803, the Cardinal of York, Henry IX.,\r\nthat last of the Stuarts[643], then seventy-nine years of age. He had\r\nhad the weakness to accept a pension from George III.: the widow of\r\nCharles I.[644] had in vain begged one from Cromwell. Thus the House of\r\nStuart took one hundred and nineteen years to die out after losing the\r\nthrone which it never recovered. Three pretenders have handed on to\r\none another in exile the shadow of a crown; they had intelligence and\r\ncourage: what did they lack? The hand of God.\r\n\r\nBesides, the Stuarts consoled themselves at the sight of Rome; they\r\nwere but one slight accident the more in those vast fragments, a small\r\nshattered column raised in the midst of a great burial-ground of ruins.\r\nTheir House, in disappearing from the world, enjoyed yet this further\r\ncomfort: it saw the fall of old Europe; the fatality clinging to the\r\nStuarts dragged other kings with them to the dust, among whom was Louis\r\nXVI., whose grandfather had refused an asylum to the descendant of\r\nCharles I.[645], and Charles X. has died in exile at the age of the\r\nCardinal of York, and his son and his grandson are wanderers on the\r\nface of the earth!\r\n\r\nLalande's[646] Journey in Italy, in 1765 and 1766, remains the best and\r\nthe most exact as regards the Rome of the arts and of antiquities:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I like to read the historians and poets,\" he says, \"but one\r\n    could not read them with more pleasure than when treading the\r\n    soil which bore them, climbing the hills they describe, and\r\n    watching the flow of the rivers they have sung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is not so bad for an astronomer who used to eat spiders.\r\n\r\nDuclos[647], who is almost as lean and dry as Lalande, makes this\r\nshrewd observation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The plays of the different nations give a fairly correct\r\n    image of their manners. Harlequin, the valet and the\r\n    principal character in the Italian comedies, is always\r\n    represented with a great desire for eating, which comes\r\n    from an habitual need. Our own comedy valets are commonly\r\n    drunkards, which may imply debauchery, but not penury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe declamatory admiration of Dupaty[648] offers no compensation\r\nfor the aridity of Duclos and Lalande; still it makes one feel the\r\npresence of Rome; one feels by reflex that eloquence of descriptive\r\nstyle is born under the breath of Rousseau, _spiraculum vitæ._ Dupaty\r\napproaches the new school which was soon to substitute sentimentality,\r\nobscurity and mannerism for the truthfulness, clarity and naturalness\r\nof Voltaire. Nevertheless, across his affected jargon, Dupaty observes\r\ncorrectly; he explains the patience of the people of Rome through the\r\nage of their successive pontiffs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A pope,\" he says, \"is always to them a dying king[649].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDupaty sees night approach at the Villa Borghese:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"There remains but one ray of day... it is expiring on the\r\n    brow of that Venus[650].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWould the poets of our day say better? He takes leave of Tivoli:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Adieu, thou valley!... I am a stranger; I do not inhabit\r\n    your beautiful Italy; I shall never behold you more: but\r\n    perhaps my children, some at least of my children, will come\r\n    to visit you one day; appear but as charming in their eyes as\r\n    you have to their father[651].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Some of the children\" of the scholar and poet have visited Rome, and\r\nthey could have seen the last ray of sunlight expire on the brow of the\r\nVenus Genitrix of Dupaty[652].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dupaty, Goethe.]\r\n\r\nScarce had Dupaty left Rome when Goethe came to take his place[653].\r\nDid the president of the Parliament of Bordeaux ever hear speak of\r\nGoethe? And nevertheless the name of Goethe lives on this earth whence\r\nthat of Dupaty has vanished. It is not that I love the mighty genius\r\nof Germany; I have little sympathy for the poet of matter: I feel\r\nSchiller, I understand Goethe. There may be great beauties in the\r\nenthusiasm which Goethe experiences in Rome for Jupiter: excellent\r\ncritics think so; but I prefer the God of the Cross to the God of\r\nOlympus. I look in vain for the author of _Werther_ along the banks of\r\nthe Tiber; I find him only in this phrase:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"My present life is as it were a dream of youth; we shall see\r\n    if I am fated to enjoy it, or to recognise that this too is\r\n    vain, as so many others have been.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon's eagle allowed Rome to escape from its claws, she fell\r\nback into the bosom of her peaceful pastors: then Byron appeared at the\r\ncrumbling walls of the Cæsars[654]; he flung his distressed imagination\r\nover so many ruins, like a mourning cloak. Rome, thou hadst a name, he\r\ngave thee another; that name will cling to thee; he called thee:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Niobe of nations! there she stands,\r\n     Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;\r\n     An empty urn within her wither'd hands,\r\n     Whose holy dust was scatter'd long ago[655].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that last storm of poetry, Byron was not long in dying[656]. I\r\nmight have seen Byron at Geneva, and I did not see him; I might have\r\nseen Goethe at Weimar, and I did not see him; but I saw Madame de Staël\r\ndie, who, disdaining to live beyond her youth, passed swiftly to the\r\nCapitol with Corinne: imperishable names, illustrious ashes, which\r\nhave associated themselves with the name and the ashes of the Eternal\r\nCity[657].\r\n\r\n\r\nThus have the changes in manners and persons proceeded from century to\r\ncentury in Italy; but the great transformation has been worked, above\r\nall, by our two occupations of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe \"Roman Republic,\" established under the influence of the\r\nDirectorate, ridiculous as it was with its two \"consuls\" and its\r\n\"lictors\" (scurvy _facchini_ taken from the populace), for all that,\r\nmade excellent innovations in the civil laws: it was from the\r\nprefectures, invented by that \"Roman Republic,\" that Bonaparte borrowed\r\nthe institution of his own prefects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Roman Republic.\"]\r\n\r\nWe brought to Rome the germ of an administration which had no\r\nexistence; Rome, become the chief town of the Department of the Tiber,\r\nwas superlatively well ruled. Its mortgage system it owes to us. The\r\nsuppression of the convents, the sale of ecclesiastical property\r\nsanctioned by Pius VII. have diminished the faith in the permanence of\r\nthe consecration of religious things. The famous _Index_, which still\r\nmakes a little noise on our side of the Alps, makes none at all in\r\nRome: for a few _bajocchi_ you obtain permission to read the forbidden\r\nwork with a safe conscience. The _Index_ is one of those works which\r\nremain as evidences of the old times in the midst of the new. In the\r\nRepublics of Rome and Athens, were not the titles of \"King,\" the names\r\nof the great families adhering to the Monarchy respectfully preserved?\r\nIt is only the French who foolishly take offense at their tombs and\r\ntheir annals, who hurl down the crosses, devastate the churches, out of\r\ngrudge against the clergy of the Year of Grace 1000 or 1100. There is\r\nnothing more puerile or more stupid than those reminiscent outrages;\r\nnothing which would tend more to the belief that we are incapable of\r\nanything serious whatsoever, that the true principles of liberty will\r\nfor ever remain unknown to us. Far from despising the past, we ought,\r\nas all nations do, to treat it as a venerable greybeard, who sits by\r\nour fireside telling what he has seen: what harm can he do us? He\r\ninstructs and amuses us with his stories, his ideas, his language, his\r\nmanners, his habits of former days; but he is without strength, and\r\nhis hands are weak and trembling. Can it be that we are afraid of that\r\ncontemporary of our fathers, who would already be with them in the\r\ntomb, if he could die, and who has no authority, save that of their\r\ndust?\r\n\r\nThe French, passing through Rome, left their principles there: that is\r\nwhat always happens when the conquest is accomplished by a people more\r\nadvanced in civilization than the people which undergoes that conquest,\r\nas witness the Greeks in Asia under Alexander, as witness the French\r\nin Europe under Napoleon. Bonaparte, when snatching sons from their\r\nmothers, when forcing the Italian nobility to leave its palaces and\r\nbear arms, was hastening the transformation of the national spirit.\r\n\r\nAs to the physiognomy of Roman society, on days of concerts or\r\nballs one might have thought himself in Paris. The Altieris[658],\r\nthe Palestrinas[659], the Zagarolos[660], the Del Dragos[661], the\r\nLantes[662], the Lozzanos would not have felt strangers in the\r\ndrawing-rooms of the Faubourg Saint-Germain: still, some of those women\r\nwear a certain frightened air which has, I believe, to do with the\r\nclimate. The charming Falconieri, for instance, always stands near a\r\ndoor, ready to fly to the Monte Mario if you look at her: the Villa\r\nMillini[663] belongs to her; a novel placed in that abandoned lodge,\r\nunder the cypress trees, in view of the sea, would have its value.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the changes in manners and persons, from century to\r\ncentury, in Italy may be, we observe a habit of greatness there which\r\nwe paltry barbarians cannot approach. There still remains Roman blood\r\nin Rome and the traditions of the masters of the world. When one sees\r\nforeigners crammed into small new houses at the Porta del Popolo, or\r\nlodged in palaces which they have divided into boxes and pierced with\r\nchimneys, it is as though one saw rats scratching at the feet of the\r\nmonuments of Apollodorus[664] and Michael Angelo and gnawing holes into\r\nthe pyramids.\r\n\r\nTo-day, the Roman nobles, ruined by the Revolution, immure themselves\r\nwithin their palaces, live parsimoniously and have become their own\r\nstewards. When you have the good fortune, which happens very rarely,\r\nto be received by them in the evening, you pass through vast halls,\r\nunfurnished and scarcely lighted, along which antique statues stand out\r\nwhite against the thick shadow, like phantoms or exhumed corpses. At\r\nthe end of those halls, the ragged footman who leads the way ushers you\r\ninto a sort of gynecæum: around a table are seated three or four, old\r\nor young, ill-dressed women, plying their needles at fancy-work, by the\r\nlight of a lamp, and exchanging a few words with a father, a brother,\r\na husband recumbent in the dim background on tattered arm-chairs.\r\nNevertheless, there is something, I know not what, fine, sovereign,\r\nappertaining to high breeding, in this assemblage entrenched behind its\r\nmaster-pieces and giving a first impression of a witches' Sabbath. The\r\nspecies of the _cicisbei_ is extinct, although a few shawl-bearing and\r\nfootwarmer-carrying abbés survive; here and there, a cardinal still\r\nfixes himself in a woman's house like a sofa.\r\n\r\nNepotism and pontifical scandals are no longer possible, just as kings\r\ncan no longer keep titular and honoured mistresses. Nowadays, when\r\npolitics and the tragic adventures of love have ceased to fill the\r\nlives of the great ladies of Rome, how do they spend their time in the\r\ninterior of their homes? It would be interesting to get to the bottom\r\nof these new manners; if I stay in Rome, I shall make it my business to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI visited Tivoli in 1803; at that time I said, in a narrative which was\r\nprinted then:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"This spot is suited to reflection and day-dreams; I go back\r\n    into my past life; I feel the burden of the present; I seek\r\n    to penetrate the future; where shall I be, what shall I be\r\n    doing and what shall I be _twenty years hence_?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years! It seemed a century to me; I thought myself certain of\r\ninhabiting my tomb before that century had lapsed. And it is not I that\r\nhave passed away, but the master of the world and his empire that have\r\nsped!\r\n\r\nAlmost all the ancient and modern travellers saw in the Roman Campagna\r\nonly what they call \"its horror and its nudity.\" Montaigne himself, who\r\nassuredly was not lacking in imagination, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Far away on the left lay the Apennines; the aspect of the\r\n    foreground was exceedingly unpleasant to the eye, hilly, with\r\n    every here and there deep marshes... the country ...open,\r\n    barren, and altogether destitute of trees, and almost equally\r\n    so of houses[665].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Milton casts upon the Roman Campagna a look as dry and\r\nbarren as his faith. Lalande and the Président De Brosses are as blind\r\nas Milton. Only in M. de Bonstetten's _Voyage sur la scène des six\r\nderniers livres de l'Énéide_, published at Geneva in 1804, one year\r\nafter my Letter to M. de Fontanes (printed in the _Mercure_ at the end\r\nof the year 1803), do we find any true sensations of that admirable\r\nsolitude, and even they are mingled with objurgations:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"What a pleasure to read Virgil under the sky of Æneas\r\n    and, so to speak, in the presence of the gods of Homer!\" says\r\n    M. de Bonstetten. \"What a profound solitude in these deserts\r\n    in which we behold only the sea, ruined woods, trees, great\r\n    meadows, and not one inhabitant! In a vast extent of country,\r\n    I saw but a single house, and that house was near me, on the\r\n    summit of a hill. I went to it, it had no door; I climbed a\r\n    stair-case, I entered a sort of chamber, a bird of prey had\r\n    built its nest there....\r\n\r\n    \"I stood some time at the window of that abandoned house. I\r\n    saw at my feet that declivity, so rich and so magnificent in\r\n    Pliny's day, now uncultivated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my description of the Roman Campagna, they have passed from\r\ndisparagement to enthusiasm. The English and French travellers who have\r\nfollowed me have marked all their steps from the Storta to Rome by\r\necstasies. M. de Tournon[666], in his _Études statistiques_, enters the\r\nroad of admiration which I had the happiness to open:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Roman Campagna,\" he says, \"unfolds more distinctly,\r\n    at each step, the serious beauty of its immense lines,\r\n    its numerous plains and its fine frame of mountains. Its\r\n    monotonous grandeur impresses and elevates the thought.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no need to mention M. Simond[667], whose journey reads like a\r\nwager, so much does he amuse himself by looking at Rome upside down. I\r\nwas at Geneva when he died almost suddenly. A farmer, he had just cut\r\nhis hay and gaily reaped his first grain, when he went to join his mown\r\ngrass and his gathered harvest.\r\n\r\nWe have a few letters of the great landscape painters; Poussin and\r\nClaude Lorraine do not say a word about the Roman Campagna. But,\r\nif their pen is silent, their brush speaks; the _Agro Romano_ was a\r\nmysterious source of beauty, at which they drew, while hiding it by a\r\nsort of avarice of genius and as it were in fear, lest it should be\r\nprofaned by the vulgar. Strange that it should be French eyes that best\r\nsaw the light of Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vandalism in the Campagna.]\r\n\r\nI have read again my Letter to M. de Fontanes on Rome, written five\r\nand twenty years ago, and I confess that I have found it so exact\r\nthat it would be impossible for me to take away or add a word to it.\r\nA foreign company has come this winter (1829) to propose to clear the\r\nRoman Campagna: ah, gentlemen, spare us your cottages and your English\r\ngardens on the Janiculum! If ever they were to disfigure the waste\r\nlands against which the ploughshare of Cincinnatus struck, on which\r\nall the grasses bend before the breath of the centuries, I should\r\nfly Rome, never to set foot in it again. Go to drag your improved\r\nploughs elsewhere; here the earth grows and must grow only tombs. The\r\ncardinals have closed their ears to the calculations of the commercial\r\nadventurers hastening to demolish the ruins of Tusculum, which they\r\nmistake for the castles of aristocrats: they would have made lime with\r\nthe marble of the sarcophagus of Æmilius Paulus, even as they have\r\nmade water-shoots with the lead of the coffins of our ancestors. The\r\nSacred College clings to the past; besides, it has been proved, to\r\nthe great confusion of the economists, that the Roman Campagna paid\r\nthe owners five per cent, as pasture-land and that it would not yield\r\nmore than one and a half in corn. It is not through idleness, but\r\nthrough practical interest, that the cultivator of the plains gives the\r\npreference to _pastorizia_ over _maggesi._ The produce of an acre in\r\nthe Roman territory is almost equal to the produce of the same measure\r\nin the best French departments: to convince one's self of that, one has\r\nbut to read the work of Monsignore Nicolaï[668].\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI have told you that, at first, I had a sense of weariness, at the\r\ncommencement of my second journey to Rome, and that I ended by\r\nrecovering under the influence of the ruins and the sun. I was still\r\nunder my first impression when, on the 3rd of November 1828, I wrote to\r\nM. Villemain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter, monsieur, was very welcome in my Roman\r\n    solitude: it has stayed my home-sickness, from which I\r\n    was suffering badly. That complaint is nothing else than\r\n    my years, which deprive my eyes of the power of seeing as\r\n    they saw before: my own ruin is not great enough to find\r\n    consolation in that of Rome. When I now wander alone amid all\r\n    these remains of the centuries, they no longer serve me as\r\n    a scale by which to measure time: I go back into the past,\r\n    I see what I have lost and the end of the short future that\r\n    lies before me; I count all the joys which I might have left,\r\n    I find none of them; I make an effort to admire what I used\r\n    to admire, and I admire it no longer. I come home to undergo\r\n    my honours, overcome by the _sirocco_ and stabbed by the\r\n    _tramontane._ There you have all my life, save only a tomb\r\n    which I have not yet had the courage to visit. We pay great\r\n    attention to crumbling monuments: we keep them up; we rid\r\n    them of their plants and flowers; the women whom I had left\r\n    young have become old, and the ruins have become young again:\r\n    what would you have one do here?\r\n\r\n    \"Well, I assure you, monsieur, that I long only to return to\r\n    my Rue d'Enfer, never again to leave it. I have fulfilled\r\n    all my engagements towards my country and my friends. Once\r\n    you and M. Bertin de Vaux have entered the State Council, I\r\n    shall have nothing more to ask, for your talents will soon\r\n    carry you higher. My retirement has, I hope, done a little to\r\n    bring about the cessation of a formidable opposition; public\r\n    liberty has been won for France for ever. My sacrifice must\r\n    now end with my role in life. I ask nothing but to return to\r\n    my 'Infirmary.' I have nothing but praise for this country; I\r\n    have been admirably received, I have found a government full\r\n    of tolerance and very well informed of affairs outside Italy;\r\n    but, when all is said and done, nothing pleases me more than\r\n    the idea of disappearing entirely from the world's scene: it\r\n    is good to be preceded to the tomb by the silence which one\r\n    will find there.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for being so good as to speak to me of your\r\n    labours. You will write a work which will be worthy of you\r\n    and increase your reputation[669]. If you have any researches\r\n    to make here, have the kindness to tell me of them: a rummage\r\n    in the Vatican might furnish you with treasures. Alas, I saw\r\n    but too much of that poor M. Thierry[670]! I assure you that\r\n    I am haunted by his memory: so young, so full of love for his\r\n    work, and to go! And, as always happens with real merit, his\r\n    mind was improving and reason, with him, taking the place\r\n    of system: I still hope for a miracle. I have written on\r\n    his behalf; I have not even had an answer. I have been more\r\n    fortunate for you, and a letter from M. de Martignac gives me\r\n    to hope at last that justice, although tardy and incomplete,\r\n    will be done you. I no longer live, monsieur, except for my\r\n    friends; you must permit me to include yourself in the number\r\n    of those who are still left to me.\r\n\r\n    \"I remain, monsieur, with as much sincerity as admiration,\r\n\r\n    \"Your most devoted servant[671],\r\n\r\n    \"CHATEAUBRIAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustin Thierry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MADAME RÉCAMIER\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, _Saturday_, 8 _November_ 1832.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de La Ferronnays informs me of the surrender of\r\n    Varna[672], which I knew.

Our newspapers have been wretchedly Turcophile these\r\n    last times. How can they ever have been able to forget the\r\n    noble cause of Greece and to fall into admiration before the\r\n    barbarians who spread slavery and pestilence over the country\r\n    of great men and the fairest portion of Europe? That is what\r\n    we are, we French: a trifle of personal discontent makes us\r\n    forget our principles and the most generous sentiments. The\r\n    Turks, when beaten, will perhaps arouse some pity in me; the\r\n    Turks victorious would fill me with horror.\r\n\r\n    \"So my friend M. de La Ferronnays remains in power.

The hoppings on the ruins of\r\n    the Capitol, the uniform manners which 'great' society puts\r\n    on everywhere are very strange things: if even I had the\r\n    resource of escape into the deserts of Rome!\r\n\r\n    \"What is really deplorable here, what clashes with the nature\r\n    of the place is that multitude of insipid Englishwomen and\r\n    frivolous dandies who, holding each other linked by the arm,\r\n    as the bats do by the wing, parade their eccentricity, their\r\n    boredom and their insolence at your receptions, and make\r\n    themselves at home in your house as at an inn. This vagrant\r\n    and swaggering Great Britain makes for your seats at public\r\n    solemnities, and boxes with you to turn you out of them: all\r\n    day long it hastily swallows pictures and ruins and, in the\r\n    evening, it comes to swallow cakes and ices at your parties,\r\n    feeling that it confers a great honour upon you in doing so.\r\n    I do not know how an ambassador can endure those unmannerly\r\n    guests, nor why he does not show them his door.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: My Memorandum on the East.]\r\n\r\nI have spoken in the _Congrès de Vérone_ of the existence of my\r\nMemorandum on Eastern Affairs. When I sent it, in 1828, to M. le Comte\r\nde La Ferronnays, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the world was\r\nnot what it is: in France, the Legitimacy existed; in Russia, Poland\r\nhad not perished; Spain was still Bourbon; England had not yet the\r\nhonour of protecting us. Many things, therefore, have become old in\r\nthis Memorandum: to-day, my foreign policy would, in many respects,\r\nbe different; twelve years have altered diplomatic relations, but\r\nthe basis of the truths has remained the same. I have inserted\r\nthis Memorandum in its entirety in order once more to revenge the\r\nRestoration for the absurd reproaches which continue to be obstinately\r\naddressed to it, in spite of the evidence of facts. The Restoration,\r\nso soon as it had chosen its ministers from among its friends, never\r\nceased to occupy itself with the independence and honour of France:\r\nit protested against the Treaties of Vienna; it demanded protective\r\nfrontiers, not for the vain-glory of pushing itself to the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, but to ensure its safety; it laughed when they talked to it\r\nof the equilibrium of Europe, an equilibrium so unjustly broken where\r\nit was concerned: that was why it first wished to cover itself on the\r\nsouth, because it had pleased the others to disarm it on the north. At\r\nNavarino, it recovered a navy and the liberty of Greece; the Eastern\r\nQuestion did not take it unawares.\r\n\r\nI have kept three opinions on the East from the time at which I wrote\r\nthat Memorandum:\r\n\r\nFirst, if Turkey in Europe is to be broken up, we must have a share\r\nin that distribution in the shape of an increase of territory on our\r\nfrontiers and the ownership of some military point in the Archipelago.\r\nTo compare the partition of Turkey with the partition of Poland is an\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to regard Turkey, as it was during the reign of Francis I.,\r\nas a useful power to our policy, is to do away with three centuries of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to pretend to civilize Turkey by giving her steamboats and\r\nrailways, by disciplining her armies, by teaching her to work her\r\nfleets, is not to extend civilization to the East, but to introduce\r\nbarbarism into the West. Ibrahims to come would be able to carry back\r\nthe future to the time of Charles the Hammer or to the time of the\r\nSiege of Vienna, when Europe was saved by that heroic Poland on whom\r\nweighs the ingratitude of kings.\r\n\r\nI must remark that I was the only one, with Benjamin Constant, to point\r\nout the improvidence of the Christian governments: a people whose\r\nsocial order is based upon slavery and polygamy is a people that must\r\nbe sent back to the steppes of the Mongols.\r\n\r\nIn the last result, Turkey in Europe, become a vassal of Russia by\r\nvirtue of the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi[674], no longer exists:\r\nif the question is to be decided at once, which I doubt, it would\r\nperhaps be better that an independent empire should have its seat\r\nin Constantinople and form Greece into a whole. Is that possible? I\r\ndo not know. As for Mehemet Ali[675], the relentless tax-gatherer\r\nand custom-house officer, Egypt, in so far as French interests are\r\nconcerned, is better guarded by him than she would be by the English.\r\n\r\nBut here am I exerting myself to demonstrate the honour of the\r\nRestoration: why, who troubles himself about what it has done, who,\r\nabove all, will trouble himself about it some years hence? It would be\r\nas well worth my while to become excited over the interests of Tyre and\r\nEcbatana: that past world is gone, never to return. After Alexander,\r\nthe Roman power commenced; after Cæsar, Christianity changed the world;\r\nafter Charlemagne, the feudal night gave birth to a new society; after\r\nNapoleon, nothing: we see no empire come, nor religion, nor barbarians.\r\nCivilization has risen to its highest level, but it is a material\r\ncivilization, an unfruitful civilization, which can produce nothing,\r\nsince life can be given only by moral means; we can arrive at the\r\ncreation of peoples only by the roads of Heaven: railways will lead us\r\nonly more swiftly to the abyss.\r\n\r\nYou now have the prolegomena which seemed to me necessary for the\r\nunderstanding of the Memorandum which follows, and which is also to be\r\nfound at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To M. de La Ferronnays.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    LETTER TO M. LE COMTE DE LA FERRONAYS\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, 30 _November_ 1828.\r\n\r\n    \"In your private letter of the 10th of November, my noble\r\n    friend, you said:\r\n\r\n    \"'I send you a brief summary of our political situation,\r\n    and you will be kind enough to let me, in return, have your\r\n    ideas, which are always so useful to know in matters of this\r\n    sort.'\r\n\r\n    \"Your friendship, noble count, judges me too indulgently; I\r\n    do not in the least believe that I shall be enlightening you\r\n    by sending you the Memorandum annexed: I merely obey you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n\r\n    PART I.\r\n\r\n    \"At the distance at which I am placed from the theatre of\r\n    events, and in my almost total ignorance of the state of\r\n    negociations, I can scarcely reason fitly. Nevertheless, as I\r\n    have long had a definite system touching the foreign policy\r\n    of France, as I was, so to speak, the first to call for the\r\n    emancipation of Greece, I readily, noble count, submit my\r\n    ideas to your judgment.\r\n\r\n    \"There was as yet no question of the Treaty of the 6th of\r\n    July[676], when I published my Note on Greece[677]. That\r\n    Note contained the germ of the treaty: I proposed to the\r\n    five Great Powers of Europe to address a collective dispatch\r\n    to the Divan imperatively to demand the cessation of all\r\n    hostility between the Porte and the Hellenes. In case of\r\n    refusal, the five Powers were to declare that they recognised\r\n    the independence of the Greek Government and that they would\r\n    receive the representatives of that Government.\r\n\r\n    \"This Note was read by the several Cabinets. The position\r\n    which I had occupied as Minister for Foreign Affairs lent\r\n    some importance to my opinion: what is singular is that\r\n    Prince Metternich showed himself less opposed to my Note than\r\n    Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\n    \"The latter, with whom I had had fairly intimate relations,\r\n    was an orator rather than a great politician, a man of\r\n    talent rather than a statesman. He entertained a certain\r\n    jealousy of success in general, and especially of that of\r\n    France. When the Parliamentary Opposition either wounded\r\n    or exalted his self-esteem, he flung himself into false\r\n    measures, he launched out into sarcasm or boasting. It was\r\n    thus that, after the Spanish War, he rejected the demand for\r\n    intervention, which I had extracted with so much difficulty\r\n    from the Cabinet of Madrid, for the settlement of affairs\r\n    across the Atlantic: the secret reason was that he had\r\n    not himself made that demand, and he refused to see that,\r\n    even according to his system (always presuming that he had\r\n    one), England, represented in a general congress, would in\r\n    no way be bound by the acts of that congress, and would\r\n    always remain free to act separately. It was thus again that\r\n    Mr. Canning moved troops into Portugal, not to defend a\r\n    Charter at which he was the first to laugh, but because the\r\n    Opposition reproached him with the presence of our soldiers\r\n    in Spain and he wanted to be able to say that the British\r\n    Army was occupying Lisbon as the French Army occupied Cadiz.\r\n    Lastly, it was thus that he signed the Treaty of the 6th of\r\n    July against his private opinion, against the opinion of his\r\n    country, which was unfavourable to the cause of the Greeks.\r\n    If he agreed to that treaty, it was solely because he was\r\n    afraid of seeing us take the initiative in the question with\r\n    Russia and gain the glory of a generous resolution alone.\r\n    That minister, who, after all, will leave a great reputation,\r\n    also thought that he was hindering Russia's movements by this\r\n    very treaty; nevertheless, it was clear that the text of the\r\n    instrument in no way tied down the Emperor Nicholas and in no\r\n    way obliged him to waive a war of his own with Turkey.\r\n\r\n    \"The Treaty of the 6th of July is a crude document\r\n    hurriedly drafted, devoid of all foresight and teeming with\r\n    contradictory provisions.\r\n\r\n    \"In my Note on Greece, I presupposed the adhesion of the five\r\n    Great Powers; as Austria and Prussia have kept aloof, their\r\n    neutrality leaves them free, according to events, to declare\r\n    for or against either of the belligerent parties.\r\n\r\n    \"There is no longer any question of going back to the past,\r\n    we must take things as they are. All that the governments\r\n    are obliged to do is to make the most of the facts when they\r\n    are accomplished. Let us therefore examine those facts.\r\n\r\n    \"We are occupying the Morea[678], the towns on that peninsula\r\n    have fallen into our hands. So much for what concerns\r\n    ourselves.\r\n\r\n    \"Varna is taken, Varna becomes an outpost at seventy hours'\r\n    march from Constantinople. The Dardanelles are blockaded;\r\n    the Russians will, in the course of the winter, seize\r\n    Silistria[679] and some other fortresses; numbers of recruits\r\n    will arrive. In the early days of spring, all will move for\r\n    a decisive campaign; in Asia, General Paskevitch[680] has\r\n    invaded three pashalics, he commands the sources of the\r\n    Euphrates and threatens the road to Erzeroum. So much for\r\n    what concerns Russia.\r\n\r\n    \"Would the Emperor Nicholas have done better to undertake a\r\n    winter campaign in Europe? I think so, if it were possible.\r\n    By marching on Constantinople, he would have cut the Gordian\r\n    knot and put an end to all diplomatic intrigue; people\r\n    embrace the side of success; the way to secure allies is to\r\n    be victorious.\r\n\r\n    \"As for Turkey, it has been made clear to me that she would\r\n    have declared war on us if Russia had failed before Varna.\r\n    Will she have the good sense to-day to open up negociations\r\n    with England and France, if only to rid herself of both?\r\n    Austria would gladly advise her to adopt that course; but\r\n    it is difficult to foresee the conduct of a race of men who\r\n    have not European ideas. At the same time cunning as slaves\r\n    and haughty as tyrants, with them anger is never tempered\r\n    by anything save fear. Sultan Mahmud II.[681] appears, in\r\n    some respects, to be a superior prince to the last sultans;\r\n    he has, above all, political courage; but has he personal\r\n    courage? He is content to hold reviews in the suburbs of his\r\n    capital, and he lets himself be entreated by the magnates not\r\n    to go even so far as Adrianople. The mob of Constantinople\r\n    would be better held in check by triumphs than by the\r\n    presence of its master.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us, however, admit that the Divan consents to a\r\n    parley on the basis of the Treaty of the 6th of July. The\r\n    negociation would be a very intricate one; even if one had\r\n    only to fix the limits of Greece, there would be no end to\r\n    it. Where shall those limits be placed on the Continent? How\r\n    many islands shall be restored to liberty? Shall Samos, which\r\n    has so gallantly defended its independence, be abandoned? Let\r\n    us look further, suppose the conference to be established:\r\n    will it paralyze the armies of the Emperor Nicholas? While\r\n    the plenipotentiaries of the Turks and of the three Allied\r\n    Powers are treating in the Archipelago, every step of the\r\n    invading forces in Bulgaria will change the state of the\r\n    question. If the Russians were repulsed, the Turks would\r\n    break up the conference; if the Russians arrived at the gates\r\n    of Constantinople, there would be a fine question of the\r\n    independence of the Morea! The Hellenes would need neither\r\n    protectors nor negociators.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, to persuade the Divan to apply itself to the\r\n    Treaty of the 6th of July is to postpone the difficulty, not\r\n    to solve it. The coincidence of the emancipation of Greece\r\n    and the signing of peace between the Turks and Russians is,\r\n    in my opinion, necessary to extricate the Cabinets of Europe\r\n    from their present embarrassment.\r\n\r\n    \"What conditions will the Emperor Nicholas lay down for peace?\r\n\r\n    \"In his manifesto, he declares that he waives conquests, but\r\n    he speaks of indemnities for the cost of the war: that is\r\n    vague and may lead to much.\r\n\r\n    \"Will the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, pretending to regularize\r\n    the Treaties of Akerman[682] and Jassy[683] demand (1) the\r\n    complete independence of the two principalities; (2) liberty\r\n    of commerce in the Black Sea, not only for Russia, but the\r\n    other nations; (3) the repayment of the sums expended in this\r\n    last campaign?\r\n\r\n    \"Innumerable difficulties present themselves against the\r\n    conclusion of a peace on these bases.\r\n\r\n    \"If Russia desires to give the principalities sovereigns of\r\n    her choosing, Austria will look upon Moldavia and Wallachia\r\n    as two Russian provinces and will oppose this political\r\n    transaction.\r\n\r\n    \"Will Moldavia and Wallachia fall under the sway of a prince\r\n    who shall be independent of any Great Power, or of a prince\r\n    installed under the protectorate of several sovereigns?\r\n\r\n    \"In that case, Nicholas would prefer the hospodars appointed\r\n    by Mahmud, for the principalities, continuing to be Turkish,\r\n    would remain vulnerable to the Russian armies.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: On Eastern affairs: part I.]\r\n\r\n    \"Liberty of commerce in the Black Sea, the opening of that\r\n    sea to all the fleets of Europe and America would shake the\r\n    power of the Porte to its foundations. To grant the right of\r\n    passage of warships under Constantinople is, with reference\r\n    to the geography of the Ottoman Empire, as though one were to\r\n    recognise the right of foreign armies to cross France at all\r\n    times along the walls of Paris.\r\n\r\n    \"Lastly, where would Turkey find the money to pay the costs\r\n    of the campaign? The so-called treasure of the Sultans is\r\n    an antiquated fable. The provinces conquered beyond the\r\n    Caucasus might, it is true, be ceded as security for the sum\r\n    demanded: of the two Russian armies, one, in Europe, appears\r\n    to me to be entrusted with the interests of Nicholas' honour;\r\n    the other, in Asia, with his pecuniary interests. But, if\r\n    Nicholas did not consider himself bound by the declarations\r\n    of his manifesto, would England with an indifferent eye see\r\n    the Muscovite soldier advancing along the road to India? Was\r\n    she not alarmed already in 1827, when he took one more step\r\n    forward in the Persian Empire?\r\n\r\n    \"If the double difficulty arising from the carrying into\r\n    effect of the treaty and from the pertinence of the\r\n    conditions of a peace between Turkey and Russia were\r\n    to render useless the efforts made to overcome so many\r\n    obstacles; if a second campaign were to open in the spring,\r\n    would the powers of Europe take sides in the quarrel? What\r\n    part ought France to play? This is what I propose to examine\r\n    in the second part of this Note.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    PART II.\r\n\r\n    \"Austria and England have interests in common, they are\r\n    naturally allied through their foreign policy, whatever\r\n    otherwise may be the different forms of their governments and\r\n    the opposite maxims that regulate their home policy. Both\r\n    are hostile to and jealous of Russia, both desire to check\r\n    the progress of that Power; they will perhaps unite in an\r\n    extreme case, but they feel that, if Russia does not allow\r\n    herself to be overawed, she can defy that union, which is\r\n    more formidable in appearance than in reality.\r\n\r\n    \"Austria has nothing to ask from England; the latter, on\r\n    her side, is of no use to Austria except to supply her with\r\n    money. Now, England, crushed under the weight of her debt,\r\n    has no money left to lend to anybody. Austria, if abandoned\r\n    to her own resources, would not, in the present state of her\r\n    finances, be able to set large armies in motion, especially\r\n    as she is obliged to watch over Italy and to stand on her\r\n    guard on the frontiers of Poland and Prussia. The present\r\n    position of the Russian troops would permit them to enter\r\n    Vienna earlier than Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    \"What can the English do against Russia? Close the Baltic,\r\n    cease buying hemp and timber in the markets of the North,\r\n    destroy Admiral van Heiden's[684] fleet in the Mediterranean,\r\n    throw a few engineers and a few soldiers into Constantinople,\r\n    stock that capital with food-stuffs and munitions of war,\r\n    penetrate into the Black Sea, blockade the ports of the\r\n    Crimea, deprive the Russian troops in the field of the\r\n    assistance of their commercial and naval fleets?\r\n\r\n    \"Suppose all this to be accomplished (which, to begin with,\r\n    could not be done without considerable expenditure, for\r\n    which there would be neither compensation nor guarantee),\r\n    Nicholas would still have his huge land force. An attack on\r\n    the part of Austria and England against the Cross on behalf\r\n    of the Crescent would increase the popularity in Russia of\r\n    what is already a national and religious war. Wars of this\r\n    nature are waged without money, it is they which, by force\r\n    of public opinion, hurl nations one upon the other. If the\r\n    popes begin to evangelize in St. Petersburg, as the ulemas\r\n    are mohammedanizing in Constantinople, they will find more\r\n    soldiers than they want; they would stand a greater chance of\r\n    success than their adversaries in this appeal to the passions\r\n    and beliefs of men. Invasions which descend from north to\r\n    south are much more rapid and much more irresistible than\r\n    those which climb from south to north: the propensity of the\r\n    populations inclines them to flow towards beautiful climates.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Memorandum.]\r\n\r\n    \"Would Prussia remain an indifferent spectatress of this\r\n    great struggle, if Austria and England declared for Turkey?\r\n    There is no reason to think so.\r\n\r\n    \"There exists, no doubt, in the Cabinet of Berlin a party\r\n    which hates and fears the Cabinet of St. Petersburg; but this\r\n    party, which, moreover, is beginning to grow old, finds an\r\n    obstacle in the anti-Austrian party, and especially in the\r\n    domestic affections.\r\n\r\n    \"Family ties, generally weak among sovereigns, are very\r\n    strong in the Prussian Family: King Frederic William III.\r\n    fondly loves his daughter, the present Empress of Russia,\r\n    and he likes to think that his grandson[685] will ascend\r\n    the throne of Peter the Great[686]; Princes Frederic,\r\n    William, Charles, Henry Albert are also greatly attached\r\n    to their sister Alexandra; the Hereditary Prince Royal saw\r\n    no objection recently to declaring in Rome that he was a\r\n    'Turk-eater.'\r\n\r\n    \"By thus analyzing the interests, we perceive that France\r\n    is in an admirable political position: she can become the\r\n    arbitress of that great contest; she can, at her pleasure,\r\n    maintain neutrality, or declare for a side, according to\r\n    the time and circumstances. If she were ever obliged to go\r\n    to that extremity, if her counsels were not heard, if the\r\n    nobility and moderation of her conduct did not secure for her\r\n    the peace which she desires for herself and for others, then,\r\n    in the necessity in which she would find herself of taking\r\n    up arms, all her interests would incline her to the side of\r\n    Russia.\r\n\r\n    \"If an alliance were formed between Austria and England\r\n    against Russia, what benefit would France derive from her\r\n    adhesion to that alliance?\r\n\r\n    \"Would England lend ships to France?\r\n\r\n    \"France is still, next to England, the first naval power in\r\n    Europe; she has more ships than she requires to destroy, if\r\n    necessary, the naval forces of Russia.\r\n\r\n    \"Would England furnish us with subsidies?\r\n\r\n    \"England has no money; France has more than she, and\r\n    the French have no need to be in the pay of the British\r\n    Parliament.\r\n\r\n    \"Would England assist us with soldiers and arms?\r\n\r\n    \"France is in no lack of arms, still less of soldiers.\r\n\r\n    \"Would England assure us an increase of insular or\r\n    continental territory?\r\n\r\n    \"Where shall we secure that increase, if we make war on\r\n    Russia on behalf of the Grand Turk? Shall we attempt descents\r\n    on the coasts of the Baltic, the Black Sea and Behring's\r\n    Straits? Could we have any other hope? Should we expect to\r\n    attach England to ourselves so that she should hasten to our\r\n    assistance if ever our internal affairs came to be embroiled?\r\n\r\n    \"Heaven protect us against any such prevision and against\r\n    foreign intervention in our domestic affairs! England,\r\n    besides, has always held kings and the liberty of nations\r\n    cheap; she is always ready remorselessly to sacrifice\r\n    monarchy or republic to her own interests. Only lately she\r\n    proclaimed the independence of the Spanish Colonies at the\r\n    same time that she refused to recognise that of Greece; she\r\n    sent her fleets to support the Mexican insurgents and caused\r\n    a few paltry steamboats destined for the Hellenes to be\r\n    seized in the Thames; she admitted the legality of the rights\r\n    of Mahmud and denied that of the rights of Ferdinand; she\r\n    is devoted by turns to despotism or democracy according to\r\n    the wind which brings the ships of the City merchants to her\r\n    ports.\r\n\r\n    \"Lastly, if we associated ourselves with the warlike projects\r\n    of England and Austria against Russia, where should we go\r\n    in search of our old adversary of Austerlitz? He is not\r\n    on our frontiers. Should we then send out at our cost a\r\n    hundred thousand men, fully equipped, to succour Vienna or\r\n    Constantinople? Should we have an army at Athens to protect\r\n    the Greeks against the Turks, and an army at Adrianople\r\n    to protect the Turks against the Russians? Should we fire\r\n    grape-shot on the Osmanlis in the Morea and embrace them on\r\n    the Dardanelles? Nothing that lacks common-sense in human\r\n    affairs succeeds.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: On Eastern affairs: Part II.]\r\n\r\n    \"Let us admit, nevertheless, that, against all likelihood,\r\n    our efforts were crowned with complete success in this\r\n    unnatural Triple Alliance, let us suppose that Prussia\r\n    remained neutral during all this strife, as well as the\r\n    Netherlands, and that, free to move our forces abroad, we\r\n    were not obliged to fight within sixty leagues of Paris:\r\n    well, what advantage should we derive from our crusade for\r\n    the deliverance of the tomb of Mahomet? Knights of the\r\n    Turks, we should return from the Levant with a fur-lined\r\n    coat-of-honour; we should have the glory of having thrown\r\n    away a thousand million francs and two hundred thousand men\r\n    to calm the terrors of Austria, to satisfy the jealousies\r\n    of England, to keep up in the fairest portion of the world\r\n    the plague and barbarism attached to the Ottoman Empire.\r\n    Austria would perhaps have enlarged her States on the\r\n    side of Wallachia and Moldavia, and England would perhaps\r\n    have obtained some commercial privileges from the Porte,\r\n    privileges of little interest to us if we shared in them,\r\n    as we have neither so large a number of merchant ships as\r\n    the English, nor so many manufactured goods to spread in\r\n    the Levant. We should be completely duped by this Triple\r\n    Alliance, which might fail in its object and which, if it\r\n    achieved it, would achieve it only at our expense.\r\n\r\n    \"But, if England has no direct means of being of use to us,\r\n    could she not at least act upon the Cabinet of Vienna and\r\n    engage Austrians a compensation for the sacrifices we should\r\n    make for her, to allow us to recover our old departments on\r\n    the left bank of the Rhine?\r\n\r\n    \"No: Austria and England will always oppose any such\r\n    concession; Russia alone can make it to us, as we shall see\r\n    hereafter. Austria detests and fears us, even more than she\r\n    hates and dreads Russia; as a choice of evils, she would\r\n    prefer to see the latter Power expand on the side of Bulgaria\r\n    rather than France on the side of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n    \"But would the independence of Europe be threatened if the\r\n    Tsars made Constantinople the capital of their Empire?\r\n\r\n    \"It is necessary to explain what is understood by the\r\n    independence of Europe: do we mean to say that, all\r\n    equilibrium being shattered, Russia, after making the\r\n    conquest of Turkey in Europe, would seize Austria, subjugate\r\n    Germany and Prussia, and end by subjecting France?\r\n\r\n    \"First, any empire which expands without measure loses some\r\n    of its strength; it almost always becomes divided; soon we\r\n    should see two or three Russias hostile one to the other.\r\n\r\n    \"Next, does the equilibrium of Europe exist for France since\r\n    the last treaties?\r\n\r\n    \"England has retained almost all the conquests which she has\r\n    made in the colonies of three quarters of the globe during\r\n    the War of the Revolution; in Europe she has gained Malta and\r\n    the Ionian Islands; even her Electorate of Hanover she has\r\n    inflated into a kingdom and enlarged by a few baronies.\r\n\r\n    \"Austria has increased her possessions by a third of Poland,\r\n    some parings of Bavaria and a part of Dalmatia and Italy.\r\n    She no longer, it is true, has the Low Countries; but that\r\n    province has not devolved upon France, and it has become\r\n    a formidable auxiliary of England and Prussia as against\r\n    ourselves.\r\n\r\n    \"Prussia has enlarged herself by the Duchy or Palatinate of\r\n    Posen, a fragment of Saxony and the chief circles of the\r\n    Rhine; her advance-post is on our own territory, at ten days'\r\n    march from our capital.\r\n\r\n    \"Russia has recovered Finland and settled down on the banks\r\n    of the Vistula.\r\n\r\n    \"And what have we gained in all these partitions? We have\r\n    been despoiled of our colonies; not even our old soil has\r\n    been respected: Landau detached from France, Hüningen\r\n    demolished leave a breach of more than fifty leagues in our\r\n    frontiers; the little State of Sardinia has not blushed to\r\n    clothe herself in a few shreds stolen from the Empire of\r\n    Napoleon and the Kingdom of Louis the Great.\r\n\r\n    \"In this position, what interest have we to safeguard Austria\r\n    and England against the victories of Russia? If the latter\r\n    were to extend towards the East and alarm the Cabinet of\r\n    Vienna, should we be in any danger? Have we received so much\r\n    consideration that we should be so sensible to the anxieties\r\n    of our enemies? England and Austria have always been and will\r\n    always be France's natural adversaries; we should see them\r\n    cheerfully join forces with Russia to-morrow, if it were a\r\n    question of fighting us and plundering us.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us not forget that, while we should be taking up arms\r\n    for the so-called safety of Europe, imperilled by the\r\n    supposed ambition of Nicholas, it would probably happen that\r\n    Austria, less chivalrous and more rapacious than we, would\r\n    listen to the proposals of the Cabinet of St. Petersburg; an\r\n    abrupt and sudden change of policy costs her little. With the\r\n    consent of Russia, she would seize Bosnia and Servia, leaving\r\n    to us the satisfaction of exerting ourselves for Mahmud.\r\n\r\n    \"France is already in a state of semi-hostility with the\r\n    Turks; she alone has already spent many millions and\r\n    endangered twenty thousand soldiers in the cause of Greece.\r\n    England would lose only a few words by betraying the\r\n    principles of the Treaty of the 6th of July; France would\r\n    lose honour, men and money.

That the former should\r\n    fear to see Russia seize upon the trade of the Levant and\r\n    become a naval Power matters little to us. Is it, then, so\r\n    necessary that Great Britain should remain in possession of\r\n    the monopoly of the seas, that we should spill French blood\r\n    to preserve the sceptre of the ocean for the destroyer of\r\n    our colonies, our fleets and our commerce? Is the Legitimate\r\n    Dynasty to move armies in order to protect the House which\r\n    coalesces with the illegitimacy and which is, perhaps,\r\n    reserving for times of discord the means which it believes\r\n    itself to possess to disturb France? A fine equilibrium for\r\n    us is that of Europe, when all the Powers, as I have already\r\n    shown, have increased their own bulk and, with one accord,\r\n    diminished the weight of France! Let them return within their\r\n    old boundaries, as we have done; then we shall fly to the aid\r\n    of their independence, if that independence be threatened.\r\n    They made no scruples to join hands with Russia, in order to\r\n    dismember us and incorporate the fruit of our victories; let\r\n    them then suffer us to-day to draw closer the bonds formed\r\n    between us and that same Russia, in order to recover suitable\r\n    boundaries and restore the real balance of Europe!\r\n\r\n    \"Besides, if the Emperor Nicholas were desirous and able to\r\n    go to sign a peace in Constantinople, would the destruction\r\n    of the Ottoman Empire be the strict consequence of that fact?\r\n    Peace has been signed under arms in Vienna, in Berlin, in\r\n    Paris; almost all the capitals of Europe have been taken in\r\n    these latter days: have Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Spain\r\n    perished? Twice have the Cossacks and the Pandoors come to\r\n    camp in the court-yard of the Louvre; the Kingdom of Henry\r\n    IV. has been under military occupation during three years;\r\n    and yet we should be quite touched to see the Cossacks in\r\n    possession of the Seraglio, and we should show for the\r\n    honour of barbarism the susceptibility which we did not\r\n    display for the honour of civilization and for our own\r\n    country! Let the pride of the Porte be humbled, and then\r\n    perhaps it will be obliged to recognise some of the rights of\r\n    humanity which it outrages!\r\n\r\n    \"I have now made evident whither I am tending and the\r\n    consequence which I am preparing to deduce from all the\r\n    foregoing.

In time of peace, let the\r\n    Cabinet of the Tuileries remain allied with the Cabinet of\r\n    St. Petersburg, and nothing can stir in Europe. In time of\r\n    war, the union of the two Cabinets will dictate laws to the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n    \"I have shown sufficiently that the alliance of France with\r\n    England and Austria against Russia is a dupe's alliance,\r\n    in which we should find only loss of blood and treasure.\r\n    The Russian Alliance, on the contrary, would enable us to\r\n    obtain establishments in the Archipelago and to push back our\r\n    frontier to the banks of the Rhine. We can hold this language\r\n    to Nicholas:\r\n\r\n    \"'Your enemies are making overtures to us; we prefer peace to\r\n    war, we prefer to preserve neutrality.

Those of the Powers which are not so situated as to\r\n    be able to enlarge their territory towards the East will\r\n    receive compensation elsewhere.

To begin with, there are means\r\n    of paralyzing Prussia, of even persuading her to join us and\r\n    Russia; should that happen, the Netherlands could not declare\r\n    themselves hostile.

On the principle\r\n    of the higher civilization, the human race can only gain\r\n    by the destruction of the Ottoman Empire: it is a thousand\r\n    times better for the nations that the Cross should hold\r\n    sway in Constantinople than the Crescent. All the elements\r\n    of morality and of political society are at the root of\r\n    Christianity, all the germs of social destruction are in\r\n    the religion of Mahomet. They say that the present Sultan\r\n    has taken steps towards civilization: is this because he\r\n    has tried, with the assistance of a few French renegades,\r\n    of a few English and Austrian officers, to submit his\r\n    irregular hordes to regular exercises? And since when has the\r\n    mechanical apprenticeship of arms constituted civilization?\r\n    It is an enormous mistake, it is almost a crime, to have\r\n    initiated the Turks into the science of our tactics; we must\r\n    baptize the soldiers whom we discipline, unless we wish\r\n    purposely to educate destroyers of society.\r\n\r\n    \"The want of foresight is great: Austria, which applauds\r\n    herself for organizing the Ottoman Armies, would be the\r\n    first to bear the penalty of her joy; if the Turks beat the\r\n    Russians they would be all the more capable of measuring\r\n    their strength with the Imperials their neighbours. This\r\n    time, Vienna would not escape the Grand Vizier. Would the\r\n    rest of Europe, which thinks it has nothing to fear from the\r\n    Porte, be in greater safety? Passionate and short-sighted\r\n    men want Turkey to be a regular military Power, to enter\r\n    into the common right of peace and war of civilized nations,\r\n    all in order to maintain some balance or other, of which\r\n    the mere word, void of sense, dispenses those men from\r\n    having any idea: what would be the consequences were those\r\n    wishes realized? Whenever it pleased the Sultan, under any\r\n    pretext, to attack a Christian government, a well-manœuvred\r\n    Constantinopolitan fleet, augmented by the fleet of the Pasha\r\n    of Egypt and the naval contingent of the Barbary Powers,\r\n    would declare the coasts of Spain or Italy in a state of\r\n    blockade and land fifty thousand men at Carthagena or Naples.\r\n    You do not wish to plant the Cross on St. Sophia: continue to\r\n    discipline the hordes of Turks, Albanians, Negroes and Arabs,\r\n    and, in less than twenty years, perhaps, the Crescent will\r\n    gleam on the dome of St. Peter's. Will you then summon Europe\r\n    to a crusade against infidels armed with the plague, slavery\r\n    and the Koran? It will be too late.\r\n\r\n    \"The general interests of society would therefore benefit by\r\n    the success of the arms of the Emperor Nicholas.\r\n\r\n    \"As to France's own interests, I have proved sufficiently\r\n    that these lie in an alliance with Russia, and that they may\r\n    be singularly favoured by the very war which that Power is\r\n    to-day waging in the East.\"\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n    \"To sum up:\r\n\r\n    \"1. If Turkey were to consent to treat on the basis of the\r\n    treaty of the 6th of July, nothing would yet be decided,\r\n    since peace has not been made between Turkey and Russia; the\r\n    chances of the war in the Balkan Passes would at every moment\r\n    change the _data_ and the position of the plenipotentiaries\r\n    occupied with the emancipation of Greece.\r\n\r\n    \"2. The probable conditions of peace between the Emperor\r\n    Nicholas and Sultan Mahmud are open to the greatest\r\n    objections.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Russia can defy the union of England and Austria, a union\r\n    more formidable in appearance than in reality.\r\n\r\n    \"4. It is probable that Prussia would join hands with the\r\n    Emperor Nicholas, the son-in-law of Frederic William III.,\r\n    rather than with the Emperor's enemies.\r\n\r\n    \"5. France would have everything to lose and nothing to gain\r\n    by allying herself with England and Austria against Russia.\r\n\r\n    \"6. The independence of Europe would not be at all threatened\r\n    by Russia's conquests in the East. It is tolerably absurd,\r\n    it is to ignore every obstacle, to imagine the Russians\r\n    hastening from the Bosphorus to lay their yoke upon Germany\r\n    and France: every empire weakens itself by extension. As\r\n    to the balance of power, this has long been shattered for\r\n    France; she has lost her colonies, she has shrunk back within\r\n    her old boundaries, while England, Prussia, Russia and\r\n    Austria have prodigiously enlarged theirs.\r\n\r\n    \"7. If France were obliged to emerge from her neutrality, to\r\n    take up arms for one side or the other, the general interests\r\n    of civilization, as well as the particular interests of our\r\n    country, must make us enter by preference into the Russian\r\n    Alliance. By this means we could obtain the course of the\r\n    Rhine as our frontier, and colonies in the Archipelago,\r\n    advantages which the Cabinets of St. James and Vienna will\r\n    never grant us.\r\n\r\n    \"That is the summary of this Note. I have been able to\r\n    reason only hypothetically; I do not know what England,\r\n    Austria and Russia are proposing, or have proposed, at the\r\n    moment of writing; there may be a piece of information or a\r\n    dispatch which reduces the truths here set forth to useless\r\n    generalities: that is the drawback of distances and of\r\n    conjectural politics. Nevertheless, it remains certain that\r\n    France holds a strong position and that the Government is\r\n    so placed as to be able to make the very utmost of events,\r\n    if it thoroughly realizes what it requires, if it allows no\r\n    one to intimidate it, if to firmness of language it adds\r\n    vigour in action. We have a revered King, an Heir to the\r\n    Throne who, with three hundred thousand men, would increase,\r\n    on the banks of the Rhine, the glory which he has reaped in\r\n    Spain; our Morean Expedition is making us play a part filled\r\n    with honour; our political institutions are excellent; our\r\n    finances are in a state of prosperity unequalled in Europe:\r\n    with that one can walk with one's head raised. What a fine\r\n    country is that which possesses genius, courage, men and\r\n    money!\r\n\r\n    \"For the rest, I do not pretend to have said everything, to\r\n    have foreseen everything; I have not the presumption to put\r\n    forward my system as the best; I know that there is something\r\n    mysterious, something indiscernible, in human affairs. If\r\n    it be true that one can fairly well prophesy the last and\r\n    general results of a revolution, it is no less true that\r\n    one deceives one's self as to the details, that particular\r\n    events are often modified in an unexpected manner and that,\r\n    while seeing the end, one reaches it by roads whose very\r\n    existence one did not suspect. It is certain, for instance,\r\n    that the Turks will be driven from Europe; but when and how?\r\n    Will the war now waging deliver the civilized world from\r\n    that scourge? Are the obstacles to peace to which I have\r\n    pointed insurmountable? Yes, if we confine ourselves to\r\n    analogous arguments; no, if we bring into our calculations\r\n    circumstances foreign to those which have occasioned the\r\n    resort to arms.\r\n\r\n    \"Scarcely anything to-day resembles what it has been; outside\r\n    religion and morality, the majority of truths have altered,\r\n    if not in their essence, at least in their relations to men\r\n    and things. D'Ossat[687] survives as an able negociator;\r\n    Grotius[688] as a publicist of genius; Pufendorf[689] as a\r\n    judicious mind; but we could not apply the rules of their\r\n    diplomacy to our times, nor go back, in political law,\r\n    to the Treaty of Westphalia[690]. Nowadays, the peoples\r\n    take a part in their affairs, conducted formerly by the\r\n    governments alone. Those peoples no longer feel things as\r\n    they used to feel them; they are no longer affected by\r\n    the same events; they no longer see objects from the same\r\n    point of view; reason has made progress with them at the\r\n    cost of imagination; facts carry the day over exaltation\r\n    and passionate determinations; a certain reason prevails on\r\n    every hand. On most of the thrones and in the majority of\r\n    the Cabinets of Europe are seated men weary of revolutions,\r\n    surfeited with war and opposed to any spirit of adventure;\r\n    those are causes of hope for peaceful arrangements. Also it\r\n    is possible that nations may have internal troubles which\r\n    would dispose them towards conciliatory measures.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Conclusions.]\r\n\r\n    \"The death of the Dowager Empress of Russia[691] may develop\r\n    seeds of disturbance which were not wholly stifled. This\r\n    Princess took little part in foreign politics, but she was a\r\n    link between her sons; she is supposed to have exercised a\r\n    great influence over the transactions which gave the crown to\r\n    the Emperor Nicholas[692]. Nevertheless, it must be confessed\r\n    that, if Nicholas began again to be afraid, this would be a\r\n    reason the more for him to push on his soldiers from their\r\n    native soil and to seek safety in victory.\r\n\r\n    \"England, independently of her debt, which hampers her\r\n    movements, is embarrassed with affairs in Ireland. Whether\r\n    Catholic Emancipation pass through Parliament or not, it will\r\n    be an immense event. King George's health is breaking down,\r\n    that of his immediate successor is no better; if the accident\r\n    foreseen were to happen soon, there would be a new parliament\r\n    summoned, perhaps a change of ministers, and capable men are\r\n    rare in England to-day; a long regency might perhaps come.\r\n    In this precarious and critical position, it is possible\r\n    that England sincerely desires peace and that she is afraid\r\n    to throw herself into the chances of a great war, in the\r\n    midst of which she might find herself surprised by internal\r\n    catastrophes.\r\n\r\n    \"Lastly, to come to ourselves, in spite of our genuine\r\n    and incontrovertible prosperity, although we could make a\r\n    glorious appearance on a field of battle, if called to it:\r\n    are we quite prepared to figure on one? Are our fortresses in\r\n    a state of repair? Have we the stores necessary for a large\r\n    army? Is that army even on a complete peace footing? If we\r\n    were suddenly aroused by a declaration of war from England,\r\n    Prussia and the Netherlands, could we make an effective\r\n    opposition against a third invasion? The Napoleonic wars have\r\n    divulged a fatal secret: that it is possible to reach Paris\r\n    in a few days after a successful engagement; that Paris does\r\n    not defend itself; that this same Paris is much too near the\r\n    frontier. The capital of France will not be safe until we\r\n    possess the left bank of the Rhine. We may therefore require\r\n    some time to prepare ourselves.\r\n\r\n    \"Add to all this that the vices and virtues of the\r\n    sovereigns, their moral strength and weakness, their\r\n    character, their passions, their very habits are causes\r\n    of acts and of facts which defy calculation and which\r\n    enter into no political formula: the most petty influence\r\n    sometimes decides the greatest event in a sense opposed to\r\n    the likelihood of things; a slave can cause a peace to be\r\n    signed in Constantinople which all Europe, coalesced or on\r\n    its knees, would not obtain.\r\n\r\n    \"If, then, one of those reasons, placed outside the limits\r\n    of human foresight, should, in the course of this winter,\r\n    produce demands for negociations, ought they to be rejected,\r\n    if they did not agree with the principles of this Note? No,\r\n    doubtless: to gain time is a great thing, when one is not\r\n    ready. One can know what would be best and be content with\r\n    what is least bad; political truths, above all, are relative;\r\n    the absolute, in matters of State, has grave disadvantages.\r\n    It would be a good thing for the human race that the Turks\r\n    should be thrown into the Bosphorus; but we are not charged\r\n    with the expedition, and the hour of Mohammedanism has\r\n    perhaps not struck: hatred must be enlightened in order\r\n    not to commit follies. Nothing, therefore, should prevent\r\n    France from entering into negociations, while taking care to\r\n    reconcile them as far as possible with the spirit in which\r\n    this Note is drawn up. It is for the men at the helm of\r\n    empires to steer them according to the winds and avoid the\r\n    foul places.\r\n\r\n    \"Certainly, if the powerful Sovereign of the North consented\r\n    to reduce the terms of peace to the fulfilment of the\r\n    Treaty of Akerman and the emancipation of Greece, it would\r\n    be possible to make the Porte listen to reason; but what\r\n    likelihood is there that Russia will confine herself to\r\n    terms which she might have obtained without firing a gun?\r\n    How could she abandon claims so loudly and so publicly\r\n    expressed? One means alone, if there be one, would present\r\n    itself: to propose a general congress at which the Emperor\r\n    Nicholas would yield, or appear to yield, to the wishes of\r\n    Christian Europe. A means of success with men is to save\r\n    their self-esteem, to supply them with a reason to withdraw\r\n    their word and issue from a bad plight with honour.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: And reflections.]\r\n\r\n    \"The greatest obstacle to this plan of a congress would\r\n    come from the unexpected success of the Ottoman arms during\r\n    the winter. If, owing to the rigour of the season, the\r\n    want of provisions, the insufficiency of the troops, or\r\n    any other cause, the Russians were obliged to abandon the\r\n    Siege of Silistria, if Varna, which, however, is hardly\r\n    probable, were to fall again into the hands of the Turks,\r\n    the Emperor Nicholas would find himself in a position which\r\n    would no longer permit him to listen to any proposal, under\r\n    the penalty of descending to the lowest rank of monarchs:\r\n    then the war would continue and we should come back to the\r\n    eventualities inferred in this Note. If Russia lost her rank\r\n    as a military power, if Turkey replaced her in this quality,\r\n    Europe would only have changed one peril for another. Now,\r\n    the danger which would come upon us through the scimitar\r\n    of Mahmud would be of a much more formidable nature than\r\n    that with which we should be threatened by the sword of the\r\n    Emperor Nicholas. If fortune, by chance, seat a remarkable\r\n    prince upon the Throne of the Sultans, he cannot live long\r\n    enough to change the laws and manners, even if he had the\r\n    intention to do so. Mahmud will die: to whom will he leave\r\n    the Empire, with its disciplined, fanatical soldiers, with\r\n    its ulemas holding in their hands, thanks to the initiation\r\n    of modern tactics, a new means of conquest for the Koran?\r\n\r\n    \"While Austria, at last terrified by those false\r\n    calculations, would be obliged to guard herself on\r\n    frontiers where the janissaries gave her nothing to fear,\r\n    a new military insurrection, a possible result of the\r\n    humiliation of the Emperor Nicholas, would perhaps break\r\n    out in St. Petersburg, spread from place to place, and set\r\n    fire to the north of Germany. That is what the men do not\r\n    perceive who, in politics, confine themselves to vulgar\r\n    terrors and commonplaces. Petty dispatches, petty intrigues\r\n    are the barriers which Austria designs to oppose to an\r\n    all--threatening movement. If France and England adopted a\r\n    course worthy of themselves, if they notified the Porte that,\r\n    in case the Sultan should close his ears to all proposals of\r\n    peace, he would find them on the battle-field in the spring,\r\n    that resolution would soon have put an end to the anxiety of\r\n    Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of this Memorandum, having transpired in the diplomatic\r\nworld, attracted to me a certain consideration which I did not decline,\r\nbut which I did not either aspire to. I do not too clearly see what\r\nthere was to surprise the \"practical\" men. My Spanish War was a very\r\n\"practical\" thing. The incessant work of the general revolution\r\noperating in the old society, while bringing about among ourselves\r\nthe fall of the Legitimacy, has upset calculations subordinate to the\r\npermanence of facts as they existed in 1828.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to convince yourselves of the enormous difference of merit\r\nand glory between a great writer and a great politician? My works as\r\na diplomatist have been hallowed by what is recognised as the supreme\r\nability, _success._ And, still, whosoever may at any time read this\r\nMemorandum will no doubt skip it close-legged, and I should do as much\r\nin the reader's place[693]. Well, suppose that, instead of this little\r\ndiplomatic master-piece, we were to find in this writing some episode\r\nafter the manner of Homer or Virgil, if Heaven had granted me their\r\ngenius: do you think we should be tempted to skip the loves of Dido at\r\nCarthage or the tears of Priam in Achilles' tent?\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MADAME RÉCAMIER\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, _Wednesday_, 10 _December_ 1828.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been to the Tiberine Academy, of which I have the\r\n    honour to be a member.

LE COMTE DE LA FERRONAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, 12 _January_ 1829.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSIEUR LE COMTE,\r\n\r\n    \"I saw the Pope on the 2nd of this month; he was good enough\r\n    to keep me with him in private audience for an hour and a\r\n    half. I must report to you the conversation which I had with\r\n    His Holiness.\r\n\r\n    \"We first spoke of France. The Pope began with the most\r\n    sincere praise of the King.\r\n\r\n    \"'At no time,' he said, 'has the Royal Family of France\r\n    displayed so complete a harmony of good qualities and\r\n    virtues. Now calm has been restored among the clergy; the\r\n    bishops have made their submission.'\r\n\r\n    \"'That submission,' I replied, 'is, in part, due to the\r\n    sagacity and moderation of Your Holiness.'\r\n\r\n    \"'I advised what seemed reasonable to me to be done,'\r\n    answered the Pope. 'There were no spiritual matters involved\r\n    in the ordinances[704]; the bishops would have done better to\r\n    leave their first letter unwritten; but, after saying, \"_Non\r\n    possutnus_,\" it was difficult for them to withdraw. They\r\n    tried to display as little contradiction as possible between\r\n    their actions and their language at the moment of their\r\n    adhesion: we must forgive them for it. They are pious men,\r\n    firmly attached to the King and the Monarchy; they have their\r\n    weaknesses in common with all men.'\r\n\r\n    \"All this, monsieur le comte, was said in very clear and\r\n    excellent French.\r\n\r\n    \"After thanking the Holy Father for the confidence which he\r\n    showed me, I spoke to him in terms of consideration of the\r\n    Cardinal Secretary of State:\r\n\r\n    \"'I chose him,' he said, 'because he has travelled, because\r\n    he knows the general affairs of Europe and because he seemed\r\n    to me to possess the sort of capacity which his post demands.\r\n    He has written, with respect to your two ordinances, only\r\n    what I thought and what I recommended him to write.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Might I venture to give Your Holiness,' I resumed, 'my\r\n    opinion of the religious situation in France?'\r\n\r\n    \"'You will be doing me a great pleasure,' replied the Pope.\r\n\r\n    \"I suppress a few compliments which His Holiness was good\r\n    enough to address to me.\r\n\r\n    \"'I think then, Most Holy Father, that the mischief arose\r\n    in the first place from a mistake of the clergy: instead of\r\n    supporting the new institutions, or at least keeping silence\r\n    respecting those institutions, they allowed words of blame,\r\n    to say no more, to escape in their charges and sermons.\r\n    Irreligious persons, who were at a loss with what to reproach\r\n    saintly ministers, seized upon those words and made a weapon\r\n    of them; they cried that Catholicism was incompatible with\r\n    the establishment of public liberty, that it was war to the\r\n    death between the Charter and the priests. By holding the\r\n    opposite conduct, our ecclesiastics would have obtained all\r\n    they wanted from the nation. There is a great ground-work of\r\n    religion in France and a visible inclination to forget our\r\n    old misfortunes at the foot of the altars; but also there is\r\n    a real attachment to the institutions introduced by the sons\r\n    of St. Louis. It would be impossible to calculate the measure\r\n    of power to which the clergy might have attained, if they had\r\n    shown themselves at the same time friends to the King and\r\n    the Charter. I have never ceased to preach this policy in my\r\n    writings and in my speeches; but the passions of the moment\r\n    refused me a hearing and took me for an enemy.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Pope had listened to me with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n    \"'I enter into your ideas,' he said, after a moment's\r\n    pause. 'Jesus Christ made no pronouncement as to the\r\n    form of governments. \"Render to Cæsar the things that\r\n    are Cæsar's[705]\" means only, \"Obey the established\r\n    authorities.\" The Catholic religion has prospered in the\r\n    midst of republics as in the bosom of monarchies; it has made\r\n    immense progress in the United States; it reigns alone in\r\n    Spanish America.'\r\n\r\n    \"These words are very remarkable, monsieur le comte, at the\r\n    very moment when the Court of Rome is strongly inclining to\r\n    establish the bishops nominated by Bolivar[706].\r\n\r\n    \"The Pope resumed:\r\n\r\n    \"'You see how great is the influx of Protestant strangers\r\n    to Rome: their presence does good to the country; but it is\r\n    also good in another respect: the English come here with\r\n    strange notions regarding the Pope and the Papacy, the\r\n    fanaticism of the clergy, the slavery of the people in this\r\n    country; they have not stayed here two months before they\r\n    are quite changed. They see that I am only a bishop like any\r\n    other bishop, that the Roman clergy are neither ignorant nor\r\n    persecuting, and that my subjects are not beasts of burden!'\r\n\r\n    \"Encouraged by this sort of effusion of the heart, and\r\n    seeking to widen the scope of the conversation, I said to the\r\n    Sovereign Pontiff:\r\n\r\n    \"'Does not Your Holiness think that the moment is\r\n    favourable for the recomposition of Catholic unity, for\r\n    the reconciliation of the dissenting sects, by some slight\r\n    concessions of discipline? The prejudices against the Court\r\n    of Rome are vanishing in every quarter and, in a century\r\n    which was still ardent, the work of reunion had already been\r\n    attempted by Leibnitz[707] and Bossuet.'\r\n\r\n    \"'This is a great matter,' said the Pope; 'but I must await\r\n    the moment fixed by Providence. I agree that the prejudices\r\n    are vanishing; the division of the sects in Germany has\r\n    brought about the lassitude of those sects. In Saxony, where\r\n    I resided for three years, I was the first to establish a\r\n    foundling hospital and to obtain that this hospital should\r\n    be served by Catholics. A general outcry arose against me at\r\n    the time among the Protestants; to-day those same Protestants\r\n    are the first to praise and endow the institution. The number\r\n    of Catholics is increasing in Great Britain; it is true that\r\n    they include many foreigners.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Pope pausing for a moment, I took occasion to introduce\r\n    the question of the Irish Catholics:\r\n\r\n    \"'If the emancipation takes place,' I said, 'the Catholic\r\n    religion will increase still more in Great Britain.'\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Pope Leo XII. on Ireland.]\r\n\r\n    \"'That is true on one side,' replied His Holiness, 'but\r\n    on the other there are disadvantages. The Irish Catholics\r\n    are very ardent and very incautious. Has not O'Connell, in\r\n    other respects a man of merit, gone so far as to say that\r\n    a concordat had been proposed between the Holy See and the\r\n    British Government? There is not a word of truth in this\r\n    assertion; I cannot contradict it publicly; and it has given\r\n    me great pain. And so, for the union of the dissenters, it\r\n    is necessary that things should be ripe and that God Himself\r\n    should complete His work. The popes can only wait.'\r\n\r\n    \"This was not my opinion, monsieur le comte; but my business\r\n    was to inform the King of the Holy Father's opinion on so\r\n    serious a subject, not to combat it.\r\n\r\n    \"'What will your newspapers say?' asked the Pope, with a sort\r\n    of gaiety. 'They talk a great deal! Those of the Netherlands\r\n    still more; but I am told that, in your country, nobody\r\n    thinks of their articles an hour after they have read them.'\r\n\r\n    \"'That is absolutely true, Most Holy Father: you see how\r\n    the _Gazette de France_ deals with me,'--for I know that\r\n    His Holiness reads all our newspapers, not excepting the\r\n    _Courrier_--'and still the Sovereign Pontiff treats me with\r\n    extreme kindness; I have reason to believe, therefore, that\r\n    the _Gazette_ does not make a great impression on him.'--The\r\n    Pope laughed and shook his head.--'Well, Most Holy Father,\r\n    there are others like Your Holiness; when the paper tells\r\n    the truth, the good it says remains; if it lies, it is as\r\n    though it had said nothing at all. The Pope must expect some\r\n    speeches during this session: the Extreme Right will maintain\r\n    that M. le Cardinal Bernetti is not a priest and that his\r\n    letters on the ordinances are not articles of faith; the\r\n    Extreme Left will declare that we need not have taken our\r\n    orders from Rome. The majority will commend the deference of\r\n    the Privy Council and will loudly praise the spirit of peace\r\n    and wisdom of Your Holiness.'\r\n\r\n    \"This little explanation appeared to charm the Holy Father,\r\n    who was pleased to meet with some one acquainted with the\r\n    workings of our constitutional machine. Finally, monsieur le\r\n    comte, thinking that the King and his Council would like to\r\n    know the views of the Pope on the present state of affairs\r\n    in the East, I repeated some news out of the papers, not\r\n    being authorized to communicate to the Holy See the positive\r\n    facts of which you informed me in your dispatch of the 18th\r\n    December touching the recall of our expedition to the Morea.\r\n\r\n    \"The Pope did not hesitate to reply; he appeared to me to\r\n    be alarmed at the imprudence of instructing the Turks in\r\n    military discipline. I give his own words:\r\n\r\n    \"'If the Turks are already capable of resisting Russia, what\r\n    will their power be when they have obtained a glorious peace?\r\n    Who will prevent them, after four or five years spent in rest\r\n    and in perfecting their new tactics, from hurling themselves\r\n    upon Italy?'\r\n\r\n    \"I will confess, monsieur le comte, that, when I recognised\r\n    these ideas and these anxieties in the mind of the Sovereign\r\n    most exposed to the effects of the consequence of the\r\n    enormous error that has been committed, I congratulated\r\n    myself on having displayed to you in fuller detail, in\r\n    my Note on Eastern Affairs, the same ideas and the same\r\n    anxieties.\r\n\r\n    \"'Nothing,' added the Pope, 'except a firm resolution on the\r\n    part of the Allied Powers, can put an end to a misfortune\r\n    which threatens the future. France and England are still\r\n    in time to stop everything; but, if a new campaign open,\r\n    it can set Europe on fire, and then it will be too late to\r\n    extinguish it.'\r\n\r\n    \"'That reflection is the more just,' I answered, 'seeing\r\n    that, if Europe were to become divided, which God forbid, the\r\n    presence of fifty thousand Frenchmen would stir up the whole\r\n    question again.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Pope made no reply; only it appeared to me that the\r\n    idea of seeing the French in Italy filled him with no sort\r\n    of fear. Every one is weary of the inquisition of the Court\r\n    of Vienna, of its cavilling, of its continual encroachments\r\n    and of its little plots to unite the peoples which detest the\r\n    Austrian yoke into a confederation against France.\r\n\r\n    \"This, monsieur le comte, is a summary of my long\r\n    conversation with His Holiness. I do not know that any one\r\n    has ever been in a position to know more thoroughly the inner\r\n    sentiments of the Pope, that any one has ever heard a prince\r\n    who governs the Christian world express himself so plainly on\r\n    subjects so vast and so far removed from the narrow circle\r\n    of diplomatic commonplaces. Here there was no intermediary\r\n    between the Sovereign Pontiff and myself and it was easy to\r\n    see that Leo XII., thanks to his candid character and the\r\n    impulse of a familiar conversation, dissimulated nothing and\r\n    in no way sought to deceive.\r\n\r\n    \"The leanings and wishes of the Pope are evidently towards\r\n    France: when he assumed the Keys of St. Peter, he belonged\r\n    to the faction of the _zelanti_; to-day he has sought his\r\n    strength in moderation: that is what the habit of power\r\n    always teaches. For this reason he is not beloved by the\r\n    faction of cardinals which he has quitted. Finding no man\r\n    of talent in the secular clergy, he has chosen his chief\r\n    advisers among the regular clergy; hence it comes that the\r\n    monks are on his side, while the prelates and the simple\r\n    priests make a sort of opposition to him. The latter, when I\r\n    arrived in Rome, all had their minds more or less infected\r\n    with the lies of our congregation; they are now infinitely\r\n    more reasonable; they all, generally speaking, blame the\r\n    rising in arms of our clergy. It is curious to remark that\r\n    the Jesuits have as many enemies here as in France: they have\r\n    as their special adversaries the other religious and the\r\n    heads of Orders. They had formed a plan by means of which\r\n    they would have seized upon the public instruction in Rome to\r\n    the exclusion of the others: the Dominicans have foiled that\r\n    plan. The Pope is not very popular, because he administers\r\n    well. His little army consists of old soldiers of Bonaparte,\r\n    who have a very military bearing and keep excellent order on\r\n    the high-roads. If material Rome has lost in picturesqueness,\r\n    it has gained in cleanliness and healthiness. His Holiness\r\n    plants trees and arrests hermits and beggars: another subject\r\n    of complaint for the populace. Leo XII. is a great worker;\r\n    he sleeps little and eats scarcely at all. Only one taste\r\n    remains to him of his youth, that of sport, an exercise\r\n    necessary to his health, which, for that matter, seems\r\n    to be improving. He has a few shots with a fowling-piece\r\n    in the vast enclosure of the Gardens of the Vatican. The\r\n    _zelanti_ find it very difficult to forgive him this innocent\r\n    diversion. The Pope is reproached with the weakness and\r\n    inconstancy of his affections.\r\n\r\n    \"The radical vice of the political constitution of this\r\n    country is easily seized upon: it is old men who appoint as\r\n    sovereign an old man like themselves. This old man, when\r\n    he becomes the master, in his turn appoints old men as\r\n    cardinals. Turning in this vicious circle, the enervated\r\n    supreme power is in this way always at the edge of the tomb.\r\n    The prince never occupies the throne for a long enough\r\n    period to execute the plans of improvement which he may\r\n    have conceived. A pope ought to have sufficient resolution\r\n    suddenly to promote a number of young cardinals, in such\r\n    a way as to ensure at the next election the majority of a\r\n    young pope. But the rules of Sixtus V.[708], which give the\r\n    hat to palace employments, the empire of custom and habit,\r\n    the interests of the people, who receive gratifications at\r\n    each change of the tiara, the individual ambition of the\r\n    cardinals, who wish for short reigns in order to multiply\r\n    their chances of the papacy, these and a thousand other\r\n    obstacles too long to narrate are opposed to the rejuvenation\r\n    of the Sacred College.\r\n\r\n    \"The conclusion of this dispatch, monsieur le comte, is that,\r\n    in the present condition of affairs, the King can reckon\r\n    entirely on the Court of Rome.\r\n\r\n    \"Cautious as I am in my manner of seeing and feeling, if I\r\n    have anything with which to reproach myself in the report\r\n    which I have the honour to send you, it is that I have\r\n    weakened rather than exaggerated the expression of His\r\n    Holiness' words. My memory is very safe; I wrote down the\r\n    conversation on leaving the Vatican and my private secretary\r\n    has simply copied it word for word from my minutes. The\r\n    latter, rapidly jotted down, were hardly legible to myself.\r\n    You would never have been able to decipher them[709].\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honour to be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME RÉCAMIER\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"ROME, _Tuesday_, 13 _January_ 1829.\r\n\r\n    \"Yesterday evening, at eight o'clock, I wrote you the letter\r\n    which M.

You know the poor ladies of Saint-Denis:\r\n    they have been much neglected since the arrival of the great\r\n    ladies of the Trinità-del-Monte; without being the enemy of\r\n    the latter, I have taken the side of the former with Madame\r\n    de Ch. For the last month, the ladies of Saint-Denis have\r\n    been wishing to give a fête in honour of 'M. the Ambassador'\r\n    and 'Madame the Ambassadress:' it took place yesterday at\r\n    mid-day. Imagine a theatre arranged in a sort of sacristy\r\n    with a platform giving on to the church; as actors, a dozen\r\n    young girls from eight years to fourteen, who played the\r\n    _Machabées._ They had themselves made their helmets and\r\n    cloaks. They spoke their French lines with an enthusiasm\r\n    and an Italian accent which were the funniest things in the\r\n    world; they stamped their feet at energetic moments: there\r\n    was a niece of Pius VII., a daughter of Thorwaldsen, and\r\n    another daughter of Chauvin[711] the painter. They were\r\n    incredibly pretty in their paper finery. The one who played\r\n    the High Priest had a great black beard which delighted\r\n    her but pricked her, and which she was constantly obliged\r\n    to put right with a little thirteen-year-old white hand.\r\n    As spectators, ourselves, a few mothers, the nuns, Madame\r\n    Salvage, two or three priests and a further score of little\r\n    school-girls, all in white, with veils. We had had cakes\r\n    and ices brought from the Embassy. They played the piano\r\n    between the acts. Imagine the hopes and joys which, must have\r\n    preceded this fête at the convent, and the memories which\r\n    will follow it!

I began an excavation there two days ago, on\r\n    Tuesday, just after I had written to you. I was accompanied\r\n    by Hyacinthe and by Visconti[712], who is directing the\r\n    excavation. The weather was the loveliest in the world.

The order has been given to close all the\r\n    theatres. I have just left the Cardinal Secretary of State,\r\n    who is himself ill and who despairs of the Pope's life. The\r\n    loss of this enlightened and modern Sovereign Pontiff would,\r\n    at the present moment, be a real calamity for Christianity\r\n    and especially for France. I thought it important, monsieur\r\n    le comte, that His Majesty's Government should be warned\r\n    of this probable event, so that it may be enabled to take\r\n    such measures beforehand as it shall consider necessary.\r\n    Consequently, I have dispatched a mounted courier to Lyons.\r\n    This courier carries a letter which I am writing to Monsieur\r\n    the Prefect of the Rhône, with a telegraphic dispatch which\r\n    he will forward to you, and another letter which I am asking\r\n    him to send you by express.
