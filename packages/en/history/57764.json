Viewing the action as a slur cast on the whole theatrical\r\nprofession, Mr. Henry E. Dixey, the well-known actor, offered to give\r\none thousand dollars to charity if it could be shown that actors,\r\nman for man, were not as good as ministers of the gospel. No champion\r\nof the cloth appearing to claim Mr. Dixey's money on that proposition,\r\nhe went further and offered another thousand dollars if there could not\r\nbe found a minister in jail for every state in the Union. This second\r\nchallenge was likewise ignored by the clergy and the association\r\nwhich had provoked it, but Mr. Dixey made a few inquiries as to\r\nthe proportion of ministers to actors among convicts. His research,\r\nwhich was far short of being thorough, discovered 43 ministers and\r\n19 actors in jail. The investigation, so far as the ministers were\r\nconcerned, could have touched only the fringe of the matter, for in\r\neight months of the year 1914 the publishers of this work counted\r\nmore than seventy reported offenses of preachers for which they were\r\nor deserved to be imprisoned, and of course the count included only\r\nthose cases reported in newspapers that reached the office through\r\nan agency which scans only the more important ones. There had been\r\nnothing like a systematic reading of the press of the country for\r\nthese cases. Judged by 1914, the clerical convicts in 1906 must have\r\nfar exceeded the number developed by Mr. Dixey's census.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing incident is introduced here to explain the nature of\r\nthis work, \"Crimes of Preachers,\" which, like Mr. Dixey's challenge\r\nto the clergy in behalf of his profession, is the reply we have to\r\nmake to the preachers in behalf of the unbelievers in their religion.\r\n\r\nThe clergy assume to be the teachers and guardians of morality, and\r\nassert not only that belief in their astonishing creeds is necessary\r\nto an upright life, but, by implication, that a profession of faith\r\nis in a sense a guarantee of morality. It has become traditionary\r\nwith them to assume that the non-Christian man is an immoral man;\r\nthat the sincere believer is the exemplar of the higher life, while\r\nthe \"Infidel,\" the unbeliever, illustrates the opposite; and that\r\nwhatever of morality the civilized world enjoys today it owes to the\r\nprofession and practice of Christianity.\r\n\r\nNow, it is wholly legitimate that systems should be judged by the\r\ncorrespondence between the claims made for them and their actual\r\nperformances. When Mrs. Eddy, for an instance, rose up and asserted\r\nthat Christian Science was the key to health, investigation into the\r\nhealth of persons professing and practicing Christian Science became\r\nat once a proper inquiry. And so, when ministers exalt the belief\r\nand practice of Christianity as the one highway to the moral life of\r\nindividuals and nations, it is equally germane to observe with some\r\ncare whether or not the clergy make good their claims in their own\r\npersons. The inquiry would be of great interest and permissible even\r\nwere Christianity offered only for our free acceptance or rejection;\r\nbut the investigation assumes the binding nature of a civic duty\r\nwhen, on the strength of these clerical pretensions, the preachers of\r\nChristianity claim and are allowed to enjoy privileges and immunities\r\nfrom the state that are not granted to other citizens. There are many\r\n\"benefits of the clergy\" besides those bestowed on them personally\r\nin the shape of half-fares, freedom from civic and military duties,\r\nand the license under the papal decree which forbids that any priest\r\nshall be brought into a civil or criminal court without the approval\r\nof his ecclesiastical superior. In the United States church property\r\nvalued at a billion and a half dollars escapes taxation on the\r\nplea that it is devoted to improving the morals of the community,\r\nand the ministers have a virtual monopoly of the first day of the\r\nweek, commonly called Sunday, on the strength of the same unproved\r\ntheory. The plea is questioned and denied by the publishers of this\r\nbook, who quote the evidences in disproof, among these being the fact\r\nof the immorality of the clergy themselves. If the religion they spend\r\ntheir lives in expounding does not keep the ministers straight, it\r\nis almost useless to ask how much restraining influence that religion\r\nhas on the laity who only listen once a week.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that just as the upright life of a professed Christian\r\nis no evidence whatever of the truth of Christian doctrine and history,\r\nso the moral delinquency of a believer is no disproof of those\r\nthings which it is necessary to accept in order to be orthodox. The\r\ncreation story, the flood story, the story of Jonah and the whale,\r\nthe virgin birth and the other miracles of the Old and New Testaments\r\nare not affected by anything a believer in them may do, either good\r\nor bad. Therefore we have been asked of what value a list of the\r\ncrimes of preachers can be to the cause of Freethought and mental\r\nliberty. The reply, couched in the language of an editorial article in\r\n\"The Truth Seeker,\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Christianity, as interpreted by its preachers, affirms a\r\n    fundamental relation between belief and morals. It claims that its\r\n    system of morals is revealed and perfect; and not only this, but\r\n    also that good morals are out of the question unless we believe\r\n    in the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n    \"There are Christian ministers, and they are of the class who have\r\n    the widest hearing, because they are 'sensational' ones, who will\r\n    tell you that unbelief is synonymous with immorality; that men are\r\n    wicked because they are Infidels, and are Infidels because they are\r\n    wicked. They argue that as religion cannot countenance anything\r\n    that is wrong, the wrongdoer must justify his course by denying\r\n    the authority of religion, and hence becomes an unbeliever in order\r\n    that his creed may not conflict with his conduct. Who has not heard\r\n    that Infidels deny the existence of hell to relieve their minds of\r\n    the uncertainty of going there when they die; that they put the\r\n    Bible aside because it will not permit their indulgences in sin,\r\n    and that a reform in conduct will be accompanied by a renunciation\r\n    of their Infidelity and a reacceptance of religion and the Bible?\r\n\r\n    \"The preachers who promulgate these principles often proceed from\r\n    the general to the particular. Having asserted the correlation of\r\n    unbelief with moral turpitude, they give pretended illustrative\r\n    instances, and they do not seem to understand that the force of\r\n    their argument is lessened by the fact that they are obliged to\r\n    invent cases and to deal with imaginary characters. Some, of\r\n    course, prefer to libel known and representative Freethinkers\r\n    instead of exercising the faculty of invention and defaming\r\n    unbelievers who are pure myths.\r\n\r\n    \"A list of ministers, guilty of crimes and immoralities, though of\r\n    unimpeached orthodoxy, is the answer to this class of falsifying\r\n    preachers, which any court must accept as historical and lawful\r\n    evidence against the pretense that good conduct grows out of\r\n    belief in Christianity. It shows that the very apostles of that\r\n    religion go wrong, that its ministers are profligate, and that\r\n    in these the theory is condemned before we come to its mere lay\r\n    exponents who less perfectly understand it.\r\n\r\n    \"People have been taught so long that piety and morality are\r\n    interchangeable terms, that they believe it without regard to the\r\n    facts which demonstrate the contrary to be true. When an individual\r\n    of reputed orthodoxy violates the moral law they accuse him of\r\n    being a hypocrite and set his religious professions down as mere\r\n    outward pretense. But here their mental narrowness is shown, for\r\n    the immoral person may be thoroughly sincere. The more firmly\r\n    he believes, the stronger may be his confidence that no mere\r\n    human weakness on his part can deprive him of the benefits of\r\n    his religion. For according to the code we are all sinners, and\r\n    the function of religion is not so much to keep us from personal\r\n    sin as to save us from its natural consequences. One has fallen\r\n    already in Adam and is therefore totally depraved, which is the\r\n    limit of depravity. How, then, can his own sins count against\r\n    him, when he cannot be depraved beyond 'totally'? His concern is\r\n    to escape the consequences of the fall, which is accomplished by\r\n    accepting the Christian scheme of salvation. His own transgressions\r\n    can be adjusted by prayer and repentance. He conceives of divine\r\n    mercy as infinite--there is no reaching the end of it; hence with\r\n    unlimited credit he may draw on his account whenever he feels\r\n    sinfully disposed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely, however, that the believer performs this mental\r\noperation before reaching a determination to do that which is\r\nwrong. Were he capable of analyzing the plan of salvation in\r\nthat manner he might doubt it. But he is like other men in the\r\nsame environment, and, like them, when inclination prompts, he\r\nfalls. Conduct, in the last analysis, is a matter of common sense, in\r\nwhich the minister and the believer are likely to be at a disadvantage\r\nas compared with the Rationalist. In our own minds we are pretty\r\nwell convinced of the reason why ministers go wrong--they have more\r\nopportunities and, among the faithful, are under less suspicion and\r\nobservation than the laity. Nevertheless we are not averse to hearing\r\nother explanations of their tendency to fall.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the Rev. Dr. Madison C. Peters, a New York clergyman,\r\noffered a theory and remedy.\r\n\r\n\"The average minister,\" said Dr. Peters, \"has only to preach a\r\ntwenty-minute or half-hour sermon on Sunday, and this, with a mid-week\r\nmeeting, constitutes his week's work. The rest of the days he is often\r\nloafing, trying to kill time. Even the weekly sermon may not be his own\r\neffort. He may be either too lazy or too ignorant to compose a sermon\r\nof his own, so he simply treats the congregation to a rehash of some\r\nother man's work, and for this he often receives a good salary. Do\r\nyou wonder that the worst passions of these men become inflamed by\r\ntheir lives of idleness? They are only human. They eat and drink of\r\nthe choicest products of the earth; they visit only the homes of the\r\nwealthy, where they are sumptuously entertained; they do not try to\r\nkeep the body in subjection to the spirit by any kind of restraint\r\nor mortification, and so their carnal passion becomes the master of\r\ntheir being, and they fall away from grace, shocking the community and\r\nscandalizing the church of God. I would make all work for their money.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the indolent habits of the stall-fed clergy contribute\r\nto their incontinence, which is recognized as their predominant\r\nweakness. While their offenses otherwise, as these pages show, range\r\nall the way from petty larceny to murder, yet the great majority are\r\nsuch as are committed with or against women and girls. The larger\r\nfigures in the list number cases of adultery, bigamy, desertion,\r\nelopement, and seduction.\r\n\r\nThat the immorality of the clergy is recognized as a matter that needs\r\nexplanation is shown by an article entitled \"Why Ministers Go Wrong,\"\r\nextracted from the \"Baptist Standard\" (Chicago), in which orthodox\r\nweekly it appeared in the latter part of the year 1913. The article,\r\nwhose author is a minister, is surprising mainly because of its\r\nfrankness and not because it tells anything not previously known or\r\nsurmised. The writer says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Do ministers of the churches, that is clergymen, priests and\r\n    preachers, go wrong in any greater proportion than do doctors,\r\n    lawyers or teachers? If one answers the question mathematically,\r\n    no; if one answers the question in the light of our moral standards\r\n    for ministers of the gospel, the negative answer will not be so\r\n    readily and decidedly given. There are few issues of the daily\r\n    newspaper without at least a single item narrating the fall of\r\n    a clergyman. It would be hard to find a man or a woman who has\r\n    not at some time in life become personally acquainted with a\r\n    professed exponent of religious truth and high moral ideals who\r\n    has demonstrated the depths of human depravity.\r\n\r\n    \"Yet the indictment against the profession is of a much more subtle\r\n    character than that found in journalistic annals of crime or even\r\n    in personal knowledge of gross faults on the part of clergymen. It\r\n    would be folly to deny that, taken as a class, ministers live\r\n    lives as pure and as free from criminal or grossly immoral taint\r\n    as any other class of persons. The indictment takes rather the\r\n    form of a general impression, amounting almost to a conviction,\r\n    that the minister does not have the clear-cut and high standards\r\n    which the business world demands.\r\n\r\n    \"Business men feel that there is something about the 'cloth'\r\n    that makes its wearer a 'doubtful proposition' when it comes to\r\n    square dealing between men. A prominent lawyer in Chicago said,\r\n    only the other day, 'I dread seeing a clergyman enter my office;\r\n    I do not want his business; he does not have the commercial honor\r\n    of the man of affairs.' He went on to give instances of ministers\r\n    who disregarded their business obligations and even ignored the\r\n    sanctity of the oath at the bar of justice.\r\n\r\n    \"It is a well-known fact among houses accustomed to extend credit\r\n    that ministers are the slowest to pay, and the most difficult from\r\n    whom to collect. In the smaller towns it would be difficult to find\r\n    a grocer without an uncollected account against some minister who\r\n    had left the place. Over five years ago such a preacher boasted in\r\n    his farewell sermon that all his bills were paid in the village,\r\n    and he 'owed not any man'; he should have said that he had paid\r\n    not any man, and some of his bills are still unpaid.\r\n\r\n    \"A charitable organization in Chicago allowed a minister in\r\n    a village nearby to become indebted to it. He promised to pay\r\n    the small account at a certain date; but a year from that time,\r\n    although many letters had been written, the bill was unpaid. Nor\r\n    was settlement made until this prominent minister on a good salary\r\n    was sent a sight draft for the amount.\r\n\r\n    \"A struggling professor in an Eastern city consented to pick out\r\n    a few books for a preacher up State, and to have them charged\r\n    to his own account, being assured that payment would be made at\r\n    once. The books were sent, but the cash never was forthcoming,\r\n    and after a lengthy correspondence, in which many excuses were\r\n    offered, the professor had to count his loss as the price he had\r\n    paid for a lesson in trusting the 'cloth.'\r\n\r\n    \"Such evidence could be extended indefinitely. The facts back\r\n    of it, with the many other instances of which these few are but\r\n    slightly indicative, have produced the decided opinion in the\r\n    business world that the minister is unreliable, and that the\r\n    ministry does not stand of necessity for admirable manliness.\r\n\r\n    \"There are many exceptions. The manly, four-square ministers are\r\n    the more noticeable because they are exceptional. There are still\r\n    more ministers who are warmly admired by their congregations,\r\n    but they are admired rather for professional traits and pulpit\r\n    graces than for the rugged virtues that count on the street and\r\n    in the store and office. On the whole, men of honor feel that\r\n    today it is no honor to be entitled 'Reverend'; the average man\r\n    looks somewhat askance at the clergyman.\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps this is nowhere better illustrated than when a minister\r\n    leaves his profession and desires to enter business. He finds\r\n    there a strong prejudice against his past; it is regarded as\r\n    unfitting him for work. When such a man goes into an office,\r\n    experience shows that he is likely to lack the qualities that\r\n    make for trustworthiness in details in the individual and for\r\n    harmony in a large force of employees.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, if the business of the minister is to teach the people\r\n    how to live, he ought at least to know how to do it himself. His\r\n    principles are valueless if they will not stand the wear of daily\r\n    life. Is the trouble with the teachings, with the message, or is\r\n    it with the man himself?\r\n\r\n    \"The first reason ministers go wrong is because they are men. They\r\n    are not angels; they are not the reincarnated ideal saints\r\n    that the sisters and the sisterly brethren like to think they\r\n    are. Because they are men they have human frailties. But, while\r\n    that does account for the fact that ministers steal and break the\r\n    express commandments the same as other men, it does not account\r\n    for the fact that they are held below par in commercial esteem.\r\n\r\n    \"As a profession the ministry seems to offer a premium on the\r\n    pretender, the impostor, the hypocrite. So long as there are the\r\n    intentional pretenders and the unconscious hypocrites in the church\r\n    they will enjoy the ministry of the pretender and hypocrite. So\r\n    long as the churches say, 'There's nothing either good or ill\r\n    but seeming makes it so,' the man who can succeed in fooling the\r\n    people with appearances of virtues, with saintly air and pious\r\n    phrase will be the man who reaches the top of his profession.\r\n\r\n    \"Then no mortal being can stand for long the fawning and adulation\r\n    which the preacher is likely to receive, especially from foolish\r\n    and emotional women. He is sure to come to believe that he is\r\n    a superior being, one who either can do no wrong or can do only\r\n    right. Steady feeding on flattery unfits him for sound counsel\r\n    regarding his shortcomings; he gets into the habit of judging\r\n    his own actions, not by any undeviating principles, but by the\r\n    measure of praise they receive.\r\n\r\n    \"There are peculiar temptations incident to the work of any man\r\n    who appears to weak minds as a demi-god on occasions, whose work\r\n    makes unusual demands on his nerve forces, and who is obliged\r\n    to work almost exclusively with women. There is not only the\r\n    temptation to license in personal virtue coupled with opportunity\r\n    in pastoral visitation; there is the tendency to conformity to\r\n    feminine standards, so that the man becomes womanly and usually\r\n    a poor kind of an old woman at that.\r\n\r\n    \"Mere preaching puts a tremendous strain on a man's moral fibre. It\r\n    is the habitual statement of duties and ideals which the preacher\r\n    knows he does not reach and do. It is the expression of the\r\n    phrases of character, not necessarily accompanied with their\r\n    expression in living and doing. It results in the mental habit\r\n    of considering a duty done as soon as it is declared. It exhausts\r\n    the moral impetus in phrases. It makes the man act the lie.\r\n\r\n    \"Intellectual dishonesty results from habitual standing as a\r\n    special pleader; as the defender of ground which has not been\r\n    honestly, candidly examined. The preacher seldom goes back to the\r\n    evidence; he argues from the conclusions of others. He stands as\r\n    an authority in that in which he frequently has made no original,\r\n    unprejudicial examination.\r\n\r\n    \"Intellectual dishonesty comes as a result of cowardice in\r\n    regard to the declaration of his own honest convictions. He is\r\n    perhaps unconsciously persuaded to teach what the church teaches\r\n    rather than what he would teach if he gave himself a chance to\r\n    think. Creeds may be small matters, after all, but the teaching\r\n    of a creed in which we do not believe is no small matter in its\r\n    effects on the teacher. There are many potent reasons for fearing\r\n    a heresy trial--often the thought of his children's hungry mouths\r\n    and bare backs is one reason. It is a good deal easier to admire\r\n    the men who went to the stake for a conviction than it is to\r\n    follow them. The truth is, no minister who is honest with himself\r\n    and who declares what he fully believes will have any reason to\r\n    fear. The church may cast him out, but he will find a thousand\r\n    voices and hearts to echo to any honest truth in his own.\r\n\r\n    \"Often the preacher is so dead sure that his motive is right,\r\n    that he does not stop to examine sufficiently his method. He wants\r\n    to save souls, and if he can do it, as it seems to him, by crooked\r\n    means more quickly than by straight ones, then he takes the crooked\r\n    way. He wants to build a church--if he can build it quicker by\r\n    misrepresentation, by double dealing, by beating any one, he thinks\r\n    only of the church, and that overweighs any other consideration.\r\n\r\n    \"Take the matter of ministers (and others, too) lying in the\r\n    stories and illustrations they tell. We have all heard preachers\r\n    tell as happening to them some incident which we read when we were\r\n    boys; perhaps before they were born. The man is so carried away\r\n    with desire to impress the truth on you that he consents to lie\r\n    to make the illustration more personal and forceful. That makes\r\n    it none the less a lie; but after he has told it that way a few\r\n    times, he forgets that it is a lie.\r\n\r\n    \"One of the principal reasons for the disrespect in which the\r\n    preacher is often regarded by the business world lies in the\r\n    shamefully unbusinesslike manner in which the preacher has been\r\n    treated in regard to compensation for his work. If his work\r\n    is worthless, why not say so and tell him to get out, and do\r\n    something worth while? If it is worth doing, then he ought to be\r\n    paid sufficient for a living without being compelled to become\r\n    a cadger and a pauper.\r\n\r\n    \"The old donation party may have had a good beginning, but it\r\n    has had a bad effect on the minister's character. Add to the\r\n    moral results of being compelled to digest frozen potatoes,\r\n    wooden turnips and other donation specimens, the experience of\r\n    being forced into the attitude, at least annually, of a beggar,\r\n    and one will begin to appreciate the difficulty the preacher has\r\n    in maintaining his self-respect. When one makes it hard for a\r\n    man to respect himself, how long is one likely to respect him?\r\n\r\n    \"When the man in the pulpit is dependent for his daily bread on\r\n    the tolerance and good will of the man in the pew; when he feels\r\n    that he may get butter on his bread or even a little cake now and\r\n    then if he can only get in the good graces of that smug old sinner\r\n    sitting down there, it is easy to see how he has been tempted to\r\n    fawn on him, how he has been tempted to speak of the old humbug's\r\n    robbery of the widow and the orphan as one of the achievements\r\n    of modern commerce and civilization. It has always been 'hard\r\n    hitting the devil over the back if you are feeding his belly.'\r\n\r\n    \"The preacher in the country and in the old days could get along\r\n    very well between the neighborly gifts he received and the produce\r\n    of his little farm or garden when these were added to his small\r\n    salary. But when, without increase of salary, that same man is\r\n    placed in the city in our days of swollen prices for necessities,\r\n    he is hard put to it to keep out of debt and remain honest in\r\n    the ministry. Under the pressure some men have turned to crooked\r\n    schemes, to selling mining stocks and other bogus investments,\r\n    and some have gone out of the ministry. But the greater number\r\n    have stayed in and are working hard to make ends meet and to\r\n    stay straight.\r\n\r\n    \"Ministers have gone wrong because they have not been trained\r\n    right in their professional schools; they have been educated only\r\n    for oratorical labor, and that with the intent of persuading men\r\n    to certain things by dint of their eloquence. What seminaries are\r\n    giving courses corresponding to those in other professional schools\r\n    on professional ethics? They have gone wrong in instances because\r\n    their employers, the people, have not treated them right, have not\r\n    given them a fair chance to live right; they have paid them, and\r\n    are paying them less than we pay mechanics and clerks, and yet they\r\n    expect the minister to live according to their social standards.\r\n\r\n    \"When the people who employ the ministers will give them an\r\n    honest return for their work, when they will also encourage\r\n    them to be honest in their preaching and teaching, there will be\r\n    fewer unworthy ministers. When the theological schools get out\r\n    of their shells and into the cities, and the preachers get out\r\n    of their cloth and among folk, when they take off their garments\r\n    of sanctimoniousness and get busy helping and leading others to\r\n    better living, and to making this world a better place to live in,\r\n    the ministers will be a good many notches higher in the world's\r\n    esteem. It is needless to say there are a great many ministers\r\n    who have made good in these ways.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thus a view of the clerical profession from the inside, the\r\nwriter having turned state's evidence. In the closing paragraph there\r\nis an intimation that liberal preaching, or \"honest\" preaching, with a\r\ndiscarding of the cloak of sanctimoniousness, will react on clerical\r\nmorality and thus raise the preachers in the world's esteem. That\r\nview is borne out by the figures showing that the ministers of the\r\nliberal sects are the best behaved.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the \"Baptist Standard,\" commenting on the article\r\nwhich he prints and which we have quoted, attributes the clergy's\r\npoor reputation for morality to the \"yellow journal,\" which he says\r\n\"will get twice as black in the face as it will over any other person\r\nof equal prominence.\" The Baptist editor complains because--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A cross-roads clergyman who runs away with his organist will\r\n    get more attention than a congressman who goes off with his\r\n    stenographer. The senile philanderings of a former United States\r\n    senator did not get a front-page position so often as did a\r\n    comparatively obscure clergyman who a few years ago failed to\r\n    get gold out of sea-water, but did get it out of the purses of\r\n    customers who thought they had a 'good thing.' Why? The answer\r\n    throws a flood of light upon the question at issue. Because out\r\n    of tens of thousands of ministers, all of them working under the\r\n    obvious limitations and temptations to which the article makes\r\n    reference, those who go wrong are so few that, when such instances\r\n    occur, they are played up, because they are news. When a lawyer\r\n    or a physician, or a bank president, or a commercial traveler\r\n    is found with the broken fragments of the seventh commandment on\r\n    his person, it is no news, at least relatively speaking, and it\r\n    is given an inside page. This is an unconscious tribute of the\r\n    sensational press to the high estimate in which the clerical\r\n    profession is in general held.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of the religious editor might account for the notoriety\r\ngiven a delinquent minister, but no amount of publicity could create\r\nthe fact of his delinquency. He has to run off with his organist before\r\nthe yellow journal chronicles the event. And if more publicity is given\r\nhim than is received by the lawyer, physician and bank president when\r\nthe facts come out, the notoriety in known cases is more than offset\r\nby the secrecy preserved by the minister's congregation and friends\r\nin nine cases out of ten, so that the papers never get hold of the\r\nmatter at all.\r\n\r\nBut the defense based on extraordinary notoriety breaks down when we\r\nremember that the preacher who wrote the article we reproduce does not\r\ndepend on the press for his knowledge of the clerical character. He has\r\nfirst-hand information of his own, and makes the assertion, moreover,\r\nthat \"it would be hard to find a man or a woman who has not at some\r\ntime in life become personally acquainted with a professed exponent of\r\nreligious truth and high moral ideals who has demonstrated the depths\r\nof human depravity.\" This may or may not be an exaggeration; it agrees,\r\nhowever, with the testimony of purchasers of the previous editions of\r\nthis pamphlet, who generally fail to find in its pages certain cases of\r\nclerical depravity they have individually met. And we do not suppose\r\nthat one act of immorality in a thousand committed by clergymen is\r\never known to anyone but himself. Not regarding ministers as worse\r\nthan other men in this respect, we may yet reasonably conclude that\r\nthey practice the customary male reserve, and therefore are no more\r\ngiven to relating all the incidents of their lives--the only way such\r\nincidents could become known--than members of the laity.\r\n\r\nThe indictment really is not against the ministers as men--it is\r\nagainst their religion and their profession. There is so close a\r\nrelation between religious emotion and what is called desire, that\r\nscientific men have written treatises and books on the correlation\r\nof religion and lust. The more fervent the preacher is godward, the\r\nmore ardent is he womanward--and piety works the same way with the\r\nsisters. Our preacher who has turned state's evidence blames among\r\nother things the pastoral visit and the emotional women who place\r\ntemptation before the man of God. He is concerned only with the\r\nminister, but the minister is as often a tempter as a victim. He\r\nimproves the opportunities the pastoral visit affords, and makes\r\nhis share of the advances. It may be that only men without mental\r\nhonesty--men who are willing to profess to believe and to teach what\r\nthey feel is false--are entering the ministry. In that case the worst\r\nis to be expected, and their conduct is accounted for by their lack of\r\nprinciple. The \"Standard's\" contributor offers the novel excuse that\r\nthe minister uses up so much of his virtue in phrasing and uttering\r\nmoral precepts that he has no strength left for applying them. The\r\nproposition is worth the notice of the churches; for if true it means\r\nthat the vocation of a preacher devitalizes a man of his moral stamina.\r\n\r\nThe religious editor and his contributor disagree on an important\r\npoint. The editor holds that the fuss made over one minister who goes\r\nwrong with his organist is a tribute to the high estimate in which\r\nthe profession is held. On the other hand, the contributor represents\r\nthat most ministers are moral skates, and that any high estimate the\r\nprofession enjoys is due to the few decent exceptions. The distinction\r\nis vital.\r\n\r\nThe orthodox religious standards to which a minister is supposed to\r\nmeasure up are admittedly responsible for much moral laxity. Besides\r\nthe sincerely orthodox preacher (whose religious austerity never\r\nprevents him from erring sexually), there are thousands of ministers\r\nwho live a mental or intellectual lie by remaining in the church\r\nand preaching the creeds they do not believe. And the church does\r\nnot trouble itself about the minister's doubts so long as he keeps\r\nthem to himself. What can the church expect, then, from the religious\r\nhypocrite in the pulpit except that he will be a moral hypocrite out\r\nof it? Is he going to be dishonest as a preacher and honest as a man?\r\n\r\nThe Baptist paper's contributor puts the query: \"Do ministers of\r\nthe churches, that is, clergymen, priests and preachers, go wrong\r\nin any greater proportion than do doctors, lawyers or teachers?\" He\r\ngives a negative answer, \"mathematically,\" but the very asking of the\r\nquestion proves that an affirmative reply was not unexpected. Had he\r\nincluded editors in his list it could have been given. The literary\r\nand editorial professions are very poorly represented in our prisons,\r\nand even printers are exceedingly scarce.\r\n\r\nThis compilation, periodically revised and enlarged, has been before\r\nthe public in its nine successive editions since 1881, as is stated in\r\none of its prefaces; and considering that its information is based on\r\nnewspaper reports, the number of corrections demanded by the ministers\r\nwhose names are herein enrolled is small. The following is the only\r\nthreat of action with which the publishers have been menaced. We\r\nfollow the style of the clerical gentleman, who writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"BLUFFTON O.--5-12/1905.\r\n\r\n    \"The Truth Seeker Co., No. 28 Lafayette Place, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n    \"Sirs I notice you have published a Book The title of which is\r\n    Crimes of Preachers in U. S. and Canada In which you have the\r\n    name of Shelter, of McClure O. Now sirs, if the Copies of that\r\n    Book is not called in and DESTROYED AND ITS PUBLICATION CEAS at\r\n    once and the same notice bein given in your paper so published\r\n    by your Co. in side of 20 days, ACTION will be taken against\r\n    YOU immediately for blackmailing. The above name used by you is\r\n    the untruth,\r\n\r\n    \"Trusting to heare from you early. Yours.\r\n\r\n    \"J. Shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J. Shelter heard from the publishers early, but not only did he\r\nfail to keep up the correspondence, but apparently abandoned altogether\r\nhis contemplated action. The charge against the Rev. John Shelter,\r\nof the United Brethren church, is that in 1890, at McClure, Ohio, he\r\nsold liquor without a license. All we can gather from his apparent\r\ndenial is that the name used by us is not the true one. However,\r\nhe does not take the trouble to correct it.\r\n\r\nAnother correction was personally solicited. In the ninth edition\r\nappeared an entry condensed from the following newspaper clipping,\r\ndated at a Connecticut town:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If the Rev. ---- ----. ----, the ---- minister who eloped with\r\n    Mrs. ---- ----. ----, of ----, and who is being sued for divorce by\r\n    his wife on the ground of intolerable cruelty, had been publicly\r\n    drummed out, his expulsion from the Methodist church could not\r\n    have been more emphatic and humiliating. This afternoon, after\r\n    more than an hour's debate in executive session, the New York East\r\n    Conference of the Methodist church voted, practically unanimously,\r\n    to allow him to withdraw 'under complaints.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur entry, above mentioned, concerning this preacher, recorded:\r\n\"Eloped with a married woman; cruelty to wife; expelled from the\r\nministry.\" The entry should now be: \"Personally appeared before\r\nus the reverend gentleman whose name is suppressed and requested\r\nthe removal of the aforesaid entry, on the ground that there was no\r\nelopement.\" While acceding to the request, we have the feeling that\r\nwith his name left out the book does not quite justify its title. The\r\npreacher whom the New York East Conference of the Methodist church\r\ngot rid of in the emphatic and humiliating manner described by the\r\nclipping is now a Presbyterian clergyman and doctor of divinity. The\r\nnames of more deserving men are very likely retained, for the gentleman\r\nshowed himself so lacking in loyalty to his class that he voluntarily\r\ngave information regarding other Methodist ministers, including a\r\nwell-known editor, which could have been used to their hurt.\r\n\r\nAn act of favoritism on our part which we might prefer to commit would\r\nbe in the case of the reverend president of a Southern college who\r\ncame to Philadelphia for some unremembered purpose, and was found dead\r\nin the house of a woman with whom he had made an assignation. This\r\nbook would be kinder to his family than were the public prints at\r\nthe time of the tragedy if it would do any good to the survivors. One\r\ntoward whom we have not felt that any especial consideration is due\r\nis a minister of Jamestown, N. Y., who disappeared from a steamer\r\non the Sound in circumstances pointing to suicide, leaving with his\r\neffects a note in which he said: \"Let not those 'insane babblers' or\r\nInfidels get hold of this for their miserable, God-dishonoring yearly\r\nbook on the crimes of preachers.\" We cannot see that it dishonors God\r\nto print what God permits his preachers to do. The man in this case\r\nwished his wife and relatives to regard him as dead because he had\r\nanother woman in view, and was shortly found living with her in Albany.\r\n\r\nSome amusing uses have been made of this volume. In 1909 the opponents\r\nof a bill before the legislature of California cited, to its prejudice,\r\nthe fact that members of the clerical profession were against its\r\npassage. The gentleman who appeared before the legislative committee\r\nin behalf of the bill offered this list of reverend delinquents\r\nand inquired whether these were included among the ministers whose\r\nopposition was allowed to weigh with the committee. Ministers\r\nwho undertake legislative work and pose as \"Reformers\" are often\r\nunfortunate in their moral character. There has been a singular series\r\nof mishaps among the conspicuous maintainers of the sanctity of the\r\nSabbath who have allied themselves with organizations to promote\r\nSunday observance by the saloon-keepers. The following list of them\r\ngathered in a single state is taken from a Detroit newspaper called\r\n\"Truth\" in 1905:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Rev. R. G. Malone, superintendent of the Grand Traverse\r\n    district, arrested for licentious conduct; fled the state; now\r\n    in employ of Minnesota League.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. George Kulp, League orator, Grand Rapids, arrested\r\n    for adultery.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Ralph Baldwin, League in Saginaw, fled after being\r\n    exposed in a liaison with a Detroit woman.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. John M. Wright, an organizer and orator for the League\r\n    from Muskegon, proven guilty of perjury in a divorce case.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Orson D. Taylor, a Saginaw League organizer and orator,\r\n    sent to House of Correction for thefts.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. E. I. Waldorf, another Saginaw League worker, sent to\r\n    House of Correction for thefts.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. C. E. Lee, a prominent League worker and orator in Grand\r\n    Rapids, expelled from his church for licentiousness.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. J. Printer, a Branch county League organizer, fled the\r\n    state to escape arrest for bigamy.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Charles Kirchner, St. Clair county League organizer and\r\n    orator, betrayed his foster daughter.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Jos. St. Johns, Pontiac member of the League's force of\r\n    workers, serving a term for assaulting a colored girl.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. J. R. Andrews, a Lansing League orator, expelled from\r\n    church and arrested for blackmail.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. S. A. Northrop, one of the League's most gifted orators\r\n    at Owosso, expelled from his church for undue intimacy with women\r\n    of the congregation.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. John Smith, a Grand Rapids League orator and ardent\r\n    supporter, eloped with one of the women of his church.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Dr. J. G. Holiday, Manistee county organizer, expelled\r\n    from his church for swindling.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. William P. Squires, Bay City organizer and orator for\r\n    the League, expelled from his church for falsehood and swindling.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. A. C. Marshall, from Amboy, Hillsdale county,\r\n    League worker and orator at Corunna, expelled from church for\r\n    licentiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of clerical reformers in the East whose\r\nrecords cannot be cited to their advantage. One went against the\r\nSabbath breakers in Brooklyn, was arrested for blackmail and forfeited\r\nhis bond. One in West Virginia fought the theaters and Sunday trains,\r\nbut he turned out a gallows bird, a bigamist, and the thief of his\r\nchildren's inheritance. One went to combat license in Brattleboro,\r\nVermont, but turned up too drunk to go on with the lecture. One in New\r\nJersey railed against Sunday liberty, but beat his wife and eloped with\r\na choir singer. One of Boston stood in the pulpit with the blood of a\r\ngirl seduced and murdered on his hands and demanded legal suppression\r\nof Sunday baseball. The \"phrasing of morality,\" thus becoming a habit\r\nwith the clergy, does not conflict with their other vices.\r\n\r\nWherever a reform is attacked by the clergy on moral grounds\r\nthe usefulness of this work is appreciable. In Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\nthe secretary of a Socialist group was debating with a prominent\r\nPresbyterian minister, when the preacher incautiously asserted that\r\nSocialism would break up the home, and paraded the horrible example\r\nof a Socialist professor who had been divorced by his wife. The\r\nproponent of Socialism, expressing his regrets that so irrelevant a\r\nmatter had been brought into the argument, produced a copy of \"Crimes\r\nof Preachers\" to show how the home had fared at the hands of men of\r\nhis opponent's profession.\r\n\r\nIncidentals to the downfall of the preachers are sometimes\r\ndramatic. One exhorted his congregation to confession and repentance,\r\nwhereupon his contrite landlady, much moved, made public the\r\nfact that she had been living with him in adultery, and asked for\r\nprayers. Another, having worked his hearers to the proper condition,\r\nsaid: \"Let us all lay our sins upon the altar.\" A young woman with\r\nan infant in her arms came forward and, handing him the baby, said:\r\n\"Here's yours.\" It appeared that he was the father of the child,\r\nthough not married to the mother.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the papal decree, which of late years\r\nhas shown renewed capacity for mischief, protecting a priest from\r\nprosecution by any Catholic without a bishop or other superior's\r\nconsent. It is a survival of the \"benefit of clergy\" law under which\r\nthe church claimed the right to try the cases of clerical offenders,\r\ninstead of letting them go before the civil courts. The working of this\r\ndecree was illustrated in New York recently when a priest attempted\r\nan immoral act with an eight or ten-year-old girl. The mother of the\r\ngirl, unmindful of the prohibition, reported the case to the police,\r\nand caused the lecherous clergyman's arrest, but later, having been\r\nadvised by one of the higher clergy of the diocese, withdrew the charge\r\nand declined to testify against the accused, who appears to have been\r\nliberated after a reprimand by the court. It must be obvious that\r\nwith this rule in force, all but the most serious offenses of the\r\nCatholic clergy will escape public notice. When in 1913 the murder\r\nof Anna Aumuller had been traced to the Rev. Hans Schmidt, a priest\r\nof a New York church, the police arrested and the courts convicted\r\nthe reverend criminal; yet the Rev. Hans Schmidt had committed other\r\ncrimes previous to this, and was known by his Catholic acquaintances to\r\nbe a man of immoral life. He enjoyed, however, the benefit of clergy,\r\nand was protected by it from the exposure that would have come earlier\r\nbut for the Catholic ban on \"scandal,\" and that would not have come\r\nat all but for his sensational crime. With this wall of secrecy thrown\r\nabout the priestly life, we know not what immoralities and crimes take\r\nplace among the clergy and never come to light. While this edition of\r\n\"Crimes of Preachers\" is in preparation a Chicago Catholic priest,\r\nin line for distinguished honors from his church, takes an automobile\r\n\"joy ride,\" visits a saloon in the suburbs and ends the outing by\r\nstabbing a station agent to the heart. The published offenses of the\r\npriests are such, usually, as in the nature of things cannot be covered\r\nup. For them there is no such offense as conduct unbecoming a priest,\r\ncarrying the penalty of deposition and exposure.\r\n\r\nIn this edition an attempt has been made to shorten the list of\r\nterms by which the offenses of the preachers have hitherto been\r\ndescribed. Now such breaches of good morals as were variously named\r\n\"Beecherism,\" \"immoralities,\" \"lascivious conduct,\" \"lechery,\"\r\n\"scandalous conduct,\" \"unministerial conduct,\" and the like have\r\nbeen brought under the head of \"Immoralities with women and girls\r\nmiscellaneously and variously described,\" which is as definite as\r\nthe previously used terms, and saves space.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the total number of offenses charged is\r\nconsiderably greater than the total number of ministers involved. This\r\nresults from the complicated character of some of the delinquencies\r\nof the reverends. A married minister betrays a young woman, thereby\r\ncommitting seduction and adultery. There may be a child and a charge of\r\nbastardy. He may run away with her, adding elopement and desertion of\r\nwife and family, and often divorce. Elopements are numerous, and they\r\nare mentioned here only when complicated with adultery or desertion,\r\nsince the unmarried parson is entitled to his romance, and not to be\r\ncensured above other men if he makes a runaway match of it--the woman\r\nconcerned having reached or survived the ages of discretion without\r\nany matrimonial alliance at present existing. So the adulteries,\r\nseductions, etc., are all enlarged, while only one name is added to\r\nthe number of ministers.\r\n\r\nIn only about two-thirds of the cases are the denominations of the\r\nclerical law-breakers known, that detail being often omitted by rural\r\nreporters or correspondents in whom the news sense is but imperfectly\r\ndeveloped. The instances in which the communion is supplied give the\r\nMethodists first place, Baptists second, and Catholics third. The\r\nnumber of each is not disproportionate to the total number of clergy\r\nof the given denominations. Nothing appears to show that there is any\r\ngreat disparity between sects or between Protestants and Catholics\r\nin point of morality. There are, say, 170,000 ministers in the\r\nUnited States, 15,000 of them Catholic. That is ten parsons to one\r\npriest. Of the 3,795 ministers in this directory, 325 are Catholics,\r\nor about 1 priest to 10 non-Catholic clergymen.\r\n\r\nCatholics do not have so many clergymen in proportion to their\r\ncommunicants as the Protestant sects. With them one priest has to\r\nserve a thousand adherents (provided they have the sixteen million\r\ncommunicants they claim), while the Baptists, with less than six\r\nmillion communicants, have nearly forty-three thousand ministers, and\r\nthe Methodists, with seven million members, report upwards of forty-one\r\nthousand ministers. With such a multiplication of pulpiteers and a\r\nlow standard of qualification for the ministry, the bad preeminence\r\nof the Methodist parsons is explained. It has been noticed already\r\nthat priests are not publicly exposed in such peccadilloes as might\r\ncost a Protestant minister his pulpit or a layman his standing in\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be inappropriate to quote the following comment on an excuse\r\noffered for the two delegates to the Methodist conference of 1912,\r\nwho were caught with the broken fragments of the seventh commandment\r\non their person, or rather almost in the act of breaking them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The fact that two of the ministers who attended the late\r\n    Methodist conference in Indianapolis committed the statutory\r\n    offense before they went home led Pastor Dinsmore of the Baptist\r\n    church of Anderson, Ind., to which state one of the delinquents\r\n    belonged, to deliver a discourse on the theme, 'How Preachers\r\n    Go Wrong.' Viewing the matter historically, as was his duty,\r\n    the Rev. Mr. Dinsmore found that the going wrong of a preacher\r\n    is by no means a modern innovation; for did not Micah, David,\r\n    Eli, and Abiathar prove false to the trust imposed in them? The\r\n    preacher blamed society for protecting the preacher in his sin,\r\n    and for not giving him away. But the first cause, he says, why\r\n    a preacher falls is that he is 'human,' and the devil works for\r\n    mastery over him as over other souls. And the second cause of the\r\n    preacher's fall, we are told, is the woman (nothing said about\r\n    her being also 'human'). The religious woman who has missed her\r\n    man finds him in Jesus and takes the parson as his deputy. The\r\n    women tempt the preacher also by the cut of their clothes, says the\r\n    Rev. Mr. Dinsmore. They wear and let their daughters wear gowns so\r\n    low in the neck and so short in the skirt that when a man looks at\r\n    them 'hell is stirred up' in his breast. And so on. Of course some\r\n    of it is true; the minister is exposed to temptation, but if he\r\n    cannot resist what the Infidel has to, what is his religion for?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light sentences, if any, imposed upon clergymen in many instances\r\nhaving been alluded to, we may allege a concrete case. It occurred\r\nat the time when a nation-wide attempt was being made to fasten the\r\ncrime of white slavery, with its penalties, on two laymen who had\r\ntaken two women with their consent into an adjoining state and there\r\ncohabited with them. The clerical case was as follows (we quote an\r\neditorial paragraph in \"The Truth Seeker\" for July 19, 1913):\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In the state of Michigan, town of St. Johns, in the middle of\r\n    last month, a Baptist clergyman, the Rev. J. T. Gregory, being\r\n    arraigned for the crime of rape committed upon a girl 11 years\r\n    old, pleaded guilty and was 'sentenced to serve from one to\r\n    ten years at the Ionia reformatory with a recommendation of two\r\n    years by Judge Searl.' What extreme penalty the law of Michigan\r\n    imposes for outraging an infant we do not know; the terms of\r\n    the sentence named in this case show it is at least ten years,\r\n    and here is a man of God getting off with a sentence of from one\r\n    up, and recommended by the court to be let loose again upon the\r\n    community in two years! The report of the case, printed in the\r\n    Grand Rapids 'Press,' is exasperating to any one who believes\r\n    that the law should be administered without favor. Every courtesy\r\n    was shown the clerical violator of childhood. 'The sentence,' we\r\n    read, 'was dealt out by a special arrangement with the judge,'\r\n    as court would not convene for a week, and the minister 'was\r\n    desirous of pleading guilty and beginning his term in prison as\r\n    soon as possible.' The judge carried his consideration for the\r\n    clerical rapist so far as to grant the latter's request 'for\r\n    a day to clear up his personal affairs.' All this favoritism,\r\n    as the reporter innocently puts it, because the Rev. Mr. Gregory\r\n    is 'highly respected as the pastor of the Baptist church.' That\r\n    is benefit of the clergy with the lid off! Now we would like to\r\n    inquire why there is no public excitement about this miscarriage of\r\n    justice. The man is married and has three daughters, two of them\r\n    school teachers, and one a high school graduate, and is hence a\r\n    middle-aged man who has not the excuse of youthful ardor for his\r\n    crime. The girls in the California case were old enough to marry or\r\n    to consent without marriage. The minister's victim is eleven years\r\n    old. If the laymen had money and political influence, which they\r\n    haven't, to protect them from prosecution on a charge of which\r\n    on the face of it they are not guilty, it still would not be as\r\n    base for them to avail themselves of that advantage as it is for\r\n    a court to consider the alleged 'holy calling' of a minister and\r\n    withhold adequate punishment for an atrocious crime he confesses\r\n    that he committed. Men possessed of a nature that permits them to\r\n    attack female children are among the most dangerous persons in\r\n    any community, because they only want the opportunity to repeat\r\n    the offense. The motive is always with them. The are like the\r\n    Chicago priest who saw a 'stimulation to lust' in Chabas' picture,\r\n    'September Morn.' No young girl is safe in the power or presence of\r\n    that kind of degenerates; and hence when one of them gets into the\r\n    clutches of the law he should be kept there as long as the statute\r\n    will permit. Had the Rev. Gregory been anything but a priest and\r\n    the court anything but a boneheaded truckler to hypocritical piety,\r\n    he would have got a determinate sentence of at least ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one year, recently, seventeen Chicago ministers were criminally or\r\ncivilly prosecuted. It is difficult to believe that this number of\r\noffenses does not raise the percentage of criminal preachers above\r\nthe average of all Chicago citizens. In six months of the same year\r\n(1912) Kokomo, Indiana, had four clerical scandals. We again quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Is there some sinister element in the atmosphere of Kokomo,\r\n    Indiana, inimical to clerical morals? After relating under\r\n    the heading 'Parson and Widow Out on a Little Lark,' how 'the\r\n    Rev. G. W. Alley, pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal church at\r\n    Royal Center and an active member in the North Indiana conference,\r\n    was arrested at a boarding house at Kokomo shortly before midnight\r\n    Tuesday night in company with Mrs. Wendling, a widow of Walton,\r\n    and both were hustled off to jail where they still remain,'\r\n    the Hartford City (Ind.) 'Times-Gazette' of August 6 remarks:\r\n    'This is the fourth scandal in Kokomo within the past six months in\r\n    which a preacher has been involved.' Surely there must be something\r\n    unfavorable to ministerial morals in the Kokomo atmosphere--some\r\n    such element as that affirmed by one of the infallible popes who,\r\n    finding himself and many of his priests disabled by a mysterious\r\n    malady, laid it to 'a certain malignity in the constitution\r\n    of the air.' The constitution of the air in Kokomo, Indiana,\r\n    is obviously malign and contraindicated for ministers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFour delinquents in six months is eight a year in a community of\r\n12,000 souls, the church-going portion of which could be adequately\r\nserved by a dozen ministers.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, if practicable, to compare the morality of\r\nthe American clergy with that of other countries, but the data are\r\nmeager. Here, however, is an informing paragraph retained from a\r\nprevious edition of this book:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In England, from October, 1891, to October, 1892, 12 ministers\r\n    committed suicide, 14 broke the marriage promise, 17 committed\r\n    various crimes, 18 misused animals, 109 violated women, 121 were\r\n    indicted for drunkenness (habitual), 254 cheated their creditors,\r\n    and 18 committed minor offenses. That is 2.75 per cent. of the\r\n    English ministry, says the 'Pall Mall Gazette,' who were in one\r\n    year in trouble with the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the revision of this work was undertaken, late in the fall of\r\n1914, the clergy have not ceased to furnish fresh material for its\r\npages, but as each additional name must cause a revision of totals,\r\nthe later cases, which perhaps number two dozen, must await the next\r\nround-up. The following table condenses the crimes, offenses, etc.,\r\nwith which the ministers have been charged:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abduction                                                  22\r\n    Abortion

Their denomination is given in 2,556 cases; unknown in 1,239.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the varying typographical arrangement of dates,\r\nnames, etc., and of faults of pagination, it may be said that the older\r\nportions of the book, covering cases occurring prior to 1899, have\r\nbeen left as they formerly stood, except that the periodical comments\r\nand recapitulations accompanying fresh editions have been eliminated,\r\nand the available matter thrown into the general introduction to the\r\nvolume. Cases that have occurred since the close of the list in the\r\nformer style of composition have been rearranged and reset in one\r\nalphabetical list. The book, then, contains six alphabetical lists,\r\nbeginning, in the first part, on page 10 (circa 1875-81); page 50 (to\r\n1883); page 102 (to 1893); page 125 (to 1895); page 140 (to 1898);\r\npage 139, Part II. (to 1914). The rearrangement condenses, without\r\nomitting anything of permanent value, a volume which was becoming\r\ntoo large to be economically produced and distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO EARLIER EDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as imagination creates a god to rule the destinies of men; so\r\nlong as ignorance can be made to believe that the preacher or priest\r\nis in some way a go-between, or agent, between men and the powers in\r\nthe clouds--that he is a \"sky-pilot,\" directly commissioned by deity\r\nto attend to God's affairs on earth, and that the priest's person\r\nand office are sacred--just so long will there be possible such a\r\nprofession as that of the modern priesthood.\r\n\r\nAnd if these preachers as a whole are just as criminal as any\r\nother class; if they are immoral without the excuse of want or\r\nignorance--without reason other than because of their often indolent\r\nlives and the opportunities afforded them by the nature of their\r\ncalling--then their followers cannot learn that fact too soon.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this book was printed in 1881, since which time\r\nmany thousands of copies have been scattered throughout the country;\r\nbut in no case to our knowledge has anyone successfully denied the\r\nfacts alleged against any \"man of God\" figuring in these pages. Its\r\nsubstantial accuracy is therefore assured. The only charge that\r\ncan be maintained against it is its incompleteness. The publishers\r\ndo not claim to have discovered more than a small percentage of\r\nclerical villainy. The churches endeavor to and do hide a great deal\r\nof the immorality of their ministers. The preachers, who govern the\r\necclesiastical tribunals, have a fellow feeling for one another. As\r\na general thing, it is only when the clergy are brought before the\r\nsecular courts that the public can learn the full facts. Comparatively\r\nfew Catholic priests figure in this record, for the reason that\r\nthat church is a close corporation which by political influence and\r\nby control of its members' tongues can conceal the crimes of its\r\nleaders. In all large cities of the country the Catholic church has a\r\nlarge and dangerous political influence, and its priests have every\r\nchance to go free of retribution for their vices and crimes. The\r\njudges are Catholics, or owe their positions to Catholic power; the\r\ncourt officers are Catholics; the policemen are Catholics. They all\r\nshield the \"fathers\" and withhold their names from publication.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, too, for the editor to read all the papers and\r\ngather all the cases which do see the light of publicity. And, we are\r\nsorry to say, some of the secular journals suppress the news. If the\r\ncountry could be scanned closely the indications are that a hundred\r\ntimes as many crimes could be found rightfully charged to the men who\r\nset themselves up as teachers of morals. For use in future editions\r\nwe therefore urge all who read these pages to send us such accounts\r\nof these cases as may come to their notice, giving facts, dates,\r\nand localities, and, if clippings from newspapers are sent, name,\r\ndate, and place of publication of paper.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected by apologists for the system of religion in vogue\r\nin this country that clerical delinquencies prove nothing against the\r\nsystem. In this they are mistaken. Of course, if Christianity had a\r\nfoundation of fact, these records would not prove that the fact is\r\nnot there. What they do prove, however, is that the claim made for\r\nChristianity, that it makes men moral, is not true. For if the system\r\nis not sufficient to restrain its very teachers, how can we expect\r\ntheir pupils to profit by it? The point this book emphasizes, as an\r\nex-Methodist minister, now a Rationalist, but always a moral man,\r\nforcibly puts it, is that religion in and of itself, is not a moral\r\nforce; that it is not one with morality; that it may, and often does,\r\nexist without morality, and that morality gains nothing by being\r\nassociated with it.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to their numbers, it is believed, more ministers than\r\nmembers of any other profession are guilty of crimes and vices. A\r\nlarge portion of the crimes are against women or with women. This,\r\nperhaps, is not strange when one considers the institution of pastoral\r\nvisits. While men are away from home attending to their duties in\r\nlife, the minister is roving about, pretendedly looking after the\r\nwelfare of his flock, but really making calls upon the women who most\r\nattract him. What the confessional is to the Roman Catholic church,\r\nsuch is the \"pastoral visit\" to the Protestant church. Women should not\r\nattend the one or receive the other except in the presence of their\r\nfathers or husbands. Another institution of the church could also\r\nbe done away with to the gain of morality--to wit, the lone studies\r\nfor the minister annexed to the churches. These furnished rooms are\r\nthe scenes of many debaucheries. With them, too, should go the side\r\ndoors or choir entrances. The side door and study of a church in\r\nSan Francisco were used for assignation purposes, which culminated\r\nin murder. A murdered woman was found at the confessional box of a\r\nRomish church in New York city. In Omaha a minister was found in the\r\npastor's room of his own church asphyxiated in close embrace with a\r\nwoman missionary. These side doors, secluded \"studies,\" and secret\r\nconfessional boxes are dangerous to virtue if not to life. Many a\r\nwoman and girl passes through them to her downfall.\r\n\r\nIn this short history of ministerial conduct, lack of complete identity\r\nis sometimes unavoidable, for in the reports of these trials in the\r\nsecular journals it has been customary to drop the first names of the\r\ndefendant, and many a pious villain is recorded as \"Rev. Mr. Smith,\"\r\nor \"Rev. Mr. Jones.\" In some cases the place is not fully given where\r\nthe crime was committed. Again, in certain instances, the offense\r\nreceives the laconic name, applied by the ecclesiastical court which\r\ntried the criminal, as \"immoral conduct,\" \"lascivious conduct,\" etc.;\r\ndefinitions that hide the grossness of the offense, and so screen\r\nthe reverend culprit in the interest of the church and the cloth. In\r\nmany reports of trials by ecclesiastical gatherings the name of the\r\naccused is entirely suppressed, as is supposed, out of respect for his\r\n\"sacred calling.\"\r\n\r\nThe denomination to which the \"pious soul\" belonged, is not always\r\ngiven, consequently this record will not do to rely upon to enable\r\nthe reader to ascertain what branch of \"the church of God\" has shown\r\nthe most efficiency in pastoral criminality.\r\n\r\nLetters will be found placed after a name, as P.E., for presiding\r\nelder, Ev. for Evangelist; for instance: Carhart, Rev. J. W., P.E.,\r\nand Bayliss, Rev. E. L., Ev. The D.D., PhD., LLD., and other addenda\r\npurchased of colleges and theological seminaries have not been\r\npreserved with any great care. If any reverend offender who has\r\nbeen overlooked, and so left out of this \"illustrious category,\"\r\ndesires the distinction of having his name and title made famous,\r\nhe will please forward the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEN PARSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(The following adaptation of a familiar rhyme has appeared in all\r\neditions of this book and might be missed if omitted.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ten little preachers, preaching love divine,\r\n    One kissed the servant girl, then there were nine.\r\n\r\n    Nine little preachers, preaching sinners' fate,\r\n    One took too much drink, then there were eight.\r\n\r\n    Eight little preachers, showing path to heaven,\r\n    One betrayed a brother's wife, then there were seven.\r\n\r\n    Seven little preachers, barring Satan's tricks,\r\n    One of them beat his wife, then there were six.\r\n\r\n    Six little preachers, preaching Christ alive,\r\n    One enticed a little girl, then there were five.\r\n\r\n    Five little preachers, preaching \"Sin no more,\"\r\n    One committed an assault, then there were four.\r\n\r\n    Four little preachers, pure as they could be,\r\n    One deflowered an eight-year-old, then there were three.\r\n\r\n    Three little preachers--pity they're so few--\r\n    One killed his paramour, then there were two.\r\n\r\n    Two little preachers, to glorify the Son,\r\n    One whipped his child to death, then there was one.\r\n\r\n    One little preacher, in the fold alone,\r\n    He committed suicide, then there was none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDATE.
