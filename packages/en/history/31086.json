I also wish to\r\n    congratulate you on the honor which the French government has\r\n    done you in giving you the Croix de Guerre, which is but a just\r\n    reward for the consistent devotion to your duty and personal\r\n    bravery that you have exhibited.\r\n\r\n        My personal regrets that you are leaving us at this time are\r\n    lessened by the knowledge of the great opportunity you will have\r\n    of giving to our people in America a true picture of the work of\r\n    the American soldier in France and of impressing on them the\r\n    necessity of carrying on this work to the end, which can be\r\n    accomplished only by victory for the Allied arms. You have a\r\n    great opportunity, and I am confident that you will grasp it, as\r\n    you have grasped your past opportunities, with success. You have\r\n    always played the game squarely and with courage, and I wish to\r\n    thank you.\r\n\r\n                 Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                            John J.

General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American\r\nExpeditionary Forces, has said that it was Gibbons' great opportunity to\r\ngive the people in America a life-like picture of the work of the\r\nAmerican soldier in France.\r\n\r\nThe key to the book is the man.\r\n\r\nBack in the red days on the Rio Grande, word came from Pancho Villa that\r\nany \"Gringos\" found in Mexico would be killed on sight. The American\r\npeople were interested in the Revolution at the border. Gibbons went\r\ninto the Mexican hills alone and called Villa's bluff. He did more. He\r\nfitted out a box car, attached it to the revolutionary bandits' train\r\nand was in the thick of three of Villa's biggest battles. Gibbons\r\nbrought out of Mexico the first authoritative information on the Mexican\r\nsituation. The following year the War Department accredited him to\r\nGeneral Pershing's punitive expedition and he rode with the flying\r\ncolumn led by General Pershing when it crossed the border.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, the then Imperial German Government announced to the world that\r\non and after February 1st its submarines would sink without warning any\r\nship that ventured to enter a zone it had drawn in the waters of the\r\nNorth Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGibbons sensed the meaning of this impudent challenge. He saw ahead the\r\novert act that was bound to come and be the cause of the United States\r\nentering the war. In these days the cry of \"Preparedness\" was echoing\r\nthe land. England had paid dearly for her lack of preparedness. The\r\ninefficient volunteer system had cost her priceless blood. The _Chicago\r\nTribune_ sought the most available newspaper man to send to London and\r\nwrite the story of England's costly mistakes for the profit of the\r\nAmerican people. Gibbons was picked for the mission and arrangement was\r\nmade for him to travel on the steamer by which the discredited Von\r\nBernstorff was to return to Germany. The ship's safe conduct was\r\nguaranteed. Gibbons did not like this feature of the trip. He wanted to\r\nride the seas in a ship without guarantees. His mind was on the overt\r\nact. He wanted to be on the job when it happened. He cancelled the\r\npassage provided for him on the Von Bernstorff ship and took passage on\r\nthe largest liner in port, a ship large enough to be readily seen\r\nthrough a submarine periscope and important enough to attract the\r\nspecial attention of the German Admiralty. He sailed on the _Laconia_,\r\nan eighteen thousand ton Cunarder.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 27, 1917, when the _Laconia_ was two hundred\r\nmiles off the coast of Ireland, the Gibbons' \"hunch\" was fulfilled. The\r\n_Laconia_ was torpedoed and suck. After a perilous night in a small boat\r\non the open sea, Gibbons was rescued and brought into Queenstown. He\r\nopened the cables and flashed to America the most powerful call to arms\r\nto the American people. It shook the country. It was the testimony of an\r\neye witness and it convinced the Imperial German Government, beyond all\r\nreasonable doubt, of the wilful and malicious murder of American\r\ncitizens. The Gibbons story furnished the proof of the overt act and it\r\nwas unofficially admitted at Washington that it was the determining\r\nfactor in sending America into the war one month later.\r\n\r\nGibbons greeted Pershing on the latter's landing in Liverpool. He\r\naccompanied the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces across\r\nthe Channel and was at his side when he put foot on French soil. He was\r\none of the two American correspondents to march with the first American\r\ntroops that entered the trenches on the Western front. He was with the\r\nfirst American troops to cross the German frontier. He was with the\r\nartillery battalion that fired the first American shell into Germany.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, 1918, Gibbons went \"over the top\" with the first waves in\r\nthe great battle of the Bois de Belleau. Gibbons was with Major John\r\nBerry, who, while leading the charge, fell wounded. Gibbons saw him\r\nfall. Through the hail of lead from a thousand spitting machine guns, he\r\nrushed to the assistance of the wounded Major. A German machine gun\r\nbullet shot away part of his left shoulder, but this did not stop\r\nGibbons. Another bullet smashed through his arm, but still Gibbons kept\r\non. A third bullet got him. It tore out his left eye and made a compound\r\nfracture of the skull. For three hours he lay conscious on the open\r\nfield in the Bois de Belleau with a murderous machine gun fire playing a\r\nfew inches over his head until under cover of darkness he was able to\r\ncrawl off the field. For his gallant conduct he received a citation from\r\nGeneral Petain, Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies, and the French\r\nGovernment awarded him the Croix de Guerre with the Palm.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, he was out of the hospital and back at the front, covering\r\nthe first advance of the Americans with the British forces before\r\nAmiens. On July 18th he was the only correspondent with the American\r\ntroops when they executed the history-making drive against the German\r\narmies in the Château-Thierry salient--the beginning of the German end.\r\nHe rode with the first detachment of American troops that entered\r\nChâteau-Thierry upon the heels of the retreating Germans.\r\n\r\nFloyd Gibbons was the first to sound the alarm of the danger of the\r\nGerman peace offensive. Six weeks before the drive for a negotiated\r\npeace was made by the German Government against the home flank in\r\nAmerica, Gibbons told that it was on the way. He crossed the Atlantic\r\nwith his crippled arm in a sling and his head bandaged, to spend his\r\nconvalescence warning American audiences against what he called the\r\n\"Crooked Kamerad Cry.\"\r\n\r\nGibbons has lived the war, he has been a part of it. \"And They Thought\r\nWe Wouldn't Fight\" is the voice of our men in France.\r\n\r\n                                                  FRANK COMERFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n    I THE SINKING OF THE _Laconia_                                  17\r\n\r\n    II PERSHING'S ARRIVAL IN EUROPE                                 43\r\n\r\n    III THE LANDING OF THE FIRST AMERICAN CONTINGENT IN FRANCE      61\r\n\r\n    IV THROUGH THE SCHOOL OF WAR                                    78\r\n\r\n    V MAKING THE MEN WHO MAN THE GUNS                               96\r\n\r\n    VI \"FRONTWARD HO!\"                                             117\r\n\r\n    VII INTO THE LINE--THE FIRST AMERICAN SHOT IN THE WAR          134\r\n\r\n    VIII THE FIRST AMERICAN SECTOR                                 158\r\n\r\n    IX THE NIGHT OUR GUNS CUT LOOSE                                182\r\n\r\n    X INTO PICARDY TO MEET THE GERMAN PUSH                         199\r\n\r\n    XI UNDER FIRE                                                  217\r\n\r\n    XII BEFORE CANTIGNY                                            235\r\n\r\n    XIII THE RUSH OF THE RAIDERS--\"ZERO AT 2 A.

Every American soldier, before encountering\r\nthe dangers of the battle-front, must first overcome the dangers of the\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nGeographically, America is almost four thousand miles from the war zone,\r\nbut in fact every American soldier bound for France entered the war zone\r\none hour out of New York harbour. Germany made an Ally out of the dark\r\ndepths of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThat three-thousand-mile passage represented greater possibilities for\r\nthe destruction of the United States overseas forces than any\r\nstrategical operation that Germany's able military leaders could direct\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nGermany made use of that three thousand miles of water, just as she\r\ndeveloped the use of barbed wire entanglements along the front. Infantry\r\nadvancing across No Man's Land were held helpless before the enemy's\r\nfire by barbed wire entanglements. Germany, with her submarine policy of\r\nruthlessness, changed the Atlantic Ocean into another No Man's Land\r\nacross which every American soldier had to pass at the mercy of the\r\nenemy before he could arrive at the actual battle-front.\r\n\r\nThis was the peril of the troop ship. This was the tremendous advantage\r\nwhich the enemy held over our armies even before they reached the field.\r\nThis was the unprecedented condition which the United States and Allied\r\nnavies had to cope with in the great undertaking of transporting our\r\nforces overseas.\r\n\r\nAny one who has crossed the ocean, even in the normal times before\r\nshark-like Kultur skulked beneath the water, has experienced the feeling\r\nof human helplessness that comes in mid-ocean when one considers the\r\ncomparative frailty of such man-made devices as even the most modern\r\nturbine liners, with the enormous power of the wilderness of water over\r\nwhich one sails.\r\n\r\nIn such times one realises that safety rests, first upon the kindliness\r\nof the elements; secondly, upon the skill and watchfulness of those\r\ndirecting the voyage, and thirdly, upon the dependability of such\r\nhuman-made things as engines, propellers, steel plates, bolts and\r\nrivets.\r\n\r\nBut add to the possibilities of a failure or a misalliance of any or all\r\nof the above functions, the greater danger of a diabolical human, yet\r\ninhuman, interference, directed against the seafarer with the purpose\r\nand intention of his destruction. This last represents the greatest odds\r\nagainst those who go to sea during the years of the great war.\r\n\r\nA sinking at sea is a nightmare. I have been through one. I have been on\r\na ship torpedoed in mid-ocean. I have stood on the slanting decks of a\r\ndoomed liner; I have listened to the lowering of the life-boats, heard\r\nthe hiss of escaping steam and the roar of ascending rockets as they\r\ntore lurid rents in the black sky and cast their red glare o'er the\r\nroaring sea.\r\n\r\nI have spent a night in an open boat on the tossing swells. I have been\r\nthrough, in reality, the mad dream of drifting and darkness and bailing\r\nand pulling on the oars and straining aching eyes toward an empty,\r\nmeaningless horizon in search of help. I shall try to tell you how it\r\nfeels.\r\n\r\nI had been assigned by _The Chicago Tribune_ to go to London as their\r\ncorrespondent. Almost the same day I received that assignment, the\r\n\"Imperial\" Government of Germany had invoked its ruthless submarine\r\npolicy, had drawn a blockade zone about the waters of the British Isles\r\nand the coasts of France, and had announced to the world that its\r\nU-boats would sink without warning any ship, of any kind, under any\r\nflag, that tried to sail the waters that Germany declared prohibitory.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of my personal safety and, possibly, of my future\r\nusefulness, the _Tribune_ was desirous of arranging for me a safe\r\npassage across the Atlantic. Such an opportunity presented itself in the\r\nordered return of the disgraced and discredited German Ambassador to the\r\nUnited States, Count von Bernstorff.\r\n\r\nUnder the rules of International courtesy, a ship had been provided for\r\nthe use of von Bernstorff and his diplomatic staff. That ship was to\r\nsail under absolute guarantees of safe conduct from all of the nations\r\nat war with Germany and, of course, it would also have been safe from\r\nattack by German submarines. That ship was the _Frederick VIII_. At\r\nconsiderable expense the _Tribune_ managed to obtain for me a cabin\r\npassage on that ship.\r\n\r\nI can't say that I was over-impressed with the prospect of travel in\r\nsuch company. I disliked the thought that I, an American citizen, with\r\nrights as such to sail the sea, should have to resort to subterfuge and\r\nscheming to enjoy those rights. There arose in me a feeling of challenge\r\nagainst Germany's order which forbade American ships to sail the ocean.\r\nI cancelled my sailing on the _Frederick VIII_.\r\n\r\nIn New York, I sought passage on the first American ship sailing for\r\nEngland. I made the rounds of the steamship offices and learned that the\r\nCunard liner _Laconia_ was the first available boat and was about to\r\nsail. She carried a large cargo of munitions and other materials of war.\r\nI booked passage aboard her. It was on Saturday, February 17th, 1917,\r\nthat we steamed away from the dock at New York and moved slowly down the\r\nEast River. We were bound for Liverpool, England. My cabin accommodations\r\nwere good. The _Laconia_ was listed at 18,000 tons and was one of the\r\nlargest Cunarders in the Atlantic service. The next morning we were out\r\nof sight of land.\r\n\r\nSailors were stationed along the decks of the ship and in the look-outs\r\nat the mast heads. They maintained a watch over the surface of the sea\r\nin all directions. On the stern of the ship, there was mounted a\r\nsix-inch cannon and a crew of gunners stood by it night and day.\r\n\r\nSubmarines had been recently reported in the waters through which we\r\nwere sailing, but we saw none of them and apparently they saw none of\r\nus. They had sunk many ships, but all of the sinkings had been in the\r\nday time. Consequently, there was a feeling of greater safety at night.\r\nThe _Laconia_ sailed on a constantly zig-zagging course. All of our\r\nlife-boats were swinging out over the side of the ship, so that if we\r\nwere hit they could be lowered in a hurry. Every other day the\r\npassengers and the crew would be called up on the decks to stand by the\r\nlife-boats that had been assigned to them.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the ship instructed us in the life-boat drill. They\r\nshowed us how to strap the life-preservers about our bodies; they showed\r\nus how to seat ourselves in the life-boats; they showed us a small keg\r\nof water and some tin cans of biscuits, a lantern and some flares that\r\nwere stored in the boat, and so we sailed along day after day without\r\nmeeting any danger. At night, all of the lights were put out and the\r\nship slipped along through the darkness.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, after we had been sailing for eight days, we entered the zone\r\nthat had been prohibited by the Kaiser. We sailed into it full steam\r\nahead and nothing happened. That day was February the twenty-fifth. In\r\nthe afternoon, I was seated in the lounge with two friends. One was an\r\nAmerican whose name was Kirby; the other was a Canadian and his name was\r\nDugan. The latter was an aviator in the British army. In fights with\r\nGerman aeroplanes high over the Western Front he had been wounded and\r\nbrought down twice and the army had sent him to his home in Canada to\r\nget well. He was returning once more to the battle front \"to stop\r\nanother bullet,\" as he said.\r\n\r\nAs we talked, I passed around my cigarette case and Dugan held a lighted\r\nmatch while the three of us lighted our cigarettes from it. As Dugan\r\nblew out the match and placed the burnt end in an ash tray, he laughed\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n\"They say it is bad luck to light three cigarettes with the same match,\r\nbut I think it is good luck for me. I used to do it frequently with my\r\nflying partners in France and four of them have been killed, but I am\r\nstill alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes it all right for you,\" said Kirby, \"but it makes it look bad\r\nfor Gibbons and myself. But nothing is going to happen. I don't believe\r\nin superstitions.\"\r\n\r\nThat night after dinner Dugan and I took a brisk walk around the\r\ndarkened promenade deck of the _Laconia_. The night was very dark, a\r\nstiff wind was blowing and the _Laconia_ was rolling slightly in the\r\ntrough of the waves. Wet from spray, we returned within and in one of\r\nthe corridors met the Captain of the ship. I told him that I would like\r\nvery much to have a look at his chart and learn our exact location on\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and laughed because that was a very secret matter. But\r\nhe replied:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you would, would you?\" and his voice carried that particular\r\nBritish intonation that seemed to say, \"Well it is jolly well none of\r\nyour business.\"\r\n\r\nThen I asked him when he thought we would land in Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know,\" said the ship's commander, and then, with a wink,\r\nhe added, \"but my steward told me that we would get in Tuesday evening.\"\r\n\r\nKirby and I went to the smoke room on the boat deck well to the stern of\r\nthe ship. We joined a circle of Britishers who were seated in front of a\r\ncoal fire in an open hearth. Nearly every one in the lighted smoke room\r\nwas playing cards, so that the conversation was practically confined to\r\nthe mentioning of bids and the orders of drinks from the stewards.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think are our chances of being torpedoed?\" was the question\r\nI put before the circle in front of the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThe deliberative Mr. Henry Chetham, a London solicitor, was the first to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he drawled, \"I should say about four thousand to one.\"\r\n\r\nLucien J. Jerome of the British Diplomatic Service, returning with an\r\nEcuadorian valet from South America, advanced his opinion.\r\n\r\nI was much impressed with his opinion because the speaker himself had\r\nimpressed me deeply. He was the best monocle juggler I had ever met. In\r\nhis right eye he carried a monocle without a rim and without a ribbon\r\nor thread to save it, should it ever have fallen from his eye.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly during the trip, I had seen Mr. Jerome standing on the\r\nhurrideck of the _Laconia_ facing the wind but holding the glass disk in\r\nhis eye with a muscular grip that must have been vise-like. I had even\r\nfollowed him around the deck several times in a desire to be present\r\nwhen the monocle blew out, but the British diplomatist never for once\r\nlost his grip on it. I had come to the opinion that the piece of glass\r\nwas fixed to his eye and that he slept with it. After the fashion of the\r\nBritish Diplomatic Service, he expressed his opinion most affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he said with reference to Mr. Chetham's estimate. \"Utter\r\nnonsense. Considering the zone that we are in and the class of the ship,\r\nI should put the chances down at two hundred and fifty to one that we\r\ndon't meet a 'sub.'\"\r\n\r\nAt that minute the torpedo hit us.\r\n\r\nHave you ever stood on the deck of a ferry boat as it arrived in the\r\nslip? And have you ever experienced the slight sideward shove when the\r\nboat rubs against the piling and comes to a stop? That was the\r\nunmistakable lurch we felt, but no one expects to run into pilings in\r\nmid-ocean, so every one knew what it was.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there came a muffled noise--not extremely loud nor yet\r\nvery sharp--just a noise like the slamming of some large oaken door a\r\ngood distance away. Realising that we had been torpedoed, my imagination\r\nwas rather disappointed at the slightness of the shock and the meekness\r\nof the report. One or two chairs tipped over, a few glasses crashed from\r\ntable to floor and in an instant every man in the room was on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"We're hit,\" shouted Mr. Chetham.\r\n\r\n\"That's what we've been waiting for,\" said Mr. Jerome.\r\n\r\n\"What a lousy torpedo!\" said Mr. Kirby. \"It must have been a fizzer.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch; it was 10:30.\r\n\r\nFive sharp blasts sounded on the _Laconia's_ whistle. Since that night,\r\nI have often marvelled at the quick coordination of mind and hand that\r\nbelonged to the man on the bridge who pulled that whistle rope. Those\r\nfive blasts constituted the signal to abandon the ship. Every one\r\nrecognised them.\r\n\r\nWe walked hurriedly down the corridor leading from the smoke room in the\r\nstern to the lounge which was amidships. We moved fast but there was no\r\ncrowding and no panic. Passing the open door of the gymnasium, I became\r\naware of the list of the vessel. The floor of the gymnasium slanted down\r\non the starboard side and a medicine ball and dozens of dumb bells and\r\nIndian clubs were rolling in that direction.\r\n\r\nWe entered the lounge--a large drawing room furnished with green\r\nupholstered chairs and divans and small tables on which the after-dinner\r\nliqueur glasses still rested. In one corner was a grand piano with the\r\ntop elevated. In the centre of the slanting floor of the saloon was a\r\ncabinet Victrola and from its mahogany bowels there poured the last and\r\ndying strains of \"Poor Butterfly.\"\r\n\r\nThe women and several men who had been in the lounge were hurriedly\r\nleaving by the forward door as we entered. We followed them through. The\r\ntwin winding stairs leading below decks by the forward hatch were dark\r\nand I brought into play a pocket flashlight shaped like a fountain pen.\r\nI had purchased it before sailing in view of such an emergency and I\r\nhad always carried it fastened with a clip in an upper vest pocket.\r\n\r\nMy stateroom was B 19 on the promenade deck, one deck below the deck on\r\nwhich was located the smoke room, the lounge and the life-boats. The\r\ncorridor was dimly lighted and the floor had a more perceptible slant as\r\nI darted into my stateroom, which was on the starboard and sinking side\r\nof the ship. I hurriedly put on a light non-sink garment constructed\r\nlike a vest, which I had come provided with, and then donned an\r\novercoat.\r\n\r\nResponding to the list of the ship, the wardrobe door swung open and\r\ncrashed against the wall. My typewriter slid off the dressing table and\r\na shower of toilet articles pitched from their places on the washstand.\r\nI grabbed the ship's life-preserver in my left hand and, with the\r\nflashlight in my right hand, started up the hatchway to the upper deck.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the boat deck hatchway, the rays of my flashlight\r\nrevealed the chief steward opening the door of a switch closet in the\r\npanel wall. He pushed on a number of switches and instantly the decks of\r\nthe _Laconia_ became bright. From sudden darkness, the exterior of the\r\nship burst into a blaze of light and it was that illumination that saved\r\nmany lives.\r\n\r\nThe _Laconia's_ engines and dynamos had not yet been damaged. The\r\ntorpedo had hit us well astern on the starboard side and the bulkheads\r\nseemed to be holding back from the engine room the flood of water that\r\nrushed in through the gaping hole in the ship's side. I proceeded down\r\nthe boat deck to my station opposite boat No. 10. I looked over the side\r\nand down upon the water sixty feet below.\r\n\r\nThe sudden flashing of the lights on the upper deck made the dark\r\nseething waters seem blacker and angrier. They rose and fell in troubled\r\nswells.\r\n\r\nSteam began to hiss from some of the pipes leading up from the engine\r\nwell. It seemed like a dying groan from the very vitals of the stricken\r\nship. Clouds of white and black smoke rolled up from the giant grey\r\nfunnels that towered above us.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a roaring swish as a rocket soared upward from the\r\nCaptain's bridge, leaving a comet's tail of fire. I watched it as it\r\ndescribed a graceful arc and then with an audible pop it burst in a\r\nflare of brilliant colour. Its ascent had torn a lurid rent in the black\r\nsky and had cast a red glare over the roaring sea.\r\n\r\nAlready boat No. 10 was loading up and men and boys were busy with the\r\nropes. I started to help near a davit that seemed to be giving trouble\r\nbut was sternly ordered to get out of the way and to get into the boat.\r\n\r\nOther passengers and members of the crew and officers of the ship were\r\nrushing to and fro along the deck strapping their life-preservers to\r\nthem as they rushed. There was some shouting of orders but little or no\r\nconfusion. One woman, a blonde French actress, became hysterical on the\r\ndeck, but two men lifted her bodily off her feet and placed her in the\r\nlife-boat.\r\n\r\nWe were on the port side of the ship, the higher side. To reach the\r\nboats, we had to climb up the slanting deck to the edge of the ship.\r\n\r\nOn the starboard side, it was different. On that side, the decks slanted\r\ndown toward the water. The ship careened in that direction and the\r\nlife-boats suspended from the davits swung clear of the ship's side.\r\n\r\nThe list of the ship increased. On the port side, we looked down the\r\nslanting side of the ship and noticed that her water line on that side\r\nwas a number of feet above the waves. The slant was so pronounced that\r\nthe life-boats, instead of swinging clear from the davits, rested\r\nagainst the side of the ship. From my position in the life-boat I could\r\nsee that we were going to have difficulty in the descent to the water.\r\n\r\n\"Lower away,\" some one gave the order and we started downward with a\r\njerk toward the seemingly hungry, rising and falling swells. Then we\r\nstopped with another jerk and remained suspended in mid-air while the\r\nmen at the bow and the stern swore and tusseled with the ropes.\r\n\r\nThe stern of the boat was down; the bow up, leaving us at an angle of\r\nabout forty-five degrees. We clung to the seats to save ourselves from\r\nfalling out.\r\n\r\n\"Who's got a knife? A knife! A knife!\" shouted a fireman in the bow. He\r\nwas bare to the waist and perspiration stood out in drops on his face\r\nand chest and made streaks through the coal dust with which his skin was\r\ngrimed.\r\n\r\n\"Great Gawd! Give him a knife,\" bawled a half-dressed jibbering negro\r\nstoker who wrung his hands in the stern.\r\n\r\nA hatchet was thrust into my hands and I forwarded it to the bow. There\r\nwas a flash of sparks as it was brought down with a clang on the holding\r\npulley. One strand of the rope parted.\r\n\r\nDown plunged the bow of the boat too quickly for the men in the stern.\r\nWe came to a jerky stop, this time with the stern in the air and the bow\r\ndown, the dangerous angle reversed.\r\n\r\nOne man in the stern let the rope race through his blistered fingers.\r\nWith hands burnt to the quick, he grabbed the rope and stopped the\r\nprecipitous descent just in time to bring the stern level with the bow.\r\n\r\nThen bow and stern tried to lower away together. The slant of the ship's\r\nside had increased, so that our boat instead of sliding down it like a\r\ntoboggan was held up on one side when the taffrail caught on one of the\r\ncondenser exhaust pipes projecting slightly from the ship's side.\r\n\r\nThus the starboard side of the life-boat stuck fast and high while the\r\nport side dropped down and once more we found ourselves clinging on at a\r\nnew angle and looking straight down into the water.\r\n\r\nA hand slipped into mine and a voice sounded huskily close to my ear. It\r\nwas the little old Jewish travelling man who was disliked in the smoke\r\nroom because he used to speak too certainly of things about which he was\r\nuncertain. His slightly Teutonic dialect had made him as popular as the\r\nsmallpox with the British passengers.\r\n\r\n\"My poy, I can't see nutting,\" he said. \"My glasses slipped and I am\r\nfalling. Hold me, please.\"\r\n\r\nI managed to reach out and join hands with another man on the other side\r\nof the old man and together we held him in. He hung heavily over our\r\narms, grotesquely grasping all he had saved from his stateroom--a\r\ngold-headed cane and an extra hat.\r\n\r\nMany feet and hands pushed the boat from the side of the ship and we\r\nrenewed our sagging, scraping, sliding, jerking descent. It ended as the\r\nbottom of the life-boat smacked squarely on the pillowy top of a rising\r\nswell. It felt more solid than mid-air at least.\r\n\r\nBut we were far from being off. The pulleys twice stuck in their\r\nfastings, bow and stern, and the one axe was passed forward and back\r\n(and with it my flashlight) as the entangling mesh of ropes that held\r\nus to the sinking _Laconia_ was cut away.\r\n\r\nSome shout from that confusion of sound caused me to look up. I believe\r\nI really did so in the fear that one of the nearby boats was being\r\nlowered upon us.\r\n\r\nTin funnels enamelled white and containing clusters of electric bulbs\r\nhung over the side from one of the upper decks. I looked up into the\r\ncone of one of these lights and a bulky object shot suddenly out of the\r\ndarkness into the scope of the electric rays.\r\n\r\nIt was a man. His arms were bent up at the elbows; his legs at the\r\nknees. He was jumping, with the intention, I feared, of landing in our\r\nboat, and I prepared to avoid the impact. But he had judged his distance\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHe plunged beyond us and into the water three feet from the edge of the\r\nboat. He sank from sight, leaving a white patch of bubbles and foam on\r\nthe black water. He bobbed to the surface almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\"It's Dugan,\" shouted a man next to me.\r\n\r\nI flashed a light on the ruddy, smiling face and water plastered hair of\r\nthe little Canadian aviator, our fellow saloon passenger. We pulled him\r\nover the side and into the boat. He spluttered out a mouthful of water.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if there is anything to that lighting three matches off the\r\nsame match,\" he said. \"I was trying to loosen the bow rope in this boat.\r\nI loosened it and then got tangled up in it. When the boat descended, I\r\nwas jerked up back on the deck. Then I jumped for it. Holy Moses, but\r\nthis water is cold.\"\r\n\r\nAs we pulled away from the side of the ship, its receding terraces of\r\nglowing port holes and deck lights towered above us. The ship was slowly\r\nturning over.\r\n\r\nWe were directly opposite the engine room section of the _Laconia_.\r\nThere was a tangle of oars, spars and rigging on the seats in our boat,\r\nand considerable confusion resulted before we could manage to place in\r\noperation some of the big oars on either side.\r\n\r\nThe jibbering, bullet-headed negro was pulling a sweep directly behind\r\nme and I turned to quiet him as his frantic reaches with the oar were\r\njabbing me in the back.\r\n\r\nIn the dull light from the upper decks, I looked into his slanting\r\nface--his eyes all whites and his lips moving convulsively. He shivered\r\nwith fright, but in addition to that he was freezing in the thin cotton\r\nshirt that composed his entire upper covering. He worked feverishly at\r\nthe oar to warm himself.\r\n\r\n\"Get away from her. My Gawd, get away from her,\" he kept repeating.\r\n\"When the water hits her hot boilers she'll blow up the whole ocean and\r\nthere's just tons and tons of shrapnel in her hold.\"\r\n\r\nHis excitement spread to other members of the crew in our boat. The\r\nship's baker, designated by his pantry headgear of white linen, became a\r\ncompeting alarmist and a white fireman, whose blasphemy was nothing\r\nshort of profound, added to the confusion by cursing every one.\r\n\r\nIt was the tension of the minute--it was the give way of overwrought\r\nnerves--it was bedlam and nightmare.\r\n\r\nI sought to establish some authority in our boat which was about to\r\nbreak out into full mutiny. I made my way to the stern. There, huddled\r\nup in a great overcoat and almost muffled in a ship's life-preserver, I\r\ncame upon an old white-haired man and I remembered him.\r\n\r\nHe was a sea-captain of the old sailing days. He had been a second cabin\r\npassenger with whom I had talked before. Earlier in the year he had\r\nsailed out of Nova Scotia with a cargo of codfish. His schooner, the\r\n_Secret_, had broken in two in mid-ocean, but he and his crew had been\r\npicked up by a tramp and taken back to New York.\r\n\r\nFrom there he had sailed on another ship bound for Europe, but this\r\nship, a Holland-American Liner, the _Ryndam_, had never reached the\r\nother side. In mid-Atlantic her captain had lost courage over the U-boat\r\nthreats. He had turned the ship about and returned to America. Thus, the\r\n_Laconia_ represented the third unsuccessful attempt of this grey-haired\r\nmariner to get back to his home in England. His name was Captain Dear.\r\n\r\n\"Our boat's rudder is gone, but we can stear with an oar,\" he said, in a\r\nweak-quavering voice--the thin high-pitched treble of age. \"I will take\r\ncharge, if you want me to, but my voice is gone. I can tell you what to\r\ndo, but you will have to shout the orders. They won't listen to me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was only one way to get the attention of the crew, and that was by\r\nan overpowering blast of profanity. I called to my assistance every\r\near-splitting, soul-sizzling oath that I could think of.\r\n\r\nI recited the lurid litany of the army mule skinner to his gentle\r\ncharges and embellished it with excerpts from the remarks of a Chicago\r\ntaxi chauffeur while he changed tires on the road with the temperature\r\nten below.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be an effective combination, this brim-stoned oration of\r\nmine, because it was rewarded by silence.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a ship's officer in this boat?\" I shouted. There was no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a sailor or a seaman on board?\" I inquired, and again there\r\nwas silence from our group of passengers, firemen, stokers and deck\r\nswabs.\r\n\r\nThey appeared to be listening to me and I wished to keep my hold on\r\nthem. I racked my mind for some other query to make or some order to\r\ndirect. Before the spell was broken I found one.\r\n\r\n\"We will now find out how many of us there are in this boat,\" I\r\nannounced in the best tones of authority that I could assume. \"The first\r\nman in the bow will count one and the next man to him will count two. We\r\nwill count from the bow back to the stern, each man taking a number.\r\nBegin.\"\r\n\r\n\"One,\" came the quick response from a passenger who happened to be the\r\nfirst man in the bow. The enumeration continued sharply toward the\r\nstern. I spoke the last number.\r\n\r\n\"There are twenty-three of us here,\" I repeated, \"there's not a ship's\r\nofficer or seaman among us, but we are extremely fortunate to have with\r\nus an old sea-captain who has consented to take charge of the boat and\r\nsave our lives. His voice is weak, but I will repeat the orders for him,\r\nso that all of you can hear. Are you ready to obey his orders?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an almost unanimous acknowledgment of assent and order was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to be done,\" I announced upon Captain Dear's\r\ninstructions, \"is to get the same number of oars pulling on each side of\r\nthe boat; to seat ourselves so as to keep on an even keel and then to\r\nkeep the boat's head up into the wind so that we won't be swamped by the\r\nwaves.\"\r\n\r\nWith some little difficulty, this rearrangement was accomplished and\r\nthen we rested on our oars with all eyes turned on the still lighted\r\n_Laconia_. The torpedo had hit at about 10:30 P. M. according to our\r\nship's time. Though listing far over on one side, the _Laconia_ was\r\nstill afloat.\r\n\r\nIt must have been twenty minutes after that first shot that we heard\r\nanother dull thud, which was accompanied by a noticeable drop in the\r\nhulk. The German submarine had despatched a second torpedo through the\r\nengine room and the boat's vitals from a distance of two hundred yards.\r\n\r\nWe watched silently during the next minute as the tiers of lights dimmed\r\nslowly from white to yellow, then to red and then nothing was left but\r\nthe murky mourning of the night which hung over all like a pall.\r\n\r\nA mean, cheese-coloured crescent of a moon revealed one horn above a rag\r\nbundle of clouds low in the distance. A rim of blackness settled around\r\nour little world, relieved only by a few leering stars in the zenith,\r\nand, where the _Laconia's_ lights had shown, there remained only the dim\r\noutlines of a blacker hulk standing out above the water like a jagged\r\nheadland, silhouetted against the overcast sky.\r\n\r\nThe ship sank rapidly at the stern until at last its nose rose out of\r\nthe water, and stood straight up in the air. Then it slid silently down\r\nand out of sight like a piece of scenery in a panorama spectacle.\r\n\r\nBoat No. 3 stood closest to the place where the ship had gone down. As a\r\nresult of the after suction, the small life-boat rocked about in a\r\nperilous sea of clashing spars and wreckage.\r\n\r\nAs the boat's crew steadied its head into the wind, a black hulk,\r\nglistening wet and standing about eight feet above the surface of the\r\nwater, approached slowly. It came to a stop opposite the boat and not\r\nten feet from the side of it. It was the submarine.\r\n\r\n\"Vot ship vass dot?\" were the first words of throaty guttural English\r\nthat came from a figure which projected from the conning tower.\r\n\r\n\"The _Laconia_,\" answered the Chief Steward Ballyn, who commanded the\r\nlife-boat.\r\n\r\n\"Vot?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Laconia_, Cunard Line,\" responded the steward.\r\n\r\n\"Vot did she weigh?\" was the next question from the submarine.\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen thousand tons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-three,\" replied Ballyn, \"many of them women and children--some\r\nof them in this boat. She had over two hundred in the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she carry cargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss der Captain in dot boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Ballyn answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess you'll be all right. A patrol will pick you up some time\r\nsoon.\" Without further sound save for the almost silent fixing of the\r\nconning tower lid, the submarine moved off.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it best to make my answers sharp and satisfactory, sir,\" said\r\nBallyn, when he repeated the conversation to me word for word. \"I was\r\nthinking of the women and children in the boat. I feared every minute\r\nthat somebody in our boat might make a hostile move, fire a revolver, or\r\nthrow something at the submarine. I feared the consequence of such an\r\nact.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no assurance of an early pickup so we made preparations for a\r\nsiege with the elements. The weather was a great factor. That black rim\r\nof clouds looked ominous. There was a good promise of rain. February has\r\na reputation for nasty weather in the north Atlantic. The wind was cold\r\nand seemed to be rising. Our boat bobbed about like a cork on the\r\nswells, which fortunately were not choppy.\r\n\r\nHow much rougher seas could the boat weather? This question and\r\nconditions were debated pro and con.\r\n\r\nHad our rockets been seen? Did the first torpedo put the wireless out of\r\ncommission? If it had been able to operate, had anybody heard our S. O.\r\nS.? Was there enough food and drinking water in the boat to last?\r\n\r\nThis brought us to an inventory of our small craft. After considerable\r\ndifficulty, we found the lamp, a can of powder flares, the tin of ship's\r\nbiscuit, matches and spare oil.\r\n\r\nThe lamp was lighted. Other lights were now visible. As we drifted in\r\nthe darkness, we could see them every time we mounted the crest of the\r\nswells. The boats carrying these lights remained quite close together at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nOne boat came within sound and I recognised the Harry Lauder-like voice\r\nof the second assistant purser whom I had last heard on Wednesday at the\r\nship's concert. Now he was singing--\"I Want to Marry 'arry,\" and \"I Love\r\nto be a Sailor.\"\r\n\r\nThere were an American woman and her husband in that boat. She told me\r\nlater that an attempt had been made to sing \"Tipperary,\" and \"Rule\r\nBritannia,\" but the thought of that slinking dark hull of destruction\r\nthat might have been a part of the immediate darkness resulted in the\r\nabandonment of the effort.\r\n\r\n\"Who's the officer in that boat?\" came a cheery hail from the nearby\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is it to you?\" our half frozen negro yelled out for no\r\nreason apparent to me other than possibly the relief of his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Will somebody brain that skunk with a pin?\" was the inquiry of our\r\nprofound oathsman, who also expressed regret that he happened to be\r\nsitting too far away from the negro to reach him. He accompanied the\r\nannouncement with a warmth of language that must have relieved the negro\r\nof his chill.\r\n\r\nThe fear of the boats crashing together produced a general inclination\r\ntoward maximum separation on the part of all the little units of\r\nsurvivors, with the result that soon the small crafts stretched out for\r\nseveral miles, their occupants all endeavoring to hold the heads of the\r\nboats into the wind.\r\n\r\nHours passed. The swells slopped over the sides of our boat and filled\r\nthe bottom with water. We bailed it continually. Most of us were wet to\r\nthe knees and shivering from the weakening effects of the icy water. Our\r\nhands were blistered from pulling at the oars. Our boat, bobbing about\r\nlike a cork, produced terrific nausea, and our stomachs ached from vain\r\nwrenching.\r\n\r\nAnd then we saw the first light--the first sign of help coming--the\r\nfirst searching glow of white radiance deep down the sombre sides of the\r\nblack pot of night that hung over us. I don't know what direction it\r\ncame from--none of us knew north from south--there was nothing but water\r\nand sky. But the light--it just came from over there where we pointed.\r\nWe nudged dumb, sick boat mates and directed their gaze and aroused them\r\nto an appreciation of the sight that gave us new life.\r\n\r\nIt was 'way over there--first a trembling quiver of silver against the\r\nblackness, then drawing closer, it defined itself as a beckoning finger,\r\nalthough still too far away to see our feeble efforts to attract it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we wasted valuable flares and the ship's baker,\r\nself-ordained custodian of the biscuit, did the honours handsomely to\r\nthe extent of a biscuit apiece to each of the twenty-three occupants of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"Pull starboard, sonnies,\" sang out old Captain Dear, his grey chin\r\nwhiskers bristling with joy in the light of the round lantern which he\r\nheld aloft.\r\n\r\nWe pulled--pulled lustily, forgetting the strain and pain of innards\r\ntorn and racked with violent vomiting, and oblivious of blistered palms\r\nand wet, half-frozen feet.\r\n\r\nThen a nodding of that finger of light,--a happy, snapping,\r\ncrap-shooting finger that seemed to say: \"Come on, you men,\" like a dice\r\nplayer wooing the bones--led us to believe that our lights had been\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThis was the fact, for immediately the oncoming vessel flashed on its\r\ngreen and red sidelights and we saw it was headed for our position. We\r\nfloated off its stern for a while as it manoeuvred for the best\r\nposition in which it could take us on with a sea that was running higher\r\nand higher.\r\n\r\nThe risk of that rescuing ship was great, because there was every reason\r\nto believe that the submarine that had destroyed the _Laconia_ still\r\nlurked in the darkness nearby, but those on board took the risk and\r\nstood by for the work of rescue.\r\n\r\n\"Come along side port!\" was megaphoned to us. As fast as we could, we\r\nswung under the stern and felt our way broadside toward the ship's side.\r\n\r\nOut of the darkness above, a dozen small pocket flashlights blinked down\r\non us and orders began to be shouted fast and thick.\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on the night, I don't know which was the more\r\nhazardous, going down the slanting side of the sinking _Laconia_ or\r\ngoing up the side of the rescuing vessel.\r\n\r\nOne minute the swells would lift us almost level with the rail of the\r\nlow-built patrol boat and mine sweeper, but the next receding wave would\r\nswirl us down into a darksome gulf over which the ship's side glowered\r\nlike a slimy, dripping cliff.\r\n\r\nA score of hands reached out and we were suspended in the husky,\r\ntattooed arms of those doughty British Jack Tars, looking up into their\r\nweather-beaten youthful faces, mumbling our thankfulness and reading in\r\nthe gold lettering on their pancake hats the legend, \"H. M. S.\r\n_Laburnum_.\" We had been six hours in the open boat.\r\n\r\nThe others began coming alongside one by one. Wet and bedraggled\r\nsurvivors were lifted aboard. Women and children first was the rule.\r\n\r\nThe scenes of reunion were heart-gripping. Men who had remained\r\nstrangers to one another aboard the _Laconia_, now wrung each other by\r\nthe hand or embraced without shame the frail little wife of a Canadian\r\nchaplain who had found one of her missing children delivered up from\r\nanother boat. She smothered the child with ravenous mother kisses while\r\ntears of gladness streamed down her face.\r\n\r\nBoat after boat came alongside. The water-logged craft containing the\r\nCaptain came last.\r\n\r\nA rousing cheer went up as he stepped on the deck, one mangled hand\r\nhanging limp at his side.\r\n\r\nThe sailors divested themselves of outer clothing and passed the\r\ngarments over to the shivering members of the _Laconia's_ crew.\r\n\r\nThe cramped officers' quarters down under the quarter deck were turned\r\nover to the women and children. Two of the _Laconia's_ stewardesses\r\npassed boiling basins of navy cocoa and aided in the disentangling of\r\nwet and matted tresses.\r\n\r\nThe men grouped themselves near steam-pipes in the petty officers'\r\nquarters or over the grating of the engine rooms, where new life was to\r\nbe had from the upward blasts of heated air that brought with them the\r\nsmell of bilge water and oil and sulphur from the bowels of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe injured--all minor cases, sprained backs, wrenched legs or mashed\r\nhands--were put away in bunks under the care of the ship's doctor.\r\n\r\nDawn was melting the eastern ocean grey to pink when the task was\r\nfinished. In the officers' quarters, which had now been invaded by the\r\nmen, the roll of the vessel was most perceptible. Each time the floor of\r\nthe room slanted, bottles and cups and plates rolled and slid back and\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nOn the tables and chairs and benches the women rested. Sea-sick mothers,\r\ntrembling from the after-effects of the terrifying experience of the\r\nnight, sought to soothe their crying children.\r\n\r\nThen somebody happened to touch a key on the small wooden organ that\r\nstood against one wall. This was enough to send some callous seafaring\r\nfingers over the ivory keys in a rhythm unquestionably religious and so\r\nirresistible under the circumstances that, although no one seemed to\r\nknow the words, the air was taken up in a reverent, humming chant by all\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nAt the last note of the Amen, little Father Warring, his black garb\r\nsnaggled in places and badly soiled, stood before the centre table and\r\nlifted back his head until the morning light, filtering through the\r\nopened hatch above him, shown down on his kindly, weary face. He recited\r\nthe Lord's prayer and all present joined. The simple, impressive service\r\nof thanksgiving ended as simply as it had begun.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later I saw the old Jewish travelling man limping about on\r\none lame leg with a little boy in his arms. He was collecting big, round\r\nBritish pennies for the youngster.\r\n\r\nA survey and cruise of the nearby waters revealed no more occupied boats\r\nand our mine sweeper, with its load of survivors numbering two hundred\r\nand sixty-seven, steamed away to the east. A half an hour steaming and\r\nthe vessel stopped within hailing distance of two sister ships, toward\r\none of which an open boat manned by jackies was being pulled.\r\n\r\nI saw the hysterical French actress, her blonde hair wet and bedraggled,\r\nlifted out of the boat and carried up the companionway. Then a little\r\nboy, his fresh pink face and golden hair shining in the morning sun, was\r\npassed upward, followed by some other survivors, numbering fourteen in\r\nall, who had been found half-drowned and almost dead from exposure in a\r\npartially wrecked boat that was picked up just as it was sinking. It was\r\nin that boat that one American woman and her daughter died. One of the\r\nsurvivors of the boat told me the story. He said:\r\n\r\n\"Our boat was No. 8. It was smashed in the lowering. I was in the bow.\r\nMrs. Hoy and her daughter were sitting toward the stern. The boat filled\r\nwith water rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"It was no use trying to bail it out. There was a big hole in the side\r\nand it came in too fast. The boat's edge sank to the level of the water\r\nand only the air-tanks kept it afloat.\r\n\r\n\"It was completely awash. Every swell rode clear over our heads and we\r\nhad to hold our breath until we came to the surface again. The cold\r\nwater just takes the life out of you.\r\n\r\n\"We saw the other boats showing their lights and drifting further and\r\nfurther away from us. We had no lights. And then, towards morning, we\r\nsaw the rescuing ship come up into the cluster of other life-boats that\r\nhad drifted so far away from us. One by one we saw their lights\r\ndisappear as they were taken on board.\r\n\r\n\"We shouted and screamed and shrieked at the tops of our voices, but\r\ncould not attract the attention of any of the other boats or the\r\nrescuing ship, and soon we saw its lights blink out. We were left there\r\nin the darkness with the wind howling and the sea rolling higher every\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\"The women got weaker and weaker. Maybe they had been dead for some\r\ntime. I don't know, but a wave came and washed both Mrs. Hoy and her\r\ndaughter out of the boat. There were life-belts around their bodies and\r\nthey drifted away with their arms locked about one another.\"\r\n\r\nWith such stories ringing in our ears, with exchanges of experiences\r\npathetic and humorous, we steamed into Queenstown harbour shortly after\r\nten o'clock that night. We had been attacked at a point two hundred\r\nmiles off the Irish coast and of our passengers and crew, thirteen had\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped ashore, a Britisher, a fellow-passenger aboard the\r\n_Laconia_, who knew me as an American, stepped up to me. During the\r\nvoyage we had had many conversations concerning the possibility of\r\nAmerica entering the war. Now he slapped me on the back with this\r\nquestion,\r\n\r\n\"Well, old Casus Belli,\" he said, \"is this your blooming overt act?\"\r\n\r\nI did not answer him, but thirty minutes afterward I was pounding out on\r\na typewriter the introduction to a four thousand word newspaper article\r\nwhich I cabled that night and which put the question up to the American\r\npublic for an answer.\r\n\r\nFive weeks later the United States entered the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPERSHING'S ARRIVAL IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nLean, clean, keen--that's the way they looked--that first trim little\r\nband of American fighting men who made their historic landing on the\r\nshores of England, June 8th, 1917.\r\n\r\nI went down from London to meet them at the port of arrival. In my\r\ndespatches of that date, I, nor none of the other correspondents, was\r\npermitted to mention the name of the port. This was supposed to be the\r\nsecret that was to be religiously kept and the British censor was on the\r\njob religiously.\r\n\r\nThe name of the port was excluded from all American despatches but the\r\nBritish censor saw no reason to withhold transmission of the following\r\nsentence--\"Pershing landed to-day at an English port and was given a\r\nhearty welcome by the Mayor of Liverpool.\"\r\n\r\nSo I am presuming at this late date of writing that it would serve no\r\nfurther purpose to refrain from announcing flatly that General John J.\r\nPershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces\r\noverseas, and his staff, landed on the date above mentioned, at\r\nLiverpool, England.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly on the Mersey when the giant ocean liner,\r\nthe _Baltic_, came slowly up the harbour in the tow of numerous puffing\r\ntugs. The great grey vessel that had safely completed the crossing of\r\nthe submarine zone, was warped to the dock-side.\r\n\r\nOn the quay there were a full brass band and an honourary escort of\r\nBritish soldiers. While the moorings were being fastened, General\r\nPershing, with his staff, appeared on the promenade deck on the shore\r\nside of the vessel.\r\n\r\nHis appearance was the signal for a crash of cymbals and drums as the\r\nband blared out the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" The American commander and\r\nthe officers ranged in line on either side of him, stood stiffly at\r\nattention, with right hands raised in salute to the visors of their\r\ncaps.\r\n\r\nOn the shore the lines of British soldiery brought their arms to the\r\npresent with a snap. Civilian witnesses of the ceremony bared their\r\nheads. The first anthem was followed by the playing of \"God Save the\r\nKing.\" All present remained at the salute.\r\n\r\nAs the gangplank was lashed in place, a delegation of British military\r\nand civilian officials boarded the ship and were presented to the\r\nGeneral. Below, on the dock, every newspaper correspondent and\r\nphotographer in the British Isles, I think, stood waiting in a group\r\nthat far outnumbered the other spectators.\r\n\r\nThere was reason for this seeming lack of proportion. The fact was that\r\nbut very few people in all of England, as well as in all of the United\r\nStates, had known that General Pershing was to land that day.\r\n\r\nFew had known that he was on the water. The British Admiralty, then in\r\ncomplete control of the ocean lines between America and the British\r\nIsles, had guarded well the secret. England lost Kitchener on the sea\r\nand now with the sea peril increased a hundredfold, England took pains\r\nto guard well the passage of this standard-bearer of the American\r\nmillions that were to come.\r\n\r\nPershing and his staff stepped ashore. Lean, clean, keen--those are the\r\nwords that described their appearance. That was the way they impressed\r\ntheir critical brothers in arms, the all-observing military dignities\r\nthat presented Britain's hearty, unreserved welcome at the water's edge.\r\nThat was the way they appeared to the proud American citizens, residents\r\nof those islands, who gathered to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe British soldiers admired the height and shoulders of our first\r\nmilitary samples. The British soldier approves of a greyhound trimness\r\nin the belt zone. He likes to look on carriage and poise. He appreciates\r\na steady eye and stiff jaw. He is attracted by a voice that rings sharp\r\nand firm. The British soldier calls such a combination, \"a real\r\nsoldier.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw one, and more than one, that morning shortly after nine o'clock\r\nwhen Pershing and his staff committed the date to history by setting\r\nfoot on British soil. Behind the American commander walked a staff of\r\nAmerican officers whose soldierly bearing and general appearance brought\r\nforth sincere expressions of commendation from the assemblage on the\r\nquay.\r\n\r\nAt attention on the dock, facing the sea-stained flanks of the liner\r\n_Baltic_, a company of Royal Welsh Fusiliers Stood like a frieze of clay\r\nmodels in stainless khaki, polished brass and shining leather.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing inspected the guard of honour with keen interest.\r\nWalking beside the American commander was the considerably stouter and\r\nsomewhat shorter Lieutenant General Sir William Pitcairn Campbell,\r\nK.C.B., Chief of the Western Command of the British Home Forces.\r\n\r\nPershing's inspection of that guard was not the cursory one that these\r\nhonourary affairs usually are. Not a detail of uniform or equipment on\r\nany of the men in the guard was overlooked. The American commander's\r\nattention was as keen to boots, rifles and belts, as though he had been\r\na captain preparing the small command for a strenuous inspection at the\r\nhands of some exacting superior.\r\n\r\nAs he walked down the stiff, standing line, his keen blue eyes taking in\r\neach one of the men from head to foot, he stopped suddenly in front of\r\none man in the ranks. That man was File Three in the second set of\r\nfours. He was a pale-faced Tommy and on one of his sleeves there was\r\ndisplayed two slender gold bars, placed on the forearm.\r\n\r\nThe decoration was no larger than two matches in a row and on that day\r\nit had been in use hardly more than a year, yet neither its minuteness\r\nnor its meaning escaped the eyes of the American commander.\r\n\r\nPershing turned sharply and faced File Three.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get your two wounds?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"At Givenchy and Lavenze, sir,\" replied File Three, his face pointed\r\nstiffly ahead. File Three, even now under twenty-one years of age, had\r\nreceived his wounds in the early fighting that is called the battle of\r\nLoos.\r\n\r\n\"You are a man,\" was the sincere, all-meaning rejoinder of the American\r\ncommander, who accompanied his remark with a straightforward look into\r\nthe eyes of File Three.\r\n\r\nCompleting the inspection without further incident, General Pershing and\r\nhis staff faced the honour guard and stood at the salute, while once\r\nmore the thunderous military band played the national anthems of America\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was followed by a reception in the cabin of the _Baltic_,\r\nwhere General Pershing received the Lord Mayor of Liverpool, the Lady\r\nMayoress, and a delegation of civil authorities. The reception ended\r\nwhen General Pershing spoke a few simple words to the assembled\r\nrepresentatives of the British and American Press.\r\n\r\n\"More of us are coming,\" was the keynote of his modest remarks.\r\nAfterward he was escorted to the quay-side station, where a special\r\ntrain of the type labelled Semi-Royal was ready to make the express run\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nThe reception at the dock had had none of the features of a\r\ndemonstration by reason of the necessity for the ship's arrival being\r\nsecret, but as soon as the _Baltic_ had landed, the word of the American\r\ncommander's arrival spread through Liverpool like wildfire.\r\n\r\nThe railroad from the station lay through an industrial section of the\r\ncity. Through the railroad warehouses the news had preceded the train.\r\nWarehouse-men, porters and draymen crowded the tops of the cotton bales\r\nand oil barrels on both sides of the track as the train passed through.\r\n\r\nBeyond the sheds, the news had spread through the many floors of the\r\nflour mills and when the Pershing train passed, handkerchiefs and caps\r\nfluttered from every crowded door and window in the whitened walls. Most\r\nof the waving was done by a new kind of flour-girl, one who did not wave\r\nan apron because none of them were dressed that way.\r\n\r\nFrom his car window, General Pershing returned the greetings of the\r\ntrousered girls and women who were making England's bread while their\r\nhusbands, fathers, brothers, sweethearts and sons were making German\r\ncemeteries.\r\n\r\nIn London, General Pershing and his staff occupied suites at the Savoy\r\nHotel, and during the four or five days of the American commander's\r\nsojourn in the capital of the British Empire, a seemingly endless line\r\nof visitors of all the Allied nationalities called to present their\r\ncompliments.\r\n\r\nThe enlisted men of the General's staff occupied quarters in the old\r\nstone barracks of the Tower of London, where they were the guests of the\r\nmen of that artillery organisation which prefixes an \"Honourable\" to its\r\nname and has been assigned for centuries to garrison duty in the Tower\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers manifested naïve interest in some of England's most revered\r\ntraditions and particularly in connection with historical events related\r\nto the Tower of London. On the second day of their occupation of this\r\nold fortress, one of the warders, a \"Beef-eater\" in full mediæval\r\nregalia, was escorting a party of the Yanks through the dungeons.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in one dungeon and lined the party up in front of a stone\r\nblock in the centre of the floor. After a silence of a full minute to\r\nproduce a proper degree of impressiveness for the occasion, the warder\r\nannounced, in a respectful whisper:\r\n\r\n\"This is where Anne Boleyn was executed.\"\r\n\r\nThe lined-up Yanks took a long look at the stone block. A silence\r\nfollowed during the inspection. And then one regular, desiring further\r\ninformation, but not wishing to be led into any traps of British wit,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll bite; what did Annie do?\"\r\n\r\nCurrent with the arrival of our men and their reception by the honour\r\nguard of the Welsh Fusiliers there was a widespread revival of an old\r\nstory which the Americans liked to tell in the barrack rooms at night.\r\n\r\nWhen the Welsh Fusiliers received our men at the dock of Liverpool, they\r\nhad with them their historical mascot, a large white goat with horns\r\nencased in inscribed silver. The animal wore suspended from its neck a\r\nlarge silver plate, on which was inscribed a partial history of the\r\nWelsh Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nSome of these Fusiliers told our men the story.\r\n\r\n\"It was our regiment--the Welsh Fusiliers,\" one of them said, \"that\r\nfought you Yanks at Bunker Hill. And it was at Bunker Hill that our\r\nregiment captured the great-great-granddaddy of this same white goat,\r\nand his descendants are ever destined to be the mascot of our regiment.\r\nYou see, we have still got your goat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will notice,\" replied one of the Yanks, \"we've got the hill.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the four days in London, General Pershing was received by King\r\nGeorge and Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace. The American commander\r\nengaged in several long conferences at the British War Office, and then\r\nwith an exclusion of entertainment that was painful to the Europeans, he\r\nmade arrangements to leave for his new post in France.\r\n\r\nA specially written permission from General Pershing made it possible\r\nfor me to accompany him on that historic crossing between England and\r\nFrance. Secret orders for the departure were given on the afternoon and\r\nevening of June 12th. Before four o'clock of the next morning, June\r\n13th, I breakfasted in the otherwise deserted dining-room of the Savoy\r\nwith the General and his staff.\r\n\r\nOnly a few sleepy-eyed attendants were in the halls and lower rooms of\r\nthe Savoy. In closed automobiles we were whisked away to Charing Cross\r\nStation. We boarded a special train whose destination was unknown. The\r\nentire party was again in the hands of the Intelligence Section of the\r\nBritish Admiralty, and every possible means was taken to suppress all\r\ndefinite information concerning the departure.\r\n\r\nThe special train containing General Pershing and his staff reached\r\nFolkstone at about seven o'clock in the morning. We left the train at\r\nthe dockside and boarded the swift Channel steamer moored there. A small\r\nvociferous contingent of English Tommies returning to the front from\r\nleave in \"Blighty\" were crowded on all decks in the stern.\r\n\r\nWith life-boats swinging out over the side and every one wearing\r\nlife-preservers, we steamed out of Folkstone harbour to challenge the\r\nsubmarine dangers of the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe American commander occupied a forward cabin suite on the upper deck.\r\nHis aides and secretaries had already transformed it into a\r\nbusiness-like apartment. In the General's mind there was no place or\r\ntime for any consideration of the dangers of the Channel crossing.\r\nAlthough the very waters through which we dashed were known to be\r\ninfested with submarines which would have looked upon him as capital\r\nprey, I don't believe the General ever gave them as much as a thought.\r\n\r\nEvery time I looked through the open door of his cabin, he was busy\r\ndictating letters to his secretaries or orders or instructions to his\r\naides or conferring with his Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Harbord.\r\nTo the American commander, the hours necessary for the dash across the\r\nChannel simply represented a little more time which he could devote to\r\nthe plans for the great work ahead of him.\r\n\r\nOur ship was guarded on all sides and above. Swift torpedo destroyers\r\ndashed to and fro under our bow and stern and circled us continually. In\r\nthe air above hydro-airplanes and dirigible balloons hovered over the\r\nwaters surrounding us, keeping sharp watch for the first appearance of\r\nthe dark sub-sea hulks of destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARRIVAL IN LONDON, SHOWING GENERAL PERSHING, MR.\r\nPAGE, FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT FRENCH, LORD DERBY, AND ADMIRAL SIMS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PERSHING BOWING TO THE CROWD IN PARIS]\r\n\r\nWe did not learn until the next day that while we were making that\r\nChannel crossing, the German air forces had crossed the Channel in a\r\ndaring daylight raid and were at that very hour dropping bombs on London\r\naround the very hotel which General Pershing had just vacated. Some day,\r\nafter the war, I hope to ascertain whether the commander of that flight\r\nof bombing Gothas started on his expedition over London with a special\r\npurpose in view and whether that purpose concerned the supposed presence\r\nthere of the commander-in-chief of the American millions that were later\r\nto change the entire complexion of the war against Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful sunlight day. It was not long before the coast line\r\nof France began to push itself up through the distant Channel mists and\r\nmake itself visible on the horizon. I stood in the bow of the ship\r\nlooking toward the coast line and silent with thoughts concerning the\r\nmomentousness of the approaching historical event.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I looked back amidships and saw a solitary figure\r\nstanding on the bridge of the vessel. It was General Pershing. He seemed\r\nrapt in deep thought. He wore his cap straight on his head, the visor\r\nshading his eyes. He stood tall and erect, his hands behind him, his\r\nfeet planted slightly apart to accommodate the gentle roll of the ship.\r\n\r\nHe faced due east and his eyes were directed toward the shores of that\r\nforeign land which we were approaching. It seemed to me as I watched him\r\nthat his mind must have been travelling back more than a century to that\r\nday in history when another soldier had stood on the bridge of another\r\nvessel, crossing those same waters, but in an almost opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that he must have been thinking of that historical\r\ncharacter who made just such a journey more than a hundred years\r\nbefore,--a great soldier who left his homeland to sail to other foreign\r\nshores halfway around the world and there to lend his sword in the fight\r\nfor the sacred principles of Democracy. It seemed to me that day that\r\nPershing thought of Lafayette.\r\n\r\nAs we drew close to the shore, I noticed an enormous concrete breakwater\r\nextending out from the harbour entrance. It was surmounted by a wooden\r\nrailing and on the very end of it, straddling the rail, was a small\r\nFrench boy. His legs were bare and his feet were encased in heavy wooden\r\nshoes. On his head he wore a red stocking cap of the liberty type. As we\r\ncame within hailing distance, he gave to us the first greeting that came\r\nfrom the shores of France to these first arriving American soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"_Vive l'Amérique!_\" he shouted, cupping his hands to his mouth and\r\nsending his shrill voice across the water to us. Pershing on the bridge\r\nheard the salutation. He smiled, touched his hand to his hat and waved\r\nto the lad on the railing.\r\n\r\nWe landed that day at Boulogne, June 13th, 1917. Military bands massed\r\non the quay, blared out the American National Anthem as the ship was\r\nwarped alongside the dock. Other ships in the busy harbour began blowing\r\nwhistles and ringing bells, loaded troop and hospital ships lying nearby\r\nburst forth into cheering. The news spread like contagion along the\r\nharbour front.\r\n\r\nAs the gangplank was lowered, French military dignitaries in dress\r\nuniforms resplendent with gold braid, buttons and medals, advanced to\r\nthat part of the deck amidships where the General stood. They saluted\r\nrespectfully and pronounced elaborate addresses in their native tongue.\r\nThey were followed by numerous French Government officials in civilian\r\ndress attire. The city, the department and the nation were represented\r\nin the populous delegations who presented their compliments, and\r\nconveyed to the American commander the of the entire people of France.\r\n\r\nUnder the train sheds on the dock, long stiff, standing ranks of French\r\npoilus wearing helmets and their light blue overcoats pinned back at the\r\nknees, presented arms as the General walked down the lines inspecting\r\nthem. At one end of the line, rank upon rank of French marines, and\r\nsailors with their flat hats with red tassels, stood at attention\r\nawaiting inspection.\r\n\r\nThe docks and train sheds were decorated with French and American flags\r\nand yards and yards of the mutually-owned red, white and blue. Thousands\r\nof spectators began to gather in the streets near the station, and their\r\ncontinuous cheers sufficed to rapidly augment their own numbers.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a veteran French colonel, one of whose uniform sleeves\r\nwas empty, General Pershing, as a guest of the city of Boulogne, took a\r\nmotor ride through the streets of this busy port city. He was quickly\r\nreturned to the station, where he and his staff boarded a special train\r\nfor Paris. I went with them.\r\n\r\nThat train to Paris was, of necessity, slow. It proceeded slowly under\r\norders and with a purpose. No one in France, with the exception of a\r\nselect official circle, had been aware that General Pershing was\r\narriving that day until about thirty minutes before his ship was warped\r\ninto the dock at Boulogne. It has always been a mystery to me how the\r\nFrench managed to decorate the station at Boulogne upon such short\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the train crawled slowly toward Paris for the purpose\r\nof giving the French capital time to throw off the coat of war\r\nweariness that it had worn for three and a half years and don gala\r\nattire for this occasion. Paris made full use of every minute of that\r\ntime, as we found when the train arrived at the French capital late in\r\nthe afternoon. The evening papers in Paris had carried the news of the\r\nAmerican commander's landing on the shores of France, and Paris was\r\nready to receive him as Paris had never before received a world's\r\nnotable.\r\n\r\nThe sooty girders of the Gare du Nord shook with cheers when the special\r\ntrain pulled in. The aisles of the great terminal were carpeted with red\r\nplush. A battalion of bearded poilus of the Two Hundred and\r\nThirty-seventh Colonial Regiment was lined up on the platform like a\r\nwall of silent grey, bristling with bayonets and shiny trench helmets.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing stepped from his private car. Flashlights boomed and\r\nbatteries of camera men manoeuvred into positions for the lens\r\nbarrage. The band of the Garde Républicaine blared forth the strains of\r\nthe \"Star Spangled Banner,\" bringing all the military to a halt and a\r\nlong standing salute. It was followed by the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the train-side greetings and introductions, Marshal\r\nJoffre and General Pershing walked down the platform together. The tops\r\nof the cars of every train in the station were crowded with workmen. As\r\nthe tall, slender American commander stepped into view, the privileged\r\nobservers on the car-tops began to cheer.\r\n\r\nA minute later, there was a terrific roar from beyond the walls of the\r\nstation. The crowds outside had heard the cheering within. They took it\r\nup with thousands of throats. They made their welcome a ringing one.\r\nParis took Pershing by storm.\r\n\r\nThe General was ushered into the specially decorated reception chamber,\r\nwhich was hung and carpeted with brilliant red velvet and draped with\r\nthe Allied flags. After a brief formal exchange of greetings in this\r\nlarge chamber, he and his staff were escorted to the line of waiting\r\nautomobiles at the side of the station in the Rue de Roubaix.\r\n\r\nPershing's appearance in the open was the cue for wild, unstinted\r\napplause and cheering from the crowds which packed the streets and\r\njammed the windows of the tall buildings opposite.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing and M. Painlevé, Minister of War, took seats in a large\r\nautomobile. They were preceded by a motor containing United States\r\nAmbassador Sharp and former Premier Viviani. The procession started to\r\nthe accompaniment of martial music by massed military bands in the\r\ncourtyard of the station. It passed through the Rue de Compiègne, the\r\nRue de Lafayette, the Place de l'Opéra, the Boulevard des Capucines, the\r\nPlace de la Madeleine, the Rue Royale, to the Place de la Concorde.\r\n\r\nThere were some fifty automobiles in the line, the rear of which was\r\nbrought up by an enormous motor-bus load of the first American soldiers\r\nfrom the ranks to pass through the streets of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe crowds overflowed the sidewalks. They extended from the building\r\nwalls out beyond the curbs and into the streets, leaving but a narrow\r\nlane through which the motors pressed their way slowly and with the\r\nexercise of much care. From the crowded balconies and windows\r\noverlooking the route, women and children tossed down showers of flowers\r\nand bits of coloured paper.\r\n\r\nThe crowds were so dense that other street traffic became marooned in\r\nthe dense sea of joyously excited and gesticulating French people.\r\nVehicles thus marooned immediately became islands of vantage. They were\r\nsoon covered with men and women and children, who climbed on top of them\r\nand clung to the sides to get a better look at the khaki-clad occupants\r\nof the autos.\r\n\r\nOld grey-haired fathers of French fighting men bared their heads and\r\nwith tears streaming down their cheeks shouted greetings to the tall,\r\nthin, grey-moustached American commander who was leading new armies to\r\nthe support of their sons. Women heaped armfuls of roses into the\r\nGeneral's car and into the cars of other American officers that followed\r\nhim. Paris street gamins climbed the lamp-posts and waved their caps and\r\nwooden shoes and shouted shrilly.\r\n\r\nAmerican flags and red, white and blue bunting waved wherever the eye\r\nrested. English-speaking Frenchmen proudly explained to the uninformed\r\nthat \"Pershing\" was pronounced \"Peur-chigne\" and not \"Pair-shang.\"\r\n\r\nParis was not backward in displaying its knowledge of English. Gay\r\nParisiennes were eager to make use of all the English at their command,\r\nthat they might welcome the new arrivals in their native tongue.\r\n\r\nSome of these women shouted \"Hello,\" \"Heep, heep, hourrah,\" \"Good\r\nmorning,\" \"How are you, keed?\" and \"Cock-tails for two.\" Some of the\r\nexpressions were not so inappropriate as they sounded.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there came from the crowds a good old genuine American\r\nwhoop-em-up yell. This happened when the procession passed groups of\r\nAmerican ambulance workers and other sons of Uncle Sam, wearing the\r\nuniforms of the French, Canadian and English Corps.\r\n\r\nThey joined with Australians and South African soldiers on leave to\r\ncheer on the new-coming Americans with such spontaneous expressions as\r\n\"Come on, you Yanks,\" \"Now let's get 'em,\" and \"Eat 'em up, Uncle Sam.\"\r\n\r\nThe frequent stopping of the procession by the crowds made it happen\r\nquite frequently that the automobiles were completely surrounded by\r\nenthusiasts, who reached up and tried to shake hands with the occupants.\r\nPretty girls kissed their hands and blew the invisible confection toward\r\nthe men in khaki.\r\n\r\nThe bus-load of enlisted men bringing up the rear received dozens of\r\nbouquets from the girls. The flowers were hurled at them from all\r\ndirections. Every two hundred feet the French would organise a rousing\r\nshout, \"_Vive l'Amérique!_\" for them.\r\n\r\nBeing the passive recipients of this unusual adulation produced only\r\nembarrassment on the part of the regulars who simply had to sit there,\r\nsmiling and taking it. Just to break the one-sided nature of the\r\ndemonstrations, one of the enlisted men stood up in his seat and,\r\naddressing himself to his mates, shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Come on, fellows, let's give 'em a 'veever' ourselves. Now all\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe bus-load rose to its feet like one man and shouted \"Veever for\r\nFrance.\" Their \"France\" rhymed with \"pants,\" so that none of the French\r\nunderstood it, but they did understand the sentiment behind the husky\r\nAmerican lungs.\r\n\r\nThrough such scenes as these, the procession reached the great Place de\r\nla Concorde. In this wide, paved, open space an enormous crowd had\r\nassembled. As the autos appeared the cheering, the flower throwing, the\r\ntumultuous kiss-blowing began. It increased in intensity as the motors\r\nstopped in front of the Hôtel Crillon into which General Pershing\r\ndisappeared, followed by his staff.\r\n\r\nImmediately the cheering changed to a tremendous clamorous demand for\r\nthe General's appearance on the balcony in front of his apartments.\r\n\r\n\"_Au balcon, au balcon_,\" were the cries that filled the Place. The\r\ncrowd would not be denied.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing stepped forth on the balcony. He stood behind the low\r\nmarble railing, and between two enormous white-stoned columns. A cluster\r\nof the Allied flags was affixed to each column. The American commander\r\nsurveyed the scene in front of him.\r\n\r\nThere are no trees or shrubbery in the vast Place de la Concorde. Its\r\nbroad paved surface is interrupted only by artistically placed groups of\r\nstatuary and fountains.\r\n\r\nTo the General's right, as he faced the Place, were the trees and\r\ngreenery of the broad Champs Elysées. On his left were the fountains and\r\nthe gardens of the Tuilleries. At the further end of the Place, five\r\nhundred feet straight in front of him, were the banks and the ornamental\r\nbridges of the Seine, beyond which could be seen the columned façade of\r\nthe Chambre des Deputies, and above and beyond that, against the blue\r\nsky of a late June afternoon, rose the majestic golden dome of the\r\nInvalides, over the tomb of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing looked down upon the sea of faces turned up toward him,\r\nand then it seemed that nature desired to play a part in the ceremony of\r\nthat great day. A soft breeze from the Champs Elysées touched the\r\ncluster of flags on the General's right and from all the Allied emblems\r\nfastened there it selected one flag.\r\n\r\nThe breeze tenderly caught the folds of this flag and wafted them across\r\nthe balcony on which the General bowed. He saw and recognised that flag.\r\nHe extended his hand, caught the flag in his fingers and pressed it to\r\nhis lips. All France and all America represented in that vast throng\r\nthat day cheered to the mighty echo when Pershing kissed the tri-colour\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous, unforgettable incident. It was exceeded by no other\r\nincident during those days of receptions and ceremonies, except one.\r\nThat was an incident which occurred not in the presence of thousands,\r\nbut in a lonely old burial ground on the outskirts of Paris. This\r\nhappened several days after the demonstration in the Place de la\r\nConcorde.\r\n\r\nOn that day of bright sunshine, General Pershing and a small party of\r\nofficers, French and American, walked through the gravel paths of Picpus\r\nCemetery in the suburbs of Paris, where the bodies of hundreds of those\r\nwho made the history of France are buried.\r\n\r\nSeveral French women in deep mourning courtesied as General Pershing\r\npassed. His party stopped in front of two marble slabs that lay side by\r\nside at the foot of a granite monument. From the General's party a\r\nFrenchman stepped forward and, removing his high silk hat, he addressed\r\nthe small group in quiet, simple tones and well-chosen English words. He\r\nwas the Marquis de Chambrun. He said:\r\n\r\n  \"On this spot one can say that the historic ties between our nations\r\n  are not the result of the able schemes of skilful diplomacy. No, the\r\n  principles of liberty, justice and independence are the glorious\r\n  links between our nations.\r\n\r\n  \"These principles have enlisted the hearts of our democracies. They\r\n  have made the strength of their union and have brought about the\r\n  triumph of their efforts.\r\n\r\n  \"To-day, when, after nearly a century and a half, America and France\r\n  are engaged in a conflict for the same cause upon which their early\r\n  friendship was based, we are filled with hope and confidence.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that our great nations are together with our Allies\r\n  invincible, and we rejoice to think that the United States and\r\n  France are reunited in the fight for liberty, and will reconsecrate,\r\n  in a new victory, their everlasting friendship of which your\r\n  presence to-day at this grave is an exquisite and touching token.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing advanced to the tomb and placed upon the marble slab an\r\nenormous wreath of pink and white roses. Then he stepped back. He\r\nremoved his cap and held it in both hands in front of him. The bright\r\nsunlight shone down on his silvery grey hair. Looking down at the grave,\r\nhe spoke in a quiet, impressive tone four simple, all-meaning words:\r\n\r\n  \"Lafayette, we are here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING OF THE FIRST AMERICAN CONTINGENT IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first executive work of the American Expeditionary Forces overseas\r\nwas performed in a second floor suite of the Crillon Hotel on the Place\r\nde la Concorde in Paris. This suite was the first temporary headquarters\r\nof the American commander.\r\n\r\nThe tall windows of the rooms looked down on the historic Place which\r\nwas the scene of so many momentous events in French history. The windows\r\nwere hardly a hundred yards from the very spot where the guillotine\r\ndripped red in the days of the Terror. It was here that the heads of\r\nLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette dropped into the basket.\r\n\r\nDuring General Pershing's comparatively brief occupancy of these\r\nheadquarters, the reception rooms were constantly banked with fresh-cut\r\nflowers, the daily gifts of the French people,--flowers that were\r\nreplenished every twenty-four hours. The room was called the \"Salon des\r\nBatailles.\"\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the room, near a window overlooking the Place, was\r\nGeneral Pershing's table. It was adorned with a statuette of General\r\nJoffre and a cluster of miniatures of captured German standards.\r\nExtending from the floor to the ceiling on one of the walls were two\r\nenormous oil copies of \"La Bataille de Fontenoy\" and the \"Passage du\r\nRhin.\" A large flag-draped photograph of President Wilson occupied a\r\nplace of honour on an easel at one end of the room.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week that General Pershing stopped at the hotel, the\r\nsidewalk and street beneath his windows were constantly crowded with\r\npeople. The crowds waited there all day long, just in the hope of\r\ncatching a glimpse of the American commander if he should happen to be\r\nleaving or returning to his quarters. It seemed as if every Parisienne\r\nand Parisian had taken upon herself and himself the special duty of\r\npersonally observing General Pershing, of waving him an enthusiastic\r\n\"vive\" and possibly being within the scope of his returning salute.\r\n\r\nBut the American commander would not permit demonstrations and\r\ncelebrations to interfere with the important duties that he faced. Two\r\ndays are all that were devoted to these social ceremonies which the\r\nenthusiastic and hospitable French would have made almost endless.\r\nDinners, receptions and parades were ruthlessly erased from the working\r\nday calendar. The American commander sounded the order \"To work\" with\r\nthe same martial precision as though the command had been a sudden call\r\n\"To arms.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day after General Pershing's arrival in\r\nParis, the typewriters began clicking incessantly and the telephones\r\nbegan ringing busily in the large building which was occupied on that\r\nday as the headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces in France.\r\n\r\nThis building was Numbers 27 and 31 Rue de Constantine. It faced the\r\ntrees and shrubbery bordering the approach to the Seine front of the\r\nInvalides. The building was two stories high with grey-white walls and a\r\nmansard roof. At that time it could be immediately identified as the one\r\nin front of which stood a line of American motor cars, as the one where\r\ntrim United States regulars walked sentry post past the huge doors\r\nthrough which frequent orderlies dashed with messages.\r\n\r\nTen days before, the building had been the residence of a Marquis and\r\nhad contained furniture and art valued at millions of francs. All of\r\nthose home-like characteristics had been removed so effectively that\r\neven the name of the kindly Marquis had been forgotten. I am sure that\r\nhe, himself, at the end of that ten-day period could not have recognised\r\nhis converted salons where the elaborate ornamentation had been changed\r\nto the severe simplicity typical of a United States Army barracks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing's office was located on the second floor of the house\r\nand in one corner. In those early days it was carpetless and contained\r\nalmost a monkish minimum of furniture. There were the General's chair,\r\nand his desk on which there stood a peculiar metal standard for one of\r\nthose one-piece telephone sets with which Americans are familiar only in\r\nFrench stage settings. A book-case with glass doors, a stenographer's\r\ntable and chair, and two red plush upholstered chairs, for visitors,\r\ncomprised the furniture inventory of the room.\r\n\r\nOne of the inner walls of the room was adorned with a large mirror with\r\na gilt frame, and in the other wall was a plain fireplace. There were\r\ntall windows in the two outer walls which looked out on the Rue de\r\nConstantine and the Rue de Grenelle. Opposite the Rue de Grenelle\r\nwindows there was a small, deeply shaded park where children rolled\r\nhoops during the heat of the day and where convalescent French soldiers\r\nsat and watched the children at play or perhaps discussed the war and\r\nother things with the nurse-maids.\r\n\r\nThis was the first workshop in France of the American\r\ncommander-in-chief. Adjoining rooms to the left and right were occupied\r\nby the General's staff and his aides. And it was in these rooms that\r\nthe overseas plans for the landing of the first American armed\r\ncontingent in France were formulated.\r\n\r\nIt is safe now to mention that St. Nazaire on the west coast of France\r\nwas the port at which our first armed forces disembarked. I was in Paris\r\nwhen the information of their coming was whispered to a few chosen\r\ncorrespondents who were to be privileged to witness this historical\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in the history of our nation that a large force\r\nof armed Americans was to cross the seas to Europe. For five and a half\r\nmonths prior to the date of their landing, the ruthless submarine policy\r\nof the Imperial German Government had been in effect, and our troop\r\nships with those initial thousands of American soldiers represented the\r\nfirst large Armada to dare the ocean crossing since Germany had\r\ninstituted her sub-sea blockade zone in February of that same year.\r\n\r\nThus it was that any conversation concerning the fact that our men were\r\non the seas and at the mercy of the U-boats was conducted with the\r\ngreatest of care behind closed doors. In spite of the efforts of the\r\nFrench agents of contra espionage, Paris and all France, for that\r\nmatter, housed numerous spies. There were some anxious moments while\r\nthat first contingent was on the water.\r\n\r\nOur little group of correspondents was informed that we should be\r\nconducted by American officers to the port of landing, but the name of\r\nthat port was withheld from us. By appointment we met at a Paris\r\nrailroad station where we were provided with railroad tickets. We took\r\nour places in compartments and rode for some ten or twelve hours,\r\narriving early the next morning at St. Nazaire.\r\n\r\nThis little village on the coast of Brittany was tucked away there in\r\nthe golden sands of the seashore. Its houses had walls of white stucco\r\nand gabled roofs of red tile. In the small rolling hills behind it were\r\ngreen orchards and fields of yellow wheat. The villagers, old women in\r\ntheir starched white head-dresses and old men wearing faded blue smocks\r\nand wooden shoes, were unmindful of the great event for which history\r\nhad destined their village.\r\n\r\nOn the night before the landing the townspeople had retired with no\r\nknowledge of what was to happen on the following day. In the morning\r\nthey awoke to find strange ships that had come in the night, riding\r\nsafely at anchor in the harbour. The wooden shutters began to pop open\r\nwith bangs as excited heads, encased in peaked flannel nightcaps,\r\nprotruded themselves from bedroom windows and directed anxious queries\r\nto those who happened to be abroad at that early hour.\r\n\r\nSt. Nazaire came to life more quickly that morning than ever before in\r\nits history. The Mayor of the town was one of the busiest figures on the\r\nstreet. In high hat and full dress attire, he hurried about trying to\r\nassemble the village orchestra of octogenarian fiddlers and flute\r\nplayers to play a welcome for the new arrivals. The townspeople\r\nneglected their _café au lait_ to rush down to the quay to look at the\r\nnew ships.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the harbour sparkled in the early morning sunlight. The\r\ndawn had been grey and misty, but now nature seemed to smile. The\r\nstrange ships from the other side of the world were grey in hulk but now\r\nthere were signs of life and colour aboard each one of them.\r\n\r\nBeyond the troop ships lay the first United States warships, units of\r\nthat remarkable fighting organisation which in the year that was to\r\nimmediately follow that very day were to escort safely across three\r\nthousand miles of submarine-infested water more than a million and a\r\nhalf American soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these first warships of ours was novel to the French\r\ntownspeople. Our ships had peculiar looking masts, masts which the\r\ntownspeople compared to the baskets which the French peasants carry on\r\ntheir backs when they harvest the lettuce. Out further from the shore\r\nwere our low-lying torpedo destroyers, pointed toward the menace of the\r\nouter deep.\r\n\r\nBusy puffing tugs were warping the first troop ship toward the\r\nquay-side. Some twenty or thirty American sailors and soldiers, who had\r\nbeen previously landed by launch to assist in the disembarkation, were\r\nhandling the lines on the dock.\r\n\r\nWhen but twenty feet from the quay-side, the successive decks of the\r\nfirst troop ship took on the appearance of mud-coloured layers from the\r\nkhaki uniforms of the stiff standing ranks of our men. A military band\r\non the forward deck was playing the national anthems of France and\r\nAmerica and every hand was being held at the salute.\r\n\r\nAs the final bars of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" crashed out and every\r\nsaluting hand came snappily down, one American soldier on an upper deck\r\nleaned over the rail and shouted to a comrade on the shore his part of\r\nthe first exchange of greetings between our fighting men upon this\r\nhistoric occasion. Holding one hand to his lips, he seriously enquired:\r\n\r\n\"Say, do they let the enlisted men in the saloons here?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST AMERICAN FOOT ON FRENCH SOIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\nAnother soldier standing near the stern rail had a different and more\r\nserious interrogation to make. He appeared rather blasé about it as he\r\nleaned over the rail and, directing his voice toward a soldier on the\r\ndock, casually demanded:\r\n\r\n\"Say, where the Hell is all this trouble, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nThese two opening sorties produced a flood of others. The most common\r\nenquiry was: \"What's the name of this place?\" and \"Is this France or\r\nEngland?\" When answers were made to these questions, the recipients of\r\nthe information, particularly if they happened to be \"old-timers in the\r\narmy,\" would respond by remarking, \"Well, it's a damn sight better than\r\nthe Mexican border.\"\r\n\r\nAs our men came over the ship's side and down the runways, there was no\r\ngreat reception committee awaiting them. Among the most interested\r\nspectators of the event were a group of stolid German prisoners of war\r\nand the two French soldiers guarding them. The two Frenchmen talked\r\nvolubly with a wealth of gesticulation, while the Germans maintained\r\ntheir characteristic glumness.\r\n\r\nThe German prisoners appeared to be anything but discouraged at the\r\nsight. Some of them even wore a smile that approached the supercilious.\r\nWith some of them that smile seemed to say: \"You can't fool us. We know\r\nthese troops are not Americans. They are either Canadians or Australians\r\ncoming from England. Our German U-boats won't let Americans cross the\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\nSome of those German prisoners happened to have been in America before\r\nthe war. They spoke English and recognised the uniforms of our men.\r\nTheir silent smiles seemed to say: \"Well, they don't look so good at\r\nthat. We have seen better soldiers. And, besides, there is only a\r\nhandful of them. Not enough can come to make any difference. Anyhow, it\r\nis too late now. The war will be over before any appreciable number can\r\nget here.\"\r\n\r\nBut the stream of khaki continued to pour out of the ship's side.\r\nCompany after company of our men, loaded down with packs and full field\r\nequipment, lined up on the dock and marched past the group of German\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"We're passing in review for you, Fritzie,\" one irrepressible from our\r\nranks shouted, as the marching line passed within touching distance of\r\nthe prisoner group. The Germans responded only with quizzical little\r\nsmiles and silence.\r\n\r\nEscorted by our own military bands, the regiments marched through the\r\nmain street of the village. The bands played \"Dixie\"--a new air to\r\nFrance. The regiments as a whole did not present the snappy, marching\r\nappearance that they might have presented. There was a good reason for\r\nthis. Sixty per cent. of them were recruits. It had been wisely decided\r\nto replace many of the old regular army men in the ranks with newly\r\nenlisted men, so that these old veterans could remain in America and\r\ntrain the new drafts.\r\n\r\nHowever, that which impressed the French people was the individual\r\nappearance of these samples of American manhood. Our men were tall and\r\nbroad and brawny. They were young and vigorous. Their eyes were keen and\r\nsnappy. Their complexions ranged in shade from the swarthy sun-tanned\r\ncheeks of border veterans to the clear pink skins of city youngsters.\r\nBut most noticeable of all to the French people were the even white rows\r\nof teeth which our men displayed when they smiled. Good dentistry and\r\nclean mouths are essentially American.\r\n\r\nThe villagers of St. Nazaire, old men and women, girls and school\r\nchildren, lined the curbs as our men marched through the town. The line\r\nof march was over a broad esplanade that circled the sandy beach of the\r\nbay, and then wound upward into the higher ground back of the town. The\r\nroad here was bordered on either side with ancient stone walls covered\r\nwith vines and over the tops of the walls there extended fruit-laden\r\nbranches to tempt our men with their ripe, red lusciousness. As they\r\nmarched through the heat and dust of that June day, many succumbed to\r\nthe temptations and paid for their appetites with inordinately violent\r\ncolics that night.\r\n\r\nA camp site had been partially prepared for their reception. It was\r\nlocated close to a French barracks. The French soldiers and gangs of\r\nGerman prisoners, who had been engaged in this work, had no knowledge of\r\nthe fact that they were building the first American cantonment in\r\nFrance. They thought they were constructing simply an extension of the\r\nFrench encampment.\r\n\r\nThat first contingent, composed of United States Infantrymen and\r\nMarines, made its first camp in France with the smallest amount of\r\nconfusion, considering the fact that almost three-quarters of them\r\nhadn't been in uniform a month. It was but several hours after arriving\r\nat the camp that the smoke was rising from the busy camp stoves and the\r\naroma of American coffee, baked beans and broiled steaks was in the air.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that first day some of the men were given permission\r\nto visit the town. They began to take their first lessons in French as\r\nthey went from café to café in futile efforts to connect up with such\r\nunknown commodities as cherry pie or ham and egg sandwiches. Upon\r\nmeeting one another in the streets, our men would invariably ask: \"Have\r\nyou come across any of these FROGS that talk American?\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing disrespectful about the terms Frogs or Froggies as\r\napplied to their French comrades in arms. American officers hastened to\r\nexplain to French officers that the one piece of information concerning\r\nFrance most popularly known in America was that it was the place where\r\npeople first learned to eat frog legs and snails.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen, on the other hand, were somewhat inclined to believe that\r\nthese first Americans didn't live up to the European expectations of\r\nAmericans. Those European expectations had been founded almost entirely\r\nupon the translations of dime novels and moving picture thrillers of the\r\nWild West and comedy variety.\r\n\r\nAlthough our men wore the high, broad-brimmed felt hats, they didn't\r\nseem sufficiently cowboyish. Although the French people waited\r\nexpectantly, none of these Americans dashed through the main street of\r\nthe village on bucking bronchos, holding their reins in their teeth and\r\nat the same time firing revolvers from either hand. Moreover, none of\r\nour men seemed to conclude their dinners in the expected American\r\nfashion of slapping one another in the face with custard pies.\r\n\r\nThere was to be seen on the streets of St. Nazaire that day some\r\nrepresentative black Americans, who had also landed in that historical\r\nfirst contingent. There was a strange thing about these negroes.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the early stages of our participation in\r\nthe war it had been found that there was hardly sufficient khaki cloth\r\nto provide uniforms for all of our soldiers. That had been the case with\r\nthese American negro soldiers.\r\n\r\nBut somewhere down in Washington, somehow or other, some one resurrected\r\nan old, large, heavy iron key and this, inserted into an ancient rusty\r\nlock, had opened some long forgotten doors in one of the Government\r\narsenals. There were revealed old dust-covered bundles wrapped up in\r\nnewspapers, yellow with age, and when these wrappings of the past were\r\nremoved, there were seen the uniforms of old Union blue that had been\r\nlaid away back in '65--uniforms that had been worn by men who fought and\r\nbled and died to free the first black American citizens.\r\n\r\nAnd here on this foreign shore, on this day in June more than half a\r\ncentury later, the sons and the grandsons of those same freed slaves\r\nwore those same uniforms of Union blue as they landed in France to fight\r\nfor a newer freedom.\r\n\r\nSome of these negroes were stevedores from the lower Mississippi levees.\r\nThey sang as they worked in their white army undershirts, across the\r\nchest of which they had penciled in blue and red, strange mystic\r\ndevices, religious phrases and hoodoo signs, calculated to contribute\r\nthe charm of safety to the running of the submarine blockade.\r\n\r\nTwo of these American negroes, walking up the main street of St.\r\nNazaire, saw on the other side of the thoroughfare a brother of colour\r\nwearing the lighter blue uniform of a French soldier. This French negro\r\nwas a Colonial black from the north of Africa and of course had spoken\r\nnothing but French from the day he was born.\r\n\r\nOne of the American negroes crossed the street and accosted him.\r\n\r\n\"Looka here, boy,\" he enquired good-naturedly, \"what can you all tell me\r\nabout this here wah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Comment, monsieur?\" responded the non-understanding French black, and\r\nfollowed the rejoinder with a torrent of excited French.\r\n\r\nThe American negro's mouth fell open. For a minute he looked startled,\r\nand then he bulged one large round white eye suspiciously at the French\r\nblack, while he inwardly debated on the possibility that he had become\r\nsuddenly colour blind. Having reassured himself, however, that his\r\nvision was not at fault, he made a sudden decision and started on a new\r\ntack.\r\n\r\n\"Now, never mind that high-faluting language,\" he said. \"You all just\r\ntell me what you know about this here wah and quit you' putting on\r\naihs.\"\r\n\r\nThe puzzled French negro could only reply with another explosion of\r\nFrench interrogations, coupled with vigorous gesticulations. The\r\nAmerican negro tried to talk at the same time and both of them\r\nendeavouring to make the other understand, increased the volumes of\r\ntheir tones until they were standing there waving their arms and\r\nshouting into one another's faces. The American negro gave it up.\r\n\r\n\"My Gawd,\" he said, shaking his head as he recrossed the street and\r\njoined his comrades, \"this is shore some funny country. They got the\r\nmos' ignorantest niggers I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nStill, those American blacks were not alone in their difficulties over\r\nthe difference in languages. I discussed the matter with one of our\r\nwhite regulars who professed great experience, having spent almost one\r\nentire day on mutual guard with a French sentry over a pile of baggage.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I don't believe these Frenchies ever will learn to\r\nspeak English.\"\r\n\r\nOur veterans from Mexico and the border campaigns found that their\r\nsmattering of Spanish did not help them much. But still every one seemed\r\nto manage to get along all right. Our soldiers and the French soldiers\r\nin those early days couldn't understand each other's languages, but they\r\ncould understand each other.\r\n\r\nThis strange paradox was analysed for me by a young American Lieutenant\r\nwho said he had made a twelve-hour study of the remarkable camaraderie\r\nthat had immediately sprung up between the fighting men of France and\r\nthe fighting men of America. In explaining this relationship, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You see, we think the French are crazy,\" he said, \"and the French know\r\ndamn well we are.\"\r\n\r\nThose of our men who had not brought small French and English\r\ndictionaries with them, made hurried purchases of such handy articles\r\nand forthwith began to practice. The French people did likewise.\r\n\r\nI saw one young American infantryman seated at a table in front of one\r\nof the sidewalk cafés on the village square. He was dividing his\r\nattention between a fervent admiration of the pretty French waitress,\r\nwho stood smiling in front of him, and an intense interest in the pages\r\nof his small hand dictionary.\r\n\r\nShe had brought his glass of beer and he had paid for it, but there\r\nseemed to be a mutual urge for further conversation. The American would\r\nlook first at her and then he would look through the pages of the book\r\nagain. Finally he gave slow and painful enunciation of the following\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\"Mad-am-moy-sell, donnie moy oon baysa.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed prettily as she caught his meaning almost immediately, and\r\nshe replied:\r\n\r\n\"Doughboy, ware do you get zat stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, Hell,\" said the young Infantryman, as he closed the book with a\r\nsnap. \"I knew they'd let those sailors ashore before us.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the very first day of the landing we began to learn things from the\r\nFrench and they began to learn things from us. Some of our men learned\r\nthat it was quite possible to sip an occasional glass of beer or light\r\nwine without feeling a sudden inclination to buy and consume all there\r\nremained in the café.\r\n\r\nThe French soldiers were intensely interested in the equipment of our\r\nland forces and in the uniforms of both our soldiers and sailors. They\r\nsought by questions to get an understanding of the various insignia by\r\nwhich the Americans designated their rank.\r\n\r\nOne thing that they noticed was a small, round white pasteboard tag\r\nsuspended on a yellow cord from the upper left hand breast pocket of\r\neither the blue jackets of our sailors or the khaki shirts of our\r\nsoldiers. So prevalent was this tag, which in reality marked the wearer\r\nas the owner of a package of popular tobacco, that the French almost\r\naccepted it as uniform equipment.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of our first arriving American soldiers toward the German\r\nprisoners who worked in gangs on construction work in the camps and\r\nrough labour along the docks was a curious one. Not having yet\r\nencountered in battle the brothers of these same docile appearing\r\ncaptives, our men were even inclined to treat the prisoners with\r\ndeference almost approaching admiration.\r\n\r\nIn a measure, the Germans returned this feeling. The arrival of the\r\nAmericans was really cheering to them. The prisoners disliked the French\r\nbecause they had been taught to do so from childhood. They hated the\r\nEnglish because that was the hate with which they went into battle.\r\n\r\nIt sounds incongruous now but, nevertheless, it was a fact then that the\r\nGerman prisoners confined at that first American sea-base really seemed\r\nto like the American soldiers. Maybe it was because any change of\r\nmasters or guards was a relief in the uneventful existence which had\r\nbeen theirs since the day of their capture. Perhaps the feeling was one\r\nof distinct kindred, based on a familiarity with Americans and American\r\ncustoms--a familiarity which had been produced by thousands of letters\r\nwhich Germans in America had written to their friends in Germany before\r\nthe war. On the other hand, it may simply have been by reason of\r\nAmerica's official disavowal of any animosity toward the German people.\r\n\r\nOne day I watched some of those prisoners unloading supplies at one of\r\nthe docks in St. Nazaire, more or less under the eyes of an American\r\nsentry who stood nearby. One group of four Germans were engaged in\r\ncarrying what appeared to be a large wooden packing case. Casually, and\r\nas if by accident, the case was dropped to the ground and cracked.\r\n\r\nInstantly one of the prisoners' hands began to furtively investigate the\r\npackages revealed by the break. The other prisoners busied themselves as\r\nif preparing to lift the box again. The first German pulled a spoon from\r\nhis bootleg, plunged it into the crevice in the broken box and withdrew\r\nit heaped with granulated sugar. With a quick movement he conveyed the\r\nstolen sweet to his mouth and that gapping orifice closed quickly on the\r\nsugar, while his stoical face immediately assumed its characteristic\r\ndowncast look. He didn't dare move his lips or jaws for fear of\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nOf course these Germans had been receiving but a scant ration of sugar,\r\nbut their lot had been no worse than that of the French soldiers\r\nguarding them previously, who got no sugar either. American soldiers\r\nthen guarding those prisoners reported only a few of them for\r\nconfinement for these human thefts.\r\n\r\nSurreptitiously, the American guards would sometimes leave cigarettes\r\nwhere the prisoners could get them, and even though the action did\r\nviolate the rules of discipline, it helped to develop further the human\r\nside of the giver and the recipient and at the same time had the result\r\nof making the prisoners do more work for their new guards.\r\n\r\nIt should be specially stated that lenience could not and was not\r\nextended to the point of fraternisation. But the relationship that\r\nseemed to exist between the German prisoners and American soldiers at\r\nthat early date revealed undeniably the absence of any mutual hate.\r\n\r\nAround one packing case on the dock I saw, one day, a number of German\r\nprisoners who were engaged in unpacking bundles from America, and\r\npassing them down a line of waiting hands that relayed them to a freight\r\ncar. One of the Germans leaning over the case straightened up with a\r\nrumpled newspaper in his hand. He had removed it from a package. A look\r\nof indescribable joy came across his face.\r\n\r\n\"Deutscher, Deutscher,\" he cried, pointing to the Gothic type. The paper\r\nwas a copy of the New York _Staats-Zeitung_.\r\n\r\nThe lot of those prisoners was not an unhappy one. To me it seemed very\r\ndoubtful whether even a small percentage of them would have accepted\r\nliberty if it carried with it the necessity of returning to German\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nThose men knew what war was. They had crossed No Man's Land. Now they\r\nwere far back from the blazing front in a comparatively peaceful country\r\nbeyond the sound of the guns. If their lot at that time was to be\r\ncharacterised as \"war,\" then in the opinion of those Germans, war was\r\nnot what Sherman said it was.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude more resembled that of the unkissed spinster who was\r\ntaken captive when the invading army captured the town. She flung\r\nherself into the arms of the surprised commander of the invaders and\r\nsmilingly whispered, \"War is war.\"\r\n\r\nThe German prison camps at St. Nazaire were inspected by General\r\nPershing on the third day of the American landing when he, with his\r\nstaff, arrived from Paris. The General and his party arrived early in\r\nthe morning in a pouring rain. The American commander-in-chief then held\r\nthe rank of a Major General. In the harbour was the flagship of Rear\r\nAdmiral Gleaves.\r\n\r\nThere was no delay over the niceties of etiquette when the question\r\narose as to whether the Rear Admiral should call on the Major General or\r\nthe Major General should call on the Rear Admiral.\r\n\r\nThe Major General settled the subject with a sentence. He said, \"The\r\npoint is that I want to see him,\" and with no further ado about it\r\nGeneral Pershing and his staff visited the Admiral on his flagship.\r\nAfter his inspection of our first contingent, General Pershing said:\r\n\r\n  \"This is the happiest day of the busy days which I have spent in\r\n  France preparing for the arrival of the first contingent. To-day I\r\n  have seen our troops safe on French soil, landing from transports\r\n  that were guarded in their passage overseas by the resourceful\r\n  vigilance of our Navy.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, our task as soldiers lies before us. We hope, with the aid of\r\n  the French leaders and experts who have placed all the results of\r\n  their experience at our disposal, to make our forces worthy in skill\r\n  and in determination, to fight side by side in arms with the armies\r\n  of France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE SCHOOL OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nClip the skyline from the Blue Ridge, arch it over with arboreal vistas\r\nfrom the forests of the Oregon, reflect the two in the placid waters of\r\nthe Wisconsin--and you will have some conception of the perfect Eden of\r\nbeauty in which the first contingent of the American Expeditionary\r\nForces trained in France.\r\n\r\nBeckoning white roads curl through the rolling hills like ribbons of\r\ndental cream squeezed out evenly on rich green velour. Châteaux, pearl\r\nwhite centres in settings of emerald green, push their turrets and\r\nbastions above the mossy plush of the mountain side. Lazy little streams\r\nsilver the valleys with their aimless wanderings.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful looking garden of pastoral delight that United States\r\nsoldiers had picked out for their martial training ground. It was a\r\nsection whose physical appearance was untouched by the three years of\r\nred riot and roar that still rumbled away just a few miles to the north.\r\n\r\nThe training area was located in the Vosges, in east central France. By\r\ntrain, it was a nine-hour day trip from Paris. It was located about an\r\nhour's motor ride behind the front lines, which at that time were close\r\nto the north of the cities of Nancy and Toul.\r\n\r\nThe troops were billeted in a string of small villages that comprised\r\none side of the letter V. French troops and instructing officers\r\noccupied the other converging line of the letter. Between the two lines\r\nwas the area in which our men trained. Where the two lines converged\r\nwas the town of Gondercourt, the headquarters of Major General Seibert,\r\nthe Commander of the first American division in France.\r\n\r\nThe area had long since been stripped of male civilian population that\r\ncould be utilised for the French ranks. The war had taken the men and\r\nthe boys, but had left the old people and children to till the fields,\r\ntend the cattle, prune the hedges and trim the roads.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of our troops, the restful scene began to change.\r\nTreeless ridges carpeted with just enough green to veil the rocky\r\nformation of the ground began to break out with a superficial rash of\r\nthe colour of fresh earth. In rows and circles, by angles and zigzags,\r\nthe training trenches began to take form daily under the pick and shovel\r\nexercises of French and Americans working side by side.\r\n\r\nAlong the white roads, clay-coloured rectangles that moved evenly, like\r\nbrown caravans, represented the marching units of United States troops.\r\nThe columns of bluish-grey that passed them with shorter, quicker steps,\r\nwere companies of those tireless Frenchmen, who after almost three years\r\nof the front line real thing, now played at a mimic war of make-believe,\r\nwith taller and heavier novitiates.\r\n\r\nThose French troops were Alpine Chasseurs--the famous Blue Devils. They\r\nwore dark blue caps, which resemble tam o'shanters, but are not. They\r\nwere proud of the distinction which their uniform gave them. They were\r\nproud of their great fighting records. One single battalion of them\r\nboasted that of the twenty-six officers who led it into the first fight\r\nat the opening of the war, only four of them existed.\r\n\r\nIt was a great advantage for our men to train under such instructors.\r\nCorrespondents who had been along the fronts before America's entry\r\ninto the war, had a great respect for the soldierly capacity of these\r\nsame fighting Frenchmen; not only these sturdy young sons of France who\r\nwore the uniform, but the older French soldiers--ranging in age from\r\nforty to fifty-five years--who had been away to the fronts since the\r\nvery beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nWe had seen them many, many times. Miles upon miles of them, in the\r\nmotor trucks along the roads. Twenty of them rode in each truck. They\r\nsat on two side benches facing the centre of the trucks. They were men\r\nactually bent forward from the weight of the martial equipment strapped\r\nto their bodies. They seemed to carry inordinate loads--knapsacks,\r\nblanket roll, spare shoes, haversacks, gas masks, water bottles,\r\nammunition belts, grenade aprons, rifle, bayonet and helmet.\r\n\r\nMany of them were very old men. They had thick black eyebrows and wore\r\nlong black beards. They were tired, weary men. We had seen them in the\r\ncamions, each man resting his head on the shoulder of the man seated\r\nbeside him. The dust of the journey turned their black beards grey. On\r\nthe front seat of the camion a sleepless one handled the wheel, while\r\nbeside him the relief driver slept on the seat.\r\n\r\nThus they had been seen, mile upon mile of them, thousand upon thousand\r\nof them, moving ever up and down those roads that paralleled the six\r\nhundred and fifty miles of front from Flanders to the Alps--moving\r\nalways. Thus they had been seen night and day, winter and summer, for\r\nmore than three long years, always trying to be at the place where the\r\nenemy struck. The world knows and the world is thankful that they always\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\nIt was under such veteran instructors as these that our first Americans\r\nin France trained, there, in the Vosges, in a garden spot of beauty, in\r\nthe province that boasts the birthplace of Jeanne d'Arc. On the few\r\nleave days, many of our men, with permission, would absent themselves\r\nfrom camp, and make short pilgrimages over the hills to the little town\r\nof Domremy to visit the house in which the Maid of Orleans was born.\r\n\r\nOur men were eager to learn. I observed them daily at their training\r\ntasks. One day when they had progressed as far as the use of the New\r\nFrench automatic rifles, I visited one of the ranges to witness the\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\nJust under the crest of the hill was a row of rifle pits, four feet deep\r\nin the slaty white rock. On the opposite hill, across the marshy hollow,\r\nat a distance of two hundred yards, was a line of wooden targets,\r\npainted white with black circles. Poised at intervals on the forward\r\nedge of the pits were a number of automatic rifles of the type used by\r\nthe French army. An American soldier and a French soldier attended each\r\none, the former in the firing position and the latter instructing.\r\n\r\nThe rear bank of the pits was lined with French and American officers.\r\nThe order, \"Commence firing,\" was given, and white spurts of rock dust\r\nbegan dancing on the opposite hill, while splinters began to fly from\r\nsome of the wooden targets.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the firing trench a raw American recruit, who admitted\r\nthat he had never handled an automatic rifle before, flushed to his\r\nhat-brim and gritted his teeth viciously as his shots, registering ten\r\nfeet above the targets, brought forth laughter and exclamations from the\r\nFrench soldiers nearby. He rested on his gun long enough to ask an\r\ninterpreter what the Frenchmen were talking about.\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" the interpreter replied, \"that you belong to the\r\nanti-aircraft service.\"\r\n\r\nThe recruit tightened his grip on his rifle and lowered his aim with\r\nbetter results. At the end of his first fifty shots he was placing one\r\nin three on the target and the others were registering close in.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" came from a group of French officers at the other end of the\r\ntrench, where another American, older in the service, had signalised his\r\nfirst experiences with the new firearm by landing thirty targets out of\r\nthirty-four shots, and four of the targets were bull's-eyes. The French\r\ninstructors complimented him on the excellence of his marksmanship,\r\nconsidering his acknowledged unfamiliarity with the weapon.\r\n\r\nFurther along the depression, in another set of opposing trenches and\r\ntargets, a row of French machine guns manned by young Americans, sprayed\r\nlead with ear-splitting abandon, sometimes reaching the rate of five\r\nhundred shots a minute. Even with such rapidity, the Americans\r\nencountered no difficulties with the new pieces.\r\n\r\nFrench veterans, who for three years had been using those same guns\r\nagainst German targets, hovered over each piece, explaining in half\r\nFrench and half English, and answering in the same mixture questions on\r\nways and means of getting the best results from the weapons.\r\n\r\nHere a chasseur of the ranks would stop the firing of one American\r\nsquad, with a peremptory, \"Regardez.\" He would proceed with pantomime\r\nand more or less connected words, carrying the warning that firing in\r\nsuch a manner would result in jamming the guns, a condition which would\r\nbe fatal in case the targets in the other trenches were charging upon\r\nthe guns.\r\n\r\nThen he showed the correct procedure, and the Yanks, watchfully alert to\r\nhis every move, changed their method and signified their pleasure with\r\nthe expression of \"Trays beans,\" and \"Mercy's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it would have resulted in a quicker and possibly more\r\nunderstanding training if these Americans were instructed by British\r\nveterans instead of French?\" I asked an American Staff Officer, who was\r\nobserving the demonstration.\r\n\r\n\"I may have thought so at first,\" the officer replied, \"but not now. The\r\nexplanations which our men in the ranks are receiving from the French\r\nsoldiers in the ranks are more than word instructions. They are object\r\nlessons in which gesticulation and pantomime are used to act out the\r\nmovement or subject under discussion.\r\n\r\n\"The French are great actors, and I find that American soldiers\r\nunacquainted with the French language are able to understand the French\r\nsoldiers who are unacquainted with the English language much better than\r\nthe American officers, similarly handicapped, can understand the French\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\"I should say that some time would be lost if all of our troops were to\r\nbe trained by French soldiers, but I believe that this division under\r\nFrench tutelage will be better able to teach the new tactics to the new\r\ndivisions that are to follow than it would be if it had speedily passed\r\nthrough training camps like the British system, for instance, where it\r\nmust be taken for granted that verbal, instead of actual, instruction is\r\nthe means of producing a speeding up of training.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that our first American contingent in France was in training\r\nfor something more than service on the line. It rapidly qualified into\r\nan expert corps from which large numbers of capable American instructors\r\nwere later withdrawn and used for the training of our millions of men\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\nThis achievement was only accomplished by the exercise of strict\r\ndisciplinarian measures by every American officer in the then small\r\nexpedition. One day, in the early part of August, 1917, a whirlwind\r\nswept through the string of French villages where the first contingent\r\nwas training.\r\n\r\nThe whirlwind came down the main road in a cloud of dust. It sped on the\r\nfleeting tires of a high-powered motor which flew from its dust-grey\r\nhood a red flag with two white stars. It blew into the villages and out,\r\nthrough the billets and cook tents, mess halls, and picket lines. The\r\nwhirlwind was John J. Pershing.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief \"hit\" the training area early in the morning and\r\nhis coming was unannounced. Before evening he had completed a stern\r\ninspection which had left only one impression in the minds of the\r\ninspected, and that impression was to the effect that more snap and pep,\r\nmore sharpness and keenness were needed.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the inspection all of the officers of the\r\ncontingent were agreeing that the whirlwind visitation was just what had\r\nbeen needed to arouse the mettle and spirit in an organisation comprised\r\nof over fifty per cent. raw recruits. Many of the officers themselves\r\nhad been included in the pointed criticisms which the commander directed\r\nagainst the persons and things that met disfavour in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe night following that inspection or \"raid,\" as it was called, it\r\nwould have been safe to say that nowhere in the area was there a recruit\r\nwho did not know, in a manner that he would not forget, the correct\r\nposition of a soldier--the precise, stiff, snappy attitude to be\r\npresented when called to attention. The enlisted men whose heels did not\r\nclick when they met, whose shoulders slouched, whose chins missed the\r\nproper angle, whose eyes were not \"front\" during the inspection,\r\nunderwent embarrassing penalties, calculated to make them remember.\r\n\r\n\"Have this man fall out,\" General Pershing directed, as he stood before\r\na recruit whose attitude appeared sloppy; \"teach him the position of a\r\nsoldier and have him stand at attention for five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nOne company which had prided itself upon having some of the best\r\nembryonic bomb-throwers in the contingent, contributed a number of\r\nvictims to the above penalties, and as the General's train of\r\nautomobiles swirled out of the village, the main street seemed to be\r\ndotted with silent khaki-clad statues doing their five minute sentences\r\nof rigidity.\r\n\r\n\"What about your men's shoes?\" General Pershing asked a captain sharply,\r\nwhile he directed his eyes along a company line of feet whose casings\r\nseemed to be approaching the shabby.\r\n\r\n\"We need hobnails, sir,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Get them\"--the words snapped out from beneath Pershing's close-cropped\r\ngrey moustache. \"Requisition hobnails. Your men need them. Get them from\r\nthe quartermaster.\"\r\n\r\nThe American commander stepped into the darkness of a large stone-walled\r\nstable, which represented the billeting accommodations for ten American\r\nsoldiers. A dog curled in the doorway growled and showed its teeth. The\r\nGeneral stepped past the menacing animal, and without heeding its snarls\r\nclose to his heels, started questioning the sergeants in charge.\r\n\r\n\"Are any cattle kept in here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"Detail more men with brooms and have it aired thoroughly every day.\"\r\n\r\nObserved from a distance, when he was speaking with battalion and\r\nregimental commanders, the commander manifested no change of attitude\r\nfrom that which marked his whole inspection. He frequently employed his\r\ncharacteristic gesture of emphasis--the wadding of his left palm with\r\nhis right fist or the energetic opening and closing of the right hand.\r\nWhen the Pershing whirlwind sped out of the training area that night,\r\nafter the first American inspection in France, it left behind it a\r\nthorough realisation of the sternness of the work which was ahead of our\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe development of a rigid discipline was the American commander's first\r\nobjective in the training schedules which he ordered his staff to\r\ndevise. After this schedule had been in operation not ten days, I\r\nhappened to witness a demonstration of American discipline which might\r\nbe compared to an improved incident of Damocles dining under the\r\nsuspended sword at the feast of Dionysius.\r\n\r\nA battalion of American Infantry was at practice on one of the training\r\nfields. The grenade-throwing exercises had been concluded and the order\r\nhad been given to \"fall in\" preparatory to the march back to the camp.\r\n\r\nUpon the formation of the long company lines, end on end down the side\r\nof the hill, the order, \"attention,\" was sharply shouted bringing the\r\nmen to the rigid pose which permits the eyes to wander neither to the\r\nright nor to the left, above nor below, but straightforward.\r\n\r\nAs the thousand men stood there, rigid and silent, a sudden disturbance\r\ntook place in the sky above them. Shells began exploding up there. At\r\nthe same time the men in the ranks could distinctly hear the whirr and\r\nthe hum of aeroplane motors above them.\r\n\r\nAlmost every day reports had been received that German planes had evaded\r\nthe Allied aerial patrols along the front and had made long flights\r\nbehind our lines for the dual purposes of observing and bombing.\r\n\r\nAs the American battalion stood stiff and motionless, I knew that the\r\nthought was passing through the minds of every man there that here, at\r\nlast, was the expected visitation of the German flyers and that a\r\nterrific bomb from above would be the next event on the programme. The\r\nmen recognised the reports of the anti-aircraft guns blazing away, and\r\nthe sound of the motors suggested a close range target.\r\n\r\nThe sound seemed to indicate that the planes were flying low. The\r\nAmerican ranks knew that something was going on immediately above them.\r\nThey did not know what it was, but it seems needless to state that they\r\nwanted to know. Still the ranks stood as stiff as rows of clay-coloured\r\nstatues.\r\n\r\nAn almost irresistible impulse to look upward, a strong instinctive\r\nurging to see the danger that impended, and the stern regulations of\r\n\"eyes front\" that goes with the command \"attention,\" comprised the\r\nelements of conflict that went on in each of the thousand heads in that\r\nbattalion line.\r\n\r\nIn front of each platoon, the lieutenants and captains stood with the\r\nsame rigid eyes front facing the men. If one of the company officers had\r\nrelaxed to the extent of taking one fleeting upward glance, it is\r\ndoubtful whether the men could have further resisted the same\r\ninclination, but not a man shifted his gaze from the direction\r\nprescribed by the last command.\r\n\r\nOne plane passed closely overhead and nothing happened. Three more\r\nfollowed and still no bombs fell, and then the tense incident was closed\r\nby the calling out of the order of the march and, in squads of four, the\r\nbattalion wheeled into the road and marched back to billets.\r\n\r\nAs one company went by singing (talking was permitted upon the freedom\r\nof routstep), I heard one of the men say that he had thought all along\r\nthat the officers would not have made them stand there at attention if\r\nthe danger had not been over.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I knew, it was over,\" a comrade added. \"It was right over my\r\nhead.\" And in this light manner the men forgot the incident as they\r\nresumed their marching song.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. W. Hollenzollern of Potsdam put singing lessons in the\r\ncurriculum of his soldiers' training, a tremor of military giggling was\r\nheard around the world. But in August, 1914, when Mars smiled at the\r\nsight of those same soldiers, marching across the frontiers east, south\r\nand west, under their throaty barrage of \"Deutschland, Deutschland, Über\r\nAlles,\" the derisive giggles completely died out. It immediately became\r\na case of he who laughs first, lives to yodel.\r\n\r\nThe American forces then in training took advantage of this. They not\r\nonly began to sing as they trained, but they actually began to be\r\ntrained to sing. Numerous company commanders who had held strong\r\nopinions against this vocal soldiering, changed their minds and\r\nexpressed the new found conviction that the day was past when singing\r\narmies could be compared solely with male coryphées who hold positions\r\nwell down stage and clink empty flagons of brown October ale.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great idea,\" a company commander told me. \"We learned it from\r\nthe Blue Devils. They are the toughest set of undersized gentry that I\r\nhave run into in France. They have forearms as big as three-inch shells,\r\nand as hard. Their favourite pastime is juggling hand-grenades that\r\ncan't possibly explode unless they just lightly touch one another.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday we watched them, bared to the waist, as they went through\r\nthree hours of grenade and bombing practice that was the last word in\r\nstrenuosity. Keeping up with their exercises was hard work for our men,\r\nwhose arms soon began to ache from the unaccustomed, overhand heaving.\r\n\r\n\"Then we watched them as their commander assembled them for the march\r\nback to the village. At the command, 'attention,' their heels clicked,\r\ntheir heads went back, their chins up and their right hands were pasted\r\nrigidly against their right trouser leg.\r\n\r\n\"At the command 'march' all of them started off, punctuating their first\r\nstep with the first word of their marching song. It was not any sickly\r\nchorus either. There was plenty of beef and lung power behind every\r\nnote. My men lined up opposite were not missing a bit of it. Most of\r\nthem seemed to know what was expected when I said:\r\n\r\n\"'On the command of \"march,\" the company will begin to sing, keeping\r\nstep with the song. The first sergeant will announce the song.'\r\n\r\n\"My first sergeant responded without a change of colour as if the\r\ncommand to sing had been an old regulation. I knew that he was puzzled,\r\nbut he did it well. The name of the song chosen was passed down the line\r\nfrom man to man.\r\n\r\n\"When I gave the command to march, the company, almost half of them new\r\nrecruits, wheeled in squads of fours, and started off down the road\r\nsinging, 'Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here.' There were some who were\r\nkind of weak on the effort, but there was a noticeable crescendo when\r\nthe sergeant passed the word down the squad that the company would be\r\nkept marching until everybody had joined in the singing.\r\n\r\n\"We swung into camp that night with every voice raising lustily on 'One\r\nGrasshopper Hopped Right Over Another Grasshopper's Back,' and after\r\ndinner the billets just sprouted melody, everything from ragtime to\r\nChristmas carols and baby lullabies.\"\r\n\r\nOne noticeable characteristic about our soldiers during that training\r\nperiod before they had come in contact with the enemy, was a total\r\nabsence of violent antipathy toward all persons and things Teutonic.\r\n\r\nOn the march the men then sang \"We'll Hang the Damned Old Kaiser to a\r\nSour Apple Tree,\" but at that time I never heard any parodies on the\r\n\"Gott Straffe Germany\" theme. Our soldiers were of so many different\r\nnationalistic extractions and they had been thrown together for so short\r\na time, that as yet no especial hatred of the enemy had developed.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this very subject and also the manner in which our\r\nboys got along with the civilian populations of the towns they occupied\r\ncame to my notice.\r\n\r\nA driving rain which filled the valley with mist and made the hills look\r\nlike mountain tops projecting above the clouds, had resulted in the\r\nabandonment of the usual daily drills. The men had spent the day in\r\nbillets writing letters home, hearing indoor lectures from instructors,\r\nplaying with the French children in the cottage doorways, or taking\r\nlessons in French from the peasant girls, whose eyes were inspirations\r\nto the dullest pupils.\r\n\r\nI spent several hours in a company commander's quarters while he\r\ncensored letters which the men had submitted for transmission back home.\r\nThe Captain looked long at a letter in his hand, smiled and called for\r\nhis orderly.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Private Blank I want to see him here right away,\" were the\r\nCaptain's instructions. Blank's name was not quite so German as\r\nSourkraut, but it had a \"berger\" ending that was reminiscent of beer,\r\npretzels and wooden shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a letter written in German,\" said the Captain to me, referring\r\nto the open missive. \"It's addressed to somebody by the same name as\r\nBlank, and I presume it is to some one in his family. Blank is one of\r\nthe best men in my company, and I know that the letter is harmless, but\r\nit is impossible for me to pass it when written in an enemy language.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a tall, blonde enlisted man stepped in, shaking the\r\nrain from his hat. He stood at respectful attention, saluted and said:\r\n\r\n\"Did the Captain wish to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Blank, it is about this letter written in German,\" the Captain\r\nreplied. \"Who is it addressed to?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father, in Cincinnati, sir,\" Blank replied.\r\n\r\n\"I am unfamiliar with German,\" the Captain said. \"I notice the letter is\r\nbrief. Is there anything in it which the company has been ordered to\r\nomit mentioning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" Blank replied.\r\n\r\n\"Will you translate it for me?\" the Captain asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Blank, with just a bare suggestion of a blush. Then he\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Dear Father: I am in good health. Food is good and we are learning\r\n  much. I am becoming an expert grenadier. In this village where we\r\n  are billeted there is a French girl named Germain. Before the war\r\n  she lived in northern France, near the German frontier, and she\r\n  speaks German. So it is possible for us to talk together. She fled\r\n  before the German troops reached her village. She lives here now\r\n  with her aunt.\r\n\r\n  \"I carry water from a well for her and she has given me each day a\r\n  roll of fresh made butter for our mess. In the evening we sit on the\r\n  front seat of her uncle's small carriage, which is in the front\r\n  yard, and we imagine we are taking a drive, but of course there are\r\n  no horses. Her uncle's horses were taken by the army a long time\r\n  ago. She is very anxious to know all about America, and I have told\r\n  her all about you and mother and our home in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n  \"She asked me what I am going to do after the war, and I told her\r\n  that I would return to Cincinnati to help you at the store. She\r\n  cried because she said she did not know where she was going after\r\n  the war. Her father and two brothers have been killed and her aunt\r\n  and uncle are very old.\r\n\r\n  \"I have some more to write to you about Germain later. But must stop\r\n  here because the Sergeants are assembling the men for indoor\r\n  instruction. Love to all. It is raining very hard. Your son, ----\"\r\n\r\nBlank's face seemed to redden as he hesitated over a postscript line at\r\nthe bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n\"This is nothing,\" he said. \"I just asked father to ask mother to send\r\nme one of the photographs I had taken on the day I enlisted.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Germain?\" the Captain enquired, smilingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Blank.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you write this in English?\" the Captain asked.\r\n\r\n\"My father reads only German,\" Blank replied.\r\n\r\nBlank was instructed to rewrite his letter in English and address it to\r\nsome friend who could translate it into German for his father. As the\r\ndoor closed on this American soldier of German extraction, I asked the\r\nCaptain, \"Do you think Germain could stand for Blank's German name,\r\nafter all she has lost at the hands of the Germans?\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll probably be wearing it proudly around Cincinnati within a year\r\nafter the war is over,\" the Captain replied.\r\n\r\nIt might be reassuring at this point to remark that girls in America\r\nreally have no occasion to fear that many of our soldiers will leave\r\ntheir hearts in France. The French women are kind to them, help them in\r\ntheir French lessons, and frequently feed them with home delicacies\r\nunknown to the company mess stoves, but every American soldier overseas\r\nseems to have that perfectly natural hankering to come back to the girls\r\nhe left behind.\r\n\r\nThe soldier mail addressed daily to mothers and sweethearts back in the\r\nStates ran far into the tons. The men were really homesick for their\r\nAmerican women folks. I was aware of this even before I witnessed the\r\nreception given by our men to the first American nurses to reach the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nThe hospital unit to which they belonged had been transported into that\r\ntraining area so quickly and so secretly that its presence there was\r\nunknown for some time. I happened to locate it by chance.\r\n\r\nSeveral of us correspondents seeking a change of diet from the\r\nmonotonous menu provided by the hard-working madam of our modest\r\nhostelry, motored in a new direction, over roads that opened new vistas\r\nin this picture book of the world.\r\n\r\nLong straight avenues of towering trees whose foliage roofed the\r\nroadways were sufficient to reanimate recollections of old masters of\r\nbrush realism. Ploughed fields veiled with the low-hanging mist of\r\nevening time, and distant steeples of homely simplicity faintly glazed\r\nby the last rays of the setting sun, reproduced the tones of \"The\r\nAngelus\" with the over-generous hugeness of nature.\r\n\r\nAnd there in that prettiest of French watering places--Vittel--we came\r\nupon those first American nurses attached to the American Expeditionary\r\nForces. They told us that all they knew was the name of the place they\r\nwere in, that they were without maps and were not even aware of what\r\npart of France they were located in.\r\n\r\nIt developed that the unit's motor transportation had not arrived and,\r\nother automobiles being as scarce as German flags, communication with\r\nthe nearby camps had been almost non-existent. Orders had been received\r\nfrom field headquarters and acknowledged, but its relation in distance\r\nor direction to their whereabouts were shrouded in mystery. But not for\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nSoon the word spread through the training area that American nurses had\r\na hospital in the same zone and some of the homesick Yanks began to make\r\nthreats of self-mutilation in order that they might be sent to that\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe hospital unit was soon followed by the arrival of numerous American\r\nauxiliary organisations and the kindly activities of the workers as well\r\nas their numbers became such as to cause the men to wonder what kind of\r\na war they were in.\r\n\r\nI happened to meet an old top sergeant of the regular army, a man I had\r\nknown in Mexico, with the American Punitive Expedition. He had just\r\nreceived a large bundle of newspapers from home and he was bringing\r\nhimself up-to-date on the news. I asked him what was happening back\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"Great things are going on in the States,\" he said, looking up from his\r\npapers. \"Here's one story in the newspaper that says the Y. M. C. A. is\r\nsending over five hundred secretaries to tell us jokes and funny\r\nstories. And here's another account about the Red Cross donating half a\r\nmillion dollars to build recreation booths for us along the front. And\r\nhere's a story about a New York actor getting a committee of\r\nentertainers together to come over and sing and dance for us. And down\r\nin Philadelphia they're talking about collecting a million dollars to\r\nbuild tabernacles along the front so's Billy Sunday can preach to us.\r\nWhat I'm wondering about is, when in hell they're going to send the army\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nBut that was in the early fall of 1917, and as I write these lines now,\r\nin the last days of 1918, I am aware and so is the world, that in all of\r\nFrance nobody will ever ask that question again.\r\n\r\nThat army got there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMAKING THE MEN WHO MAN THE GUNS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile our infantry perfected their training in the Vosges, the first\r\nAmerican artillery in France undertook a schedule of studies in an old\r\nFrench artillery post located near the Swiss frontier. This place is\r\ncalled Valdahon, and for scores of years had been one of the training\r\nplaces for French artillery. But during the third and fourth years of\r\nthe war nearly all of the French artillery units being on the front, all\r\nsubsequent drafts of French artillerymen received their training under\r\nactual war conditions.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the French war department turned over to the Americans\r\nthis artillery training ground which had been long vacant. Three\r\nAmerican artillery regiments, the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh, comprising\r\nthe first U. S. Artillery Brigade, began training at this post.\r\n\r\nThe barracks had been long unoccupied and much preparatory work was\r\nnecessary before our artillerymen could move in. Much of this work\r\ndevolved upon the shoulders of the Brigade Quartermaster.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty that he encountered was the matter of illumination\r\nfor the barracks, mess halls and lecture rooms. All of the buildings\r\nwere wired, but there was no current. The Quartermaster began an\r\ninvestigation and this was what he found:\r\n\r\nThe post had been supplied with electricity from a generating plant\r\nlocated on a river about ten miles away. This plant had supplied\r\nelectrical energy for fifteen small French towns located in the\r\nvicinity. The plant was owned and operated by a Frenchman, who was\r\nabout forty years old. The French Government, realising the necessity\r\nfor illumination, had exempted this man from military service, so that\r\nhe remained at his plant and kept the same in operation for the benefit\r\nof the camp at Valdahon and the fifteen small towns nearby.\r\n\r\nThen the gossips of the countryside got busy. These people began to say\r\nthat Monsieur X, the operator of the plant, was not patriotic, in other\r\nwords, that he was a slacker for not being at the front when all of\r\ntheir menfolk had been sent away to the war.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Monsieur X was not a slacker, and his\r\ninclination had always been to get into the fight with the Germans, but\r\nthe Government had represented to him that it was his greater duty to\r\nremain and keep his plant in operation to provide light for the\r\ncountryside.\r\n\r\nWhen the talk of the countryside reached Monsieur X's ears, he being a\r\ncountry-loving Frenchman was infuriated. He denounced the gossips as\r\nbeing unappreciative of the great sacrifice he had been making for their\r\nbenefit, and, to make them realise it, he decided on penalising them.\r\n\r\nMonsieur X simply closed down his plant, locked and barred the doors and\r\nwindows, donned his French uniform and went away to the front to join\r\nhis old regiment. That night those villagers in the fifteen nearby\r\ntowns, who had been using electrical illumination, went to bed in the\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nIt required considerable research on the part of the Artillery\r\nQuartermaster to reveal all these facts. The electric lights had been\r\nunused for fifteen months when he arrived there, and he started to see\r\nwhat he could do to put the plant back to work. It required nothing\r\nless finally than a special action by the French Minister of War whereby\r\norders were received by Monsieur X commanding him to leave his regiment\r\nat the front and go back to his plant by the riverside and start making\r\nelectricity again.\r\n\r\nWith the lights on and water piped in for bathing facilities, and\r\nextensive arrangements made for the instalment of stoves and other\r\nheating apparatus, the purchase of wood fuel and fodder for the animals,\r\nthe Brigade moved in and occupied the camp.\r\n\r\nThe American officer in command of that post went there as a Brigadier\r\nGeneral. As I observed him at his work in those early days, I seemed to\r\nsee in his appearance and disposition some of the characteristics of a\r\nGrant. He wore a stubby-pointed beard and he clamped his teeth tight on\r\nthe butt end of a cigar. I saw him frequently wearing the $11.50\r\nregulation issue uniform of the enlisted men. I saw him frequently in\r\nrubber boots standing hip deep in the mud of the gun pits, talking to\r\nthe men like a father--a kindly, yet stern father who knew how to\r\nproduce discipline and results.\r\n\r\nWhile at the post, he won promotion to a Major General's rank, and in\r\nless than six months he was elevated to the grade of a full General and\r\nwas given the highest ranking military post in the United States. That\r\nman who trained our first artillerymen in France was General Peyton C.\r\nMarch, Chief of Staff of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nFinding the right man for the right place was one of General March's\r\nhobbies. He believed in military mobilisation based on occupational\r\nqualifications. In other words, he believed that a man who had been a\r\ntelephone operator in civilian life would make a better telephone\r\noperator in the army than he would make a gunner.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised to find that this same worthy idea had permeated in\r\na more or less similar form down to the lowest ranks in General March's\r\ncommand at that time. I encountered it one cold night in October, when I\r\nwas sitting in one of the barrack rooms talking with a man in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThat man's name was Budd English. I met him first in Mexico on the\r\nAmerican Punitive Expedition, where he had driven an automobile for\r\nDamon Runyon, a fellow correspondent. English, with his quaint\r\nSouthwestern wit, had become in Mexico a welcome occupant of the large\r\npyramidal tent which housed the correspondents attached to the\r\nExpedition. We would sit for hours hearing him tell his stories of the\r\nplains and the deserts of Chihuahua.\r\n\r\nEnglish and I were sitting on his bed at one corner of the barrack room,\r\nrows of cots ranged each side of the wall and on these were the snoring\r\nmen of the battery. The room was dimly illuminated by a candle on a\r\nshelf over English's head and another candle located on another shelf in\r\nthe opposite corner of the room. There was a man in bed in a corner\r\nreading a newspaper by the feeble rays of the candle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard him growl and tear the page of the newspaper in half.\r\nHis exclamation attracted my attention and I looked his way. His hair\r\nwas closely cropped and his head, particularly his ears and forehead,\r\nand jaw, stamped him as a rough and ready fighter.\r\n\r\n\"That's Kid Ferguson, the pug,\" English whispered to me, and then in\r\nlouder tones, he enquired, \"What's eating on you, kid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, this bunk in the paper,\" replied Ferguson. Then he glared at me\r\nand enquired, \"Did you write this stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"What stuff?\" I replied. \"Read it out.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson picked up the paper and began to read in mocking tones\r\nsomething that went as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it beautiful in the cold early dawn in France, to see our dear\r\nAmerican soldiers get up from their bunks and go whistling down to the\r\nstables to take care of their beloved animals.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\n\"The Kid don't like horses no more than I do,\" he said. \"Neither one of\r\nus have got any use for them at all. And here, that's all they keep us\r\ndoing, is tending horses. I went down there the other morning with a\r\nlantern and one of them long-eared babies just kicked it clean out of my\r\nhand. The other morning one of them planted two hoofs right on\r\nFerguson's chest and knocked him clear out of the stable. It broke his\r\nwatch and his girl's picture.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Mr. Gibbons, I never did have any use for horses. When I was\r\nabout eight years old a horse bit me. When I was about fifteen years old\r\nI got run over by an ice-wagon. Horses is just been the ruination of me.\r\n\r\n\"If it hadn't been for them I might have gone through college and been\r\nan officer in this here army. You remember that great big dairy out on\r\nthe edge of the town in El Paso? Well, my dad owned that and he lost all\r\nof it on the ponies in Juarez. I just hate horses.\r\n\r\n\"I know everything there is to know about an automobile. I have driven\r\ncross country automobile races and after we come out of Mexico, after we\r\ndidn't get Villa, I went to work in the army machine shops at Fort Bliss\r\nand took down all them motor trucks and built them all over again.\r\n\r\n\"When Uncle Sam got into the war against Germany, this here Artillery\r\nBattalion was stationed out at Fort Bliss, and I went to see the Major\r\nabout enlisting, but I told him I didn't want to have nothing to do with\r\nno horses.\r\n\r\n\"And he says, 'English, don't you bother about that. You join up with\r\nthis here battalion, because when we leave for France we're going to\r\nkiss good-bye to them horses forever. This here battalion is going to be\r\nmotorised.'\r\n\r\n\"And now here we are in France, and we still got horses, and they don't\r\nlike me and I don't like them, and yet I got to mill around with 'em\r\nevery day. The Germans ain't never going to kill me. They ain't going to\r\nget a chance. They just going to find me trampled to death some morning\r\ndown in that stable.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the occupants of nearby beds had arisen and taken seats\r\non English's bed. They joined the conversation. One red-headed\r\nyoungster, wearing heavy flannel underwear in lieu of pajamas, made the\r\nfirst contribution to the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I'm beefing about,\" he said. \"Here I've been in this\r\narmy two months now and I'm still a private. There ain't no chance here\r\nfor a guy that's got experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Experience? Where do you get that experience talk?\" demanded English.\r\n\"What do you know about artillery?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I mean, experience,\" the red-headed one replied with\r\nfire. \"I got experience. Mr. Gibbons knows me. I'm from Chicago, the\r\nsame as he is. I worked in Chicago at Riverview Park. I'm the guy that\r\nfired the gattling gun in the Monitor and Merrimac show--we had two\r\nshows a day and two shows in the evening and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Kin you beat that,\" demanded English. \"You know, if this here\r\nred-headed guy don't get promotion pretty quick, he's just simply going\r\nto quit this army and leave us flat here in France facing the Germans.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you about this gattling gun expert. When they landed us off\r\nof them boats down on the coast, the battalion commander turned us all\r\nloose for a swim in the bay, and this here bird almost drowned. He went\r\ndown three times before we could pull him out.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if they don't make him a Brigadier General pretty quick, he's\r\ngoing to get sore and put in for a transfer to the Navy on the grounds\r\nof having submarine experience. But he's right in one thing--experience\r\ndon't count for what it should in the army.\r\n\r\n\"Right here in our battery we got a lot of plough boys from Kansas that\r\nhave been sitting on a plough and looking at a horse's back all their\r\nlives, and they got them handling the machinery on these here guns. And\r\nme, who knows everything there is to know about machinery, they won't\r\nlet me even find out which end of the cannon you put the shell in and\r\nwhich end it comes out of. All I do all day long is to prod around a\r\ncouple of fat-hipped hayburners. My God, I hate horses.\"\r\n\r\nBut regardless of these inconveniences those first American artillerymen\r\nin our overseas forces applied themselves strenuously to their studies.\r\nThey were there primarily to learn. It became necessary for them at\r\nfirst to make themselves forget a lot of things that they had previously\r\nlearned by artillery and adapt themselves to new methods and instruments\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear of \"Swansant, Kansas\"? You probably won't find it on\r\nany train schedule in the Sunflower State; in fact, it isn't a place at\r\nall. It is the name of the light field cannon that France provided our\r\nmen for use against the German line.\r\n\r\n\"Swansant, Kansas\" is phonetic spelling of the name as pronounced by\r\nAmerican gunners. The French got the same effect in pronunciation by\r\nspelling the singular \"soixante quinze,\" but a Yankee cannoneer trying\r\nto pronounce it from that orthography was forced to call it a \"quince,\"\r\nand that was something which it distinctly was not.\r\n\r\nOne way or the other it meant the \"Seventy-fives\"--the \"Admirable\r\nSeventy-five\"--the seventy-five millimetre field pieces that stopped the\r\nGermans' Paris drive at the Marne--the same that gave Little Willie a\r\nheadache at Verdun,--the inimitable, rapid firing, target hugging, hell\r\nraising, shell spitting engine of destruction whose secret of recoil\r\nremained a secret after almost twenty years and whose dependability was\r\na French proverb.\r\n\r\nAt Valdahon where American artillery became acquainted with the\r\nSeventy-five, the khaki-clad gun crews called her \"some cannon.\" At\r\nseven o'clock every morning, the glass windows in my room at the post\r\nwould rattle with her opening barks, and from that minute on until noon\r\nthe Seventy-fives, battery upon battery of them, would snap and bark\r\naway until their seemingly ceaseless fire becomes a volley of sharp\r\ncracks which sent the echoes chasing one another through the dark\r\nrecesses of the forests that conceal them.\r\n\r\nThe targets, of course, were unseen. Range elevation, deflection, all\r\ncame to the battery over the signal wires that connected the firing\r\nposition with some observation point also unseen but located in a\r\nposition commanding the terrain under fire.\r\n\r\nA signalman sat cross-legged on the ground back of each battery. He\r\nreceived the firing directions from the transmitter clamped to his ears\r\nand conveyed them to the firing executive who stood beside him. They\r\nwere then megaphoned to the sergeants chief of sections.\r\n\r\nThe corporal gunner, with eye on the sighting instruments at the side of\r\neach gun, \"laid the piece\" for range and deflection. Number one man of\r\nthe crew opened the block to receive the shell, which was inserted by\r\nnumber two. Number three adjusted the fuse-setter, and cut the fuses.\r\nNumbers four and five screwed the fuses in the shells and kept the\r\nfuse-setter loaded.\r\n\r\nThe section chiefs, watch in hand, gave the firing command to the gun\r\ncrews, and number one of each piece jerked the firing lanyard at ten\r\nsecond intervals or whatever interval the command might call for. The\r\nfour guns would discharge their projectiles. They whined over the damp\r\nwooded ridge to distant imaginary lines of trenches, theoretical\r\ncross-roads, or designated sections where the enemy was supposed to be\r\nmassing for attack. Round after round would follow, while telephoned\r\ncorrections perfected the range, and burst. The course of each shell was\r\nclosely observed as well as its bursting effect, but no stupendous\r\nrecords were kept of the individual shots. That was \"peace time stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThese batteries and regiments were learning gunnery and no scarcity of\r\nshells was permitted to interfere with their education. One officer told\r\nme that it was his opinion that one brigade firing at this schooling\r\npost during a course of six weeks, had expended more ammunition than all\r\nof the field artillery of the United States Army has fired during the\r\nentire period since the Civil War. The Seventy-five shells cost\r\napproximately ten dollars apiece, but neither the French nor American\r\nartillery directors felt that a penny's worth was being wasted. They\r\nsaid cannon firing could not be learned entirely out of a book.\r\n\r\nI had talked with a French instructor, a Yale graduate, who had been two\r\nyears with the guns at the front, and I had asked him what in his\r\nopinion was the most disconcerting thing that could happen to effect the\r\nmorale of new gunners under actual fire. I wanted some idea of what\r\nmight be expected of American artillerymen when they made their initial\r\nappearance on the line.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the effect of counter battery fire, the effect on gun crews\r\nof asphyxiating gas, either that carried on the wind from the enemy\r\ntrenches or that sent over in gas shells. We considered the demoralising\r\ninfluences of aerial attacks on gun positions behind the line.\r\n\r\n\"They are all bad,\" my informant concluded. \"But they are expected. Men\r\ncan stand without complaint and without qualm any danger that is\r\ndirected at them by the foe they are fighting. The thing that really\r\nbothers, though, is the danger of death or injury from their own weapons\r\nor ammunition. You see, many times there is such a thing as a faulty\r\nshell, although careful inspection in the munitions plants has reduced\r\nthis danger to a percentage of about one in ten thousand.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of the war when every little tin shop all over the\r\nworld was converted into a munitions factory to supply the great need of\r\nshells, much faulty ammunition reached the front lines. Some of the\r\nshells would explode almost as soon as they left the gun. They are\r\ncalled shorts. The English, who had the same trouble, call them 'muzzle\r\nbursts.'\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the shell would explode in the bore of the cannon, in which\r\ncase the cannoneers were usually killed either by pieces of the shell\r\nitself or bits of the cannon. The gunners have to sit beside the cannon\r\nwhen it is fired, and the rest of the gun crew are all within eight feet\r\nof it. If there is an explosion in the breech of the gun, it usually\r\nwipes out most of the crew. A muzzle burst, or a breech explosion, is\r\none of the most disconcerting things that could happen in a battery.\r\n\r\n\"The other men in the battery know of course that a faulty shell caused\r\nthe explosion. They also know that they are firing ammunition from the\r\nsame lot. After that, as they pull the trigger on each shot, they don't\r\nknow whether the shell is going out of the gun all right or whether it\r\nis going to explode in the breech and kill all of them. That thought in\r\na man's mind when he pulls the firing lanyard, that thought in the minds\r\nof the whole crew as they stand there waiting for the crash, is\r\npositively demoralising.\r\n\r\n\"When it happens in our French artillery the cannoneers lose confidence\r\nin their pieces. They build small individual dugouts a safe ways back\r\nfrom the gun and extend the lanyard a safe distance. Then, with all the\r\ngun crew under cover, they fire the piece. This naturally removes them\r\nfrom their regular firing positions beside the pieces, reduces the\r\naccuracy and slows up the entire action of the battery. The men's\r\nsuspicions of the shells combined with the fear of death by their own\r\nweapons, which is greater than any fear of death at the hands of the\r\nenemy, all reduce the morale of the gun crews.\"\r\n\r\nNow, for an incident. A new shipment of ammunition had reached the post.\r\nThe caissons were filled with it. Early the following morning when the\r\nguns rumbled out of camp to the practice grounds, Battery X was firing\r\nin the open. At the third shot the shell from piece number two exploded\r\nprematurely thirty yards from the muzzle. Pieces three and four fired\r\nten and twenty seconds later with every man standing on his toes in his\r\nprescribed position.\r\n\r\nTen rounds later, a shell from number three gun exploded thirty feet\r\nafter leaving the bore. Shell particles buried themselves in the ground\r\nnear the battery. Piece number four, right next to it, was due to fire\r\nin ten seconds. It discharged its projectiles on the dot. The gun crews\r\nknew what they were up against. They were firing faulty ammunition. They\r\npassed whispered remarks but reloaded with more of the same ammunition\r\nand with military precision on the immediate command. Every man stuck to\r\nhis position. As each gun was fired the immediate possibilities were not\r\ndifficult to imagine.\r\n\r\nThen it happened.\r\n\r\n\"Commence firing,\" megaphoned the firing executive. The section chief of\r\nnumber one piece dropped his right hand as the signal for the discharge.\r\nThe corporal gunner was sitting on the metal seat in front of his\r\ninstruments and not ten inches to the left of the breech. Cannoneer\r\nnumber one of the gun crew occupied his prescribed position in the same\r\nlocation to the immediate right of the breech. Gunner number two was\r\nstanding six feet behind the breech and slightly to the left ready to\r\nreceive the ejected cartridge case. Gunner number three was kneeling\r\nover the fuse setter behind the caisson which stood wheel to wheel with\r\nthe gun carriage. Gunners four and five were rigid statues three feet\r\nback of him. Every man in the crew had seen the previous bursts of\r\ndangerous ammunition.\r\n\r\nNumber one's eye caught the descending hand of the section chief. He\r\npulled the lanyard.\r\n\r\nThere was an eruption of orange coloured flame, a deafening roar, a\r\ncrash of rendered steel, a cloud of smoke blue green, and yellow.\r\n\r\nA black chunk of the gun cradle hurtled backward through the air with a\r\nvicious swish. A piece of the bore splintered the wheels and buried\r\nitself in the ammunition caisson. Thick hunks of gun metal crumbling\r\nlike dry cake filled the air. The ground shook.\r\n\r\nThe corporal gunner pitched backward from his seat and collapsed on the\r\nground. His mate with fists buried in his steel seared eyes staggered\r\nout of the choking fumes. The rest of the crew picked themselves up in a\r\ndazed condition. Fifty yards away a horse was struggling to regain his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nEvery man in the three other gun crews knew what had happened. None of\r\nthem moved from their posts. They knew their guns were loaded with\r\nshells from the same lot and possibly with the same faults. No man knew\r\nwhat would happen when the next firing pin went home. The evidence was\r\nbefore them. Their eyes were on the exploded gun but not for long.\r\n\r\n\"Crash,\" the ten second firing interval had expired. The section chief\r\nof piece number two had dropped his hand. The second gun in the battery\r\nhad fired.\r\n\r\n\"Number two on the way,\" sang out the signalman over the telephone wire\r\nto the hidden observation station.\r\n\r\nTen seconds more for another gun crew to cogitate on whether disaster\r\nhung on the dart of a firing pin.\r\n\r\n\"Crash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Number three on the way.\"\r\n\r\nAnother ten seconds for the last section to wonder whether death would\r\ncome with the lanyard jerk.\r\n\r\n\"Crash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Number four on the way.\" Round complete. The signalman finished his\r\ntelephone report.\r\n\r\nFour horses drawing an army ambulance galloped up from the ravine that\r\nsheltered them. The corporal gunner, unconscious and with one leg\r\npulverised was lifted in. Two other dazed members of the crew were\r\nhelped into the vehicle. One was bleeding from the shoulder. The lead\r\nhorses swung about; the ambulance rattled away.\r\n\r\n\"Battery ready to fire. Piece number one out of action.\" It was the\r\nsignalman reporting over the wire to the observer.\r\n\r\nBattery X fired the rest of the morning and they used ammunition from\r\nthe same lot and every man knew what might happen any minute and every\r\nman was in his exact position for every shot and nobody happened to\r\nthink about hiding in a dugout and putting a long string on the firing\r\nlanyard.\r\n\r\nIt had been an unstaged, unconscious demonstration of nerve and grit and\r\nit proved beyond all question the capacity of American artillerymen to\r\nstand by the guns.\r\n\r\nThe gunner corporal told the nurse at his bedside how it all happened,\r\nbut he was still under the effects of the anesthetic. He did not refer\r\nto the morale of his battery mates because it had not occurred to him\r\nthat there was anything unusual in what they did. But he did think that\r\nhe could wiggle the toes on his right leg. The doctor told me that this\r\nwas a common delusion before the patient had been informed of the\r\namputation.\r\n\r\nIncidents such as the one related had no effect whatever upon the\r\nprogress of the work. From early dawn to late at night the men followed\r\ntheir strenuous duties six days a week and then obtained the necessary\r\nrelief on the seventh day by trips down to the ancient town of Besançon.\r\n\r\nIn this picturesque country where countless thousands fought and died,\r\ndown through the bloody centuries since and before the Christian era,\r\nwhere Julius Cæsar paused in his far flung raids to dictate new inserts\r\nto his commentaries, where kings and queens and dukes and pretenders\r\nleft undying traces of ambition's stormy urgings, there it was that\r\nAmerican soldiers, in training for the war of wars, spent week-end\r\nholidays and mixed the breath of romance with the drag of their\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe extender of Roman borders divided that region into three parts,\r\naccording to the testimony of the first Latin class, but he neglected to\r\nmention that of these three parts the one decreed for American\r\noccupation was the most romantic of them all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is late on a Saturday afternoon and I accept the major's offer of a\r\nseat in his mud-bespattered \"Hunka Tin.\" The field guns have ceased\r\ntheir roar for the day and their bores will be allowed to cool over\r\nSunday. Five per cent. of the men at the post have received the coveted\r\ntown leave.\r\n\r\nThey form a khaki fresco on the cab and sides of the giant commissary\r\ntrucks that raise the dust along the winding white road over the hills.\r\nSnorting motorcycles with two men over the motor and an officer in the\r\nside car skim over the ground, passing all others. A lukewarm sun\r\ndisappears in a slot in the mountains and a blue grey mist forms in the\r\nvalleys. A chill comes over the air and a cold new moon looks down and\r\nlaughs.\r\n\r\nIt is a long ride to the ancient town, but speed laws and motor traps\r\nare unknown and the hood of the Detroit Dilemma shakes like a wet dog as\r\nher sizzling hot cylinders suck juice from a full throttle. We cross one\r\ndivide through a winding road bordered by bushy trees and as orderly as\r\na national park. We coast through a hillside hamlet of barking dogs and\r\nsaluting children who stand at smiling attention and greet our passage\r\nwith a shrill \"Veev La Mereek\" (Vive l'Amérique).\r\n\r\nWe scud across a broad, level road built well above the lowland, and\r\nclimb through zig-zagging avenues of stately poplars to the tunnel that\r\npierces the backbone of the next ridge.\r\n\r\nWhile the solid rock walls of the black bore reverberate with the echoes\r\nfrom our exhaust, we emerge on a road that turns sharply to the left and\r\nhugs a cliff. Below winds a broad river that looks like mother of pearl\r\nin the moonlight. The mountain walls on either side rise at angles\r\napproximating 45 degrees, and in the light their orderly vineyards look\r\nlike the squares on a sloping checkerboard. In front of us and to the\r\nright the flanking ridges converge to a narrow gorge through which the\r\nriver Doub runs to loop the town.\r\n\r\nCommanding this gorge from the crests of the two rocky heights are\r\nsinister sentinels whose smooth, grey walls and towers rise sheer from\r\nthe brink of the cliffs. The moonlight now catching the ramparts of the\r\nem-battlements splashes them with strokes of white that seem ever\r\nbrighter in contrast with the darker shadows made by projecting portions\r\nof the walls. Spaniard and Moor knew well those walls, and all the\r\nkingly glory that hurried France to the reign of terror has slept within\r\ntheir shadows.\r\n\r\nOur way down the cliff side is hewn out of the beetling rock. To our\r\nleft, a jagged wall of rock rises to the sky. To our right, a step,\r\nrock-tumbled declivity drops to the river's edge.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight brings funny fancies, and our yellow headlights, wavering\r\nin concentric arcs with each turn of the course, almost seem to glint on\r\nthe helmets and shields of the spear-bearing legionaries that marched\r\nthat very way to force a southern culture on the Gauls. We slow down to\r\npass through the rock-hewn gate that once was the Roman aqueduct\r\nbringing water down from mountain springs to the town.\r\n\r\nThrough the gate, a turn to the left and we reach the black bottom of\r\nthe gorge untouched by the rising moon. We face a blast of wind that\r\nslows our speed and brings with it the first big drops of rain. We stop\r\nat the \"Octroi\" and assure the customs collector that we are military,\r\nand that we carry no dutiable wine, or beans or wood into the town.\r\n\r\nYet another gate, built across the narrow road between the cliff and the\r\nriver, and we enter the town. It has been raining and the cobblestones\r\nare slippery. They shine in the gleams of pale light that come from the\r\ntop-heavy street lamps. Gargoyle water spouts drip drainage from the\r\ngables of moss-speckled tiles.\r\n\r\nWe pass a fountain that the Romans left, and rounded arches further on\r\nshow where the hooded Moor wrote his name in masonry. Barred windows and\r\nstone balconies projecting over the street take one's mind off the\r\nrattling motor and cause it to wander back to times when serenading\r\nlovers twanged guitars beneath their ladies' windows and were satisfied\r\nwith the flower that dropped from the balcony.\r\n\r\nThe streets are wet and dark now and through their narrow windings our\r\nheadlights reveal tall figures in slickers or khaki overcoats topped by\r\npeaked felt hats with the red cords of American artillerymen. Their\r\nidentification is a surprise to the dreamer, because one rather expects\r\nthese figures to sulk in the deeper shadows and screen their dark,\r\nbearded faces with the broad brims of black felt hats or muffle\r\nthemselves to the chin in long, flowing black cloaks that hide rapiers\r\nand stilettos and other properties of mediæval charm.\r\n\r\nWe dine in a room three hundred years old. The presence of our\r\nautomobile within the inner quadrangle of the ancient building jars on\r\nthe sense of fitness. It is an old convent, now occupied by irreligious\r\ntenants on the upper three floors, restaurants and estaminets on the\r\nlower floor. These shops open on a broad gallery, level with the\r\ncourtyard, and separated from it only by the rows of pillars that\r\nsupport the arches. It extends around the four sides of the court.\r\n\r\nCenturies ago shrouded nuns, clasping beads or books of office, walked\r\nin uncommunicative pairs and mumbled their daily prayers beneath these\r\ntime-worn arches, and to-night it affords a promenade for officers\r\nwaiting for their meals to be served at madame's well laid tables\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nMadame's tables are not too many. There is not the space economy of an\r\nAmerican café, where elbows interlock and waiters are forced to navigate\r\nfearsome cargoes above the diners' heads. Neither is there the\r\nunwholesome, dust-filled carpet of London's roast beef palaces.\r\n\r\nMadame's floor is bare, but the wood has stood the scrubbings of years,\r\nand is as spotless as grass-dried linen. The high ceiling and the walls\r\nare of white stucco. In bas-relief are clusters of heraldic signs, of\r\nbishops' crooks and cathedral keys, of mounted chargers and dying\r\ndragoons, of miter and crown, and trumpet and shield, and cross.\r\n\r\nLarge mirrors, circled with wreaths of gilded leaves, adorn both end\r\nwalls, and beneath one of them remains an ornate fireplace and\r\nmantelpiece of bologna coloured marble, surmounted with a gilt cock of\r\nwondrous design. Beneath the other mirror madame has placed her buffet,\r\non which the boy who explores the dusty caves below places the cobwebbed\r\nbottles of red wine for the last cork pulling. Large gold chandeliers,\r\ndangling with glass prisms, are suspended from high ceiling and flood\r\nthe room with light, against which the inner shutters of the tall\r\nwindows must be shut because of danger from the sky.\r\n\r\nThere is colour in that room. The Roman conquerors would have found it\r\ninteresting. If former armed occupants of the old town could have\r\nparaded in their ancient habiliments through the room like a procession\r\nfrom the martial past, they would have found much for their attention in\r\nthis scene of the martial present. American khaki seems to predominate,\r\nalthough at several tables are Canadian officers in uniforms of the same\r\ncolour but of different tailoring.\r\n\r\nThe tables are flecked with all varieties of French uniforms, from\r\nscarlet pants with solitary black stripes down the leg, to tunics of\r\nhorizon blue. In one corner there are two turbaned Algerians with heads\r\nbent close over their black coffee, and one horn of the hall rack shows\r\na red fez with a gold crescent on the crown.\r\n\r\nConsider the company. That freckle-faced youth with the fluffed reddish\r\nhair of a bandmaster is a French aviator, and among the row of\r\ndecorations on his dark blue coat is one that he received by reason of a\r\nwell known adventure over the German lines, which cannot be mentioned\r\nhere. That American colonel whose short grey hair blends into the white\r\nwall behind him is a former member of the United States war college and\r\none of the most important factors in the legislation that shaped the\r\npresent military status of his country. That other Frenchman with the\r\nunusual gold shoulder straps is not a member of the French army. He is\r\na naval officer, and the daring with which he carried his mapping chart\r\nalong exposed portions of the line at Verdun and evolved the\r\nmathematical data on which the French fired their guns against the\r\nGerman waves has been the pride of both the navy and the army.\r\n\r\nOver there is a young captain who this time last year was a \"shavetail\"\r\nsecond in command at a small post along the line of communications in\r\nChihuahua. Next to him sits a tall dark youngster wearing with pride his\r\nfirst Sam Browne belt and \"U. S. R.\" on his collar. He carted human\r\nwreckage to the hospitals on the French front for two years before Uncle\r\nSam decided to end the war. There's another one not long from the\r\n\"Point,\" booted and spurred and moulded to his uniform. He speaks with a\r\ntwang of old Virginia on every syllable and they say his family--but\r\nthat has nothing to do with the fact that he is aid to a major general\r\nand is in these parts on a mission.\r\n\r\nThere are three American women in the room. One who is interested in Y.\r\nM. C. A. work and a number of newspapers, wears a feminine adaptation of\r\nthe uniform and holds court at the head of a table of five officers.\r\nAnother, Mrs. Robert R. McCormick, who is engaged in the extension of\r\nthe canteen work of a Paris organisation, is sitting at our table and\r\nshe is willing to wager her husband anything from half a dozen gloves to\r\na big donation check that Germany will be ready for any kind of peace\r\nbefore an American offensive in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the other American woman are negative. She professes no\r\nconcern in the fact that war correspondents' life insurances are\r\ncancelled, but she repeats to me that a dead correspondent is of no use\r\nto his paper, and I reply that if madame puts yet another one of her\r\ncourses on the board, one correspondent will die with a fork in his hand\r\ninstead of a pencil.\r\n\r\nThe diners are leaving. Each opening of the salon door brings in a gust\r\nof dampness that makes the tablecloths flap. Rain coats swish and rustle\r\nin the entry. Rain is falling in sheets in the black courtyard. The moon\r\nis gone.\r\n\r\nA merry party trails down the stone gallery skirting the quadrangle.\r\nTheir hobnailed soles and steel plated heels ring on the stone flags.\r\nThe arches echo back their song:\r\n\r\n    \"In days of old\r\n    A warrior bold\r\n    Sang merrily his lay, etc. etc. etc.\r\n    My love is young and fair.\r\n    My love has golden hair,\r\n    So what care I\r\n    Though death be nigh, etc. etc. etc.\"\r\n\r\nWith frequent passages where a dearth of words reduce the selection to\r\nmusical but meaningless ta-de-ta-tas, the voices melt into the blackness\r\nand the rain.\r\n\r\n\"Great times to be alive,\" I say to the wife. \"This place is saturated\r\nwith romance. I don't have to be back to the post until to-morrow night.\r\nWhere will we go? They are singing 'Carmen' in the old opera house on\r\nthe square. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a Charlie Chaplin on the programme next to the hotel,\" the wife\r\nreplies.\r\n\r\nRomance was slapped with a custard pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\"FRONTWARD HO!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the artillery training had proceeded to such a point that the\r\nFrench instructors were congratulating our officers upon their\r\nproficiency, the rumours spread through the post that the brigade had\r\nbeen ordered to go to the front--that we were to be the first American\r\nsoldiers to actually go into the line and face the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe news was received with joy. The men were keen to try out their newly\r\nacquired abilities upon the enemy. Harness was polished until it shone.\r\nBrass equipment gleamed until you could almost see your face in it. The\r\nmen groomed the horses until the animals got pains from it. Enlisted men\r\nsojourning in the Guard House for petty offences, despatched their\r\nguards with scrawled pleadings that the sentences be changed to fines so\r\nthat they could accompany the outfits to the front.\r\n\r\nWith one special purpose in view, I made application to General March\r\nfor an assignment to Battery A of the Sixth Field Artillery. I received\r\nthe appointment. The Sixth was the first regiment of the brigade and A\r\nwas the first battery of the regiment. I knew that we would march out in\r\nthat order, that Battery A would entrain first, detrain first, go in the\r\nline first, and I hoped to be present at the firing of the first\r\nAmerican shot in the war.\r\n\r\nWe pulled out of the post on schedule time early in the morning, two\r\ndays later. Officers and men had been up and dressed since midnight. Ten\r\nminutes after their arising, blankets had been rolled and all personal\r\nequipment packed ready for departure with the exception of mess kits.\r\n\r\nWhile the stable police details fed the horses, the rest of us \"leaned\r\nup against\" steak, hot biscuits, syrup and hot coffee. The cook had been\r\non the job all night and his efforts touched the right spot. It seemed\r\nas if it was the coldest hour of the night and the hot \"chow\" acted as a\r\nprimer on the sleepy human machines.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness, the animals were packed into the gun carriages and\r\ncaissons down in the gun park, and it was 4 A. M. on the dot when the\r\ncaptain's whistle sounded and we moved off the reserve. As we rattled\r\nover the railroad crossing and took the road, the men made facetious\r\ngood-byes to the scene of their six weeks' training.\r\n\r\nSoldiers like movement--we were on the move. Every one's spirits were up\r\nand the animals were frisky and high-stepping in the brisk air. Chains\r\nrattled as some of the lead pairs mussed up the traces and were brought\r\nback into alignment by the drivers. The cannoneers, muffled in great\r\ncoats, hung on the caisson seats and chided the drivers.\r\n\r\nWe were off. Where we were going, seemed to make no difference. Rumours\r\ncould never be depended upon, so none of us knew our destination, but\r\nall of us hoped that we were going into action. Every man in the battery\r\nfelt that the schooling was over and that the battery, if given a\r\nchance, could prove that it needed no further training.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, some of the men expressed the fear that we were on our\r\nway to some other training camp for some post-graduate course in firing\r\nor maybe for the purpose of instructing other less advanced batteries.\r\nThe final consensus of opinion was, however, that \"beefing\" about our\r\nprospects wouldn't change them, and that anything was better than\r\nstaying in the same place forever.\r\n\r\nTwo miles from the post the road crossed the railroad tracks. The\r\ncrossing bore a name as everything else did in that land of poetical\r\nnomenclature. There was only one house there. It was an old grey stone\r\ncottage, its walls covered with vines, and its garden full of shrubbery.\r\nIt was occupied by three persons, the old crossing-tender, his wife--and\r\none other. That other was Jeanne. Jeanne was their daughter.\r\n\r\nWe had seen her many times as she opened the crossing gates for traffic\r\non the road. She was about sixteen years old. Her ankles were encased in\r\nthick grey woollen hose of her own knitting and, where they emerged from\r\nher heavy wooden shoes, it looked as if every move in her clumsy\r\nfootgear might break them off.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the crossing, Gallagher, who rode one of the lead pair\r\non piece No. 2, began to give vent to his fine Irish tenor. Gallagher\r\nwas singing:\r\n\r\n    \"We were sailing along\r\n    On Moonlight bay,\r\n    You could hear the voices ringing,\r\n    They seemed to say,\r\n    'You have stolen my heart\r\n    Now, don't go away,'\r\n    As we kissed and said good-bye\r\n    On Moonlight bay.\"\r\n\r\nIt would almost have seemed that there was need of some explanation for\r\nGallagher's musical demonstration on this cold, dark morning, but none\r\nwas demanded. Gallagher apparently knew what he was doing.\r\n\r\nHis pair of lead horses were walking in much too orderly a fashion for\r\nthe occasion. Apparently the occasion demanded a little greater show of\r\ndash and spirit. Gallagher sunk his spurs into the flanks of his mount\r\nand punched its mate in the ribs with the heavy handle of his riding\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe leads lunged forward against their collars. The sudden plunge was\r\naccompanied by a jangle of chains as the traces tightened. The gun\r\ncarriage jolted and the cannoneers swore at the unnecessary bouncing.\r\n\r\n\"Easy, Zigg-Zigg, whoa, Fini.\" Gallagher pulled on the lines as he\r\nshouted in a calculated pitch the French names of his horses. And then\r\nthe reason for Gallagher's conduct developed.\r\n\r\nA pair of wooden shutters on a first floor window of the gate-tender's\r\ncottage opened outward. In the window was a lamp. The yellow rays from\r\nit shone upward and revealed a tumbled mass of long black hair, black\r\neyes that gleamed, red cheeks and red lips. Then a sweet voice said:\r\n\r\n\"Gude-bye, Meeky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Orry wore, Jeen,\" replied Gallagher.\r\n\r\n\"_Après la guerre_, Meeky,\" said Jeanne.\r\n\r\n\"Orry wore, Jeen,\" repeated Gallagher.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jeanie, dear, please call me 'Meeky,'\" sang out one of the men,\r\nastride one of the wheel pair of the same gun.\r\n\r\nThe window had closed, but before the light disappeared, black eyes\r\nflashed hate at the jester, and Gallagher, himself, two horses ahead,\r\nturned in the saddle and told the taunter to shut his mouth, observing\r\nat the same time that \"some guys didn't know a decent girl when they saw\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nWe rode on. Soon, on the left, the sun came up cold out of\r\nSwitzerland's white topped ridges miles away, and smiling frigidly\r\nacross the snow-clad neutral Alps, dispelled the night mist in our part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe battery warmed under its glow. Village after village we passed\r\nthrough, returning the polite salutes of early rising grand-sires who\r\nuncovered their grey heads, or wrinkled, pink-faced grandmothers, who\r\nwaved kerchiefs from gabled windows beneath the thatch and smiled the\r\nstraight and dry-lipped smile of toothless age as they wished us good\r\nfortune in the war.\r\n\r\nWe messed at midday by the roadside, green fields and hills of France,\r\nour table decorations, cold beef and dry bread, our fare, with canteens\r\nfull to wash it down. When the horses had tossed their nose-bags\r\nfutilely for the last grains of oats, and the captain's watch had timed\r\nthe rest at three-quarters of the hour, we mounted and resumed the\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe equipment rode easy on man and beast. Packs had been shifted to\r\npositions of maximum comfort. The horses were still fresh enough to need\r\ntight rein. The men had made final adjustments to the chin straps on\r\ntheir new steel helmets and these sat well on heads that never before\r\nhad been topped with armoured covering. In addition to all other\r\nequipment, each man carried two gas masks. Our top sergeant had an\r\nexplanation for me as to this double gas mask equipment.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you about it,\" he said, as he ruthlessly accepted the\r\nnext-to-the-last twenty-five centime Egyptian cigarette from my\r\nproffered case. I winced as he deliberately tore the paper from that\r\nprecious fine smoke and inserted the filler in his mouth for a chew.\r\n\r\n\"You see, England and France and us is all Allies,\" he said. \"Both of\r\nthem loves us and we love both of them. We don't know nothing about gas\r\nmasks and they knows all there is to know about them. The French say\r\ntheir gas mask is the best. The British say their gas mask is the best.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, they both offer us gas masks. Now Uncle Sam don't want\r\nto hurt nobody's feelings, so he says, 'Gentlemen, we won't fight about\r\nthis here matter. We'll just use both gas masks, and give each of them a\r\ntry-out.'\r\n\r\n\"So here we are carrying two of these human nose-bags. The first time we\r\nget into a mess of this here gas, somebody will send the order around to\r\nchange masks in the middle of it--just to find out which is the best\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, with seeming malice, spat some of that fine cigarette on a\r\nroadside kilometer stone and closed the international prospects of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOur battery jangled through a tunnelled ridge and emerged on the other\r\nside just as a storm of rain and hail burst with mountain fury. The\r\nhailstones rattled on our metal helmets and the men laughed at the sound\r\nas they donned slickers. The brakes grated on the caisson wheels as we\r\ntook the steep down-grade. The road hugged the valley wall which was a\r\nrugged, granite cliff.\r\n\r\nI rode on ahead through the stinging hailstones and watched our battery\r\nas it passed through the historic rock-hewn gateway that is the entrance\r\nto the mediæval town of Besançon. The portal is located at a sharp turn\r\nof the river. The gateway is carved through a mountain spur. Ancient\r\ndoors of iron-studded oak still guard the entrance, but they have long\r\nsince stood open. Battlements that once knew the hand of Vaubon frown\r\ndown in ancient menace to any invader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPT.

GUN AND OTHERS OF ITS KIND WERE EDUCATING THE BOCHE TO\r\nRESPECT AMERICA. THE TRACTOR HAULS IT ALONG STEADILY AND SLOWLY, LIKE A\r\nSTEAM ROLLER]\r\n\r\nNo Roman conqueror at the head of his invading legions ever rode through\r\nthat triumphal arch with greater pride than rode our little captain\r\nat the head of his battery. Our little captain was in stature the\r\nsmallest man in our battery, but he compensated for that by riding the\r\ntallest horse in the battery.\r\n\r\nHe carried his head at a jaunty angle. He wore his helmet at a nifty\r\ntilt, with the chin strap riding between his underlip and his dimpled,\r\nupheld chin. He carried his shoulders back, and his chest out. The reins\r\nhung gracefully in his left hand, and he had assumed a rather\r\nmoving-picture pose of the right fist on his right hip. Behind him flew\r\nthe red guidon, its stirruped staff held stiffly at the right arm's\r\nlength by the battery standard bearer.\r\n\r\nBoth of them smiled--expansive smiles of pride--into the clicking lens\r\nof my camera. I forgave our little captain for his smile of pride. I\r\nknew that six weeks before that very day our little captain had fitted\r\ninto the scheme of civilian life as a machinery salesman from Indiana.\r\nAnd there that day, he rode at the head of his two hundred and fifty\r\nfighting men and horses, at the head of his guns, rolling down that road\r\nin France on the way to the front.\r\n\r\nIn back of him and towering upward, was that historic rock that had\r\nknown the tread and passage of countless martial footsteps down through\r\nthe centuries. Behind him, the gun carriages rattled through the\r\nfrowning portal. Oh, if the folks back on the Wabash could have seen him\r\nthen!\r\n\r\nWe wound through the crooked narrow streets of Besançon, our steel-tired\r\nwheels bounding and banging over the cobblestones. Townsfolk waved to us\r\nfrom windows and doorways. Old women in the market square abandoned\r\ntheir baskets of beet roots and beans to flutter green stained aprons in\r\nour direction. Our column was flanked by clattering phalanxes of\r\nwooden-shoed street gamins, who must have known more about our movements\r\nthan we did, because they all shouted, \"Gude-bye.\"\r\n\r\nSix weeks' familiarity between these same artillerymen on town leave and\r\nthese same urchins had temporised the blind admiration that caused them\r\nfirst to greet our men solely with shouts of \"_Vive les Américains_.\"\r\nNow that they knew us better, they alternated the old greeting with\r\nshouts of that all-meaning and also meaningless French expression, \"Oo\r\nla la.\"\r\n\r\nOur way led over the stone, spanned bridge that crossed the sluggish\r\nriver through the town, and on to the hilly outskirts where mounted\r\nFrench guides met and directed us to the railroad loading platform.\r\n\r\nThe platform was a busy place. The regimental supply company which was\r\npreceding us over the road was engaged in forcibly persuading the last\r\nof its mules to enter the toy freight cars which bore on the side the\r\nprinted legend, \"Hommes 40, Chevaux 8.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral arclights and one or two acetylene flares illuminated the scene.\r\nIt was raining fitfully, but not enough to dampen the spirits of the Y.\r\nM. C. A. workers who wrestled with canvas tarpaulins and foraged\r\nmaterials to construct a make-shift shelter for a free coffee and\r\nsandwich counter.\r\n\r\nTheir stoves were burning brightly and the hurriedly erected stove\r\npipes, leaning wearily against the stone wall enclosing the quay, topped\r\nthe wall like a miniature of the sky line of Pittsburgh. The boiling\r\ncoffee pots gave off a delicious steam. In the language of our battery,\r\nthe \"Whime say\" delivered the goods.\r\n\r\nDuring it all the mules brayed and the supply company men swore. Most\r\nhumans, cognizant of the principles of safety first, are respectful of\r\nthe rear quarters of a mule. We watched one disrespecter of these\r\nprinciples invite what might have been called \"mulecide\" with utter\r\ncontempt for the consequences. He deliberately stood in the dangerous\r\nimmediate rear of one particularly onery mule, and kicked the mule.\r\n\r\nHis name was \"Missouri Slim,\" as he took pains to inform the object of\r\nhis caress. He further announced to all present, men and mules, that he\r\nhad been brought up with mules from babyhood and knew mules from the\r\ntips of their long ears to the ends of their hard tails.\r\n\r\nThe obdurate animal in question had refused to enter the door of the car\r\nthat had been indicated as his Pullman. \"Missouri Slim\" called three\r\nother ex-natives of Champ Clark's state to his assistance. They\r\nfearlessly put a shoulder under each of the mule's quarters. Then they\r\ngrunted a unanimous \"heave,\" and lifted the struggling animal off its\r\nfeet. As a perfect matter of course, they walked right into the car with\r\nhim with no more trouble than if he had been an extra large bale of hay.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful mule handling in this here army,\" remarked a quiet,\r\nmild-mannered man in uniform, beside whom I happened to be standing. He\r\nspoke with a slow, almost sleepy, drawl. He was the new veterinarian of\r\nthe supply company, and there were a number of things that were new to\r\nhim, as his story revealed. He was the first homesick horse doctor I\r\never met.\r\n\r\n\"I come from a small town out in Iowa,\" he told me. \"I went to a\r\nveterinary college and had a nice little practice,--sorter kept myself\r\nso busy that I never got much of a chance to think about this here war.\r\nBut one day, about two months ago, I got a letter from the War\r\nDepartment down in Washington.\r\n\r\n\"They said the hoss doctor college had given them my name as one of the\r\ngraduates and the letter said that the War Department was making out a\r\nlist of hoss doctors. The letter asked me to fill out the blank and send\r\nit to Washington.\r\n\r\n\"'Joe,' my wife says to me, 'this here is an honour that the country is\r\npaying to you. The Government just wants the names of the patriotic\r\nprofessional citizens of the country.' So we filled out the blank and\r\nmailed it and forgot all about it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, about two weeks later, I got a letter from Washington telling me\r\nto go at once to Douglas, Arizona. It sorter scared the wife and me at\r\nfirst because neither of us had ever been out of Iowa, but I told her\r\nthat I was sure it wasn't anything serious--I thought that Uncle Sam\r\njust had some sick hosses down there and wanted me to go down and look\r\nthem over.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the wife put another shirt and a collar and an extra pair of\r\nsocks in my hand satchel along with my instruments and I kissed her and\r\nthe little boy good-bye and told them that I would hurry up and\r\nprescribe for the Government hosses and be back in about five days.\r\n\r\n\"Two days later I landed in Douglas, and a major shoved me into a\r\nuniform and told me I was commissioned as a hoss doctor lieutenant. That\r\nafternoon I was put on a train with a battery and we were on our way\r\neast. Six days later we were on the ocean. We landed somewhere in France\r\nand moved way out here.\r\n\r\n\"My wife was expecting me back in five days and here it is I've been\r\naway two months and I haven't had a letter from her and now we're moving\r\nup to the front. It seems to me like I've been away from Iowa for ten\r\nyears, and I guess I am a little homesick, but it sure is a comfort to\r\ntravel with an outfit that knows how to handle mules like this one\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\nThe supply company completed loading, and the homesick horse doctor\r\nboarded the last car as the train moved down the track. Our battery took\r\npossession of the platform. A train of empties was shunted into position\r\nand we began loading guns and wagons on the flat cars and putting the\r\nanimals into the box cars.\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion accompanied this operation. The horses seemed to\r\nhave decided scruples against entering the cars. It was dark and the\r\nrain came down miserably. The men swore. There was considerable kicking\r\non the part of the men as well as the animals.\r\n\r\nI noticed one group that was gathered around a plunging team of horses.\r\nThe group represented an entanglement of rope, harness, horses and men.\r\nI heard a clang of metal and saw the flash of two steel-shod hoofs. A\r\nlittle corporal, holding his head up with both hands, backed out of the\r\ngroup,--backed clear across the platform and sat down on a bale of hay.\r\n\r\nI went to his assistance. Blood was trickling through his fingers. I\r\nwashed his two scalp wounds with water from a canteen and applied first\r\naid bandages.\r\n\r\n\"Just my luck,\" I heard my patient mumbling as I swathed his head in\r\nwhite strips and imparted to him the appearance of a first-class front\r\nline casualty.\r\n\r\n\"You're lucky,\" I told him truthfully. \"Not many men get kicked in the\r\nhead by a horse and escape without a fractured skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't it,\" he said; \"you see for the last week I've been wearing\r\nthat steel helmet--that cast-iron sombrero that weighs so much it almost\r\nbreaks your neck, and two minutes before that long-legged baby kicked\r\nme, the tin hat fell off my head.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time our battery had been loaded, another battery was waiting to\r\nmove on to the platform. Our captain went down the length of the train\r\nexamining the halter straps in the horse cars and assuring himself of\r\nthe correct apportionment of men in each car. Then we moved out on what\r\ndeveloped to be a wild night ride.\r\n\r\nThe horse has been described as man's friend and no one questions that a\r\nhorse and a man, if placed out in any large open space, are capable of\r\ngetting along to their mutual comfort. But when army regulations and the\r\nrequirements of military transportation place eight horses and four men\r\nin the same toy French box car and then pat all twelve of them\r\nfiguratively on the neck and tell them to lie down together and sleep\r\nthrough an indefinite night's ride, it is not only probable, but it is\r\ncertain, that the legendary comradeship of the man and the horse ceases.\r\nThe described condition does not encompass the best understood relation\r\nof the two as travelling companions.\r\n\r\nOn our military trains in France, the reservations of space for the\r\nhuman and dumb occupants of the same car were something as follows: Four\r\nhorses occupied the forward half of the car. Four more horses occupied\r\nthe rear half of the car. Four men occupied the remaining space. The\r\neight four-footed animals are packed in lengthwise with their heads\r\ntowards the central space between the two side doors. The central space\r\nis reserved for the four two-footed animals.\r\n\r\nThen the train moves. If the movement is forward and sudden, as it\r\nusually is, the four horses in the forward end of the car involuntarily\r\nobey the rules of inertia and slide into the central space. If the\r\nmovement of the train is backward and equally sudden, the four horses in\r\nthe rear end of the car obey the same rule and plunge forward into the\r\ncentral space. On the whole, night life for the men in the straw on the\r\nfloor of the central space is a lively existence, while \"riding the\r\nrattlers with a horse outfit.\"\r\n\r\nOur battery found it so. I rode a number of miles that night sitting\r\nwith four artillerymen in the central space between the side doors which\r\nhad been closed upon orders. From the roof of the car, immediately above\r\nour heads, an oil lantern swung and swayed with every jolt of the wheels\r\nand cast a feeble light down upon our conference in the straw. We\r\noccupied a small square area which we had attempted to particularise by\r\nroping it off.\r\n\r\nOn either side were the blank surfaces of the closed doors. To either\r\nend were the heads of four nervous animals, eight ponderous hulks of\r\nsteel-shod horseflesh, high strung and fidgety, verging almost on panic\r\nunder the unusual conditions they were enduring, and subject at any\r\nminute to new fits of excitement.\r\n\r\nWe sat at their feet as we rattled along. I recalled the scene of the\r\nloose cannon plunging about the crowded deck of a rolling vessel at sea\r\nand related Hugo's thrilling description to my companions.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" observed Shoemaker, driver of the \"wheelers\" on No. 4 piece,\r\n\"Yeah, but there ain't no mast to climb up on and get out of the way on\r\nin this here boxcar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather take my chances with a cannon any day,\" said 'Beady' Watson,\r\ngunner. \"A cannon will stay put when you fix it. There's our piece out\r\non the flat car and she's all lashed and blocked. It would take a wreck\r\nto budge her off that flat. I wish the B. C. had let me ride with the\r\nold gun out there. It would be a little colder but a lot healthier. Try\r\nto go to sleep in here and you'll wake up with a horse sitting on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you suppose we are going anyway?\" asked Slater, fuse cutter in\r\nthe same section. \"I'm strong for travel, but I always like to read the\r\nprogram before we start to ramble. For all we know we might be on our\r\nway to Switzerland or Italy or Spain or Egypt or somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go up and ask the Captain?\" suggested Boyle, corporal in\r\ncharge of the car. \"Maybe the Colonel gave him a special message to\r\ndeliver to you about our dusty-nation. You needn't worry though. They\r\nain't going to bowl us out of France for some time yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we're just joy-riding around France,\" replied Slater, \"I hope\r\nwe stop over to feed the horses at Monte Carlo. I've heard a lot about\r\nthat joint. They say that they run the biggest crap game in the world\r\nthere, and the police lay off the place because the Governor of the\r\nState or the King or something, banks the game. They tell me he uses\r\nstraight bones and I figure a man could clean up big if he hit the game\r\non a payday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, kid, you've got this tip wrong,\" said Shoemaker. \"If there's\r\nanything happens to start a riot among these horses, you are going to\r\nfind that you're gambling with death. And if we ever get off this train,\r\nI think we have a date with Kaiser Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a cousin somewhere in the German army. He spells his\r\n'Shoemaker' with a 'u.' My dad told me that my grandfather and this\r\ncousin's grandfather had a business disagreement over a sauerkraut\r\nfactory some time before the Civil War and my grandfather left Germany.\r\nSince then, there ain't been no love lost between the branches of the\r\nfamily, but we did hear that Cousin Hans had left the sauerkraut\r\nbusiness and was packing a howitzer for the Kaiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope we come across him for your sake,\" said Watson. \"It's\r\nkinda tough luck to get cheated out of a big business like that, but\r\nthen you must remember that if your cousin's grandfather hadn't pulled\r\nthe dirty on your grandfather, your grandfather might never have gone to\r\nAmerica and most likely you'd still be a German.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess there's some sense in that, too,\" replied Shoemaker; \"wouldn't\r\nthat been hell if I'd been on the other side in this war? But anyhow, I\r\ndo hope we run into Cousin Hans somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe horses had been comparatively quiet for some time, but now they\r\nseemed to be growing restless. They pricked their ears and we knew\r\nsomething was bothering them. The discussion stopped so that we could\r\nlisten better.\r\n\r\nAbove the rattle of the train, there came to us the sound of firing. It\r\nseemed to come from the direction in which we were going. With\r\nsurprising quickness, the explosions grew louder. We were not only\r\nspeeding toward the sounds of conflict, but the conflict itself seemed\r\nto be speeding toward us.\r\n\r\nThen came a crash unmistakably near. One of the horses in the forward\r\nend reared, and his head thumped the roof of the car. Once again on four\r\nfeet, he pranced nervously and tossed his blood-wet forelock.\r\nImmediately the other horses began stamping.\r\n\r\nAnother crash!--this time almost directly overhead. In the light of the\r\nswinging lantern, I could see the terror in the eyes of the frightened\r\nbrutes. We clung to their halters and tried to quiet them but they\r\nlifted us off our feet.\r\n\r\n\"Put a twitch on that one's nose and hold him down,\" Boyle ordered.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh,\" said Slater, obeying, \"we must be right up on the front line.\r\nHope they don't stop this train in No Man's Land. Hold still, you crazy\r\nb----\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Hans must have heard you talking,\" Watson shouted to Shoemaker.\r\n\"Maybe you're going to see him quicker than you expected.\"\r\n\r\nThe train was slowing down. The brakes shrieked and grated as we came to\r\na jerky stop. Three of us braced ourselves at the heads of the four\r\nhorses in the rear of the car and prevented them from sliding on top of\r\nus. Boyle and Slater were doing their best to quiet the forward four.\r\nThe explosions overhead increased. Now we heard the report of field\r\npieces so close that they seemed to be almost alongside the track.\r\n\r\nThere came a sharp bang at one of the side doors, and I thought I\r\nrecognised the sound of the lead-loaded handle of the captain's riding\r\nwhip. His voice, coming to us a minute later above the trampling and\r\nkicking of the panic-stricken animals, verified my belief.\r\n\r\n\"Darken that lantern,\" he shouted. \"Keep all lights out and keep your\r\nhelmets on. Stay in the cars and hang on to the horses. There is an air\r\nraid on right above us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Boyle, and we heard the captain run to the next car.\r\nI blew out the light and we were in complete darkness, with eight\r\ntossing, plunging horses that kicked and reared at every crash of the\r\nguns nearby or burst of the shells overhead.\r\n\r\nWe hung on while the air battle went on above. One horse went down on\r\nhis knees and in his frantic struggles to regain his feet, almost kicked\r\nthe feet from under the animal beside him.\r\n\r\nAt times, thunderous detonations told us that aerial bombs were doing\r\ntheir work near at hand. We supposed correctly that we were near some\r\ntown not far behind the lines, and that the German was paying it a night\r\nvisit with some of his heaviest visiting cards.\r\n\r\nI opened one side door just a crack and looked out. The darkness above\r\nblossomed with blinding blotches of fire that flashed on and off. It\r\nseemed as though the sky were a canopy of black velvet perforated with\r\nhundreds of holes behind which dazzling lights passed back and forth,\r\nflashing momentary gleams of brilliance through the punctures. Again,\r\nthis vision would pass as a luminous dripping mass would poise itself on\r\nhigh and cast a steady white glare that revealed clusters of grey smoke\r\npuffs of exploded shrapnel.\r\n\r\nWe had to close the door because the flashes added to the terror of the\r\nhorses, but the aerial activity passed almost as suddenly as it had come\r\nand left our train untouched. As the raiding planes went down the wind,\r\nfollowed always by the poppings of the anti-aircraft guns, the sound of\r\nthe conflict grew distant. We got control over the horses although they\r\nstill trembled with fright.\r\n\r\nThere came another rap at the door and I hurriedly accepted the\r\ncaptain's invitation to accompany him forward to a first-class coach\r\nwhere I spent the remainder of the night stretched out on the cushions.\r\nAs our train resumed its way into the darkness, I dreamed of racing\r\nbefore a stampede of wild horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINTO THE LINE--THE FIRST AMERICAN SHOT IN THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nA damp, chill, morning mist made the dawn even greyer as our battery\r\ntrain slid into a loading platform almost under the walls of a large\r\nmanufacturing plant engaged in producing war materials.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the section chiefs reported that not a man had\r\nbeen injured, and not so much as a leg broken in the crowded horse cars,\r\nevery man in the battery now declared the absence of any doubt but the\r\nair raid had been directly aimed at Battery A.\r\n\r\n\"There might be a spy in this here very outfit,\" said 'Texas' Tinsdale,\r\nthe battery alarmist. \"Else how could them German aviators have known\r\nthat Battery A was on the road last night? They knew we was on the way\r\nto the front and they tried to get us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hire a hall,\" shouted the gruffy top sergeant. \"We've got two hours to\r\nunload. A lot of you fireside veterans get busy. Gun crews get to work\r\non the flats and drivers unload horses. No chow until we're ready to\r\nmove out.\"\r\n\r\nThe sign on a station lamp-post told us the name of the town. It was\r\nJarville. But it jarred nothing in our memories. None of us had ever\r\nheard of it before. I asked the captain where we were.\r\n\r\n\"Just about thirty miles behind the front,\" he replied. \"We are moving\r\nup to our last billets as soon as we unload and feed.\"\r\n\r\nThe horses had made the ride wearing their harness, some of which had\r\nbecome entangled and broken in transit. A number of saddles had slipped\r\nfrom backs and were down behind forelegs.\r\n\r\n\"We're learning something every minute,\" the captain exclaimed.\r\n\"American army regulations call for the removal of all harness from the\r\nhorses before they are put into the cars, but the French have learned\r\nthat that is a dangerous practice over here.\r\n\r\n\"You can't unload unharnessed horses and get them hitched to the guns as\r\nquick as you can harnessed horses. The idea is this. We're pretty close\r\nbehind the lines. A German air party might make this unloading platform\r\na visit at any time and if any of them are in the air and happen to see\r\nus unloading, they'd sure call on us.\r\n\r\n\"The French have learned that the only way to make the best of such a\r\nsituation, if it should arise, is to have the horses already harnessed\r\nso that they can be run out of the cars quickly, hitched to the guns in\r\na jiffy and hurried away. If the horses are in the cars unharnessed, and\r\nall of the harness is being carried in other cars, confusion is\r\nincreased and there is a greater prospect of your losing your train,\r\nhorses, guns and everything from an incendiary bomb, not to mention low\r\nflying machine work.\"\r\n\r\nHis explanation revealed a promising attitude that I found in almost all\r\nAmerican soldiers of all ranks that I had encountered up to that time in\r\nFrance. The foundation of the attitude was a willingness to admit\r\nignorance of new conditions and an eagerness to possess themselves of\r\nall knowledge that the French and British had acquired through bitter\r\nand costly experience.\r\n\r\nFurther than that, the American inclination pushed the soldier students\r\nto look beyond even those then accepted standards. The tendency was to\r\nimprove beyond the French and British, to apply new American principles\r\nof time or labour-saving to simple operation, to save man-power and\r\nhorseflesh by sane safety appliances, to increase efficiency, speed,\r\naccuracy--in a word, their aim was to make themselves the best fighting\r\nmen in the Allied cause.\r\n\r\nOne instance of this is worthy of recounting. I came upon the young\r\nRussian who was the battery saddler. He was a citizen of the United\r\nStates whose uniform he wore, but he was such a new citizen, that he\r\nhardly spoke English. I found him handling a small piece of galvanised\r\niron and a horse shoe. He appeared to be trying to fit the rumpled piece\r\nof metal into the shoe.\r\n\r\nIn his broken English he explained that he was trying to fashion a light\r\nmetal plate that could be easily placed between a horse's shoe and the\r\nhoof, to protect the frog of the foot from nails picked up on the road.\r\nWith all soldiers wearing hobnailed boots, the roads were full of those\r\nsharp bits of metal which had caused serious losses of horseflesh\r\nthrough lameness and blood poisoning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe unloading had continued under the eyes of smiling French girls in\r\nbloomers who were just departing from their work on the early morning\r\nshift in the munition factory beside the station. These were the first\r\nAmerican soldiers they had seen and they were free to pass comment upon\r\nour appearance. So were the men of Battery A, who overlooked the oiled,\r\ngrimed faces and hands of the bloomered beauties, and announced the\r\ngeneral verdict that \"they sure were fat little devils.\"\r\n\r\nThe unloading completed, a scanty snack consisting of two unbuttered\r\nslices of white bread with a hunk of cold meat and maybe the bite of an\r\nonion, had been put away by the time the horses' nose bags were empty.\r\nWith a French guide in the lead, we moved off the platform, rattled\r\nalong under a railroad viaduct, and down the main street of Jarville,\r\nwhich was large enough to boast street car tracks and a shell-damaged\r\ncathedral spire.\r\n\r\nThe remaining townsfolk had lived with the glare and rumble of the front\r\nfor three years now and the passage back and forth of men and horses and\r\nguns hardly elicited as much attention as the occasional promenade of a\r\npoliceman in Evanston, Illinois. But these were different men that rode\r\nthrough those streets that day.\r\n\r\nThis was the first battery of American artillery that had passed that\r\nway. This was an occasion and the townspeople responded to it. Children,\r\nwomen and old men chirped \"vivas,\" kissed hands, bared heads and waved\r\nhats and aprons from curb and shop door and windows overhead.\r\n\r\nThere was no cheering, but there were smiles and tears and \"God bless\r\nyou's.\" It was not a vociferous greeting, but a heart-felt one. They\r\noffered all there was left of an emotion that still ran deep and strong\r\nwithin but that outwardly had been benumbed by three years of nerve-rack\r\nand war-weariness.\r\n\r\nOnward into the zone of war we rode. On through successive battered\r\nvillages, past houses without roofs, windows with shattered panes, stone\r\nwalls with gaping shell holes through them, churches without steeples,\r\nour battery moved toward the last billeting place before entering the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThis was the ancient town of Saint-Nicolas-du-Port on the banks of the\r\nriver Meurthe. Into the Place de la Republic of the town the battery\r\nswung with a clamorous advance guard of schoolchildren and street\r\ngamins.\r\n\r\nThe top sergeant who had preceded the battery into the town, galloped up\r\nto the captain upon our entry and presented him with a sheaf of yellow\r\npaper slips, which bore the addresses of houses and barns and the\r\ncomplements of men and horses to be quartered in each. This was the\r\nbilleting schedule provided by the French major of the town. The guns\r\nwere parked, the horses picketed and the potato peelers started on their\r\nendless task. The absence of fuel for the mess fires demanded immediate\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nIt was a few minutes past noon when the captain and I entered the office\r\nof the French Town Major. It was vacant. The officers were at\r\n_déjeuner_, we learned from an old woman who was sweeping the\r\ncommandant's rooms. Where?--Ah, she knew not. We accosted the first\r\nFrench officer we met on the street.\r\n\r\n\"Where does the Town Major eat?\" the Captain inquired in his best\r\nIndianapolis French. After the customary exchange of salutes,\r\nintroductions, handshakes and greetings, the Frenchman informed us that\r\nMonsieur Le Commandant favoured the _pommard_, that Madame Larue served\r\nat the Hôtel de la Fountaine.\r\n\r\nWe hurried to that place, and there in a little back room behind a\r\nplate-cluttered table with a red and white checkered table cloth, we\r\nfound the Major. The Major said he spoke the English with the fluency.\r\nHe demonstrated his delusion when we asked for wood.\r\n\r\n\"Wood! Ah, but it is impossible that it is wood you ask of me. Have I\r\nnot this morning early seen with my own eyes the wood ordered?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no wood,\" replied the Captain. \"I must have wood for the\r\nfires. It is past noon and my men have not eaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but I am telling you there is wood,\" replied the Major. \"I saw your\r\nsupply officer pay for the wood. By now I believe it has been delivered\r\nfor you in the Place de la République.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it hasn't,\" remonstrated the Captain, \"and the fires have not yet\r\nbeen started, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is on the way, probably,\" said the Major. \"Maybe it will be\r\nthere soon. Maybe it is there now.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain took another tack.\r\n\r\n\"Where was the wood bought?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"From the wood merchant beyond the river,\" replied the Major. \"But it is\r\nalready on the way, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you go to the wood merchant?\" insisted the Captain. \"We have got\r\nto have the wood toot sweet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! _tout de suite_--_tout de suite_--_tout de suite_,\" repeated the\r\nMajor in tones of exasperation. \"With you Americans it is always _tout\r\nde suite_. Here----\"\r\n\r\nHe took my notebook and drew a plan of streets indicating the way to the\r\nplace of the wood merchant. In spite of his remark and the undesired\r\nintrusion of business upon his _déjeuner_, the Major's manner was as\r\nfriendly as could be expected from a Town Major. We left on the run.\r\n\r\nThe wood merchant was a big man, elderly and fat. His face was red and\r\nhe had bushy grey eyebrows. He wore a smock of blue cloth that came to\r\nhis knees. He remonstrated that it was useless for us to buy wood from\r\nhim because wood had already been bought for us. He spoke only French.\r\nThe Captain dismissed all further argument by a direct frontal attack on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\"_Avez-vous de bois?_\" asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"_Oui_,\" the merchant nodded.\r\n\r\n\"_Avez-vous de chevaux?_\" the Captain asked.\r\n\r\n\"_Oui_,\" the merchant nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"_Avez-vous de voiture?_\" the Captain asked.\r\n\r\n\"_Oui_,\"--another nod.\r\n\r\n\"All right then,\" continued the Captain, and then emphasising each word\r\nby the sudden production of another stiff finger on his extended hand,\r\nhe said, \"_Du bois--des chevaux--une voiture_--de whole damn\r\nbusiness--and toot sweet.\"\r\n\r\nIn some remarkable fashion the kindly wood merchant gathered that the\r\nCaptain wanted wood piled in a wagon, drawn by a horse and wanted it in\r\na hurry. _Tout de suite_, pronounced \"toot sweet\" by our soldiers, was a\r\nterm calling for speed, that was among the first acquired by our men in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe old man shrugged his shoulders, elevated his hand, palm outward, and\r\nsignified with an expression of his face that it was useless to argue\r\nfurther for the benefit of these Americans. He turned and gave the\r\nnecessary loading orders to his working force.\r\n\r\nThat working force consisted of two French girls, each about eighteen\r\nyears of age. They wore long baggy bloomers of brown corduroy, tight at\r\nthe ankles where they flopped about in folds over clumsy wooden shoes.\r\nThey wore blouses of the same material and tam o'shanter hats to match,\r\ncalled _bérets_.\r\n\r\nEach one of them had a cigarette hanging from the corner of her mouth.\r\nOne stood on the ground and tossed up the thirty or forty-pound logs to\r\nher sister who stood above on top of the wagon. The latter caught them\r\nin her extended arms and placed them in a pile. To the best of my\r\nrecollection, neither one of the girls missed a puff.\r\n\r\nWhile the loading proceeded, the wood merchant, speaking slowly in\r\nFrench, made us understand the following:\r\n\r\n\"Many peculiar things happen in the war, Monsieur,\" he said. \"Your\r\ncountry, the America, is the land of wonders. Listen, my name is Helois.\r\nTen days ago there came to me one of the washerwomen who clean the\r\nclothes on the banks of the Meurthe, and she said to me:\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, Monsieur, the wood merchant. You are the sly fox. I have your\r\nsecret.' And I say to her that I know not of what she speaks.\r\n\r\n\"'You boast in the town that your two sons are at the front,' she said,\r\n'but I know that one at least of them is not.' And I was dumbfounded. I\r\nsay to her, 'Woman, it is a lie you tell me. Both of my boys are with\r\ntheir regiments, in the trenches even now, if by the grace of the good\r\nGod they still live.'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' she say to me, 'one of your sons hides in the hotel of Madame\r\nLarue. How do I know this secret, Monsieur the wood merchant? I know\r\nbecause this day have I washed the shirt, with his name on it, at the\r\nriver bank. His name, Helois,--the Lieutenant Helois--was stamped on the\r\ncollar and the shirt came from the hotel, La Fontaine.'\r\n\r\n\"I tell her that it is a mistake--that it is the great injustice to me\r\nshe speaks, and that night I dressed in my best clothes to penetrate\r\nthis mystery--to meet this man who disgracefully used the name of my\r\nson--to expose this impostor who would bring shame to the name of\r\nHelois, the wood merchant, whose two sons have been fighting for France\r\nthese three long years.\r\n\r\n\"And so, Monsieur, I meet this man at the hotel. She was right. His name\r\nwas Helois. Here is his card. The Lieutenant Louis F. Helois, and he is\r\na lieutenant in the United States Army.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was a mistake,\" replied the Captain, handing the card back to the\r\nwood merchant, whose lobster red features bore an enigmatical smile.\r\n\r\n\"No,--not the mistake, the truth,\" replied the wood merchant. \"Not my\r\nson--but my grandson--the son of my son--the son of my third son who\r\nwent to America years ago. And now he comes back in the uniform of\r\nliberty to fight again for France. Ah, _Messieurs les Officiers_--the\r\nsons of France return from the ends of the world to fight her cause.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the wood merchant was telling us that the American grandson had\r\nonly stopped three days in the town and then had moved up to service at\r\nthe front, the air was shattered by a loud report. It was the snap of\r\nthe whip in the hands of the young French amazon, standing high on the\r\nload of wood. We escorted the fuel proudly to the Place de la\r\nRépublique. Soon the fires were burning briskly and the smell of onions\r\nand coffee and hot chow was on the air.\r\n\r\nThe stoves were pitched at the bottom of a stone monument in the centre\r\nof the square. Bags of potatoes and onions and burlap covered quarters\r\nof beef and other pieces of mess sergeants paraphernalia were piled on\r\nthe steps of the monument, which was covered with the green and black\r\nscars from dampness and age.\r\n\r\nThe plinth supported a stone shaft fifteen feet in height, which touched\r\nthe lower branches of the trees. The monument was topped with a huge\r\ncross of stone on which was the sculptured figure of the Christ.\r\n\r\nLittle Sykoff, the battery mess sergeant, stood over the stove at the\r\nbottom of the monument. He held in his hand a frying pan, which he shook\r\nback and forth over the fire to prevent the sizzling chips in the pan\r\nfrom burning. His eyes lowered from an inspection of the monument and\r\nmet mine. He smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibbons,\" he said, \"if that brother of mine, who runs the\r\nphotograph gallery out on Paulina and Madison Streets in Chicago, could\r\nonly see me now, he sure would tell the Rabbi. Can you beat it--a Jew\r\nhere frying ham in the shadow of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\nIt was rather hard to beat--and so was the ham. We made this concession\r\nas we sat on the plinth of the monument and polished our mess kits with\r\nbread. And such bread--it was the regulation United States army issue\r\nbread--white, firm and chuck full of nourishment--bread that seemed like\r\ncake to the French youngsters who tasted it and who returned with open\r\nmouths and outstretched hands for more of the \"good white bread.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, those members of Battery A not detailed for immediate\r\nduty denied themselves none of the joys that a new town, in a strange\r\nland, holds for a soldier.\r\n\r\nSaint-Nicolas-du-Port boasts a remarkable cathedral of mediæval\r\narchitecture, of enormous dimensions. It was crumbling with age, but\r\nstill housed the holy. Time and the elements had left the traces of\r\ntheir rough usage upon the edifice.\r\n\r\nHalf of the statues on the broad façade of the cathedral had been\r\nbroken, and now the niches afforded domiciles for families of pigeons.\r\nOn the ground, in a careless pile, to one side of the frontal arch, was\r\nan ignominious pile of miscellaneous arms and legs and heads of\r\nsculptured figures, resting there in anything but saintly dignity. Two\r\nof our young artillerymen were standing in front of the cathedral\r\nsurveying it.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly is in need of repairs,\" said one of them. \"I'll bet they\r\nhaven't done no bricklaying or plumbing on this place since before the\r\nCivil War.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ain't hardly the right way to treat old Saints,\" replied his\r\ncompanion, referring to the pile of broken statuary. \"Seems like they\r\nought to cement the arms and legs and heads back on those old boys and\r\nold girls and put them back on their pedestals. I guess, though, there\r\nain't nobody living to identify the pieces, so they could get the right\r\narms and heads on the right bodies.\"\r\n\r\nOur battery had among its drivers an old timer who might have been\r\ncalled a historian. His opinion held weight in the organisation. He\r\nprofessed to be able to read American ball scores and war news out of\r\nFrench newspapers, a number of which he always carried. Later that day,\r\nI heard him lecturing the cathedral critics on their lack of\r\nappreciation of art and history.\r\n\r\n\"New things ain't art,\" he told them; \"things has got to be old before\r\nthey are artistic. Nobody'd look at the Venus dee Milo if she had all\r\nher arms on. You never hear nobody admiring a modern up-to-date castle\r\nwith electric lighting and bath tubs in it. It simply ain't art.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this cathedral is art. This country around here is just full of\r\nhistory. Here's where whole book stores of it was written. Why, say,\r\nthere was batteries of artillery rolling through this country a million\r\nyears ago. It was right around here that Napoleon joined forces with\r\nJulius Cæsar to fight the Crusaders. This here is sacred ground.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, a number of the battery, located the _buvette_ that\r\ncarried across its curtained front the gold lettered sign _bar\r\nParisian_. It was a find. Some thirty American artillerymen crowded\r\naround the tables.\r\n\r\nCigarette smoke filled the low-ceilinged room with blue layers, through\r\nwhich the lamp light shone. In one corner stood a mechanical piano which\r\nswallowed big copper sous and gave out discord's metallic melody. It was\r\nof an American make and the best number on its printed programme was\r\n\"Aren't you Coming Back to Old Virginia, Molly?\" Sous followed sous into\r\nthis howitzer of harmony and it knew no rest that night. Everybody\r\njoined in and helped it out on the choruses.\r\n\r\nThings were going fine when the door opened at about nine thirty, and\r\nthere stood two members of the American Provost Guard. They carried with\r\nthem two orders. One instructed Madame, the proprietress, to dispense no\r\nmore red ink or beer to American soldiers that night, and the other was\r\na direction to all Americans around the table to get back to their\r\nbillets for the night.\r\n\r\nThe bunch left with reluctance but without a grumble. It was warm and\r\ncomfortable within the _bar Parisian_ and Madame's smiles and red wine\r\nand beer and Camembert cheese composed the Broadway of many recent\r\ndreams. But they left without complaint.\r\n\r\nThey made their rollicking departure, returning Madame's parting smiles,\r\ngallantly lifting their steel helmets and showering her with vociferous\r\n\"bong swore's.\" And--well it simply must be told. She kissed the last\r\none out out the door and, turning, wiped away a tear with the corner of\r\nher apron. Madame had seen youth on the way to the front before.\r\n\r\nThe billets were comfortable. Some were better than others. Picket line\r\ndetails slept in their blankets in the hay over the stables. Gun crews\r\ndrew beds and pallets on the floor in occupied houses. In these homes\r\nthere was always that hour before retirement for the night when the old\r\nmen and remaining women of the French household and their several\r\nmilitary guests billeted in the place, would gather about the fireplace\r\nin the kitchen and regale one another with stories, recounted by the\r\nmurder of French and English languages and a wealth of pantomime.\r\n\r\nLouise, the eighteen-year-old daughter of the town-crier--he who daily\r\nbeat the drum in front of the Hôtel de Ville and read lengthy\r\nbulletins, was interested in the workings of Gunner Black's colt\r\nautomatic. Gunner Black, most anxious to show her, demonstrated the\r\naction of the pistol but, forgetting that inevitable shell in the\r\nchamber, shot himself in the arm.\r\n\r\nIt was only an incident. The noise scared Louise, but not the wound. She\r\nhad seen too many Americans get shot in the moving pictures.\r\n\r\nThe captain and I were quartered in the house of the Curé of the\r\ncathedral. The old housekeeper of the place made the captain blush when\r\nshe remarked her surprise that there were such young captains in the\r\nAmerican army. Her name was Madame Dupont, and she was more than pleased\r\nto learn from the captain that that had been the maiden name of his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe captain's room had the interior dimensions and heavy decorations of\r\nthe mystic inner sanctum of some secret grand lodge. Religious paintings\r\nand symbols hung from the walls, which were papered in dark red to match\r\nthe heavy plush hangings over the ever closed windows.\r\n\r\nTwo doors in the blank wall swung open revealing a hermetically sealed\r\nrecess in which a bed just fitted. This arrangement, quite common in\r\nFrance, indicated that the device now popular in two-room sleeping\r\napartments in America, must have been suggested by the sleeping customs\r\nof mediæval times.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, our battery pulled out for the front. We were\r\nbound for the line. We took the roads out of Saint Nicolas to the east,\r\nmaking our way toward that part of the front that was known as the\r\nLuneville sector. Our way lay through the towns of Dombasle,\r\nSommerviller, Maixe, Einville, Valhey, Serres, to the remains of the\r\nruined village of Hoeville.\r\n\r\nThe sector runs almost along the border between France and old Lorraine,\r\noccupied by the Germans since 1870. Even the names of the old French\r\ntowns beyond the border had been changed to German in the effort of the\r\nPrussians to Germanise the stolen province.\r\n\r\nIt was in this section during the few days just prior to the outbreak of\r\nthe war that France made unwise demonstration of her disinclination\r\ntoward hostilities with Germany. Every soldier in France was under arms,\r\nas was every soldier in Europe. France had military patrols along her\r\nborders. In the French chamber of deputies, the socialists had rushed\r\nthrough a measure which was calculated to convince the German people\r\nthat France had no intentions or desire of menacing German territory. By\r\nthat measure every French soldier was withdrawn from the Franco-German\r\nborder to a line ten miles inside of France. The German appreciation of\r\nthis evidence of peacefulness was manifested when the enemy, at the\r\noutbreak of the war, moved across the border and occupied that ten-mile\r\nstrip of France.\r\n\r\nFrance had succeeded in driving the enemy back again in that part of\r\nLorraine, but only at the cost of many lives and the destruction of many\r\nFrench towns and villages. Since the close of the fighting season of\r\n1914, there had been little or no progress on either side at this point.\r\nThe opposing lines here had been stationary for almost three years and\r\nit was known on both sides as a quiet sector.\r\n\r\nThe country side was of a rolling character, but very damp. At that\r\nseason of the year when our first American fighting men reached the\r\nWestern front, that part of the line that they occupied was particularly\r\nmuddy and miserable.\r\n\r\nBefore nine o'clock that morning as we rode on to the front, the\r\nhorse-drawn traffic, including our battery, was forced to take the side\r\nof the road numerous times to permit the passage of long trains of motor\r\ntrucks loaded down with American infantrymen, bound in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMost of the motor vehicles were of the omnibus type. A number of them\r\nwere worthy old double-deckers that had seen long years of peaceful\r\nservice on the boulevards of Paris before the war. Slats of wood ran\r\nlengthwise across the windows of the lower seating compartment and\r\nthrough these apertures young, sun-burned, American faces topped with\r\nsteel helmets, peered forth.\r\n\r\nSome of our men reposed languidly on the rear steps of the busses or on\r\nthe tops. Most of the bus-loads were singing rollicking choruses. The\r\nmen were in good spirits. They had been cheered in every village they\r\nhad passed through on the way from their training area.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, bowleg,\" was the greeting shouted by one of these motoring\r\nmockers, who looked down on our saddled steeds, \"better get a hustle on\r\nthem hayburners. We're going to be in Berlin by the time you get where\r\nthe front used to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will,\" replied one of the mounted artillerymen, with a\r\nnegative inflection. \"You'll get a hell of a long ways without us. If\r\nyou doughboys start anything without the artillery, you'll see Berlin\r\nthrough the bars of a prisoner's cage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky pups--the artillery--nothing to do but ride,\" was the passing\r\nshout of another taunter, perched high on a bus. This was an\r\nunanswerable revision of an old taunt that the artillery used to shout\r\nto passing infantry in the days when a foot soldier was really a foot\r\nsoldier. Then the easy-riding mounted troops, when passing an infantry\r\ncolumn on the road, would say, \"Pretty soft for the doughboys--nothing\r\nto do but walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Times certainly have changed,\" one of our battery drivers felt it\r\nnecessary to remark to me in defence of his branch of the service. \"But\r\nthere ain't no spark plugs or carburetors to get out of order on our\r\nmounts.\r\n\r\n\"However, we do have our troubles. That runaway wheeler in No. 2 section\r\nbroke away from the picket line last night and Kemball and I were\r\ndetailed to hunt all over town for him.\r\n\r\n\"You know that dark, winding, narrow street, that winds down the hill\r\nback of the cathedral. Well, it was about midnight and blacker than the\r\nace of spades, when Kemball and I pushed along there in the dark,\r\nlooking for that onery animal.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly, we heard a sharp clatter on the cobblestones half a block up\r\nthe hill. It was coming our way full speed. 'Here he comes now,' said\r\nKemball, 'and he's galloping like hell. Jump into a doorway or he'll\r\nclimb all over us.'\r\n\r\n\"We waited there pressed against the wall in the dark as the galloping\r\ncame up to us and passed. What dy'e s'pose it was? It wasn't that\r\nrunaway horse at all. Just a couple of them French kids chasing one\r\nanother in wooden shoes.\"\r\n\r\nThe road to the front was a populous one. We passed numerous groups of\r\nsupply wagons carrying food and fodder up to the front lines. Other\r\nwagons were returning empty and here and there came an ambulance with\r\nbulgy blankets outlining the figures of stretcher cases, piled two high\r\nand two wide. Occasionally a Y. M. C. A. runabout loaded down with\r\ncoffee pots and candy tins and driven by helmeted wearers of the Red\r\nTriangle, would pass us carrying its store of extras to the boys up\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nWe passed through villages where manufacturing plants were still in\r\noperation and, nearer the front, the roads lay through smaller hamlets,\r\nshell torn and deserted, save for sentries who stood guard in wooden\r\ncoops at intersections. Civilians became fewer and fewer, although there\r\nwas not a village that did not have one or two women or children or old\r\nmen unfit for uniform.\r\n\r\nFinally the road mounted a rolling hill and here it was bordered by\r\nroadside screens consisting of stretched chicken wire to which whisps of\r\nstraw and grass and bits of green dyed cloth had been attached. Our men\r\nriding behind the screen peered through apertures in it and saw the\r\ndistant hills forward, from which German glasses could have observed all\r\npassage along that road had it not been for the screen.\r\n\r\nSo we moved into position. It was late in the night of October 22nd,\r\n1917, that our batteries of artillery and companies of infantry moved\r\nthrough the darkness on the last lap of their trip to the front. The\r\nroads were sticky and gummy. A light rain was falling. The guns boomed\r\nin front of us, but not with any continued intensity. Through streets\r\npaved with slippery cobbles and bordered with the bare skeletons of\r\nshell-wrecked houses, our American squads marched four abreast. Their\r\npassing in the darkness was accompanied by the sound of the unhastened\r\ntread of many hobnailed boots.\r\n\r\nAt times, the rays of a cautiously flashed electric light would reveal\r\nour infantrymen with packs on back and rifles slung over their\r\nshoulders. A stiff wind whipped the rain into their faces and tugged the\r\nbottoms of their flapping, wet overcoats.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that they had made it on foot a number of miles\r\nfrom the place where they had disembarked from the motor trucks, the men\r\nmarched along to the soft singing of songs, which were ordered\r\ndiscontinued as the marching columns got closer to the communicating\r\ntrenches which led into the front line.\r\n\r\nIn the march were machine gun carts hauled by American mules and rolling\r\nkitchens, which at times dropped on the darkened road swirls of glowing\r\nred embers that had to be hurriedly stamped out. Anxious American staff\r\nofficers consulted their wrist watches frequently in evidence of the\r\nconcern they felt as to whether the various moving units were reaching\r\ndesignated points upon the scheduled minute.\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight that our men reached the front line. It was the\r\nmorning of October 23rd, 1917, that American infantrymen and Bavarian\r\nregiments of _Landwehr_ and _Landsturm_ faced one another for the first\r\ntime in front line positions on the European front.\r\n\r\nLess than eight hundred yards of slate and drab-coloured soft ground,\r\nblotched with rust-red expanses of wire entanglements, separated the\r\nhostile lines.\r\n\r\nThere was no moon. A few cloud-veiled stars only seemed to accentuate\r\nthe blackness of the night. There, in the darkness and the mud, on the\r\nslippery firing step of trench walls and in damp, foul-smelling dugouts,\r\nyoung red-blooded Americans tingled for the first time with the thrill\r\nthat they had trained so long and travelled so far to experience.\r\n\r\nThrough unfortunate management of the Press arrangements in connection\r\nwith this great historical event, American correspondents accredited by\r\nthe War Department to our forces, were prevented from accompanying our\r\nmen into the front that night. Good fortune, however, favoured me as\r\none of the two sole exceptions to this circumstance. Raymond G. Carroll,\r\ncorrespondent of the Philadelphia _Public Ledger_, and myself,\r\nrepresenting the Chicago _Tribune_ and its associated papers, were the\r\nonly two newspaper men who went into the line with the men that night.\r\nFor enjoying this unusual opportunity, we were both arrested several\r\ndays later, not, however, until after we had obtained the first-hand\r\nstory of the great event.\r\n\r\nA mean drizzle of rain was falling that night, but it felt cool on the\r\npink American cheeks that were hot with excitement. The very wetness of\r\nthe air impregnated all it touched with the momentousness of the hour.\r\nSpirits were high and the mud was deep, but we who were there had the\r\nfeeling that history was chiselling that night's date into her book of\r\nages.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a shell wheezed over through the soggy atmosphere, seeming\r\nto leave an unseen arc in the darkness above. It would terminate with a\r\nsullen thump in some spongy, water-soaked mound behind us. Then an\r\nanswering missive of steel would whine away into the populated\r\ninvisibility in front of us.\r\n\r\nFrench comrades, in half English and half French, gushed their\r\ncongratulations, and shook us by the hand. Some of us were even hugged\r\nand kissed on both cheeks. Our men took the places of French platoons\r\nthat were sent back to rest billets. But other French platoons remained\r\nshoulder to shoulder with our men in the front line. The presence of our\r\ntroops there was in continuation of their training for the purpose of\r\nproviding a nucleus for the construction of later contingents. Both our\r\ninfantry and our artillery acted in conjunction with the French infantry\r\nand artillery and the sector remained under French command.\r\n\r\nOur men were eager to ask questions and the French were ever ready to\r\nrespond. They first told us about the difference in the sound of shells.\r\nNow that one that started with a bark in back of us and whined over our\r\nheads is a _départ_. It is an Allied shell on its way to the Germans.\r\nNow, this one, that whines over first and ends with a distant grunt,\r\nlike a strong wallop on a wet carpet, is an _arrivée_. It has arrived\r\nfrom Germany. In the dugouts, our men smoked dozens of cigarettes,\r\nlighting fresh ones from the half-consumed butts. It is the appetite\r\nthat comes with the progressive realisation of a long deferred hope. It\r\nis the tension that comes from at last arriving at an object and then\r\nfinding nothing to do, now that you are there. It is the nervousness\r\nthat nerveless youth suffers in inactivity.\r\n\r\nThe men sloshed back and forth through the mud along the narrow confines\r\nof the trench. The order is against much movement, but immobility is\r\nunbearable. Wet slickers rustle against one another in the narrow\r\ntraverses, and equipment, principally the French and English gas masks,\r\nhanging at either hip become entangled in the darkness.\r\n\r\nAt times a steel helmet falls from some unaccustomed head and, hitting\r\nperhaps a projecting rock in the trench wall, gives forth a clang which\r\nis followed by curses from its clumsy owner and an admonition of quiet\r\nfrom some young lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Olson, keep your damn fool head down below the top of that trench or\r\nyou'll get it blown off.\" The sergeant is talking, and Olson, who\r\nbrought from Minnesota a keen desire to see No Man's Land even at the\r\nrisk of his life, is forced to repress the yearning.\r\n\r\n\"Two men over in B Company just got holes drilled through their beans\r\nfor doing the same thing,\" continued the sergeant. \"There's nothing you\r\ncan see out there anyhow. It's all darkness.\"\r\n\r\nEither consciously or unconsciously, the sergeant was lying, for the\r\npurpose of saving Olson and others from a fool's fate. There was not a\r\nsingle casualty in any American unit on the line that first night.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the telephone dugout?\" a young lieutenant asked his French\r\ncolleague. \"I want to speak to the battalion commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must not speak English over the telephone,\" replied the\r\nFrenchman, \"the Germans will hear you with the instruments they use to\r\ntap the underground circuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was going to use our American code,\" said the front line novice;\r\n\"if the Germans tap in they won't be able to figure out what it means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no, my friend,\" replied the Frenchman, smiling. \"They won't know\r\nwhat the message means, but your voice and language will mean to them\r\nthat Americans are occupying the sector in front of them, and we want to\r\ngive them that information in another way, _n'est ce pas?_\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there was some concern in the German trenches just over the\r\nway with regard to what was taking place in our lines. Relief periods\r\nare ticklish intervals for the side making them. It is quite possible\r\nthat some intimation of our presence may have been given.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable conversation and movement among our men that\r\nnight. Jimmy found it frequently necessary to call the attention of\r\nJohnny to some new thing he had discovered. And of a consequence, much\r\nnatural, but needless, chattering resulted.\r\n\r\nI believe the Germans did become nervous because they made repeated\r\nattacks on the enveloping darkness with numbers of star shells. These\r\naerial beauties of night warfare released from their exploding\r\nencasements high in the air, hung from white silk parachutes above the\r\nAmerican amateurs.\r\n\r\nThe numerous company and battery jesters did not refrain from imitative\r\nexpressions of \"Ahs\" and \"Ohs\" and \"Ain't it bootiful?\" as their\r\nlaughing upturned faces were illuminated in the white light.\r\n\r\nThat night one rocket went up shortly before morning. It had a different\r\neffect from its predecessors. It reared itself from the darkness\r\nsomewhere on the left. Its flight was noiseless as it mounted higher and\r\nhigher on its fiery staff. Then it burst in a shower of green balls of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThat meant business. One green rocket was the signal that the Germans\r\nwere sending over gas shells. It was an alarm that meant the donning of\r\ngas masks. On they went quickly. It was the first time this equipment\r\nhad been adjusted under emergency conditions, yet the men appeared to\r\nhave mastered the contrivances.\r\n\r\nThen the word was passed along the trenches and through the dugouts for\r\nthe removal of the masks. It had not been a French signal. The green\r\nrocket had been sent up by the Germans. The enemy was using green\r\nrockets that night as a signal of their own. There had been no gas\r\nshells. It was a false alarm.\r\n\r\n\"The best kind of practice in the world,\" said one of our battalion\r\ncommanders; \"it's just the stuff we're here for. I hope the Germans\r\nhappen to do that every night a new bunch of our men get in these\r\ntrenches.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the infantry were experiencing these initial thrills in the front\r\nline, our gunners were struggling in the mud of the black gun pits to\r\nget their pieces into position in the quickest possible time, and\r\nachieve the honour of firing that first American shot in the war.\r\n\r\nEach battery worked feverishly in intense competition with every other\r\nbattery. Battery A of the 6th Field, to which I had attached myself,\r\nlost in the race for the honour. Another battery in the same regiment\r\naccomplished the achievement.\r\n\r\nThat was Battery C of the 6th Field Artillery. I am reproducing,\r\nherewith, for what I believe is the first time, the exact firing data on\r\nthat shot and the officers and men who took part in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy almost superhuman work through the entire previous day and night,\r\ndetails of men from Battery C had pulled one cannon by ropes across a\r\nmuddy, almost impassable, meadow. So anxious were they to get off the\r\nfirst shot that they did not stop for meals.\r\n\r\nThey managed to drag the piece into an old abandoned French gun pit. The\r\nhistorical position of that gun was one kilometre due east of the town\r\nof Bathelemont and three hundred metres northeast of the\r\nBauzemont-Bathelemont road. The position was located two miles from the\r\nold international boundary line between France and German-Lorraine. The\r\nposition was one and one-half kilometres back of the French first line,\r\nthen occupied by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe first shot was fired at 6:5:10 A. M., October 23rd, 1917. Those who\r\nparticipated in the firing of the shot were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant F. M. Mitchell, U.S.R., acted as platoon chief.\r\n  Corporal Robert Braley laid the piece.\r\n  Sergeant Elward Warthen loaded the piece.\r\n  Sergeant Frank Grabowski prepared the fuse for cutting.\r\n  Private Louis Varady prepared the fuse for cutting.\r\n  Private John J. Wodarczak prepared the fuse for cutting.\r\n  Corporal Osborne W. De Varila prepared the fuse for cutting.\r\n  Sergeant Lonnie Domonick cut the fuse.\r\n  Captain Idus R. McLendon gave the command to fire.\r\n  Sergeant Alex L. Arch fired first shot.\r\n\r\nThe missile fired was a 75 millimetre or 3-inch high-explosive shell.\r\nThe target was a German battery of 150 millimetre or 6-inch guns located\r\ntwo kilometres back of the German first line trenches, and one kilometre\r\nin back of the boundary line between France and German-Lorraine. The\r\nposition of that enemy battery on the map was in a field 100 metres west\r\nof the town which the French still call Xanrey, but which the Germans\r\nhave called Schenris since they took it from France in 1870. Near that\r\nspot--and damn near--fell the first American shell fired in the great\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is peculiar to note that I am writing this chapter at Atlantic\r\nCity, October 23rd, 1918, just one year to the day after the event. That\r\nshot surely started something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN SECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the Luneville sector, described in the preceding chapter, that\r\nthe first American fighting men faced the Germans on the western front.\r\nIt was there that the enemy captured its first American prisoners in a\r\nsmall midnight raid; it was there that we captured some prisoners of\r\ntheirs, and inflicted our first German casualties; it was there that the\r\nfirst American fighting man laid down his life on the western front.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these facts, however, the occupation of those front line\r\nposts in that sector constituted nothing more than a post-graduate\r\ncourse in training under the capable direction of French instructors who\r\nadvised our officers and men in everything they did.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the course, which extended over a number of weeks,\r\nthe American forces engaged in it were withdrawn from the line and\r\nretired for a well-earned rest period and for reorganisation purposes in\r\nareas back of the line. There they renewed equipment and prepared for\r\nthe occupation of the first all-American sector on the western front.\r\n\r\nThat sector was located in Lorraine some distance to the east of the\r\nLuneville front. It was north and slightly west of the city of Toul. It\r\nwas on the east side of the St. Mihiel salient, then occupied by the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nThe sector occupied a position in what the French called the\r\nPont-à-Mousson front. Our men were to occupy an eight-mile section of\r\nthe front line trenches extending from a point west of the town of\r\nFlirey, to a point west of the ruins of the town of Seicheprey. The\r\nposition was not far from the French stronghold of Verdun to the\r\nnorthwest or the German stronghold of Metz to the northeast, and was\r\nequidistant from both.\r\n\r\nThat line changed from French blue to American khaki on the night of\r\nJanuary 21st. The sector became American at midnight. I watched the men\r\nas they marched into the line. In small squads they proceeded silently\r\nup the road toward the north, from which direction a raw wind brought\r\noccasional sounds resembling the falling of steel plates on the wooden\r\nfloor of a long corridor.\r\n\r\nA half moon doubly ringed by mist, made the hazy night look grey. At\r\nintervals, phantom flashes flushed the sky. The mud of the roadway\r\nformed a colourless paste that made marching not unlike skating on a\r\nplatter of glue.\r\n\r\nThis was their departure for the front--this particular battalion--the\r\nfirst battalion of the 16th United States Infantry. I knew, and every\r\nman in it knew, what was before them.\r\n\r\nEach man was in for a long tour of duty in trenches knee-deep with\r\nmelted snow and mud. Each platoon commander knew the particular portion\r\nof that battle-battered bog into which he must lead his men. Each\r\ncompany commander knew the section of shell-punctured, swamp land that\r\nwas his to hold, and the battalion commander, a veteran American\r\nsoldier, was well aware of the particular perils of the position which\r\nhis one thousand or more men were going to occupy in the very jaw-joint\r\nof a narrowing salient.\r\n\r\nAll branches of the United States military forces may take special pride\r\nin that first battalion that went into the new American line that night.\r\nThe commander represented the U. S. Officers Reserve Corps, and the\r\nother officers and men were from the reserves, the regulars, West Point,\r\nthe National Guard and the National Army. Moreover, the organisation\r\ncomprised men from all parts of the United States as well as men whose\r\nparents had come from almost every race and nationality in the world.\r\nOne company alone possessed such a babble of dialects among its new\r\nAmericans, that it proudly called itself, the Foreign Legion.\r\n\r\nFor two days the battalion had rested in the mud of the semi-destroyed\r\nvillage of Ansauville, several miles back of the front. A broad, shallow\r\nstream, then at the flood, wound through and over most of the village\r\nsite. Walking anywhere near the border of the water, one pulled about\r\nwith him pounds of tenacious, black gumbo. Dogs and hogs, ducks and\r\nhorses, and men,--all were painted with nature's handiest camouflage.\r\n\r\nWhere the stream left the gaping ruins of a stone house on the edge of\r\nthe village, there was a well-kept French graveyard, clinging to the\r\nslope of a small hill. Above the ruins of the hamlet, stood the steeple\r\nof the old stone church, from which it was customary to ring the alarm\r\nwhen the Germans sent over their shells of poison gas.\r\n\r\nOur officers busied themselves with, unfinished supply problems. Such\r\nmatters as rubber boots for the men, duck boards for the trenches, food\r\nfor the mules, and ration containers necessary for the conveyance of hot\r\nfood to the front lines, were not permitted to interfere with the\r\nbattalion's movements. In war, there is always the alternative of doing\r\nwithout or doing with makeshifts, and that particular battalion\r\ncommander, after three years of war, was the kind of a soldier who made\r\nthe best of circumstances no matter how adverse they may have been.\r\n\r\nThat commander was Major Griffiths. He was an American fighting man. His\r\nmilitary record began in the Philippine Insurrection, when, as a\r\nsergeant in a Tennessee regiment of National Guard, he was mentioned in\r\norders for conspicuous gallantry. At the suppression of the\r\ninsurrection, he became a major in the United States Constabulary in the\r\nPhilippines. He resigned his majority in 1914, entered the Australian\r\nforces, and was wounded with them in the bloody landing at Gallipoli. He\r\nwas invalided to England, where, upon his partial recovery, he was\r\npromoted to major in the British forces and was sent to France in\r\ncommand of a battalion of the Sherwood Foresters. With them, he received\r\ntwo more wounds, one at the Battle of Ypres, and another during the\r\nfighting around Loos.\r\n\r\nHe was in an English hospital when America entered the war, but he\r\nhurried his convalescence and obtained a transfer back to the army of\r\nhis own country. He hadn't regained as yet the full use of his right\r\nhand, his face still retained a hospital pallor, and an X-ray photograph\r\nof his body revealed the presence of numerous pieces of shell still\r\nlodged there. But on that night of January 21st, he could not conceal\r\nthe pride that he felt in the honour in having been the one chosen to\r\ncommand the battalion of Americans that was to take over the first\r\nAmerican sector in France. Major Griffiths survived those strenuous days\r\non the Pont-à-Mousson front, but he received a fatal wound three months\r\nlater at the head of his battalion in front of Catigny, in Picardy. He\r\ndied fighting under his own flag.\r\n\r\nJust before daylight failed that wintry day, three poilus walked down\r\nthe road from the front and into Ansauville. Two of them were helping a\r\nthird, whose bandaged arm and shoulder explained the mission of the\r\nparty. As they passed the rolling kitchens where the Americans were\r\nreceiving their last meal before entering the trenches, there was\r\nsilence and not even an exchange of greetings or smiles.\r\n\r\nThis lack of expression only indicated the depth of feeling stirred by\r\nthe appearance of this wounded French soldier. The incident, although\r\ncomparatively trivial, seemed to arouse within our men a solemn grimness\r\nand a more fervent determination to pay back the enemy in kind. In\r\nsilence, our men finished that last meal, which consisted of cold corned\r\nbeef, two slices of dry bread per man, and coffee.\r\n\r\nThe sight of that one wounded man did not make our boys realise more\r\nthan they already did, what was in front of them. They had already made\r\na forty mile march over frozen roads up to this place and had incurred\r\ndiscomforts seemingly greater than a shell-shattered arm or a\r\nbullet-fractured shoulder. After that gruelling hiking experience, it\r\nwas a pleasant prospect to look forward to a chance of venting one's\r\nfeelings on the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, no chip-on-the-shoulder cockiness marked the\r\ndisposition of these men about to take first grips with the Germans,--no\r\nchallenging bravado was revealed in the actions or statements of these\r\ngrim, serious trail-blazers of the American front, whose attitude\r\nappeared to be one of soldierly resignation to the first martial\r\nprinciple, \"Orders is orders.\"\r\n\r\nAs the companies lined up in the village street in full marching order,\r\nawaiting the command to move, several half-hearted attempts at\r\njocularity died cold. One irrepressible made a futile attempt at\r\nfrivolity by announcing that he had Cherokee blood in his veins and was\r\nso tough he could \"spit battleships.\" This attempted jocularity drew as\r\nmuch mirth as an undertaker's final invitation to the mourners to take\r\nthe last, long look at the departed.\r\n\r\nOne bright-faced youngster tingling with the thrill of anticipation,\r\nleaped on a gun carriage and absently whistled a shrill medley,\r\nbeginning with \"Yaka-hula,\" and ending with \"Just a Song at Twilight.\"\r\nThere was food for thought in the progress of his efforts from the\r\nfrivolous to the pensive, but there was little time for such thoughts.\r\nNo one even told him to shut up.\r\n\r\nWhile there was still light, an aerial battle took place overhead. For\r\nfifteen minutes, the French anti-aircraft guns banged away at three\r\nGerman planes, which were audaciously sailing over our lines. The\r\nAmericans rooted like bleacherites for the guns but the home team failed\r\nto score, and the Germans sailed serenely home. They apparently had had\r\ntime to make adequate observations.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire afternoon, German sausage balloons had hung high in\r\nthe air back of the hostile line, offering additional advantages for\r\nenemy observation. On the highroad leading from Ansauville, a\r\nconspicuous sign _L'enemie vous voit_ informed newcomers that German\r\neyes were watching their movements and could interfere at any time with\r\na long range shell. The fact was that the Germans held high ground and\r\ntheir glasses could command almost all of the terrain back of our lines.\r\n\r\nUnder this seemingly eternal espionage punctuated at intervals by heavy\r\nshelling, several old women of the village had remained in their homes,\r\nliving above the ground on quiet days and moving their knitting to the\r\nfront yard dugout at times when gas and shell and bomb interfered. Some\r\nof these women operated small shops in the front rooms of their damaged\r\nhomes and the Americans lined up in front of the window counters and\r\nexchanged dirty French paper money for canned _pâté de foi gras_ or jars\r\nof mustard.\r\n\r\nA machine gun company with mule-drawn carts led the movement from\r\nAnsauville into the front. It was followed at fifty yard intervals by\r\nother sections. Progress down that road was executed in small groups--it\r\nwas better to lose one whole section than an entire company.\r\n\r\nThat highroad to the front, with its border of shell-withered trees, was\r\nrevealed that night against a bluish grey horizon occasionally rimmed\r\nwith red. Against the sky, the moving groups were defined as impersonal\r\nblack blocks. Young lieutenants marched ahead of each platoon. In the\r\nhazy light, it was difficult to distinguish them. The only difference\r\nwas that their hips seemed bulkier from the heavy sacks, field glasses,\r\nmap cases, canteens, pistol holsters and cartridge clips.\r\n\r\nEach section, as it marched out of the village, passed under the eye of\r\nMajor Griffiths, who sat on his horse in the black shadow of a wall. A\r\nsergeant commanding one section was coming toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" ordered the Major. \"Sergeant, where is your helmet?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the men in my section is wearing it, sir,\" replied the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" snapped the Major.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody took his and he hadn't any,\" said the Sergeant, \"so I made him\r\nwear mine, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get it back and wear it yourself,\" the Major ordered. \"Nothing could\r\nhurt the head of a man who couldn't hang on to his own helmet.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was obeyed, the section marched on and a bareheaded Irishman\r\nout of hearing of the Major said, \"I told the Sergeant not to make me\r\nwear it; I don't need the damn thing.\"\r\n\r\nAnother section passed forward, the moonlight gleaming on the helmets\r\njauntily cocked over one ear and casting black shadows over the faces of\r\nthe wearers. From these shadows glowed red dots of fire.\r\n\r\n\"Drop those cigarettes,\" came the command from the all watchful, unseen\r\npresence mounted on the horse in the shadow of the wall. Automatically,\r\nthe section spouted red arcs that fell to the road on either side in a\r\nshower of sparks.\r\n\r\n\"It's a damn shame to do that.\" Major Griffith spoke to me standing\r\nbeside his horse. \"You can't see a cigarette light fifty yards away, but\r\nif there were no orders against smoking, the men would be lighting\r\nmatches or dumping pipes, and such flashes can be seen.\"\r\n\r\nThere was need for caution. The enemy was always watchful for an\r\ninterval when one organisation was relieving another on the line. That\r\nperiod represented the time when an attack could cause the greatest\r\nconfusion in the ranks of the defenders. But that night our men\r\naccomplished the relief of the French Moroccan division then in the line\r\nwithout incident.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo nights later, in company with a party of correspondents, I paid a\r\nmidnight visit to our men in the front line trenches of that first\r\nAmerican sector. With all lights out, cigarettes tabooed and the siren\r\nsilenced, our overloaded motor slushed slowly along the shell-pitted\r\nroads, carefully skirting groups of marching men and lumbering supply\r\nwagons that took shape suddenly out of the mist-laden road in front of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not raining, moisture seemed to drip from everything,\r\nand vapours from the ground, mixing with the fog overhead, almost\r\nobscured the hard-working moon.\r\n\r\nIn the greyness of the night sight and smell lost their keenness, and\r\nfamiliar objects assumed unnatural forms, grotesque and indistinct.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere ahead dull, muffled thumps in the mist brought memories\r\nof spring house cleaning and the dusting out of old cushions, but it was\r\nreally the three-year-old song of the guns. Nature had censored\r\nobservation by covering the spectacle with the mantle of indefiniteness.\r\nStill this was the big thing we had come to see--night work in and\r\nbehind the front lines of the American sector.\r\n\r\nWe approached an engineers' dump, where the phantoms of fog gradually\r\nmaterialised into helmeted khaki figures that moved in mud knee-deep and\r\ncarried boxes and planks and bundles of tools. Total silence covered all\r\nthe activity and not a ray of light revealed what mysteries had been\r\nworked here in surroundings that seemed no part of this world.\r\n\r\nAn irregular pile of rock loomed grey and sinister before us, and,\r\nlooking upward, we judged, from its gaping walls, that it was the\r\nremains of a church steeple. It was the dominating ruin in the town of\r\nBeaumont.\r\n\r\n\"Turn here to the left,\" the officer conducting our party whispered into\r\nthe ear of the driver.\r\n\r\nThe sudden execution of the command caused the officer's helmet to rasp\r\nagainst that of the driver with a sound that set the cautious whispering\r\nto naught.\r\n\r\n\"Park here in the shadow,\" he continued. \"Make no noise; show no light.\r\nThey dropped shells here ten minutes ago. Gentlemen, this is regimental\r\nheadquarters. Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nIn a well buttressed cellar, surmounted by a pile of ruins, we found the\r\ncolonel sitting at a wooden table in front of a grandfather's clock of\r\nscratched mahogany. He called the roll--five special correspondents,\r\nCaptain Chandler, American press officer, with a goatee and fur coat to\r\nmatch; Captain Vielcastel, a French press officer, who is a marquis and\r\nspeaks English, and a lieutenant from brigade headquarters, who already\r\nhad been named \"Whispering Willie.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel offered sticks to those with the cane habit. With two\r\nrunners in the lead, we started down what had been the main street of\r\nthe ruined village.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand the dropping of that shell over here to-night,\" the\r\ncolonel said. \"When we relieved the French, there had been a\r\nlong-standing agreement against such discourtesy. It's hard to believe\r\nthe Boche would make a scrap of paper out of that agreement. They must\r\nhave had a new gunner on the piece. We sent back two shells into their\r\nregimental headquarters. They have been quiet since.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes' walk through the mud, and the colonel stopped to announce:\r\n\"Within a hundred yards of you, a number of men are working. Can you\r\nhear 'em?\"\r\n\r\nNo one could, so he showed us a long line of sweating Americans\r\nstretching off somewhere into the fog. Their job was more of the endless\r\ntrench digging and improving behind the lines. While one party swung\r\npick and spade in the trenches, relief parties slept on the ground\r\nnearby. The colonel explained that these parties arrived after dark,\r\nworked all night, and then carefully camouflaged all evidences of new\r\nearth and departed before daylight, leaving no trace of their night's\r\nwork to be discovered by prying airman. Often the work was carried on\r\nunder an intermittent shelling, but that night only two shells had\r\nlanded near them.\r\n\r\nAn American-manned field gun shattered the silence, so close to us that\r\nwe could feel its breath and had a greater respect for its bite. The\r\nproximity of the gun had not even been guessed by any of our party. A\r\nyellow stab of flame seemed to burn the mist through which the shell\r\nscreeched on its way toward Germany.\r\n\r\nCorrespondent Junius Woods, who was wearing an oversized pair of hip\r\nrubber boots, immediately strapped the tops to his belt.\r\n\r\n\"I am taking no chance,\" he said; \"I almost jumped out of them that\r\ntime. They ought to send men out with a red flag before they pull off a\r\nblast like that.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel then left us and with the whispering lieutenant and runners\r\nin advance, we continued toward the front.\r\n\r\n\"Walk in parties of two,\" was the order of the soft-toned subaltern.\r\n\"Each party keep ten yards apart. Don't smoke. Don't talk. This road is\r\nreached by their field pieces. They also cover it with indirect machine\r\ngun fire. They sniped the brigade commander right along here this\r\nmorning. He had to get down into the mud. I can afford to lose some of\r\nyou, but not the entire party. If anything comes over, you are to jump\r\ninto the communicating trenches on the right side of the road.\"\r\n\r\nHis instructions were obeyed and it was almost with relief that, ten\r\nminutes later, we followed him down the slippery side of the muddy bank\r\nand landed in front of a dugout.\r\n\r\nIn the long, narrow, low-ceilinged shelter which completely tunnelled\r\nthe road at a depth of twenty feet, two twenty-year-old Americans were\r\nhugging a brazier filled with charcoal. In this dugout was housed a\r\ngroup from a machine gun battalion, some of whose members were snoring\r\nin a double tier of bunks on the side.\r\n\r\nDeep trenches at the other end of the dugout led to the gun pits, where\r\nthis new arm of the service operated at ranges of two miles. These\r\nspecial squads fired over the heads of those in front of them or over\r\nthe contours of the ground and put down a leaden barrage on the front\r\nline of the Germans. The firing not only was indirect but was without\r\ncorrection from the rectifying observation, of which the artillery had\r\nthe benefit by watching the burst of their missiles.\r\n\r\nRegaining the road, we walked on through the ruins on the edge of the\r\nvillage of Seicheprey, where our way led through a drunken colony of\r\nleaning walls and brick piles.\r\n\r\nHere was the battalion headquarters, located underneath the old stones\r\nof a barn which was topped by the barest skeleton of a roof. What had\r\nbeen the first floor of the structure had been weighted down heavily\r\nwith railroad iron and concrete to form the roof of the commander's\r\ndugout. The sides of the decrepit structure bulged outward and were\r\nprevented from bursting by timber props radiating on all sides like the\r\nlegs of a centipede. A mule team stood in front of the dugout.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" the whispering lieutenant inquired in hushed tones from a\r\nsoldier in the road, as he pointed over the mules to the battalion\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\n\"What's what?\" the soldier replied without respect.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity of night is a great reducer of ranks. In the mist officer\r\nand man look alike.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that?\" repeated \"Whispering Willie\" in lower, but angrier tones.\r\n\"What's that there?\" he reiterated, pointing at the mules.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see it's mules?\" replied the man in an immoderate tone of\r\nvoice, betraying annoyance.\r\n\r\nWe were spared what followed. The lieutenant undoubtedly confirmed his\r\nrank, and the man undoubtedly proffered unto him the respect withheld by\r\nmistake. When \"Whispering Willie\" joined us several minutes later in the\r\ndugout, his helmet rode on the back of his head, but his dignity was on\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nThe Battalion Commander, Major Griffith, was so glad to see us that he\r\nsent for another bottle of the murky grey water that came from a well on\r\none side of a well populated graveyard not fifty yards from his post.\r\n\r\n\"A good night,\" he said; \"haven't seen it so quiet in three years. We\r\nhave inter-battalion relief on. Some new companies are taking over the\r\nlines. Some of them are new to the front trenches and I'm going out with\r\nyou and put them up on their toes. Wait till I report in.\"\r\n\r\nHe rang the field telephone on the wall and waited for an answer. An oil\r\nlamp hung from a low ceiling over the map table. In the hot, smoky air\r\nwe quietly held our places while the connection was made.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" the Major said, \"operator, connect me with Milwaukee.\" Another\r\nwait----\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Milwaukee, this is Larson. I'm talking from Hamburg. I'm leaving\r\nthis post with a deck of cards and a runner. If you want me you can get\r\nme at Coney Island or Hinky Dink's. Wurtzburger will sit in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some code, Major,\" Lincoln Eyre, correspondent, said. \"What does a pack\r\nof cards indicate?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAVE OF FIRST AMERICAN KILLED IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nTranslation: Here Lie the First Soldiers of the Great Republic of the\r\nUnited States of America, Fallen on French Soil for Justice and for\r\nLiberty, November 3rd, 1917]\r\n\r\n\"Why, anybody who comes out here when he doesn't have to is a funny\r\ncard,\" the Major replied, \"and it looks as if I have a pack of them\r\nto-night. Fritz gets quite a few things that go over our wires and we\r\nget lots of his. All are tapped by induction.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the stuff we get is important and sometimes it isn't. Our\r\nwire tapping report last night carried a passage something like\r\nthis:--The German operator at one post speaking to the operator at\r\nanother said:\r\n\r\n\"'Hello, Herman, where did that last shell drop?'\r\n\r\n\"Second operator replied, 'It killed two men in a ration party in a\r\ncommunicating trench and spilt all the soup. No hot food for you\r\nto-night, Rudolph.'\r\n\r\n\"Herman replying: 'That's all right. We have got some beer here.'\r\n\r\n\"Then there was a confusion of sounds and a German was heard talking to\r\nsome one in his dugout. He said:\r\n\r\n\"'Hurry, here comes the lieutenant! Hide the can!'\r\n\r\n\"That's the way it goes,\" added the Major, \"but if we heard that the\r\nsociety editor of the _Fliegende Blaetter_ and half a dozen pencil\r\nstrafers were touring the German front line, we'd send 'em over\r\nsomething that would start 'em humming a hymn of hate. If they knew I\r\nwas joy riding a party of correspondents around the diggin's to-night,\r\nthey might give you something to write about and cost me a platoon or\r\ntwo. You're not worth it. Come on.\"\r\n\r\nOur party now numbered nine and we pushed off, stumbling through uneven\r\nlanes in the centre of dimly lit ruins. According to orders, we carried\r\ngas masks in a handy position.\r\n\r\nThis sector had a nasty reputation when it comes to that sample of\r\nTeutonic culture. Fritz's poison shells dropped almost noiselessly and,\r\nwithout a report, broke open, liberating to enormous expansion the\r\ninclosed gases. These spread in all directions, and, owing to the\r\nlowness and dampness of the terrain, the poison clouds were\r\nimperceptible both to sight or smell. They clung close to the ground to\r\nclaim unsuspecting victims.\r\n\r\n\"How are we to know if we are breathing gas or not?\" asked the\r\nPhiladelphia correspondent, Mr. Henri Bazin.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what you DON'T know,\" replied the Major.\r\n\r\n\"Then when will we know it is time to adjust our masks?\" Bazin\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\n\"When you see some one fall who has breathed it,\" the Major said.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose we breathe it first?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't need a mask,\" the Major replied, \"You see, it's quite\r\nsimple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" The sharp command, coming sternly but not too loud from\r\nsomewhere in the adjacent mist, brought the party to a standstill in the\r\nopen on the edge of the village. We remained notionless while the Major\r\nadvanced upon command from the unseen. He rejoined us in several minutes\r\nwith the remark that the challenge had come from one of his old men, and\r\nhe only hoped the new companies taking over the line that night were as\r\nmuch on their jobs.\r\n\r\n\"Relief night always is trying,\" the Major explained. \"Fritz always\r\nlikes to jump the newcomers before they get the lay of the land. He\r\ntried it on the last relief, but we burnt him.\"\r\n\r\nWhile talking the Major was leading the way through the first trench I\r\nhad ever seen above the surface of the ground. The bottom of the trench\r\nwas not only on a level with the surrounding terrain, but in some places\r\nit was even higher. Its walls, which rose almost to the height of a\r\nman's head, were made of large wicker woven cylinders filled with earth\r\nand stones.\r\n\r\nOur guide informed us that the land which we were traversing was so low\r\nthat any trench dug in the ground would simply be a ditch brimful of\r\nundrainable water, so that, inasmuch as this position was in the first\r\nline system, walls had been built on either side of the path to protect\r\npassers-by from shell fragments and indirect machine gun fire. We\r\nobserved one large break where a shell had entered during the evening.\r\n\r\nFarther on, this communicating passage, which was more corridor than\r\ntrench, reached higher ground and descended into the earth. We reeled\r\nthrough its zig-zag course, staggering from one slanting corner to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe sides were fairly well retained by French wicker work, but every\r\neighth or tenth duck board was missing, making it necessary for trench\r\ntravellers to step knee-deep in cold water or to jump the gap.\r\nCorrespondent Eyre, who was wearing shoes and puttees, abhorred these\r\nbreaks.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Major's post of command, which he used during intense\r\naction, and some distance on, entered the front line. With the Major\r\nleading, we walked up to a place where two Americans were standing on a\r\nfiring step with their rifles extended across the parapet. They were\r\nsilently peering into the grey mist over No Man's Land. One of them\r\nlooked around as we approached. Apparently he recognised the Major's\r\ncane as a symbol of rank. He came to attention.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the Major said, \"is this the way you let us walk up on you? Why\r\ndon't you challenge me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you was an officer, sir,\" the man replied.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you are absolutely sure I am YOUR officer?\" the Major said slowly\r\nand coldly, with emphasis on the word \"your.\" \"Suppose I tell you I am a\r\nGerman officer and these men behind me are Germans. How do you know?\"\r\n\r\nWith a quick movement the American brought his rifle forward to the\r\nchallenge, his right hand slapping the wooden butt with an audible\r\nwhack.\r\n\r\n\"Advance one, and give the countersign,\" he said with a changed voice\r\nand manner and the Major, moving to within whispering distance, breathed\r\nthe word over the man's extended bayonet. Upon hearing it, the soldier\r\nlowered his gun and stood at attention.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to figure whether his relief over the scare was greater\r\nthan his fears of the censure he knew was coming.\r\n\r\n\"Next time anybody gets that close to you without being challenged,\" the\r\nMajor said, \"don't be surprised if it is a German. That's the way they\r\ndo it. They don't march in singing 'Deutschland Über Alles.'\r\n\r\n\"If you see them first, you might live through the war. If they see you\r\nfirst, we will have wasted a lot of Liberty bonds and effort trying to\r\nmake a soldier out of you. Now, remember, watch yourself.\"\r\n\r\nWe pushed on encountering longer patches of trench where duck boards\r\nwere entirely missing and where the wading sometimes was knee-deep. In\r\nsome places, either the pounding of shells or the thawing out of the\r\nground had pushed in the revetments, appreciably narrowing the way and\r\nmaking progress more difficult. Arriving at an unmanned firing step\r\nlarge enough to accommodate the party, we mounted and took a first look\r\nover the top.\r\n\r\nMoonlight now was stronger through the mist which hung fold over fold\r\nover the forbidden land between the opposing battle lines. At intervals\r\nnervous machine guns chattered their ghoulish gibberish or tut-tut-ted\r\naway chidingly like finicky spinsters. Their intermittent sputtering to\r\nthe right and left of us was unenlightening. We couldn't tell whether\r\nthey were speaking German or English. Occasional bullets whining\r\nsomewhere through that wet air gave forth sounds resembling the ripping\r\nof linen sheets.\r\n\r\nArtillery fire was the exception during the entire night but when a\r\nshell did trace its unseen arc through the mist mantle, its echoes gave\r\nit the sound of a street car grinding through an under-river tunnel or\r\nthe tube reverberations of a departing subway train.\r\n\r\nWe were two hundred yards from the German front lines. Between their\r\ntrenches and ours, at this point, was low land, so boggy as to be almost\r\nimpassable. The opposing lines hugged the tops of two small ridges.\r\n\r\nFifty yards in front was our wire barely discernible in the fog. The\r\nMajor interrupted five wordless reveries by expressing, with what almost\r\nseemed regretfulness, the fact that in all his fighting experience he\r\nhad never seen it \"so damn quiet.\" His observation passed without a\r\nremark from us.\r\n\r\nThe Major appeared to be itching for action and he got into official\r\nswing a hundred yards farther on, where a turn in the trench revealed to\r\nus the muffled figures of two young Americans, comfortably seated on\r\ngrenade boxes on the firing step.\r\n\r\nFrom their easy positions they could look over the top and watch all\r\napproaches without rising. Each one had a blanket wrapped about his legs\r\nand feet. They looked the picture of ease. Without moving, one, with his\r\nrifle across his lap, challenged the Major, advanced him, and received\r\nthe countersign. We followed the Major in time to hear his first\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they get the rocking chairs out here yet?\" he said with the\r\nprovoked air that customarily accompanies any condemnation of the\r\nquartermaster department.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the seated sentry. \"They didn't get here. The men we\r\nrelieved said that they never got anything out here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor the footstools?\" the Major continued, this time with an\r\nunmistakable tone.\r\n\r\nThe man didn't answer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you two think you are taking moon baths on the Riviera?\" the Major\r\nasked sternly. \"You are less than two hundred yards from the Germans.\r\nYou are all wrapped up like Egyptian mummies. Somebody could lean over\r\nthe top and snake off your head with a trench knife before you could get\r\nyour feet loose. Take those blankets off your feet and stand up.\"\r\n\r\nThe men arose with alacrity, shedding the blankets and removing the\r\ngrenade box chairs. The Major continued:\r\n\r\n\"You know you are not sitting in a club window in Fifth Avenue and\r\nwatching the girls go by. You're not looking for chickens out there.\r\nThere's a hawk over there and sometimes he carries off precious little\r\nlambs. Now, the next time anybody steps around the corner of that\r\ntrench, you be on your feet with your bayonet and gun ready to mix\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nThe lambs saluted as the Major moved off with a train of followers who,\r\nby this time, were beginning to feel that these trenches held other\r\nlambs, only they carried notebooks instead of cartridge belts.\r\n\r\nStopping in front of a dugout, the Major gathered us about to hear the\r\nconversation that was going on within. Through the cracks of the door,\r\nwe looked down a flight of steep stairs, dug deep into this battlefield\r\ngraveyard. There were lights in the chamber below and the sound of\r\nvoices came up to us. One voice was singing softly.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, the infantry, the infantry, with the dirt behind their ears,\r\n    The infantry, the infantry, they don't get any beers,\r\n    The cavalry, the artillery, and the lousy engineers,\r\n    They couldn't lick the infantry in a hundred million years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got a brother in the artillery,\" came another voice, \"but I am ready\r\nto disown him. They talk a lot about this counter battery work, but it's\r\nall bunk. A battery in position has nice deep dugouts and hot chow all\r\nthe time. They gets up about 9 o'clock in the morning and shaves up all\r\nnice for the day.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout 10 o'clock the captain says, 'I guess we will drop a few shells\r\non that German battery on the other side of the hill.' So they pops off\r\nforty or fifty rounds in that general direction and don't hit anything\r\n'cause the German battery immediately roots down into its nice, deep\r\ndugouts. As soon as our battery lays off and gets back into its holes,\r\nthe German battery comes out and pops back forty or fifty at 'em and, of\r\ncourse, don't hurt them neither.\r\n\r\n\"Then it is time for lunch, and while both of these here batteries is\r\neating, they get so sore about not having hit each other during the\r\nmorning, that they just call off counter battery work for the day and\r\nturn their guns on the front lines and blow hell out of the infantry. I\r\nhaven't got any use for an artilleryman. I'm beginning to think all of\r\nthem Germans and Allies are alike and has an agreement against the\r\ndoughboys.\"\r\n\r\nThe Major interrupted by rapping sharply on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" was the polite and innocent invitation guilelessly spoken\r\nfrom below. The Major had his helmet on, so he couldn't tear his hair.\r\n\r\n\"Come up here, you idiots, every one of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Major directed his voice down into the hole in an unmistakable and\r\nofficial tone. There was a scurrying of feet and four men emerged\r\ncarrying their guns. They were lined up against the trench wall.\r\n\r\n\"At midnight,\" the Major began, \"in your dugout in the front line forty\r\nyards from the Germans, with no sentry at the door, you hear a knock on\r\nthe door and you shout, 'Come in.' I commend your politeness, and I know\r\nthat's what your mothers taught you to say when visitors come, but this\r\nisn't any tea fight out here. One German could have wiggled over the top\r\nhere and stood in this doorway and captured all four of you\r\nsingle-handed, or he could have rolled a couple of bombs down that hole\r\nand blown all of you to smithereens. What's your aim in life--hard\r\nlabour in a German prison camp or a nice little wooden cross out here\r\nfour thousand miles from Punkinville? Why wasn't there any sentry at\r\nthat door?\"\r\n\r\nThe question remained unanswered but the incident had its effect on the\r\nquartet. Without orders, all four decided to spend the remainder of the\r\nnight on the firing step with their eyes glued on the enemy's line. They\r\nsimply hadn't realised they were really in the war. The Major knew this,\r\nbut made a mental reservation of which the commander of this special\r\nplatoon got full benefit before the night was over.\r\n\r\nThe front line from here onward followed a small ridge running generally\r\neast and west, but now bearing slightly to the northward. We were told\r\nthe German line ran in the same general direction, but at this point\r\nbore to the southward.\r\n\r\nThe opposing lines in the direction of our course were converging and we\r\nwere approaching the place where they were the closest in the sector. If\r\nGerman listening posts heard the progress of our party through the line,\r\nonly a telephone call back to the artillery was necessary to plant a\r\nshell among us, as every point on the system was registered.\r\n\r\nAs we silently considered various eventualities immaterial to the\r\nprosecution of the war but not without personal concern, our progress\r\nwas brought to a sudden standstill.\r\n\r\n\"Huh-huh-halt!\" came a drawn-out command in a husky, throaty stammer,\r\nweaker than a whisper, from an undersized tin-hatted youngster planted\r\nin the centre of the trench not ten feet in front of us. His left foot\r\nwas forward and his bayoneted rifle was held ready for a thrust.\r\n\r\n\"Huh-huh-huh-halt!\" came the nervous, whispering command again, although\r\nwe had been motionless since the first whisper.\r\n\r\nWe heard a click as the safety catch on the man's rifle lock was thrown\r\noff and the weapon made ready to discharge. The Major was watching the\r\nnervous hand that rested none too steadily on the trigger stop. He\r\nstepped to one side, but the muzzle of the gun followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Huh-huh-huh-halt! I tuh-tuh-tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThis time the whisper vibrated with nervous tension and there was no\r\nmistaking the state of mind of the sentry.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy,\" replied the Major with attempted calm. \"I'm waiting for\r\nyou to challenge me. Don't get excited. This is the commanding\r\nofficer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the countersign?\" came from the voice in a hard strain.\r\n\r\n\"Troy,\" the Major said, and the word seemed to bring worlds of\r\nreassurance to the rifleman, who sighed with relief, but forgot to move\r\nhis rifle until the Major said:\r\n\r\n\"Will you please take that gun off me and put the safety back in?\"\r\n\r\nThe nervous sentry moved the gun six inches to the right and we\r\ncorrespondents, standing in back of the Major, looked into something\r\nthat seemed as big as the La Salle street tunnel. I jumped out of range\r\nbehind the Major. Eyre plunged knee-deep into water out of range, and\r\nWoods with the rubber boots started to go over the top.\r\n\r\nThe click of the replaced safety lock sounded unusually like the snap of\r\na trigger, but no report followed and three hearts resumed their\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\n\"There is no occasion to get excited,\" the Major said to the young\r\nsoldier in a fatherly tone. \"I'm glad to see you are wide-awake and on\r\nthe job. Don't feel any fears for your job and just remember that with\r\nthat gun and bayonet in your hands you are better than any man who turns\r\nthat trench corner or crosses out there. You've got the advantage of\r\nhim, and besides that you are a better man than he is.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentry, now smiling, saluted the Major as the latter conducted the\r\nparty quietly around the trench corner and into a sap leading directly\r\nout into No Man's Land. Twice the trench passed under broad belts of\r\nbarbed wire, which we were cautioned to avoid with our helmets, because\r\nany sound was undesirable for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of this cautious advance, we reached a small\r\nlistening post that marked the closest point in the sector to the German\r\nline. Several silent sentries were crouching on the edge of the pit.\r\nGunny sacks covered the hole and screened it in front and above. We\r\nremained silent while the Major in the lowest whisper spoke with a\r\ncorporal and learned that except for two or three occasions, when the\r\nwatchers thought they heard sounds near our wire, the night had been\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nWe departed as silently as we came. The German line from a distance of\r\nforty yards looked no different from its appearance at a greater\r\ndistance, but since it was closer, it was carried with a constant tingle\r\nof anticipation.\r\n\r\nInto another communicating trench and through better walled\r\nfortifications of splintered forest, the Major led us to a place where\r\nthe recent shelling had changed twenty feet of trench into a gaping\r\ngulley almost without sides and waist-deep in water. A working detail\r\nwas endeavouring to repair the damage. In parties of two, we left the\r\ntrench and crossed an open space on the level. The forty steps we\r\ncovered across that forbidden ground were like stolen fruit. Such\r\nrapture! Bazin, who was seeking a title for a book, pulled \"Eureka!\"\r\n\r\n\"Over the top armed with a pencil,\" he said. \"Not bad, eh?\"\r\n\r\nBack in Seicheprey, just before the Major left us for our long trip back\r\nto quarters, he led the way to the entrance of a cemetery, well kept in\r\nthe midst of surrounding chaos. Graves of French dead ranged row upon\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to show you some of the fellows that held this line until\r\nwe took it over,\" he said simply. \"Our own boys that we've lost since\r\nwe've been here, are buried down in the next village.\"\r\n\r\nWe silently saluted the spot as we passed it thirty minutes later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT OUR GUNS CUT LOOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as our forces had made themselves at home in the Toul sector, it\r\nwas inevitable that belligerent activity would increase and this, in\r\nspite of the issuance of strict orders that there should be no\r\ndevelopment of the normal daily fire. Our men could not entirely resist\r\nthe temptation to start something.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the Germans soon began to suspect that they were\r\nfaced by different troops from the ones who had been confronting them.\r\nThe enemy set out to verify his suspicions. He made his first raid on\r\nthe American line.\r\n\r\nIt was in a dense mist on the morning of January 30th that the Germans\r\nlowered a terrific barrage on one of our advance listening posts and\r\nthen rushed the position with a raiding party outnumbering the\r\ndefendants ten to one.\r\n\r\nTwo Americans held that post--five more succeeded in making their way\r\nthrough the storm of falling shells and in coming to the assistance of\r\nthe first two. That made seven Americans in the fight. When the fighting\r\nceased, every one of the seven had been accounted for in the three\r\nitems, dead, wounded or captured.\r\n\r\nThat little handful of Americans, fought, died or were wounded in the\r\npositions which they had been ordered to hold. Although the engagement\r\nwas an extremely minor one, it being the first of its kind on the\r\nAmerican sector, it was sufficient to give the enemy some idea of the\r\ndetermination and fighting qualities of the individual American\r\nsoldier. Their comrades were proud of them, and were inclined to\r\nconsider the exploit, \"Alamo stuff.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the defenders were killed, four were wounded, and one was\r\ncaptured. The wounded men reported that the captured American continued\r\nto fight even after being severely wounded. He was the last to remain on\r\nhis feet and when a bomb blew his rifle from his hand and injured his\r\narm, he succumbed to superior numbers and was carried off by his\r\ncaptors.\r\n\r\nAfter the hurried sortie, the Germans beat a hasty retreat so that the\r\nposition was reoccupied immediately by another American detail.\r\n\r\nThe \"Alamo\" seven had not been taken by surprise. Through a downpour of\r\nrather badly placed shells, they held their position on the firing step\r\nand worked both their rifles and machine guns against the raiding party,\r\nwhich they could not see, but knew would be advancing behind the curtain\r\nof fire. Hundreds of empty cartridges and a broken American bayonet\r\nconstituted impartial testimony to the fierceness of the fighting. After\r\nthe first rush, in which the defenders accounted for a number of\r\nGermans, the fighting began at close quarters, the enemy peppering the\r\nlistening post with hand-grenades.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the German barrage had been lifted and lengthened until\r\nit was lowered again between the \"Alamo\" seven and their comrades in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThere were calls to surrender, but no acceptances. The fighting became\r\nhand-to-hand with bayonet and gun butt. The defenders fought on in the\r\nhope that assistance soon would arrive from the American artillery.\r\n\r\nBut the Germans had planned the raid well. Their first barrage cut all\r\ntelephone wires leading back from our front lines and the signal rocket\r\nwhich one of the men in the listening post had fired into the air, had\r\nbeen smothered in the dense mist. That rocket had called for a\r\ndefensive barrage from American artillery and when no answer came to it,\r\na second one was fired, but that also was snuffed out by the fog.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the raid was that the Germans had captured one of our\r\nwounded men and had thereby identified the organisation opposing them as\r\nthe First Regular Division of the United States Army, composed of the\r\n16th, 18th, 26th, and 28th Regular U. S. Infantry Regiments and the 5th,\r\n6th and 7th Regular U. S. Army Field Artillery. The division was under\r\nthe command of Major General Robert Lee Bullard.\r\n\r\nIn the days and weeks that followed, the daily exchange of shells on the\r\nsector increased to two and three times the number it had been before\r\nour men arrived there. There were nightly patrols in No Man's Land and\r\nseveral instances where these patrols met in the dark and engaged one\r\nanother with casualties on both sides.\r\n\r\nOne night a little over a month later--the early morning of March 4th,\r\nto be exact--it was my privilege to witness from an exceptional vantage\r\npoint, the first planned and concentrated American artillery action\r\nagainst the enemy. The German lines selected for this sudden downpour of\r\nshell, comprised two small salients jutting out from the enemy's\r\npositions in the vicinity of the ruined village of Lahayville, in the\r\nsame sector.\r\n\r\nIn company with an orderly who had been despatched as my guide, I\r\nstarted from an artillery battalion headquarters shortly before\r\nmidnight, and together we made our way up the dark muddy road that led\r\nthrough the dense Bois de la Reine to the battery positions. Half an\r\nhour's walk and O'Neil, the guide, led me off the road into a darker\r\ntunnel of overlaced boughs where we stumbled along on the ties of a\r\nnarrow gauge railroad that conveyed heavy shells from the road to the\r\nguns. We passed through several gun pits and stopped in front of a huge\r\n_abri_ built entirely above ground.\r\n\r\nIts walls and roof must have been between five and seven feet thick and\r\nwere made from layers of logs, sandbags, railroad iron and slabs of\r\nconcrete reinforced with steel. It looked impenetrable.\r\n\r\n\"Battery commander's headquarters,\" O'Neil said to me as we entered a\r\nsmall hot room lighted by two oil lamps and a candle. Three officers, at\r\ntwo large map tables, were working on sheets of figures. Two wooden\r\nbunks, one above the other, and two posts supporting the low ceiling\r\ncompleted the meagre furnishings of the room. A young officer looked up\r\nfrom his work, O'Neil saluted, and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"The Major sent me up with this correspondent. He said you could let him\r\ngo wherever he could see the fun and that you are not responsible for\r\nhis safety.\" O'Neil caught the captain's smile at the closing remark and\r\nwithdrew. The captain showed me the map.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" he said, indicating a spot with his finger, \"and here's\r\nwhat we are aiming at to-night. There are two places you can stay to see\r\nthe fun. You can stay in this shelter and hear the sound of it, or you\r\ncan go up a little further front to this point, and mount the platform\r\nin our observation tree. In this _abri_ you are safe from splinters and\r\nshrapnel but a direct hit would wipe us out. In the tree you are exposed\r\nto direct hits and splinters from nearby bursts but at least you can see\r\nthe whole show. It's the highest point around here and overlooks the\r\nwhole sector.\"\r\n\r\nI sensed that the captain expected a busy evening and looked forward\r\nwith no joy to possible interference from a questioning visitor, so I\r\nchose the tree.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said, \"you've got helmet and gas masks, I see. Now how's\r\nyour watch? Take the right time off mine. We have just synchronised ours\r\nwith headquarters. Zero is one o'clock. You had better start now.\"\r\n\r\nHe called for an orderly with a German name, and the two of us left.\r\nBefore I was out of the room, the captain had returned to his\r\nmathematics and was figuring out the latest range variations and making\r\nallowances for latest developments in wind, temperature and barometer.\r\nThe orderly with the German name and I plunged again into the trees and\r\nbrought up shortly on the edge of a group of men who were standing in\r\nthe dark near a large tree trunk. I could hear several other men and\r\nsome stamping horses off to one side.\r\n\r\nThe party at the foot of the tree was composed of observers, signal\r\nlinemen and runners. All of them were enlisted men. I inquired who were\r\nto be my comrades in the tree top and three presented themselves. One\r\nsaid his name was Pat Guahn, the second gave his as Peter Griffin and\r\nthe third acknowledged Mike Stanton. I introduced myself and Griffin\r\nsaid, \"I see we are all from the same part of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes to one, we started up the tree, mounting by rudely\r\nconstructed ladders that led from one to the other of the four crudely\r\nfashioned platforms. We reached the top breathless and with no false\r\nimpressions about the stability of our swaying perch. The tree seemed to\r\nbe the tallest in the forest and nothing interfered with our forward\r\nview. The platform was a bit shaky and Guahn put my thoughts to words\r\nand music by softly singing--\r\n\r\n    \"Rock-a-bye baby, in the tree top,\r\n    When the shell comes the runners all flop,\r\n    When the shell busts, good-bye to our station,\r\n    We're up in a tree, bound for damnation.\"\r\n\r\nThe compass gives us north and we locate in the forward darkness an\r\napproximate sweep of the front lines. Guahn is looking for the flash of\r\na certain German gun and it will be his duty to keep his eyes trained\r\nthrough the fork of a certain marked twig within arm's reach.\r\n\r\n\"If she speaks, we want to know it,\" Guahn says; \"I can see her from\r\nhere when she flashes and there's another man who can see her from\r\nanother place. You see we get an intersection of angles on her and then\r\nwe know where she is just as though she had sent her address. Two\r\nminutes later we drop a card on her and keep her warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that that gun from Russia we heard about?\" Griffin asks.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answers Guahn, \"we are not looking for her from that station.\r\nBesides, she isn't Russian. She was made by the British, used by the\r\nRussians, captured by the Germans and in turn is used by them against\r\nAmericans. We have found pieces of her shell and they all have an\r\nEnglish trade mark on them. She fires big eight inch stuff.\"\r\n\r\nGriffin is watching in another direction for another flash and Stanton\r\nis on the lookout for signal flares and the flash of a signal light\r\nprojector which might be used in case the telephone communication is\r\ndisturbed by enemy fire. It is then that the runners at the base of the\r\ntree must carry the message back by horse.\r\n\r\nOnly an occasional thump is heard forward in the darkness. Now and then\r\nmachine guns chatter insanely as they tuck a seam in the night. At\r\ninfrequent intervals, a star shell curves upward, bursts, suspends its\r\nsilent whiteness in mid-air, and dies.\r\n\r\nIn our tree top all seems quiet and so is the night. There is no moon\r\nand only a few stars are out. A penetrating dampness takes the place of\r\ncold and there is that in the air that threatens a change of weather.\r\n\r\nThe illuminated dial of my watch tells me that it is three minutes of\r\none and I communicate the information to the rest of the Irish quartet.\r\nIn three minutes, the little world that we look upon from our tree top\r\nis due to change with terrific suddenness and untold possibilities.\r\n\r\nSomewhere below in the darkness and to one side, I hear the clank of a\r\nponderous breech lock as the mechanism is closed on a shell in one of\r\nthe heavy guns. Otherwise all remains silent.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes of one. Each minute seems to drag like an hour. It is\r\nimpossible to keep one's mind off that unsuspecting group of humans out\r\nthere in that little section of German trench upon which the heavens are\r\nabout to fall. Griffin leans over the railing and calls to the runners\r\nto stand by the horses' heads until they become accustomed to the coming\r\nroar.\r\n\r\nOne minute of one. We grip the railing and wait.\r\n\r\nTwo flashes and two reports, the barest distinguishable interval, and\r\nthe black horizon belches red. From extreme left to extreme right the\r\nflattened proscenium in front of us glows with the ghastliness of the\r\nBroockon.\r\n\r\nWaves of light flush the dark vault above like the night sky over South\r\nChicago's blast furnaces. The heavens reflect the glare. The flashes\r\nrange in colour from blinding yellow to the softest tints of pink. They\r\nseem to form themselves from strange combinations of greens and mauves\r\nand lavenders.\r\n\r\nThe sharp shattering crash of the guns reaches our ears almost on the\r\ninstant. The forest shakes and our tree top sways with the slam of the\r\nheavies close by. The riven air whimpers with the husky whispering of\r\nthe rushing load of metal bolts passing above us.\r\n\r\nLooking up into that void, we deny the uselessness of the act and seek\r\nin vain to follow the trains of those unseen things that make the air\r\nelectric with their presence. We hear them coming, passing, going, but\r\nsee not one of them.\r\n\r\n\"There's whole blacksmith's shops sailing over our heads on the way to\r\nGermany,\" Pat Guahn shouts in my ear. \"I guess the Dutchman sure knows\r\nhow to call for help. He doesn't care for that first wallop, and he\r\nthinks he would like about a half million reserves from the Russian\r\nfront.\"\r\n\r\n\"That darkness out in No Man's Land don't make any hit with him either,\"\r\nStanton contributes. \"He's got it lit up so bright I'm homesick for\r\nBroadway.\"\r\n\r\nNow comes the thunder of the shell arrivals. You know the old covered\r\nwooden bridges that are still to be found in the country. Have you ever\r\nheard a team of horses and a farm wagon thumping and rumbling over such\r\na bridge on the trot?\r\n\r\nMultiply the horse team a thousand times. Lash the animals from the trot\r\nto the wild gallop. Imagine the sound of their stampede through the\r\nechoing wooden structure and you approach in volume and effect the\r\nrumble and roar of the steel as it rained down on that little German\r\nsalient that night.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to them babies bustin',\" says Griffin. \"I'm betting them\r\ngroundhogs is sure huntin' their holes right now and trying to dig clear\r\nthrough to China.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the sound and sight of that opening salvo from all guns, from\r\nthe small trench mortars in the line, the lightest field pieces behind\r\nthem, the heavy field pieces about us and the ponderous railroad\r\nartillery located behind us.\r\n\r\nIts crash has slashed the inkiness in front of us with a lurid red\r\nmeridian. I don't know how many hands had pulled lanyards on exactly the\r\nsame instant but the consequent spread of fire looked like one\r\ncontinuous flame.\r\n\r\nNow the \"seventy-fives\" are speaking, not in unison, but at various\r\nspeeds, limited only by the utmost celerity of the sweating gun crews.\r\n\r\nBut the German front line is not the only locality receiving unsolicited\r\nattention. Enemy gun positions far behind the lines are being plastered\r\nwith high explosives and anesthetised with gas shells.\r\n\r\nSo effective is the American artillery neutralisation of the German\r\nbatteries, that it is between fifteen and twenty minutes before the\r\nfirst enemy gun replies to the terrific barrage. And though expected\r\nmomentarily, a German counter barrage fails to materialise.\r\n\r\nIn our tree top we wait for the enemy's counter shelling but the\r\nretaliation does not develop. When occupying an exposed position, the\r\nsuspense of waiting for an impending blow increases in tenseness as the\r\ndelay continues and the expectations remain unrealised. With no\r\ninclination to be unreasonable, one even prays for the speedy delivery\r\nof the blow in the same way that the man with the aching tooth urges the\r\ndentist to speed up and have it over with.\r\n\r\n\"Why in hell don't they come back at us?\" Griffin asks. \"I've had myself\r\nall tuned up for the last twenty minutes to have a leg blown off and be\r\nthankful. I hate this waiting stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your shirt on, Pete,\" Stanton remarks. \"Give 'em a chance to get\r\ntheir breath and come out of their holes. That barrage drove 'em down a\r\ncouple hundred feet into the ground and they haven't any elevators to\r\ncome up on. We'll hear from 'em soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nWe did, but it was not more than a whisper as compared with what they\r\nwere receiving from our side of the line. The German artillery came into\r\nlethargic action after the American barrage had been in constant\r\noperation for thirty minutes and then the enemy's fire was only\r\ndesultory. Only an occasional shell from Kulturland came our way, and\r\neven they carried a rather tired, listless buzz, as though they didn't\r\nknow exactly where they were going and didn't care.\r\n\r\nSix or eight of them hummed along a harmless orbit not far above our\r\ntree top and fell in the forest. It certainly looked as though we were\r\nshooting all the hard-stuff and the German end of the fireworks party\r\nwas all coloured lights and Roman candles. Of the six shells that passed\r\nus, three failed to explode upon landing.\r\n\r\n\"That makes three dubs,\" said Guahn.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean dubs,\" Stanton corrected him, \"you mean duds and even\r\nthen you are wrong. Those were gas pills. They just crack open quietly\r\nso you don't know it until you've sniffed yourself dead. Listen, you'll\r\nhear the gas alert soon.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, we heard through the firing the throaty gurgling of\r\nthe sirens. The alarm started on our right and spread from station to\r\nstation through the woods. We adjusted the respirators and turned our\r\nmuffled faces toward the firing line. Through the moisture fogged\r\nglasses of my mask, I looked first upon my companions on this rustic\r\nscaffold above the forest.\r\n\r\nWar's demands had removed our appearances far from the human. Our heads\r\nwere topped with uncomfortable steel casques, harder than the backs of\r\nturtles. Our eyes were large, flat, round glazed surfaces unblinking and\r\nowl-like. Our faces were shapeless folds of black rubber cloth. Our\r\nlungs sucked air through tubes from a canvass bag under our chins and we\r\nwere inhabiting a tree top like a family of apes. It really required\r\nimagination to make it seem real.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like the party is over,\" came the muffled remark from the masked\r\nfigure beside me. The cannonading was dying down appreciably. The\r\nblinking line of lights in front of us grew less.\r\n\r\nA terrific upward blast of red and green flame from the ground close to\r\nour tree, reminded us that one heavy still remained under firing orders.\r\nThe flash seen through the forest revealed in intricate tracings the\r\nintertwining limbs and branches of the trees. It presented the\r\nappearance of a piece of strong black lace spread out and held at arm's\r\nlength in front of a glowing grate.\r\n\r\nFrom the German lines an increased number of flares shot skyward and as\r\nthe cannon cracks ceased, save for isolated booms, the enemy machine\r\nguns could be heard at work, riveting the night with sprays of lead and\r\nsounding for all the world like a scourge of hungry woodpeckers.\r\n\r\n\"God help any of the doughboys that are going up against any of that\r\nstuff,\" Griffin observed through his mask.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about our doughboys,\" replied Stanton; \"they are all safe\r\nin their trenches now. That's most likely the reason why our guns were\r\nordered to lay off. I guess Fritzie got busy with his typewriters too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\nI descended the tree, leaving my companions to wait for the orders\r\nnecessary for their departure. Unfamiliar with the unmarked paths of\r\nthe forest and guided only as to general directions, I made my way\r\nthrough the trees some distance in search of the road back from the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nA number of mud and water-filled shell holes intervened to make the\r\nexertion greater and consequently the demand upon lungs for air greater.\r\nAfter floundering several kilometres through a strange forest with a gas\r\nmask on, one begins to appreciate the temptation that comes to tear off\r\nthe stifling nose bag and risk asphyxiation for just one breath of fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nA babel of voices in the darkness to one side guided me to a log cabin\r\nwhere I learned from a sentry that the gas scare had just been called\r\noff. Continuing on the road, I collided head on in the darkness with a\r\nwalking horse. Its rider swore and so did I, with slightly the advantage\r\nover him as his head was still encased. I told him the gas alarm was off\r\nand he tore away the mask with a sigh of relief. I left him while he was\r\nremoving the horse's gas mask.\r\n\r\nA light snow was beginning to fall as I said good-night to the battalion\r\ncommander in front of his roadside shack. A party of mounted runners was\r\npassing on the way to their quarters. With an admirable lack of dignity\r\nquite becoming a national guard cavalry major in command of regular army\r\nartillery, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, men, we licked hell out of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Toul sector, during its occupation by Americans, always maintained a\r\nhigh daily rating of artillery activity. The opposing forces were\r\ncontinually planning surprises on one another. At any minute of the\r\nnight or day a terrific bombardment of high explosive or gas might break\r\nout on either side. Both sides operated their sound ranging apparatus\r\nto a rather high degree of efficiency.\r\n\r\nBy these delicate instruments we could locate the exact position of an\r\nunseen enemy battery. Following that location, the battery would\r\nimmediately be visited with a concentrated downpour of hot steel\r\nintended to wipe it out of existence. The enemy did as much for us, so\r\nthat in the artillery, when the men were not actually manning the guns\r\nin action, they were digging gun pits for reserve positions which they\r\ncould occupy if the enemy happened to get the proper range of the old\r\npositions. In this casual counter battery work our artillery adopted a\r\nsystem by which many lives were saved.\r\n\r\nIf a German battery began shelling one of our battery positions, the\r\nartillerymen in that position were not called upon to stand by their\r\nguns and return the fire. The order would be given to temporarily\r\nabandon the position and the men would be withdrawn a safe distance. The\r\nGerman battery that was firing would be responded to, two to one, by\r\nother American batteries located nearby and which did not happen to be\r\nunder fire at the time. By this system we conserved our strength.\r\n\r\nOur infantry was strong in their praise of the artillery. I observed\r\nthis particularly one day on the Toul front when General Pershing\r\ndropped in unexpectedly at the division headquarters, then located in\r\nthe hillside village of Bourcq. While the commander and his party were\r\nawaiting a meal which was being prepared, four muddy figures tramped\r\ndown the hallway of the Château. Through the doorway the general\r\nobserved their entrance.\r\n\r\nThe two leading figures were stolid German soldiers, prisoners of war,\r\nand behind them marched their captors, two excusably proud young\r\nAmericans. One of them carried his bayoneted rifle at the ready, while\r\nthe second carried the equipment which had been taken from the\r\nprisoners. The American commander ordered the group brought before him\r\nand asked one of the Americans to relate the story of the capture.\r\n\r\n\"We in the infantry got 'em, sir,\" replied one, \"but the artillery\r\ndeserved most of the credit. It happened just at dawn this morning. Jim\r\nhere, and myself, were holding down an advance machine gun post when the\r\nGermans laid down a flock of shells on our first line trench. We just\r\nkept at the gun ready to let them have it if they started to come over.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty soon we saw them coming through the mist and we began to put it\r\nto 'em. I think we got a bunch of them but they kept on coming.\r\n\r\n\"Then somebody back in our first line shot up the signal for a barrage\r\nin our sector. It couldn't have been a minute before our cannon cut\r\nloose and the shells began to drop right down in the middle of the\r\nraiding party.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good heavy barrage, sir, and it cut clean through the centre\r\nof the raiders. Two Germans were ahead of the rest and the barrage\r\nlanded right in back of them. The rest started running back toward their\r\nlines, but the first pair could not go back because they would have had\r\nto pass through the barrage. I kept the machine gun going all the time\r\nand Jim showed himself above the trench and pointed his rifle at the\r\ncut-off pair.\r\n\r\n\"They put up their hands right quick and we waved to 'em to come in.\r\nThey took it on the jump and landed in our trench as fast as they could.\r\nWe took their equipment off them and we were ordered to march them back\r\nhere to headquarters. That's all there was to it, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy in front of Toul manifested an inordinate anxiety to know more\r\nabout the strength of our forces and the character of the positions we\r\noccupied. A captured German document issued to the Fifth Bavarian\r\nLandwehr infantry brigade instructed every observer and patrol to do his\r\nor its best \"to bring information about the new enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is known as yet about the methods of fighting or leadership,\"\r\nthe document set forth, \"and all information possible must be gathered\r\nas to particular features of American fighting and outpost tactics. This\r\nwill then be used for extending the information bulletin. Any\r\nobservation or identification, however insignificant, may be of the\r\ngreatest value.\"\r\n\r\nThe document directed that data on the following questions be obtained:\r\n\r\n\"Are sentry posts sentry posts or stronger posts? Further advanced\r\nreconnoitring patrols? Manner of challenging? Behaviour on post during\r\nday and night? Vigilance? Ambush tactics and cunning?\r\n\r\n\"Do they shoot and signal on every occasion? Do the posts hold their\r\nground on the approach of a patrol, or do they fall back?\r\n\r\n\"Are the Americans careful and cautious? Are they noisy? What is their\r\nbehaviour during smoke screens?\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy's keen desire to acquire this information was displayed in the\r\ndesperate efforts it made. One day the French troops occupying the\r\ntrenches on the right flank of the American sector, encountered a\r\nsoldier in an American uniform walking through their positions.\r\n\r\nHe was stopped and questioned. He said he had been one of an American\r\npatrol that had gone out the night before, that he had lost his way in\r\nNo Man's Land and that he thought he was returning to his own trenches,\r\nwhen he dropped into those held by the French.\r\n\r\nAlthough the man wore our uniform and spoke excellent English and seemed\r\nstraightforward in his replies, as to his name and rank and\r\norganisation, the French officer before whom he was brought was not\r\ncompletely satisfied. To overcome this hesitancy, the suspected man\r\nopened his shirt and produced an American identification tag verifying\r\nhis answers.\r\n\r\nThe French officer, still suspicious, ordered the man held while he\r\ntelephoned to the American organisation mentioned to ascertain whether\r\nany man of the name given was missing from that unit.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the American captain. \"We lost him last October, when we\r\nwere in the front line down in the Luneville sector. He was captured\r\nwith eight others by the Germans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've got him over here on your right flank. He came into our\r\nlines this morning--\" the French officer started to say.\r\n\r\n\"Bully,\" came the American interruption over the wire. \"He's escaped\r\nfrom the Germans and has come clear through their lines to get back to\r\nhis company. He'll get a D. S. C. for that. We'll send right over for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when we questioned him,\" replied the Frenchman, \"he said he left\r\nyour lines only last night on patrol and got lost in No Man's Land.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come right over and look at that party, myself,\" the American\r\ncaptain hastily replied.\r\n\r\nHe reached the French officer's dugout several hours later and the\r\nsuspect was ordered brought in.\r\n\r\n\"He must be crazy, sir,\" the French orderly said. \"He tried to kill\r\nhimself a few minutes ago and we have had to hold him.\"\r\n\r\nThe man was brought into the dugout between two poilus who held his\r\narms. The American captain took a careful look and said:\r\n\r\n\"That's not our man. He wears our uniform correctly and that's our\r\nregulation identification tag. Both of them must have been taken away\r\nfrom our man when he was captured. This man is an impostor.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's more than that,\" replied the Frenchman with a smile. \"He's a\r\nGerman spy.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner made no reply, but later made a full confession of his act,\r\nand also gave to his interrogators much valuable information, which,\r\nhowever, did not save him from paying the penalty in front of a firing\r\nsquad. When he faced the rifles, he was not wearing the stolen uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINTO PICARDY TO MEET THE GERMAN PUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the end of March, 1918, just at the time when the American\r\nExpeditionary Forces were approaching the desired degree of military\r\neffectiveness, the fate of civilisation was suddenly imperilled by the\r\nmaterialisation of the long expected German offensive.\r\n\r\nThis push, the greatest the enemy had ever attempted, began on March\r\n21st, and the place that Hindenburg selected for the drive was Picardy,\r\nthe valley of the Somme, the ancient cockpit of Europe. On that day the\r\nGerman hordes, scores upon scores of divisions, hurled themselves\r\nagainst the British line between Arras and Noyon.\r\n\r\nBefore that tremendous weight of manpower, the Allied line was forced to\r\ngive and one of the holding British armies, the Fifth, gave ground on\r\nthe right flank, and with its left as a hinge, swung back like a gate,\r\nopening the way for the Germans toward Paris.\r\n\r\nThere have been many descriptions of the fierce fighting put up by the\r\nFrench and British to stem the German advance, but the most interesting\r\none that ever came to my notice, came from one of the few American\r\nsoldiers that participated in the defence. Two weeks after the opening\r\nof the battle and at a time when the German advance had been stopped, I\r\ncame upon this American in a United States Military Hospital at Dijon.\r\n\r\nAn interne led me to the bedside of Jimmy Brady, a former jockey from\r\nthe Pimlico turf in Baltimore, and now a proud wearer of Uncle Sam's\r\nkhaki. In his own quaint way, Jimmy told me the story of what a little\r\nhandful of Americans did in the great battle in Picardy. Jimmy knew.\r\nJimmy had been there.\r\n\r\n\"Lad,\" he said, \"I'm telling you it was a real jam. I learned one hell\r\nof a headful in the last ten days that I'll not be forgetting in the\r\nnext ten years. I've got new ideas about how long this war is goin' to\r\nlast. Of course, we're going to lick the Boches before it ends, but I've\r\nsorter given up the picture I had of myself marching up Fifth Avenue in\r\na victory parade on this coming Fourth of July. I'll say it can't be\r\ndone in that time.\r\n\r\n\"Our outfit from old ---- engineers, and believe me there's none better,\r\nhave been working up in the Somme country for the last two months. We\r\nwere billeted at Brie and most of our work had been throwing bridges\r\nacross the Canal du Nord about three miles south of Peronne. I'm telling\r\nyou the Somme ain't a river. It's a swamp, and they just hardly squeeze\r\nenough water outer it to make a canal which takes the place of a river.\r\n\r\n\"We was working under the British. Their old bridges over the canal were\r\nwooden affairs and most of them had signs on them reading, 'This bridge\r\nwon't hold a tank,' and that bridge wouldn't bear trotting horses, and\r\nso on. Some of 'em we tore down must have been put in for scenery\r\npurposes only. We were slamming up some husky looking steel structures\r\nlike you see in the States, and believe me it makes me sick to think\r\nthat we had to blow 'em all up again before the Boches got to 'em.\r\n\r\n\"I see by the papers that the battle began on the 21st, but I've got no\r\nmore idea about the date of it than the King of Honolulu. They say it's\r\nbeen on only about ten days, but I couldn't swear it hadn't been on\r\nsince New Year's Eve. It sure seemed a long time. As I told you, we were\r\nworking just south of Peronne on the main road between St. Quentin and\r\nAmiens. She started on a foggy morning and for two days the music kept\r\ngetting closer. On the first day, all traffic was frontward, men, guns,\r\nand camions going up towards the lines, and then the tide began to flow\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Ambulances and camions, full of poor wounded devils, filled the road,\r\nand then came labour battalions of chattering Chinks, Egyptians, and\r\nFiji Islanders and God knows what. None of these birds were lingering,\r\nbecause the enemy was sprinkling the roads with shells and sorter\r\nkeeping their marching spirits up. Orders came for us to ditch our packs\r\nand equipment all except spades, rifles, belts and canteens, and we set\r\noff toward the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind your map of the Somme? Well, we pulls up at Chaulnes for a\r\nbreath. It was a big depot and dump town--aeroplanes and everything\r\npiled up in it. We were ordered onto demolition work, being as we was\r\nstill classed as non-combatants. I don't know how many billions of\r\ndollars' worth of stuff we blew up and destroyed, but it seemed to me\r\nthere was no end of it. Fritz kept coming all the time and they hiked us\r\non to Aubercourt and then to Dormant, and each place we stopped and dug\r\ntrenches, and then they shoots us into camions and rushes us north to a\r\ntown not far out of Amiens.\r\n\r\n\"With about forty men, we marched down the road, this time as\r\nnon-combatants no longer. We stopped just east of the village of\r\nMarcelcave and dug a line of trenches across the road. We had twenty\r\nmachine guns and almost as many different kinds of ammunition as there\r\nwas different nationalities in our trench. Our position was the fifth\r\nline of defence, we was told, but the guns kept getting closer and a\r\nlot of that long range stuff was giving us hell. Near me there was a\r\nsquad of my men, one Chink, three Canadians, and we two Dublin\r\nfusileers.\r\n\r\n\"Then we begin to see our own guns, that is, British guns, beginning to\r\nblow hell out of this here village of Marcelcave right in front of us.\r\nIt made me wild to see the artillery making a mistake like that, so I\r\nsays to one of these here Dublin fusileers:\r\n\r\n\"'Whatinell's 'matter wid dose guns firing on our own men up there in\r\nthe village? If this is the fifth line, then that must be our fourth\r\nline in the village?'\r\n\r\n\"'Lad,' says the Dublin fusileer to me, 'I don't want to discourage you\r\nfor the life of me, but this only used to be the fifth line. We are in\r\nthe first line now and it's up to you and me and the Chink and the rest\r\nof us to keep the Fritzes out of Amiens. At this moment we are all\r\nthat's between.'\r\n\r\n\"We started to the machine guns and began pouring it in on 'em. The\r\nminute some of 'em would start out of the town we would wither them.\r\nHoly mother, but what a beautiful murder it was!\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know then, and don't know yet, what has become of all the rest\r\nof our officers and men, but I sorter felt like every shot I sent over\r\nwas paying 'em back for some of their dirty work. We kept handing it to\r\n'em hot. You oughter seen that Chink talking Mongolian to a machine gun,\r\nand, believe me, he sure made it understand him. I'm here to say that\r\nwhen a Chink fights, he's a fighting son-of-a-gun and don't let anybody\r\nkid you different.\r\n\r\n\"Well, our little mob held 'em off till dark and then British Tommies\r\npiled in and relieved us. We needed it because we hadn't had a bite in\r\nseventy hours and I had been lying in the mud and water for twice that\r\ntime. Just before relief comes on, two skulking figures comes over the\r\ntop. I was thinking that maybe these was Hindus or Eskimos coming to\r\njoin our little international party and we shouts out to 'em and asks\r\n'em where they hails from. Both of 'em yelled back, 'Kamerad,' and then\r\nI knew that we'd not only held the fort, but had captured two prisoners\r\neven if they was deserters.\r\n\r\n\"I marched 'em back that night to the next town and took 'em into a\r\ngrocery store, where there was a lot of Tommies helping themselves to\r\nthe first meal in days. While we were eating bread and cheese and\r\nsardines and also feeding me two prisoners, we talks to them and finds\r\nout that, as far as they are concerned, the Kaiser will never get their\r\nvote again.\r\n\r\n\"One Tommy says to one of my prisoners: 'Kaiser no good--pas bon, ain't\r\nit?' and the prisoner said, 'Yah,' and I shoved my elbow into his ribs\r\nand right quick he said, 'Nein.' Then the Tommy said: 'Hindenburg dirty\r\nrotter, nacy pa?' and the Fritz said, 'Yah. Nein,' and then looked at me\r\nand said 'Yah' again. They was not bad prisoners and I marched 'em\r\ntwenty miles that night, just the three of us--two of them in front and\r\nme in back with the rifle over me arm.\r\n\r\n\"And the joke of it was that both of them could have taken the gun and\r\nkilled me any minute for all I could have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you figure that, Corporal?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nFor reply, Jimmy Brady drew from beneath the blankets a pair of knotted\r\nhands with fingers and thumbs stiffened and bent in and obviously\r\nimpossible to use on a trigger. Brady is not in the hospital for wounds.\r\nFour days and nights in water and mud in the battle of battles had\r\ntwisted and shrunken him with rheumatism. But he is one rheumatic who\r\nhelped to save Amiens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon the heels of the German successes in Picardy, developments followed\r\nfast. Principal among these, was the materialisation of a unified\r\ncommand of all the armies of the Allies. General Ferdinand Foch was\r\nselected and placed in supreme command of every fighting man under the\r\nAllied flags.\r\n\r\nOne of the events that led up to this long delayed action, was the\r\nunprecedented action of General Pershing, when he turned over the\r\ncommand of all the American forces in France to General Foch. He did\r\nthis with the words:\r\n\r\n  \"I come to say to you that the American people would hold it a great\r\n  honour for our troops were they engaged in the present battle. I ask\r\n  it of you in my name and in that of the American people.\r\n\r\n  \"There is at this moment no other question than that of fighting.\r\n  Infantry, artillery, aviation--all that we have are yours to dispose\r\n  of as you will. Others are coming which are as numerous as will be\r\n  necessary. I have come to say to you that the American people would\r\n  be proud to be engaged in the greatest battle in history.\"\r\n\r\nThe action met with the unqualified endorsement of every officer and man\r\nin the American forces. From that minute on, the American slogan in\r\nFrance was \"Let's go,\" and every regiment began to hope that it would be\r\namong the American organisations selected to do battle with the German\r\nin Picardy. Secretary of War Baker, then in France, expressed his\r\npleasure over General Pershing's unselfish offer with the following\r\npublic statement on Mar. 30th:\r\n\r\n  \"I am delighted with the prompt and effective action of General\r\n  Pershing in placing all American troops at the disposal of the\r\n  Allies in the present situation. His action will meet with hearty\r\n  approval in the United States, where the people desire their\r\n  Expeditionary Force to be of the utmost service to the common cause.\r\n\r\n  \"I have visited practically all the American troops in France, some\r\n  of them quite recently, and had an opportunity to observe the\r\n  enthusiasm with which the officers and men receive the announcement\r\n  that they may be used in the present conflict. Regiments to which\r\n  the announcement was made, broke spontaneously into cheers.\"\r\n\r\nParticularly were there cheers when the news spread through the ranks of\r\nthe First United States division, then on duty on the line in front of\r\nToul, that it had been the first American division chosen to go into\r\nPicardy. I was fortunate enough to make arrangements to go with them.\r\n\r\nI rode out from old positions with the guns and boarded the troop train\r\nwhich took our battery by devious routes to changes of scenery,\r\ngratifying both to vision and spirit. We lived in our cars on tinned\r\nmeat and hard bread, washed down with swallows of _vin ordinaire_,\r\nhurriedly purchased at station _buvettes_. The horses rode well.\r\n\r\nOfficers and men, none of us cared for train schedule simply because\r\nnone of us knew where we were going, and little time was wasted in\r\nconjecture. Soldierly curiosity was satisfied with the knowledge that we\r\nwere on our way, and with this satisfaction, the hours passed easily.\r\nIn fact, the blackjack game in the officers' compartment had reached the\r\npoint where the battery commander had garnered almost all of the French\r\npaper money in sight, when our train passed slowly through the environs\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nOther American troop trains had preceded us, because where the railroad\r\nembankment ran close and parallel to the street of some nameless\r\nFaubourg, our appearance was met with cheers and cries from a welcoming\r\nregiment of Paris street gamins, who trotted in the street beside the\r\nslow moving troop train and shouted and threw their hats and wooden\r\nshoes in the air. Sous and fifty centime pieces and franc pieces\r\nshowered from the side doors of the horses' cars as American soldiers,\r\nwith typical disregard for the value of money, pitched coin after coin\r\nto the scrambling mob of children. At least a hundred francs must have\r\nbeen cast out upon those happy, romping waves of childish faces and\r\nup-stretched dirty hands.\r\n\r\n\"A soldier would give his shirt away,\" said a platoon commander, leaning\r\nout of the window and watching the spectacle, and surreptitiously\r\npitching a few coins himself. \"Hope we get out of this place before the\r\nmen pitch out a gun or a horse to that bunch. Happy little devils,\r\naren't they? It's great to think we are on our way up to meet their\r\ndaddies.\"\r\n\r\nUnnumbered hours more passed merrily in the troop train before we were\r\nshunted into the siding of a little town. Work of unloading was started\r\nand completed within an hour. Guns and wagons were unloaded on the quay,\r\nwhile the animals were removed from the cars on movable runways or\r\nramps. As each gun or wagon reached the ground, its drivers hitched in\r\nthe horses and moved it away. Five minutes later we rode out of the\r\nyards and down the main street of the town.\r\n\r\nBroad steel tires on the carriages of the heavies bumped and rumbled\r\nover the clean cobbles and the horses pranced spryly to get the kinks\r\nout of their legs, long fatigued from vibrations of the train. Women,\r\nold and young, lined the curbs, smiling and throwing kisses, waving\r\nhandkerchiefs and aprons and begging for souvenirs. If every request for\r\na button had been complied with, our battery would have reached the\r\nfront with a shocking shortage of safety pins.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on and with it a fine rain, as we cleared the town and\r\nhalted on a level plain between soft fields of tender new wheat, which\r\nthe horses sensed and snorted to get at. In twenty minutes, Mess\r\nSergeant Kelly, from his high altar on the rolling kitchen, announced\r\nthat the last of hot coffee had been dispensed. Somewhere up ahead in\r\nthe darkness, battery bugle notes conveyed orders to prepare to mount.\r\nWith the rattle of equipment and the application of endearing epithets,\r\nwhich horses unfortunately don't understand, we moved off at the sound\r\nof \"forward.\"\r\n\r\nOff on our left, a noiseless passenger train slid silently across the\r\nrim of the valley, blue dimmed lights in its coach windows glowing like\r\na row of wet sulphur matches. Far off in the north, flutters of white\r\nlight flushed the night sky and an occasional grumbling of the distant\r\nguns gave us our first impression of the battle of battles. Every man in\r\nour battery tingled with the thrill. This was riding frontward with the\r\nguns--this was rolling and rumbling on through the night up toward the\r\nglare and glamour of war. I was riding beside the captain at the head of\r\nthe column. He broke silence.\r\n\r\n\"It seems like a far cry from Honolulu with the moon playing through the\r\npalm trees on the beach,\" he said quizzically, \"to this place and these\r\nscenes and events to-night, but a little thing like a flip of coin\r\ndecided it for me, and I'm blessing that coin to-night.\r\n\r\n\"A year ago January, before we came into the war, I was stationed at San\r\nAntonio. Another officer friend of mine was stationed there and one day\r\nhe received orders to report for duty at Honolulu. He had a girl in San\r\nAntonio and didn't want to leave her and he knew I didn't have a girl\r\nand didn't give a damn where I went, or was sent, so long as it was with\r\nthe army. He put up the proposition of mutual exchange being permitted\r\nunder regulations.\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to take my place in San Antonio and give me his assignment in\r\nHonolulu, which I must say looked mighty good in those days to anybody\r\nwho was tired of Texas. I didn't think then we'd ever come to war and\r\nbesides it didn't make much difference to me one way or the other where\r\nI went. But instead of accepting the proposition right off the reel, I\r\ntold Jim we'd flip a coin to decide.\r\n\r\n\"If it came tails, he would go to Honolulu. If it came heads, I would go\r\nto Honolulu. He flipped. Tails won. I'm in France and poor Jim is out\r\nthere in Honolulu tending the Ukulele crop with prospects of having to\r\nstay there for some time. Poor devil, I got a letter from him last week.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, man knows no keener joy in the world than that which I\r\nhave to-night. Here I am in France at the head of two hundred and fifty\r\nmen and horses and the guns and we're rolling up front to kick a dent in\r\nhistory. The poor unfortunate that ain't in this fight has almost got\r\nlicense to shoot himself. Life knows no keener joy than this.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a long speech for our captain, but his words expressed not only\r\nthe feeling of our battery, but our whole regiment, from the humblest\r\nwagon driver up to the colonel who, by the way, has just made himself\r\nmost unpopular with the regiment by being promoted to a Brigadier\r\nGeneralship. The colonel is passing upward to a higher command and the\r\nregiment is sore on losing him. One of his humblest critics has\r\ncharacterised the event as the \"first rough trick the old man ever\r\npulled.\"\r\n\r\nMidnight passed and we were still wheeling our way through sleeping\r\nvillages, consulting maps under rays of flashlights, gathering\r\ndirections some of the time from mile posts and wall signs, and at other\r\ntimes gaining knowledge of roads and turns and hills from sleepy heads\r\nin curl wrappers that protruded from bedroom chambers and were\r\nover-generous in advice.\r\n\r\nThe animals were tired. Rain soaked the cigarettes and made them draw\r\nbadly. Above was drizzle and below was mud. There were a few grumbles,\r\nbut no man in our column would have traded places with a brother back\r\nhome even if offered a farm to boot.\r\n\r\nIt was after three in the morning when we parked the guns in front of a\r\nchâteau, brought forward some lagging combat wagons and discovered the\r\nrolling kitchen had gone astray. In another hour the animals had been\r\nunhitched but not unharnessed, fed and watered in darkness and the men,\r\nin utter weariness, prepared to lie down and sleep anywhere. At this\r\njuncture, word was passed through the sections that the battery would\r\nget ready to move immediately. Orders were to clear the village by six\r\no'clock. Neither men nor horses were rested, but we moved out on time\r\nand breakfasted on the road.\r\n\r\nThe way seemed long, the roads bad and the guns heavy. But we were\r\npassing through an Eden of beauty--green fields and rolling hills\r\ncrested by ancient châteaux. At times, the road wound down through\r\nhillside orchards, white and pink with apple blooms. Fatigue was heavy\r\non man and beast, but I heard one walking cannoneer singing, \"When It's\r\nApple Blossom-time in Normandie.\" Another rider in the column recalled\r\nthe time when his father used to give him ten cents for standing on the\r\nbottom of an upturned tin basin and reciting, \"Over the mountains\r\nwinding down, horse and foot into Frederickstown.\"\r\n\r\n\"The jar of these guns as they grind over the gravel is enough to grind\r\nthe heart out of you,\" said a sweating cannoneer who was pressing a\r\nhelping shoulder to one of the heavies as we negotiated a steep hill.\r\n\r\n\"What in hell you kicking about,\" said the man opposite. \"Suppose you\r\nwas travelling with one of them guns the Germans are using on Paris--I\r\nmean that old John J. Longdistance. You'd know what heavy guns are then.\r\nThey say that the gun's so big and takes so many horses to haul it, that\r\nthe man who drives the lead pair has never spent the night in the same\r\ntown with the fellow who rides wheel swing.\"\r\n\r\nA young reserve lieutenant with mind intensely on his work, combined for\r\nmy benefit his impressions of scenery with a lesson in artillery\r\nlocation. His characterisation of the landscape was as technical as it\r\nwas unpoetical.\r\n\r\n\"A great howitzer country,\" was the tenor of his remarks. \"Look at the\r\nbottom of that slide. Fine position for one fifty-five. Take that gully\r\nover there. That's a beaut of a place. No use talking. Great howitzer\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, a veterinarian turned over two horses to a French\r\npeasant. One was exhausted and unable to proceed, and the other suffered\r\na bad hoof, which would require weeks for healing. News that both\r\nanimals were not going to be shot was received with joy by two men who\r\nhad ridden them. I saw them patting the disabled mounts affectionately\r\non the neck and heard one of them say,\r\n\r\n\"'Salright, old timer--'salright. Frenchy here is going to take care of\r\nyou all right. Uncle Sam's paying the bill and I am coming back and get\r\nyou soon's we give Fritzie his bumps.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, a young cannoneer gave in to fatigue and ignored orders\r\nto the extent of reclining on gun trail and falling asleep. A rut in the\r\nroad made a stiff jolt, he rolled off and one ponderous wheel of the gun\r\ncarriage passed over him. One leg, one arm and two ribs were broken and\r\nhis feet crushed, was the doctor's verdict as the victim was carried\r\naway in an ambulance.\r\n\r\n\"He'll get better all right,\" said the medico, \"but he's finished his\r\nbit in the army.\"\r\n\r\nThe column halted for lunch outside of a small town and I climbed on\r\nfoot to the hilltop castle where mediæval and modern were mixed in mute\r\nmélange. A drawbridge crossed a long dry moat to cracked walls of rock\r\ncovered with ivy. For all its well preserved signs of artistic ruin, it\r\nwas occupied and well fitted within. From the topmost parapet of one\r\nrickety looking tower, a wire stretched out through the air to an old,\r\nruined mill which was surmounted by a modern wind motor, the tail of\r\nwhich incongruously advertised the words \"Ideal power,\" with the\r\ntypical conspicuity of American salesmanship.\r\n\r\nNear the base of the old mill was another jumble of moss-covered rocks,\r\nnow used as a summer house, but open on all sides. At a table in the\r\ncentre of this open structure, sat a blond haired young American soldier\r\nwith black receivers clamped to either ear. I approached and watched him\r\njotting down words on a paper pad before him. After several minutes of\r\nintent silence, he removed the harness from his head and told me that he\r\nbelonged to the wireless outfit with the artillery and this station had\r\nbeen in operation since the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Seems so peaceful here with the sun streaming down over these old\r\nwalls,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you hear out of the air?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we pick up a lot of junk,\" he replied, \"I'm waiting for the German\r\ncommuniqué now. Here's some Spanish stuff I just picked up and some more\r\njunk in French. The English stations haven't started this afternoon. A\r\nfew minutes ago I heard a German aeroplane signalling by wireless to a\r\nGerman battery and directing its fire. I could tell every time the gun\r\nwas ordered to fire and every time the aviator said the shot was short\r\nor over. It's kinder funny to sit back here in quiet and listen in the\r\nwar, isn't it?\" I agreed it was weird and it was.\r\n\r\nIn darkness again at the end of a hard day on the road, we parked the\r\nguns that night in a little village which was headquarters for our\r\nregiment and where I spent the night writing by an old oil lamp in the\r\nMayor's office. A former Chicago bellhop who spoke better Italian than\r\nEnglish and naturally should, was sleeping on a blanket roll on the\r\nfloor near me. On the walls of the room were posted numerous flag-decked\r\nproclamations, some now yellow with the time that had passed over them\r\nsince their issue back in 1914. They pertained to the mobilisation of\r\nthe men of the village, men whose names remain now only as a memory.\r\n\r\nBut in their place was the new khaki-clad Chicago bellhop snoring there\r\non the floor and several thousand more as sturdy and ready as he, all\r\nbilleted within a stone's throw of that room. They were here to finish\r\nthe fight begun by those village peasants who had marched away four\r\nyears before when the Mayor of the town posted that bulletin. These\r\nAmericans stood ready to go down to honoured graves beside them.\r\n\r\nOur division was under the French high command and was buried in the\r\nmidst of the mighty preparations then on foot. Our ranks were full, our\r\nnumbers strong, our morale high. Every officer and man in the\r\norganisation had the feeling that the eyes of dashing French\r\ncomrades-in-arms and hard fighting British brothers were on them. Our\r\ninspiration was in the belief that the attention of the Allied nations\r\nof the world and more particularly the hope and pride of our own people\r\nacross the sea, was centred upon us. With that sacred feeling, the first\r\ndivision stood resolute to meet the test.\r\n\r\nSome of the disquieting news then prevalent in the nervous civilian\r\nareas back of the lines, reached us, but its effect, as far as I could\r\nsee, was nil. Our officers and men were as unconcerned about the reports\r\nof enemy successes as though we were children in the nursery of a\r\nburning house and the neighbourhood was ringing with fire alarms. German\r\nadvances before Amiens, enemy rushes gaining gory ground in Flanders,\r\ncarried no shock to the high resolve that existed in the Allied reserves\r\nof which we were a part.\r\n\r\nOur army knew nothing but confidence. If there was other than optimism\r\nto be derived from the current events, then our army was inclined to\r\nconsider such a result as gratifying, because it could be calculated to\r\ncreate a greater measure of speed and assistance from the slowly\r\nfunctioning powers in America. The reasoning was that any possible\r\npessimism would hurry to the wheel every American shoulder that had\r\nfailed to take up its individual war burden under the wave of optimism.\r\nThe army had another reason for its optimism. Our officers knew\r\nsomething about the dark days that had preceded the first battle at the\r\nMarne. They were familiar with the gloomy outlook in 1914 that had led\r\nto the hurried removal of the French government from Paris to Bordeaux.\r\nOur men recalled how the enemy was then overrunning Belgium, how the old\r\nBritish \"Contemptibles\" were in retreat, and how the German was within\r\ntwenty miles of the French capital.\r\n\r\nIn that crisis had come the message by Foch and the brilliant stroke\r\nwith which he backed it up. What followed was the tumble and collapse of\r\nthe straddling German effort and the forced transformation in the\r\nenemy's plans from a war of six weeks to a war of four years.\r\n\r\nOur army knew the man who turned the trick at the Marne. We knew that we\r\nwere under his command, and not the slightest doubt existed but that it\r\nwas now our destiny to take part in another play of the cards which\r\nwould call and cash the German hand. Our forces in the coming\r\nengagements were staking their lives, to a man, on Foch's ace in the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nThat was the deadly earnestness of our army's confidence in Foch. The\r\ncapture of a hill top in Picardy or the loss of a village in Flanders\r\nhad no effect upon that confidence. It found reinforcement in the\r\nbelief that since March 21st, America had gained a newer and keener\r\nappreciation of her part in the war.\r\n\r\nOur army began to feel that the American people, more than three\r\nthousand miles away from the battle fronts, would have a better\r\nunderstanding of the intense meaning that had been already conveyed in\r\nGeneral Pershing's words, \"Confidence is needed but overconfidence is\r\ndangerous.\" In other words, our soldiers in the field began to feel that\r\nhome tendencies that underrated the enemy's strength and underestimated\r\nthe effort necessary to overcome him, had been corrected. The army had\r\nlong felt that such tendencies had made good material for Billy Sunday's\r\nsermons and spread-eagle speeches, but they hadn't loaded guns or placed\r\nmen in the front line.\r\n\r\nWe felt that this crisis had brought to America a better realisation of\r\nthe fact that Germany had not been beaten and that she was yet to be\r\nbeaten and that America's share in the administration of that beating\r\nwould have to be greater and more determined than had heretofore been\r\ndeemed necessary. It was the hope of the army that this realisation\r\nwould reach the people with a shock. Shocks were known to make\r\nrealisations less easy to forget. Forgetfulness from then on might have\r\nmeant Allied defeat.\r\n\r\nLagging memories found no billet in the personnel of that First\r\nDivision. Its records, registering five hundred casualties, kept in mind\r\nthe fact that the division had seen service on the line and still had\r\nscores to settle with the enemy.\r\n\r\nIts officers and men, with but few exceptions, had undergone their\r\nbaptism in German fire and had found the experience not distasteful. The\r\ndivision had esprit which made the members of every regiment and\r\nbrigade in it vie with the members of any other regiment and brigade.\r\nIf you had asked any enlisted man in the division, he would have told\r\nyou that his company, battery, regiment or brigade \"had it all over the\r\nrest of them.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the feeling that our division brought with them when we marched\r\ninto Picardy to meet the German push. That was the spirit that dominated\r\nofficers and men during the ten days that we spent in manoeuvres and\r\npreparations in that concentration area in the vicinity of the ancient\r\ntown of Chaumont-en-Vexin in the department of the Oise. It was the\r\nfeeling that made us anxious and eager to move on up to the actual\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nUNDER FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day before our departure for the front from the concentration\r\narea in Picardy, every officer in the division, and they numbered almost\r\na thousand, was summoned to the temporary divisional headquarters, where\r\nGeneral Pershing addressed to them remarks which have since become known\r\nas the commander's \"farewell to the First.\" We had passed out from his\r\ncommand and from then on our orders were to come from the commander of\r\nthe French army to which the division was to be attached.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing stood on a mound at the rear of a beautiful château of\r\nNorman architecture, the Château du Jard, located on the edge of the\r\ntown of Chaumont-en-Vexin. The officers ranged themselves in informal\r\nrows on the grass. Birds were singing somewhere above in the dense,\r\ngreen foliage, and sunlight was filtering through the leaves of the\r\ngiant trees.\r\n\r\nThe American commander spoke of the traditions which every American\r\nsoldier should remember in the coming trials. He referred to the\r\nopportunity then present for us, whose fathers established liberty in\r\nthe New World, now to assist the Old World in throwing off its yoke of\r\ntyranny. Throughout this touching farewell to the men he had trained--to\r\nhis men then leaving for scenes from which some of them would never\r\nreturn--the commander's voice never betrayed the depth of feeling behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat night we made final arrangements for the morrow's move. I\r\ntravelled with the artillery where orders were received for the\r\nreduction of all packs to the lightest possible as all men would be\r\ndismounted and the baggage wagons would be reserved for food, ammunition\r\nand officers' luggage only. Officers' packs, by the same order, had to\r\nshrink from one hundred and fifty pounds to twenty.\r\n\r\nThere were many misgivings that night as owners were forced to discard\r\ncherished belongings. Cumbersome camp paraphernalia, rubber bathtubs,\r\npneumatic mattresses, extra blankets, socks, sweaters, etc., all parted\r\ncompany from erstwhile owners. That order caused many a heart-break and\r\nthe abandonment of thousands of dollars' worth of personal equipment in\r\nour area.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that some of the village maidens were surprised at the\r\nremarkable generosity of officers and men who presented them with\r\nexpensive toilet sets. Marie at the village _estaminet_ received five of\r\nthem all fitted in neat leather rolls and inscribed with as many\r\ndifferent sets of initials. The old men of the town gloried in the\r\nsweaters, woollen socks and underwear.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance to fudge on the slim baggage order. An officer,\r\nbound by duty, weighed each officer's kit as it reached the baggage\r\nwagons and those tipping the scales at more than the prescribed twenty\r\npounds, were thrown out entirely. I happened to be watching the loading\r\nwhen it came turn for the regimental band to stow away its encased\r\ninstruments in one wagon. It must be remembered that musicians at the\r\nfront are stretcher bearers. The baggage judge lifted the case\r\ncontaining the bass horn.\r\n\r\n\"No horn in the world ever weighed that much,\" he said. \"Open it up,\"\r\nwas the terse command. The case was opened and the base horn pulled out.\r\nThe baggage officer began operations on the funnel. I watched him\r\nremove from the horn's interior two spare blankets, four pairs of socks,\r\nan extra pair of pants and a carton of cigarettes. He then inserted his\r\narm up to the shoulder in the instrument's innards and brought forth two\r\napples, a small tin of blackberry jam and an egg wrapped in an\r\nundershirt.\r\n\r\nThe man who played the \"umpah umpah\" in the band was heartbroken. The\r\nclarinet player, who had watched the operation and whose case followed\r\nfor inspection, saved the inspector trouble by removing an easily hidden\r\nchain of sausage. I noticed one musician who was observing the ruthless\r\npillage but, strangely, his countenance was the opposite of the others.\r\nHe was actually smiling. I inquired the cause of his mirth.\r\n\r\n\"When we packed up, those guys with the big hollow instruments all had\r\nthe laugh on me,\" he said. \"Now I've got it on them. I play the\r\npiccolo.\"\r\n\r\nAll the mounted men under the rank of battery commanders were dismounted\r\nin order to save the horses for any possibilities in the war of\r\nmovement. A dismounted artilleryman carrying a pack and also armed with\r\na rifle, is a most disconsolate subject to view just prior to setting\r\nout for a long tramp. In his opinion, he has been reduced too near the\r\nstatus of the despised doughboy.\r\n\r\nIt really doesn't seem like artillery unless one has a horse to ride and\r\na saddle to strap one's pack on. In the lineup before we started, I saw\r\ntwo of these gunners standing by weighted down with their cumbersome,\r\nunaccustomed packs. They were backed against a stone wall and were\r\neasing their burdens by resting the packs on the stone ledge. Another\r\none similarly burdened passed and, in a most serious tone, inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Say, would either of you fellows like to buy another blanket roll?\" The\r\nreply of two dejected gunners would bar this story from publication.\r\n\r\nWe were on the march early in the morning, but not without some initial\r\nconfusion by reason of the inevitable higher orders which always come at\r\nthe last minute to change programmes. On parallel roads through that\r\nzone of unmarred beauty which the Normans knew, our columns swung along\r\nthe dusty highroads.\r\n\r\nThere were many who held that America would not be thoroughly awake to\r\nthe full meaning of her participation in the war until the day there\r\ncame back from the battlefields a long list of casualties--a division\r\nwiped out or decimated. Many had heard the opinions expressed in France\r\nand many firmly believed that nothing short of such a shock would arouse\r\nour nation to the exertion of the power and speed necessary to save the\r\nAllied cause from defeat.\r\n\r\nOn this march, that thought recurred to some and perhaps to many who\r\nrefrained soberly from placing it in words. I knew several in the\r\norganisation who felt that we were on our way to that sacrifice. I can\r\nnot estimate in how many minds the thought became tangible, but among\r\nseveral whom I heard seriously discussing the matter, I found a perfect\r\nwillingness on their part to meet the unknown--to march on to the\r\nsacrifice with the feeling that if the loss of their life would help\r\nbring about a greater prosecution of the war by our country, then they\r\nwould not have died in vain.\r\n\r\nIf this was the underlying spirit, it had no effect whatever upon\r\noutward appearances which could hardly be better described than with\r\nCliff Raymond's lilting words: \"There are roses in their rifles just the\r\nsame.\" If this move was on to the sacrifice--if death awaited at the\r\nend of the road, then those men were marching toward it with a song.\r\n\r\nIt takes a hard march to test the morale of soldiers. When the feet are\r\nroad-sore, when the legs ache from the endless pounding of hobnails on\r\nhard macadam, when the pack straps cut and burn to the shoulder blades,\r\nand the tin hat weighs down like a crown of thorns, then keep your ear\r\nopen for a jest and if your hearing is rewarded, you will know that you\r\nmarch with men.\r\n\r\nMany times that first day, those jests came to enliven dejected spirits\r\nand put smiles on sweat-rinsed faces. I recall our battery as it\r\nnegotiated the steep hills. When the eight horses attached to the gun\r\ncarriages were struggling to pull them up the incline, a certain\r\nsubaltern with a voice slow, but damnably insistent, would sing out,\r\n\"Cannoneers, to the wheels.\" This reiterated command at every grade\r\nforced aching shoulders already weary with their own burdens to strain\r\nbehind the heavy carriages and ease the pull on the animals.\r\n\r\nOnce on a down grade, our way crossed the tracks of a narrow gauge\r\nrailroad. Not far from the crossing could be seen a dinky engine puffing\r\nand snorting furiously in terrific effort to move up the hill its\r\nattached train of loaded ammunition cars. The engine was having a hard\r\nfight when some light-hearted weary one in our column gave voice to\r\nsomething which brought up the smile.\r\n\r\n\"Cannoneers, to the wheel!\" was the shout and even the dignified\r\nsubaltern whose pet command was the butt of the exclamation, joined in\r\nthe wave of laughs that went down the line.\r\n\r\nAn imposing château of the second empire now presided over by an\r\nAmerican heiress, the wife of a French officer, was regimental\r\nheadquarters that night. Its barns and outbuildings were the cleanest\r\nin France according to individuals who had slept in so many barns that\r\nthey feel qualified to judge.\r\n\r\n\"Painfully sanitary,\" said a young lieutenant, who remarked that the\r\ntile floor might make a stable smell sweeter but it hardly offered the\r\nslumbering possibilities of a straw shakedown. While the men arranged\r\ntheir blankets in those quarters, the horses grazed and rolled in green\r\npaddocks fenced with white painted rails. The cooks got busy with the\r\nevening meal and the men off duty started exploring the two nearby\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nFor the American soldier, financial deals were always a part of these\r\nexplorations. It was seldom more than an hour after his arrival in a\r\npopulated village before the stock market and board of trade were in\r\nfull operation. These mobile establishments usually were set up in the\r\nvillage square if headquarters did not happen to be located too close.\r\nThere were plenty to play the rôles of bulls and bears; there was much\r\nbidding and shouting of quotations.\r\n\r\nThe dealings were not in bushels of wheat or shares in oils or rails.\r\nDelicacies were the bartered commodities and of these, eggs were the\r\nstrongest. The German intelligence service could have found no surer way\r\nto trace the peregrinations of American troops about France, than to\r\nfollow up the string of eggless villages they left behind them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as billets were located, those without extra duty began the egg\r\ncanvass of the town. There was success for those who made the earliest\r\nstart and struck the section with the most prolific hens. Eggs were\r\nbought at various prices before news of the American arrivals had caused\r\npeasants to set up a new scale of charges. The usual late starter and\r\nthe victim of arrangements was the officer's striker who lost valuable\r\ntime by having to take care of his officer's luggage and get the latter\r\nestablished in billets. It was then his duty to procure eggs for the\r\nofficer's mess.\r\n\r\nBy that time, all natural egg sources had been obliterated and the only\r\navailable supply was cornered by the soldiers' board of trade. The\r\ndesired breakfast food could be obtained in that place only. It was the\r\nlast and only resort of the striker, who is euphoniously known as a dog\r\nrobber. In the board of trade he would find soldiers with helmets full\r\nof eggs which could be bought at anywhere from two to three times their\r\noriginal price. It was only by the payment of such prices that the\r\nofficer was able to get anything that could possibly leave a trace of\r\nyellow on his chin. If there was a surplus, the soldiers themselves had\r\nample belt room to accommodate it.\r\n\r\nIn one village tavern, I saw one soldier eat fourteen eggs which he\r\nordered Madame to fry in succession. I can believe it because I saw it.\r\nMadame saw it also, but I feel that she did not believe her eyes. A\r\ncaptain of the Judge Advocate's office also witnessed the gastronomic\r\nfeat.\r\n\r\n\"Every one of those eggs was bought and paid for,\" he said. \"Our\r\ndepartment handles claims for all stolen or destroyed property and we\r\nhave yet to receive the first claim from this town. Of course every one\r\nknows that a hungry man will steal to eat and there are those who hold\r\nthat theft for the purpose of satisfying demands of the stomach is not\r\ntheft. But our records show that the American soldier in France is ready\r\nto, willing to, and capable of buying what he needs outside of his\r\nration allowance.\r\n\r\n\"We have some instances of stealing, but most of them are trivial.\r\nRecently, we took from the pay of one whole battalion the cost of\r\nthirty-one cheeses which were taken from a railroad restaurant counter.\r\nThe facts were that some of our troops en route were hungry and the\r\ntrain was stopping only for five minutes and the woman behind the\r\ncounter didn't have time to even take, much less change, the money\r\noffered, so the men grabbed the cheeses and ran out just in time to\r\nboard the train as it was moving off.\r\n\r\n\"There was one case, though, in which Uncle Sam didn't have the heart to\r\ncharge any one. He paid the bill himself and maybe if you could send the\r\nstory back home, the citizens who paid it would get a laugh worth the\r\nmoney. It happened during a recent cold spell when some of our troops\r\nwere coming from seaboard to the interior. They travelled in semi-opened\r\nhorse cars and it was cold, damn cold.\r\n\r\n\"One of the trains stopped in front of a small railroad station and six\r\nsoldiers with cold hands and feet jumped from the car and entered the\r\nwaiting room, in the centre of which was a large square coal stove with\r\nred hot sides. One man stood on another one's shoulders and disjointed\r\nthe stove pipe. At the same time, two others placed poles under the\r\nbottom of the stove, lifted it off the floor and walked out of the room\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\"They placed it in the horse car, stuck the pipe out of one door and\r\nwere warm for the remainder of the trip. It was the first time in the\r\nhistory of that little village that anybody had ever stolen a red hot\r\nstove. The French government, owning the railroads, made claim against\r\nus for four hundred francs for the stove and eleven francs' worth of\r\ncoal in it. Uncle Sam paid the bill and was glad to do it.\r\n\r\n\"I know of only one case to beat that one and that concerned an\r\ninfantryman who stole a hive full of honey and took the bees along with\r\nit. The medical department handled one aspect of the case and the\r\nprovost marshal the other. The bees meted out some of the punishment and\r\nwe stung his pay for the costs.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one thing, however, that men on the move found it most\r\ndifficult to steal and that was sleep. So at least it seemed the next\r\nmorning when we swung into the road at daybreak and continued our march\r\ninto the north. Much speculation went the rounds as to our destination.\r\nThe much debated question was as to whether our forces would be\r\nincorporated with Foch's reserve armies and held in readiness for a\r\npossible counter offensive, or whether we should be placed in one of the\r\nline armies and assigned to holding a position in the path of the German\r\npush. But all this conjecture resulted in nothing more than passing the\r\ntime. Our way led over byroads and side lanes which the French master of\r\ncirculation had laid down for us.\r\n\r\nBehind an active front, the French sanctified their main roads and\r\nreserved them for the use of fast motor traffic and the rushing up of\r\nsupplies or reserves in cases of necessity. Thousands of poilus too old\r\nfor combat duty did the repair work on these main arteries. All minor\r\nand slow moving traffic was side-tracked to keep the main line clear. At\r\ntimes we were forced to cross the main highroads and then we encountered\r\nthe forward and backward stream of traffic to and from the front. At one\r\nof those intersections, I sought the grass bank at the side of the road\r\nfor rest. Two interesting actors in this great drama were there before\r\nme. One was an American soldier wearing a blue brassard with the white\r\nletters M. P. He was a military policeman on duty as a road marker\r\nwhose function is to regulate traffic and prevent congestion.\r\n\r\nBeside him was seated a peculiar looking person whose knee length skirts\r\nof khaki exposed legs encased in wrap puttees. A motor coat of yellow\r\nleather and the visored cap of a British Tommy completed the costume.\r\nThe hair showing beneath the crown of the cap was rather long and\r\nstraight, but betrayed traces of having been recently close cropped. For\r\nall her masculine appearance, she was French and the young road marker\r\nwas lavishing upon her everything he had gleaned in a Freshman year of\r\nFrench in a Spokane high school.\r\n\r\nI offered my cigarette case and was surprised when the girl refrained.\r\nThat surprise increased when I saw her extract from a leather case of\r\nher own a full fledged black cigar which she proceeded to light and\r\nsmoke with gusto. When I expressed my greater surprise, she increased it\r\nby shrugging her shoulders prettily, plunging one gauntleted hand into a\r\nside pocket and producing a pipe with a pouch of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing dainty about that pipe. It had no delicate amber stem\r\nnor circlet of filigree gold. There was no meerschaum ornamentation. It\r\nwas just a good old Jimmy pipe with a full-grown cake in the black burnt\r\nbowl, and a well bitten, hard rubber mouth piece. It looked like one of\r\nthose that father used to consent to have boiled once a year, after\r\nmother had charged it with rotting the lace curtains. If war makes men\r\nof peace-time citizens, then----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST OF THE GREAT FRANCO-AMERICAN COUNTER-OFFENSIVE AT\r\nCHÂTEAU-THIERRY. THE FRENCH BABY TANKS, KNOWN AS \"CHARS D'ASSAUTS,\"\r\nENTERING THE WOOD OF VILLERS-COTTERETS, SOUTHWEST OF SOISSONS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YANKS AND POILUS VIEWING THE CITY OF CHÂTEAU-THIERRY,\r\nWHERE, IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY, THE YANKS TURNED THE TIDE OF BATTLE\r\nAGAINST THE HUNS]\r\n\r\nBut she was a girl and her name was Yvonne. The red-winged letter on her\r\ncoat lapel placed her in the automobile service and the motor ambulance\r\nstationed at the road side explained her special branch of work. She\r\ninquired the meaning of my correspondent's insignia and then\r\nexplained that she had drawn pastelles for a Paris publication before\r\nthe war, but had been transporting _blessés_ since. The French lesson\r\nproceeded and Spokane Steve and I learned from her that the longest word\r\nin the French language is spelled \"Anticonstitutionellement.\" I\r\nexpressed the hope that some day both of us would be able to pronounce\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the girl's right wrist was a silver chain bracelet with\r\nidentification disk. In response to our interested gaze, she exhibited\r\nit to us, and upon her own volition, informed us that she was a\r\ndescendant of the same family as Jeanne d'Arc. Steve heard and winked to\r\nme with a remark that they couldn't pull any stuff like that on anybody\r\nfrom Spokane, because he had never heard that that Maid of Orleans had\r\nbeen married. Yvonne must have understood the last word because she\r\nexplained forthwith that she had not claimed direct descendence from the\r\nfamous Jeanne, but from the same family. Steve looked her in the eye and\r\nsaid, \"Jay compraw.\"\r\n\r\nShe explained the meaning of the small gold and silver medals suspended\r\nfrom the bracelet. She detached two and presented them to us. One of\r\nthem bore in relief the image of a man in flowing robes carrying a child\r\non his shoulder, and the reverse depicted a tourist driving a motor\r\nthrough hilly country.\r\n\r\n\"That is St. Christophe,\" said Yvonne. \"He is the patron saint of\r\ntravellers. His medal is good luck against accidents on the road. Here\r\nis one of St. Elias. He is the new patron saint of the aviators. You\r\nremember. Didn't he go to heaven in a fiery chariot, or fly up on golden\r\nwings or something like that? Anyhow, all the aviators wear one of his\r\nmedals.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Christophe was attached to my identification disk. Steve declared\r\ninfantrymen travelled too slowly ever to have anything happen to them\r\nand that he was going to give his to a friend who drove a truck. When I\r\nfell in line with the next passing battery and moved down the road,\r\nSpokane Steve and the Yvonne of the family of Jeanne had launched into a\r\ndiscussion of prize fighting and chewing tobacco.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn billets that night, in a village not far from Beauvais, the singing\r\ncontest for the prize of fifty dollars offered by the battalion\r\ncommander Major Robert R. McCormick was resumed with intense rivalry\r\nbetween the tenors and basses of batteries A and B. A \"B\" Battery man\r\nwas croaking Annie Laurie, when an \"A\" Battery booster in the audience\r\nremarked audibly,\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, I'd rather hear first call.\" First call is the bugle note\r\nthat disturbs sleep and starts the men on the next day's work.\r\n\r\nA worried lieutenant found me in the crowd around the rolling kitchen\r\nand inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know whether there's a provost guard on that inn down the road?\"\r\nI couldn't inform him, but inquired the reason for his alarm.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a hunch that the prune juice is running knee deep to-night,\"\r\nhe replied, \"and I don't want any of my section trying to march\r\nto-morrow with swelled heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prune juice\" is not slang. It is a veritable expression and anybody who\r\nthinks that the favourite of the boarding house table cannot produce a\r\nfermented article that is _très fort_ in the way of a throat burner, is\r\ngreatly mistaken. In France the fermented juice of the prune is called\r\n\"water of life,\" but it carries a \"dead to the world\" kick. The simple\r\nprune, which the army used to call \"native son\" by reason of its\r\nCalifornia origin, now ranks with its most inebriating sisters of the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nThe flow of _eau de vie_ must have been dammed at the inn. On the road\r\nthe next day, I saw a mule driver wearing a sixteen candle power black\r\neye. When I inquired the source of the lamp shade, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"This is my first wound in the war of movement. Me and the cop had an\r\noffensive down in that town that's spelt like Sissors but you say it\r\nsome other way.\" I knew he was thinking of Gisors.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth day's march brought us into regions nearer the\r\nfront, where the movement of refugees on the roads seemed greater, where\r\nthe roll of the guns came constantly from the north, where enemy motors\r\ndroned through the air on missions of frightfulness.\r\n\r\nThere was a major in our regiment whose knowledge of French was confined\r\nto the single affirmative exclamation, \"Ah, oui.\" He worked this\r\nexpression constantly in the French conversation with a refugee woman\r\nfrom the invaded districts. She with her children occupied one room in\r\nthe cottage. When the major started to leave, two days later, the\r\nrefugee woman addressed him in a reproving tone and with tears. He could\r\nonly reply with sympathetic \"Ah, oui's,\" which seemed to make her all\r\nthe more frantic.\r\n\r\nAn interpreter straightened matters out by informing the major that the\r\nwoman wanted to know why he was leaving without getting her furniture.\r\n\r\n\"What furniture?\" replied the puzzled major.\r\n\r\n\"Why, she says,\" said the interpreter, \"that you promised her you would\r\nsend three army trucks to her house back of the German lines and bring\r\nall of her household goods to this side of the line. She says that she\r\nexplained all of it to you and you said, 'Ah, oui.'\"\r\n\r\nThe major has since abandoned the \"ah, oui\" habit.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock one morning, orders reached the battalion for\r\nreconnaissance detail; each battery to be ready to take road by\r\ndaylight. We were off at break of day in motor trucks with a reel cart\r\nof telephone wire hitched on behind. Thirty minutes later we rumbled\r\nalong roads under range of German field pieces and arrived in a village\r\ndesignated as battalion headquarters to find that we were first to reach\r\nthe sector allotted for American occupation. The name of the town was\r\nSerevilliers.\r\n\r\nOur ears did not delude us about the activity of the sector, but I found\r\nthat officers and men of the detail were inclined to accept the heavy\r\nshelling in a non-committal manner until a French interpreter attached\r\nto us remarked that artillery action in the sector was as intense as any\r\nhe had experienced at Verdun.\r\n\r\nIf the ever present crash of shells reminded us that we were opposite\r\nthe peak of the German push, there was plenty of work to engage minds\r\nthat might otherwise have paid too much attention to the dangers of\r\ntheir location. A chalk cellar with a vaulted ceiling and ventilators,\r\nunfortunately opening on the enemy side of the upper structure, was\r\nselected as the battalion command post. The men went to work immediately\r\nto remove piles of dirty billeting straw under which was found glass,\r\nchina, silverware and family portraits, all of which had been hurriedly\r\nburied by the owners of the house not two weeks before.\r\n\r\nWhile linemen planned communications, and battery officers surveyed gun\r\npositions, the battalion commander and two orienting officers went\r\nforward to the frontal zone to get the first look at our future targets\r\nand establish observation posts from which our firing could be\r\ndirected. I accompanied the small party, which was led by a French\r\nofficer familiar with the sector. It was upon his advice that we left\r\nthe roads and took cuts across fields, avoiding the path and road\r\nintersections and taking advantage of any shelter offered by the ground.\r\n\r\nVirgin fields on our way bore the enormous craters left by the explosion\r\nof poorly directed German shells of heavy calibre. Orders were to throw\r\nourselves face downward upon the ground upon the sound of each\r\napproaching missile. There is no text book logic on judging from the\r\nsound of a shell whether it has your address written on it, but it is\r\nsurprising how quick that education may be obtained by experience.\r\nSeveral hours of walking and dropping to the ground resulted in an\r\nattuning of the ears which made it possible to judge approximately\r\nwhether that oncoming, whining, unseen thing from above would land\r\ndangerously near or ineffectively far from us. The knowledge was common\r\nto all of us and all of our ears were keenly tuned for the sounds. Time\r\nafter time the collective judgment and consequent prostration of the\r\nentire party was proven well timed by the arrival of a shell\r\nuncomfortably close.\r\n\r\nWe gained a wooded hillside that bristled with busy French\r\nseventy-fives, which the German tried in vain to locate with his\r\nhowitzer fire. We mounted a forest plateau, in the centre of which a\r\nbeautiful white château still held out against the enemy's best efforts\r\nto locate it with his guns. One shell addressed in this special\r\ndirection fortunately announced its coming with such unmistakable\r\nvehemence that our party all landed in the same shell hole at once.\r\n\r\nEvery head was down when the explosion came. Branches and pieces of tree\r\ntrunk were whirled upward, and the air became populated with deadly\r\nbumble bees and humming birds, for such is the sound that the shell\r\nsplinters make. When I essayed our shell hole afterward, I couldn't\r\nfathom how five of us had managed to accommodate ourselves in it, but in\r\nthe rush of necessity, no difficulty had been found.\r\n\r\nPassing from the woods forward, one by one, over a bald field, we\r\nskirted a village that was being heavily shelled, and reached a trench\r\non the side of the hill in direct view of the German positions. The\r\nenemy partially occupied the ruined village of Cantigny not eight\r\nhundred yards away, but our glasses were unable to pick up the trace of\r\na single person in the débris. French shells, arriving endlessly in the\r\nvillage, shot geysers of dust and wreckage skyward. It was from this\r\nvillage, several days later, that our infantry patrols brought in\r\nseveral prisoners, all of whom were suffering from shell shock. But our\r\nmen in the village opposite underwent the same treatment at the hands of\r\nthe German artillery.\r\n\r\nIt was true of this sector that what corresponded to the infantry front\r\nline was a much safer place to be in than in the reserve positions, or\r\nabout the gun pits in villages or along roads in our back area. Front\r\nline activity was something of minor consideration, as both sides seemed\r\nto have greater interests at other points and, in addition to that, the\r\nmen of both sides were busy digging trenches and shelters. There were\r\nnumerous machine gun posts which swept with lead the indeterminate\r\nregion between the lines, and at night, patrols from both sides explored\r\nas far as possible the holdings of the other side.\r\n\r\nReturning to the battalion headquarters that night by a route apparently\r\nas popular to German artillery as was the one we used in the forenoon,\r\nwe found a telephone switchboard in full operation in the sub-cellar,\r\nand mess headquarters established in a clean kitchen above the ground.\r\nFood was served in the kitchen and we noticed that one door had suffered\r\nsome damage which had caused it to be boarded up and that the plaster\r\nceiling of the room was full of fresh holes and rents in a dozen places.\r\nAt every shock to the earth, a little stream of oats would come through\r\nthe holes from the attic above. These falling down on the officer's neck\r\nin the midst of a meal, would have no effect other than causing him to\r\ncall for his helmet to ward off the cereal rain.\r\n\r\nWe learned more about the sinister meaning of that broken door and the\r\nceiling holes when it became necessary later in the evening to move mess\r\nto a safer location. The kitchen was located just thirty yards back of\r\nthe town cross roads and an unhealthy percentage of German shells that\r\nmissed the intersection caused too much interruption in our cook's work.\r\n\r\nWe found that the mess room was vacant by reason of the fact that it had\r\nbecome too unpleasant for French officers, who had relinquished it the\r\nday before. We followed their suite and were not surprised when an\r\ninfantry battalion mess followed us into the kitchen and just one day\r\nlater, to the hour, followed us out of it.\r\n\r\nLying on the floor in that chalk cellar that night and listening to the\r\npound of arriving shells on nearby cross roads and battery positions, we\r\nestimated how long it would be before this little village would be\r\ncompletely levelled to the ground. Already gables were disappearing from\r\nhouses, sturdy chimneys were toppling and stone walls were showing\r\njagged gaps. One whole wall of the village school had crumbled before\r\none blast, so that now the wooden desks and benches of the pupils and\r\ntheir books and papers were exposed to view from the street. On the\r\nblackboard was a penmanship model which read:\r\n\r\n\"Let no day pass without having saved something.\"\r\n\r\nAn officer came down the dark stone steps into the cellar, kicked off\r\nhis boots and lay down on some blankets in one corner.\r\n\r\n\"I just heard some shells come in that didn't explode,\" I remarked. \"Do\r\nyou know whether they were gas or duds?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether they were gas or not,\" he said, \"but I do know\r\nthat that horse out in the yard is certainly getting ripe.\"\r\n\r\nThe defunct animal referred to occupied an uncovered grave adjoining our\r\nventilator. Sleeping in a gas mask was not the most unpleasant form of\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBEFORE CANTIGNY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange how sleep can come at the front in surroundings not unlike\r\nthe interior of a boiler factory, but it does. I heard of no man who\r\nslept in the cellars beneath the ruins of Serevilliers that night being\r\ndisturbed by the pounding of the shells and the jar of the ground, both\r\nof which were ever present through our dormant senses. Stranger still\r\nwas the fact that at midnight when the shelling almost ceased, for small\r\nintervals, almost every sleeper there present was aroused by the sudden\r\nsilence. When the shelling was resumed, sleep returned.\r\n\r\n\"When I get back on the farm outside of Chicago,\" said one officer, \"I\r\ndon't believe I will be able to sleep unless I get somebody to stand\r\nunder my window and shake a thunder sheet all night.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also remarkable how the tired human, under such conditions, can\r\nturn off the switch on an energetic imagination and resign himself\r\ncompletely to fate. In those cellars that night, every man knew that one\r\ndirect hit of a \"two ten\" German shell on his particular cellar wall,\r\nwould mean taps for everybody in the cave. Such a possibility demands\r\nconsideration in the slowest moving minds.\r\n\r\nMentalities and morale of varying calibre cogitate upon this matter at\r\nvarying lengths, but I doubt in the end if there is much difference in\r\nthe conclusion arrived at. Such reflections produce the inevitable\r\ndecision that if one particular shell is coming into your particular\r\nabode, there is nothing you can do to keep it out, so \"What the hell!\"\r\nYou might just as well go to sleep and forget it because if it gets you,\r\nyou most probably will never know anything about it anyway. I believe\r\nsuch is the philosophy of the shelled.\r\n\r\nIt must have been three o'clock in the morning when a sputtering motor\r\ncycle came to a stop in the shelter of our cellar door and a gas guard\r\nstanding there exchanged words with some one. It ended in the sound of\r\nhobnails on the stone steps as the despatch rider descended, lighting\r\nhis way with the yellow shaft from an electric pocket lamp.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" inquired the Major, awakening and rolling over on his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Just come from regimental headquarters,\" said the messenger. \"I'm\r\ncarrying orders on to the next town. Adjutant gave me this letter to\r\ndeliver to you, sir. The Adjutant's compliments, sir, and apologies for\r\nwaking you, but he said the mail just arrived and the envelope looked\r\nimportant and he thought you might like to get it right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm,\" said the Major, weighing the official looking envelope in one\r\nhand and observing both the American stamps in one corner and numerous\r\naddresses to which the missive had been forwarded. He tore off one end\r\nand extracted a sheet which he unfolded and read while the messenger\r\nwaited at his request. I was prepared to hear of a promotion order from\r\nWashington and made ready to offer congratulations. The Major smiled and\r\ntossed the paper over to me, at the same time reaching for a notebook\r\nand fountain pen.\r\n\r\n\"Hold a light for me,\" he said to the messenger as he sat on the edge of\r\nthe bed and began writing. \"This is urgent and I will make answer now.\r\nYou will mail it at regimental headquarters.\" As his pen scratched\r\nacross the writing pad, I read the letter he had just received. The\r\nstationery bore the heading of an alumni association of a well-known\r\neastern university. The contents ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Dear Sir: What are you doing for your country? What are you doing\r\n  to help win the war? While our brave boys are in France facing the\r\n  Kaiser's shell and gas, the alumni association has directed me as\r\n  secretary to call upon all the old boys of the university and invite\r\n  them to do their bit for Uncle Sam's fighting men. We ask your\r\n  subscription to a fund which we are raising to send cigarettes to\r\n  young students of the university who are now serving with the\r\n  colours and who are so nobly maintaining the traditions of our Alma\r\n  Mater. Please fill out the enclosed blank, stating your profession\r\n  and present occupation. Fraternally yours, ---- Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Major was watching me with a smile as I concluded reading.\r\n\r\n\"Here's my answer,\" he said, reading from a notebook leaf:\r\n\r\n  \"Your letter reached me to-night in a warm little village in France.\r\n  With regard to my present profession, will inform you that I am an\r\n  expert in ammunition trafficking and am at present occupied in\r\n  exporting large quantities of shells to Germany over the air route.\r\n  Please find enclosed check for fifty francs for cigarettes for\r\n  youngsters who, as you say, are so nobly upholding the sacred\r\n  traditions of our school. After all, we old boys should do something\r\n  to help along the cause. Yours to best the Kaiser. ----, Major.\r\n  ---- Field Artillery, U. S. A. On front in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that ought to hold them,\" said the Major as he folded the\r\nletter and addressed an envelope. It rather seemed to me that it would\r\nbut before I could finish the remark, the Major was back asleep in his\r\nblankets.\r\n\r\nBy daylight, I explored the town, noting the havoc wrought by the shells\r\nthat had arrived in the night. I had thought in seeing refugees moving\r\nsouthward along the roads, that there was little variety of articles\r\nrelated to human existence that they failed to carry away with them. But\r\none inspection of the abandoned abodes of the unfortunate peasants of\r\nSerevilliers was enough to convince me of the greater variety of things\r\nthat had to be left behind. Old people have saving habits and the French\r\npeasants pride themselves upon never throwing anything away.\r\n\r\nThe cottage rooms were littered with the discarded clothing of all ages,\r\ndiscarded but saved. Old shoes and dresses, ceremonial high hats and\r\nfrock coats, brought forth only for weddings or funerals, were mixed on\r\nthe floor with children's toys, prayer books and broken china. Shutters\r\nand doors hung aslant by single hinges. In the village _estaminet_ much\r\nmud had been tracked in by exploring feet and the red tiled floor was\r\nlittered with straw and pewter measuring mugs, dear to the heart of the\r\nantiquary.\r\n\r\nThe ivory balls were gone from the dust covered billiard table, but the\r\nsix American soldiers billeted in the cellar beneath had overcome this\r\ndiscrepancy. They enjoyed after dinner billiards just the same with\r\nthree large wooden balls from a croquet court in the garden. A croquet\r\nball is a romping substitute when it hits the green cushions.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we laid more wire across fields to the next town to the\r\nnorth. Men who do this job are, in my opinion, the most daring in any\r\norganisation that depends for efficiency upon uninterrupted telephone\r\ncommunication. For them, there is no shelter when a deluge of shells\r\npours upon a field across which their wire is laid. Without protection\r\nof any kind from the flying steel splinters, they must go to that spot\r\nto repair the cut wires and restore communication. During one of these\r\nshelling spells, I reached cover of the road side _abri_ and prepared to\r\nawait clearer weather.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, down the road, appeared a scudding cloud of dust. An\r\noccasional shell dropping close on either side of the road seemed to add\r\nspeed to the apparition. As it drew closer, I could see that it was a\r\nmotor cycle of the three wheeled bathtub variety. The rider on the cycle\r\nwas bending close over his handle bars and apparently giving her all\r\nthere was in her, but the bulky figure that filled to overflowing the\r\nside car, rode with his head well back.\r\n\r\nAt every irregularity in the road, the bathtub contraption bounced on\r\nits springs, bow and stern rising and falling like a small ship in a\r\nrough sea. Its nearer approach revealed that the giant torso apparent\r\nabove its rim was encased in a double breasted khaki garment which might\r\nhave marked the wearer as either the master of a four in hand or a\r\nMississippi steamboat of the antebellum type. The enormous shoulders,\r\nthus draped, were surmounted by a huge head, which by reason of its\r\nrigid, backward, star-gazing position appeared mostly as chin and double\r\nchin. The whole was topped by a huge fat cigar which sprouted upward\r\nfrom the elevated chin and at times gave forth clouds like the forward\r\nsmoke-stack on the _Robert E. Lee_.\r\n\r\nI was trying to decide in my mind whether the elevated chin posture of\r\nthe passenger was the result of pride, bravado or a boil on the Adam's\r\napple, when the scudding comet reached the shelter of the protecting\r\nbank in which was located the chiselled dog kennel that I occupied. As\r\nthe machine came to halt, the superior chin depressed itself ninety\r\ndegrees, and brought into view the smiling features of that smile-making\r\ngentleman from Paducah--Mr. Irvin S. Cobb. Machine, rider and passenger\r\nstopped for breath and I made bold to ask the intrepid humourist if he\r\nsuffered from a too keen sense of smell or a saw edge collar.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a sensitive nose, a saw edge collar or an inordinate\r\nadmiration for clouds,\" the creator of Judge Priest explained with\r\nreference to his former stiff-necked pose, \"but George here,\" waving to\r\nthe driver, \"took a sudden inspiration for fast movement. The jolt\r\nalmost took my head off and the wind kept me from getting it back into\r\nposition. George stuck his spurs into this here flying bootblack stand\r\njust about the time something landed near us that sounded like a kitchen\r\nstove half loaded with window weights and window panes. I think George\r\nmade a record for this road. I've named it Buh-Looey Boulevard.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the strafing subsided we parted and I reached the next deserted\r\ntown without incident. It was almost the vesper hour or what had been\r\nthe allotted time for that rite in those parts when I entered the yard\r\nof the village church, located in an exposed position at a cross roads\r\non the edge of the town. A sudden unmistakable whirr sounded above and I\r\nthrew myself on the ground just as the high velocity, small calibre\r\nGerman shell registered a direct hit on the side of the nave where roof\r\nand wall met.\r\n\r\nWhile steel splinters whistled through the air, an avalanche of slate\r\ntiles slid down the slanting surface of the roof, and fell in a\r\nclattering cascade on the graves in the yard below. I sought speedy\r\nshelter in the lee of a tombstone. Several other shells had struck the\r\nchurchyard and one of them had landed on the final resting place of the\r\nfamily of Roger La Porte. The massive marble slab which had sealed the\r\ntop of the sunken vault had been heaved aside and one wall was\r\nshattered, leaving open to the gaze a cross section view of eight heavy\r\ncaskets lying in an orderly row.\r\n\r\nNearby were fresh mounds of yellow earth, surmounted by now unpainted\r\nwooden crosses on which were inscribed in pencil the names of French\r\nsoldiers with dates, indicating that their last sacrifice for the\r\ntri-colour of la Patria had been made ten days prior. In the soil at the\r\nhead of each grave, an ordinary beer bottle had been planted neck\r\ndownward, and through the glass one could see the paper scroll on which\r\nthe name, rank and record of the dead man was preserved. While I\r\nwondered at this prosaic method of identification, an American soldier\r\ncame around the corner of the church, lighted a cigarette and sat down\r\non an old tombstone.\r\n\r\n\"Stick around if you want to hear something good,\" he said, \"That is if\r\nthat last shell didn't bust the organ. There's a French poilu who has\r\ncome up here every afternoon at five o'clock for the last three days and\r\nhe plays the sweetest music on the organ. It certainly is great. Reminds\r\nme of when I was an altar boy, back in St. Paul.\"\r\n\r\nWe waited and soon there came from the rickety old organ loft the\r\nsoothing tones of an organ. The ancient pipes, sweetened by the\r\nbenedictions of ages, poured forth melody to the touch of one whose\r\nplaying was simple, but of the soul. We sat silently among the graves as\r\nthe rays of the dying sun brought to life new colouring in the leaded\r\nwindows of stained glass behind which a soldier of France swayed at the\r\nivory keyboard and with heavenly harmony ignored those things of death\r\nand destruction that might arrive through the air any minute.\r\n\r\nMy companion informed me that the poilu at the organ wore a uniform of\r\nhorizon blue which marked him as casual to this village, whose French\r\ngarrisons were Moroccans with the distinctive khaki worn by all French\r\ncolonials in service. The sign of the golden crescent on their collar\r\ntabs identified them as children of Mahomet and one would have known as\r\nmuch anyway upon seeing the use to which the large crucifix standing in\r\nwhat was the market place had been put.\r\n\r\nSo as not to impede traffic through the place, it had become necessary\r\nto elevate the field telephone wires from the ground and send them\r\nacross the road overhead. The crucifix in the centre of the place had\r\npresented itself as excellent support for this wire and the sons of the\r\nprophet had utilised it with no intention of disrespect. The uplifted\r\nright knee of the figure on the cross was insulated and wired. War, the\r\nmoderniser and mocker of Christ, seemed to have devised new pain for the\r\nTeacher of Peace. The crucifixion had become the electrocution.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cross had been nailed a rudely made sign conveying to\r\nall who passed the French warning that this was an exposed crossing and\r\nshould be negotiated rapidly. Fifty yards away another board bore the\r\nred letters R. A. S. and by following the direction indicated by arrows,\r\none arrived at the cellar in which the American doctor had established a\r\nRelief Aid Station. The Medico had furnished his subterranean apartments\r\nwith furniture removed from the house above.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well bring it down here and make the boys comfortable,\" he\r\nsaid, \"as to leave it up there and let shells make kindling out of it.\r\nFunny thing about these cellars. Ones with western exposure--that is,\r\nwith doors and ventilators opening on the side away from the enemy seem\r\nscarcest. That seems to have been enough to have revived all that talk\r\nabout German architects having had something to do with the erection of\r\nthose buildings before the war. You remember at one time it was said\r\nthat a number of houses on the front had been found to have plaster\r\nwalls on the side nearest the enemy and stone walls on the other side.\r\nThere might be something to it, but I doubt it.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the street an American battalion headquarters had been\r\nestablished on the first floor and in the basement of the house, which\r\nappeared the most pretentious in the village. Telephone wires now\r\nentered the building through broken window panes, and within maps had\r\nbeen tacked to plaster walls and the furniture submitted to the hard\r\nusage demanded by war. An old man conspicuous by his civilian clothes\r\nwandered about the yard here and there, picking up some stray implement\r\nor nick-nack, hanging it up on a wall or placing it carefully aside.\r\n\r\n\"There's a tragedy,\" the battalion commander told me. \"That man is mayor\r\nof this town. He was forced to flee with the rest of the civilians. He\r\nreturned to-day to look over the ruins. This is his house we occupy. I\r\nexplained that much of it is as we found it, but that we undoubtedly\r\nhave broken some things. I could see that every broken chair and window\r\nand plate meant a heart throb to him, but he only looked up at me with\r\nhis wrinkled old face and smiled as he said, 'It is all right, Monsieur.\r\nI understand. _C'est la guerre._'\"\r\n\r\nThe old man opened one of his barn doors, revealing a floor littered\r\nwith straw and a fringe of hobnailed American boots. A night-working\r\ndetail was asleep in blankets. A sleepy voice growled out something\r\nabout closing the door again and the old man with a polite,\r\n\"_Pardonnez-moi, messieurs_,\" swung the wooden portal softly shut. His\r\nhome--his house--his barn--his straw--_c'est la guerre_.\r\n\r\nAn evening meal of \"corn willy\" served on some of the Mayor's remaining\r\nchinaware, was concluded by a final course of fresh spring onions. These\r\ncame from the Mayor's own garden just outside the door. As the cook\r\naffirmed, it was no difficulty to gather them.\r\n\r\n\"Every night Germans drop shells in the garden,\" he said. \"I don't even\r\nhave to pull 'em. Just go out in the morning and pick 'em up off the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nI spent part of the night in gun pits along the road side, bordering the\r\ntown. This particular battery of heavies was engaged on a night long\r\nprogramme of interdiction fire laid down with irregular intensity on\r\ncross roads and communication points in the enemy's back areas. Under\r\nscreens of camouflage netting, these howitzers with mottled bores\r\nsquatting frog-like on their carriages, intermittently vomited flame,\r\nred, green and orange. The detonations were ear-splitting and cannoneers\r\nrelieved the recurring shocks by clapping their hands to the sides of\r\ntheir head and balancing on the toes each time the lanyard was pulled.\r\n\r\nInfantry reserves were swinging along in the road directly in back of\r\nthe guns. They were moving up to forward positions and they sang in an\r\nundertone as they moved in open order.\r\n\r\n    \"Glor--ree--us, Glor--ree--us!\r\n    One keg of beer for the four of us.\r\n    Glory be to Mike there are no more of us,\r\n    For four of us can drink it all alone.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these marchers would come during an interval of silence to a\r\nposition on the road not ten feet from a darkened, camouflaged howitzer\r\njust as it would shatter the air with a deafening crash. The suddenness\r\nand unexpectedness of the detonation would make the marchers start and\r\njump involuntarily. Upon such occasions, the gun crews would laugh\r\nheartily and indulge in good natured raillery with the infantrymen.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, Johnny Doughboy, don't you get frightened. We were just shipping\r\na load of sauerkraut to the Kaiser,\" said one ear-hardened gunner.\r\n\"Haven't you heard the orders against running your horses? Come down to\r\na gallop and take it easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gwan, you leatherneck,\" returns an infantryman, \"You smell like a\r\nlivery stable. Better trade that pitchfork for a bayonet and come on up\r\nwhere there's some fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about the fighting, little doughboy,\" came another voice\r\nfrom the dark gun pit. \"This is a tray forte sector. If you don't get\r\nkilled the first eight days, the orders is to shoot you for loafing.\r\nYou're marching over what's called 'the road you don't come back on.'\"\r\n\r\nA train of ammunition trucks, timed to arrive at the moment when the\r\nroad was unoccupied, put in appearance as the end of the infantry column\r\npassed, and the captain in charge urged the men on to speedy unloading\r\nand fumed over delays by reason of darkness. The men received big shells\r\nin their arms and carried them to the roadside dumps where they were\r\npiled in readiness for the guns. The road was in an exposed position and\r\nthis active battery was liable to draw enemy fire at any time, so the\r\nammunition train captain was anxious to get his charges away in a hurry.\r\n\r\nHis fears were not without foundation, because in the midst of the\r\nunloading, one German missile arrived in a nearby field and sprayed the\r\nroadway with steel just as every one flattened out on the ground. Five\r\nammunition hustlers arose with minor cuts and one driver was swearing at\r\nthe shell fragment which had gone through the radiator of his truck and\r\nliberated the water contents. The unloading was completed with all\r\nspeed, and the ammunition train moved off, towing a disabled truck. With\r\nsome of the gunners who had helped in unloading, I crawled into the\r\nchalk dugout to share sleeping quarters in the straw.\r\n\r\n\"What paper do you represent?\" one man asked me as he sat in the straw,\r\nunwrapping his puttees. I told him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to know the most popular publication around this place?\" he\r\nasked, and I replied affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"It's called the _Daily Woollen Undershirt_,\" he said. \"Haven't you seen\r\neverybody sitting along the roadside reading theirs and trying to keep\r\nup with things? Believe me, it's some reading-matter, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let him kid you,\" said the section chief, \"I haven't had to read\r\nmine yet. The doctor fixed up the baths in town and yesterday he passed\r\naround those flea charms. Have you seen them?\"\r\n\r\nFor our joint inspection there was passed the string necklace with two\r\nlinen tabs soaked in aromatic oil of cedar, while the section chief\r\ngave an impromptu lecture on personal sanitation. It was concluded by a\r\nperemptory order from without for extinction of all lights. The candle\r\nstuck on the helmet top was snuffed and we lay down in darkness with the\r\nguns booming away on either side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur positions were located in a country almost as new to war as were the\r\nfields of Flanders in the fall of '14. A little over a month before it\r\nhad all been peaceful farming land, far behind the belligerent lines.\r\nUpon our arrival, its sprouting fields of late wheat and oats were\r\nuntended and bearing their first harvest of shell craters.\r\n\r\nThe abandoned villages now occupied by troops told once more the mute\r\ntales of the homeless. The villagers, old men, old women and children,\r\nhad fled, driving before them their cows and farm animals even as they\r\nthemselves had been driven back by the train of German shells. In their\r\ndeserted cottages remained the fresh traces of their departure and the\r\nruthless rupturing of home ties, generations old.\r\n\r\nOn every hand were evidences of the reborn war of semi-movement. One day\r\nI would see a battery of light guns swing into position by a roadside,\r\nsee an observing officer mount by ladder to a tree top and direct the\r\nfiring of numberless rounds into the rumbling east. By the next morning,\r\nthey would have changed position, rumbled off to other parts, leaving\r\nbeside the road only the marks of their cannon wheels and mounds of\r\nempty shell cases.\r\n\r\nBetween our infantry lines and those of the German, there was yet to\r\ngrow the complete web of woven wire entanglements that marred the\r\nlandscapes on the long established fronts. Still standing, silent\r\nsentinels over some of our front line positions were trees, church\r\nsteeples, dwellings and barns that as yet had not been levelled to the\r\nground. Dugouts had begun to show their entrances in the surface of the\r\nground and cross roads had started to sprout with rudely constructed\r\nshelters. Fat sandbags were just taking the places of potted geraniums\r\non the sills of first floor windows. War's toll was being exacted daily,\r\nbut the country had yet to pay the full price. It was going through that\r\nprocess of degeneration toward the stripped and barren but it still held\r\nmuch of its erstwhile beauty.\r\n\r\nThose days before Cantigny were marked by particularly heavy artillery\r\nfire. The ordnance duel was unrelenting and the daily exchange of shells\r\nreached an aggregate far in excess of anything that the First Division\r\nhad ever experienced before.\r\n\r\nNightly the back areas of the front were shattered with shells. The\r\nGerman was much interested in preventing us from bringing up supplies\r\nand munition. We manifested the same interest toward him. American\r\nbatteries firing at long range, harassed the road intersections behind\r\nthe enemy's line and wooded places where relief troops might have been\r\nassembled under cover of darkness. The expenditure of shells was\r\nenormous but it continued practically twenty-four hours a day. German\r\nprisoners, shaking from the nervous effects of the pounding, certified\r\nto the untiring efforts of our gunners.\r\n\r\nThe small nameless village that we occupied almost opposite the German\r\nposition in Cantigny seemed to receive particular attention from the\r\nenemy artillery. In retaliation, our guns almost levelled Cantigny and a\r\nnearby village which the enemy occupied. Every hour, under the rain of\r\ndeath, the work of digging was continued and the men doing it needed no\r\nurging from their officers. There was something sinister and emphatic\r\nabout the whine of a \"two ten German H. E.\" that inspired one with a\r\ndesire to start for the antipodes by the shortest and most direct route.\r\n\r\nThe number of arrivals by way of the air in that particular village\r\nevery day numbered high in the thousands. Under such conditions, no\r\nlife-loving human could have failed to produce the last degree of\r\nutility out of a spade. The continual dropping of shells in the ruins\r\nand the unending fountains of chalk dust and dirt left little for the\r\nimagination, but one officer told me that it reminded him of living in a\r\nroom where some one was eternally beating the carpet.\r\n\r\nThis taste of the war of semi-movement was appreciated by the American\r\nsoldier. It had in it a dash of novelty, lacking in the position warfare\r\nto which he had become accustomed in the mud and marsh of the Moselle\r\nand the Meuse. For one thing, there were better and cleaner billets than\r\nhad ever been encountered before by our men. Fresh, unthrashed oats and\r\nfragrant hay had been found in the hurriedly abandoned lofts back of the\r\nline and in the caves and cellars nearer the front.\r\n\r\nIn many places the men were sleeping on feather mattresses in\r\nold-fashioned wooden bedsteads that had been removed from jeopardy above\r\nground to comparative safety below. Whole caves were furnished, and not\r\nbadly furnished, by this salvage of furniture, much of which would have\r\nbrought fancy prices in any collection of antiques.\r\n\r\nForced to a recognition solely of intrinsic values, our men made prompt\r\nutilisation of much of the material abandoned by the civilian\r\npopulation. Home in the field is where a soldier sleeps and after all,\r\nwhy not have it as comfortable as his surroundings will afford? Those\r\ncaves and vegetable cellars, many with walls and vaulted ceilings of\r\nclean red brick or white blocks of chalk, constituted excellent shelters\r\nfrom shell splinters and even protected the men from direct hits by\r\nmissiles of small calibre.\r\n\r\nBeyond the villages, our riflemen found protection in quickly scraped\r\nholes in the ground. There were some trenches but they were not\r\ncontiguous. \"No Man's Land\" was an area of uncertain boundary. Our\r\ngunners had quarters burrowed into the chalk not far from their gun\r\npits. All communication and the bringing up of shells and food were\r\nconducted under cover of darkness. Under such conditions, we lived and\r\nwaited for the order to go forward.\r\n\r\nOur sector in that battle of the Somme was so situated that the opposing\r\nlines ran north and south. The enemy was between us and the rising sun.\r\nBehind our rear echelons was the main road between Amiens and Beauvais.\r\nAmiens, the objective of the German drive, was thirty-five kilometres\r\naway on our left, Beauvais was the same distance on our right and two\r\nhours by train from Paris.\r\n\r\nWe were eager for the fight. The graves of our dead dotted new fields in\r\nFrance. We were holding with the French on the Picardy line. We were\r\nbetween the Germans and the sea. We were before Cantigny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE RUSH OF THE RAIDERS--\"ZERO AT 2 A. M.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the First U. S. Division was executing in Picardy a small, planned\r\noperation which resulted in the capture of the German fortified\r\npositions in the town of Cantigny, other American divisions at other\r\nparts along the line were indulging in that most common of frontal\r\ndiversions--the raid.\r\n\r\nI was a party to one of these affairs on the Toul front. The 26th\r\nDivision, composed of National Guard troops from New England, made the\r\nraid. On Memorial Day, I had seen those men of the Yankee Division\r\ndecorating the graves of their dead in a little cemetery back of the\r\nline. By the dawning light of the next morning, I saw them come trooping\r\nback across No Man's Land after successfully decorating the enemy\r\npositions with German graves.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when we dismissed our motor in the ruined village of\r\nHamondville and came into first contact with the American soldiers that\r\nhad been selected for the raid. Their engineers were at work in the\r\nstreet connecting sections of long dynamite-loaded pipes which were to\r\nbe used to blast an ingress through the enemy's wire. In interested\r\ncircles about them were men who were to make the dash through the break\r\neven before the smoke cleared and the débris ceased falling. They were\r\nto be distinguished from the village garrison by the fact that the\r\nhelmets worn by the raiders were covered with burlap and some of them\r\nhad their faces blackened.\r\n\r\nIn the failing evening light, we walked on through several heaps of\r\nstone and rafters that had once been villages, and were stopped by a\r\nmilitary policeman who inquired in broad Irish brogue for our passes.\r\nThese meeting with his satisfaction, he advised us to avoid the road\r\nahead with its dangerous twist, known as \"Dead Man's Curve,\" for the\r\nreason that the enemy was at that minute placing his evening\r\ncontribution of shells in that vicinity. Acting on the policeman's\r\nsuggestion, we took a short cut across fields rich with shell holes. Old\r\ncraters were grown over with the grass and mustard flowers with which\r\nthis country abounds at this time of year. Newer punctures showed as\r\nwounds in the yellow soil and contained pools of evil-smelling water,\r\ngreen with scum.\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of a ridge, which at least screened us from direct\r\nenemy observation, we advanced toward the jagged skyline of a ruined\r\nvillage on the crest. The odour of open graves befouled the sheltered\r\nslope, indicating that enemy shells had penetrated its small protection\r\nand disturbed the final dugouts of the fallen.\r\n\r\nOnce in the village of Beaumont, we followed the winding duckboards and\r\nwere led by small signs painted on wood to the colonel's headquarters.\r\nWe descended the stone steps beneath a rickety looking ruin and entered.\r\n\r\n\"Guests for our party,\" was the Colonel's greeting. The command post had\r\na long narrow interior which was well lighted but poorly ventilated, the\r\nwalls and floor were of wood and a low beamed ceiling was supported by\r\ntimbers. \"Well, I think it will be a good show.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are sending over a little party of new boys just for practice and a\r\n'look-see' in Hunland. We have two companies in this regiment which feel\r\nthey've sorter been left out on most of the fun to date, so this affair\r\nhas been arranged for them. We put the plans together last week and\r\npushed the boys through three days of training for it back of the\r\nlines. They're fit as fiddlers to-night and it looks like there'll be no\r\ninterruption to their pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"No one man in the world, be he correspondent or soldier, could see\r\nevery angle of even so small a thing as a little raid like this,\" the\r\nColonel explained. \"What you can't see you have got to imagine. I'm\r\nsuggesting that you stay right in here for the show. That telephone on\r\nmy adjutant's desk is the web centre of all things occurring in this\r\nsector to-night and the closer you are to it, the more you can see and\r\nlearn. Lieutenant Warren will take you up the road first and give you a\r\nlook out of the observatory, so you'll know in what part of Germany our\r\ntourists are going to explore.\"\r\n\r\nDarkness had fallen when we emerged, but there were sufficient stars out\r\nto show up the outline of the gaping walls on either side of our way. We\r\npassed a number of sentries and entered a black hole in the wall of a\r\nruin. After stumbling over the uneven floor in a darkened passage for\r\nsome minutes, we entered a small room where several officers were\r\ngathered around a table on which two burning candles were stuck in\r\nbottles. Our guide, stepping to one end of the room, pulled aside a\r\nblanket curtain and passed through a narrow doorway. We followed.\r\n\r\nUp a narrow, steep, wooden stairway between two walls of solid masonry,\r\nnot over two feet apart, we passed, and arrived on a none too stable\r\nwooded runway with a guide rail on either side. Looking up through the\r\nragged remains of the wooden roof frame, now almost nude of tiles, we\r\ncould see the starry sky. Proceeding along the runway, we arrived,\r\nsomewhere in that cluster of ruins, in a darkened chamber whose\r\ninterior blackness was relieved by a lighter slit, an opening facing\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nAgainst the starry skyline, we could see the black outline of a flat\r\ntableland in the left distance which we knew to be that part of the\r\nheights of Meuse for whose commanding ridge there have been so many\r\nviolent contests between the close-locked lines in the forest of\r\nApremont. More to the centre of the picture, stood Mont Sec, detached\r\nfrom the range and pushing its summit up through the lowland mist like\r\nthe dorsal fin of a porpoise in a calm sea. On the right the lowland\r\nextended to indistinct distances, where it blended with the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn all that expanse of quiet night, there was not a single flicker of\r\nlight, and at that time not a sound to indicate that unmentionable\r\nnumbers of our men were facing one another in parallel ditches across\r\nthe silent moor.\r\n\r\n\"See that clump of trees way out there?\" said the lieutenant, directing\r\nour vision with his arm. \"Now then, hold your hand at arm's length in\r\nfront of you, straight along a line from your eyes along the left edge\r\nof your hand to that clump of trees. Now then, look right along the\r\nright edge of your hand and you will be looking at Richecourt. The Boche\r\nhold it. We go in on the right of that to-night.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked as per instructions and saw nothing. As far as we were\r\nconcerned Richecourt was a daylight view, but these owls of the lookout\r\nknew its location as well as they knew the streets of their native towns\r\nback in New England. We returned to the colonel's command post, where\r\ncots were provided, and we turned in for a few hours' sleep on the\r\npromise of being called in time.\r\n\r\nIt was 2 A. M. when we were summoned to command post for the colonel's\r\nexplanation of the night's plans. The regimental commander, smoking a\r\nlong pipe with a curved stem, sat in front of a map on which he\r\nconducted the exposition.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, placing his finger on a section of the line marking the\r\nAmerican trenches, \"is the point of departure. That's the jumping off\r\nplace. These X marks running between the lines is the enemy wire, and\r\nhere, and here, and here are where we blow it up. We reach the German\r\ntrenches at these points and clean up. Then the men follow the enemy\r\ncommunicating trenches, penetrate three hundred metres to the east edge\r\nof Richecourt, and return.\r\n\r\n\"Zero hour is 2:30. It's now 2:10. Our raiders have left their trenches\r\nalready. They are out in No Man's Land now. The engineers are with them\r\ncarrying explosives for the wire. There are stretcher bearers in the\r\nparty to bring back our wounded and also signal men right behind them\r\nwith wire and one telephone. The reports from that wire are relayed here\r\nand we will also be kept informed by runners. The whole party has thirty\r\nminutes in which to crawl forward and place explosives under the wire.\r\nThey will have things in readiness by 2:30 and then the show begins.\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes before the hour, I stepped out of the dugout and looked at\r\nthe silent sky toward the front. Not even a star shell disturbed the\r\nblue black starlight. The guns were quiet. Five minutes more and all\r\nthis was to change into an inferno of sound and light, flash and crash.\r\nThere is always that minute of uncertainty before the raiding hour when\r\nthe tensity of the situation becomes almost painful. Has the enemy\r\nhappened to become aware of the plans? Have our men been deprived of the\r\nneeded element of surprise? But for the thousands of metres behind us,\r\nwe know that in black battery pits anxious crews are standing beside\r\ntheir loaded pieces waiting to greet the tick of 2:30 with the jerk of\r\nthe lanyard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the earth trembles. Through the dugout window facing back from\r\nthe lines, I see the night sky burst livid with light. A second later\r\nand the crash reaches our ears. It is deafening. Now we hear the whine\r\nof shells as they burn the air overhead. The telephone bell rings.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is Boston,\" the Adjutant speaks into the receiver. We listen\r\nbreathlessly. Has something gone wrong at the last minute?\r\n\r\n\"Right, I have it,\" said the Adjutant, hanging up the receiver and\r\nturning to the Colonel; \"X-4 reports barrage dropped on schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said the Colonel. \"Gentlemen, here's what's happening. Our\r\nshells are this minute falling all along the German front line, in front\r\nof the part selected for the raid and on both flanks. Now then, this\r\nsection of the enemy's position is confined in a box barrage which is\r\npounding in his front and is placing a curtain of fire on his left and\r\nhis right and another in his rear. Any German within the confines of\r\nthat box trying to get out will have a damn hard time and so will any\r\nwho try to come through it to help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston talking,\" the Adjutant is making answer over the telephone. He\r\nrepeats the message. \"233, all the wire blown up, right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" says the Colonel. \"Now they are advancing and right in front of\r\nthem is another rolling barrage of shells which is creeping forward on\r\nthe German lines at the same pace our men are walking. They are walking\r\nin extended order behind it. At the same time our artillery has taken\r\ncare of the enemy's guns by this time so that no German barrage will be\r\nable to come down on our raiders. Our guns for the last three minutes\r\nhave been dumping gas and high explosives on every battery position\r\nbehind the German lines. That's called 'Neutralisation.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston talking.\" The room grows quiet again as the Adjutant takes the\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\"2:36. Y-1 reports O. K.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything fine and dandy,\" the Colonel observes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Boston talking.\" There is a pause.\r\n\r\n\"2:39. G-7 reports sending up three red rockets east of A-19. The\r\noperator thinks it's a signal for outposts to withdraw and also for\r\ncounter barrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" snaps the Colonel. \"There's a reception committee in Hades\r\nwaiting for 'em right now.\"\r\n\r\nAt 2:40 the dugout door opens and in walks Doc Comfort from the Red\r\nCross First Aid Station across the road.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly is a pretty sight, Colonel. Fritzies' front door is lit up\r\nlike a cathedral at high mass.\"\r\n\r\nAt 2:41. \"A very good beginning,\" remarks a short, fat French Major who\r\nsits beside the Colonel. He represents the French army corps.\r\n\r\n2:43. \"Boston talking,--Lieutenant Kernan reports everything quiet in\r\nhis sector.\"\r\n\r\n2:45. \"Boston talking,\" the Adjutant turns to the Colonel and repeats,\r\n\"Pittsburgh wants to know if there's much coming in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them nothing to amount to anything,\" replies the Colonel and the\r\nAdjutant repeats the message over the wire. As he finished, one German\r\nshell did land so close to the dugout that the door blew open. The\r\nofficer stepped to the opening and called out into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Gas guard. Smell anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir. Think they are only high explosives.\"\r\n\r\n2:47. \"Boston talking--enemy sent up one red, one green rocket and then\r\nthree green rockets from B-14,\" the Adjutant repeats.\r\n\r\n\"Where is that report from?\" asks the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"The operator at Jamestown, sir,\" replies the Adjutant.\r\n\r\n\"Be ready for some gas, gentlemen,\" says the Colonel. \"I think that's\r\nFritzie's order for the stink. Orderly, put down gas covers on the doors\r\nand windows.\"\r\n\r\nI watched the man unroll the chemically dampened blankets over the doors\r\nand windows.\r\n\r\n2:49. \"Boston talking--23 calls for barrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and Major turn immediately to the wall map, placing a finger\r\non 23 position.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" says the Colonel. \"Counter attack, hey? Well, the barrage will\r\ntake care of them, but get me Watson on the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Connect me with Nantucket,\" the Adjutant asks the operator. \"Hello,\r\nWatson, just a minute,\" turning to Colonel, \"here's Watson, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Watson,\" the Colonel says, taking the receiver. \"This is Yellow\r\nJacket. Watch out for counter attack against 23. Place your men in\r\nreadiness and be prepared to support Michel on your right. That's all,\"\r\nreturning 'phone to the Adjutant, \"Get me Mr. Lake.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Adjutant made the connection, the Colonel explained quickly\r\nthe planned flanking movement on the map. \"If they come over there,\" he\r\nsaid to the French Major, \"not a God-damn one of them will ever get back\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nThe French Major made a note in his report book.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Lake,\" the Colonel says, taking the 'phone. \"This is Yellow\r\nJacket. Keep your runners in close touch with Michel and Watson. Call me\r\nif anything happens. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n3:00. \"Boston talking--G-2 reports all O.K. Still waiting for the\r\nmessage from Worth.\"\r\n\r\n3:02. \"Storming party reports unhindered progress. No enemy encountered\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first message back from the raiders. It had been sent over\r\nthe wire and the instruments they carried with them and then relayed to\r\nthe Colonel's command post.\r\n\r\n\"_Magnifique_,\" says the French Major.\r\n\r\n3:04. \"Boston talking. X-10 reports gas in Bois des Seicheprey.\"\r\n\r\n3:05. \"Boston talking. Hello, yes, nothing coming in here to amount to\r\nanything. Just had a gas warning but none arrived yet.\"\r\n\r\n3:07. \"Boston talking,----Yes, all right\" (turning to Colonel),\r\n\"operator just received message from storming party 'so far so good.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad for thirty-seven minutes after opening of the operation,\"\r\nremarks the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"What is 'so far so good'?\" inquires the French Major, whose knowledge\r\nof English did not extend to idioms. Some one explained.\r\n\r\n3:09. \"Boston talking--Watson reports all quiet around 23 now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess that barrage changed their minds,\" remarks the Colonel.\r\n\r\nWith gas mask at alert, I walked out for a breath of fresh air. The\r\natmosphere in a crowded dugout is stifling. From guns still roaring in\r\nthe rear and from in front came the trampling sound of shells arriving\r\non German positions. The first hints of dawn were in the sky. I\r\nreturned in time to note the hour and hear:\r\n\r\n3:18. \"Boston talking--O-P reports enemy dropping line of shells from\r\nB-4 to B-8.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trying to get the boys coming back, hey?\" remarks the Colonel. \"A fat\r\nchance. They're not coming back that way.\"\r\n\r\n3:21. \"Boston talking--23 reports that the barrage called for in their\r\nsector was because the enemy had advanced within two hundred yards of\r\nhis first position. Evidently they wanted to start something, but the\r\nbarrage nipped them and they fell back fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect,\" says the French Major.\r\n\r\n3:25. \"Boston talking--two green and two red rockets were sent up by the\r\nenemy from behind Richecourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell with 'em, now,\" the Colonel remarks.\r\n\r\n3:28. \"Boston talking--all O. K. in Z-2. Still waiting to hear from\r\nMichel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather wish they had developed their counter attack,\" says the\r\nColonel. \"I have a reserve that would certainly give them an awful\r\nwallop.\"\r\n\r\n3:30. \"Boston talking--more gas in Bois des Seicheprey.\"\r\n\r\n3:33. \"Boston talking--white stars reported from Richecourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must be on their way back by this time,\" says the Colonel, looking\r\nat his watch.\r\n\r\n3:37. \"Boston talking,--enemy now shelling on the north edge of the\r\ntown. A little gas.\"\r\n\r\n3:40. \"Boston talking--X-1 reports some enemy long range retaliation on\r\nour right.\r\n\r\n\"They'd better come back the other way,\" says the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"That was the intention, sir,\" the lieutenant reported from across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n3:42. \"Boston talking--signalman with the party reports everything O.\r\nK.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know yet whether they have had any losses or got any\r\nprisoners,\" the Colonel remarks. \"But the mechanism seems to have\r\nfunctioned just as well as it did in the last raid. We didn't get a\r\nprisoner that time, but I sorter feel that the boys will bring back a\r\ncouple with them to-night.\"\r\n\r\n3:49. \"Boston talking--G-9 reports some of the raiding party has\r\nreturned and passed that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Came back pretty quick, don't you think so, Major?\" said the Colonel\r\nwith some pride. \"Must have returned over the top.\"\r\n\r\nIt is 3:55 when we hear fast footsteps on the stone stairs leading down\r\nto the dugout entrance. There is a sharp rap on the door followed by the\r\nColonel's command, \"Come in.\"\r\n\r\nA medium height private of stocky build, with shoulders heaving from\r\nlaboured breathing and face wet with sweat, enters. He removes his\r\nhelmet, revealing disordered blonde hair. He faces the Colonel and\r\nsalutes.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, Sergeant Ransom reports with message from Liaison officer. All\r\ngroups reached the objectives. No enemy encountered on the right, but a\r\nparty on the left is believed to be returning with prisoners. We blew up\r\ntheir dugouts and left their front line in flames.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work, boy,\" says the Colonel, rising and shaking the runner's\r\nhand. \"You got here damn quick. Did you come by the Lincoln trench?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I came over the top from the battalion post. Would have been\r\nhere quicker, but two of us had to carry back one boy to that point\r\nbefore I could get relieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,--dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\" asks the young lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Private Kater, sir, my squad mate.\"\r\n\r\nAs the sergeant raised his hand in parting salute, all of us saw\r\nsuspended from his right wrist a most formidable weapon, apparently of\r\nhis own construction. It was a pick handle with a heavy iron knob on one\r\nend and the same end cushioned with a mass of barbed wire rolled up like\r\na ball of yarn. He smiled as he noticed our gaze.\r\n\r\n\"It's the persuader, sir,\" he said. \"We all carried them.\"\r\n\r\nHe had hardly quitted the door when another heavily breathing figure\r\nwith shirt half torn off by barbed wire appeared.\r\n\r\n\"K Company got there, sir; beg pardon, sir. I mean sir, Sergeant Wiltur\r\nreports, sir, with message from Liaison officer. All groups reached the\r\nobjectives. They left their dugouts blazing and brought back one machine\r\ngun and three prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Sergeant,\" said the Colonel. \"Orderly, get some coffee for\r\nthese runners.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see the doctor first, sir,\" said the runner with the torn\r\nshirt. \"Got my hand and arm cut in the wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Colonel, turning to the rest of the party, \"I knew\r\nmy boys would bring back bacon.\"\r\n\r\nMore footsteps on the entrance stairway and two men entered carrying\r\nsomething between them. Sweat had streaked through the charcoal coating\r\non their faces leaving striped zebra-like countenances.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Burlon's compliments, sir,\" said the first man. \"Here's one\r\nof their machine guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who got it?\" inquired the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Me and him, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We just rolled 'em off it and took it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rolled who off of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two Germans, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were they doing all that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, they weren't doing anything. They were dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well, then,\" said the Colonel. \"How did you happen to find the\r\nmachine gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"We knew where it was before we went over, sir,\" said the man simply.\r\n\"We were assigned to get it and bring it back. We expected we'd have to\r\nfight for it, but I guess our barrage laid out the crew. Anyhow we\r\nrushed to the position and found them dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the Colonel, \"return to your platoon. Leave the gun\r\nhere. It will be returned to you later and will be your property.\"\r\n\r\nI went out with the machine gun captors and walked with them to the\r\nroad. There was the hum of motors high overhead and we knew that\r\nAmerican planes were above, going forward to observe and photograph\r\nGerman positions before the effects of our bombardments could be\r\nrepaired. A line of flame and smoke pouring up from the enemy's front\r\nline showed where their dugouts and shelters were still burning.\r\n\r\nDaylight was pouring down on a ruined village street, up which marched\r\nthe returning raiders without thought of order. They were a happy,\r\ngleeful party, with helmets tipped back from their young faces wet and\r\ndirty, with rifles swung over their shoulders and the persuaders\r\ndangling from their wrists. Most of them were up to their knees and\r\ntheir wrap puttees were mostly in tatters from the contact with the\r\nentanglements through which they had penetrated.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, I saw the cause for some of the jocularity. It was a\r\nchubby, little, boyish figure, who sat perched up on the right shoulder\r\nof a tall, husky Irish sergeant. The figure steadied itself by grasping\r\nthe sergeant's helmet with his left hand. The sergeant steadied him by\r\nholding one right arm around his legs.\r\n\r\nBut there was no smile on the face of the thus transformed object. His\r\nchubby countenance was one of easily understood concern. He was not a\r\nday over sixteen years and this was quite some experience for him. He\r\nwas one of the German prisoners and these happy youngsters from across\r\nthe seas were bringing him in almost with as much importance as though\r\nhe had been a football hero. He was unhurt and it was unnecessary to\r\ncarry him, but this tribute was voluntarily added, not only as an\r\nindication of extreme interest, but to reassure the juvenile captive of\r\nthe kindly intentions of his captors.\r\n\r\n\"Jiggers, here's the Colonel's dugout,\" one voice shouted. \"Put him down\r\nto walk, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe big sergeant acted on the suggestion and the little Fritz was\r\nlowered to the ground. He immediately caught step with the big sergeant\r\nand took up the latter's long stride with his short legs and feet\r\nencased in clumsy German boots. His soiled uniform had been the German\r\nfield grey green. His helmet was gone but he wore well back on his head\r\nthe flat round cloth cap. With his fat cheeks he looked like a typical\r\nbaker's boy, and one almost expected to see him carrying a tray of rolls\r\non his head.\r\n\r\n\"For the luva Mike, Tim,\" shouted an ambulance man, \"do you call that a\r\nprisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure he does look like a half portion,\" replied Sergeant Tim with a\r\nsmile. \"We got two hundred francs for a whole one. I don't know what we\r\ncan cash this one in for.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ought to be worth more,\" some one said; \"that barrage cost a million\r\ndollars. He's the million dollar baby of the raid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant, I'm not kidding,\" came one serious voice. \"Why turn him in as\r\na prisoner? I like the kid's looks. Why can't we keep him for the\r\ncompany mascot?\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion ended when the Sergeant and his small charge disappeared\r\nin the Colonel's quarters for the inevitable questioning that all\r\nprisoners must go through. Several wounded were lying on the stretchers\r\nin front of the first aid dugout waiting for returning ambulances and\r\npassing the time meanwhile by smoking cigarettes and explaining how\r\nclose each of them had been to the shell that exploded and \"got 'em.\"\r\n\r\nBut little of the talk was devoted to themselves. They were all praise\r\nfor the little chaplain from New England who, without arms, went over\r\nthe top with \"his boys\" and came back with them. It was their opinion\r\nthat their regiment had some sky pilot. And it was mine, also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nON LEAVE IN PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So this--is Paris,\"--this observation spoken in mock seriousness, in a\r\nGeorge Cohan nasal drawl and accompanied by a stiff and stagy wave of\r\nthe arm, was the customary facetious pass-word with which American\r\nsoldiers on leave or on mission announced their presence in the capital\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nParis, the beautiful--Paris, the gay--Paris, the historical--Paris, the\r\nartistic--Paris, the only Paris, opened her arms to the American soldier\r\nand proceeded toward his enlightenment and entertainment on the sole\r\npolicy that nothing was too good for him.\r\n\r\nI saw the first American soldiers under arms reach Paris. It was early\r\nin the morning of July 3rd, 1917, when this first American troop train\r\npulled into the Gare d'Austerlitz. It was early in the morning, yet\r\nParis was there to give them a welcome. The streets outside the station\r\nwere jammed with crowds. They had seen Pershing; they had seen our staff\r\nofficers and headquarters details, but now they wanted to see the type\r\nof our actual fighting men--they wanted to see the American poilus--the\r\nmen who were to carry the Stars and Stripes over the top.\r\n\r\nThe men left the cars and lined up in the station yard. It had been a\r\nlong, fifteen hour night ride and the cramped quarters of the troop\r\ntrain had permitted but little sleep. There was no opportunity for them\r\nto breakfast or wash before they were put on exhibition. Naturally, they\r\nwere somewhat nervous.\r\n\r\nThe standing line was ordered to produce its mess cups and hold them\r\nforward. Down the line came a bevy of pretty French girls, wearing the\r\nuniform of Red Cross nurses. They carried canisters of black coffee and\r\nbaskets of cigarettes. They ladled out steaming cupfuls of the black\r\nliquid to the men. The incident gave our men their first surprise.\r\n\r\nRum or alcohol has never been a part of the United States army ration.\r\nIn the memory of the oldest old-timers in the ranks of our old regular\r\narmy, \"joy water\" had never been issued. On the other hand, its use had\r\nalways been strictly forbidden in the company messes. Our men never\r\nexpected it. Thus it was that, with no other idea occurring to them,\r\nthey extended their mess cups to be filled with what they thought was\r\nsimply strong hot coffee. Not one of them had the slightest suspicion\r\nthat the French cooks who had prepared that coffee for their new\r\nAmerican brothers in arms, had put a stick in it--had added just that\r\nportion of cognac which they had considered necessary to open a man's\r\neyes and make him pick up his heels after a long night in a troop train.\r\n\r\nI watched one old-timer in the ranks as he lifted the tin cup to his\r\nlips and took the initial gulp. Then he lowered the cup. Across his face\r\nthere dawned first an expression of curious suspicion, then a look of\r\nsatisfied recognition, and then a smile of pleased surprise, which he\r\nfollowed with an audible smacking of the lips. He finished the cup and\r\nallowed quite casually that he could stand another.\r\n\r\n\"So this is Paris,\"--well, it wasn't half bad to start with. With that\r\n\"coffee\" under their belts, the men responded snappily to the march\r\norder, and in column of four, they swung into line and moved out of the\r\nstation yard, at the heels of their own band, which played a stirring\r\nmarching air.\r\n\r\nParis claimed them for her own. All that the war had left of Paris' gay\r\nlife, all the lights that still burned, all the music that still played,\r\nall the pretty smiles that had never been reduced in their quality or\r\nquantity, all that Paris had to make one care-free and glad to be\r\nalive--all belonged that day to that pioneer band of American\r\ninfantrymen.\r\n\r\nThe women kissed them on the street. Grey-headed men removed their hats\r\nto them and shook their hands and street boys followed in groups at\r\ntheir heels making the air ring with shrill \"Vive's.\" There were not\r\nmany of them, only three companies. The men looked trim and clean-cut.\r\nThey were tall and husky-looking and the snap with which they walked was\r\ngood to the eyes of old Paris that loves verve.\r\n\r\nWith a thirty-two-inch stride that made their following admirers stretch\r\ntheir legs, the boys in khaki marched from the Austerlitz station to the\r\nNeuilly barracks over a mile away, where they went into quarters. Paris\r\nwas in gala attire. In preparation for the celebration of the following\r\nday, the shop windows and building fronts were decked with American\r\nflags.\r\n\r\nAlong the line of march, traffic piled up at the street intersections\r\nand the gendarmes were unable to prevent the crowds from overflowing the\r\nsidewalks and pressing out into the streets where they could smile their\r\ngreetings and throw flowers at closer range. A sergeant flanking a\r\ncolumn stopped involuntarily when a woman on the curb reached out,\r\ngrabbed his free hand, and kissed it. A snicker ran through the platoon\r\nas the sergeant, with face red beneath the tan, withdrew his hand and\r\nrecaught his step. He gave the snickering squads a stern, \"Eyes front!\"\r\nand tried to look at ease.\r\n\r\nHow the bands played that day! How the crowds cheered! How the flags and\r\nhandkerchiefs and hats waved in the air, and how thousands of throats\r\nvolleyed the \"Vive's!\" This was the reception of our first fighting men.\r\nBut on the following day they received even a greater demonstration,\r\nwhen they marched through the streets of the city on parade, and\r\nparticipated in the first Parisian celebration of American Independence\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nParisians said that never before had Paris shown so many flags, not even\r\nduring the days three years before, when the sons of France had marched\r\naway to keep the Germans out of Paris. It seemed that the customary\r\nclusters of Allied flags had been almost entirely replaced for the day\r\nby groups composed solely of the French tri-colour and the Stars and\r\nStripes. Taxis and fiacres flew flags and bunting from all attachable\r\nplaces. Flag venders did wholesale business on the crowded streets.\r\nStreet singers sang patriotic parodies, eulogising Uncle Sam and his\r\nnephews, and garnered harvests of sous for their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe three companies of our regulars marched with a regiment of French\r\ncolonials, all veterans of the war and many of them incapacitated for\r\nfront service through wounds and age. French soldiers on leave from the\r\ntrenches and still bearing the mud stains of the battle front life,\r\ncheered from the sidewalks. Bevies of middinettes waved their aprons\r\nfrom the windows of millinery shops. Some of them shouted, \"Vive les\r\nTeddies!\" America--the great, good America--the sister republic from\r\nacross the seas was spoken of and shouted all day long. Paris\r\ncapitulated unconditionally to three companies of American infantry.\r\n\r\nFrom that day on, every American soldier visiting Paris has been made to\r\nfeel himself at home. And the unrestricted hospitality did not seem to\r\nbe the result of an initial wave of enthusiasm. It was continuous. For\r\nmonths afterward, any one wearing an American uniform along the\r\nboulevards could hear behind him dulcet whispers that carried the words\r\n_très gentil_.\r\n\r\nAt first, our enlisted men on leave in Paris or detailed for work in the\r\ncity, were quartered in the old Pipincerie Barracks, where other\r\nsoldiers from all of the Allied armies in the world were quartered. Our\r\nmen mingled with British Tommies, swarthy Italians and Portuguese, tall\r\nblond Russians, French poilus, Canadians, Australians and New\r\nZealanders. At considerable expense to these comrades in arms, our men\r\ninstructed them in the all-American art of plain and fancy dice rolling.\r\n\r\nLater when our numbers in Paris increased, other arrangements for\r\nhousing were made. The American policing of Paris, under the direction\r\nof the Expeditionary Provost General, Brigadier General Hillaire, was\r\nturned over to the Marines. Whether it was that our men conducted\r\nthemselves in Paris with the orderliness of a guest at the home of his\r\nhost, or whether it was that the Marines with their remarkable\r\ndiscipline suppressed from all view any too hearty outbursts of American\r\nexuberance, it must be said that the appearance and the bearing of\r\nAmerican soldiers in Paris were always above reproach.\r\n\r\nI have never heard of one being seen intoxicated in Paris, in spite of\r\nthe fact that more opportunities presented themselves for drinking than\r\nhad ever before been presented to an American army. The privilege of\r\nsitting at a table in front of a sidewalk café on a busy boulevard and\r\ndrinking a small glass of beer unmolested, was one that our men did not\r\ntake advantage of. It was against the law to serve any of the stronger\r\nliqueurs to men in uniform, but beer and light wines were obtainable all\r\nthe time. All cafés closed at 9:30. In spite of the ever present\r\nopportunity to obtain beverages of the above character, there was many\r\nand many an American soldier who tramped the boulevards and canvassed\r\nthe cafés, drug stores and delicatessen shops in search of a\r\nmuch-desired inexistent, ice cream soda.\r\n\r\nMany of our men spent their days most seriously and most studiously,\r\nlearning the mysteries of transportation on the busses and the Paris\r\nunderground system, while they pored over their guide books and digested\r\npages of information concerning the points of interest that Paris had to\r\noffer. Holidays found them shuffling through the tiled corridors of the\r\nInvalides or looking down into the deep crypt at the granite tomb of the\r\ngreat Napoleon. In the galleries of the Louvre, the gardens of the\r\nTuilleries, or at the Luxembourg, the American uniform was ever present.\r\nAt least one day out of every ten day leave was spent in the palace and\r\nthe grounds at Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe theatres of Paris offered a continual change of amusement. One of\r\nthe most popular among these was the Folies Bergères. Some of our men\r\ndidn't realise until after they entered the place that it was a French\r\ntheatre. Due to the French pronunciation of the name, some of the\r\nAmerican soldiers got the idea that it was a saloon run by an Irishman\r\nby the name of Foley. \"Bergère\" to some was unpronounceable, so the\r\nFolies Bergères was most popularly known in our ranks as \"Foley's\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nAnother popular amusement place was the Casino de Paris, where an echo\r\nfrom America was supplied by an American negro jazz band, which\r\ndispensed its questionable music in the _promenoir_ during the\r\nintermission. There were five negroes in the orchestra and each one of\r\nthem seemed to have an ardent dislike for the remaining four.\r\nIndividually they manifested their mutual contempt by turning their\r\nbacks on one another while they played. Strange as it may seem, a most\r\nfascinating type of harmony resulted, producing much swaying of\r\nshoulders, nodding of heads and snapping of fingers among the American\r\nsoldiers in the crowd. French men and women, with their old world\r\nmusical taste, would consider the musical gymnastics of the demented\r\ndrummer in the orchestra, then survey the swaying Americans and come to\r\nthe conclusion that the world had gone plumb to hell.\r\n\r\nAll types of American soldiers made Paris their mecca as soon as the\r\ndesired permissions had been granted. One day I sat opposite a\r\nremarkable type whom I found dining in a small restaurant. I noticed the\r\nabsence of either beer or wine with his meal, and he frankly explained\r\nthat he had never tasted either in his life. He thanked me, but refused\r\nto accept a cigarette I offered, saying without aside that he had yet\r\nhis first one to smoke. When I heard him tell Madame that he did not\r\ncare for coffee, I asked him why, and he told me that his mother had\r\nalways told him it was injurious and he had never tasted it.\r\n\r\nI became more interested in this ideal, young American soldier and\r\nquestioned him about his life. I found that he and his father had worked\r\nin the copper mines in Michigan. They were both strong advocates of\r\nunion labour and had participated vigorously in the bloody Michigan\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\n\"Father and I fought that strike clear through,\" he said. \"Our union\r\ndemands were just. Here in this war I am fighting just the same way as\r\nwe fought against the mine operators in Michigan. I figure it out that\r\nGermany represents low pay, long hours and miserable working conditions\r\nfor the world. I think the Kaiser is the world's greatest scab. I am\r\nover here to help get him.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day in the Chatham Hotel, in Paris, I was dining with an American\r\nBrigadier General, when an American soldier of the ranks approached the\r\ntable. At a respectful distance of five feet, the soldier halted,\r\nclicked his heels and saluted the General. He said, \"Sir, the orderly\r\ndesires permission to take the General's car to headquarters and deliver\r\nthe packages.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Smith,\" replied the General, looking at his watch. \"Find out\r\nif my other uniform is back yet and then get back here yourself with the\r\ncar in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied the man as he saluted, executed a snappy right\r\nabout face and strode out of the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\"Strange thing about that chauffeur of mine,\" said the General to me. \"I\r\nhad a lot of extra work yesterday on his account. I had to make out his\r\nincome tax returns. He and his dad own almost all the oil in Oklahoma.\r\nWhen he paid his income tax, Uncle Sam got a little over a hundred\r\nthousand dollars. He went in the army in the ranks. He is only an\r\nenlisted private now, but he's a good one.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalking out of the Gare du Nord one day, I saw a man in an American\r\nuniform and a French Gendarme vainly trying to talk with each other. The\r\nFrenchman was waving his arms and pointing in various directions and the\r\nAmerican appeared to be trying to ask questions. With the purpose of\r\noffering my limited knowledge of French to straighten out the\r\ndifficulty, I approached the pair and asked the American soldier what he\r\nwanted. He told me but I don't know what it was to this day. He spoke\r\nonly Polish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not alone amidst the gaiety of Paris that our soldiers spread the\r\nfame of America. In the peaceful countrysides far behind the flaming\r\nfronts, the Yankee fighting men won their way into the hearts of the\r\nFrench people. Let me tell you the story of a Christmas celebration in a\r\nlittle French village in the Vosges.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn there were sounds of movement in the murky half-light of the\r\nvillage street. A long line of soldiers wound their way past flaming\r\nstoves of the mess shacks, where the steaming coffee took the chill out\r\nof the cold morning stomachs.\r\n\r\nLater the sun broke bright and clear. It glistened on the snow-clad\r\nfurrows of the rolling hills, in which, for centuries, the village of\r\nSaint Thiébault has drowsed more or less happily beside its ancient\r\ncanal and in the shadow of the steeple of the church of the good Saint\r\nThiébault.\r\n\r\nNow a thousand men or more, brown-clad and metal-helmeted, know the huts\r\nand stables of Saint Thiébault as their billets, and the seventy little\r\nboys and girls of the parish know those same thousand men as their new\r\nbig brothers--_les bons Américains_.\r\n\r\nThe real daddies and big brothers and uncles of those seventy youngsters\r\nhave been away from Saint Thiébault for a long time now--yes, this is\r\nthe fourth Christmas that the urgent business in northern France has\r\nkept them from home. They may never return but that is unknown to the\r\nseventy young hopefuls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARINES MARCHING DOWN THE AVENUE PRESIDENT WILSON ON THE\r\nFOURTH OF JULY IN PARIS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE CROSSING MARNE RIVER IN CHÂTEAU-THIERRY DESTROYED\r\nBY GERMANS IN THEIR RETREAT FROM TOWN]\r\n\r\nThere was great activity in the colonel's quarters during the morning,\r\nand it is said that a sleuthing seventy were intent on unveiling the\r\nmystery of these unusual American preparations. They stooped to get a peep\r\nthrough the windows of the room, and Private Larson, walking his post in\r\nfront of the sacred precincts, had to shoo them away frequently with\r\nthreatening gestures and Swedish-American-French commands, such as \"Allay\r\nveet--Allay veet t'ell outer here.\"\r\n\r\nAn energetic bawling from the headquarters cook shack indicated that one\r\njuvenile investigator had come to grief. Howls emanated from little Paul\r\nLaurent, who could be seen stumbling across the road, one blue, cold\r\nhand poking the tears out of his eyes and the other holding the seat of\r\nhis breeches.\r\n\r\nTony Moreno, the company cook, stood in front of the cook shack shaking\r\na soup ladle after the departing Paul and shouting imprecations in\r\nItalian-American.\r\n\r\n\"Tam leetle fool!\" shouted Tony as he returned to the low camp stove and\r\nremoved a hot pan, the surface of whose bubbling contents bore an\r\nunmistakable imprint. \"Deese keeds make me seek. I catcha heem wit de\r\nfinger in de sugar barrel. I shout at heem. He jumpa back. He fall over\r\nde stove and sita down in de pan of beans. He spoila de mess. He burn\r\nheese pants. Tam good!\"\r\n\r\nAnd over there in front of the regimental wagon train picket line, a\r\ngesticulating trio is engaged in a three cornered Christmas discussion.\r\nOne is M. Lecompte, who is the uniformed French interpreter on the\r\nColonel's staff, and he is talking to \"Big\" Moriarity, the teamster, the\r\ntallest man in the regiment. The third party to the triangle is little\r\nPierre Lafite, who clings to M. Lecompte's hand and looks up in awe at\r\nthe huge Irish soldier.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to borrow one of these,\" M. Lecompte says, pointing to the\r\nenormous hip boots which Moriarity is wearing.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to borrow one of me boots?\" repeated the Irishman. \"And for\r\nthe love of heavin, what would he be after doin' wid it? Sure and the\r\ntop of it is higher than the head of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is for this purpose,\" explains the interpreter. \"The French children\r\ndo not hang up their stockings for Christmas. Instead they place their\r\nwooden shoes on the hearth and the presents and sweets are put in them.\r\nYou see, Pierre desires to receive a lot of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Mother!\" replies Moriarity, kicking off one boot and hopping on\r\none foot toward the stables. \"Take it, you scamp, and I hopes you get it\r\nfilled wid dimonds and gold dust. But mind ye, if you get it too near\r\nthe fire and burn the rubber I'll eat you like you was a oyster.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish giant emphasised his threat with a grimace of red-whiskered\r\nferocity and concluded by loudly smacking his lips. Then little Pierre\r\nwas off to his mother's cottage, dragging the seven league boot after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith the afternoon meal, the last of the packages had been tied with red\r\ncords and labelled, and the interior of the Colonel's quarters looked\r\nlike an express office in the rush season. The packages represented the\r\npurchases made with 1,300 francs which the men of the battalion had\r\ncontributed for the purpose of having Christmas come to Saint Thiébault\r\nin good style.\r\n\r\nM. Lecompte has finished sewing the red and white covering which is to\r\nbe worn by \"Hindenburg,\" the most docile mule in the wagon train, upon\r\nwhom has fallen the honour of drawing the present loaded sleigh of the\r\nChristmas saint.\r\n\r\n\"Red\" Powers, the shortest, fattest and squattiest man in the\r\nbattalion, is investing himself with baggy, red garments, trimmed with\r\nwhite fur and tassels, all made out of cloth by hands whose familiarity\r\nwith the needle has been acquired in bayonet practice. Powers has donned\r\nhis white wig and whiskers and his red cap, tasseled in white. He is\r\nreceiving his final instructions from the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"You may grunt, Powers,\" the colonel is saying, \"but don't attempt to\r\ntalk French with that Chicago accent. We don't want to frighten the\r\nchildren. And remember, you are not Santa Claus. You are Papa Noel.\r\nThat's what the French children call Santa Claus.\"\r\n\r\nIt is three o'clock, and the regimental band, assembled in marching\r\nformation in the village street, blares out \"I Wish I Were in the Land\r\nof Cotton,\" and there is an outpouring of children, women and soldiers\r\nfrom every door on the street. The colonel and his staff stand in front\r\nof their quarters opposite the band, and a thousand American soldiers,\r\nin holiday disregard for formation, range along either side of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe large wooden gate of the stable yard, next to the commandant's\r\nquarters, swings open; there is a jingle of bells, and \"Hindenburg,\"\r\nresplendent in his fittings, and Papa Noel Powers sitting high on the\r\npackage-heaped sleigh, move out into the street. Their appearance is met\r\nwith a crash of cymbals, the blare of the band's loudest brass, and the\r\nhappy cries of the children and the deeper cheers of the men.\r\n\r\nChristmas had come to Saint Thiébault. Up the street went the\r\nprocession, the band in the lead playing a lively jingling piece of\r\nmusic well matched to the keenness of the air and the willingness of\r\nyoung blood to tingle with the slightest inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Hindenburg,\" with a huge pair of tin spectacles goggling his eyes,\r\ntossed his head and made the bells ring all over his gala caparison.\r\nPapa Noel, mounted on the pyramid of presents, bowed right and left and\r\nwaved his hands to the children, to the soldiers, to the old men and the\r\nold women.\r\n\r\nAs the youngsters followed in the wake of the sleigh, the soldiers\r\npicked them up and carried them on their shoulders, on \"piggy\" back, or\r\nheld them out so they could shake hands with Papa Noel and hear that\r\ndignitary gurgle his appreciation in wonderful north pole language.\r\n\r\nWhen Papa Noel found out that he could trust the flour paste and did not\r\nhave to hold his whiskers on by biting them, he gravely announced, \"Wee,\r\nwee,\" to all the bright-eyed, red-cheeked salutations directed his way.\r\n\r\nThe band halted in front of the ancient church of Saint Thiébault, where\r\nold Father Gabrielle stood in the big doorway, smiling and rubbing his\r\nhands. Upon his invitation the children entered and were placed in the\r\nfirst row of chairs, the mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and young\r\nwomen sat in back of them, and further back sat the regimental officers.\r\nThe soldiers filled the rest of the church to the doors.\r\n\r\nThe brief ceremony ended with a solemn benediction and then the curtains\r\nwere drawn back from one of the arches in front of and to the left of\r\nthe main altar.\r\n\r\nThere stood Saint Thiébault's first Christmas tree, or at least the\r\nfirst one in four years. It was lighted with candles and was resplendent\r\nwith decorations that represented long hours of work with shears and\r\npaste on the part of unaccustomed fingers. Suggestions from a thousand\r\nChristmas minds were on that tree, and the result showed it. The star of\r\nBethlehem, made of tinsel, glistened in the candlelight.\r\n\r\nNot even the inbred decorum of the church was sufficient to restrain the\r\ninvoluntary expressions of admiration of the saint by the seventy\r\nyoungsters. They oh-ed and ah-ed and pointed, but they enjoyed it not a\r\nwhit more than did the other children in the church, some of whose ages\r\nran to three score and more.\r\n\r\nPapa Noel walked down the centre aisle leading a file of soldiers, each\r\nof whom carried a heaping armful of packages. Young necks craned and\r\neyes bulged as the packages were deposited on the tables in front of the\r\ncommunion rail. M. Lecompte raised his hands for silence and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"These Americans,\" he said, \"have come to our country to march and to\r\nfight side by side with your fathers and your big brothers and your\r\nuncles and all the men folk who have been away from Saint Thiébault so\r\nlong. These Americans want to take their places for you to-day. These\r\nAmericans in doing these things for you are thinking of their own little\r\ngirls and little boys away back across the ocean who are missing their\r\nfathers and big brothers and uncles to-day, just the same as you miss\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nThere were wet eyes among the women and some of the older men in khaki\r\nclosed their eyes and seemed to be transporting themselves thousands of\r\nmiles away to other scenes and other faces. But the reverie was only for\r\na minute.\r\n\r\nM. Lecompte began calling the names for the distribution of gifts and\r\nthe children of Saint Thiébault began their excited progress toward the\r\ntables. Here Papa Noel delivered the prized packages.\r\n\r\n\"For Marie Louise Larue,\" said M. Lecompte, \"a hair ribbon of gold and\r\nblack with a tortoise bandeau.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Gaston Ponsot, a toy cannon that shoots and six German soldiers at\r\nleast to shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Colette Daville, a warm cape of red cloth with a collar of wool.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Alphonse Bénois, an aeroplane that flies on a string.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Eugenie Fontaine, a doll that speaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Emilie Moreau, a pair of shoes with real leather soles and tops.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Camille Laurent, red mittens of wool and a sheepskin muff.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Jean Artois, a warship that moves and flies the American flag.\"\r\n\r\nIt continued for more than an hour. The promoters of the celebration\r\nwere wise to their work. There was more than one present for each child.\r\nThey did not know how many. Time after time, their names were called and\r\nthey clattered forward in their wooden shoes for each new surprise.\r\n\r\nThe presents ran the range of toys, clothing, games, candies and nuts,\r\nbut the joy was in sitting there and waiting for one's name to be called\r\nand going forward to partake of that most desirable \"more.\"\r\n\r\nBig Moriarity had his hands in the incident that served as a climax to\r\nthe distribution. He had whispered something to M. Lecompte and the\r\nresult was that one little duffer, who sat all alone on a big chair, and\r\nhugged an enormous rubber boot, waited and waited expectantly to hear\r\nthe name \"Pierre Lafite\" called out.\r\n\r\nAll the other names had been called once and not his. He waited. All the\r\nnames had been called twice and still not his. He waited through the\r\nthird and the fourth calling in vain, and his chin was beginning to\r\ntremble suspiciously as the fifth calling proceeded without the sound\r\nof his name.\r\n\r\nThe piles of packages on the tables had been getting smaller all the\r\ntime. Then M. Lecompte pronounced the very last name.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre Lafite,\" he called.\r\n\r\nPierre's heart bounded as he slipped off the chair and started up the\r\naisle dragging his big rubber boot. The rest of the children had\r\nreturned to their seats. All the elders in the church were watching his\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\"For Pierre Lafite,\" repeated M. Lecompte, holding up the enormous boot.\r\n\"A pair of real leather shoes to fit in the foot of the boot.\" He placed\r\nthem there.\r\n\r\n\"And a pair of stilts to fit in the leg of the boot.\" He so placed them.\r\n\r\n\"And a set of soldiers, twenty-four in number, with a general\r\ncommanding, to go beside the stilts.\" He poured them into the boot.\r\n\r\n\"And a pair of gloves and a stocking cap to go on top of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"And a baseball and a bat to go on top of the gloves.\r\n\r\n\"And all the chinks to be filled up with nuts and figs, and sweets.\r\n_Voilà_, Pierre,\" and with these words, he had poured the sweetmeats in\r\noverflowing measure into the biggest hip boot in the regiment.\r\n\r\nAmid the cheers of the men, led by big Moriarity, Pierre started toward\r\nhis seat, struggling with the seven league boot and the wholesale booty,\r\nand satisfied with the realisation that in one haul he had obtained more\r\nthan his companions in five.\r\n\r\nCompany B quartet sang \"Down in a Coal Hole,\" and then, as the band\r\nstruck up outside the church, all moved to the street. The sun had gone\r\ndown, the early winter night had set in, and the sky was almost dark.\r\n\r\n\"Signal for the barrage,\" came the command in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThere were four simultaneous hisses of fire and four comets of flame\r\nsprang up from the ground. They broke far overhead in lurid green.\r\n\r\n\"Signal for enemy planes overhead,\" was the next command, and four more\r\nrockets mounted and ended their flights in balls of luminous red. Other\r\ncommands, other signals, other rockets, other lights and flares and\r\npistol star shells, enriched a pyrotechnical display which was\r\neconomically combined with signal practice.\r\n\r\nThe red glare illuminated the upturned happy faces of American and\r\nFrench together. Our men learned to love the French people. The French\r\npeople learned to love us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCHÂTEAU-THIERRY AND THE BOIS DE BELLEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to show in preceding chapters the development of the\r\nyoung American army in France from a mere handful of new troops up to\r\nthe creation of units capable of independent action on the front. Only\r\nthat intense and thorough training made it possible for our oversea\r\nforces to play the veteran part they did play in the great Second Battle\r\nof the Marne.\r\n\r\nThe battle developed as a third phase of the enemy's Western Front\r\noffensives of the year. The increasing strength of the American forces\r\noverseas forced Germany to put forth her utmost efforts in the forlorn\r\nhope of gaining a decision in the field before the Allied lines could\r\nhave the advantage of America's weight.\r\n\r\nOn March 21st, the Germans had launched their first powerful offensive\r\non a front of fifty miles from Arras to Noyon in Picardy and had\r\nadvanced their lines from St. Quentin to the outskirts of Amiens.\r\n\r\nOn April 9th, the German hordes struck again in Flanders on a front of\r\ntwenty miles from Lens northward to the River Lys and had cut into the\r\nAllied front as far as Armentières.\r\n\r\nThere followed what was considered an abnormal delay in the third act of\r\nthe demonstration. It was known that the Germans were engaged in making\r\nelaborate arrangements for this mid-summer push. It was the enemy hope\r\nin this great offensive to strike a final effective blow against the\r\nhard-pressed Allied line before America's rising power could be thrown\r\ninto the fight.\r\n\r\nThe blow fell on the morning of May 27th. The front selected for the\r\nassault was twenty-five miles in width, extending from the Ailette near\r\nVauxaillon to the Aisne-Marne Canal near Brimont. The Prussian Crown\r\nPrince was the titular chief of the group of armies used in the assault.\r\nOne of these forces was the army of General von Boehm, which before the\r\nattack had numbered only nine divisions and had extended from the Oise\r\nat Noyon to east of Craconne. The other army was that of General Fritz\r\nvon Bülow, previously composed of eight divisions and supporting a front\r\nthat extended from Craconne across the Rheims front to Suippe, near\r\nAuberive. On the day of the attack, these armies had been strengthened\r\nto twice their normal number of divisions, and subsequently captured\r\nGerman plans revealed that the enemy expected to use forty-five\r\ndivisions or practically half a million men in the onslaught.\r\n\r\nThe battle began at dawn. It was directed against the weakly held French\r\npositions on the Chemin des Dames. It was preceded by a three hour\r\nbombardment of terrific intensity. The French defenders were outnumbered\r\nfour to one. The Germans put down a rolling barrage that was two miles\r\ndeep. It destroyed all wire communications and flooded battery\r\nemplacements and machine gun posts with every brand of poison gas known\r\nto German kultur. Dust and artificial smoke clouds separated the\r\ndefenders into small groups and screened the attacking waves until they\r\nhad actually penetrated the French positions.\r\n\r\nThe French fought hard to resist the enemy flood across the Chemin des\r\nDames with its ground sacred with tragic memories, but a withdrawal was\r\nnecessary. The French command was forced to order a retreat to the\r\nAisne. Hard-fighting French divisions and some units of the British\r\nFifth Army, which had been badly hit in Picardy in March, made an\r\norderly withdrawal southward.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the fight the enemy made a strong thrust toward\r\nSoissons, and after keeping the city under continual bombardment,\r\nsucceeded in overcoming all resistance and occupying the city on May\r\n29th. On the first day of the attack alone, twelve thousand explosive,\r\nincendiary and poison gas shells were hurled in amongst the hospitals in\r\nSoissons. American ambulance units did heroic work in the removal of the\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe Germans forced a crossing on the Aisne. On the following day, May\r\n30th, they had crossed the Vesle River and had captured\r\nFère-en-Tardenois. On the following day their victorious hordes had\r\nreached the Marne and were closing in on Château-Thierry.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the terrific strength of the enemy offensive may be gained\r\nfrom a recapitulation which would show that in five days the Germans had\r\npushed through five successive lines of Allied defence, and had\r\npenetrated more than twenty-five miles. On the first day, they had\r\ncaptured the Chemin des Dames, on the second day, they had overcome all\r\nresistance on the Aisne, on the third day, their forces, pushing\r\nsouthward, had crossed the Vesle River, on the fourth day, they had\r\ndestroyed the lines of resistance along the Ourcq, on the fifth day,\r\nthey had reached the Marne.\r\n\r\nIt was a crisis. The battle front formed a vast triangle with the apex\r\npointing southward toward Paris. The west side of the triangle extended\r\nfifty miles northward from the Marne to the Oise near Noyon. The east\r\nside of the triangle ran north-eastward thirty miles to Rheims. The\r\npoint of this new thrust at Paris rested on the north bank of the Marne\r\nat Château-Thierry. The enemy had advanced to within forty miles of the\r\ncapital of France; the fate of the Allied world hung in the balance.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly I am prejudiced, but I like to feel that I know the real\r\nreason why the German hordes stopped at Château-Thierry on the north\r\nbank of the Marne. To me that reason will always be this--because on the\r\nsouth bank of the Marne stood the Americans.\r\n\r\nOn that day and in that event there materialised the German fears which\r\nhad urged them on to such great speed and violence. In the eleventh\r\nhour, there at the peak of the German thrust, there at the climax of\r\nGermany's triumphant advances, there at the point where a military\r\ndecision for the enemy seemed almost within grasp, there and then the\r\nAmerican soldier stepped into the breech to save the democracy of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Marne River makes a loop at this place and Château-Thierry lies on\r\nboth banks. The Marne there is called a river, but it would hardly come\r\nup to the American understanding of the word. The waterway is more like\r\na canal with banks built up with stone blocks. There are streets on\r\neither bank, and these being the principal streets of the town, are\r\nbordered with comparatively high buildings.\r\n\r\nWhile the Germans were on the outskirts of the city, American forces had\r\nmade brilliant counter attacks on both sides. To the west of\r\nChâteau-Thierry the German advance forces, seeking to penetrate Neuilly\r\nWood, had been hurled back by our young troops. To the east of\r\nChâteau-Thierry the enemy had succeeded in crossing the Marne in the\r\nvicinity of Jaulgonne.\r\n\r\nThis operation was carried out by the German 36th Division. On the night\r\nof May 30th, at a point where the Marne looped northward eight miles to\r\nthe east of Château-Thierry, the enemy succeeded in putting a few men\r\nacross the river.\r\n\r\nAlong the south bank of the river at that place, the Paris-Châlons ran\r\nthrough a number of deep cuts and one tunnel. The enemy took shelter in\r\nthese natural protections. They suffered serious losses from the Allied\r\nartillery which also destroyed some of their pontoons across the river,\r\nbut in spite of this, the Germans succeeded in re-enforcing the units on\r\nthe south bank to the strength of about a battalion.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, the French defenders at this place received\r\nre-enforcements from the Americans. Units of the 3rd United States\r\nRegular Division and the 28th U. S. Division, comprised largely of\r\nPennsylvania National Guardsmen, were rushed forward from training\r\nareas, miles back of the line, where they were engaged in fitting\r\nthemselves for line duty. These incompletely trained American units\r\nabandoned their bayonet-stabbing of gunny-sacks and make-believe warfare\r\nto rush forward into the real thing.\r\n\r\nOn June 2nd, these Americans, under command of French officers, began\r\nthe counter attack to sweep the Germans back from the south bank. By\r\nthat time the enemy had succeeded in putting twenty-two light bridges\r\nacross the Marne and had established a strong bridgehead position with a\r\nnumber of machine guns and a strong force of men in the railway station\r\non the south bank of the river opposite Jaulgonne.\r\n\r\nThis position was attacked frontally by the Americans and French. Our\r\nnovices in battle were guilty of numerous so-called strategical\r\nblunders, but in the main purpose of killing the enemy, they proved\r\nirresistible. The Germans broke and ran. At the same time, the French\r\nartillery lowered a terrific barrage on the bridges crossing the river,\r\nwith the result that many of the fleeing enemy were killed and more\r\ndrowned. Only thirty or forty escaped by swimming. One hundred of them\r\nthrew down their arms and surrendered. The remainder of the battalion\r\nwas wiped out. At the close of the engagement the Americans and the\r\nFrench were in full command of the south bank.\r\n\r\nBut it was in Château-Thierry itself that the Germans made their most\r\ndetermined effort to cross the river and get a footing on the south\r\nbank, and it was there, again, that their efforts were frustrated by our\r\nforces. On May 31st, American machine gun units, then in training\r\nseventy-five kilometres south of the Marne, were hurriedly bundled into\r\nmotor lorries and rushed northward into Château-Thierry.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were advancing their patrols into the north side of the\r\ncity. They were pouring down the streets in large numbers, with the\r\nevident purpose of crossing the bridges and establishing themselves on\r\nthe south bank.\r\n\r\nIt was four o'clock in the afternoon of May 31st that those American\r\nmachine gunners got their first glimpse of real war. That night while\r\nthe German artillery raked the south bank of the river with high\r\nexplosive shells, those Americans, shouldering their machine guns,\r\nmarched into the city and took up defensive positions on the south bank\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nDuring the night many houses were turned into ruins. Shells striking the\r\nrailroad station had caused it to burn. In the red glare our men saw the\r\nhouses about them collapse under clouds of dust and débris. Under cover\r\nof darkness the Germans filtered through the streets on the north side\r\nof the river. The American machine gunners went into position in the\r\nwindows of houses on the south bank and in gardens between the houses,\r\nand from these positions it was possible to command all of the bridge\r\napproaches and streets leading to the river on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, Lieutenant John T. Bissell, a young Pittsburgher but\r\nrecently graduated from West Point, started across one of the bridges\r\nand reached the north bank with a squad of a dozen men and two machine\r\nguns. This little unit went into position in a place commanding the\r\nforked highways which converged not far from the northern approach of\r\nthe iron bridge crossing the river. It was this unit's function to\r\nprevent the enemy advance from this direction. The unit was separated\r\nfrom its comrades on the south bank by the river and about two hundred\r\nyards. In spite of the fact that the enemy artillery intensified its\r\nshelling of the south bank, the American machine gunners remained at\r\ntheir posts without firing and played a waiting game.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of dawn the Germans began to make their rushes for the\r\nbridges. Small compact forces would dart forward carrying light machine\r\nguns and ammunition with them. They encountered a terrific burst of\r\nAmerican fire and wilted in front of it. Those that survived crawled\r\nback to the shelter of protecting walls, where they were re-enforced\r\nwith fresh units, and again the massed formations charged down the\r\nstreets toward the bridges. The slaughter of Germans increased until the\r\napproaches were dotted with bodies of the enemy slain.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st, the Germans having consolidated positions on the hills\r\ncommanding the city from the north, they directed a terrific artillery\r\nand machine gun fire into our exposed positions on the south bank, as\r\nwell as the small posts still held on the north bank by Lieutenant\r\nBissell and his machine gunners. Although the position held by the\r\nlittle American group had long been considered untenable, the members of\r\nit stuck it out until nightfall, when they received orders to retire to\r\nthe south bank. At the same time, French colonials which had held a\r\nposition throughout the day on the north bank on the edge of the town,\r\nwithdrew in accordance with the same plan. The retirement of both\r\nparties was covered by our machine gunners on the south bank, who poured\r\na hot fire into the evacuated areas as the Germans began occupying them.\r\n\r\nBy 10:30 that night the completion of the movement was signalised by a\r\nterrific explosion, as the French colonials blew up one of the stone\r\nbridges over which they had withdrawn. But the destruction of the bridge\r\nhad cut off the little band of Americans and left them almost surrounded\r\nby the enemy on the north bank of the river, which was now becoming\r\nstrongly populated by the enemy. Through the darkness could be heard the\r\nsound of shuffling, hobnailed boots, and even above the crack of the\r\nguns there came the weird swish of the grey coats as they pushed forward\r\nin mass formations.\r\n\r\nThe little party of thirteen Americans dismantled their guns and, with\r\neach man carrying his allotted piece, they began working their way along\r\nthe river bank toward the main bridge, where they discovered that the\r\nenemy was almost upon them. They immediately went into position behind\r\nthe stone parapet on the very brink of the river, and, although in\r\nconstant danger from the American fire that poured out from the south\r\nbank, they poured streams of lead point-blank into the advancing German\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nThe Americans on the south bank were not aware of the plight of the\r\nlittle party on the north bank. In spite of their losses, the Germans\r\ncontinued their grewsome rushes toward the approaches of the iron bridge\r\nacross which our machine gunners were pouring a devastating fire.\r\nLieutenant Bissell and his men made one effort to cross the bridge, but\r\nwere forced to crawl back to shelter on the north bank, carrying with\r\nthem three of their wounded. They found themselves between a cross-fire.\r\nThen Bissell, alone, approached as near as he dared, and the first\r\nintimation that the Americans on the south bank had of the fact that\r\nAmericans were in front of them was when Lieutenant Cobey heard\r\nBissell's voice calling his name. A cease fire order was immediately\r\ngiven and Bissell and his men rushed across the bridge, carrying their\r\nwounded with them.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Germans were in occupation of all the houses\r\nfacing the north bank of the river, and could be seen from time to time\r\ndarting from one shelter to another. Throughout the day their artillery\r\nmaintained a terrific downpour of shells on the positions held by our\r\nmen on the south bank. So intense was the rifle fire and activity of\r\nsnipers, that it meant death to appear in the open. The Americans manned\r\ntheir guns throughout the day, but refrained from indulging in machine\r\ngun fire because it was not desired to reveal the locations of the guns.\r\nNightfall approached with a quiet that was deadly ominous of impending\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock the enemy formations lunged forward to the attack. Their\r\ndense masses charged down the streets leading toward the river. They\r\nsang as they advanced. The orders, as revealed in documents captured\r\nlater, came straight from the high command and demanded the acquisition\r\nof a foothold on the south bank at all costs. They paid the costs, but\r\nnever reached the south bank.\r\n\r\nThe American machine gun fire was withering. Time after time, in the\r\nfrequent rushes throughout the night, the remnants of enemy masses would\r\nreach sometimes as far as the centre of the big bridge, but none of them\r\nsucceeded in reaching the south bank. The bridge became carpeted with\r\nGerman dead and wounded. They lay thick in the open streets near the\r\napproaches. By morning their dead were piled high on the bridge and\r\nsubsequent rushes endeavoured to advance over the bodies of their fallen\r\ncomrades. In this battle of the bridges and the streets, our men showed\r\na courage and determination which aroused the admiration of the French\r\nofficers, who were aware by this time that forty-eight hours before\r\nthese same American soldiers had seen battle for the first time.\r\n\r\nOur machine gunners turned the northern bank of the river into a No\r\nMan's Land. Their vigilance was unrelenting and every enemy attempt to\r\nelude it met with disaster. There were serious American casualties\r\nduring that terrific fire, but they were nothing in comparison with the\r\nthousand or more German dead that dotted the streets and clogged the\r\nrunways of the big bridge in piles. The last night of the fight enormous\r\ncharges of explosive were placed beneath the bridge and discharged.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was destroyed. High into the air were blown bits of stone,\r\nsteel, timber, débris, wreckage and the bodies of German dead, all to\r\nfall back into the river and go bobbing up and down in the waters of the\r\nMarne.\r\n\r\nThus did the Americans save the day at Château-Thierry, but it became\r\nimmediately necessary for the French high command to call upon our young\r\nforces for another great effort. In response to this call, the Second\r\nUnited States Division, including one brigade of the United States\r\nMarines, the 5th and 6th Regiments, started for the front. The division\r\nwas then occupying support positions in the vicinity of Gisors behind\r\nthe Picardy line. At four o'clock on the morning of May 31st the Marine\r\nbrigade and regiments of United States infantry, the 9th and the 23rd\r\nRegulars, boarded camions, twenty to thirty men and their equipment in\r\neach vehicle.\r\n\r\nThey were bound eastward to the valley of the Marne. The road took them\r\nthrough the string of pretty villages fifteen miles to the north of\r\nParis. The trucks loaded with United States troops soon became part of\r\nthe endless traffic of war that was pouring northward and eastward\r\ntoward the raging front. Our men soon became coated with the dust of the\r\nroad. The French people in the villages through which they passed at top\r\nspeed cheered them and threw flowers into the lorries.\r\n\r\nBetween Meaux and Château-Thierry, where the road wound along the Marne,\r\nour men encountered long trains of French refugees, weary mothers\r\ncarrying hungry babies at the breast, farm wagons loaded with household\r\nbelongings, usually surmounted by feather mattresses on which rode\r\ngrey-haired grandfathers and grandmothers. This pitiful procession was\r\nmoving toward the rear driving before it flocks of geese and herds of\r\ncattle. On the other side of the road war, grim war, moved in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe Second Division was bound for the line to the northwest of\r\nChâteau-Thierry. On June 1st, the 6th Marines relieved the French on the\r\nsupport lines. The sector of the 6th Regiment joined on the left the\r\nsector held by two battalions of the 5th. The line on the right was held\r\nby the French. On June 2nd, the hard-pressed French line, weak and weary\r\nfrom continual rear guard actions, over a hard fighting period of\r\nalmost a week, fell back by prearranged plan and passed through the\r\nsupport positions which we held. To fill gaps between units, the Marines\r\nextended their brigade sector to between twelve and fourteen kilometres.\r\nAs the French withdrew to the rear, hard pressed by the enemy, the\r\nMarines held the new first line.\r\n\r\nThe regimental headquarters of the 6th was located in a stone farmhouse\r\nat a cross-roads called La Voie Châtel, situated between the villages of\r\nChampillon and Lucy-le-Bocage. There was clear observation from that\r\npoint toward the north. At five o'clock in the afternoon on that day of\r\nclear visibility, the Germans renewed their attacks from the north and\r\nnortheast toward a position called Hill 165, which was defended by the\r\n5th Regiment.\r\n\r\nThe Germans advanced in two solid columns across a field of golden\r\nwheat. More than half of the two columns had left the cover of the trees\r\nand were moving in perfect order across the field when the shrapnel fire\r\nfrom the American artillery in the rear got range on the target. Burst\r\nafter burst of white smoke suddenly appeared in the air over the column,\r\nand under each burst the ground was marked with a circle of German dead.\r\nIt was not barrage fire: it was individual firing against two individual\r\nmoving targets and its success spoke well for the training which that\r\nbrigade of American artillery had received.\r\n\r\nFrench aviators from above directed the fire of our guns, and from high\r\nin the air signalled down their \"bravos\" in congratulation on the\r\nexcellent work. At the same time, the machine gunners of the 5th covered\r\nthe ravines and wooded clumps with a hot fire to prevent small bodies of\r\nthe enemy from infiltrating through our lines. The French marvelled at\r\nthe deliberateness and accuracy of our riflemen.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, unaware that a change had taken place in the personnel that\r\nfaced them, reeled back demoralised and unable to understand how such a\r\nsudden show of resistance had been presented by the weakened French\r\ntroops which they had been driving before them for a week. The enemy's\r\nadvance had been made openly and confidently in the mistaken flush of\r\nvictory. Their triumphant advances of the previous week had more than\r\nsupported the statements of the German officers, who had told their men\r\nthat they were on the road to Paris--the end of the war and peace. It\r\nwas in this mood of victory that the enemy encountered the Marines'\r\nstone wall and reeled back in surprise.\r\n\r\nThat engagement, in addition to lowering the enemy morale, deprived them\r\nof their offensive spirit and placed them on the defensive. The next few\r\ndays were spent in advancing small strong points and the strengthening\r\nof positions. In broad daylight one group of Marines rushed a German\r\nmachine gun pit in the open, killed or wounded every man in the crew,\r\ndisabled the gun and got back to their lines in safety.\r\n\r\nIt was at five o'clock on the bright afternoon of June 6th that the\r\nUnited States Marines began to carve their way into history in the\r\nbattle of the Bois de Belleau. Major General Harbord, former Chief of\r\nStaff to General Pershing, was in command of the Marine brigade. Orders\r\nwere received for a general advance on the brigade front. The main\r\nobjectives were the eastern edge of the Bois de Belleau and the towns of\r\nBussiares, Torcy and Bouresches.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of liaison in the thickets of the wood, and\r\nbecause of the almost impossible task of directing it in conjunction\r\nwith the advancing lines, the artillery preparation for the attack was\r\nnecessarily brief. At five o'clock to the dot the Marines moved out from\r\nthe woods in perfect order, and started across the wheat fields in four\r\nlong waves. It was a beautiful sight, these men of ours going across\r\nthose flat fields toward the tree clusters beyond from which the Germans\r\npoured a murderous machine gun fire.\r\n\r\nThe woods were impregnated with nests of machine guns, but our advance\r\nproved irresistible. Many of our men fell, but those that survived\r\npushed on through the woods, bayoneting right and left and firing as\r\nthey charged. So sweeping was the advance that in some places small\r\nisolated units of our men found themselves with Germans both before and\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThe enemy put up a stubborn resistance on the left, and it was not until\r\nlater in the evening that this part of the line reached the northeast\r\nedge of the woods, after it had completely surrounded a most populous\r\nmachine gun nest which was located on a rocky hill. During the fighting\r\nColonel Catlin was wounded and Captain Laspierre, the French liaison\r\nofficer, was gassed, two casualties which represented a distinct blow to\r\nthe brigade, but did not hinder its further progress.\r\n\r\nOn the right Lieutenant Robertson, with twenty survivors out of his\r\nentire platoon, emerged from the terrific enemy barrage and took the\r\ntown of Bouresches at the point of the bayonet. Captain Duncan,\r\nreceiving word that one Marine company, with a determination to engage\r\nthe enemy in hand-to-hand combat, had gone two hundred yards in advance,\r\nraced forward on the double quick with the 96th Marine Company, and was\r\nmet by a terrific machine gun barrage from both sides of Bouresches.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Robertson, looking back, saw Duncan and the rest of his\r\ncompany going down like flies as they charged through the barrage. He\r\nsaw Lieutenant Bowling get up from the ground, his face white with pain,\r\nand go stumbling ahead with a bullet in his shoulder. Duncan, carrying a\r\nstick and with his pipe in his mouth, was mowed down in the rain of\r\nlead. Robertson saw Dental Surgeon Osborne pick Duncan up. With the aid\r\nof a Hospital Corps man, they had just gained the shelter of some trees\r\nwhen a shell wiped all three of them out.\r\n\r\nIn the street fighting that ensued in Bouresches, Lieutenant Robertson's\r\norderly, Private Dunlavy, who was later killed in the defence of the\r\ntown, captured one of the enemy's own machine guns and turned it against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the dense woods the Germans showed their mastery of machine gun\r\nmanipulation and the method of infiltration by which they would place\r\nstrong units in our rear and pour in a deadly fire. Many of these guns\r\nwere located on rocky ridges, from which they could fire to all points.\r\nThese Marines worked with reckless courage against heavy odds, and the\r\nGermans exacted a heavy toll for every machine gun that was captured or\r\ndisabled, but in spite of losses the Marine advance continued.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Overton, commanding the 76th Company, made a brilliant charge\r\nagainst a strong German position at the top of a rocky hill. He and his\r\nmen captured all of the guns and all of their crews. Overton was hit\r\nlater when the Germans retaliated by a concentration of fire against the\r\ncaptured position for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Robertson, according to the report brought back by a\r\nregimental runner, was last seen flat on a rock not twenty yards away\r\nfrom one enemy gun, at which he kept shooting with an automatic in each\r\nhand. He was hit three times before he consented to let his men carry\r\nhim to the rear.\r\n\r\n\"There was not an officer left in the 82nd Company,\" according to a\r\nletter by Major Frank E. Evans, Adjutant of the Sixth. \"Major Sibley and\r\nhis Adjutant reorganised them under close fire and led them in a charge\r\nthat put one particular machine gun nest out of business at the most\r\ncritical time in all the fighting. I heard later that at that stage some\r\none said: 'Major Sibley ordered that--' and another man said: 'Where in\r\nhell is Sibley?' Sibley was twenty yards away at that time and a hush\r\nwent down the line when they saw him step out to lead the charge.\r\n\r\n\"And when the word got around through that dead-tired, crippled outfit\r\nthat 'the Old Man' was on the line, all hell could not have stopped that\r\nrush.\"\r\n\r\nIn such fashion did the Marines go through the Bois de Belleau. Their\r\nlosses were heavy, but they did the work. The sacrifice was necessary.\r\nParis was in danger. The Marines constituted the thin line between the\r\nenemy and Paris. The Marines not only held that line--they pushed it\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe fighting was terrific. In one battalion alone the casualties\r\nnumbered sixty-four per cent. officers and sixty-four per cent. men.\r\nSeveral companies came out of the fighting under command of their first\r\nsergeants, all of the officers having been killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nI witnessed some of that fighting. I was with the Marines at the opening\r\nof the battle. I never saw men charge to their death with finer spirit.\r\nI am sorry that wounds prevented me from witnessing the victorious\r\nconclusion of the engagement. In view of my subsequent absence from the\r\nfight, I wish to give credit and thanks at this place to Major Frank E.\r\nEvans, who as Adjutant of the 6th Regiment of Marines, provided me with\r\nmuch of the foregoing material which occurred while I was in the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe bravery of that Marine brigade in the Bois de Belleau fight will\r\never remain a bright chapter in the records of the American Army. For\r\nthe performance of deeds of exceptional valour, more than a hundred\r\nMarines were awarded Distinguished Service Crosses. General Pershing, in\r\nrecognition of the conduct of the Second Division, issued the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n  \"It is with inexpressible pride and satisfaction that your commander\r\n  recounts your glorious deeds on the field of battle. In the early\r\n  days of June on a front of twenty kilometres, after night marches\r\n  and with only the reserve rations which you carried, you stood like\r\n  a wall against the enemy advance on Paris. For this timely action\r\n  you have received the thanks of the French people whose homes you\r\n  saved and the generous praise of your comrades in arms.\r\n\r\n  \"Since the organisation of our sector, in the face of strong\r\n  opposition, you have advanced your lines two kilometres on a front\r\n  of eight kilometres. You have engaged and defeated with great loss\r\n  three German divisions and have occupied important strong\r\n  points--Belleau Wood, Bouresches, and Vaux. You have taken about\r\n  1,400 prisoners, many machine guns, and much other material. The\r\n  complete success of the infantry was made possible by the splendid\r\n  co-operation of the artillery, by the aid and assistance of the\r\n  engineer and signal troops, by the diligent and watchful care of the\r\n  medical and supply services, and by the unceasing work of the\r\n  well-organised staff. All elements of the division have worked\r\n  together as a well-trained machine.\r\n\r\n  \"Amid the dangers and trials of battle, every officer and every man\r\n  has done well his part. Let the stirring deeds, hardships, and\r\n  sacrifices of the past month remain forever a bright spot in our\r\n  history. Let the sacred memory of our fallen comrades spur us on to\r\n  renewed effort and to the glory of American arms.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the German prisoners captured by the Marines in the Bois de\r\nBelleau could express only surprise over the fighting capacity of their\r\ncaptors. Prisoners' statements are not entirely trustworthy, but here is\r\none that was not intended for American consumption. It was written by a\r\nGerman soldier, who was killed in the Bois de Belleau before he had an\r\nopportunity to mail it. It was removed from his body. It reads:\r\n\r\n                                         \"France, June 21, 1918.\r\n\r\n  \"We are now in the battle zone and canteens dare not come to us on\r\n  account of the enemy, for the Americans are bombarding the villages\r\n  fifteen kilometres behind the present front with long-range guns,\r\n  and you will know that the canteen outfit and the others who are\r\n  lying in reserve do not venture very far, for it is not 'pleasant to\r\n  eat cherries' with the Americans. The reason for that is that they\r\n  have not yet had much experience. The American divisions are still\r\n  too fiery. They are the first divisions that the French have\r\n  entered.... We will also show the Americans how good we are, for the\r\n  day before yesterday we bombarded them heavily with our gas. About\r\n  400 of us are lying around here. We have one corner of the woods and\r\n  the American has the other corner. That is not nice, for all of a\r\n  sudden he rushes forward and one does not know it beforehand.\r\n  Therefore, one must shoot at every little noise, for one cannot\r\n  trust them. Here always two men have dug a hold for themselves. Here\r\n  one lies day and night without a blanket, only with a coat and a\r\n  shelter-half. One freezes at night like a tailor, for the nights are\r\n  fiercely cold. I hope that I will be lucky enough to escape from\r\n  this horrible mess, for up to now I have always been lucky. Many of\r\n  my comrades are already buried here. The enemy sweeps every evening\r\n  the whole countryside with machine gun and rifle fire, and then\r\n  artillery fire. But we in front line are safer than in the support\r\n  position. At present our food is miserable. We are now fed upon\r\n  dried vegetables and marmalade and when at night we obtain more food\r\n  it is unpalatable. It is half sour and all cold. In the daytime we\r\n  receive nothing.\"\r\n\r\nBut it might be wise to support this statement from a German soldier in\r\nthe ranks by excerpts from an official German army report which was\r\ncaptured July 7th on a German officer. The document was a carefully\r\nweighed treatise on the fighting capacity of the United States Marines.\r\nThe document had the following heading:\r\n\r\n  _\"Intelligence Officer of the Supreme Command at Army Headquarters,\r\n  Number 7, J. Number 3,528, Army Headquarters, June 17, 1917._\r\n\r\n  _\"Second American Infantry Division._\r\n\r\n  _\"Examination of Prisoners from the 5th, 6th, 9th and 23rd\r\n  Regiments, captured from June 5th to 14th, in the Bouresches\r\n  Sector.\"_\r\n\r\nAfter setting forth all information gained, concerning the purpose of\r\nattack and the arrival of the American units on the line, the German\r\nIntelligence Report continues, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The Second American Division may be classed as a very good\r\n  division, perhaps even as assault troops. The various attacks of\r\n  both regiments on Belleau Wood were carried out with dash and\r\n  recklessness. The moral effect of our firearms did not materially\r\n  check the advances of the enemy. The nerves of the Americans are\r\n  still unshaken.\r\n\r\n  \"VALUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL--the individual soldiers are very good.\r\n  They are healthy, vigorous, and physically well-developed men, of\r\n  ages ranging from eighteen to twenty-eight, who at present lack only\r\n  necessary training to make them redoubtable opponents. The troops\r\n  are fresh and full of straightforward confidence. A remark of one of\r\n  the prisoners is indicative of their spirit: 'We kill or get\r\n  killed.'\r\n\r\n  \"MORALE--the prisoners in general make an alert and pleasing\r\n  impression. Regarding military matters, however, they do not show\r\n  the slightest interest. Their superiors keep them purposely without\r\n  knowledge of the military subjects. For example, most of them have\r\n  never seen a map. They are no longer able to describe the villages\r\n  and roads through which they marched. Their idea of the organisation\r\n  of their unit is entirely confused. For example, one of them told us\r\n  that his brigade had six regiments and his division twenty-four.\r\n  They still regard the war from the point of view of the 'big\r\n  brother' who comes to help his hard-pressed brethren and is\r\n  therefore welcomed everywhere. A certain moral background is not\r\n  lacking. The majority of the prisoners simply took as a matter of\r\n  course that they have come to Europe to defend their country.\r\n\r\n  \"Only a few of the troops are of pure American origin; the majority\r\n  is of German, Dutch and Italian parentage, but these semi-Americans,\r\n  almost all of whom were born in America and never have been in\r\n  Europe before, fully feel themselves to be true born sons of their\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n                                           (Signed) \"VON BERG,\r\n                               \"Lieutenant and Intelligence Officer.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the days I read Hugo's chapters on the Battle of Waterloo in \"Les\r\nMisérables,\" I always considered as an ideal of fighting capacity and\r\nthe military spirit of sacrifice the old sergeant of Napoleon's Old\r\nGuard. Hugo made me vividly see that old sergeant standing on a field\r\nwith a meagre remnant of the Old Guard gathered around him. Unable to\r\nresist further, but unwilling to accept surrender, he and his followers\r\nfaced the British cannon. The British, respecting this admirable\r\ndemonstration of courage, ceased firing and called out to them, \"Brave\r\nFrenchmen, surrender.\"\r\n\r\nThe old sergeant, who was about to die, refused to accept this offer of\r\nhis life from the enemy. Into the very muzzles of the British cannon the\r\nsergeant hurled back the offer of his life with one word. That word was\r\nthe vilest epithet in the French language. The cannons roared and the\r\nold sergeant and his survivors died with the word on their lips. Hugo\r\nwisely devoted an entire chapter to that single word.\r\n\r\nBut I have a new ideal to-day. I found it in the Bois de Belleau. A\r\nsmall platoon line of Marines lay on their faces and bellies under the\r\ntrees at the edge of a wheat field. Two hundred yards across that flat\r\nfield the enemy was located in trees. I peered into the trees but could\r\nsee nothing, yet I knew that every leaf in the foliage screened scores\r\nof German machine guns that swept the field with lead. The bullets\r\nnipped the tops of the young wheat and ripped the bark from the trunks\r\nof the trees three feet from the ground on which the Marines lay. The\r\nminute for the Marine advance was approaching. An old gunnery sergeant\r\ncommanded the platoon in the absence of the lieutenant, who had been\r\nshot and was out of the fight. This old sergeant was a Marine veteran.\r\nHis cheeks were bronzed with the wind and sun of the seven seas. The\r\nservice bar across his left breast showed that he had fought in the\r\nPhilippines, in Santo Domingo, at the walls of Pekin, and in the streets\r\nof Vera Cruz. I make no apologies for his language. Even if Hugo were\r\nnot my precedent, I would make no apologies. To me his words were\r\nclassic, if not sacred.\r\n\r\nAs the minute for the advance arrived, he arose from the trees first and\r\njumped out onto the exposed edge of that field that ran with lead,\r\nacross which he and his men were to charge. Then he turned to give the\r\ncharge order to the men of his platoon--his mates--the men he loved. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"COME ON, YOU SONS-O'-BITCHES! DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWOUNDED--HOW IT FEELS TO BE SHOT\r\n\r\n\r\nJust how does it feel to be shot on the field of battle? Just what is\r\nthe exact sensation when a bullet burns its way through your flesh or\r\ncrashes through your bones?\r\n\r\nI always wanted to know. As a police reporter I \"covered\" scores of\r\nshooting cases, but I could never learn from the victims what the\r\nprecise feeling was as the piece of lead struck. For long years I had\r\ncherished an inordinate curiosity to know that sensation, if possible,\r\nwithout experiencing it. I was curious and eager for enlightenment just\r\nas I am still anxious to know how it is that some people willingly drink\r\nbuttermilk when it isn't compulsory.\r\n\r\nI am still in the dark concerning the inexplicable taste for the sour,\r\nclotted product of a sweet, well-meaning cow and the buttery, but I have\r\nfound out how it feels to be shot. I know it now by experience.\r\n\r\nThree Germans bullets that violated my person left me as many scars and\r\nat the same time completely satisfied my curiosity. I think now if I can\r\never muster up enough courage to drink a glass of buttermilk, I shall\r\nhave bereft myself of my last inquisitiveness.\r\n\r\nIt happened on June 6th just to the northwest of Château-Thierry in the\r\nBois de Belleau. On the morning of that day I left Paris by motor for a\r\nrush to the front. The Germans were on that day within forty miles of\r\nthe capital of France. On the night before, the citizens of Paris, in\r\ntheir homes and hotels, had heard the roll of the guns drawing ever\r\nnearer. Many had left the city.\r\n\r\nBut American divisions were in the line between the enemy and their\r\ngoal, and the operation of these divisions was my object in hustling to\r\nthe front. On the broad, paved highway from Paris to Meaux, my car\r\npassed miles and miles of loaded motor trucks bound frontward. Long\r\nlines of these carried thousands of Americans. Other long lines were\r\nloaded down with shells and cartridge boxes. On the right side of the\r\nroad, bound for Paris and points back of the line, was an endless stream\r\nof ambulances and other motor trucks bringing back wounded. Dense clouds\r\nof dust hung like a pall over the length of the road. The day was hot,\r\nthe dust was stifling.\r\n\r\nFrom Meaux we proceeded along the straight highway that borders the\r\nsouth banks of the Marne to LaFerte, at which place we crossed the river\r\nand turned north to Montreuil, which was the newly occupied headquarters\r\nof the Second United States Army Division, General Omar Bundy\r\ncommanding. On the day before, the two infantry brigades of that\r\ndivision, one composed of the 5th and 6th U. S. Marines, under command\r\nof Brigadier General Harbord, the other composed of the 9th and 23rd U.\r\nS. Infantry, had been thrown into the line which was just four miles to\r\nthe north and east.\r\n\r\nThe fight had been hot during the morning. The Marines on the left flank\r\nof the divisional sector had been pushing their lines forward through\r\ntriangle woods and the village of Lucy-le-Bocage. The information of\r\ntheir advances was given to me by the Divisional Intelligence officer,\r\nwho occupied a large room in the rear of the building that was used as\r\nDivisional Headquarters. The building was the village _Mairie_, which\r\nalso included the village school-house. Now the desks of the school\r\nchildren were being used by our staff officers and the walls and\r\nblackboards were covered with maps.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied by Lieutenant Oscar Hartzell, formerly of the _New\r\nYork Times_ staff. We learned that orders from the French High Command\r\ncalled for a continuation of the Marine advance during the afternoon and\r\nevening, and this information made it possible for us to make our plans.\r\nAlthough the Germans were shelling roads immediately behind the front,\r\nLieutenant Hartzell and I agreed to proceed by motor from Montreuil a\r\nmile or so to a place called La Voie du Châtel, which was the\r\nheadquarters of Colonel Neveille of the 5th Marines. Reaching that place\r\naround four o'clock, we turned a despatch over to the driver of our\r\nstaff car with instructions that he proceed with all haste to Paris and\r\nthere submit it to the U. S. Press Bureau.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hartzell and I announced our intentions of proceeding at once\r\nto the front line to Colonel Neveille.\r\n\r\n\"Go wherever you like,\" said the regimental commander, looking up from\r\nthe outspread maps on the kitchen table in the low-ceilinged stone\r\nfarm-house that he had adopted as headquarters. \"Go as far as you like,\r\nbut I want to tell you it's damn hot up there.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later found us in the woods to the west of the village of Lucy\r\nle Bocage, in which German shells were continually falling. To the west\r\nand north another nameless cluster of farm dwellings was in flames. Huge\r\nclouds of smoke rolled up like a smudge against the background of blue\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe ground under the trees in the wood was covered with small bits of\r\nwhite paper. I could not account for their presence until I examined\r\nseveral of them and found that these were letters from American mothers\r\nand wives and sweethearts--letters--whole packages of them, which the\r\ntired, dog-weary Marines had been forced to remove from their packs and\r\ndestroy in order to ease the straps that cut into aching grooves in\r\ntheir shoulders. Circumstances also forced the abandonment of much other\r\nmaterial and equipment.\r\n\r\nOccasional shells were dropping in the woods, which were also within\r\nrange from a long distance, indirect machine gun fire from the enemy.\r\nBits of lead, wobbling in their flight at the end of their long\r\ntrajectory, sung through the air above our heads and clipped leaves and\r\ntwigs from the branches. On the edge of the woods we came upon a hastily\r\ndug out pit in which there were two American machine guns and their\r\ncrews.\r\n\r\nThe field in front of the woods sloped gently down some two hundred\r\nyards to another cluster of trees. This cluster was almost as big as the\r\none we were in. Part of it was occupied by the Germans. Our machine\r\ngunners maintained a continual fire into that part held by the enemy.\r\n\r\nFive minutes before five o'clock, the order for the advance reached our\r\npit. It was brought there by a second lieutenant, a platoon commander.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked, looking at the green brassard and\r\nred \"C\" on my left arm.\r\n\r\n\"Looking for the big story,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"If I were you I'd be about forty miles south of this place,\" said the\r\nLieutenant, \"but if you want to see the fun, stick around. We are going\r\nforward in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the last I saw of him until days later, when both of us,\r\nwounded, met in the hospital. Of course, the first thing he said was, \"I\r\ntold you so.\"\r\n\r\nWe hurriedly finished the contents of the can of cold \"Corned Willy\"\r\nwhich one of the machine gunners and I were eating. The machine guns\r\nwere taken down and the barrels, cradles and tripods were handed over to\r\nthe members of the crew whose duties it was to carry them.\r\n\r\nAnd then we went over. There are really no heroics about it. There is no\r\nbugle call, no sword waving, no dramatic enunciation of catchy commands,\r\nno theatricalism--it's just plain get up and go over. And it is done\r\njust the same as one would walk across a peaceful wheat field out in\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\nBut with the appearance of our first line, as it stepped from the\r\nshelter of the woods into the open exposure of the flat field, the woods\r\nopposite began to cackle and rattle with the enemy machine gun fire. Our\r\nmen advanced in open order, ten and twelve feet between men. Sometimes a\r\nsquad would run forward fifty feet and drop. And as its members\r\nflattened on the ground for safety another squad would rise from the\r\nground and make another rush.\r\n\r\nThey gained the woods. Then we could hear shouting. Then we knew that\r\nwork was being done with the bayonet. The machine gun fire continued in\r\nintensity and then died down completely. The wood had been won. Our men\r\nconsolidated the position by moving forward in groups ever on the\r\nwatch-out for snipers in the trees. A number of these were brought down\r\nby our crack pistol shots.\r\n\r\nAt different times during the advance runners had come through the woods\r\ninquiring for Major John Berry, the battalion commander. One of these\r\nrunners attached himself to Lieutenant Hartzell and myself and together\r\nthe three of us located the Major coming through the woods. He granted\r\npermission for Lieutenant Hartzell and me to accompany him and we\r\nstarted forward, in all a party of some fifteen, including ten runners\r\nattached to the battalion commander.\r\n\r\nOwing to the continual evidences of German snipers in the trees, every\r\none in our party carried a revolver ready in his hand, with the\r\nexception of myself. Correspondents, you will remember, are\r\nnon-combatants and must be unarmed. I carried a notebook, but it was\r\nloaded. We made our way down the slope of the wooded hillside.\r\n\r\nMidway down the slope, the hill was bisected by a sunken road which\r\nturned forward on the left. Lying in the road were a number of French\r\nbodies and several of our men who had been brought down but five minutes\r\nbefore. We crossed that road hurriedly knowing that it was covered from\r\nthe left by German machine guns.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the slope there was a V-shaped field. The apex of the V\r\nwas on the left. From left to right the field was some two hundred yards\r\nin width. The point where we came out of the woods was about one hundred\r\nyards from the apex. At that point the field was about one hundred yards\r\nacross. It was perfectly flat and was covered with a young crop of oats\r\nbetween ten and fifteen inches high.\r\n\r\nThis V-shaped oat field was bordered on all sides by dense clusters of\r\ntrees. In the trees on the side opposite the side on which we stood,\r\nwere German machine guns. We could hear them. We could not see them but\r\nwe knew that every leaf and piece of greenery there vibrated from their\r\nfire and the tops of the young oats waved and swayed with the streams of\r\nlead that swept across.\r\n\r\nMajor Berry gave orders for us to follow him at intervals of ten or\r\nfifteen yards. Then he started across the field alone at the head of the\r\nparty. I followed. Behind me came Hartzell. Then the woods about us\r\nbegan to rattle fiercely. It was unusually close range. That lead\r\ntravelled so fast that we could not hear it as it passed. We soon had\r\nvisual demonstration of the hot place we were in when we began to see\r\nthe dust puffs that the bullets kicked up in the dirt around our feet.\r\n\r\nMajor Berry had advanced well beyond the centre of the field when I saw\r\nhim turn toward me and heard him shout:\r\n\r\n\"Get down everybody.\"\r\n\r\nWe all fell on our faces. And then it began to come hot and fast.\r\nPerfectly withering volleys of lead swept the tops of the oats just over\r\nus. For some reason it did not seem to be coming from the trees hardly a\r\nhundred yards in front of us. It was coming from a new direction--from\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nI was busily engaged flattening myself on the ground. Then I heard a\r\nshout in front of me. It came from Major Berry. I lifted my head\r\ncautiously and looked forward. The Major was making an effort to get to\r\nhis feet. With his right hand he was savagely grasping his left wrist.\r\n\r\n\"My hand's gone,\" he shouted. One of the streams of lead from the left\r\nhad found him. A ball had entered his left arm at the elbow, had\r\ntravelled down the side of the bone, tearing away muscles and nerves of\r\nthe forearm and lodging itself in the palm of his hand. His pain was\r\nexcruciating.\r\n\r\n\"Get down. Flatten out, Major,\" I shouted, and he dropped to the ground.\r\nI did not know the extent of his injuries at that time but I did know\r\nthat he was courting death every minute he stood up.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get out of here,\" said the Major. \"We've got to get\r\nforward. They'll start shelling this open field in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nI lifted my head for another cautious look.\r\n\r\nI judged that I was lying about thirty yards from the edge of the trees\r\nin front of us. The Major was about ten yards in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"You are twenty yards from the trees,\" I shouted to the Major. \"I am\r\ncrawling over to you now. Wait until I get there and I'll help you. Then\r\nwe'll get up and make a dash for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied the Major, \"hurry along.\"\r\n\r\nI started forward, keeping as flat on the ground as it was possible to\r\ndo so and at the same time move. As far as was feasible, I pushed\r\nforward by digging in with my toes and elbows extended in front of me.\r\nIt was my object to make as little movement in the oats as possible. I\r\nwas not mistaken about the intensity of fire that swept the field. It\r\nwas terrific.\r\n\r\nAnd then it happened. The lighted end of a cigarette touched me in the\r\nfleshy part of my upper left arm. That was all. It just felt like a\r\nsudden burn and nothing worse. The burned part did not seem to be any\r\nlarger in area than that part which could be burned by the lighted end\r\nof a cigarette.\r\n\r\nAt the time there was no feeling within the arm, that is, no feeling as\r\nto aches or pain. There was nothing to indicate that the bullet, as I\r\nlearned several days later, had gone through the bicep muscle of the\r\nupper arm and had come out on the other side. The only sensation\r\nperceptible at the time was the burning touch at the spot where the\r\nbullet entered.\r\n\r\nI glanced down at the sleeve of my uniformed coat and could not even see\r\nthe hole where the bullet had entered. Neither was there any sudden flow\r\nof blood. At the time there was no stiffness or discomfort in the arm\r\nand I continued to use it to work my way forward.\r\n\r\nThen the second one hit. It nicked the top of my left shoulder. And\r\nagain came the burning sensation, only this time the area affected\r\nseemed larger. Hitting as it did in the meaty cap of the shoulder, I\r\nfeared that there would be no further use for the arm until it had\r\nreceived attention, but again I was surprised when I found upon\r\nexperiment that I could still use it. The bone seemed to be affected in\r\nno way.\r\n\r\nAgain there was no sudden flow of blood, nor stiffness. It seemed hard\r\nfor me to believe at the time, but I had been shot twice, penetrated\r\nthrough by two bullets and was experiencing not any more pain than I had\r\nexperienced once when I dropped a lighted cigarette on the back of my\r\nhand. I am certain that the pain in no way approached that sensation\r\nwhich the dentist provides when he drills into a tooth with a live nerve\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nSo I continued to move toward the Major. Occasionally I would shout\r\nsomething to him, although, at this time, I am unable to remember what\r\nit was. I only wanted to let him know I was coming. I had fears, based\r\non the one look that I had obtained of his pain-distorted face, that he\r\nhad been mortally shot in the body.\r\n\r\nAnd then the third one struck me. In order to keep as close to the\r\nground as possible, I had swung my chin to the right so that I was\r\npushing forward with my left cheek flat against the ground and in order\r\nto accommodate this position of the head, I had moved my steel helmet\r\nover so that it covered part of my face on the right.\r\n\r\nThen there came a crash. It sounded to me like some one had dropped a\r\nglass bottle into a porcelain bathtub. A barrel of whitewash tipped over\r\nand it seemed that everything in the world turned white. That was the\r\nsensation. I did not recognise it because I have often been led to\r\nbelieve and often heard it said that when one receives a blow on the\r\nhead everything turns black.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am contrarily constructed, but in my case everything became pure\r\nwhite. I remember this distinctly because my years of newspaper training\r\nhad been in but one direction--to sense and remember. So it was that,\r\neven without knowing it, my mind was making mental notes on every\r\nimpression that my senses registered.\r\n\r\nI did not know yet where I had been hit or what the bullet had done. I\r\nknew that I was still knowing things. I did not know whether I was alive\r\nor dead but I did know that my mind was still working. I was still\r\nmentally taking notes on every second.\r\n\r\nThe first recess in that note-taking came when I asked myself the\r\nfollowing question:\r\n\r\n\"Am I dead?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't laugh or didn't even smile when I asked myself the question\r\nwithout putting it in words. I wanted to know. And wanting to know, I\r\nundertook to find out. I am not aware now that there was any appreciable\r\npassage of time during this mental progress. I feel certain, however,\r\nthat I never lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nHow was I to find out if I was dead? The shock had lifted my head off\r\nthe ground but I had immediately replaced it as close to the soil as\r\npossible. My twice punctured left arm was lying alongside my body. I\r\ndecided to try and move my fingers on my left hand. I did so and they\r\nmoved. I next moved my left foot. Then I knew I was alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELMET WORN BY FLOYD GIBBONS WHEN WOUNDED, SHOWING DAMAGE\r\nCAUSED BY SHRAPNEL]\r\n\r\nThen I brought my right hand up toward my face and placed it to the left\r\nof my nose. My fingers rested on something soft and wet. I withdrew the\r\nhand and looked at it. It was covered with blood. As I looked at it,\r\nI was not aware that my entire vision was confined to my right eye,\r\nalthough there was considerable pain in the entire left side of my face.\r\n\r\nThis was sufficient to send me on another mental investigation. I closed\r\nmy right eye and--all was dark. My first thought following this\r\nexperiment was that my left eye was closed. So I again counselled with\r\nmyself and tried to open my left eye--that is, tried to give the mental\r\ncommand that would cause the muscles of the left eye to open the lid and\r\nclose it again.\r\n\r\nI did this but could not feel or verify in any way whether the eye lid\r\nresponded or not. I only knew that it remained dark on that side. This\r\nbrought me to another conclusion and not a pessimistic one at that. I\r\nsimply believed, in spite of the pain, that something had struck me in\r\nthe eye and had closed it.\r\n\r\nI did not know then, as I know now, that a bullet striking the ground\r\nimmediately under my left cheek bone, had ricocheted upward, going\r\ncompletely through the left eye and then crashing out through my\r\nforehead, leaving the eyeball and upper eyelid completely halved, the\r\nlower eyelid torn away, and a compound fracture of the skull.\r\n\r\nFurther progress toward the Major was impossible. I must confess that I\r\nbecame so intensely interested in the weird sensations and subjective\r\nresearch, that I even neglected to call out and tell the wounded officer\r\nthat I would not be able to continue to his assistance. I held this view\r\nin spite of the fact that my original intentions were strong. Lying\r\nthere with my left cheek flat on the ground, I was able to observe some\r\nminutes later the wounded Major rise to his feet and in a perfect hail\r\nof lead rush forward and out of my line of vision.\r\n\r\nIt was several days later, in the hospital, that I learned that he\r\nreached the shelter of the woods beyond without being hit again, and in\r\nthat place, although suffering intense pain, was able to shout back\r\norders which resulted in the subsequent wiping out of the machine gun\r\nnest that had been our undoing. For this supreme effort, General\r\nPershing decorated him with the Distinguished Service Cross.\r\n\r\nI began to make plans to get out of the exposed position in which I was\r\nlying. Whereas the field when I started across it had seemed perfectly\r\nflat, now it impressed me as being convex and I was further impressed\r\nwith the belief that I was lying on the very uppermost and most exposed\r\ncurvature of it. There is no doubt that the continued stream of machine\r\ngun lead that swept the field superinduced this belief. I got as close\r\nto the ground as a piece of paper on top of a table. I remember\r\nregretting sincerely that the war had reached the stage of open movement\r\nand one consequence of which was that there wasn't a shell hole anywhere\r\nto crawl into.\r\n\r\nThis did not, however, eliminate the dangerous possibility of shelling.\r\nWith the fatalism that one acquires along the fronts, I was ready to\r\ntake my chances with the casual German shell that one might have\r\nexpected, but I devoted much thought to a consideration of the French\r\nand American artillery some miles behind me. I considered the\r\npossibility of word having been sent back that our advancing waves at\r\nthis point had been cut down by enemy machine gunners who were still in\r\nposition preventing all progress at this place. I knew that such\r\ninformation, if sent back, would immediately be forwarded to our guns\r\nand then a devastating concentration of shells would be directed toward\r\nthe location of the machine gun nests.\r\n\r\nI knew that I was lying one hundred yards from one of those nests and I\r\nknew that I was well within the fatal bursting radius of any shells our\r\ngunners might direct against that German target. My fear was that myself\r\nand other American wounded lying in that field would die by American\r\nguns. That is what would have happened if that information had reached\r\nour artillery and it is what should have happened.\r\n\r\nThe lives of the wounded in that field were as nothing compared with the\r\nimportance of wiping out that machine gun nest on our left which was\r\nholding up the entire advance.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see what time it was and my watch was attached to my left\r\nwrist. In endeavouring to get a look at it, I found out that my left arm\r\nwas stiff and racked with pain. Hartzell, I knew, had a watch, but I did\r\nnot know where he was lying, so I called out.\r\n\r\nHe answered me from some distance away but I could not tell how far or\r\nin what direction. I could see dimly but only at the expense of great\r\npain. When he answered I shouted back to him:\r\n\r\n\"Are you hit?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what time is it?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hit badly?\" he asked in reply.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think so,\" I said. \"I think I'm all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you hit?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the head,\" I said; \"I think something hit my eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the head, you damn fool,\" he shouted louder with just a bit of anger\r\nand surprise in his voice. \"How the hell can you be all right if you are\r\nhit in the head? Are you bleeding much?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"What time is it, will you tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming over to get you,\" shouted Hartzell.\r\n\r\n\"Don't move, you damn fool, you want to kill both of us?\" I hastened to\r\nshout back. \"If you start moving, don't move near me. I think they think\r\nI'm dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well you can't lie there and bleed to death,\" Hartzell replied. \"We've\r\ngot to do something to get to hell out of here. What'll we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what time it is and how long it will be before it's dark,\" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"It's six o'clock now,\" Hartzell said, \"and it won't be dark 'til nine;\r\nthis is June. Do you think you can stick it out?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that I thought I could and we were silent for some time. Both\r\nof us had the feeling that other ears--ears working in conjunction with\r\neyes trained along the barrels of those machine guns a hundred yards on\r\nour left--would be aroused to better marksmanship if we continued to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nI began to take stock of my condition. During my year or more along the\r\nfronts I had been through many hospitals and from my observations in\r\nthose institutions I had cultivated a keen distaste for one thing--gas\r\ngangrene. I had learned from doctors its fatal and horrible results and\r\nI also had learned from them that it was caused by germs which exist in\r\nlarge quantities in any ground that has been under artificial\r\ncultivation for a long period.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of the very field I was lying in and I came to\r\nthe realisation that the wound in the left side of my face and head was\r\nresting flatly on the soil. With my right hand I drew up my British box\r\nrespirator or gas mask and placed this under my head. Thus I rested with\r\nmore confidence, although the machine gun lead continued to pass in\r\nsheets through the tops of the oats not two or three inches above my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAll of it was coming from the left,--coming from the German nests\r\nlocated in the trees at the apex of the V-shaped field. Those guns were\r\nnot a hundred yards away and they seemed to have an inexhaustible supply\r\nof ammunition. Twenty feet away on my left a wounded Marine was lying.\r\nOccasionally I would open my right eye for a painful look in his\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHe was wounded and apparently unconscious. His pack, \"the khaki doll,\"\r\nwas still strapped between his shoulders. Unconsciously he was doing\r\nthat which all wounded men do--that is, to assume the position that is\r\nthe most comfortable. He was trying to roll over on his back.\r\n\r\nBut the pack was on his back and every time he would roll over on this\r\nit would elevate his body into full view of the German gunners. Then a\r\nwithering hail of lead would sweep the field. It so happened that I was\r\nlying immediately in line between those German guns and this unconscious\r\nmoving target. As the Marine would roll over on top of the pack his\r\nchest would be exposed to the fire.\r\n\r\nI could see the buttons fly from his tunic and one of the shoulder\r\nstraps of the back pack part as the sprays of lead struck him. He would\r\nlimply roll off the pack over on his side. I found myself wishing that\r\nhe would lie still, as every movement of his brought those streams of\r\nbullets closer and closer to my head. I even considered the thickness of\r\nthe box respirator on which I had elevated my head off the ground. It\r\nwas about two inches thick.\r\n\r\nI remembered my French gas mask hanging from my shoulder and recalled\r\nimmediately that it was much flatter, being hardly half an inch in\r\nthickness. I forthwith drew up the French mask to my head, extracted the\r\nBritish one and rested my cheek closer to the ground on the French one.\r\nThus, I lowered my head about an inch and a half--an inch and a half\r\nthat represented worlds of satisfaction and some optimism to me.\r\n\r\nSometimes there were lulls in the firing. During those periods of\r\ncomparative quiet, I could hear the occasional moan of other wounded on\r\nthat field. Very few of them cried out and it seemed to me that those\r\nwho did were unconscious when they did it. One man in particular had a\r\nlong, low groan. I could not see him, yet I felt he was lying somewhere\r\nclose to me. In the quiet intervals, his unconscious expression of pain\r\nreminded me of the sound I had once heard made by a calf which had been\r\ntied by a short rope to a tree. The animal had strayed round and round\r\nthe tree until its entanglements in the rope had left it a helpless\r\nprisoner. The groan of that unseen, unconscious wounded American who\r\nlaid near me on the field that evening sounded exactly like the pitiful\r\nbawl of that calf.\r\n\r\nThose three hours were long in passing. With the successive volleys that\r\nswept the field, I sometimes lost hope that I could ever survive it. It\r\nseemed to me that if three German bullets had found me within the space\r\nof fifteen minutes, I could hardly expect to spend three hours without\r\nreceiving the fatal one. With such thoughts on my mind I reopened\r\nconversation with Hartzell.\r\n\r\n\"How's it coming, old man?\" I shouted.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming damn close,\" he said; \"how is it with you? Are you\r\nlosing much blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm all right as far as that goes,\" I replied, \"but I want you to\r\ncommunicate with my wife, if its 'west' for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's her address?\" said Hartzell.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long one,\" I said. \"Are you ready to take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot,\" said Hartzell.\r\n\r\n\"'Mrs. Floyd Gibbons, No. 12 Bis, Rue de la Chevalier de la Barre,\r\nDijon, Côte d'Or, France.'\" I said slowly.\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" said Hartzell, \"say it again.\"\r\n\r\nBack and forth we repeated the address correctly and incorrectly some\r\nten or twelve times until Hartzell informed me that he knew it well\r\nenough to sing it. He also gave me his wife's address. Then just to make\r\nconversation he would shout over, every fifteen minutes, and tell me\r\nthat there was just that much less time that we would have to lie there.\r\n\r\nI thought that hour between seven and eight o'clock dragged the most,\r\nbut the one between eight and nine seemed interminable. The hours were\r\nso long, particularly when we considered that a German machine gun could\r\nfire three hundred shots a minute. Dusk approached slowly. And finally\r\nHartzell called over:\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they can see us now,\" he said; \"let's start to crawl\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way shall we crawl?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Into the woods,\" said Hartzell.\r\n\r\n\"Which woods?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The woods we came out of, you damn fool,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Which direction are they in?\" I said, \"I've been moving around and I\r\ndon't know which way I am heading. Are you on my left, or on my right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell whether I'm on your left or your right,\" he replied. \"How\r\nare you lying, on your face or on your back?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my face,\" I said, \"and your voice sounds like it comes from in back\r\nof me and on the left.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case,\" said Hartzell, \"your head is lying toward the\r\nwrong woods. Work around in a half circle and you'll be facing the right\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\nI did so and then heard Hartzell's voice on my right. I started moving\r\ntoward him. Against my better judgment and expressed wishes, he crawled\r\nout toward me and met me half way. His voice close in front of me\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your head up a little,\" he said, \"I want to see where it hit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it looks very nice,\" I replied, lifting my head. I wanted\r\nto know how it looked myself, so I painfully opened the right eye and\r\nlooked through the oats eighteen inches into Hartzell's face. I saw the\r\nlook of horror on it as he looked into mine.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, after crawling painfully through the interminable\r\nyards of young oats, we reached the edge of the woods and safety.\r\n\r\nThat's how it feels to be shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\"GOOD MORNING, NURSE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness from the loss of blood began to grow on me as Lieutenant\r\nHartzell and I made our way through the deepening shadows of the wooded\r\nhillside in the rear of the field on which I had been shot. In an\r\nupright position of walking the pains in my head seemed to increase. We\r\nstopped for a minute and, neither of us having first aid kits with us, I\r\nresurrected a somewhat soiled silk handkerchief with which Hartzell\r\nbound up my head in a manner that applied supporting pressure over my\r\nleft eye and brought a degree of relief.\r\n\r\nHartzell told me later that I was staggering slightly when we reached a\r\nsmall relief dugout about a mile back of the wood. There a medical corps\r\nman removed the handkerchief and bound my head with a white gauze\r\nbandage. I was anxious to have the wound cleaned but he told me there\r\nwas no water. He said they had been forced to turn it over to the men to\r\ndrink. This seemed to me to be as it should be because my thirst was\r\nterrific, yet there was no water left.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled rearward another half mile and, in the darkness, came upon\r\nthe edge of another wooded area. A considerable number of our wounded\r\nwere lying on stretchers on the ground. The Germans were keeping up a\r\ncontinual fire of shrapnel and high explosive shell in the woods,\r\napparently to prevent the mobilisation of reserves, but the doctors,\r\ntaking care of the wounded, proceeded with their work without notice to\r\nthe whine of the shells passing overhead or the bursting of those that\r\nlanded nearby. They went at their work just as though they were caring\r\nfor injured men on a football field.\r\n\r\nHartzell stretched me out on the ground and soon had a doctor bending\r\nover me. The doctor removed the eye bandage, took one look at what was\r\nbeneath it and then replaced it. I remember this distinctly because at\r\nthe time I made the mental note that the doctor apparently considered my\r\nhead wound beyond anything he could repair. He next turned his attention\r\nto my arm and shoulder. He inserted his scissors into my left sleeve at\r\nthe wrist and ripped it up to the shoulder. He followed this operation\r\nby cutting through my heavy khaki tunic from the shoulder to the collar.\r\nA few more snips of the nickel-plated blades and my shirt and undershirt\r\nwere cut away. He located the three bullet holes, two in the arm and one\r\nacross the top of the shoulder, and bound them up with bandages.\r\n\r\n\"We're awful shy on ambulances,\" he said; \"you will have to lie here a\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that I can walk all right if there is no reason why I\r\nshouldn't,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be in an ambulance,\" said the doctor, \"but if you feel\r\nthat you can make it, you might take a try at it.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Lieutenant Hartzell, he said, \"Keep right with him, and\r\nif he begins to get groggy, make him lie down.\"\r\n\r\nSo Hartzell and I resumed our rearward plodding or staggering. He walked\r\nat my right side and slightly in front of me, holding my right arm over\r\nhis right shoulder and thereby giving me considerable support. We had\r\nnot proceeded far before we heard the racing motor of an automobile\r\ncoming from behind us. An occasional shell was dropping along the road\r\nwe were now on.\r\n\r\nA stick struck my legs from behind in the darkness. And then an\r\napologetic voice said:\r\n\r\n\"Beg your pardon, sir, just feeling along the road for shell holes.\r\nAmbulance right behind me, sir. Would you mind stepping to one side?\r\nCome on, Bill,\" to the driver of the ambulance, \"it looks all clear\r\nthrough here.\"\r\n\r\nThe automobile with the racing motor turned out to be a light ambulance\r\nof a popular Detroit make. Its speeding engine was pure camouflage for\r\nits slow progress. It bubbled and steamed at the radiator cap as it\r\npushed along at almost a snail's pace.\r\n\r\n\"All full?\" Hartzell shouted into the darkness of the driver's seat.\r\n\r\n\"To the brim,\" responded the driver. \"Are you wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I have a wounded man with me,\" said Hartzell. \"He can sit\r\nbeside you on the seat if you have room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get right in,\" said the driver, and Hartzell boosted me into the front\r\nseat. We pushed along slowly, Hartzell walking beside the car and the\r\ndriver's assistant proceeding ahead of us, searching the dark road with\r\nhis cane for new shell craters.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when our wheels would strike in one of these, groans would\r\ncome from the ambulance proper.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy,\" would come a voice through pain-pressed lips; \"for\r\nChrist's sake, do you think you are driving a truck?\"\r\n\r\nI heard the driver tell Hartzell that he had three men with bullet\r\nsplintered legs in the ambulance. Every jolt of the car caused their\r\nbroken bones to jolt and increased the pounding of their wearied nerves\r\nto an extremity of agony. The fourth occupant of the ambulance, he\r\nsaid, had been shot through the lungs.\r\n\r\nSome distance along, there came a knock on the wooden partition behind\r\nmy back,--the partition that separates the driver's seat from the\r\nambulance proper. The car stopped and the driver and Hartzell went to\r\nthe rear door and opened it. The man with the shot through the lungs was\r\nhalf sitting up on his stretcher. He had one hand to his mouth and his\r\nlips, as revealed in the rays of the driver's flashlight, were red wet.\r\n\r\n\"Quick--get me--to a doctor,\" the man said between gulps and gurgles.\r\n\r\nThe driver considered. He knew we were ten miles from the closest doctor.\r\nThen he addressed himself to the other three stretcher-cases--the men\r\nwith the torture-torn legs.\r\n\r\n\"If I go fast, you guys are going to suffer the agonies of hell,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and if I go slow this guy with the hemorrhage will croak before\r\nwe get there. How do you want me to drive?\"\r\n\r\nThere was not a minute's silence. The three broken leg cases responded\r\nalmost in unison.\r\n\r\n\"Go as fast as you can,\" they said.\r\n\r\nAnd we did. With Hartzell riding the running board beside me and the\r\ncrater finder clinging to the mud guards on the other side, we sped\r\nthrough the darkness regardless of the ruts and shell holes. The jolting\r\nwas severe but never once did there come another complaint from the\r\noccupants of the ambulance.\r\n\r\nIn this manner did we arrive in time at the first medical clearing\r\nstation. I learned later that the life of the man with the hemorrhage\r\nwas saved and he is alive to-day.\r\n\r\nThe clearing station was located in an old church on the outskirts of a\r\nlittle village. Four times during this war the flow and ebb of battle\r\nhad passed about this old edifice. Hartzell half carried me off the\r\nambulance seat and into the church. As I felt my feet scrape on the\r\nflagstoned flooring underneath the Gothic entrance arch, I opened my\r\nright eye for a painful survey of the interior.\r\n\r\nThe walls, grey with age, appeared yellow in the light of the candles\r\nand lanterns that were used for illumination. Blankets, and bits of\r\ncanvas and carpet had been tacked over the apertures where once stained\r\nglass windows and huge oaken doors had been. These precautions were\r\nnecessary to prevent the lights from shining outside the building and\r\nbetraying our location to the hospital-loving eyes of German bombing\r\n'planes whose motors we could hear even at that minute, humming in the\r\nblack sky above us.\r\n\r\nOur American wounded were lying on stretchers all over the floor. Near\r\nthe door, where I entered, a number of pews had been pushed to one side\r\nand on these our walking wounded were seated. They were smoking\r\ncigarettes and talking and passing observations on every fresh case that\r\ncame through the door. They all seemed to be looking at me.\r\n\r\nMy appearance must have been sufficient to have shocked them. I was\r\nhatless and my hair was matted with blood. The red-stained bandage\r\naround my forehead and extending down over my left cheek did not hide\r\nthe rest of my face, which was unwashed, and consequently red with fresh\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nOn my left side I was completely bare from the shoulder to the waist\r\nwith the exception of the strips of white-cloth about my arm and\r\nshoulder. My chest was splashed with red from the two body wounds. Such\r\nwas my entrance. I must have looked somewhat grewsome because I\r\nhappened to catch an involuntary shudder as it passed over the face of\r\none of my observers among the walking wounded and I heard him remark to\r\nthe man next to him:\r\n\r\n\"My God, look what they're bringing in.\"\r\n\r\nHartzell placed me on a stretcher on the floor and went for water, which\r\nI sorely needed. I heard some one stop beside my stretcher and bend over\r\nme, while a kindly voice said:\r\n\r\n\"Would you like a cigarette, old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied. He lighted one in his own lips and placed it in my\r\nmouth. I wanted to know my benefactor. I asked him for his name and\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a soldier,\" he said; \"I am a non-combatant, the same as you.\r\nMy name is Slater and I'm from the Y. M. C. A.\"\r\n\r\nThat cigarette tasted mighty good. If you who read this are one of those\r\nwhose contributions to the Y. M. C. A. made that distribution possible,\r\nI wish to herewith express to you my gratefulness and the gratefulness\r\nof the other men who enjoyed your generosity that night.\r\n\r\nIn front of what had been the altar in the church, there had been\r\nerected a rudely constructed operation table. The table was surrounded\r\nwith tall candelabrum of brass and gilded wood. These ornate accessories\r\nhad been removed from the altar for the purpose of providing better\r\nlight for the surgeons who busied themselves about the table in their\r\nlong gowns of white--stained with red.\r\n\r\nI was placed on that table for an examination and I heard a peculiar\r\nconversation going on about me. One doctor said, \"We haven't any more of\r\nit.\" Then another doctor said, \"But I thought we had plenty.\" The first\r\nvoice replied, \"Yes, but we didn't expect so many wounded. We have used\r\nup all we had.\" Then the second voice said, \"Well, we certainly need it\r\nnow. I don't know what we're going to do without it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom their further conversation I learned that the subject under\r\ndiscussion was anti-tetanus serum--the all-important inoculation that\r\nprevents lockjaw and is also an antidote for the germs of gas gangrene.\r\nYou may be sure I became more than mildly interested in the absence of\r\nthis valuable boon, but there was nothing I could say that would help\r\nthe case, so I remained quiet. In several minutes my composure was\r\nrewarded. I heard hurried footsteps across the flagstoned flooring and a\r\nminute later felt a steel needle penetrating my abdomen. Then a cheery\r\nvoice said:\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, now, we've got plenty of it. We've got just piles of\r\nit. The Red Cross just shot it out from Paris in limousines.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the injection Hartzell informed me that the doctors could do\r\nnothing for me at that place and that I was to be moved further to the\r\nrear. He said ambulances were scarce but he had found a place for me in\r\na returning ammunition truck. I was carried out of the church and\r\nsomewhere in the outer darkness was lifted up into the body of the truck\r\nand laid down on some straw in the bottom. There were some fifteen or\r\ntwenty other men lying there beside me.\r\n\r\nThe jolting in this springless vehicle was severe, but its severity was\r\nrelieved in some of our cases by the quieting injections we had\r\nreceived. The effects of these narcotics had worn off in some of the men\r\nand they suffered the worse for it. One of them continually called out\r\nto the truck driver to go slower and make less jolting. To each request\r\nthe driver responded that he was going as slow as he could. As the\r\njolting continued the man with the complaining nerves finally yelled out\r\na new request. He said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you can't make it easier by going slow, then for God's sake\r\nthrow her into high and go as fast as you can. Let's get it over as\r\nquick as we can.\"\r\n\r\nLying on my back in the truck with a raincoat as a pillow, I began to\r\nwonder where we were bound for. I opened my eye once and looked up\r\ntoward the roof of the leafy tunnel which covered the road. Soon we\r\npassed out from beneath the trees bordering the roadside and I could see\r\nthe sky above. The moon was out and there were lots of stars. They gave\r\none something to think about. After all, how insignificant was one\r\nlittle life.\r\n\r\nIn this mood, something in the jolting of the camion brought to my mind\r\nthe metre and words of George Amicks' wistful verses, \"The Camion\r\nCaravan,\" and I repeat it from memory:\r\n\r\n      \"Winding down through sleeping town\r\n      Pale stars of early dawn;\r\n    Like ancient knight with squire by side,\r\n    Driver and helper now we ride--\r\n      The camion caravan.\r\n\r\n      \"In between the rows of trees\r\n      Glare of the mid-day sun;\r\n    Creeping along the highway wide,\r\n    Slowly in long defile, we ride--\r\n      The camion caravan.\r\n\r\n      \"Homeward to _remorque_ and rest,\r\n      Pale stars of early night;\r\n    Through stillness of the eventide,\r\n    Back through the winding town we ride--\r\n      The camion caravan.\"\r\n\r\nSometime during the dark hours of the early morning we stopped in the\r\ncourtyard of a hospital and I was taken into another examination room\r\nilluminated with painfully brilliant lights. I was placed on a table for\r\nan examination, which seemed rather hurried, and then the table was\r\nrolled away some distance down a corridor. I never understood that move\r\nuntil some weeks later when a Lieutenant medical officer told me that it\r\nwas he who had examined me at that place.\r\n\r\n\"You're looking pretty fit, now,\" he said, \"but that night when I saw\r\nyou I ticketed you for the dead pile. You didn't look like you could\r\nlive till morning.\"\r\n\r\nHis statement gave me some satisfaction. There is always joy in fooling\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\nHartzell, who still accompanied me, apparently rescued me from the \"dead\r\npile\" and we started on another motor trip, this time on a stretcher in\r\na large, easier-riding ambulance. In this I arrived shortly after dawn\r\nat the United States Military Base Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine, on the\r\noutskirts of Paris.\r\n\r\nThere were more hurried examinations and soon I was rolled down a\r\ncorridor on a wheeled table, into an elevator that started upward. Then\r\nthe wheeled table raced down another long corridor and I began to feel\r\nthat my journeyings were endless. We stopped finally in a room where I\r\ndistinctly caught the odour of ether. Some one began removing my boots\r\nand clothes. As that some one worked he talked to me.\r\n\r\n\"I know you, Mr. Gibbons,\" he said. \"I'm from Chicago also. I am\r\nSergeant Stephen Hayes. I used to go to Hyde Park High School. We're\r\ngoing to fix you up right away.\"\r\n\r\nI learned from Hayes that I was lying in a room adjoining the operating\r\nchamber and was being prepared for the operating table. Some information\r\nconcerning the extent of my injuries and the purpose of the operation\r\nwould have been comforting and would have relieved the sensation of\r\nutter helpless childishness that I was experiencing.\r\n\r\nI knew I was about to go under the influence of the anesthetic and that\r\nsomething was going to be done to me. I had every confidence that\r\nwhatever was done would be for the best but it was perfectly natural\r\nthat I should be curious about it. Was the operation to be a serious one\r\nor a minor one? Would they have to remove my eye? Would they have to\r\noperate on my skull? How about the arm? Would there be an amputation?\r\nHow about the other eye? Would I ever see again? It must be remembered\r\nthat in spite of all the examinations I had not been informed and\r\nconsequently had no knowledge concerning the extent of my injuries. The\r\nonly information I had received had been included in vague remarks\r\nintended as soothing, such as \"You're all right, old man.\" \"You'll pull\r\nthrough fine.\" \"You're coming along nicely.\" But all of it had seemed\r\ntoo professionally optimistic to satisfy me and my doubts still\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThey were relieved, however, by the pressure of a hand and the sound of\r\na voice. In the words spoken and in the pressure of the hand, there was\r\nhardly anything different from similar hand pressures and similar spoken\r\nphrases that had come to me during the night, yet there was everything\r\ndifferent. This voice and this hand carried supreme confidence. I could\r\nbelieve in both of them. I felt the hand pressure on my right shoulder\r\nand the mild kindly voice said:\r\n\r\n\"Son, I am going to operate on you. I have examined you and you are all\r\nright. You are going to come through fine. Don't worry about anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, very much,\" I said, \"I like your voice. It sounds like my\r\nfather's. Will you tell me your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Major Powers,\" the kindly voice said. \"Now just take it easy, and\r\nI will talk to you again in a couple of hours when you feel better.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker, as I learned later, was Major Charles Powers, of Denver,\r\nColorado, one of the best-known and best-loved surgeons in the West. A\r\nman far advanced in his profession and well advanced in his years, a man\r\nwhose life has not been one of continual health, a man who, upon\r\nAmerica's entry of the war, sacrificed the safety of the beneficial air\r\nrarity of his native Denver to answer the country's call, to go to\r\nFrance at great personal risk to his health--a risk only appreciated by\r\nthose who know him well. It was Major Powers who operated upon the\r\ncompound fracture in my skull that morning.\r\n\r\nMy mental note-taking continued as the anesthetist worked over me with\r\nthe ether. As I began breathing the fumes I remember that my senses were\r\nkeenly making observations on every sensation I experienced. The thought\r\neven went through my mind that it would be rather an unusual thing to\r\nreport completely the impressions of coma. This suggestion became a\r\ndetermination and I became keyed up to everything going on about me.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the young doctor who was administering the\r\nanesthetic interested me unusually. He was very busy and business-like\r\nand although I considered myself an important and most interested party\r\nin the entire proceedings, his conversation ignored me entirely. He not\r\nonly did not talk to me, but he was not even talking about me. As he\r\ncontinued to apply the ether, he kept up a running fire of entirely\r\nextraneous remarks with some other person near the table. I did not\r\nappreciate then, as I do now, that I was only one of very, very many\r\nthat he had anesthetised that morning and the night before, but at the\r\ntime his seeming lack of all interest in me as me, piqued me\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\"Are you feeling my pulse?\" I said. I could not feel his hand on either\r\nof my wrists, but I asked the question principally to inject myself into\r\nthe conversation in some way or other, preferably in some way that would\r\ncall him to account, as I had by this time aroused within me a keen and\r\nhealthy dislike for this busy little worker whom I could not see but who\r\nstood over me and carried on conversations with other people to my utter\r\nand complete exclusion. And all the time he was engaged in feeding me\r\nthe fumes that I knew would soon steal away my senses.\r\n\r\n\"Now, never you mind about your pulse,\" he replied somewhat peevishly.\r\n\"I'm taking care of this.\" It seemed to me from the tone of his voice\r\nthat he implied I was talking about something that was none of my\r\nbusiness and I had the distinct conviction that if the proceedings were\r\nanybody's business, they certainly were mine.\r\n\r\n\"You will pardon me for manifesting a mild interest in what you are\r\ndoing to me,\" I said, \"but you see I know that something is going to be\r\ndone to my right eye and inasmuch as that is the only eye I've got on\r\nthat side, I can't help being concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you just forget it and take deep breaths, and say, Charlie, did\r\nyou see that case over in Ward 62? That was a wonderful case. The bullet\r\nhit the man in the head and they took the lead out of his stomach. He's\r\ngot the bullet on the table beside him now. Talk about bullet\r\neaters--believe me, those Marines sure are.\"\r\n\r\nI hurled myself back into the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take deep breaths if you'll loosen the straps over my chest,\" I\r\nsaid, getting madder each minute. \"How can I take a full breath when\r\nyou've got my lungs strapped down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how's that?\" responded the conversational anesthetist, as he\r\nloosened one of the straps. \"Now, take one breath of fresh air--one\r\ndeep, long breath, now.\"\r\n\r\nI turned my head to one side to escape the fumes from the stifling towel\r\nover my face and made a frenzied gulp for fresh air. As I did so, one\r\nlarge drop of ether fell on the table right in front of my nose and the\r\ndeep long breath I got had very little air in it. I felt I had been\r\ntricked.\r\n\r\n\"You're pretty cute, old timer, aren't you?\" I remarked to the\r\nanesthetist for the purpose of letting him know that I was on to his\r\ngame, but either he didn't hear me, or he was too interested in telling\r\nCharlie about his hopes and ambitions to be sent to the front with a\r\nmedical unit that worked under range of the guns. He returned to a\r\nconsideration of me with the following remark:\r\n\r\n\"All right, he's under now; where's the next one?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell I am,\" I responded hastily, as visions of knives and saws and\r\ngimlets and brain chisels went through my mind. I had no intention or\r\ndesire of being conscious when the carpenters and plumbers started to\r\nwork on me.\r\n\r\nI was completely ignored and the table started moving. We rolled across\r\nthe floor and there commenced a clicking under the back of my head, not\r\nunlike the sound made when the barber lowers or elevates the head-rest\r\non his chair. The table rolled seemingly a long distance down a long\r\ncorridor and then came to the top of a slanting runway.\r\n\r\nAs I started riding the table down the runway I began to see that I was\r\ndescending an inclined tube which seemed to be filled with yellow\r\nvapour. Some distance down, the table slowed up and we came to a stop in\r\nfront of a circular bulkhead in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThere was a door in the centre of the bulkhead and in the centre of the\r\ndoor there was a small wicket window which opened and two grotesquely\r\nsmiling eyes peered out at me. Those eyes inspected me from head to foot\r\nand then, apparently satisfied, they twinkled and the wicket closed with\r\na snap. Then the door opened and out stepped a quaint and curious figure\r\nwith gnarled limbs and arms and a peculiar misshapen head, completely\r\ncovered with a short growth of black hair.\r\n\r\nI laughed outright, laughed hilariously. I recognised the man. The last\r\ntime I had seen him was when he stepped out of a gas tank on the 18th\r\nfloor of an office building in Chicago where I was reclining at the time\r\nin a dentist chair. He was the little gas demon who walked with me\r\nthrough the Elysian fields the last time I had a tooth pulled.\r\n\r\n\"Well you poor little son-of-a-gun,\" I said, by way of greeting. \"What\r\nare you doing way over here in France? I haven't seen you for almost\r\ntwo years, since that day back in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nThe gas demon rolled his head from one side to the other and smiled, but\r\nI can't remember what he said. My mental note-taking concluded about\r\nthere because the next memory I have is of complete darkness, and lying\r\non my back in a cramped position while a horse trampled on my left arm.\r\n\r\n\"Back off of there,\" I shouted, but the animal's hoofs didn't move. The\r\nonly effect my shouting had was to bring a soft hand into my right one,\r\nand a sweet voice close beside me.\r\n\r\n\"You're all right, now,\" said the sweet voice, \"just try to take a\r\nlittle nap and you'll feel better.\"\r\n\r\nThen I knew it was all over, that is, the operation was over, or\r\nsomething was over. Anyhow my mind was working and I was in a position\r\nwhere I wanted to know things again. I recall now, with a smile, that\r\nthe first things that passed through my mind were the threadbare\r\nbromides so often quoted \"Where am I?\" I recall feeling the urge to say\r\nsomething at least original, so I enquired:\r\n\r\n\"What place is this, and will you please tell me what day and time it\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the Military Base Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine just on the\r\noutskirts of Paris, and it is about eleven o'clock in the morning and\r\nto-day is Friday, June the seventh.\"\r\n\r\nThen I went back to sleep with an etherised taste in my mouth like a\r\nmotorman's glove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGROANS, LAUGHS AND SOBS IN THE HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were fourteen wounded American soldiers in my ward--all men from\r\nthe ranks and representing almost as many nationalistic extractions.\r\nThere was an Irishman, a Swede, an Italian, a Jew, a Pole, one man of\r\nGerman parentage, and one man of Russian extraction. All of them had\r\nbeen wounded at the front and all of them now had something nearer and\r\ndearer to them than any traditions that might have been handed down to\r\nthem from a mother country--they had fought and bled and suffered for a\r\nnew country, _their_ new country.\r\n\r\nHere in this ward was the new melting pot of America. Not the melting\r\npot of our great American cities where nationalistic quarters still\r\nexist, but a greater fusion process from which these men had emerged\r\nwith unquestionable Americanism. They are the real and the new\r\nAmericans--born in the hell of battle.\r\n\r\nOne night as we lay there, we heard an automobile racing through a\r\nstreet in this sleepy, warm little _faubourg_ of Paris. The motor was\r\nsounding on its siren a call that was familiar to all of us. It was the\r\nalarm of a night attack from the air. It meant that German planes had\r\ncrossed the front line and were on their way with death and destruction\r\nfor Paris.\r\n\r\nA nurse entered the room and drew the curtains of the tall windows to\r\nkeep from our eyes the flash and the glitter of the shells that soon\r\nbegan to burst in the sky above us as the aerial defences located on the\r\nouter circle of the city began to erect a wall of bursting steel around\r\nthe French capital. We could hear the guns barking close by and\r\noccasionally the louder boom that told us one of the German bombs had\r\nlanded. Particles of shrapnel began falling in the garden beneath the\r\nwindows of our ward and we could hear the rattle of the pieces on the\r\nslate roof of a pavilion there. It is most unpleasant, it goes without\r\nsaying, to lie helpless on one's back and grapple with the realisation\r\nthat directly over your head--right straight above your eyes and\r\nface--is an enemy airplane loaded with bombs. Many of us knew that those\r\nbombs contained, some of them, more than two hundred pounds of melilite\r\nand some of us had witnessed the terrific havoc they wrought when they\r\nlanded on a building. All of us knew, as the world knows, the particular\r\nattraction that hospitals have for German bombs.\r\n\r\nThe aerial bombardment subsided after some ten or fifteen minutes and\r\nsoon we heard the motor racing back through the streets while a musician\r\nin the car sounded on a bugle the \"prologue\" or the signal that the raid\r\nwas over. The invaders had been driven back. All of us in the ward tried\r\nto sleep. But nerves tingled from this more or less uncomfortable\r\nexperience and wounds ached and burned. Sleep was almost out of the\r\nquestion, and in the darkened ward I soon noticed the red glow of\r\ncigarette after cigarette from bed to bed as the men sought to woo\r\nrelief with tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nWe began to discuss a subject very near and very dear to all wounded\r\nmen. That is, what they are going to do as soon as they get out of the\r\nhospital. It is known, of course, that the first consideration usually\r\nis, to return to the front, but in many instances in our ward, this was\r\nentirely out of the question.\r\n\r\nSo it was with Dan Bailey who occupied a bed two beds on my right. His\r\nleft leg was off above the knee. He lost it going over the top at\r\nCantigny.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I'm going to do when I get home,\" he said, \"I am going to\r\nget a job as an instructor in a roller skating rink.\"\r\n\r\nIn a bed on the other side of the ward was a young man with his right\r\narm off. His name was Johnson and he had been a musician. In time of\r\nbattle, musicians lay aside their trombones and cornets and go over the\r\ntop with the men, only they carry stretchers instead of rifles. Johnson\r\nhad done this. Something had exploded quite close to him and his entire\r\nrecollection of the battle was that he had awakened being carried back\r\non his own stretcher.\r\n\r\n\"I know where I can sure get work,\" he said, glancing down at the stump\r\nof his lost arm. \"I am going to sign up as a pitcher with the St. Louis\r\nNationals.\"\r\n\r\nDays later when I looked on Johnson for the first time, I asked him if\r\nhe wasn't Irish, and he said no. Then I asked him where he lost his arm\r\nand he replied, \"At the yoint.\" And then I knew where he came from.\r\n\r\nBut concerning after-the-war occupations, I endeavoured that night to\r\ncontribute something in a similar vein to the general discussion, and I\r\nsuggested the possibility that I might return to give lessons on the\r\nmonocle.\r\n\r\nThe prize prospect, however, was submitted by a man who occupied a bed\r\nfar over in one corner of the room. He was the possessor of a\r\npolysyllabic name--a name sprinkled with k's, s's and z's, with a\r\nscarcity of vowels--a name that we could not pronounce, much less\r\nremember. On account of his size we called him \"Big Boy.\" His was a\r\npeculiar story.\r\n\r\nHe had been captured by three Germans who were marching him back to\r\ntheir line. In telling me the story Big Boy said, \"Mr. Gibbons, I made\r\nup my mind as I walked back with them that I might just as well be dead\r\nas to spend the rest of the war studying German.\"\r\n\r\nSo he had struck the man on the right and the one on the left and had\r\ndowned both of them, but the German in back of him, got him with the\r\nbayonet. A nerve centre in his back was severed by the slash of the\r\nsteel that extended almost from one shoulder to the other, and Big Boy\r\nhad fallen to the ground, his arms and legs powerless. Then the German\r\nwith the bayonet robbed him. Big Boy enumerated the loss to\r\nme,--fifty-three dollars and his girl's picture.\r\n\r\nAlthough paralysed and helpless, there was nothing down in the mouth\r\nabout Big Boy--indeed, he provided most of the fun in the ward. He had\r\nan idea all of his own about what he was going to do after the war and\r\nhe let us know about it that night.\r\n\r\n\"All of you guys have told what you're going to do,\" he said, \"now I'm\r\ngoing to tell you the truth. I'm going back to that little town of mine\r\nin Ohio and go down to the grocery store and sit there on a soap box on\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm going to gather all the little boys in the neighbourhood round\r\nabout me and then I'm going to outlie the G. A. R.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one thing in that ward that nobody could lie about and that\r\nwas the twitches of pain we suffered in the mornings when the old\r\ndressings of the day before were changed and new ones applied.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and his woman assistant who had charge of the surgical\r\ndressings on that corridor would arrive in the ward shortly after\r\nbreakfast. They would be wheeling in front of them a rubber-tired,\r\nwhite-enamelled vehicle on which were piled the jars of antiseptic\r\ngauze and trays of nickel-plated instruments, which both the doctor and\r\nhis assistant would handle with rubber-gloved hands. In our ward that\r\nvehicle was known as the \"Agony Cart,\" and every time it stopped at the\r\nfoot of a bed you would be pretty sure to hear a groan or a stifled wail\r\nin a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWe had various ways of expressing or suppressing the pain. You who have\r\nhad a particularly vicious mustard plaster jerked off that tender spot\r\nin the back, right between the shoulders, have some small conception of\r\nthe delicate sensation that accompanies the removal of old gauze from a\r\nhealing wound.\r\n\r\nSome of the men would grit their teeth and grunt, others would put their\r\nwrists in their mouths and bite themselves during the operation. Some\r\nothers would try to keep talking to the doctor or the nurse while the\r\nordeal was in progress and others would just simply shout. There was\r\nlittle satisfaction to be gained from these expressions of pain because\r\nwhile one man was yelling the other thirteen in the ward were shouting\r\nwith glee and chaffing him, and as soon as his wounds had been redressed\r\nhe would join in the laughs at the expense of those who followed him.\r\n\r\nThere was a Jewish boy in the ward and he had a particularly painful\r\nshell wound in his right leg. He was plucky about the painful treatment\r\nand used to say to the doctor, \"Don't mind me yelling, doc. I can't help\r\nit, but you just keep right on.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew boy's cry of pain as near as I can reproduce it went something\r\nlike this, \"Oy! Oy!! Oy!!! YOY!!! Doctor!\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew boy's clear-toned enunciation of this Yiddish lullaby, as the\r\nrest of the ward called it, brought many a heartless, fiendish laugh\r\nfrom the occupants of the other beds. We almost lost one of our\r\npatients on account of that laugh. He nearly laughed himself to\r\ndeath--in fact.\r\n\r\nThis near victim of uncontrollable risibilities was an Italian boy from\r\nthe East Side of New York. A piece of shrapnel had penetrated one of his\r\nlungs and pleurisy had developed in the other one. It had become\r\nnecessary to operate on one of the lungs and tape it down. The boy had\r\nto do his best to breathe with one lung that was affected by pleurisy.\r\nEvery breath was like the stab of a knife and it was quite natural that\r\nthe patient would be peevish and garrulous. The whole ward called him\r\nthe \"dying Wop.\" But his name was Frank.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jew boy would run the scale with his torture cry, the \"dying\r\nWop\" would be forced to forget his laboured breathing and give vent to\r\nlaughter. These almost fatal laughs sounded something like this:\r\n\r\n\"He! Hee!! Hee!!! (on a rising inflection and then much softer) Oh, Oh,\r\nOh! Stop him, stop him, stop him!\" The \"He-Hee's\" were laughs, but the\r\n\"Oh-oh's\" were excruciating pain.\r\n\r\nFrank grew steadily worse and had to be removed from the ward. Weeks\r\nafterward I went back to see him and found him much thinner and\r\nconsiderably weaker. He occupied a bed on one of the pavilions in the\r\ngarden. He was still breathing out of that one lung and between gasps he\r\ntold me that six men had died in the bed next to him. Then he smiled up\r\nat me with a look in his eyes that seemed to say, \"But they haven't\r\ncroaked the 'dying Wop' yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"This here--hospital stuff----\" Frank told me slowly, and between gasps,\r\n\"is the big fight after all. I know--I am fighting here--against\r\ndeath--and am going to win out, too.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to win out even though it is harder to fight--than\r\nfighting--the Germans--up front. We Italians licked Hell out of them--a\r\nmillion years ago. Old General Cæsar did it and he used to bring them\r\nback to Rome and put 'em in white-wing suits on the streets.\"\r\n\r\nFor all his quaint knowledge of Cæsar's successes against the\r\nprogenitors of Kulturland of to-day, Frank was all American. Here was a\r\nrough-cut young American from the streets of New York's Little Italy.\r\nHere was a man who had almost made the supreme sacrifice. Here was a man\r\nwho, if he did escape death, faced long weakened years ahead. It\r\noccurred to me that I would like to know, that it would be interesting\r\nto know, in what opinion this wounded American soldier, the son of\r\nuneducated immigrant parents, would hold the Chief Executive of the\r\nUnited States, the man he would most likely personify as responsible for\r\nthe events that led up to his being wounded on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" I asked, \"what do you think about the President of the United\r\nStates?\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be considering for a minute, or maybe he was only waiting\r\nto gather sufficient breath to make an answer. He had been lying with\r\nhis eyes directed steadfastly toward the ceiling. Now he turned his face\r\nslowly toward me. His eyes, sunken slightly in their sockets, shone\r\nfeverishly. His pinched, hollow cheeks were still swarthy, but the\r\nbackground of the white pillow made them look wan. Slowly he moistened\r\nhis lips, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Say--say--that guy--that guy's--got hair--on his chest.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the opinion of the \"dying Wop.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Frank's removal from our ward, the rest of us frequently sent\r\nmessages of cheer down to him. These messages were usually carried by a\r\nyoung American woman who had a particular interest in our ward. Not\r\nstrange to say, she had donned a Red Cross nursing uniform on the same\r\nday that most of us arrived in that ward. She was one of the American\r\nwomen who brought us fruit, ice cream, candy and cigarettes. She wrote\r\nletters for us to our mothers. She worked long hours, night and day, for\r\nus. In her absence, one day, the ward went into session and voted her\r\nits guardian angel. Out of modesty, I was forced to answer \"Present\"\r\ninstead of \"Aye\" to the roll-call. The Angel was and is my wife.\r\n\r\nAs Official Ward Angel it was among the wife's duties to handle the\r\nmatter of visitors, of which there were many. It seemed, during those\r\nearly days in June, that every American woman in France dropped whatever\r\nwar work she was doing and rushed to the American hospitals to be of\r\nwhatever service she could. And it was not easy work these women\r\naccomplished. There was very little \"forehead-rubbing\" or \"moving\r\npicture nursing.\" Much of it was tile corridor scrubbing and pan\r\ncleaning. They stopped at no tasks they were called upon to perform.\r\nMany of them worked themselves sick during the long hours of that rush\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSometimes the willingness, eagerness and sympathy of some of the\r\nvisitors produced humourous little incidents in our hospital life.\r\nNearly all of the women entering our ward would stop at the foot of \"Big\r\nBoy's\" bed. They would learn of his paralysed condition from the chart\r\nattached to the foot of the bed. Then they would mournfully shake their\r\nheads and slowly pronounce the words \"Poor boy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd above all things in the world distasteful to Big Boy was that one\r\nexpression \"Poor boy\" because as soon as the kindly intentioned women\r\nwould leave the room, the rest of the ward would take up the \"Poor boy\"\r\nchorus until Big Boy got sick of it. Usually, however, before leaving\r\nthe ward the woman visitor would take from a cluster of flowers on her\r\narm, one large red rose and this she would solemnly deposit on Big Boy's\r\ndefenceless chest.\r\n\r\nBig Boy would smile up to her a look which she would accept and\r\ninterpret as one of deep, undying gratitude. The kindly-intentioned one\r\nsurrounding herself with that benediction that is derived from a sacred\r\nduty well performed, would walk slowly from the room and as the door\r\nwould close behind her, Big Boy's gruff drawling voice would sing out in\r\na call for the orderly.\r\n\r\n\"Dan, remove the funeral decorations,\" he would order.\r\n\r\nDan Sullivan, our orderly, was the busiest man in the hospital. Big Boy\r\nliked to smoke, but, being paralysed, he required assistance. At regular\r\nintervals during the day the ward room door, which was close to Big\r\nBoy's bed, would open slowly and through the gap four or six inches wide\r\nthe rest of the ward would get a glimpse of Dan standing in the opening\r\nwith his arms piled high with pots and utensils, and a cigarette hanging\r\nfrom the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEWS FROM THE STATES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMILING WOUNDED AMERICAN SOLDIERS]\r\n\r\nWith one hand he would extract the cigarette, insert hand and arm\r\nthrough the opening in the door until it hovered above Big Boy's face.\r\nThen the hand would descend and the cigarette would be inserted in Big\r\nBoy's mouth just as you would stick a pin in a pin-cushion. Big Boy\r\nwould lie back comfortably and puff away like a Mississippi steamboat\r\nfor four or five minutes and then the door would open just a crack\r\nagain, the mysterious hand and arm would reach in once more and the\r\ncigarette would be plucked out. That was the way Big Boy got his\r\n\"smokes.\"\r\n\r\nIf Big Boy's voice was gruff, there was still a gruffer voice that used\r\nto come from a man in the corner of the ward to the left of my bed.\r\nDuring the first four or five days I was an inmate of the ward, I was\r\nmost interested in all the voices I heard because I lay in total\r\ndarkness. The bandages extended down from the top of my head to my upper\r\nlip, and I did not know whether or not I ever would see again. I would\r\nlisten carefully to all remarks within ear-shot, whether they be from\r\ndoctors, nurses or patients. I listened in the hope that from them I\r\nmight learn whether or not there was a possibility of my regaining\r\nvision. But all of their remarks with regard to my condition were\r\nambiguous and unsatisfactory. But from this I gained a listening habit\r\nand that was how I became particularly interested in the very gruff\r\nvoice that came from the corner on my left.\r\n\r\nOther patients directing remarks into that corner would address them to\r\na man whom they would call by name \"Red Shannahan.\" I was quick to\r\nconnect the gruff voice and the name \"Red Shannahan,\" and as I had lots\r\nof time and nothing else to do, I built up in my mind's eye a picture of\r\na tall, husky, rough and ready, tough Irishman, with red hair--a man of\r\nwhom it would be conceivable that he had wiped out some two or three\r\nGerman regiments before they got him. To find out more about this\r\ncharacter, I called over to him one day.\r\n\r\n\"Red Shannahan, are you there?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Gibbons, I'm here,\" came the reply, and I was immensely\r\nsurprised because it was not the gruff voice at all. It was the mild,\r\nunchanged voice of a boy, a boy whose tones were still in the upper\r\nregister. The reply seemed almost girlish in comparison with the\r\ngruffer tones of the other patients and I marvelled that the owner of\r\nthis polite, mannerly, high-pitched voice could be known by any such\r\nname as \"Red Shannahan.\" I determined upon further investigation.\r\n\r\n\"Red Shannahan, what work did you do before you became a United States\r\nsoldier?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibbons,\" came the reply, almost girlishly, \"I am from Baltimore. I\r\ndrove the wagon for Mr. Bishop, the canary bird and gold fish man.\"\r\n\r\nAll that had happened to this canary bird fancier and gold fish tamer\r\nwas that he had killed two Germans and captured three before they got\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmong those who came to visit us in that ward, there appeared one day a\r\nman I had not seen in many years. When I knew him last he had been a\r\nsport-loving fellow-student of mine at college and one of the fastest,\r\nhardest-fighting ends our 'Varsity football squad ever had. Knowing this\r\ndisposition of the man, I was quite surprised to see on the sleeve of\r\nhis khaki service uniform the red shield and insignia of the Knights of\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\nI was well aware of the very valuable work done by this institution\r\nwherever American soldiers are in France, but I could not imagine this\r\nformer college chum of mine being engaged in such work instead of being\r\nin the service. He noticed my silence and he said, \"Gib, do you remember\r\nthat game with the Indians on Thanksgiving Day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"they hurt your leg that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied my old college mate, whom we might as well call MacDougal\r\ninasmuch as that was not his name. \"Yes, they took that leg away from me\r\nthree years later.\"\r\n\r\nI knew then why MacDougal was with the K. C. and I wondered what\r\nservice he would perform in our ward in the name of his organisation. I\r\nsoon found out. Without introduction, MacDougal proceeded to the bedside\r\nof Dan Bailey, the Infantryman with one leg off, who was lying in a bed\r\non my right. MacDougal walked back and forth two or three times past the\r\nfoot of Bailey's bed.\r\n\r\n\"How does that look?\" he said to Bailey. \"Do I walk all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks all right to me,\" replied Bailey; \"what's the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nMacDougal then began jumping, skipping and hopping up and down and\r\nacross the floor at the foot of Bailey's bed. Finishing these exercises\r\nbreathlessly, he again addressed himself to the sufferer with one leg.\r\n\r\n\"How did that look?\" he said. \"Did that look all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anything the matter with you,\" replied Bailey, \"unless it\r\nis that you're in the wrong ward.\"\r\n\r\nThen MacDougal stood close by Bailey's bedside where the boy with one\r\nleg could watch him closely. MacDougal took his cane and struck his own\r\nright leg a resounding whack. And we all knew by the sound of the blow\r\nthat the leg he struck was wooden.\r\n\r\nIn that peculiar way did MacDougal bring into the life of Dan Bailey new\r\ninterest and new prospects. He proved to Dan Bailey that for the rest of\r\nhis life Dan Bailey with an artificial limb could walk about and jump\r\nand skip and hop almost as well as people with two good legs. That was\r\nthe service performed by the Knights of Columbus in our ward.\r\n\r\nThere was one other organisation in that hospital that deserves mention.\r\nIt was the most exclusive little clique and rather inclined towards\r\nsnobbishness. I was a member of it. We used to look down on the\r\nordinary wounded cases that had two eyes. We enjoyed, either rightly or\r\nwrongly, a feeling of superiority. Death comes mighty close when it\r\nnicks an eye out of your head. All of the one-eyed cases and some of the\r\nno-eyed cases received attention in one certain ward, and it was to this\r\nward after my release from the hospital that I used to go every day for\r\nfresh dressings for my wounds. Every time I entered the ward a\r\ndelegation of one-eyed would greet me as a comrade and present me with a\r\npetition. In this petition I was asked and urged to betake myself to the\r\nhospital library, to probe the depths of the encyclopædias and from\r\ntheir wordy innards tear out one name for the organisation of the\r\none-eyed. This was to be our life long club, they said, and the\r\ninsistence was that the name above all should be a \"classy\" name. So it\r\ncame to pass that after much research and debate one name was accepted\r\nand from that time on we became known as the Cyclops Club.\r\n\r\nA wonderful Philadelphia surgeon was in charge of the work in that ward.\r\nHundreds of American soldiers for long years after the war will thank\r\nhim for seeing. I thank him for my sight now. His name is Dr. Fewell.\r\nThe greatest excitement in the ward prevailed one day when one of the\r\ndoctor's assistants entered carrying several flat, hard wood cases, each\r\nof them about a yard square. The cases opened like a book and were laid\r\nflat on the table. Their interiors were lined with green velvet and\r\nthere on the shallow receptacles in the green velvet were just dozens of\r\neyes, gleaming unblinkingly up at us.\r\n\r\nA shout went up and down the ward and the Cyclopians gathered around the\r\ntable. There was a grand grab right and left. Everybody tried to get a\r\nhandful. There was some difficulty reassorting the grabs. Of course, it\r\nhappened, that fellows that really needed blue or grey ones, managed to\r\nget hold of black ones or brown ones, and some confusion existed while\r\nthey traded back and forth to match up proper colours, shades and sizes.\r\n\r\nOne Cyclopian was not in on the grab. In addition to having lost one\r\neye, he had received about a pound and a half of assorted hardware in\r\nhis back, and these flesh wounds confined him to his bed. He had been\r\nsleeping and he suddenly awoke during the distribution of the glassware.\r\nHe apparently became alarmed with the thought that he was going to be\r\nleft out of consideration. I saw him sit bolt upright in bed as he\r\nshouted clear across the ward:\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Doc, pass the grapes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became possible for me to leave that hospital, I went to another\r\none three blocks away. This was a remarkable institution that had been\r\nmaintained by wealthy Americans living in France before the war. I was\r\nassigned to a room on the third floor--a room adjoining a sun parlour,\r\noverlooking a beautiful Old World garden with a lagoon, rustic bridges,\r\ntrees and shrubbery.\r\n\r\nIn early June, when that flood of American wounded had come back from\r\nthe Marne, it had become necessary to erect hospital ward tents in the\r\ngarden and there a number of our wounded were cared for. I used to\r\nnotice that every day two orderlies would carry out from one of the\r\nsmall tents a small white cot on which there lay an American soldier.\r\nThey would place the cot on the green grass where the sunlight, finding\r\nits way through the leafy branches of the tree, would shine down upon\r\nthe form of this young--this very young--fighter from the U. S. A.\r\n\r\nHe was just two months over seventeen years of age. He had deliberately\r\nand patriotically lied one year on his age in order that he might go to\r\nFrance and fight beneath our flag.\r\n\r\nHe was wounded, but his appearance did not indicate how badly. There\r\nwere no bandages about his head, arms or body. There was nothing to\r\nsuggest the severity of his injuries--nothing save his small round spot\r\non the side of his head where the surgeons had shaved away the\r\nhair--just a small round spot that marked the place where a piece of\r\nGerman hand-grenade had touched the skull.\r\n\r\nThis little fellow had forgotten everything. He could not remember--all\r\nhad slipped his mind save for the three or four lines of one little\r\nsong, which was the sole remaining memory that bridged the gap of four\r\nthousand miles between him and his home across the sea.\r\n\r\nOver and over again he would sing it all day long as he lay there on the\r\ncot with the sunlight streaming all over him. His sweet boyish voice\r\nwould come up through the leafy branches to the windows of my room.\r\n\r\nI frequently noticed my nurse standing there at the window listening to\r\nhim. Then I would notice that her shoulders would shake convulsively and\r\nshe would walk out of the room, wet eyed but silent. And the song the\r\nlittle fellow sang was this:\r\n\r\n    \"Just try to picture me\r\n    Back home in Tennessee,\r\n    Right by my mother's knee\r\n    She thinks the world of me.\r\n    She will be there to meet me\r\n    With a hug and kiss she'll greet me,\r\n    When I get back, when I get back\r\n    To my home in Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican doctors and American nurses, both by their skill and care and\r\ntenderness, nursed that little fellow back to complete recovery, made\r\nhim remember everything and shortly afterward, well and cured, he\r\nstarted back, safe and sound, to his home in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nNothing I can ever say will overstate my estimation of the credit that\r\nis deserved by our American doctors and nurses for the great work they\r\nare doing. I am not alone in knowing this. I call to witness any\r\nCanadian, Englishman or Frenchman, that, if he is wounded, when in the\r\nambulance, he usually voices one request, \"Take me to an American\r\nhospital.\"\r\n\r\nI knew of one man who entered that United States Military Base Hospital\r\nnear Paris, with one bullet through the shoulder, another through an\r\narm, an eye shot out and a compound fracture of the skull, and those\r\nAmerican doctors and nurses by their attention and skilfulness made it\r\npossible for him to step back into boots and breeches and walk out of\r\nthe hospital in ten days.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that I am somewhat familiar with the details in that case\r\nbecause I am the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\"JULY 18TH\"--THE TURN OF THE TIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the steady growth of Marshal Foch's reserves, by the speedy\r\narrival of American forces, the fourth German offensive of 1918, the\r\npersonally directed effort launched by the Crown Prince on May 27th, had\r\nbeen brought to a standstill.\r\n\r\nThe German thrust toward Paris had been stopped by the Americans at\r\nChâteau-Thierry and in the Bois de Belleau. It would be an injustice not\r\nto record the great part played in that fighting by the French Army\r\nattacked, but it would be equally unjust not to specify as the French\r\nhave gallantly done, that it was the timely arrival of American strength\r\nthat swung the balance against the enemy. For the remainder of that\r\nmonth of June and up to the middle of July, the fighting was considered\r\nlocal in its character.\r\n\r\nThe German offensive had succeeded in pushing forward the enemy front\r\nuntil it formed a loop extending southward from the Aisne to the Valley\r\nof the Marne. This salient was called the Château-Thierry pocket. The\r\nline ran southward from a point east of Soissons to Château-Thierry,\r\nwhere it touched the Marne, thence eastward along both sides of the\r\nriver to the vicinity of Oeuilly where it recrossed the Marne and\r\nextended northward to points beyond Rheims.\r\n\r\nChâteau-Thierry was thus the peak of the German push--the apex of the\r\ntriangle pointing toward Paris. The enemy supplied its forces in this\r\npeak principally by the road that ran southward from Soissons and\r\ntouched the Marne at Château-Thierry. To the west of this road and just\r\nsouth of the city of Soissons, is the forest of Villers-Cotterets. The\r\nenemy occupied the northern and eastern limits of the forest and the\r\nremainder of it was in the hands of the French.\r\n\r\nThis forest has always been considered one of the sentinels of Paris. It\r\nwas located on the right flank of the German salient. It was a menace to\r\nthat flank, and offered a most attractive opportunity for an Allied\r\ncounter offensive from that direction. The Germans were not unmindful of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe enemy knew that in the forest of Villers-Cotterets it would be\r\npossible for Marshal Foch to mobilise his much-feared reserves by taking\r\nadvantage of the natural screen provided by the forest. That Foch\r\nreserve still remained a matter for enemy consideration in spite of the\r\nfact that the successive German offensive since March 21st had met with\r\nconsiderable success with regard to the acquisition of territory. The\r\nGermans, however, had been unable to ascertain whether Foch had been\r\nforced to bring his reserves into the fight.\r\n\r\nThe situation demanded a full realisation by the enemy of the possible\r\nuse of this reserve at any time and they knew that their lines in\r\nVillers-Cotterets Forest offered an ever present invitation for the\r\nsudden application of this reserve strength. Their lines at that point\r\nwere necessarily weak by the superiority of the Allied position and, as\r\na consequence, the Germans guarded this weak spot by holding in reserve\r\nbehind the line a number of divisions of the Prussian Guard.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the enemy maintained constant observation of the\r\nFrench position. Their planes would fly over the forest every day taking\r\nphotographs. They sought to discover any evidences indicating that Foch\r\nmight be preparing to strike a blow from that place. They made careful\r\nnote of the traffic along the roads through the forest. They maintained\r\na careful watch to ascertain whether new ammunition dumps were being\r\nconcealed under the trees. Their observers tried to ascertain whether\r\nany additional hospital arrangements had been made by the French at that\r\npoint. Any of these things would have indicated that the French were\r\npreparing to strike through the forest but the Germans found nothing to\r\nsupport their suspicions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they maintained their lines at maximum strength. A belief\r\nexisted among the German High Command that an attack might be made on\r\nJuly 4th, out of consideration to American sentiment. When the attack\r\ndid not develop on that day, they then thought that the French might\r\npossibly spring the blow on July 14th, in celebration of their own\r\nnational fête day. And again they were disappointed in their surmises.\r\n\r\nThis protracted delay of an impending blow worried the enemy. The\r\nGermans realised full well that they were fighting against time. Their\r\nfaith in the capacity of their submarines to prevent American strength\r\nfrom reaching the line, had been abandoned. They now knew that every day\r\nthat passed meant just that many more American soldiers arriving in\r\nFrance, and the consequent strengthening of the Allied forces during a\r\nseason when the Germans, through their repeated offensives, were\r\nsuffering terrible losses and were consequently growing weaker.\r\n\r\nSo, on July 14th, when the Allied counter-offensive had still failed to\r\nmaterialise, the German forces, by the necessity for time, moved to a\r\nsudden and faulty decision. They convinced themselves that they had\r\noverestimated the Allied strength. They accepted the belief that the\r\nreason Foch had not attacked was because he did not have sufficient\r\nstrength to attack. With this, then, as a basis for their plans, they\r\nimmediately launched another offensive, hoping that this might be the\r\none in which they could deliver the final blow.\r\n\r\nThis action began on Monday morning, July 15th, and extended from\r\nChâteau-Thierry eastward along the valley of the Maine, northward to\r\nRheims and thence eastward. By a remarkable coup, one small patrol of\r\nFrench and Americans deprived the enemy of the element of surprise in\r\nthe attack. On the morning of the previous day, this patrol successfully\r\nraided the enemy lines to the east of Rheims and brought back prisoners\r\nfrom whom it was learned that the Germans intended striking on the\r\nfollowing morning. The objectives of the offensive were the French\r\ncities of Épernay and Châlons. The accomplishment of this effort would\r\nhave placed the Rheims salient in the hands of the enemy and brought the\r\nGerman lines southward to positions straddling the Marne, down the\r\nvalley of which they would thus be able to launch another offensive on a\r\nstraight road to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Germans needed considerable strength for this new effort. To muster\r\nthe shock divisions necessary for the attack, they had to weaken their\r\nlines elsewhere. The first reserves that they drew for this offensive\r\nwere the Prussian Guard divisions which they had been holding in\r\nreadiness in back of the weak spot in their line in the\r\nVillers-Cotterets Forest. Those divisions were hurriedly transported\r\nacross the base of the V-shaped salient and thrown into the attack to\r\nthe east and the southwest of Rheims.\r\n\r\nThe Germans found the Allied line prepared to receive them. Their\r\nattacking waves were mowed down with terrific machine gun fire from\r\nFrench and American gunners, while at the same time heavy artillery\r\nbarrages played upon the German back areas with deadly effect in the\r\nmassed ranks of the reserves. The fighting was particularly vicious. It\r\nwas destined to be the Germans' last action of a grand offensive nature\r\nin the entire war.\r\n\r\nOn the line east of Rheims, the German assault was particularly strong\r\nin one sector where it encountered the sturdy ranks of the Rainbow\r\nDivision of United States National Guardsmen, drawn from a dozen or more\r\ndifferent states in the Union. Regiments from Alabama and New York held\r\nthe front line. Iowa and Ohio were close in support. In the support\r\npositions, sturdy youngsters from Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota\r\nmanned the American artillery.\r\n\r\nThe French general commanding the sector had not considered it possible\r\nthat this comparatively small American force could withstand the first\r\nonslaught of the Germans. He had made elaborate plans for a withdrawal\r\nto high ground two or three miles southward, from which he hoped to be\r\nable to resist the enemy to greater advantage. But all day long, through\r\nthe 15th and the 16th and the 17th of July, those American lines held,\r\nand the advancing waves of German storm troops melted before our guns.\r\nAnticipating a renewal of the attack on the next day, General Gouraud\r\nissued an order on the evening of July 17th. It read:\r\n\r\n\"_To the French and American Soldiers of the Army._\r\n\r\n  \"We may be attacked from one moment to another. You all feel that a\r\n  defensive battle was never engaged in under more favourable\r\n  conditions. We are warned, and we are on our guard. We have\r\n  received strong reinforcements of infantry and artillery. You will\r\n  fight on ground, which, by your assiduous labour, you have\r\n  transformed into a formidable fortress, into a fortress which is\r\n  invincible if the passages are well guarded.\r\n\r\n  \"The bombardment will be terrible. You will endure it without\r\n  weakness. The attack in a cloud of dust and gas will be fierce but\r\n  your positions and your armament are formidable.\r\n\r\n  \"The strong and brave hearts of free men beat in your breast. None\r\n  will look behind, none will give way. Every man will have but one\r\n  thought--'Kill them, kill them in abundance, until they have had\r\n  enough.' And therefore your General tells you it will be a glorious\r\n  day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the line held, although the French General had in preparation the\r\nplans for withdrawal. When, at the end of the third day, the American\r\nline still occupied the same position, the French General found that his\r\nlabour in preparing the plans for withdrawal had been for nothing. He is\r\nreported to have thrown his hands up in the air and remarked, \"There\r\ndoesn't seem to be anything to do but to let the war be fought out where\r\nthe New York Irish and the Alabamans want to fight it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one humorous incident worthy of record in that fighting. Great\r\nrivalry existed between the New York regiment and the Alabama regiment,\r\nboth of which happened to be units of the same brigade. Both the New\r\nYorkers and the Alabamans had a mutual hatred for the German but, in\r\naddition to that, each of them was possessed with a mutual dislike for\r\nthe other. There had been frequent clashes of a more or less\r\nsportsmanlike and fistic nature between men from both of the regiments.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the fighting, the Germans had sent over low-flying\r\nairplanes which skimmed the tops of our trenches and sprayed them with\r\nmachine gun fire. A man from Alabama, who had grown up from childhood\r\nwith a squirrel rifle under his arm, accomplished something that had\r\nnever been done before in the war. From his position in a trench, he\r\ntook careful aim with his rifle and brought down one of the German\r\nplanes. It was the first time in the history of the Western Front that a\r\nrifleman on the ground had done this.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonel of the New York regiment heard this, he was wild with\r\nenvy and let it be known that there would be trouble brewing unless his\r\nregiment at least equalled the feat. So, on the following day, an\r\nIrishman in the ranks stood up and brought one German plane down to the\r\ncredit of the old Sixty-ninth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the southwest of Rheims, Germans, who succeeded in breaking through\r\nthe lines at one place on the south banks of the Marne, encountered\r\nAmerican reinforcements and were annihilated to the number of five\r\nthousand. At no place did the enemy meet with the success desired.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had launched their attack at six o'clock on the morning of\r\nJuly 15th. At Vaux their demonstration was considered a feint, but along\r\nthe Marne to the east of Château-Thierry, between Fossy and Mezy, the\r\nassaulting waves advanced with fury and determination. At one place,\r\ntwenty-five thousand of the enemy crossed the river, and the small\r\nAmerican forces in front of them at that place were forced to retire on\r\nConde-en-Bire. In a counter attack, we succeeded in driving fifteen\r\nthousand of them back to the north bank, the remaining ten thousand\r\nrepresenting casualties with the exception of fifteen hundred, who were\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nFurther eastward, the Germans established bridgehead positions on the\r\nsouth bank of the river at Dormas. The enemy enjoyed a minor success in\r\nan attack on the line near Bligny to the southwest of Rheims, where\r\nItalian troops fought with remarkable valour. Everywhere else the lines\r\nheld solid and upon the close of that first night, Marshal Foch said, \"I\r\nam satisfied--_Je suis content_.\"\r\n\r\nAt dawn the following day, the enemy's futile efforts were resumed along\r\nthe river east of Château-Thierry. The Germans suffered appalling losses\r\nin their efforts to place pontoon bridges at Gland and at\r\nMareuil-le-Port. St. Agnan and La Chapelle Monthodon fell into the hands\r\nof Americans on the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, the enemy's endeavours to reach Festigny on both banks of\r\nthe river came to naught, but to the southeast of Rheims, his assaulting\r\nwaves reached the northern limits of Montagne Forest. The Germans were\r\ntrying to pinch out the Rheims salient. This was the condition of the\r\nopposing lines on the night of July 17th,--the night that preceded the\r\nday on which the tide of victory turned for the Allies.\r\n\r\nFoch was now ready to strike. The Allied Commander-in-Chief had decided\r\nto deliver his blow on the right flank of the German salient. The line\r\nchosen for the Allied assault was located between a point south of\r\nSoissons and Château-Thierry. It represented a front of some twenty-five\r\nmiles extending southward from the valley of the Aisne to the Marne.\r\nVillers-Cotterets Forest was the key position for the Allies.\r\n\r\nIt was from out that forest that the full strength of the blow was to\r\nbe delivered. To make the blow effective at that most vital point,\r\nMarshal Foch needed a strong and dependable assaulting force. He needed\r\nthree divisions of the hardest fighting soldiers that he could get. He\r\nhad a considerable army to select from. As Commander-in-Chief of all the\r\nAllied armies, he was in command of all of the British army, all of the\r\nFrench army, all of the American army, the Italian, the Belgian,--all of\r\nthe military forces of the Allied nations of the world. Marshal Foch's\r\ncommand numbered eleven million bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief had all of these veteran fighting men from which\r\nhe could select the three divisions necessary to deliver this blow upon\r\nwhich the civilisation of the world depended.\r\n\r\nThe first division he chose was the Foreign Legion of the French army.\r\nIn four years of bloody fighting, the Foreign Legion, composed of\r\nsoldiers of fortune from every country in the world, had never been\r\nabsent in an attack. It had lived up thoroughly to its reputation as the\r\nmost fearless unit of shock troops in the French army.\r\n\r\nAnd then for the other two divisions that were needed, Marshal Foch\r\nselected, from all the eleven million men under his command, the First\r\nand the Second Regular United States Army Divisions. The Second Division\r\nincluded the immortal Brigade of United States Marines, that had covered\r\nthemselves with glory in the Bois de Belleau.\r\n\r\nIt was a great distinction for those two American divisions to have thus\r\nbeen selected to play such a vital part in the entire war. It was an\r\nhonour that every officer and man in both divisions felt keenly.\r\n\r\nI have in my map case a torn and much folded little piece of paper. I\r\nreceived it that night of July 17th in Villers-Cotterets Forest. A\r\nsimilar piece of paper was received by every officer in those two\r\nAmerican divisions. To me this piece of paper represents the order which\r\nresulted in victory for the Allied world. It reads:\r\n\r\n _Headquarters Third Army Corps American Expeditionary Forces_,\r\n\r\n              _France, July 17, 1918_\r\n\r\n_Memorandum_:\r\n\r\n  The Third Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces has been\r\n  created and consists of the 1st. and 2nd. Divisions, two divisions\r\n  that are known throughout France.\r\n\r\n  Officers and men of the Third Corps, you have been deemed worthy to\r\n  be placed beside the best veteran French troops. See that you prove\r\n  worthy. Remember that in what is now coming you represent the whole\r\n  American nation.\r\n\r\n                                              R. L. BULLARD,\r\n                                                 Major General,\r\n                                           Commanding 3rd. Corps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German planes flying high over Villers-Cotterets Forest all day\r\nduring the 17th, had seen nothing. The appearance of all the myriad\r\nroads that cross and recross the forest in all directions was normal.\r\nBut that night things began to happen in the forest.\r\n\r\nFor once at least, the elements were favourable to our cause. There was\r\nno moon. The night was very dark and under the trees the blackness\r\nseemed impenetrable. A heavy downpour of rain began and although it\r\nturned most of the roads into mud, the leafy roof of the forest held\r\nmuch of the moisture and offered some protection to the thousands of\r\nmen who spent the night beneath it. Thunder rolled as I had never heard\r\nit roll in France before. The sound drowned the occasional boom of\r\ndistant cannon. At intervals, terrific crashes would be followed by\r\nblinding flashes of lightning as nature's bolts cut jagged crevices in\r\nthe sombre sky and vented their fury upon some splintered giant of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThe immediate front was silent--comparatively silent if one considered\r\nthe din of the belligerent elements. In the opposing front lines in the\r\nnorthern and eastern limits of the forest, German and Frenchmen alike\r\nhuddled in their rude shelters to escape the rain.\r\n\r\nThen, along every road leading through the forest to the north and to\r\nthe east, streams of traffic began to pour. All of it was moving forward\r\ntoward the front. No traffic bound for the rear was permitted. Every\r\ninch of available road space was vitally necessary for the forces in\r\nmovement. The roads that usually accommodated one line of vehicles\r\nmoving forward and one line moving to the rear, now represented two\r\nstreams--solid streams--moving forward. In those streams were gun\r\ncarriages, caissons, limbers, ammunition carts and grunting tractors\r\nhauling large field pieces.\r\n\r\nIn the gutters on either side of the road, long lines of American\r\ninfantry plodded forward through the mud and darkness. In the occasional\r\nflash of a light, I could see that they were equipped for heavy\r\nfighting. Many of them had their coats off, their sleeves rolled up,\r\nwhile beads of sweat stood out on the young faces that shown eager\r\nbeneath the helmets. On their backs they carried, in addition to their\r\ncumbersome packs, extra shoes and extra bandoliers of cartridges.\r\n\r\nFrom their shoulders were suspended gas masks and haversacks. Their\r\nwaists were girded with loaded ammunition belts, with bayonet hanging at\r\nthe left side. Some of them wore grenade aprons full of explosives.\r\nNearly all of them carried their rifles or machine gun parts slung\r\nacross their backs as they leaned forward under their burdens and\r\nplunged wearily on into the mud and darkness, the thunder and lightning,\r\nthe world destiny that was before them. Their lines were interspersed\r\nwith long files of plodding mules dragging small, two-wheeled, narrow\r\ngauge carts loaded down with machine gun ammunition.\r\n\r\nUnder the trees to either side of the road, there was more movement.\r\nAmerican engineers struggled forward through the underbrush carrying, in\r\naddition to their rifles and belts, rolls of barbed wire, steel posts,\r\npicks and shovels and axes and saws. Beside them marched the swarthy,\r\nundersized, bearded veterans of the Foreign Legion. Further still under\r\nthe trees, French cavalry, with their lances slung slantwise across\r\ntheir shoulders, rode their horses in and out between the giant trunks.\r\n\r\nAt road intersections, I saw mighty metal monsters with steel plated\r\nsides splotched with green and brown and red paint. These were the\r\nFrench tanks that were to take part in the attack. They groaned and\r\ngrunted on their grinding gears as they manoeuvred about for safer\r\nprogress. In front of each tank there walked a man who bore suspended\r\nfrom his shoulders on his back, a white towel so that the unseen\r\ndirecting genius in the tank's turret could steer his way through the\r\nunderbrush and crackling saplings that were crushed down under the tread\r\nof this modern Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nThere was no confusion, no outward manifestations of excitement. There\r\nwas no rattle of musketry, shouting of commands or waving of swords.\r\nOfficers addressed their men in whispers. There was order and quiet save\r\nfor the roll of thunder and the eternal dripping of water from the wet\r\nleaves, punctuated now and then by the ear-splitting crashes that\r\nfollowed each nearby flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nThrough it all, everything moved. It was a mighty mobilisation in the\r\ndark. Everything was moving in one direction--forward--all with the same\r\ngoal, all with the same urging, all with the same determination, all\r\nwith the same hope. The forest was ghostly with their forms. It seemed\r\nto me that night in the damp darkness of Villers-Cotterets Forest that\r\nevery tree gave birth to a man for France.\r\n\r\nAll night long the gathering of that sinister synod continued. All night\r\nlong those furtive forces moved through the forest. They passed by every\r\nroad, by every lane, through every avenue of trees. I heard the\r\nwhispered commands of the officers. I heard the sloshing of the mud\r\nunder foot and the occasional muffled curse of some weary marcher who\r\nwould slip to the ground under the weight of his burden; and I knew, all\r\nof us knew, that at the zero hour, 4:35 o'clock in the morning, all hell\r\nwould land on the German line, and these men from the trees would move\r\nforward with the fate of the world in their hands.\r\n\r\nThere was some suspense. We knew that if the Germans had had the\r\nslightest advance knowledge about that mobilisation of Foch's reserves\r\nthat night, they would have responded with a downpour of gas shells,\r\nwhich spreading their poisonous fumes under the wet roof of the forest,\r\nmight have spelt slaughter for 70,000 men.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy never knew. They never even suspected. And at the tick of\r\n4:35 A. M., the heavens seemed to crash asunder, as tons and tons of hot\r\nmetal sailed over the forest, bound for the German line.\r\n\r\nThat mighty artillery eruption came from a concentration of all the guns\r\nof all calibres of all the Allies that Foch could muster. It was a\r\nwithering blast and where it landed in that edge of the forest occupied\r\nby the Germans, the quiet of the dripping black night was suddenly\r\nturned into a roaring inferno of death.\r\n\r\nGiant tree trunks were blown high into the air and splintered into\r\nmatch-wood. Heavy projectiles bearing delayed action fuses, penetrated\r\nthe ground to great depth before exploding and then, with the expansion\r\nof their powerful gases, crushed the enemy dugouts as if they were egg\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThen young America--your sons and your brothers and your husbands,\r\nshoulder to shoulder with the French--went over the top to victory.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary barrage moved forward crashing the forest down about it.\r\nBehind it went the tanks ambling awkwardly but irresistibly over all\r\nobstructions. Those Germans that had not been killed in the first\r\nterrific blast, came up out of their holes only to face French and\r\nAmerican bayonets, and the \"Kamerad\" chorus began at once.\r\n\r\nOur assaulting waves moved forward, never hesitating, never faltering.\r\nAhead of them were the tanks giving special attention to enemy machine\r\ngun nests that manifested stubbornness. We did not have to charge those\r\ndeath-dealing nests that morning as we did in the Bois de Belleau. The\r\ntanks were there to take care of them. One of these would move toward a\r\nnest, flirt around it several minutes and then politely sit on it. It\r\nwould never be heard from thereafter.\r\n\r\nIt was an American whirlwind of fighting fury that swept the Germans in\r\nfront of it early that morning. Aeroplanes had been assigned to hover\r\nover the advance and make reports on all progress. A dense mist hanging\r\nover the forest made it impossible for the aviators to locate the\r\nDivisional Headquarters to which they were supposed to make the reports.\r\nThese dense clouds of vapour obscured the earth from the eyes of the\r\nairmen, but with the rising sun the mists lifted.\r\n\r\nBeing but a month out of the hospital and having spent a rather\r\nstrenuous night, I was receiving medical attention at daybreak in front\r\nof a dressing station not far from the headquarters of Major General\r\nHarbord commanding the Second Division. As I lay there looking up\r\nthrough the trees, I saw a dark speck diving from the sky. Almost\r\nimmediately I could hear the hum of its motors growing momentarily\r\nlouder as it neared the earth. I thought the plane was out of control\r\nand expected to see it crash to the ground near me.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred feet above the tree tops, it flattened its wings and\r\nwent into an easy swoop so that its under-gear seemed barely to skim the\r\nuppermost branches. The machine pursued a course immediately above one\r\nof the roads. Something dropped from it. It was a metal cylinder that\r\nglistened in the rays of the morning sun. Attached to it was a long\r\nstreamer of fluttering white material. It dropped easily to the ground\r\nnearby. I saw an American signalman, who had been following its descent,\r\npick it up. He opened the metal container and extracted the message\r\ncontaining the first aerial observations of the advance of the American\r\nlines. It stated that large numbers of prisoners had been captured and\r\nwere bound for the rear.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this information, Division Headquarters moved forward on\r\nthe jump. Long before noon General Harbord, close behind his advancing\r\ntroops, opened headquarters in the shattered farm buildings of Verte\r\nFeuille, the first community centre that had been taken by our men that\r\nmorning. Prisoners were coming back in droves.\r\n\r\nI encountered one column of disarmed Germans marching four abreast with\r\nthe typical attitude of a \"Kamerad\" procession. The first eight of the\r\nprisoners carried on their shoulders two rudely constructed litters made\r\nfrom logs and blankets. A wounded American was on one litter and a\r\nwounded Frenchman on the other.\r\n\r\nA number of German knapsacks had been used to elevate the shoulders of\r\nboth of the wounded men so that they occupied positions half sitting and\r\nhalf reclining. Both of them were smoking cigarettes and chatting gaily\r\nas they rode high and mighty on the shoulders of their captives, while\r\nbehind them stretched a regal retinue of eight hundred more.\r\n\r\nAs this column proceeded along one side of the road, the rest of the\r\nroadway was filled with men, guns and equipment all moving forward.\r\nScottish troops in kilts swung by and returned the taunts which our men\r\nlaughingly directed at their kilts and bare knees.\r\n\r\nSlightly wounded Americans came back guarding convoys of prisoners. They\r\nreturned loaded with relics of the fighting. It was said that day that\r\nGerman prisoners had explained that in their opinion, the British were\r\nin the war because they hated Germany and that the French were in the\r\nwar because the war was in France, but that Americans seemed to be\r\nfighting to collect souveniers.\r\n\r\nI saw one of these American souvenier collectors bound for the rear. In\r\nstature he was one of the shortest men I had ever seen in our uniform.\r\nHe must have spent long years in the cavalry, because he was frightfully\r\nbowlegged. He was herding in front of him two enormous German prisoners\r\nwho towered head and shoulders above him.\r\n\r\nHe manifested a confidence in his knowledge of all prisoners and things\r\nGerman. Germans were \"foreigners.\" \"Foreigners\" spoke a foreign\r\nlanguage. Therefore to make a German understand you, it was only\r\nnecessary to speak with them in a foreign language. French was a foreign\r\nlanguage so the bowlegged American guard made use of his limited\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Allay! Allay! Allay veet t'ell outer here,\" he urged his charges.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing his helmet back on his head so that there was exposed a\r\nshock of black, blood-matted hair on his forehead. A white bandage ran\r\naround his forehead and on the right side of his face a strip of cotton\r\ngauze connected with another white bandage around his neck. There was a\r\nred stain on the white gauze over the right cheek.\r\n\r\nHis face was rinsed with sweat and very dirty. In one hand he carried a\r\nlarge chunk of the black German war bread--once the property of his two\r\nprisoners. With his disengaged hand he conveyed masses of the food to\r\nhis lips which were circled with a fresco of crumbs.\r\n\r\nHis face was wreathed in a remarkable smile--a smile of satisfaction\r\nthat caused the corners of his mouth to turn upward toward his eyes. I\r\nalso smiled when I made a casual inventory of the battlefield loot with\r\nwhich he had decorated his person. Dangling by straps from his right hip\r\nwere five holsters containing as many German automatic pistols of the\r\nLueger make, worth about $35 apiece. Suspended from his right shoulder\r\nby straps to his left hip, were six pairs of highly prized German field\r\nglasses, worth about $100 apiece. I acquired a better understanding of\r\nhis contagious smile of property possession when I inquired his name and\r\nhis rank. He replied:\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant Harry Silverstein.\"\r\n\r\nLater, attracted by a blast of extraordinary profanity, I approached one\r\nof our men who was seated by the roadside. A bullet had left a red\r\ncrease across his cheek but this was not what had stopped him. The\r\nhobnail sole of his shoe had been torn off and he was trying to fasten\r\nit back on with a combination of straps. His profane denunciations\r\nincluded the U. S. Quartermaster Department, French roads, barbed wire,\r\nhot weather and, occasionally, the Germans.\r\n\r\n\"This sure is a hell of a mess,\" he said, \"for a fellow to find himself\r\nin this fix just when I was beginning to catch sight of 'em. I enlisted\r\nin the army to come to France to kill Germans but I never thought for\r\none minute they'd bring me over here and try to make me run 'em to\r\ndeath. What we need is greyhounds. And as usual the Q. M. fell down\r\nagain. Why, there wasn't a lassoe in our whole company.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prisoners came back so fast that the Intelligence Department was\r\nflooded. The divisional intelligence officer asked me to assist in the\r\ninterrogation of the captives. I questioned some three hundred of them.\r\n\r\nAn American sergeant who spoke excellent German, interrogated. I sat\r\nbehind a small table in a field and the sergeant would call the\r\nprisoners forward one by one. In German he asked one captive what branch\r\nof the service he belonged to. The prisoner wishing to display his\r\nknowledge of English and at the same time give vent to some pride,\r\nreplied in English.\r\n\r\n\"I am of the storm troop,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Storm troop?\" replied the American sergeant, \"do you know what we are?\r\nWe are from Kansas. We are Cycloners.\"\r\n\r\nAnother German student of English among the prisoners was represented in\r\nthe person of a pompous German major, who, in spite of being a captive,\r\nmaintained all the dignity of his rank. He stood proudly erect and held\r\nhis head high. He wore a disgusted look on his face, as though the\r\nsurroundings were painful. His uniform was well pressed, his linen was\r\nclean, his boots were well polished, he was clean shaven. There was not\r\na speck of dust upon him and he did not look like a man who had gone\r\nthrough the hell of battle that morning. The American sergeant asked him\r\nin German to place the contents of his pockets on the table.\r\n\r\n\"I understand English,\" he replied superciliously, with a strong accent,\r\nas he complied with the request. I noticed, however, that he neglected\r\nto divest himself of one certain thing that caught my interest. It was a\r\nleather thong that extended around his neck and disappeared between the\r\nfirst and second buttons of his tunic. Curiosity forced me to reach\r\nacross the table and extract the hidden terminal of that thong. I found\r\nsuspended on it the one thing in all the world that exactly fitted me\r\nand that I wanted. It was a one-eyed field glass. I thanked him.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had once been an interne in a hospital in New York\r\nbut happening to be in Germany at the outbreak of the war, he had\r\nimmediately entered the army and had risen to the rank of a major in the\r\nMedical Corps. I was anxious for his opinion, obvious as it might have\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the fighting capacity of the American soldier?\" I\r\nasked him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" he replied in the accented but dignified tones of a\r\nsuperior who painfully finds himself in the hands of one considered\r\ninferior. \"I have never seen him fight. He is persuasive--yes.\r\n\r\n\"I was in a dugout with forty German wounded in the cellar under the\r\nBeaurepaire Farm, when the terrible bombardment landed. I presume my\r\ngallant comrades defending the position died at their posts, because\r\nsoon the barrage lifted and I walked across the cellar to the bottom of\r\nthe stairs and looked up.\r\n\r\n\"There in the little patch of white light on the level of the ground\r\nabove me, I saw the first American soldier I have seen in the war. But\r\nhe did not impress me much as a soldier. I did not like his carriage or\r\nhis bearing.\r\n\r\n\"He wore his helmet far back on his head. And he did not have his coat\r\non. His collar was not buttoned; it was rolled back and his throat was\r\nbare. His sleeves were rolled up to the elbow. And he had a grenade in\r\neach hand.\r\n\r\n\"Just then he looked down the stairs and saw me--saw me standing\r\nthere--saw me, a major--and he shouted roughly, 'Come out of there, you\r\nbig Dutch B----d, or I'll spill a basketful of these on you.'\"\r\n\r\nAll through that glorious day of the 18th, our lines swept forward\r\nvictoriously. The First Division fought it out on the left, the Foreign\r\nLegion in the centre and the Second Division with the Marines pushed\r\nforward on the right. Village after village fell into our hands. We\r\ncaptured batteries of guns and thousands of prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn through the night the Allied assault continued. Our men fought\r\nwithout water or food. All road space behind the lines was devoted to\r\nthe forwarding of reserves, artillery and munitions. By the morning of\r\nthe 19th, we had so far penetrated the enemy's lines that we had crossed\r\nthe road running southward from Soissons to Château-Thierry, thereby\r\ndisrupting the enemy's communications between his newly established base\r\nand the peak of his salient. Thus exposed to an enveloping movement that\r\nmight have surrounded large numbers, there was nothing left for the\r\nGermans to do but to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe Allied army commander, who directed the Americans on that glorious\r\nday, was General Joseph Mangin. His opinion of the immortal part played\r\non that day by those two American divisions may be seen in the following\r\norder which he caused to be published:\r\n\r\n_Officers, Noncommissioned Officers, and Soldiers of the American Army_:\r\n\r\n  Shoulder to shoulder with your French comrades, you threw yourselves\r\n  into the counter-offensive begun on July 18th. You ran to it as if\r\n  going to a feast. Your magnificent dash upset and surprised the\r\n  enemy, and your indomitable tenacity stopped counter attacks by his\r\n  fresh divisions. You have shown yourselves to be worthy sons of your\r\n  great country and have gained the admiration of your brothers in\r\n  arms.\r\n\r\n  Ninety-one cannon, 7,200 prisoners, immense booty, and ten\r\n  kilometres of reconquered territory are your share of the trophies\r\n  of this victory. Besides this, you have acquired a feeling of your\r\n  superiority over the barbarian enemy against whom the children of\r\n  liberty are fighting. To attack him is to vanquish him.\r\n\r\n  American comrades, I am grateful to you for the blood you generously\r\n  spilled on the soil of my country. I am proud of having commanded\r\n  you during such splendid days and to have fought with you for the\r\n  deliverance of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Germans began backing off the Marne. From that day on, their\r\nmovement to date has continued backward. It began July 18th. Two\r\nAmerican Divisions played glorious parts in the crisis. It was their\r\nday. It was America's day. It was the turn of the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF VICTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe waited hour had come. The forced retreat of the German hordes had\r\nbegun. Hard on their heels, the American lines started their northward\r\npush, backing the Boche off the Marne.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 21st I rode into Château-Thierry with the first\r\nAmerican soldiers to enter the town. The Germans had evacuated\r\nhurriedly. Château-Thierry was reoccupied jointly by our forces and\r\nthose of the French.\r\n\r\nHere was the grave of German hopes. Insolent, imperialistic longings for\r\nthe great prize, Paris, ended here. The dream of the Kultur conquest of\r\nthe world had become a nightmare of horrible realisation that America\r\nwas in the war. Pompously flaunted strategy crumpled at historic\r\nChâteau-Thierry.\r\n\r\nThat day of the occupation, the wrecked city was comparatively quiet.\r\nOnly an occasional German shell--a final parting spite shell--whined\r\ndisconsolately overhead and landed in a cloud of dust and débris in some\r\nvacant ruin that had once been a home.\r\n\r\nFor seven long weeks the enemy had been in occupation of that part of\r\nthe city on the north bank of the river. Now the streets were littered\r\nwith débris. Although the walls of most of the buildings seemed to be in\r\ngood shape, the scene was one of utter devastation.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had built barricades across the streets--particularly the\r\nstreets that led down to the river--because it was those streets that\r\nwere swept with the terrific fire of American machine guns. At the\r\nintersections of those streets the Germans under cover of night had\r\ntaken up the cobblestones and built parapets to protect them from the\r\nhail of lead.\r\n\r\nWrecked furniture was hip deep on the Rue Carnot. Along the north bank\r\nof the river on the Quai de la Poterne and the Promenade de la Levée,\r\nthe invader had left his characteristic mark. Shop after shop had been\r\nlooted of its contents and the fronts of the pretty sidewalk cafés along\r\nthis business thoroughfare had been reduced to shells of their former\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nNot a single living being was in sight as we marched in. Some of the old\r\ntownsfolk and some young children had remained but they were still under\r\ncover. Among these French people who had lived for seven weeks through\r\nthe hell of battle that had raged about the town, was Madame de Prey,\r\nwho was eighty-seven years old. To her, home meant more than life. She\r\nhad spent the time in her cellar, caring for German wounded.\r\n\r\nThe town had been systematically pillaged. The German soldiers had\r\nlooted from the shops much material which they had made up into packages\r\nto be mailed back to home folks in the Fatherland. The church, strangely\r\nenough, was picked out as a depository for their larcenies. Nothing from\r\nthe robes of the priests down to the copper faucet of a water pipe had\r\nescaped their greed.\r\n\r\nThe advancing Americans did not linger in the town--save for small\r\nsquads of engineers that busied themselves with the removal of the\r\nstreet obstructions and the supply organisations that perfected\r\ncommunication for the advancing lines. These Americans were Yankees\r\nall--they comprised the 26th U. S. Division, representing the National\r\nGuard of New England.\r\n\r\nOur lines kept pushing to the north. The Germans continued their\r\nwithdrawal and the Allied necessity was to keep contact with them. This,\r\nthe Yankee Division succeeded in doing. The first obstacle encountered\r\nto the north of Château-Thierry was the stand that the Germans made at\r\nthe town of Epieds.\r\n\r\nOn July 23rd, our infantry had proceeded up a ravine that paralleled the\r\nroad into Epieds. German machine guns placed on the hills about the\r\nvillage, swept them with a terrible fire. Our men succeeded in reaching\r\nthe village, but the Germans responded with such a terrific downpour of\r\nshell that our weakened ranks were forced to withdraw and the Germans\r\nre-entered the town.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we renewed the attack with the advantage of\r\npositions which we had won during the night in the Bois de Trugny and\r\nthe Bois de Châtelet. We advanced from three sides and forced the\r\nGermans to evacuate. Trugny, the small village on the edge of the woods,\r\nwas the scene of more bloody fighting which resulted in our favour.\r\n\r\nFurther north of Epieds, the Germans having entrenched themselves along\r\nthe roadway, had fortified the same with a number of machine guns which\r\ncommanded the flat terrain in such a way as to make a frontal attack by\r\ninfantry waves most costly. The security of the Germans in this position\r\nreceived a severe shock when ten light automobiles, each one mounting\r\none or two machine guns, started up the road toward the enemy, firing as\r\nthey sped. It was something new. The Germans wanted to surrender, but\r\nthe speed of the cars obviated such a possibility. So the enemy fled\r\nbefore our gasoline cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were withdrawing across the river Ourcq, whose valley is\r\nparallel to that of the Marne and just to the north. The enemy's\r\nintentions of making a stand here were frustrated by violent attacks,\r\nwhich succeeded in carrying our forces into positions on the north side\r\nof the Ourcq. These engagements straightened out the Allied line from\r\nthe Ourcq on the west to Fère-en-Tardenois on the east, which had been\r\ntaken the same day by French and American troops.\r\n\r\nBy this time the German withdrawal was becoming speedier. Such strong\r\npressure was maintained by our men against the enemy's rear guards that\r\nhundreds of tons of German ammunition had to be abandoned and fell into\r\nour hands. Still the retreat bore no evidences of a rout.\r\n\r\nThe enemy retired in orderly fashion. He bitterly contested every foot\r\nof ground he was forced to give. The American troops engaged in those\r\nactions had to fight hard for every advance. The German backed out of\r\nthe Marne salient as a Western \"bad man\" would back out of a saloon with\r\nan automatic pistol in each hand.\r\n\r\nThose charges that our men made across the muddy flats of the Ourcq\r\ndeserve a place in the martial history of America. They faced a\r\nveritable hell of machine gun fire. They went through barrages of\r\nshrapnel and high explosive shell. They invaded small forests that the\r\nenemy had flooded with poison gas. No specific objectives were assigned.\r\nThe principal order was \"Up and at 'em\" and this was reinforced by every\r\nman's determination to keep the enemy on the run now that they had been\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nEven the enemy's advantage of high positions north of the river failed\r\nto hold back the men from New York, from Iowa, Alabama, Ohio, Illinois,\r\nMinnesota and Indiana, who had relieved the hard fighting Yankees. These\r\nnew American organisations went up against fresh German divisions that\r\nhad been left behind with orders to hold at all cost. But nothing the\r\nenemy could do could prevent our crossing of the Ourcq.\r\n\r\nOn July 30th the fighting had become most intense in character. The fact\r\nthat the town of Sergy was captured, lost and recaptured nine times\r\nwithin twenty-four hours, is some criterion of the bitterness of the\r\nstruggle. This performance of our men can be better understood when it\r\nis stated that the enemy opposing them there consisted of two fresh\r\ndivisions of the Kaiser's finest--his Prussian Guard.\r\n\r\nAfter that engagement with our forces, the Fourth Prussian Guard\r\nDivision went into an enforced retirement. When our men captured Sergy\r\nthe last time, they did so in sufficient strength to withhold it against\r\nrepeated fierce counter attacks by a Bavarian Guard division that had\r\nreplaced the wearied Prussians.\r\n\r\nBut before the crack Guard Division was withdrawn from the line, it had\r\nsuffered terrible losses at our hands. Several prisoners captured said\r\nthat their company had gone into the fight one hundred and fifty strong\r\nand only seven had survived. That seven were captured by our men in hand\r\nto hand fighting.\r\n\r\nWhile our engineer forces repaired the roads and constructed bridges in\r\nthe wake of our advancing lines, the enemy brought to that part of the\r\nfront new squadrons of air fighters which were sent over our lines for\r\nthe purpose of observation and interference with communications. They\r\ncontinually bombed our supply depots and ammunition dumps.\r\n\r\nAfter the crossing of the Ourcq the American advance reached the next\r\nGerman line of resistance, which rested on two terminal strongholds. One\r\nwas in the Forêt de Nesles and the other was in the Bois de Meunière.\r\n\r\nThe fighting about these two strong points was particularly fierce. In\r\nthe Bois de Meunière and around the town of Cièrges, the German\r\nresistance was most determined. About three hundred Jaegers held Hill\r\n200, which was located in the centre of Cièrges Forest, just to the\r\nsouth of the village of the same name. They were well provided with\r\nmachine guns and ammunition. They were under explicit orders to hold and\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nOur men finally captured the position at the point of the bayonet. Most\r\nof its defenders fought to the death. The capture of the hill was the\r\nsignal for a renewal of our attacks against the seemingly impregnable\r\nMeunière woods. Six times our advancing waves reached the German\r\npositions in the southern edge of the woods and six times we were driven\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThere were some American Indians in the ranks of our units attacking\r\nthere--there were lumber jacks and farmer boys and bookkeepers, and they\r\nmade heroic rushes against terrific barriers of hidden machine guns. But\r\nafter a day of gallant fighting they had been unable to progress.\r\n\r\nOur efforts had by no means been exhausted. The following night our\r\nartillery concentrated on the southern end of the woods and literally\r\nturned it into an inferno with high explosive shells. Early in the\r\nmorning we moved to the attack again. Two of the Kaiser's most reputable\r\ndivisions, the 200th Jaegers and the 216th Reserve, occupied the wood.\r\nThe fighting in the wood was fierce and bloody, but it was more to the\r\nliking of our men than the rushes across fire-swept fields. Our men\r\nwent to work with the bayonet. And for six hours they literally carved\r\ntheir way through four kilometres of the forest. Before ten o'clock the\r\nnext morning, our lines lay to the north of the woods.\r\n\r\nIn consolidating the gains in the woods, our men surrounded in a small\r\nclearing some three hundred of the enemy who refused to surrender.\r\nAmerican squads advanced with the bayonet from all sides. The Germans\r\nwere fighting for their lives. Only three remained to accept the\r\nignominy of capture.\r\n\r\nOur forward progress continued and by August 4th the Germans were\r\nwithdrawing across the Vesle River. The immediate objective that\r\npresented itself to the Americans was the important German supply depot\r\nat Fismes. It was in and around Fismes that some of the bloodiest\r\nfighting in the second battle of the Marne took place. The capture of\r\nFismes was the crowning achievement of one American division that so\r\ndistinguished itself as to be made the subject of a special report to\r\nthe French General Headquarters by the French army in which the\r\nAmericans fought. In part, the report read:\r\n\r\n  \"On Aug. 4th the infantry combats were localized with terrible fury.\r\n  The outskirts of Fismes were solidly held by the Germans, where their\r\n  advance groups were difficult to take. The Americans stormed them and\r\n  reduced them with light mortars and thirty-sevens. They succeeded,\r\n  though not without loss, and at the end of the day, thanks to this\r\n  slow but sure tenacity, they were within one kilometre of Fismes and\r\n  masters of Villes, Savoye and Chezelle Farm. All night long rains\r\n  hindered their movements and rendered their following day's task more\r\n  arduous. On their right the French had, by similar stages, conquered\r\n  a series of woods and swamps of Meunière Woods, to the east of St.\r\n  Gilles, and were on the plateau of Bonne Maison Farm. To the left\r\n  another American unit had been able to advance upon the Vesle to the\r\n  east of St. Thiébault.\r\n\r\n  \"On Aug. 5th the artillery prepared for the attack on Fismes by a\r\n  bombardment, well regulated, and the final assault was launched. The\r\n  Americans penetrated into the village and then began the mean task of\r\n  clearing the last point of resistance. That evening this task was\r\n  almost completed. We held all the northern part of the village as far\r\n  as Rheims road, and patrols were sent into the northern end of the\r\n  village. Some even succeeded in crossing the Vesle, but were satisfied\r\n  with making a reconnaissance, as the Germans still occupied the right\r\n  bank of the river in great strength. All that was left to be\r\n  accomplished was to complete the mopping up of Fismes and the\r\n  strengthening of our positions to withstand an enemy counter attack.\r\n\r\n  \"Such was the advance of one American division, which pushed the enemy\r\n  forward from Roncheres on July 30th a distance of eighteen kilometres\r\n  and crowned its successful advance with the capture of Fismes on Aug.\r\n  5th.\"\r\n\r\nThe German line on the Vesle river fell shortly after the capture of\r\nFismes. The enemy was forced to fall back to his next natural line of\r\ndefence on the Aisne. Between the Vesle and the Aisne, the Americans\r\nassisted the French in the application of such persistent pressure that\r\nthe enemy's stubborn resistance was overcome and in many places he was\r\nforced to withdraw before he had time to destroy his depots of supply.\r\n\r\nOn August 9th, General Degoutte, commanding the Sixth French Army,\r\nissued the following order:\r\n\r\n  \"Before the great offensive of July 18th, the American troops, forming\r\n  part of the 6th French Army, distinguished themselves by clearing the\r\n  'Brigade de Marine' Woods and the village of Vaux of the enemy and\r\n  arresting his offensive on the Marne and at Fossoy.\r\n\r\n  \"Since then they have taken the most glorious part in the second\r\n  battle of the Marne, rivalling the French troops in ardour and valour.\r\n\r\n  \"During twenty days of constant fighting they have freed numerous\r\n  French villages and made, across a difficult country, an advance of\r\n  forty kilometres, which has brought them to the Vesle.\r\n\r\n  \"Their glorious marches are marked by names which will shine in future\r\n  in the military history of the United States: Torcy, Belleau, Plateau\r\n  d'Etrepilly, Epieds, Le Charmel, l'Ourcq, Seringeset Nesles, Sergy, La\r\n  Vesle and Fismes.\r\n\r\n  \"These young divisions, who saw fire for the first time, have shown\r\n  themselves worthy of the old war traditions of the regular army. They\r\n  have had the same burning desire to fight the Boche, the same\r\n  discipline which sees that the order given by their commander is\r\n  always executed, whatever the difficulties to be overcome and the\r\n  sacrifices to be suffered.\r\n\r\n  \"The magnificent results obtained are due to the energy and the skill\r\n  of the commanders, to the bravery of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n  \"I am proud to have commanded such troops.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the month of August and up to the first days of September, the\r\nAmericans participated in the important operations to the north of\r\nSoissons, where on August 29th they played a big part in the capture of\r\nthe Juvigny Plateau.\r\n\r\nIn this fighting, which was marked by the desperate resistance of the\r\nenemy, the Americans were incorporated in the 10th French Army under the\r\ncommand of General Mangin. Violent counter attacks by German shock\r\ndivisions failed to stem the persistent advances of our forces.\r\n\r\nA large hill to the north of Juvigny constituted a key and supporting\r\nposition for the enemy. In spite of the large number of machine guns\r\nconcealed on its slopes, the Americans succeeded in establishing a line\r\nbetween the hill and the town. At the same time the American line\r\nextended itself around the other side of the hill. With the consummation\r\nof this enveloping movement, the hill was taken by assault.\r\n\r\nOn Labor Day, September 2nd, after bitterly engaging four German\r\ndivisions for five days, the Americans advanced their lines to\r\nTerny-Sorny and the road running between Soissons and St. Quentin. This\r\nachievement, which was accomplished by driving the Germans back a depth\r\nof four miles on a two mile front, gave our forces a good position on\r\nthe important plateau running to the north of the Aisne.\r\n\r\nOur observation stations now commanded a view across the valley toward\r\nthe famous Chemin des Dames which at one time had been a part of the\r\nHindenburg line. Before the invasion of the German hordes, France\r\npossessed no fairer countryside than the valley of the Aisne. But the\r\nGermans, retreating, left behind them only wreckage and ashes and ruin.\r\nThe valley spread out before our lines was scarred with the shattered\r\nremains of what had once been peaceful farming communities. To the\r\nnorthwest there could be seen the spires above the city of Laon.\r\n\r\nThe American units which took part in this bitter fighting that had\r\ncontinued without a day's cessation since July 18th, were mentioned\r\nspecifically in an order issued on August 27th by General Pershing. The\r\norder read:\r\n\r\n  \"It fills me with pride to record in general orders a tribute to the\r\n  service achievements of the First and Third Corps, comprising the\r\n  First, Second, Third, Fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-eighth,\r\n  Thirty-second and Forty-second Divisions of the American Expeditionary\r\n  Forces.\r\n\r\n  \"You came to the battlefield at a crucial hour for the Allied cause.\r\n  For almost four years the most formidable army the world has yet seen\r\n  had pressed its invasion of France and stood threatening its capital.\r\n  At no time has that army been more powerful and menacing than when, on\r\n  July 15th, it struck again to destroy in one great battle the brave\r\n  men opposed to it and to enforce its brutal will upon the world and\r\n  civilisation.\r\n\r\n  \"Three days later in conjunction with our Allies you counter-attacked.\r\n  The Allied armies gained a brilliant victory that marks the turning\r\n  point of the war. You did more than to give the Allies the support to\r\n  which, as a nation, our faith was pledged. You proved that our\r\n  altruism, our pacific spirit, and our sense of justice have not\r\n  blunted our virility or our courage.\r\n\r\n  \"You have shown that American initiative and energy are as fit for the\r\n  tasks of war as for the pursuits of peace. You have justly won\r\n  unstinted praise from our Allies and the eternal gratitude of our\r\n  countrymen.\r\n\r\n  \"We have paid for our successes with the lives of many of our brave\r\n  comrades. We shall cherish their memory always and claim for our\r\n  history and literature their bravery, achievement and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  \"This order will be read to all organisations at the first assembly\r\n  formations following its receipt.\r\n\r\n                                                 \"PERSHING.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAugust 10th marked a milestone in the military effort of the United\r\nStates. On that day the organisation was completed of the First American\r\nField Army. I have tried to show in this record how we began the\r\norganisation of our forces overseas. Our first troops to reach France\r\nwere associated in small units with the French. Soon our regiments began\r\nto reach the front under French Division Commanders. Then with the\r\nformation of American divisions, we went into the line under French\r\ncorps commanders. Later still, American corps operated under French Army\r\nCommanders. Finally, our forces augmented by additional divisions and\r\ncorps were organised into the First American Field Army.\r\n\r\nThrough these various stages of development, our forces had grown until\r\non August 10th they had reached the stage where they became practically\r\nas independent an organisation as the British armies under Field Marshal\r\nSir Douglas Haig and the French armies under General Petain. From now on\r\nthe American Army was to be on a par with the French Army and the\r\nBritish Army, all three of them under the sole direction of the Allied\r\nGeneralissimo, Marshal Ferdinand Foch.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of this, the greatest single army that ever fought beneath\r\nthe Stars and Stripes, is reproduced in the appendix. It might not be\r\namiss to point out that an American division numbers thirty thousand\r\nmen and that an American corps consists of six divisions and auxiliary\r\ntroops, such as air squadrons, tank sections, and heavy artillery, which\r\nbring the strength of an American army corps to between 225,000 and\r\n250,000 men. By the 1st of September, the United States of America had\r\nfive such army corps in the field, martialling a strength of about one\r\nand one-half million bayonets. General Pershing was in command of this\r\ngroup of armies which comprised the First American Field Army.\r\n\r\nIt was from these forces that General Pershing selected the strong units\r\nwhich he personally commanded in the first major operation of the First\r\nAmerican Field Army as an independent unit in France. That operation was\r\nthe beginning of the Pershing push toward the Rhine--it was the Battle\r\nof St. Mihiel.\r\n\r\nIt was a great achievement. It signalised the full development of our\r\nforces from small emergency units that had reached the front less than a\r\nyear before, to the now powerful group of armies, fighting under their\r\nown flag, their own generals, and their own staffs.\r\n\r\nThe important material results of the Battle of St. Mihiel are most\r\nsusceptible to civilian as well as military comprehension. The St.\r\nMihiel salient had long constituted a pet threat of the enemy. The\r\nGermans called it a dagger pointed at the heart of eastern France. For\r\nthree years the enemy occupying it had successfully resisted all efforts\r\nof the Allies to oust them.\r\n\r\nThe salient was shaped like a triangle. The apex of the triangle--the\r\npoint of the dagger--thrusting southward, rested on the town of St.\r\nMihiel, on the river Meuse. The western flank of the triangle extended\r\nnorthward from St. Mihiel to points beyond Verdun. The eastern flank of\r\nthe triangle extended in a northeasterly direction toward\r\nPont-à-Mousson. It was the strongest position held by the Germans in\r\nLorraine--if not on the entire front.\r\n\r\nThe geographical formation of the salient was an invitation for the\r\napplication of a pincers operation. The point of leverage of the\r\nopposing jaws of the pincers was, most naturally, the apex of the\r\ntriangle at St. Mihiel.\r\n\r\nOne claw of the pincers--a claw some eight miles thick, bit into the\r\neast side of the salient near Pont-à-Mousson on the west bank of the\r\nMoselle River. The other claw of the pincers was about eight miles thick\r\nand it bit into the western flank of the salient in the vicinity of the\r\nlittle town of Haudiomont, on the heights of the Meuse and just a little\r\ndistance to the east of the Meuse River.\r\n\r\nThe distance across that part of the salient through which the pincer's\r\nclaws were biting was about thirty miles, and the area which would be\r\nincluded in the bite would be almost a hundred and seventy-five square\r\nmiles. This, indeed, was a major operation.\r\n\r\nThe battle began at one o'clock on the morning of September 12th, when\r\nthe concentrated ordnance of the heaviest American artillery in France\r\nopened a preparatory fire of unprecedented intensity.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock in the dim dawn of that September morning, our infantry\r\nwaves leaped from their trenches and moved forward to the assault. The\r\nclaw of the pincers on the eastern flank of the salient began to bite\r\nin.\r\n\r\nOne hour later the claw of the pincers on the western flank of the\r\nsalient began to move forward.\r\n\r\nOn the east, our men went forward on the run over ground that we had\r\nlooked upon with envious eyes from the day that the first American\r\ntroops reached the front. Before noon we had taken the villages of\r\nLahayville, St. Baussant, Vilcey and the Bois de Mortmare and we were\r\nstill advancing. By nightfall, our lines were still on the move beyond\r\nEssey and we were holding the important town of Thiaucourt and claimed\r\nVillers sur Penny for our own.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly impregnable fortress of Mont Sec had been surrounded, our\r\ntanks had cleared the way through Pannes, we had taken Nonsard and the\r\ntowns of Woinville and Buxières had fallen into our hands.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the salient the day had gone equally well for us.\r\nThe western claw of the pincers had pushed due east through the towns of\r\nSpada and Lavigneville. Our men had swept on in the night through\r\nChaillon, we had taken St. Remy and had cleared the Forêt de Montagne.\r\nBy midnight their advanced patrols had reached the western part of the\r\ntown of Vigneulles. In the meantime, our forces on the eastern side of\r\nthe salient were pushing westward toward this same town of Vigneulles.\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning the forces from the east were occupying\r\nthe eastern part of the town. The pincers had closed; the St. Mihiel\r\nsalient had been pinched off.\r\n\r\nOur forces actually met at nine o'clock on the morning of September\r\n13th. The junction was made at the town of Heudicourt to the south of\r\nVigneulles. We had pocketed all of the German forces to the south of\r\nthat town. Our centre had moved forward at nine o'clock the night before\r\nand occupied St. Mihiel on the heels of the retreating Germans. But the\r\nwithdrawal was too late. Large numbers of them found themselves\r\ncompletely surrounded in the forests between St. Mihiel on the south and\r\nHeudicourt on the north.\r\n\r\nWe closed in during the afternoon and started to open the prize\r\npackage. Located in the area, encircled by our troops, was the Bois de\r\nVersel, the Bois de Gaumont and the Bois de Woeuvre. Each one of these\r\nlittle forests gave up its quota of prisoners, while much material and\r\nrich booty of war fell into our hands.\r\n\r\nThe principal avenue that had been opened for the Germans to make a\r\npossible withdrawal led through Vigneulles and before our pincers had\r\ncompletely closed, the fleeing enemy had poured out through that gap at\r\nthe rate of several thousand an hour. The roads were blocked for miles\r\nwith their transportation, and when the American artillery turned its\r\nattention to these thoroughfares, crowded with confused Germans, the\r\nslaughter was terrific. For days after the battle our sanitation squads\r\nwere busy at their grewsome work.\r\n\r\nIn conception and execution the entire operation had been perfect.\r\nConfusion had been visited upon the method-loving enemy from the\r\nbeginning. By reason of the disruption of their intercommunications,\r\nfaulty liaison had resulted and division had called to division in vain\r\nfor assistance, not knowing at the time that all of them were in equally\r\ndesperate straits. The enemy fought hard but to no purpose.\r\n\r\nOne entire regiment with its commander and his staff was captured. With\r\nboth flanks exposed, it had suddenly been confronted by Americans on\r\nfour sides. The surrender was so complete that the German commander\r\nrequested that his roll should be called in order to ascertain the\r\nextent of his losses. When this was done, every one was accounted for\r\nexcept one officer and one private.\r\n\r\nAs his command was so embarrassingly complete, the German commander\r\nasked permission to march it off in whatever direction desired by his\r\ncaptors. The request was granted, and there followed the somewhat\r\namusing spectacle of an entire German regiment, without arms, marching\r\noff the battlefield under their own officers. The captured regiment was\r\nescorted to the rear by mounted American guards, who smilingly and\r\nleisurely rode their horses cowboy fashion as they herded their captives\r\nback to the pens.\r\n\r\nTons upon tons of ammunition fell into our hands in the woods. At one\r\nplace twenty-two railroad cars loaded with large calibre ammunition had\r\nto be abandoned when an American shell had torn up the track to the\r\nnorth of them. But if the Germans had been unable to take with them\r\ntheir equipment, they had succeeded in driving ahead of them on the\r\nretreat almost all of the French male civilians between sixteen and\r\nforty-five years that had been used as German slaves for more than four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were welcomed as deliverers by those French civilians that\r\nremained in the town. They were found to be almost entirely ignorant of\r\nthe most commonly known historical events of the war. Secretary of War\r\nBaker and Generals Pershing and Petain visited the town of St. Mihiel a\r\nfew hours after it was captured. They were honoured with a spontaneous\r\ndemonstration by the girls and aged women, who crowded about them to\r\nexpress thanks and pay homage for deliverance.\r\n\r\nOne of our bands began to play the \"Marseillaise\" and the old French\r\ncivilians who, under German domination, had not heard the national\r\nanthem for four long years, broke down and wept. The mayor of the town\r\ntold how the Germans had robbed it of millions of francs. First they had\r\ndemanded and received one million five hundred thousand francs and later\r\nthey collected five hundred thousand more in three instalments. In\r\naddition to these robberies, they had taken by \"requisition\" all the\r\nfurniture and mattresses and civilian comforts that they could find.\r\nThey took what they wanted and usually destroyed the rest. They had\r\nstripped the towns of all metal utensils, bells, statues, and water\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nThe St. Mihiel salient thus went out of existence. The entire point in\r\nthe blade of the dagger that had been thrust at the heart of France had\r\nbeen bitten off. Verdun with its rows upon rows of sacred dead was now\r\nliberated from the threat of envelopment from the right. The Allies were\r\nin possession of the dominating heights of the Meuse. The railroads\r\nconnecting Commercy with Vigneulles, Thiaucourt and St. Mihiel were in\r\nour hands. Our lines had advanced close to that key of victory, the\r\nBriey iron basin to the north, and the German fortress of Metz lay under\r\nAmerican guns.\r\n\r\nThe battle only lasted twenty-seven hours. In that space of time, a\r\nGerman force estimated at one hundred thousand had been vanquished, if\r\nnot literally cut to pieces, American soldiers had wrested a hundred and\r\nfifty square miles of territory away from the Germans, captured fifteen\r\nthousand officers and men and hundreds of guns. General Pershing on\r\nSeptember 14th made the following report:\r\n\r\n  \"The dash and vigour of our troops, and of the valiant French\r\n  divisions which fought shoulder to shoulder with them, is shown by the\r\n  fact that the forces attacking on both faces of the salient effected a\r\n  junction and secured the result desired within twenty-seven hours.\r\n\r\n  \"Besides liberating more than 150 square miles of territory and taking\r\n  15,000 prisoners, we have captured a mass of material. Over 100 guns\r\n  of all calibres and hundreds of machine guns and trench mortars have\r\n  been taken.\r\n\r\n  \"In spite of the fact that the enemy during his retreat burned large\r\n  stores, a partial examination of the battlefield shows that great\r\n  quantities of ammunition, telegraph material, railroad material,\r\n  rolling stock, clothing, and equipment have been abandoned. Further\r\n  evidence of the haste with which the enemy retreated is found in the\r\n  uninjured bridges which he left behind.\r\n\r\n  \"French pursuit, bombing and reconnaissance units, and British and\r\n  Italian bombing units divided with our own air service the control of\r\n  the air, and contributed materially to the successes of the operation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while this great battle was in progress, the Allied lines were\r\nadvancing everywhere. In Flanders, in Picardy, on the Marne, in\r\nChampagne, in Lorraine, in Alsace, and in the Balkans the frontier of\r\nfreedom was moving forward.\r\n\r\nSurely the tide had turned. And surely it had been America's God-given\r\nopportunity to play the big part she did play. The German was now on the\r\nrun. Suspicious whisperings of peace began to be heard in neutral\r\ncountries. They had a decided German accent. Germany saw defeat staring\r\nher in the face and now, having failed to win in the field, she sought\r\nto win by a bluff at the peace table.\r\n\r\nThe mailed fist having failed, Germany now resorted to cunning. The\r\nmailed fist was now an open palm that itched to press in brotherhood the\r\nhands of the Allies. But it was the same fist that struck down the peace\r\nof the world in 1914. It was the same Germany that had ravished and\r\noutraged Belgium. It was the same Germany that had tried to murder\r\nFrance. It was the same Germany that had covered America with her net of\r\nspies and had sought to bring war to our borders with Mexico and Japan.\r\nIt was the same Germany that had ruthlessly destroyed the lives of women\r\nand children, American citizens, non-combatants, riding the free seas\r\nunder the protection of the Stars and Stripes. It was the same Germany\r\nthat had drugged Russia with her corrupting propaganda and had throttled\r\nthe voice of Russian democracy. This Germany, this unrepentant\r\nGermany--this unpunished Germany, launched her drive for peace.\r\n\r\nGermany was willing to make any concessions to bring about negotiations\r\nthat would save her from a defeat in the field. There was one thing,\r\nhowever, that Germany wanted to save from the ruin she had brought down\r\nupon herself. That thing was the German army and its strong auxiliary,\r\nthe German navy. Neither one of them had been destroyed. The army was in\r\ngeneral retreat and the navy was locked up in the Baltic, but both of\r\nthem remained in existence as menaces to the future peace of the world.\r\nWith these two forces of might, Germany could have given up her booty of\r\nwar, offered reparation for her transgressions and drawn back behind the\r\nRhine to await the coming of another _Der Tag_ when she could send them\r\nonce more crashing across friendly borders and cruising the seven seas\r\non missions of piracy.\r\n\r\nGermany was in the position of a bully, who without provocation and\r\nwithout warning had struck down from behind a man who had not been\r\nprepared to defend himself. The victim's movements had been impeded by a\r\nheavy overcoat. He had been utterly and entirely unprepared for the\r\nonslaught. The bully had struck him with a club and had robbed him.\r\n\r\nThe unprepared man had tried to free himself from the overcoat of\r\npacifism that he had worn so long in safety and in kindliness to his\r\nfellows. The bully, taking advantage of his handicap, had beaten him\r\nbrutally. At last the unprepared man had freed himself from the\r\novercoat and then stood ready not only to defend himself, but to\r\nadminister deserved punishment. Then the bully had said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, wait just a minute. Let's talk this thing over and see if we can't\r\nsettle it before I get hurt.\"\r\n\r\nThe bully's pockets bulge with the loot he has taken from the man. The\r\nvictim's face and head are swollen and bloody and yet the bully invites\r\nhim to sit down to a table to discuss the hold-up, the assault, and the\r\nterms of which the loot and the loot only will be returned. The bully\r\ntakes it for granted that he is to go unpunished and, more important\r\nstill, is to retain the club that he might decide to use again.\r\n\r\nThe rule of common sense that deals with individuals should be the same\r\nrule that applies to the affairs of nations. No municipal law anywhere\r\nin the world gives countenance to a compromise with a criminal.\r\nInternational law could be no less moral than municipal law. Prussian\r\nmilitarism made the world unsafe for Democracy, and for that reason, on\r\nApril 6th, 1917, the United States entered the war.\r\n\r\nWe wanted a decent world in which to live. And the existence of the\r\nPrussian army and its conscienceless masters was incompatible with the\r\nfree and peaceful life of the world. We entered the war for an ideal.\r\nThat ideal was in the balance when Germany made her 1918 drive for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nOur army in France knew that if peace came with an unwhipped Prussian\r\narmy in existence, the world would be just as unsafe for Democracy as it\r\nhad ever been. Our army in France wanted no compromise that would leave\r\nGermany in possession of the instruments that had made possible her\r\ncrimes against the world. Every man that had shed blood, every man that\r\nhad paid the final price, every woman that had shed tears, every\r\ncherished ideal of our one hundred and forty years of national life,\r\nwould have been sacrificed in vain, if we had condoned Germany's high\r\ncrimes against civilisation and had made a compromise with the criminal.\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson, President of the United States, spokesman of the Allied\r\nworld, sounded the true American note when, in his reply to the\r\ninsincere German peace proposals, he referred the German Government to\r\nMarshal Foch, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies. War by the sword\r\nwas to bring peace by the sword.\r\n\r\nAnd as I write these lines in the last days of October, 1918,\r\nunconditional surrender is the song of the dove of peace perched on our\r\nbayonets as we march into the dawn of victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL OF THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =1ST ARMY CORPS=\r\n\r\nMajor Gen.
