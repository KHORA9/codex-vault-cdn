Ickes, Secretary_\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PARK SERVICE\r\n\r\n_Arno B. Cammerer, Director_\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES\r\n  GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\r\n  WASHINGTON: 1937\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nBriefed\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Park Regulations are designed for the protection of the natural\r\nbeauties as well as for the comfort and convenience of visitors. The\r\ncomplete regulations may be seen at the office of the superintendent\r\nand at ranger stations. The following synopsis of the rules and\r\nregulations is for the general guidance of visitors, who are requested\r\nto assist in the administration of the park by observing them.\r\n\r\n=_Fires._=--Fires are the greatest menace to the forests of Glacier\r\nNational Park. Build camp fires only when necessary and at designated\r\nplaces. Know that they are out before you leave them. Be sure your\r\ncigarette, cigar, pipe ashes, and matches are out before you throw them\r\naway. During periods of high fire hazard, camp fires are not permitted\r\nat nondesignated camp grounds.\r\n\r\n=_Camps._=--Camping is restricted to designated campgrounds. Burn all\r\ncombustible garbage in your camp fire; place tin cans and unburnable\r\nresidue in garbage cans. There is plenty of pure water; be sure to get\r\nit. Visitors must not contaminate water-sheds or water supplies.\r\n\r\n=_Natural features._=--The destruction, injury, or disturbance in any\r\nway of the trees, flowers, birds, or animals is prohibited. Dead and\r\nfallen wood may be used for firewood. Picking wild flowers and removing\r\nplants are prohibited.\r\n\r\n=_Bears._=--It is prohibited and dangerous to feed the bears. Do not\r\nleave foodstuffs in an unattended car or camp, for the bear will break\r\ninto and damage your car or camp equipment to secure food. Suspend\r\nfoodstuffs in a box, well out of their reach, or place in the care of\r\nthe camp tender.\r\n\r\n=_Dogs and cats._=--When in the park, dogs and cats must be kept under\r\nleash, crated, or under restrictive control of the owner at all times.\r\n\r\n=_Fishing._=--No license for fishing in the park is required. Use of\r\nlive bait is prohibited. Ten fish (none under 6 inches) per day, per\r\nperson fishing is the usual limit; however, in some lakes the limit is\r\n5 fish per day and in others it is 20. Visitors should contact the\r\nnearest district ranger to ascertain the fish limits in the lakes. The\r\npossession of more than 2 days' catch by any person at any one time\r\nshall be construed as a violation of the regulations.\r\n\r\n=_Traffic._=--Speed regulations: 15 miles per hour on sharp curves and\r\nthrough residential districts; 35 miles per hour on the straightaway.\r\nKeep gears enmeshed and out of free wheeling on long grades. Keep\r\ncutout closed. Drive carefully at all times. Secure automobile permit,\r\nfee $1.\r\n\r\n=_Rangers._=--The rangers are here to assist and advise you as well as\r\nto enforce the regulations. When in doubt consult a ranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST FIRES\r\n\r\n\r\nForest Fires are a terrible and ever-present menace. There are\r\nthousands of acres of burned forests in Glacier National Park. Most of\r\nthese \"ghosts of forests\" are hideous proofs of some person's criminal\r\ncarelessness or ignorance.\r\n\r\nBuild camp fires only at designated camp sites. At times of high\r\nwinds or exceptionally dry spell, build no fires outside, except in\r\nstoves provided at the free auto camps. At times of extreme hazard,\r\nit is necessary to restrict smoking to hotel and camp areas. Guests\r\nentering the park are so informed, and prohibitory notices are posted\r\neverywhere. Smoking on the highway, on trails, and elsewhere in the\r\npark is forbidden at such times. During the dry period, permits to\r\nbuild fires at any camp sites other than in auto camps must be procured\r\nin advance from the district ranger.\r\n\r\nBe absolutely sure that your camp fire is extinguished before you leave\r\nit, even for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nDo not rely upon dirt thrown on it for complete extinction.\r\n\r\n_Drown_ it completely with water.\r\n\r\nDrop that lighted cigar or cigarette on the trail and step on it.\r\n\r\nDo the same with every match that is lighted.\r\n\r\n_Extreme caution is demanded at all times._\r\n\r\nAnyone responsible for a forest fire will be prosecuted to the full\r\nextent of the law.\r\n\r\n_If you discover a forest fire, report it to the nearest ranger\r\nstation or hotel._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents OF HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of a territory so vast it was measured not in miles but\r\ndegrees, the site of Glacier National Park was indicated as terra\r\nincognita or unexplored on most maps even as late as the dawn of the\r\npresent century. To its mountain fastness had come first the solitary\r\nfur trader, the trapper, and the missionary; after them followed the\r\nhunter, the pioneer, and the explorer; in the nineties were drawn the\r\nprospector, the miner, and the picturesque trader of our last frontier;\r\ntoday, the region beckons the scientist, the lover of the out-of-doors,\r\nand the searcher for beauty. Throughout its days, beginning with the\r\nLewis and Clark Expedition, the Glacier country has been a lodestone\r\nfor the scientist, attracted from every corner of the earth by\r\nthe combination of natural wonder and beauty to be found here.\r\nA chronological list of important events in the park's history\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n --------+-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n 1804-5  | Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Nestled\r\namong the higher peaks are more than 60 glaciers and 200 beautiful\r\nlakes. During the summer months it is possible to visit most of the\r\nglaciers and many of the lakes with relatively little difficulty.\r\nHorseback and foot trails penetrate almost all sections of the park.\r\nConveniently located trail camps, operated at a reasonable cost, make\r\nit possible for visitors to enjoy the mountain scenery without having\r\nto carry food and camping equipment. Many travelers hike or ride\r\nthrough the mountains for days at a time, resting each evening at one\r\nof these high mountain camps. The glaciers found in the park are among\r\nthe few in the United States which are easily accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL PEACE PARK\r\n\r\nThe Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park was established in 1932\r\nby Presidential proclamation, as authorized by the Congress of the\r\nUnited States and the Canadian Parliament.\r\n\r\nAt the dedication exercises in June of that year, the following message\r\nfrom the President of the United States was read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The dedication of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park\r\n    is a further gesture of the good will that has so long blessed\r\n    our relations with our Canadian neighbors, and I am gratified by\r\n    the hope and the faith that it will forever be an appropriate\r\n    symbol of permanent peace and friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the administration of these areas each component part of the Peace\r\nPark retains its nationality and individuality and functions as it did\r\nbefore the union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright, Hileman._ WATERTON LAKE--THE INTERNATIONAL\r\nPEACE LAKE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO REACH GLACIER PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nBY RAIL\r\n\r\nThe park entrances are on the main transcontinental line of the Great\r\nNorthern Railway. Glacier Park Station, Mont., the eastern entrance, is\r\n1,081 miles west of St. Paul, a ride of 30 hours. Belton, Mont., the\r\nwestern entrance, is 637 miles east of Seattle, a ride of 20 hours.\r\n\r\nFor information regarding railroad fares, service, etc., apply to\r\nrailroad ticket agents or address A. J. Dickinson, passenger-traffic\r\nmanager, Great Northern Railway, St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\nA regular bus schedule is maintained by the Glacier Park Transport Co.\r\nto accommodate persons arriving by rail.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nGlacier National Park may be reached by motorists over a number of\r\nwell-marked automobile roads. The park approach roads connect with\r\nseveral transcontinental highways. From both the east and west sides\r\nautomobile roads run north and connect with the road system in Canada,\r\nand motorists may continue over these roads to the Canadian national\r\nparks. Glacier National Park is the western terminus of the Custer\r\nBattlefield Highway.\r\n\r\nA fee of $1 is charged for a permit to operate an automobile in Glacier\r\nPark. This permit allows reentry into the park at any time during the\r\ncurrent season. Maximum speed limit in the park is 30 miles per hour.\r\nOn mountain climbs and winding roads, utmost care in driving is\r\ndemanded. All cautionary signs must be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY AIRPLANE\r\n\r\nFast de luxe airplane service is available by Northwest Airlines to\r\nMissoula, Mont., and Spokane, Wash., as is transportation via United\r\nAir Lines, from the east and west coasts to Spokane. National Park\r\nAirlines has a service from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Great Falls, Mont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTERS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIER PARK STATION\r\n\r\nGlacier Park on the Great Northern Railway is the eastern entrance to\r\nthe park. It is located on the Great Plains, near the base of Glacier's\r\nRockies. It is on U S 2, which traverses from the east through northern\r\nMontana along the southern boundary of the park to Belton, the western\r\nentrance, and on to the Pacific coast. Glacier Park is also the southern\r\nterminus of the Blackfeet Highway which parallels the eastern boundary\r\nof the park and connects with the Alberta highway system. It is the\r\nsouthern end of the Inside Trail to Two Medicine, Cutbank, Red Eagle,\r\nand Sun Camp.\r\n\r\nThe commodious Glacier Park Hotel, several lesser hotels, auto camps,\r\nstores, an auxiliary park office, a Government fish hatchery, a post\r\noffice and other structures are located here. The village gives a\r\nfine touch of western life, with Indians, cowboys, and picturesque\r\ncharacters contributing to its color. An encampment of Blackfeet is\r\non Midvale Creek; these Indians sing, dance, and tell stories every\r\nevening at the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTwo Medicine presents a turquoise mountain lake surrounded by majestic\r\nforest-covered peaks separated by deep glaciated valleys. A road leads\r\ninto it from the Blackfeet Highway and ends at the chalets near the\r\nfoot of Two Medicine Lake. Across the water rises Sinopah Mountain,\r\nwhile to the north sweep upward the gray-green slopes of Rising Wolf\r\nto terminate in purple-red argillites and snow banks. One of the most\r\ninviting camp sites of the park is immediately below the outlet of the\r\nlake, not far from the chalets. From it, one looks across a smaller\r\nlake, banked with gnarled and twisted limber pines, to the superb\r\nmountain scenery in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe cirques and broad mountain valleys above timberline are studded\r\nwith cobalt blue lakes, and carpeted with multicolored beds of flowers.\r\nMountain goats and sheep are frequently seen in these higher regions.\r\nBeaver colonies are located at the outlet of Two Medicine Lake and\r\nelsewhere around it, making this one of the best regions in the park\r\nto study these interesting mammals. An abundance of brook and rainbow\r\ntrout in Two Medicine waters makes it a favorite spot for fishermen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Hileman._ TRICK FALLS IN TWO MEDICINE CREEK]\r\n\r\nA campfire entertainment with a short popular talk is conducted every\r\nevening in the campfire circle of the auto camp by a resident ranger\r\nnaturalist. Both chalet and campground guests avail themselves of the\r\nopportunity to meet for pleasure and instruction under the stars.\r\nTrails for hikers and saddle-horse parties radiate to adjacent points\r\nof interest: to Glacier Park via Scenic Point and Mount Henry, to Upper\r\nTwo Medicine Lake and Dawson Pass, to Two Medicine Pass and Paradise\r\nPark, and up the Dry Fork to Cutbank Pass and Valley. A daily afternoon\r\nlaunch trip across Two Medicine Lake brings the visitor to the foot of\r\nSinopah, from which there is a short, delightful path through dense\r\nevergreen forest to the foot of Twin Falls. Trick Falls, near the\r\nhighway bridge across Two Medicine River, 2 miles below the lake, is\r\nmore readily accessible and should be visited by everyone entering the\r\nvalley. A great portion of its water issues from a cave beneath its\r\nbrink. In the early season it appears a very proper waterfall, paneled\r\nby lofty spruce with the purple, snow-crowned Rising Wolf Mountain in\r\nthe background. In late season water issues from the cave alone, with\r\nthe dry fall over its yawning opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTBANK\r\n\r\nCutbank is a primitive, densely wooded valley with a singing mountain\r\nstream. Six miles above the Blackfeet Highway are a quiet chalet,\r\na ranger station, and a small grove for auto campers. A spur lane,\r\nleaving the highway at Cutbank Bridge, 4 miles north of the Browning\r\nWye, brings the autoist to this terminus. A more popular means of\r\napproach is on horseback, over Cutbank Pass from Two Medicine or over\r\nTriple Divide Pass from Red Eagle. Cutbank is a favorite site for\r\nstream fishermen. At the head of the valley above Triple Divide Pass is\r\nthe Triple Divide Peak (8,001 feet) which parts its waters between the\r\nthree oceans surrounding North America, i. e., its drainage is through\r\nthe Missouri-Mississippi system to the Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic),\r\nthrough the Saskatchewan system to Hudson Bay (Arctic), and through the\r\nColumbia system to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED EAGLE\r\n\r\nRed Eagle Lake in Red Eagle Valley is reached by trail only from\r\nCutbank over Triple Divide Pass or from St. Mary Chalets or Sun\r\nCamp via the Many Falls Trail. From the lake rise imposing Split,\r\nAlmost-a-Dog, and Red Eagle Mountains. On its sloping forested sides\r\nreposes Red Eagle Camp, which furnishes rest and shelter. It is a\r\nstopping place for travelers on the Inside Trail from Sun Camp or St.\r\nMary to Glacier Park, and is a favorite spot for fishermen, as large,\r\ngamey, cutthroat trout abound in the waters of the lake. Reached by a\r\nsecondary, picturesque trail that winds through magnificent forests,\r\nthe head of Red Eagle Creek originates in a broad, grassy area almost\r\nas high as the Continental Divide. This bears Red Eagle Glacier and a\r\nnumber of small unnamed lakes, and is hemmed in by imposing rock walls\r\nand serrate peaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARY AND SUN CAMP\r\n\r\nTo many people Upper St. Mary Lake is the most sublime of all mountain\r\nlakes of the world. From its foot roll the plains northeastward to\r\nHudson Bay and the Arctic. Its long and slender surface is deep emerald\r\ngreen, nestled in a salient in the Front Range, with peaks rising\r\nmajestically a mile sheer over three of its sides. These for the most\r\npart possess names of Indian origin: Going-to-the-Sun, Piegan, Little\r\nChief, Mahtotopa Red Eagle, and Curley Bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ GOING-TO-THE-SUN CHALETS]\r\n\r\nSt. Mary Chalet at the lower end of the lake, Going-to-the-Sun Chalets\r\n(Sun Camp) near the upper end, Roes Creek Camp Grounds on the north\r\nshore, and a hikers' camp at the outlet of Baring Creek furnish ample\r\naccommodations for all classes of visitors.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Going-to-the-Sun Highway from St. Mary Junction over\r\nLogan Pass to Lake McDonald runs along the north shore of St. Mary Lake\r\npast Roes Creek Camp. Spurs connect the chalets. Trails centering at\r\nSun Camp lead everywhere: Along the south shore (the Many Falls Trail)\r\nto Red Eagle and St. Mary Chalets; up St. Mary Valley to Blackfeet\r\nGlacier, Gunsight Lake, and over Gunsight Pass to Lake Ellen Wilson,\r\nSperry Chalets, and Lake McDonald; up Reynolds Creek over Logan Pass\r\nand along the Garden Wall to Granite Park; a spur from the trail up\r\nthe same creek turns right and joins at Preston Meadows, high on\r\nGoing-to-the-Sun Mountain, with another trail from Sun Camp which leads\r\nup Baring Creek past Sexton Glacier and over Siyeh Pass; from Preston\r\nMeadows over Piegan Pass and down Cataract Canyon to Many Glacier; up\r\nRoes Creek to Roes Basin; up Mount Reynolds to a fire look-out.\r\n\r\nA ranger naturalist is stationed at Sun Camp who conducts field trips\r\ndaily, lectures each evening in the chalet lobby, and maintains a\r\ncut-flower exhibit there. Small stores are maintained at both chalets;\r\ngasoline is obtainable at each. Scenic twilight launch rides on the\r\nlake are featured when the waters are calm. The ranger-naturalist\r\ngenerally accompanies these trips to impart interesting information\r\nabout the lake and mountains.\r\n\r\nWalks and hikes are popular at Sun Camp--to Baring, St. Mary, Florence,\r\nand Virginia Falls; to Roes and Baring Basins; to Sexton and Blackfeet\r\nGlaciers; to the summit of Goat Mountain. Sunrift Gorge, 100 feet north\r\nof the highway at Baring Creek Bridge, should be seen by everyone. It\r\ncan be reached by trail from Sun Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY GLACIER REGION\r\n\r\nFor many Swiftcurrent Lake is the hub of points of interest, to be\r\nsurpassed by no other spot in the park. From it branch many deep and\r\ninteresting glacial valleys. Fishing, boating, swimming, hiking,\r\nphotographing, mountain climbing, horseback riding, and nature study\r\nare to be enjoyed at their best here. It is reached by an excellent\r\nspur road from the Blackfeet Highway at Babb, or by trail from Sun\r\nCamp, Granite Park, and Waterton Lakes.\r\n\r\nMany Glacier Hotel, the largest hotel in the park, is located on\r\nSwiftcurrent Lake. Just beyond the hotel is an excellent auto camp and\r\na group of auto housekeeping cabins. The hotel has telegraph and\r\ntelephone services, an information desk, curio shop, a grill room and\r\nsoda fountain, swimming pool, barber and shoe-shining shop, photograph\r\nshop, a first-aid medical establishment, and other services. A garage\r\nis situated near the hotel. A store with an ample line of campers'\r\nneeds, including fresh meat, bread, butter, and eggs, is located in\r\nthe auto campground.\r\n\r\nRanger-naturalist service is available at Many Glacier. This includes\r\ndaily field walks; a nightly lecture augmented by motion pictures and\r\nslides in the Convention Hall in the basement of the hotel; an evening\r\ncampfire entertainment in the auto camp; a cut-flower and geological\r\nexhibit in the hotel lobby and in the auto camp; a small museum on the\r\nopposite shore of the lake from the hotel, on the road leading to the\r\ncampground; a self-guiding trail around Swiftcurrent Lake; information\r\nservice in the museum; a naturalist-accompanied launch trip on\r\nSwiftcurrent and Josephine Lakes in the afternoon. In addition to this\r\nlast-named, several other launch trips are taken daily on these lakes.\r\nThis service may be used to shorten hikers' distance to Grinnell Lake\r\nand Glacier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Grant photo._ PICTURESQUE GLACIER PARK HOTEL]\r\n\r\nMany Glacier is a center for fishermen, as there are a dozen good\r\nfishing lakes in the vicinity. Rainbow, brook, and cutthroat trout\r\nabound in Swiftcurrent, Josephine, and Grinnell Lakes, and the lakes\r\nof the Upper Swiftcurrent Valley. Wall-eyed pike are plentiful in Lake\r\nSherburne, the only body of water in the park in which these fish are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent trails in the Swiftcurrent region. Cracker\r\nLake, Morning Eagle Falls, Cataract Falls, Grinnell Lake, Grinnell\r\nGlacier, Iceberg Lake, and Ptarmigan Lake are all reached by oiled\r\nhorseback trails. Good footpaths lead around Swiftcurrent and Josephine\r\nLakes to the summit of Mount Altyn and to Appekunny Falls and Cirque.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ BIGHORN RAMS ARE AMONG THE MANY\r\nINTERESTING ANIMALS TO BE SEEN IN GLACIER]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of seeing and studying wildlife is best in the Many\r\nGlacier region. Except during midsummer, mountain sheep are commonly\r\nseen at close range around the chalets or in the flats above Lake\r\nSherburne. Throughout summer they are high on the slopes of Mount Altyn\r\nor Henkel. Mountain goats are often seen clinging to the precipitous\r\nPinnacle Wall on the way to Iceberg Lake, or on Grinnell Mountain while\r\nen route to Grinnell Glacier, or on the trail to Cracker Lake. Black\r\nbears and grizzlies occasionally visit the grounds near the hotel.\r\nConies are to be heard bleating among the rock slides back of the\r\nranger station along the trail to Iceberg Lake, or near the footpath\r\nacross the lake from the hotel. Early in the morning, or at twilight,\r\nbeavers are frequently seen swimming in the lake. Marmots are common in\r\nmany valleys near the hotel and auto camp. Deer infrequently visit the\r\nregion. Hikers, horseback riders, and rangers have reported seeing such\r\nrare animals as foxes, wolves, and lynxes. Without moving from one's\r\ncomfortable chair on the veranda of the hotel one may watch the ospreys\r\nsoaring back and forth over the lake in quest of fish. These graceful\r\nand interesting birds have their huge nest on top of a dead tree across\r\nthe lake from the hotel. The pair of birds return annually to the same\r\nnest. Beside Swiftcurrent Falls, two families of nesting water ouzels\r\nmay be studied at close range.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLY RIVER VALLEY, WATERTON LAKE, AND GOATHAUNT\r\n\r\nThough much like Swiftcurrent Valley in topographical make-up, the\r\nBelly River district is much wilder and more heavily forested. It is\r\naccessible by trail only from Many Glacier over Ptarmigan Wall or from\r\nWaterton Lake over Indian Pass. These, with spur trails to Helen and\r\nMargaret Lakes, make up the principal trail system. The Glacier Park\r\nSaddle Horse Co. maintains a comfortable mountain camp on Crossley\r\nLake, where food and lodging are available at reasonable rates. Fishing\r\nis good in the lakes of the Belly River country. The 33-mile trip from\r\nMany Glacier to Waterton is one of the finest to be taken in the park.\r\nCrossley Lake Camp is approximately midway.\r\n\r\nThe International Waterton Lake and the northern boundary line of\r\nGlacier National Park mutually bisect each other at right angles. Mount\r\nCleveland rises 6,300 feet sheer above the head of the lake. Waterton\r\nLake townsite, Alberta, is located at the foot. It is reached by\r\nhighway from Glacier Park, Babb, Cardston, Lethbridge, Calgary, and\r\npoints in the Canadian Rockies. The modern Prince of Wales Hotel,\r\nseveral other hostelries, cabin camps, garages, stores, and other\r\nconveniences are in the settlement. A 12-mile spur highway leads to\r\nCameron Lake, another international body of water on whose northern\r\n(Canadian) shore is a fine example of a sphagnum bog. Another winding\r\nroad leads to a colorful canyon known as \"Red Rock.\"\r\n\r\nA picturesque cut-off highway over aspen-covered foothills around the\r\nvery base of majestic Chief Mountain, and beginning at a point 4 miles\r\nnorth of Babb, leads to Waterton Lakes Park in Canada.\r\n\r\nTrails lead from the village to principal points of interest in the\r\nCanadian Park as well as up the west shore to the head of the lake at\r\nwhich are situated the Government ranger station and Goathaunt Camp.\r\nThe head of the lake is more readily reached by the daily launch\r\nservice from Waterton Village, or over trail from Many Glacier by\r\nCrossley Lake Camp, or by Granite Park and Flattop Mountain. A scenic\r\ntrail leads to Rainbow Falls and up Olson Valley to Browns Pass, Bowman\r\nLake, Hole-in-the-Wall Falls, Boulder Pass, and Kintla Lake in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the park. There are no hotel or camp accommodations\r\nat Bowman or Kintla Lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Grant photo._ HORSEBACK PARTY ON BOULDER PASS]\r\n\r\nGame is varied and abundant at Waterton Lake. Moose are sometimes seen\r\nin the swampy lakes along Upper Waterton River. Later in the season,\r\nbull elk are heard bugling their challenge through the night. Deer are\r\nseen both at Waterton Lake Village and Goathaunt Camp. Sheep and goats\r\nlive on neighboring slopes. One does not have to leave the trail to see\r\nevidence of the work of the beaver. The trail down Waterton Valley has\r\nhad to be relocated from time to time, as these industrious workers\r\nflooded the right-of-way. A colony lives at the mouth of the creek\r\nopposite Goathaunt Camp. Otters have been seen in the lakes in the\r\nevening. Marten have bobbed up irregularly at the ranger station.\r\n\r\nBird life is abundant in this district, because of the variety of\r\ncover. Waterfowl are frequently seen on the lake. A pair of ospreys\r\nnest near the mouth of Olson Creek. Pine grosbeaks, warblers, vireos,\r\nkinglets, and smaller birds abound in the hawthorne and cottonwood\r\ntrees, and in the alder thickets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLATTOP MOUNTAIN AND GRANITE PARK\r\n\r\nGlacier Park has within its boundary two parallel mountain ranges.\r\nThe eastern, or front range, extends from the Canadian boundary almost\r\nwithout a break to New Mexico. The western, or Livingston Range, rises\r\nat the head of Lake McDonald, becomes the front range beyond the\r\ninternational line, and runs northwestward to Alaska. Between these two\r\nranges in the center of the park is a broad swell which carries the\r\nContinental Divide from one to the other. This is Flattop Mountain,\r\nwhose groves of trees are open and parklike, wholly unlike the dense\r\nforests of the lowlands with which every park visitor is well\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nA trail leads south from Waterton over Flattop to the tent camp called\r\n\"Fifty Mountain\" and to Granite Park, where a comfortable high-mountain\r\nchalet is located. Here is exposed a great mass of lava, which once\r\nwelled up from the interior of the earth and spread over the region\r\nwhich was then the bottom of a sea. The chalets command a fine view of\r\nthe majestic grouping of mountains around Logan Pass, of the noble\r\nsummits of the Livingston Range, and of systems far to the south and\r\nwest of the park. Extending in the near foreground are gentle slopes\r\ncovered with sparse clumps of stunted vegetation. In early July open\r\nspaces are gold-carpeted with glacier lillies and bizarrely streaked\r\nwith lingering snow patches. Beyond are the deep, heavy forests of\r\nUpper McDonald Valley.\r\n\r\nThe chalets may also be reached from Sun Camp and Logan Pass over a\r\ntrail along the Garden Wall, from the highway 2 miles above the western\r\nswitchback by a 4-mile trail, from Avalanche Camp and Lake McDonald\r\nover the McDonald Valley trail, and from Many Glacier by the beautiful\r\ntrail over Swiftcurrent Pass. A short distance from the chalets a spur\r\nfrom the trail to the Waterton Lake leads to Ahern Pass, from which\r\nthere is an unexcelled view of Ahern Glacier, Mount Merritt, Helen and\r\nElizabeth Lakes, and the South Fork of the Belly River. This spur is\r\nonly a mile from the chalets. At Fifty Mountain Camp, half-way between\r\nGranite Park and Waterton, a second spur, a quarter of a mile long,\r\ntakes one above Flattop Mountain to the summit of the knife-edge. From\r\nhere there is a fine panorama of Mount Cleveland, Sue Lake, and Middle\r\nFork of Belly River.\r\n\r\nA foot trail 1 mile long leads from the Granite Park chalet to the\r\nsummit of Swiftcurrent Mountain upon which a fire lookout is located.\r\nFor the small amount of effort required to make this ascent of 1,000\r\nfeet, no more liberal reward of mountain scenery could be possible.\r\nAnother foot trail leads from the chalets to the rim of the Garden\r\nWall, from which there are splendid views of Grinnell Glacier and the\r\nSwiftcurrent region.\r\n\r\nAnimal life is varied and easily studied at Granite Park. Bear and deer\r\nare common in this section. Mountain goats are frequently seen above\r\nFlattop Mountain or near Ahern Pass. Mountain sheep graze on the slopes\r\nof the Garden Wall. Ptarmigan should be looked for, especially above\r\nSwiftcurrent Pass.\r\n\r\nGranite Park is a paradise for lovers of alpine flowers. On the Garden\r\nWall, the connoisseur should seek for the rare, heavenly blue alpine\r\ncolumbine. Here are expanses of dryads, globe flowers, alpine firewood,\r\nand a wealth of others. Early July is the best time for floral beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGAN PASS\r\n\r\nLogan Pass lies between the headwaters of Logan and Reynolds Creeks. It\r\ncrosses the Continental Divide and carries the Going-to-the-Sun Highway\r\nfrom Lake McDonald to Upper St. Mary Lake and the trail from Sun Camp\r\nto Granite Park.\r\n\r\nThough there are no overnight stopping places on the pass, its\r\naccessibility by automobile makes it a starting place for several\r\ndelightful walks, chiefly to Hidden Lake, which occupies a basin only\r\nrecently evacuated by ice, and tiny Clements Glacier, which sends its\r\nwater to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, and which has been termed\r\n\"Museum Glacier\" because it encompasses in its few hundred acres of\r\nsurficial area all of the principal features of a major glacier.\r\n\r\nRanger-naturalist services, including short field trips, are available\r\ndaily throughout summer on the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVALANCHE CAMP\r\n\r\nAvalanche auto camp is located in a grove of cedars and cottonwoods on\r\na picturesque flat at the mouth of Avalanche Creek. It is equipped with\r\nmodern toilets, showers, and laundry, but has no stores or gasoline\r\nstation. A Government ranger naturalist and a camp tender serve the\r\ncamp, which is on Going-to-the-Sun Highway.\r\n\r\nNear the upper end of the camp, Avalanche Creek has cut a deep, narrow\r\ngorge through brilliant red argillite. It is filled with potholes\r\nscoured out by stones swirled in the foaming torrent. Drooping\r\nhemlocks, festooned with goatsbeard lichen, keep the spot in cool,\r\nsomber gloom even on the hottest midday. This gorge is the home of the\r\nwater ouzel, which is often seen flying back and forth in the spray.\r\n\r\nFrom the gorge, a self-guiding trail leads 2 miles to Avalanche Basin,\r\na semicircular amphitheater with walls over 2,000 feet high over which\r\nplunge a half dozen snowy waterfalls. A dense forest and calm lake\r\nrepose on the floor of the cirque. Fishing is good in the lake. The\r\nnarrow canyon through which the trail leads from the camp offers fine\r\nviews of Heaven's Peak, Mount Cannon, Bearhat Mountain, Gunsight\r\nMountain with the cirque bearing Sperry Glacier, and the canyon in\r\nwhich Hidden Lake reposes. In the early season the walls of the basin\r\nand canyon are draped with countless waterfalls. The sides of Cannon\r\nand Bearhat offer one of the most opportune places for seeing mountain\r\ngoats. In late season huckleberries are abundant.\r\n\r\nA ranger naturalist conducts an entertainment every evening in the\r\ncampfire circle in the auto camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE MCDONALD\r\n\r\nLake McDonald is the largest lake in the park, being 10 miles long and\r\na mile wide. Its shores are heavily forested with cedar, hemlock,\r\nwhite pine, and larch. At its head, impressive, rocky summits rise to\r\nelevations 6,000 feet above its waters. The Going-to-the-Sun Highway\r\nruns along its southeastern shore. Its outlet is 2 miles above Belton\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nLake McDonald Hotel is on the highway near the upper end of the lake.\r\nIt has a store for general supplies, a gasoline station, curio shop,\r\nand all modern conveniences. Its dining room, facing the lake, is one\r\nof the most appropriate and charming in the park. Its lobby is filled\r\nwith well-mounted animals and birds of the region. It is the focal\r\npoint for trails to Sperry Chalet and Gunsight Pass, Upper McDonald\r\nValley, the summit of Mount Brown, and Arrow Lake. There is good\r\nfishing in Arrow and Snyder Lakes.\r\n\r\nPrivate cabin camps are located at the head and foot of the lake. A\r\ngeneral store and gasoline filling station are located at the foot of\r\nthe lake. A well-equipped public auto campground is at Sprague Creek,\r\nnear Lake McDonald Hotel.\r\n\r\nRanger-naturalist services are available at the hotel. Lectures on\r\npopular natural history are delivered each evening in the hotel lobby\r\nand at the Sprague Creek campfire circle. A cut wild-flower exhibit is\r\nalso placed in the hotel. Self-guiding trails lead to Fish and Johns\r\nLakes, short distances from the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERRY CHALETS\r\n\r\nSperry Chalets are located in a picturesque high-mountain cirque,\r\nwith precipitous, highly colored Edwards, Gunsight, and Lincoln Peaks\r\nhemming it in on three sides. It is reached by trail only from Lake\r\nMcDonald and from Sun Camp via Gunsight and Lincoln Passes.\r\n\r\nMountain climbing, exploring Sperry Glacier, fishing in nearby Lake\r\nEllen Wilson, and meeting mountain goats are the chief diversions of\r\nthis entrancing spot, located at timberline. During late afternoons\r\ngoats are to be seen perched against the cirque walls. Practically\r\nevery evening they start down for the chalets, to reach there after\r\nmidnight and fill expectant visitors with joy. Besides these, deer,\r\nmarmots, conies, and Clark nutcrackers and other wildlife are abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELTON\r\n\r\nBelton, on the Great Northern Railway, is the entrance to the west\r\nside of the park. It has stores, hotel, chalet, and a cabin camp to\r\naccommodate the visitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO DO AND SEE\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING\r\n\r\nThe waters of Glacier National Park abound in fish. All popular species\r\nof trout have been planted. They have thrived owing to the abundant\r\nnatural fish foods and the nearly constant temperature of the waters\r\nthe year around. Cutthroat, eastern brook, and rainbow, are the most\r\nabundant. Fly fishing is the greatest sport, but spinners and the\r\never-abundant grasshopper may be used successfully by those not skilled\r\nin the use of the fly. In the larger lakes a Mackinaw or Dolly Varden\r\nweighing 40 pounds is a possibility. All fishing must be in conformity\r\nwith the park regulations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ FISHING THE RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n_Two Medicine Chalets._--Two Medicine Lake has become well known for\r\nits eastern brook and rainbow trout. Good fishing is also found in the\r\nTwo Medicine River below Trick Falls. This lake and stream are probably\r\nbetter stocked than any in the park, because of the proximity to the\r\nhatchery at the eastern entrance.\r\n\r\n_Cut Bank Chalets._--This camp is located on the banks of the North\r\nFork of Cut Bank Creek, which may be fished both ways from the camp for\r\na distance of from 3 to 5 miles. Cutthroat and eastern brook inhabit\r\nthis section, and the fisherman who takes the center of the stream and\r\nfishes with skill is sure of a well-filled creel. The South Fork at Cut\r\nBank Creek is a wild little stream, well stocked, but little known.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary Chalets._--St. Mary Lake is the home of the Mackinaw trout,\r\nas well as cutthroat and rainbow trout. Numerous streams empty into\r\nthis lake from which a goodly toll may be taken with fly or spinner.\r\nRed Eagle Lake, easily reached by trail from St. Mary Chalets, is one\r\nof the best fishing spots in the park. There is also good fishing in\r\nRed Eagle Creek.\r\n\r\n_Going-to-the-Sun Chalets._--The lakes in Roes Creek Basin will furnish\r\nexcellent sport. For the large Mackinaw trout the upper end of St. Mary\r\nLake is a good place. Gunsight Lake, 9 miles distant, is well stocked\r\nwith rainbow trout.\r\n\r\n_Many Glacier Hotel._--Lake Sherburne contains pike, Lake Superior\r\nwhitefish, and rainbow and cutthroat trout. Pike, and often a\r\ncutthroat, are readily taken with the troll. Swiftcurrent River affords\r\ngood stream fishing for the fly caster. Swiftcurrent, Grinnell,\r\nJosephine, and Ptarmigan Lakes are famous for cutthroat, eastern brook,\r\nand rainbow trout. The small lakes along the Swiftcurrent Pass Trail\r\nabound in eastern brook and rainbow trout. Cracker Lake is always ready\r\nto fill the creel with a small black-spotted trout.\r\n\r\nThe North and South Forks of Kennedy Creek are excellent for fishing.\r\nCutthroats are abundant in them and in Slide Lake. Lower Kennedy Lake\r\non the South Fork abounds in grayling.\r\n\r\n_Lake McDonald Hotel._--Fishing in Lake McDonald is good but there is\r\nunusually good trout fishing in Fish Lake (2 miles), Avalanche Lake (9\r\nmiles), Snyder Lake (5 miles), and Lincoln Lake (11 miles). Trout Lake\r\n(7 miles) and Arrow Lake (11 miles), as well as McDonald Creek, also\r\nfurnish a good day's sport.\r\n\r\nThere is a good automobile road to within 3 miles of Avalanche Lake.\r\n\r\n_Red Eagle Tent Camp._--Red Eagle Lake and Red Eagle Creek, both above\r\nand below the lake, abound in large cutthroat trout, some attaining the\r\nweight of 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Crossley Lake Tent Camp._--Crossley and other lakes on the Middle Fork\r\nof the Belly River furnish excellent sport. Cutthroat and Mackinaw\r\ntrout are found here. Large rainbow trout and grayling abound in\r\nElizabeth Lake. In the Belly River proper, rainbow and cutthroat trout\r\nand grayling are plentiful.\r\n\r\n_Goathaunt Tent Camp._--Large Mackinaw and cutthroat trout are found in\r\nWaterton Lake; eastern brook trout are numerous in Waterton River; Lake\r\nFrancis on Olson Creek abounds in rainbow trout.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIKING AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBING\r\n\r\nThe park is a paradise for hikers and mountain climbers. There are\r\nnumerous places of interest near all hotels and chalets which can be\r\nvisited by easy walks. Or trips can be made to occupy one or more days,\r\nstops being planned at various hostelries or camping sites en route.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit giving detailed information regarding points\r\nof interest along the trails, but this can be secured from Elrod's\r\nGuidebook and the United States topographic map. Directional signs are\r\nposted at all trail junctions. There is not the slightest danger of\r\nhikers getting lost if they stay on the trails. It is safe to travel\r\nany of these trails alone. Unless wild animals in the park are molested\r\nor are protecting their young they never attack human beings.\r\n\r\nHikers should secure a topographic map of the park which shows all\r\nstreams, lakes, glaciers, mountains, and other principal features in\r\ntheir proper positions. With a little practice it can be read easily.\r\nThe official map can be purchased for 25 cents at the superintendent's\r\noffice at Belton, the administration office at Glacier Park Station,\r\nthe hotels, and all registration stations at the park entrances.\r\n\r\nThe trip should not be ruined by attempting too much. An average of 2\r\nor 3 miles per hour is good hiking time in the rough park country. One\r\nthousand feet of climb per hour is satisfactory progress over average\r\ntrails. In this rugged country hikes of 15 miles or more should be\r\nattempted only by those who are accustomed to long, hard trips. An\r\nattempt at mountain climbing or \"stunts\" should not be made alone\r\nunless one is thoroughly acquainted with the nature of Glacier's\r\nmountains and weather. Too often \"stunts\" result in serious body\r\ninjuries, or even death, as well as much arduous work for rangers and\r\nothers. Hikers should consult a ranger naturalist or information ranger\r\nbefore venturing on a hazardous, novel, or new undertaking. No one but\r\nan experienced mountaineer should attempt to spend a night in the open.\r\nShelter cabins, for free use by parties overtaken by a storm, have been\r\nerected by the Government on Indian, Piegan, and Gunsight Passes. They\r\nare equipped with flagstone floors, stoves, and a limited supply of\r\nfuel wood. Mountain etiquette demands that they not be left in a\r\ndisorderly state, that no more fuel be consumed than is absolutely\r\nnecessary, and that their privileges and advantages not be abused.\r\n\r\nShelter is not available in some of the most beautiful sections of the\r\npark. To those who are sufficiently sturdy to pack blankets, cooking\r\nutensils, and provisions, and are sufficiently versed in woodcraft\r\nto take care of themselves overnight, Glacier presents wonderful\r\nopportunities. Provisions can be purchased at Glacier Park Station,\r\nBelton, and at any hotel or chalet in the park. For fire prevention,\r\nit is unlawful to build campfires (or fires of any kind) except at\r\ndesignated places. The location of these sites can be ascertained from\r\npark rangers. Unless one is an experienced mountaineer and thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the park, it is unwise to go far from the regular trails\r\nalone. He should not scorn the services of a guide on such trips.\r\n_Above all, he should not attempt to hike across country from one trail\r\nto another._ The many sheer cliffs make this extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf one is a veteran mountaineer and plans to climb peaks or explore\r\ntrackless country, he should take the precaution to leave an outline of\r\nhis plans at his hotel, chalet, or camp, giving especially the time he\r\nexpects to return or reach his next stopping place.\r\n\r\nAt each ranger station, hotel, chalet, and permanent camp in the park\r\nwill be found a \"Hiker's Register\" book. Everyone is urged for his own\r\nprotection to make use of these registers, entering briefly his name,\r\nhome address, time of departure, plans, and probability of taking side\r\ntrips or of changing plans. The hotel clerk should be informed of these\r\nat the time of departure. If a ranger is not there, this information\r\nshould be entered in the register which will be found near the door\r\noutside the building, so that when the ranger returns he can report\r\nit to the next station or to headquarters. These precautions are to\r\nprotect the park visitor. In case of injury or loss, rangers will\r\nimmediately investigate.\r\n\r\nIn planning hiking trips, the following should also be taken into\r\nconsideration: At higher elevations one sunburns easily and painfully\r\nbecause of the rarity of the atmosphere and intense brightness of the\r\nsun. Hikers should include in their kits amber goggles and cold cream\r\nfor glacier and high mountain trips.\r\n\r\nFootwear is most important. A hike should not be started with shoes\r\nor boots that have not been thoroughly broken in. Because feet swell\r\ngreatly on a long trip, hiking shoes should be at least a half size\r\nlarger than street shoes. They need not be heavy, awkward shoes--in\r\nfact, light shoes are much easier on the feet. Most people are made\r\nuncomfortable by high-top boots or shoes which retard the circulation\r\nof the calves. Six-or eight-inch tops are sufficient. Soles should be\r\nflexible, preferably of some composition which is not slippery when\r\nwet. Crepe soles are excellent for mountain climbing and for fishing.\r\nHobnailed shoes are necessary only for grassy slopes or cross-country\r\nwork. Hungarian nails are much to be preferred to hobs, and only a\r\nlight studding of soles and heels is most effective. White silk socks\r\nshould be worn next to the feet, a pair of heavy wool (German) socks\r\nover them. Soaking the feet daily in salt or alum solution toughens\r\nthem. On a hike the feet should be bathed in cold water whenever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nHiking trips with ranger naturalists are described under that service.\r\nThere are many interesting short side trips from all hotels, chalets,\r\nand camps. Short self-guiding trails upon which interesting objects\r\nof natural history are fittingly labeled have been established at the\r\nfollowing places:\r\n\r\n1. Around Swiftcurrent Lake (2-1/2 miles).\r\n\r\n2. From Lake McDonald Hotel to Fish Lake (2 miles).\r\n\r\n3. From Lake McDonald Hotel to Johns Lake (2 miles).\r\n\r\n4.

Swimming pools and plunges with warmed water\r\nare provided at Glacier Park Hotel and Many Glacier Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPING OUT\r\n\r\nThe traveler who is not in a hurry may camp out in the magnificent\r\nwilderness of the park, carrying equipment in his automobile and\r\nstaying as long as he wishes in any of the free Government campgrounds,\r\nor he may carry his bed and provisions on his back. With a competent\r\nguide and a complete camping outfit the park visitor may set forth upon\r\nthe trails to wander at will. On such trips one may venture far afield,\r\nexplore glaciers, climb divides for extraordinary views, linger for the\r\nbest fishing, or spend idle days in spots of inspirational beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Glacier Park Saddle Horse Co. provides excellent small sleeping\r\ntents and a complete outfitting of comforts for pack trips.\r\n\r\nThere are several important points to be remembered on such trips:\r\n\r\nA Government topographic map should be procured and consulted\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nExtreme care should be taken about fires. No fire should be left even\r\nfor a few minutes unless it is _entirely extinguished_. It should be\r\n_drenched completely with water_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nGlacier offers exceptional views to delight the photographer. While\r\nthe scenic attractions are most commonly photographed, the animals, the\r\nflowers, and the picturesque Blackfeet Indians provide interesting\r\nsubjects. Photographic laboratories are maintained at Many Glacier,\r\nLake McDonald, and Glacier Park Hotels, and at Belton village. Expert\r\ninformation regarding exposures and settings is also available at\r\nthese places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARK HIGHWAY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blackfeet Highway, lying along the east side of the park, is an\r\nimproved highway, leading from Glacier Park Station to the Canadian\r\nline via Babb, Mont., and from the line to Waterton Lakes Park and\r\nother Canadian points via Cardston, Alberta. There is also an improved\r\npicturesque cut-off highway, which branches from this road at Kennedy\r\nCreek Junction, 4 miles north of Babb, leading around the base of Chief\r\nMountain to Waterton Lakes Park. Improved highways lead from the\r\nBlackfeet Highway to Two Medicine Lake, the Cutbank Chalets, and Many\r\nGlacier Hotel on Swiftcurrent Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Theodore Roosevelt Highway (US 2) follows the southern boundary of\r\nthe park from Glacier Park Station to Belton, a distance of 58 miles,\r\nand a trip over this highway affords views of excellent scenery.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular Going-to-the-Sun Highway, well known as one of the\r\noutstanding scenic roadways of the world, links the east and west sides\r\nof the park, crossing the Continental Divide through Logan Pass at an\r\naltitude of 6,654 feet, and connects with the Blackfeet Highway at St.\r\nMarys Junction, a distance of 51 miles from Belton. East of the divide\r\nan improved spur road leads to Going-to-the-Sun Chalets on famous St.\r\nMarys Lake. On the west side at Apgar, 2 miles above Belton, a narrow\r\ndirt road follows the north fork of the Flathead River to Bowman and\r\nKintla Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a rule tourists are inclined to carry too much. There are no\r\nunnecessary formalities and no need for formal clothes in Glacier Park,\r\nwhere guests are expected to relax from everyday affairs of living. An\r\ninexpensive and simple outfit is required--old clothes and stout shoes\r\nare the rule. These, together with toilet articles, can be wrapped into\r\na compact bundle and put into a haversack or bag. For saddle trips,\r\nhiking, or idling, both men and women wear riding breeches for greater\r\ncomfort and freedom. Golf knickers are also satisfactory. \"Shorts\",\r\nsuch as are worn by Boy Scouts, are not generally feasible in this\r\npark. Ordinary cotton khaki breeches will do, although woolen ones are\r\npreferable; lightweight woolen underwear and overshirt are advised\r\nbecause of rapid changes of temperature. A sweater or woolen mackinaw\r\njacket, 1 or 2 pairs of cotton gloves, and a raincoat are generally\r\nserviceable. Waterproof slickers are furnished free with saddle horses.\r\n\r\nSupplies and essential articles of clothing of good quality, including\r\nboots, shoes, leggings, socks, haversacks, shirts, slickers, blankets,\r\ncamping equipment, and provisions, may be purchased at well-stocked\r\ncommissaries at Glacier Park, Many Glacier, and Lake McDonald Hotels\r\nand at the camp store at Many Glacier campground. The Glacier Park Hotel\r\nCo., which operates these commissaries, also makes a practice of\r\nrenting, at a nominal figure, riding outfits, mackinaw coats, and other\r\novergarments. Stores carrying a similar general line of articles most\r\nuseful in making park trips are located at Belton and at Glacier Park\r\nvillage. There is a store carrying provisions, cigars, tobacco, and\r\nfishermen's supplies at the foot of Lake McDonald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacier Park Hotel Co., under franchise from the Department of the\r\nInterior, operates the hotel and chalet system in the park and the\r\nBelton Chalets. This system includes the Glacier Park Hotel at Glacier\r\nPark Station, an imposing structure built of massive logs, nearly as\r\nlong as the Capitol at Washington, accommodating 400 guests; the Many\r\nGlacier Hotel on Swiftcurrent Lake, accommodating over 500 guests; and\r\nthe Lake McDonald Hotel on Lake McDonald, with capacity for 100 guests.\r\n\r\nThe chalet groups are from 10 to 18 miles apart, but within hiking\r\ndistance of one another or of the hotels, and provide excellent\r\naccommodations for trail tourists. They are located at Two Medicine,\r\nCutbank, St. Mary, Sun Camp, Granite Park, Sperry, and Belton. In\r\naddition to these, the Glacier Park Saddle Horse Co. maintains tent\r\ncamps at Red Eagle Lake, Crossley Lake, Goathaunt, and Fifty Mountain.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few hotels and camps located on the west side, in\r\nor adjacent to the park, on private lands. The National Park Service\r\nexercises no control over their rates and operations. Private tourist\r\ncabins and hotels are operated outside the park at Glacier Park\r\nStation, Belton, St. Mary, Babb, and Browning Junction.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATES\r\n\r\nThe Glacier Park, Many Glacier, and Lake McDonald Hotels are open from\r\nJune 15 to September 15. The American-plan rates range from $6.50 a day\r\nfor a room, without bath, to $14 a day for de luxe accommodations for\r\none. Rooms may also be obtained on the European plan. Breakfast and\r\nlunch cost $1 each; dinner, $1.50. Children under 8 are charged half\r\nrates, and a discount of 10 percent is allowed for stays of a week or\r\nlonger at any one hotel. Cabins are obtainable at Lake McDonald Hotel\r\nat a rate of $5 each, American plan, for 3 persons in 1 room; 2 persons\r\nin room, $5.50 each; 1 person, $6.50.\r\n\r\nChalets operated during 1937 will be open from June 15 to September 15,\r\nexcept Sperry and Granite Park, which will open July I and close\r\nSeptember 1. Minimum rates are computed on a basis of $4.50 a day per\r\nperson, special accommodations ranging as high as $7.50. A 10-percent\r\ndiscount is allowed for stays of a week or more at any one chalet\r\ngroup. Tent camp rates are $5 per day, per person, American plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ HOUSEKEEPING CABINS AT MANY GLACIER\r\nCAMPGROUNDS]\r\n\r\nThe Swiftcurrent auto cabins are located a little more than a mile from\r\nMany Glacier Hotel. Here a 2-room cabin for 1 or 2 persons costs $2.50\r\na day; 3 or 4 persons in a 3-room cabin, $4 a day. Blankets and linen\r\nmay be rented by the day. The 10 percent discount given at the hotels\r\nand chalets also applies to the housekeeping cabins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSADDLE-HORSE TRIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacier National Park has the distinction of being the foremost trail\r\npark. More saddle horses are used than in any other park or like\r\nrecreational region in this country. The Glacier Park Saddle Horse Co.\r\nhas available during the season about 800 saddle animals. There are\r\nnearly 900 miles of trails in this park.\r\n\r\nAt Glacier Park, Many Glacier, and Lake McDonald Hotels,\r\nGoing-to-the-Sun Chalets, and Goathaunt Tent Camp, horses may be\r\nengaged or released for trips in the park, including camping trips.\r\nAt Two Medicine Chalets horses may be engaged or released for local\r\nrides only.\r\n\r\nA wonderful 3-day excursion is afforded by the Logan Pass Triangle\r\ntrip. This trip may be started at either the Many Glacier Hotel and\r\nChalets or Going-to-the-Sun Chalets. Beginning at Many Glacier Hotel,\r\nthe first day's route follows up Swiftcurrent Pass to Granite Park\r\nChalets, where luncheon is served and the overnight stop made. The\r\nsecond day the Garden Wall Trail to Logan Pass is followed, with a box\r\nluncheon on the way, and Going-to-the-Sun Chalets is reached in late\r\nafternoon in time for dinner. The return to Many Glacier Hotel is made\r\nthe third day via Piegan Pass, Grinnell Lake, and Josephine Lake.\r\n\r\nThe South Circle trip requires 5 days to complete and may be\r\nstarted either from Many Glacier, Going-to-the-Sun Chalets, or Lake\r\nMcDonald Hotel on Lake McDonald. Three of the principal passes are\r\ntraversed--Swiftcurrent, Gunsight, and Piegan. The North Circle trip is\r\nalso a 5-day tour via tent camps, crossing Swiftcurrent Pass, Indian\r\nPass, and Ptarmigan Wall. The trip starts from Many Glacier Hotel,\r\nGoing-to-the-Sun Chalets, or Lake McDonald Hotel.\r\n\r\nThere is a 4-day inside trail trip from Glacier Park Hotel via Two\r\nMedicine, Cut Bank, and Red Eagle to Sun Camp.\r\n\r\nMany delightful specially scheduled trips of 1 and 2 days' duration are\r\nalso available.\r\n\r\nInformation about saddle-horse trips may be obtained at any of the\r\nhotels or other points of concentration. Practically any type of\r\ntrip desired can be arranged, from short excursions to special points\r\nof interest, such as the half-day trip from Glacier Park Hotel to\r\nForty-Mile Creek for $3.50, to pack trips of unlimited duration; the\r\nlarger the party, the cheaper the rates. For minimum parties of 3\r\npersons, the average rate for 1-day trips is $5 or $6. For parties of 3\r\nor more, the all-expense Fifty Mountain Trail trip of 3 days is $28.50;\r\nthe 5-day North Circle trip, $50.50. These are specifically mentioned\r\nmerely to give an idea of the cost; many other fine trips are available\r\nat rates computed on a similar basis.\r\n\r\nSpecial arrangements can be made for private camping parties making a\r\ntrip of 10 days or more at rates amounting to $11 a day each for groups\r\nof 7 or more; $12 a day each for 6 persons; $13 for 5; $15 for 4; $16\r\nfor 3; $18 for 2; and $27 for 1 person. A guide and cook, are furnished\r\nfor a party of one or more persons, and extra helpers are added, if the\r\nnumber of persons require it. Private trips of less than 10 days may\r\nalso be arranged.\r\n\r\nExperienced riders may rent horses for use on the floor of the valleys\r\nat $1 an hour, $3 for 4 hours, and $5 for 8 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL-EXPENSE TOURS BY BUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacier Park Transport Co. and the Glacier Park Hotel Co. have\r\njointly arranged some very attractive all-expense tours of 1, 2, 3, and\r\n4 days' duration. These trips are priced reasonably and include auto\r\nfare, meals, and hotel lodgings. The trips begin at Glacier Park Station\r\nfor west-bound passengers and at Belton for east-bound passengers and\r\nare made daily during the season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Grant photo._ RESTING AT THE SOUTH PORTAL OF THE TUNNEL\r\nON PTARMIGAN WALL TRAIL]\r\n\r\n_Trip No. 1._--Logan Pass Detour.--Glacier Park Hotel to Going-to-the-Sun\r\nChalets, Lake McDonald Hotel, and Belton, Mont.

Daily stage service in each\r\ndirection is maintained between Glacier Park Hotel and St. Mary\r\nChalets, Many Glacier Hotel and Chalets, Waterton, and Going-to-the-Sun\r\nChalets, Lake McDonald Hotel, and Belton Station. A daily bus trip is\r\nmade from Glacier Park Hotel to Two Medicine Chalets on Two Medicine\r\nLake, allowing sufficient time at the lake to fish or make the launch\r\ntrip. Regular motorbus service is maintained between Glacier Park Hotel\r\nand Belton. On the west side daily bus service is maintained between\r\nBelton, the foot of Lake McDonald, and the Lake McDonald Hotel at the\r\nhead of Lake McDonald, and between this hotel and Logan Pass on the\r\nContinental Divide.\r\n\r\nThe transportation company and launch companies allow each passenger\r\nto carry with him 25 pounds of hand baggage without extra charge, which\r\nis usually sufficient for shorter trips. Trunks are forwarded at\r\nextra expense. Arrangements can be made for caring for trunks left at\r\nentrances during tour of park or rechecking them for passengers who\r\nenter at one side and leave by the other. Storage charges on baggage at\r\nGlacier Park Station and at Belton are waived while tourists are making\r\npark trips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNCHES AND ROWBOATS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacier Park Hotel Co. operates launch service on Waterton Lake\r\nbetween Goathaunt Camp in Glacier Park, and the Waterton Lake townsite\r\nin Alberta, Canada, crossing the international boundary line about\r\nhalf-way up the lake.

The Swanson Co. also rents rowboats for 50 cents an\r\nhour; $2.50 a day, or $15 a week for use on the following lakes: Two\r\nMedicine, St. Mary, Swiftcurrent, Josephine, and McDonald. Outboard\r\nmotors may also be rented.\r\n\r\nThis booklet is issued once a year and the rates mentioned herein may\r\nhave changed slightly since issuance, but the latest rates approved by\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior are on file with the superintendent and\r\nthe park operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe representative of the National Park Service in immediate charge of\r\nthe park is the superintendent, E. T. Scoyen, Belton, Mont.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Lindsay is United States commissioner for the park and holds\r\ncourt in all cases involving violations of park regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALIST SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nA daily schedule of popular guided trips afield, all-day hikes, boat\r\ntrips, campfire entertainments, and illustrated lectures is maintained\r\nat Many Glacier, Going-to-the-Sun, Two Medicine, Lake McDonald, Sprague\r\nCreek, and Avalanche Auto Campgrounds, the leading tourist centers.\r\nNaturalists who conduct local field trips and walks to nearby Hidden\r\nLake and Clements Glacier are stationed at Logan Pass daily from 9 to 4.\r\n\r\nA small museum dealing with popular local natural history subjects is\r\nmaintained throughout July and August at Many Glacier Ranger Station.\r\nCut-flower exhibits are installed at various hotels and chalets, and an\r\nexhibit of rock specimens is in the lobby of Many Glacier Hotel.\r\n\r\nRequests from special parties desiring ranger naturalist assistance\r\nare given every consideration. All park visitors are urged to avail\r\nthemselves of the services of the naturalists who are there to assist\r\nthem in learning of the untold wonders that abound everywhere in the\r\npark. Acceptance of gratuities for this free service is strictly\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nFor complete information on naturalist schedules and types of service\r\noffered consult the free pamphlet, Ranger-Naturalist Service, Glacier\r\nNational Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMOBILE CAMPGROUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the use of the motoring public a system of free automobile\r\ncampgrounds has been developed on both sides of the park. On the east\r\nside, these camps are located at Two Medicine, Cutbank, Roes Creek, and\r\nMany Glacier. The west side camps are at Bowman Lake, Fish Creek,\r\nAvalanche Creek, and Lake McDonald. Pure water, firewood, cookstoves,\r\nand sanitary facilities are available, but campers must bring their own\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States post offices are located at Glacier Park, Mont.,\r\nBelton, Mont., Polebridge, Mont., and (during summer season) Lake\r\nMcDonald, Mont., at Lake McDonald Hotel, and Apgar, at the foot of Lake\r\nMcDonald. Mail for park visitors should include in the address the name\r\nof the stopping place as well as the post office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTelegraph and express service is available at all points of concentration.\r\n\r\nQualified nurses are in attendance at the hotels and both sides of the\r\npark, and there is a resident physician at Glacier Park Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARK'S GEOLOGIC STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Glacier National Park are made up of many layers of\r\nlimestone and other rocks formed from sediments deposited under water.\r\nThe rocks show ripple marks which were made by waves when the rock\r\nmaterial was soft sand and mud. Raindrop impressions and sun cracks\r\nshow that the mud from time to time was exposed to rains and the drying\r\naction of the air. These facts indicate that the area now known as\r\n\"Glacier National Park\" was once covered by a shallow sea. At intervals\r\nmuds were laid down which later became consolidated into rocks known as\r\n\"shales\" and \"argillites.\" Limy or calcareous muds were changed into\r\nlimestone. The geologist estimates that these depositions were made\r\nseveral hundred million years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the plains area east of the mountains are other lime and mud\r\nformations. These are younger and softer than the rocks which make\r\nup the mountains but were undoubtedly formed under much the same\r\nconditions. These contain much higher forms of life, such as fish\r\nand shells.\r\n\r\nWhen originally laid down all these layers must have been nearly\r\nhorizontal, just as they are deposited today in bodies of standing\r\nwater all over the world. Then came a time when the sea slowly but\r\npermanently withdrew from the area by an uplift of the land, which\r\nsince that time has been continuously above sea level. This uplift, one\r\nof the greatest in the history of the region, marks the beginning of\r\na long period of erosion which has carved the mountains of Glacier\r\nNational Park.\r\n\r\nThe geologist observes that the rock layers are no longer in the\r\nhorizontal position in which they were laid down. There are folds\r\nin the rocks and many breaks or faults cutting across the layers.\r\nFurthermore, the oldest rocks in the region are found to be resting on\r\nthe younger rocks of the adjacent plains. One of the best examples of\r\nthis is to be seen at Chief Mountain where the ancient limestone rests\r\ndirectly on the young shale below (fig. 1). The same relationship is\r\nvisible in Cutbank, St. Mary, and Swiftcurrent Valleys. In these areas,\r\nhowever, the exact contact is not always so easy to locate principally\r\nbecause of the debris of weathered rocks that have buried them. What\r\nhas happened? How did this peculiar relationship come about? The\r\nanswers to these questions unravel one of the grandest stories in earth\r\nhistory. Forces deep in the earth slowly gathered energy until finally\r\nthe stress became so great that the rocky crust began to move.\r\n\r\nThe probable results of the movement in the crust of the earth are\r\nshown in the diagram (fig. 2). Section A represents a cross section\r\nof the Glacier Park region, as it most likely appeared, immediately\r\nfollowing the long period of sedimentation. The rock strata are\r\nhorizontal. Section B shows the same region after the rock layers have\r\nbeen slightly wrinkled due to the forces from the southwest, which,\r\nalthough slightly relieved by the bending, still persisted and the\r\nfolds were greatly enlarged as shown in section C. At this stage the\r\nfolds reached their breaking limit, and the strata broke in a number of\r\nplaces as indicated by dotted lines in the diagram. As a result of this\r\nfracturing, the rocks on the west side of the folds were pushed upward\r\nand over the rocks on the east, as shown in section D. The mountain\r\nrocks (represented by patterns of cross lines) were shoved over the\r\nrocks of the plains (represented in white), producing what is known as\r\nan \"overthrust fault.\" It has been estimated that the rocks have moved\r\na distance of at least 15 miles.\r\n\r\nAs the rocks were thrust northeastward and upward they made a greatly\r\nelevated region, but did not, however, at any time project into the\r\nair, as indicated in section D, because as the rocky mass was being\r\nuplifted, streams were wearing it away and cutting deep canyons in its\r\nupland portion. The rocks of the mountains, owing to their resistant\r\ncharacter, are not worn away as rapidly as the plains formations with\r\nthe result that great thicknesses of limestone and argillite tower\r\nabove the plains. Where the older, more massive strata overlie the\r\nsoft rocks the mountains are terminated by precipitous walls as\r\nshown in section E. This explains the absence of foothills that is\r\nso conspicuous a feature of this mountain front and one in which it\r\ndiffers from most other ranges.\r\n\r\nWhile the region now known as \"Glacier National Park\" was being\r\nuplifted and faulted, the streams were continually at work. The sand\r\nand other abrasive material being swept along on the beds of the\r\nstreams slowly wore away much of the rock. The uplifting gave the\r\nstreams life and they consequently cut deep valleys into the mountain\r\narea. They cut farther and farther back into the mountain mass until\r\nthey dissected it, leaving instead of an upland plateau a region of\r\nridges and sharp peaks. This erosional process which has carved the\r\nmountains of Glacier Park has produced most of the mountains of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFollowing their early erosional history, there came a period of much\r\ncolder climate during which time heavy snows fell and large ice fields\r\nwere formed throughout the mountain region. At the same time huge\r\ncontinental ice sheets formed in Canada and also in northern Europe.\r\nThis period, during which glaciers, sometimes over a mile thick,\r\ncovered many parts of the world including all of Canada and New England\r\nand much of North Central United States, is known as the \"Ice Age.\"\r\nSuch a tremendous covering of ice had an enduring and pronounced effect\r\nupon the relief of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--_Sketch showing structure of Chief Mountain.\r\nThe ancient limestone above is not appreciably altered, but the lower\r\npart is broken up by many oblique thrust faults. The entire mountain\r\nis composed of ancient rocks and rests on shale of a very much younger\r\nage. After Bailey Willis._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--_The Lewis overthrust. Diagram illustrating\r\nhow pressure from the northwest affected the rocks of the Glacier Park\r\nregion._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--_A, An irregular V-shaped valley produced\r\nby stream erosion; B, the same valley after it has been occupied by\r\na glacier. Note the smooth topography and U-shaped form._]\r\n\r\nIn Glacier National Park some of the ice still remains in the higher\r\nportions of the valleys and a study of these ice fields helps in\r\ninterpreting the history of the park during the Ice Age. It is evident\r\nthat ice did not cover the entire range, but that the higher peaks\r\nstood out above the ice, which probably never reached a thickness of\r\nover 3,000 feet in this region. The V-shaped valleys which had been\r\nproduced by stream erosion were filled with glaciers which moved slowly\r\ndown the valleys. The ice froze onto all loose rock material and\r\ncarried it forward, using it as abrasive to gouge out the rock, the\r\nvalley bottoms, and sides. Gradually the valleys were molded until they\r\nhad acquired a smooth U-shaped character (fig. 3). There are excellent\r\nexamples of this work of ice in the park, among which are Two Medicine,\r\nCut Bank, St. Mary, Swiftcurrent, and Belly River Valleys.\r\n\r\nIn addition to smoothing the valley down which they moved, the glaciers\r\nproduced many rock basins called cirques. These are the result of ice\r\nplucking in the regions where the glaciers formed. Alternate freezing\r\nand thawing cause the rock to break and the resulting fragments are\r\ncarried away by the moving ice mass. In the majority of cases the\r\ncirques have lakes on their floors. The park is dotted with these\r\nbeautiful little lakes scattered throughout the high mountain country.\r\n\r\nThe valley lakes are usually larger than the cirque lakes and have a\r\ndifferent origin. As the glaciers melted they deposited huge loads of\r\nsand, mud, and boulders in the valley bottoms called moraines. Debris\r\nof this nature has helped to hold in the waters of St. Mary, Lower Two\r\nMedicine, McDonald, Bowman, and numerous other lakes in the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORA AND FAUNA\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacier National Park is exceptionally rich in many kinds of wildlife.\r\nIts rugged wilderness character, enhanced by numerous lakes and almost\r\nunlimited natural alpine gardens, combine to offer an unexcelled\r\nopportunity to enjoy and study nature.\r\n\r\nGlacier is noted for its brilliant floral display which is most\r\nstriking in early July. Above timber line hardy plants such as mosses\r\nand lichens, together with the delicately colored alpine flowers, are\r\nfound. Lower on the mountains are heather, gentians, wild heliotrope,\r\nand stunted trees of alpine fir, white-barked pine, and alpine larch.\r\nThe valleys on the east bear Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, lodgepole\r\npine, Douglas fir, and limber pine.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the west side are within an entirely different plant\r\nlife zone, typified by dense climax forests. For the most part these\r\nforests consist of red cedar and hemlock, with intermediate forests of\r\nlarch, fir, spruce, and white pine. There are also younger stands of\r\nlarch and lodgepole pine. Some of the white pines in McDonald Valley\r\nhave reached huge dimensions. The deficiency of wild flowers found\r\nthere is in part made up by the presence of sphagnum bogs with a\r\ntypical fauna and flora of their own.\r\n\r\nOn the east, at lower elevations, representatives of the Great Plains\r\nflora are found, such as the passion flower, carpet pink, shooting\r\nstar, scarlet paintbrush, red and white geraniums, bronze agoseris, the\r\ngaillardia, wild hollyhock, asters, and many other composites. The bear\r\ngrass is one of the most characteristic plants of Glacier.\r\n\r\nOf equal interest is the abundant animal life, including both the\r\nlarger and smaller forms. Bighorn, mountain goats, moose, wapiti,\r\ngrizzly and black bear, and western white-tailed and Rocky Mountain\r\nmule deer exist in as natural a condition as is possible in an area\r\nalso utilized by man. Mountain caribou are occasional visitors to the\r\npark. Mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes are present, although the\r\nfirst have been reduced greatly from their original numbers. The\r\nbeaver, marmot, otter, marten, cony, and a host of smaller mammals are\r\ninteresting and important members of the fauna. Among the birds, those\r\nthat attract the greatest interest are the osprey, water ouzel,\r\nptarmigan, Clark nutcracker, thrushes, and sparrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hileman photo._ BEARGRASS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEAL PLACE TO SEE AMERICAN INDIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Kootenais, few Indians ventured into the\r\nfastness of the park mountains before the coming of the white men. Yet\r\nso frequently did a large number of tribes use its trails for hunting\r\nand warfare, or camp in midsummer along its lakes and streams on the\r\nedge of the plains, that the park has an Indian story intertwined with\r\nits own that is unsurpassed in interest. Except for a few plateau\r\nIndians who had strong plains' characteristics because they once lived\r\non the plains, all tribes were of that most interesting of Indian\r\ntypes, the plains Indian.\r\n\r\nThe earliest peoples inhabiting the northern Montana plains of which\r\nwe have any record were apparently Snake Indians of Shoshonean stock.\r\nLater Nez Perces, Flatheads, and Kootenais pushed eastward through\r\npasses from the headwaters of the Columbia River system. Then came\r\nhorses and firearms, and the whites themselves to set up an entirely\r\ndifferent state of affairs in their hitherto relatively peaceful\r\nexistence. First, a growing and expounding Siouan race, pressed forward\r\nalso by an expanding irresistible Algonkian stock, occupied the high\r\nplains and pushed back its peoples behind the wall of mountains. These\r\nwere the Crows from the south, the Assiniboins to the east. Lastly,\r\narmed with strategy and Hudson's Bay Co. firearms, and given speed and\r\nrange with horses, the dauntless Blackfeet came forth from their\r\nforests to become the terror of the north. They grew strong on the\r\nabundance of food and game on the Great Plains, and pushed the Crows\r\nbeyond the Yellowstone River, until met by the forces of white soldiery\r\nand the tide of civilization.\r\n\r\nToday the Blackfeet on the reservation adjoining the park on the east\r\nremain a pitiful but picturesque remnant of their former pride and\r\nglory. They have laid aside their former intense hostility to the\r\nwhites and have reconciled themselves to the fate of irrepressible\r\ncivilization. Dressed in colorful native costume, a few families of\r\nbraves greet the park visitor at Glacier Park Station and Hotel. Here\r\nthey sing, dance, and tell stories of their former greatness. In these\r\nare reflected in a measure the dignity, the nobility, the haughtiness,\r\nand the savagery of one of the highest and most interesting of\r\naboriginal American peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nALBRIGHT, HORACE M., and TAYLOR, FRANK J.
