SCULL.\r\n\r\nin the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHERS' INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late war with Spain marks a momentous epoch in the progress of our\r\ncountry, whose history, stretching through the centuries of discovery,\r\nexploration, settlement, the struggle for independence, foreign and\r\ndomestic war, lofty achievement in all departments of knowledge and\r\nprogress, is the most interesting in human annals. It is a record full\r\nof instruction and incitement to endeavor, which must fill every\r\nAmerican with pride in his birthright, and with gratitude to Him who\r\nholds the earth and the sea in the hollow of His hand.\r\n\r\nThe following pages contain a complete, accurate, and graphic history of\r\nour country from the first visit of the Northmen, a thousand years ago,\r\nto the opening of its new destiny, through the late struggle, resulting\r\nin the freeing of Cuba, the wresting of the Philippines, Porto Rico, and\r\nthe Ladrones from the tyranny of the most cruel of modern nations, and\r\nthe addition of Hawaii to our domain. The Greater United States, at one\r\nbound, assumes its place in the van of nations, and becomes the foremost\r\nagent in civilizing and christianizing the world.\r\n\r\nThe task, long committed to England, Germany, France, Russia, and later\r\nto Japan, must henceforth be shared with us, whose glowing future gives\r\npromise of the crowning achievement of the ages. With a fervent trust in\r\na guiding Providence, and an abiding confidence in our ability, we enter\r\nupon the new and grander career, as in obedience to the divine behest\r\nthat the Latin race must decrease and the Anglo-Saxon increase, and that\r\nthe latter, in a human sense, must be the regenerator of all who are\r\ngroping in the night of ignorance and barbarism.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful story that is traced in the pages that follow. A\r\ncomprehension of the present and of the promise of the future\r\nnecessitates an understanding of the past. The history of the Greater\r\nUnited States, therefore, is complete, from the first glimpse, in the\r\nearly morning of October 12, 1492, of San Salvador by Columbus, through\r\nthe settlement of the colonies, their struggles for existence, the\r\ncolonial wars, the supreme contest between England and France for\r\nmastery in the New World, the long gloom of the Revolution that brought\r\nindependence, the founding of the Republic, in 1787, the growth and\r\nexpansion of the nation, the mighty War for the Union that united the\r\ndivided house and planted it upon a rock, and the later \"war for\r\nhumanity,\" when the perishing islands, stretching their hands to us in\r\nhelpless anguish, were gathered under the flag of freedom, there to\r\nremain through all time to come.\r\n\r\nThere have been many leaders in this great work. Not the story of the\r\ndeeds alone, but of those who performed them is told. History,\r\nbiography, and all that is interesting and profitable to know are here\r\ntruthfully set forth, for their lesson is one whose value is beyond\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the history of that which was simply the United States, a\r\ncomplete account is given of our new colonial possessions, Hawaii, Porto\r\nRico, the Philippines, the Ladrones, and of Cuba, the child of our\r\nadoption. Their geography, their soil, climate, productions,\r\ninhabitants, and capabilities are set forth with fullness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the publishers confidently claim that \"The Greater\r\nRepublic\" is the fullest, most interesting, reliable, and instructive\r\nwork of the kind ever offered the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I AM READY FOR ANY SERVICE THAT I CAN GIVE MY COUNTRY\"\r\n\r\nIn 1798 our Government was about to declare war against France. Congress\r\nappointed Washington Commander-in-chief of the American Army. The\r\nSecretary of War carried the commission in person to Mt. Vernon.

contain no more impressive example of the birth\r\nand growth of a nation than may be seen in the case of that which has\r\nbeen aptly termed the Greater Republic, whose story from its feeble\r\nchildhood to its grand maturity it is the purpose of this work to set\r\nforth. Three hundred years is a brief interval in the long epoch of\r\nhuman history, yet within that short period the United States has\r\ndeveloped from a handful of hardy men and women, thinly scattered along\r\nour Atlantic coast, into a vast and mighty country, peopled by not less\r\nthan seventy-five millions of human beings, the freest, richest, most\r\nindustrious, and most enterprising of any people upon the face of the\r\nearth. It began as a dwarf; it has grown into a giant. It was despised\r\nby the proud nations of Europe; it has become feared and respected by\r\nthe proudest of these nations. For a long time they have claimed the\r\nright to settle among themselves the affairs of the world; they have now\r\nto deal with the United States in this self-imposed duty. And it is\r\nsignificant of the high moral attitude occupied by this country, that\r\none of the first enterprises in which it is asked to join these ancient\r\nnations has for its end to do away with the horrors of war, and\r\nsubstitute for the drawn sword in the settlement of national disputes a\r\ngreat Supreme Court of arbitration.\r\n\r\nThis is but one of the lessons to be drawn from the history of the great\r\nrepublic of the West. It has long been claimed that this history lacks\r\ninterest, that it is devoid of the romance which we find in that of the\r\nEastern world, has nothing in it of the striking and dramatic, and is\r\ntoo young and new to be worth men's attention when compared with that of\r\nthe ancient nations, which has come down from the mists of prehistoric\r\ntime. Yet we think that those who read the following pages will not be\r\nready to admit this claim. They will find in the history of the United\r\nStates an abundance of the elements of romance. It has, besides, the\r\nmerit of being a complete and fully rounded history. We can trace it\r\nfrom its birth, and put upon record the entire story of the evolution of\r\na nation, a fact which it would be difficult to affirm of any of the\r\nolder nations of the world.\r\n\r\nIf we go back to the origin of our country, it is to find it made up of\r\na singular mixture of the best people of Europe. The word best is used\r\nhere in a special sense. The settlers in this country were not the rich\r\nand titled. They came not from that proud nobility which claims to\r\npossess bluer blood than the common herd, but from the plain people of\r\nEurope, from the workers, not the idlers, and this rare distinction they\r\nhave kept up until the present day. But of this class of the world's\r\nworkers, they were the best and noblest. They were men who thought for\r\nthemselves, and refused to be bound in the trammels of a State religion;\r\nmen who were ready to dare the perils of the sea and the hardships of a\r\nbarren shore for the blessings of liberty and free-thought; men of\r\nsturdy thrift, unflinching energy, daring enterprise, the true stuff out\r\nof which alone a nation like ours could be built.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of the Pilgrims and the Puritans, the hardy\r\nempire-builders of New England, of the Quakers of New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, the Catholics of Maryland, the Huguenots of the South, the\r\nMoravians and other German Protestants, the sturdy Scotch-Irish, and the\r\nothers who sought this country as a haven of refuge for free-thought. We\r\ncannot say the same for the Hollanders of New Amsterdam, the Swedes of\r\nDelaware, and the English of Virginia, so far as their purpose is\r\nconcerned, yet they too proved hardy and industrious settlers, and the\r\nCavaliers whom the troubles in England drove to Virginia showed their\r\ngood blood by the prominent part which their descendants played in the\r\nwinning of our independence and the making of our government. While the\r\nvarious peoples named took part in the settlement of the colonies, the\r\nbulk of the settlers were of English birth, and Anglo-Saxon thrift and\r\nenergy became the foundation stones upon which our nation has been\r\nbuilt. Of the others, nearly the whole of them were of Teutonic origin,\r\nwhile the Huguenots, whom oppression drove from France, were of the very\r\nbone and sinew of that despot-ridden land. It may fairly be said, then,\r\nthat the founders of our nation came from the cream of the populations\r\nof Europe, born of sturdy Teutonic stock, and comprising thrift, energy,\r\nendurance, love of liberty, and freedom of thought to a degree never\r\nequaled in the makers of any other nation upon the earth. They were of\r\nsolid oak in mind and frame, and the edifice they built had for its\r\nfoundation the natural rights of man, and for its super-structure that\r\nspirit of liberty which has ever since throbbed warmly in the American\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIt was well for the colonies that this underlying unity of aim existed,\r\nfor aside from this they were strikingly distinct in character and\r\naspirations. Sparsely settled, strung at intervals along the\r\nfar-extended Atlantic coast, silhouetted against a stern background of\r\nwilderness and mountain range, their sole bond of brotherhood was their\r\ncommon aspiration for liberty, while in all other respects they were\r\nunlike in aims and purposes. The spirit of political liberty was\r\nstrongest in the New England colonies, and these held their own against\r\nevery effort to rob them of their rights with an unflinching boldness\r\nwhich is worthy of the highest praise, and which set a noble example for\r\nthe remaining colonists. Next to them in bold opposition to tyranny were\r\nthe people of the Carolinas, who sturdily resisted an effort to make\r\nthem the enslaved subjects of a land-holding nobility. In Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland political rights were granted by high-minded proprietors,\r\nand in these colonies no struggle for self-government was necessary.\r\nOnly in Virginia and New York was autocratic rule established, and in\r\nboth of these it gradually yielded to the steady demand for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, New England, while politically the freest, was\r\nreligiously the most autocratic. The Puritans, who had crossed the ocean\r\nin search of freedom of thought, refused to grant a similar freedom to\r\nthose who came later, and sought to found a system as intolerant as that\r\nfrom which they had fled. A natural revulsion from their oppressive\r\nmeasures gave rise in Rhode Island to the first government on the face\r\nof the earth in which absolute religious liberty was established. Among\r\nthe more southern colonies, a similar freedom, so far as liberty of\r\nChristian worship is concerned, was granted by William Penn and Lord\r\nBaltimore. But this freedom was maintained only in Rhode Island and\r\nPennsylvania, religious intolerance being the rule, to a greater or less\r\ndegree, in all the other colonies; the Puritanism of New England being\r\nreplaced elsewhere by a Church of England autocracy.\r\n\r\nThe diversity in political condition, religion, and character of the\r\nsettlers tended to keep the colonies separate, while a like diversity of\r\ncommercial interests created jealousies which built up new barriers\r\nbetween them. The unity that might have been looked for between these\r\nfeeble and remote communities, spread like links of a broken chain far\r\nalong an ocean coast, had these and other diverse conditions to contend\r\nwith, and they promised to develop into a series of weak and separate\r\nnations rather than into a strong and single commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe influences that overcame this tendency to disunion were many and\r\nimportant. We can only glance at them here. They may be divided into two\r\nclasses, warlike hostility and industrial oppression. The first step\r\ntowards union was taken in 1643, when four of the New England colonies\r\nformed a confederation for defense against the Dutch and Indians. \"The\r\nUnited Colonies of New England\" constituted in its way a federal\r\nrepublic, the prototype of that of the United States. The second step of\r\nimportance in this connection was taken in 1754, when a convention was\r\nheld at Albany to devise measures of defense against the French.\r\nBenjamin Franklin proposed a plan of colonial union, which was accepted\r\nby the convention. But the jealousy of the colonies prevented its\r\nadoption. They had grown into communities of some strength and with a\r\ndegree of pride in their separate freedom, and were not ready to yield\r\nto a central authority. The British Government also opposed it, not\r\nwishing to see the colonies gain the strength which would have come to\r\nthem from political union. As a result, the plan fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe next important influence tending towards union was the oppressive\r\npolicy of Great Britain. The industries and commerce of the colonies had\r\nlong been seriously restricted by the measures of the mother-country,\r\nand after the war with France an attempt was made to tax the colonists,\r\nthough they were sternly refused representation in Parliament, the\r\ntax-laying body. Community in oppression produced unity in feeling; the\r\ncolonies joined hands, and in 1765 a congress of their representatives\r\nwas held in New York, which appealed to the King for their just\r\npolitical rights. Nine years afterwards, in 1774, a second congress was\r\nheld, brought together by much more imminent common dangers. In the\r\nfollowing year a third congress was convened. This continued in session\r\nfor years, its two most important acts being the Declaration of\r\nIndependence from Great Britain and the Confederation of the States, the\r\nfirst form of union which the colonies adopted. This Confederation was\r\nin no true sense a Union. The jealousies and fears of the colonies made\r\nthemselves apparent, and the central government was given so little\r\npower that it threatened to fall to pieces of its own weight. It could\r\npass laws, but could not make the people obey them. It could incur\r\ndebts, but could not raise money by taxation to pay them. The States\r\nkept nearly all the power to themselves, and each acted almost as if it\r\nwere an independent nation, while the Congress of the Confederation was\r\nleft without money and almost without authority.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs soon grew intolerable. \"We are,\" said Washington,\r\n\"one nation to-day, and thirteen to-morrow.\" Such a union it was\r\nimpossible to maintain. It was evident that the compact must give way;\r\nthat there must be one strong government or thirteen weak ones. This\r\nlast alternative frightened the States. None of them was strong enough\r\nto hold its own against foreign governments. They must form a strong\r\nunion or leave themselves at the mercy of ambitious foes. It was this\r\nstate of affairs that led to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, by\r\nwhose wisdom the National Union which has proved so solid a bond was\r\norganized. The Constitution made by this body gave rise to the Republic\r\nof the United States. A subsequent act, which in 1898 added a number of\r\ndistant island possessions to our Union, and vastly widened its\r\ninterests and its importance in the world's councils, made of it a\r\n\"Greater Republic,\" a mighty dominion whose possessions extended half\r\nround the globe.\r\n\r\nWhile the changes here briefly outlined were taking place, the country\r\nwas growing with phenomenal rapidity. From all parts of northern and\r\nwestern Europe, and above all from Great Britain, new settlers were\r\ncrowding to our shores, while the descendants of the original settlers\r\nwere increasing in numbers. How many people there were here is in doubt,\r\nbut it is thought that in 1700 there were more than 200,000, in 1750\r\nabout 1,100,000, and in 1776 about 2,500,000. The first census, taken in\r\n1790, just after the Federal Union was formed, gave a population of\r\nnearly 4,000,000.\r\n\r\nA people growing at this rate could not be long confined to the narrow\r\nocean border of the early settlements. A rich and fertile country lay\r\nback, extending how far no one knew, and soon there was a movement to\r\nthe West, which carried the people over the mountains and into the broad\r\nplains beyond. A war was fought with France for the possession of the\r\nOhio country. Boone and other bold pioneers led hardy settlers into\r\nKentucky and Tennessee, and George Rogers Clark descended the Ohio and\r\ndrove the British troops from the northwest territory, gaining that vast\r\nregion for the new Union.\r\n\r\nAfter the War for Independence the movement westward went on with\r\nrapidity. The first settlement in Ohio was made at Marietta in 1788;\r\nCincinnati was founded in 1790; in 1803 St. Louis was a little village\r\nof log-cabins; and in 1831 the site of Chicago was occupied by a dozen\r\nsettlers gathered round Fort Dearborn. But while the cities were thus\r\nslow in starting, the country between them was rapidly filling up, the\r\nIndians giving way step by step as the vanguard of the great march\r\npressed upon them; here down the Ohio in bullet-proof boats, there\r\nacross the mountains on foot or in wagons. A great national road\r\nstretched westward from Cumberland, Maryland, which in time reached the\r\nMississippi, and over whose broad and solid surface a steady stream of\r\nemigrant wagons poured into the great West. At the same time steamboats\r\nwere beginning to run on the Eastern waters, and soon these were\r\ncarrying the increasing multitude down the Ohio and the Mississippi into\r\nthe vast Western realm. Later came the railroad to complete this phase\r\nof our history, and provide a means of transportation by whose aid\r\nmillions could travel with ease where a bare handful had made their way\r\nwith peril and hardship of old.\r\n\r\nUp to 1803 our national domain was bounded on the west by the\r\nMississippi, but in that year the vast territory of Louisiana was\r\npurchased from France and the United States was extended to the summit\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, its territory being more than doubled in area.\r\nHere was a mighty domain for future settlement, across which two daring\r\ntravelers, Lewis and Clark, journeyed through tribes of Indians never\r\nbefore heard of, not ending their long route until they had passed down\r\nthe broad Columbia to the waters of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time new domains were added to the great republic. In 1819\r\nFlorida was purchased from Spain. In 1845 Texas was added to the Union.\r\nIn 1846 the Oregon country was made part of the United States. In 1848,\r\nas a result of the Mexican War, an immense tract extending from Texas\r\nto the Pacific was acquired, and the land of gold became part of the\r\nrepublic. In 1853 another tract was purchased from Mexico, and the\r\ndomain of the United States, as it existed at the beginning of the Civil\r\nWar, was completed. It constituted a great section of the North American\r\ncontinent, extending across it from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and\r\nnorth and south from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, a fertile,\r\nwell-watered, and prolific land, capable of becoming the nursery of one\r\nof the greatest nations on the earth. Beginning, at the close of the\r\nRevolution, with an area of 827,844 square miles, it now embraced\r\n3,026,484 square miles of territory, having increased within a century\r\nto nearly four times its original size.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a new step was taken, in the addition to this country of a\r\nregion of land separated from its immediate domain. This was the\r\nterritory of Alaska, of more than 577,000 square miles in extent, and\r\nwhose natural wealth has made it a far more valuable acquisition than\r\nwas originally dreamed of. In 1898 the Greater Republic, as it at\r\npresent exists, was completed by the acquisition of the island of Porto\r\nRico in the West Indies, and the Hawaiian and Philippine Island groups\r\nin the Pacific Ocean. These, while adding not greatly to our territory,\r\nmay prove to possess a value in their products fully justifying their\r\nacquisition. At present, however, their value is political rather than\r\nindustrial, as bringing the United States into new and important\r\nrelations with the other great nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe growth of population in this country is shown strikingly in the\r\nremarkable development of its cities. In 1790 the three largest cities\r\nwere not larger than many of our minor cities to-day. Philadelphia had\r\nforty-two thousand population, New York thirty-three thousand, and\r\nBoston eighteen thousand. Charleston and Baltimore were still smaller,\r\nand Savannah was quite small. There were only five cities with over ten\r\nthousand population. Of inland towns, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with\r\nsomething over six thousand population, was the largest. In 1890, one\r\nhundred years afterwards, New York and Philadelphia had over one million\r\neach, and Chicago, a city not sixty years old, shared with them this\r\nhonor. As for cities surpassing those of a century before, they were\r\nhundreds in number. A similar great growth has taken place in the\r\nStates. From the original thirteen, hugging closely the Atlantic coast,\r\nwe now possess forty-five, crossing the continent from ocean to ocean,\r\nand have besides a vast territorial area.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen original States, sparsely peopled, poor and struggling for\r\nexistence, have expanded into a great galaxy of States, rich, powerful,\r\nand prosperous, with grand cities, flourishing rural communities,\r\nmeasureless resources, and an enterprise which no difficulty can baffle\r\nand no hardship can check. Our territory could support hundreds of\r\nmillions of population, and still be much less crowded than some of the\r\ncountries of Europe. Its products include those of every zone; hundreds\r\nof thousands of square miles of its soil are of virgin richness; its\r\nmineral wealth is so great that its precious metals have affected the\r\nmonetary standards of the world, and its vast mineral and agricultural\r\nwealth is as yet only partly developed. Vast as has been the production\r\nof gold in California, its annual output is of less value than that of\r\nwheat. In wheat, corn, and cotton, indeed, the product of this country\r\nis simply stupendous; while, in addition to its gold and silver, it is a\r\nmighty storehouse of coal, iron, copper, lead, petroleum, and many other\r\nproducts of nature that are of high value to mankind.\r\n\r\nIn its progress towards its present condition, our country has been\r\nmarkedly successful in two great fields of human effort, in war and in\r\npeace. A brief preliminary statement of its success in the first of\r\nthese, and of the causes of its several wars, may be desirable here, as\r\nintroductory to their more extended consideration in the body of the\r\nwork. The early colonists had three enemies to contend with: the\r\noriginal inhabitants of the land, the Spanish settlers in the South, and\r\nthe French in the North and West. Its dealings with the aborigines has\r\nbeen one continuous series of conflicts, the red man being driven back\r\nstep by step until to-day he holds but a small fraction of his once\r\ngreat territory. Yet the Indians are probably as numerous to-day as they\r\nwere originally, and are certainly better off in their present peaceful\r\nand partly civilized condition than they were in their former savage and\r\nwarlike state.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were never numerous in this country, and were forced to\r\nretire after a few conflicts of no special importance. Such was not the\r\ncase with the French, who were numerous and aggressive, and with whom\r\nthe colonists were at war on four successive occasions, the last being\r\nthat fierce conflict in which it was decided whether the Anglo-Saxon or\r\nthe French race should be dominant in this country. The famous battle on\r\nthe Plains of Abraham settled the question, and with the fall of Quebec\r\nthe power of France in America fell never to rise again.\r\n\r\nA direct and almost an immediate consequence of this struggle for\r\ndominion was the struggle for liberty between the colonists and the\r\nmother-country. The oppressive measures of Great Britain led to a war of\r\nseven years' duration, in which more clearly and decisively than ever\r\nbefore the colonists showed their warlike spirit and political genius,\r\nand whose outcome was the independence of this country. At its\r\nconclusion the United States stepped into line with the nations of the\r\nworld, a free community, with a mission to fulfill and a destiny to\r\naccomplish--a mission and a destiny which are still in process of\r\ndevelopment, and whose final outcome no man can foresee.\r\n\r\nThe next series of events in the history of our wars arose from the\r\nmighty struggle in Europe between France and Great Britain and the\r\npiratical activity of the Barbary States. The latter were forced to\r\nrespect the power of the United States by several naval demonstrations\r\nand conflicts; and a naval war with France, in which our ships were\r\nstrikingly successful, induced that country to show us greater respect.\r\nBut the wrongs which we suffered from Great Britain were not to be so\r\neasily settled, and led to a war of three years' continuance, in which\r\nthe honors were fairly divided on land, but in which our sailors\r\nsurprised the world by their prowess in naval conflict. The proud boast\r\nthat \"Britannia rules the waves\" lost its pertinence after our two\r\nstriking victories on Lake Erie and Lake Champlain, and our remarkable\r\nsuccess in a dozen conflicts at sea. Alike in this war and in the\r\nRevolution the United States showed that skill and courage in naval\r\nwarfare which has recently been repeated in the Spanish War.\r\n\r\nThe wars of which we have spoken had a warrant for their being. They\r\nwere largely unavoidable results of existing conditions. This cannot\r\njustly be said of the next struggle upon which the United States\r\nentered, the Mexican War, since this was a politician's war pure and\r\nsimple, one which could easily have been avoided, and which was entered\r\ninto with the avowed purpose of acquiring territory. In this it\r\nsucceeded, the country gaining a great and highly valuable tract, whose\r\nwealth in the precious metals is unsurpassed by any equal section of the\r\nearth, and which is still richer in agricultural than in mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nThe next conflict that arose was the most vital and important of all our\r\nwars, with the exception of that by which we gained our independence.\r\nThe Constitution of 1787 did not succeed in forming a perfect Union\r\nbetween the States. An element of dissension was left, a \"rift within\r\nthe lute,\" then seemingly small and unimportant, but destined to grow to\r\ndangerous proportions. This was the slavery question, disposed of in the\r\nConstitution by a compromise, which, like every compromise with evil,\r\nfailed in its purpose. The question continued to exist. It grew\r\nthreatening, portentous, and finally overshadowed the whole political\r\ndomain. Every effort to settle it peacefully only added to the strain;\r\nthe union between the States weakened as this mighty hammer of discord\r\nstruck down their combining links; finally the bonds yielded, the\r\nslavery question thrust itself like a great wedge between, and a mighty\r\nstruggle began to decide whether the Union should stand or fall. With\r\nthe events of this struggle we are not here concerned. They are told at\r\nlength in their special place. All that we shall here say is this: While\r\nthe war was fought for the preservation of the Union, it was clearly\r\nperceived that this union could never be stable while the disorganizing\r\nelement remained, and the war led inevitably to the abolition of\r\nslavery, the apple of discord which had been thrown between the States.\r\nThe greatness of the result was adequate to the greatness of the\r\nconflict. With the end of the Civil War, for the first time in their\r\nhistory, an actual and stable Union was established between the States.\r\n\r\nWe have one more war to record, the brief but important struggle of\r\n1898, entered into by the United States under the double impulse of\r\nindignation against the barbarous destruction of the _Maine_ and of\r\nsympathy for the starving and oppressed people of Cuba. It yielded\r\nresults undreamed of in its origin. Not only was Cuba wrested from the\r\nfeeble and inhuman hands of Spain, but new possessions in the oceans of\r\nthe east and west were added to the United States, and for the first\r\ntime this country took its predestined place among the nations engaged\r\nin shaping the destiny of the world, rose to imperial dignity in the\r\nestimation of the rulers of Europe, and fairly won that title of the\r\nGREATER REPUBLIC which this work is written to commemorate.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the record of this country in war. Its record in peace has\r\nbeen marked by as steady a career of victory, and with results\r\nstupendous almost beyond the conception of man, when we consider that\r\nthe most of them have been achieved within little more than a century.\r\nDuring the colonial period the energies of the American people were\r\nconfined largely to agriculture, Great Britain sternly prohibiting any\r\nprogress in manufacture and any important development of commerce. It\r\nneed hardly be said that the restless and active spirit of the colonists\r\nchafed under these restrictions, and that the attempt to clip the\r\nexpanding wings of the American eagle had as much to do with bringing on\r\nthe war of the Revolution as had Great Britain's futile efforts at\r\ntaxation. The genius of a great people cannot thus be cribbed and\r\nconfined, and American enterprise was bound to find a way or carve\r\nitself a way through the barriers raised by British avarice and tyranny.\r\n\r\nIt was after the Revolution that the progress of this country first\r\nfairly began. The fetters which bound its hands thrown off, it entered\r\nupon a career of prosperity which broadened with the years, and extended\r\nuntil not only the whole continent but the whole world felt its\r\ninfluence and was embraced by its results. Manufacture, no longer held\r\nin check, sprang up and spread with marvelous rapidity. Commerce, now\r\ngaining access to all seas and all lands, expanded with equal speed.\r\nEnterprise everywhere made itself manifest, and invention began its long\r\nand wonderful career.\r\n\r\nIn fact, freedom was barely won before our inventors were actively at\r\nwork. Before the Constitution was formed John Fitch was experimenting\r\nwith his steamboat on the Delaware, and Oliver Evans was seeking to move\r\nwagons by steam in the streets of Philadelphia. Not many years elapsed\r\nbefore both were successful, and Eli Whitney with his cotton-gin had set\r\nfree the leading industry of the South and enabled it to begin that\r\nremarkable career which proved so momentous in American history, since\r\nto it we owe the Civil War with all its great results.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the nineteenth century the development of the\r\nindustries and of the inventive faculty of the Americans went on with\r\nenhanced rapidity. The century was but a few years old when Fulton, with\r\nhis improved steamboat, solved the question of inland water\r\ntransportation. By the end of the first quarter of the century this was\r\nsolved in another way by the completion of the Erie Canal, the longest\r\nand hitherto the most valuable of artificial water-ways. The railroad\r\nlocomotive, though invented in England, was prefigured when Oliver\r\nEvans' steam road-wagon ran sturdily through the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia. To the same inventor we owe another triumph of American\r\ngenius, the grain elevator, which the development of agriculture has\r\nrendered of incomparable value. The railroad, though not native here,\r\nhas had here its greatest development, and with its more than one\r\nhundred and eighty thousand miles of length has no rival in any country\r\nupon the earth. To it may be added the Morse system of telegraphy, the\r\ntelephone and phonograph, the electric light and electric motor, and all\r\nthat wonderful series of inventions in electrical science which has been\r\ndue to American genius.\r\n\r\nWe cannot begin to name the multitude of inventions in the mechanical\r\nindustries which have raised manufacture from an art to a science and\r\nfilled the world with the multitude of its products. It will suffice to\r\nname among them the steam hammer, the sewing machine, the cylinder\r\nprinting-press, the type-setting machine, the rubber vulcanizer, and the\r\ninnumerable improvements in steam engines and labor-saving apparatus of\r\nall kinds. These manufacturing expedients have been equaled in number\r\nand importance by those applied to agriculture, including machines for\r\nplowing, reaping, sowing the seed, threshing the grain, cutting the\r\ngrass, and a hundred other valuable processes, which have fairly\r\nrevolutionized the art of tilling the earth, and enabled our farmers to\r\nfeed not only our own population but to send millions of bushels of\r\ngrain annually abroad.\r\n\r\nIn truth, we have entered here upon an interminable field, so full of\r\ntriumphs of invention and ingenuity, and so stupendous in its results,\r\nas to form one of the chief marvels of this wonderful century, and to\r\nplace our nation, in the field of human industry and mechanical\r\nachievement, foremost among the nations of the world. Its triumphs have\r\nnot been confined to manufacture and agriculture; it has been as active\r\nin commerce, and now stands first in the bulk of its exports and\r\nimports. In every other direction of industry it has been as active, as\r\nin fisheries, in forestry, in great works of engineering, in vast mining\r\noperations; and from the seas, the earth, the mountain sides, our\r\nlaborers are wresting annually from nature a stupendous return in\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nOur progress in the industries has been aided and inspired by an equal\r\nprogress in educational facilities, and the intellectual development of\r\nour people has kept pace with their material advance. The United States\r\nspends more money for the education of its youth than any other country\r\nin the world, and among her institutions the school-house and the\r\ncollege stand most prominent. While the lower education has been\r\nabundantly attended to, the higher education has been by no means\r\nneglected, and amply endowed colleges and universities are found in\r\nevery State and in almost every city of the land. In addition to the\r\nschool-house, libraries are multiplying with rapidity, art galleries and\r\nmuseums of science are rising everywhere, temples to music and the drama\r\nare found in all our cities, the press is turning out books and\r\nnewspapers with almost abnormal energy, and in everything calculated to\r\nenhance the intelligence of the people the United States has no\r\nsuperior, if any equal, among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may seem unnecessary to tell the people of the United States the\r\nstory of their growth. The greatness to which this nation has attained\r\nis too evident to need to be put in words. It has, in fact, been made\r\nevident in two great and a multitude of smaller exhibitions in which the\r\nmarvels of American progress have been shown, either by themselves or in\r\ncontrast with those of foreign lands. The first of these, the Centennial\r\nExposition of 1876, had a double effect: it opened our eyes at once to\r\nour triumphs and our deficiencies, to the particulars in which we\r\nexcelled and those in which we were inferior to foreign peoples. In the\r\nnext great exhibition, that at Chicago in 1893, we had the satisfaction\r\nto perceive, not only that we had made great progress in our points of\r\nsuperiority, but had worked nobly and heartily to overcome our defects,\r\nand were able to show ourselves the equal of Europe in almost every\r\nfield of human thought and skill. In architecture a vision of beauty was\r\nshown such as the world had never before seen, and in the general domain\r\nof art the United States no longer had need to be ashamed of what it had\r\nto show.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having briefly summed up the steps of progress of the United\r\nStates, I may close with some consideration of the problem which we\r\nconfront in our new position as the Greater Republic, the lord of\r\nislands spread widely over the seas. Down to the year 1898 this country\r\nheld a position of isolation, so far as its political interests were\r\nconcerned. Although the sails of its merchant ships whitened every sea\r\nand its commerce extended to all lands, its boundaries were confined to\r\nthe North American continent, its political activities largely to\r\nAmerican interests. Jealous of any intrusion by foreign nations upon\r\nthis hemisphere, it warned them off, while still in its feeble youth, by\r\nthe stern words of the Monroe doctrine, and has since shown France and\r\nEngland, by decisive measures, that this doctrine is more than an empty\r\nform of words.\r\n\r\nSuch was our position at the beginning of 1898. At the opening of 1899\r\nwe had entered into new relations with the world. The conclusion of the\r\nwar with Spain had left in our hands the island of Porto Rico in the\r\nWest Indies and the great group of the Philippines in the waters of\r\nAsia, while the Hawaiian Islands had became ours by peaceful annexation.\r\nWhat shall we do with them? is the question that follows. We have taken\r\nhold of them in a way in which it is impossible, without defeat and\r\ndisgrace, to let go. Whatever the ethics of the question, the Philippine\r\nproblem has assumed a shape which admits of but one solution. These\r\nislands will inevitably become ours, to hold, to develop, to control,\r\nand to give their people an opportunity to attain civilization,\r\nprosperity, and political manumission which they have never yet\r\npossessed. That they will be a material benefit to us is doubtful. That\r\nthey will give us a new position among the nations of the earth is\r\nbeyond doubt. We have entered formally into that Eastern question which\r\nin the years to come promises to be the leading question before the\r\nworld, and which can no longer be settled by the nations of Europe as an\r\naffair of their own, with which the United States has no concern.\r\n\r\nThis new position taken by the United States promises to be succeeded by\r\nnew alliances, a grand union of the Anglo-Saxon peoples, which will give\r\nthem a dominant position among the powers of the world. In truth, it may\r\nnot cease with the union of the Anglo-Saxons. The ambition and vast\r\ndesigns of Russia are forcing the other nations to combine for\r\nprotection, and a close alliance of all the Teutonic peoples is\r\npossible, combined to resist the Slavic outgrowth, and eventually\r\nperhaps to place the destinies of the world in the hands of these two\r\ngreat races, the Teutonic and the Slavic.\r\n\r\nAll this may be looking overfar into the future. All that can be said\r\nnow is that our new possessions have placed upon us new duties and new\r\nresponsibilities, and may effectually break that policy of political\r\nisolation which we have so long maintained, and throw us into the\r\ncaldron of world politics to take our part in shaping the future of the\r\nuncivilized races. For this we are surely strong enough, enterprising\r\nenough, and moral enough; and whatever our record, it is not likely to\r\nbe one of defeat, of injustice and oppression, or of forgetfulness of\r\nthe duty of nations and the rights of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES MORRIS.\r\n  JULY, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\nThe Visits of the Northmen to the New World--The Indians and Mound\r\nBuilders--Christopher Columbus--His Discovery of America--Amerigo\r\nVespucci--John Cabot--_Spanish Explorers_--Balboa--His Discovery of the\r\nPacific--Magellan--Ponce de Leon--De Narvaez--De Soto--Menendez--_French\r\nExplorers_--Verrazzani--Cartier--Ribault--Laudonniere--Champlain--La\r\nSalle--_English Explorers_--Sir Hugh Willoughby--Martin Frobisher--Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert--Sir Walter Raleigh--The Lost Colony--_Dutch\r\nExplorer_--Henry Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN.\r\n\r\nIt has been established beyond question that the first white visitors to\r\nthe New World were Northmen, as the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden\r\nwere called. They were bold and hardy sailors, who ventured further out\r\nupon the unknown sea than any other people. It was about the year 1000\r\nthat Biorn, who was driven far from his course by a tempest, sighted the\r\nnorthern part of the continent. Other adventurers followed him and\r\nplanted a few settlements, which, however, lasted but a few years.\r\nSnorri, son of one of these settlers, was the first child born of\r\nEuropean parents on this side of the Atlantic. Soon all traces of these\r\nearly discoverers vanished, and the New World lay slumbering in\r\nloneliness for nearly five hundred years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERIGO VESPUCCI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND BUILDERS.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the country was peopled with savages, who lived by hunting\r\nand fishing and were scattered over the vast area from the Pacific to\r\nthe Atlantic and from the Arctic zone to the southernmost point of South\r\nAmerica. No one knows where these people came from; but it is probable\r\nthat at a remote period they crossed Bering Strait, from Asia, which was\r\nthe birthplace of man, and gradually spread over the continents to the\r\nsouth. There are found scattered over many parts of our country immense\r\nmounds of earth, which were the work of the Mound Builders. These people\r\nwere long believed to have been a race that preceded the Indians, and\r\nwere distinct from them, but the best authorities now agree that they\r\nwere the Indians themselves, who constructed these enormous\r\nburial-places and were engaged in the work as late as the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is strange that they attained a fair degree of civilization.\r\nThey builded cities, wove cotton, labored in the fields, worked gold,\r\nsilver, and copper, and formed regular governments, only to give way in\r\ntime to the barbarism of their descendants, who, though a contrary\r\nimpression prevails, are more numerous to-day than at the time of the\r\ndiscovery of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEETING BETWEEN THE NORTHMEN AND NATIVES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nThe real discoverer of America was Christopher Columbus, an Italian,\r\nborn in Genoa, about 1435. He was trained to the sea from early boyhood,\r\nand formed the belief, which nothing could shake, that the earth was\r\nround, and that by sailing westward a navigator would reach the coast of\r\neastern Asia. The mistake of Columbus was in supposing the earth much\r\nsmaller than it is, and of never suspecting that a continent lay between\r\nhis home and Asia.\r\n\r\nHe was too poor to fit out an expedition himself, and the kings and\r\nrulers to whom he applied for help laughed him to scorn. He persevered\r\nfor years, and finally King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain were\r\nwon over to his views. They and some wealthy friends of Columbus\r\nfurnished the needed funds, and on August 3, 1492, he sailed from Palos,\r\nSpain, in command of three small vessels, the _Santa Maria_, the\r\n_Pinta_, and the _Nina_.\r\n\r\nAs the voyage progressed, the sailors became terrified and several times\r\nwere on the point of mutiny; but Columbus by threats and promises held\r\nthem to their work, and on Friday, October 12, 1492, land was sighted.\r\nHe was rowed ashore and took possession of the new country in the name\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella. While it is not known with certainty where he\r\nlanded, it was probably Watling Island, one of the Bahamas. He named it\r\nSan Salvador, and, believing it to be a part of India, called the\r\nnatives _Indians_, by which name they will always be known. He afterward\r\nvisited Cuba and Haiti, and returned to Palos on the 15th of March,\r\n1493.\r\n\r\nColumbus was received with the highest honors, and, as the news of his\r\ngreat discovery spread, it caused a profound sensation throughout\r\nEurope. He made three other voyages, but did not add greatly to his\r\ndiscoveries. He died, neglected and in poverty, May 20, 1506, without\r\nsuspecting the grandeur of his work, which marked an era in the history\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DISCOVERERS.\r\n\r\nAnother famous Italian navigator and friend of Columbus was Amerigo\r\nVespucci, who, fired by the success of the great navigator, made several\r\nvoyages westward. He claimed to have seen South America in May, 1497,\r\nwhich, if true, made him the first man to look upon the American\r\ncontinent. Late investigations tend to show that Vespucci was correct in\r\nhis claim. At any rate, his was the honor of having the country named\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEBASTIAN CABOT.]\r\n\r\nJohn Cabot, also an Italian, but sailing under the flag of England,\r\ndiscovered the continent of North America, in the spring of 1497. A year\r\nlater, Sebastian, son of John, explored the coast from Nova Scotia as\r\nfar south as Cape Hatteras. It was the work of the elder Cabot that gave\r\nEngland a valid claim to the northern continent.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, it will be seen that Spain, now decrepit and\r\ndecayed, was one of the most powerful of all nations four hundred years\r\nago. Other leading powers were England, France, and Holland, and all of\r\nthem soon began a scramble for new lands on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. Spain, having been the first, had a great advantage, and she\r\nwas wise enough to use all the means at her command. We will first trace\r\nthe explorations made by that nation.\r\n\r\nIn 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, a lawless rogue, hid himself in a cask\r\non board of a vessel in order to escape his creditors, and was not\r\ndiscovered by the angry captain until so far from land that he could not\r\nbe taken back again. As it turned out, this was a fortunate thing for\r\nthe captain and crew, for Balboa was a good sailor, and when the ship\r\nwas wrecked on the coast of Darien he led the men through many dangers\r\nto an Indian village, where they were saved from starvation. Balboa had\r\nbeen in the country before and acquired a knowledge of it, which now\r\nproved helpful.\r\n\r\nThe story of Spain in America is one long, frightful record of massacre,\r\ncruelty, greed, and rapine. Ferocious by nature, her explorers had not\r\nsufficient sense to see that it was to their interest to treat the\r\nIndians justly. These people, although armed only with bows and arrows,\r\nat which the Spaniards laughed, still outnumbered them a thousandfold\r\nand could crush them by the simple force of numbers. Besides, they were\r\nalways provided with food, which they were eager to give to their\r\npale-faced brothers, who were often unable to obtain it, but whose\r\nvicious nature would not permit them to be manly and just.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Spaniards were crazy after gold, which they believed\r\nexisted in many places in prodigious quantities. The sight of the yellow\r\nornaments worn by the natives fired their cupidity, and they inquired\r\neagerly in the sign language where the precious metal could be found.\r\nOne of the Indians replied that six days' travel westward would bring\r\nthem to the shores of a great sea, where gold was as plentiful as the\r\npebbles on the beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARAVELS OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. (After an engraving\r\npublished in 1584.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nThis information, as may be believed, set the Spaniards wild, and,\r\nengaging a number of the natives as guides, they plunged into the hot,\r\nsteaming forests, and pressed on until one day they came to the base of\r\na mountain, from the top of which the guides said the great sea could be\r\nseen. Balboa made his men stay where they were while he climbed to the\r\ncrest of the mountain alone. This was on the 26th of September, 1513,\r\nand, as Balboa looked off to the westward, his eyes rested upon the\r\nPacific Ocean, the mightiest body of water on the globe.\r\n\r\nHe had made a grand discovery, and one which led to the conquest of\r\nMexico and Peru and the colonization of the western coast of our\r\ncountry. Spain sent her armed expeditions thither, and in time they\r\noverran the sections named, their footprints marked everywhere by fire\r\nand blood. Many remains exist to-day in the Southwest of the early\r\nvisits of those rapacious adventurers, during the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century. In Santa Fe, New Mexico, is a building made of adobe\r\nor sun-dried clay which was built in 1582.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\nIn 1519 Ferdinand Magellan coasted South America to the strait named in\r\nhis honor, and, passing through it, entered upon the vast body of water\r\ndiscovered six years before by Balboa. Magellan gave it the name of\r\nPacific Ocean, and, sailing westward, discovered the Philippine Islands,\r\nwhich have lately acquired such importance in our history. There\r\nMagellan died. Several of his ships were lost, but one of them succeeded\r\nin reaching Spain after an absence of two years. This was the first\r\ncircumnavigation of the globe and demonstrated the grandeur of the\r\ndiscovery made by Columbus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMBUS AND THE EGG.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner the Spanish courtiers, jealous of Columbus, said anyone\r\ncould discover the Indies. When, at Columbus' request, they failed to\r\nmake an egg stand on its end, he showed them how to do it by flattening\r\nthe end of it. \"Anyone could do that,\" remarked a courtier. \"So anyone\r\ncan discover the Indies, after I have shown the way.\"]\r\n\r\nOne of the companions of Columbus on his second voyage was Ponce de\r\nLeon. He was well on in years, and became deeply interested in a story\r\ntold by the Indians of a wonderful land to the north of Cuba, where\r\nthere was a marvelous spring, which would bring back youth to any who\r\ndrank from its waters. De Leon set out to hunt for the land and\r\ndiscovered it in Florida on Easter Sunday, in 1513. He drank to\r\nrepletion again and again from the springs he found, but without\r\nrestoring his youth, and he was killed by Indians in 1521, while trying\r\nto form a settlement on the coast.\r\n\r\nDe Narvaez visited Florida, in 1528, in charge of a large expedition,\r\nwith the intention of marching into the interior, but the Spaniards were\r\nso brutal to the Indians that they fought them step by step, until only\r\nfour wretched beings were left alive. They lived a long time with the\r\nnatives, but gradually worked their way across the continent to\r\nCalifornia, where they found some of their countrymen, who took care of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-equipped expeditions ever sent out was that of Hernando\r\nde Soto, which landed at Tampa Bay in May, 1539. Although the intention\r\nwas to penetrate far into the interior, the Spaniards had no sooner set\r\nfoot on land than they began their outrages against the Indians, who, as\r\nin the case of De Narvaez, turned upon them and slew large numbers. The\r\nexplorers, however, pushed on and passed over a large section of\r\ncountry, though the precise course taken is not known. In the summer of\r\n1541 they crossed the present State of Mississippi and thus discovered\r\nthe Father of Waters. Three years were spent in wandering through the\r\nSouth, during which one-third of the number were killed or died and all\r\nthe property destroyed. Losing heart at last, De Soto turned about, in\r\nMay, 1542, and started for the sea with the intention of returning home.\r\nHe was worn and weakened from fever, and he expired on the 21st of the\r\nmonth. Fearful that the news of his death would incite the Indians to\r\nattack them, his survivors wrapped the body in blankets, weighted it\r\nwith stones, and at midnight rowed stealthily out into the river and let\r\nit sink from sight. There was something fitting in the fact that the\r\nMississippi should prove the last resting-place of its discoverer.\r\n\r\nPedro Menendez was one of the most execrable miscreants that ever lived.\r\nHe arrived off the coast of Florida with a large expedition and at the\r\nmouth of the St. John's saw a number of ships flying the flag of France.\r\nHe furiously attacked them and drove them to sea. Then he returned to a\r\nfine harbor which he had discovered and began the town of St. Augustine.\r\nThis was in 1565, and St. Augustine is, therefore, the oldest settlement\r\nwithin the present limits of the United States, excluding those founded\r\nin some of our colonial possessions.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn attention to the French explorations. France in those\r\ndays was a spirited rival of Spain, and, in 1524, she sent out a fleet\r\nof four vessels under the command of Verrazzani, who, strange as it may\r\nseem, was also an Italian. Two months later, with only a single ship\r\nremaining, he sighted the mainland of America, it is believed near North\r\nCarolina, from which point he coasted northward along New England. He\r\ngave the name of New France to all the countries he visited, but his\r\naccount of his explorations is so vague that it is uncertain what lands\r\nhe saw. Verrazzani, however, seems to have been the first navigator who\r\nformed a correct idea of the size of the globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEARCH FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH BY PONCE DE LEON.]\r\n\r\nIn 1534 Jacques Cartier, with two ships, entered the mouth of the St.\r\nLawrence. He was so impressed by the desolation of the shores of\r\nNewfoundland that he declared his belief that it was the land to which\r\nGod had banished Cain. Nevertheless, he took possession of the country\r\nin the name of France and then returned home.\r\n\r\nCartier visited the country the following year with a larger expedition\r\nand sailed up the St. Lawrence to the sites of Quebec and Montreal. He\r\nwas not successful in his attempts to found colonies, but his discovery\r\ngave France a title to the immense region which she held with a firm\r\ngrasp for more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nFailing to establish colonies in the North, France now directed her\r\nefforts to the south. The Huguenots suffered so much persecution in the\r\nOld World that they sought a home in the New. Captain John Ribault,\r\nsailing from Havre with two ships, sighted Florida on the last day of\r\nApril, 1562. The Indians were friendly and the explorers were charmed\r\nwith the country. Ribault took possession of it in the name of France\r\nand gave French names to various places. Finally he dropped anchor in\r\nthe harbor of Port Royal and began founding a settlement.\r\n\r\nAll were in good spirits and wished to remain, but Ribault sailed for\r\nFrance, leaving thirty men behind. After a time they quarreled and\r\nrigged up a worthless boat with which they set sail for home. All would\r\nhave perished, had they not been picked up by an English vessel, which\r\nhumanely landed the feeblest on the coast of France, while the strong\r\nmen were taken to England as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of Ribault to return to America, but civil war was\r\nraging in France, and for a time he was prevented. In April, 1564, three\r\nmore ships set sail to repeat the attempt at colonization. They were\r\nunder the command of Captain Laudonniere, who had been a member of the\r\nformer expedition. He began a settlement at what is now known as St.\r\nJohn's Bluff. The friendly Indians helped and all promised well, but\r\nunfortunately the colonists became dissatisfied and rebelled against the\r\nstrict rule of Laudonniere. Some of the men stole two small vessels and\r\nset sail for the West Indies on a piratical expedition. Laudonniere\r\nhurriedly prepared two larger vessels to pursue them. When they were\r\nready, the malcontents stole them and followed their comrades. Three of\r\nthe buccaneers were captured by the Spanish, while the pilot of the\r\nfourth, who had been pressed into service, steered the vessel back to\r\nthe colony before the rogues suspected what he was doing. Laudonniere\r\nmade them prisoners and hanged the ringleaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF WAR.]\r\n\r\nAt the time when utter ruin impended, Ribault arrived with seven ships\r\nand plenty of supplies. It was at this juncture, when everything\r\npromised well, that Menendez, the Spanish miscreant, as already stated,\r\nappeared with his powerful fleet and attacked the French ships. Three\r\nwere up the river, and the four, being no match for the Spaniards,\r\nescaped by putting to sea. Menendez landed men and supplies further\r\nsouth, learning which Ribault prepared to attack them. Before he could\r\ndo so, a violent tempest scattered his ships. By a laborious march\r\nthrough swamps and thickets, amid a driving storm, Menendez descended\r\nlike a cyclone upon the unprotected French and massacred them all,\r\nincluding the women and children. Another force of French, under solemn\r\npromise of protection, surrendered, but they, too, were put to death.\r\nThey were afterwards avenged by an expedition from France.\r\n\r\nSamuel de Champlain proved himself one of the greatest of French\r\nexplorers. He left the banks of the St. Lawrence at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and discovered the lake which bears his name. His\r\nnumerous excellent maps added much to the knowledge of the country.\r\nJoining De Monts, another explorer, he founded the colony of Port Royal\r\nin Nova Scotia in 1605. This settlement, afterward named Annapolis, was\r\nthe first permanent French colony planted in America. Quebec was founded\r\nby Champlain in 1608.\r\n\r\nThe greatest French explorer, however, was Sieur de la Salle, who was\r\nhardly twenty-three years old when he first visited Canada in 1666.\r\nLeading an expedition westward, he fell ill while in the country of the\r\nSeneca Indians and was forced to part with his companions near the head\r\nof Lake Ontario. When he regained his strength he pressed on to the Ohio\r\nRiver, down which he descended to the falls opposite the present city of\r\nLouisville. Returning to France, he was made a nobleman and appointed\r\ngovernor of the country around Fort Frontenac, which he had planted on\r\nthe shore of Lake Ontario. He demolished the fort and erected a much\r\nstronger one, built four small vessels, and established a thriving trade\r\nwith the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1679, La Salle launched a vessel at the port of Niagara, with\r\nwhich he sailed the length of Lake Erie, across Lakes St. Clair, Huron,\r\nand Michigan to Green Bay. He then sent back his vessel for supplies and\r\ncrossed the lake in canoes to the mouth of the St. Joseph, where he\r\nbuilt a fort. He visited the Indian tribes in the neighborhood and made\r\ntreaties with the chiefs.\r\n\r\nOn the present site of Peoria, he erected a fort in 1680. Then, sending\r\nFather Hennepin to explore the country to the northward, La Salle made\r\nthe entire journey of several hundred miles, alone and on foot, to Fort\r\nFrontenac, where he learned that the vessel he had sent back for\r\nsupplies was lost.\r\n\r\nWith a new party he made his way to the fort planted on the Illinois\r\nRiver, but found it had been broken up and all the white men were gone.\r\nThence La Salle went down the Mississippi to its mouth, where he set up\r\na column with the French arms and proclaimed the country the possession\r\nof the king of France. He was welcomed back to his native land, and when\r\nhe proposed to his ruler to conquer the fine mining country in the\r\nSouthwest, the offer was promptly accepted and he was made commandant.\r\nHe set out with four ships and about 300 persons.\r\n\r\nBut the good fortune that had marked the career of La Salle up to this\r\npoint now set the other way, and disaster and ruin overtook him. His men\r\nwere mostly adventurers and vagabonds, and the officer in command of the\r\nships was an enemy of the explorer. The two quarreled and the vessels\r\nhad gone some distance beyond the mouth of the Mississippi before La\r\nSalle discovered the blunder. He appealed to the captain to return, but\r\nhe refused and anchored off Matagorda Bay. Then the captain decided that\r\nit was necessary to go home for supplies, and sailing away he left La\r\nSalle with only one small vessel which had been presented to him by the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe undaunted explorer erected a fort and began cultivating the soil.\r\nThe Indians, who had not forgotten the cruelty of the Spaniards, were\r\nhostile and continually annoyed the settlers, several of whom were\r\nkilled. Disease carried away others until only forty were left.\r\nSelecting a few, La Salle started for the Illinois country, but had not\r\ngone far when he was treacherously shot by one of his men. The Spaniards\r\nwho had entered the country to drive out the French made prisoners of\r\nthose that remained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From the original drawing made by John White in 1585. By\r\npermission of the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH EXPLORERS.\r\n\r\nNext in order is an account of the English explorations. Going back to\r\nMay, 1553, we find that Sir Hugh Willoughby sailed from London in that\r\nmonth with three ships. At that time, and for many years afterward, the\r\nbelief was general that by sailing to the northwest a shorter route to\r\nIndia could be found, and such was the errand that led the English\r\nnavigator upon his eventful voyage.\r\n\r\nFor two years not the slightest news was heard of Sir Hugh Willoughby.\r\nThen some Russian fishermen, who were in one of the harbors of Lapland,\r\nobserved two ships drifting helplessly in the ice. They rowed out to the\r\nwrecks, and climbing aboard of one entered the cabin where they came\r\nupon an impressive sight. Seated at a table was Sir Hugh Willoughby,\r\nwith his journal open and his pen in hand, as if he had just ceased\r\nwriting. He had been frozen to death months before. Here and there about\r\nhim were stretched the bodies of his crews, all of whom had succumbed to\r\nthe awful temperature of the far North.\r\n\r\nThe third ship was nowhere in sight, and it was believed that she had\r\nbeen crushed in the ice and sunk, but news eventually arrived that she\r\nhad succeeded in reaching Archangel, whence the crew made their way\r\noverland to Moscow. A result of this involuntary journey was that it\r\nopened a new channel for profitable trade.\r\n\r\nStill the _ignis fatuus_ of a shorter route to India tantalized the\r\nearly navigators. The belief was general that the coveted route lay\r\nnorth of our continent. In 1576 Martin Frobisher started on the vain\r\nhunt with three small vessels. He bumped helplessly about in the ice,\r\nbut repeated the effort twice, and on one of his voyages entered the\r\nstrait that bears his name. The region visited by him is valueless to\r\nthe world, and his explorations, therefore, were of no practical benefit\r\nto anyone.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert, in June, 1583, sailed for America with an\r\nimportant expedition which gave every promise of success. In his case,\r\nhowever, disaster overtook him earlier than others. He was hardly out of\r\nsight of land when his most important vessel deserted and went back to\r\nport. The men were a sorry lot, and at Newfoundland he sent another ship\r\nhome with the sick and the mutineers. Of the three vessels remaining,\r\nthe largest was wrecked and all but fifteen drowned. Sir Humphrey was on\r\nthe smallest boat on his way home, when one dark night it foundered,\r\ncarrying down all on board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN VILLAGE ENCLOSED WITH PALISADES. (From the\r\noriginal drawing in the British Museum, made by John White in 1585.)]\r\n\r\nThe famous Sir Walter Raleigh, a half-brother of Gilbert, and a great\r\nfavorite at the court of Queen Elizabeth, was deeply interested in the\r\nplans of his relative, and in April, 1584, sent out two well-equipped\r\nvessels for the purpose of colonization. They brought back a glowing\r\nreport and Raleigh was knighted by the pleased queen, who gave him the\r\nprivilege of naming the new country. He called it Virginia, in honor of\r\nthe virgin Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nA large expedition sailed for the new country in the spring of 1585 and\r\na fort was built on Roanoke Island. But the Englishmen were as greedy\r\nfor gold as the Spaniards, and, instead of cultivating the land, they\r\nspent their time groping for the precious metal. This was suicidal,\r\nbecause the Indians were violently hostile, and would not bring forward\r\nany food for the invaders. All must have perished miserably but for the\r\narrival of Sir Francis Drake, who carried the survivors back to England.\r\n\r\nIt is worth recording that this stay in America resulted in the\r\nEnglishmen learning the use of tobacco, which they introduced into their\r\nown country. Sir Walter Raleigh became a great smoker, and the incident\r\nis familiar of his servant, who, seeing his master smoking a pipe, was\r\nterrified at the belief that he was on fire and dashed a mug of ale over\r\nhim to put out the flames.\r\n\r\nMuch more useful knowledge was that gained of maize or Indian corn, the\r\npotato, and sassafras. They attracted favorable attention in England,\r\nand were gradually introduced to other countries in Europe, where the\r\namount raised is very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST COLONY.\r\n\r\nA strange and romantic interest attaches to the colony which Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh sent out in 1587. It numbered 300 men and women and was in\r\ncharge of John White. While resting at Roanoke, the daughter of Governor\r\nWhite, the wife of Ananias Dare, had a daughter born to her. She was\r\ngiven the name of \"Virginia,\" and was the first child of English\r\nparentage born within the present limits of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR WALTER RALEIGH.]\r\n\r\nThese settlers were as quarrelsome as many of their predecessors and got\r\non ill together. Governor White sailed for England for more immigrants\r\nand supplies, but when he reached that country he found the internal\r\ntroubles so serious that he was kept away from America for three years.\r\nWhen finally he returned to Virginia, he was unable to find a member of\r\nthe colony. On one of the trees was the word \"CROATAN\" cut in the bark,\r\nwhich seemed to indicate that the settlers had removed to a settlement\r\nof that name; but, though long and continuous search was made and many\r\nof the articles belonging to the settlers were recognized, not a person\r\ncould be discovered. Sir Walter Raleigh sent several expeditions with\r\norders to use every effort to clear up the mystery, but it was never\r\nsolved. The story of the \"Lost Colony\" has led to a great deal of\r\ninvestigation and surmise. Two theories have supporters. The most\r\nprobable is that all the settlers were massacred by Indians. Another is\r\nthat they were adopted by the red men and intermarried among them. In\r\nsupport of this supposition is the fact that a long time afterward many\r\nmembers of the adjoining tribes showed unmistakable signs of mixed\r\nblood. There were so-called Indians with blonde hair, blue eyes, and\r\nlight complexion--characteristics never seen among those belonging to\r\nthe genuine American race.\r\n\r\nHolland's explorations in America were less important than those of any\r\nof her rivals. The thrifty Dutchmen were more anxious to secure trade\r\nthan to find new countries, and seemed content to allow others to spend\r\nwealth and precious lives in penetrating to the interior of the New\r\nWorld and in planting settlements, which almost invariably succumbed to\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century a company of English merchants sent out\r\na skillful navigator named Henry Hudson to hunt for the elusive\r\nnorthwest passage. He took with him only eleven men, one of whom was his\r\nson. He made a brave effort to succeed, ploughing his way through the\r\nfrozen regions until he passed the 80th degree of latitude, which was\r\nthe furthest point then attained by man. But, within less than ten\r\ndegrees of the pole, he was forced by the ice to turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE HUDSON RIVER.\r\n\r\nHudson's reputation as a skillful navigator led the wealthy corporation\r\nknown as the Dutch East India Company to seek his services. He was\r\nplaced in command of a small vessel called the _Half Moon_ and ordered\r\nto sail to the northeast instead of the northwest. He did as directed,\r\nbut his experience was similar to his previous one, and, being compelled\r\nto withdraw, he headed westward. Sighting Cape Cod, he named it New\r\nHolland, unaware that it had already been named by Champlain. He\r\ncontinued southward to Chesapeake Bay, where he learned that the English\r\nhad planted a settlement. Turning northward, he entered Delaware Bay,\r\nbut was displeased with the shallow water and sailed again northward. On\r\nSeptember 3, 1609, he dropped anchor opposite Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nHudson now began ascending the magnificent river which bears his name.\r\nAt the end of ten days he had reached a point opposite the present site\r\nof Albany. The Indians were friendly and curious. Many of them put out\r\nin their canoes and were made welcome on board the little Dutch vessel,\r\nwhich was a source of constant wonderment to them, for they had never\r\nseen anything of the kind before.\r\n\r\nDescending the stream, Hudson made his way to Dartmouth, England, from\r\nwhich point he sent an account of his discovery to Holland. That country\r\nlost no time in claiming sovereignty over the new territory, the claim\r\nbeing so valid that no other nation could legitimately dispute it.\r\n\r\nHudson's achievement added to his fame, and he was once more sent in\r\nsearch of the northwest passage. He entered the bay and strait which\r\nbear his name, and passed a winter in that terrible region. In the\r\nfollowing spring his crew mutinied, and, placing the navigator, his son,\r\nand several members in an open boat, set them adrift, and none of them\r\nwas ever heard of again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seal of The Virginia Company.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF THE THIRTEEN ORIGINAL STATES.\r\n\r\n_Virginia_,--Founding of Jamestown--Captain John Smith--Introduction of\r\nAfrican Slavery--Indian Wars--Bacon's Rebellion--Forms of\r\nGovernment--Prosperity--Education--_New England_,--Plymouth--Massachusetts\r\nBay Colony--Union of the Colonies--Religious Persecution--King Philip's\r\nWar--The Witchcraft Delusion--_New Hampshire_,--_The Connecticut Colony_,\r\n--_The New Haven Colony_,--Union of the Colonies--Indian Wars--The Charter\r\nOak--_Rhode Island_,--Different Forms of Government--_New York_,--The\r\nDutch and English Settlers--_New Jersey_,--_Delaware_,--_Pennsylvania_,\r\n--_Maryland_,--Mason and Dixon's Line--_The Carolinas_--_Georgia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the seventeenth century there was not a single English\r\nsettlement on this side of the Atlantic. It has been shown that the\r\nFrench succeeded in planting colonies in Canada, that of De Monts, in\r\n1605, in Acadia (the French name of Nova Scotia), proving successful,\r\nwhile Champlain founded Quebec three years later. St. Augustine,\r\nFlorida, was founded by the Spanish in 1565, but it has played an\r\ninsignificant part in our history. England was the mother of the\r\ncolonies, from which the original thirteen States sprang, and we are\r\nvastly more indebted to her than to all other nations combined.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ENGLISH SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1606, when James I. was king of England, he gave a charter\r\nor patent to a number of gentlemen, which made them the owners of all\r\nthat part of America lying between the thirty-fourth and thirty-eighth\r\ndegrees of north latitude. The men who received this gift associated\r\nthemselves together under the name of the London Company, and in the\r\nsame year sent out three vessels, carrying 105 men, but no women or\r\nchildren. A storm drove them out of their course, and, in the month of\r\nMay, they entered the mouth of a broad river, which they named the\r\nJames in honor of their king. They sailed up stream for fifty miles,\r\nand, on the 13th of May, 1607, began the settlement of Jamestown, which\r\nwas the first English colony successfully planted in America. Everything\r\nlooked promising, but the trouble was that the men did not wish to work,\r\nand, instead of cultivating the soil, spent their time in hunting for\r\ngold which did not exist anywhere near them. They were careless in their\r\nmanner of living and a great many fell ill and died. They must have\r\nperished before long had they not been wise enough to elect Captain John\r\nSmith president or ruler of the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN SMITH AND HIS ADVENTURES.\r\n\r\nThis man is one of the most interesting characters in the early history\r\nof our country. He was a great boaster, and most of his associates did\r\nnot like him. He had been a wanderer in many parts of the world, and had\r\nany number of stories to tell of his wonderful adventures. Probably some\r\nof those stories were true and many fiction. Be that as it may, he was\r\nan energetic and brave man, and the very one to save the perishing\r\nsettlers. He made every man work, and none wrought harder than himself.\r\nAs a consequence matters began to mend at once.\r\n\r\nObeying his orders in London, Captain Smith, when it seemed prudent to\r\ndo so, spent much of his time in exploring the streams that flowed into\r\nthe James. It must not be forgotten that it was still believed in Europe\r\nthat America formed a part of Asia, and that no one needed to penetrate\r\nfar into the interior to reach that country.\r\n\r\nOn one of these voyages Captain Smith was taken prisoner by the Indians,\r\nwho led him before their chief Powhatan. The chief decided that he must\r\nbe put to death, and, with his hands tied together, he was placed on the\r\nground, with his head resting on two big stones. Then one of the\r\nwarriors stepped forward to dash out his brains with a club. At that\r\nmoment Pocahontas, the young daughter of the chief, ran forward, and,\r\nthrowing her arms around the head of Smith, begged her father to spare\r\nhis life. The chief consented, and the prisoner was set free and\r\nreturned to Jamestown. Such is the story which Captain Smith told after\r\nthe death of Pocahontas in England, which she had visited with her\r\nhusband, an Englishman named Rolfe, and it can never be known whether\r\nthe incident was true or not. Some years later Smith was so badly\r\ninjured by the explosion of gunpowder that he had to return to England\r\nfor treatment. There he died in 1631. His invaluable services in this\r\ncountry have led historians to regard him as the saviour of the Virginia\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POCAHONTAS SAVING THE LIFE OF JOHN SMITH.]\r\n\r\nThe most woeful blow that was struck the American colonies was in\r\nAugust, 1619, when a Dutch ship sailed up the James and sold twenty\r\nnegroes, kidnapped in Africa, to the colonists as slaves. It was thus\r\nthat African slavery was introduced into this country, bringing in its\r\ntrain more sorrow, suffering, desolation, and death than pen can\r\ndescribe or imagination conceive. The institution became legal in all\r\nthe colonies, and the ships of New England, as well as those of old\r\nEngland, were actively engaged for many years in the slave trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS.]\r\n\r\nWARS WITH THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Pocahontas to one of the settlers made her father a firm\r\nfriend of the whites as long as he lived. At his death, his brother\r\nOpechankano succeeded him. He hated intensely the invaders of the\r\nhunting grounds, and began plotting to exterminate them. On the 22d of\r\nMarch, 1622, he made such a sudden and furious assault upon the\r\nplantations, as the farms were called, along the James that 400 people\r\nwere killed in one day. The settlers rallied, slew many of the Indians\r\nand drove the remainder far back in the woods, but by the time this was\r\naccomplished half of the 4,000 settlers were dead and the eighty\r\nplantations were reduced to eight.\r\n\r\nOpechankano was not crushed, and for more than twenty years he busied\r\nhimself in perfecting his plans for a greater and more frightful\r\nmassacre. It was in April, 1644, that he struck his second blow, killing\r\nbetween three and four hundred of the settlers. Once more the Virginians\r\nrenewed the war of extermination, and pressed it mercilessly until the\r\nIndians sued for peace, gave a large tract of land to their conquerors,\r\nand retired still further into the wilderness. It is worth noting that\r\nat the time of this last massacre Opechankano was nearly a hundred years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACON'S REBELLION.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkeley was the most bigoted ruler Virginia ever had. In\r\none of his messages, he thanked God that there were no free schools or\r\nprinting in his province. He was very tyrannous, and, having friends in\r\nthe assembly, they prevented the election of any new members from 1666\r\nto 1676. The taxes became intolerable, and trade fell into the hands of\r\na few individuals. Not only that, but the governor disbanded the troops\r\nwhich had gathered for protection against the Indians, who renewed their\r\nattacks on the exposed plantations.\r\n\r\nThis was more than the people could stand, and they rose in rebellion\r\nunder the leadership of Nathaniel Bacon, a popular young planter, who\r\nhad lost several members of his family through the attacks of the\r\nIndians. Berkeley was cowed for a time, but the arrival of some ships\r\nfrom England enabled him to take the field against Bacon. During the\r\ncivil war, Jamestown was burned to the ground and never rebuilt. Bacon\r\npressed his resistance so vigorously that his success seemed certain,\r\nwhen unfortunately he fell ill and died. Left without a leader, the\r\nrebellion crumbled to pieces. The exultant Berkeley punished the\r\nleading rebels without mercy. He hanged twenty-two, and was so ferocious\r\nthat the king lost patience and ordered him to return to England. \"The\r\nold fool!\" he exclaimed; \"he has taken away more lives in that naked\r\ncountry than I did for the murder of my father.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPERITY OF THE COLONY.\r\n\r\nColonial Virginia underwent several changes in its form of government. A\r\n\"Great Charter\" was granted to it in 1613 by the London Company. This\r\npermitted the settlers to make their own laws. The House of Burgesses,\r\nwhich was called together at Jamestown by Governor Yeardley, July 30,\r\n1619, was the first legislative body that ever met in this country. King\r\nJames was dissatisfied with the tendency of things, and in 1624 he took\r\naway the charter and granted a new one, which allowed the colony to\r\nelect the members of the House of Burgesses, while the king appointed\r\nthe council and their governor. This made Virginia a royal province,\r\nwhich she remained until the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMOR WORN BY THE PILGRIMS IN 1620.]\r\n\r\nVirginia became very prosperous. Immense quantities of tobacco were\r\nraised and sent to England and Holland, where it became widely popular.\r\nIts cultivation was so profitable in the colony that for a time little\r\nelse was cultivated. It was planted even along the streets of Jamestown\r\nand became the money of the province. Everything was paid for in so many\r\npounds of tobacco. The population steadily increased, and in 1715 was\r\n95,000, which was the same as that of Massachusetts. A half-century\r\nlater, Virginia was the richest and most important of the thirteen\r\ncolonies. The people lived mostly on large plantations, for land was\r\nplentiful and the Indians gave no further trouble. Most of the\r\ninhabitants were members of the Church of England, and their assemblies\r\npassed severe laws against the entrance of people of other religious\r\nbeliefs into the colony. It required the furnace blasts of the\r\nRevolution to purify Virginia and some other provinces of this spirit of\r\nintolerance.\r\n\r\nEducation was neglected or confined to the rich who could send their\r\nchildren to England to be educated. Some of the early schools were\r\ndestroyed by Indians, but William and Mary College, founded in 1692, was\r\nthe second college in the United States. It was never a very strong\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"OLD DOMINION.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth recording how Virginia received the name of the \"Old\r\nDominion.\" She remained loyal to Charles I. throughout the civil war in\r\nEngland which ended in the beheading of the king. She was true also to\r\nCharles II. when he was a fugitive and declared an outlaw. While in\r\nexile, he sent Governor Berkeley his commission as Governor of Virginia,\r\nand that ruler was immensely pleased. The king, to show his appreciation\r\nof the loyalty of his colony, made public declaration that Virginia\r\nadded a fifth country to his kingdom, making it consist of England,\r\nScotland, France, Ireland, and Virginia, and he devised as an addition\r\nto the motto of the English coat of arms, \"_En dat Virginia quintam_\"\r\n(\"Lo! Virginia gives the fifth\"). While Cromwell was turning things\r\ntopsy-turvy in England, a great many of the best families among the\r\nRoyalists emigrated to Virginia, where they were received with open arms\r\nby Governor Berkeley and the owners of the plantations. From this arose\r\nthe name \"Old Dominion,\" which is often applied to Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PILGRIMS AT PLYMOUTH.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of Virginia there was bitter persecution in\r\nEngland of those whose religious views differed from the Church of\r\nEngland. This cruelty drove many people to other countries, and because\r\nof their wanderings they were called \"Pilgrims.\" Those who remained\r\nmembers of the English church and used their efforts to purify it of\r\nwhat they believed to be loose and pernicious doctrines were nicknamed\r\n\"Puritans.\" Those who withdrew from the membership of the church were\r\ntermed \"Separatists\" or \"Independents.\" This distinction is often\r\nconfounded by writers and readers.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and two Pilgrims, all Separatists, who had fled to Holland,\r\ndid not like the country, and decided to make their homes in the New\r\nWorld, where they could worship God as their consciences dictated. They\r\nsailed in the _Mayflower_, and, after a long and stormy passage, landed\r\nat Plymouth, Massachusetts, December 21, 1620, in the midst of a\r\nblinding snowstorm.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims were hardy, industrious, and God-fearing, and were prepared\r\nto face every kind of danger and suffering without murmur. They were\r\nseverely austere in their morals and conduct, and, when writhing in the\r\npangs of starvation, maintained their faith unshaken in the wisdom and\r\ngoodness of their Heavenly Father. All these admirable qualities were\r\nneeded during the awful winter, which was one of the severest ever known\r\nin New England. They built log-houses, using oiled paper instead of\r\nglass for the windows, and in the spring were able to buy corn of the\r\nIndians, who pitied their sufferings, for in the space of a few weeks\r\none-half of the Pilgrims had died. At one time there were but seven well\r\npersons in the colony. Among those who passed away was John Carver, the\r\nfirst governor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING OF MYLES STANDISH.]\r\n\r\nThe survivors held their ground with grim heroism, and by-and-by other\r\nimmigrants arrived, and the growth and prosperity, though slow, was\r\ncertain. It had no charter, but was governed by an agreement which had\r\nbeen drawn up and signed in the cabin of the _Mayflower_, about the time\r\nthe bleak coast of New England was sighted. For sixty years after the\r\nsettlement of Plymouth, its history was uneventful. It was never very\r\nlarge, but the real work which it accomplished was in bringing\r\nthousands of other colonists to follow it to New England, who were\r\nopponents of the Established Church, and who gave to that section of our\r\ncountry a distinctive character of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYLES STANDISH.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting coincidence that while Virginia had her Captain\r\nJohn Smith, Plymouth possessed a character quite similar in the person\r\nof Captain Myles Standish. He was the military leader of the colony,\r\nwith a courage that was absolutely fearless. He has been described as a\r\nvery small man, with a \"long, yellow beard,\" and a temper as inflammable\r\nas gunpowder. Nothing would rouse his anger sooner than to hear any slur\r\nupon his stature. A big, hulking Indian, belonging to a party much\r\nlarger than Standish's, once looked down upon the diminutive Englishman,\r\nand, with a curl of his lip, referred to him as too small to fight. The\r\nnext day, in a fight that arose with the chiefs, Standish killed the\r\ninsulting Indian with his own knife. All readers are familiar with the\r\nbeautiful poem of Longfellow, which tells how Standish employed John\r\nAlden to woo Priscilla, the \"loveliest maid of Plymouth,\" for him, and\r\nhe did it with such success that Alden won her for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony included the part of the present State of\r\nMassachusetts from the neighborhood of Boston northward. It was founded\r\nby Puritans, who, it will be remembered, had not separated wholly from\r\nthe Church of England, but opposed many of its ceremonies. In the civil\r\nwar with England they sided with the Parliament and were subjected to\r\nthe same persecution as the Separatists. In 1628 a number of wealthy\r\nPuritans bought the territory from the Council of Plymouth, and,\r\nreceiving a charter the following year from Charles I., sent small\r\ncolonies across the Atlantic. Then the company itself followed, taking\r\nwith it the charter and officers, thus gaining a colony in America that\r\nwas wholly independent of England. Salem and some other small\r\nsettlements had previously been made.\r\n\r\nThe colony was one of the most important that ever settled in this\r\ncountry. Its leaders were not only of the best character, but were\r\nwealthy, wise, and far-seeing. A large number arrived in 1630, and\r\nfounded Boston, Cambridge, Lynn, and other towns. Although they suffered\r\nmany privations, they were not so harsh as those of Plymouth, and the\r\ncolony prospered. During the ten years succeeding 1630, 20,000 people\r\nsettled in Massachusetts, and in 1692 the two colonies united under the\r\nname of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that since these people had fled to America to escape\r\nreligious persecution, they would have been tolerant of the views of\r\nthose among them, but such unhappily was not the case. The most\r\nimportant part of their work was the building of churches and the\r\nestablishment of religious instruction. The minister was the most\r\nimportant man in the colony, and no one was allowed to vote unless a\r\nmember of the church. A reproof in church was considered the most\r\ndisgraceful penalty that could be visited upon a wrong-doer. The sermons\r\nwere two, three, and sometimes four hours long, and the business of one\r\nof the officers was to watch those overcome by drowsiness and wake them\r\nup, sometimes quite sharply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING PHILIP'S WAR--DEATH OF THE KING.]\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.\r\n\r\nRoger Williams, a Baptist preacher, told the Puritans, as the people\r\ncame generally to be called, that they did wrong to take the land from\r\nthe Indians without paying for it, and that a person was answerable to\r\nGod alone for his belief. These charges were answered by the banishment\r\nof Williams from the colony. All the Baptists were expelled in 1635.\r\nShortly afterward, Anne Hutchinson boldly preached the doctrine of\r\nAntinomianism, which declares that a man is not saved by the help of\r\ngood works, but by divine grace alone. In other words, no matter how\r\nwickedly he lives, his salvation is wholly independent of it. She went\r\nto Rhode Island and afterward to New Netherland, where she was killed in\r\none of the attacks of the Indians upon the Dutch settlements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROGER WILLIAMS IN BANISHMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe Quakers greatly annoyed the New England colonists. They persisted in\r\nrising in the Puritan meetings and disputing with ministers. Many were\r\nfined, whipped, imprisoned, and banished, but in the face of warnings\r\nthey returned. As a consequence, four were put to death. Then a reaction\r\nset in and the persecution ceased.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable war in which the early colonies of New England were\r\ninvolved was with King Philip, who was the son of Massasoit, a firm\r\nfriend of the settlers until his death. Philip was one of the great\r\nIndians of history. Like many of his people he saw with anger the growth\r\nof the white men, who in time would drive him and his warriors from\r\ntheir hunting grounds. Realizing the magnitude of the work of\r\nexterminating all the settlers, he visited the different tribes and used\r\nevery effort to unite them in a war against the invaders. He was partly\r\nsuccessful, and, with the allies secured, King Philip began the war by\r\nattacking a party of settlers at Swansea, on Sunday, June 24, 1675,\r\nwhile they were on their way to church. Several whites were killed, when\r\nthe Indians hurried off to the Connecticut Valley to continue their\r\ndreadful work.\r\n\r\nAll understood their peril, and flew to arms. Every man carried his\r\nmusket to church, and they were stacked outside the door, while a\r\nsentinel paced up and down. More than once the long sermon was\r\ninterrupted by the crack of the red men's guns and their wild whoops, as\r\nthey swarmed out of the woods. Springing down from the pulpit, the\r\nminister was among the foremost in beating the heathen back, and, when\r\nquiet was restored, probably he resumed and finished his sermon.\r\n\r\nThe war was prosecuted furiously on both sides. In the depth of winter,\r\nwhen the snow lay several feet on the ground, John Winslow led 1,500 men\r\nagainst the Narragansett stronghold, which was in the heart of a great\r\nswamp, and was one of the most powerful fortifications ever erected by\r\nthe red men on this continent. In the terrible fight, 200 white men and\r\nnearly 1,000 Indians were killed. Finally, Philip was run down in a\r\nswamp near his old home on Mount Hope, not far from the present city of\r\nBristol, Rhode Island. While stealing out of his hiding-place, he was\r\nconfronted by a white soldier and a friendly Indian. The gun of the\r\nformer missed fire, whereupon the Indian leveled his musket and shot the\r\nWampanoag leader dead. The war ended a few months later. During its\r\ncontinuance, six hundred white men were killed and many more wounded;\r\nthirteen towns were destroyed and five hundred buildings burned, but the\r\nIndian power in southern New England was shattered forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITCHCRAFT DELUSION.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fearful delusions recorded in history is that of the\r\ngeneral belief in witchcraft which prevailed in Europe down to the\r\nseventeenth century. Its baleful shadow all too soon fell upon New\r\nEngland. Massachusetts and Connecticut made laws against witchcraft and\r\nhanged a number of persons on the charge of being witches. In 1692 the\r\ntown of Salem went crazy over the belief that the diabolical spirits\r\nwere at work among them. Two little girls, who were simpletons that\r\nought to have been spanked and put to bed, declared with bulging eyes\r\nthat different persons had taken the form of a black cat and pinched,\r\nscratched, and bitten them. The people, including the great preacher\r\nCotton Mather, believed this stuff, and the supposed wizards and witches\r\nwere punished with fearful severity. Suspicion in many cases meant\r\ndeath; evil men disposed of their creditors and enemies by charging them\r\nwith witchcraft; families were divided and the gentlest and most\r\nirreproachable of women suffered disgraceful death. Everybody, including\r\nministers and judges, lost their wits. The magistrates crowded the\r\njails, until twenty had been put to death and fifty-five tortured before\r\nthe craze subsided. Then it became clear that no one, no matter what his\r\nstation, was safe, and the delusion, which forms one of the blackest\r\npages in New England, passed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLUP'S RECAPTURE OF OLDHAM'S BOAT\r\n\r\nWhich had been taken by the Indians from the Puritan exiles in 1636.\r\n\"Steer straight for the vessel,\" cried Gallup, and stationing himself at\r\nthe bow he opened fire on the Indians. Every time his gun flashed some\r\none was hit. This incident was the beginning of the Pequot War.]\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire was the name of John Mason's share of a territory granted\r\nto him and Sir Fernando Gorges by the Council of Plymouth in 1622. This\r\ngrant included all the land between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers.\r\nThe first settlement was made in 1623, at New and at Little Harbor, near\r\nPortsmouth. In 1629 the proprietors divided their grants, the country\r\nwest of the Piscataqua being taken by Mason, who named it New Hampshire,\r\nwhile Gorges, who owned the eastern section, called it Maine.\r\n\r\nThe settlements were weak and their growth tardy. In 1641 New Hampshire\r\nplaced itself under the protection of Massachusetts, but the king\r\nseparated them in 1679, and made New Hampshire a royal colony. In 1688\r\nit again joined Massachusetts, and three years later was set off once\r\nmore by the king, after which it remained a royal colony until the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONNECTICUT COLONY.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut colony included all of the present State of Connecticut,\r\nexcepting a few townships on the shore of Long Island Sound. It came\r\ninto the possession of the Earl of Warwick in 1630, and the following\r\nyear he transferred it to Lords Say, Brooke, and others. The Dutch\r\nclaimed the territory and erected a fort on the Connecticut River to\r\nkeep out the English. The latter, however, paid no attention to them,\r\nand a number of Massachusetts traders settled at Windsor in 1633.\r\nSaybrook, at the mouth of the Connecticut, was settled in 1635. A great\r\nmany emigrants came from Massachusetts in 1636, the principal leader\r\nbeing Thomas Hooker. They founded Weathersfield, Windsor, and Hartford,\r\nand in 1639 adopted the name of the Connecticut colony and drew up a\r\nwritten constitution, the first ever framed by a body of men for their\r\nown government. Other settlements were made and Saybrook united with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe most eventful incident in the history of Connecticut was the war\r\nwith the Pequot Indians, who were a powerful tribe in the eastern part\r\nof the State. They tried to persuade the Narragansetts to join them, but\r\nRoger Williams, who lived among them, persuaded Canonicus, their chief,\r\nto refuse. Then the Pequots committed the fatal mistake of going to war\r\nalone. The settlers, fully roused to their danger, assailed the Pequot\r\nstronghold with fury, one summer morning in 1637, and killed all their\r\nenemies, sparing neither women nor children. Thus a leading tribe of\r\nIndians were blotted out in one day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW HAVEN COLONY.\r\n\r\nThe New Haven colony comprised the townships already referred to as\r\nlying on Long Island Sound. It was settled in 1638 by a company of\r\nEnglish immigrants, who were sufficiently wise and just to buy the lands\r\nof the Indians. Other towns were settled, and in 1639 the group took the\r\nname of the New Haven colony. Neither of the colonies had a charter, and\r\nthere was much rivalry in the efforts to absorb the towns as they were\r\nsettled. The majority preferred to join the Connecticut colony, for the\r\nother, like Massachusetts, would permit no one not a member of church to\r\nvote or hold office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMITIVE MODE OF GRINDING CORN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONY OF CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\nWhat is known in the history of England as the Commonwealth,\r\nestablished by Cromwell, came to an end in 1660. Charles II. ascended\r\nthe throne, and Winthrop, governor of the Connecticut colony, which had\r\nnow grown to be the stronger of the two, went to England to secure a\r\ncharter. It was granted to him in 1662, and covered the territory\r\noccupied by both colonies, who were permitted to elect their assembly,\r\ntheir governor, and to rule themselves. New Haven, after deliberating\r\nover the question, reluctantly accepted the charter, and in 1665 the two\r\nwere united under the name of the Colony of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nEverything was going along smoothly, when, in 1687, Governor Andros came\r\ndown with a company of soldiers from Boston and ordered the people to\r\nsurrender their charter. He was acting under the orders of the king, who\r\ndid not fancy the independence with which the colony was conducting\r\nmatters. Andros confronted the assembly, which were called together in\r\nHartford. They begged that he would not enforce his demands. He\r\nconsented to listen to their arguments, though there was not the\r\nslightest probability of it producing any effect upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARTER OAK.\r\n\r\nThe talk continued until dark, when the candles were lighted. Suddenly,\r\nat a signal, all were blown out. When they were re-lighted, the charter,\r\nwhich had been lying on the table in plain sight, was nowhere to be\r\nfound. Captain Wadsworth had slipped out during the interval of darkness\r\nand hidden the paper in the hollow of an oak. Then he returned and took\r\nhis place among the members, looking the most innocent of all. Andros\r\nfumed and raved and informed the assembly that their trick would avail\r\nthem nothing, since their charter government was at an end. He went back\r\nto Boston, to be turned out of office two years later, when the precious\r\ncharter was brought from its hiding-place.\r\n\r\nNo effort was spared to preserve the historical \"Charter Oak,\" that had\r\nthus been made famous. It was supported and propped in every part that\r\nshowed signs of weakness, and held up its head until 1856, when a\r\nterrific storm brought it to the ground, shattered to fragments, all of\r\nwhich were carefully gathered and preserved by those fortunate enough to\r\nobtain them.\r\n\r\nThe early division of the colonies was long marked by the fact that\r\nHartford and New Haven served as the two capitals of the State until\r\n1873, when Hartford became the sole capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that when Roger Williams was banished from\r\nMassachusetts he took refuge among the Narragansett Indians, who\r\noccupied the country at the head of Narragansett Bay. Canonicus, the\r\nchief, held the good man in high esteem, and presented him with a large\r\ntract of land, which the devout Williams named \"Providence\" in\r\nremembrance of the manner in which he believed God had directed him\r\nthither. Settlers from Massachusetts followed him, and all were\r\nhospitably received and kindly treated. The fullest religious liberty\r\nwas allowed, and even when Anne Hutchinson visited Williams, he treated\r\nher like a sister. Williams obtained a charter in 1644 from the\r\nParliament and it was confirmed in 1654. The new one granted by Charles\r\nII. in 1663 united all the colonies into one, under the name Rhode\r\nIsland and Providence Plantations. This is still the legal name of the\r\nState, which retains its two capitals, Providence and Newport, the\r\nLegislature meeting alternately in each. The charter of Charles II.\r\nsuited the people so well that it remained in force until 1842, when\r\nThomas Dorr headed a rebellion, as related hereafter, which resulted in\r\nthe establishment of a new charter.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Rhode Island was threatened by the claim of Connecticut\r\nto all the land on the west to the shore of Narragansett Bay, while\r\nPlymouth insisted that the land on the east to the shore of the same bay\r\nbelonged to her. Rhode Island stoutly resisted, and succeeded in 1741\r\nand 1752 in fixing her boundaries as they are to-day, which make her the\r\nsmallest State in the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that Holland was more anxious to secure trade than\r\nterritory. Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, by Captain Henry\r\nHudson, the Dutch traders sent vessels to Manhattan Island, now\r\nconstituting the city of New York, and began bartering with the Indians.\r\nIn 1621 Holland granted the territory from Delaware Bay to the\r\nConnecticut River to the Dutch West India Company. The name given to the\r\nterritory was New Netherland, while the settlement, which grew in time\r\ninto the metropolis of America, was called New Amsterdam. The whole\r\nisland was bought from the Indians for sixty guilders, equal to about\r\ntwenty-four dollars, a price which is considerably less than would be\r\ndemanded to-day for the site of Greater New York.\r\n\r\nNew Netherland was governed successively by Peter Minuet, Walter Van\r\nTwiller, William Kieft, and Peter Stuyvesant, who were sent out by the\r\nDutch West India Company, and whose rule extended from 1626 to 1664. Of\r\nthese, Stuyvesant was by far the ablest, and he made a strong impression\r\non the social and political life of New Netherland. He was severe and\r\nstubborn, however, and many of the Dutchmen found his rule so onerous\r\nthat they were rather pleased than otherwise, when the English, in 1664,\r\nclaimed the territory by right of discovery and sent out a fleet which\r\ncompelled Stuyvesant to surrender the town. The doughty old governor\r\nstamped about New Amsterdam with his wooden leg, calling upon his\r\ncountrymen to rally and drive back the rascals, but little or no heed\r\nwas paid to his appeals.\r\n\r\nCharles II. had granted the territory to his brother the Duke of York,\r\nwho soon after ascended the throne, thus making the colony, which\r\nincluded that of New Jersey, a royal one. The Connecticut people had\r\nsettled a large part of Rhode Island, which they claimed, but the duke\r\nwas too powerful to be resisted, and Long Island became a part of New\r\nYork, as the city and province were named.\r\n\r\nIn 1673, while at war with England, Holland sent a fleet which\r\nrecaptured New York, but it was given back to England, upon the signing\r\nof a treaty in 1674. The manner in which New Netherland was settled by\r\nthe Dutch was quite different from that of New England. Wealthy men,\r\ntermed \"patroons,\" were granted immense tracts of laud and brought over\r\nsettlers, whose situation was much like that of the serfs of Russia.\r\nTraces of the patroon system remained long after the Revolution, and, in\r\n1846, caused the \"Anti-Rent War,\" which resulted in the death of a\r\nnumber of people.\r\n\r\nThe province of New York suffered greatly from misrule. The people were\r\nnot permitted to elect their own assembly until 1683, and two years\r\nlater, when the Duke of York became king, he took away the privilege.\r\nWilliam and Mary, however, restored it in 1691, and it remained to the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the bad governorship of New York, it may be said that\r\nthere is good reason to believe that one of its rulers was interested\r\nwith the pirates who infested the coast, while another, who refused to\r\nsign the death-warrant of two persons who had committed no serious\r\ncrime, was made drunk and then persuaded to sign the fatal paper. When\r\nhe became sober, he was horrified to find that both had been executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM KIDD, THE PIRATE.\r\n\r\nThe piracy alluded to became such a scandalous blight that strenuous\r\nmeasures were taken to crush it. In 1697 Captain William Kidd, a New\r\nYork shipmaster and a brave and skillful navigator, was sent to assist\r\nin the work. After he had cruised for a while in distant waters, he\r\nturned pirate himself. He had the effrontery to return home three years\r\nlater, believing his friends would protect him; but, though they would\r\nhave been willing enough to do so, they dared not. He was arrested,\r\ntried in England, convicted, and hanged. Piracy was finally driven from\r\nthe American waters in 1720.\r\n\r\nIn 1740 New York was thrown into a panic by the report that the negroes\r\nhad formed a plot to burn the town. It is scarcely possible that any\r\nsuch plot existed, but before the scare had passed away four whites and\r\neighteen negroes were hanged, and, dreadful as it may sound, fourteen\r\nnegroes were burned at the stake. In addition, nearly a hundred were\r\ndriven out of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe fine harbor and noble river emptying into it gave New York such\r\nadvantages that, by 1750, it had become one of the most important\r\ncities on the coast, though its population was less than that of\r\nPhiladelphia. At the time named, its inhabitants numbered about 12,000,\r\nwhich was less than that of Philadelphia. The province itself contained\r\n90,000 inhabitants. The chief towns were New York, Albany, and Kingston.\r\nBrooklyn, which attained vast proportions within the following century,\r\nwas merely a ferry station.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, as has been stated, was originally a part of New Netherland.\r\nAs early as 1618, the Dutch erected a trading post at Bergen. All now\r\nincluded in the State was granted, in 1664, by the Duke of York to Lord\r\nJohn Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. Carteret was once governor of the\r\nisland of Jersey in the English Channel, and gave the name to the new\r\nprovince. In the year mentioned, the first English settlement was made\r\nat Elizabethtown, now known as Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST FRIENDS' MEETING-HOUSE, BURLINGTON, NEW\r\nJERSEY.]\r\n\r\nIn 1674, the province was divided into East and West Jersey, a\r\ndistinction which is preserved to some extent to the present day.\r\nBerkeley, who owned West Jersey, sold it to a number of Quakers, some of\r\nwhom settled near Burlington. Carteret sold his part to William Penn and\r\neleven other Quakers. The various changes of ownership caused much\r\ntrouble with the land titles. In 1702, all the proprietors surrendered\r\ntheir rights to the crown and New Jersey became a royal colony. The same\r\ngovernor ruled New York and New Jersey, though those in the latter\r\nelected their own assembly. A complete separation from New York took\r\nplace in 1738, and New Jersey remained a royal province until the\r\nRevolution. Its location averted all troubles with the Indians. Newark,\r\nthe principal city, was settled in 1666, by emigrants from Connecticut.\r\nBurlington, founded in 1677, was one of the capitals and Perth Amboy the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, THE GOOD AND WISE RULER.]\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nIn 1638, a number of Swedes formed the settlement of Christina on the\r\nDelaware, near Wilmington. They bought the land from the Indians and\r\nnamed it New Sweden. A second settlement, that of Chester, was made just\r\nbelow the site of Philadelphia in 1643, and was the first in the present\r\nState of Pennsylvania. The fiery Governor Stuyvesant of New\r\nNetherland looked upon these attempts as impudent invasions of his\r\nterritory, and, filled with anger, hurried down to Delaware and captured\r\nboth. It was a matter of no moment to the thrifty Swedes, who kept on\r\nthe even tenor of their way and throve under the new government as well\r\nas under the old. A further account of the settlement of Delaware will\r\nbe given in our history of that of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTABLE AUDIENCE IN MARYLAND TO HEAR GEORGE FOX, THE\r\nFOUNDER OF THE \"SOCIETY OF FRIENDS\" OR QUAKERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nThe peace-loving Quakers were among those who suffered persecution in\r\nEngland for conscience sake. William Penn was the son of Admiral Penn,\r\nwho disliked the Quakers and had been a valiant officer for the English\r\ngovernment. When he died, the crown owed him a large sum of money, which\r\nWilliam offered to liquidate in return for a grant of the land now known\r\nas the State of Pennsylvania. The king willingly agreed to this, and the\r\nDuke of York, who had a strong liking for Penn, added the present State\r\nof Delaware to the grant, in which, as has been stated, the Swedes had\r\nmade a number of settlements.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn was one of the best and wisest rulers that had to do with\r\nthe settlement of our country. The king, more as a piece of pleasantry\r\nthan otherwise, insisted upon naming the province \"Pennsylvania,\" in\r\nhonor of the proprietor, much to the good man's dismay. He offered the\r\nroyal secretary a liberal fee to omit the first part of the name from\r\nthe charter, but it was not done. No rule could have been more kindly.\r\nAbsolute freedom of conscience was permitted; in all trials by jury of\r\nan Indian, one-half of the jury were to be composed of Indians, and,\r\nalthough Penn was induced to permit the punishment of death for treason\r\nand murder, to be provided for in the code, no man was ever executed\r\nwhile Penn had anything to do with the province.\r\n\r\nHis first act, after his arrival in 1682, was characteristic. He called\r\nthe Indian chiefs together, under a great spreading elm at Shackamaxon,\r\nand paid them for the land that was already his by royal grant. In\r\naddition, he made the red men many presents and signed a treaty, which\r\nneither party broke for sixty years. It has been truly said that this\r\nwas the only treaty not sworn to which was kept inviolate by both\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nPenn himself laid out the city of Philadelphia in 1683. A year later, it\r\nhad a population of 7,000, and in three years more its population\r\nincreased faster than that of New York in half a century. Delaware, then\r\ncalled the \"Three Lower Counties,\" was given a separate government at\r\nthe request of the people in 1703. They were allowed their own deputy\r\ngovernor, but Pennsylvania and Delaware continued substantially under\r\none government until the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe good ruler met with many misfortunes. In 1692, the province was\r\ntaken from him, because of his friendship to James II., but restored\r\nsoon afterward. In 1699, when he made his second visit, he found the\r\npeople had in a great measure grown away from him, and were unwilling\r\nthat he should exercise his former supervision. While absent, a\r\ndishonest steward robbed him of nearly all his property in England; and,\r\nfailing in health and mind, he died in 1718. His sons became\r\nproprietors, but the people grew more and more discontented with the\r\npayment of rents. To end the disputes and quarrels, the State abolished\r\nthe rents during the Revolution, paying the proprietors the sum of\r\n$650,000 for the extinguishment of their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was prosperous from the first. New York City did not catch\r\nup to it until after the year 1810. It was early noted, as it has been\r\nsince, for its cleanliness, fine buildings, and the attention it gave to\r\neducation. It had a printing press in 1686, and three years later a\r\npublic high school. In the year 1749, the present University of\r\nPennsylvania was founded as a school, becoming a college in 1755, and a\r\nuniversity in 1779. Many of the names of streets, such as Walnut,\r\nChestnut, Pine, Mulberry, and others, were given to it when the city was\r\nlaid out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORAVIAN EASTER SERVICE, BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA.]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the province was confined for a long time to the\r\neastern section. No population was more varied. The Scotch and Irish\r\nwere mainly in the central portion, the Dutch and Germans in the east\r\nand northeast, and the English in the southeastern part of the colony.\r\nThere are hundreds of people to-day in Pennsylvania, whose ancestors for\r\nseveral generations have been born there, who are unable to speak or\r\nunderstand a word of English.\r\n\r\nMaryland is the next colony in order of settlement. The Roman Catholics\r\nwere among those who suffered persecution in England, and Maryland was\r\nfounded as a place of refuge for them. Among the most prominent of the\r\nEnglish Catholics was Sir George Calvert, known as Lord Baltimore. His\r\nfirst attempt to found a colony was in Newfoundland, but the rigorous\r\nclimate compelled him to give it up. He decided that the most favorable\r\nplace was that portion of Virginia lying east of the Potomac. Virginia\r\nhad its eye already upon the section, and was preparing to settle it,\r\nwhen Charles I., without consulting her, granted the territory to Lord\r\nBaltimore. Before he could use the patent, he died, and the charter was\r\nmade to his son, Cecil Calvert, in 1632. He named it Maryland in\r\ncompliment to the queen, Henrietta Maria.\r\n\r\nLeonard Calvert, a brother of Lord Baltimore, began the settlement of\r\nMaryland at St. Mary's, near the mouth of the Potomac. He took with him\r\n200 immigrants and made friends with the Indians, whom he treated with\r\njustice and kindness. Annapolis was founded in 1683 and Baltimore in\r\n1729.\r\n\r\nDespite the wisdom and liberality of Calvert's rule, the colony met with\r\nmuch trouble, because of Virginia's claim to the territory occupied by\r\nthe newcomers. William Clayborne of Virginia had established a trading\r\npost in Maryland and refused to leave, but he was driven out, whereupon\r\nhe appealed to the king, insisting that the Catholics were intruders\r\nupon domain to which they had no right. The king decided in favor of\r\nLord Baltimore. Clayborne however, would not assent, and, returning to\r\nMaryland in 1645, he incited a rebellion which was pressed so vigorously\r\nthat Calvert was forced to flee. He gathered enough followers to drive\r\nClayborne out in turn. The Catholics then established a liberal\r\ngovernment and passed the famous \"Toleration Act,\" which allowed\r\neverybody to worship God as he saw fit. Many persons in the other\r\ncolonies, who were suffering persecution, made their homes in Maryland.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the Protestants gained a majority in the assembly and made\r\nlaws which were very oppressive to the Catholics. The strife degenerated\r\ninto civil war, which lasted for a number of years. The proprietor in\r\n1691 was a supporter of James II., because of which the new king,\r\nWilliam, took away his colony and appointed the governors himself. The\r\nproprietor's rights were restored in 1716 to the fourth Lord Baltimore.\r\nThe Calverts became extinct in 1771, and the people of Maryland assumed\r\nproprietorship five years later. Comparative tranquillity reigned until\r\nthe breaking out of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAn interesting occurrence during this tranquil period was the arrival\r\nfrom England of George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends or\r\nQuakers. In the assemblage which gathered on the shores of the\r\nChesapeake to listen to his preaching were members of the Legislature,\r\nthe leading men of the province, Indian sachems and their families, with\r\ntheir great chief at their head.\r\n\r\nThe disputed boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania was fixed in\r\n1767, by two surveyors named Mason and Dixon. This boundary became\r\nfamous in after years as the dividing line between the free and slave\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCharles II., in 1663 and 1665, granted the land between Florida and\r\nVirginia to eight proprietors. The country had been named Carolina in\r\nhonor of their king, Charles IX. (Latin, _Carolus_), and since Charles\r\nII. was King of England the name was retained, though he was not the\r\nruler meant thus to be honored. The country was comparatively\r\nuninhabited after the failure of the French colony, except by a few\r\nVirginians, who made a settlement on the northern shore of Albemarle\r\nSound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAROLINAS.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years the proprietors tried to establish upon American soil\r\none of the most absurd forms of government ever conceived. The land was\r\nto be granted to nobles, known as barons, landgraves, and caziques,\r\nwhile the rest of the people were not to be allowed to hold any land,\r\nbut were to be bought and sold with the soil, like so many cattle. The\r\nsettlers ridiculed and defied the fantastical scheme, which had to be\r\nabandoned. It was the work of John Locke, the famous philosopher, who at\r\none time was secretary of Lord Cooper, one of the proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement of the Carteret colony was made in 1670, on the\r\nbanks of the Ashley, but in 1680 it was removed to the present site of\r\nCharleston. The colonies remained united for about seventy years, when\r\nit became apparent that the territory was too large to be well governed\r\nby one assembly and a single governor. In 1729, the present division was\r\nmade, and the rights of government and seven-eighths of the land were\r\nreturned to the crown.\r\n\r\nThe soil and climate were so favorable that thousands of immigrants were\r\nattracted thither. Among them were numerous Huguenots or French\r\nProtestants, whose intelligence, thrift, and morality placed them among\r\nthe very best settlers found anywhere in our country. Newbern was\r\nsettled by a colony of Swiss in 1711, and there was a large influx of\r\nScotch after their rebellion of 1740, England giving them permission to\r\nleave Scotland. Scotch immigrants settled Fayetteville in 1746.\r\n\r\nThere were occasional troubles with the Indians, the most important of\r\nwhich was the war with the Tuscaroras, in 1711. This tribe was utterly\r\ndefeated and driven northward into New York, where they joined the\r\nIroquois or Five Nations. The union of the Tuscaroras caused the\r\nIroquois to be known afterward as the Six Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinas were afflicted with some of the worst governors\r\nconceivable, interspersed now and then with excellent ones. Often there\r\nwas sturdy resistance, and in 1677 one of the governors, who attempted\r\nto enforce the Navigation Act, was deposed and imprisoned. In 1688,\r\nanother was driven out of the colony. The population was widely\r\nscattered, but the people themselves were as a whole the best kind of\r\ncitizens. They would not permit religious persecution, and defeated the\r\neffort to make the Church of England the colony church. As a\r\nconsequence, the Carolinas became, like Maryland and Pennsylvania, a\r\nrefuge for thousands of those who were persecuted in the name of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIA.\r\n\r\nGeorgia was the last of the thirteen original colonies to be settled,\r\nand, though it long remained the weakest of them all, its history is\r\nvery interesting. It, too, was a country of refuge for those suffering\r\npersecution, but their affliction was different in its nature from those\r\nof whom we have made record.\r\n\r\nOne of the remarkable facts connected with the government of nations\r\nclaiming the highest civilization, hardly more than a century ago, was\r\nthe brutality of their laws. Many crimes, comparatively trifling in\r\ntheir nature, were punishable with death. One of the most cruel of these\r\noppressive laws was that which permitted a man to throw into prison a\r\nneighbor who was unable to pay the money he owed. If a poor tenant fell\r\nill, and could not pay his landlord, the latter could have him flung\r\ninto jail and kept there until the debt was paid. Since the debtor was\r\nunable to earn a penny while in prison, and probably his wife and\r\nchildren were equally helpless, the landlord thus deprived himself of\r\nall possibility of getting his money, while the wretched debtor\r\nliterally \"rotted\" in prison. Thousands died in dreadful misery, merely\r\nbecause they were poor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONIAL PLOW WITH WOODEN MOULD-BOARD. 1706 (State\r\nAgricultural Museum, Albany, N.Y.)]\r\n\r\nThis system of allowing imprisonment for debt prevailed in our own\r\ncountry until within the memory of men still living. It makes one's\r\ncheeks tingle with shame and indignation to recall that Robert Morris,\r\nwho devoted all his wealth and energies to raising money for the\r\npatriots during the Revolution, who furnished Washington with thousands\r\nof dollars, and but for whose help the war must have failed, became poor\r\nafter independence was gained and was imprisoned for debt.\r\n\r\nThe system caused such horrible suffering in England that the pity of\r\nall good men was stirred. Among these was James Edward Oglethorpe, one\r\nof the most admirable characters in modern history. He was a brave and\r\nskillful soldier, eminently just, of the highest social position and a\r\nmember of Parliament. He determined to do something practical for the\r\nperishing debtors in English jails. He, therefore, asked George II. to\r\ngive him a grant of land in America to which the imprisoned debtors\r\ncould be sent, and the king, whose heart also seemed to be touched,\r\npromptly did so. It was said of Oglethorpe that the universal respect\r\nfelt for him made certain that any favor he asked of his own associates\r\nor friends would be willingly granted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT HORSESHOES PLOWED UP IN SCHENECTADY CO., N.Y.\r\n\r\n(In the New York State Agricultural Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe king not only presented him with valuable equipments, but Parliament\r\ngranted him a liberal sum, to which wealthy citizens added. He had the\r\nbest wishes of his entire country when he sailed for America with one\r\nhundred and fourteen persons. He named the new colony Georgia in honor\r\nof the king, and began the settlement of Savannah in 1733, Darien and\r\nAugusta being founded three years later. It need hardly be said of such\r\na man, that, like Penn and Baltimore, he bought the lands anew of the\r\nIndians and retained their friendship from the start. On one of his\r\nvisits to England he took a party of red men with him, entertained them\r\nat his country place and presented them at court.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards claimed Georgia as their own territory, and raised a large\r\nforce with which to expel Oglethorpe, whose colony had been increased by\r\nthe arrival of other immigrants, but the English officer handled his men\r\nwith such extraordinary skill that the Spaniards were utterly routed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COLONIAL FLAX-WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nIt would be supposed that Georgia would have been one of the most\r\nsuccessful of the original colonies, since seemingly it possessed every\r\nadvantage, but such was far from the fact. One cause for this was the\r\n\"coddling\" the pioneers received. They were harmed by too much kindness.\r\nHad they been compelled to hew their own way, like their neighbors, they\r\nwould have done better. They were like children spoiled by being granted\r\ntoo many favors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIAWATHA, FOUNDER OF THE IROQUOIS LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois League was composed of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga,\r\nCayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora nations, who founded in the New York\r\nwilderness a barbaric republic, with bonds of union that might serve in\r\nmany respects as a model for civilized nations.]\r\n\r\nAnother cause was the poor laws by which the people were ruled. Slavery\r\nat first was forbidden within its borders, though it was tolerated all\r\nabout them. Then, in 1747, the trustees yielded to the general demand\r\nand admitted slavery. Other rules caused discontent, and many settlers\r\nmoved away. Population appeared to be at a standstill, and finally the\r\ntrustees in 1752 surrendered their rights to the crown. More liberal\r\nlaws followed and the prosperity increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK-WINDING.\r\n\r\n(Fac-simile of a picture in Edward Williams' \"Virginia Truly Valued.\"\r\n1650.)]\r\n\r\nOf General Oglethorpe, it may be added that he lived to reach his\r\nninety-eighth year. It was said of him that he was the handsomest old\r\nman in London, and people often stopped on the streets to look at and\r\nadmire him. He always had a warm regard for the American colonies.\r\nIndeed, it was this marked friendship for them which prevented his\r\nappointment as commander-in-chief of the British forces during the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, beginning with Virginia, in 1607, the\r\nAmerican colonies had grown in a little more than a century and a\r\nquarter to thirteen. These were strung along the Atlantic coast from\r\nMaine to Florida, and in 1750 their population was about 1,260,000. This\r\nwas vigorous growth. All the colonists, although born on this side of\r\nthe Atlantic, considered themselves Englishmen, and were proud of their\r\nking, three thousand miles away across the ocean. With such loyal\r\nsubjects, the English crown had the best opportunity in the world to\r\nbecome the most powerful of all the nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMFORTIER, OR CHAFING-DISH.\r\n\r\n(New York State Cabinet of Natural History, Albany.)]\r\n\r\nBut Great Britain was not free from misgiving over the rapid growth of\r\nher American colonies. Nothing looked more probable than that before\r\nmany years they would unite in one government of their own and declare\r\ntheir independence of the British crown. Then was the time for the\r\ndisplay of wise statesmanship, but unhappily for England and happily for\r\nthe colonies, such wise statesmanship proved to be lacking on the other\r\nside of the water. The colonies displayed great industry. They grew\r\ntobacco, rice, indigo, and many other products which were eagerly\r\nwelcomed by the British merchants, who exported their own manufactures\r\nin exchange for them. The inevitable result was that England and the\r\nAmerican colonies increased their wealth by this means. Not only that,\r\nbut the colonies voted ships, men, and money to help the mother country\r\nin the wars in which she was often involved.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1651, Parliament passed the first of the oppressive\r\nNavigation Acts, which forbade the colonies to trade with any other\r\ncountry than England, or to receive foreign ships into their ports. This\r\nact was so harsh and unjust that it was never generally enforced, until\r\nthe attempt, more than a century later, when it became one of the\r\nleading causes of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY DAYS IN NEW ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACES OF WORSHIP IN NEW YORK IN 1742.\r\n\r\n1.

Men lived for\r\nyears in America as neighbors, meeting and exchanging visits on the most\r\nfriendly terms, and with no thought of enmity, until the arrival of some\r\nship with news that their respective governments in Europe had gone to\r\nwar. Straightway, the neighbors became enemies, and, catching up their\r\nguns, did their best to kill one another. Untold misery and hundreds of\r\nlives were lost, merely because two ambitious men had gotten into a\r\nwrangle. The result of such a dispute possessed no earthly interest to\r\nthe people in the depths of the American wilderness, but loyalty to\r\ntheir sovereigns demanded that they should plunge into strife.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, Spain and Holland declined in power, and England and\r\nFrance became formidable rivals in the New World as well as in the Old.\r\nIn 1689, when William III. was on the throne of England, war broke out\r\nbetween that country and France and lasted until 1697. The French,\r\nhaving settled in Canada, were wise enough to cultivate the friendship\r\nof the Indians, who helped them in their savage manner in desolating the\r\nEnglish settlements. Dover, New Hampshire, was attacked by the French\r\nand Indians, who killed more than a score of persons and carried away a\r\nnumber of captives. In other places, settlers were surprised in the\r\nfields and shot down. Early in 1690, another party came down from\r\nCanada, and, when the snow lay deep on the ground and the people were\r\nsleeping in their beds, made a furious attack upon Schenectady. The town\r\nwas burned and sixty persons tomahawked, while the survivors, half-clad,\r\nstruggled through the snow to Albany, sixteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in retaliation attempted to invade Canada, but the result\r\nwas a disastrous failure. The war continued in a desultory way, with\r\ngreat cruelties on both sides, until 1697, when a treaty signed at\r\nRyswick, Holland, settled the quarrel between King William and James\r\nII., by deciding that the former was the rightful king of England. The\r\nsuffering and deaths that had been inflicted on this side of the\r\nAtlantic produced not the slightest effect upon the quarrel between the\r\ntwo claimants to the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN ANNE'S WAR.\r\n\r\nIn 1702, England got into a wrangle with France and Spain. This time the\r\nIroquois Indians took no part, because of their treaty with France,\r\nalthough in the previous war they fought on the side of the English. In\r\nthe depth of winter in 1703-4, Deerfield, Massachusetts, was attacked\r\nand destroyed. Forty-seven of the people were tomahawked and more than a\r\nhundred carried into captivity. Their sufferings were so dreadful on the\r\nlong tramp through the snow to Canada that nearly all sank down and\r\ndied. Maine and New Hampshire were devastated by the hordes, who showed\r\nno mercy to women and children. Another English invasion of Canada was\r\nattempted, but failed like its predecessor. The aimless, cruel war\r\ncontinued until 1713, when a treaty of peace was signed at Utrecht in\r\nHolland, by which England secured control of the fisheries of\r\nNewfoundland, while Labrador, Hudson Bay, and Acadia or Nova Scotia were\r\nceded to Great Britain. The result in both instances would have been the\r\nsame had the English and French settlers and the Indians continued on\r\namicable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING GEORGE'S WAR.\r\n\r\nIn 1740, the War for the Austrian Succession broke out in Europe and\r\nsoon involved most of the European nations. Because George II. was on\r\nthe throne of England, the struggle is known in this country as King\r\nGeorge's War.\r\n\r\nA notable event in America was the capture of the fortress of Louisburg,\r\none of the strongest fortifications in the world, mainly by New England\r\ntroops. It was a grand achievement which thrilled this country and\r\nEngland, and caused consternation in France. A treaty of peace was\r\nsigned in 1744 at Aix-la-Chapelle, a town in western Germany. New\r\nEngland was enraged to find that by the terms of this treaty Louisburg\r\nwas given back to France, and all her valor, sacrifice, and suffering\r\nwent for naught.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ATTACK ON RIOTERS AT SPRINGFIELD, MASS., IN 1786.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that England and France, who had long been\r\nrivals in the Old World, had become equally bitter rivals on this side\r\nof the Atlantic. On the west, the thirteen English colonies were walled\r\nin by the Allegheny Mountains, beyond which none of the settlers had\r\nadvanced. All the country lying between these mountains and the\r\nMississippi was claimed by France, who was pushing southward through it,\r\nand had given it the name of New France or Louisiana. The first French\r\nsettlement within the northwestern part of our country was the mission\r\nof St. Mary, near Sault Ste. Marie, now in the State of Michigan, it\r\nhaving been established in 1668. Several others of minor importance were\r\nplanted at different points.\r\n\r\nEngland did not oppose the acquirement of Canada by the French early in\r\nthe seventeenth century, but no serious attempt was made by that people\r\nto colonize the territory within the United States until 1699, when\r\nD'Iberville crossed the Gulf of Mexico in quest of the mouth of the\r\nMississippi. When he found it, he planted a settlement at Biloxi, now in\r\nMississippi, but removed it in 1702 to Mobile. The Mississippi Company,\r\na French organization, obtained in 1716 a grant of Louisiana, and in\r\n1718 sent out a colony that began the settlement of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that by 1750 the French had acquired large\r\npossessions in North America. They were, determined to hold them, and,\r\nto do so, established a chain of sixty forts reaching from Montreal to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. These forts were the foundations of many important\r\ncities of to-day, such as New Orleans, Natchez, Detroit, Vincennes,\r\nToledo, Fort Wayne, Ogdensburg, and Montreal. To the rear of the main\r\nchain of forts were others like Mackinaw, Peoria, and Kaskaskia.\r\n\r\nExtensive as was the territory thus taken possession of by the French,\r\nthey were fatally weak because of their scant population, amounting to\r\nless than 150,000 souls, while the English colonies had grown to\r\n1,500,000. The French traders were just about strong enough to hold the\r\nIndians in check, but no more.\r\n\r\nThus with the French on the west and the English on the east of the\r\nAlleghanies, the two rival forces were slowly creeping toward each\r\nother, and were bound soon to meet, when the supreme struggle for\r\npossession of the North American continent would open. By-and-by, the\r\nFrench hunters and traders, as they climbed the western slope of the\r\nmountains, met the English trappers moving in their direction. Being the\r\nadvance skirmishers of their respective armies, they often exchanged\r\nshots, and then fell back to report what they had seen and done to their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe fertile lands of the Great West had long attracted attention, and\r\nmany efforts had been made to buy them at a cheap price to sell again to\r\nsettlers. In 1749, the Ohio Company was formed by a number of London\r\nmerchants and several prominent Virginians. The lands they bought lay in\r\nwestern Pennsylvania, which Virginia claimed as part of her territory.\r\nThis company proved its earnestness by sending out surveyors, opening\r\nroads, and offering tempting inducements to settlers.\r\n\r\nThe French were equally prompt and took possession of the country\r\nbetween the Alleghanies and their main chain of forts. They built a fort\r\nat Presq' Isle, on the site of the present city of Erie, and began\r\nerecting a new chain of forts southward toward the Ohio. Governor\r\nDinwiddie of Virginia saw the danger of permitting this encroachment,\r\nand he wrote a letter of remonstrance to the French commander, which was\r\nplaced in the hands of GEORGE WASHINGTON, to be carried five hundred\r\nmiles through wilderness, across mountains and dangerous rivers, to the\r\npoint in western Pennsylvania where the French officer was building his\r\nforts upon disputed ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG WASHINGTON RIDING A COLT.\r\n\r\nOne summer morning, young George, with three or four boys, was in the\r\nfield looking at a colt, given him by his mother, and when the boys said\r\nthat it could never be tamed, George said: \"You help me get on its back,\r\nand I'll tame it.\"]\r\n\r\nThe journey was a long and perilous one, but Washington, who was a\r\nmagnificent specimen of vigorous young manhood, performed it in safety,\r\nand brought back the reply of the French commander, which notified\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie that he not only refused to vacate the territory, but\r\nwould drive out every Englishman he found within it.\r\n\r\nThis meant war, and Virginia made her preparations. She raised about 400\r\nmen and placed them under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Washington,\r\nwho was more familiar with the country than anyone else. The Ohio\r\nCompany at that time were putting up a fort on the present site of\r\nPittsburg, and Washington hurried forward to protect it. The Frenchmen\r\nunderstood the value of a post at the junction of the Alleghany and\r\nMonongahela Rivers, and also started on a race for it. They arrived\r\nfirst, captured the fort, strengthened it, and gave it the name of Fort\r\nDuquesne. That done, they set out to meet Washington, who was descending\r\nthe Monongahela.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between these forces brought on the first fight of the\r\nFrench and Indian War. It was the advance party of each which met, and\r\nit is said that the first musket was fired by Washington himself. The\r\nFrench had enlisted a number of Indians, but Washington killed or\r\ncaptured nearly all of them as well as the whites. The main body of the\r\nFrench, however, was so much more powerful than his own, that Washington\r\nmoved back a few miles and built a fortification which he named Fort\r\nNecessity. There, after a brisk fight, he was compelled to surrender,\r\nJuly 4, 1754, on the promise that he and his men should be allowed to\r\nreturn to Virginia. That province was so well pleased with his work that\r\nhe acted as its leading officer throughout the remainder of the war.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the French and Indian War must be noted. For two years\r\nit was entirely an American war, not extending to Europe until 1756. For\r\nthe first time the English colonies acted together. They saw the value\r\nof the territory in dispute and were ready to make common cause for its\r\npossession. England was inclined to let them do the best they could\r\nwithout help from her. She advised that they form some plan for united\r\naction. In accordance with this suggestion, a meeting was held at Albany\r\nin 1754, composed of delegates from Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nand the New England colonies. Benjamin Franklin, the great philosopher,\r\nproposed the \"Albany plan of Union,\" which was agreed upon.\r\n\r\nWhen this was submitted to the king, he saw too much of American\r\nindependence in it, and promptly rejected it, while the colonies did the\r\nsame on the ground that it gave the king too much power. There was much\r\nsignificance in this action.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF THE CANADIANS.\r\n\r\nIt was now so evident that war must soon come that England and France\r\nbegan sending troops to America. At the same time, the respective\r\ngovernments continued to profess--diplomatically--their strong\r\nfriendship for each other. In June, 1755, a force consisting of British\r\nregulars and colonial troops sailed from Boston and captured the few\r\nremaining French forts in Nova Scotia. The inhabitants were gathered\r\ntogether in their churches, placed on ships, and then distributed\r\nsouthward among the English colonies. This act has been often denounced\r\nas one unworthy of the British people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON'S FIRST VICTORY\r\n\r\n\"Washington was at the head of his men with a musket in his grasp. The\r\ninstant he saw the Frenchmen he discharged his gun at them, and gave the\r\norder to his men to fire. Hence it came about that the first hostile\r\nshot in the French and Indian War was fired by George Washington.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADDOCK'S MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nAmong the English officers who arrived in 1755 was General Edward\r\nBraddock. He was brave and skillful, but conceited and stubborn. When\r\nWashington, who was one of his aides, explained to him the character of\r\nthe treacherous foes whom he would have to fight and advised him to\r\nadopt similar tactics, the English officer insultingly answered that\r\nwhen he felt the need of advice from a young Virginian, he would ask for\r\nit. He marched toward Fort Duquesne and was within a few miles of the\r\npost, when he ran into an ambush and was assailed so vehemently by a\r\nforce of French and Indians that half his men were killed, the rest put\r\nto flight, and himself mortally wounded. Washington and his Virginians,\r\nby adopting the Indian style of fighting, checked the pursuit and saved\r\nthe remainder of the men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1756, England and France declared war against each\r\nother and the struggle now involved those two countries. For two years\r\nthe English, despite their preponderance of forces in America, lost\r\nrather than gained ground. Their officers sent across the ocean were a\r\nsorry lot, while the French were commanded by Montcalm, a brilliant\r\nleader. He concentrated his forces and delivered many effective blows,\r\ncapturing the forts on the northern border of New York and winning all\r\nthe Indians to his support. The English fought in detached bodies and\r\nwere continually defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH SUCCESSES.\r\n\r\nBut a change came in 1758, when William Pitt, one of the greatest\r\nEnglishmen in history, was called to the head of the government. He\r\nweeded out inefficient officers, replaced them with skillful ones, who,\r\nconcentrating their troops, assailed the French at three important\r\npoints. Louisburg, on Cape Breton Island, which had been captured more\r\nthan a hundred years before, during King George's War, was again taken\r\nby a naval expedition in the summer of 1758. In the autumn, Fort\r\nDuquesne was captured without resistance and named Fort Pitt, in honor\r\nof the illustrious prime minister. The single defeat administered to the\r\nEnglish was at Ticonderoga, where Montcalm commanded in person. This was\r\na severe repulse, in which the English lost in the neighborhood of 1,600\r\nmen. It was offset by the expulsion of the French from northwestern New\r\nYork and the capture of Fort Frontenac, on the present site of Kingston\r\nin Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTELLO TOWER ON THE HEIGHTS OF ABRAHAM, WHERE WOLFE WAS\r\nKILLED.]\r\n\r\nOne wise step of Pitt was in winning the cordial support of the\r\nprovincials, as the colonists were called, to the British regulars. Our\r\nancestors thus gained a most valuable military training which served\r\nthem well in the great struggle for independence a few years later.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLFE'S GREAT VICTORY.\r\n\r\nThe year 1759 brought decisive success to the English. Knowing that they\r\nintended to attack Quebec, Montcalm drew in his troops to defend that\r\ncity. It therefore was an easy matter for the English to capture\r\nTiconderoga, Crown Point, and Fort Niagara, General Wolfe, one of the\r\nvery ablest of English leaders, left Louisburg with a fleet and sailed\r\nup the St. Lawrence. He found the fortifications of Quebec at so great\r\nan elevation that he could make no impression upon them. Three months\r\npassed in idle waiting and the besiegers were almost disheartened. Wolfe\r\nhimself was so distressed by anxiety that he fell ill. The sagacious\r\nMontcalm could not be induced to come out and give battle, and there\r\nseemed no way of reaching him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DUTCH HOUSEHOLD.\r\n\r\nAs seen in the early days in New York.]\r\n\r\nBut the lion-hearted Wolfe would not be denied. He found a path leading\r\nup to the Heights of Abraham, as the plain above was called, and,\r\nselecting a mild night in September, his troops floated down the river\r\nin their boats and landed at the foot of the cliff. All night long the\r\nEnglish soldiers were clambering up the steep path, dragging a few guns\r\nwith them, and, when the morning sun rose, it shone on the flashing\r\nbayonets of the whole army drawn up in battle array before the walls of\r\nQuebec.\r\n\r\nThe astonished Montcalm, instead of remaining within the city, marched\r\nhis army out and gave battle. In the fight both Wolfe and Montcalm were\r\nfatally wounded. Wolfe lived long enough to learn that the French were\r\nfleeing before his victorious troops. \"Now, I can die happy,\" he said,\r\nand shortly after expired. When Montcalm was told he must die, he\r\nmournfully replied: \"So much the better; I shall not live to see the\r\nsurrender of Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOMENTOUS RESULTS OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nThis battle was one of the decisive ones of the world, for, as will be\r\nseen, its results were of momentous importance to mankind. The conquest\r\nof Canada followed in 1760, and the other French forts fairly tumbled\r\ninto the possession of the English. Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawas, was\r\nso angered at the turn of events that he refused to be bound by the\r\nterms of the surrender. He brought a number of tribes into an alliance,\r\ncaptured several British posts in the West, and laid siege to Detroit\r\nfor more than a year, but in the end he was defeated, his confederacy\r\nscattered, and Pontiac himself, like Philip, was killed by one of his\r\nown race.\r\n\r\nThe war was over, so far as America was concerned, but England and\r\nFrance kept it up for nearly three years, fighting on the ocean and\r\nelsewhere. In 1762, Spain joined France, but received a telling blow in\r\nthe same year, when an English expedition captured the city of Havana.\r\nIn this important event, the provincials gave valuable aid to the\r\nBritish regulars. The colonies also sent out a number of privateers\r\nwhich captured many rich prizes from the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nBy 1763, Great Britain had completely conquered France and Spain, and a\r\ntreaty of peace was signed at Paris. France and Spain agreed to give up\r\nall of North America east of the Mississippi, and England ceded _Cuba to\r\nSpain in exchange for Florida, exchanging Florida in 1783 for the Bahama\r\nIslands. The former_ was a victory for Spanish diplomacy, since Florida\r\nwas practically worthless to _Spain_, while Havana, _the capital of\r\nCuba_, was an enormously wealthy city, and the island possessed\r\nmarvelous fertility and almost boundless resources.\r\n\r\nFrance, after her wholesale yielding to England, paid Spain her ally by\r\nceding to her all her possessions west of the Mississippi, including the\r\ncity of New Orleans. This enormous territory, then known as Louisiana,\r\ncomprehended everything between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi\r\nRiver, from British America to the Gulf of Mexico. In extent it was an\r\nempire from which many of the most important States of the Union have\r\nbeen carved. When it is remembered that these changes were the result of\r\na war in which the capture of Quebec was the decisive conflict, it will\r\nbe admitted that there was ample warrant for pronouncing it one of the\r\ngreat battles of the world.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen original colonies were now \"full grown.\" Their population\r\nhad increased to 2,000,000 and was fast growing. Their men had proven\r\ntheir bravery and generalship in the French and Indian War. Many of them\r\nhad developed into fine officers, and all compared favorably with the\r\nBritish regulars. Their loyalty to England was proven by the 30,000\r\nlives that had been given that she might conquer her traditional rival\r\nand enemy.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous spirit of the colonists was shown by the fact that many\r\nbegan crossing the Alleghanies into the fertile district beyond, where\r\nthey were in continual danger from the fierce Indians. James Robertson\r\nled a party of emigrants who made the first settlement in Tennessee in\r\n1768, and the famous Daniel Boone and a company of immigrants were the\r\npioneers in Kentucky in 1769. No effort was made to settle the country\r\nnorth of the Ohio until after the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEMORIAL HALL, HARVARD COLLEGE.]\r\n\r\nThe intellectual progress of the colonies was remarkable. The first\r\nprinting press was set up at Cambridge in 1639, and newspapers and books\r\nwere in general circulation. Harvard College was founded in\r\nMassachusetts in 1638; William and Mary, in Virginia, in 1692; Yale, in\r\nConnecticut, in 1700; the College of New Jersey (now Princeton\r\nUniversity), in 1746; the University of Pennsylvania, in 1749; and\r\nKing's College (now Columbia), in New York, in 1754. Much attention was\r\ngiven to education, commerce was greatly extended, the oppressive\r\nNavigation Act being generally disregarded, and thousands of citizens\r\nwere in prosperous circumstances.\r\n\r\nMore significant than all else was the growth of the sentiment of unity\r\namong the different colonies. Although properly known as provincials, to\r\ndistinguish them from the British, they now, instead of speaking of\r\nthemselves as New Englanders or Virginians or Englishmen, often\r\nsubstituted the name \"Americans.\" The different colonies were looked\r\nupon as members of the same great family, ready to make common cause\r\nagainst a danger threatening any one of them. Some of the bolder ones\r\nbegan to express the thought that it would be a fine thing if they were\r\nall independent of the mother country, though for years the sentiment\r\nassumed no importance.\r\n\r\nNow was the time for England to display wisdom, justice, and\r\nstatesmanship toward her subjects in America. Had she treated them as\r\nshe now treats Canada and Australia and her other colonies, there never\r\nwould have been a Revolution. No doubt in time we should have separated\r\nfrom her, but the separation would have been peaceable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIBLE BROUGHT OVER IN THE \"MAYFLOWER\" IN PILGRIM HALL,\r\nNEW PLYMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nBut while Great Britain has always been immeasurably above Spain in her\r\ntreatment of her American subjects, she was almost as foolish, because\r\nshe chilled the loyalty that had been proven in too many instances to be\r\ndoubted. The mother country was laboring under the weight of burdensome\r\ntaxes, and, since the colonies had always been prompt in voting money\r\nand supplies as well as men to assist England, Parliament thought she\r\nsaw a way of shouldering a large part of this burden upon the Americans.\r\nHer attempts to do so and the results therefrom properly belong to the\r\nsucceeding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE OF THE COLONISTS.\r\n\r\nA few facts will assist in understanding the events that follow.\r\nSlavery, as has been stated, was legal and existed in all the colonies,\r\nbut climatic conditions caused it to flourish in the South and decline\r\nin the North. All the colonies were Protestant, though religious liberty\r\nwas permitted everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe laws were amazingly strict and would never be submitted to in these\r\ntimes. To illustrate: a watchman in Hartford rang a bell every morning\r\nas notice to all adults to rise from their beds. Massachusetts had\r\nfourteen and Virginia seventeen offenses that were punishable with\r\ndeath. Some of the minor punishments were unique. If a woman became a\r\ncommon scold, she was placed near her own door, with a gag fastened in\r\nher mouth, that all might see and beware of her example. For other\r\noffenses, a man was ducked in water or put in the stocks. A stock was a\r\nstrong framework, through which the feet or both feet and hands were\r\nthrust and held fast, while the pillory was a framework through which\r\nthe head and hands of a criminal were imprisoned. Besides the disgrace\r\nattending such punishment, it was very trying. The whipping-post was\r\nquite common long after the Revolution, and it is still occasionally\r\nused in Delaware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN STAGE-COACH OF 1795, FROM \"WELD'S TRAVELS.\"\r\n(Probably similar in form to those of the later colonial period.)]\r\n\r\nMen and boys dressed much alike, and the fashions for women and girls\r\nwere similar. The breeches of the men suggested the present style of\r\nknickerbockers, the rich making quite a display of silver buckles and\r\nbuttons. The breeches of the poorer people were made of coarse cloth,\r\ndeerskin, or leather, the object being to obtain all the wear possible.\r\nThe wealthy used velvet, and the men and women were as fond of display\r\nas their descendants.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days, all the houses were made of logs, and oiled paper\r\ntook the place of glass for windows. Carpets were an unknown luxury.\r\nOften the floor was the smooth, hard ground. The cooking was done in the\r\nbig fireplace, where an iron arm called a crane was swung over the fire\r\nand sustained the pots and kettles. Coal and matches were unknown, a\r\nfire being started by means of a piece of steel and flint or with the\r\nhelp of a sun glass.\r\n\r\nCoffee and tea were great luxuries, but nearly every family made its own\r\nbeer. Rum and hard cider were drunk by church people as well as others,\r\nthe only fault being when one drank too much. The important cities and\r\ntowns were connected by stages, but most of the traveling was done on\r\nfoot or horseback. Since most of the settlements were near the sea or on\r\nlarge rivers, long journeys were made by means of coasting sloops. When\r\na line of stages in 1766 made the trip between New York and Philadelphia\r\nin two days, it was considered so wonderful that the vehicles were\r\ncalled \"flying machines.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the state of religion in the colonies, Prof. George F. Holmes\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The state of religion among the people differed greatly in the\r\ndifferent provinces. The Church of England was the established religion\r\nin New York, Virginia, and the Carolinas. In Maryland, the population\r\nremained largely Roman Catholic. In New England the original Puritanism\r\nwas dominant, but its rigor had become much softened. A solemn and\r\nsomewhat gloomy piety, however, still prevailed. The Presbyterians were\r\nnumerous, influential, and earnest in New Jersey. There, but especially\r\nin Pennsylvania, were the quiet and gentle Quakers. In Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, Moravians and other German Protestants were settled, and\r\nHuguenot families were frequent in Virginia and South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere, however, was found an intermixture of creeds, and\r\nconsequently the need of toleration had been experienced. Laxity of\r\nmorals and of conduct was alleged against the communities of the\r\nAnglican Church. In the middle of the eighteenth century a low tone of\r\nreligious sentiment was general. The revival of fervor, which was\r\nincited then by the Wesleys, was widely spread by Whitefield in America,\r\nand Methodism was making itself felt throughout the country. The\r\nBaptists were spreading in different colonies and were acquiring\r\ninfluence by their earnest simplicity. They favored liberty in all forms\r\nand became warm partisans of the revolutionary movement.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL\r\n\r\nWhen the third attack was made, and the Americans' ammunition was\r\nexhausted with the first volley, a desperate hand-to-hand struggle\r\nfollowed. General Warren was fighting heroically when a British officer\r\nrecognized him, seized a musket from a private and shot him dead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION--THE WAR IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nClauses of the Revolution--The Stamp Act--The Boston Tea\r\nParty--England's Unbearable Measures--The First Continental\r\nCongress--The Boston Massacre--Lexington and Concord--The Second\r\nContinental Congress--Battle of Bunker Hill--Assumption of Command by\r\nWashington--British Evacuation of Boston--Disastrous Invasion of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nEngland was never guilty of greater folly than in the treatment of her\r\nAmerican colonies after the close of the French and Indian War. As has\r\nbeen said, she was oppressed by burdensome taxation and began seeking\r\nexcuse for shifting a large portion of it upon the shoulders of her\r\nprosperous subjects across the sea, who had always been ready to vote\r\nmoney and give their sons to help in the wars which were almost solely\r\nfor the benefit of the mother country. It has been shown that the\r\nintercolonial conflicts were of no advantage to the colonies which were\r\ndragged into them and suffered greatly therefrom. Since the surrounding\r\nterritory would soon be necessary for the expansion of the Americans,\r\nthey had much to gain by the defeat of the French and their expulsion\r\nfrom America; but they had done their full share, and it was unjust to\r\ndemand further sacrifices from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE STAMP ACT.\r\n\r\nHardly had peace been declared, when, in 1764, the British government\r\nasserted that it had the _right_ to tax her colonies. The latter paid\r\nlittle attention to the declaration, but were rudely awakened in 1765 by\r\nthe passage of the Stamp Act, which was to go into effect in November of\r\nthat year. It decreed that thenceforward no newspapers or pamphlets\r\ncould be printed, no marriage-certificate given, and no documents used\r\nin lawsuits, unless stamps were attached, and these could be bought only\r\nfrom British agents.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered further that the oppressive Navigation Acts, which had\r\nbeen evaded for a hundred years, should be rigidly enforced, while\r\nsoldiers were to be sent to America to see that the orders were carried\r\nout. Since these troops were to be paid from the money received for the\r\nstamps, it will be seen that the Americans would be obliged to bear the\r\nexpense of the soldiers quartered upon them.\r\n\r\nNow we use revenue stamps to-day and no one objects, but the difference\r\nin the two cases is that we tax ourselves for our own expenses, and our\r\nrepresentatives grade the taxes so as to suit the people. If we do not\r\nthink the taxes equitable, we can elect other representatives, pledged\r\nto change them. But it must be remembered that we never had a\r\nrepresentative in the British Parliament, whose English members did just\r\nas they pleased. That was \"taxation without representation.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the action of the British government threw the colonies into\r\nan angry mood and they vehemently declared their intention to resist the\r\nStamp Act. They did not content themselves with words, but mobbed the\r\nstamp agents, compelled others to resign, and, when the date arrived for\r\nthe act to go into effect, they refused to buy a single obnoxious stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPEAL OF THE STAMP ACT.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act Congress, as it was called, met in New York City, October\r\n7, 1765. There were representatives from all the colonies except four,\r\nbut they supported the others. Lacking the authority to make any laws,\r\nit issued a bold declaration of rights and sent petitions to the king\r\nand Parliament, setting forth the American grievances. The sturdy\r\nresistance of the colonies alarmed England. They had many friends in\r\nParliament, including the illustrious Pitt, and, at the beginning of\r\n1766, the act was repealed. The Americans were so delighted that they\r\nalmost forgot that England in repealing the act still asserted her right\r\nto tax them.\r\n\r\nSeveral years now followed in which the colonies quietly resisted the\r\nefforts of England to tax them. This was done by a general agreement not\r\nto buy any of the articles upon which taxes were laid. The men who did\r\nthis and opposed the mother country were known as Whigs, while those who\r\nstood by England were called Tories.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIANT ACTS BY THE AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nBut violence was sure to follow where the indignation was so intense and\r\nwidespread. There were continual broils between the British soldiers and\r\ncitizens, the most serious of which occurred in Boston on March 5, 1770,\r\nwhen the soldiers fired upon the citizens who had attacked them, killed\r\nthree and wounded several. This incident, known in history as the\r\n\"Boston Massacre,\" added to the mutual anger. In North Carolina, William\r\nTryon, the Tory Governor, had a battle with the patriots at Alamance in\r\n1771, killed a large number, and treated others so brutally that many\r\nfled across the mountains and helped to settle Tennessee. In 1772, a\r\nBritish vessel, the _Gaspe_, which was active in collecting duties from\r\nProvidence, was captured and burned by a number of Rhode Island people.\r\nEngland offered a reward for the capture of the \"rebels,\" but, though\r\nthey were well known, no one would have dared, if so disposed, to arrest\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON TEA PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe British Parliament was impatient with the colonies, and threatened\r\nall sorts of retaliatory measures. In 1770, Parliament took the tax off\r\nof all articles except tea, upon which it was made so light that the\r\nluxury was cheaper in America with the tax than in England without it.\r\nThe Americans, however, were contending for a principle, and\r\ncontemptuously rejected the offer. When the tea ships reached\r\nCharleston, the cargoes were stored in damp cellars, where they soon\r\nmolded and spoiled. At New York, Philadelphia, and other points they\r\nwould not allow the ships to land their cargoes, and they sailed back to\r\nEngland. A similar reception having been given the vessels in Boston,\r\nthe British officers refused to leave the harbor. Late at night,\r\nDecember 16, 1773, a party of citizens, painted and disguised as\r\nIndians, boarded the ships and emptied 342 chests--all on board--into\r\nthe harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD SOUTH CHURCH, BOSTON. An immense assemblage\r\ngathered here on the evening of Dec. 16, 1773, and stirring addresses\r\nwere made by Josiah Quincy and Samuel Adams. The \"Boston Tea Party\"\r\nfollowed.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Boston Tea Party\" thrilled the colonies and exhausted the patience\r\nof England, who felt that the time for stern measures had come. Her\r\ndallying course had only encouraged the rebels, and as in the story,\r\nhaving tried in vain the throwing of grass, she now determined to see\r\nwhat virtue there was in using stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND'S UNBEARABLE MEASURES.\r\n\r\nThe measures which she passed and which were unbearable were: 1. The\r\nBoston Port Bill, which forbade all vessels to leave or enter Boston\r\nharbor. This was a death-blow to Boston commerce and was meant as a\r\npunishment of those who were leaders in the revolt against the mother\r\ncountry. 2. The Massachusetts Bill, which was another destructive blow\r\nat the colony, since it changed its charter by taking away the right of\r\nself-government and placing it in the hands of the agents of the king.\r\n3. The Transportation Bill, which ordered that all soldiers charged with\r\nthe crime of murder should be taken to England for trial. 4. The Quebec\r\nAct, which made the country east of the Mississippi and north of the\r\nOhio a part of Canada. These acts were to be enforced by the sending of\r\ntroops to America.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nThe result of the passage of these harsh measures was to unite all the\r\ncolonies in a determination to resist them to the last. The necessity\r\nfor consultation among the leaders was so apparent that, in response to\r\na general call, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia,\r\nSeptember 5, 1774, all the colonies being represented except Georgia,\r\nwhich favored the action.\r\n\r\nThis Congress adopted a declaration of rights, asserting that they alone\r\nwere empowered to tax themselves, and it named a number of acts of\r\nParliament that were a direct invasion of such rights. An address was\r\nsent to the king and to the people of Great Britain, but none to\r\nParliament, which had deeply offended the Americans. The agreement known\r\nas the Articles of Association pledged our ancestors not to buy goods or\r\nsell them to Great Britain until the obnoxious acts were repealed by\r\nParliament. It declared further that, if force was used against\r\nMassachusetts by England, all the other colonies would help her in\r\nresisting it. Before adjournment, a new Congress was called to meet in\r\nthe following May.\r\n\r\nThe language of the First Continental Congress sounds bold, but the\r\npeople themselves were bolder. Companies of armed men began drilling\r\neverywhere, and the Americans were eager for a conflict with the\r\ndetested \"red coats.\" The excitement was more intense in Massachusetts\r\nthan anywhere else, and it was plain that the opening gun of the\r\nimpending Revolution would be fired upon her soil. The affairs of the\r\ncolony were directed by a provincial congress, which collected a\r\nquantity of guns and ammunition, and ordered the enrollment of 20,000\r\n\"minute men,\" who were to hold themselves ready to answer any call at a\r\nminute's notice.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage was the British commander in Boston, and he was so alarmed\r\nby the aggressive acts of the Americans that he began to throw up\r\nfortifications on the neck of land connecting the town with the\r\nmainland. His alert spies notified him that the Americans had collected\r\na quantity of military supplies which were stored at Concord, some\r\ntwenty miles from Boston. Gage ordered 800 troops to march secretly to\r\nConcord and destroy them.\r\n\r\nGuarded as were the movements of the British, the Americans were\r\nequally watchful and discovered them. Paul Revere dashed out of the\r\ntown on a swift horse and spread the news throughout the country. In the\r\ngray light of the early morning, April 19, 1775, as the soldiers marched\r\ninto Lexington, on the way to Concord beyond, they saw some fifty minute\r\nmen gathered on the village green. Major Pitcairn ordered them to\r\ndisperse, and they refusing to do so, a volley was fired. Eight\r\nAmericans were killed and a large number wounded, the others fleeing\r\nbefore the overwhelming force. Thus was the shot fired that \"was heard\r\nround the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe British advanced to Concord, destroyed the stores there, and then\r\nbegan their return to Boston. All the church bells were ringing and the\r\nminute men were swarming around the troops from every direction. They\r\nkept up a continuous fire upon the soldiers from behind barns, houses,\r\nhedges, fences, bushes, and from the open fields. The soldiers broke\r\ninto a run, but every one would have been shot down had not Gage sent\r\nreinforcements, which protected the exhausted fugitives until they\r\nreached a point where they were under the guns of the men-of-war. In\r\nthis first real conflict of the war, the Americans lost 88 and the\r\nBritish 273 in killed, wounded, and missing. General Gage was now\r\nbesieged in Boston by the ardent minute men, who in the flush of their\r\npatriotism were eager for the regulars to come out and give them a\r\nchance for a battle. Men mounted on swift horses rode at headlong speed\r\nthrough the colonies, spreading the stirring news, and hundreds of\r\npatriots hurried to Boston that they might take part in the war for\r\ntheir rights. Elsewhere, the fullest preparations were made for the\r\nstruggle for independence which all felt had opened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY, America's greatest orator; member of the\r\nSecond Continental Congress.]\r\n\r\nAs agreed upon, the Second Continental Congress assembled in\r\nPhiladelphia, May 10, 1775. It included some of the ablest men in\r\nAmerica, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry,\r\nRichard Henry Lee, and Peyton Randolph, of Virginia; Benjamin Franklin\r\nand Robert Morris, of Pennsylvania; John Adams, Samuel Adams, and John\r\nHancock, of Massachusetts; John Jay, of New York; and Roger Sherman and\r\nOliver Ellsworth, of Connecticut. The former Congress had talked; the\r\npresent acted. By general consent it was accepted as the governing body\r\nof the colonies. The forces around Boston were declared to be a\r\nContinental army, money was voted to support it, and Washington was\r\nappointed its commander.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, British reinforcements under Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne\r\narrived in Boston, swelling Gage's army to 10,000 men. They occupied the\r\ntown, on the peninsula which covers the middle of the harbor, while\r\naround them on the hills of the mainland was a larger force of\r\nAmericans, without uniforms, poorly clothed, badly armed and\r\nundisciplined, but overflowing with patriotism.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of Boston a second peninsula extended into the\r\nharbor. It has several elevations, one of which, Bunker Hill, the\r\npatriots determined to seize and fortify. Colonel Prescott with a\r\nthousand men set out one dark night to perform the task, but, believing\r\nBreed's Hill more desirable, since it was nearer Boston, he set his men\r\nto work upon that.\r\n\r\n(The name \"Bunker\" is more euphonious than \"Breed's,\" and the latter is\r\nnow generally known by the former name. Upon it has been built the\r\nBunker Hill Monument.)\r\n\r\nAlthough close to the British sentinels, the Americans toiled through\r\nthe night without discovery. When the sun rose June 17, 1775, the enemy\r\nin Boston were astonished to see a line of intrenchments extending\r\nacross the hill above them, with the Americans still working like\r\nbeavers. They continued without interruption until noon, when the\r\nBritish were seen coming across the harbor in boats. They were the\r\nregulars, finely disciplined, and numbered nearly 3,000, who, landing\r\nnear Charlestown, formed in fine order and advanced with precision\r\nagainst the 1,500 patriots, eagerly waiting for them behind their\r\nintrenchments.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the afternoon that the British columns\r\nmarched to the attack, covered by a heavy fire of cannon and howitzers,\r\nHowe himself commanding the right wing. The steeples and roofs of Boston\r\nswarmed with people, breathlessly watching the thrilling sight.\r\nCharlestown had been fired and four hundred of its houses laid in ashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONUMENT ON BUNKER HILL.]\r\n\r\nThe Americans behind their breastworks were impatient to open fire, but\r\nPrescott restrained them until they could \"see the whites of the eyes\"\r\nof their enemies. Then in a loud, clear voice he shouted \"_Fire_!\" There\r\nwas an outflame of musketry along the front of the intrenchments, and\r\nscores of troops in the first rank fell. The others hesitated a moment,\r\nand then turned and fled down the slope. There their officers formed\r\nthem into line, and once more they advanced up the slope. The delay gave\r\nthe Americans time to reload, and they received the troops with the same\r\nwithering fire as before, sending them scurrying to the bottom of the\r\nhill, where with great difficulty the daring officers formed them into\r\nline for a third advance. The British cannon had been brought to bear,\r\nand the ships and batteries maintained a furious cannonade. The patriots\r\nwere compelled to withdraw from the breastwork outside the fort, and the\r\nredoubt was attacked at the same moment from three sides. The spectators\r\nwere confident of seeing the invaders hurled back again, but saw to\r\ntheir dismay a slackening of the fire of the Americans, while the\r\ntroops, rushing over the intrenchments, fought with clubbed muskets.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment victory was within the grasp of the patriots, their\r\nrecklessly fired ammunition gave out, and they began sullenly\r\nretreating, fighting with clubbed weapons. As it was, their retreat\r\nwould have been cut off, had not a company of provincials checked the\r\nBritish until the main body of Americans had fallen back. The battle of\r\nBunker Hill was over and ended with the defeat of the patriots, who had\r\nlost 150 killed, 270 wounded, and 80 taken prisoners. General Gage gave\r\nhis loss as 224 killed and 830 wounded. Among the killed was Major\r\nPitcairn, the leader of the English troops who fired upon the minute men\r\nat Lexington. The American Colonel Prescott had his clothing torn to\r\nshreds by bayonet thrusts, but was not hurt. A British officer,\r\nrecognizing the brilliant Warren, snatched a musket from the hands of a\r\nsoldier and shot him dead.\r\n\r\nPrescott and Putnam conducted the retreat by way of Charlestown Neck to\r\nProspect Hill, where new intrenchments commanding Boston were thrown up.\r\nThe British fortified the crest of Breed's Hill. General Gage, in\r\nreporting the affair to his government, used the following impressive\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n\"The success, which was very necessary in our present condition, cost us\r\ndear. The number of killed and wounded is greater than our forces can\r\nafford to lose. We have lost some extremely good officers. The trials we\r\nhave had show the rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have\r\nsupposed them to be, and I find it owing to a military spirit encouraged\r\namong them for a few years past, joined with uncommon zeal and\r\nenthusiasm. They intrench and raise batteries; they have engineers. They\r\nhave fortified all the heights and passes around the town, which it is\r\nnot impossible for them to occupy. The conquest of this country is not\r\neasy; you have to cope with vast numbers. In all their wars against the\r\nFrench, they never showed so much conduct, attention, and perseverance\r\nas they do now. I think it my duty to let you know the situation of\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, accompanied by his aide, Mifflin, Joseph Reed, his\r\nmilitary secretary, and General Lee, arrived at Cambridge, July 2, 1775.\r\nHe was joyfully welcomed, and he and his companions remained for a few\r\ndays the guests of President Langdon of Harvard College. On the 3th of\r\nJuly, Washington's commission was read to a part of the army and to the\r\nprovincial congress of Massachusetts, and he assumed command of the\r\nContinental forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOMINATION OF WASHINGTON AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE\r\nCONTINENTAL ARMY.]\r\n\r\nA prodigious task confronted him. The undisciplined and wretchedly clad\r\nswarm came and went as they chose, none having enlisted for more than a\r\nbrief term. About 2,000 were sick or absent on furlough, out of a total\r\nof 16,771 soldiers. Several thousand more were needed to resist the\r\nattack that it was believed the enemy would soon make. But the British\r\nhad received so severe treatment that it required weeks for them to\r\nrecover, and the summer became oppressively hot. England recalled Gage,\r\nwho sailed for home in October, and was succeeded by Howe. Washington\r\nclosely besieged the enemy in Boston. Throwing up intrenchments, he\r\nsteadily approached the city, and day by day and week by week the\r\nsituation of Howe became more critical. When winter arrived, Washington\r\nformed the plan of crossing Charles River on the ice, but at a council\r\nof war the majority of officers declared the scheme too hazardous.\r\n\r\nWashington now decided to fortify and occupy Dorchester Heights, which\r\nwould command the city and in a large degree the harbor. General Knox\r\nbrought a number of cannon from Ticonderoga, that were dragged over the\r\nGreen Mountains on sleds. Their arrival did much to cheer the spirits of\r\nthe patriots, who numbered about 14,000. The commander called upon\r\nMassachusetts to furnish him with 6,000 militia, which was partly done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, \"THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY.\"]\r\n\r\nWith a view of concealing his real purpose, Washington kept up a\r\nbombardment of the British lines throughout the nights of March 2, 3,\r\nand 4, 1776. On the night last named, General Thomas moved with 1,200\r\nmen from Roxbury and took possession undetected of the higher hill which\r\ncommanded Nook's Hill, nearer the city. General Howe was amazed the next\r\nmorning when he saw what had been done, for his position had become\r\nuntenable. Preparations were made to embark men in boats and attack the\r\nAmericans, but a violent storm prevented. Then it was agreed that but\r\none thing could be done, and that was to evacuate Boston.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation took place March 17th. The British destroyed a great\r\ndeal of property, but left many supplies behind which fell into the\r\nhands of the Americans. Washington entered the city on the 19th, the\r\nmain body of troops following the next day. The street through which he\r\nrode still bears his name. The Massachusetts Legislature voted their\r\nthanks to the great man, and Congress ordered a commemorative medal in\r\ngold and bronze to be struck. This medal is now in the possession of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society.\r\n\r\nWhen Howe sailed away, he took with him more than a thousand Tories, who\r\ndared not remain behind and meet their indignant countrymen. Instead of\r\ngoing to New York, as he originally intended, the British commander went\r\nto Halifax, where he waited for reinforcements and gave his thoughts to\r\nforming campaigns for the conquest of the colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISASTROUS INVASION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nWhile the siege of Boston was in progress, the Americans fixed upon a\r\nplan for the invasion of Canada. The mistake, which has been repeated\r\nmore than once, was in believing that the Canadians, if given the\r\nopportunity, would make common cause against Great Britain. General\r\nPhilip Schuyler was placed in command of the expedition, but fell ill,\r\nand Richard Montgomery, the second in command, took charge. He was a\r\nvaliant Irishman, who had done brilliant service in the British army,\r\nand was full of ardor for the American cause.\r\n\r\nIn several unimportant skirmishes, his men were so insubordinate and\r\ncowardly that he was disgusted, and expressed his regret that he had\r\never taken command of such a lot of troops. Nevertheless, he pressed on\r\nfrom Ticonderoga, while Schuyler at Albany used every effort to forward\r\nhim supplies. St. John was invested, and the impetuous Ethan Allen, one\r\nof his officers, hastened to Chambly to raise a force of Canadians. He\r\nrecruited nearly a hundred, and, being joined by a few Americans, set\r\nout to capture Montreal. The promised reinforcements did not reach him,\r\nand, being attacked by a powerful force, he made the best defense he\r\ncould, but was finally compelled to surrender, with all of his men who\r\nhad not escaped. Allen was sent to England, where he was held a prisoner\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nThe British fort at Chambly was besieged, and surrendered October 18th.\r\nWith its capture, the Americans secured six tons of powder and seventeen\r\ncannon. The fort of St. John was captured November 3d. By that time,\r\nCarleton, the British commander, was so alarmed that he abandoned\r\nMontreal, which surrendered on the 20th. Taking possession, Montgomery\r\nissued a proclamation, urging the Canadians to unite with the colonies\r\nin the war for independence, and to elect representatives to the\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\nBenedict Arnold, at the head of eleven hundred men, had withdrawn from\r\nthe camp before Boston, September 13th, and was pressing forward to join\r\nMontgomery. His course was up the Kennebec, through the gloomy\r\nwilderness to the Chaudiere, down which he passed to Point Levi. The\r\njourney was of the most trying nature. The weather became bitterly cold,\r\nand the stream was too swift at times for them to make headway against\r\nit, except by wading the chilly current and slowly dragging the boats\r\nagainst it. At other places, even this was impossible, and the heavy\r\nboats had to be laboriously carried around the falls and rapids.\r\n\r\nFinally the time came to leave the river and plunge into the snowy\r\nforests, where all would have been lost, had not a small party, sent in\r\nadvance, \"blazed\" the trees. There was plenty of ice in the swamps, but\r\nnone was strong enough to bear their weight, and they sank through to\r\ntheir knees in the half-frozen ooze. Toiling doggedly forward, a month\r\npassed before they reached Duck River, by which time they were in a\r\nstarving condition. Their provisions gave out, and they ate dogs and\r\ncandles. Some, in their extremity, chewed boiled moccasins for the\r\ninfinitesimal nourishment to be extracted from them. Roots and the bark\r\nof saplings were devoured, and the wonderful courage of Arnold was all\r\nthat prevented the men from throwing themselves on the ground and giving\r\nup. So many fell ill and died that Colonel Enos, in command of the rear\r\ndivision, turned about with his men and returned to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, could shake the dauntless courage of Arnold. He pushed\r\non, and, obtaining a few cattle, was able to give his men temporary\r\nrelief. Winter was closing in, the weather was growing colder every day,\r\nmany men were barefoot, and without any protection against the icy rain\r\nexcept the branches of the leafless trees. The wonder is that the whole\r\nband did not perish.\r\n\r\nFinally on the 4th of November, the famishing band caught sight of the\r\nfirst house they had seen in weeks. Traveling now became better, and\r\nabout a week later they reached Point Levi, opposite Quebec. There they\r\nhad to wait several days to procure canoes, with which the seven hundred\r\nmen, resembling so many shivering tramps, crossed the St. Lawrence and\r\nhuddled together under the Heights of Abraham.\r\n\r\nWhat earthly hope could such a body of men, without cannon, with injured\r\nmuskets and powder, and cartridges partly spoiled, have in attacking the\r\nwalled town of Quebec? None, unless the Canadians made common cause with\r\nthem. Following the steep path up which Wolfe and his brave men had\r\nclimbed seventeen years before, the gaunt Americans struggled after\r\ntheir intrepid leader.\r\n\r\nThe next act in the grim comedy was to send forward a flag of truce with\r\na demand for the surrender of Quebec. General Carleton must have smiled\r\nat the grotesqueness of the proceeding, when he sent back a refusal. A\r\nfew shots followed, when Arnold, finding he had not half a dozen rounds\r\nof ammunition apiece for his men, and was in danger of being attacked\r\nhimself, retreated to a point twenty miles below Quebec, where\r\nMontgomery joined him on the 1st of December and assumed command.\r\n\r\nThe Americans now numbered 3,000, and had six field-pieces and five\r\nlight mortars. They set out for Quebec, in front of which they encamped\r\nfour days later.\r\n\r\nOf all the series of disastrous invasions of Canada, none was more\r\ndismal and pathetic than that of Montgomery and Arnold. The winter was\r\nunusually severe for a region which is noted for its intensely cold\r\nweather. The ground froze to the hardness of a rock, and, unable to make\r\nany impression in it with shovel and pick, the besiegers threw up walls\r\nof ice, which the cannon of the defenders sent flying into thousands of\r\nfragments. The men grew mutinous, and, realizing the desperate\r\nsituation, Montgomery ordered an assault to be made on the last day of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nThe plan was for the first division under Montgomery to move down the\r\nriver and attack the lower town near the citadel, while the second\r\ndivision under Arnold was to pass around the city to the north, assault\r\nby way of the St. Charles, and unite with Montgomery in his attack upon\r\nthe Prescott gate. The other two divisions were to remain in the rear of\r\nthe upper town and divert the garrison by feint attacks.\r\n\r\nA blinding snowstorm was raging and the men could hardly distinguish one\r\nanother. Success depended upon surprise, but the defenders had learned\r\nof the intended attack, and Montgomery had hardly started when the\r\nbattery delivered a fire which instantly killed him and both his aides.\r\nTheir deaths threw his men into a panic, and they fled in such haste\r\nthat they escaped the fate of their leaders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Arnold had moved, as agreed upon, with his division along the\r\nSt. Charles, the men bending their heads to the icy blast and protecting\r\ntheir muskets under their coats. As soon as the garrison caught sight of\r\nthe dim figures they opened fire, but the Americans pressed on and\r\ncarried the first barricade. Arnold, however, received a severe wound in\r\nthe leg, and, suffering great pain, was carried to the rear. Daniel\r\nMorgan, one of the bravest officers of the Revolution, succeeded to the\r\ncommand, and, with his riflemen at his heels, was the first to climb the\r\nladders placed against the barricade. Two musket-balls grazed the\r\nleader's face, which was scorched by the flash, and he was knocked down;\r\nbut he instantly sprang to his feet and called upon his men to follow\r\nhim. They did so with such dash that the enemy took refuge in the houses\r\non both sides of the street.\r\n\r\nBut for the disaster that had overtaken Montgomery, Quebec probably\r\nwould have been captured, but Morgan's command was in darkness, the\r\ndriving snow interfered with firing, and they knew nothing of the town.\r\nOnly a few of the troops found the next barricade, and, when they\r\nclimbed the ladders, were confronted by leveled muskets whose fire was\r\nvery destructive. Not only that, but the British, who had taken refuge\r\nin the houses in the streets, kept up their firing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, NEW YORK, WHERE MONTGOMERY WAS\r\nBURIED.]\r\n\r\nThe Americans fought for a long time with the greatest heroism, but\r\nafter the loss of sixty, the remainder, with the exception of a few\r\nthat had fled, were obliged to surrender. The fragments of the helpless\r\narmy fell again under the command of the wounded Arnold, who, despite\r\nthe hopelessness of the attempt, still pressed the siege of Quebec. He\r\nhad sent an urgent message to Schuyler for reinforcements. They\r\nstraggled through the wintry forests to his aid, some 3,000 arriving in\r\nthe course of the winter. Carleton, who was too wise to venture out on\r\nthe plain as Montcalm had done, felt secure behind the walls, and gave\r\nlittle heed to the ragged swarm huddled together in front of the town.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wooster brought fresh troops in March and assumed command. He\r\nlacked military skill, and two months later was succeeded by General\r\nThomas. The latter saw that he had no more than a thousand effective\r\ntroops under his control, and decided to withdraw the ill-starred\r\nexpedition. Carleton, who had received large reinforcements, attacked\r\nhim on his retreat and captured a hundred prisoners and nearly all the\r\nstores. The sufferings of the Americans were now aggravated by smallpox,\r\nwhich broke out among them and caused many deaths, General Thomas being\r\none of the victims. General Sullivan succeeded him in command. He lost a\r\nnumber of prisoners and retreated to Ticonderoga and Crown Point, thus\r\nbringing the disastrous expedition to a close in the month of June,\r\n1776.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that tribute should be given to the humanity of Carleton,\r\nthe British commander. He caused search to be made in the snow for the\r\nbody of Montgomery, and, when it was found, it was brought into the city\r\nand buried with the honors of war. Other parties scoured the woods for\r\nthe suffering Americans, who were placed in the hospital and received\r\ntender care. Those who voluntarily came in were allowed to go as soon as\r\nthey were strong enough to travel, and to the needy ones Carleton\r\nfurnished money. A half-century later the remains of Montgomery were\r\nbrought to New York and deposited beneath the monument in St. Paul's\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION (CONTINUED).--THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE STATES AND ON THE\r\nSEA.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Independence--The American Flag--Battle of Long\r\nIsland--Washington's Retreat Through the Jerseys--Trenton and\r\nPrinceton--In Winter Quarters--Lafayette--Brandywine and Germantown--At\r\nValley Forge--Burgoyne's Campaign--Fort Schuyler and Bennington--Bemis\r\nHeights and Stillwater--The Conway Cabal--Aid from France--Battle of\r\nMonmouth--Molly Pitcher--Failure of French Aid--Massacre at\r\nWyoming--Continental Money--Stony Point--Treason of Arnold--Paul Jones'\r\nGreat Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT THEATRES OF WAR.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution, beginning in New England, gradually moved southward.\r\nAfter the first few conflicts it passed into the Middle States, which\r\nfor nearly three years became the theatre of the war. Then it shifted to\r\nthe South, which witnessed its triumphant close.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that, despite this change of scene, the colonies were\r\nardently united from the beginning in the struggle for independence. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that, for a considerable time after the\r\nbeginning of actual fighting, the Americans were not struggling so much\r\nto gain their liberty as to compel England to do them justice. But for\r\nthe stubbornness of George III., who at times was insane, the reasonable\r\nprayers of the patriots would have been granted, and our ancestors would\r\nhave been retained as subjects of the crown.\r\n\r\nBut the most far-seeing of Americans comprehended the inevitable end,\r\nwhich must be subjection to tyranny or independence. The trend of events\r\nso clearly indicated this that steps were taken looking toward the\r\nutter and final separation of the colonies from the mother country.\r\n\r\nCongress was still in session in Philadelphia, and early in June the\r\nquestion of declaring American independence was brought forward by\r\nRichard Henry Lee, of Virginia, who introduced a resolution, seconded by\r\nJohn Adams, of Massachusetts, declaring the colonies free and\r\nindependent States. The matter was of so momentous importance that it\r\nwas debated long and earnestly by the able members, but since there was\r\nno doubt that definite action would soon take place, a committee was\r\nappointed to draw up the Declaration of Independence. The members were\r\nThomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R.R.\r\nLivingston. The immortal document was the work of Thomas Jefferson, the\r\nassistance of the other members being so slight that it is not worth\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDEPENDENCE HALL, PHILADELPHIA. (Washington's statue in\r\nfront.)]\r\n\r\nThe debate over the Declaration, after it was read to Congress, was\r\nearnest, and considerable difference of opinion developed, but on the\r\n4th of July it was adopted and signed by every member present, excepting\r\none, while the absent delegates afterward attached their signatures.\r\nThornton, the member from New Hampshire, signed it precisely four\r\nmonths after its adoption. John Hancock, being President of the\r\nCongress, placed his name first in his large, bold hand, and it\r\nappropriately stands by itself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Declaration was adopted, it was ordered that copies of it\r\nshould be sent to the various assemblies, conventions, and committees or\r\ncouncils of safety, to the commanding officers of the Continental\r\ntroops, and that it should be proclaimed in each of the United States\r\nand at the head of the army.\r\n\r\nIt was received everywhere with delight. Bells were rung, bonfires\r\nkindled, and eloquent addresses made. The old Liberty Bell, still\r\ncarefully preserved in Independence Hall, sent out its note over the\r\ncity and across the Delaware. How appropriate is the inscription on the\r\nbell, cast many years before anyone dreamed of the American Revolution:\r\n\"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIBERTY BELL, AS EXHIBITED AT THE NEW ORLEANS\r\nEXPOSITION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN FLAG.\r\n\r\nNow that the nation was born, it required a flag under which to fight\r\nfor its independence. Various patterns had been used. The one first\r\nraised over the American troops at Boston contained thirteen stripes, as\r\nat present, but, in place of white stars in a blue field, it displayed a\r\nunion of the crosses of St. Andrew and St. George. Numerous designs were\r\nsubmitted to Congress, but the first recognized Continental standard was\r\nthat raised by Washington, January 2, 1776. By resolution of Congress,\r\nJune 14, 1777, this was replaced by the pattern as it is to-day,\r\nexcepting in the number of stars. The rule is that whenever a new State\r\nis admitted to the Union its representative star shall appear in the\r\nblue field of the banner on the 4th of July following its admission.\r\n\r\nDespite the enthusiasm with which the Declaration of Independence was\r\nreceived everywhere, the affairs of the States (as they must now be\r\ncalled) were by no means encouraging. Montgomery and Arnold were engaged\r\nupon their disastrous invasion of Canada, and the city of New York was\r\nin grave peril from the enemy. Moreover, England was not to be\r\nfrightened by the Declaration of Independence. The angered king and\r\nParliament put forth more strenuous efforts than before to conquer their\r\nrebellious subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEE IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington entered Boston after the British evacuation, he\r\nimmediately sent six of his best regiments to New York, which he was\r\nconvinced would soon be attacked. General Charles Lee had been placed in\r\ncommand there and Washington intended to follow. The people in New York\r\nwere alive to their danger and Lee did his utmost to strengthen the\r\ndefenses. An intrenched camp was laid out on Columbia Heights, on the\r\nBrooklyn side, to guard the town against an attack from the sea, and\r\nanother intrenched camp was erected on the New York side, between Fulton\r\nand Wall Streets. This was named Fort Stirling and was an important\r\nposition, since it permitted the batteries to sweep the channel, or, in\r\ncase of the occupation of the city by an enemy, they could be bombarded.\r\nA fort was built opposite Hell Gate to defend an approach by way of the\r\nSound, while works were placed below Canal Street to cover the river.\r\nThere were no fortifications, however, on the Jersey shore.\r\n\r\nLee ruled with a high hand in New York, showing no consideration to the\r\nTories and making himself highly popular with the revolutionary party.\r\nHaving been placed in command of the southern department, he left New\r\nYork, and Lord Stirling (an American who inherited his title) succeeded\r\nhim. He put forth every effort to make the city impregnable, following\r\nthe advice and orders of Washington, who knew the necessity of such\r\nrigorous measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAVE DEFENSE OF CHARLESTON.\r\n\r\nThe British plan of campaign was to capture the city of New York,\r\noverrun the State, push the war in the South, and invade the Northern\r\nStates from Canada. The South Carolinans, as soon as they heard the news\r\nof Lexington, began fortifying the harbor of Charleston. These included\r\nthe barricading of the streets, in case of the capture of the harbor\r\ndefenses. General Lee, as soon as he arrived, inspected the defenses and\r\ngave it as his opinion that they were not strong enough to resist the\r\nBritish fleet and the forts would be knocked into ruins.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Colonel Moultrie, \"we'll fight behind the ruins.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no means of retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since we shall not retreat, no means are needed.\"\r\n\r\nLee, although still apprehensive, yielded to the bravery of the\r\ndefenders and agreed to do his utmost to assist them in their defense.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of June, 2,500 British troops landed with the intention of\r\nwading across to Sullivan's Island, but found the supposed ford too\r\ndeep. Delays followed, and on the 28th the fleet under Admiral Parker\r\nopened the attack on the fort. The palmetto logs of which it was\r\ncomposed were the best possible material, since they were too spongy to\r\nbe shattered, and seemed to absorb the ponderous balls hurled against\r\nthem. The return fire of the garrison wrought great havoc among the\r\nvessels, and the battle raged fiercely for hours.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was obscured by the blinding smoke, the flag staff of\r\nthe fort was cut away by a cannon ball. It had scarcely fallen, when\r\nSergeant William Jasper sprang through one of the embrasures, caught up\r\nthe flag, climbed the wall amid a frightful fire, waved it defiantly at\r\nthe enemy, fastened it to a pike, fixed it in place, and then coolly\r\nleaped down among his comrades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ON GOVERNOR'S ISLAND, IN NEW YORK\r\nHARBOR. (Presented to the United States by Bartholdi.)]\r\n\r\nThat night Admiral Parker withdrew his fleet, having lost more than two\r\nhundred in killed and wounded, while of the Americans only ten had been\r\nkilled and twenty-nine wounded. The triumph of the patriots was\r\nabsolute, and General Lee in a letter to Washington wrote that he was\r\nenraptured by the coolness and bravery of the defenders. In honor of the\r\ngallant conduct of Colonel Moultrie, the fort was given his name, and\r\nthe whole country was inspired by what was certainly one of the most\r\nremarkable achievements of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNSATISFACTORY SITUATION.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the war, however, was less satisfactory in the North. On\r\nthe same day that the British attacked Fort Moultrie, a part of the\r\nfleet from Nova Scotia appeared off Sandy Hook, with the purpose of\r\nattacking the city. Before Lee left for the South, he expressed the\r\nopinion that no fleet could capture it, but Washington, after arriving\r\nand inspecting the defenses, failed to share his confidence, and\r\nstrengthened the works in every way possible.\r\n\r\nBelieving Governor's Island a place of strategic importance, General\r\nPutnam had seized it before the arrival of Washington, and threw up a\r\nnumber of breastworks, occupying also Red Hook on Long Island. Then\r\nPaulus Hook (now Jersey City) was fortified and hulks were sunk in the\r\nchannel between Governor's Island and the Battery. The erection of Fort\r\nLee, up the Hudson, was begun during the summer, on the Palisades, while\r\nFort Washington was built on the New York side. By the time the fleet\r\narrived, about a hundred cannon and mortars were ready for service.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HOWE'S FIRST MOVE.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tryon, formerly of North Carolina, was now Governor of New York\r\nand a bitter Tory. There were thousands who thought like him, and they\r\nwelcomed General Howe, whose intention was to land on Long Island, but\r\nthe strong defenses of the Americans caused him to disembark his troops\r\non Staten Island. Admiral Howe, brother of the general, arrived soon\r\nafter, and, in August, the Hessians swelled the British force to 32,000\r\nmen. The Hessians were natives of Hesse-Cassel, Germany, and were hired\r\nby England. De Heister, their commander, was a veteran of many\r\ncampaigns, and they formed fully one-fourth of the enemy's forces.\r\nCompared with this formidable array, the Americans presented a pitiful\r\nplight. They were scarcely one-half as numerous, were poorly armed and\r\ndisciplined, most of them without uniforms, while many were lacking in\r\ncourage, as their commander was to learn to his cost.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe's first move was to send two ships and three tenders up the\r\nHudson, aiming to cut off Washington's communication with the country\r\nand Canada. At the same time, he wished to take soundings of the river\r\nand encourage the Tories, who were more plentiful than would be\r\nsupposed. Several weeks were spent in this work, during which one of\r\nthe tenders was burned by the Americans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD NEW YORK MANSION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DEFEAT ON LONG ISLAND.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of August, the British troops were moved from Staten\r\nIsland to Gravesend Bay on Long Island, and it was evident that Howe,\r\ninstead of bombarding New York, meant to advance upon it from across\r\nLong Island. In anticipation of this movement, Washington had stationed\r\nGeneral Greene's division at Brooklyn. Unfortunately that admirable\r\nofficer was ill, and General Sullivan took his place. He boastingly\r\ndeclared that no force of the British could carry his fortification,\r\nand, indeed, was so foolishly confident, that Washington superseded him\r\nwith Israel Putnam, who was no better, for he left the pass on the\r\nBritish right unguarded. Quick to discover the oversight, the enemy took\r\nadvantage of it, and in the battle of Long Island, fought August 27th,\r\nthe Americans suffered disastrous defeat. Sullivan was caught between\r\ntwo fires, and, fighting with the energy of desperation, most of his men\r\ncut their way through the English line and reached Brooklyn. Lord\r\nStirling's division was surprised in the same manner and few escaped the\r\nenemy. By noon the victory of the British was complete.\r\n\r\nWashington with deep anguish witnessed the overwhelming disaster. He\r\nhurriedly crossed to Brooklyn and sent forward every man that could be\r\nspared, but nothing availed to check the panic of the rest of the\r\nforces, who were chased to the foot of the lines in Brooklyn. Howe was\r\nso confident of bagging the whole lot that, in order to save loss of\r\nlife, he resorted to regular approaches.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Americans could not have been more critical, for,\r\nwhen the British fleet passed up the river, their supplies would be cut\r\noff. Three hundred patriots had been killed and wounded, and among the\r\nprisoners were Lord Stirling and General Sullivan. The Americans in\r\nBrooklyn numbered 10,000, while the enemy were twice as numerous.\r\n\r\nWhen it looked as if all hope was gone, the elements came to the relief\r\nof the sorely beset patriots. A violent head-wind held back the ships,\r\nand a tremendous downpour of rain on the 28th and 29th suspended\r\noperations. It was so clear that the only course open was to evacuate\r\nBrooklyn, that the work was begun and pressed incessantly for thirteen\r\nhours, the rain and fog hiding the movement from Howe. Too weak to hold\r\nthe city against him, there was nothing left to do but to retreat,\r\nfuture movements being guided by events.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF NEW YORK BY THE BRITISH.\r\n\r\nFour ships ascended the river, September 13th, and anchored a mile above\r\nthe city. Others followed. The movement, however, was a feint, intended\r\nto cover General Howe's attack by land. Before the latter, the Americans\r\nmade such a cowardly flight that Washington and other officers were\r\nfilled with irrestrainable rage, struck many with the flat of their\r\nswords, and threatened to run them through. But nothing could check the\r\npanic, until they joined the main body at Harlem. In this manner, the\r\ncity of New York fell into the hands of the British, who captured 300\r\nprisoners, a number of cannon, and a large quantity of stores. The\r\nAmerican army pulled itself together on Harlem Heights, while the enemy\r\nencamped in front, their right resting on the East River and their left\r\non the Hudson, with both flanks supported by armed ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHAN HALE, THE \"MARTYR SPY.\"\r\n\r\nWhile General Howe occupied New York, one of the most pathetic incidents\r\nof the Revolution occurred. It was of the highest importance that\r\nWashington should gain information of the intentions and the strength of\r\nthe enemy. In order to do so, Captain Nathan Hale, of Connecticut,\r\nvoluntarily entered the British lines disguised as a spy. He did his\r\nwork with shrewdness and skill, but on his return, and when about to\r\nre-enter the American lines, he was recognized and captured. When\r\naccused, he admitted his identity and business, and without trial was\r\ncondemned to death. He was brutally treated by the provost-marshal, who\r\nrefused him a light to read his Bible, and destroyed the letters he\r\nwrote to his mother. He was hanged the morning after his capture, his\r\nlast words being: \"My only regret is that I have but one life to give to\r\nmy country.\"\r\n\r\nThe months passed without any important movement on either side. Howe\r\nmade careful preparations and Washington closely watched him. The\r\nContinental army was divided into four divisions, commanded respectively\r\nby Generals Heath, Sullivan, Lincoln, and Lee (who had lately returned\r\nfrom the South). At a council of war it was decided that Harlem Heights\r\ncould not be held against the enemy, but at the urgent request of\r\nGeneral Greene, a strong garrison was left in Fort Washington. It\r\nnumbered 3,000, and was under the command of Colonel Robert Magaw of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED RETREAT OF THE AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan agreed upon, Washington fell slowly back and\r\nwas attacked at White Plains. He inflicted severe loss on the enemy, but\r\ncontinued to retreat, whereupon Howe turned back and assailed Fort\r\nWashington with such an overwhelming force that Colonel Magaw\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nWashington's fear now was that the British would press a campaign\r\nagainst Philadelphia, the capital. Accordingly, he crossed to New\r\nJersey, and, with General Greene, took position at Fort Lee. The enemy\r\nthreatened it with such a large force that it was abandoned and he began\r\nhis retreat through New Jersey, with Cornwallis, the ablest of the\r\nBritish generals, in close pursuit. The two armies were frequently so\r\nnear each other that they exchanged shots.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARK DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThe \"dark days\" of the Revolution had come. Winter was at hand, and\r\nhundreds of the ragged Continentals, as they tramped over the frozen\r\nroads, left the bloody prints of their bare feet on the ground. Many\r\nlost heart, and the desertions were so numerous that it looked as if the\r\nwhole army would crumble to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe remark has often been made of Washington that he never won a battle,\r\nbut the wonder is that he did so well with the miserable force under his\r\ncommand. His greatness, however, rests upon a much broader foundation.\r\nHe, far more than any other man, saw the end from the beginning, and\r\nembodied within himself the spirit of the struggle for American\r\nindependence. He was the Revolution. Had he been killed, the struggle\r\nwould have stopped, for no one could have been his successor. Subjected\r\nto trials whose exasperating nature it is impossible for us to\r\ncomprehend, he never lost heart. He pressed forward with sublime faith\r\nthat no disaster, defeat, or misfortune could weaken. Moreover, let it\r\nnot be forgotten that he fought from the opening to the close of the\r\nstruggle without accepting a cent in the way of payment.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington reached the little town of Trenton, he was joined by\r\nStirling, the junction raising the force to 5,000 men. General Lee,\r\ndisobeying orders, marched so tardily that he was captured at Basking\r\nRidge, N.J., by a company of British horse. Investigations that have\r\nsince been made leave no doubt that Lee purposely allowed himself to be\r\ntaken, and that while in the enemy's hands he offered to do all he could\r\nin the way of betrayal of his country. Washington crossed the Delaware\r\ninto Pennsylvania, just as Cornwallis entered the upper end of the town.\r\n\r\nThe great man, knowing the universal depression, saw that a blow must be\r\nstruck to raise the drooping spirits of his countrymen. Otherwise the\r\nstruggle would collapse from sheer despair. As for the enemy, they gave\r\nscarcely a thought to the shivering ragamuffins on the other side of the\r\nriver. The Hessian commander, Colonel Rall, had occupied the town with\r\nhis men, and they prepared to enjoy life to the full. Rall drank toddy,\r\nsmoked, and played cards, while the wintry winds roared outside. Perhaps\r\na feeling akin to pity moved him when he thought of the starving,\r\nfreezing Continentals who were foolish enough to rebel against the rule\r\nof the great and good King George III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF TRENTON.\r\n\r\nWashington determined to attack the Hessians in Trenton. He divided his\r\narmy into three divisions, sending one to Bristol, opposite Burlington,\r\nanother remained opposite Trenton, while he himself marched several\r\nmiles up stream to a point since known as Washington's Crossing.\r\n\r\nThe movements down the river were to be directed against the enemy's\r\ndetachments at Bordentown, Burlington, and Mount Holly, but the stream\r\nwas so choked with masses of floating ice that neither division was able\r\nto force its way over. Washington, with 2,500 of the best officers and\r\nmen in the army, crossed the stream in the face of a driving storm of\r\nsnow and sleet, and, reaching the village of Birmingham, several miles\r\ninland, divided his force. Sullivan took the road which runs close to\r\nand parallel with the river, while Washington, with Greene, followed the\r\nScotch road. The latter joins the upper part of the town, while the\r\nriver road enters the lower end. The plan was for the two divisions to\r\nstrike Trenton at the same time and attack the Hessians in front and\r\nrear. It was hardly light on the morning succeeding Christmas, 1776,\r\nwhen Washington drove in the sentinels and advanced rapidly in the\r\ndirection of Sullivan, the report of whose guns showed that he had\r\narrived on time and was vigorously pressing matters.\r\n\r\nThe rattle of musketry and the boom of cannon roused the startled\r\nHessians, who made the best defense possible. Colonel Rall leaped from\r\nhis bed, and, hastily donning his clothes, strove to collect and form\r\nhis men. While doing so he was mortally wounded. The moment quickly came\r\nwhen his situation was hopeless. Supported on either side by a sergeant,\r\nRall walked painfully forward to where Washington was seated on his\r\nhorse, and, handing his sword to him, asked that mercy should be shown\r\nhis men. Washington assured him his request was unnecessary. Rall was\r\ncarried to a building, where, as he lay on the bed, he was visited by\r\nWashington, who expressed his sympathy for his sufferings, which soon\r\nwere terminated by death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Trenton, as it is known in history, was remarkable in more\r\nthan one respect. The Americans captured 950 prisoners, six guns, a\r\nlarge number of small arms, killed twenty and wounded nearly a hundred\r\nof the enemy. Of the Americans, four were wounded and two killed, and it\r\nis probable that these deaths were due to the extreme cold rather than\r\nthe aim of the Hessians, whose work is very suggestive of that of the\r\nSpaniards in the late war.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of the victory, however, was almost beyond estimate.\r\nThe threatening clouds that had so long darkened the land were\r\nscattered, and the glorious sun of hope burst through and cheered all.\r\nThe triumph may be summed up in the expression that it marked the\r\n\"turning of the tide.\" Reverses were yet waiting for the Americans, but\r\nthe war for independence was steadily to advance to its triumphant\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF THE VICTORY.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Washington at Trenton, however, was critical.\r\nCornwallis with his powerful force was at Princeton, ten miles distant,\r\nand was sure to advance against him as soon as he learned of the reverse\r\nat Trenton. Washington, therefore, recrossed the Delaware on the same\r\nday of the victory, with his prisoners and captured war material. One\r\nresult was that the British, as soon as they learned what had taken\r\nplace, abandoned South Jersey.\r\n\r\nWashington remained three days in Pennsylvania, when he again crossed\r\nthe Delaware and re-entered Trenton. More than 3,000 reinforcements\r\njoined him, and 1,400 New England soldiers, whose terms of enlistment\r\nwere expiring, were so inspired by the victory that they volunteered for\r\nsix weeks longer. Robert Morris, to whom we have referred as the\r\nfinancier of the Revolution, raised $50,000 in specie and sent it to\r\nWashington to be used in paying the troops, who very sorely needed it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cornwallis was told by his scouts that Washington had\r\nreturned to Trenton, he advanced against him with a force of 7,000 men,\r\ndetermined to wipe out the disgrace of a few days before. This was on\r\nthe 2d of January, 1777. Greene held the British commander in check\r\nuntil the close of the day, when he was able to drive the Americans to\r\nthe eastern shore of the Assunpink Creek, which runs through the middle\r\nof the town and was spanned by a wooden bridge. There was brisk fighting\r\nat this bridge, but the cannon of Washington were so effective that the\r\nBritish troops gave up the attempt to force a passage until the morning\r\nof the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON'S CRITICAL SITUATION.\r\n\r\nThe two armies encamped in sight of each other on opposite banks of the\r\nAssunpink, their camp-fires and sentinels in plain sight. The situation\r\nof the American army could not have been more critical. Behind it was\r\nthe Delaware filled with floating ice and in front the superior army of\r\nCornwallis, confident of capturing Washington and his forces on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nBut when the raw wintry morning dawned, Cornwallis was astounded to hear\r\nthe booming of cannon in the direction of Princeton, ten miles behind\r\nhim. Washington had withdrawn his entire force, and, reaching the\r\ncollege town by a roundabout course, was driving the British troops\r\nbefore him. The chagrined and angered Cornwallis hurried to Princeton\r\nin order to avert the threatened disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PRINCETON.\r\n\r\nBut Washington had already won a victory, scattering the British forces\r\nright and left. Although he lost a number of brave officers and men, he\r\nkilled sixty of the enemy and captured 250 prisoners. When Cornwallis\r\narrived the Americans were gone, and the British troops hurried to\r\nBrunswick (now New Brunswick) to protect the stores there. Washington\r\nwithdrew to Morristown, where he went into winter quarters and remained\r\nuntil May, much of the time being devoted to making forays upon the\r\nenemy, who now and then retaliated in kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GIVE THEM WATTS, BOYS!\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit shown by our sturdy patriots is well illustrated by the story\r\nof the minister, who, when in one battle there was a lack of wadding,\r\nbrought out an armful of hymn books and exclaimed: \"Give them Watts,\r\nboys!\"]\r\n\r\nWashington left Morristown on the 28th of May, aware that Howe intended\r\nto make a campaign against Philadelphia. There was considerable\r\nmanoeuvring by the two armies, Howe trying to flank Washington, who\r\nwas too alert to be entrapped, and no material advantage was gained by\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a number of foreign officers joined the American army.\r\nThe most distinguished was the Marquis de Lafayette, who served without\r\npay and won the gratitude of the whole country because of his devotion\r\nto the cause of American independence and his intimate friendship with\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, being driven out of New Jersey, the British pushed their\r\ncampaign against Philadelphia by way of the Chesapeake. In August, 1777,\r\nSir William Howe sailed from New York with 16,000 troops, and, on the\r\n24th, reached the head of Elk River in Maryland. At Brandywine, on the\r\n11th of September, the American army was defeated with severe loss,\r\nLafayette being among the wounded. Washington entered Philadelphia the\r\nnext day, and, crossing the Schuylkill, posted his troops on the eastern\r\nbank of the river, with detachments at the ferries where it was thought\r\nthe enemy were likely to attempt to cross. General Wayne concealed\r\nhimself and 1,500 men in the woods, intending to attack the British in\r\nthe rear, but a Tory betrayed his presence to the enemy, who in a\r\nfurious assault slew 300 of his men. This disaster is known in history\r\nas the Paoli Massacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH OCCUPATION OF PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nHowe, having gained control of the Schuylkill, crossed with his army,\r\nand, advancing to Germantown, took possession of Philadelphia on the\r\n27th of September. The main body remained in Germantown, while the\r\nAmerican army, now reinforced to 11,000, were on the eastern side of the\r\nSchuylkill, eighteen miles distant. Howe was engaged in reducing the\r\nforts on the Delaware to open a passage for his fleet, when Washington\r\nadvanced against the force at Germantown, hoping to surprise it. He\r\nwould have succeeded, but for several obstacles wholly unexpected. The\r\nstone building known as the \"Chew House\" offered a stubborn resistance\r\nand defied the cannon fired against it. The delay caused by the attempt\r\nto reduce it gave the enemy time to rally. Besides, the dense fog\r\ndisorganized the attack, and more than once bodies of Americans fired\r\ninto one another. On the verge of victory, a retreat was ordered and the\r\nAmericans fell back, after having suffered a loss of 1,200 men. Congress\r\non the approach of the enemy fled to the little town of York,\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON AT VALLEY FORGE.\r\n\r\nWhile the British were holding high revel in Philadelphia, the\r\nContinentals shivered and starved at Valley Forge, twenty miles away.\r\nThousands of the men were without shoes and stockings. In each log hut\r\nwere twelve privates, who had scarcely any bedding, and who kept from\r\nfreezing at night by the mutual warmth of their bodies. The farmers of\r\nthe neighborhood were so unpatriotic that Washington was often compelled\r\nto take straw and grain from them by force, giving in return an order\r\nupon the government for the property thus used. It is said that Isaac\r\nPotts, a Quaker at whose house Washington made his headquarters, was\r\npassing through the woods one day, when he heard the voice of some one\r\nin prayer. Peering among the trees he saw Washington on his knees,\r\nbeseeching the help of heaven in the struggle for liberty. When Potts\r\nreturned to his home and related the incident to his wife, he added that\r\nhe could no longer doubt the success of the Americans, since he had\r\nheard Washington praying for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON AT VALLEY FORGE.]\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that one of the most important campaigns planned by\r\nthe British was that of invading New York from Canada. If successful,\r\nNew England would be cut off from the other States and forced to submit.\r\nFormidable preparations were made for this movement. An army of more\r\nthan 7,000 British and Hessian troops, in addition to a corps of\r\nartillery, was placed under the command of General Burgoyne, who was\r\naccompanied by several members of Parliament, who had crossed the ocean\r\nfor the pleasure of witnessing the overthrow of the rebellious\r\nAmericans. The route was from Canada by way of Lake Champlain to Albany,\r\nwhere the army was to be joined by a strong force to be sent up the\r\nHudson from New York. Clinton failed to carry out his part, because of\r\nthe delay in sending to him from London a detailed account of the\r\nintended plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLEVER STRATAGEM.\r\n\r\nAt Crown Point, Burgoyne was joined by a number of Indian allies, a\r\nproceeding which greatly incensed the patriots. It was arranged that\r\nanother body of British troops under Colonel St. Leger, including\r\nIndians and Tories, were to ascend the St. Lawrence to Lake Ontario, and\r\nadvance across the State by way of the Mohawk to Albany. Carrying out\r\nthis programme, St. Leger invested Fort Schuyler at the head of the\r\nMohawk, with a force of 1,800 men. While General Herkimer was hurrying\r\nwith some militia to the relief of the garrison, he was ambuscaded by a\r\ndetachment of British and Indians and killed, but an advance from the\r\nfort drove off his assailants. St. Leger persisted in his siege of the\r\nfort, and Benedict Arnold marched with a brigade to attack him. His\r\nforce, however, was so weak that he saw the folly of assault, and had\r\nrecourse to an ingenious and successful stratagem. He sent an\r\nunderwitted boy, who had been arrested as a Tory, into the British camp\r\nwith the story that the reinforcements just arrived for the Americans\r\nnumbered several thousand, the fable being confirmed shortly after by an\r\nIndian scout. St. Leger was so frightened that he fled to Canada,\r\nleaving his tents and most of his military stores.\r\n\r\nThe Americans abandoned Fort Ticonderoga before the advance of Burgoyne,\r\nwho reached Fort Edward, while General Schuyler crossed the Hudson and\r\nassumed position at Saratoga. Burgoyne crossed the river on the 13th and\r\n14th of September, and General Gates, lately appointed to the command of\r\nthe northern department, advanced toward the enemy and encamped a few\r\nmiles north of Stillwater. On the night of the 17th, the two armies were\r\nwithin four miles of each other, and, two days later, Burgoyne attacked\r\nGates. The loss on each side was severe, but the result was indecisive.\r\n\r\nA danger of another character threatened the invading army. Provisions\r\nand supplies were running out, and it was impossible to obtain more. No\r\nhelp arrived from Clinton, the desertions were numerous, and, realizing\r\nhis desperate situation, Burgoyne determined to drive the Americans from\r\ntheir position on the left and then retreat to Canada. He made a\r\ndetermined attempt, but was defeated with the loss of several hundred\r\nmen, including a number of his best officers, nine pieces of artillery,\r\nand the encampment and equipage of a Hessian brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF BURGOYNE.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates now disposed his forces so as almost completely to\r\nsurround Burgoyne, who called a council of war, at which it was agreed\r\nthat nothing was left for them but to capitulate. Accordingly, October\r\n17, 1777, he surrendered his army to General Gates. This consisted of\r\n5,763 officers and men, including the disappointed members of\r\nParliament. All the Indians having fled, none was left of them to\r\nsurrender. The spoils of war included a fine train of artillery of\r\nforty-two pieces, 5,000 muskets, and a vast quantity of ammunition and\r\nstores. The prisoners were treated with great kindness, their captors\r\nsharing their food with them.\r\n\r\nThe news of the loss of one of her most important armies caused dismay\r\nin England and unbounded rejoicing in America. It was the climax of the\r\ntriumph at Trenton, and renewed hope thrilled the country from New\r\nEngland to Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONWAY CABAL.\r\n\r\nCongress awarded a gold medal to Gates for his capture of Burgoyne, and\r\nhe was placed at the head of the new board of war. He was puffed up over\r\nhis victory, for which most of the credit was due to Schuyler and\r\nArnold. Finding congenial spirits in General Mifflin and an Irishman\r\nnamed Conway, both members of the board, including also General Charles\r\nLee, who had been exchanged, a plot was formed for displacing Washington\r\nand putting Gates in supreme command of military affairs. The \"Conway\r\nCabal\" utterly failed, for there were precious few in the country who\r\ndid not appreciate the lofty character of Washington, and none except\r\nthe plotters felt sympathy with any attempt to dim the lustre of the\r\nname that will always be among the brightest in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nAID FROM FRANCE.\r\n\r\nOne of the immeasurable advantages that followed the capture of Burgoyne\r\nwas our alliance with France. That country sympathized with us from the\r\nfirst, though her traditional hatred of England had much to do with the\r\nsentiment, but hitherto her assistance had been secret. She wished a\r\ngood pretext for coming out openly, and this was furnished by the\r\ncapture of Burgoyne. Franklin was in France as our representative, and\r\nhis quaint wit and homely wisdom made him very popular at the gay court.\r\nHe urged the claims of the United States so forcibly that the king\r\nyielded, and concluded a treaty, February 6, 1778, by which the\r\nindependence of the United States was acknowledged and relations of\r\nreciprocal friendship formed with our country. This was the first treaty\r\nmade by the United States with a foreign country. France agreed to send\r\na fleet of sixteen war-vessels, under D'Estaing, and an army of 4,000\r\nmen to our assistance. Great Britain at once declared war against\r\nFrance, and offered to give the United States freedom from taxation and\r\nrepresentation in Parliament if they would join in the hostilities\r\nagainst her old enemy. The Americans were incapable of so perfidious a\r\ncourse, and were now fully determined on securing their independence.\r\nSpain joined France, in 1779, in the war against Great Britain (because\r\nof the relations of the ruling families), and Holland for commercial\r\nreasons united with them in 1780. Thus Great Britain soon found her\r\nhands full.\r\n\r\nCongress decided, while Washington was at Valley Forge, that the army\r\nshould consist of 40,000 foot, besides artillery and horse. Washington\r\nhad 12,000, while the total American force under arms was barely 15,000.\r\nAt the same time the British had 30,000 troops in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, besides 3,700 in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVACUATION OF PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nThe British army occupied Philadelphia from September, 1777, until June\r\nthe following year. Admiral Howe's fleet lay in the Delaware, and\r\nGeneral Howe, who was of a sluggish temperament, was superseded by Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, between whom and Cornwallis the relations soon became\r\nstrained. With a view of concentrating the British forces, and, since\r\nthe French fleet was known to have sailed for America, it was decided\r\nthat the army in Philadelphia should be removed to New York. Wishing to\r\nstrike France, it was determined to make a descent upon the French West\r\nIndies, for which 5,000 troops were to be detached from the army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD COLONIAL HOUSE OF GERMANTOWN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF MONMOUTH.\r\n\r\nClinton found that he had not enough transports to take his troops to\r\nNew York, and a considerable number started overland. On the same day\r\nthat he marched out of Philadelphia, Washington's vanguard entered it.\r\nOn the 28th, Clinton was encamped near Monmouth Court-House, New Jersey\r\n(now Freehold), with Washington close upon him. With five miles\r\nseparating the two armies at night, Lee, who had command of 5,000 men,\r\nmoved them nearer the enemy, Washington having ordered him to attack in\r\nthe morning as soon as Clinton began moving.\r\n\r\nThe days were the longest in the year and the heat frightful. At the\r\nearliest dawn, Washington was notified that the enemy had started toward\r\nNew York. He ordered Lee to advance and open battle without delay,\r\nunless he saw urgent reasons for not doing so. Washington at the same\r\ntime pushed forward with the main body to his support.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made about eight o'clock, but the reports of the\r\nmovements were so confusing that those of the Americans became\r\ndisjointed; but everything was going in their favor, when greater\r\nconfusion caused a falling back of the patriots, with the result that at\r\nnoon Lee's whole division was in retreat, and he had started to follow\r\nthem when he came face to face with Washington himself.\r\n\r\nThose who saw the meeting never forgot it. It required immense\r\nprovocation to rouse Washington's anger, but he was in a savage mood,\r\nand in a voice of thunder demanded of Lee the meaning of his retreat.\r\nLee was confused, but, breaking in upon him, the commander ordered him\r\nto the rear, while he took command. The battle lasted until five o clock\r\nin the afternoon, scores on each side succumbing from the heat. While\r\nthe advantage was with the Americans, the battle was indecisive, and\r\nWashington anxiously waited for daylight to complete his victory; but\r\nClinton moved away in the night, and, reaching Sandy Hook, was taken\r\naboard of Howe's fleet and landed in New York on the 5th of July.\r\nWashington marched to the Hudson, crossed at King's Ferry, and took\r\nposition near his former camp at White Plains. Lee was court-martialed\r\nand dismissed for his conduct, and, as stated elsewhere, it has been\r\nproven that he was a traitor to the American cause.\r\n\r\nThere are several interesting facts connected with the battle of\r\nMonmouth, on whose grounds a fine monument was erected some years ago.\r\nAmong the British grenadiers slain was a sergeant who was seven feet\r\nfour inches in height. So many of these grenadiers were killed that\r\nthirteen were buried in one grave. Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton, their\r\ncommander, was among the slain. On the pews and floor of the old Tennent\r\nchurch, still standing on the scene of the battle, may be seen the dark\r\nstains from the wounds of several soldiers who were carried within the\r\nquaint structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF MOLLY PITCHER.\r\n\r\nIt would never do to omit the story of Molly Pitcher from the account\r\nof the battle of Monmouth, for the incident is true, and is\r\ncommemorated on one of the bronze reliefs of the monument. Her husband\r\nwas a cannoneer, who with his companions suffered so much from thirst\r\nthat Molly was kept busy carrying water for them from a neighboring\r\nspring. While thus engaged, her husband was killed before her eyes, and\r\nthere being no one available to handle the piece, an officer ordered its\r\nremoval. Molly asked the privilege of taking her husband's place.\r\nPermission was given, and she handled the cannon with skill throughout\r\nthe entire action.\r\n\r\nThe incident was told to Washington, who after the battle asked that she\r\nbe presented to him. He complimented her warmly, and conferred upon her\r\nthe rank of lieutenant, while Congress gave her half-pay during life.\r\nThe State of Pennsylvania, where she afterward made her home at\r\nCarlisle, added to this, so that she lived in comfort for the rest of\r\nher days. Her right name was Mary McAuley, and she died in Carlisle in\r\n1833, a fine slab of marble marking her last resting-place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE AID FROM FRANCE.\r\n\r\nDespite the great expectations roused by the friendship of France and\r\nthe arrival of her fleet, it gave little aid to the Americans until the\r\nYorktown campaign. D'Estaing had a fine opportunity of forcing his way\r\ninto New York, destroying the British fleet and blockading Clinton, but\r\nhe lacked the courage to do so. Then he sailed for Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, to attack the British forces there, but matters were so delayed\r\nthat Howe arrived with a fleet of equal strength. While they were\r\nmanoeuvring for position, a violent storm arose, and, at the close,\r\nD'Estaing sailed to Boston for repairs, taking all his troops with him,\r\nwhile Howe returned to New York.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were indignant over the desertion of their allies. The\r\nFrench officers were insulted on the streets of Boston, and one of them\r\nwas killed in a brawl. Sullivan and Greene were so outspoken that it\r\nrequired all the shrewdness of Washington and Congress to prevent an\r\nopen rupture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WYOMING MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1778, a band of Tories and Indians entered the\r\nlovely valley of Wyoming, under the leadership of Colonel John Butler,\r\nwhose cousin, Colonel Zebulon Butler, was commander of the old men and\r\nboys left in the town by the departure of nearly all of the able-bodied\r\nmen to fight in the Continental armies. The patriots made a brave\r\ndefense, but they were overcome and put to flight. Women and children\r\nran to the woods, in which they were overtaken and tomahawked; others\r\ndied from exposure, while a few succeeded in reaching the towns on the\r\nupper Delaware. This sad massacre has made the name of Wyoming known\r\nthroughout the world, and gives a sad pathos to the monument which was\r\nerected in 1824 over the bones of the victims.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENT OF THE IROQUOIS.\r\n\r\nSome months later, Cherry Valley in New York suffered a similar\r\nvisitation from the Indians, who now learned for the first time that a\r\npower had grown up in this country which could not only punish, but\r\ncould do so with unprecedented vigor. The red men were so troublesome\r\nthat Congress saw it would not do to defer giving them a much-needed\r\nlesson. The guilty Indians were the Iroquois in central New York. In\r\n1779, General Sullivan led an expedition against them. He showed no\r\nmercy to those that had denied mercy to the helpless. Hundreds were\r\nkilled, their houses burned, their fields laid waste, and the whole\r\ncountry made such a desert that many perished from starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL CURRENCY.\r\n\r\nOne of the \"sinews of war\" is money. It is impossible for any nation to\r\ncarry on a war long without funds. The Americans were poor, but they\r\nissued paper promises to pay, which were known as Continental money. As\r\nthe war progressed, and more money was needed, it was issued. In 1778,\r\nit took eight paper dollars to equal one of gold or silver. More was\r\nnecessary and more was issued. Besides this, the paper and printing were\r\nof such poor quality that the British in New York made a great many\r\ncounterfeits that were exchanged with the farmers in the vicinity. The\r\nvalue of the currency decreased until the time came when it was\r\nabsolutely worthless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Continental Currency)]\r\n\r\nWhen Clinton occupied New York and Washington was encamped on the Hudson\r\nabove, there were many forays against each other. The design of the\r\nBritish commander was to force his way to the Highlands, seize the\r\npasses and gain full command of the Hudson. He had already secured Stony\r\nPoint, and Washington formed a plan for retaking it, which was intrusted\r\nto the brilliant Anthony Wayne.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July, Wayne took command of four regiments of\r\ninfantry, which marched twelve miles through the insufferably hot\r\nnight, when they reached a point about a mile from the fort. Wayne went\r\nforward while his men were resting and made a careful reconnaissance.\r\nRejoining his troops, he divided them into two columns, and, to prevent\r\nany mistake as to their identity, a piece of white paper was pinned to\r\neach hat. All the superfluous clothing was flung aside. He impressed\r\nupon his men that the bayonet alone was to be used, and, to prevent the\r\ndischarge of a gun by some nervous soldier, he ordered his officers to\r\ncut down the first man who took his musket from his shoulder without the\r\norder to do so.\r\n\r\nThe two divisions approaching from opposite sides were to attack the\r\nfort at the same moment. Before it was reached, the pickets discovered\r\nthem and opened fire. The garrison was aroused, and, hurrying to their\r\nposts, cried out tauntingly:\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you rebels! we're waiting for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be there,\" was the reply; and the patriots kept their word,\r\ncarrying matters with such a rush that the flag was speedily lowered.\r\nWhile leading his men, Wayne was struck in the forehead by a musket-ball\r\nand fell to the ground. Believing himself mortally wounded, he asked to\r\nbe carried forward that he might die within the fort. While his men were\r\nassisting him, it was found that he had only been stunned. He recovered\r\na moment later and was among the first to enter the defenses.\r\n\r\nThe American loss was slight, and they secured nearly six hundred\r\nprisoners, with a lot of valuable stores. The fort was destroyed before\r\nthey left, the ruins being occupied some days later by a British force.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFANT AMERICAN NAVY.\r\n\r\nThus far we have had nothing to tell about the infant American navy. At\r\nthe beginning of the war, in 1775, Washington sent several privateers to\r\ncruise along the New England coast, and Congress established a naval\r\ndepartment. Thirteen ships were fitted out and two battalions of seamen\r\nenlisted. The opportunity of capturing prizes from the enemy was very\r\nalluring to the skillful American seamen, and so many dashing privateers\r\nstarted forth in quest of them that in the course of three years fully\r\nfive hundred ships, sailing under the English flag, were captured. Some\r\nof the daring cruisers did not hesitate to enter British waters in\r\nsearch of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT NAVAL VICTORY OF PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nNo braver man than John Paul Jones ever trod the quarter-deck. On the\r\nfirst chance he displayed so much courage and skill that he was made a\r\ncaptain. He was cruising off Solway Firth near his birthplace one night,\r\nwhen he rowed ashore on the coast of Cumberland, with only thirty-one\r\nvolunteers, and burned three vessels in the harbor of Whitehaven and\r\nspiked a number of cannon in the guard-room of the fort. England was\r\nalarmed, declared him a pirate, and put forth every effort to capture\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, Paul Jones, as he is more generally known, put to sea in\r\ncommand of the _Bon Homme Richard_, and accompanied by two consorts, the\r\n_Alliance_ and the _Pallas_. The _Richard_ was an old East Indiaman,\r\ngiven him by the king of France and named in compliment to Franklin, who\r\nhad published \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" for so many years that he was\r\noften identified with the publication.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones was off Scarborough, he sighted the Baltic fleet of\r\nmerchantmen homeward bound, and escorted by the frigates _Countess of\r\nScarborough_ and the _Serapis_. The latter carried fifty guns and the\r\nformer twenty-two, while Jones had forty-four guns and three hundred and\r\nseventy-five men, two-thirds of whom were prisoners of war, since he had\r\ngreatly weakened his crew in order to send home the many prizes\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL JONES]\r\n\r\nThe moment Jones identified the enemy, he signaled to his consorts to\r\njoin him in pursuit. Night had closed in and the moon was shining, when\r\nthe captain of the _Serapis_ hailed Jones, who answered by opening fire.\r\nThe enemy was equally prompt, and thus one of the most famous fights in\r\nnaval history began. It is almost past comprehension how Jones fought so\r\nterrifically when the disadvantages under which he labored are known.\r\nFiring had scarcely begun when one of the guns on the lower deck\r\nexploded, killing several men. The survivors ran above, and the piece\r\nwas not used again during the fight.\r\n\r\nJones tried to close with the _Serapis_, but, finding he could not bring\r\nhis guns to bear, he allowed his ship to fall off. The prisoners, who\r\noutnumbered his crew, were kept busy extinguishing the fires that\r\ncontinually broke out, by being told that it was the only way to save\r\nthemselves from death by burning. In the midst of the terrific fighting,\r\nwhen the _Richard_ seemed doomed, Captain Pearson of the _Serapis_\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Have you struck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Struck!\" replied Jones; \"I am just beginning to fight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGHT BETWEEN BON HOMME RICHARD AND SERAPIS.]\r\n\r\nWhile the ships were lurching, one of the enemy's anchors caught the\r\nquarter of the _Richard_ and the two held fast, thenceforward fighting\r\nside by side. They were so close indeed that the _Serapis_ could not\r\nopen her starboard ports, and the cannon were fired through the\r\nport-lids, which were blown off; but the main deck of the _Richard_ was\r\nso high that the broadsides of the enemy injured no one, though they did\r\ngreat damage to the vessel. This tremendous battle lasted for two hours,\r\nthe muzzles of the guns scraping one another, and the cannon being\r\ndischarged as fast as they could be loaded. The _Richard_ was soon\r\nshattered to that extent that she began sinking. Fire broke out\r\nrepeatedly on both vessels, and finally Jones was able to work only\r\nthree of his guns. At this crisis, he found that his consort, the\r\n_Alliance_, Captain Landais, was firing into him as well as the\r\n_Serapis_; but not heeding him, he continued his battle with the\r\n_Serapis_, whose sailors fought as bravely as his own.\r\n\r\nThe fearful struggle was decided by a sailor in the rigging of the\r\n_Richard_, who was engaged in throwing hand-grenades on the deck of the\r\n_Serapis_. One of these dropped into the hatchway and exploded a mass of\r\neighteen-pound cartridges, which killed twenty and wounded twice as many\r\nmore. Captain Pearson placed himself at the head of his boarders and\r\nmade a rush for the deck of the _Richard_. Jones, leading his own men,\r\ndrove them back. The explosion of the grenades silenced the main battery\r\nof the _Serapis_, and Captain Pearson himself hauled down his colors,\r\nboth crews in the awful confusion believing for some minutes that it was\r\nthe _Richard_ that had surrendered.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned, the riddled _Richard_ was settling fast, and Jones had\r\nbarely time to remove his crew to the _Serapis_ when his own vessel went\r\ndown. Four-fifths of his men had been killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH CAPTAIN SURRENDERING HIS SWORD TO PAUL JONES.]\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the conduct of Captain Landais in firing into the\r\n_Richard_ led to the conclusion that he was insane, and he was deprived\r\nof his command. Jones did no more special service for the Americans. For\r\nhis unsurpassable achievement he received the thanks of Congress, and\r\nthe king of France presented him with a gold sword. After the war he\r\nbecame a rear-admiral in the Russian navy, and died in Paris in 1792.\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest and most shocking events of the Revolution was the\r\ntreason of Benedict Arnold, who had won a brilliant reputation for his\r\nbravery and generalship. He was quick-tempered, treacherous, and\r\nextravagant, and disliked by most of his men, despite his extraordinary\r\ndaring. His first resentment against Congress was the failure of that\r\nbody to make him one of the first five major-generals, in the face, too,\r\nof Washington's urgent recommendation for such promotion, which was made\r\nafter Arnold's splendid services at Saratoga.\r\n\r\nHe was placed in command at Philadelphia, while recovering from the\r\nwounds received at Saratoga. He married a Tory lady, and his misconduct\r\ncaused his trial by court-martial, which sentenced him to be reprimanded\r\nby the commander-in-chief. Washington performed the unpleasant duty with\r\ndelicacy, but its memory rankled and was increased by his anger against\r\nCongress for its refusal to allow his claims for expenses in the\r\nCanadian expedition. Influenced also, no doubt, by the Tory sentiments\r\nof his wife, he determined to take the step which has covered his name\r\nwith everlasting infamy.\r\n\r\nOn the plea that his wounds were not yet healed, he induced Washington\r\nto place him in command at West Point, the most important post in the\r\ncountry and the principal depot of supplies. He opened a correspondence\r\nwith Sir Henry Clinton at New York, and agreed for a stated sum of money\r\nand an appointment in the British army to surrender the post to a force\r\nwhich Clinton was to send against it. When a point in the negotiations\r\nwas reached where it was necessary to send a trusted agent to meet\r\nArnold, Clinton dispatched Major John Andre, who went up the Hudson in a\r\nsloop, and, September 22, 1780, met Arnold at the foot of Long Clove\r\nMountain. Everything being agreed upon, Andre started to return to the\r\nsloop, but found that, owing to its having been fired upon by a party of\r\nAmericans, it had dropped down stream. Obliged to make his way to New\r\nYork by land, he assumed the dress of a civilian, and, furnished with a\r\npass by Arnold, he set out on horseback.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPTURE OF MAJOR ANDRE\r\n\r\nMuch sympathy was felt in America for Andre, but the justice of his\r\nbeing hung as a spy was never questioned. His three captors, Paulding,\r\nVan Wart and Williams, were honored with medals and $200.00 a year each\r\nfor life, and monuments were erected to their memories by our\r\nGovernment.]\r\n\r\nWhen near Tarrytown, he was stopped by three Americans, Isaac Van Wart,\r\nJohn Paulding, and David Williams, who demanded his identity and\r\nbusiness. One of the three happened to be wearing a British coat, which\r\nhe had exchanged for one of his own while a prisoner of war, and the\r\nfact led Andre to think they were friends. Before he discovered his\r\nmistake, he had made known that he was a British officer, and he was\r\nordered to dismount and submit to a search. The fatal papers were found\r\non him, and, seeing his business was known, he offered everything he\r\nhad, besides the promise of a large sum of money from Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nto be allowed to go. His captors refused and conducted him to North\r\nCastle, where he was given up to Lieutenant-Colonel Jameson. That\r\nofficer had the proof before him in the papers that Arnold was the\r\nunspeakable traitor, but with a stupidity difficult to understand, he\r\nsent a letter to Arnold acquainting him with the capture of Andre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESCAPE OF BENEDICT ARNOLD.]\r\n\r\nArnold was eating breakfast at his house near the Hudson, when the note\r\nwas brought to him by the messenger. Knowing what it meant, he called\r\nhis wife to him, told her of his danger, kissed his sleeping boy in the\r\ncradle, ran out of the house, mounted his horse and galloped at headlong\r\nspeed for the river. There he sprang into a boat and ordered the men to\r\nrow with all haste to the sloop, still at anchor a short distance down\r\nstream and waiting for Andre. Since these men had no suspicion of the\r\ntruth they obeyed orders, and Arnold, by waving a white handkerchief\r\nover his head, prevented the Americans on the shore from firing at him.\r\nHe reached the sloop in safety and was carried to New York.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Andre was wearing a civilian suit at the time of his\r\ncapture made him a spy, according to the laws of war, and the\r\ncourt-martial before which he was called sentenced him to be hanged.\r\nClinton was greatly distressed by the impending fate of his favorite\r\nofficer and did his utmost to secure his release by Washington. It was\r\nintimated to Clinton that Washington might be induced to exchange Andre\r\nfor Arnold, but such an act by the British commander would have covered\r\nhis name with infamy, and he was too honorable even to consider it.\r\n\r\nAndre accepted his fate bravely, only asking that he might be shot\r\ninstead of hanged, but even that boon was denied him. General Greene,\r\nwho presided at the court-martial, insisted that such leniency would\r\nhave been an admission of a doubt of the justice of his sentence. Andre\r\nwas hanged October 2, 1780. King George III. caused a mural tablet to be\r\nerected to his memory, and his remains were removed to England in 1821\r\nand placed in Westminster Abbey. A pension was conferred upon his mother\r\nand his brother was created a baronet. Sad as was the fate of Andre, and\r\ngeneral as was the sympathy felt for him in this country, there can be\r\nno question of the justice of his sentence. He was a spy, and, had he\r\nsucceeded in his mission, might have caused the failure of the war for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nArnold received more than $30,000 as a reward for his treason. He was\r\ndisliked by the British officers, and Cornwallis did not hesitate to\r\nshow his contempt for him. He engaged in several raids against his\r\ncountrymen, but since he always fought \"with a rope around his neck,\" he\r\nwas never trusted with any important command.\r\n\r\nHe removed to England with his family after the war, and his sons\r\nreceived commissions in the British army. It is worth noting that all\r\ndid creditable service, and their descendants became worthy members of\r\nthe community, a fact which no one can regret, since they could be held\r\nin no way responsible for the horrifying crime of their ancestor, who,\r\ndespised by all around him, died in London in 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION IN THE SOUTH (CONCLUDED).\r\n\r\nCapture of Savannah--British Conquest of Georgia--Fall of\r\nCharleston--Bitter Warfare in South Carolina--Battle of Camden--Of\r\nKing's Mountain--Of the Cowpens--Battle of Guilford Court-House--Movements\r\nof Cornwallis--The Final Campaign--Peace and Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nThe wave of war continued to roll southward. The British had met with\r\nsuch meagre success in the Northern and Middle States that they turned\r\ntheir efforts toward the conquest of the South. In the latter part of\r\nDecember, 1778, an expedition from New York compelled the small garrison\r\nat Savannah to surrender. British troops from Florida then reinforced\r\nthe expedition, Augusta and other towns were captured, and the whole\r\nState was brought under British control. General Benjamin Lincoln, the\r\nAmerican commander, had too few troops to offer successful resistance,\r\nand the Tories gave much trouble.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1779, Lincoln crossed into Georgia and, with the aid of\r\nthe French fleet under D'Estaing, made an attempt to recapture Savannah.\r\nThe attack was made with the greatest bravery by the allies, but they\r\nsuffered a disastrous repulse, and D'Estaing again sailed for the West\r\nIndies. Georgia was brought so completely under British control that a\r\nroyal governor and officers were installed. The Whigs were treated with\r\ngreat cruelty, and for two years the struggle in the Carolinas assumed a\r\nferocious character. It was civil war in its most frightful form.\r\nNeighbor was arrayed against neighbor. Every man was compelled to be a\r\nWhig or Tory, and when one party captured another, it generally executed\r\nthe prisoners as traitors. There were many instances in which those of\r\nthe same family fought one another with the utmost fury, and the horrors\r\nof war were displayed in all their dreadful colors.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the British kept a strong force at Newport, but they\r\nwere withdrawn, and a strong expedition was sent South to capture\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH CAPTURE OF CHARLESTON.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lincoln had a garrison of 3,000, his forts, and a number of\r\nvessels, with which he was confident of making a successful defense of\r\nthe city. The ships, however, were so inferior to those of the enemy\r\nthat Commodore Whipple sank all except one at the mouth of Cooper River\r\nto block the channel, and added his men and guns to the defenses of\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nClinton's force was about double that of Lincoln, and he made his\r\napproaches with care and skill. By April 10th he was within a half-mile\r\nof the city, and, Lincoln having refused the demand for surrender, the\r\nenemy opened fire. Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton, the best cavalry leader\r\nthe British had in the country, scattered the patriot cavalry at the\r\nrear of the city, which was fully invested. Reinforcements arrived from\r\nNew York, and the siege was pushed vigorously. The garrison made a\r\nsortie which accomplished nothing. Tarleton continually defeated the\r\nAmerican cavalry at the rear, many guns were dismounted, food and\r\nsupplies were exhausted until all hope was gone, and on the 12th of May,\r\n1780, Lincoln surrendered his army and the city.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the severest blows of the war. Clinton secured the city\r\nand more than 400 pieces of artillery. He treated his prisoners kindly,\r\nbut lost no time in following up his success. Tarleton destroyed the\r\ncommand of Colonel Abraham Buford, numbering 400 men, and thus\r\neffectually quenched all organized resistance for a time in South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nClinton would have completed the conquest of the South by advancing into\r\nNorth Carolina, had he not learned that a French fleet was expected on\r\nthe coast. This led him to return to New York with the main army, while\r\nCornwallis was left behind with 4,000 men to complete the unfinished\r\nwork as best he could.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1780, Washington sent reinforcements to the South, with\r\na regiment of artillery under Baron De Kalb, a German veteran who had\r\ncome to America with Lafayette. Although one of the finest of officers,\r\nhe could scarcely speak a word of English, and General Gates, on June\r\n13, 1780, was ordered by Congress to assume command of the southern\r\ndepartment. He proved unequal to the difficult task, for not only were\r\nthe troops few and miserably disciplined and armed, but they were in a\r\nstarving condition. The summer was one of the hottest ever known, and,\r\nalthough reinforcements were expected, Gates decided not to wait before\r\nputting his forces in motion. Reinforcements reaching him after a time,\r\nhe marched against Cornwallis, who was eager to meet him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DEFEAT AT CAMDEN.\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought at Camden, and was conducted with such skill by\r\nCornwallis that the raw and untried patriots were utterly routed. The\r\ncentre and left wings were swept from the field, but the right under De\r\nKalb fought with splendid heroism, and it required the whole army of\r\nCornwallis to drive it from the field. In the fight De Kalb received\r\neleven wounds, and died the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Camden marked the complete destruction of Gates' army. The\r\nmilitia scattered to their homes, convinced that it was useless to fight\r\nlonger, while Gates with a few adherents continued his flight for nearly\r\ntwo hundred miles. Two days later, Colonel Sumter with eight hundred men\r\nwas attacked on the Wateree by Tarleton, who killed half his force and\r\nrecaptured his prisoners and booty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOT PARTISANS.\r\n\r\nConfident that the complete conquest of the South was close at hand,\r\nCornwallis gave every energy to the work. This was rendered difficult by\r\nthe activity of Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter, Andrew Pickens, and other\r\npartisan leaders, who were acquainted with every mile of the country,\r\nand on their horses made swift marches, struck effective blows, and were\r\noff again before pursuit could be made. The wonderful work of Marion in\r\nthis respect caused him to be known as the \"Swamp Fox of the Carolinas.\"\r\nMany of Tarleton's troopers fell before the fire of these daring\r\nrangers, who occasionally were strong enough to capture important posts.\r\nIt is worthy of mention in this place that to Sumter was the distinction\r\nof attaining the greatest age of any officer of the Revolution. At his\r\ndeath, in 1832, he was in his ninety-ninth year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTERESTING ANECDOTE.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the spirit of the Southern colonists, we may be\r\npardoned for the digression of the following anecdote. The fighting of\r\nMarion and his men was much like that of the wild Apaches of the\r\nsouthwest. When hotly pursued by the enemy his command would break up\r\ninto small parties, and these as they were hard pressed would subdivide,\r\nuntil nearly every patriot was fleeing alone. There could be no\r\nsuccessful pursuit, therefore, since the subdivision of the pursuing\r\nparty weakened it too much.\r\n\r\n\"We will give fifty pounds to get within reach of the scamp that\r\ngalloped by here, just ahead of us,\" exclaimed a lieutenant of\r\nTarleton's cavalry, as he and three other troopers drew up before a\r\nfarmer, who was hoeing in the field by the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe farmer looked up, leaned on his hoe, took off his old hat, and,\r\nmopping his forehead with his handkerchief, looked at the angry soldier\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Fifty pounds is a big lot of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is in these times, but we'll give it to you in gold, if you'll\r\nshow us where we can get a chance at the rebel; did you see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was all alone, was he? And he was mounted on a black horse with a\r\nwhite star in his forehead, and he was going like a streak of lightning,\r\nwasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the fellow!\" exclaimed the questioners, hoping they were about\r\nto get the knowledge they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"It looked to me like Jack Davis, though he went by so fast that I\r\ncouldn't get a square look at his face, but he was one of Marion's men,\r\nand if I ain't greatly mistaken it was Jack Davis himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TARLETON'S LIEUTENANT AND THE FARMER (JACK DAVIS).]\r\n\r\nThen looking up at the four British horsemen, the farmer added, with a\r\nquizzical expression:\r\n\r\n\"I reckon that ere Jack Davis has hit you chaps pretty hard, ain't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about _that_,\" replied the lieutenant; \"what we want to know\r\nis where we can get a chance at him for just about five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer put his cotton handkerchief into his hat, which he now slowly\r\nreplaced, and shook his head: \"I don't think he's hiding round here,\" he\r\nsaid; \"when he shot by Jack was going so fast that it didn't look as if\r\nhe could stop under four or five miles. Strangers, I'd like powerful\r\nwell to earn that fifty pounds, but I don't think you'll get a chance to\r\nsquander it on me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further questioning, the lieutenant and his men wheeled their\r\nhorses and trotted back toward the main body of Tarleton's cavalry. The\r\nfarmer plied his hoe for several minutes, gradually working his way\r\ntoward the stretch of woods some fifty yards from the roadside, where he\r\nstepped in among the trees and disappeared. You understand, of course,\r\nthat the farmer that leaned on his hoe by the roadside and talked to\r\nTarleton's lieutenant about Jack Davis and his exploits was Jack Davis\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOne day a British officer visited Marion under a flag of truce. When the\r\nbusiness was finished Marion urged him to stay to dinner, and the\r\nofficer accepted the invitation. The meal consisted of only baked sweet\r\npotatoes. Noting the surprise of his guest, Marion explained that the\r\nfare was the regular food of himself and soldiers, but, in honor of the\r\nguest, the allowance had been increased that day. This anecdote, which\r\nseems to be authentic, was supplemented by the officer's return to\r\nCharleston, where he resigned his commission, declaring that it was\r\nuseless to try to conquer such men. Marion led a spotless life, held in\r\nhigh esteem by friend and enemy, and his name will always be revered\r\nthroughout this country, especially in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOT VICTORY AT KING'S MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nThe next battle took place at King's Mountain, October 8, 1780.\r\nCornwallis had sent Colonel Ferguson with about 1,100 men to rouse the\r\nTories in North Carolina. He met with slight success, and fortified\r\nhimself on King's Mountain, between the Broad and Catawba Rivers, and on\r\nthe border between North and South Carolina. Aware of his danger, he\r\nsent messengers to Cornwallis urging him to forward reinforcements\r\nwithout delay. The Americans captured every one of the messengers, and\r\nof course no reinforcements arrived.\r\n\r\nThe patriots consisted mainly of North Carolina and Kentucky riflemen,\r\nnumbering 1,500, all excellent marksmen. They attacked in three separate\r\ncolumns, each of which was repulsed by Ferguson's men, who fought with\r\ncoolness and bravery. Then the Americans united and attacked again.\r\nFerguson was mortally wounded, and his successor was so hard pressed\r\nthat he surrendered. Four hundred of his men fled, three hundred were\r\nkilled, and eight hundred laid down their arms, while the loss of the\r\nAmericans was no more than twenty.\r\n\r\nKing's Mountain was a brilliant victory for the Americans and caused\r\nCornwallis to retreat into North Carolina. His men suffered greatly, and\r\nthe commander himself falling ill, the command was turned over to Lord\r\nRawdon, then a young man and famous afterward in India as the Marquis of\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL GREENE'S SUCCESS IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Gates led Congress to send the Quaker General Greene to\r\nthe South. Next to Washington, he was the most skillful leader of the\r\nRevolution, and, despite his discouragements and difficulties, he\r\nspeedily demonstrated the wisdom of the step that placed him where he\r\nwas so much needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF TARLETON.\r\n\r\nGreene sent Daniel Morgan, the famous commander of the Virginia\r\nriflemen, into South Carolina with a thousand men to gather recruits.\r\nCornwallis dispatched Tarleton with the same number after him. The\r\nforces met at the Cowpens, near Spartanburg, in January, 1781. This time\r\nthe terrible Tarleton found that he had met his master. Morgan utterly\r\nrouted him, as was proven by the fact that Tarleton lost a hundred men\r\nkilled, besides ten commissioned officers. A large number were wounded,\r\nand six hundred prisoners, his two guns, his colors, eight hundred\r\nmuskets, a hundred horses, and most of his baggage train were captured.\r\nOf the Americans only twelve were killed and about fifty wounded.\r\nTarleton himself had a narrow escape, but got away with a handful of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE'S SKILLFUL RETREAT.\r\n\r\nDetermined to punish the audacious Morgan, Cornwallis started after him\r\nwith his entire army. Greene and Morgan, having united, fell back, for\r\ntheir troops were too few to risk a battle. Their retreat across North\r\nCarolina into Virginia has never been surpassed in this country. Three\r\ntimes the British army were at the heels of the Americans, who avoided\r\nthem through the fortunate rise of the rivers, immediately after they\r\nhad crossed. Cornwallis maintained the pursuit until the Dan was\r\nreached, when he gave up and returned to Hillboro.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF GUILFORD COURT-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a number of recruits, Greene turned back into North\r\nCarolina, and the two armies encountered at Guilford Court-House (now\r\nGreensboro), in March, 1781. Some of the American militia gave way, but\r\nthe rest bravely held their ground, and, when compelled at last to\r\nretreat, did so in good order. Cornwallis had been handled so roughly\r\nthat he did not venture to pursue the Americans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DARING DESERTION OF JOHN CAMPE\r\n\r\nFrom the American to the English ranks, for the purpose of associating\r\nhimself with the traitor Benedict Arnold, seizing him and getting him\r\nalive into the hands of the Americans.]\r\n\r\nCornwallis now withdrew to Wilmington, while Greene moved across\r\nNorth Carolina after the British forces under Lord Rawdon. Several\r\nengagements took place, the principal one being at Hobkirk's Hill, near\r\nCamden. Greene inflicted severe losses upon the enemy, but was compelled\r\nto retreat, and spent the summer among the hills of the Santee, in the\r\nneighborhood of Camden. Advancing toward the coast, he fought the last\r\nbattle in the State, at Eutaw Springs, near Charleston, September 8,\r\n1781. The advantage was with the British, but the victory was one of\r\nthose that are as disastrous as defeat. Their loss was so heavy that\r\nthey retreated during the night and took shelter in Charleston. Greene\r\nhad completed his work with admirable effectiveness. Without winning\r\nvictories he had, by his caution, skill, celerity of movement, and\r\ngeneralship, almost cleared the South of the enemy, for the only points\r\nheld by them were Charleston and Savannah, where they were closely\r\nhemmed in for the rest of the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (CORNWALLIS)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF CORNWALLIS.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cornwallis was at Wilmington, where he learned of Greene's\r\nmovements too late to intercept him. He was confident, however, that\r\nRawdon was strong enough to overthrow Greene, and he moved northward\r\ninto Virginia to join the forces already there, and complete the\r\nconquest of the State. No serious opposition was encountered by him, and\r\nTarleton plundered the country as he passed through it. Entering\r\nVirginia, Cornwallis found himself opposed by Lafayette, with 4,000\r\ntroops, which was hardly one-half the force under his own command.\r\nOrders came from Clinton in New York for Cornwallis to seize upon some\r\nsuitable place near the coast, easily reached by the British vessels.\r\nCornwallis selected Yorktown, on the peninsula between the James and\r\nYork Rivers, where he fixed the headquarters of the army, and began\r\nthrowing up fortifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FRENCH ALLIES.\r\n\r\nThe time had come when the friendship of France for America was to\r\naccomplish something. In the summer of 1780 Rochambeau landed at Newport\r\nwith 6,000 troops, and later they were marched to Washington's camp,\r\nnear Peekskill and Morristown. Confident that he now had an army that\r\ncould achieve important results, Washington made preparations to attack\r\nClinton in New York. Rochambeau gave him every help, the allies working\r\ntogether with the utmost cordiality and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YORKTOWN CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nClinton was in a constant state of apprehension, for he had good cause\r\nto fear the result of the attack that impended. Washington's plan,\r\nhowever, was changed, in the summer of 1781, by the news that a French\r\nfleet and a strong force would soon arrive in Chesapeake Bay and shut\r\noff Cornwallis from all assistance from Clinton. Washington decided to\r\nmarch southward and capture Yorktown and Cornwallis, meanwhile keeping\r\nClinton under the belief that he meant to attack him. So well was the\r\nsecret kept that Clinton's suspicions were not aroused until several\r\ndays after the departure of the allied armies.\r\n\r\nDe Grasse, the commander of the French fleet, arrived in Chesapeake Bay\r\nAugust 30th. Thus Cornwallis was blocked off from the sea, and enough\r\nsoldiers were landed to prevent the British commander's escape by land.\r\nOn the same day Washington and Rochambeau, after making a feint toward\r\nStaten Island, began a rapid march through New Jersey to Philadelphia,\r\nand thence to Elkton, Maryland. Officers and men were in high spirits,\r\nfor they knew they were on the eve of great events. The citizens of\r\nPhiladelphia shared the feeling, and cheered the men as they marched\r\nthrough the streets. On the way southward Washington made a hurried\r\nvisit to Mount Vernon, which he had not seen since the opening of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAware of the grave danger threatening Cornwallis, a British fleet made\r\nan effort to relieve him, but the more powerful French fleet easily beat\r\nit off. The allied armies boarded the waiting ships at Elkton, and,\r\nsailing down the Chesapeake to James River, joined Lafayette's force in\r\nfront of Yorktown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURRENDER AT YORKTOWN]\r\n\r\nThe historical siege of Yorktown opened September 30, 1781. The French\r\nand American armies were ranged in a half-circle in front of Yorktown.\r\nCornwallis was indignant at the apparent desertion by Clinton, and wrote\r\nto him in the middle of September: \"This place is in no state of\r\ndefense. If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must expect to hear the\r\nworst.\" Word came from Clinton that a fleet of twenty-three ships and\r\nmore than 5,000 troops would sail to his relief about the 5th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe French soldiers in their gay uniforms and the Continentals in their\r\nrags maintained an ardent but friendly rivalry in pressing the siege.\r\nWashington aimed and applied the match to the first gun that was fired\r\ninto Yorktown. Governor Nelson, being asked to direct the bombardment,\r\nselected the house which he believed to be the headquarters of\r\nCornwallis, and calmly saw it battered to ruins. It was his own home.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the defenders hourly grew worse. The lack of forage\r\ncompelled them to kill most of their horses, whose bodies drifted down\r\nthe river. As is generally the case at such times, sickness broke out\r\namong the British troops, and 2,000 of the 7,000 were in the hospital.\r\nThe allies steadily worked their way forward by means of parallels, and\r\nfinally the guns along the entire front of Cornwallis were dismounted\r\nand his shells expended.\r\n\r\nHis situation had become so desperate that no one could have condemned\r\nhim for surrendering, but, before doing so, he resolved to make a\r\ndetermined effort to extricate himself from the trap in which he was\r\ncaught. His plan was to abandon his sick, baggage, and all incumbrances,\r\ncross the river in the darkness to Gloucester, attack and scatter the\r\nFrench force stationed there, and then hasten northward through\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey to New York.\r\n\r\nThis attempt would have been made, but, after a part of the army had\r\ncrossed, a violent storm scattered the boats and compelled their return.\r\nThe result quenched the last spark of hope in the breast of Cornwallis.\r\nHe opened negotiations with Washington, and the terms of surrender were\r\nsigned October 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURRENDER.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock the next afternoon, the British troops marched slowly out\r\nof Yorktown, drums beating, muskets shouldered, and colors cased. The\r\nAmerican line was drawn up on the right of the road and the French on\r\nthe left, its extent being fully a mile. Washington allowed no idle\r\nspectators present, and repressed every sign of exultation on the part\r\nof the captors.\r\n\r\nGeneral O'Hara, riding at the head of the troops, saluted when he came\r\nopposite Washington, and apologized for the absence of Cornwallis, who\r\nwas suffering from illness. When O'Hara's sword was offered to\r\nWashington, he replied that General Lincoln had been designated to\r\nreceive it. There was poetical justice in this, since it was Lincoln who\r\nhad been obliged to surrender Charleston to Clinton the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners numbered 7,247 English and Hessian soldiers and 840\r\nsailors. Seventy-five brass and thirty-one iron guns were also secured,\r\nincluding the accoutrements of the army. Clinton with the promised\r\nrelief arrived off the Chesapeake on the 24th, and learned to his\r\nconsternation that every British soldier in Virginia was a prisoner of\r\nwar. With indescribable sadness he sailed back to New York, feeling, as\r\ndid everyone else, that English rule in America was ended and American\r\nindependence won.\r\n\r\nWashington dispatched a courier with the glorious news to Philadelphia.\r\nRiding at headlong speed and changing his horse frequently, he reached\r\nthe national capital on the evening of the 23d. In those days the city\r\nwas provided with watchmen, who made the tour of the streets crying the\r\nhour. That night the cry rang out--\r\n\r\n\"PAST TWO O'CLOCK AND CORNWALLIS IS TAKEN.\"\r\n\r\nWindows flew up, lights twinkled from every house, men rushed out\r\nhalf-clothed, cheering, flinging their hats in air and embracing one\r\nanother in their joy. All the bells were set ringing, and the whole city\r\ngave itself over to rejoicing. It was stirred to its profoundest depths\r\nby the thrilling tidings, for even the dullest knew it meant the\r\nindependence for which the patriots had struggled throughout more than\r\nsix suffering years.\r\n\r\nCongress assembled at an early hour and marched to the Dutch Lutheran\r\nChurch, where all united in giving thanks to God for His great mercy and\r\nblessing. The aged doorkeeper of Congress was so overcome with joy that\r\nhe dropped dead. Washington directed that divine service be held at the\r\nheads of the regiments, in gratitude for the \"particular interposition\r\nof Providence in their behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEWS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the dismay caused in England when the\r\nnews crossed the ocean. Lord North strode up and down his room, flinging\r\nhis arms above his head and moaning, \"My God! it is all over!\" While\r\nothers were equally stricken by the tidings, America had many friends in\r\nthat country who had opposed from the beginning the attempt to subjugate\r\nthe colonies. Even those who voted for the war measures were now loud in\r\ninsisting that no more blood and treasure should be wasted in continuing\r\nhostilities. They demanded the removal of the ministers who advised the\r\ncontrary, and the House of Commons declared by vote that anyone who\r\nfavored the continuance of the war was a public enemy.\r\n\r\nWhile the surrender at Yorktown virtually ended the struggle, Washington\r\nwas too wise to disband the army. No more battles took place, but the\r\ncountry remained in an unsettled condition for a long time, and the\r\nembers of hate often broke into flame. It is claimed that the last blood\r\nshed in the Revolution was that of Captain Wilmot, shot in a skirmish in\r\nSeptember, 1782, at Stone Ferry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY OF PEACE AND ITS TERMS.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed by both parties that hostilities should stop, and\r\ncommissioners were appointed to arrange the terms of peace. The\r\npreliminary articles were signed at Versailles, November 30, 1782, but\r\nthe final treaty was not executed until September 3d of the following\r\nyear. On April 19, 1783, the eighth anniversary of Lexington, Washington\r\nat the headquarters of the army officially declared the war at an end.\r\n\r\nBy the final treaty, England acknowledged the United States to be free\r\nand independent, with Canada as a boundary on the north, the Mississippi\r\nRiver on the west, and Florida, extending westward to the Mississippi,\r\non the south. Spain, which still owned Louisiana west of the\r\nMississippi, now received Florida from Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe American army was disbanded, and officers and men went to their\r\nhomes dissatisfied because they had not been paid for years. Washington\r\npresented himself before Congress at Annapolis and resigned his\r\ncommission. The British evacuated Savannah in July, 1782, Charleston in\r\nDecember, and New York City, their last post, November 25, 1783. The\r\nforts north of the Ohio, however, were held by English garrisons for\r\nabout twelve years longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES CAPITOL, WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe Method of Government During the Revolution--Impending Anarchy--The\r\nState Boundaries--State Cessions of Land--Shays' Rebellion--Adoption of\r\nthe Constitution--Its Leading Features--The Ordinance of 1787--Formation\r\nof Parties--Election of the First President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar is not only a blight to mankind, but it inflicts wounds that can\r\nnever heal and brings a train of woe and suffering which lasts for\r\nyears. The social system is disorganized, industry checked, resources\r\nexhausted, and a debt entailed whose burden is felt for generations. The\r\nUnited States had won the priceless boon of independence, but the States\r\nwere exhausted and in the lowest depths of poverty. They were like those\r\nwho, having lost everything, are compelled to begin life anew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLANTATION GATEWAY.\r\n\r\n(Entrance to the Estate of William Byrd, at Westover, Va.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nWhile the war was under way, the States were held together by the one\r\ncommon danger, and the Continental Congress managed the affairs of the\r\nUnion, but the body was without any authority to govern, and whatever it\r\ndid in that direction was only what the people permitted. The State\r\ngovernments were tangible, for State constitutions had been formed and\r\nthe Legislatures received direct authority from the people. When they\r\nchose to disobey Congress they did so, and no penalty could be visited\r\nupon them. As the end of the war approached, the authority of the\r\nrespective States increased and that of Congress dwindled until it was\r\nbut a mere name and shadow.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation were agreed upon by Congress in 1777. They\r\ndefined the respective powers of Congress and were not to go into effect\r\nuntil a majority of the States should agree to them. Within the\r\nfollowing two years all yielded their assent except Maryland, which did\r\nso March 1, 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPUTE OVER STATE BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this prolonged delay was the dispute over western\r\nterritory. Few persons suspect the extent of the wrangling over the\r\nrespective boundaries of the States. When the charters were granted by\r\nEngland, the western boundaries of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland were defined, and\r\nconsequently they could not ask for an extension of them. New York\r\ninsisted that she had no western boundary. The remaining six States had\r\ntheir western boundaries named as the Pacific Ocean, which was at a\r\ndistance that no one dreamed of at the time. They asserted that the\r\ntransfer of Louisiana to Spain fixed the Mississippi River as the limit\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nAmong these claims none was so remarkable as that of Virginia. The most\r\nthat her sister States asked was that their northern and southern\r\nboundaries should run parallel to the westward, but Virginia insisted\r\nthat her northern boundary extended northwest, which, if allowed, would\r\nhave given her all of the present States of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Her claim was crossed by those of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe States whose western boundaries had been settled were indignant over\r\nthe injustice of the claims of the others, for, since the whole thirteen\r\nassisted in wresting the territory from Great Britain, they asserted\r\nthat all should share it. Some of the States sold lands in the west,\r\nwhose ownership was disputed by other States, and Maryland, as\r\nintimated, refused her assent to the Articles of Confederation until\r\nassured that these western claims would be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE DISPUTE WAS SETTLED.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the only way out of the confusion was by the\r\nsurrender of these claims, and New York set the example in 1780. In\r\nresponse to the earnest request of Congress, Virginia did the same in\r\n1784, Massachusetts in 1785, Connecticut in 1786, South Carolina in\r\n1787, North Carolina in 1790, and Georgia in 1802. The result was that\r\nthe western boundaries of the States named were fixed as they are\r\nto-day, and the United States came into the possession of a large\r\nterritory. Connecticut held fast to a large strip of land in\r\nnortheastern Ohio, which is still known as the Western Reserve. The same\r\nState, which had settled Wyoming in Pennsylvania, claimed it for a time,\r\nbut finally gave it up.\r\n\r\nIt took but a short time to demonstrate the utter worthlessness of the\r\nArticles of Confederation. Congress, the central governing power, had no\r\nauthority to lay taxes, punish crimes, or regulate foreign or domestic\r\ncommerce. Its whole function was to give advice to the respective\r\nStates, which, as might be supposed, paid little or no heed to it.\r\nFurthermore, the stronger States made laws inimical to the smaller ones,\r\nand Congress was powerless to remedy it. Naturally Great Britain\r\noppressed American commerce, and there was no way of checking it.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity which most of the people expected to follow peace did not\r\nappear. The Continental currency was not worth the paper it was printed\r\non. Even at this late day, when a man uses the expression that an\r\narticle is \"not worth a Continental,\" it is understood to mean that it\r\nhas no value at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON'S PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\nThe condition of no one was more pitiful than that of the heroes who had\r\nfought through the Revolution and won our independence. They went to\r\ntheir poverty-smitten homes in rags. While Washington was at his\r\nheadquarters at Newburgh, in 1783, an anonymous paper was distributed\r\namong the troops calling upon them to overthrow the civil governments\r\nand obtain their rights by force. They even dared to ask Washington to\r\nbecome their king, but that great man spurned the offer in a manner that\r\nprevented it ever being repeated. But his sympathy was aroused, and he\r\nfinally secured five years' full pay for the officers, and thus averted\r\nthe danger.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Northern and Middle States contained about a million\r\nand a half of people and the Southern a million. Virginia had 400,000\r\ninhabitants, and was the most populous, with Pennsylvania and\r\nMassachusetts next, each having 350,000. The present Empire State of New\r\nYork was one of the weak States, the city containing about 14,000,\r\nBoston 20,000, and Philadelphia 40,000. It was estimated that the debt\r\nof the respective States was $20,000,000 and of the country $42,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAYS' INSURRECTION.\r\n\r\nRioting and disorder are always sure to follow so deplorable a condition\r\nof affairs. Daniel Shays, formerly a captain in the Continental army,\r\nheaded a mob of 2,000 men in Massachusetts, who demanded the stoppage of\r\nthe collection of taxes and the issuance of a large amount of paper\r\nmoney for general use. When they had dispersed the Supreme Court,\r\nsitting at Springfield, General Lincoln was sent with 4,000 troops to\r\nput down the rebellion. Lincoln placed the judges in their seats, and\r\nthen, when the rioters were about to attack him, he gave them a volley.\r\nThe rioters scattered and the rebellion ended. Fourteen of the\r\nringleaders were afterward sentenced to death, but were reprieved and\r\nfinally pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING AT ANNAPOLIS.\r\n\r\nShays' rebellion was one of the best things that could have happened,\r\nfor it showed the country more clearly than before that it was on the\r\nverge of anarchy, and that the remedy must not be delayed. Long before\r\nthis, Washington comprehended the serious peril of the country, and he\r\nwas in continual consultation with men whose worth and counsel he\r\nvalued. The result was that a meeting of commissioners from Maryland,\r\nDelaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York met at Annapolis in\r\nSeptember, 1786. They held an earnest discussion, but as only a minority\r\nof the States were represented, nothing positive could be done, and an\r\nadjournment was had with a recommendation that each State should send\r\ndelegates to meet in Philadelphia in May, 1787. The prestige of\r\nWashington's name gave so much weight to the recommendation that at the\r\nappointed date all the States were represented except Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Washington was again manifest in a letter which he wrote\r\nsome months before the meeting of the Constitutional Convention, and\r\nwhich contained the following:\r\n\r\n\"We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of\r\nhuman nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us that\r\nwithout the intervention of a coercive power, men will not adopt and\r\ncarry into execution measures best calculated for their own good. I do\r\nnot conceive we can exist long as a nation without having lodged\r\nsomewhere a power that will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a\r\nmanner as the authority of the State governments extend over the several\r\nStates.... I am told that even respectable characters speak of a\r\nmonarchical form of government without horror. From thinking proceeds\r\nspeaking; thence acting is but a single step. But how irrevocable and\r\ntremendous! What a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions!\r\nWhat a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are\r\nincapable of governing ourselves, and that systems founded on the basis\r\nof equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Washington of the disorders in New England, he was\r\ngreatly troubled. \"What stronger evidence can be given,\" he asked, \"of\r\nthe want of energy in our government than these disorders? If there is\r\nnot a power in it to check them, what security has a man for his life,\r\nliberty, or property? The consequences of a bad or inefficient\r\ngovernment are too obvious to be dwelt upon. Thirteen sovereigns pulling\r\nagainst one another, and all tugging at the federal head, will soon\r\nbring ruin on the whole; whereas, a liberal and energetic constitution,\r\nwell checked and well watched to prevent encroachments, might restore\r\nus to that degree of respectability and consequence to which we had the\r\nfairest prospect of attaining.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787.\r\n\r\nWashington was placed at the head of the delegation from Virginia.\r\nAlthough he hoped that he would be permitted to spend the rest of his\r\ndays in the domestic quiet of Mount Vernon, his patriotism would not\r\npermit him to decline, even though he saw the certainty that the action\r\nwould bring him forward once more into public affairs. Only a part of\r\nthe delegates met in Philadelphia, May 14, 1787, and an adjournment was\r\nhad from day to day until the 25th, when, a majority being present, the\r\nconvention organized and unanimously chose Washington as chairman. For\r\nfour months it sat with closed doors, meeting in the same room in\r\nIndependence Hall where the Declaration of Independence was signed, and\r\nwhere the chair is still preserved in which Washington sat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATE CHAMBER.]\r\n\r\nWhat an assemblage of great and noble men, all of whose names have\r\nbecome historical! With the peerless Washington at the head, there were\r\nJames Madison, afterward President of the United States; Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin West, Edmund Randolph, Robert\r\nMorris, Gouverneur Morris, Sherman, Clymer, Read, and Dickinson. It may\r\nwell be imagined that among those men the discussions, which were\r\ncontinued several hours daily, were of the most interesting nature.\r\nInevitably there was a diversity of views, and the arguments at times\r\ngrew warm, but with such an aggregation of statesmanship and wisdom, the\r\nbest results were certain. Steadily the wonderful Constitution was\r\nmoulded into shape, and on the 17th of September was signed by all the\r\ndelegates except Randolph and Mason, of Virginia, and Gerry, of\r\nMassachusetts. It was then submitted to Congress, which forwarded it to\r\nthe respective States for acceptance or rejection--the assent of nine\r\nbeing necessary to make it operative.\r\n\r\nSo important a document was sure to elicit earnest discussion and many\r\nable men opposed its adoption. At that early day appeared the germs of\r\nthe present political parties. The problem was as to the right division\r\nof power between the national or central government and the respective\r\nStates. Those who favored the widest latitude to the States were called\r\nRepublicans, while their opponents were given the name of Federalists.\r\nThe views of the latter predominated in the main, though the\r\nConstitution was really a compromise between its supporters and\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nThe beneficent features of the instrument were so manifest that its\r\nadoption soon followed. On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire ratified it,\r\nand, being the ninth State, its provisions became operative throughout\r\nthe Union. North Carolina and Rhode Island did not assent, and the\r\nConstitution went into effect without their vote. These two States had\r\nissued a good deal of paper money, and disliked the Constitution because\r\nit forbade such action. The opposition of the other States was caused by\r\nthe fear that too much power was conferred upon the central government.\r\nTo remove this not wholly unreasonable objection, the first ten\r\namendments were adopted and ratified in 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution supplied the great requirement without which the\r\ngovernment itself would have been a nullity: the power to act supplanted\r\nthe power simply to advise. The government consists of three\r\ndepartments: a legislative or Congress, which makes the laws; an\r\nexecutive department, consisting of the President and his officers, to\r\nexecute the laws made by Congress; and a judiciary department (the\r\nFederal courts), which decides disputed questions under the laws. The\r\nConstitution is our supreme law and must be obeyed by the general\r\ngovernment, the State governments, and the people; if not, the general\r\ngovernment punishes the offender.\r\n\r\nCongress, or the legislative department, consists of two branches, the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives. Each State, no matter what its\r\npopulation, is entitled to two Senators, who serve for six years and are\r\nelected by the respective State Legislatures; the Representatives are\r\napportioned according to the population, are voted for directly by the\r\npeople, and serve for two years. In this admirable manner, each State is\r\nprotected by its Senators against any encroachment upon its rights,\r\nwhile the populous States receive the recognition to which they are\r\nentitled through the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nCongress, the two branches acting together, lay taxes, borrow money,\r\nregulate commerce, coin money, establish post offices, declare war,\r\nraise and support armies and navies, and employ militia to suppress\r\ninsurrections. All States are forbidden to do any of these things,\r\nexcept to impose their own taxes, borrow for themselves, and employ\r\ntheir own militia. A majority of each house is enough to pass any bill,\r\nunless the President within ten days thereafter vetoes the act (that is,\r\nobjects to it), when a two-thirds vote of each branch is necessary to\r\nmake it a law. Treaties made by the President do not go into effect\r\nuntil approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.]\r\n\r\nThe executive department is vested in the President, chosen every four\r\nyears by electors, who are voted for by the people. The President is\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy and appoints the majority of\r\nofficers, it being necessary that most of the appointments shall be\r\nconfirmed by the Senate. In case of misconduct, the President is to be\r\nimpeached (charged with misconduct) by the House of Representatives and\r\ntried by the Senate. If convicted and removed, or if he should die or\r\nresign or be unable to perform the duties of his office, the\r\nVice-President takes his place and becomes President. With this\r\nexception, the Vice-President presides over the Senate, with no power to\r\nvote except in case of a tie. No provision was made for a successor in\r\nthe event of the death of the Vice-President, but in 1886 the\r\nPresidential Succession Law was passed, which provides that, in case of\r\nthe death or disability of the President and Vice-President, the order\r\nof succession shall be the secretaries of State, of the treasury, of\r\nwar, the attorney-general, the postmaster-general, and the secretaries\r\nof the navy and of the interior.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary department, or power to decide upon the constitutionality\r\nof laws, was given to one supreme court and such inferior courts as\r\nCongress should establish. The judges are appointed by the President and\r\nSenate and hold office during life or good behavior. The State courts\r\nhave the power of appeal to the supreme court of the United States,\r\nwhose decision is final, the questions being necessarily based upon\r\noffenses against any law of Congress, or upon the doubtful meaning of a\r\nlaw, or the doubt of the constitutional power of Congress to pass a law.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Constitution, three-fifths of the\r\nslaves were to be counted in calculating the population for the\r\nRepresentatives. Fugitive slaves were to be arrested in the States to\r\nwhich they had fled. New Territories were to be governed by Congress,\r\nwhich body admits the new States as they are formed. Each State is\r\nguaranteed a republican form of government, and the vote of\r\nthree-fourths of the States can change the Constitution through the\r\nmeans of amendments. The provisions regarding slavery, as a matter of\r\ncourse, lost their effect upon the abolishment of the institution at the\r\nclose of the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINANCE OF 1787.\r\n\r\nCongress remained in session in New York, while the Philadelphia\r\nconvention was at work upon the Constitution, and during that period\r\norganized a territorial government for the immense region northwest of\r\nthe Ohio, which belonged to the United States. The enterprising nature\r\nof the American people asserted itself, and hundreds of emigrants began\r\nmaking their way into that fertile section, where the best of land could\r\nbe had for the asking. But the Indians were fierce and warred\r\ncontinually against the settlers. Most of these had been soldiers in the\r\nRevolution, and they generally united for mutual protection. The Ohio\r\nCompany was formed in 1787, and, in order to assist it, Congress passed\r\nthe Ordinance of 1787, of which mention has been made.\r\n\r\nSlavery was forever forbidden in the Territory northwest of the Ohio,\r\nand the inhabitants were guaranteed full religious freedom, trial by\r\njury, and equal political and civil privileges. The governors of the\r\nTerritory were to be appointed by Congress until the population was\r\nsufficient to permit the organization of five separate States, which\r\nStates should be the equal in every respect of the original thirteen.\r\nFrom the Territory named the powerful and prosperous States of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin were afterward formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nThe Indian titles to 17,000,000 acres of land in the Territory had been\r\nextinguished by treaties with the leading tribes, despite which the red\r\nmen contested the advancing settlers with untiring ferocity. Flatboats\r\nwere attacked on their way down the Ohio, and the families massacred;\r\nblockhouses were assailed, and the smoke of the settlers' burning cabins\r\nlit the skies at night. The pioneer path to the fertile region was\r\ncrimsoned by the blood of those who hewed their way through the western\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nUntil formed into States, the region was known as _The Northwestern\r\nTerritory_. In 1788, Rufus Putnam, of Massachusetts, at the head of\r\nforty pioneers, founded the settlement of Marietta, and within the same\r\nyear 20,000 people erected their homes in the region that had been\r\nvisited by Daniel Boone and others nearly twenty years before.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the ninth State ratified the Constitution than the\r\nCongress of the Confederation named March 4, 1789, as the day on which,\r\nin the city of New York, the new government should go into effect.\r\n\r\nThe time had come for the selection of the first President of the United\r\nStates, and it need not be said that the name of only one\r\nman--WASHINGTON--was in people's thoughts. So overmastering was the\r\npersonality of that great man that he was the only one mentioned, and\r\nwhat is most significant of all, not a politician or leader in the\r\ncountry had the effrontery to hint that he had placed himself \"in the\r\nhands of his friends\" in the race for the presidency. Had he done so, he\r\nwould have been buffeted into eternal obscurity.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the ingratitude of republics, it can never be\r\ncharged that the United States was ungrateful to Washington. The people\r\nappreciated his worth from the first, and there was no honor they would\r\nnot have gladly paid him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nThe date of the 4th of March was fixed without special reason for\r\nlaunching the new government, and it has been the rule ever since,\r\nthough it often falls upon the most stormy and unpleasant day of the\r\nwhole year. Some of the States were so slow in sending their\r\nrepresentatives to New York, that more than a month passed before a\r\nquorum of both houses appeared. When the electoral vote for the\r\nPresident was counted, it was found that every one of the sixty-nine had\r\nbeen cast for Washington. The law was that the person receiving the next\r\nhighest number became Vice-President. This vote was: John Adams, of\r\nMassachusetts, 34; John Jay, of New York, 9; R.H. Harrison, of Maryland,\r\n6; John Rutledge, of South Carolina, 6; John Hancock, of Massachusetts,\r\n4; George Clinton, of New York, 3; Samuel Huntington, of Connecticut, 2;\r\nJohn Milton, of Georgia, 2; James Armstrong, of Georgia, Benjamin\r\nLincoln, of Massachusetts, and Edward Telfair, of Georgia, 1 vote each.\r\nVacancies (votes not cast).\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, of Massachusetts, therefore, became the first\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD INDIAN FARM-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF WASHINGTON, JOHN ADAMS, AND JEFFERSON--1789-1809.\r\n\r\nWashington--His Inauguration as First President of the United\r\nStates--Alexander Hamilton--His Success at the Head of the Treasury\r\nDepartment--The Obduracy of Rhode Island--Establishment of the United\r\nStates Bank--Passage of a Tariff Bill--Establishment of a Mint--The Plan\r\nof a Federal Judiciary--Admission of Vermont, Kentucky, and\r\nTennessee--Benjamin Franklin--Troubles with the Western Indians--Their\r\nDefeat by General Wayne--Removal of the National Capital Provided\r\nfor--The Whiskey Insurrection--The Course of \"Citizen Genet\"--Jay's\r\nTreaty--Re-election of Washington--Resignation of Jefferson and\r\nHamilton--Washington's Farewell Address--Establishment of the United\r\nStates Military Academy at West Point--The Presidential Election of\r\n1796--John Adams--Prosperity of the Country--Population of the Country\r\nin 1790--Invention of the Cotton Gin--Troubles with France--War on the\r\nOcean--Washington Appointed Commander-in-Chief--Peace Secured--The Alien\r\nand Sedition Laws--The Census of 1800--The Presidential Election of\r\n1800--The Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution--Thomas\r\nJefferson--Admission of Ohio--The Indiana Territory--The Purchase of\r\nLouisiana--Its Immense Area--Abolishment of the Slave Trade--War with\r\nTripoli--The Lewis and Clark Expedition--Alexander Hamilton Killed in a\r\nDuel by Aaron Burr--The First Steamboat on the Hudson--The First Steamer\r\nto Cross the Atlantic--England's Oppressive Course Toward the United\r\nStates--Outrage by the British Ship _Leander_--The Affair of the\r\n_Leopard_ and _Chesapeake_--Passage of the Embargo Act--The Presidential\r\nElection of 1808.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY BALL, AFTERWARD THE MOTHER OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe name of Washington will always stand peerless and unapproachable on\r\nthe pages of human history. In great crises, Heaven raises up men for\r\nits appointed work. As soldier, statesman, and patriot, he combined in\r\nhis own personality the full requirements of the prodigious task than\r\nwhich no greater was ever laid upon the shoulders of man. Through\r\ntrials, sufferings, discouragements, disappointments, abuse, ill\r\ntreatment, opposition, and misunderstandings, he never lost heart; his\r\nlofty patriotism was never quenched; his sublime faith in God and the\r\ndestiny of his country never wavered, and, seeing with the eye of\r\nundimmed faith the end from the beginning, he advanced with serene\r\nmajesty and unconquerable resolve to the conclusion and perfection of\r\nhis mighty work.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Washington that he embodied within himself the\r\ngenius of sanity and the sanity of genius. We can conceive of Lincoln,\r\nGrant, or any other great man losing his mind, but like the snowy crest\r\nof a mountain, rising far above the plain, he stood by himself, and it\r\nis impossible to think of him as losing even in the slightest degree the\r\nmagnificent attributes of his personality. As has been stated, his was\r\nthe single example in our history in which the fate of our country\r\nrested with one man. Had he fallen in battle at any time between\r\nLexington and Yorktown, the Revolution would have stopped and\r\nindependence been postponed indefinitely. But when Heaven selects its\r\nagent, it shields him in impenetrable armor, and, though Washington was\r\nexposed to innumerable personal perils in the wilderness and in battle,\r\nwhen his comrades were smitten with death around him, he never received\r\nthe slightest wound, and lived to see his work finished, when, in the\r\nquiet of his own home at Mount Vernon, he lay down, folded his arms, and\r\npassed to his reward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON (1732-1799.) Two terms, 1789-1797.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, February\r\n22, 1732. There is a general misunderstanding as to his family. He had\r\nthree half-brothers, one half-sister, and three brothers and two\r\nsisters. His half-brothers and sister, children of Augustine Washington\r\nand Jane Butler, were: Butler (died in infancy), Lawrence, Augustine,\r\nand Jane. His brothers and sisters, children of Augustine Washington and\r\nMary Ball, were: Betty, Samuel, John Augustine, Charles, and Mildred\r\n(died in infancy).\r\n\r\nWashington's father died when the son was eleven years old, and his\r\ntraining devolved upon his mother, a woman of rare force of character.\r\nHe received a common school education, but never became learned in\r\nbooks. He early showed a liking for military matters, was fond of the\r\nsports of boyhood, and was manly, truthful, and so eminently fair in\r\neverything, that his playmates generally selected him as umpire and\r\ncheerfully accepted his decisions. He became an expert surveyor, and, at\r\nthe age of sixteen, was employed by Lord Fairfax to survey his immense\r\nestate. The work, which continued for three years and was of the most\r\ndifficult nature, attended by much hardship and danger, was performed to\r\nthe full satisfaction of his employer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INAUGURATION OF WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nWashington grew to be a magnificent specimen of physical manhood. He was\r\nsix feet two inches tall, with a large frame and a strength surpassing\r\nthat of two ordinary men. No one in the neighborhood was his equal in\r\nhorsemanship, running, leaping, throwing, swimming, and all manner of\r\nathletic sports. He was of the highest social rank, wealthy, and a\r\nvestryman and member of the Episcopal Church. He was rather fond of pomp\r\nand ceremony, somewhat reserved in manner, and at times seemed cold and\r\ndistant, but with a character that was without flaw or stain. It has\r\nalready been said that he served throughout the Revolution without\r\naccepting a penny for his services. He kept an account of all he\r\nreceived from the government, but sometimes forgot to note what he paid\r\nout. In such cases he balanced his books by paying the deficit from his\r\nown pocket, so that it may be truthfully said he not only won\r\nindependence for his country, but paid for the privilege of doing so.\r\n\r\nWashington from his first services in the French and Indian War was so\r\nidentified with the history of his country that the account of one\r\nincludes that of the other. Having told of his election to the\r\npresidency, it, therefore, remains to give the principal incidents of\r\nhis administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON'S INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\nA special messenger reached Mount Vernon with news of Washington's\r\nelection on the 14th of April, and two days later he set out for New\r\nYork. The journey was one continual ovation, special honors being shown\r\nhim at Baltimore, Philadelphia, Trenton, and New York, where they\r\nattained their culmination. He arrived on the 23d of April, and the\r\ninauguration took place a week later. Amid impressive ceremonies, the\r\noath was administered by Robert R. Livingston, the chancellor of the\r\nState of New York, in Federal Hall, on the present site of the\r\nsub-treasury building. Washington stood in a balcony of the senate\r\nchamber, in full view of the great multitude on the outside. He showed\r\nconsiderable embarrassment, but was cheered to the echo and was greatly\r\ntouched by the manifestations of the love of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of his administration, Washington became ill and no\r\nimportant business was done until September. On the 10th of that month,\r\nCongress created a department of foreign affairs, a treasury department,\r\nand a department of war. Thomas Jefferson was nominated to the first,\r\nAlexander Hamilton to the second, and General Henry Knox to the third.\r\nAll were admirable appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nHamilton, the secretary of the treasury, was one of the most remarkable\r\nmen identified with the history of our country. He was born in the West\r\nIndies in 1757, and, while a child, displayed extraordinary ability.\r\nWhen fifteen years old, he was sent to New York City and entered King's\r\n(now Columbia) College. A patriotic speech made when he was only\r\nseventeen years old held his hearers spellbound by its eloquence. At\r\ntwenty, he organized a company of cavalry and performed excellent\r\nservice on Long Island and at White Plains. Washington was so impressed\r\nby his brilliancy that he placed him on his staff and made him his\r\nmilitary secretary. Many of the best papers of the commander-in-chief\r\nreceived their finishing touches from the master hand of Hamilton. He\r\nwas in Congress in 1782-1783, and helped to frame the Constitution.\r\nWhen the New York Convention assembled to ratify the new Constitution,\r\nthree-fourths of its members were strongly opposed to it, but Hamilton\r\nby the sheer force of his eloquent logic won them over and secured the\r\nassent of the State to the adoption of the Constitution. He was one of\r\nour most brilliant statesmen and the foremost Federalist of his time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON'S WISE MANAGEMENT OF THE FINANCES.\r\n\r\nThe greatest problem which confronted the country was that of finance,\r\nand Hamilton grasped it with the skill of a master. Hardly had he\r\nreceived his commission, when Congress called upon him for a plan to\r\nprovide for the public debt and to revive the dead national credit.\r\nHamilton's first answer was that the country would begin by being\r\nhonest, and that every dollar of the confederation, then amounting\r\nalmost to $80,000,000, should be paid, the United States assuming all\r\ndebts due to American citizens, as well as the war debt of each State.\r\nThis bold and creditable ground greatly improved public credit, before\r\nany provision was made for the payment of the vast debt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n(1757-1804).]\r\n\r\nHamilton's plan was to fund the entire debt and issue new certificates.\r\nIt was vehemently opposed, especially the provision that the State debts\r\nshould be assumed by the general government; but solely by his wonderful\r\nability he carried the measure through Congress. The debate sharpened\r\nthe lines between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists or Republicans.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that at that time neither North Carolina nor Rhode\r\nIsland had adopted the Constitution. The former called a convention,\r\nand, on the 13th of November, 1789, ratified it, but Rhode Island\r\ncontinued to sulk until Providence and Newport withdrew from the State,\r\nand Massachusetts and Connecticut made ready to parcel the State between\r\nthem. This frightened her, and, on May 29, 1790, she joined her\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nThe following year Hamilton gave another proof of his power by carrying\r\nthrough Congress, in the face of the strongest opposition, a measure for\r\nthe relief of the financial straits of the government. The only banks in\r\nthe country were one each in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, all of\r\nwhich were State institutions. He advocated the establishment of a bank\r\nin which the government should be one-fifth owner of the capital stock\r\nof $10,000,000 and a preferred borrower to the same amount. It was to be\r\nunder private management. In the face of the strong opposition, the act\r\ncreating it was passed, and it was chartered for twenty years. The\r\nsubscriptions required that one-fourth should be paid in specie and the\r\nrest in six per cent. certificates of the bank. Within two hours after\r\nthe subscription books were opened the entire amount of stock was\r\nsubscribed. The United States Bank was destined to play an important\r\npart in national affairs in after years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF A TARIFF BILL.\r\n\r\nHaving provided the means for funding the debt and for borrowing money,\r\nit yet remained to find some way of earning the money. The method was so\r\napparent that Congress lost no time in passing a tariff bill. A law\r\nplaced a duty on imported and domestic spirits, and, in February, 1792,\r\na protective tariff bill was enacted. This provided that the materials\r\nfrom which goods are manufactured should not be taxed, while articles\r\ncompeting with those made in this country were prohibited. A mint was\r\nalso established in Philadelphia for coining money.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL JUDICIARY ORGANIZED.\r\n\r\nThe plan for the Federal judiciary was perfected on the lines proposed\r\nby Ellsworth, of Connecticut. The national judiciary consisted of a\r\nsupreme court, having a chief justice and five associate justices, who\r\nwere to hold two sessions annually at the seat of the Federal\r\ngovernment. Specified jurisdiction was given to the circuit and district\r\ncourts, and each State was made a district; the Territories of Maine and\r\nKentucky were provided for in the same manner, and the remaining\r\nTerritories were grouped into three circuits. When the matter in dispute\r\namounted to $2,000, an appeal could be taken from the lower courts to\r\nthe supreme court. The President was to appoint a marshal in each\r\ndistrict, possessing the general powers of a sheriff, and the interests\r\nof the government were placed in the hands of a district attorney.\r\n\r\nThe first chief justice of the United States was John Jay, of New York,\r\nwhile Edmund Randolph, of Virginia, was made attorney-general. The\r\nassociate judges were John Rutledge, of South Carolina; James Wilson, of\r\nPennsylvania; William Cushing, of Massachusetts; Robert H. Harrison, of\r\nMaryland; and John Blair, of Virginia.\r\n\r\nVermont was admitted to the Union on March 4, 1791; Kentucky, June 1,\r\n1792; and Tennessee exactly two years later. These three States were all\r\nthat were formed during the presidency of Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEN FRANKLIN MOULDING CANDLES IN HIS FATHER'S SHOP.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin died in Philadelphia, April 17, 1790, at the age of\r\neighty-four years. Since he was one of the greatest of all Americans, he\r\nis entitled to fitting notice. He was born in Boston in 1706, and was\r\nthe youngest of seventeen children. His father was a tallow chandler and\r\nsoap boiler, a trade which Benjamin detested. He was apprenticed to his\r\nbrother, who was a printer, and while a boy gave evidence of his\r\nremarkable keenness and brilliant common sense. Rebelling against the\r\ndiscipline of his brother, he ran away, tramping most of the distance\r\nto Philadelphia. There he secured a situation and showed himself so\r\nskillful and tasteful a printer that he never lacked for work. He\r\nestablished a paper in Philadelphia in 1729, and began the publication\r\nof _Poor Richard's Almanac_ in 1732, the year in which Washington was\r\nborn. The wit, homely philosophy, and keen penetration shown by Franklin\r\nattracted wide attention and gave the almanac an enormous circulation,\r\nwhich lasted as long as it was published. Many of his proverbs are still\r\npopular and widely quoted.\r\n\r\nIn 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster of the British colonies,\r\nand, as a delegate to the Albany Convention in 1754, proposed an\r\nimportant plan for colonial union. From 1757 to 1762, and again from\r\n1764 to the Revolution, he was agent of Pennsylvania in England; part of\r\nthe time also for Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Georgia. Returning to\r\nPhiladelphia in 1775, he was at once chosen a delegate to the\r\nContinental Congress. Few persons, in looking at his handsome signature\r\non the Declaration of Independence, would suspect that it was written\r\nwhen he was seventy years old. It has been shown that he was one of the\r\ncommittee of five who drew up the Declaration, and in the following\r\nautumn was sent to Paris to join Arthur Lee and Silas Deane. His\r\nservices there were of the highest importance. He had a leading part in\r\nthe negotiations of the treaty of peace in 1783, after which he\r\nnegotiated a favorable treaty with Russia. He returned to America in\r\n1785, and was chosen president of Pennsylvania, and again in 1786 and\r\n1787. He was an influential member of the Constitutional convention, and\r\nprobably was second to Washington in popularity. His funeral in\r\nPhiladelphia was attended by more than 20,000 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN'S GRAVE.]\r\n\r\nFranklin's researches in electricity, though slight as compared with the\r\ndiscoveries since made by Edison, Tesla, and others, extended his fame\r\nto Europe. By means of the kite which he sent aloft in a thunderstorm,\r\nhe proved that the lightning in the atmosphere is identical with that\r\ndeveloped by frictional electricity. This discovery led to the invention\r\nof the lightning-rod for buildings, which has been the means of saving\r\nproperty beyond estimate. He was the inventor also of an economical\r\nstove and other useful contrivances. He made himself wealthy, and the\r\nfortune which he left at his death was the foundation of the splendid\r\ninstitution of learning known as the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF FALLEN TIMBERS\r\n\r\nIn this memorable battle of August 20, 1794, General Wayne visited a\r\nfinal defeat upon the Indians at Maumee Rapids, putting an end to the\r\nwar in the Northwest, which for nearly four years had terrorized and\r\ndevastated the territory now occupied by the States of Indiana, Ohio and\r\nIllinois.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISASTROUS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE WESTERN INDIANS.\r\n\r\nReturning to the history of Washington's presidency, mention must be\r\nmade of the troubles with the western Indians, who, as has been stated,\r\nfought relentlessly against the advance of civilization into their\r\nhunting grounds. Between 1783 and 1790, 1,500 persons were killed by the\r\nred men near the Ohio. It being clear that peace could not be secured\r\nexcept by a thorough chastisement of the Indians, Congress gave General\r\nArthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, authority to call\r\nfor 500 militia from Pennsylvania and a thousand from Kentucky, to which\r\nwere added 400 regulars. Under General Harmar they marched against the\r\nIndian villages.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign the Indians outgeneraled Harmar, who, after inflicting\r\nsome damage, was defeated and lost 200 men in killed and wounded. The\r\ndefeat encouraged the savages, who became more aggressive than ever.\r\nGeneral St. Clair organized a second expedition consisting of 2,000 men,\r\nincluding cavalry and artillery, with which in October, 1793, he entered\r\nthe Indian country, only to suffer a more disastrous defeat than General\r\nHarmar, and in which the losses were so dreadful that the news caused\r\nconsternation in Philadelphia. Washington had cautioned St. Clair\r\nagainst the very mistakes he made, and he completely lost his temper. He\r\npaced up and down his room, giving such expressions to his feelings that\r\nthose around him were awed into silence. By-and-by, he seemed to regret\r\nthe outburst, and, when the trembling St. Clair some time later\r\npresented himself, the President received him without reproach; but St.\r\nClair was overwhelmed by his disgrace and resigned his command.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYNE'S VICTORY OVER THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nWashington determined that no more blunders should be made, and\r\nappointed Anthony Wayne to the command of the next expedition. He raised\r\na large force, moved cautiously, and took every precaution against\r\nsurprise, as Washington had told him to do. He had 4,000 men under his\r\ncommand, and the consummate woodcraft and tricks of the red men failed\r\nto deceive him. At Fallen Timbers, near the present city of Toledo, he\r\nmet a large force, August 20, 1794, of Canadians and Indians, completely\r\nrouted them, killed a great many, with slight loss to himself, and so\r\ncrushed the confederation of tribes that they gave no more trouble for a\r\nlong time. A year later, 1,100 chiefs and warriors met the United States\r\ncommissioners at Fort Greenville and signed a treaty of peace, by which\r\nthey ceded to the government an immense tract of land lying in the\r\npresent States of Michigan and Indiana. An impetus was given to western\r\nemigration, which suffered no interruption for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHISKEY INSURRECTION IN PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nOne of the acts of Congress was to declare that Philadelphia was to be\r\nthe national capital for ten years, from 1790, when it was to be removed\r\nto a point on the Potomac River, where the city of Washington now\r\nstands. One measure which Hamilton induced Congress to pass caused\r\ntrouble. It doubled the duty on imported spirits and taxed those\r\ndistilled in this country. So much dissatisfaction appeared in North\r\nCarolina and Pennsylvania that the law was modified, but it did not end\r\nthe discontent. The officers sent to Pennsylvania to collect the taxes\r\nwere resisted and the militia sympathized with the rioters, whose\r\nnumbers swelled to 7,000 under arms. When they began to talk of\r\nappealing to England, Washington lost patience and sent a large body of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey militia to the section.\r\nThey were under the command of General Henry Lee, governor of Virginia,\r\nand arrived on the scene in October, 1794. Order was soon restored, and\r\nthe ringleaders, expressing sorrow for their acts, were not punished.\r\nThis seems to be the rule in our country, except that repentance on the\r\npart of criminals is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITIZEN GENET.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of \"Citizen Genet\" caused a flurry during Washington's\r\npresidency. The \"Reign of Terror\" had begun in France, where the most\r\nappalling revolution in history had taken place. The tyranny of the\r\nrulers had driven the people to frenzied desperation, and, overthrowing\r\nthe government, their massacres were not checked until literally\r\nhundreds of thousands of people were killed. Since their rebellion was\r\nbegun against tyranny, and France had helped us in our war for\r\nindependence, there was general sympathy for the people in our own\r\ncountry, though everyone was shocked by the deeds that soon horrified\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\nHaving established a government, the revolutionists sent Edward Charles\r\nGenet to this country as its representative. He was warmly welcomed at\r\nCharleston, where he landed in April, 1793. He was too discourteous to\r\ngo to Philadelphia to present his credentials, and began enlisting\r\nrecruits for France and intriguing for an alliance with us. Since France\r\nwas fighting England, Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, and Holland, it can be\r\nunderstood how desirable such an alliance would have been to her.\r\n\r\nWashington was too wise to be misled, and he issued a proclamation of\r\nneutrality, forbidding citizens of the United States to equip vessels to\r\ncarry on hostilities against the belligerent powers. Genet paid no\r\nattention to this, but kept on enlisting men and fitting out cruisers\r\nin American waters. His course became so intolerable that Washington\r\ndemanded his recall. This demand was complied with, and he was ordered\r\nto return home. No one knew better than he that if he showed himself in\r\nFrance he would lose his head. So he stayed in this country until his\r\ndeath in 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY'S TREATY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN JAY.]\r\n\r\nThe course of England became so unjust toward the commerce, because of\r\nher war with France, that Chief Justice John Jay, in May, 1794, was sent\r\nas envoy extraordinary to that country to demand redress. A treaty was\r\nagreed upon and ratified by the Senate in June, 1795, which provided\r\nthat the British garrisons should be withdrawn from the western posts by\r\nJune 1, 1796; free inland navigation upon lakes and rivers was\r\nguaranteed to both nations, except that the United States was excluded\r\nfrom the territory of the Hudson Bay Company; British vessels were\r\nadmitted to the rivers and harbors on our seacoast, but our shipping was\r\nshut out from the rivers and harbors of the British provinces, with the\r\nexception of small vessels trading between Montreal and Quebec; our\r\nnortheastern boundary was to be fixed by a commission; the payments of\r\ndebts incurred before the war were guaranteed to British creditors, if\r\nsuch debts were collectible by an American creditor; Great Britain was\r\nto pay for losses resulting from irregular captures by her cruisers;\r\ncitizens of either country were allowed to hold landed possessions in\r\nthe territory of the other; private property was not to be confiscated\r\nin time of war; trade between the United States and the West Indies was\r\nfree to the vessels of both nations, but American vessels were forbidden\r\nto carry West Indian products from the islands or from the States to any\r\nother part of the world. The last clause was to be in force only two\r\nyears, when further negotiation was to take place. In addition, the two\r\nyears' limit was applicable to the right of American vessels to trade\r\nbetween the East Indies and the United States, but in time of war they\r\nwere not to take thither any rice or military stores; free commerce was\r\nestablished between the British dominions in Europe and the United\r\nStates; the regulation of duties was provided for, as well as the\r\nappointment of consuls and the rules of blockade; privateering was\r\nregulated; what was contraband of war was defined, and it was agreed\r\nthat piracy should be punished; ships of war could enter the ports of\r\neither country; criminals escaping from one country to the other were to\r\nbe surrendered; and, in the event of war between the two countries,\r\ncitizens in hostile territory were not to be molested.\r\n\r\nAlthough this treaty possessed many good points, and was the best\r\nobtainable by our envoy, it gave so many advantages to Great Britain\r\nthat it roused bitter enmity in this country. Public meetings were held\r\nin the leading cities, where it was denounced as cowardly and made for\r\nthe express purpose of avoiding a war with England. The feeling rose so\r\nhigh that Jay was burned in effigy, Hamilton was assaulted at a public\r\nmeeting, the British minister insulted, and even Washington himself\r\ntreated with disrespect. Better judgment prevailed, when the passions\r\ncooled, and it is now admitted that Jay's treaty, when all the\r\ncircumstances are considered, was a commendable one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ELECTION OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nIt was Washington's wish to retire to private life on conclusion of his\r\nfirst term, but he could not disregard the demand from all quarters. No\r\ncompetitor appeared in the field against him, and for a second time he\r\nwas unanimously elected. His vote was 132; that cast for the candidates\r\nfor the minor office being, John Adams, Federalist, 77; George Clinton,\r\nof New York, Republican, 50; Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, Republican,\r\n4; Aaron Burr, of New York, Republican, 1; vacancies, 3. This vote made\r\nJohn Adams again Vice-President.\r\n\r\nSince Jefferson was the leader of the Republicans (or as now called the\r\nDemocrats), and Hamilton of the Federalists (afterward the Whigs), and\r\nthe two, as members of Washington's cabinet, were able and aggressive,\r\nthey were continually disputing. Sometimes they sorely tried\r\nWashington's patience, who, appreciating the ability of both, often had\r\nhard work to prevent an open rupture. On the last day in 1793, Jefferson\r\nresigned his office as secretary of foreign affairs and retired to\r\nprivate life at Monticello, Virginia. A year later Hamilton resigned as\r\nminister of finance. Through his efforts public credit had been\r\nrestored, and industry and trade had revived. He well deserved the\r\neloquent tribute of Daniel Webster: \"He smote the rock of the national\r\nresources, and abundant streams of revenues burst forth. He touched the\r\ndead corpse of public credit, and it sprung upon its feet.\"\r\n\r\nAs Washington's second term drew to a close, a universal demand was made\r\nthat he should serve again. Despite the fact that the two great\r\npolitical parties were fairly organized, and each contained many able\r\nmen, no one would have had the temerity to offer himself as a\r\ncompetitor; but he was growing old, his strength had been worn out in\r\nthe service of his country, and the rest he yearned for could no longer\r\nbe denied him. He, therefore, issued his immortal Farewell Address to\r\nhis countrymen and withdrew to Mount Vernon, where he peacefully passed\r\naway December 14, 1799, mourned by the whole country and revered by the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nThe Farewell Address contains counsel that can never lose its value to\r\nAmerica. After thanking his fellow-countrymen for the confidence they\r\nhad always shown in him, and the support he had received from them, he\r\nsaid that the love of liberty was so interwoven with every ligament of\r\ntheir hearts that no recommendation of his was necessary to fortify that\r\nattachment. The unity of government, by which they were made one people,\r\nhad also become very dear to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON'S BEDROOM, MT. VERNON, IN WHICH HE DIED.]\r\n\r\n\"It is justly so,\" he said, \"for it is a main pillar in the edifice of\r\nyour real independence--the support of your tranquillity at home, your\r\npeace abroad; of your safety, of your prosperity; of that very liberty\r\nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from\r\ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken,\r\nmany artifices be employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of\r\nthis truth--as this is the point in your political fortress against\r\nwhich the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most\r\nconstantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously)\r\ndirected--it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the\r\nimmense value of your national union to your collective and individual\r\nhappiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable\r\nattachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as the\r\npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its\r\npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest\r\neven a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly\r\nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion\r\nof our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now\r\nlink together the various parts. For this you have every inducement of\r\nsympathy and interest. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common\r\ncountry, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The\r\nname of AMERICAN, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must\r\nalso exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation\r\nderived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference,\r\nyou have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles.\r\nYou have in a common cause fought and triumphed together; the\r\nindependence and liberty you possess are the work of joint counsels and\r\njoints efforts; of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOTHER OF WASHINGTON RECEIVING MARQUIS LAFAYETTE.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his departure for Europe, in the fall of 1784, the Marquis\r\nde Lafayette repaired to Fredericksburg to pay his parting respects to\r\nWashington's mother and to ask her blessing.\r\n\r\nConducted by one of her grandsons he approached the house, when, the\r\nyoung gentleman observing, \"There, sir, is my grandmother,\" the Marquis\r\nbeheld, working in her garden, clad in domestic-made clothes and her\r\ngray head covered by a plain straw hat, the mother of \"his hero, his\r\nfriend, and a country's preserver.\" The lady saluted him kindly,\r\nobserving, \"Ah, Marquis, you see an old woman; but come, I can make you\r\nwelcome to my poor dwelling without the parade of changing my dress.\"]\r\n\r\nWashington next pointed out the mutual advantages derived from one\r\nanother in the different sections of the Union, and impressively warned\r\nhis countrymen against the danger of sectional parties and the baneful\r\neffects of party spirit. He commended the Constitution, which could be\r\namended, whenever the necessity arose, as beneficent in its provisions\r\nand obligatory upon all. Other wholesome counsel, which he added, made\r\nthe Farewell Address a priceless heritage to the generations that came\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the paper was excellent. The various State\r\nLegislatures voted thanks to Washington, and were warm in their praises\r\nof his wise and patriotic services as President. The regret was\r\nuniversal that the country was so soon to lose his valuable counsel and\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY ESTABLISHED.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution Washington recommended the excellent location of\r\nWest Point as the proper one for a military school of instruction. An\r\nact establishing the United States Military Academy at that place was\r\npassed March 16, 1802. It provided that fifty students or cadets should\r\nbe given instruction under the senior engineer or officer, assisted by\r\nthe corps of engineers of the army. As the institution grew,\r\nprofessorships of mathematics, engineering, philosophy, etc., were\r\nadded, and the academy was made a military body subject to the rules and\r\narticles of war. A superintendent was designated in 1815, and the\r\npresent system of appointing cadets was instituted in 1843. The rigid\r\ncourse, steadily elevated, probably prevents fully one-half of those\r\nentering from graduating, and, a comparison of the West Point Military\r\nAcademy with similar institutions establishes the fact that it is the\r\nfinest of the kind in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1796.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1796 was a close one, the result being:\r\nJohn Adams, Federalist, 71; Thomas Jefferson, Republican, 68; Thomas\r\nPinckney, of South Carolina, Federalist, 59; Aaron Burr, of New York,\r\nRepublican, 30; Samuel Adams, of Massachusetts, Republican, 15; Oliver\r\nEllsworth, of Connecticut, Independent, 11; George Clinton, of New York,\r\nRepublican, 7; John Jay, of New York, Federalist, 5; James Iredell, of\r\nNorth Carolina, Federalist, 3; George Washington, of Virginia, John\r\nHenry, of Maryland, and S. Johnson, of North Carolina, all Federalists,\r\n2 votes each; Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina,\r\nFederalist, 1 vote. Since it required 70 votes to elect, it will be seen\r\nthat John Adams was barely successful, with Jefferson close to him.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, the second President, was born at Braintree, Massachusetts,\r\nOctober 19, 1735. He graduated at Harvard, at the age of twenty, and was\r\nadmitted to the bar three years later. He was one of the most active and\r\ninfluential members of the First and Second Continental Congresses. It\r\nwas he who by his eloquent logic persuaded Congress to adopt the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. Jefferson, his strenuous political\r\nopponent, declared that Adams was the pillar of its support and its\r\nablest advocate and defender. It was Adams who suggested the appointment\r\nof General Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental army.\r\nDuring the progress of the war, he criticised the management of\r\nWashington, but, long before the death of the Father of his Country,\r\ncandidly acknowledged the injustice of such criticism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n(1735-1826.) One term, 1797-1801.]\r\n\r\nThe services of Adams were not confined to his early efforts in Congress\r\nnor to his term as President. He did important work as commissioner to\r\nFrance and Holland, and as minister plenipotentiary to negotiate a\r\ntreaty of peace with Great Britain. He obtained large loans and induced\r\nleading European powers to make excellent treaties with his country.\r\nAdams and Franklin framed the preliminary treaty of Versailles, and, as\r\nthe first American minister to England, he served until 1788. He\r\nreceived the thanks of Congress for the \"patriotism, perseverance,\r\nintegrity, and diligence\" displayed while representing his country\r\nabroad. When John Adams assumed the duties of the presidency, he found\r\nthe country comparatively prosperous and well governed.\r\n\r\nThe South was the most prosperous. Until 1793, its principal productions\r\nwere rice, indigo, tar, and tobacco. The soil and climate were highly\r\nfavorable to the growth of cotton, but its culture was unprofitable, for\r\nits seeds were so closely interwoven in its texture that only by hard\r\nwork could a slave clean five pounds a day. In the year named, Eli\r\nWhitney, a New England schoolteacher, living in Georgia, invented the\r\ncotton gin, with which a man can clean a thousand pounds of cotton a\r\nday. This rendered its cultivation highly profitable, gave an importance\r\nto the institution of slavery, and, in its far-reaching effects, was the\r\ngreatest invention ever made in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROUBLES WITH FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe matter which chiefly occupied public attention during the\r\nadministration of the elder Adams was our difficulties with France. That\r\ncountry had hardly emerged from the awful Reign of Terror in which a\r\nmillion of people were massacred, and it was under the control of a set\r\nof bloody minded miscreants, who warred against mankind and believed\r\nthey could compel the United States to pay a large sum of money for the\r\nprivilege of being let alone. They turned our representatives out of the\r\ncountry, enacted laws aimed to destroy our commerce, and instructed\r\ntheir naval officers to capture and sell American vessels and cargoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTTON GIN, INVENTED IN 1793.\r\n\r\nA machine which does the work of more than 1,000 men.]\r\n\r\nPresident Adams, who abhorred war, sent special ministers to protest\r\nagainst the course of France. The impudent reply was there would be no\r\nstoppage until the men who controlled the French government were paid\r\nlarge sums of money. This exasperating notice brought the answer from\r\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney which has become historical: \"Millions for\r\ndefense, but not one cent for tribute.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough war was not declared, it prevailed on the ocean during the\r\nlatter half of 1798. Congress convened, abolished the treaties with\r\nFrance, strengthened the navy, and ordered it to attack French vessels\r\nwherever found. Several engagements took place, in all of which the\r\nFrench men-of-war were whipped \"to a standstill.\" The most important of\r\nthe naval battles was between the _Constitution_, under Commodore\r\nTruxton, and the French frigate _L'Insurgente_, in which the latter was\r\ncaptured. A messenger was sent to Mount Vernon, carrying the appointment\r\nof Washington as commander-in-chief of the American army. He found the\r\ngreat man in the harvest field; but when Washington donned his\r\nspectacles and read the paper, he replied that he was then as always\r\nready to serve his country in whatever capacity he could. He accepted\r\nwith the understanding that he was not to be called into the field until\r\nactual hostilities took place on the land, and that Alexander Hamilton\r\nshould until then be the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nDoubtless a destructive war would have resulted, but for the fact that\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, as a stepping-stone to his marvelous career,\r\noverturned the French government and installed himself as emperor. He\r\nsaw the folly of a war with the United States, when he was certain soon\r\nto be embroiled with more powerful neighbors near home. He offered fair\r\nterms of peace to our country in 1799, and they were accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALIEN AND SEDITION LAWS.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest mistakes made by the Federalists in Congress was the\r\npassage of the Alien and Sedition Laws. Irritated by the mischief-making\r\nof foreigners, a law was enacted which permitted the President to arrest\r\nany alien in the country whose presence he considered dangerous. The\r\nacts under which this was to be done were known as the Alien Laws. The\r\nmost detested measure, however, was that which authorized the arrest of\r\nany person who should speak evil of the government, and was known as the\r\nSedition Law. There were arrests and punishments under its provisions,\r\nand the majority of the people were bitterly hostile to it. It was\r\nunquestionably a direct invasion of the liberty of speech. The claim\r\nthat no editor, public speaker, or private citizen should be allowed to\r\ncondemn an action of the government which he disproved was unbearable,\r\nbut it was in direct line with the Federal policy of a powerful central\r\ngovernment, and as directly opposed to Republican principles. The\r\nfeeling became so intense that at the next presidential election the\r\nFederal party was defeated and never afterward gained control of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1800 showed that the population of the country had\r\nincreased to 5,308,483. In that year, the national capital was removed\r\nfrom Philadelphia to the straggling, partly built village of Washington,\r\nstanding in the woods, and without any of the structures that have made\r\nit one of the most attractive cities in the world.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1800 was an exciting one. Thomas Jefferson\r\nand Aaron Burr, both Republicans, received 73 electoral votes, while\r\nJohn Adams, Federalist had 65; Charles C. Pinckney, Federalist, 64; John\r\nJay, Federalist 1. The vote between the leaders being a tie, the\r\nelection was thrown into the House of Representatives, where, after\r\nthirty-eight ballots, Jefferson was elected, with Burr, the next highest\r\ncandidate, Vice-President. The preceding election, as will be\r\nremembered, gave a President and Vice-President of different political\r\nparties, always an undesirable thing, and this fact, added to the\r\ndifficulties of the election just over, led to the adoption in 1804 of\r\nthe Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires the electors\r\nto vote separately for the President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, was born at\r\nShadwell, Albemarle County, Virginia, April 2, 1743. His father, a\r\nwealthy planter, died when his son was fourteen years old, and he\r\nentered William and Mary College, where he was the most assiduous\r\nstudent in the institution. Jefferson was as fond as Washington of\r\nathletic sports, and, though he was of less massive build, he attained\r\nthe same stature, six feet two inches. In college, he was an awkward,\r\nfreckle-faced, sandy haired youth, who, but for his superior mental\r\nattainments, would have commanded little respect. Except for his\r\nfondness for hunting and horseback riding, he never could have acquired\r\nthe physique which allowed him to spend ten, twelve, and sixteen hours\r\nof every twenty-four in hard study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n(1743-1826.) Two terms, 1801-1809.]\r\n\r\nJefferson was undoubtedly the most learned of all our Presidents. He was\r\nnot only a fine mathematician, but a master of Latin, Greek, French,\r\nSpanish, and Italian. He was an exquisite performer on the violin, and\r\nit was said of him, by one of the most noted European musicians, that he\r\nnever heard an amateur play the king of instruments as well as the slim\r\nVirginian.\r\n\r\nJefferson married a wealthy lady and named his attractive home\r\nMonticello. His great ability caused his election to the Virginia\r\nLegislature while a young man, and he was soon afterward sent to\r\nCongress. Lacking the gifts of oratory, he had no superior as a writer\r\nof fine, classical, forceful English. Among the many excellent laws he\r\nsecured for Virginia was the separation of Church and State. He was the\r\nauthor of a parliamentary manual for the government of the United States\r\nSenate, which is still an authority, and of our present system of\r\ndecimal currency; but the reader does not need to be reminded that his\r\nfame will go down to posterity chiefly as the writer of the Declaration\r\nof Independence; but Jefferson felt almost equally proud of the fact\r\nthat he was founder of the University of Virginia, which, abandoning the\r\nold system, introduced the \"free system of independent schools.\" He also\r\nproposed for his State a comprehensive system of free public schools.\r\n\r\nAlthough wealthy, he went almost to the extreme of simplicity. His dress\r\nwas as plain as that of the Quakers; he wore leathern shoestrings\r\ninstead of the fashionable silver buckles; and strove to keep his\r\nbirthday a secret, because some of his friends wished to celebrate it.\r\nHe was opposed to all pomp, ceremony, and titles. He is universally\r\nregarded as the founder of the Democracy of the present day, and was\r\nundeniably one of the greatest Presidents we have had.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELCOME LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Jefferson proved among the most important in the\r\nhistory of our country. Congress promptly abolished the tax on distilled\r\nspirits and a number of other manufactures, a step which enabled the\r\nPresident to dismiss a large number of revenue collectors, whose\r\nunwelcome duties had entailed considerable expense upon the country. The\r\nobnoxious Sedition Law was repealed, and the Alien Law so modified that\r\nit was shorn of its disagreeable features.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF OHIO.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800, a line was run through the Northwest Territory from\r\nthe mouth of the Great Miami to Fort Recovery and thence to Canada.\r\nThree years afterward, the territory thus defined was admitted to the\r\nUnion as the State of Ohio. The Indiana Territory included the portion\r\nwest of the line named, with Vincennes as the capital. The Mississippi\r\nTerritory was organized so as to extend from the western boundaries of\r\nGeorgia to the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe punishment administered to France in 1798 naturally gave that\r\ncountry a respect for the United States, and in 1802 our relations with\r\nher became quite friendly. Bonaparte, having established a truce with\r\nthe nations around him, found time to give some attention to the\r\nAmerican republic. He seemed to believe he could establish a French\r\ncolonial empire, not only in the West Indies, but in the immense\r\nprovince of Louisiana. Had Bonaparte succeeded, he would have acquired\r\ncontrol of the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. Nothing would have\r\npleased England more than to see so serious a check placed upon our\r\ngrowth, and nothing would have displeased our countrymen more than to be\r\nshut off from the Father of Waters and the right to emigrate westward.\r\nThey were ready to go to war before submitting to such deprivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nNo one was more keenly alive to the situation than Jefferson. He\r\ncarefully instructed our envoy at Paris to make the strongest possible\r\nrepresentations to the French ruler of the grave mistake of the course\r\nhe had in mind, which must inevitably result in an alliance with Great\r\nBritain in sweeping France from the seas and driving her from the West\r\nIndies. Bonaparte was too wise not to perceive that this was no empty\r\nthreat, and that his visionary French empire in the West would prove an\r\nelement of weakness rather than strength. Nothing was plainer than the\r\ntruth that the stronger the United States became, the more dangerous\r\nwould it be for his traditional enemy, England. He, therefore, proposed\r\nto sell Louisiana to the United States.\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing for which Jefferson had been skillfully working\r\nfrom the first. The bargain was speedily completed. On April 30, 1803,\r\nLouisiana came into our possession for the sum of $11,250,000, we\r\nagreeing at the same time to pay certain debts due from France to\r\nAmerican citizens, amounting to $3,750,000, so that the total cost of\r\nLouisiana was $15,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the Territory of Louisiana, as purchased\r\nby us, was vastly more extensive than is the present State of that name.\r\nIt included the area from which have been carved the States of\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas,\r\nMontana, part of Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado, and the Territory of\r\nOklahoma, the whole area being 1,171,931 square miles, as against\r\n827,844, which was all the territory occupied previous to 1803.\r\nPeaceable possession was taken on the 20th of December following. The\r\ngovernorship of the Territory was offered to Lafayette, and declined by\r\nhim, but he received a grant of 12,000 acres within its limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVE TRADE ABOLISHED.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Constitution, it was agreed that the\r\nslave trade should be permitted for twenty years. It was abolished,\r\ntherefore, in 1808, and the penalty for engaging in it was made\r\npunishable with death. At the time of the purchase of Louisiana, it was\r\nbelieved that it included Texas, but the United States gave up this\r\nclaim in 1819 to Spain in return for the cession of Florida.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible, but it was true, that for twenty years we had been\r\npaying a large tribute to Algiers on condition that she would not molest\r\nour commerce. Other nations did the same, because it was more convenient\r\nthan keeping a navy in those far-off waters. A treaty with Morocco had\r\nbeen signed, in 1787, under which we also paid her tribute. The people\r\nof the Barbary States naturally waxed insolent, and when we were slow in\r\nsending our tribute they imposed a heavy penalty, which we meekly paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH TRIPOLI.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disgusted men was Captain William Bainbridge, when\r\nobliged to carry the tribute in 1800 to the Dey of Algiers, who informed\r\nhim that the Americans were his slaves, and must do as he ordered. The\r\nindignant officer expressed the hope that the next tribute he delivered\r\nwould be from the mouths of his cannon. The following year the ruler of\r\nTripoli became ruffled because we did not send him as much tribute as he\r\nthought he was entitled to, and actually declared war against us.\r\n\r\nThe flurry of 1798 with France had caused a considerable increase in our\r\nnavy, which was furnished with plenty of daring officers, who afterward\r\nmade names for themselves. They eagerly welcomed a war of that nature\r\nwhich of necessity was a naval one. The operations were confined to the\r\nMediterranean, on whose shore are the Barbary States.\r\n\r\nThe first real fight took place in August, 1801, between the\r\n_Enterprise_, a vessel of twelve guns, and a Tripolitan vessel of\r\nfourteen guns. It occurred off Malta, and lasted for two hours, when the\r\nTripolitan hauled down his flag. Thereupon the Americans left their guns\r\nand were cheering, when the enemy treacherously fired a broadside into\r\nthe _Enterprise_. Nothing loth, Lieutenant Sterrett renewed the battle\r\nwith such vigor that in a few minutes the flag was lowered a second\r\ntime, only to renew the fighting when the enemy saw an advantage.\r\n\r\nThoroughly exasperated, Lieutenant Sterrett now determined to complete\r\nthe business. The vessel was raked fore and aft, the mizzen-mast torn\r\naway, the hull knocked to splinters, and fifty men killed and wounded.\r\nThen the American officer caught sight of the captain leaping up and\r\ndown on the deck, shrieking and flinging his arms about, as evidence\r\nthat he was ready to surrender in earnest. He threw his own flag\r\noverboard, but Lieutenant Sterrett demanded that his arms and ammunition\r\nshould follow, the remainder of the masts cut away, and the ship\r\ndismantled. That being done, Sterrett allowed him to rig a jury mast and\r\ntold him to carry his compliments to the Dey.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Tripolitans was very similar to that against the\r\nSpaniards in 1898. The _Enterprise_ had not lost a man, although the\r\nAmericans inflicted severe loss on the enemy. In July, 1802, the\r\n_Constellation_, in a fight with nine Tripolitan gunboats, drove five\r\nashore, the rest escaping by fleeing into the harbor. More than once a\r\nTripolitan vessel was destroyed, with all on board, without the loss of\r\na man on our side.\r\n\r\nBut the war was not to be brought to a close without an American\r\ndisaster. In 1803 the fine frigate _Philadelphia_, while chasing a\r\nblockade-runner, ran upon a reef in the harbor of Tripoli, and, being\r\nhelpless, a fleet of the enemy's gunboats swarmed around her and\r\ncompelled Captain Bainbridge and his crew to surrender. The frigate was\r\nfloated off at high tide and the enemy refitted her.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GALLANT EXPLOIT.\r\n\r\nOne night in February, 1804, the _Intrepid_, a small vessel under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, one of the bravest of American\r\nnaval officers, approached the _Philadelphia_, as she lay at anchor,\r\nand, being hailed, replied, through a native whom he had impressed into\r\nservice, that he was a merchantman who had lost his anchors. The\r\nTripolitans allowed the vessel to come alongside without any suspicion\r\non their part. Suddenly a score of Americans sprang up and leaped\r\nthrough the port-holes of the frigate. It took them but a few minutes to\r\nclear the deck, when the vessel was fired in several places and the men\r\nsafely withdrew. The _Philadelphia_ burned to the water's edge.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, Commodore Preble bombarded the town of Tripoli from his\r\nmortar boats. During a fight with the gunboats James Decatur, a brother\r\nof Stephen, received the surrender of one he was fighting, and stepped\r\non the deck to take possession. As he did so, the captain shot him dead.\r\nStephen had just destroyed a gunboat when he learned of this treacherous\r\noccurrence and dashed after the craft, which he boarded. Recognizing the\r\ncaptain from his immense size, he attacked him, and, in a desperate\r\npersonal encounter, in which he narrowly escaped death himself, killed\r\nthe Moor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOMB KETCH.\r\n\r\nThe Americans fixed up the _Intrepid_ as a bomb ketch, storing a hundred\r\nbarrels of powder and missiles and a hundred and fifty shells on deck.\r\nUnder command of Captain Richard Somers, and accompanied by twelve men,\r\nthe vessel ran slowly into the harbor one dark night. The intention was\r\nto fire a slow-match and then for the officer and men to withdraw in\r\nboats. Captain Somers was discovered by the enemy, and in some unknown\r\nway the ketch was blown up with all on board, and without doing any\r\nmaterial harm to the shipping and fortifications in the harbor.\r\n\r\nCommodore Preble was superseded in November by Commodore Barron, who\r\narrived with the _President_ and _Constellation_. This gave the\r\nAmericans ten vessels, carrying 264 guns. Hostilities were pressed with\r\nso much vigor that the Dey of Tripoli became anxious to make peace\r\nbefore the terrible fleet from the West destroyed him and his people.\r\nAccordingly, a treaty was signed on the 3d of June by which the\r\nTripolitans were given $60,000 for the prisoners in their hands, and the\r\npayment of tribute to them was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF LEWIS AND CLARK.\r\n\r\nIn those comparatively modern days the vast region west of the\r\nMississippi was almost unknown. President Jefferson recommended a\r\ncongressional appropriation for the exploration of the country. The\r\nappropriation being made, a party of thirty men left the Mississippi,\r\nMay 14, 1804, under command of Captains Meriwether Lewis and William\r\nClark. Both had had a good deal of experience in the Indian country, and\r\nthey ascended the Missouri in a flotilla for 2,600 miles. To the three\r\nstreams which form the Missouri they gave the names of Jefferson,\r\nGallatin, and Madison. A detachment was then left in charge of the\r\nboats, and the remainder, riding the horses they had captured and tamed,\r\nmade their way across the mountains. They discovered the two streams\r\nwhich bear their names, and traced the Columbia to its outlet in the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was absent for two years, and its report on returning\r\nadded much to our geographical knowledge of the section. They were the\r\nfirst party of white men to cross the continent north of Mexico. Captain\r\nLewis was appointed governor of Missouri Territory in 1806, and was\r\nacting as such when he committed suicide in 1809. Captain Clark was also\r\ngovernor of Missouri Territory, and afterward superintendent of Indian\r\naffairs. He died in St. Louis in 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURR AND HAMILTON DUEL.\r\n\r\nNo one read the wicked character of Aaron Burr more unerringly than\r\nAlexander Hamilton. He saw that he was ready to ruin his country for the\r\nsake of gratifying an insatiate ambition. Hamilton was always outspoken\r\nin expressing his opinions; and the hostility between the two became so\r\nbitter that Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. Although the latter had\r\nhad a son killed through the barbarous code within the preceding year,\r\nhe was foolish enough to accept the challenge, and the duel was fought\r\nat Weehawken, New Jersey, July 12, 1804. Hamilton fired in the air, but\r\nBurr aimed straight for his antagonist and inflicted a wound from which\r\nhe died the next day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Burr presided in the Senate after the duel, the whole country\r\nwas shocked by the occurrence, and his friends fell away from him. In\r\n1804, when Jefferson was re-elected to the presidency, George Clinton\r\ntook the place of Burr as Vice-President. Burr then engaged in a plot to\r\nform a new empire in the southwest, the precise nature of which is\r\nuncertain. He found a few to join with him, but it came to naught, and\r\nin 1807 he was tried at Richmond, Virginia, on the charge of treason,\r\nbut acquitted. He spent some years in wandering over Europe, and then\r\nreturned to resume the practice of law in New York. He died in obscurity\r\nand poverty on Staten Island in 1836.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVELOPMENT OF STEAM NAVIGATION FOLLOWING FULTON'S\r\nDISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\nA notable event of Jefferson's administrations was the first voyage of a\r\nsteamboat up the Hudson. This was the _Clermont_, the invention of\r\nRobert Fulton, who was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1765.\r\nThis boat was slightly over one hundred feet in length and about twenty\r\nfeet broad, with side paddle-wheels and a sheet-iron boiler brought from\r\nEngland. There was general ridicule of the idea of moving boats by steam\r\nagainst a current, and the craft was called \"Fulton's Folly.\" The crowd\r\nwhich gathered on the wharf in New York, August 1, 1807, indulged in\r\njests which were not hushed until the craft moved slowly but smoothly up\r\nstream. Heading against the current, she made the voyage to Albany in\r\nthirty-two hours. She met with some mishaps, but after a time made\r\nregular trips between that city and New York, at the rate of five miles\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN STEAMERS.\r\n\r\nThis incident marked an epoch in the history of the West, where the\r\nfirst steamboat was built in 1811. Within a few years, they were plying\r\non all the important rivers, greatly assisting emigration and the\r\ndevelopment of the country. The first steamer to cross the Atlantic was\r\nthe _Savannah_ in 1819. The screw propeller was introduced by the great\r\nSwedish inventor, John Ericsson, in 1836. Really successful ocean\r\nnavigation began in 1838, when the _Sirius_ and _Great Western_ made the\r\nvoyage from England to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT FULTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPRESSIVE COURSE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe devastating war raging between England and France was destructive to\r\nAmerican commerce and interests. The star of the wonderful Napoleon\r\nBonaparte was rapidly in the ascendant, and his marvelous military\r\ngenius seemed to threaten the \"equilibrium of the world.\" England had no\r\nlove for the United States and played havoc with our shipping. Her\r\nprivateers infested our coasts, like swarms of locusts. Because of her\r\nimmense naval superiority, she pestered us almost beyond bearing. She\r\nstopped our vessels off-shore, followed them into rivers and harbors,\r\noverhauled the crews, and in many cases took sailors away under the plea\r\nthat they were English deserters. Her claim was that \"once a British\r\nsubject, always a British subject;\" no sworn allegiance to any other\r\ngovernment could release the claim of England upon him.\r\n\r\nOur vessels were prohibited from carrying imports from the West Indies\r\nto France, but evaded the law by bringing imports to this country and\r\nthen reshipping them to France. England peremptorily ordered the\r\npractice to stop and declared that all vessels thus engaged should be\r\nlawful prizes to her ships. This action caused general indignation in\r\nthis country and thousands of citizens clamored for war.\r\n\r\nJefferson never lost his self-poise. While a thorough patriot, he knew\r\nthe meaning of war. He sent a message to Congress on the subject in\r\nJanuary, 1806, and the question was one of earnest and prolonged\r\ndiscussion, ending in the adoption of a resolution to prohibit certain\r\narticles of British manufacture.\r\n\r\nBut matters rapidly grew worse. In May following England declared the\r\ncoast of Europe, from the Elbe in Germany to Brest in France, in a state\r\nof blockade. Bonaparte retaliated with the famous Berlin Decree, which\r\nblockaded the British Islands. In the spring of 1807 the British ship\r\n_Leander_ fired into a coasting vessel and killed one of the men. The\r\nPresident issued a proclamation forbidding the _Leander_ and the two\r\nships in her company from entering any of the waters of the United\r\nStates; calling upon all officers to apprehend the captain of the\r\n_Leander_ on a charge of murder; prohibiting all communication between\r\nthe shore and the ships, and warning all citizens from giving them aid\r\nunder penalty of the law. Envoys were sent to England to adjust the\r\ntrouble, but their efforts came to naught.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFFAIR OF THE LEOPARD AND CHESAPEAKE.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this tense state when the most glaring outrage of all\r\nwas perpetrated. The British ship-of-war _Leopard_, of fifty guns, was\r\ncruising off the capes of Virginia, hunting for the American frigate\r\n_Chesapeake_, which she claimed had a number of English deserters on\r\nboard. The _Chesapeake_ was hailed, and the English captain asked\r\npermission to send dispatches on board. Such courtesies were common, and\r\nCaptain James Barron, the American commander, willingly complied with\r\nthe request. When the boat arrived, a letter was presented to Captain\r\nBarron, containing the orders of the British admiral to search the\r\n_Chesapeake_ for a number of deserters, who were mentioned by name.\r\nCaptain Barron sent word that he had no knowledge of any deserters, and\r\nrefused to submit. Thereupon the _Leopard_ fired several broadsides into\r\nthe _Chesapeake_, which, being entirely unprepared for battle, was\r\nobliged to strike her flag, three men having been killed and eighteen\r\nwounded. Four men were then selected from the crew of the _Chesapeake_,\r\nthree of whom were negroes, all declared to be deserters, and taken on\r\nboard the _Leopard_.\r\n\r\nThe country was thrown into a tumult of excitement, and the President,\r\nby proclamation, closed all American harbors and waters against the\r\nBritish navy, prohibited any intercourse with such vessels, and sent a\r\nspecial minister to England to demand satisfaction. Congress was called\r\ntogether, and a hundred thousand men in the different States were\r\nordered to hold themselves in readiness for service. The action of the\r\ncaptain of the _Leander_ was disavowed, reparation offered, and the\r\noffending admiral was recalled, but the reparation promised was never\r\nmade, and Great Britain refused to give up the right of search.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMBARGO ACT.\r\n\r\nAlthough the action of England was anything but satisfactory, it averted\r\nwar for the time. In December, Congress passed the Embargo Act, which\r\nforbade all American vessels to leave the coast of the United States.\r\nThe belief was that by thus suspending commerce with England and France,\r\nthe two countries would be forced to respect our neutrality. The real\r\nsufferers, however, were ourselves; New England and New York, whose\r\nshipping business was ruined, denounced the act in unmeasured terms.\r\nThus the administration of Jefferson, which had brought so much material\r\nprosperity to the country and was so prolific in beneficent events,\r\nclosed amid clouds and threatened disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1808.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1808, the electoral vote was as follows:\r\nJames Madison, of Virginia, Republican, 122; Charles C. Pinckney, of\r\nSouth Carolina, Federalist, 47; George Clinton, of New York, Republican,\r\n6. For Vice-President, George Clinton, Republican, 113; Rufus King, of\r\nNew York, Federalist, 47; John Langdon, of New Hampshire, 9; James\r\nMadison, 3; James Monroe, 3. Vacancy, 1. Thus Madison and Clinton became\r\nrespectively President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF MADISON, 1809-1817.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF 1812.\r\n\r\nJames Madison--The Embargo and the Non-Intercourse Acts--Revival of the\r\nLatter Against England--The _Little Belt_ and the _President_--Population\r\nof the United States in 1810--Battle of Tippecanoe--Declaration of War\r\nAgainst England--Comparative Strength of the Two Nations on the\r\nOcean--Unpopularity of the War in New England--Preparations Made by\r\nthe Government--Cowardly Surrender of Detroit--Presidential Election\r\nof 1812--Admission of Louisiana and Indiana--New National Bank\r\nChartered--Second Attempt to Invade Canada--Battle of Queenstown\r\nHeights--Inefficiency of the American Forces in 1812--Brilliant Work\r\nof the Navy--The _Constitution_ and the _Guerriere_--The _Wasp_ and\r\nthe _Frolic_--The _United States_ and the _Macedonian_--The\r\n_Constitution_ and the _Java_--Reorganization and Strengthening of the\r\nArmy--Operations in the West--Gallant Defense of Fort Stephenson--American\r\nInvasion of Ohio and Victory of the Thames--Indian Massacre at Fort\r\nMimms--Capture of York (Toronto)--Defeat of the Enemy at Sackett's\r\nHarbor--Failure of the American Invasion of Canada--The _Hornet_\r\nand _Peacock_--Capture of the _Chesapeake_--\"Don't Give Up the\r\nShip\"--Captain Decatur Blockaded at New London--Capture of the\r\n_Argus_ by the Enemy--Cruise of the _Essex_--The Glorious Victory of\r\nCommodore Perry on Lake Erie--Success of the American Arms in\r\nCanada--Battle of the Chippewa--Of Lundy's Lane--Decisive Defeat of the\r\nEnemy's Attack on Plattsburg--Punishment of the Creek Indians for the\r\nMassacre at Fort Mimms--Vigorous Action by the National\r\nGovernment--Burning of Washington by the British--The Hartford\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nJames Madison, the fourth President of the United States, was born at\r\nPort Conway, Virginia, March 16, 1751, and died June 28, 1836. He\r\nreceived the best educational facilities and graduated from Princeton\r\nCollege at the age of twenty. He devoted himself so closely to study\r\nthat he permanently injured his health. In 1776, he was elected a member\r\nof the Virginia Legislature, and was offered the mission to France,\r\nafter the return of Jefferson, but declined it. Again he had the chance\r\nof becoming Jefferson's successor, when the latter resigned as secretary\r\nof State, but refused through fear of causing differences in\r\nWashington's cabinet. He was a Federalist at first, but changed his\r\nviews and became an earnest Republican. Jefferson made him his secretary\r\nof State, and he served throughout both administrations. He was a\r\ncultured gentleman, an ardent friend of Jefferson, and carried out his\r\npolicy when he became President.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NON-INTERCOURSE ACT.\r\n\r\nJust before the close of Jefferson's last term, Congress repealed the\r\nEmbargo Act and passed the Non-Intercourse Act, which forbade all trade\r\nwith England. This was in 1809, and the law was abrogated in the\r\nfollowing year. Our relations with England, however, continued to grow\r\nmore irritating, until it became clear that war was at hand. Congress\r\ngave notice that if either Great Britain or France would repeal their\r\noffensive decrees, the Non-Intercourse Act would be revived against the\r\nother. Bonaparte immediately announced that he revoked his decrees, but\r\ninstead of doing so, he enforced them more rigidly than before, thus\r\naccomplishing what he sought, that of arraying the United States against\r\nGreat Britain. The Non-Intercourse Law was revived against Great\r\nBritain, whose conduct became more exasperating than ever. Our whole\r\ncoast was under surveillance, and many of our merchant vessels were\r\ncaptured without any excuse whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES MADISON. (1751-1836.) Two terms, 1809-1817.]\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of early evening, May 16, 1811, the British sloop _Little\r\nBelt_, while occupied in holding up American vessels, hailed the frigate\r\n_President_ off the coast of Virginia. Deeming the reply of the American\r\nnot sufficiently respectful, the _Little Belt_ fired a shot at the\r\n_President_, which instantly let fly with a broadside, followed by\r\nseveral others, that killed eleven men and wounded twenty-one. The\r\nincident added to the angry excitement in both countries and brought war\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF TIPPECANOE.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1810 was 7,239,881, somewhat more\r\nthan a third of Great Britain and Ireland. Our growth in the West was\r\nrapid. There was a continual stream of emigration thither, and the\r\nIndians, seeing how rapidly their hunting grounds were passing from\r\nthem; combined to resist the invasion. This was done under the\r\nleadership of Tecumseh, the ablest Indian that ever lived. In this\r\ncourse he was incited by British agents, who, knowing that war was\r\ncoming, were anxious to do the Americans all the harm they could. The\r\noutrages of the red men became so numerous that General William Henry\r\nHarrison, governor of the Northwest Territory, gathered a large, force\r\nand marched against them. Near the present city of Lafayette, while\r\nencamped at a place called Tippecanoe, he was furiously assailed (Nov.\r\n7, 1811) by the Indians. Tecumseh was absent at the time, and the battle\r\nwas brought on, against his orders, by his brother, called \"The\r\nProphet.\" The loss was severe on both sides, but the Indians were\r\ndecisively defeated.\r\n\r\nBy this time the American people were clamoring more loudly than ever\r\nfor war with England. The congressional candidates were obliged to\r\ndeclare whether they favored or opposed the war. Those who opposed it\r\nwere beaten at the polls. Congress, which had been making preparations\r\nfor some time for hostilities, declared war against England, June 18,\r\n1812. It is a regrettable fact that we could not know that almost on the\r\nsame day England suspended the Orders of Council, so far as they\r\naffected this country. Had the Atlantic cable been in existence at the\r\ntime, there would have been no war.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND'S OVERWHELMING NAVAL STRENGTH.\r\n\r\nEngland had been fighting so continuously with her neighbors that her\r\nstrength on the ocean was overwhelming when compared with ours. She had\r\n1,036 vessels, of which 254 were ships-of-the-line, not one of which\r\ncarried less than seventy-four guns. This immense navy was manned by\r\n144,000 men. The American navy numbered 12 vessels, besides a few\r\ngunboats of little value. Indeed, the relative strength of the warring\r\nnations was so disproportionate that the intention of the United States\r\nat first was not to attempt a conflict on the ocean. Captains Bainbridge\r\nand Stewart, however, persuaded the government to allow our little navy\r\nto try its hand.\r\n\r\nDespite the seeming hopelessness of such a struggle, it had some\r\nadvantages for the Americans. In the first place, it was easier for them\r\nto find the enemy than for the latter to find them, because of the\r\ndisproportion between the number of their vessels. More important,\r\nhowever, than all was the fact that our navy contained no politicians.\r\nThe men were brave sailors, and marvelously skillful in handling guns.\r\nWith these conditions they were sure to win glory on the ocean.\r\n\r\nStill another fact must be mentioned, for it will explain many of the\r\nincidents recorded in the following pages. England had been triumphant\r\nso long on the ocean that she had become unduly confident and careless.\r\nShe held the surrounding nations in light esteem, and had good warrant\r\nfor doing so. Naturally this led her greatly to underestimate the\r\ninsignificant American navy. When such a mistake is made the\r\nconsequences are sure to be disastrous to the one committing the\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\nTruth compels the statement that in every war in which our country has\r\nbeen engaged since the Revolution, the disasters have been mainly due to\r\nthe politicians. They have the \"pull,\" as it is called, with the\r\ngovernment, and secure the appointment of men as leaders who are\r\ntotally lacking in military skill. When defeat has followed defeat, with\r\nexasperating regularity, the government gradually awakes to the fact\r\nthat the most criminal thing it can do is to place a politician in\r\ncharge of a body of brave men, or to appoint a callow youth to the same\r\nposition, merely because his father was a good soldier and has become a\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR UNPOPULAR IN SOME SECTIONS.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be remembered that our country was by no means a unit\r\nin favoring the second war with England. It was popular in most of the\r\nMiddle States and the South, but bitterly opposed in New England. When\r\nthe news reached Boston of the declaration of war, the shipping hung\r\ntheir flags at half-mast. Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey,\r\nthrough their Legislatures, protested against it, but, as in the\r\nRevolution, the general enthusiasm swept away all opposition.\r\n\r\nAn increase of the regular army was ordered to 25,000 men, in addition\r\nto the call for 50,000 volunteers, while the States were asked to summon\r\n100,000 militia, to be used in defense of the coast and harbors. The\r\ngovernment authorized a loan of $11,000,000, and Henry Dearborn, of\r\nMassachusetts, was made the first major-general and commander-in-chief\r\nof the army, while the principal brigadiers were James Wilkinson,\r\nWilliam Hull, Joseph Bloomfield, and Wade Hampton, the last being father\r\nof the general of the same name who became famous as a Confederate\r\nleader in the War for the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHAMEFUL SURRENDER.\r\n\r\nThe opening battle of the war was one of the most shameful affairs that\r\never befell the American arms. General William Hull, who had made a\r\ncreditable record in the Revolution, was governor of Michigan Territory.\r\nHe was ordered to cross the river from Detroit, which was his home, and\r\ninvade Canada. He showed great timidity, and learning that a British\r\nforce, under General Brock, was advancing against him, he recrossed the\r\nriver and returned to Detroit, before which General Brock appeared, on\r\nthe 12th of August, at the head of 700 British soldiers and 600 Indians.\r\nIn demanding the surrender of the post, he frightened Hull, whose\r\ndaughter and her children were with him, by telling him he would be\r\nunable to restrain the ferocity of his Indians, if the Americans made a\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were brave and eager to fight, but, to their inexpressible\r\ndisgust, the siege had been pressed but a short time when Hull ran up a\r\nwhite flag and surrendered, August 16th. With the submission of Detroit\r\nwent the whole territory northwest of Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe country was angered and humiliated by the act. Twenty-five men were\r\ngiven in exchange for Hull, and he was placed on trial, charged with\r\ntreason, cowardice, and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was convicted\r\non the last two charges and sentenced to be shot. In recognition of his\r\nservices in the Revolution, however, the President pardoned him, and he\r\ndied, without ever having gained the respect of his countrymen, in 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1812.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the history of the war, a few incidents not\r\nconnected with it should be recorded. In the presidential election of\r\n1812, the electoral vote was: for President, James Madison, Republican,\r\n128; De Witt Clinton, of New York, Federalist, 89. For Vice-President,\r\nElbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts, Republican, 131; Jared Ingersoll, of\r\nPennsylvania, Federalist, 86. Vacancy, 1. Thus Madison and Gerry were\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nLouisiana was admitted as a State in 1812, being a part of the immense\r\nterritory of that name purchased from France in 1803. Indiana was\r\nadmitted in 1816, and was the second of the five States carved out of\r\nthe old Northwest Territory. It will be recalled that the United States\r\nBank was chartered in 1791 for twenty years. Its charter, therefore,\r\nexpired in 1811. In 1816, Congress chartered a new bank, on the same\r\nplan and for the same length of time. The public money was to be\r\ndeposited in it or its branches, except when the secretary of the\r\ntreasury choose to order its deposit elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF QUEENSTOWN HEIGHTS.\r\n\r\nReturning to the history of the war, it has to be said that the second\r\nattempt to invade Canada was more disastrous if possible than the first,\r\nand more disgraceful to American arms. The troops on the Niagara\r\nfrontier were mainly New York militia, with a few regulars and recruits\r\nfrom other States, all under the command of Stephen Van Rensselaer.\r\nResolved to capture the Heights of Queenstown, he sent two columns\r\nacross the river on the morning of October 13, 1812. They were led by\r\nColonel Solomon Van Rensselaer, cousin of the general and a brave\r\nofficer. The engagement was a brisk one, the colonel being wounded early\r\nin the fight, but his troops gallantly charged the Heights and captured\r\nthe fortress. General Brock was reinforced and attacked the Americans,\r\nbut was repulsed, Brock being killed. The fierceness of the battle is\r\nshown by that fact that the three commanders who succeeded Brock were\r\neither killed or severely wounded.\r\n\r\nUnder the attack of superior forces, the Americans had managed to hold\r\ntheir ground and they now began to intrench. Meanwhile, the 1,200 New\r\nYork militia on the other side of the river had become frightened by the\r\nsounds of battle, and when called upon to cross refused to do so, on the\r\ncowardly plea that they had enlisted to defend only their State.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Winfield Scott had taken command of the brigade and\r\nwas engaged in intrenching, when the enemy, again reinforced, drove his\r\ntroops, after two attacks, to the river, where they were hemmed in and\r\ncompelled to surrender. The American loss in killed and wounded was\r\nfully a thousand. General Van Rensselaer was so disgusted with the\r\nconduct of his militia that he resigned his command, and was succeeded\r\nby General Alexander Smyth, of Virginia, whose conduct led to the\r\ngeneral conviction that he was mentally about as near to being an idiot\r\nas it is possible for a man to be and still retain a little ground for\r\nbeing thought otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe first thing General Smyth did was to issue a proclamation of so\r\nbombastic a character that his friends were humiliated. He made several\r\nstarts toward Canada, but in each instance recalled his troops, and\r\nacted so inexplicably that the militia were on the point of revolting,\r\nwhen he was deprived of his command. This closed the military operations\r\nfor the year 1812, and the story is enough to crimson the cheek of every\r\nAmerican with shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRILLIANT WORK OF THE AMERICAN NAVY.\r\n\r\nOn the ocean, however, the record was brilliant and as astonishing to\r\nfriends as to enemies. Hardly had the news of the declaration of war\r\nreached New York, when Commodore John Rodgers put to sea in the\r\n_President_, the same vessel that had taught the _Little Belt_ her\r\nsevere lesson. Some time later Rodgers sighted the frigate _Belvidera_\r\nand gave chase. He killed a number of the crew, but the vessel managed\r\nto escape. Continuing his cruise, he captured a number of merchantmen\r\nand retook an American prize. The luckiest ship in the American navy was\r\nsaid to be the _Constitution_, afterward popularly known as \"Old\r\nIronsides.\" Under command of Captain Isaac Hull, nephew of the disgraced\r\ngeneral of Detroit, she engaged the sloop-of-war _Guerriere_ off the\r\ncoast of Massachusetts. The battle was a desperate one, but\r\nextraordinary marksmanship prevailed, and the enemy were compelled to\r\nstrike their flag after a loss of 79 killed and wounded, while that of\r\nthe Americans was 7 killed and 7 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe victory caused deep chagrin in England and corresponding rejoicing\r\nin the United States. Congress gave Captain Hull a gold medal and\r\ndistributed $50,000 among his crew.\r\n\r\nIn October, the sloop-of-war _Wasp_, Captain Jacob Jones, met the\r\nBritish brig _Frolic_ off Cape Hatteras. Since the vessels were of\r\nprecisely the same strength, the contest could not have been a more\r\nperfect test of the bravery and efficiency of the ships of England and\r\nour own country. As respects bravery, it was equal, for the men on both\r\nsides fought with a courage that could not have been surpassed. When\r\nthe crew of the _Wasp_ boarded the _Frolic_, they found no one on deck\r\nexcept the man at the wheel and two wounded officers. The vessels were\r\nso damaged that on the same day the British ship _Poicters_ captured\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nDuring the same month (October 25th), Commodore Stephen Decatur, in\r\ncommand of the frigate _United States_, encountered the British frigate\r\n_Macedonian_ off the Island of Madeira, and captured her after a battle\r\nof two hours, in which he lost twelve men, while that of the enemy was\r\nmore than a hundred. The _Macedonian_ was so shattered that only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty was she brought into New London.\r\n\r\nThe command of the _Constitution_ was now turned over to Bainbridge, who\r\nsighted the frigate _Java_ off the coast of Brazil, December 29th. In\r\nthe terrific battle that followed he lost 34 men, but killed 120 of the\r\nenemy, tore out every mast, and burst her hull with round shot. The\r\n_Java_ was blown up, and the prisoners and wounded were taken to Boston,\r\nwhere Bainbridge received a right royal welcome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARTS OF PEACE AND THE ART OF WAR.]\r\n\r\nThis ends the history of the first half-year of the war of 1812. While\r\neverything went wrong on land, the ocean showed only a succession of\r\nbrilliant victories. England, chagrined and humiliated, declared that\r\nher flag had been disgraced \"by a piece of striped bunting flying at the\r\nmast-heads of a few fir-built frigates, manned by a handful of outlaws.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nCongress took measures for strengthening and reorganizing the army. The\r\npay and bounty of the soldiers were increased; the President was\r\nempowered to raise twenty additional regiments of infantry, to borrow\r\nmoney, and to issue treasury notes, and provisions were made for adding\r\nfour ships-of-the-line, six frigates, and as many vessels of war on the\r\nGreat Lakes as might be needed. The army was organized into three\r\ndivisions: the Army of the North, under General Wade Hampton, to act in\r\nthe country about Lake Champlain; the Army of the Centre, under the\r\ncommander-in-chief, General Henry Dearborn, to act on the Niagara\r\nfrontier and Lake Ontario; and the Army of the East, under General\r\nWinchester, who soon after was superseded by General William Henry\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE WEST.\r\n\r\nThe last-named officer did his utmost to drive the British out of\r\nDetroit. His troops were volunteers, brave but undisciplined, and\r\ndisplayed their most effective work in scattered fighting and against\r\nthe Indians; but their success was not decisive. When the swamps and\r\nlakes of the Northwest were sufficiently frozen to bear their weight,\r\nHarrison repeated his attempts to expel the British from Detroit. His\r\nadvance, under General Winchester, was attacked on the River Raisin by\r\nthe British, led by General Proctor. Winchester was as prompt as General\r\nHull in surrendering. Proctor allowed his Indians to massacre the\r\nwounded prisoners, most of whom were Kentuckians. Thereafter, when the\r\nKentucky troops rushed into battle they raised the war-cry, \"Remember\r\nthe Raisin!\"\r\n\r\nThe disaster to Winchester caused Harrison to fall back to Fort Meigs,\r\nwhich stood near the site of the present town of Defiance. There, in the\r\nspring of 1813, he was besieged by Proctor. A force of Kentuckians\r\nrelieved him, after severe loss, and Proctor retreated. Some months\r\nlater he again advanced against Fort Meigs, but was repulsed, and\r\nmarched to Fort Stephenson, where Fremont now stands.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers consisted of 3,000 British and Indians, while the garrison\r\nnumbered only 160, under the command of Major George Croghan, only\r\ntwenty years of age. When Proctor ordered the youth to surrender he\r\nthreatened that, in case of resistance, every prisoner would be\r\ntomahawked. Major Croghan replied that when the surrender took place\r\nthere would not be a single man left to tomahawk. Although Croghan had\r\nbut a single cannon, he made so gallant a defense that his assailants\r\nwere repulsed, and Proctor, fearing the approach of Harrison, withdrew\r\nfrom the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE THAMES.\r\n\r\nPerry's great victory on Lake Erie in September, 1813, as related\r\nfurther on, gave the Americans command of that body of water. Harrison's\r\ntroops were placed on board of Perry's vessels and carried across from\r\nOhio to Canada. They landed near Malden and Proctor fell back to\r\nSandwich, with the Americans following. He continued his retreat to the\r\nThames, where, with the help of Tecumseh, he selected a good\r\nbattle-ground and awaited the Americans, who attacked him on the 5th of\r\nOctober. Proctor fled early in the battle, but his regulars fought\r\nbravely. The 1,500 Indians, under the lead of Tecumseh, displayed\r\nunusual heroism, but, when the great Tecumseh fell, they fled in a\r\npanic. The American victory was overwhelming and complete.\r\n\r\nTecumseh's irresistible eloquence had roused the Creeks to take the\r\nwarpath in the South. The danger became so imminent that 500 of the\r\ninhabitants took refuge in a stockade known as Fort Mimms, Alabama,\r\nthirty-five miles above Mobile. The sentinels, believing there was no\r\ndanger, were careless, and on August 21, 1813, nearly a thousand Creeks\r\nattacked the place, which was surprised and captured after feeble\r\nresistance. More than 200 were tomahawked, the negroes being spared to\r\nbecome slaves of the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF TORONTO (YORK).\r\n\r\nIn April of this year, General Dearborn crossed Lake Ontario from\r\nSackett's Harbor to Toronto (then known as York), which was the capital\r\nof Upper Canada and the chief depot for the supply of the western\r\ngarrisons. Under a sharp fire, General Zebulon Pike drove the enemy from\r\nthe works. The explosion of a magazine in the fort caused the death of\r\nGeneral Pike in the moment of victory.\r\n\r\nThe operations left Sackett's Harbor almost unprotected, and led to an\r\nattack by the British admiral, Sir James Yeo, and General Prevost. The\r\ncommander of the garrison appealed to General Jacob Brown, a militia\r\nofficer of the neighborhood, who hurriedly gathered a small force and\r\nadded it to the defenders. In the attack which followed Brown showed\r\ngreat skill, and General Prevost, believing his retreat was about to be\r\ncut off, fled in a panic, leaving 300 dead and wounded. In the\r\nengagements in that section during the remainder of the year, General\r\nBrown was about the only officer who displayed any military ability, his\r\nskill eventually placing him at the head of the United States army.\r\n\r\nThe fighting that followed was mainly in favor of the British, who\r\nrecaptured York. Eight hundred Americans were made prisoners at Beaver\r\nDams, and, as the autumn approached, the enemy found themselves in\r\ncommand of a powerful squadron.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCOMPETENT COMMANDERS.\r\n\r\nThere was much dissatisfaction with General Dearborn, the head of the\r\narmy. He was in ill-health, never led his troops in person, and missed a\r\ngood opportunity of capturing Montreal. He was relieved in June and\r\nsucceeded by General Wilkinson, who arrived at Sackett's Harbor in\r\nAugust. He began preparations for invading Canada, but was so laggard in\r\nhis movements that the enemy had abundance of time in which to make\r\nready. The St. Lawrence seemed to be fortified at every point, but\r\nGeneral Brown, by brave fighting, opened the way for the flotilla.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilkinson reached St. Regis, November 11th, at which point\r\nGeneral Wade Hampton was to co-operate with him. But that officer, owing\r\nto a lack of provisions, had fallen back to Plattsburg, hoping to keep\r\nopen his communications with the St. Lawrence. This obliged General\r\nWilkinson to retreat, and Wilkinson, Hampton, and other officers\r\nquarreled like so many children.\r\n\r\nDisaster and disgrace seemed to follow the American land forces during\r\nthe first two years of the war, but the fault lay wholly with the\r\nofficers, who were incompetent, and many times lacking in patriotism.\r\nThe soldiers were brave, but were comparatively powerless with such poor\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nOnce again the American navy performed brilliant work, though,\r\nunfortunately, the record was marred by a sad disaster. On February\r\n24th, Captain James Lawrence, who had made several minor captures from\r\nthe enemy, riddled the English brig-of-war _Peacock_, while in command\r\nof the _Hornet_, and, in a fierce engagement of fifteen minutes,\r\ncompelled her to surrender and hoist a signal of distress. She went down\r\nso quickly that several of the _Hornet's_ crew, who were giving aid,\r\nsank with her, besides thirteen of the enemy. Captain Lawrence treated\r\nhis prisoners so kindly that, upon reaching New York, they gave him a\r\nletter of thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF THE CHESAPEAKE BY THE SHANNON.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lawrence's fine work caused him to be promoted to the command of\r\nthe _Chesapeake_, then refitting at Boston. Captain Broke (afterward Sir\r\nPhilip, B.V.), commander of the _Shannon_, cruising off Boston,\r\nchallenged Lawrence to come out and fight him. The American promptly\r\naccepted the challenge. It was a piece of unwarrantable recklessness,\r\nfor the _Chesapeake_ was not yet ready for the sea, and his crew was\r\nundisciplined and in a surly mood, because some promised prize money\r\nhad not been paid them. Moreover, it is said that most of the sailors\r\nwere under the influence of liquor.\r\n\r\nThe _Chesapeake_ sailed gaily out of the harbor on the 1st of June,\r\nfollowed by a number of pleasure boats and barges crowded with\r\nspectators, while the hills swarmed with people, many with glasses, all\r\nanxious to witness the triumph of the gallant young captain. A woeful\r\ndisappointment awaited them.\r\n\r\nThe battle was a terrific one. In a short time the rigging of the\r\n_Chesapeake_ was so mangled that she became unmanageable, and could not\r\nescape a raking fire which did frightful execution. Captain Lawrence was\r\ntwice wounded, the last time mortally, and was carried below at the time\r\nthe enemy were preparing to board. He ordered that the colors should not\r\nbe struck. \"Tell the men to fire faster,\" he cried; \"_don't give up the\r\nship!_\"\r\n\r\nBoarders swarmed over the _Chesapeake_ and a few minutes later she was\r\ncaptured, the loss of the Americans being 48 killed and 98 wounded, that\r\nof the enemy being about half as great. Lawrence lived four days, most\r\nof the time delirious, during which he continually repeated the appeal,\r\n\"_Don't give up the ship!_\" The impressiveness of the circumstances and\r\nthe words themselves made them the motto of the American navy in many a\r\nsubsequent engagement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. JAMES MADISON\r\n\r\n(DOLLY PAYNE).\r\n\r\nDuring the burning of Washington in 1812 by the British, Dolly Madison's\r\nheroism saved the Declaration of Independence from destruction. She\r\nbroke the glass case containing it and fled.]\r\n\r\nLawrence was one of the bravest of men, and entered the navy when only\r\nseventeen years old. He helped Captain Decatur in burning the\r\n_Philadelphia_, in the harbor of Tripoli, during the war with that\r\ncountry. His body was taken to Halifax and buried with the honors of\r\nwar, several of the oldest captains in the British navy acting as\r\npall-bearers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN DECATUR CHECKED.\r\n\r\nAn exasperating experience befell Captain Decatur. On the day of the\r\ncapture of the _Chesapeake_, he was compelled to take refuge in the\r\nharbor of New London, to escape a powerful squadron. He was in command\r\nof the _United States_, the _Macedonian_, and the _Hornet_. Chafing with\r\nimpatience, he made repeated attempts to get to sea, but he declared\r\nthat in every instance the blockading squadron were notified by means of\r\nblue lights displayed by Tories on shore. He was thus held helpless\r\nuntil the close of hostilities. This betrayal by his own countrymen\r\ncaused much resentment throughout the country, and the enemies of the\r\nFederal party gave it the name of \"Blue Lights,\" and Connecticut was\r\noften taunted for her disloyal course in the war, though the offenders\r\nwere probably few in number.\r\n\r\nBy this time, England had acquired so wholesome a respect for the\r\nAmerican navy that orders were issued that two or three vessels should\r\nalways cruise in company, and under no circumstances should a single\r\nvessel engage an American, where there was the least preponderance\r\nagainst the British. The Americans were the only nation against whom\r\nsuch an order was ever issued.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Henry Allen, in command of the brig _Argus_, boldly\r\nentered the English Channel and destroyed much shipping of the enemy.\r\nMany vessels were sent in search of him, and on the 14th of August he\r\nwas captured by the _Pelican_. Soon afterward the brig _Enterprise_\r\ncaptured the British _Boxer_ off the coast of Maine. The fight was a\r\ndesperate one, both commanders being killed. They were buried side by\r\nside in Portland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUISE OF THE ESSEX.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1813, Captain David Porter (father of Admiral David\r\nDixon Porter), in command of the _Essex_, doubled Cape Horn and entered\r\nthe Pacific, where until then no American frigate had ever been seen. He\r\nprotected American vessels and nearly broke up the British whaling trade\r\nin that ocean. He made so many captures that he soon had almost a fleet\r\nunder his command, and was able to pay his men with the money taken from\r\nthe enemy. Every nation in that region was a friend of England, and he\r\nseized the Marquesas Islands, where he refitted his fleet and resumed\r\nhis cruise. Early in 1814, he entered the neutral harbor of Valparaiso,\r\nwhere he was blockaded by two British vessels that had long been\r\nsearching for him. Regardless of international law, they attacked the\r\n_Essex_, which was in a crippled condition and unable to close with\r\nthem, and finally compelled her surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS ON THE LAKES.\r\n\r\nThus far our record of the exploits of the American navy has been\r\nconfined to the ocean, but the most important doings of all occurred on\r\nthe lakes. At the beginning, our force upon these inland waters was\r\nweak. On Lake Ontario, there was but one small vessel, while the British\r\nhad several. Both sides began building war-vessels. The American fleet\r\nwas commanded by Commodore Chauncey and the British by Sir James Yeo.\r\nThey alternated in gaining command of the lake. Meanwhile, the\r\nship-builders were so busy that from about a dozen vessels on either\r\nside they increased the number to more than a hundred each by the close\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRY'S GREAT VICTORY.\r\n\r\nOne of the grandest of all triumphs was gained by the American navy in\r\nthe early autumn of 1813. Captain Oliver Hazard Perry was sent to Lake\r\nErie to build a navy. Perry at that time was not thirty years old and\r\nhad never seen a naval battle. By August, he had a squadron of two large\r\nand seven small vessels, carrying 54 guns and 416 men, with which he set\r\nout to find Commodore Barclay, who had two large and four small vessels,\r\nwith 63 guns and 440 men.\r\n\r\nThe two squadrons met at the western end of Lake Erie on the 10th of\r\nSeptember. Barclay centred such a furious fire upon the _Lawrence_,\r\nPerry's flagship, that in two hours she was in a sinking condition.\r\nPerry entered a small boat, and, exposed to a sharp fire, was rowed to\r\nthe _Niagara_, on which he hoisted his flag. The battle was renewed,\r\nand, while the enemy was trying to form a new line of battle, Perry ran\r\nthe _Niagara_ directly through the fleet, delivering broadsides right\r\nand left. The other vessels were prompt in following her, and poured\r\nsuch a raking fire into the enemy that fifteen minutes later Barclay\r\nsurrendered. The British commander had but one arm when the battle\r\nopened, and, before it ended, his remaining arm was shot off. He lost\r\n200 killed and wounded and 600 prisoners, while the Americans had 27\r\nkilled and 96 wounded.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that this victory was of the utmost\r\nimportance, for Proctor was waiting to invade Ohio, if it went his way,\r\nwhile General Harrison was also waiting to invade Canada, in the event\r\nof an American triumph. In sending news of his victory to General\r\nHarrison, Perry, in his hastily written dispatch, used the words which\r\nhave been quoted thousands of times: \"We have met the enemy and they are\r\nours.\" It will be recalled that Harrison immediately embarked his troops\r\non Perry's ships, and, crossing the lake, pursued Proctor to the Thames,\r\nwhere he decisively defeated him and ended all danger of an invasion of\r\nOhio by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe American government now began to heed the benefit of the severe\r\nlessons of defeat. The worthless generals were weeded out, and the army\r\nin western New York reorganized so effectually that the country was\r\ncheered by a number of victories--proof that the rank and file were of\r\nthe best quality and that their previous defeats were due to their\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1814, Gens. Scott, Ripley, and Brown crossed the Niagara from\r\nBlack Rock to Erie with 3,000 men. Brown's ability had become so\r\nmanifest that by this time he was a major-general. When he appeared in\r\nfront of Fort Erie, it surrendered without resistance. Brown pursued a\r\nBritish corps of observation down the river until it crossed Chippewa\r\nCreek and joined the main body. Brown withdrew and united also with the\r\nprincipal forces of the Americans, who attacked the British on the 5th\r\nof July, in their strong intrenchments behind the Chippewa. They were\r\ncompletely defeated, routed out of their defenses, and driven up the\r\nshore of Lake Ontario. Their Indian allies were so disgusted with the\r\ndefeat of the British and the furious fighting of the Americans that all\r\ndeserted the British commander.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LUNDY'S LANE.\r\n\r\nThe British army received reinforcements and turned back to meet the\r\nAmericans who were pursuing them. The armies met, July 25th, at Lundy's\r\nLane, within sight of Niagara Falls, where the fiercely contested\r\nbattle, beginning at sunset, lasted until midnight. The British\r\ncommander was wounded and captured and the enemy driven back. The loss\r\nof the Americans was serious. Scott was so badly wounded that he could\r\ntake no further part in the war, Brown was less severely injured, and\r\nRipley withdrew with the army to Fort Erie.\r\n\r\nAn exploit of Colonel James Miller deserves notice. At a critical point\r\nin the battle, General Brown saw that victory depended upon the\r\nsilencing of a battery of seven guns stationed on a hill, that was\r\npouring a destructive fire into the Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" said he, \"can you capture that battery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can try,\" was the modest reply, and a few minutes later Colonel\r\nMiller was in motion with his regiment. The darkness enabled the men to\r\nconceal themselves under the shadow of a fence, along which they\r\nsilently crept until they could peep between the rails and see the\r\ngunners standing with lighted matches awaiting the order to fire.\r\nThrusting the muzzles of their guns through the openings, they shot down\r\nevery gunner, and, leaping over the fence, captured the battery in the\r\nface of a hot infantry fire. The enemy made three attempts to recapture\r\nthe battery, but were repulsed each time. When General Ripley retreated,\r\nhe left the guns behind, so that they again fell into the hands of the\r\nBritish from whom they had been so brilliantly won.\r\n\r\nThe enemy soon received reinforcements and besieged the Americans in\r\nFort Erie. Brown, although still suffering from his wound, resumed\r\ncommand and drove his besiegers once more beyond the Chippewa. The\r\nAmericans evacuated Fort Erie on the 5th of November, and recrossing the\r\nNiagara went into winter quarters at Black Rock and Ontario. There were\r\nno more military operations during the war between Lakes Erie and\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilkinson was so inefficient with the Army of the North that he\r\nwas superseded by General Izard, who advanced with his force to the aid\r\nof General Brown at Fort Erie. This left Plattsburg uncovered, and the\r\nBritish decided to attack it by land, and to destroy at the same time\r\nthe American flotilla on Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nSir George Prevost, at the head of an army of 14,000 men, entered\r\nAmerican territory on the 3d of September, and three days later reached\r\nPlattsburg. The garrison withdrew to the south side of the Saranac, and\r\nprepared to dispute the passage of the stream. Commodore Downie appeared\r\noff the harbor of Plattsburg, with the British squadron, September 11th.\r\nThe American squadron, under Commodore Macdonough, was in the harbor,\r\nand consisted of two less barges than the enemy, 86 guns, and 820 men,\r\nwhile the English commander had 95 guns and more than a thousand men.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle which followed the British land forces made repeated\r\nattempts to cross the Saranac, but were defeated in every instance. The\r\nbattle on the water lasted less than three hours, during which Commodore\r\nDownie was killed, his vessel sunk, and the remainder sunk or captured.\r\nThe destruction of the British squadron was complete, and the land\r\nforces withdrew during the night. England was so dissatisfied with the\r\naction of Sir George Prevost that he was dismissed from command. No more\r\nserious fighting took place in that section during the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENT OF THE CREEK INDIANS.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the massacre at Fort Mimms in Alabama by the\r\nCreeks, August 30, 1813. Tennessee acted with prompt vigor. General\r\nJackson at the head of 5,000 men marched into the Creek country and\r\npunished the Indians with merciless rigor. After repeated defeats, the\r\nCreeks made a stand at the Great Horseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa River.\r\nThere a thousand warriors gathered, with their wives and children,\r\nprepared to fight to the last. The desperate battle was fought March 27,\r\n1814, and at its close 600 Indians were killed and the remainder\r\nscattered. The spirit of the Creeks was crushed, and General Jackson's\r\nexploit made him the most popular military leader in the Southwest.\r\n\r\nMatters looked gloomy for the Americans at the beginning of 1814.\r\nEngland sent a formidable force of veterans to Canada, and another to\r\ncapture Washington, while the main body expected to take New Orleans,\r\nwith the intention of retaining the city and province of Louisiana upon\r\nthe conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR THE FINAL STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\nThe American government gathered up her loins for the great struggle.\r\nThe President was authorized to borrow $25,000,000, and to issue\r\ntreasury notes to the amount of $5,000,000. Such sums are but bagatelles\r\nin these days, but in 1814 the credit of the government was so poor that\r\nthe notes depreciated one-fifth of their face value. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-four dollars were offered as a bounty for every recruit, while\r\nthe pay, rations, and clothing were placed upon a generous scale. An\r\norder was issued increasing the regular army to 66,000 men, and an\r\nembargo laid with the aim of stopping trade under British licenses was\r\nrepealed in April.\r\n\r\nThe British cruisers kept the Atlantic coast in continual alarm.\r\nEntering Delaware Bay they burned every merchant vessel in sight. When\r\nthe people of Lewiston refused to sell food to them, they bombarded\r\ntheir homes. In Chesapeake Bay Admiral Cockburn plundered private\r\ndwellings. Among the places sacked and burned were Lewes, Havre de\r\nGrace, Fredericktown, and Georgetown. More leniency was shown the New\r\nEngland coast because of her opposition to the war. Another inexcusable\r\nproceeding on the part of the invaders was that of persuading many\r\nslaves to leave their masters and join the enemy. This business\r\ncompelled England, after the close of the war, to pay the United States\r\none million and a quarter dollars, on the award of the Emperor of Russia\r\nto whom the question was submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE AND BURNING OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBut this year saw the crowning disgrace to the American arms. The\r\nmismanagement of affairs left our national capital defenseless. In\r\nAugust, 1814, Sir Alexander Cochrane carried a British army up the\r\nChesapeake on board his squadron. Commodore Barney with his few ships\r\nhad taken shelter in the Patuxent. Paying no attention to him, Ross\r\nlanded his 5,000 veterans within 40 miles of Washington and advanced\r\nagainst the city. The government had awakened to the threatened peril a\r\nshort time before, and placed 500 regulars and 2,000 undisciplined\r\nmilitia under the command of General William H. Winder.\r\n\r\nWinder took a strong position at Bladensburg and awaited Ross and\r\nCochrane. The British army met with no opposition, and, upon reaching\r\nMarlborough, found that Commodore Barney, acting under the orders of the\r\nsecretary of war, had burned his fleet and hurried to Washington. The\r\nEnglish commander arrived in sight of Washington on the 24th of August.\r\nHis approach to Bladensburg was over a bridge defended by artillery from\r\nBarney's flotilla, which were handled by Barney and his sailors. They\r\nfought with the utmost heroism, repelling the British again and again;\r\nbut the militia fled, and, when Barney was wounded and his command\r\nhelpless, he surrendered. General Ross complimented him for his bravery\r\nand immediately paroled him.\r\n\r\nThis was the only check encountered by the British in their advance upon\r\nWashington. General Winder had learned enough of his militia to know\r\nthat no dependence could be placed upon them, and he fled to Georgetown.\r\nThe President, heads of departments, and most of the citizens joined in\r\nthe stampede, and the advance guard of General Ross entered the city\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING OF WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThe British commander offered to spare the city for a large sum of\r\nmoney, but no one was within reach with authority to comply with his\r\ndemand. Ross claimed that his flag of truce had been fired on, and he\r\nordered the city to be burned. In the conflagration that followed, the\r\nPresident's house, the department offices, numerous private dwellings,\r\nthe libraries and public archives, many works of art in the public\r\nbuildings, the navy yard and its contents, a frigate on the stocks, and\r\nseveral small vessels were destroyed. The patent office and jail were\r\nthe only public property spared. The burning of Washington was an\r\noutrage which was generally condemned in England.\r\n\r\nAfter a rest and the reception of reinforcements, Ross marched against\r\nBaltimore, which he declared should be his winter quarters. While on the\r\nroad he was mortally wounded by an American sharpshooter in a tree. Such\r\na brave defense was made by Forts McHenry and Covington, guarding the\r\nnarrow passage from the Patapsco into the harbor of Baltimore, that the\r\nBritish fleet and the land forces were repelled. The success of this\r\ndefense inspired Francis S. Key to write our famous national song, _The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARTFORD CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe war became intensely unpopular in New England. Its shipping suffered\r\nseverely, and the demands for peace grew more clamorous. On the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1814, a convention of delegates, appointed by the Legislatures\r\nof Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Vermont,\r\nmet in Hartford and held secret sessions for three weeks. An address was\r\nagreed upon charging the national government with carrying on a policy\r\ninjurious to New England. Amendments were proposed to the Constitution,\r\nand a committee was selected to confer with the government at Washington\r\nand to propose that the revenues of New England should be applied to her\r\nown defense. An agreement was made that if their proposed action failed,\r\nand peace was not soon made, the convention should meet again in the\r\nfollowing June. There was open talk of a withdrawal from the Union, and\r\ndoubtless grave results would have followed had the war gone on. The\r\nHartford Convention and the \"Blue Lights\" of Connecticut gave the final\r\ndeath-blow to the Federal party.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATY OF PEACE SIGNED.\r\n\r\nDespite the progress of the war, peace negotiations had been going on\r\nfor a long time. Russia, whose system of government has always been the\r\nexact opposite of ours, has shown us marked friendship in many\r\ninstances. As early as 1813 she offered to mediate between Great Britain\r\nand the United States. The President appointed five commissioners, John\r\nQuincy Adams, James A. Bayard, Henry Clay, Jonathan Russell, and Albert\r\nGallatin, who were sent to Ghent, Belgium, where they were met by Lord\r\nGambier, Henry Goulburn, and William Adams, the commissioners for Great\r\nBritain. After long negotiations, the commissioners reached an agreement\r\non the 24th of December, 1814. The treaty did not contain a word about\r\nthe search of American vessels for alleged deserters, which was the real\r\ncause of the war, nor was any reference made to the wrongs done our\r\ncommerce, and the rights of neutral nations were not defined. The Orders\r\nof Council, however, died of themselves, Great Britain never again\r\nattempting to enforce them. It was agreed that all places captured by\r\neither side during the progress of the war or afterward should be\r\nsurrendered, and provisions were made for fixing the boundary between\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nIn those days, when the ocean telegraph was not thought of and there\r\nwere no swift-going steamers, news traveled slowly, and it did not reach\r\nWashington until February 4, 1815. Meanwhile, the most important battle\r\nof the war had taken place and several captures were made on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Creek Indians had been so crushed by General Jackson that they ceded\r\na large part of their lands to the Americans. They were sullen, and when\r\na British squadron entered the Gulf of Mexico they eagerly did all they\r\ncould to help the enemy. The squadron, by permission of the Spanish\r\nauthorities took possession of the forts of Pensacola, and fitted out an\r\nexpedition against Fort Bower at the entrance to Mobile Bay. They\r\nattacked the fort, September 15th, by sea and land, but were repulsed.\r\nAmong the land assailants were several hundred Creek warriors, who thus\r\nreceived another lesson of the bravery of American soldiers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson, in command of the southern military district, was\r\nenraged by the course of the Spanish authorities. He marched from Mobile\r\nat the head of 2,000 Tennessee militia and a number of Choctaws, stormed\r\nPensacola, November 7th, drove the British from the harbor, and\r\ncompelled the Spanish governor to surrender the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL JACKSON'S GREAT VICTORY AT NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his work in this summary fashion, he returned to\r\nMobile, where he found an urgent call for him to go to the defense of\r\nNew Orleans, which was threatened by a powerful force of the enemy. The\r\ninvasion, to which we have referred in another place, was a formidable\r\none and had been arranged a long time before. General Jackson reached\r\nNew Orleans, December 2d, and began vigorous preparations. He enlisted\r\nalmost everybody capable of bearing arms, including negroes and\r\nconvicts. One of the most famous freebooters that ever ravaged the Gulf\r\nof Mexico was Lafitte, to whom the British made an extravagant offer for\r\nhis help, but he refused, and gave his services to Jackson.\r\n\r\nJackson's vigor filled the city with confidence, but he was so strict\r\nthat dissatisfaction was expressed, whereupon he declared martial law;\r\nin other words, he took the city government into his own hands and ruled\r\nas he thought best. He neglected no precaution. Fort St. Philip,\r\nguarding the passage of the Mississippi at Detour la Plaquemine, was\r\nmade stronger by new works, and a line of fortifications was built four\r\nmiles below the city, on the left of the river, and extended eastward to\r\nan impassable cypress swamp. It was a disputed question for a time\r\nwhether Jackson used cotton bales in the defenses of New Orleans, but it\r\nis established that he placed them on the tops of the intrenchments.\r\nCannon were also mounted at different points. The militia under General\r\nMorgan, and the crews and guns of a part of the squadron of Commodore\r\nPatterson, held the west bank of the river. These precautions enabled\r\nthe defenders to enfilade the approaching enemy. A detachment guarded\r\nthe pass of Bayou St. John, above the city, and a number of gunboats\r\nawaited to dispute the passage of the river between Lake Pontchartrain\r\nand Lake Borgne.\r\n\r\nThe British fleet appeared at the entrance to this channel, December\r\n14th, and was immediately assailed by the American flotilla, which was\r\ndestroyed before it could inflict serious damage. Left free to select\r\nthe point of attack, the British sent a force in flat-bottomed boats to\r\nthe extremity of the lake, where they landed in a swamp. They repelled\r\nan attack by Jackson, who fell back toward the city. On the 28th of\r\nDecember the British were within half a mile of the American lines. They\r\nbegan a fire of shells, but were repulsed by Jackson's artillery.\r\n\r\nThe defenders numbered some 3,000 militia, who were stationed in a line\r\nof intrenchments a mile long and four miles from the town. This line was\r\nprotected by a ditch in front, flanked by batteries on the other side of\r\nthe river, and, in addition, eight other batteries were in position.\r\n\r\nThe British worked slowly forward until on the first day of the year\r\nthey were within less than a quarter of a mile of New Orleans. As the\r\nbest material at hand from which to erect breastworks they used\r\nhogsheads of sugar and molasses, which were sent flying in fragments by\r\nthe American cannon. Several attacks upon the defenders were repulsed\r\nand the final assault delayed for a number of days.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Pakenham, a veteran of the Peninsular wars, and a\r\nbrother-in-law of Wellington, the conqueror of Napoleon, was in command\r\nof the reinforcements. While the advance went on slowly, 3,000 militia\r\njoined Jackson. They were composed mainly of Kentucky and Tennessee\r\nriflemen, the finest marksmen in the world. They were men, too, who did\r\nnot lose their heads in battle, but, kneeling behind their\r\nintrenchments, coolly took aim and rarely threw away a shot.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Jan. 8, 1815, the English army advanced against the\r\nAmerican intrenchments. They numbered nearly 8,000 veterans, and England\r\nnever placed a finer body of men in the field. The American riflemen,\r\nwith shotted cannon and leveled rifles, calmly awaited the command to\r\nopen on the advancing host. They were formed in two lines, those at the\r\nrear loading for those in front, who were thus enabled to keep up an\r\nalmost continuous fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEATHERSFORD AND GENERAL JACKSON.]\r\n\r\nBefore the outburst of flame the British dissolved like snow in the sun,\r\nbut the survivors with unsurpassable heroism persisted until it was\r\napparent that not a man would be left alive if they maintained their\r\nground. Then they fell back to decide upon some other method of attack.\r\n\r\nAngered by his repulse, Pakenham ran to the head of a regiment bearing\r\nscaling ladders and called upon his men to follow him. Only a few\r\nsucceeded in piercing the American lines. Pakenham fell, mortally\r\nwounded; his successor was killed, and the third in command was so badly\r\ninjured that he could give no orders. \"All that were left of them\"\r\nretreated. From the opening to the close of the battle was less than\r\nhalf an hour, during which the British lost 2,500 in killed, wounded,\r\nand prisoners, one-third being killed. On the American side eight were\r\nkilled and thirteen wounded. A few days later the British withdrew to\r\ntheir ships and sailed for the West Indies, where they learned of the\r\nsigning of the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE AMERICAN NAVY.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that as the war progressed the principal fighting\r\nchanged from the ocean to the land. Several encounters took place on the\r\nsea, but they were mostly unimportant, and did not always result\r\nfavorably for us. In September, 1814, Captain Samuel C. Reid, in command\r\nof the privateer _Armstrong_, while lying in the harbor of Fayal, one of\r\nthe Azores, was attacked by a fleet of boats from three British\r\nfrigates. He fought all through the night, and, although outnumbered\r\ntwenty to one, made one of the most remarkable defenses in naval annals.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January following, the _President_ was captured by the\r\nBritish ship _Endymion_. On the 20th of February, while Captain Charles\r\nStewart was cruising off Cape St. Vincent, in the _Constitution_, with\r\nno thought that peace had been declared, he fell in with two British\r\nbrigs, the _Cyane_ and the _Levant_. It was a bright moonlight night,\r\nand, after a brief engagement, in which Stewart displayed consummate\r\nseamanship, he captured both vessels.\r\n\r\nBut peace had come and was joyfully welcomed everywhere. The war had\r\ncost us heavily in men, ships, and property; the New England factories\r\nwere idle, commerce at a standstill, and the whole country in a\r\ndeplorable state. But everything now seemed to spring into life under\r\nthe glad tidings. The shipping in New England was decked with bunting,\r\nand, within twenty-four hours after the news arrived, the dockyards rang\r\nwith the sound of saw and hammer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH ALGIERS.\r\n\r\nThe Barbary States did not forget their rough treatment at the hands of\r\nthe United States a few years before. During the war they allowed the\r\nBritish to capture American vessels in their harbors, and sometimes\r\ncaptured them on their own account. In 1812 the Dey of Algiers compelled\r\nthe American consul to pay him a large sum of money to save himself,\r\nfamily, and a few friends from being carried off into slavery. We were\r\ntoo busily occupied elsewhere to give this barbarian attention, but in\r\nMarch, 1815, war was declared against Algiers, and Commodores Decatur\r\nand Bainbridge were sent to the Mediterranean with two squadrons to\r\nconduct operations.\r\n\r\nThey did it to perfection. After capturing several frigates, they\r\napproached the city of Algiers and demanded the immediate surrender of\r\nevery American prisoner, full indemnity for all property destroyed, and\r\nthe disavowal of all future claims to tribute. The terrified Dey eagerly\r\nsigned the treaty placed before him on the quarter-deck of Decatur's\r\nship. The Pasha of Tunis was compelled to pay a round sum on account of\r\nthe American vessels he had allowed the British to capture in his harbor\r\nduring the war. When he had done this, the Pasha of Tripoli was called\r\nupon and forced to make a similar contribution to the United States\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDING OF THE NATIONAL COLONIZATION SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe negro had long been a disturbing factor in politics, and, in 1816,\r\nthe National Colonization Society was formed in Princeton, N.J., and\r\nimmediately reorganized in Washington. Its object was to encourage the\r\nemancipation of slaves by obtaining a place for them outside the United\r\nStates, whither they might emigrate. It was hoped also that by this\r\nmeans the South would be relieved of its free black population. The\r\nscheme was so popular that branches of the society were established in\r\nalmost every State. At first free negroes were sent to Sierra Leone, on\r\nthe western coast of Africa, under the equator. Later, for a short time,\r\nthey were taken to Sherbrooke Island, but in 1821 a permanent location\r\nwas purchased at Cape Mesurado, where, in 1847, the colony declared\r\nitself an independent republic under the name of Liberia. Its capital,\r\nMonrovia, was named in honor of the President of the United States. The\r\nrepublic still exists, but its functions were destroyed by the war for\r\nthe Union, which abolished slavery on this continent, and Liberia has\r\nnever been looked upon with great favor by the colored people of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1816.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the course of the Federal party in the\r\nWar of 1812 ruined it. The Federal nominee for the presidency was Rufus\r\nKing, of New York. He was a native of Maine, a graduate of Harvard\r\nCollege, and had served as a delegate to the Continental Congress. It\r\nwas he who in 1785 moved the provision against slavery in the Northwest\r\nTerritory, and he was an active member of the Constitutional Convention\r\nof 1787, afterward returning to Massachusetts and giving all his\r\nenergies to bringing about the ratification of the Constitution. He was\r\nUnited States senator from New York in 1789-1796; was minister to\r\nLondon, 1796-1803; and again a United States senator, 1813-1825.\r\n\r\nJohn Eager Howard, the candidate for the vice-presidency, had hardly a\r\nless claim upon the recognition of his countrymen, for he joined the\r\npatriot army at the outbreak of the Revolution, and fought with marked\r\ngallantry at White Plains, Germantown, Monmouth, and Camden, and won\r\nspecial honor at the Cowpens in 1781. He was afterward governor of\r\nMaryland, declined the portfolio of war in Washington's cabinet, and was\r\nUnited States senator from 1796 to 1803.\r\n\r\nThese facts are given to show the character and standing of the\r\ncandidates of the Federalists in the presidential election of 1816. The\r\nfollowing was the result: For President, James Monroe, of Virginia,\r\nRepublican, 133; Rufus King, of New York, Federalist, 34. For\r\nVice-President, Daniel D. Tompkins, of New York, Republican, 183; John\r\nEager Howard, of Maryland, Federalist, 22; James Ross, of Pennsylvania,\r\n5; John Marshall, of Virginia, 4; Robert G. Harper, of Maryland, 3.\r\nVacancies, 4. Thus Monroe became President and Tompkins Vice-President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST TRAIN OF CARS IN AMERICA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF JAMES MONROE AND JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, 1817-1829.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe--The \"Era of Good Feeling\"--The Seminole War--Vigorous\r\nMeasures of General Jackson--Admission of Mississippi, Illinois,\r\nAlabama, Maine, and Missouri--The Missouri Compromise--The Monroe\r\nDoctrine--Visit of Lafayette--Introduction of the Use of Gas--Completion\r\nof the Erie Canal--The First \"Hard Times\"--Extinction of the West Indian\r\nPirates--Presidential Election of 1824--John Quincy Adams--Prosperity of\r\nthe Country--Introduction of the Railway Locomotive--Trouble with the\r\nCherokees in Georgia--Death of Adams and Jefferson--Congressional Action\r\non the Tariff--Presidential Election of 1828.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, was born at\r\nMonroe's Creek, Westmoreland County, Virginia, April 28, 1758, and died\r\nJuly 4, 1831. It will be noticed that four out of the first five\r\nPresidents were natives of Virginia, and in course of time three others\r\nfollowed. It will be admitted, therefore, that the State has well earned\r\nthe title of the \"Mother of Presidents.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n(1758-1831.) Two terms, 1817-1825.]\r\n\r\nMonroe received his education at William and Mary College, and was a\r\nsoldier under Washington. He was not nineteen years old when, as\r\nlieutenant at the battle of Trenton, he led a squad of men who captured\r\na Hessian battery as it was about to open fire. He studied law under\r\nJefferson, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and, when\r\ntwenty-five years old, was a delegate to the Continental Congress. He\r\nwas minister plenipotentiary to France in 1794, but his course\r\ndispleased the administration and he was recalled. From 1799 to 1802 he\r\nwas governor of Virginia, and, in the latter year, was sent to France by\r\nPresident Jefferson to negotiate the purchase of Louisiana. In 1811 he\r\nwas again governor of Virginia, and shortly afterward appointed\r\nsecretary of State by Madison. He also served as secretary of war at the\r\nsame time, and, as the treasury was empty, pledged his private means for\r\nthe defense of New Orleans. Monroe was of plain, simple manners, of\r\nexcellent judgment and of the highest integrity. While his career did\r\nnot stamp him as a man of genius, yet it proved him to be that which in\r\nhis situation is better--an absolutely \"safe\" man to trust with the\r\nhighest office in the gift of the American people. Under Monroe the\r\nUnited States made greater advancement than during any previous decade.\r\n\r\nEverything united to make his administration successful. The Federal\r\nparty having disappeared, its members either stopped voting or joined\r\nthe Republicans. Since, therefore, everybody seemed to be agreed in his\r\npolitical views, the period is often referred to as \"the era of good\r\nfeeling,\" a condition altogether too ideal to continue long.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARIFF LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\nShortly after Monroe's inauguration he made a tour through the country,\r\nvisiting the principal cities, and contributing by his pleasing manner\r\ngreatly to his popularity. The manufactures of the country were in a low\r\nstate because of the cheapness of labor in Great Britain, which enabled\r\nthe manufacturers there to send and sell goods for less prices than the\r\ncost of their manufacture in this country. Congress met the difficulty\r\nby imposing a tax upon manufactured goods brought hither, and thereby\r\ngave our people a chance to make and sell the same at a profit. The\r\ncontroversy between the advocates of free trade and protection has been\r\none of the leading questions almost from the first, and there has never\r\nbeen and probably never will be full accord upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEMINOLE WAR.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important event in the early part of Monroe's\r\nadministration was the Seminole war. Those Indians occupied Florida, and\r\ncould hide themselves in the swampy everglades and defy pursuit. Many\r\nrunaway slaves found safe refuge there, intermarried with the Seminoles,\r\nand made their homes among them. They were not always fairly treated by\r\nthe whites, and committed many outrages on the settlers in Georgia and\r\nAlabama. When the Creeks, who insisted they had been cheated out of\r\ntheir lands, joined them, General Gaines was sent to subdue the savages.\r\nHe failed, and was caught in such a dangerous situation that General\r\nJackson hastily raised a force and marched to his assistance.\r\n\r\nSince Florida belonged to Spain, Jackson was instructed by our\r\ngovernment not to enter the country except in pursuit of the enemy. \"Old\r\nHickory\" was not the man to allow himself to be hampered by such orders,\r\nand, entering Florida in March, 1818, he took possession the following\r\nmonth of the Spanish post of St. Mark's, at the head of Appalachee Bay.\r\nSeveral Seminoles were captured, and, proof being obtained that they\r\nwere the leaders in a massacre of some settlers a short time before,\r\nJackson hanged every one of them.\r\n\r\nAdvancing into the interior, he captured two British subjects, Robert C.\r\nAmbrister, an Englishman, and Alexander Arbuthnot, a Scotchman. There\r\nseemed to be no doubt that the latter had been guilty of inciting the\r\nIndians to commit their outrages, and both were tried by court-martial,\r\nwhich sentenced Arbuthnot to be hanged and Ambrister to receive fifty\r\nlashes and undergo a year's imprisonment. Jackson set aside the verdict,\r\nand shot the Englishman and hanged the Scotchman. He then marched\r\nagainst Pensacola, the capital of the province, drove out the Spanish\r\nauthorities, captured Barrancas, whose troops and officials were sent to\r\nHavana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN'S DECLARATION OF WAR.]\r\n\r\nJackson carried things with such a high hand that Spain protested, and\r\nCongress had to order an investigation. The report censured Jackson; but\r\nCongress passed a resolution acquitting him of all blame, and he became\r\nmore popular than ever.\r\n\r\nSpain was not strong enough to expel the Americans, and she agreed to a\r\ntreaty, in October, 1820, by which East and West Florida were ceded to\r\nthe United States, the latter paying Spain $5,000,000. The Sabine River,\r\ninstead of the Rio Grande, was made the dividing line between the\r\nterritories of the respective governments west of the Mississippi.\r\nJackson was the first governor of Florida, and, as may be supposed, he\r\nhad a stormy time, but he straightened out matters with the same iron\r\nresolution that marked everything he did.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATES ADMITTED--THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.\r\n\r\nA number of States were admitted to the Union while Monroe was\r\nPresident. The first was Mississippi, in 1817. The territory was claimed\r\nby Georgia, which gave it to the United States in 1802. Illinois was\r\nadmitted in 1818, being the third of the five States formed from the old\r\nNorthwest Territory. Alabama became a State in 1819, and had been a part\r\nof the territory claimed by Georgia. Maine was admitted in 1820, and, as\r\nhas been shown, was for a long time a part of Massachusetts, and\r\nMissouri became a State in 1821.\r\n\r\nThe strife over the admission of the last-named State was so angry that\r\nmore than one person saw the shadow of the tremendous civil war that was\r\nto darken the country and deluge it in blood forty years later. The\r\ninvention of the cotton gin in 1793 had made cotton the leading industry\r\nof the South and given an enormous importance to slavery. The soil and\r\nthe climate and economic conditions caused it to flourish in the South,\r\nand the lack of such conditions made it languish and die out in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nMissouri applied for admission in March, 1818, but it was so late in the\r\nsession that Congress took no action. At the following session a bill\r\nwas introduced containing a provision that forbade slavery in the\r\nproposed new State. The debate was bitter and prolonged, accompanied by\r\nthreats of disunion, but a compromise was reached on the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1821, when the agreement was made that slavery was to be\r\npermitted in Missouri, but forever prohibited in all other parts of the\r\nUnion, north and west of the northern limits of Arkansas, 36 deg. 30',\r\nwhich is the southern boundary of Missouri. The State was admitted August\r\n21st, increasing the number to twenty-four. The census showed that in\r\n1820 the population of the United States was 9,633,822. The State of New\r\nYork contained the most people (1,372,111); Virginia next (1,065,116);\r\nand Pennsylvania almost as many (1,047,507).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1820.\r\n\r\nIt was in the autumn of 1820, during the excitement over the admission\r\nof Missouri, that the presidential election occurred. The result is not\r\nlikely ever to be repeated in the history of our country. There was no\r\ncandidate against Monroe, who would have received every electoral vote,\r\nbut for the action of one member, who declared that no man had the right\r\nto share that honor with Washington. He therefore cast his single vote\r\nfor Adams of Massachusetts. For Vice-President, Daniel D. Tompkins,\r\nRepublican, received 218; Richard Stockton, of New Jersey, 8; Daniel\r\nRodney, of Delaware, 4; Robert G. Harper, of Maryland, and Richard\r\nRush, of Pennsylvania, 1 vote each. Monroe and Tompkins were therefore\r\nre-elected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONROE DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\nSouth America has long been the land of revolutions. In 1821, there was\r\na general revolt against Spain in favor of independence. Great sympathy\r\nwas felt for them in this country, and, in March, 1822, Congress passed\r\na bill recognizing the embryo republics as sovereign nations. In the\r\nfollowing year President Monroe sent a message to Congress in which he\r\ndeclared that for the future the American continent was not to be\r\nconsidered as territory for colonization by any foreign power. This\r\nconsecration of the whole Western Hemisphere to free institutions\r\nconstitutes the MONROE DOCTRINE, one of the most precious and jealously\r\nguarded rights of the American nation. The memorable document which\r\nbears the President's name was written by John Quincy Adams, his\r\nsecretary of State.\r\n\r\nAmerica could never forget Lafayette, who had given his services without\r\npay in our struggle for independence, who shed his blood for us, and who\r\nwas the intimate and trusted friend of Washington. He was now an old\r\nman, and, anxious to visit the country he loved so well, he crossed the\r\nocean and landed in New York, in August, 1824. He had no thought that\r\nhis coming would cause any stir, and was overwhelmed by the honors shown\r\nhim everywhere. Fort Lafayette saluted him as he sailed up New York Bay,\r\nand processions, parades, addresses, feastings, and every possible\r\nattention were given to him throughout his year's visit, during which he\r\nwas emphatically the \"nation's guest.\" Nor did the country confine\r\nitself to mere honors. He had been treated badly in France and was poor.\r\nCongress made him a present of $200,000 in money, and sent him home in\r\nthe frigate _Brandywine_, named in his honor, for it was at the battle\r\nof the Brandywine that Lafayette was severely wounded.\r\n\r\nAn important invention introduced into this country from England in 1822\r\nwas lighting by gas, which soon became universal, to be succeeded in\r\nlater years by electricity. Steamboat navigation was common and travel\r\nby that means easy. On land we were still confined to horseback and\r\nstages, but there was great improvement in the roads, through the aid of\r\nCongress and the different States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETION OF THE ERIE CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal, connecting Buffalo and Albany, was begun on the 4th of\r\nJuly, 1817, its most persistent advocate being Governor De Witt Clinton.\r\nIt was costly, and the majority believed it would never pay expenses.\r\nThey dubbed it \"De Witt Clinton's Ditch,\" and ridiculed the possibility\r\nthat it would prove of public benefit. In October, 1825, it was opened\r\nfor public traffic. It is 363 miles long, having the greatest extent of\r\nany canal in the world. It passes through a wonderfully fertile region,\r\nwhich at that time was little more than a wilderness. Immediately towns\r\nand villages sprang into existence along its banks. Merchandise could\r\nnow be carried cheaply from the teeming West, through the Great Lakes,\r\nthe Erie Canal, and the Hudson River, to New York City and the Atlantic.\r\nIts original cost was $7,600,000, and its earnings were so enormous that\r\nin many single years they amounted to half that sum. It is now operated\r\nby the State without charge to those using it.\r\n\r\nNo combination of statesmen are wise enough to prevent the occasional\r\nrecurrence of \"hard times.\" Nearly everyone has a cure for the blight,\r\nand the intervals between them are irregular, but they still descend\r\nupon us, when most unexpected and when it seems we are least prepared to\r\nbear them. No one needs a long memory to recall one or two afflictions\r\nof that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST \"HARD TIMES.\"\r\n\r\nThe first financial stringency visited the country in 1819. The\r\nestablishment in 1817 of the Bank of the United States had so improved\r\ncredit and increased the facilities for trade that a great deal of wild\r\nspeculation followed. The officers of the branch bank in Baltimore were\r\ndishonest and loaned more than $2,000,000 beyond its securities. The\r\nPresident stopped the extravagant loans, exposed the rogues, and greatly\r\naided in bringing back the country to a sound financial basis, although\r\nthe Bank of the United States narrowly escaped bankruptcy--a calamity\r\nthat would have caused distress beyond estimate.\r\n\r\nAmid the stirring political times our commerce suffered from the pirates\r\nwho infested the West Indies. Their depredations became so annoying that\r\nin 1819 Commodore Perry, of Lake Erie fame, was sent out with a small\r\nsquadron to rid the seas of the pests. Before he could accomplish\r\nanything, he was stricken with yellow fever and died. Other squadrons\r\nwere dispatched to southern waters, and in 1822 more than twenty\r\npiratical vessels were destroyed in the neighborhood of Cuba. Commodore\r\nPorter followed up the work so effectively that the intolerable nuisance\r\nwas permanently abated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1824.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of presidential candidates in 1824. Everybody now was\r\na Republican, and the choice, therefore, lay between the men of that\r\npolitical faith. The vote was as follows: Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee,\r\n99; John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, 84; Henry Clay, of Kentucky,\r\n37; William H. Crawford, of Georgia, 41. For Vice-President: John C.\r\nCalhoun, of South Carolina, 182; Nathan Sandford, of New York, 30;\r\nNathaniel Macon, of North Carolina, 24; Andrew Jackson, 13; Martin Van\r\nBuren, of New York, 9; Henry Clay, 2.\r\n\r\nThis vote showed that no candidate was elected, and the election,\r\ntherefore, was thrown into the House of Representatives. Although\r\nJackson was far in the lead on the popular and electoral vote, the\r\nfriends of Clay united with the supporters of Adams, who became\r\nPresident, with Calhoun Vice-President. The peculiar character of this\r\nelection led to its being called the \"scrub race for the presidency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, the sixth President, was born at Braintree,\r\nMassachusetts, July 11, 1767, and was the son of the second President.\r\nHe was given every educational advantage in his youth, and when eleven\r\nyears old accompanied his father to France and was placed in a school in\r\nParis. Two years later he entered the University of Leyden, afterward\r\nmade a tour through the principal countries of Europe, and, returning\r\nhome, entered the junior class at Harvard, from which he graduated in\r\n1788. Washington appreciated his ability, and made him minister to The\r\nHague and afterward to Portugal. When his father became President he\r\ntransferred him to Berlin. The Federalists elected him to the United\r\nStates Senate in 1803, and in 1809 he was appointed minister to Russia.\r\nHe negotiated important commercial treaties with Prussia, Sweden, and\r\nGreat Britain, and, it will be remembered, he was leading commissioner\r\nin the treaty of Ghent, which brought the War of 1812 to a close. He was\r\na man of remarkable attainments, but he possessed little magnetism or\r\nattractiveness of manner, and by his indifference failed to draw warm\r\nfriends and supporters around him. Adams was re-elected to Congress\r\nrepeatedly after serving out his term as President. He was seized with\r\napoplexy while on the point of rising from his desk in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and died February 23, 1848.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\n(1767-1848.) One term, 1825-1829.]\r\n\r\nThe country was highly prosperous during the presidency of the younger\r\nAdams. The public debt, to which the War of 1812 added $80,000,000,\r\nbegan to show a marked decrease, money was more plentiful, and most\r\nimportant of all was the introduction of the steam locomotive from\r\nEngland. Experiments had been made in that country for a score of years,\r\nbut it was not until 1829 that George Stephenson, the famous engineer,\r\nexhibited his \"Rocket,\" which ran at the rate of nearly twenty miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF THE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n\r\nThe first clumsy attempts on this side were made in 1827, when two short\r\nlines of rails were laid at Quincy, near Boston, but the cars were drawn\r\nby horses, and, when shortly after, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was\r\nchartered, the intention was to use the same motor. In 1829, a steam\r\nlocomotive was used on the Delaware and Hudson Canal Railroad, followed\r\nby a similar introduction on the Baltimore and Ohio Road. The first\r\nrailroad chartered expressly for steam was granted in South Carolina for\r\na line to run from Charleston to Hamburg. The first locomotive made by\r\nStephenson was brought across the ocean in 1831. The Americans set to\r\nwork to make their own engines, and were successful in 1833. It will be\r\nnoted that these events occurred after the administration of Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEROKEES IN GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nMost of the country east of the Mississippi was being rapidly settled.\r\nImmense areas of land were sold by the Indian tribes to the government\r\nand they removed west of the river. The Cherokees, however, refused to\r\nsell their lands in Georgia and Alabama. They were fully civilized, had\r\nschools, churches, and newspapers, and insisted on staying upon the\r\nlands that were clearly their own. Georgia was equally determined to\r\nforce them out of the State, and her government was so high-handed that\r\nPresident Adams interfered for their protection. The governor declared\r\nthat the Indians must leave, and he defied the national government to\r\nprevent him from driving them out. The situation of the Cherokees\r\nfinally became so uncomfortable that, in 1835, they sold their lands and\r\njoined the other tribes in the Indian Territory, west of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPRESSIVE OCCURRENCE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive incidents in our history occurred on the 4th\r\nof July, when John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died. It was just half a\r\ncentury after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, of which\r\nJefferson was the author and whose adoption Adams secured.\r\n\r\nAdams attained the greatest age of any of our Presidents, being nearly\r\nninety-one years old when he died. He retained the brightness of his\r\nmind, his death being due to the feebleness of old age. When he was\r\nasked if he knew the meaning of the joyous bells that were ringing\r\noutside, his wan face lighted up, and he replied: \"It is the 4th of\r\nJuly; God bless it!\" His last words, uttered a few minutes later:\r\n\"Jefferson still survives.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"JOHNNY BULL,\" OR NO. 1.\r\n\r\n(The first locomotive used.)]\r\n\r\nIt was a natural error on the part of Adams, but Jefferson had passed\r\naway several hours before, in his eighty-fourth year. He died quietly,\r\nsurrounded by friends, with his mind full of the inspiring associations\r\nconnected with the day. His last words were: \"I resign my soul to God,\r\nand my daughter to my country.\"\r\n\r\nAn important issue of the younger Adams' administration was the tariff.\r\nNaturally the South were opposed to a protective tariff, because they\r\nhad no manufactures, and were, therefore, compelled to pay higher prices\r\nfor goods than if admitted free of duty. A national convention was held\r\nat Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1827, to discuss the\r\nquestion of the protection of native industry. Only four of the\r\nslave-holding States were represented, but the members memorialized\r\nCongress for an increase of duties on a number of articles made in this\r\ncountry. In the session of 1827-28, Congress, in deference to the\r\ngeneral sentiment, passed a law which increased the duties on fabrics\r\nmade of wool, cotton, linen, and on articles made from lead, iron, etc.\r\nThe Legislatures of the Southern States protested against this action as\r\nunjust and unconstitutional, and in the presidential election of that\r\nyear the entire electoral vote of the South was cast against Adams.\r\n\r\nThe \"Era of good feeling\" was gone and politics became rampant. The\r\npolicy of a protective tariff became known as the American System, and\r\nHenry Clay was its foremost champion. Their followers began to call\r\nthemselves National Republicans, while their opponents soon assumed the\r\nname of Democrats, which has clung to them ever since, though the\r\nNational Republicans changed their title a few years later to Whigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1828.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1828 resulted as follows: Andrew Jackson,\r\nDemocrat, 178; John Quincy Adams, National Republican, 83.

He was born of Scotch-Irish parents, at Waxhaw Settlement, on the\r\nline between North and South Carolina, March 15, 1767. His parents were\r\nwretchedly poor and he received only a meagre education. His father died\r\njust before the birth of his son, who enlisted in the patriot army when\r\nbut thirteen years old, and was captured at the battle of Hanging Rock.\r\nWhen a British officer ordered the boy to clean his boots, he refused.\r\nHe was brutally beaten for his stubbornness; he told the officer that he\r\nmight kill him, but he could never make a servant of him.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward he was seized with smallpox and was abandoned to die,\r\nbut his mother secured his release and nursed him back to health. She\r\ndied soon afterward, and, while still a boy, Andrew was left without a\r\nsingle near relative. At the close of the Revolution, he took up the\r\nstudy of law, pursuing it in a desultory way, until his removal to\r\nNashville, at the age of twenty-one years. He threw his law books aside\r\nwhen the Indians began their outrages, and we have told of his striking\r\nservices as a soldier and military leader, culminating with his great\r\nvictory at New Orleans, the anniversary of which is still widely\r\ncelebrated. Jackson became the idol of his countrymen, and he possessed\r\nmany admirable qualities. Never, under any circumstances, did he betray\r\npersonal fear. He was ready to attack one man, ten men, a hundred, or a\r\nthousand, if he deemed it his duty to do so. He was honest to the core,\r\nintensely patriotic, and he either loved or hated a man. He would stand\r\nby a friend to the death, unless he became convinced of his\r\nunworthiness, when he instantly became his unrelenting enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(1767-1845.) Two terms, 1829-1837.]\r\n\r\nHe fought numerous duels, and stood up without a tremor in front of one\r\nof the most famous of duelists. When his opponent's bullet tore a\r\ndreadful wound in his breast, he resolutely repressed all evidence of\r\npain until he had killed his antagonist, in order that the latter should\r\nnot have the pleasure of knowing he had hurt Jackson.\r\n\r\nWhile carrying one arm in a sling from this wound, he led a strong force\r\ninto the Creek country. When the men were close upon starvation, they\r\nmutinied. Jackson rode in front of them, pistol in hand, and declared he\r\nwould shoot the first one who refused to obey his orders. Not a man\r\nrebelled. At the same time he divided all the food he had among them,\r\nwhich consisted solely of acorns. Nevertheless, he pressed on and\r\nutterly destroyed the Indian confederation.\r\n\r\nAdded to these fine qualities was his chivalrous devotion to his wife,\r\nthe unvarying respect he showed to the other sex, and the purity of his\r\nown character. Such a man cannot fail to exercise a powerful influence\r\nupon those with whom he comes in contact. In Jackson's estimation, the\r\nonly living person whose views were right upon every question was\r\nhimself. He was intolerant of opposition, and merciless in his enmity of\r\na personal opponent. He made mistakes, as was inevitable, and some of\r\nthem wrought great injury; but even his opponents respected while they\r\nfeared him, and the qualities which we have indicated gave him a warm\r\nplace not only in the affection of his own generation but in the\r\ngenerations that came after him.\r\n\r\nWhen his tempestuous career came to a close, Jackson retired to his\r\nhome, known as the Hermitage, in Tennessee, where he passed his\r\ndeclining years in quiet and peace. He became a devout Christian, and\r\ndied of consumption, June 8, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TO THE VICTORS BELONG THE SPOILS.\"\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that when Jackson became President he shared his\r\nauthority with no one. He made up his cabinet of his personal friends,\r\nand, on the principle of \"To the victors belong the spoils,\" that an\r\nadministration to be successful must be composed of those of the same\r\npolitical faith with its head, he began a system of removals from\r\noffice. The total number of such removals made by his predecessors was\r\nseventy-four, some of which were for cause. A year after his\r\ninauguration, Jackson had turned 2,000 office-holders out, and, since\r\ntheir successors were obliged in many instances to remove subordinates,\r\nin pursuance of the same policy, it will be seen that the President\r\nadopted no halfway measures.\r\n\r\nHe regarded the members of his cabinet as simply clerks, and, when he\r\nwished to consult with trusted friends, called together a certain number\r\nof boon associates, who became known as his \"Kitchen Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON'S FIGHT WITH THE UNITED STATES BANK.\r\n\r\nOne of the President's unbearable aversions was the United States Bank.\r\nHe believed that its strength had been exerted against him, and in his\r\nfirst message to Congress, in December, 1829, he charged that it had\r\nfailed to establish a uniform and sound currency and that its existence\r\nwas contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. Its charter would expire\r\nin 1836, and Congress passed an act renewing it for fifteen years.\r\nJackson vetoed the measure, and the two-thirds majority necessary to\r\npass it again could not be obtained.\r\n\r\nBy law the deposits of the bank were subject to the secretary of the\r\ntreasury, who could not remove them without giving Congress his reasons\r\nfor the step. Jackson ordered his secretary to remove the deposits, and\r\nwhen he very properly refused, the President removed him. He made Roger\r\nB. Taney, afterward chief justice of the United States, his new\r\nsecretary of the treasury, and that pliable official promptly\r\ntransferred the deposits to certain banks that had been selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1832.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fight caused much excitement, and the action of Jackson was\r\nbitterly denounced, it added to his popularity, as was proven in the\r\npresidential election of 1832, when the following electoral vote was\r\ncast: Andrew Jackson, 219; Henry Clay, of Kentucky, National Republican,\r\n49; John Floyd, of Georgia, Independent, 11; William Wirt, of Maryland,\r\nAnti-Masonic, 7. For Vice-President, Martin Van Buren, Democrat, of New\r\nYork, received 189 votes; John Sergeant, of Pennsylvania, National\r\nRepublican, 49; Henry Lee, of Massachusetts, Independent, 11; Amos\r\nEllmaker, of Pennsylvania, Anti-Masonic, 7; William Wilkins, of\r\nPennsylvania, Democrat, 30. On the popular vote, Jackson had more than a\r\nhundred thousand in excess of all the others in a total of one million\r\nand a quarter. It was a great triumph for \"Old Hickory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL HOUSTON.\r\n\r\nOne of \"Old Hickory's\" volunteers, afterward famous in the Texan War for\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\n(1793-1863).]\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens in the history of any country that the government\r\nfinds itself in the possession of more money than it wants. It became\r\nclear, however, that not only would the public debt soon be paid, but a\r\nsurplus would accrue. In view of this certainty, Henry Clay secured the\r\npassage of a bill in 1832, which reduced the tariff, except where such\r\nreduction came in conflict with home labor. Several years later, the\r\nsurplus, amounting to $28,000,000, was divided among the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HAWK WAR.\r\n\r\nIn the year named occurred the Black Hawk War. The tribes known as the\r\nSacs, Foxes, and Winnebagoes lived in the Territory of Wisconsin. The\r\nSacs and Foxes made a treaty with the United States in 1830, by which\r\nthey ceded all their lands in Illinois to the government. When the time\r\narrived for them to leave, they refused, and the governor called out a\r\nmilitary force to compel them to remove beyond the Mississippi. Black\r\nHawk, a famous chieftain of the Sacs, left, but returned at the head of\r\na thousand warriors, gathered from the tribes named, and began a savage\r\nattack upon the settlements. The peril was so grave that the government\r\nsent troops under Generals Scott and Atkinson to Rock Island. On the way\r\nthither, cholera, which had never before appeared in this country, broke\r\nout among the troops and raged so violently that operations for a time\r\nwere brought to a standstill.\r\n\r\nWhen Atkinson was able to do so, he pushed on, defeated the Indians, and\r\ncaptured Black Hawk. He was taken to Washington, where he had a long\r\ntalk with President Jackson, who gave him good advice, and induced him\r\nto sign a new treaty providing for the removal of his people to the\r\nIndian Territory. Then Black Hawk was carried on a tour through the\r\ncountry, and was so impressed by its greatness that, when he returned to\r\nhis people, he gave no more trouble. It is worth remembering that both\r\nJefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln served in the Black Hawk War.\r\n\r\n\r\nNULLIFICATION MEASURES IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina had long been soured over the tariff measures, which,\r\nwhile they helped the prosperity of other sections of the Union, were\r\noppressive to her, because there were no manufactures carried on within\r\nher borders. When Congress, in the spring of 1832, imposed additional\r\nduties, she was so angered that she called a convention in November, at\r\nwhich her governor presided. The new tariff was declared\r\nunconstitutional, and therefore null and void, and notice was given that\r\nany attempt to collect the duties would be resisted by South Carolina,\r\nwhich, unless her demands were granted, would withdraw from the Union\r\nand establish herself as an independent government. Other States\r\nendorsed her action and the situation became serious.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson hated the tariff as much as South Carolina, but his\r\nlove for the Union was unquenchable, and, having sworn to enforce the\r\nlaws, he was determined to do it in the face of any and all opposition.\r\nBecause Vice-President Calhoun sided with his native State, Jackson\r\nthreatened to arrest him. Calhoun resigned, went home, and was elected\r\nUnited States senator.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson issued a warning proclamation on the 10th of December,\r\nbut South Carolina continued her war preparations, and the President\r\nsent General Scott, with the sloop-of-war _Natchez_, to Charleston, with\r\norders to strengthen the garrison in the harbor. Scott displayed great\r\ndiscretion, and won the good-will of the citizens by his forbearance and\r\ncourtesy. The other Southern States condemned the rash course of South\r\nCarolina, within which gradually appeared quite a number of supporters\r\nof the Union. Then Clay introduced a bill in Congress, which became law,\r\nproviding for a gradual reduction of duties until the 30th of June,\r\n1842, when they were to reach a general level of twenty per cent.\r\nCalhoun, now a member of the Senate, supported the compromise, and the\r\nthreatened civil war passed away for the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SEMINOLE WAR.\r\n\r\nTrouble once more broke out with the Seminoles of Florida. The\r\naggravation, already referred to, continued. Runaway slaves found safe\r\nrefuge in the swamps of the State and intermarried with the Indians. A\r\ntreaty, known as that of Payne's Landing, was signed in May, 1832, by\r\nwhich a number of chiefs visited the country assigned to the Creeks, it\r\nbeing agreed that, if they found it satisfactory, the Seminoles should\r\nremove thither. They reported in its favor, but the other leaders,\r\nincensed at their action, killed several of them, and declared, probably\r\nwith truth, that they did not represent the sentiment of their people,\r\nand doubtless had been influenced by the whites to make their report.\r\nThe famous Osceola expressed his opinion of the treaty by driving his\r\nhunting-knife through it and the top of the table on which it lay.\r\n\r\nIt being clear that the Seminoles had no intention of going west,\r\nPresident Jackson sent General Wiley Thompson to Florida with a military\r\nforce to drive them out. The Indians secured a delay until the spring of\r\n1835, under the promise to leave at that time; but when the date\r\narrived, they refused to a man. Osceola was so defiant in an interview\r\nwith General Thompson that the latter put him in irons and held him\r\nprisoner for a couple of days. Then the chief promised to comply with\r\nthe terms of the treaty and was released. He had not the slightest\r\nintention, however, of keeping his promise, but was resolved to be\r\nrevenged upon Thompson for the indignity he had put upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1835, while Thompson and a party of friends\r\nwere dining near Fort King, with the windows raised, because of the\r\nmildness of the day, Osceola and a party of his warriors stole up and\r\nfired a volley through the windows, which killed Thompson and four of\r\nhis companions. Before the garrison of the fort could do anything, the\r\nSeminoles had fled.\r\n\r\n\r\nDADE'S MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nOn the same day of this tragical occurrence, Major Francis L. Dade set\r\nout with 140 mounted men to the relief of General Clinch, stationed at\r\nFort Drane, in the interior of Florida, where he was threatened with\r\nmassacre. Dade advanced from Fort Brooke at the head of Tampa Bay, and\r\nwas not far on the road when he was fired upon by the Indians from\r\nambush. Half the men were killed, including Major Dade. The remainder\r\nhastily fortified themselves, but were attacked in such overwhelming\r\nnumbers that every man was shot down. Two wounded soldiers crawled into\r\nthe woods, but afterward died. \"Dade's Massacre\" caused as profound a\r\nsensation throughout the country as did that of Custer and his command\r\nforty years later.\r\n\r\nThe Seminole War dragged on for years. General Scott commanded for a\r\ntime in 1836, and vigorously pressed a campaign in the autumn of that\r\nyear; but when he turned over the command, in the spring of 1837, to\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor, the conquest of the Seminoles seemingly was as\r\nfar off as ever. Taylor attempted to use a number of Cuban bloodhounds\r\nfor tracking the mongrels into the swamps, but the dogs refused to take\r\nthe trail of the red men, and the experiment (widely denounced in the\r\nNorth) was a failure.\r\n\r\nIn October, while Osceola and a number of warriors were holding a\r\nconference with General Jessup under the protection of a flag of truce,\r\nall were made prisoners, and Osceola was sent to Charleston, and died in\r\nFort Moultrie in 1838. The war dragged on until 1842, when General\r\nWorth, after it had cost $40,000,000 and many lives, brought it to an\r\nend by destroying the crops of the Seminoles and leaving to them the\r\nchoice between starvation and submission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCEOLA'S INDIGNATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMFORTS OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe steam locomotive, of which we have given a brief history, came into\r\ngeneral use during the presidency of General Jackson. When he left\r\noffice 1,500 miles of railway had been built, and many more were being\r\nlaid in different parts of the country. It wrought a social revolution\r\nby bringing all parts of the country into close communication, making\r\nsettlement easy and the cost of moving crops slight. Anthracite coal was\r\ntested in 1837, and, because of its great advantages, was soon widely\r\nused. McCormick's reaper was patented in 1834, and gave an enormous\r\nimpetus to the cultivation of western lands. In the early days fire was\r\nobtained by the use of flint and steel or the sun-glass. Friction\r\nmatches appeared in 1836, and quickly supplanted the clumsy method that\r\nhad been employed for centuries.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 16, 1835, New York City was visited by the most\r\ndestructive fire in its history. The weather was so cold that the\r\nvolunteer fire department could do little to check the conflagration,\r\nwhich destroyed 648 buildings, covering seventeen blocks and thirteen\r\nacres of ground. The value of the property lost was $20,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY IN 1830.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1830 was 12,866,020, and the\r\npostoffices, which in 1790 numbered only 75, had grown to 8,450. The\r\nsales of the western lands had increased from $100,000 to $25,000,000 a\r\nyear, a fact which explains the rapid extinguishment of the public debt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN RAILROAD IN EARLIER DAYS.]\r\n\r\nTwo States were admitted to the Union, Arkansas in 1836 and Michigan in\r\n1837. The former was a part of the Louisiana purchase, and was\r\noriginally settled by the French at Arkansas Post, in 1635. Michigan was\r\nthe fourth State formed from the Northwest Territory, and was first\r\nsettled by the French at Detroit in 1701.\r\n\r\nAbolitionism assumed definite form in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison,\r\nin his Boston paper, _The Liberator_, demanded the immediate abolition\r\nof slavery. Anti-slavery societies were organized in different parts of\r\nthe country and the members became known as abolitionists. The South was\r\nincensed by the agitation, which reached its culmination in the great\r\nCivil War of 1861-65.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE AND PORTUGAL FORCED TO TERMS.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson impressed his personality upon everything with which\r\nhe came in contact. We had been pressing a suit against France for the\r\ninjuries she inflicted upon our commerce during the flurry of 1798, but\r\nthat country was so laggard in paying that the President recommended to\r\nCongress that enough French vessels should be captured to pay the bill.\r\nFrance flared up and threatened war unless Jackson apologized. A dozen\r\nwars would not have moved him to recall his words. England, however,\r\nmediated, and France paid the debt. Portugal took the hint and lost no\r\ntime in settling a similar account with us.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson, imitating Washington, issued a farewell address to\r\nhis countrymen. It was well written and patriotic; but his last official\r\nact, which was characteristic of him, displeased many of his friends.\r\nThe speculation in western lands had assumed such proportions that the\r\ntreasury department, in July, 1836, sent out a circular ordering the\r\ncollectors of the public revenues to receive only gold and silver in\r\npayment. This circular caused so much confusion and trouble that, at the\r\nbeginning of 1837, Congress modified it so that it would have given\r\ngreat relief. Jackson held the bill in his possession until the\r\nadjournment of Congress, and thus prevented its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nThe stormy years of Jackson's presidency brought into prominence three\r\nof the greatest of Americans. All, at different times, were members of\r\nthe United States Senate, where their genius overshadowed those who\r\nunder other circumstances would have attracted national attention. These\r\nmen were John Caldwell Calhoun, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN C. CALHOUN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN C. CALHOUN. (1782-1850).]\r\n\r\nThe first named was born near Abbeville, South Carolina, March 18, 1782,\r\nand, graduating at Yale, studied law and early developed fine qualities\r\nof statesmanship. He was elected to the House of Representatives in\r\n1811, and became at once the leader of the younger element of the\r\nDemocratic party. He was a vehement advocate of the war with Great\r\nBritain, and, in 1817, was appointed secretary of war under Monroe,\r\nserving to the close of his presidency. It has been shown that he was\r\nelected Vice-President with Adams. Elected again with Jackson, the two\r\nbecame uncompromising opponents, and he resigned in 1832, immediately\r\nentering the Senate, where he was accepted as the leader of the \"State\r\nrights\" men.\r\n\r\nHis services as senator were interrupted for a short time when, in\r\n1844-45, he acted as secretary of State in Tyler's administration. He\r\nwas determined to secure the admission of Texas and by his vigor did so,\r\nin the face of a strong opposition in the North. He re-entered the\r\nSenate and resumed his leadership of the extreme southern wing of the\r\nDemocratic party. He died in Washington, March 31, 1850, while Clay's\r\ncompromise measures were pending.\r\n\r\nCalhoun ranks among the foremost of American statesmen, and as the\r\nchampion of the South his place is far above any who appeared before or\r\nwho have come after him. As a speaker, he was logical, clear, and always\r\ndeeply in earnest. Daniel Webster said of him: \"He had the indisputable\r\nbasis of all high character--unspotted integrity and honor unimpeached.\r\nNothing groveling, low, or meanly selfish came near his head or his\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY CLAY. (1777-1852).]\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was born April 12, 1777, in the \"Slashes,\" Virginia. He\r\nstudied law, and at the age of twenty removed to Kentucky, which is\r\nproud to claim the honor of having been his home and in reality his\r\nState. His great ability and winning manners made him popular\r\neverywhere. He served in the Kentucky Legislature, and, before he was\r\nthirty years old, was elected to the United States Senate, of which he\r\nwas a member from 1806 to 1807. He soon became recognized as the\r\nforemost champion of the cause of internal improvements and of the\r\ntariff measures, known as the \"American System.\" His speakership of the\r\nKentucky Assembly, his term as United States senator again, 1809-11, and\r\nas a member of the House of Representatives in 1811, followed rapidly.\r\nAgainst precedent, being a newcomer, he was chosen Speaker, and served\r\nuntil his resignation in 1814. He was as strenuous an advocate of the\r\nwar with Great Britain as Calhoun, and it has been stated that he was\r\none of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty of Ghent in 1814. The\r\nfollowing year he was again elected to the House of Representatives, and\r\nacted without a break as Speaker until 1821. He was the most powerful\r\nadvocate of the recognition of the Spanish-American States in revolt,\r\nand but for Clay the Missouri Compromise would not have been prepared\r\nand adopted.\r\n\r\nAbsent but a brief time from Congress, he again acted as Speaker in\r\n1823-25. President Adams appointed him his secretary of State, and he\r\nretired from office in 1829, but two years later entered the Senate from\r\nKentucky. For the following twenty years he was the leader of the Whig\r\nparty, opposed Jackson in the bank controversy, and secured the tariff\r\ncompromise of 1833 and the settlement with France in 1835. He retired\r\nfrom the Senate in 1843, his nomination for the presidency following a\r\nyear later. Once more he entered the Senate, in 1849, and brought about\r\nthe great compromise of 1850. He died June 29, 1852.\r\n\r\nClay's vain struggle for the presidency is told in the succeeding\r\nchapter. It seems strange that while he was indisputably the most\r\npopular man in the United States, he was not able to secure the great\r\nprize. The American Congress never knew a more brilliant debater, nor\r\ndid the public ever listen to a more magnetic orator. His various\r\ncompromise measures in the interest of the Union were beyond the\r\nattainment of any other man. His fame rests above that which any office\r\ncan confer. His friends idolized and his opponents respected him. A\r\nstrong political enemy once refused an introduction to him on the ground\r\nthat he could not withstand the magnetism of a personal acquaintance\r\nwhich had won \"other good haters\" to his side. John C. Breckinridge, his\r\npolitical adversary, in his funeral oration, said: \"If I were to write\r\nhis epitaph, I would inscribe as the highest eulogy on the stone which\r\nshall mark his resting-place, 'Here lies a man who was in the public\r\nservice for fifty years and never attempted to deceive his countrymen.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL WEBSTER. (1782-1852).]\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster was born January 18, 1782, at Salisbury, New Hampshire,\r\nand died October 24, 1852. He was educated at Exeter Academy and\r\ngraduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. After teaching school a short\r\ntime in Maine, he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1805, and\r\nbegan practice at Boscawen, in his native State. Two years afterward, he\r\nremoved to Portsmouth, where he speedily became a leader at the bar and\r\nserved in Congress from 1813 to 1817. At that time he was a moderate\r\nFederalist. He settled in Boston in 1818, and assumed a front rank among\r\nlawyers by his argument before the United States Supreme Court in the\r\ncelebrated \"Dartmouth College Case,\" which involved the obligation of\r\ncontracts and the powers of the national government. He was congressman\r\nfrom Massachusetts from 1823 to 1827, was chairman of the judiciary\r\ncommittee, and attracted great attention by his speeches on Greece, then\r\nstruggling for independence, and his pleas in favor of free trade.\r\n\r\nWebster's fame as an eloquent orator was already established. As such,\r\nhe was the greatest that America ever produced, and many claim that he\r\nsurpassed any who spoke the English tongue. Among his masterpieces were\r\nhis speeches at Plymouth, 1820, on the bi-centennial; at the laying of\r\nthe corner-stone of the Bunker Hill monument, 1825; and his eulogy on\r\nAdams and Jefferson, 1826.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the United States Senate in 1827, he immediately took\r\nrank beside the giants, Calhoun and Clay. He was an advocate of the\r\nprotective tariff of 1823, and in 1830 reached the highest point of\r\nthrilling and eloquent logic in his reply to Robert Young Hayne, of\r\nSouth Carolina, who asserted that any State had the right to disobey\r\nsuch laws of Congress as she deemed unconstitutional. Webster's speech\r\nis a classic, never surpassed in its way, and the debate won for him the\r\nproud title of \"Expounder of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally Webster opposed nullification, and he and Calhoun had many\r\nearnest contests worthy of two such masters of logic. W.H. Harrison\r\nappointed him his secretary of State, and he remained with Tyler until\r\n1843. In 1845, he was again sent to the United States Senate, but in\r\n1850 he alienated many of his former supporters by his speech in favor\r\nof Clay's compromise measures, He was secretary of State in 1850-52, and\r\nhis death called out more addresses and testimonials than any other\r\nsince that of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1836.\r\n\r\nThe following was the electoral vote cast in 1836: Martin Van Buren, of\r\nNew York, Democrat, 170; William Henry Harrison, of Ohio, Whig, 73; Hugh\r\nL. White, of Tennessee, Whig, 26; Daniel Webster, of Massachusetts,\r\nWhig, 14; Willie P. Mangum, of North Carolina, Whig, 11. For\r\nVice-President, Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, Democrat, 147; Francis\r\nGranger, of New York, Whig, 77; John Tyler, of Virginia, Whig, 47;\r\nWilliam Smith, of Alabama, Democrat, 23. The vote for Johnson as\r\nVice-President was not sufficient to elect him, but he was chosen by the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren, eighth President, was born December 5, 1782, at\r\nKinderhook, N.Y., and died July 24, 1862. He became eminent as a lawyer,\r\nand his skill as a Democratic politician caused him to be known as the\r\n\"Little Magician.\" He held a number of public offices, being State\r\nsenator, United States senator, 1821-28; governor of New York, 1828-29;\r\nand secretary of State under Jackson, 1829-31, when Jackson appointed\r\nhim minister to England, but his political opponents secured his defeat\r\nin the Senate. Becoming Vice-President under Jackson, he presided in the\r\nSenate from 1833 to 1837. Jackson was so pleased with Van Buren that he\r\nchose him as his successor. He was the Free Soil candidate for the\r\npresidency in 1848, and thereby brought about the defeat of Cass by\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Van Buren was one of the most unpopular we have\r\never had, and through no fault of his. A great deal of the prosperity of\r\nJackson's term was superficial. He had been despotic, as shown in his\r\nremoval of the United States Bank deposits and the issue of the specie\r\ncircular of 1836. Confusion ensued in business, and an era of wild\r\nspeculation followed a distribution of the surplus in the treasury among\r\nthe States. The credit system took the place of the cash system, banks\r\nsprang up like mushrooms, and an immense amount of irredeemable money\r\nwas put in circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n(1782-1862.) One term, 1837-1841.]\r\n\r\nThese institutions were known as \"wild-cat banks,\" and their method of\r\ndefrauding the public was as follows: They bought several hundred\r\nthousands of cheap bills which, having cost them practically nothing,\r\nthey used in offering higher prices for public lands than others could\r\npay in gold and silver. They trusted to chance that their bills would\r\nnot soon come back for redemption, but if they did so, the banks\r\n\"failed\" and the holders of the notes lost every dollar.\r\n\r\nThe fraud was a deliberate one, but the establishment of the national\r\nbanking law since then renders a repetition of the swindle impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PANIC OF 1837.\r\n\r\nVan Buren was hardly inaugurated when the panic of 1837 burst upon the\r\ncountry. The banks were forced to suspend specie payment, many failed,\r\nand mercantile houses that had weathered other financial storms toppled\r\nover like tenpins. In two months the failures in New York and New\r\nOrleans amounted to $150,000,000. Early in May, a deputation of New York\r\nmerchants and bankers called upon the President and asked him to put off\r\nthe collection of duties on imported goods, to rescind the specie\r\ncircular, and convene Congress in the hope of devising measures for\r\nrelief. All that the President consented to do was to defer the\r\ncollection of duties. Immediately the banks in New York suspended specie\r\npayments, and their example was followed by others throughout the\r\ncountry. The New York Legislature then authorized the suspension of\r\nspecie payments for a year. This left the national government without\r\nthe means of paying its own obligations (since no banks would return its\r\ndeposits in specie) except by using the third installment of the surplus\r\nrevenue that had been promised to the States.\r\n\r\nThe country was threatened with financial ruin, and Congress convened in\r\nSeptember. The President in his message proposed the establishment of an\r\nindependent treasury for the custody of the public funds, and their\r\ntotal separation from banking institutions. Such a bill failed, but it\r\nbecame a law in 1840. Congress, however, obtained temporary relief by\r\nauthorizing the issue of $10,000,000 in treasury notes.\r\n\r\nThe fact remained, however, that the country was rich, and though much\r\ndistress prevailed, the financial stress began to lessen as more healthy\r\nmethods of business were adopted. In 1838 most of the banks resumed\r\nspecie payments, but the effect of the panic was felt for years. Since\r\nthe distress occurred while Van Buren was President, the blame was\r\nplaced by many upon the administration.\r\n\r\nAt that time the present Dominion of Canada was divided into two\r\nprovinces, known as Upper and Lower Canada. Dissatisfaction with some of\r\nthe features of Great Britain's rule caused a rebellion in Lower Canada\r\nin 1837. Much sympathy was felt for them in this country, and especially\r\nin New York, from which a force of 700 men seized and fortified Navy\r\nIsland, in Niagara River. There were plenty of loyalists in Canada, who\r\nmade an attempt to capture the place, but failed. On the night of\r\nDecember 29, 1837, they impetuously attacked the supply steamer\r\n_Caroline_, killed twelve of the defenders, set the boat on fire, and\r\nsent it over Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren issued a proclamation forbidding all interference in\r\nthe affairs of Canada, and General Wool was sent to the frontier with a\r\nmilitary force strong enough to compel obedience. He obliged the\r\ninsurgents on Navy Island to surrender and pledge themselves to refrain\r\nfrom all unlawful acts. These vigorous measures soon brought quiet to\r\nthe border, and England's wise policy toward the disaffected provinces\r\nhas made Canada one of her most loyal provinces.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1840 was 17,649,453, further\r\nevidence of the real prosperity of the country. Railroad building went\r\non vigorously, there being fully 4,000 miles in operation at the close\r\nof Van Buren's term.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1840.\r\n\r\nThe following was the presidential vote of 1840: William Henry Harrison,\r\nof Ohio, Whig, 234; Martin Van Buren, 70. For Vice-President, John\r\nTyler, 234; E.M. Johnson, 48; L.W. Tazewell, of Virginia, Democrat, 11;\r\nJames K. Polk, of Tennessee, Democrat, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY HARRISON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. (1773-1841.) One month, 1841.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison, ninth President, was born February 9, 1773, in\r\nVirginia, and was the son of Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and afterward governor of Virginia. The son\r\ngraduated from Hampden-Sidney College, and took up the study of\r\nmedicine, but was fond of military matters, and, entering the army of\r\nSt. Clair, he displayed great bravery and skill. He helped General Wayne\r\nwin his victory over the Indians in 1794, and was rapidly promoted. He\r\nbecame secretary of the Northwest Territory in 1798, and the following\r\nyear was made delegate to Congress. In 1800, he was appointed governor\r\nof Indiana Territory, and was acting as such when he won his decisive\r\nvictory at Tippecanoe, in the autumn of 1811. An account has been given\r\nof his brilliant services in the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nHe attained the rank of major-general in the regular army, but resigned\r\nin 1814. He was congressman from 1816 to 1819, United States senator\r\nfrom 1825 to 1828, and United States minister to the United States of\r\nColumbia, 1828-29.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison wore no hat or overcoat while delivering his\r\ninaugural. Although accustomed to the hardships of the frontier, and\r\nnaturally one of the most rugged of men, he was now old and weak in\r\nbody. His imprudence, added to the annoyance from the clamorous\r\noffice-seekers, drove him frantic. He succumbed to pneumonia and died on\r\nthe 4th of April, just one month after his inauguration. He was the\r\nfirst President to die in office, and an immense concourse attended his\r\nfuneral, his remains being interred near North Bend, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nAs provided by the Constitution, the Vice-President, John Tyler, was\r\nimmediately sworn into office as his successor. Like many of his\r\npredecessors, John Tyler was a native of Virginia, where he was born\r\nMarch 29, 1790. He possessed great natural ability and was a practicing\r\nlawyer at the age of nineteen, and a member of the State Legislature at\r\ntwenty-one. When thirty-five, he was chosen governor of Virginia, and\r\nwas a United States senator from 1827 to 1836.\r\n\r\nSince he was the first President not elected to the office, there was\r\nconsiderable discussion among the politicians as to his precise\r\n_status_. It was contended by some that he was chief executive \"in\r\ntrust,\" and was therefore bound to carry out the policy of his immediate\r\npredecessor. Tyler insisted that he was as much the President, in every\r\nrespect, as if he had been elected by the people to that office, and in\r\nthis insistence he was unquestionably right.\r\n\r\nTyler quickly involved himself in trouble with the Whigs. They passed an\r\nact to re-establish the United States Bank, whose charter expired in\r\n1836, though it had continued in operation under the authority of the\r\nState of Pennsylvania. President Tyler vetoed the bill. He suggested\r\nsome modifications, and it was passed again, but to the indignant\r\namazement of his party he vetoed it a second time. He was declared a\r\ntraitor and widely denounced. All his cabinet resigned, with the\r\nexception of Daniel Webster, who, as stated elsewhere, remained until\r\n1843, in order to complete an important treaty with England then under\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEBSTER-ASHBURTON TREATY.\r\n\r\nThis was known as the Webster-Ashburton Treaty. Our northeastern\r\nboundary was loosely defined by the treaty of 1783, and it was finally\r\nagreed by Great Britain and the United States to refer the questions in\r\ndispute to three commissions to be jointly constituted by the two\r\ncountries. The first of these awarded the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay\r\nto the United States; the third established the boundary line from the\r\nintersection of the forty-fifth parallel with the St. Lawrence to the\r\nwestern point of Lake Huron. It remained for the second commission to\r\ndetermine the boundary from the Atlantic to the St. Lawrence. The\r\nquestion was a bone of contention for many years, and at last was\r\nreferred to Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton. These two gentlemen met\r\nin a spirit of fairness, calmly discussed the matter, and without the\r\nslightest friction reached an agreement, which was signed August 9,\r\n1842, and confirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR IN RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nRhode Island had been governed down to 1842 by the charter received from\r\nCharles II., in 1663. This charter permitted only the owners of a\r\ncertain amount of property to vote. Dissatisfaction gradually grew until\r\n1842, when two political parties were formed in the little State, one\r\nfavoring a new constitution and the other clinging to the old. The\r\nformer carried the Legislature, after adopting a State constitution, and\r\nelected Thomas W. Dorr governor. Their opponents elected Samuel W. King,\r\nand both placed armed forces in the field. When civil war was imminent,\r\nthe national government interfered and Dorr's forces were dispersed\r\nwithout bloodshed. Dorr was arrested, and on his trial found guilty of\r\ntreason. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, but offered liberty\r\non condition of taking the oath of allegiance. He refused, and, in June,\r\n1845, was unconditionally released. Meanwhile, the general\r\ndissatisfaction with the colonial charter led to the calling of a\r\nconvention, which adopted a new constitution, that went into effect in\r\nMay, 1843.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN TYLER. (1790-1862.) One partial term, 1841-1845.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-RENT WAR IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that when the Dutch were the owners of New York State\r\nmany of them took possession of immense tracts of lands, over which they\r\nruled like the feudal lords in ancient England. These grants and\r\nprivileges were inherited by their descendants and were not affected by\r\nthe Revolution. Among the wealthiest patroons were the Van Rensselaers,\r\nwhose estates included most of Albany and Rensselaer Counties. Stephen\r\nVan Rensselaer was easy-going and so wealthy that he did not take the\r\ntrouble to collect the rents due from his numerous tenants, who, at his\r\ndeath, in 1840, owed him nearly a quarter of a million of dollars. His\r\nheirs determined to collect this amount and set vigorous measures on\r\nfoot to do so. The tenants resisted, furious fights took place, and the\r\nmilitary were called out, but the tenants remained resolute in refusing\r\nto pay rent. The disturbances continued and were known as \"The Anti-Rent\r\nWar.\" The eastern towns of Rensselaer County and the Livingston manor of\r\nColumbia County were soon in a state of insurrection, and many outrages\r\nwere committed. In Delaware County, while a deputy-sheriff was trying to\r\nperform his duty he was killed. The civil authorities were powerless to\r\nsuppress the revolt, and, in 1846, the governor declared the County of\r\nDelaware in a state of insurrection, and called out the military. They\r\narrested the ringleaders, and the murderers of the deputy-sheriff were\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for life. Conciliatory measures followed, most\r\nof the patroon lands were sold to the tenants, and the great estates\r\ngradually passed out of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHOCKING ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\nA shocking accident occurred on the 28th of February, 1844. Mr. Upshur,\r\nsecretary of State, Mr. Gilmer, secretary of the navy, and a number of\r\ndistinguished ladies and gentlemen were taken on an excursion down the\r\nPotomac, by Commodore Stockton, on the steamer _Princeton_. For the\r\nentertainment of his guests, the commodore ordered the firing of an\r\nimmense new gun that had been placed on board a short time before. It\r\nhad been discharged several times, and, upon what was intended and\r\nindeed proved to be the last discharge, it exploded, killing Mr. Upshur,\r\nMr. Gilmer, Commodore Kennon, Virgil Maxey, lately minister to The\r\nHague, and several of the visitors, besides wounding seventeen sailors,\r\nsome of whom died. Although Commodore Stockton lived many years\r\nafterward, he never fully recovered from the shock. The accident cast a\r\ngloom throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF FLORIDA.\r\n\r\nOne State, Florida, was admitted to the Union during Tyler's\r\nadministration. Its early history has been given, it having been bought\r\nfrom Spain in 1819. It was made a State in 1845.\r\n\r\nTexas now became a subject of national interest. Although the United\r\nStates made claim to it as a part of the Louisiana purchase, the claim\r\nwas abandoned in 1819, when Florida came into our possession. In 1821, a\r\ncolony of Americans formed a settlement in Mexican territory, encouraged\r\nto do so by the home government. Others emigrated thither, among whom\r\nwere many restless adventurers and desperate men. By-and-by they began\r\ntalking of wresting Texas from Mexico and transferring it to the United\r\nStates. There is little doubt that in this design they received\r\nencouragement from many men holding high places in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEXAS REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThe ferment in Texas increased, and, on the 2d of March, 1836, a\r\nconvention declared Texas independent. Santa Anna, president of the\r\nMexican Republic, crossed the Rio Grande with a large force and advanced\r\nto San Antonio, where less than 200 Texans had taken refuge in a\r\nmission-house known as the Alamo, with their flag, consisting of a\r\nsingle star, floating defiantly above it. In this body of fearless men\r\nwere the eccentric Davy Crockett, formerly congressman from Tennessee;\r\nthe Bowie brothers, one of whom was the inventor of the Bowie knife;\r\nColonel Travis, and others as dauntless as they. They had several rifles\r\napiece, and maintained a spirited defense, night and day, for ten days,\r\nunder the incessant attacks of the Mexicans. Finally, when the brave\r\nband was reduced to less than a dozen, they surrendered under the\r\npromise that their lives would be spared. Santa Anna caused the massacre\r\nof every one.\r\n\r\n\"Remember the Alamo!\" became the war-cry of the Texans, and, in the\r\nfollowing month, under the command of Sam Houston, they virtually\r\ndestroyed the Mexican army and took Santa Anna prisoner. Houston was\r\nmore merciful to him than he had been to the Alamo prisoners, and\r\nprotected him from the vengeance of the soldiers. He was very glad to\r\nsign a treaty acknowledging the independence of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican government, however, repudiated the action of its president,\r\nand a guerrilla warfare was waged by both sides for several years\r\nwithout any progress being made in the conquest of the province. Texas\r\norganized itself into an independent republic, elected Sam Houston\r\npresident, and secured recognition from the United States, England, and\r\nseveral European governments. While making no organized effort to\r\nconquer Texas, Mexico insisted that the province was her own.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF TEXAS.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps of Texas, after declaring her independence, was\r\nto apply for admission into the Union. There was great opposition in the\r\nNorth because its admission would add an enormous slave area to our\r\ncountry. For the same reason the South clamored that it should be made\r\na State. Calhoun, who succeeded Upshur as secretary of State, in March,\r\n1844, put forth every effort to bring Texas into the Union. Clay's\r\nopposition lost him the support of the South in his presidential\r\naspirations. President Tyler, who favored its admission, made an\r\nannexation treaty with Texas, but the Senate refused to ratify it. Then\r\na joint resolution was introduced, and, after a hot discussion, was\r\npassed with the proviso that the incoming President might act, if he\r\npreferred, by treaty. The resolution was adopted March 1, 1845, by the\r\nSenate, three days before the close of President Tyler's term. Calhoun\r\ninstantly dispatched a messenger to Texas with orders to travel with the\r\nutmost haste that the new State might be brought in under the\r\nresolution. President Tyler immediately signed the bill, and the\r\n\"Lone-Star\" State became a member of the Union. On the last day but one\r\nof the close of his term he signed the bills for the admission of\r\nFlorida and Iowa, but the latter was not formally admitted until the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COPPER MINES OF MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\nThere were many events of a non-political nature, but of the highest\r\nimportance, that occurred during Tyler's administration. Copper took its\r\nplace as one of the great mineral productions of the United States in\r\n1844. The Indians at last abandoned their claims to the country near\r\nLake Superior, in northern Michigan, and the explorations that followed\r\nproved that the copper mines there are the richest in the world.\r\nNumerous companies were formed and copper-mining became the leading\r\nindustry of that section. An interesting discovery was that many of the\r\nmines had been worked hundreds of years before by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful richness of the gold deposits in California, the vast\r\nmineral resources of Missouri and Tennessee, and the untold wealth of\r\nthe petroleum bed under the surface of Pennsylvania were unsuspected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OF 1844.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1844 hinged on the question of the proposed\r\nannexation of Texas. It has been stated that the Whigs nominated Henry\r\nClay, who opposed annexation. Van Buren lost the Democratic renomination\r\nthrough his opposition to annexation, and the Southern Democrats secured\r\nthe candidacy of James K. Polk. The Abolitionists did not think Clay's\r\nopposition to annexation quite as earnest as it should be, and they\r\nplaced William Birney in nomination. As a result Clay lost the State of\r\nNew York, and through that his election to the presidency. The electoral\r\nvote was as follows:\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk, of Tennessee, Democrat, 170; Henry Clay, of Kentucky,\r\nWhig, 105. For Vice-President, George M. Dallas, of Pennsylvania,\r\nDemocrat, 170; Theodore Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, Whig, 105. This\r\nsecured the election of Polk and Dallas. James G. Birney and Thomas\r\nMorris, candidates of the Liberty party for President and\r\nVice-President, received no electoral vote, but, as stated, caused the\r\nloss of the State of New York to Clay, thereby throwing enough electoral\r\nvotes to Polk and Dallas to give them success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThe convention which placed Polk in nomination was held in the city of\r\nBaltimore. A railway train was waiting to carry the news to Washington,\r\nand, as soon as the passengers could hurry on board, it steamed at the\r\nhighest speed to the national capital. When the people left the cars an\r\nhour later they found, to their inexpressible amazement, newspaper\r\nextras for sale containing the news of Polk's nomination. In answer to\r\ntheir questions they were told that it had been received from Baltimore\r\nby TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOP IN WHICH THE FIRST MORSE INSTRUMENT WAS CONSTRUCTED\r\nFOR EXHIBITION BEFORE CONGRESS.]\r\n\r\nThis was on the 29th of May, 1844, and was the first public message sent\r\nby magnetic telegraph. It marked an era in the history of civilization.\r\n\r\nInvestigation seems to establish that Professor Joseph Henry, of the\r\nSmithsonian Institute, was the real inventor of the electro-magnetic\r\ntelegraph, though that honor has been given and will continue to be\r\ngiven by most people to Professor Samuel F.B. Morse, whose relation to\r\nthe telegraph was much the same as that of Fulton to the steamboat. He\r\nadded to the ideas of those before him and first brought them into\r\npractical use.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morse deserves all the credit he has received as one of the\r\ngreatest of inventors. He studied painting when young and became an\r\nartist of considerable skill. As early as 1832 he conceived the idea of\r\nan electro-magnetic telegraph and began his experiments. The project\r\nabsorbed all his energies until he became what is called in these days a\r\n\"crank,\" which is often the name of one who gives all his thoughts and\r\nefforts to the development of a single project. He drifted away from his\r\nrelatives, who looked upon him as a visionary dreamer, and when his\r\nragged clothes and craving stomach demanded attention, he gave\r\ninstruction in drawing to a few students who clung to him.\r\n\r\nLight gradually dawned upon Morse, and he continued his labors under\r\ndiscouragements that would have overcome almost any other man. He\r\nsecured help from Alfred Vail, of Morristown, N.J., who invented the\r\nalphabetical characters and many essential features of the system,\r\nbesides furnishing Morse with funds, without which his labors would have\r\ncome to a standstill. There was not enough capital at command to\r\nconstruct a line of telegraph, and Morse and his few friends haunted\r\nCongress with their plea for an appropriation. Ezra Cornell, founder of\r\nCornell University, gave assistance, and, finally, in the very closing\r\ndays of the session of Congress in 1844, an appropriation of $30,000 was\r\nmade to defray the expenses of a line between Baltimore and Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPEEDWELL IRON WORKS, MORRISTOWN, N.J.\r\n\r\nHere was forged the shaft for the Savannah, the first steamship which\r\ncrossed the Atlantic. Here was manufactured the tires, axles and cranks\r\nof the first American locomotive. Shop in which Vail and Baxter\r\nconstructed the first telegraph apparatus, invented by Morse, for\r\nexhibition before Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe invention, like most others of an important nature, was subjected to\r\nmerciless ridicule. A wag hung a pair of muddy boots out of a window in\r\nWashington, with a placard announcing that they belonged to a man who\r\nhad just arrived by telegraph; another placed a package on the wires,\r\nand called to his friends to see it whisked away by lightning; while\r\nmany opposed the apparent experimenting with the electric fluid, which\r\nthey believed would work all sorts of mischief. Nevertheless, the\r\npatient toilers kept at work, often stopped by accident, and in the face\r\nof all manner of opposition. The first line was laid underground, and,\r\nas has been shown, carried the news of Polk's nomination for the\r\npresidency to Washington.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morse was in Washington, and the first message was dictated by\r\nAnnie Ellsworth, March 28, 1844, and received by Alfred Vail, forty\r\nmiles away in Baltimore. It consisted of the words, \"What hath God\r\nwrought?\" and the telegram is now in the possession of the Connecticut\r\nHistorical Society. It may be said that since then the earth has been\r\ngirdled by telegraph lines, numbers of which pass under the ocean,\r\nuniting all nations and the uttermost extremities of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have done little more than give the results of\r\nthe various presidential campaigns. The two leading political parties\r\nwere the Whigs and the Democrats, and many of the elections were of\r\nabsorbing interest, not only to the participants, but to the country at\r\nlarge. Several were distinguished by features worthy of permanent\r\nrecord, since they throw valuable light upon the times, now forgotten,\r\nand were attended in many instances by far-reaching results.\r\n\r\nIt seems proper, therefore, that a chapter should be devoted to the most\r\nimportant presidential campaigns preceding and including one of the most\r\nmemorable--that of 1840--often referred to as the \"hard cider\r\ncampaign.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPAIGN SPEECHMAKING IN EARLIER DAYS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD GATES AT ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFAMOUS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS PREVIOUS TO 1840.\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the \"Caucus\"--The Election of 1792--The First Stormy\r\nElection--The Constitution Amended--Improvement of the Method of\r\nNominating Presidential Candidates--The First Presidential\r\nConvention--Convention in Baltimore in 1832--Exciting Scenes--The\r\nPresidential Campaign of 1820--\"Old Hickory\"--Andrew Jackson's\r\nPopularity--Jackson Nominated--\"Old Hickory\" Defeated--The \"Log-Cabin\"\r\nand \"Hard-Cider\" Campaign of 1840--\"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\"--Peculiar\r\nFeature of the Harrison Campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential nominating convention is a modern institution. In the\r\nearly days of the Republic a very different method was pursued in order\r\nto place the candidates for the highest office in the land before the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE \"CAUCUS.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as to the origin of the \"caucus.\" In the early part\r\nof the eighteenth century a number of caulkers connected with the\r\nshipping business in the North End of Boston held a meeting for\r\nconsultation. That meeting was the germ of the political caucuses which\r\nhave formed so prominent a feature of our government ever since its\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of our country was framed and signed in the month of\r\nSeptember, 1787, by the convention sitting in Philadelphia, and then\r\nsent to the various Legislatures for their action. It could not become\r\nbinding until ratified by nine States. On the 2d of July, 1788, Congress\r\nwas notified that the necessary nine States had approved, and on the\r\n13th of the following September a day was appointed for the choice of\r\nelectors for President. The day selected was the first Wednesday of\r\nJanuary, 1789. The date for the beginning of proceedings under the new\r\nConstitution was postponed to the first Wednesday in March, which\r\nhappened to fall on the 4th. In that way the 4th of March became fixed\r\nas the date of the inauguration of each President, except when the date\r\nis on Sunday, when it becomes the 5th.\r\n\r\nCongress met at that time in the city of New York. It was not until the\r\n1st of April that a quorum for business appeared in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the Senate was organized on the 6th of that month.\r\nThe electors who were to choose the President were selected by the\r\nvarious State Legislatures, each elector being entitled to cast two\r\nvotes. The rule was that the candidate receiving the highest number\r\nbecame President, while the next highest vote elected the\r\nVice-President. The objection to this method was that the two might\r\nbelong to different political parties, which very condition of things\r\ncame about at the election of the second President, when John Adams was\r\nchosen to the highest office and Thomas Jefferson to the second. The\r\nformer was a Federalist, while Jefferson was a Republican, or, as he\r\nwould have been called later, a Democrat. Had Adams died while in\r\noffice, the policy of his administration would have been changed.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt as to the first choice. While Washington lived\r\nand was willing thus to serve his country, what other name could be\r\nconsidered? So, when the electoral vote was counted on the 6th of April,\r\n1789, every vote of the ten States which took part in the election was\r\ncast for him. He received 69 (all); John Adams, 34; John Jay, 9; R.H.\r\nHarrison, 6; John Rutledge, 6; John Hancock, 4; George Clinton, 3;\r\nSamuel Huntingdon, 2; John Milton, 2; James Armstrong, Benjamin Lincoln,\r\nand Edward Telfair, 1 each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1792.\r\n\r\nAt the next election, in 1792, the result was: Washington, 132 (all)\r\nvotes; John Adams, 77; George Clinton, 50; Thomas Jefferson, 4; Aaron\r\nBurr, 1; vacancies, 3. It would have been the same at the third election\r\nhad the illustrious Father of his Country consented to be a candidate;\r\nbut he was growing feeble, and had already sacrificed so much for his\r\ncountry, that his yearning for the quiet, restful life at Mount Vernon\r\ncould not be denied him. So he retired, and, less than three years\r\nlater, passed from earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORMY ELECTION.\r\n\r\nWhat may be looked upon as the first stormy election of a President took\r\nplace in 1800. When the electoral votes came to be counted, they were\r\nfound to be distributed as follows: Thomas Jefferson, 73; Aaron Burr,\r\n73; John Adams, 65; Charles C. Pinckney, 64; John Jay, 1. Jefferson and\r\nBurr being tied, the election was thrown into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where the contest became a memorable one. The House met\r\non the 11th of February, 1801, to decide the question. On the first\r\nballot, Jefferson had eight States and Burr six, while Maryland and\r\nVermont were equally divided. Here was another tie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL VIRGINIA COURT-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, one of the most terrific snowstorms ever known swept over\r\nWashington. Mr. Nicholson, of Maryland, was seriously ill in bed, and\r\nyet, if he did not vote, his State would be given to Burr, who would be\r\nelected President. Nicholson showed that he had the \"courage of his\r\nconvictions\" by allowing himself to be bundled up and carried through\r\nthe blizzard to one of the committee rooms, where his wife stayed by his\r\nside day and night. On each ballot the box was brought to his bedside,\r\nand he did not miss one. The House remained in continuous session until\r\nthirty-five ballots had been cast without any change.\r\n\r\nIt was clear by that time that Burr could not be elected, for the\r\ncolumns of Jefferson were as immovable as a stone wall. The break, when\r\nit came, must be in the ranks of Burr. On the thirty-sixth ballot, the\r\nFederalists of Maryland, Delaware, and South Carolina voted blank, and\r\nthe Federalist of Vermont stayed away. This gave the friends of\r\nJefferson their opportunity, and, fortunately for the country, Thomas\r\nJefferson was elected instead of the miscreant Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION AMENDED.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this noted contest, the Constitution was so amended that\r\neach elector voted for a President and a Vice-President, instead of for\r\ntwo candidates for President. It was a needed improvement, since it\r\ninsured that both should belong to the same political party.\r\n\r\nDuring the first term of Washington, the country was divided into two\r\npowerful political parties. Men who, like Washington, Hamilton, and\r\nothers, believed in a strong central government, with only such\r\npolitical power as was absolutely necessary distributed among the\r\nvarious States, were Federalists. Those who insisted upon the greatest\r\npossible power for the States, yielding nothing to Congress beyond what\r\nwas distinctly specified in the Constitution, were Republicans, of whom\r\nThomas Jefferson was the foremost leader. Other points of difference\r\ndeveloped as the years passed, but the main distinction was as given.\r\nAfter the election of John Adams, the Federalist party gradually\r\ndwindled, and in the war of 1812 its unpatriotic course fatally weakened\r\nthe organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY DIVIDED IN PARTIES.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party took the name of Democratic-Republican, which is\r\nits official title to-day. During Monroe's administration, when almost\r\nthe last vestige of Federalist vanished, their opponents gradually\r\nacquired the name of Democrats, by which they are now known. After a\r\ntime, the Federalists were succeeded by the Whigs, who held well\r\ntogether until the quarrel over the admission of Kansas and the question\r\nof slavery split the party into fragments. From these, including Know\r\nNothings, Abolitionists, Free Soilers, and Northern Democrats, was\r\nbuilded, in 1856, the present Republican party, whose foundation stone\r\nwas opposition to the extension of slavery. Many minor parties have\r\nsprung into ephemeral life from time to time, but the Democrats and\r\nRepublicans will undoubtedly be the two great political organizations\r\nfor many years to come, as they have been for so many years past.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE METHOD OF NOMINATING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the old-fashioned method of nominating\r\npresidential candidates was clumsy and frequently unfair. Candidates\r\nsometimes announced themselves for offices within the gift of the\r\npeople; but if that practice had continued to modern times, the number\r\nof candidates thus appealing for the suffrages of their fellow-citizens\r\nmight have threatened to equal the number of voters themselves. The more\r\ncommon plan was for the party leaders to hold private or informal\r\ncaucuses. The next method was for the legislative caucus to name the\r\nman. The unfairness of this system was that it shut out from\r\nrepresentation those whose districts had none of the opposite political\r\nparty in the Legislature. To adjust the matter, the caucus rule was so\r\nmodified as to admit delegates specially sent up from the districts that\r\nwere not represented in the Legislature. This, it will be seen, was an\r\nimportant step in the direction of the present system, which makes a\r\nnominating convention consist of delegates from every part of a State,\r\nchosen for the sole purpose of making nominations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE HOUSE AT WASHINGTON, D.C.]\r\n\r\nThe perfected method appeared in New Jersey as early as 1812, in\r\nPennsylvania in 1817, and in New York in 1825. There was no clearly\r\ndefined plan followed in making the presidential nominations for 1824,\r\nand four years later the legislative caucus system was almost\r\nuniversally followed. After that, the system which had been applied in\r\nvarious States was applied to national matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1826, William Morgan, a worthless character, living in\r\nBatavia, New York, attempted to expose the secrets of the order of Free\r\nMasons, of which he had become a member. While he was engaged in\r\nprinting his book, he disappeared and was never afterward seen. The\r\nMasons were accused of making way with him, and a wave of opposition\r\nswept over the country which closed many lodges and seemed for a time to\r\nthreaten the extinction of the order. An anti-Masonic party was formed\r\nand became strong enough to carry the election in several States. Not\r\nonly that, but in September, 1831, the anti-Masons held a National\r\nnominating convention in Baltimore and put forward William Wirt, former\r\nattorney-general of the United States, as their nominee for the\r\nPresidency, with Amos Ellmaker, candidate for the Vice-Presidency. The\r\nticket received seven electoral votes. The noteworthy fact about this\r\nalmost forgotten matter is that the convention was the first\r\npresidential one held in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION IN BALTIMORE IN 1832.\r\n\r\nThe system was now fairly launched, for in December of the same year the\r\nNational Republicans met in convention in Baltimore and nominated Henry\r\nClay, and in May, 1832, Martin Van Buren was nominated by a Democratic\r\nconvention. He was renominated at the same place and in the same manner\r\nin 1835, but the Whigs did not imitate their opponents. In 1840,\r\nhowever, the system was adopted by both parties, and has been followed\r\never since.\r\n\r\nOur whole country seethes with excitement from the hour when the first\r\ncandidate is hinted at until his nomination is made, followed by his\r\nelection or defeat a few months later. Some persons see a grave peril in\r\nthis periodic convulsion, which shakes the United States like an\r\nearthquake, but it seems after all to be a sort of political\r\nthunderstorm which purifies the air and clarifies the ideas that\r\notherwise would become sodden or morbid. It is essentially American, and\r\nour people's universal love of fair play leads them to accept the\r\nverdict at the polls with philosophy and good nature.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there have been many exciting scenes at the nominating\r\nconventions of the past, as there doubtless will be in many that are yet\r\nto come. Coming down to later times, how often has it proved that the\r\nmost astute politicians were all at sea in their calculations. The\r\nproverbial \"dark horse\" has become a potent factor whom it is not safe\r\nto forget in making up political probabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1820.\r\n\r\nProbably the most tranquil presidential campaign of the nineteenth\r\ncentury was that of 1820, when James Monroe was elected for the second\r\ntime. He was virtually the only candidate before the country for the\r\nexalted office. When the electoral college met, the astounding fact was\r\nrevealed that he had every vote--the first time such a thing had\r\noccurred since Washington's election.\r\n\r\nBut there was one elector who had the courage to do that which was\r\nnever done before and has never been done since: he voted contrary to\r\nhis instructions and in opposition to the ticket on which he was\r\nelected. Blumer, of New Hampshire, explained that, as he viewed it, no\r\nPresident had the right to share the honor of a unanimous election with\r\nWashington, and, though an ardent friend of Monroe, he deliberately cast\r\nhis one vote for Adams, in order to preserve Washington's honor\r\ndistinct. His motive was appreciated, and Blumer was applauded for the\r\nact, Monroe himself being pleased with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OLD HICKORY\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat that this incident has not been\r\nduplicated since that day. Andrew Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" was probably\r\nthe most popular man in the country when the time came for naming the\r\nsuccessor of Monroe. It may sound strange, but it is a fact, that when\r\nthe project of running him for the presidency was first mentioned to\r\nJackson, he was displeased. It had never entered his head to covet that\r\nexalted office.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think of it,\" he said; \"I haven't the first qualification; I am a\r\nrough, plain man, fitted perhaps to lead soldiers and fight the enemies\r\nof our country, but as for the presidency, the idea is too absurd to be\r\nheld.\"\r\n\r\nBut what American cannot be convinced that he is pre-eminently fitted\r\nfor the office? It did not take long for the ambition to be kindled in\r\nthe breast of the doughty hero. His friends flattered him into the\r\nconviction that he was the man of all others to assume the duties, and\r\nthe \"bee buzzed\" as loudly in Jackson's bonnet as it ever has in that of\r\nany of his successors.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON'S POPULARITY.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that \"Old Hickory\" was a great man, and though he\r\nwas deficient in education, lacking in statesmanship, and obstinate to\r\nthe last degree, he was the possessor of those rugged virtues which\r\ninvariably command respect. He was honest, clean in his private life, a\r\nstanch friend, an unrelenting enemy, and an intense patriot--one who was\r\nready to risk his life at any hour for his country. In addition, he\r\nnever knew the meaning of personal fear. No braver person ever lived.\r\nWhen the sheriff in a court-room was afraid to attempt to arrest a\r\nnotorious desperado, Jackson leaped over the chairs, seized the ruffian\r\nby the throat, hurled him to the floor, and cowed him into submission.\r\nWhen a piece of treachery was discovered on a Kentucky racecourse,\r\nJackson faced a mob of a thousand infuriated men, ruled off the\r\ndishonest official, and carried his point. He challenged the most noted\r\nduelist of the southwest, because he dared to cast a slur upon Jackson's\r\nwife. It mattered not that the scoundrel had never failed to kill his\r\nman, and that all of Jackson's friends warned him that it was certain\r\ndeath to meet the dead-shot. At the exchange of shots, Jackson was\r\nfrightfully wounded, but he stood as rigid as iron, and sent a bullet\r\nthrough the body of his enemy, whom he did not let know he was himself\r\nwounded until the other breathed his last.\r\n\r\nAbove all, had not \"Old Hickory\" won the battle of New Orleans, the most\r\nbrilliant victory of the War of 1812? Did not he and his unerring\r\nriflemen from the backwoods of Tennessee and Kentucky spread\r\nconsternation, death, and defeat among the red-coated veterans of\r\nWaterloo? No wonder that the anniversary of that glorious battle is\r\nstill celebrated in every part of the country, and no wonder, too, that\r\nthe American people demanded that the hero of all these achievements\r\nshould be rewarded with the highest office in the gift of his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON NOMINATED.\r\n\r\nJackson, having \"placed himself in the hands of his friends,\" threw\r\nhimself into the struggle with all the unquenchable ardor of his nature.\r\nOn July 22, 1822, the Legislature of Tennessee was first in the field by\r\nplacing him in nomination. On the 22d of February, 1824, a Federalist\r\nconvention at Harrisburg, Pa., nominated him, and on the 4th of March\r\nfollowing a Republican convention did the same. It would seem that he\r\nwas now fairly before the country, but the regular Democratic nominee,\r\nthat is, the one named by the congressional caucus, was William H.\r\nCrawford, of Georgia. The remaining candidates were John Quincy Adams\r\nand Henry Clay, and all of them belonged to the Republican party, which\r\nhad retained the presidency since 1800. Adams and Clay were what was\r\ntermed _loose_ constructionists, while Jackson and Crawford were\r\n_strict_ constructionists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OLD HICKORY\" DEFEATED.\r\n\r\nThe canvass was a somewhat jumbled one, in which each candidate had his\r\nardent partisans and supporters. The contest was carried out with vigor\r\nand the usual abuse, personalities, and vituperation until the polls\r\nwere closed. Then when the returns came to be made up it was found that\r\nJackson had received 99 electoral votes, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay\r\n37. \"Old Hickory\" was well ahead, but his strength was not sufficient to\r\nmake him President, even though on the popular vote he led Adams by more\r\nthan 50,000. Consequently the election went to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where the supporters of Clay combined with those of\r\nAdams and made him President. Thus came the singular result that the man\r\nwho had the largest popular and electoral vote was defeated.\r\n\r\nIt was a keen disappointment to Jackson and his friends. The great\r\nSenator Benton, of Missouri, one of the warmest supporters of \"Old\r\nHickory,\" angrily declared that the House was deliberately defying the\r\nwill of the people by placing a minority candidate in the chair. The\r\nsenator's position, however, was untenable, and so it was that John\r\nQuincy Adams became the sixth President of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON'S TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of \"Old Hickory\" was only postponed. His defeat was\r\nlooked upon by the majority of men as a deliberate piece of trickery,\r\nand they \"lay low\" for the next opportunity to square matters. No fear\r\nof a second chance being presented to their opponents. Jackson was\r\nlaunched into the canvass of 1828 like a cyclone, and when the returns\r\nwere made up he had 178 electoral votes to 83 for Adams--a vote which\r\nlifted him safely over the edge of a plurality and seated him firmly in\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SPANISH HOUSE ON BOURBON STREET, NEW ORLEANS.]\r\n\r\nIt is not our province to treat of the administration of Andrew Jackson,\r\nfor that belongs to history, but the hold which that remarkable man\r\nmaintained upon the affections of the people was emphasized when, in\r\n1832, he was re-elected by an electoral vote of 219 to 49 for Clay, 11\r\nfor Floyd, and 7 for Wirt. Despite the popular prejudice against a third\r\nterm, there is little doubt that Jackson would have been successful had\r\nhe chosen again to be a candidate. He proved his strength by selecting\r\nhis successor, Martin Van Buren.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"LOG-CABIN AND HARD-CIDER\" CAMPAIGN OF 1840.\r\n\r\nThe next notable presidential battle was the \"log-cabin and hard-cider\"\r\ncampaign of 1840, the like of which was never before seen in this\r\ncountry. General William Henry Harrison had been defeated by Van Buren\r\nin 1836, but on the 4th of December, 1839, the National Whig Convention,\r\nwhich met at Harrisburg to decide the claims of rival candidates,\r\nplaced Harrison in nomination, while the Democrats again nominated Van\r\nBuren.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison lived at North Bend, Ohio, in a house which consisted\r\nof a log-cabin, built many years before by a pioneer, and was afterward\r\ncovered with clapboards. The visitors to the house praised the\r\nrepublican simplicity of the old soldier, the hero of Tippecanoe, and\r\nthe principal campaign biography said that his table, instead of being\r\nsupplied with costly wines, was furnished with an abundance of the best\r\ncider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARIGNY HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n(Where Louis Philippe stopped in 1798.)]\r\n\r\nThe canvass had hardly opened, when the _Baltimore Republican_ slurred\r\nGeneral Harrison by remarking that, if some one would pension him with a\r\nfew hundred dollars and give him a barrel of hard cider, he would sit\r\ndown in his log-cabin and be content for the rest of his life. That\r\nsneer furnished the keynote of the campaign. Hard cider became almost\r\nthe sole beverage of the Whigs throughout the country. In every city,\r\ntown and village, and at the cross-roads, were erected log-cabins, while\r\nthe amount of hard cider drank would have floated the American navy. The\r\nnights were rent with the shouts of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too,\" and\r\nscores of campaign songs were sung by tens of thousands of exultant,\r\neven if not always musical, voices. We recall that one of the most\r\npopular songs began:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, where, tell me where, was the log-cabin made?\r\n  'Twas made by the boys that wield the plough and the spade.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the songs, which were set to the most popular airs\r\nand sung over and over again. You would hear them in the middle of the\r\nnight on some distant mountain-top, where the twinkling camp-fire showed\r\nthat a party of Whigs were drinking hard cider and whooping it up for\r\nHarrison; some singer with a strong, pleasing voice would start one of\r\nthe songs from the platform, at the close of the orator's appeal, and\r\nhardly had his lips parted, when the thousands of Whigs, old and young,\r\nand including wives and daughters, would join in the words, while the\r\nenthusiasm quickly grew to a white heat. The horsemen riding home late\r\nat night awoke the echoes among the woods and hills with their musical\r\npraises of \"Old Tippecanoe.\" The story is told that in one of the\r\nbackwoods districts of Ohio, after the preacher had announced the hymn,\r\nthe leader of the singing, a staid old deacon, struck in with a Harrison\r\ncampaign song, in which the whole congregation, after the first moment's\r\nshock, heartily joined, while the aghast preacher had all he could do to\r\nrestrain himself from \"coming in on the chorus.\" There was some truth in\r\nthe declaration of a disgusted Democrat that, from the opening of the\r\ncanvass, the whole Whig population of the United States went upon a\r\ncolossal spree on hard cider, which continued without intermission until\r\nHarrison was installed in the White House.\r\n\r\nAnd what did November tell? The electoral vote cast for Martin Van\r\nBuren, 60; for General Harrison, 234. No wonder that the supply of hard\r\ncider was almost exhausted within the next three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECULIAR FEATURE OF THE HARRISON CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nAs we have noted, the method of nominating presidential candidates by\r\nmeans of popular conventions was fully established in 1840, and has\r\ncontinued uninterruptedly ever since. One peculiar feature marked the\r\nHarrison campaign of 1840. The convention which nominated Martin Van\r\nBuren met in Baltimore in May of that year. On the same day, the young\r\nWhigs of the country held a mass-meeting in Baltimore, at which fully\r\ntwenty thousand persons were present. They came from every part of the\r\nUnion, Massachusetts sending fully a thousand. When the adjournment took\r\nplace, it was to meet again in Washington at the inauguration of\r\nHarrison. The railway was then coming into general use, and this greatly\r\nfavored the assembling of mass-conventions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREMONT, THE GREAT PATHFINDER, ADDRESSING THE INDIANS AT\r\nFORT LARAMIE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF POLK, 1845-1849.\r\n\r\nJames K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n(1795-1849.) One term, 1845-1849.]\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk, eleventh President, was born in Mecklenburg County, North\r\nCarolina, November 2, 1795, and died June 15, 1849. His father removed\r\nto Tennessee when the son was quite young, and he therefore became\r\nidentified with that State. He studied law, was a leading politician,\r\nand was elected to Congress in 1825, serving in that body for fourteen\r\nyears. He was elected governor of Tennessee in 1839, his next\r\nadvancement being to the presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President made George Bancroft, the distinguished historian, his\r\nsecretary of the navy. It was he who laid the foundation of the United\r\nStates Naval Academy at Annapolis, which was opened October 10, 1845. It\r\nis under the immediate care and supervision of the navy department and\r\ncorresponds to the Military Academy at West Point.\r\n\r\nEverybody knew that the admission of Texas meant war with Mexico, for\r\nthat country would never yield, until compelled to do so, the province\r\nthat had rebelled against her rule and whose independence she had\r\npersistently refused to recognize. Texas was unable to withstand the\r\nMexican army, and her authorities urged the United States to send a\r\nforce for her protection. General Zachary Taylor, who was in camp in\r\nwestern Louisiana, was ordered to advance into and occupy Texan\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nMexico had always insisted that the Nueces River was her western\r\nboundary, while Texas maintained that the Rio Grande was the dividing\r\nline. The dispute, therefore, was really over the tract of land between\r\nthe two rivers. Our country proposed to settle the question by\r\narbitration, but Mexico would not consent, claiming that the section\r\n(known as Coahuila) had never been in revolt against her authority,\r\nwhile Texas declared that it was a part of itself, and its Legislature\r\nso decided December 19, 1836.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor established a camp at Corpus Christi in the latter part\r\nof 1845, at the mouth of the Nueces. With nearly 5,000 troops, he\r\nmarched, in January, to the Rio Grande to meet the Mexicans who were\r\npreparing to invade the disputed territory. Taylor established a depot\r\nof provisions at Point Isabel on the Gulf, and, upon reaching the Rio\r\nGrande, hastily built Fort Brown, opposite the Mexican town of\r\nMatamoras.\r\n\r\nSome time later the Mexican forces reached Matamoras, and General Arista\r\non the 26th of April notified Taylor that hostilities had begun. To\r\nemphasize his declaration, Captain Thornton with a company of dragoons\r\nwas attacked the same day, and, after the loss of sixteen men in killed\r\nand wounded, was compelled to surrender to a much superior force. This\r\nwas the first engagement of the war and was fought on ground claimed by\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PALO ALTO.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans acted vigorously and soon placed Taylor's lines of\r\ncommunication in such danger that he hurried to Point Isabel to prevent\r\nits falling into the hands of the enemy. He left Major Brown with 300\r\nmen in charge of Fort Brown. The Mexicans were exultant, believing\r\nTaylor had been frightened out of the country. But that valiant officer\r\npaused at Point Isabel only long enough to make its position secure,\r\nwhen he marched rapidly toward Fort Brown. Reaching Palo Alto, on the\r\nroad, he found the way disputed by fully 6,000 Mexicans, who were three\r\ntimes as numerous as his own army. Attacking the enemy with great\r\nspirit, he routed them with the loss of a hundred men, his own loss\r\nbeing four killed and forty wounded.\r\n\r\nResuming his march toward Fort Brown, Taylor had reached a point within\r\nthree miles of it, when he was brought face to face with a much larger\r\nforce at Resaca de la Palma. The battle was a severe one, and for a long\r\ntime was in doubt; but the tide was turned by a dashing charge of\r\nCaptain May with his dragoons. Despite a destructive fire of grapeshot,\r\nthe horsemen galloped over the Mexican batteries, cut down the gunners,\r\nand captured the commanding officer. Taylor then pushed on to Fort Brown\r\nand found it safe, though it had been under an almost continuous\r\nbombardment, in which Major Brown, the commandant, was killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN ONE OF THE BATTLES OF THE MEXICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\"Always to be found where the fighting was the fiercest.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nNews of these battles was carried north by carrier pigeons and\r\ntelegraph, and the war spirit of the country was roused. Congress on\r\nthe 11th of May declared that war existed by the act of the Mexican\r\ngovernment, and $10,000,000 was placed at the disposal of the President,\r\nwho was authorized to accept 50,000 volunteers. The call for them was\r\nanswered by 300,000, who were eager to serve in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCOTT'S PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott, as head of the army, formed a careful plan of campaign\r\nfor the conquest of Mexico. Of the three divisions, General Kearny, with\r\nthe army of the west, was to cross the Rocky Mountains and conquer the\r\nnorthern Mexican provinces; General Scott himself, with the army of the\r\ncentre, was to advance from the coast into the interior of the country,\r\nmaking the city of Mexico, the capital of the republic, his objective\r\npoint; while General Taylor, with the army of occupation, was to seize\r\nand hold the Rio Grande country. The work of mustering in the troops was\r\nintrusted to General Wool, who, some time later, established himself at\r\nSan Antonio, and sent many soldiers to the different commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF MONTEREY.\r\n\r\nWithin less than two weeks after his victory at Resaca de la Palma,\r\nTaylor crossed over from Fort Brown and captured Matamoras. Then he\r\nturned up the right bank of the Rio Grande and marched into the\r\ninterior. The Mexicans retreated to the fortified town of Monterey,\r\nwhere they were so powerful that Taylor waited for reinforcements before\r\nattacking them. His forces amounted to 6,600 by the latter part of\r\nAugust, and he then advanced against Monterey, which was defended by a\r\ngarrison of 10,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe city was invested on the 19th of September. Two days sufficed for\r\nGeneral Worth to capture the fortified works in the rear of the town,\r\nand on the next day the remaining defenses on that side were carried by\r\nstorm. At daylight, on the 23d, the city in front was captured by\r\nassault. The Mexicans maintained a vicious defense from their adobe\r\nhouses, but the Americans, charging through the streets, battered in the\r\ndoors, chased the defenders from room to room and over the housetops\r\nuntil they flung down their arms and shouted for mercy. The commander\r\nwas allowed to evacuate the city, and fell back toward the national\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER VICTORIES.\r\n\r\nTaylor was about to resume his advance when the enemy asked for an\r\narmistice, saying the authorities wished to negotiate for peace. Taylor\r\nagreed to an armistice of eight weeks, but the proposal was a trick of\r\nthe enemy, who spent every hour of the respite in making preparations to\r\nresist the Americans' advance. Santa Anna, who was undergoing one of\r\nhis periodical banishments, was called back and given the presidency.\r\nWhen the armistice granted by Taylor expired, the Mexicans had an army\r\nof 20,000 in the field, and, under orders from Washington, the American\r\ncommander moved forward. The first town captured was Saltillo, seventy\r\nmiles southwest of Monterey. It was taken by General Worth, with the\r\nadvance, on the 15th of November, 1846. In the following month Victoria,\r\nin the province of Tamaulipas, was captured by General Butler, who,\r\nadvancing from Monterey, united with Patterson at this place. Their\r\nintention was to move upon Tampico, on the coast, but they learned that\r\nit had surrendered to Captain Conner, commander of an American squadron.\r\nMeanwhile, General Wool, marching from San Antonio, arrived within\r\nsupporting distance of Monterey. Such was the situation when General\r\nScott reached the army and took command.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEARNY'S OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kearny, in command of the army of the west, left Fort\r\nLeavenworth, in June, 1846, on the way to conquer New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia. He had a long and laborious march before him, but he reached\r\nSanta Fe on the 18th of August, and it was easily captured and\r\ngarrisoned. New Mexico was powerless, and the whole province\r\nsurrendered. Then Kearny, at the head of 400 dragoons, set out for the\r\nPacific coast, but he had not gotten far on the road when he met a\r\nmessenger who informed him that California had been conquered by Colonel\r\nJohn C. Fremont, acting in conjunction with Commodores Sloat and\r\nStockton. Kearny sent most of his men back to Santa Fe and pushed for\r\nthe Pacific coast, with a hundred dragoons. He arrived in November, and\r\njoined Fremont and Stockton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nFremont acquired the name of the \"Pathfinder\" because of his exploring\r\nexpeditions in the far West. He explored a portion of the Rocky\r\nMountains in 1842, and, in the following two years, conducted an\r\nexpedition with much skill and success through the regions of Utah, the\r\nbasin of the Columbia, and the passes of the Sierra Nevada. He was in\r\ncharge of a third expedition in 1846, and was in California when the\r\nMexican war broke out. He received the dispatches as if they were news\r\nto him, but there is good reason to believe that the government had sent\r\nhim thither, in order that he might be on the ground and do the very\r\nwork he did. He urged the pioneers to declare their independence. They\r\nardently did so, raised the \"Black Bear Flag,\" and gathered around\r\nFremont, who continually defeated the superior forces of Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThe town of Monterey, eighty miles south of San Francisco, was captured\r\nby Commodore Sloat with an American squadron, and San Diego was taken\r\nsoon afterward by Commodore Stockton, in command of the Pacific\r\nsquadron; learning which, Fremont raised the American flag in the place\r\nof that of California, and, joining the naval commanders, advanced upon\r\nLos Angeles, which submitted without resistance. In a short time the\r\nimmense province of California was conquered by what may be called a\r\nhandful of Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL MARCH OF COLONEL DONIPHAN.\r\n\r\nColonel Alexander W. Doniphan had been left at Santa Fe with his small\r\nforce of dragoons. At the head of 700 men, he performed one of the most\r\nremarkable exploits of the war. Riding directly through the enemy's\r\ncountry for nearly a thousand miles, he reached the Rio Grande on\r\nChristmas day and won a battle; he then crossed the river and captured\r\nEl Paso, and, heading for Chihuahua, was met by a Mexican force on the\r\nbanks of Sacramento Creek. They outnumbered Doniphan's force four to\r\none, and displayed the black flag, as notice that no quarter would be\r\ngiven. The Americans lay flat on the ground, and the first volleys\r\npassed harmlessly over their heads. The Mexicans made the mistake of\r\nbelieving they had been decimated by the discharge, and charged upon\r\nwhat they supposed were the few survivors. They were received with a\r\nwithering volley, and assailed with such fierceness by the Americans\r\nthat they were utterly routed. Chihuahua thus fell into the possession\r\nof Colonel Doniphan, but, since the term of the enlistment of his men\r\nhad expired, he could advance no further. He then conducted them to New\r\nOrleans, where they were mustered out of service. They had marched a\r\ndistance of 5,000 miles, won several victories, suffered not a single\r\ndefeat, and were back again in their homes all within a year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott had landed on the coast for the purpose of marching into\r\nthe interior to the national capital. In order to make his advance\r\nresistless, he withdrew the larger part of Taylor's army and united it\r\nwith his own. Taylor felt he was used unjustly, for both he and Wool\r\nwere threatened by Santa Anna at the head of 20,000, men, but bluff \"Old\r\nRough and Ready\" made no protest and grimly prepared for the danger. The\r\ngreatest number of troops he could concentrate at Saltillo was about\r\n6,000, and, after placing garrisons there and at Monterey, he had only\r\n4,800 remaining, but, undismayed, he marched out to meet Santa Anna.\r\nFour miles away, he reached the favorable battle ground of Buena Vista,\r\nposted his men, and awaited attack.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican commander was so confident of overwhelming the Americans\r\nthat, in his message to Taylor, he assured him he would see that he was\r\npersonally well treated after his surrender. General Taylor sent word\r\nthat he declined to obey the summons, and the messenger who carried the\r\nmessage to Santa Anna added the significant words: \"General Taylor\r\n_never_ surrenders.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF RESACA DE LA PALMA\r\n\r\nCaptain May leaped his steed over the parapets, followed by those of his\r\nmen whose horses could do a like feat, and was among the gunners the\r\nnext moment, sabering them right and left. General La Vega and a hundred\r\nof his men were made prisoners and borne back to the American lines.]\r\n\r\nThe American army was placed at the upper end of a long and narrow pass\r\nin the mountains. It was flanked on one side by high cliffs and on the\r\nother by impassable ravines, which position compelled the enemy to\r\nattack him in front.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF BUENA VISTA.\r\n\r\nThe battle opened early on the morning of February 23d, with the\r\nMexicans swarming through the gorges and over the hills from San Luis\r\nPotosi. The first assault was against the American right, but it was\r\nbeaten back by the Illinois troops; the next was against the centre, but\r\nit was repelled by Captain Washington's artillery; and then the left\r\nflank was vehemently assailed. A mistaken order caused an Indiana\r\nregiment to give way, and for a time the whole army was in danger; but\r\nthe Mississippians and Kentuckians gallantly flung themselves into the\r\nbreach, the Indiana and Illinois troops rallied, and the Mexicans were\r\ndriven tumultuously back. In this brilliant exploit Colonel Jefferson\r\nDavis, with his Mississippi regiment, played a prominent part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A LITTLE MORE GRAPE, CAPTAIN BRAGG.\"\r\n\r\nThe next charge was upon Captain Bragg's battery, but that officer, in\r\nobedience to General Taylor's famous request, \"A little more grape,\r\nCaptain Bragg,\" scattered the Mexican lancers in every direction. The\r\nsuccess was followed up by a cavalry charge, which completed the\r\ndiscomfiture of the enemy, who fled with the loss of 2,000 men.\r\n\r\nBuena Vista was a superb victory for the Americans, but it cost them\r\ndear. The killed, wounded, and missing numbered nearly 800. Among the\r\nkilled was Colonel Henry Clay, son of the Kentucky orator and statesman.\r\nThe battle completed the work of General Taylor, who soon afterward\r\nreturned to the United States. The glory he had won made him President\r\nless than two two years later.\r\n\r\nReturning once more to General Scott, he entered upon the last\r\ncampaign, March 9, 1847. Old army officers of to-day contrast the\r\nadmirable manner in which he did his preliminary work with the\r\nmismanagement in the Spanish-American War of 1898. Impatience was\r\nexpressed at his tardiness in getting his troops ready on the transports\r\nat New York. To all such complaints, the grim old soldier replied that\r\nhe would embark when everything was ready and not a single hour before.\r\nAs a consequence, his men landed at Vera Cruz in the best condition,\r\nthere was not the slightest accident, and every soldier when he stepped\r\nashore had three days' rations in his knapsack. Twelve thousand men were\r\nlanded, and in three days the investment of Vera Cruz was complete. Then\r\na Mexican train was captured and the troops had provisions in abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nThe city having refused to surrender, the bombardment opened on the\r\nmorning of March 22d. The water-side of Vera Cruz was defended by the\r\ncastle of San Juan d'Ulloa, built a century and a half before by Spain\r\nat enormous cost. Commodore Conner assisted throughout the four days\r\nthat the cannonade lasted. The success of the bombardment made the\r\nAmericans confident of capturing the castle by assault, and they were\r\npreparing to do so when the authorities proposed satisfactory terms of\r\nsurrender, which took place March 29th.\r\n\r\nThe direct march upon the capital now began, with General Twiggs in\r\ncommand of the advance. The road steadily rises from the coast and\r\nabounds in passes and mountains, which offer the best kind of natural\r\nfortifications. When Twiggs reached one of these passes, named Cerro\r\nGordo, he found that Santa Anna had taken possession of it with 15,000\r\ntroops. The whole American army numbered only 9,000, and it looked as if\r\nthey were halted in front of an impregnable position, but it must be\r\ncaptured or the whole campaign would have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CERRO GORDO.\r\n\r\nThere was no hesitation on the part of our troops, who, under the lead\r\nof the bravest and most skillful of officers, attacked with their usual\r\nenergy and daring. The Mexicans made the best defense possible, but\r\nwithin a few hours they abandoned every position and were driven in\r\nheadlong confusion from the field. They lost 3,000 prisoners, among whom\r\nwere five generals, while the escape of Santa Anna was so narrow that he\r\nleft his cork leg behind.\r\n\r\nThe American army pressed on to Jalapa, which made no resistance, and\r\nfurnished a large amount of supplies, and Puebla, a city of 80,000\r\ninhabitants, was occupied on the 15th of May. There the ground was high\r\nand the air cool and salubrious. The men were exhausted from their\r\narduous campaign, and Scott decided to give them a good rest, so as to\r\nbe fully prepared for the final struggle. Besides it was necessary to\r\nreceive reinforcements before venturing further. Santa Anna, realizing\r\nthat the critical period of the struggle was at hand, put forth every\r\nenergy to collect an army to beat back the invaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Lee led the way, and showed the men just what to do. They\r\nlowered the cannons by ropes down the steep cliffs and hauled them up on\r\nthe opposite hillside.\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in August the American army had been increased to 11,000 men, and,\r\nleaving a small garrison at Puebla, Scott set out for the beautiful city\r\nof Mexico. No serious resistance offered until they reached Ayotla,\r\nfifteen miles from the capital. There it was found that the regular\r\nroad bristled with forts, and, although there was no doubt that all\r\ncould be carried, the American commander wisely decided to move his army\r\naround to the south, where he could advance over a comparatively\r\nundefended route. Without any difficulty he reached San Augustine, which\r\nwas within ten miles of the capital.\r\n\r\nHad the positions been changed, a force ten times as great as the\r\nAmericans could not have captured the city of Mexico, and yet it fell\r\nbefore a force only one-third as numerous as the defenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY OF VICTORIES.\r\n\r\nThe fighting began before sunrise, August 20, 1847, and when night came\r\nfive distinct victories had been won. The fortified camp of Contreras\r\nwas captured in about fifteen minutes. Shortly after the fortified\r\nvillage of San Antonio was taken by another division of the army. Almost\r\nat the same time, a division stormed one of the fortified heights of\r\nChurubusco, while still another captured the second height. Seeing the\r\ndanger of his garrisons, Santa Anna moved out of the city and attacked\r\nthe Americans. The reserves immediately assailed, drove him back, and\r\nchased him to the walls of the capital, into which the whole Mexican\r\nforce crowded themselves at night.\r\n\r\nIt was in accordance with the nature of Santa Anna that he should set\r\n2,000 convicts loose that night on the promise that they would fight\r\nagainst the Americans. Then he stole out of the city, whose authorities\r\nsent a delegation to Scott to treat for peace. This trick had been\r\nresorted to so many times by the Mexicans, who never kept faith, that\r\nthe American commander refused to listen to them. An advance was made,\r\nand in a short time the city was completely in our possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA ANNA.\r\n\r\nAt Puebla there were 2,000 Americans in the hospital under charge of a\r\nsmall guard. Santa Anna attacked them, thinking that at last he had\r\nfound a foe whom he could beat; but he was mistaken, for reinforcements\r\narrived in time to drive him away. This terminated for a time the career\r\nof the treacherous Santa Anna, with whom the Mexican people were\r\nthoroughly disgusted.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to state at this point that Santa Anna while in command of\r\nthe Mexican army made a direct offer to General Taylor to betray his\r\ncause for a large sum of money, and he actually received an installment,\r\nbut circumstances prevented the completeness of the bargain. This\r\nmiscreant was president and dictator of Mexico in 1853-55, was banished\r\nand returned several times, and was still plotting to recover his power\r\nwhen he died, in his eighty-second year.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the capital of Mexico completed the victorious campaign.\r\nThe entrance into the city was made September 14, 1847, the American\r\nflag raised over the palace, and General Scott, with a sweep of his\r\nsword over his head, while his massive frame made a striking picture in\r\nfront of the palace, proclaimed the conquest of the country. All that\r\nremained was to arrange the terms of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, American ambassadors met the Mexican congress\r\nin session at Guadalupe Hidalgo, so named from the small town where it\r\nwas situated. There was a good deal of discussion over the terms; our\r\nambassadors insisting that Mexico should surrender the northern\r\nprovinces, which included the present States of California, Nevada,\r\nUtah, and the Territories of Arizona and New Mexico and portions of\r\nColorado and Wyoming, as indemnity for the war. Mexico would not\r\nconsent, and matters drifted along until the 2d of February, 1848, when\r\nthe new Mexican government agreed to these terms. The treaty was\r\nmodified to a slight extent by the United States Senate, adopted on the\r\n10th of March, ratified by the Mexican congress sitting at Queretaro,\r\nMay 30th, and proclaimed by President Polk on the 4th of July. Thus\r\nended our war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the treaty, the United States was to pay Mexico\r\n$15,000,000, and assume debts to the extent of $3,000,000 due to\r\nAmerican citizens from Mexico. These sums were in payment for the\r\nimmense territory ceded to us. This cession, the annexation of Texas,\r\nand a purchase south of the Gila River in 1853, added almost a million\r\nsquare miles to our possessions, nearly equaling the Louisiana purchase\r\nand exceeding the whole area of the United States in 1783.\r\n\r\nIt may sound strange, but it is a fact, that the governing of the new\r\nterritory caused so much trouble that more than once it was seriously\r\nproposed in Congress that Mexico should be asked to take it back again.\r\nGeneral Sherman was credited with the declaration that if the identity\r\nof the man who caused the annexation of Texas could be established, he\r\nought to be court-martialed and shot. However, all this changed when the\r\nvast capabilities and immeasurable worth of the new countries were\r\nunderstood. The section speedily developed a wealth, enterprise, and\r\nindustry of which no one had before dreamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVERY QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe real peril involved in the acquisition of so much territory lay in\r\nthe certainty that it would revive the slavery quarrel that had been put\r\nto sleep by the Missouri Compromise, nearly thirty years before. The\r\nNorth demanded that slavery should be excluded from the new territory,\r\nbecause it was so excluded by Mexican law, and to legalize it would keep\r\nout emigrants from the free States. The South demanded the authorization\r\nof slavery, since Southern emigrants would not go thither without their\r\nslaves. Still others proposed to divide the new territory by the\r\nMissouri Compromise line. This would have cut California in two near the\r\nmiddle, and made one part of the province slave and the other free.\r\nAltogether, it will be seen that trouble was at hand.\r\n\r\nBefore the outbreak of the Mexican War, Congressman David Wilmot, of\r\nPennsylvania, introduced the Proviso known by his name. It was a\r\nproposal to purchase the territory from Mexico, provided slavery was\r\nexcluded. The introduction of the bill produced much discussion, and it\r\nwas defeated by the opposition of the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OREGON BOUNDARY DISPUTE.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and the United States had jointly occupied Oregon for\r\ntwenty years, under the agreement that the occupancy could be ended by\r\neither country under a year's notice to the other. Many angry debates\r\ntook place in Congress over the question whether such notice should be\r\ngiven. The United States claimed a strip of territory reaching to\r\nAlaska, latitude 54 deg. 40', while Great Britain claimed the territory\r\nsouth of the line to the Columbia River. Congress as usual had plenty of\r\nwordy patriots who raised the cry of \"Fifty-four forty or fight,\" and it\r\nwas repeated throughout the country. Cooler and wiser counsels\r\nprevailed, each party yielded a part of its claims, and made a middle\r\nline the boundary. A minor dispute over the course of the boundary line\r\nafter it reached the Pacific islets was amicably adjusted by another\r\ntreaty in 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATES ADMITTED.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the bill for the admission of Iowa did not\r\nbecome operative until 1846. It was the fourth State formed from the\r\nLouisiana purchase, and was first settled by the French at Dubuque; but\r\nthe post died, and no further settlements were made until the close of\r\nthe Black Hawk War of 1832, after which the population increased with\r\ngreat rapidity.\r\n\r\nWisconsin was the last State formed from the old Northwest Territory. A\r\nfew weak settlements were made by the French as early as 1668, but, as\r\nin the case of Iowa, its real settlement began after the Black Hawk War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\nJames Smithson of England, when he died in 1829, bequeathed his large\r\nestate for the purpose of founding the Smithsonian Institution at\r\nWashington \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\" In\r\n1838, his estate, amounting to more than half a million dollars, was\r\nsecured by a government agent and deposited in the mint. John Quincy\r\nAdams prepared a plan of organization, which was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian Institution, so named in honor of its founder, was\r\nplaced under the immediate control of a board of regents, composed of\r\nthe President, Vice-President, judges of the supreme court, and other\r\nprincipal officers of the government. It was provided that the entire\r\nsum, amounting with accrued interest to $625,000, should be loaned\r\nforever to the United States government at six per cent.; that from the\r\nproceeds, together with congressional appropriations and private gifts,\r\nproper buildings should be erected for containing a museum of natural\r\nhistory, a cabinet of minerals, a chemical laboratory, a gallery of art,\r\nand a library. The plan of organization was carried out, and Professor\r\nJoseph Henry of Princeton College, the real inventor of the\r\nelectro-magnetic telegraph, was chosen secretary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nFor many years hardy hunters and trappers had penetrated the vast\r\nwilderness of the West and Northwest in their hunt for game and\r\npeltries. Some of these were in the employ of the Hudson Bay Company,\r\nwhose grounds extended as far toward the Arctic Circle as the rugged men\r\nand toughened Indians could penetrate on their snowshoes.\r\n\r\nAt points hundreds of miles apart in the gloomy solitudes were erected\r\ntrading posts to which the red men brought furs to exchange for\r\ntrinkets, blankets, firearms, and firewater, and whither the white\r\ntrappers made their way, after an absence of months in the dismal\r\nsolitudes. Further south, among the rugged mountains and beside the\r\nalmost unknown streams, other men set their traps for the beaver, fox,\r\nand various fur-bearing animals. Passing the Rocky Mountains and Cascade\r\nRange they pursued their perilous avocation along the headwaters of the\r\nrivers flowing through California. They toiled amid the snows and storms\r\nof the Sierras, facing perils from the Indians, savage beasts, and the\r\nweather, for pay that often did not amount to the wages received by an\r\nordinary day laborer.\r\n\r\nLittle did those men suspect they were walking, sleeping, and toiling\r\nover a treasure bed; that instead of tramping through snow and over ice\r\nand facing the arctic blasts and vengeful red men, if they had dug into\r\nthe ground, they would have found wealth beyond estimate.\r\n\r\nThe priests lived in the adobe haciendas that the Spanish had erected\r\ncenturies before, and, as they counted their beads and dozed in calm\r\nhappiness, they became rich in flocks and the tributes received from the\r\nsimple-minded red men. Sometimes they wondered in a mild way at the\r\ngolden trinkets and ornaments brought in by the Indians and were puzzled\r\nto know where they came from, but it seemed never to have occurred to\r\nthe good men that they could obtain the same precious metal by using the\r\npick and shovel. The years came and passed, and red men and white men\r\ncontinued to walk over California without dreaming of the immeasurable\r\nriches that had been nestling for ages under their feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD WASHING--THE SLUICE.]\r\n\r\nOne day in February, 1848, James W. Marshall, who had come to California\r\nfrom New Jersey some years before, and had been doing only moderately\r\nwell with such odd jobs as he could pick up, was working with a\r\ncompanion at building a sawmill for Colonel John A. Sutter, who had\r\nimmigrated to this country from Baden in 1834. Going westward, he\r\nfounded a settlement on the present site of Sacramento in 1841. He built\r\nFort Sutter on the Sacramento, where he was visited by Fremont on his\r\nexploring expedition in 1846.\r\n\r\nMarshall and his companion were engaged in deepening the mill-race, the\r\nformer being just in front of the other. Happening to look around, he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"What is that shining near your boot?\"\r\n\r\nHis friend reached his hand down into the clear water and picked up a\r\nbright, yellow fragment and held it between his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"It is brass,\" he said; \"but how bright it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be brass,\" replied Marshall, \"for there isn't a piece of brass\r\nwithin fifty miles of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe other turned it over again and again in his hand, put it in his\r\nmouth and bit it, and then held it up once more to the light. Suddenly\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I believe it's gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if that's possible,\" said Marshall, beginning to think his\r\ncompanion was right; \"how can we find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife can tell; she has made some lye from wood-ashes and will test\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD WASHING--THE CRADLE.]\r\n\r\nThe man took the fragment to his wife, who was busy washing, and, at his\r\nrequest, she boiled it for several hours with the lye. Had it been\r\nbrass--the only other metal it possibly could have been--it would have\r\nturned a greenish-black. When examined again, however, its beautiful\r\nbright lustre was undiminished. There was scarcely a doubt that it was\r\npure gold.\r\n\r\nThe two men returned to the mill-race with pans, and washed out probably\r\nfifty dollars' worth of gold. Despite the certainty of his friend,\r\nMarshall was troubled by a fear that the fragment was neither brass nor\r\ngold, but some worthless metal of which he knew nothing. He carefully\r\ntied up all that had been gathered, mounted a fleet horse, and rode to\r\nSutter's store, thirty miles down the American River.\r\n\r\nHere he took Colonel Sutter into a private room and showed him what he\r\nhad found, saying that he believed it to be gold. Sutter read up the\r\naccount of gold in an encyclopedia, tested the substance with aqua\r\nfortis, weighed it, and decided that Marshall was right, and that the\r\nmaterial he had found was undoubtedly gold.\r\n\r\nIt was a momentous discovery, repeated nearly a half-century later, when\r\nthe same metal was found in enormous quantities in the Klondike region.\r\nColonel Sutter and his companions tried to keep the matter a secret, but\r\nit was impossible. Marshall, being first on the ground, enriched\r\nhimself, but by bad management lost all he had gained and died a poor\r\nman. Colonel Sutter tried to keep intruders off his property, but they\r\ncame like the swarms of locusts that plagued Egypt. They literally\r\noverran him, and when he died, in 1880, he was without any means\r\nwhatever; but California has since erected a handsome statue to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nFor the following ten or twenty years, it may be said, the eyes of the\r\ncivilized world were upon California, and men rushed thither from every\r\nquarter of the globe. There was an endless procession of emigrant trains\r\nacross the plains; the ships that fought the storms on their way around\r\nCape Horn were crowded almost to gunwales, while thousands halved the\r\nvoyage by trudging, across the Isthmus of Panama to the waiting ships on\r\nthe other side. California became a mining camp and millions upon\r\nmillions of gold were taken from her soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORMONS.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Mormons engaged much public attention. Joseph Smith, of\r\nSharon, Vermont, and Palmyra, New York, was the founder of the sect. He\r\nclaimed to have found in a cave a number of engraved plates, containing\r\nthe Mormon Bible, which was his guide in the formation of a new form of\r\nreligious belief. Although polygamy was not commended, it was afterward\r\nadded to their peculiar faith, which is that sins are remitted through\r\nbaptism, and that the will of God was revealed to his prophet, Smith, as\r\nit was to be revealed to his successors.\r\n\r\nThe most grotesque farce in the name of religion is sure to find\r\nbelievers, and they soon gathered about Smith. The first Mormon\r\nconference was held at Fayette, N.Y., in 1830. As their number\r\nincreased, they saw that the West offered the best opportunity for\r\ngrowth and expansion, and, when there were nearly 2,000 of them, they\r\nremoved to Jackson, Missouri, where they made a settlement. Their\r\npractices angered the people, and, as soon as they could find a good\r\npretext, the militia were called out and they were ordered to \"move on.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the Mississippi into Illinois, they laid out a city which they\r\nnamed Nauvoo. Some of them were wealthy, and, as they held their means\r\nin common, they were able to erect a beautiful temple and numerous\r\nresidences. Converts now flocked to them until they numbered fully\r\n10,000. Their neighbors were displeased with their presence, and the\r\nfeeling grew into indignation when the Mormons not only refused to obey\r\nthe State laws, but defied them and passed laws of their own in open\r\nopposition. In the excitement that followed, Joseph Smith and his\r\nbrother Hyram were arrested and lodged in jail at Carthage. Lynch-law\r\nwas as popular in the West as it is to-day in the South, and a mob broke\r\ninto the jail and killed the Smith brothers. This took place in June,\r\n1844, and the Illinois Legislature annulled the charter of Nauvoo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.]\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Mormons convinced them that they would never be\r\nallowed to maintain their organization in any of the States. They,\r\ntherefore, gathered up their worldly goods, and, in 1846, set out on the\r\nlong journey to the far West. Reaching the Basin of Utah, they founded\r\nGreat Salt Lake City, which is one of the handsomest, best governed, and\r\ncleanest (in a physical sense) cities in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile referring to these peculiar people, we may as well complete their\r\nhistory by anticipating events that followed.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, our government attempted to extend its judicial system over\r\nUtah Territory. Brigham Young, the successor of Joseph Smith, until then\r\nhad not been disturbed, and he did not mean to be interfered with by any\r\ngovernment. He insulted the Federal judges sent thither and drove them\r\nout of the Territory, his pretext being that the objectionable character\r\nof the judges justified the step. Our government, which is always\r\npatient in such matters, could not accept this explanation, and Alfred\r\nCumming, superintendent of Indian affairs on the Upper Missouri, was\r\nmade governor of Utah and Judge Delano Eckels, of Indiana, was appointed\r\nchief justice of the Territory. Knowing that he would be resisted,\r\nColonel Albert Sidney Johnston was sent thither to compel obedience to\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nThe United States troops, numbering 2,500, entered the Territory in\r\nOctober and were attacked by the Mormons, who destroyed their supply\r\ntrain and compelled the men to seek winter quarters near Fort Bridges.\r\nAffairs were in this critical state when a messenger from the President,\r\nin the spring of 1858, carried a conciliatory letter to Brigham Young,\r\nwhich did much to soothe his ruffled feelings. Then, by-and-by, Governor\r\nPowell of Kentucky and Major McCulloch of Texas appeared with a\r\nproclamation of pardon to all who would submit to Federal authority. The\r\nMormons were satisfied, accepted the terms, and in May, 1860, the United\r\nStates troops were withdrawn from the Territory.\r\n\r\nSince that time our government has had many difficulties in dealing with\r\nthe Mormons. Although polygamy is forbidden by the laws of the States\r\nand Territories, the sect continued to practice it. In March, 1882,\r\nCongress passed what is known as the Edmunds Act, which excluded Mormons\r\nfrom local offices which they had hitherto wholly controlled. Many\r\npersons were indicted and punished for the practice of polygamy, while\r\nothers abandoned it. Brigham Young, who had become governor of Deseret\r\nin 1849, and two years later was appointed governor of Utah, died in\r\n1877, at which time he was president of the Mormon church. The practice\r\nof polygamy was never fully eradicated, and Utah, at this writing, is\r\nrepresented in the United States Senate by men who make no attempt at\r\nconcealing the fact that they are polygamists.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1848.\r\n\r\nThe former Democrats and Whigs who were friendly to the Wilmot Proviso\r\nformed the Free Soil party in 1848, to which also the Abolitionists\r\nnaturally attached themselves. The regular Whigs and Democrats refused\r\nto support the Wilmot Proviso, through fear of alienating the South. The\r\nFree Soilers named as their nominees Martin Van Buren, for President,\r\nand Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts, for Vice-President; the\r\nDemocrats selected Louis Cass, of Michigan, for President, and William\r\nO. Butler, of Kentucky, for Vice-President; the Whig candidates were\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor, of Louisiana, for President, and Millard\r\nFillmore, of New York, for Vice-President. At the electoral vote Zachary\r\nTaylor was elected President and Millard Fillmore Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF TAYLOR, FILLMORE, PIERCE, AND BUCHANAN, 1849-1857.\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor--The \"Irrepressible Conflict\" in Congress--The Omnibus\r\nBill--Death of President Taylor--Millard Fillmore--Death of the Old\r\nLeaders and Debut of the New--The Census of 1850--Surveys for a Railway\r\nto the Pacific--Presidential Election of 1852--Franklin Pierce--Death of\r\nVice-President King--A Commercial Treaty Made with Japan--Filibustering\r\nExpeditions--The Ostend Manifesto--The \"Know Nothing\" Party--The Kansas\r\nNebraska Bill and Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\nZACHARY TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZACHARY TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n(1784-1850.) One partial term, 1849-1850.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor, twelfth President of the United States, was born\r\nat Orange Court-House, Virginia, September 24, 1784, but, while an\r\ninfant, his parents removed to Kentucky. His school education was\r\nslight, but he possessed fine military instincts and developed into one\r\nof the best of soldiers. His services in the war of 1812 and in that\r\nwith Mexico have been told in their proper place. His defense of Fort\r\nHarrison, on the Wabash, during the last war with England, won him the\r\ntitle of major by brevet, that being the first time the honor was\r\nconferred in the American army.\r\n\r\nNo man could have been less a politician than \"Old Rough and Ready,\" for\r\nhe had not cast a vote in forty years. Daniel Webster characterized him\r\nas an \"ignorant frontier colonel,\" and did not conceal his disgust over\r\nhis nomination by the great party of which the New England orator was\r\nthe leader. It was Taylor's brilliant services in Mexico, that made him\r\npopular above all others with the masses, who are the ones that make\r\nand unmake presidents. Besides, a great many felt that Taylor had not\r\nbeen generously treated by the government, and this sentiment had much\r\nto do with his nomination and election.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT.\r\n\r\nThe \"irrepressible conflict\" between slavery and freedom could not be\r\npostponed, and when, on the 13th of February, 1850, the President sent\r\nto Congress the petition of California for admission as a State, the\r\nquarrel broke out afresh. The peculiar character of the problem has\r\nalready been stated. A part of California lay north and a part south of\r\n36 deg. 30', the dividing line between slavery and freedom as defined by\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, thirty years, before. Congress, therefore, had\r\nnot the power to exclude slavery, and the question had to be decided by\r\nthe people themselves. They had already done so by inserting a clause in\r\nthe Constitution which prohibited slavery.\r\n\r\nThere were violent scenes on the floor of Congress. General Foote, of\r\nMississippi, was on the point of discharging a pistol at Colonel Benton,\r\nof Missouri, when bystanders seized his arm and prevented. Weapons were\r\nfrequently drawn, and nearly every member went about armed and ready for\r\na deadly affray. The South threatened to secede from the Union, and we\r\nstood on the brink of civil war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPROMISE OF 1850.\r\n\r\nIt was at this fearful juncture that Henry Clay, now an old man,\r\nsubmitted to the Senate his famous \"Omnibus Bill,\" so called because of\r\nits many features, which proposed a series of compromises as follows:\r\nthe admission of California as a State, with the Constitution adopted by\r\nher people (which prohibited slavery); the establishment of territorial\r\ngovernments over all the other newly acquired Territories, with no\r\nreference to slavery; the abolishment of all traffic in slaves in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, but declaring it inexpedient to abolish slavery\r\nthere without the consent of the inhabitants and also of Maryland; the\r\nassumption of the debts of Texas; while all fugitive slaves in the free\r\nStates should be liable to arrest and return to slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, the Southern leader, was earnestly opposed to the\r\ncompromise, but he was ill and within a few weeks of death, and his\r\nargument was read in the Senate by Senator Mason. Daniel Webster\r\nsupported the measure with all his logic and eloquence, and it was his\r\naid extended to Clay that brought about the passage of the bill, all the\r\nsections becoming laws in September, 1850, and California, conquered\r\nfrom Mexico in 1846, took her place among the sisterhood of States.\r\nWebster's support of the fugitive slave law lost him many friends in the\r\nNorth, and, has been stated, rendered his election to the presidency\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1850, the remains from Kosciusko's tomb were\r\ndeposited in the monument in Washington, and President Taylor was\r\npresent at the ceremonies. The heat was terrific and caused him great\r\ndistress. On his return home he drank large quantities of ice-water and\r\nmilk, though he was warned against the danger of doing so. A fatal\r\nillness followed, and he died on the 9th of July. Vice-President\r\nFillmore was sworn into office on the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n(1800-1874.) One partial term, 1850-53.]\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore, the thirteenth President, was born at Summer Hill, New\r\nYork, February 7, 1800. He learned the fuller's trade, afterward taught\r\nschool, and, studying law, was admitted to the bar in Buffalo, where he\r\nattained marked success. He was State comptroller for one term and\r\nserved in Congress for four terms. He died in Buffalo, March 7, 1874.\r\nFillmore was a man of good ability, but the inferior of many of those\r\nwho preceded him in the exalted office. He was a believer in the\r\ncompromise measures of Clay, and performed his duties conscientiously\r\nand acceptably.\r\n\r\nFillmore's administration is notable for the fact that it saw the\r\npassing away of the foremost leaders, Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, with\r\nothers of less prominence. They were succeeded in Congress by the\r\nanti-slavery champions, William H. Seward, of New York; Charles Sumner,\r\nof Massachusetts; and Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio. From the South, too,\r\ncame able men, in Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi; John Y. Mason, of\r\nLouisiana; and others. The giants had departed and their mantles fell\r\nupon shoulders that were not always able to wear them as fittingly as\r\ntheir predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe slavery agitation produced its natural effect in driving many of the\r\nSouthern Whigs into the Democratic party, while a few Northern Democrats\r\nunited with the Whigs, who, however, were so disrupted that the\r\norganization crumbled to pieces after the presidential election of\r\n1852, and, for a time, no effective opposition to the Democratic party\r\nseemed possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEED OF A TRANS-CONTINENTAL RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1840 was 23,191,876. General\r\nprosperity prevailed, but all felt the urgent need of a railroad\r\nconnecting Missouri and California. The Pacific coast had become a\r\nleading part of the Union and its importance was growing every year. But\r\nthe building of such a railway, through thousands of miles of\r\nwilderness, across lofty mountains and large rivers, was an undertaking\r\nso gigantic and expensive as to be beyond the reach of private parties,\r\nwithout congressional assistance. Still all felt that the road must be\r\nbuilt, and, in 1853, Congress ordered surveys to be made in order to\r\nfind the best route. The building of the railway, however, did not begin\r\nuntil the War for the Union was well under way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1852.\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for presidential nominations, the Democratic\r\nconvention met in Baltimore, June 12, 1852. The most prominent\r\ncandidates were James Buchanan, Stephen A. Douglas, Lewis Cass, and\r\nWilliam L. Marcy. There was little variance in their strength for\r\nthirty-five ballots, and everybody seemed to be at sea, when the\r\nVirginia delegation, on the next ballot, presented the name of Franklin\r\nPierce of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Franklin Pierce?\" was the question that went round the hall,\r\nbut, on the forty-ninth ballot, he received 282 votes to 11 for all the\r\nothers, and the question was repeated throughout the United States.\r\nPierce's opponent was General Winfield Scott, the commander-in-chief in\r\nthe Mexican War, who had done fine service in the War of 1812, and ranks\r\namong the foremost military leaders of our country. But, personally, he\r\nwas unpopular, overbearing in his manners, a martinet, and without any\r\npersonal magnetism. No doubt he regarded it as an act of impertinence\r\nfor Pierce, who had been his subordinate in Mexico, to presume to pit\r\nhimself against him in the political field. But the story told by the\r\nNovember election was an astounding one and read as follows:\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce, of New Hampshire, Democrat, 254; Winfield Scott, of New\r\nJersey, Whig, 42; John P. Hale, of New Hampshire, Free Democrat, 0;\r\nDaniel Webster, of Massachusetts, Whig, 0. For Vice-President: William\r\nR. King, of Alabama, Democrat, 254; William A. Graham, of North\r\nCarolina, Whig, 42; George W. Julian, of Indiana, Free Democrat, 0.\r\n\r\nThe Whig convention which put Scott in nomination met also in Baltimore,\r\na few days after the Democratic convention. Webster was confident of\r\nreceiving the nomination, and it was the disappointment of his life\r\nthat he failed. The \"Free Democrats,\" who placed candidates in\r\nnomination, represented those who were dissatisfied with the various\r\ncompromise measures that had been adopted by Congress. The only States\r\ncarried by Scott were Vermont, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n(1804-1869.) One term, 1853-1857.]\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce, the fourteenth President, was born at Hillsborough, New\r\nHampshire, November 23, 1804. Upon his graduation from Bowdoin College,\r\nhe became a successful lawyer. He always showed a fondness for military\r\nmatters, though not to the extent of neglecting politics and his\r\nprofession. He was elected to his State Legislature and was a member of\r\nCongress from 1833 to 1837, and, entering the Senate in 1839, he\r\nremained until 1842, afterward declining a cabinet appointment from\r\nPresident Polk. He volunteered in the Mexican War, commanded a brigade,\r\nand showed great gallantry in several battles. He died October 8, 1869.\r\n\r\nMr. King, the Vice-President, was in such feeble health that he took the\r\noath of office in Cuba, and, returning to his native State, died April\r\n18, 1853, being the first vice-president to die in office. One\r\nremarkable fact should be stated regarding the administration of Pierce:\r\nthere was not a change in his cabinet throughout his whole term, the\r\nonly instance of the kind thus far in our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATY WITH JAPAN.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that until a few years, Japan was a closed nation to\r\nthe world. Its people refused to have anything to do with any other\r\ncountry, and wished nothing from them except to be let alone. In 1854,\r\nCommodore M.C. Perry visited Japan with an American fleet and induced\r\nthe government to make a commercial treaty with our own. This was the\r\nbeginning of the marvelous progress of that country in civilization and\r\neducation, which forms one of the most astonishing records in the\r\nhistory of mankind. Japan's overwhelming defeat of China, whose\r\npopulation is ten times as great as our own; her acceptance of the most\r\nadvanced ideas of civilization, and the wisdom of her rulers have\r\ncarried her in a few years to a rank among the leading powers and\r\njustified the appellation of the \"Yankees of the East,\" which is\r\nsometimes applied to her people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILIBUSTERING.\r\n\r\nPierce's administration was marked by a number of filibustering\r\nexpeditions against Spanish possessions in the West Indies. None of them\r\nsucceeded, and a number of the leaders were shot by the Spanish\r\nauthorities. The American government offered to purchase Cuba of Spain,\r\nbut that country indignantly replied that the mints of the world had not\r\ncoined enough gold to buy it. Could she have foreseen the events of\r\n1898, no doubt she would have sold out for a moderate price.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1854, President Pierce directed Mr. Buchanan, minister to\r\nEngland, Mr. Mason, minister to France, and Mr. Soule, envoy to Spain,\r\nto meet at some convenient place and discuss the question of obtaining\r\npossession of Cuba. These distinguished gentlemen met at Ostend on the\r\n9th of October, and adjourned to Aix-la-Chapelle, from which place they\r\nissued, on the 18th of October, what is known as the \"Ostend Manifesto\r\nor Circular,\" in which they recommended the purchase of Cuba, declaring\r\nthat, if Spain refused to sell, the United States would be justified \"by\r\nevery law, human and divine,\" in wresting it from her. This declaration,\r\nfor which there was no justification whatever, caused angry protest in\r\nEurope and in the free States of our country, but was ardently applauded\r\nin the South. Nothing came of it, and the country soon became so\r\nabsorbed in the slavery agitation that it was forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"KNOW NOTHINGS.\"\r\n\r\nPatriotic men, who feared what was coming, did all in their power to\r\navert it. One of these attempts was the formation of the \"Know Nothing\"\r\nparty, which grew up like a mushroom and speedily acquired a power that\r\nenabled it to carry many local elections in the various States. It was a\r\nsecret organization, the members of which were bound by oath to oppose\r\nthe election of foreign-born citizens to office. The salutation, when\r\none member met another, was, \"Have you seen Sam?\" If one of them was\r\nquestioned about the order, his reply was that he knew nothing, from\r\nwhich the name was given to what was really the Native American party.\r\nIt soon ran its course, but has been succeeded in its cardinal\r\nprinciples by the American Protective Association of the present day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the slavery question was busy at its work of disintegration.\r\nThe Democratic party was held together for a time by the Compromise of\r\n1850, to the effect that the inhabitants of the new Territories of New\r\nMexico and Utah should be left to decide for themselves the question of\r\nslavery. In a few years the settlements in Nebraska and Kansas made it\r\nnecessary to erect territorial governments there, and the question of\r\nslavery was thus brought before Congress again. The Missouri Compromise\r\nforbade slavery forever in those sections, for both of them lie to the\r\nnorth parallel of 36 deg. 30'. Stephen A. Douglas, however, and a number\r\nof other Democratic leaders in Congress claimed that the Compromise of\r\n1850 nullified this agreement, and that the same freedom of choice should\r\nbe given to the citizens of Kansas and Nebraska as was given to those in\r\nUtah and New Mexico. This policy was called \"Squatter Sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.\r\n\r\nThe bill was bitterly fought in Congress, but it passed the Senate by a\r\nvote of thirty-seven to fourteen, and after another fierce struggle was\r\nadopted in the House by a vote of 113 to 100. It received several\r\namendments, and the President signed it May 31, 1854. Thus the Missouri\r\nCompromise was repealed and the first note of civil war sounded. The\r\nquestion of slavery was opened anew, and could never be closed without\r\nthe shedding of blood to an extent that no one dreamed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\nThe advance agent of emancipation. (1793-1880.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the fugitive slave law was resisted in the North and\r\nnumerous conflicts took place. During the attempted arrest of Anthony\r\nBurns in Boston a deputy-sheriff was shot dead, and Federal troops from\r\nRhode Island had to be summoned before Burns could be returned to\r\nslavery. Former political opponents began uniting in both sections. In\r\nthe North the opponents of slavery, comprising Democrats, Free-Soilers,\r\nKnow Nothings, Whigs, and Abolitionists, joined in the formation of the\r\n\"Anti-Nebraska Men,\" and under that name they elected, in 1854, a\r\nmajority of the House of Representatives for the next Congress. Soon\r\nafter the election, the new organization took the name of Republicans,\r\nby which they are known to-day. Its members, with a few exceptions among\r\nthe Germans in Missouri and the Ohio settlers in western Virginia,\r\nbelonged wholly to the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR IN KANSAS.\r\n\r\nKansas became for the time the battle-ground between slavery and\r\nfreedom. Societies in the North sent emigrants into Kansas, first\r\nfurnishing them with Bibles and rifles, while the pro-slavery men\r\nswarmed thither from Missouri, and the two parties fought each other\r\nlike Apache Indians. In the midst of the civil war, a territorial\r\nlegislature was formed, and in many instances the majority of the\r\ncandidates elected was double that of the voting population in the\r\ndistrict. Governor A.H. Reeder, of Pennsylvania, had been appointed\r\ngovernor of the Territory, and, finding himself powerless to check the\r\nanarchy, went to Washington in April, 1855, to consult with the\r\ngovernment. While there he was nominated for Congress, and defeated by\r\nthe fraudulent votes of the pro-slavery men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY WARD BEECHER.\r\n\r\nThe Great Pulpit Orator and Anti-Slavery Agitator.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, two State governments had been formed. The pro-slavery men\r\nmet at Lecompton, in March, and adopted a Constitution permitting\r\nslavery. Their opponents assembled in Lawrence, August 15th, and elected\r\ndelegates, who came together in October and ratified the Topeka\r\nConstitution, which forbade slavery. In January, 1856, the people held\r\nan election under this Constitution. In the same month President Pierce\r\nsent a message to Congress, in which he declared the formation of a free\r\nState government in Kansas an act of rebellion, while that adopted at\r\nLecompton was the valid government. Governor Reeder was superseded by\r\nWilliam Shannon. A committee sent by Congress into the Territory to\r\ninvestigate and report could not agree, and nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nThe civil war grew worse. A free State government, with General Joseph\r\nLane as its head and supported by a well-armed force, was formed at\r\nLawrence. The town was sacked and almost destroyed, May 20, 1856. On the\r\n4th of July following, the free State Legislature was dispersed by\r\nFederal troops, upon order of the national government.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Geary now tried his hand as governor. His first step was to\r\ncall upon both parties to disarm, and neither paid any attention to\r\nhim. Finding he could not have the support of the President in the\r\nvigorous policy he wished to adopt, Governor Geary resigned and was\r\nsucceeded by Robert J. Walker of Mississippi. He showed a disposition to\r\nbe fair to all concerned, but, before he could accomplish anything, he\r\nwas turned out to make room for J.W. Denver. He was soon disgusted and\r\ngave way to Samuel Medary. Before long, it became evident that the\r\ninflux of northern settlers must overcome the pro-slavery men, and the\r\nstruggle was given up by the latter. A constitution prohibiting slavery\r\nwas ratified in 1859 and Charles Robinson elected governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLENT SCENES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nNebraska lies so far north that it was not disturbed. Acts of\r\ndisgraceful violence took place in Congress, challenges to duels being\r\nexchanged, personal collisions occurring on the floor, while most of the\r\nmembers went armed, not knowing what minute they would be assaulted. In\r\nMay, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts, for utterances made\r\nin debate, was savagely assaulted by Preston S. Brooks, of South\r\nCarolina, and received injuries from which he did not recover for\r\nseveral years. Brooks was lionized in the South for his brutal act and\r\nre-elected to Congress by an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party was growing rapidly in strength, and in 1856 it\r\nplaced its candidates in the field and astonished the rest of the\r\ncountry by the vote it rolled up, as shown in the following statistics:\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, Democrat, 174; John C. Fremont, of\r\nCalifornia, Republican, 114; Millard Fillmore, of New York, Native\r\nAmerican, 8. For Vice-President, John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky,\r\nDemocrat, 174; William L. Dayton, of New Jersey, Republican, 114; A.J.\r\nDonelson, of Tennessee, Native American, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n(1791-1868.) One term, 1857-1861.]\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, fifteenth President, was born in Mercersburg,\r\nPennsylvania, April 23, 1791, and graduated from Dickinson College in\r\n1809. He became a lawyer, was elected to the State Legislature and to\r\nCongress in 1821. Thenceforward, he was almost continuously in office.\r\nPresident Jackson appointed him minister to Russia in 1832, but, soon\r\nreturning home, he was elected to the United States Senate in 1834. He\r\nleft that body, in 1845, to become Polk's secretary of State. In 1853,\r\nhe was appointed minister to England, where he remained until his\r\nelection to the presidency in 1856. He died at his home in Lancaster,\r\nJune 1, 1868. The many honors conferred upon Buchanan prove his ability,\r\nthough he has been often accused of showing timidity during his term of\r\noffice, which was of the most trying nature. He was the only bachelor\r\namong our Presidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATES ADMITTED.\r\n\r\nMinnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858. It was a part of the\r\nLouisiana purchase. Troubles over the Indian titles delayed its\r\nsettlement until 1851, after which its growth was wonderfully rapid.\r\nOregon was admitted in 1859. The streams of emigration to California\r\noverflowed into Oregon, where some of the precious metal was found. It\r\nwas learned, however, in time that Oregon's most valuable treasure mine\r\nwas in her wheat, which is exported to all parts of the world. Kansas,\r\nof which we have given an account in the preceding pages, was quietly\r\nadmitted, directly after the seceding Senators abandoned their seats,\r\ntheir votes having kept it out up to that time. The population of the\r\nUnited States in 1860 was 31,443,321. Prosperity prevailed everywhere,\r\nand, but for the darkening shadows of civil war, the condition of no\r\npeople could have been more happy and promising.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRED SCOTT DECISION.\r\n\r\nDred Scott was the negro slave of Dr. Emerson, of Missouri, a surgeon in\r\nthe United States army. In the discharge of his duty, his owner took him\r\nto military posts in Illinois and Minnesota. Scott married a negro woman\r\nin Minnesota, and both were sold by Dr. Emerson upon his return to\r\nMissouri. The negro brought suit for his freedom on the ground that he\r\nhad been taken into territory where slavery was forbidden. The case\r\npassed through the various State courts, and, reaching the United States\r\nSupreme Court, that body made its decision in March, 1857.\r\n\r\nThis decision was to the effect that negro slaves were not citizens, and\r\nno means existed by which they could become such; they were simply\r\nproperty like household goods and chattels, and their owner could take\r\nthem into any State in the Union without forfeiting his ownership in\r\nthem. It followed also from this important decision that the Missouri\r\nCompromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850 were null and void, since\r\nit was beyond the power of the contracting parties to make such\r\nagreements. Six of the justices concurred in this decision and two\r\ndissented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCRETIA MOTT PROTECTING THE NEGRO DANGERFIELD FROM THE\r\nMOB IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nWhen Daniel Dangerfield, a fugitive slave, was tried in Philadelphia,\r\nLucretia Mott sat during all his trial by the side of the prisoner. When\r\nthe trial was ended Dangerfield was set at liberty, and Mrs. Mott walked\r\nout of the court-room and through the mob which threatened to lynch him,\r\nher hand on the colored man's arm, and that little hand was a sure\r\nprotector, for no one dared to touch him.]\r\n\r\nThis decision was received with delight in the South and repudiated in\r\nthe North. The contention there was that the Constitution regarded\r\nslaves as \"persons held to labor\" and not as property, and that they\r\nwere property only by State law.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BROWN'S RAID.\r\n\r\nWhile the chasm between the North and South was rapidly growing wider, a\r\nstartling occurrence took place. John Brown was a fanatic who believed\r\nHeaven had appointed him its agent for freeing the slaves in the South.\r\nHe was one of the most active partisans on the side of freedom in the\r\ncivil war in Kansas, and had been brooding over the subject for years,\r\nuntil his belief in his mission became unshakable.\r\n\r\nBrown's plan was simple, being that of invading Virginia with a small\r\narmed force and calling upon the slaves to rise. He believed they would\r\nflock around him, and he fixed upon Harper's Ferry as the point to begin\r\nhis crusade.\r\n\r\nSecretly gathering a band of twenty men, in the month of October, 1859,\r\nhe held them ready on the Maryland shore. Late on Sunday night, the\r\n16th, they crossed the railway bridge over the Potomac, seized the\r\nFederal armory at Harper's Ferry, stopped all railroad trains, arrested\r\na number of citizens, set free such slaves as they came across, and held\r\ncomplete possession of the town for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBrown acted with vigor. He threw out pickets, cut the telegraph wires,\r\nand sent word to the slaves that their day of deliverance had come and\r\nthey were summoned to rise. By this time the citizens had themselves\r\nrisen, and, attacking the invaders, drove them into the armory, from\r\nwhich they maintained fire until it became clear that they must succumb.\r\nSeveral made a break, but were shot down. Brown retreated to an\r\nengine-house with his wounded and prisoners and held his assailants at\r\nbay all through Monday and the night following.\r\n\r\nNews having been sent to Washington, Colonel Robert E. Lee arrived\r\nTuesday morning with a force of marines and land troops. The local\r\nmilitia of Virginia had also been called out. The situation of Brown was\r\nhopeless, but he refused to surrender. Colonel Lee managed matters with\r\nsuch skill that only one of his men was shot, while Brown was wounded\r\nseveral times, his two sons killed, and others slain. The door of the\r\nengine-house was battered in and the desperate men overpowered. The\r\nenraged citizens would have rended them to pieces, had they been\r\nallowed, but Colonel Lee protected and turned them over to the civil\r\nauthorities. Brown and his six companions were placed on trial, found\r\nguilty of what was certainly an unpardonable crime, and hanged on the 2d\r\nof December, 1859.\r\n\r\nMany in the South believed that the act of Brown was planned and\r\nsupported by leading Republicans, but such was not the fact, and they\r\nwere as earnest in condemnation of the mad proceeding as the extreme\r\nslavery men, but John Brown's raid served to fan the spark of civil war\r\nthat was already kindled and fast growing into a flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARPER'S FERRY]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1860.\r\n\r\nThe presidential campaigns that had been pressed heretofore with a\r\ncertain philosophic good nature, now assumed a tragic character. The\r\nSouth saw the growing preponderance of the North. New States were\r\ncontinually forming out of the enormous territory in the West, the\r\nopposition to slavery was intensifying, and its overthrow was certain.\r\nSenator Seward had announced the \"irrepressible conflict\" between\r\nfreedom and the institution, and the only remedy the South saw lay in\r\nsecession from the Union, for they loved that less than slavery. They\r\nannounced their unalterable intention of seceding in the event of the\r\nelection of a president of Republican principles. The Republicans placed\r\nAbraham Lincoln, of Illinois, in nomination. Jefferson Davis saw that\r\nthe only way of defeating him was by uniting all the opposing parties\r\ninto one. He urged such a union, but the elements would not fuse.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention assembled in Charleston in April, 1860, and\r\nhad hardly come together when the members began quarreling over slavery.\r\nSome of the radicals insisted upon the adoption of a resolution favoring\r\nthe opening of the slave trade, in retaliation for the refusal of the\r\nNorth to obey the fugitive slave law. This measure, however, was voted\r\ndown, and many were in favor of adopting compromises and making\r\nconcessions for the sake of the Union. Stephen A. Douglas was their\r\ncandidate, but no agreement could be made, and the convention split\r\napart. The extremists were not satisfied with \"squatter sovereignty,\"\r\nand, determined to prevent the nomination of Douglas, they withdrew from\r\nthe convention. Those who remained, after balloting some time without\r\nresult, adjourned to Baltimore, where, on the 18th of June, they placed\r\nDouglas in nomination, with Herschel V. Johnson as the nominee for\r\nVice-President. Their platform was the doctrine that the people of each\r\nTerritory should settle the question of slavery for themselves, but they\r\nexpressed a willingness to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe seceding delegates adjourned to Richmond, and again to Baltimore,\r\nwhere, June 28th, they nominated John C. Breckinridge for President and\r\nJoseph Lane for Vice-President. Their platform declared unequivocally in\r\nfavor of slavery being protected in all parts of the Union, where the\r\nowners chose to take their slaves.\r\n\r\nThe American party, which called themselves Constitutional Unionists,\r\nhad already met in Baltimore, and nominated John Bell for President and\r\nEdward Everett for Vice-President. Their platform favored the\r\n\"Constitution, the Union, and the enforcement of the laws.\" This\r\nplatform was of the milk-and-water variety, appealing too weakly to the\r\nfriends and opponents of slavery to develop great strength. The question\r\nof African slavery had become the burning one before the country, and\r\nthe people demanded that the political platforms should give out no\r\nuncertain sound.\r\n\r\nAmid uncontrollable excitement, the presidential election took place\r\nwith the following result:\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, of Illinois, Republican, 180; Stephen A. Douglas, of\r\nIllinois, Democrat, 12; John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, Democrat, 72;\r\nJohn Bell, of Tennessee, Union, 39. For Vice-President: Hannibal Hamlin,\r\nof Maine, Republican, 180; Herschel V. Johnson, of Georgia, Democrat,\r\n12; Joseph Lane, of Oregon, Democrat, 72; Edward Everett, of\r\nMassachusetts, Union, 39.\r\n\r\nOn the popular vote, Lincoln received 866,352; Douglas, 1,375,157;\r\nBreckinridge, 845,763; Bell, 589,581. Lincoln had the electoral votes of\r\nall the Northern States, except a part of New Jersey; Virginia,\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee supported Bell, while most of the Southern\r\nStates voted for Breckinridge. The Democratic party, which, with the\r\nexception of the break in 1840 and 1848, had controlled the country for\r\nsixty years, was now driven from the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECESSION AND FORMATION OF THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nThe hope was general that the South would not carry out her threat of\r\nseceding from the Union, and, but for South Carolina, she would not have\r\ndone so; but that pugnacious State soon gave proof of her terrible\r\nearnestness. Her Convention assembled in Charleston, and passed an\r\nordinance of secession, December 20, 1860, declaring \"That the Union\r\nheretofore existing between this State and the other States of North\r\nAmerica is dissolved.\" The other Southern States, although reluctant to\r\ngive up the Union, felt it their duty to stand by the pioneer in the\r\nmovement against it, and passed ordinances of secession, as follows:\r\nMississippi, January 9, 1861; Florida, January 10th; Alabama, January\r\n11th; Georgia, January 19th; Louisiana, January 26th; and Texas,\r\nFebruary 23d.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of averting civil war numerous peace meetings were held in\r\nthe North, and Virginia called for a \"peace conference,\" which assembled\r\nin Washington, February 4th. The States represented included most of\r\nthose in the North, and Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri. Ex-President Tyler, of Virginia, was\r\nmade president of the conference. The proposed terms of settlement were\r\nrejected by the Virginia and North Carolina delegates and refused by\r\nCongress, which, since the withdrawal of the Southern members, was\r\ncontrolled by the Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe next step of the Southern conventions was to send delegates to\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, where they formed \"The Confederate States of\r\nAmerica,\" with Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, President, and Alexander\r\nH. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President. A constitution and flag, both\r\nresembling those of the United States, were adopted and all departments\r\nof the government organized.\r\n\r\nAs the various States adopted ordinances of secession they seized the\r\ngovernment property within their limits. In most cases, the Southern\r\nUnited States officers resigned and accepted commissions in the service\r\nof the Confederacy. The only forts saved were those near Key West, Fort\r\nPickens at Pensacola, and Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. The South\r\nCarolina authorities began preparations to attack Sumter, and when the\r\nsteamer _Star of the West_ attempted to deliver supplies to the fort, it\r\nwas fired upon, January 9th, and driven off. Thus matters stood at the\r\nclose of Buchanan's administration, March 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF LINCOLN, 1861-1865.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR THE UNION, 1861.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln--Major Anderson's Trying Position--Jefferson\r\nDavis--Inauguration of President Lincoln--Bombardment of Fort\r\nSumter--War Preparations North and South--Attack on Union Troops in\r\nBaltimore--Situation of the Border States--Unfriendliness of England and\r\nFrance--Friendship of Russia--The States that Composed the Southern\r\nConfederacy--Union Disaster at Big Bethel--Success of the Union Campaign\r\nin Western Virginia--General George B.

He was born in Hardin\r\n(now Larue) County, Kentucky, February 12, 1809, but when seven years\r\nold his parents removed to Indiana, making their home near the present\r\ntown of Gentryville.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(1809-1865.) Two terms (died in office), 1861-1865.]\r\n\r\nHis early life was one of extreme poverty, and his whole schooling did\r\nnot amount to more than a year; but, possessing a studious mind, he\r\nimproved every spare hour in the study of instructive books. At the age\r\nof sixteen the tall, awkward, but powerful boy was earning a living by\r\nmanaging a ferry across the Ohio. He remained for some time after\r\nreaching manhood with his parents, who removed to Illinois in 1830, and\r\nbuilt a log-cabin on the north fork of the Sangamon. He was able to give\r\nvaluable help in clearing the ground and in splitting rails. With the\r\naid of a few friends he constructed a flat-boat, with which he took\r\nproduce to New Orleans. Selling both goods and boat, he returned to his\r\nhome and still assisted his father on the farm. In the Black Hawk War he\r\nwas elected captain of a company, but did not see active service.\r\n\r\nBy this time his ability had attracted the notice of friends, and at the\r\nage of twenty-five he was elected to the Illinois Legislature, in which\r\nhe served for four terms. Meanwhile he had studied law as opportunity\r\npresented, and was sent to Congress in 1846. He opposed the war with\r\nMexico, but, among such giants as Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Benton, and\r\nothers, he could not make any distinctive mark; but his powerful common\r\nsense, his clear logic, his unassailable integrity, his statesmanship\r\nand grasp of public questions, and his quaint humor, often approaching\r\nthe keenest wit, carried him rapidly to the front and made him the\r\nleader of the newly formed Republican party. In 1858 he stumped Illinois\r\nfor United States senator against Stephen A. Douglas, his valued friend.\r\nHis speeches attracted national attention as masterpieces of eloquence,\r\nwit, and forceful presentation of the great issues which were then\r\nagitating the country. He was defeated by Douglas, but the remarkable\r\nmanner in which he acquitted himself made him the successful candidate\r\nof the Republican party in the autumn of 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM LOG-CABIN TO THE WHITE HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nLincoln was tall and ungainly, his height being six feet four inches.\r\nHis countenance was rugged and homely, his strength as great as that of\r\nWashington, while his wit has become proverbial. His integrity, which\r\nhis bitterest opponent never questioned, won for him the name of\r\n\"Honest Abe.\" He was one of the most kind-hearted of men, and his rule\r\nof life was \"malice toward none and charity for all\". He grew with the\r\ndemands of the tremendous responsibilities placed upon him, and the\r\nreputation he won as patriot, statesman, and leader has been surpassed\r\nby no previous President and becomes greater with the passing years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR ANDERSON AND FORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned toward Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. It was the\r\nstrongest of the defenses. Major Robert Anderson, learning that the\r\nConfederates intended to take possession of it, secretly removed his\r\ngarrison from Fort Moultrie on the night of December 26, 1860. Anderson\r\nwas in a trying position, for the secretary of war, Floyd, and the\r\nadjutant-general of the army, Cooper, to whom he was obliged to report,\r\nwere secessionists, and not only refused to give him help, but threw\r\nevery obstacle in his way. President Buchanan was surrounded by\r\nsecessionists, and most of the time was bewildered as to his course of\r\nduty. He resented, however, the demand of Secretary Floyd for the\r\nremoval of Anderson because of the change he had made from Moultrie to\r\nSumter. Floyd resigned and was succeeded by Joseph Holt, of Kentucky, an\r\nuncompromising Unionist, who did all he could to hold up the President\r\nin his tottering position of a friend of the Union. The latter grew\r\nstronger as he noted the awakening sentiment of loyalty throughout the\r\nNorth. An admirable act was the appointment of Edwin M. Stanton as\r\nattorney-general, for he was a man of great ability and a relentless\r\nenemy of secession.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS.]\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, who had been chosen President of the Southern\r\nConfederacy that was formed at Montgomery, Alabama, early in February,\r\nwas born in Kentucky, June 3, 1808. Thus he and President Lincoln were\r\nnatives of the same State, with less than a year's difference in their\r\nages. Davis was graduated at West Point in 1828, and served on the\r\nnorthwest frontier, in the Black Hawk War. He was also a lieutenant of\r\ncavalry in the operations against the Comanches and Apaches. He resigned\r\nfrom the army and became a cotton-planter in Mississippi, which State he\r\nrepresented in Congress in 1845-46, but resigned to assume the colonelcy\r\nof the First Mississippi regiment.\r\n\r\nColonel Davis displayed great gallantry at the storming of Monterey and\r\nat the battle at Buena Vista, and on his return home was immediately\r\nelected to the United States Senate, in which he served 1847-51 and\r\n1857-61. From 1853 to 1857 he was secretary of war under Pierce. He was\r\none of the Southern leaders, and had already been mentioned as a\r\ncandidate for the presidency. He resigned his seat in the United States\r\nSenate in January, 1861, upon the secession of his State, and, being\r\nelected Provisional President of the Southern Confederacy February 9th,\r\nwas inaugurated February 18th. In the following year he and Stephens\r\nwere regularly elected President and Vice-President respectively, and\r\nwere inaugurated on the 18th of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Lincoln left his home in Springfield, Illinois, on the\r\n11th of February for Washington. He stopped at various points on the\r\nroute, and addressed multitudes that had gathered to see and hear him. A\r\nplot was formed to assassinate him in Baltimore, but it was defeated by\r\nthe vigilance of the officers attending Lincoln, who took him through\r\nthe city on an earlier train than was expected. General Scott had the\r\ncapital so well protected by troops that no disturbance took place\r\nduring the inauguration.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBARDMENT OF FORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate government sent General Beauregard to assume charge of\r\nthe defenses in Charleston harbor. Finding the fort was being furnished\r\nwith supplies, he telegraphed to his government for instructions. He was\r\nordered to enforce the evacuation. Beauregard demanded the surrender of\r\nthe fort, and, being refused by Major Anderson, he opened fire, early on\r\nthe morning of April 12th, from nineteen batteries. Major Anderson had a\r\ngarrison of 79 soldiers and 30 laborers who helped serve the guns. He\r\nallowed the men to eat breakfast before replying. In a few hours the\r\nsupply of cartridges gave out, and blankets and other material were used\r\nas substitutes. The garrison were kept within the bomb-proof galleries,\r\nand did not serve the guns on the open parapets, two of which had been\r\ndismounted by the fire from the Confederate batteries, which after a\r\ntime set fire to the officers' barracks. The flames were extinguished,\r\nbut broke out several times. The smoke became so smothering that the\r\nmen could breathe only by lying flat on their faces. Finally the\r\nposition became so untenable that Anderson ran up the white flag in\r\ntoken of surrender. No one was killed on either side.\r\n\r\nThe news of the surrender created wild excitement North and South and\r\nunited both sections. While the free States rallied to the Union, almost\r\nas one man, the Unionists in the South became ardent supporters of the\r\ncause of disunion. It was now a solid North against a solid South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT MOULTRIE, CHARLESTON, WITH FORT SUMTER IN THE\r\nDISTANCE.]\r\n\r\nThree days after the surrender of Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called\r\nfor 75,000 volunteers to serve for three months, and Congress was\r\nsummoned to meet on the 4th of July. Few people comprehended the\r\nstupendous work that would be required to crush the rebellion. While the\r\nSouth was hurrying its sons into the ranks, 300,000 answered the call of\r\nPresident Lincoln, who on the 19th of April issued another proclamation\r\ndeclaring a blockade of the Southern ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION TROOPS ATTACKED IN BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\nMany of the Confederates demanded that an advance should be made upon\r\nWashington, and, had it been done promptly, it could have been captured\r\nwithout difficulty. Realizing its danger, the national government called\r\nupon the States for troops and several regiments were hurried thither.\r\nWhile the Seventh Pennsylvania and Sixth Massachusetts were passing\r\nthrough Baltimore, they were savagely assailed by a mob. A portion of\r\nthe Sixth Massachusetts were hemmed in, and stoned and pelted with\r\npistol-shots. They remained cool until three of their number had been\r\nkilled and eight wounded, when they let fly with a volley which\r\nstretched nearly a dozen rioters on the ground, besides wounding many\r\nothers. This drove the mob back, although they kept up a fusillade until\r\nthe train drew out of the city with the troops aboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITY OF THE CONFEDERATES.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates in Virginia continued active. They captured Harper's\r\nFerry and the Norfolk Navy Yard, both of which proved very valuable to\r\nthem. Their government issued \"letters of marque\" which permitted\r\nprivate persons to capture merchant vessels belonging to the United\r\nStates, against which the Confederate Congress declared war.\r\n\r\nThe border States were in perhaps the most trying situation of all, for,\r\nwhile they wished to keep out of the war, they were forced to act the\r\npart of buffer between the hostile States. The secessionists in\r\nMaryland, Kentucky, and Missouri made determined efforts to bring about\r\nthe secession of those States, but the Union men were too strong. The\r\narmies on both sides received many recruits from the States named, which\r\nin some cases suffered from guerrilla fighting between former friends\r\nand neighbors.\r\n\r\nKentucky, whose governor was a secessionist, thought she could hold a\r\nneutral position, but the majority of the citizens were Union in their\r\nsentiments. Besides, the situation of the State was such that it was\r\nsoon invaded by armed forces from both sides, and some of the severest\r\nbattles of the war were fought on its soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AS VIEWED IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of the splitting apart of the United States was pleasing to\r\nall the European powers, with the single exception of Russia. France was\r\nespecially urgent in favoring an armed intervention in favor of the\r\nConfederacy, but England would not agree, nor would she recognize the\r\nConfederate States as an independent nation, for, had she done so, the\r\nUnited States would immediately have declared war against her. In May,\r\nhowever, England declared the Confederacy a belligerent power, thereby\r\nentitling it to make war and man war vessels, which could take refuge in\r\nforeign ports. While this recognition was of unquestionable help, it\r\nwould not have amounted to a great deal had not England permitted the\r\nbuilding of swift and powerful cruisers, which were turned over to the\r\nConfederates, and did immense damage to Northern commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen June arrived, the Southern Confederacy was composed of eleven\r\nStates: South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. As soon\r\nas Virginia seceded (May 23d), the capital was removed from Montgomery\r\nto Richmond. It was clear that Virginia would be the principal\r\nbattle-ground of the war, and the Confederate volunteers throughout the\r\nSouth hurried into the State.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent knowledge of the direction from which danger was likely\r\nto come was shown by the placing of troops in western Virginia to meet\r\nConfederate attacks, while soldiers were moved into southern Kentucky to\r\ndefend Tennessee. In Virginia they held the line from Harper's Ferry to\r\nNorfolk, and batteries were built along the Mississippi to stop all\r\nnavigation of that stream. The erection of forts along the Atlantic and\r\nGulf coasts for protection against the blockading fleets soon walled in\r\nthe Confederacy on every hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY SITUATION.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott for a time held the general command of all the United\r\nStates forces. But he was old and growing weak in body and mind, and it\r\nwas evident must soon give way to a younger man. The national forces\r\nheld the eastern side of the Potomac, from Harper's Ferry to Fort\r\nMonroe, and a small section of the western side opposite Washington.\r\nWhile enlisting and drilling troops, they strove to hold also Kentucky\r\nand Missouri, succeeding so well that their grip was never lost\r\nthroughout the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SKIRMISHER.]\r\n\r\nWith the opposing forces face to face, continual skirmishing was kept\r\nup. This had no effect on the war itself, but was expressive of the\r\nmartial spirit which animated both sides. General B.F. Butler, who had\r\ngreat executive but slight military ability, was in command at Fort\r\nMonroe. While there he refused to surrender a number of fugitive slaves\r\nthat had fled into his lines, declaring them \"contraband of war.\" The\r\nphrase was a happy one and caught the fancy of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION DISASTER AT BIG BETHEL.\r\n\r\nButler fortified Newport News, which is a point of land at the junction\r\nof the James River and Hampton Roads. Fifteen miles away was a\r\nConfederate detachment, on the road to Yorktown, where the main body was\r\nunder the command of General J.B. Magruder, a former artillery officer\r\nof the United States army. The Confederate position at Big Bethel was a\r\nstrong one and had a garrison of more than a thousand troops. A short\r\ndistance in front was Little Bethel, where a small detachment was under\r\nthe command of Colonel D.H. Hill, also a former member of the United\r\nStates army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pierce advanced to the attack early on the morning of June 9th.\r\nThe two columns mistook each other, and not until 10 men were killed was\r\nthe sad blunder discovered. An assault quickly followed, but the\r\nassailants were defeated with the loss of 14 killed and 49 wounded.\r\nAmong the slain was Lieutenant John T. Greble, a brilliant West Point\r\nofficer, who ought to have been in command of the brigade, with which he\r\ndoubtless would have achieved a success. The incompetency of the\r\npolitical leader cost dearly, but the government was yet to learn that\r\nfull-fledged officers are not to be found among men who have made\r\npolitics their life profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL UNION CAMPAIGN IN WESTERN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThe only place where there were any Union successes was in western\r\nVirginia. Colonel Wallace with a detachment of Indiana Zouaves--a\r\nfavorite form of military troops at the beginning of the war--made a\r\nforced march at night over a mountain road, from Cumberland, in\r\nMaryland, to Romney, where the Confederates had a battery on a bluff\r\nnear the village, guarded by a number of field-pieces. By a spirited\r\ndash, the Union troops captured the position and drove the defenders\r\ninto the woods. Unable to overtake them, Colonel Wallace returned to\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\nThis incident had important results. General Jo Johnston, one of the\r\nbest commanders of the war, was at Harper's Ferry, and, fearing for his\r\ncommunications, he evacuated the post, and marched up the Shenandoah\r\nValley to a point near Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nThe operations in western Virginia brought into prominence an officer\r\nwho was destined to play an important part in the war. He was George B.\r\nMcClellan, born in Philadelphia in 1826, and graduated at West Point in\r\n1846. He rendered fine service in the Mexican War, after which,\r\nresigning from the army, he was for several years engineer for the\r\nIllinois Central Railroad and afterward a railroad president. He was\r\nappointed a major-general at the opening of the Civil War, and, with\r\n15,000 troops, mostly from the Western States, he advanced against the\r\nConfederates in western Virginia under the command of General Garnett,\r\nalso a graduate and formerly an instructor at West Point. Garnett held a\r\nposition west of the principal line of the Alleghanies, which covered\r\nthe road leading from Philippi to Beverly. Colonel Pegram was placed in\r\ncharge of the hill Rich Mountain, a short distance south of Garnett.\r\n\r\nMcClellan advanced against these two positions. Colonel Rosecrans, with\r\nfour regiments and in the face of a blinding rainstorm, followed a\r\ncircuitous path through the woods, and charged up the elevation against\r\na strong fire. The Confederates were driven from their position and down\r\nthe other side of the hill. Colonel Pegram, finding his position turned,\r\nretreated in the direction of Beverly. Rosecrans pursued and Garnett\r\nturned to the north, aiming for St. George on the Cheat River. Pegram\r\nhad surrendered with 600 men, the remainder joining Garnett, who was\r\nhard pressed by General Morris. Despite the obstructions thrown in his\r\npath, he overtook the fugitives on the 13th of July at Carrick's Ford on\r\nthe Cheat River. There the Confederates were routed and Garnett shot\r\ndead at the head of his troops. The remnant of his force fled in\r\ndisorder, and succeeded in reaching Monterey on the eastern side of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n(1826-1885).]\r\n\r\nThe campaign in western Virginia was a brilliant Union success. A\r\nthousand prisoners, seven guns, 1,500 stands of arms, and twelve colors\r\nwere captured, with slight loss to the victors. All the credit of this\r\nsuccess was given to McClellan, and, since the North was yearning for\r\nsome leader with the halo of success attached to his name, they at once\r\nproclaimed \"Little Mac\" as their idol, destined to crush secession and\r\nre-establish the Union in all its strength and former glory.\r\n\r\nIn September General Robert E. Lee was sent into western Virginia to\r\nregain the ground lost, but he failed and was driven out of the section\r\nby Rosecrans, the successor of McClellan. Before this took place,\r\nhowever, the opening battle of the war had been fought elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ON TO RICHMOND!\"\r\n\r\nThe removal of the Confederate government from Montgomery to Richmond\r\nwas unbearably exasperating to the North. It may be said that the\r\nsecession flag was flaunted in sight of Washington. The New York\r\n_Tribune_, the most influential journal of the North, raised the cry\r\n\"_On to Richmond_!\" and the pressure became so clamorous and persistent\r\nthat the government, although conscious of the risk of the step, ordered\r\nan advance against the Confederate capital. Congress, which had met July\r\n4th, appropriated $500,000,000 for carrying on the war, and authorized\r\nPresident Lincoln to call out 500,000 volunteers for crushing the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Union army across the Potomac from Washington numbered about 40,000\r\nmen and was under the command of General Irvin McDowell. It was only\r\npartly disciplined, had a few good and many incompetent officers, was\r\ncomposed of fine material, but of necessity lacked the steadiness which\r\ncan only be acquired by actual campaigns and fighting.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard, with a Confederate army not quite so numerous, held\r\na strong military position near Manassas Junction, some thirty miles\r\nfrom Washington, and connected with Richmond by rail. General Jo\r\nJohnston had a smaller Confederate army at Winchester, it being his duty\r\nto hold General Patterson in check and prevent his reinforcing McDowell.\r\nAt the same time Patterson, to prevent Johnston from joining Beauregard,\r\nplanned an offensive movement against the Confederate commander at\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTLE OF BULL RUN.\r\n\r\nMcDowell's plan was to advance to Fairfax Court-House, and then, turning\r\nsouth, cut Beauregard's communications. The first movement was made on\r\nthe afternoon of July 16th. General Mansfield with 16,000 men remained\r\nin Washington to protect the capital from surprise. The advance was\r\nslow, occupying several days. McDowell discovered six Confederate\r\nbrigades posted along the creek known as Bull Run, and he decided to\r\nbegin his attack upon them. While General Tyler was sent across the\r\nstone bridge to threaten the Confederate front, Hunter and Heintzelman\r\nwere directed to make a detour and attack the enemy's front and rear.\r\nJohnston, who had hurried up from Winchester, had decided to hasten the\r\nbattle through fear of the arrival of Patterson with reinforcements for\r\nMcDowell, but the latter, moving first, Johnston was compelled to act on\r\nthe defensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST BATTLE OF BULL RUN, 1861\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1861, the first great battle of the Civil War was fought,\r\nresulting in the complete defeat of the Union army, which fled in panic\r\nfrom the field. Had the Confederates followed up the pursuit they could\r\neasily have captured Washington city. The total loss to the Union army\r\nin killed, wounded, captured and missing was 3,334 men; that of the\r\nSouthern army, 1,982. The Confederates gained another victory at Bull\r\nRun in 1862.]\r\n\r\nTyler and Hunter were tardy in their movements, but by noon McDowell had\r\nturned the Confederate left and uncovered the stone bridge. Instead of\r\nusing the advantage thus secured and assuming position at Manassas\r\ndepot, he kept up his pursuit of the fleeing Confederates to the woods.\r\nThere, when everything seemed to be going the way of the Union array, it\r\nwas checked by General T.J. Jackson's brigade, whose firm stand in the\r\nface of seeming disaster won for him the soubriquet of \"Stonewall\"\r\nJackson, first uttered in compliment by General Bee, by which name the\r\nremarkable man will always be remembered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF McCLELLAN IN CITY HALL SQUARE, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThe stand of Jackson enabled Johnston to rally the right and Beauregard\r\nthe left, but matters were in a critical shape, when Kirby Smith, who\r\nhad escaped Patterson in the valley, rushed across the fields from\r\nManassas with 15,000 fresh troops. This timely arrival turned, the\r\nfortunes of the day. McDowell was driven from the plateau he had\r\noccupied, and the whole Union army was thrown into a panic and rushed in\r\nheadlong flight for the defenses of Washington. Nothing could stay their\r\nflight, and the city was overrun with the terrified fugitives, who\r\nswarmed into the railroad trains, fled to the open fields beyond,\r\nspreading the most frightful rumors, while many did not believe\r\nthemselves safe until at home in the North.\r\n\r\nHad the Confederates followed up the pursuit, they could have easily\r\ncaptured Washington. They failed to do so, because they did not know\r\nhow beaten and disorganized the Union forces were. The Union losses in\r\nthis first great battle of the war were: Killed, 470; wounded, 1,071;\r\ncaptured and missing, 1,793; total, 3,334. The Confederate losses were:\r\nKilled, 387; wounded, 1,582; captured and missing, 13; total, 1,982.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN APPOINTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\r\nBull Run was a bitter humiliation for the North, but it served a good\r\npurpose. The national government understood for the first time the\r\nformidable nature of the task before it. Its determination to subdue the\r\nrebellion was intensified rather than lessened, but it now went about it\r\nin the right way. Incompetent officers were weeded out, careful and\r\nvigorous measures set on foot, and, what was the most popular movement\r\nof all, General McClellan was called to the command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac. He took charge August 20th, and set about organizing and\r\ndisciplining the magnificent body of men. No one could surpass him at\r\nsuch work, and he had the opportunity of establishing himself as the\r\nidol of the nation. That he failed to do so was clue to an inherent\r\ndefect of his nature. He shrank from taking chances, lacked nerve and\r\ndash, distrusted himself, and was so slow and excessively cautious that\r\nhe wore out the patience of the government and finally of the nation\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott's old age and increasing infirmities compelled him in\r\nNovember to give up the command of the Union armies, and all hopes\r\ncentred upon McClellan. He kept drilling the Army of the Potomac, and by\r\nthe close of the year had 150,000 well-trained soldiers under his\r\ncommand. The impatience of the North began to manifest itself, but no\r\ngeneral advance took place, though the Confederate line was gradually\r\npushed back from its threatening position in front of Washington to its\r\nfirst position at Bull Run. The Confederacy was also busy in recruiting\r\nand drilling its forces. Knowing that Richmond was the objective point\r\nof the Union advance, the city was surrounded with formidable\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISASTER AT BALL'S BLUFF.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October General McCall was ordered to occupy\r\nDrainesville, eighteen miles northwest of Washington. At the same time,\r\nGeneral Stone was directed to keep watch of Leesburg, from which the\r\npatrols afterward reported a weak Confederate force. An advance was\r\nordered, whereupon Colonel Evans, who had given the Confederates great\r\nhelp at Bull Run, concentrated his forces on the road leading from\r\nLeesburg to Washington, and, on the morning of the 21st, had assumed a\r\nstrong position and was ready to be attacked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTIFYING RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground we see R.E. Lee and two other confederate officers\r\ndirecting the work.]\r\n\r\nThe Union troops were ferried across the river in three scows, two\r\nskiffs, and a life-boat, which combined would not carry one-fourth of\r\nthe men. When all were over they advanced to Leesburg, where no\r\nConfederate camp was found, but the enemy in the woods attacked them.\r\nColonel E.D. Baker, a civilian officer from California, hurried across\r\nthe river with 1,900 men and took command. The enemy was reinforced and\r\ndrove the Unionists back. Colonel Baker was killed and the Federals\r\nfled in a panic to the Potomac, with the Confederates upon them. The\r\nfugitives swarmed into the boats and sank three of them; others leaped\r\nover the bank and swam and dived for their lives, the enemy shooting and\r\nbayoneting all who did not surrender. When the horrible affair was over,\r\nthe Union loss was fully a thousand men. This occurrence was in some\r\nrespects more disgraceful than Bull Run.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nClaiborne F. Jackson, governor of Missouri, was a strong secessionist,\r\nand did all he could to take the State out of the Union, but the\r\nsentiment against him was too strong. St. Louis was also secession in\r\nfeeling, but Captain Nathaniel Lyon kept the disloyalists in subjection\r\nso effectively that he was rewarded by being made a brigadier-general.\r\nGovernor Jackson by proclamation called out 50,000 of the State militia\r\nto repel the \"invasion\" of the State by United States troops. Sterling\r\nPrice, a major-general of the State forces, was dispatched to Booneville\r\nand Lexington, on the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nColonel Franz Sigel, with 1,100 Union troops, had an engagement in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the State and was compelled to retreat, but he\r\nmanaged his withdrawal so skillfully that he killed and wounded a large\r\nnumber of his pursuers. General Lyon joined Sigel near Springfield, and\r\nthe Confederates, under General Ben McCulloch, retreated to Cowskin\r\nPrairie, on the border of the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF WILSON'S CREEK.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were reinforced, the Unionists being under the command of\r\nGeneral John C. Fremont, who had been assigned to the department of the\r\nWest, which included Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. The two\r\narmies met early in August near Wilson's Creek. The Confederates were\r\nthe most numerous, but were poorly armed and disciplined. The battle was\r\nbadly mismanaged by both sides, and General Lyon, while leading a\r\ncharge, was shot dead. His men were defeated and retreated in the\r\ndirection of Springfield.\r\n\r\nMissouri was now overrun with guerrillas and harried by both sides.\r\nColonel Mulligan made a desperate stand at Lexington in September, but\r\nan overwhelming force under General Price compelled him to surrender.\r\nPrice moved southward and Lexington was retaken by the Unionists, who\r\nalso occupied Springfield. The Legislature sitting at Neocho passed an\r\nordinance of secession, but most of the State remained in the hands of\r\nthe Federals until they finally gained entire possession.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont's course was unwise and made him unpopular. He issued\r\nwhat was in reality an emancipation proclamation, which President\r\nLincoln was compelled to modify. He was fond of show and ceremony, and\r\nso extravagant that he was superseded in November by General Hunter,\r\nwho was soon sent to Kansas, and was in turn succeeded by General\r\nHalleck. The fighting in the State was fierce but of an indecisive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe expected neutrality of Kentucky was speedily ended by the entrance\r\nof a body of Confederates under the command of General Leonidas Polk, a\r\ngraduate of West Point and a bishop of the Episcopal Church. General\r\nU.S. Grant was dispatched with a force from Cairo, as soon as it became\r\nknown that Polk had entered Kentucky. Grant destroyed a Confederate camp\r\nat Belmont, but was attacked by Polk and compelled to retreat to his\r\ngunboats.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS ON THE COAST.\r\n\r\nA formidable coast expedition, with land and naval forces on board,\r\nunder command of General B.F. Butler and Commodore Stringham, in August,\r\n1861, captured Hatteras Inlet and the fort defending it. Establishing\r\nthemselves at that point, they made other attacks along the adjoining\r\ncoast of North Carolina. A still larger expedition left Fort Monroe in\r\nNovember under Commodore Dupont and General T.W. Sherman and captured\r\nPort Royal. The fleet was so powerful, numbering nearly one hundred\r\nvessels and transports, that the garrisons were easily driven out of the\r\nforts, after which the land forces took possession of them. The islands\r\nbetween Charleston and Savannah were seized, and in September a Union\r\nfleet took possession of Ship Island, not far from the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, with a view of aiding an expedition against New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRENT AFFAIR.\r\n\r\nIt was all important for the Confederacy to secure recognition from\r\nEngland and France. The Confederate government thought they could be\r\ninduced to act, if the proper arguments were laid before the respective\r\ngovernments. Accordingly, James M. Mason, of Virginia, and John Slidell,\r\nof Louisiana, both of whom had been United States senators, were\r\nappointed commissioners, the former to England and the latter to France.\r\n\r\nThey succeeded in running the blockade to Havana, where they took\r\npassage on the British steamer _Trent_ for England. Captain Charles\r\nWilkes, of the steamer _San Jacinto_, knew of their intended sailing and\r\nwas on the lookout for them. Before they were fairly on their way,\r\nCaptain Wilkes stopped the _Trent_, and, despite the protests of the\r\ncaptain and the rebel commissioners, he forcibly took them off and\r\ncarried them to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn acting thus Captain Wilkes did the very thing that caused the war\r\nwith England in 1812. It was our opposition to the search of American\r\nvessels by British cruisers that caused that war, while England was as\r\npersistent in her claim to the right to make such search. The positions\r\nwere now reversed, and England expressed indignation, and demanded the\r\nreturn of the commissioners and a disavowal of the act of Captain\r\nWilkes. The position of our government was untenable, and Secretary\r\nSeward gracefully confessed it, and surrendered the prisoners, neither\r\nof whom was able afterward to be of the slightest benefit to the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE YEAR'S OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe close of 1861 was to the advantage of the Confederates. The two real\r\nbattles of the war--Bull Run and Wilson's Creek--had been won by them.\r\nIn the lesser engagements, with the exception of West Virginia, they had\r\nalso been successful. This was due to the fact that the people of the\r\nNorth and West had been so long at peace that they needed time in which\r\nto learn war. In the South the men were more accustomed to the handling\r\nof firearms and horseback riding. Moreover, they were on the defensive,\r\nand fighting, as may be said, on inner lines.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that the Union forces had saved\r\nKentucky, Maryland, and Missouri from joining the Confederacy, despite\r\nthe strenuous efforts of their disunion governors and an aggressive\r\nminority in each State. Washington, which more than once had been in\r\ndanger of capture, was made safe, and the loyal section of Virginia in\r\nthe West was cut off and formed into a separate State. In wealth and\r\nresources the North vastly preponderated. An immense army had been\r\nraised, money was abundant, commerce thriving, the sentiment\r\noverwhelmingly in favor of the prosecution of the war, and the\r\nmanufactories hummed with work made necessary by the building of\r\nhundreds of ships for the navy and the furnishing of supplies and\r\nequipments to the armies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ATTACK ON FORT DONELSON.\r\n\r\nThis memorable battle of February, 1862, was the first serious blow to\r\nthe Confederate cause. It was also Grant's first victory of importance,\r\nand marks the beginning of his rise to fame. Fifteen thousand prisoners\r\nwere taken. Grant generously allowed the Confederates to retain their\r\npersonal baggage, and the officers to keep their side arms. General\r\nBuckner expressed his thanks for this chivalrous act, and later in life\r\nbecame Grant's personal friend.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF LINCOLN (CONTINUED), 1861-1865.\r\n\r\nWAR FOR THE UNION (CONTINUED), 1862.\r\n\r\nCapture of Forts Henry and Donelson--Change in the Confederate Line of\r\nDefense--Capture of Island No. 10--Battle of Pittsburg Landing or\r\nShiloh--Capture of Corinth--Narrow Escape of Louisville--Battle of\r\nPerryville--Battle of Murfreesboro' or Stone River--Battle of Pea\r\nRidge--Naval Battle Between the _Monitor_ and _Merrimac_--Fate of the\r\nTwo Vessels--Capture of New Orleans--The Advance Against\r\nRichmond--McClellan's Peninsula Campaign--_The First Confederate\r\nInvasion of the North_--_Battle of Antietam or Sharpsburg_--_Disastrous\r\nUnion Repulse at Fredericksburg_--_Summary of the Wars Operations_--_The\r\nConfederate Privateers_--_The Emancipation Proclamation_--_Greenbacks\r\nand Bond Issues_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF FORTS HENRY AND DONELSON.\r\n\r\nThe fighting of the second year of the war opened early. General Albert\r\nSidney Johnston, one of the ablest leaders of the Confederacy, was in\r\nchief command in the West. The Confederate line ran through southern\r\nKentucky, from Columbus to Mill Spring, through Bowling Green. Two\r\npowerful forts had been built in Tennessee, near the northern boundary\r\nline. One was Fort Henry on the Tennessee River, and the other Fort\r\nDonelson, twelve miles away, on the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nOpposed to this strong position were two Union armies, the larger,\r\nnumbering 100,000, under General Don Carlos Buell, in central Kentucky,\r\nand the lesser, numbering 15,000, commanded by General U.S. Grant, at\r\nCairo. Under Buell was General George H. Thomas, one of the finest\r\nleaders in the Union army. In January, with a division of Buell's army,\r\nhe attacked the Confederates, routed and drove them into Tennessee. In\r\nthe battle, General Zollicoffer, the Confederate commander, was killed.\r\n\r\nEmbarking at Cairo, General Grant steamed up the Tennessee River,\r\nintending to capture Fort Henry. Before he could do so, Commodore Andrew\r\nH. Foote, with his fleet of gunboats, compelled it to surrender, though\r\nmost of the garrison escaped across the neck of land to Fort Donelson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF FORT DONELSON.\r\n\r\nUpon learning that Fort Henry had fallen, Grant steamed up the\r\nCumberland to attack Fort Donelson, which was reinforced until the\r\ngarrison numbered some 20,000 men. It was a powerful fortification,\r\nwith many rifle-pits and intrenchments on the land side, and powerful\r\nbatteries commanding the river. The political General Floyd was in chief\r\ncommand, the right wing being under General Simon B. Buckner and the\r\nleft in charge of General Gideon J. Pillow.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of February 14th, Commodore Foote opened the attack\r\nwith two wooden vessels and four ironclad gunboats. The garrison made no\r\nreply until the boats had worked their way to within a fourth of a mile\r\nof the fort, the elevation of which enabled it to send a plunging fire,\r\nwhich proved so destructive that two of the boats were disabled and\r\ndrifted down current, the other following. Some fifty men were killed,\r\nand among the wounded was Commodore Foote. He withdrew to Cairo,\r\nintending to wait until a sufficient force could be brought up from that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES 12-INCH BREECH-LOADING MORTAR, OR\r\nHOWITZER.]\r\n\r\nBut General Grant, like the bull-dog to which he was often compared,\r\nhaving inserted his teeth in his adversary, did not mean to let go.\r\nPlacing his troops in front of the works, it did not take him long to\r\ninvest the whole Confederate left, with the exception of a swampy strip\r\nnear the river. The weather, which had been unusually mild for the\r\nseason, now became extremely cold, and some of the Union men were frozen\r\nto death in the trenches. The garrison also suffered greatly, but the\r\nsiege was pressed with untiring vigor. Seeing the inextricable coils\r\nclosing round them, the defenders made an attempt to cut their way out,\r\nbut Grant with true military genius saw the crisis and ordered an\r\nadvance along the whole line, the gunboats giving all the help they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the garrison was so dangerous that a council of war was\r\nheld that night. Floyd and Pillow were frightened nearly out of their\r\nwits. They rated themselves so high as prizes for the Federals that they\r\ndetermined to make their escape before the surrender, which was\r\ninevitable, was forced. Buckner was another sort of man. Disgusted with\r\nthe cowardice of his associates, he quietly announced that he would stay\r\nby his men to the last. Floyd stole out of the fort with his brigade and\r\ncrossed the river in boats, while Pillow followed in a scow, a large\r\nnumber of the cavalry galloping by the lower road to Nashville.\r\n\r\nGrant was ready for the assault at daylight the next morning, when he\r\nreceived a note from General Buckner proposing an armistice until noon\r\nin order to arrange terms of capitulation. Grant's reply became famous:\r\n\"No terms except immediate and unconditional surrender can be accepted;\r\nI propose to move immediately upon your works.\" Buckner was\r\ndisappointed, but he had no choice except to submit. He was greatly\r\nrelieved to find that his conqueror was a chivalrous man, who granted\r\nbetter terms than he expected. The privates were allowed to retain their\r\npersonal baggage and the officers their side-arms. The number of\r\nprisoners was 15,000, and the blow was the first really severe one that\r\nthe South had received. As may be supposed, the news caused great\r\nrejoicing in the North and was the beginning of Grant's fame as a\r\nmilitary leader--a fame which steadily grew and expanded with the\r\nprogress of the war.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis saw the mistake he had made in intrusting important\r\ninterests to political generals. He deprived Floyd of his command, and\r\nthat officer dropped back to the level from which he never ought to have\r\nbeen raised. Pillow had done some good work in the Mexican War, but he\r\nwas erratic and unreliable, and he, too, was summarily snuffed out.\r\nBuckner, a West Point graduate, upon being exchanged soon afterward, was\r\nassigned to an important command and proved himself an excellent\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE IN THE CONFEDERATE LINE OF DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Forts Henry and Donelson compelled a change in the\r\nConfederate line of defense. General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew\r\nfrom Bowling Green to Nashville, but fell back again upon learning of\r\nthe fall of Fort Donelson, and assumed position near Murfreesboro',\r\nTennessee. All the northern part of that State, including the Cumberland\r\nRiver, was given up by the Confederates, and, when the new line was\r\nestablished, the centre was held by Beauregard at Jackson, the left by\r\nPolk at New Madrid, and the right by Johnston at Murfreesboro'. Thus the\r\nConfederates were driven out of Kentucky and the northern part of\r\nTennessee. It was a serious check for the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF ISLAND NO. 10.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant gave the enemy no rest. In order to retain possession of\r\nIsland No. 10, it was necessary for them to hold the outpost of New\r\nMadrid. In the latter part of February, General Pope led an expedition\r\nagainst that place, while Commodore Foote made a demonstration in front\r\nwith his gunboats. Through cold and storm the Unionists bravely pushed\r\ntheir way, and the garrison of New Madrid were compelled to take refuge\r\non Island No. 10, and in the works on the Kentucky side of the river.\r\nOperations were then begun against Island No. 10. By digging a canal\r\ntwelve miles long, which permitted the gunboats to pass around the\r\ndefenses, and by energetic operations in all directions, the Confederate\r\nposition was rendered untenable, and the post, with a large amount of\r\nwar material, was surrendered to Commodore Foote.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Grant, after the occupation of Nashville, went down\r\nthe Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, while General Buell, with the\r\nother portion of the Union army, started for the same point by land.\r\nAware of this division of the Federal forces, General Albert Sidney\r\nJohnston hastily concentrated his own divisions with the intention of\r\ncrushing the two Union armies before they could unite. When Johnston\r\narrived in the vicinity of Pittsburg Landing on the 3d of April he had\r\n40,000 men, divided into three corps and a reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING.\r\n\r\nPittsburg Landing, or Shiloh, as it is called in the South, consists of\r\na high bluff, a half-mile in extent, where General W.T. Sherman had been\r\nordered to take position and prepare for the arrival of 100,000 men.\r\nGrant was not prepared for the unexpected attack. Buell was some\r\ndistance away with 40,000 troops, and the Union commander had a somewhat\r\nless force on his side of the Tennessee River. Only a few defenses had\r\nbeen thrown up, and the men were scattered over the ground, when at\r\ndaylight on Sunday morning, April 6th, the Confederates furiously\r\nassailed the outlying divisions of the Union army and drove them back\r\nupon the main body. They steadily gained ground, and it looked as if\r\nnothing could save the Union army from overwhelming disaster.\r\n\r\nWhen the attack was made Grant was on the opposite side of the river in\r\nconsultation with Buell. Hurrying to the scene of the furious conflict,\r\nit looked as if his army was on the edge of inevitable destruction, but\r\nhe handled his demoralized forces with such masterly skill that the\r\npanic was checked, and on the river bank, over which they had been\r\nwell-nigh driven, an effective stand was made and the Confederates were\r\nchecked, the gunboats giving invaluable assistance in saving the army\r\nfrom defeat. The night closed with all the advantage on the side of the\r\nConfederates.\r\n\r\nThe darkness, however, was of immeasurable value to the Federals.\r\nBuell's army was brought across the river and other reinforcements\r\narrived, so that in the morning Grant found himself in command of fully\r\n50,000 well-equipped troops. The greatest advantage gained by the\r\nFederals, however, came during the previous day's fighting, when\r\neverything was going the way of their enemies. General Albert Sidney\r\nJohnston, while directing operations, was struck by a shot which\r\nshattered his knee and mortally wounded him. He spoke only a few words\r\nas he was lifted from his horse, and the command devolved upon\r\nBeauregard, much his inferior in ability. He was unable to restrain the\r\ntroops from plundering the captured Union camps; and when on the second\r\nday Grant launched his regiments against them, they were driven\r\npell-mell from the field, and did not stop their retreat until they\r\nreached Corinth, Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RAILROAD BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nLittle fear of the Union troops being caught a second time at such a\r\ndisadvantage. They were established on the upper part of the Tennessee,\r\nprepared to strike blows in any direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVACUATION OF CORINTH.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of Beauregard to Corinth made that point valuable to the\r\nUnionists, because of the large number of railroads which centre there.\r\nIt was strongly fortified, and no one expected its capture without a\r\nsevere battle. General Halleck, who was high in favor with the\r\ngovernment, assumed command of the Union armies and began an advance\r\nupon Corinth. He moved slowly and with great caution, and did not reach\r\nthe front of the place until the close of May. While making preparations\r\nto attack, Beauregard withdrew and retired still further southward. No\r\nfurther Union advance was made for some time. The important result\r\naccomplished was in opening up the Mississippi from Cairo to Memphis and\r\nextending the Union line so that it passed along the southern boundary\r\nof Tennessee.\r\n\r\nBeauregard resembled McClellan in many respects. He was excessively\r\ncautious and disposed to dig trenches and throw up fortifications rather\r\nthan fight. Jefferson Davis always had a warm regard for General Braxton\r\nBragg, whom he now put in the place of Beauregard. By the opening of\r\nSeptember, Bragg had an army of 60,000 men. Kirby Smith's corps was at\r\nKnoxville and Hardee and Polk were with Bragg at Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nThey were ordered to march through Kentucky to Louisville, threatening\r\nCincinnati on the way. Kirby Smith's approach threw that city into a\r\npanic, but he turned off and joined Bragg at Frankfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RACE FOR LOUISVILLE.\r\n\r\nBy this time the danger of Louisville was apparent, and Buell, who was\r\nnear Nashville, hastened to the defense of the more important city.\r\nBragg ran a race with him, but the burning of a bridge, spanning the\r\nriver at Bardstown, stopped him just long enough to allow Buell to reach\r\nLouisville first. This was accomplished on the 25th of September, and\r\nBuell's army was increased to 100,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PERRYVILLE.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in securing the main prize, Bragg marched to Frankfort,\r\nwhere he installed a provisional governor of Kentucky and issued a\r\nhigh-sounding proclamation, to which few paid attention. Bragg had\r\nentered one of the richest sections of the State, and he secured an\r\nenormous amount of supplies in the shape of cattle, mules, bacon, and\r\ncloth. His presence in the State was intolerable to the Union forces,\r\nand Buell, finding a strong army under his command, set out to attack\r\nhim. Bragg started to retreat through the Cumberland Mountains on the\r\n1st of October, with Buell in pursuit. A severe but indecisive battle\r\nwas fought at Perryville, and the Confederates succeeded in carrying\r\naway their immense booty to Chattanooga, while the Union army took\r\nposition at Nashville.\r\n\r\nThe government was dissatisfied with the sluggishness of Buell and\r\nreplaced him with General William S. Rosecrans. He posted a part of his\r\narmy at Nashville and the remainder along the line of the Cumberland\r\nRiver. Advancing against Bragg, he faced him in front of Murfreesboro',\r\nsome forty miles from Nashville. On the 30th of December brisk firing\r\ntook place between the armies, and when they encamped for the night\r\ntheir fires were in plain sight of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF MURFREESBORO' OR STONE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe opposing forces were on both sides of Stone River (this battle is\r\ngenerally referred to in the South by that name), a short distance to\r\nthe northwest of Murfreesboro'. By a curious coincidence, each of the\r\nrespective commanders formed the same plan of attack, it being to mass\r\nhis forces on the left and crush his enemy's right wing. A terrific\r\nengagement lasted all day, and night closed without any decisive\r\nadvantage to either side, though the Confederates had succeeded in\r\ndriving back the Union right upon the left and occupying a considerable\r\nportion of the field formerly held by the Federals.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of the armies prevented anything more than skirmishing on\r\nNew Year's day, 1863, but on the afternoon of January 2d the furious\r\nbattle was renewed. Rosecrans ordered an advance of the whole line, and\r\nthe Confederate right wing was broken and the flank so endangered that\r\nBragg was compelled to withdraw his entire army. The only way for him to\r\nretain Tennessee was to abandon Murfreesboro'. Accordingly, he retreated\r\nto a point beyond Duck River, about fifty miles south of Murfreesboro',\r\nwhich was occupied by the Federals, January 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nOther important events took place in the West. General Sterling Price\r\nwintered in Springfield, Missouri, in the southern part of the State,\r\nand gained a good many recruits and a large amount of needed supplies.\r\nHe was attacked by Sigel and Curtis on the 12th of February, and\r\ncontinued his retreat to the Boston Mountains, where he was reinforced\r\nby McCulloch, Van Dorn, and Albert Pike, and felt himself strong enough\r\nto turn about and attack Curtis, who was in the neighborhood of Pea\r\nRidge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PEA RIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe Union right was commanded by General Sigel, the left by General\r\nCarr, and the centre by General Jefferson C. Davis. Sigel was surprised\r\nand came very near being cut off, but he was master of the art of\r\nretreating rather than of advancing, and he extricated his Germans with\r\nastonishing skill and joined the main army. General Curtis changed his\r\nfront, and in the attack his right wing was driven back, obliging him\r\nthat night to take a new position a mile to the rear. The fighting next\r\nday was at first in favor of the Confederates, and for a time the Union\r\narmy was in a critical position; but with great bravery and skill the\r\nenemy's left was turned, the centre broken, and their forces driven in\r\ndisorder from the field.\r\n\r\nIn this battle Albert Pike used 2,000 Indian allies. They belonged to\r\nthe \"civilized\" tribes, and good service was expected from them; but\r\nthey were unaccustomed to fighting in the open, could not be\r\ndisciplined, and in the excitement of the struggle it is alleged they so\r\nlost their heads that they scalped about as many of the Confederates as\r\nUnionists. At any rate, the experiment was a failure, and thereafter\r\nthey cut no figure in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDECISIVE FIGHTING.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were so badly shaken that they retreated toward the North to\r\nreorganize and recruit. Reinforcements from Kansas and Missouri also\r\njoined Curtis, who advanced in the direction of Springfield, Missouri,\r\nupon learning that Price was making for the same point. Nothing\r\nfollowed, and Curtis returned to Arkansas. He had been at Batesville in\r\nthat State a few months when he found himself in serious peril. His\r\nsupplies were nearly exhausted, and it was impossible to renew them in\r\nthe hostile country by which he was surrounded. An expedition for his\r\nrelief left Memphis in June, but failed. Supplies from Missouri,\r\nhowever, reached him early in July.\r\n\r\nCurtis marched to Jacksonport, and afterward established himself at\r\nHelena on the Mississippi. In September he was appointed commander of\r\nthe department of Missouri, which included that State, Arkansas, and the\r\nIndian Territory. There were many minor engagements, and the Unionists\r\nsucceeded in keeping the Confederates from regaining their former\r\nfoothold in Missouri and north of Arkansas. It may be said that all the\r\nfighting in that section produced not the slightest effect on the war as\r\na whole. The best military leaders of the Confederacy advised President\r\nDavis to withdraw all his forces beyond the Mississippi and concentrate\r\nthem in the East, but he rejected their counsel, and his stubbornness\r\ngreatly weakened the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nHaving given an account of military operations in the West, it now\r\nremains to tell of the much more important ones that occurred on the\r\ncoast and in the East, for they were decisive in their nature, and\r\nproduced a distinct effect upon the progress of the war for the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE MERRIMAC.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that early in the war the Norfolk navy yard was\r\nburned to prevent its falling into the possession of the Confederates.\r\nAmong the vessels sunk was the frigate _Merrimac_, which went down\r\nbefore much injury was done to her. She was a formidable craft of 3,500\r\ntons, 300 feet in length, and had mounted 40 guns. The Confederates\r\nsucceeded in raising her, and proceeded to work marvelous changes in\r\nher structure, by which she was turned into the first real armor-clad\r\never constructed. She was protected by layers of railroad iron, which\r\nsloped like the roof of a house, and was furnished with a prow of cast\r\niron which projected four feet in front. Pivot guns were so fixed as to\r\nbe used for bow and stern chasers, and the pilot-house was placed\r\nforward of the smoke-stack and armored with four inches of iron. She\r\ncarried ten guns, one at the stern, one at the bow, and eight at the\r\nsides, and fired shells. Her iron armor sloped down at the sides, so\r\nthat she looked like an enormous mansard-roof moving through the water.\r\nHer commanding officer was Commodore Franklin Buchanan, formerly of the\r\nUnited States navy, while under him were Lieutenant Catesby R. Jones,\r\nthe executive officer, six other lieutenants, six midshipmen, surgeons,\r\nengineers, and subordinate officers, in addition to a crew of 300 men.\r\nShe was rechristened the _Virginia_, but will always be remembered as\r\nthe _Merrimac_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY STANTON'S OPINION ABOUT THE MERRIMAC.\r\n\r\n\"The whole character of the war will be changed.\"]\r\n\r\nOf necessity this craft, being the pioneer of its kind, had many\r\ndefects. She could move only very slowly, and her great length of 300\r\nfeet and poor steering apparatus required a half-hour for her to make a\r\ncomplete turn, while her draft of 22 feet confined her to the narrow\r\nchannel of the Roads. Still she could go faster than an ordinary sailing\r\nvessel, and her resistless momentum and iron prow enabled her to crush\r\nany vessel afloat as if it were an egg-shell.\r\n\r\nGreat pains were taken by the Confederates to keep secret the\r\nparticulars of her building; but it was known in Washington that a\r\nstrange craft was in course of construction at Norfolk, with which it\r\nwas expected to capture Washington and devastate the leading cities\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard. Ericsson, the famous Swedish inventor, was\r\nengaged near New York in building a smaller vessel upon the same\r\nprinciple, and he was pressed to make all possible haste in finishing\r\nit; for, though the government did not suspect the terrible\r\neffectiveness of the _Merrimac_, they meant to take all reasonable\r\nprecautions against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWFUL WORK OF THE MERRIMAC.\r\n\r\nThere were lying at Hampton Roads at that time five Union vessels,\r\nwhich, being so close to the dangerous craft, were on the alert day and\r\nnight for her appearance. About noon on March 8th a column of dark smoke\r\nin the direction of the Norfolk navy yard, followed by the forging into\r\nsight of the huge hulk, left no doubt that the long-expected _Merrimac_\r\nwas coming forth upon her errand of death and destruction. In her\r\ncompany were three gunboats ready to aid her in any way possible. The\r\nsteam frigate _Minnesota_ and _Roanoke_ and the sailing frigates\r\n_Congress_, _Cumberland_, and _St. Lawrence_ immediately cleared their\r\ndecks for action.\r\n\r\nThe _Minnesota_ and _Roanoke_ moved out to meet the _Merrimac_, but both\r\ngot aground. In the case of the _Minnesota_ this was due to the\r\ntreachery of the pilot, who was in the employ of the Confederates. The\r\n_Cumberland_ swerved so as to bring her broadsides to bear, and opened\r\nwith her pivot guns, at the distance of a mile. The aim was accurate,\r\nbut the iron balls which struck the massive hide of the _Merrimac_\r\nbounded off like pebbles skipping over the water. Then the _Congress_\r\nadded her broadsides to those of the _Cumberland_, but the leviathan\r\nshed them all as if they were tiny hailstones, and, slowly advancing in\r\ngrim silence, finally opened with her guns, quickly killing four marines\r\nand five sailors on the _Cumberland_. Then followed her resistless\r\nbroadsides, which played awful havoc with officers and men. Swinging\r\nslowly around, the _Merrimac_ next steamed a mile up the James, and,\r\nturning again, came back under full speed. Striking the _Cumberland_\r\nunder the starboard bow, she smashed a hole into her through which a\r\nhorse might have entered. The ship keeled over until her yardarms were\r\nclose to the water. The terrific force broke off the prow of the\r\n_Merrimac_, but her frightful shots riddled the _Cumberland_ and set\r\nher on fire. The flames were extinguished, and the _Cumberland_\r\ndelivered broadside after broadside, only to see the enormous missiles\r\nfly off and spin harmlessly hundreds of feet away.\r\n\r\nLieutenant George U. Morris, of the _Cumberland_, ran up the red flag\r\nmeaning \"no surrender,\" and with a heroism never surpassed maintained\r\nthe unequal fight, if fight it can be called where there was absolutely\r\nno hope for him. Finally the _Cumberland_ went down to her cross-trees,\r\nin fifty-four feet of water. Lieutenant Morris succeeded in saving\r\nhimself by swimming, but of the crew of 376, 121 lost their lives.\r\n\r\nThe _Cumberland_ being destroyed, the _Merrimac_ headed for the\r\n_Congress_, which had run aground. She replied with her harmless\r\nbroadsides, but the _Merrimac_ held her completely at her mercy, raking\r\nher fore and aft, and killing 100 of the crew, including the commander.\r\nIt being evident that not a man could escape, the white flag was run up\r\nin token of surrender. The hot firing from the shore preventing\r\nCommodore Buchanan from taking possession of the _Congress_, whereupon\r\nhe fired her with hot shot.\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting, Commodore Buchanan fearlessly exposed himself on\r\nthe upper deck of the _Merrimac_, and was badly wounded in the thigh by\r\na Union sharpshooter, whereupon the command was assumed by Lieutenant\r\nJones. By that time it was growing dark and the _Merrimac_ steamed back\r\nto Sewall's Point, intending to return the next morning and complete her\r\nappalling work of destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTERNATION IN THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nThe news of what she had done caused consternation throughout the North.\r\nPresident Lincoln called a special cabinet meeting, at which Secretary\r\nStanton declared, in great excitement, that nothing could prevent the\r\nmonster from steaming up the Potomac, destroying Washington, and laying\r\nthe principal northern cities under contribution. The alarm of the bluff\r\nsecretary was natural, but there was no real ground for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONITOR.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish inventor, John Ericsson, had completed his _Monitor_, which\r\nat that hour was steaming southward from New York. Although an ironclad\r\nlike the _Merrimac_, she was as different as can be conceived in\r\nconstruction. She resembled a raft, the upper portion of which was 172\r\nfeet long and the lower 124 feet. The sides of the former were made of\r\noak, twenty-five inches thick, and covered with five-inch iron armor.\r\n\r\nThe turret was protected by eight-inch plates of wrought iron,\r\nincreasing in thickness to the port-holes, near which it was eleven\r\ninches through. It was nine feet high, with a diameter of twenty-one\r\nfeet. She drew only ten feet of water, and was armored with two\r\neleven-inch Dahlgren guns, smooth bore, firing solid shot weighing 180\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe pilot-house was made of nine-inch plates of forged iron, rose four\r\nfeet above the deck, and would hold three men by crowding. The _Monitor_\r\nwas one-fifth the size of the _Merrimac_, and her appearance has been\r\nlikened to that of a cheese-box on a raft. She was in command of\r\nLieutenant John L. Worden, with Lieutenant S. Dana Green as executive\r\nofficer. Her crew consisted of sixteen officers and forty-two men, and\r\nshe left New York on the morning of March 6th, in tow of a tug-boat. The\r\ngreatest difficulty was encountered in managing her, the men narrowly\r\nescaping being smothered by gas, and, had not the weather been unusually\r\nfavorable, she would have foundered; but providentially she steamed into\r\nHampton Roads, undiscovered by the enemy, and took her position behind\r\nthe _Minnesota_, ready for the events of the morrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ERICSSON.\r\n\r\nThe famous constructor of the Monitor.]\r\n\r\nThe _Merrimac_ was promptly on time the next morning, and was\r\naccompanied by two gunboats; but while steaming toward the remaining\r\nUnion vessels the _Monitor_ darted out from behind the _Minnesota_ and\r\nboldly advanced to meet her terrible antagonist. They silently\r\napproached each other until within a hundred yards, when the _Monitor_\r\nfired a shot, to which the _Merrimac_ replied. The firing was rapid for\r\na time and then became slower, with the intervening space varying from\r\nfifty yards to four times that distance. A number of the _Merrimac's_\r\nshots struck the _Monitor's_ pilot-house and turret, the crash doing no\r\nharm except almost to deafen the men within. Most of the shells,\r\nhowever, missed or skipped over the low deck of the smaller boat.\r\n\r\nThe latter was able to dodge the rushes of the larger craft and play all\r\naround her, but the terrible pounding worked damage to both, the\r\n_Monitor_ suffering the most. The iron plate of the pilot-house was\r\nlifted by a shell, which blinded Lieutenant Worden, and so disabled him\r\nthat he was forced to turn over the command to Lieutenant Green. Worden,\r\nwho lived to become an admiral, never fully recovered from his injuries.\r\nThe firing, dodging, ramming, and fighting continued for four hours, but\r\nthe _Merrimac_ was unable to disable her nimble antagonist, and slowly\r\nsteamed back to Norfolk, while the _Monitor_ returned to her former\r\nposition, and was carefully kept in reserve by the government against\r\nfuture perils of a similar character.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATE OF THE MERRIMAC AND MONITOR.\r\n\r\nNeither of the vessels was permitted to do further service. Some months\r\nlater, upon the evacuation of Norfolk, the _Merrimac_ was blown up to\r\nprevent her falling into the hands of the Unionists, and the _Monitor_\r\nfoundered off Hatteras in December, 1862. The battle wrought a complete\r\nrevolution in naval warfare. The days of wooden ships ended, and all the\r\nnavies of the world are now made up mainly of ironclads.\r\n\r\nMore important work was done by the Union fleets during this year. The\r\ngovernment put forth every energy to build ships, with the result that\r\nhundreds were added to the naval force, many of which were partial and\r\nothers wholly ironclad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COAST OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nA month before the fight between the _Monitor_ and _Merrimac_, a\r\nformidable naval expedition under Commodore Goldsborough and General\r\nAmbrose E. Burnside passed down the Atlantic coast and captured Roanoke\r\nIsland. St. Augustine and a number of other places in Florida were\r\ncaptured by troops from Port Royal. Siege was laid to Fort Pulaski, at\r\nthe mouth of the Savannah River, and it surrendered April 11th. The\r\nadvantage of these and similar captures was that it gave the blockading\r\nfleets control of the principal harbors, and made it easier to enforce a\r\nrigid blockade. There were two ports, however, which the Union vessels\r\nwere never able to capture until the close of the war. They were\r\nCharleston and Wilmington, North Carolina. The latter became the chief\r\nport from which the Confederate blockade-runners dashed out or entered\r\nand were enabled to bring the most-needed medical and other supplies to\r\nthe Confederacy, while at the same time the owners and officers of the\r\nships reaped fortunes for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\nOne of the primal purposes of the war was to open the Mississippi, which\r\nwas locked by the enemy at Vicksburg and New Orleans. As a necessary\r\nstep in the opening of the great river, an expedition was fitted out for\r\nthe capture of New Orleans. Well aware of what was coming, the\r\nConfederates had done all they could to strengthen the defenses of the\r\ncity. Thirty miles from the mouth of the Mississippi were the powerful\r\nForts Jackson and St. Philip, on opposite sides of the river. They\r\nmounted 100 heavy guns, and six powerful chains were stretched across,\r\nsupported by an immense raft of cypress logs. Thus the river was closed\r\nand no fleet could approach New Orleans until these obstructions were\r\nremoved or overcome. When this should be done, it was still seventy-five\r\nmiles to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nAbove the boom of hulks and logs was a fleet of fifteen Confederate\r\nvessels, including the ironclad ram _Manassas_, and a partly completed\r\nfloating battery armored with railroad iron, and known as the\r\n_Louisiana_. It has been stated that the ironclads of those days were\r\nonly partly protected by armor.\r\n\r\nThe naval and military expedition which sailed for New Orleans in the\r\nspring of 1862 consisted of six sloops of war, sixteen gunboats, five\r\nother vessels, and twenty-one mortar-schooners, the last being under\r\ncharge of Captain David D. Porter, while Commodore David G. Farragut had\r\ncommand of the fleet. The troops, mostly from New England, were\r\ncommanded by General B.F. Butler.\r\n\r\nFarragut crossed the bar, April 8th, and spent several days in making\r\nhis preparations for bombarding Forts Jackson and St. Philip. The\r\nbombardment began April 27th, 1,400 shells being thrown in one day.\r\nFarragut then called his captains together and told them he had resolved\r\nto run by the forts. The only question, therefore, was as to the best\r\nmeans of doing it. It was decided to make the attempt at night. The\r\ndarkness, however, was of little benefit, since the enemy's huge\r\nbonfires on both shores lit up the river as if it were noonday. Previous\r\nto this, Lieutenant C.H.B. Caldwell, in the gunboat _Itasca_, had\r\nascended the river undiscovered in the darkness and opened a way through\r\nthe boom for the fleet.\r\n\r\nFarragut arranged the fleet in two columns, his own firing upon Fort\r\nJackson, while the other poured its broadsides into Fort St. Philip. The\r\nflagship _Hartford_ led the way under cover of Porter's mortar-boats and\r\nthe others followed. There was a furious fight between the fleets, but\r\nevery Confederate was either captured or destroyed.\r\n\r\nFarragut steamed on to the city, silencing the batteries along the\r\nbanks, and, at noon, a messenger was sent ashore with a demand for the\r\nsurrender of the city. General Lovell was in command of 3,000 troops,\r\nintended for the defense of New Orleans, but he fled. The mayor refusing\r\nto haul down the secession flag, the Union troops took possession,\r\nraised the Union banner over the mint, and placed the city in charge of\r\nGeneral Butler. The citizens were in such a savage mood that Commodore\r\nFarragut had to bring them to their senses by a threat to bombard the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler ruled with great strictness, and virtually held New\r\nOrleans under martial law. A Confederate won the applause of his friends\r\nby climbing to the top of the mint, hauling down the flag, dragging it\r\nthrough the mud, and then tearing it to shreds. Butler brought him to\r\ntrial before a military commission, and, being found guilty of the\r\nunpardonable insult to the flag, he was hanged.\r\n\r\nThe fall of New Orleans, one of the leading cities, was a severe blow to\r\nthe Confederacy. The only points where the Mississippi was strongly held\r\nby the enemy were at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and attention was\r\nalready turned to them. Farragut having completed his work, for the time\r\ntook command in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBBY PRISON IN 1865.]\r\n\r\nThe most momentous events of the year occurred in the east and marked\r\nthe struggle between the Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, as it came to be called.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE AGAINST RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nMcClellan continued to drill and train his army through the fall of\r\n1861, and well into the following year. It numbered nearly 200,000 men\r\nand was one of the finest organizations in the world. In reply to the\r\nexpressions of impatience, the commander invariably replied that a\r\nforward movement would soon be begun, but the weeks and months passed\r\nand the drilling went on, and nothing was done. Finally, the government\r\ngave the commander to understand that he must advance.\r\n\r\nMcClellan's plan was to move against Richmond, from the lower part of\r\nChesapeake Bay, by way of Urbana on the Rappahannock. While this had\r\nmany advantages, its fatal objection in the eyes of the President was\r\nthat it would leave Washington unprotected. He issued an order on the\r\n27th of January directing that on the 22d of February there should be a\r\ngeneral land and naval movement against the enemy's position on the\r\nPotomac, and that, after providing for the defense of Washington, a\r\nforce should seize and occupy a point upon the railway to the southwest\r\nof Manassas Junction. McClellan was offended by the act of the President\r\nand protested, but Mr. Lincoln clung in the main to his plan, and, since\r\nthe delay continued, he issued orders directing the formation of the\r\narmy into corps and naming the generals to command them. Another order\r\nmade arrangements for the intended advance, and it was left to McClellan\r\nto carry them out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBBY PRISON IN 1884, BEFORE ITS REMOVAL TO CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nReliable information reached Washington that General Joseph E. Johnston,\r\ncommander of the Confederate forces at Manassas, was engaged in\r\nwithdrawing his lines with a view of taking a stronger position nearer\r\nRichmond. General McClellan began a forward movement with the Army of\r\nthe Potomac on the 10th of March. The truth was that Confederate spies\r\nin Washington had apprised Johnston of the intended advance of McClellan\r\nfrom the lower Chesapeake, and his action was with a view of checkmating\r\nthe Union commander. Instead of carrying out this plan, McClellan\r\nmarched to Centreville and occupied the vacated intrenchments of the\r\nenemy. The general hope was that Johnston would be forced to give\r\nbattle, but the roads in Virginia, at that season, were one sea of mud,\r\nwhich made progress so slow that the Confederates had time in which to\r\nwithdraw at their leisure.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Potomac into Virginia, with the main army, McClellan made\r\nhis first headquarters at Fairfax Court-House. About that time he\r\nreceived news that he was relieved of the command of the other\r\ndepartments, his authority being confined to the direction of the Army\r\nof the Potomac. He was directed by the President to garrison Manassas\r\nsecurely, see that Washington was protected, and, with the rest of his\r\nforce, assume a new base at Fort Monroe, or \"anywhere between here and\r\nthere,\" and, above all things, to pursue the enemy \"by _some_ route.\"\r\n\r\nMcClellan's four corps commanders were Sumner, McDowell, Heintzelman,\r\nand Keyes, and they and he agreed upon a plan of campaign. The\r\ndifficulties of transporting nearly 100,000 men to Fort Monroe were so\r\ngreat that two weeks were occupied in completing the transfer. In order\r\nto prevent the Confederates from getting in his rear, McClellan directed\r\nBanks to rebuild the railroad from Washington to Manassas and Strasburg,\r\nthus keeping open communication with the Shenandoah Valley, where the\r\nenemy were in force, a fact which caused the government much uneasiness\r\nfor the national capital. Indeed, it was a part of the effective plan of\r\nJohnston to embarrass the campaign against Richmond.\r\n\r\nBanks occupied Winchester about the middle of March and sent a force\r\nunder Shields to Strasburg. He found Stonewall Jackson there with such a\r\nstrong force that he fell back to Winchester, where, after the\r\nwithdrawal of the main body by Banks, he was attacked by Jackson, who\r\nwas repulsed.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the new plan of campaign, McClellan made Fort Monroe his\r\nfirst base of operations, using the route through Yorktown and West\r\nPoint for the advance to Richmond. He expected to fight a great battle\r\non the way thither, for the enemy could not fail to read the meaning of\r\nhis movements. McClellan reasoned that this battle would take place\r\nbetween West Point and Richmond, and his intention was to advance\r\nwithout delay to the former position and use it as his chief depot for\r\nsupplies. His plan was to make a combined naval and military attack on\r\nYorktown, send a strong force up the York River, aided by the gunboats,\r\nand thus establish his new base of operations within twenty-five miles\r\nof the Confederate capital.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he began calling for reinforcements, and the\r\ngovernment, instead of aiding him, took away piecemeal many of the\r\ntroops upon which the commander had counted to aid him in his campaign.\r\nHe wanted 150,000 men and a large increase of cannon. The 10,000 men,\r\ncomposing Blenker's division, were detached, as the President informed\r\nhim, to support Fremont, but Mr. Lincoln promised to withdraw no more\r\nfrom the main army.\r\n\r\nMcClellan remained at his headquarters near Alexandria until most of his\r\nforces were well on the road to the Yorktown peninsula. He left on the\r\n1st of April and the troops were landed three days later. Then a force\r\nof 56,000 men with 100 guns started for Yorktown.\r\n\r\nBut for the inherent timidity and distrust of McClellan, he might have\r\ncaptured Richmond, by marching straight ahead to the city, for the\r\nConfederate force opposed to him was but a fragment of his own, and\r\ncould have been trampled underfoot. The Confederate intrenchments were a\r\ndozen miles in length, and were defended by Magruder with a force that\r\nallowed less than a thousand men for each mile.\r\n\r\nInstead of pushing on, McClellan began a regular siege of Yorktown.\r\nImmense siege guns were dragged through the muddy swamps, and the musket\r\nwas laid aside for the spade and shovel, which the men applied week\r\nafter week, until worn out and with thousands prostrated by sickness.\r\nThe delay, as a matter of course, was improved by the Confederates in\r\nstrengthening the defenses of their capital. At the end of a month, the\r\nUnion army advanced, whereupon Magruder fell back to other\r\nfortifications nearer Richmond. The whole month had been worse than\r\nthrown away by McClellan, for it had given the enemy all the time they\r\nneeded to complete their defenses.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate army was increased, and reinforcements were sent to\r\nMcClellan, whose forces were fully 20,000 in excess of those under\r\nJohnston, but the Union leader magnified the strength of the enemy and\r\ncontinued to call for more troops. It was this unvarying demand that\r\nbrought the impatient remark from Secretary of War Stanton:\r\n\r\n\"If I gave McClellan a million men, he would swear the rebels had two\r\nmillions, and sit down in the mud and refuse to move until he had three\r\nmillions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Confederates fell back to Williamsburg, at the narrowest part of the\r\npeninsula, between the James and York Rivers, and began fortifying their\r\nposition. The Union gunboats ascended to Yorktown, where the Federal\r\ndepots were established. Longstreet, in command of the Confederate rear,\r\nhalted and gave battle with a view of protecting his trains.\r\n\r\nThe engagement took place on May 5th. The Unionists were repulsed at\r\nfirst, but regained and held their ground, the night closing without any\r\ndecided advantage to either army. Longstreet, however, had held the\r\nFederals in check as long as was necessary, and when he resumed his\r\nretreat McClellan did not attempt to pursue him.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates continued falling back, with McClellan cautiously\r\nfollowing. The delay secured by the enemy enabled them to send their\r\nbaggage and supply trains into Richmond, while the army stripped for the\r\nfray. They abandoned the Yorktown peninsula altogether and evacuated\r\nNorfolk, which was occupied by General Wool. It was this movement which\r\ncaused the blowing up of the _Merrimac_, referred to elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that both shores of the James were in\r\npossession of the Union forces. The Confederate army withdrew within the\r\ndefenses of Richmond on the 10th of May, and the Federal gunboats, after\r\nsteaming up the river to within twelve miles of the city, were compelled\r\nto withdraw before the plunging shots of the batteries, which stood on\r\nthe tops of the high bluffs.\r\n\r\nFollowing the line of the Pamunkey, McClellan's advance-guard reached\r\nthe Chickahominy on the 21st of May, and could plainly see the spires\r\nand steeples of Richmond, which was thrown into a state of great alarm.\r\nRain fell most of the time, and the rise of the Chickahominy carried\r\naway the bridges, made the surrounding country a swamp, and badly\r\ndivided the Union army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOIST WEATHER AT THE FRONT.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective means employed by the Confederate commander\r\nagainst the Union advance was by creating a diversion in the Shenandoah\r\nValley and fear for the safety of Washington. Rather than lose that, our\r\ngovernment would have sacrificed the Army of the Potomac. General\r\nJohnston had sent Stonewall Jackson into the Valley, where Banks was in\r\ncommand. He was another of the political generals, wholly unfitted for\r\nthe responsibilities placed in his hands.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of hostilities, Banks was so confident that he\r\ntelegraphed the government that Jackson was on the eve of being crushed;\r\nbut it proved the other way. Banks was completely outgeneraled and sent\r\nflying toward Washington. His troops marched more than thirty miles a\r\nday, and would have been captured or destroyed to a man had Jackson\r\ncontinued his pursuit, but his forces were fewer in numbers, and he\r\nallowed the exhausted and panic-stricken fugitives to find refuge in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThis routing of Banks frightened Washington again, and McDowell was\r\nhastily called from Fredericksburg to the defense of the capital. This\r\nwas the very thing for which the Confederates had planned, since it kept\r\nthose reinforcements away from McClellan, who was ordered by President\r\nLincoln to attack at once or give up his plan. Still cautious and\r\nwishing to feel every foot of the way, McClellan pushed a reconnaissance\r\nin the direction of Hanover Court-House.\r\n\r\nWhen fire was opened on the Confederates most of them fell back to\r\nRichmond. General Jo Johnston, perceiving that the Union army was\r\ndivided by the swollen Chickahominy, quickly took advantage of it, and\r\nprepared to hurl a force of 50,000 against the Union corps, which\r\nnumbered a little more than half as many. A violent rain so interfered\r\nwith his plans that 10,000 of his troops were unable to take part in the\r\nbattle. In the disjointed struggle which followed, the Confederates were\r\nsuccessful at what is known as the battle of Seven Pines, but were\r\ndefeated at Fair Oaks. Both were fought on June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEE BECOMES CONFEDERATE COMMANDER.\r\n\r\nIn the fighting on the morrow, General Johnston, while directing the\r\nattack of the right, was desperately wounded by an exploding shell,\r\nwhich broke several ribs and knocked him from his horse. General G.W.\r\nSmith succeeded him in command, but three days later gave way to General\r\nR.E. Lee, who in time became the supreme head of the military forces of\r\nthe Confederacy, and retained his command to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN'S TARDINESS.\r\n\r\nThe corps commanders believed that if McClellan would press matters\r\nRichmond could be captured, but the Union leader devoted several weeks\r\nto building bridges. It rained incessantly and the health of the men\r\nsuffered. Many more died from disease than from bullets and wounds, and\r\nMcClellan's tardiness gave the enemy the time they needed in which to\r\nmake their combinations as strong as possible. Stonewall Jackson,\r\nalthough placed in a perilous position in the Shenandoah Valley,\r\nskillfully extricated himself and united his corps with the troops that\r\nwere defending Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STUART'S RAID.\r\n\r\nWhile McClellan was engaged in constructing bridges over the\r\nChickahominy, and no important movement was made by either army, General\r\nJ.E.B. Stuart, the famous cavalry leader, left Richmond, June 13th, with\r\na strong mounted force, and, by rapid riding and his knowledge of the\r\ncountry, passed entirely around the Federal army, cutting telegraph\r\nwires, burning bridges, capturing wagons and supplies, frightening\r\nMcClellan, and returning to Richmond, after two days' absence, with the\r\nloss of only a single man.\r\n\r\nThe Union commander was discouraged by the withdrawal of McDowell to the\r\ndefense of Washington, by the uncertainty regarding the disposition of\r\nthe enemy's corps, and by the belief that they were much more numerous\r\nthan was the fact. He decided to change the base of his operations from\r\nthe Pamunkey to the James. Both he and Lee fixed upon the same day--June\r\n26th--for an offensive movement; but Lee was the first to act. On the\r\nafternoon of that day a vehement attack was made upon the Union right.\r\nThe assault was repulsed, after a furious struggle, and it marked the\r\nbeginning of that fearful series of battles known as the Seven Days'\r\nFight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN DAYS' FIGHT.\r\n\r\nFeeling insecure, McClellan fell back, and the terrific fighting,\r\nbeginning June 26th, at Mechanicsville, continued with scarcely any\r\nintermission until July 1st. Both armies were well handled and fought\r\nbravely, but McClellan kept steadily falling back. Lee was not satisfied\r\nwith simply defeating the Union army; he strained every nerve to destroy\r\nit, but he was defeated in his purpose, and, as the hot afternoon of\r\nJune 30th was drawing to a close, the last wagon train of the Union army\r\nreached Malvern Hill, and preparations were hurriedly made to resist the\r\nassault that every one knew would soon come.\r\n\r\nMalvern Hill was a strong position. In addition the Federals had the aid\r\nof the gunboats. Indeed, the place was so well-nigh impregnable that the\r\nwarmest admirers of General Lee must condemn his furious and repeated\r\nassaults upon it. He suffered a disastrous repulse, and in the end\r\nwithdrew to the defenses of Richmond, while McClellan took position at\r\nHarrison's Landing. All the Union troops had arrived by the night of\r\nJuly 3d, and their commander began to study out a new plan for another\r\nadvance against the Confederate capital. Before anything could be done,\r\nhe was peremptorily ordered to withdraw his army from the peninsula. The\r\nmovement was begun with the purpose of uniting the troops with those of\r\nGeneral Pope, who was to the southeast of Washington, and placing them\r\nall under his command.\r\n\r\nPope had 40,000 troops between Fredericksburg and Washington. Learning\r\nthe situation, Lee kept enough men to hold Richmond, and sent the rest,\r\nunder Stonewall Jackson, against Pope in the north. Jackson executed the\r\ntask intrusted to him in his usual meteoric fashion. Despite the risk\r\ninvolved, he threw himself between Pope and Washington and struck here,\r\nthere, and everywhere so rapidly that the Union general became\r\nbewildered, his associate officers disgusted, and everything was\r\ninvolved in inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN.\r\n\r\nThe second battle of Bull Run, or Manassas, opened early on August 29th\r\nand lasted until dusk. The fighting was desperate, Jackson standing\r\nmainly on the defensive and waiting for Longstreet, who was hurrying\r\nforward through Thoroughfare Gap. At night Jackson withdrew so as to\r\nconnect with Longstreet. Believing the movement meant a retreat, Pope\r\ntelegraphed to that effect to Washington. But he was grievously\r\nmistaken, for the Confederates were rapidly reinforced, as was\r\ndiscovered the next day, when the battle was renewed and pressed\r\nresistlessly against the Federals. In the afternoon Lee arrived on the\r\nground, and, taking command, ordered an advance. Pope retreated, and\r\nthat night crossed Bull Run and took position behind the field works at\r\nCentreville. Other corps joined him, and on the 1st of September Lee\r\nmade a demonstration against the Union right flank. Pope now became\r\nterrified, as he saw that Washington was threatened, and he began a\r\ntumultuous retreat toward the capital, pursued and harassed by the\r\nConfederates, until at last the whole disorganized army found rest and\r\nsafety behind the fortifications at Washington. Pope had been\r\ndisastrously defeated, and the second campaign against Richmond was one\r\nof the worst failures conceivable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN RECALLED TO COMMAND.\r\n\r\nPope had done the best he knew how, but the task was beyond his ability,\r\nand he was glad enough to be relieved of his command, which was assumed\r\nonce more by McClellan, who still retained a great deal of his\r\npopularity with the rank and file. Pope's division had been styled the\r\nArmy of Virginia, but the name was now dropped, and the consolidated\r\nforces adopted the title of the Army of the Potomac, by which it was\r\nknown to the close of the war.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Confederates had been so decisive that the Richmond\r\nauthorities now decided to assume the aggressive and invade the North.\r\nIt was a bold plan thus to send their principal army so far from its\r\nbase, and General Lee did not favor it, but the opportunity was too\r\ntempting for his superiors to disregard. One great incentive was the\r\nwell-founded belief that if the Confederacy gained a marked advantage,\r\nEngland and France would intervene and thus secure the independence of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring State of Maryland was viewed with longing and hopeful\r\neyes by Lee and his army. It was a slave State, had furnished a good\r\nmany men to the Confederate armies, and, had it been left to itself,\r\nprobably would have seceded. What more likely, therefore, than that its\r\npeople would hasten to link their fortunes with the Confederacy on the\r\nvery hour that its most powerful army crossed her border?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATE ADVANCE INTO MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate army began fording the Potomac at a point nearly\r\nopposite the Monocacy, and by the 5th of September all of it was on\r\nMaryland soil. The bands struck up the popular air, \"Maryland, my\r\nMaryland,\" the exultant thousands joining in the tremendous chorus, as\r\nthey swung off, all in high spirits at the belief that they were\r\nentering a land \"flowing with milk and honey,\" where they would find\r\nabundant food and be received with outspread arms.\r\n\r\nFrederick City was reached on the 6th, and two days later Lee issued an\r\naddress to the people of Maryland, inviting them to unite with the\r\nSouth, but insisting that they should follow their free-will in every\r\nrespect. The document was a temperate one, and the discipline of the\r\ntroops was so excellent that nothing in the nature of plundering\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nBut it did not take Lee long to discover he had made a grievous mistake\r\nby invading Maryland. If the people were sympathetic, they did not show\r\nit by anything more than words and looks. They refused to enlist in the\r\nrebel army, gave Lee the \"cold shoulder,\" and left no doubt that their\r\ngreatest pleasure would be to see the last of the ragged horde.\r\n\r\nWhile at Frederick, Lee learned that the Union Colonel Miles was at\r\nHarper's Ferry with 12,000 troops, held there by the direct order of\r\nGeneral Halleck, who was the acting commander-in-chief of the United\r\nStates forces. Lee determined to capture the whole body, and, detaching\r\nStonewall Jackson with three divisions, ordered him to do so and return\r\nto him with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\nMilitary critics have condemned this act of Lee as one of the gravest\r\nblunders of his career. His advance thus far had been resistless, and it\r\nwas in his power to capture Baltimore, and probably Philadelphia and\r\nWashington; but the delay involved in awaiting the return of Jackson\r\ngave McClellan, who was a skillful organizer, time to prepare to meet\r\nthe Confederate invasion.\r\n\r\nJackson lost not an hour in capturing Harper's Ferry, the defense of\r\nwhich was so disgraceful that had not Colonel Miles been killed just as\r\nthe white flag was run up he would have been court-martialed and\r\nprobably shot. Many suspected him of treason, but the real reason was\r\nhis cowardice and the fact that he was intoxicated most of the time. Be\r\nthat as it may, Harper's Ferry surrendered with its garrison of 11,500\r\nmen, who were immediately paroled. The Confederates obtained seventy-two\r\ncannon, 13,000 small arms, and an immense amount of military stores.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the surrender taken place, when Jackson, who had hardly\r\nslept for several days and nights, received orders from Lee to join him\r\nat once. He started without delay, but he and his men were almost worn\r\nout. It is likely that by this time Lee was aware of the mistake he had\r\nmade when he stopped for several days while his leading assistant went\r\noff to capture a post that was of no importance to either side.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN'S PURSUIT OF LEE.\r\n\r\nLeaving a strong garrison to defend Washington, McClellan, at the head\r\nof 100,000 troops, set out to follow Lee, who had about 70,000 under his\r\nimmediate command. The Union leader reached Frederick on the 12th of\r\nSeptember, and there a curious piece of good fortune befell him.\r\n\r\nIn the house which had been used as the headquarters of General D.H.\r\nHill was found a copy of an order issued by General Lee, which detailed\r\nhis projected movements, and contained his instructions to his various\r\nleaders. It was priceless information to General McClellan, who made\r\ngood use of it.\r\n\r\nLee manoeuvred to draw McClellan away from Washington and Baltimore,\r\nthat he might attack them before the Union commander could return to\r\ntheir defense. Lee left Frederick on September 10th, after Jackson had\r\nstarted for Harper's Ferry, and, marching by South Mountain, aimed for\r\nBoonsboro'. Stuart and his cavalry remained east of the mountains to\r\nwatch McClellan, who was advancing with every possible precaution. Lee\r\nexpected Harper's Ferry would fall on the 13th, but the surrender did\r\nnot take place until two days later. The Confederate army being divided,\r\nMcClellan tried to take advantage of the fact, hoping to save Colonel\r\nMiles at Harper's Ferry. It did not take Lee long to perceive from the\r\nactions of the Union commander that in some way he had learned of his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nIt would not be interesting to give the details of the many manoeuvres\r\nby each commander, but before long Lee saw he could not hold his\r\nposition at South Mountain, and he retreated toward Sharpsburg, near the\r\nstream of water known as Antietam Creek. He was thus on the flank of any\r\nFederal force that might attempt to save Harper's Ferry. Naturally he\r\nheld the fords of the Potomac, so that in case of defeat the way to\r\nVirginia was open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL LEE'S INVASION OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate army under General Lee twice invaded the north. The\r\nfirst invasion was brought to a disastrous end by the Battle of\r\nAntietam, September 17, 1862. The second invasion ended with greater\r\ndisaster at Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863. Gettysburg was the greatest and\r\nAntietam the bloodiest battles of the war.]\r\n\r\nStill Lee and Jackson were separated by a wide stretch of mountain,\r\nriver, and plain, and McClellan was aware of the fact. He had the\r\nopportunity to cut off each division in detail, but lacked the nerve and\r\ndash to do it. There were subordinates in the Army of the Potomac who\r\nyearned for just such a chance, but McClellan's timidity and excessive\r\ncaution deprived him of another golden opportunity, as it had done\r\nbefore and was soon to do again.\r\n\r\nThe position of Lee was among a range of hills, which, following the\r\nform of a crescent, extended from the lower point of Antietam Creek to a\r\nbend in the Potomac. Jackson was straining every nerve to join Lee, but\r\nhis men were taxed beyond endurance, and many of them fell by the\r\nroadside from utter exhaustion, only a portion reaching Sharpsburg on\r\nthe 16th. The full Confederate army did not exceed 40,000, while\r\nMcClellan, who arrived on the opposite side of Antietam Creek, that\r\nafternoon, had 70,000. Instead of attacking at once, he waited two days,\r\nand thus gave Lee time to gather many thousand stragglers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTIETAM BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ANTIETAM OR SHARPSBURG.\r\n\r\nFinally, when McClellan had no excuse for further delay, and the enemy\r\nwas in fine form, he opened the attack on the morning of the 17th. To\r\nreach Lee the Union commander had to cross the creek, which was spanned\r\nby three bridges, each defended by Confederate batteries.\r\n\r\nThe first attack was by Hooker on the enemy's left, where he drove\r\nJackson back, after he had been reinforced by Hood, cleared the woods,\r\nand took possession of the Dunker Church, which stood slightly north of\r\nSharpsburg. A little way beyond the Confederates made a stand, and,\r\nbeing reinforced, recovered most of the ground they had lost. General\r\nMansfield was killed and Hooker received a painful wound in the foot.\r\nWhen their two corps were retreating in confusion, Sumner arrived,\r\nrallied them, and made a successful stand. Seeing the critical\r\nsituation, Lee hurried every available man to that point. This left only\r\n2,500 troops in front of the bridge, where Burnside had 14,000.\r\nMcClellan sent repeated orders for him to advance, but he paid no\r\nattention until one o'clock, when he crossed without trouble, and then\r\nremained idle for three more hours. The heights were soon captured, and\r\na position secured from which the rebel lines could be enfiladed. A.P.\r\nHill arrived at this juncture from Harper's Ferry with 4,000 men, and\r\ndrove Burnside in a panic to the creek. Fighting soon ceased, both sides\r\ntoo much exhausted to keep up the terrific struggle, the position of the\r\ntwo armies being much the same as at first.\r\n\r\nThis fierce battle had wrenched and disorganized both armies, but\r\nMcClellan, who had much the larger body, could have destroyed or\r\ncaptured those in front of him, had he followed the urgent advice of his\r\nofficers, and given the enemy no rest. But he decided to await\r\nreinforcements, which arrived to the number of 14,000 that night. Then\r\nhe resumed his preparations, and on the morning of the 19th advanced\r\nagainst the enemy, only to find there was none in front of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEE'S RETREAT.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of Lee was deliberate. Having accurately gauged the\r\ncommander in front of him, he spent all of the 18th in completing his\r\npreparations, and made no move until the next morning. Then, protected\r\nby batteries on the opposite bank, he crossed the Potomac, and on the\r\n20th drove back a Union reconnaissance. The government, impatient with\r\nMcClellan's tardiness, urged and almost ordered him to follow up Lee,\r\nbut the commander preferred to guard against being followed up himself\r\nby the Army of Northern Virginia. Thus again a golden opportunity\r\nslipped away unimproved.\r\n\r\nNaturally each side claimed a victory at Antietam or Sharpsburg, as it\r\nis called in the South, but such a claim in either case is hardly\r\njustifiable. It may be said, on the one hand, that Lee's invasion of the\r\nNorth was brought to a disastrous end by his check at Antietam, but the\r\nclaim of Lee was that his failure to secure the expected recruits from\r\nMaryland, and his distance from the base of supplies, necessitated such\r\na withdrawal on his part, for it is established that he was opposed to\r\nthe northward advance from the first.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he had received a serious check, but his army\r\nremained intact and was as well prepared as ever to contest the campaign\r\nagainst Richmond, a campaign which had to be pushed to a successful\r\nconclusion before the war could end. The one grand opportunity of\r\nGeneral McClellan's life was presented to him at the close of the battle\r\nof Antietam, and, failing to seize it, it never came again, and his\r\nmilitary career ended with failure.\r\n\r\nAntietam was, in comparison to numbers engaged, the bloodiest battle of\r\nthe Civil War. The Union loss was 2,108 killed; 9,549 wounded; 753\r\nmissing; total, 12,410. The Confederate loss was 1,886 killed; 9,348\r\nwounded; 1,367 captured and missing; total, 12,601.\r\n\r\nThe government was insistent that McClellan should push his advance\r\nagainst Richmond, but the favorable autumn wore away and the wet season\r\narrived before a plan of campaign was formulated. This was to cross the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains from Harper's Ferry, following the southeastern\r\nside of the range, leaving detachments to guard all the passes, and thus\r\nthreaten the Confederate communications in the Shenandoah Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN SUPERSEDED BY BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 25th of October, the Army of the Potomac once more\r\nfaced toward the Confederate capital. In the course of a week, it held\r\nthe whole region southwest of the Blue Ridge and was near the army of\r\nGeneral Lee, who fell back, cautiously followed at a safe distance by\r\nthe Union commander. On the night of November 7th, while McClellan was\r\ntalking in his tent with Burnside, a messenger arrived from Washington\r\nwith an official order, relieving McClellan of the command of the Army\r\nof the Potomac and appointing Burnside as his successor. McClellan\r\npromptly turned over the care of the army to him, and, as directed,\r\nproceeded to Trenton, N.J., to await further orders.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that General McClellan never served again in the army.\r\nHe resigned in 1864, and was nominated the same year for President of\r\nthe United States, but received only 21 electoral votes. He was\r\nDemocratic governor of New Jersey 1878-1881, and died at his home in\r\nOrange, N.J., October 29, 1885.\r\n\r\nBurnside, although a fine corps commander, was not qualified to command\r\nthe splendid body over which he was thus placed. He devoted a number of\r\ndays to acquainting himself with his vastly enlarged duties. The six\r\ncorps were united into three divisions of two corps each, Sumner\r\ncommanding the right, Hooker the centre, and Franklin the left, while\r\nGeneral Sigel had charge of a body of reserve.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with General Halleck, it was decided that the Army of\r\nthe Potomac should make a rapid march down the Rappahannock, cross by\r\npontoon-bridges at Fredericksburg, and then advance upon Richmond by way\r\nof Hanover Court-House.\r\n\r\nEverything depended upon initiating the movement before it was\r\ndiscovered by the enemy, but the delays, which perhaps were unavoidable,\r\nrevealed the truth to Lee. When Sumner's division reached a point\r\nopposite Fredericksburg they saw the Confederates on the other side\r\nawaiting them. Still the force was so meagre that Sumner wished to cross\r\nand crush it, but Burnside would not permit. The delay gave Lee time to\r\nbring up his whole army and make his position impregnable. He stationed\r\na battery some miles below the town to prevent any Union gunboats coming\r\nup stream, while every ford was closely guarded.\r\n\r\nBurnside faltered before the position that was like a mountain wall, but\r\nthe North was clamorous for something to be done, and he decided to make\r\nthe hopeless attack. One hundred and forty-seven cannon were posted, on\r\nthe night of December 10th, so as to command the town and cover the\r\ncrossing of the river. Unable to prevent this, Lee made his preparations\r\nto annihilate the Unionists after they had crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION DISASTER AT FREDERICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nIn the face of a brisk fire, a force was sent over the river and\r\noccupied the town, while Franklin laid his bridges two miles below and\r\ncrossed without trouble. When the cold, foggy morning of December 13th\r\nbroke, the whole Army of the Potomac was on the southern shore and the\r\nConfederate army was on the heights behind Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\nAs the fog had cleared to some extent, General Franklin advanced against\r\nthe Confederate right, but, misunderstanding Burnside's order, he made\r\nonly a feint. Fighting was kept up throughout the day, and once General\r\nMeade forced a gap in the enemy's line, but he was not reinforced, and\r\nwas driven back with severe loss.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the right having failed, Sumner threw himself against the\r\nleft. This required the seizure of Marye's Hill, and was hopeless from\r\nthe first. As the Union troops emerged from the town they were in fair\r\nrange of an appalling fire that mowed down scores. Still they pressed on\r\nwith a courage that could not be surpassed until one-half lay dead and\r\ndying, when the rest staggered backward out of the furnace-blast of\r\ndeath. The gallant Hancock gathered up the fragments of the shattered\r\nline, and, uniting them with his own men, numbering 5,000 in all, he led\r\na charge, which in a brief while stretched 2,000 dead or wounded. Still\r\nthe survivors held their ground and were joined by others, who fell so\r\nfast that it was soon evident that every man would be killed. Then\r\ngrimly remarking, \"I guess we have had enough killed to satisfy\r\nBurnside,\" Hancock ordered the brave fellows to fall back.\r\n\r\nBurnside was frantic over the repeated failures. He was determined that\r\nthe heights should be carried, and ordered Hooker, his only remaining\r\ngeneral, to do it. Hooker went across with his three divisions, made a\r\ncareful reconnoissance, and saw that to carry out the command meant the\r\nmassacre of all his troops. He returned to Burnside and begged him to\r\nrecall his order. He refused, and Hooker attempted to obey, leading\r\n4,000 of as brave men as ever shouldered a musket; but before they could\r\nreach the stone wall 1,700 lay helpless on the icy earth and the\r\nremainder fled.\r\n\r\nHad not night been at hand, Burnside would have ordered another charge\r\nand sacrificed hundreds of more lives, but he concluded to let the men\r\nlive until the next morning. Already 1,200 had been killed, almost\r\n10,000 wounded, and several thousand were missing. The commanders\r\ngathered around Burnside and insisted that the army should be brought\r\nacross the river before it was annihilated, but he refused. He was\r\nresolved on sacrificing several thousand more under the ghastly name of\r\na \"charge.\" At last, however, he became more reasonable and listened to\r\nhis officers. Perhaps the shrieks of the wounded, who lay for two days\r\nand nights where they had fallen without help, produced some effect in\r\nawaking him to a sense of his horrible blundering and incompetency, for,\r\nwhen the bleak, dismal morning dawned, the intended \"charge\" was not\r\nordered. The Army of the Potomac had been wounded so well-nigh unto\r\ndeath that it could not stand another similar blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATEST MODEL OF GATLING GUN.]\r\n\r\nOn the cold, rainy night of December 15th, the wretched forces tramped\r\nback over the river on the pontoon-bridges, having suffered the worst\r\ndefeat in the army's whole history. It was in the power of Lee to\r\ndestroy it utterly, but it slipped away from him, just as it had\r\nslipped away from McClellan after the battle of Antietam.\r\n\r\nThe Union losses at Fredericksburg were: Killed, 1,284; wounded, 9,600;\r\nmissing, 1,769; total, 12,653. The Confederate losses were: Killed, 596;\r\nwounded, 4,068; captured and missing, 651. Total, 5,315.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE YEAR'S OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe eventful year had been one of terrible fighting. It had opened with\r\nthe Union successes of Forts Henry and Donelson, followed by Pea Ridge,\r\nPittsburg Landing, and Corinth in the West, the naval battle between the\r\n_Merrimac_ and _Monitor_, the capture of Roanoke Island and of New\r\nOrleans. Bragg's invasion of Kentucky was injurious to the Union cause,\r\nwhile, as we have seen, the campaign against Richmond had been a series\r\nof disastrous failures. Still, taken as a whole, the year showed a\r\ndecisive step forward. The Union line had been advanced across the State\r\nof Tennessee, substantial progress had been made in opening the\r\nMississippi, and the blockade was enforced with a rigidity that caused\r\ngreat distress in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nBoth sides felt the terrific strain of the war. The Confederacy in April\r\npassed a conscription act, which made all able-bodied males between the\r\nages of eighteen and thirty-five years soldiers for the war. All such\r\nwere taken from the control of the State of which they were residents\r\nand placed at the disposal of President Davis until the close of the\r\nwar. This conscription act was soon made much more severe in its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATE PRIVATEERS.\r\n\r\nOne source of help to the Confederacy was her privateers, which wrought\r\nimmense damage to northern shipping. England assisted in fitting them\r\nout. Despite the protests of Minister Adams, many of these were allowed\r\nto put to sea. One of the first was the _Oreto_, afterward known as the\r\n_Florida_. She succeeded in eluding the blockade at Mobile, through\r\nflying the British flag, delivered her valuable freight, received her\r\narmament, and came forth again in the latter part of December and began\r\nher wholesale destruction of American merchantmen.\r\n\r\nThe privateer _Sumter_ was driven into Gibraltar, and so closely watched\r\nby the _Tuscarora_ that Captain Semmes, her commander, sold her, and\r\nmade his way to England, where the English built for him the most famous\r\nprivateer the Confederacy ever had--the _Alabama_--of which much more\r\nwill be told further on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe national government had learned by this time the full measurement\r\nof the gigantic task before it. By the close of the year, 1,300,000\r\nvolunteers had been called for, and the daily expenses amounted to\r\n$3,000,000. The conviction, too, was growing that slavery was the real\r\ncause of the war, and the time had come to treat it with less\r\nconsideration than many leading officers and men whose patriotism could\r\nnot be doubted were disposed to show toward the \"peculiar institution.\"\r\nPresident Lincoln was one of the wisest men who ever sat in the\r\nexecutive chair, and none read so unerringly the signs of the times as\r\nhe. The Abolitionists were impatient with his slowness, while many of\r\nthe doubting thought he went too fast. He waited until the right hour,\r\nand then issued his Emancipation Proclamation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH WAGON.]\r\n\r\nThis appeared soon after the battle of Antietam, and it is said was the\r\nfulfillment of the pledge President Lincoln had made to heaven that, if\r\nLee's invasion was turned back, he would issue the great paper, which,\r\nin effect, would see free 4,000,000 bondsmen. In it he warned the\r\nseceding States that in every one which failed to return to its\r\nallegiance by the first of January, 1863, he would declare the slaves\r\nfree. The warning was received with scorn, as was expected. From the\r\ndate named, therefore, all the armed forces of the Union treated the\r\nslaves as free wherever encountered. Before long colored men were\r\nenlisted as soldiers and sailors, and they bore no inconsiderable part\r\nin the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GREENBACKS.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the revenue of the government was altogether\r\nunequal to the vast demands upon it. Taxation was increased, and, in\r\n1862, the government began the issue of its own paper money. The backs\r\nof the bills being printed in green ink, these bills were known as\r\n\"greenbacks.\" They were made a legal tender, despite considerable\r\nopposition to the measure. The law gave any person owing a debt, no\r\nmatter if contracted in gold and silver, the right to pay the same with\r\ngreenbacks. Since it is impossible to regulate the value of money except\r\nby the law of supply and demand, the bills, as compared with gold,\r\ndepreciated a good deal in value.\r\n\r\nThe act of February 25, 1862, authorized the issue of $150,000,000, and\r\nfurther issues were made on June 11, 1862, and March 3, 1863. The\r\ndepreciation of greenbacks was such that the price of gold averaged 2.20\r\nthroughout 1864, and at one time reached 2.85. In other words, a\r\ngreenback dollar was worth only thirty-five cents. Another method of\r\nraising money was through the sale of bonds, of which many millions were\r\nissued. To encourage their sale, the National Banking System was\r\nestablished in 1863. This required all banks that issued currency to\r\ndeposit a slightly larger amount of bonds in Washington. Thus the banks\r\nwere compelled to help the government by loaning it money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF MALVERN HILL, JULY 1, 1862\r\n\r\nMalvern Hill was a very strong position taken by General McClellan in\r\nhis retreat before the army of Lee. General Lee made furious and\r\nrepeated assaults upon this well-nigh impregnable position, each time to\r\nmeet an inevitable repulse, and in the end a defeat accompanied by\r\nsevere losses, which necessitated his withdrawal to Richmond.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF LINCOLN (CONTINUED), 1861-1865.\r\n\r\nWAR FOR THE UNION (CONTINUED), 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Military Situation in the West--Siege and Capture of Vicksburg--The\r\nMississippi Opened--Battle of Chickamauga--\"The Rock of\r\nChickamauga\"--The Battle Above the Clouds--Siege of Knoxville--General\r\nHooker Appointed to the Command of the Army of the Potomac--His Plan of\r\nCampaign Against Richmond--Stonewall Jackson's Stampede of the Eleventh\r\nCorps--Critical Situation of the Union Army--Death of Jackson--Battle of\r\nChancellorsville--Defeat of Hooker--The Second Confederate\r\nInvasion--Battle of Gettysburg--The Decisive Struggle of the War--Lee's\r\nRetreat--Subsequent Movements of Lee and Meade--Confederate\r\nPrivateering--Destruction of the _Nashville_--Failure of the Attacks on\r\nCharleston--The Military Raids--Stuart's Narrow Escape--Stoneman's\r\nRaid--Morgan's Raid in Indiana and Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were now such immense armies in the field and military operations\r\nwere conducted on so vast a scale that the reader must carefully study\r\nthe situation in order to gain an intelligent idea of the progress of\r\nthe momentous events. We will give our attention first to operations in\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\nThere were four Union armies in that section. The first was the one\r\nunder Rosecrans, which, on the opening days of the year, won the victory\r\nat Murfreesboro' or Stone River, an account of which is given in the\r\npreceding chapter. The second was near Holly Springs, under General\r\nGrant; a third was in New Orleans, under General Banks, who had\r\nsucceeded General Butler; and the fourth was in Arkansas. The main\r\nobject of all these armies was to open the Mississippi. When that should\r\nbe accomplished, the Confederacy would be split in two. Hundreds of\r\nthousands of beeves were drawn from Texas and the country beyond the\r\nMississippi, and to shut off this supply would be one of the most\r\neffective blows that could be struck against the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT BEFORE VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman had failed to capture Vicksburg, and General Grant\r\nassumed command of the forces besieging it. He saw that the defenses\r\nfacing the Mississippi and the lower part of the Yazoo were too powerful\r\nto be taken by storm. He decided as a consequence to turn the rear of\r\nthe lines, and, securing an entrance into the upper part of the Yazoo,\r\nreach the rear of the batteries at Haines' Bluff.\r\n\r\nIn this important work he received valuable help from the ironclads of\r\nAdmiral Porter. With one of them he opened communication with the\r\nsquadron in the lower part of the Mississippi and disabled a Confederate\r\nsteamer under the guns of Vicksburg. Two of the boats groped their way\r\nthrough the swamps and wooded creeks, where nothing more than canoes and\r\ndugouts had ventured before, obtained a great deal of cotton and burned\r\nmuch more, disregarded the torpedoes and fought the rebels along the\r\nbanks, explored new routes, and in the end both were captured by the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL PORTER.]\r\n\r\nSeveral ingenious plans were tried to capture these formidable\r\nfortifications. One was an attempt to force a passage into the Upper\r\nYazoo. Another was to open a new channel for the Mississippi. Both were\r\nfailures, but the levees along the Yazoo were cut and many acres in the\r\nrear of Vicksburg overflowed, while a great deal of Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana was flooded. The object of all this was to shut off the\r\nsupplies of Vicksburg. Admiral Farragut now strove to pass from the\r\nlower Mississippi by the Port Hudson batteries to Vicksburg. The effort\r\nwas made on the night of March 14th, which was of inky darkness. The\r\napproach was discovered by the enemy, who kindled large bonfires on the\r\nbank which revealed the passing vessels. The latter opened on the\r\nbatteries with great effect, but only two, including the flagship, were\r\nable to get past, the thirteen being forced to turn back. The\r\n_Mississippi_ ran aground and was set on fire and abandoned. With the\r\ntwo vessels in hand, Farragut blockaded the mouth of the Red River and\r\ngave valuable help to General Grant, but the land forces advancing from\r\nBaton Rouge to aid in the attack on Vicksburg turned back upon learning\r\nof the failure of Farragut's fleet to run past the batteries.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had set out to capture Vicksburg and nothing could turn\r\nhim from his purpose. His aim was to sever the Confederate\r\ncommunications with the east by turning the defenses of the Yazoo and\r\nthe Mississippi. General McClernand was sent in the latter part of March\r\nto occupy New Carthage to the south, while General Banks, by advancing\r\nfrom New Orleans, threatened Port Hudson in conjunction with the fleet\r\nlying near.\r\n\r\nBanks' force was so large that the most the enemy could do was to delay\r\nhis advance by burning bridges and obstructing the river. In the latter\r\npart of April, he established himself at Simmsport, near the junction of\r\nthe Atchafalaya and the Mississippi. Admiral Porter, who was lying with\r\nhis fleet above Vicksburg, now made the attempt to join Farragut below,\r\nand it proved one of the most exciting experiences of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING THE BATTERIES.\r\n\r\nNaturally a dark night--April 16th--was selected, and eight gunboats,\r\nthree transports, and several barges loaded with supplies silently\r\ndropped down the river in the impenetrable mist, while the thousands of\r\nUnion troops intently watched the hulls as they melted from sight in the\r\ngloom. The hope was general that they would be able to float past\r\nundiscovered, and, when an hour of intense stillness went by, the\r\nwatchers and listeners began to breathe more freely, though their\r\nanxiety was only partly lifted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID G. FARRAGUT.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly two crimson lines of fire flamed along the river front, and the\r\nearth trembled under the stupendous explosion. The ships had been\r\ndetected, and the river was swept by a tempest of shot and shell that it\r\nseemed must shatter to fragments every one of the craft. It should be\r\nremembered that these batteries extended for a long distance along the\r\nshore, and they opened one after the other, as the ships came opposite.\r\nThus the fleet became the target of battery after battery, and had a\r\ncontinuous and extended gantlet to run before reaching safety.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats returned the fire as they swept by, and many of their shots\r\nwere effective, but in such a duel the advantage is always with the land\r\nbatteries. One of the transports was disabled, and another, directly\r\nbehind her, had to stop to avoid running into the injured craft. The\r\ncrew of the former, finding themselves the centre of a terrific fire,\r\nlaunched the yawl, and, leaping into it, pulled for the shore. They had\r\nscarcely left their vessel when it was fired by a shell, and, aflame\r\nfrom stem to stern, it drifted down stream. Meanwhile, the transport\r\nthat had grounded was towed out of danger. With this exception, the\r\nwhole fleet got safely past, the loss being only one man killed and two\r\nwounded on Porter's flagship.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was greatly pleased with this success. A few nights later\r\na second attempt was successful. He was thus enabled to send supplies to\r\nthe army, with which he intended to attack Vicksburg on the south.\r\nGradually shifting his own position, he reached a point opposite Grand\r\nGulf, a short distance below the mouth of the Big Black River.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF GRAND GULF.\r\n\r\nAlthough Grand Gulf was strongly fortified its quick capture was a\r\nnecessity. McClernand had been ordered several times to attack it, but\r\nhe was so laggard that Grant himself undertook the task. It proved one\r\nof extreme difficulty, and he was obliged to make a change of plans, but\r\nhe handled his troops with admirable skill and with such effect that the\r\nConfederate commander's position at Grand Gulf became untenable and he\r\nwithdrew. Grant rode into town and found the place in the possession of\r\nAdmiral Farragut.\r\n\r\nThe success was so brilliant that Pemberton, the Confederate general\r\ncommanding the forces at Vicksburg, became alarmed and telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Jo Johnston for reinforcements, but Johnston was too much\r\noccupied with Rosecrans in Tennessee to spare any of his men, and about\r\nall he could do was to send encouraging words to his subordinate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT'S FINE GENERALSHIP.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant never displayed his great genius more strikingly than in\r\nthe operations before Vicksburg. For days and nights he seemed scarcely\r\nto eat or sleep. He was here, there, and everywhere, and was familiar\r\nwith all the minute details of his momentous enterprise. General\r\nPemberton confessed in his reports that the amazing activity of Grant\r\n\"embarrassed him.\"\r\n\r\nGrand Gulf was made the base of operations, and, well aware that\r\nreinforcements would be hurried to the garrison, Grant hastened his\r\nmovements. While pressing his attack he learned that Johnston was at\r\nJackson with a strong force, with which to reinforce Pemberton. He\r\nimmediately dispatched McPherson and Sherman thither, and, after a\r\nfierce fight, Jackson was captured. Grant learned from deserters that\r\nJohnston, the chief Confederate commander in that section, had sent\r\nperemptory orders to Pemberton to leave Vicksburg and attack him in the\r\nrear. The latter, with his usual promptness, met this danger, and, by\r\ndecisively defeating the enemy at Champion Hill, he accomplished the\r\nsplendid feat of keeping Johnston out of Vicksburg and Pemberton in. It\r\nwas a great exploit, for Jo Johnston was one of the ablest generals of\r\nthe war, and the fine campaign which he had planned was brought to\r\nnaught. Not only was he kept out of Vicksburg, but it was made\r\nimpossible for him to send any help to Pemberton, around whom the Union\r\ncommander was drawing the coils more tightly each day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANT AFTER THE BATTLE OF BELMONT.]\r\n\r\nStill the defenses of Vicksburg were too powerful to be captured by\r\nstorm, and Grant did the only thing possible--he besieged the city. The\r\nsiege began about the middle of May. The garrison had provisions for\r\nbarely two months, from which they had to supply the inhabitants of the\r\ntown. Jo Johnston saw the peril and set to work with such vigor to raise\r\na force to send to the relief of Pemberton, that Grant was hurried into\r\nmaking an assault on the rebel works. This took place before daylight on\r\nthe morning of May 19th. Though successful at first, the Federals were\r\nrepulsed. A grand assault was undertaken three days later and pressed\r\nwith the utmost bravery, but it resulted in another repulse, in which\r\nthe loss of the assailants was three times greater than that of the\r\ndefenders. Porter tried to help with his fleet, but his vessels were so\r\nbadly injured by the batteries that they were compelled to withdraw from\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThis failure showed that it was useless to try to capture Vicksburg\r\nexcept through a regular siege, which was pressed henceforth without\r\nintermission. Shells were thrown into the doomed city night and day; the\r\npeople lived in caves, on short rations, and underwent miseries and\r\nsufferings which it is hard to comprehend in these days. All the time\r\nGrant was edging closer and closer. Parallels and approaches were\r\nconstructed; mines sunk and countermining done. Several attempts were\r\nmade to relieve Vicksburg, but the bulldog-like grip of Grant could not\r\nbe loosened, and the condition of the garrison became much like that of\r\nCornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL OF VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nThe defenders displayed the greatest bravery and endurance, and held out\r\nuntil the time came when it was apparent that it was a choice between\r\nsurrender and starving to death. That man who prefers to starve rather\r\nthan submit to a magnanimous foe is a fool. Pemberton had 21,000 troops\r\nunder his command, but 6,000 were in the hospitals, while Grant had\r\nfully 60,000 soldiers waiting and eager to make the assault. On the 3d\r\nof July, a flag of truce was displayed in front of Vicksburg, and a\r\nmessage was sent to the Union commander, asking for an armistice with a\r\nview of arranging for the capitulation of Vicksburg. Grant's reply was\r\nhis usual one, that the only terms he could accept were unconditional\r\nsurrender, and he, therefore, declined to appoint commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe commanders then met between the lines, and Grant agreed that the\r\ngarrison should be paroled and allowed to go to their homes, and that\r\nthe city, stores, arms, and supplies should belong to the conquerors.\r\nAlthough the Union commander's terms \"unconditional surrender\" sounded\r\nharsh, they always proved of a generous nature. There was a good deal of\r\ncriticism in the South of Pemberton for selecting the 4th of July for\r\nmaking his submission, since the Union people would be sure to make a\r\ngreater ado over it. Pemberton's explanation was that he believed Grant\r\nwould be more disposed to give him liberal terms on that date than on\r\nany other, and it would not be strange if he was partly right.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CAPTURE.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Vicksburg was one of the most important Union successes\r\nof the war. In his official report, Grant thus summarized the results of\r\nhis campaign: \"The defeat of the enemy in five battles outside of\r\nVicksburg; the occupation of Jackson, the capital of Mississippi; and\r\nthe capture of Vicksburg, its garrison and munitions of war; a loss to\r\nthe enemy of 37,000 prisoners, at least 10,000 killed and wounded, and\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, who can never be collected or reorganized.\r\nArms and munitions of war for an army of 60,000 men have fallen into our\r\nhands, beside a large amount of other public property and much that was\r\ndestroyed to prevent our capturing it.\"\r\n\r\nThus one of the great objects of the war was accomplished. The\r\nMississippi was opened throughout its entire length and the Confederacy\r\ncut in twain. That President Davis felt the gravity of the blow (to\r\nwhich one still more decisive was added about the same time) was proven\r\nby his proclamation calling into service all persons in the Confederacy\r\nnot legally exempt, who were between the ages of eighteen and forty-five\r\nyears. He also appointed the 21st of August as a day of fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer.\r\n\r\nGrant's magnificent success greatly increased his popularity in the\r\nNorth. His praises were in every one's mouth; he was declared to be the\r\nablest military leader that had yet appeared, and more than one saw in\r\nhim the coming saviour of the Union.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is slightly premature to say that the Mississippi was opened\r\nfrom the hour of the surrender of Vicksburg. Port Hudson held out, but\r\nits fall was a corollary of that of the more important city. It had\r\nstoutly resisted several attacks, but, realizing the hopelessness of his\r\nsituation, the Confederate commander surrendered on the 9th of July, and\r\nthe opening of the Mississippi was fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSECRANS' CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recall that the battle of Murfreesboro' took place at\r\nthe very beginning of the year. Rosecrans, the Union commander, never\r\nrepeated the brilliant skill he had shown in fighting Bragg on Stone\r\nRiver. He seemed to think that that repulse of the enemy was sufficient\r\nto last a good while, for he remained idle throughout the several months\r\nthat followed. There were a number of brisk skirmishes and fights, but\r\nnone was of importance. When June arrived without anything of account\r\nhaving been accomplished, the government suggested to Rosecrans that it\r\nwas time he took steps to drive Bragg into Georgia and thus secure\r\nEastern Tennessee, where the sentiment was strongly Union.\r\n\r\nRosecrans hesitated, but upon receiving a stronger intimation that he\r\nought to be up and doing, he began a series of movements, in the latter\r\npart of June, which caused Bragg to withdraw to Chattanooga, where he\r\nintrenched himself. Burnside then advanced from Ohio into Eastern\r\nTennessee, but was so delayed that Bragg was heavily reinforced from\r\nVirginia. To protect his communications, he fell back, however, upon\r\nthe approach of the Federal army, which occupied Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nUnaware of the increased strength of the enemy, Rosecrans divided his\r\narmy into three columns, separated by wide spaces of mountains, and\r\nmarched in loose order against his foe, observing which Bragg determined\r\nto overwhelm each of the columns in detail.\r\n\r\nThe first demonstration was against General George H. Thomas, who\r\ncommanded the Federal left, and was encamped at the foot of Lookout\r\nMountain. That splendid officer eluded the enemy launched against him,\r\nand effected a junction with the other two corps.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the centre of the three columns was attacked, but the\r\nassault was repulsed, and the reunited Union army on the 18th of\r\nSeptember stood on the western bank of the Chickamauga, which stream was\r\nwell named, for the Indian word means \"the river of death.\" The position\r\nwas twelve miles from Chattanooga, and it was a perilous one, for, as\r\nhas been stated, Bragg had been heavily reinforced, and Longstreet with\r\na powerful column of veterans from Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was\r\napproaching. He, therefore, decided to make an attempt to recover\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates crossed the Chickamauga, and, on the morning of the\r\n19th, Rosecrans opened the battle by attacking the enemy's right wing.\r\nThe entire armies were soon involved, and the fighting lasted until\r\nnightfall, with the result in favor of the Confederates. Although forced\r\nfrom several positions, they gained and held the road leading to\r\nChattanooga, and the Union troops were driven almost to the base of\r\nMissionary Ridge.\r\n\r\nLate that night, Longstreet arrived with his fire-seasoned veterans. He\r\nwas one of Lee's best lieutenants, and it was arranged that the battle\r\nshould be renewed the next morning at daybreak, with Longstreet\r\ncommanding the left wing. From some cause, the Confederate attack was\r\ndelayed until ten o'clock, the delay giving the Federals time to throw\r\nup a number of breastworks. Against these Bragg repeatedly charged with\r\nhis right wing, but was repulsed each time.\r\n\r\nThomas, in command of the Union left, also repelled a sharp attack, but\r\nLongstreet routed Rosecrans, and, discerning a gap caused by the\r\ntransfer of the Union centre to strengthen the left, Longstreet led his\r\nmen impetuously into the opening, thus splitting the Union army in two.\r\nStriking in both directions, he threw the two divisions into such\r\ndisorder and confusion that the frightened Rosecrans galloped in hot\r\nhaste to Chattanooga to secure his supply train and the pontoon-bridges\r\nover the Tennessee. At the same time, he telegraphed the terrifying\r\ntidings to Washington that the whole Union army had been beaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA.\"\r\n\r\nAt a crisis in the tremendous battle, General Hood, one of the\r\nConfederate leaders, was wounded, and a halt was made until another\r\nofficer could be brought up to take his place. Short as was the delay,\r\nit gave the Unionists time to rally and strengthen their endangered\r\npoints. Despite this advantage, the telegram of Rosecrans would have\r\nbeen verified and the magnificent army destroyed except for one man. He\r\nwas George H. Thomas, the heroic commander of the Union left. Longstreet\r\nlaunched his veterans against him again and again, but he beat them back\r\nin every instance. Never did men fight more bravely than those\r\nAmericans, arrayed against each other, and never was finer generalship\r\ndisplayed than by General Thomas, whose wonderful defense that day won\r\nfor him the name by which he will always be remembered--\"The Rock of\r\nChickamauga.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE H. THOMAS.\r\n\r\n\"The Rock of Chickamauga.\"]\r\n\r\nHolding his heroes well in hand, Thomas was ready to renew the battle\r\nthe next day, but Bragg did not molest him. The Confederates, however,\r\nhad won a victory, for they drove the Federals from the field and\r\nretained possession of it. Thomas fell slowly back toward Chattanooga,\r\npresenting a firm front to the enemy.\r\n\r\nChickamauga ranks as one of the great battles of the war. The Union\r\nlosses were: killed, 1,656; wounded, 9,749; missing, 4,774; total,\r\n16,179. The Confederate losses were: killed, 2,268; wounded, 13,613;\r\ncaptured and missing, 1,090; total, 16,971.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERSEDURE OF ROSECRANS BY THOMAS.\r\n\r\nRosecrans' conduct of this battle caused his supersedure by Thomas,\r\nwhile several division commanders were suspended, pending an inquiry\r\ninto their course. President Davis removed General Leonidas Polk, who\r\nwas thought to have shown hesitancy of action at critical points. Bragg,\r\nhowever, was the most blamable, for, with the advantage overwhelmingly\r\nin his favor, he refused to permit Longstreet to follow up his success.\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the Confederate President was his strong\r\nlikes and dislikes. He was a personal enemy of Jo Johnston, and more\r\nthan once humiliated him, but he was also a friend of Bragg, and, in the\r\nface of indignant protests, retained him in chief command in the\r\nsouthwest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Union army reached Chattanooga intrenchments were thrown\r\nup. Bragg appeared before the town on the 23d, and, finding the position\r\ntoo strong to be carried by assault, he laid siege to it. The situation\r\nof the army became so dangerous that great uneasiness was felt in\r\nWashington, where the wise step was taken of sending General Grant\r\nthither, with his appointment to the command of the entire West.\r\nAbundant reinforcements were hurried to the imperiled point, the entire\r\nEleventh and Twelfth Corps from the Army of the Potomac forming the\r\nprincipal commands. The Federals became much the stronger, but Bragg did\r\nnot abandon his siege of Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nRecalling the advance of Burnside from the Ohio to the relief of\r\nRosecrans, it should be stated that he did not arrive in time to take\r\npart in the battle of Chickamauga, but occupied Knoxville on the 9th of\r\nSeptember. Bragg sent Longstreet with a strong force to attack Burnside,\r\nthe Confederate commander thereby weakening his army, which could ill\r\nstand it. Grant arrived at Chattanooga on the night of October 20th, and\r\ntelegraphed Burnside to hold Knoxville at all hazards, while he gave his\r\nattention to Bragg.\r\n\r\nSherman came up with his troops November 15th, and a week later Grant\r\nhad an army of 80,000 men on the ground, while the removal of Longstreet\r\nleft Bragg with only 50,000. His line, twelve miles long, embraced two\r\nelevations commanding a view of Chattanooga Valley. Lookout Mountain was\r\non the south, while Missionary Ridge on the east was not quite so high.\r\nThe Confederate left wing rested on the former, and the right on\r\nMissionary Ridge, with the Chattanooga flowing between. Bragg was\r\njustified in considering his position impregnable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE ABOVE THE CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nGrant, however, held a different opinion. On the night of the 23d the\r\nenemy's picket lines were forced back and an improved position secured.\r\nThe following morning, Hooker, having already crossed the river, was\r\nordered to attack the position on Lookout Mountain. His movements were\r\nhidden for a time by a dense fog, and it was his intention to stop as\r\nsoon as the enemy's rifle-pits at the base were captured; but, when this\r\nwas accomplished, the men were carried away by their enthusiasm, noting\r\nwhich Hooker ordered them to charge the Confederate position. Up the\r\nmountain the cheering, eager fellows swept with irresistible valor. The\r\nStars and Stripes was planted on the crest and 2,000 of the fleeing\r\nConfederates were made prisoners. The fog still lay heavy in the valley\r\nbelow, a fact which has led to the battle being called the \"Battle above\r\nthe Clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE CONFEDERATES.\r\n\r\nThe following morning was also foggy, but, when it lifted, Sherman's\r\ncorps was seen advancing against the Confederate right, close to\r\nChickamauga station. In the face of a heavy artillery fire the Federals\r\npressed on, but at the end of an hour they were compelled to retreat. By\r\norder of Grant the attack was renewed, but another severe repulse\r\nfollowed. Next a general movement against the left centre was ordered,\r\nand this was successful. The enemy was driven in confusion toward\r\nRinggold, to the southeast, while a large number of prisoners and a vast\r\namount of supplies were captured.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hooker pursued and drove the Confederates out of Ringgold, but\r\nthey assumed so strong a position at Taylor's Ridge that Grant ordered\r\nhim not to attack, but to remain and hold Ringgold, Sherman, in the\r\nmeantime, marching against Longstreet. Bragg had blundered so much in\r\nconducting this disastrous campaign that President Davis was forced to\r\nreplace him with Hardee.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING OF THE SIEGE OF KNOXVILLE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Longstreet was besieging Burnside at Knoxville, where the\r\n15,000 Union troops were threatened with starvation. The town was\r\ninvested November 17th, and the next day some of the outworks were\r\ncarried. Well aware that Grant, after his defeat of Bragg, would hurry\r\nto the relief of Knoxville, Longstreet attacked on the 29th, but\r\nsuffered a bloody repulse. He stubbornly held his ground until he\r\nlearned that Sherman was close upon him, when he withdrew and started on\r\nhis march to Virginia. The campaign soon ended in Tennessee, which was\r\nvirtually recovered to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe reader will note that we have described the leading events in the\r\nWest and Southwest from the opening of the year to its close. Once more\r\nit is necessary to return to January, 1863, in order to give a history\r\nof the most important campaign of all--that against Richmond, which was\r\ndefended by the formidable Army of Northern Virginia, under the command\r\nof General Robert E. Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNSIDE SUPERSEDED BY HOOKER.\r\n\r\nBurnside's management of the attack on Fredericksburg in December, 1862,\r\nwas so incompetent and disastrous that it was impossible for him to\r\nretain the chief command. Knowing that several of his generals had\r\nseverely criticised him, Burnside sent a list of names to Washington,\r\ngiving the government the choice of removing them or accepting his\r\nresignation. Prominent on Burnside's \"black list\" was the name of\r\nHooker. On the 26th of January Burnside's resignation was accepted, and\r\nHooker was made his successor.\r\n\r\nThe morale of the grand organization had been injured by its wretched\r\nleadership, but the material itself could not have been finer. Hooker\r\nset resolutely to work, and, by the 1st of May, the army was well\r\ntrained and disciplined, and numbered 130,000 men, of whom fully 12,000\r\nwere cavalry. Lee had about half as many troops.\r\n\r\nKnowing it would not do to remain idle when the beautiful spring weather\r\ncame, Hooker had been carefully planning for another campaign against\r\nRichmond. He had won a fine reputation for himself as a fighter and\r\nskillful corps commander, and the hopes were high that he would lead his\r\nsuperb army directly into the rebel capital. Everything seemed to be in\r\nhis favor, and the campaign opened promisingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nHooker's plan was to assail Lee at two points. The Rappahannock and\r\nRapidan were to be crossed a short distance west of Fredericksburg, and\r\nthe left wing attacked. While this was going on, Hooker's own left wing\r\nwas to occupy the heights and secure possession of the Richmond\r\nRailroad. The powerful Union cavalry were to ride around Lee's position\r\nand cut off his retreat to Richmond. This involved the destruction of\r\nthe railroads and bridges over the North and South Anna Rivers.\r\n\r\nThis important movement was begun April 27th. The main portion of the\r\ncorps of Meade, Howard, and Slocum, numbering 36,000 men, marched thirty\r\nmiles up the Rappahannock and crossed the stream without resistance. A\r\nforce then moved ten miles down the other side of the river, driving\r\naway several Confederate detachments, and opened the way for Couch with\r\n12,000 men to cross and join the other three corps. Taking different\r\nroutes, the 48,000 advanced toward Chancellorsville, which had been\r\nnamed as the rendezvous. They were soon followed by Sickles with 18,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Union movement had progressed thus far that Lee\r\nread its purpose. He hastily called in his divisions, and, on the\r\nforenoon of May 1st, the Army of Northern Virginia was drawn up in\r\nbattle-line in front of that dense-wooded district known as the\r\nWilderness.\r\n\r\nExultingly confident, Hooker ordered an advance that day from near\r\nChancellorsville toward Fredericksburg. Hardly had he started when he\r\nlearned that Lee was moving against him; he, therefore, paused and threw\r\nup defenses. His aim was to flank Lee, and, to prevent it, the\r\nConfederate commander took desperate chances. Keeping up a rattling\r\ndemonstration in front he sent Stonewall Jackson with 30,000 men around\r\nthe right of the Union army. Had Hooker known of this daring movement,\r\nhe could easily have crushed each division in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONEWALL JACKSON'S FLANK MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nJackson carried out his programme with fearful completeness. Without his\r\npurpose being suspected, he traveled fifteen miles, reaching the road\r\nleading from Orange to Fredericksburg, on the southern side of the\r\nRapidan. He was thus within two miles of General Howard's Eleventh\r\nCorps. The men were preparing supper with no thought of danger, when the\r\nair was suddenly split by thousands of \"rebel yells,\" and the graybacks\r\nrushed out of the woods and swept everything before them. The whole\r\nEleventh Corps broke into a wild panic, and ran for their lives toward\r\nChancellorsville.\r\n\r\nThe German division especially, under the command of Carl Schurz, were\r\nirrestrainable in their terror.\r\n\r\nThe majority, however, stood their ground bravely, and their commanders\r\nput forth every effort to stop the wild stampede. A partial success was\r\nattained, and the artillery poured in a fire which checked the pursuit.\r\nFortunately night was at hand, and the fighting soon ceased. The\r\nposition of the Union army was critical in the extreme. It was squeezed\r\nin between Chancellorsville and the fork of the two rivers. What fate\r\nawaited it on the morrow?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS J. (\"STONEWALL\") JACKSON.]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the Confederate cause received the severest blow in\r\nits history. That remarkable man, Stonewall Jackson, was confident that\r\nthe destruction of the Union army was at hand, and he was impatient for\r\nthe morrow that he might complete the fearful work. In the dusk of early\r\nevening he rode forward, accompanied by several of his staff, to\r\nreconnoitre the Union position. Passing beyond the outer line of\r\nskirmishers, the party halted in the gloom and peered toward the Federal\r\nlines. Dimly discerned by a South Carolina regiment, they were mistaken\r\nfor the enemy, and a volley was fired at them. One of the staff was\r\nkilled and two wounded. Comprehending the blunder, Jackson wheeled and\r\ngalloped into the woods, but before the shelter could be reached, the\r\nSouth Carolinians fired a second time.\r\n\r\nJackson was struck twice in the left arm and once in the right hand. His\r\nfrightened horse whirled about and plunged away. A limb knocked off his\r\nhat and came near unseating him, but he managed to keep in the saddle\r\nand guide his steed into the road, where one of his staff helped him to\r\nthe ground and supported him to the foot of a tree where he was laid\r\ndown. He was suffering so keenly that he could not walk, and was carried\r\non a litter to the rear. For a part of the way, all were exposed to such\r\na hot artillery fire that they had to pause several times and lie down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE IN WHICH STONEWALL JACKSON DIED.]\r\n\r\nThe wound grew so bad that the arm was amputated, but pneumonia\r\nfollowed, and Jackson died on Sunday, May 10th. His last words, uttered\r\nin his delirium, were: \"Let us cross over the river and rest under the\r\nshadow of the trees.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe fighting at Chancellorsville was renewed at daylight, May 3d.\r\nGeneral Stuart succeeded to the command of Jackson's corps. The\r\nsuperior numbers of the Union army and its compact formation gave it\r\nall the advantage. It needed but one thing to insure overwhelming\r\nsuccess: that was competent leadership, and that was the one thing which\r\nit did not have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FATAL WOUNDING OF \"STONEWALL\" JACKSON\r\n\r\nAfter his first great victory at Chancellorsville, \"Stonewall\" Jackson\r\nbelieved that the destruction of the Union army was at hand, and in his\r\nimpatience for the morrow, that he might complete the work, he rode in\r\nthe dusk of the evening beyond his outposts to reconnoiter. A South\r\nCarolina regiment mistook his party for the enemy and fired upon them,\r\nmortally wounding their great commander.]\r\n\r\nWith the weaker army still separated, it forced the Federals back toward\r\nthe river, where Hooker was compelled to form a second line. Holding him\r\nthere, Lee turned toward Sedgwick, who was at Fredericksburg with 25,000\r\nmen. He had a good opportunity to assail Lee in the rear, but failed to\r\ndo so, and gave his efforts to capturing Marye's Heights, which was\r\ndefended by a weak garrison. It was easily taken, and Sedgwick sent a\r\ncolumn in the direction of Chancellorsville. On the road it encountered\r\nsome breastworks, thrown up by the force which Lee had dispatched to\r\ncheck Sedgwick's advance. He was driven back, and the rebels, having\r\nbeen reinforced, recaptured Marye's Heights. Sedgwick made a hurried\r\nretreat, and thenceforward formed no factor in the battle.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of him, Lee turned again upon Hooker. Early on the 5th,\r\nhe placed a number of his guns within range of United States Ford and\r\ndropped a few shells among the wagon trains. Nothing, however, was\r\naccomplished on this day, except that the dry and parched woods were set\r\non fire, and many of the wounded who were unable to help themselves were\r\nburned to death. Every horror that can be conceived as to war was added\r\nto the awful scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETREAT OF THE UNION ARMY.\r\n\r\nA heavy rainstorm caused the Rapidan and Rappahannock to rise so rapidly\r\nthat Hooker decided, after consulting his officers, to get back while he\r\nhad the chance to do so. The bridges were covered with pine boughs, and,\r\nwith the noise of the wheels deadened by the crashing thunder, the\r\nwagons and artillery made the passage without discovery. By the\r\nfollowing morning, the entire Army of the Potomac was once more across\r\nthe Rappahannock and marching back to its old camp at Falmouth, and once\r\nmore the advance against Richmond had ended in woeful disaster.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the Unionists at Chancellorsville were: killed, 1,606;\r\nwounded, 9,762; missing, 5,919; total, 17,287. The losses of the\r\nConfederates were: killed, 1,665; wounded, 9,081; captured and missing,\r\n2,018; total, 12,764.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND CONFEDERATE INVASION.\r\n\r\nAfter such a frightful Union defeat, it was no wonder that the\r\nConfederates again decided to invade the North. Lee was not favorable to\r\nthe plan, but he must have felt that the prospect of success was better\r\nthan ever before. He made his preparations with great care, and\r\nstrengthened his army to 75,000 men, divided into three corps, commanded\r\nrespectively by Longstreet, Ewell, and A.P. Hill. He had in addition\r\n15,000 cavalry under General J.E.B. (\"Jeb\") Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe northward march was begun the first week in June. Longstreet and\r\nEwell advanced upon Culpeper, while Hill remained near Fredericksburg,\r\naiming to deceive Hooker as to his intentions. Hooker quickly perceived\r\nthat most of the rebel army had disappeared from his front, but it was a\r\nmystery to him where it had gone. A reconnoissance developed the\r\ndirection taken by the two missing corps. Unsuspicious of the grand\r\nproject that was in the mind of the Confederate commander, Hooker moved\r\ndown the Shenandoah Valley, taking the same course as Lee, but with the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEE'S PRELIMINARY MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nPassing through the defiles in this range, Lee dropped down on Milroy at\r\nWinchester before he dreamed of danger. Most of his 7,000 men were\r\ncaptured, but Milroy and a few escaped by a hurried flight at night. All\r\ndoubt now had vanished as to the intentions of Lee; he was aiming for\r\nPennsylvania, at the head of a powerful, well-organized army; Washington\r\nand probably Philadelphia were in peril. The only check that could block\r\nits way was the Army of the Potomac, and Hooker lost no time in moving.\r\nHe reached Fairfax Court-House on the night of the 14th, thus placing\r\nhimself on the flank of Ewell. The Confederates, however, held the\r\nmountain passes securely and nothing effective could be done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE.\r\n\r\nConfederate Commander-in-chief at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n(1807-1870).]\r\n\r\nOn the 22d the headquarters of Lee were at Beverly, ten miles from\r\nWinchester, with which Lee kept up communication through A.P. Hill's\r\ncorps, which was between Culpeper and Front Royal. Ewell, without\r\nhesitation, forded the Potomac into Maryland, while his cavalry pushed\r\non into Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBy this time the government was so alarmed that President Lincoln, on\r\nthe 15th of June, called by proclamation on the governors of Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia to furnish 100,000 militia\r\nfor the protection of those States. Pennsylvania, the one in greatest\r\ndanger, was so laggard that she asked New Jersey to come to her help,\r\nand that little State gallantly did so.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MEADE APPOINTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\r\nHooker deserved credit for appreciating his own unfitness for the\r\ncommand of the army that was again to fight Lee. He crossed the Potomac\r\nJune 26th, making a movement which threatened Lee's communications, and\r\nresigned the next day. At Frederick, on the 28th, he published an order\r\nto the effect that the army had been placed in charge of Major-General\r\nGeorge G. Meade.\r\n\r\nThis was an excellent appointment. Although Meade was born, in 1815, in\r\nCadiz, Spain, he was an American, because his father was the United\r\nStates naval agent at the time. Meade was graduated from West Point in\r\n1835, and won distinction in the war with the Seminoles and with Mexico.\r\nThe appointment was a surprise to him, but it pleased everybody, and he\r\nmodestly took hold, resolved to do the best he could.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nHe adhered to the general plan of Hooker. His army numbered about\r\n100,000, and no braver men lived anywhere. Nearly all of Lee's troops\r\nwere north of the Potomac, partly in Maryland and partly in\r\nPennsylvania. On the 27th of June the whole army was at Chambersburg,\r\nPennsylvania; but Lee was greatly hampered by the absence of Stuart and\r\nhis cavalry. That dashing officer was very fond of making raids, and,\r\ngiving a wider meaning to the permission of Lee than that general\r\nintended, he was off on another of his bold ventures, with no certainty\r\nas to when he would return. It was upon him that Lee was obliged to\r\ndepend for news of the Union army. Receiving none, he was on the point\r\nof advancing against Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, when he\r\npaused upon receiving the first reliable news of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nMeade had pushed his advance beyond Middleton, where his left was lying\r\nwhen he took command of the army at Frederick. This action of the Union\r\ncommander looked as if he intended to cross the mountains and attack the\r\nConfederate rear. Ewell's corps was at York and Carlisle, but still\r\nthere was no knowledge whatever of the whereabouts of Stuart.\r\n\r\nLee now attempted to draw Meade away from the Potomac by concentrating\r\nhis army to the east of the mountains. Hill and Longstreet advanced to\r\nGettysburg, while Ewell was ordered to do the same. Lee himself lagged\r\nin the hope that Stuart would join him, and because of that, Meade, who\r\nwas keenly on the alert, arrived in the neighborhood of Gettysburg\r\nfirst. On the last day of June, he was within a few miles of the town,\r\nwhile Lee was somewhat to the north and making for the same place.\r\n\r\nStuart and his cavalry had harassed the Army of the Potomac in Virginia,\r\nbut, unable to stay its advance, they crossed the Potomac, and, moving\r\nto the east of Meade, entered Carlisle shortly after Ewell had left for\r\nGettysburg. Stuart's delay was owing to the fact that he did not know\r\nLee's whereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DAY AT GETTYSBURG.\r\n\r\nThe two mighty armies were now within striking distance of each other.\r\nIt was yet early in the day when a collision took place between a\r\nConfederate division and Reynolds' Corps on the western side of the\r\ntown. Reynolds was one of the best officers in the Union army. He was\r\nengaged in directing the movements of his troops when he was struck in\r\nthe head by a rifle bullet and instantly killed. General Doubleday\r\nsucceeded him in command, but was unable to drive back the enemy. Howard\r\narrived with the Eleventh Corps early in the afternoon and took charge\r\nof the whole force. These were mainly composed of Germans, who were so\r\noverwhelmingly stampeded by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville. They\r\ndid not appear to have recovered from that panic, for they fled\r\npell-mell through Gettysburg, with the enemy whooping at their heels.\r\nNearly all who did not run were cut down or they surrendered.\r\n\r\nMeade had sent Hancock to take chief command, and, aided by Howard, he\r\nrallied the shattered corps on the crest of Culp's Hill, behind the\r\ntown. The keen eye of Hancock was quick to see that it was here the\r\ndecisive struggle must take place, and he sent an urgent message to\r\nMeade, fifteen miles away, to lose not an hour in hurrying his troops\r\nforward. Meade followed the counsel. Some of his men arrived that night,\r\nsome the next morning, while those from the greatest distance did not\r\ncome in until the following afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe line as formed by Hancock extended along Cemetery Hill on the west\r\nand south of Gettysburg. It was a formidable position, and Lee, after\r\ncarefully studying it, decided to await the arrival of Longstreet and\r\nEwell with their corps before making his attack. Events proved that the\r\ndecision was a disastrous mistake on the part of the Confederate\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nWhen the sultry first day of July drew to a close, the Federal right\r\nheld Culp's Hill, the centre Cemetery Hill, the left was along Cemetery\r\nRidge, and the reserve on the right. This line curved in the form of a\r\nhorseshoe, with the projecting portion facing Gettysburg. Sedgwick, it\r\nwill be remembered, had not arrived, but the force was composed of a\r\nhundred thousand veterans who had 200 cannon at command.\r\n\r\nThat night the Confederates were in Gettysburg and a part of the country\r\nto the east and west. Ewell formed the left and held the town; Seminary\r\nRidge was occupied by Hill's Corps, and confronted the centre and left\r\nof the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. When Pickett's division came up on\r\nthe 3d, it was placed on the right of Hill's position and faced Round\r\nTop.\r\n\r\nMost of the succeeding day was spent by both armies in preparing for the\r\ntremendous death-grapple. At about five o'clock in the afternoon, having\r\nbecome convinced that the left and left centre of the Union line were\r\nthe weakest points, Lee directed his efforts against them. They were\r\nheld by Sickles, who made a blunder by advancing a portion of his force\r\nbeyond the battle-line and seizing a ridge. It was because of this\r\nblunder that the first Confederate attack was made at that point.\r\n\r\nLongstreet and Ewell opened with a sharp cannonade, under cover of which\r\nHood's division impetuously assaulted Sickles' left. He drove his right\r\nwing between Sickles left and Little Round Top, and was steadily\r\nsucceeding in his purpose, when one of those apparently trifling things,\r\nfor which no one can account, interfered and brought about momentous\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE G. MEADE.\r\n\r\nThe Union commander-in-chief at Gettysburg.]\r\n\r\nLittle Round Top was the key to the position, and yet it had no real\r\ndefenders. Had Hood known this, he could have seized it without the\r\nslightest difficulty. Perceiving its importance, he began working his\r\nway toward it, and only some extraordinary interference could prevent it\r\nspeedily falling into his possession.\r\n\r\nBut General Gouverneur Warren, chief engineer, and his officers had\r\nclimbed Little Round Top and were using it as a signal station. Soon the\r\nshots began flying so fast about them that they made hurried\r\npreparations to leave. Warren, however, saw the importance of holding\r\nthe hill, and told his associates to make a pretense of doing so, while\r\nhe looked around for a force to bring to the spot.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a large body of reinforcements were hurrying past to\r\nSickles, who had sent an urgent call for them. Without hesitation,\r\nGeneral Warren detached a brigade for the defense of Little Round Top.\r\nThey ran up the slope, dragging a battery with them. Hardly had they\r\ndone so, when Hood made a fierce charge. The fighting was of the most\r\nfurious nature, and it looked for a time as if the yelling Texans would\r\ncarry the hill, but they were forced back, and, pressing their way up\r\nthe ravine at the foot, turned the left Union flank, but were forced\r\nagain to retire by a bayonet charge.\r\n\r\nSickles called for reinforcements when attacked by Longstreet, but with\r\ntheir aid he could not hold his position. He was rushed back by the\r\nterrific fighter, and Longstreet gained and held the key-point of the\r\nline against the repeated assaults of the Union troops. Not only that,\r\nbut he was resistlessly advancing, when more reinforcements arrived and\r\nattacked him just as he reached a wheatfield and grove of woods on the\r\nwestern side of Plum Run. The Confederates were beginning to give way,\r\nwhen Hood, having carried Sickles' extreme left, arrived. A vehement\r\ncharge carried Hood through two divisions that were doubled back on\r\ntheir main line on Cemetery Ridge; Sickles' left having been crushed,\r\nhis centre and right were assailed, and the latter was driven back. In\r\nthe fighting Sickles lost a leg as well as his entire advanced position.\r\n\r\nThe close of the 2d of July brought brilliant, but only partial, success\r\nto the Confederates. After reaching Cemetery Ridge, Longstreet's men\r\nwere repulsed by Hancock. The Confederate commander fell back to the\r\nwestern side of the wheatfield, where he remained until morning. Ewell,\r\nimpetuously attacking the Union right centre at Cemetery and Culp's\r\nHill, kept back Federal reinforcements from reaching the left, which\r\nLongstreet was pounding, drove out the Federal artillery and infantry,\r\nand held the works. This was a most important success, and, if Ewell\r\ncould maintain his position throughout the morrow, General Lee would\r\nhave a chance of taking Meade's line in reverse. The conclusion of the\r\nsecond day, therefore, left matters in dubious shape for both sides.\r\nWhile the Confederates had made gains, they were not decisive. Still\r\nthey were such as to cause grave concern on the part of Meade and his\r\nbrother officers, who held a long, anxious consultation, and discussed\r\nthe question whether it was not wise to fall back and assume a new and\r\nstronger position. The decision was to remain where they were.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD DAY.\r\n\r\nNaturally Lee strengthened his force near where Ewell had secured a\r\nlodgment within the breastworks of Culp's Hill, with the purpose of\r\nmaking his main attack there; but Meade could not fail to see the\r\nutmost importance of driving out the enemy from his position. He shelled\r\nit at daylight on the 3d, and sent a strong body of infantry against the\r\nintruders. The Confederates made a desperate resistance, but in the end\r\nwere expelled, and the Union line re-established.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this miscalculation of Lee compelled him to change\r\nhis plans. Sitting on his horse, riding back and forth, often halting\r\nand scanning the battlefield through his glasses, and continually\r\nconsulting his officers, he finally decided to direct his supreme effort\r\nagainst the Union centre. Success there meant the defeat and rout of the\r\nUnion army, for, if the two wings could be wedged apart, they would be\r\noverwhelmed and destroyed by the charging Confederates.\r\n\r\nBut the impressive fact was as well known to the Federals as to their\r\nenemies, and nothing was neglected that could add to the strength of\r\ntheir position. All night long troops kept arriving, and in the\r\nmoonlight were assigned to their positions for the morrow. It took Lee\r\nseveral hours to complete his preparations for the assault upon the\r\nUnion centre. At noon he had 145 cannon posted on Seminary Ridge,\r\nopposite Meade's centre, while Meade had 80 pieces of artillery lined\r\nalong the crest of Cemetery Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKETT'S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nAt noon the Confederates opened with all their cannon, their object\r\nbeing to silence the batteries in front, to clear the way for the charge\r\nagainst the Union centre. The eighty Federal pieces replied, and for two\r\nhours the earth rocked under the most prodigious cannonade ever heard on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic. Then the Union fire gradually ceased, and, as\r\nthe vast volume of smoke slowly lifted, a column of 5,000 gray-coated\r\nmen were seen to issue from the Confederate lines more than a mile away\r\nand advance at a steady stride toward the Union intrenchments. Their\r\nbayonets shone in the afternoon sun, and their fluttering battle-flags,\r\nthe splendid precision of their step, and their superb soldierly\r\nappearance made so thrilling a picture that an involuntary murmur of\r\nadmiration ran along the Union lines, even though these same men were\r\nadvancing to kill and wound them.\r\n\r\nThey formed the division of General George E. Pickett, and no more\r\nmagnificent charge was ever made. They advanced in a double line, their\r\nown artillery ceasing firing as they gradually passed within range with\r\nbeautiful regular step, which seemed to hasten, as if even with their\r\nperfect discipline they could not restrain, their eagerness to join in\r\nthe death-grapple.\r\n\r\nThe Union artillery remained silent until half the space was crossed,\r\nwhen it burst forth, and the Confederates went down by the score. The\r\ngaps could be seen from every point of the immense field, but those who\r\nwere unhurt immediately closed up and continued their dauntless advance\r\nwithout a tremor. Coming still closer under the murderous artillery\r\nfire, they broke into the double-quick, and it looked as if nothing\r\ncould check them.\r\n\r\nWaiting until within a few hundred yards, the artillery and musketry\r\nblazed forth again. Through a misconception of orders, the Confederate\r\nline had become disjointed, and the supports of Pickett were repelled\r\nand a large number killed or taken prisoners, but Pickett's own division\r\ncame on unfalteringly, let fly with a volley at the breastworks in front\r\nof them, and then, with their resounding yells, dashed up the crest of\r\nCemetery Ridge and drove out the defenders at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUSHING'S LAST SHOT.]\r\n\r\nImmediately the hand-to-hand fighting became like that of so many\r\ntigers. Guns were clubbed, men wrestled and fought and struck with their\r\nbare fists, while a fire was converged upon the assailants of so\r\nmurderous a nature that even the daring Pickett saw that every one of\r\nhis men would be killed, if they remained. He gave the order to fall\r\nback, and the survivors broke into a run down the slope for their own\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawn by W.B. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nPICKETT'S RETURN FROM HIS FAMOUS CHARGE.\r\n\r\n\"General, my noble division is swept away.\"]\r\n\r\nPickett's charge ranks among the famous in modern history, and was one\r\nof the most striking incidents of the war. The double column which\r\nmarched across that fire-swept field numbered 5,000 of the flower of the\r\nConfederate army. Thirty-five hundred were killed, wounded, or taken\r\nprisoners. Of the three brigade commanders, one was killed, the second\r\nmortally wounded, and the third badly hurt. One only of the fourteen\r\nfield officers returned, and out of the twenty-four regimental officers,\r\nonly two were unhurt. The ferocity of the charge resulted in many deaths\r\namong the Unionists, and General Hancock was painfully wounded, but\r\nrefused to leave the field until the struggle was over.\r\n\r\nAnd all this valor had gone for naught. The Southerners had attempted an\r\nimpossible thing, and the penalty was fearful. Unspeakably depressed,\r\nGeneral Lee saw the return of the staggering, bleeding survivors, and,\r\nriding among them, he did all he could to cheer the mute sufferers by\r\nhis sympathetic words. He insisted that the failure was wholly his own\r\nfault, and that not a word of censure should be visited upon anyone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe expectation of the Confederates was that the Federals would follow\r\nup this repulse with an immediate advance, and preparations were\r\nhurriedly made to repel it; but the ammunition was low on Cemetery\r\nRidge, and the furious struggle had exhausted the defenders. Day was\r\nclosing and the great battle of Gettysburg was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEARFUL LOSSES.\r\n\r\nThe Union losses were: killed, 3,070; wounded, 14,497; missing, 5,434;\r\ntotal, 23,001. The Confederate losses were: killed, 2,592; wounded,\r\n12,706; captured and missing, 5,150; total, 20,448. To quote from Fox's\r\n\"Regimental Losses in the American Civil War:\" \"Gettysburg was the\r\ngreatest battle of the war; Antietam the bloodiest; the largest army was\r\nassembled by the Confederates in the Seven Days' Fight; by the Unionists\r\nat the Wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECISIVE BATTLE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nGettysburg has been styled the Waterloo of the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\"Highest tide\" was reached by its fortunes during those three first days\r\nin July, 1863. Lee put forth his supreme effort, and the result was\r\ndefeat. He and his leading generals clearly saw that their cause had\r\nreceived its death-blow, and, as one of them expressed it, the fighting\r\nthenceforward was for terms. They were not yet conquered, and severe\r\nwork remained to be done, but never again did the Lost Cause come so\r\nnear success. Its sun, having reached meridian, must now go down until\r\nit should set forever in gloom, disaster, and ruin.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee could not fail to perceive that all that remained to him was\r\nto leave the country before overtaken by irretrievable disaster. He\r\nwithdrew Ewell's Corps that night from Gettysburg and posted it on\r\nSeminary Ridge, where intrenchments were thrown up. The town was\r\noccupied by Meade, and the dismal morrow was spent by the Confederates\r\nin burying their dead and removing their wounded. At night the retreat\r\nwas begun by the Chambersburg and Fairfield roads, which enter the\r\nCumberland Valley through the South Mountain range. Great battles always\r\nproduce violent storms, and one of these added to the unspeakable\r\nwretchedness of the homeward march. Finding Lee was retreating, Meade\r\nsent Sedgwick in pursuit. The rear guard was overtaken on the night of\r\nthe 6th, but its position was too strong to be attacked and the Union\r\narmy took a route parallel to that of the Confederate. There was\r\nconsiderable skirmishing, but nothing decisive occurred, and the\r\nretiring army reached Hagerstown, where it found the fords of the\r\nPotomac so swollen as to be impassable. Lee, therefore, intrenched, and\r\nstayed where he was until the 13th, by which time the river had fallen\r\nsufficiently to be forded, and he once more re-entered Virginia. Meade,\r\nfearful that the great prize was about to escape him, made strenuous\r\nefforts to intercept him, but failed, and returned to the Rappahannock,\r\nwhile Lee established himself in the neighborhood of Culpeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO GETTYSBURG CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\nA period of inactivity now followed. Both Meade and Lee sent strong\r\ndetachments from their armies to the southwest, where, as we have seen,\r\nthey had the most active kind of service at Chickamauga, Missionary\r\nRidge, Knoxville, and other places. When Lee had considerably depleted\r\nhis forces, Meade thought the prospect of success warranted his making a\r\nmove against him. Accordingly, he sent his cavalry across the\r\nRappahannock, whereupon Lee withdrew to a position behind the Rapidan,\r\nwhich was so strong that Meade dared not attack, and he, therefore,\r\nattempted a flank movement. Before, however, it could be carried out, he\r\nwas called upon to send two more of his corps to the southwest, because\r\nof the defeat of Rosecrans at Chickamauga. These corps were the Eleventh\r\nand Twelfth under the command of Hooker.\r\n\r\nThis withdrawal compelled Meade to give up his purpose, and he remained\r\non the defensive. By-and-by, when the troops were returned to him, he\r\nprepared once more to advance, but Lee anticipated him by an effort to\r\npass around his right flank and interpose between him and Washington.\r\nCrossing the Rapidan on the 9th of October, he moved swiftly to Madison\r\nCourt-House, without detection by Meade, who did not learn of it until\r\nthe next day, when his outpost was attacked and driven back on the main\r\narmy at Culpeper. This was proof that the Union right flank had been\r\nturned, and Meade immediately started his trains toward the\r\nRappahannock, following a few hours later with his army. On the further\r\nside of Bull Run, he fortified himself so strongly that Lee saw it was\r\nuseless to advance further, and, on the 18th of October, he returned to\r\nthe line of the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\nMeade started for Richmond on the 7th of November. The Confederates were\r\nfound occupying earthworks on the north of the Rappahannock. An\r\nimpetuous assault drove them out and across the river. Meade pushed on\r\nto Culpeper, and Lee hurriedly retreated across the Rapidan.\r\n\r\nMeade's judgment was that no further advance should be made, but the\r\nclamor of the North forced him to try another of the many attempts to\r\ncapture Richmond. He crossed the river on the 26th and 27th of November,\r\nhis aim being to divide the Confederate army by a rapid march on Orange\r\nCourt-House. But it seemed as if the flood-gates of heaven were then\r\nopened. The rain fell in torrents day and night, and the country became\r\na sea of mud and water. Bridges had to be laid to connect different\r\nportions of the army, and all offensive movements were for a while out\r\nof the question. The delay gave Lee time to form his troops into a\r\ncompact mass, so that when the Unionists were ready to attack, it was so\r\nevident that another Fredericksburg massacre would follow that the plan\r\nwas abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Lee felt so strong that he was disposed to advance himself,\r\nbut was dissuaded by the belief that some blunder of the Union commander\r\nwould give him a better opportunity, but Meade was too wise to do so. On\r\nthe 1st of December he returned to his old quarters on the Rapidan. The\r\nweather had become extremely cold, and both armies went into winter\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe principal military movements of this year have now been described,\r\nbut it remains to tell of the operations on the seacoast and of the\r\nleading military raids.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATEERING.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates displayed great activity and ingenuity in the\r\nconstruction of ironclads and in running the blockade. Their vessels\r\ncontinually dodged in and out of a few of the leading ports, the\r\nprincipal one being Wilmington, North Carolina. The profits in a single\r\ncargo of a blockade-runner were so enormous that the owners were\r\nenriched by several successful voyages, while a single one would\r\nreimburse them for the loss of their ship. Under such circumstances it\r\nwas no wonder that they took desperate chances, and firms were organized\r\nwho paid liberal salaries to the officers of vessels, who advertised\r\namong their friends the regular dates of their departure, and, the worst\r\nof it was, they were very regular in keeping them.\r\n\r\nThe _Alabama_ and other privateers were busy on the ocean, and the\r\nConfederates strained every nerve to send others to sea. The _Nashville_\r\nwas a fine steamer that was in the Ogeechee River, Georgia, waiting for\r\na chance to slip out and join the commerce destroyers. She had a\r\nvaluable cargo of cotton, and the Federal cruisers were alert to prevent\r\nher escape. They would have gone up the river after her, but there were\r\ntoo many torpedoes waiting for them, and the guns of Fort McAllister\r\nwere too powerful.\r\n\r\nCaptain Worden, of the old _Monitor_, was now in command of the\r\n_Montauk_, and he was delighted on the night of February 27th to observe\r\nthe _Nashville_ lying stuck fast in shallow water above Fort McAllister.\r\nThe opportunity was too tempting to be neglected, and the next morning,\r\ndespite a hot attack from the fort, he fired into the _Nashville_ until\r\nshe broke into flames and soon after blew up.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE ATTACKS ON CHARLESTON.\r\n\r\nNaturally the desire was strong in the North to humble Charleston, where\r\nthe baleful secession sentiment was born and brought all the woe upon\r\nthe country. General Beauregard was in command of that department, and\r\nhe made every preparation for the attack, which he knew would soon come.\r\nIn a proclamation he urged the removal of all non-combatants, and called\r\nupon the citizens to rally to the defense of the city.\r\n\r\nA fleet of ironclads was always lying outside of Charleston, watching\r\nfor an opportunity to give its attention to the forts or city. One\r\ntempestuous night in January a couple of rams dashed out of the harbor,\r\nand, in a ferociously vicious attack, scattered the ironclads, and\r\ncompelled a gunboat to surrender. Thereupon the Confederates claimed\r\nthat the blockade had been raised, but no one paid any attention to the\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nAn expedition was carefully organized for the capture of Charleston, and\r\nplaced in command of Admiral Samuel F. Dupont. The fleet, numbering a\r\nhundred vessels, left the mouth of the North Edisto River on the 6th of\r\nApril, and on the same day crossed the bar and entered the main channel\r\non the coast of Morris Island.\r\n\r\nA dense haze delayed operations until the following day, when a line of\r\nbattle was formed by the ironclads, the wooden vessels remaining outside\r\nthe bar. A raft was fastened to the front of the _Weehawken_, with which\r\nit was intended to explode the torpedoes. The cumbrous contrivance\r\ngreatly delayed the progress of the fleet, which advanced slowly until\r\nthe _Weehawken_ had passed the outer batteries and was close to the\r\nentrance to the inner harbor. Then Fort Moultrie fired a gun, instantly\r\nfollowed by that of Fort Sumter, and the batteries on Sullivan and on\r\nMorris Island. Then a hawser, which the Confederates had stretched\r\nacross the channel with the purpose of clogging the screws of the\r\npropellers, was encountered, the _Weehawken_ was compelled to grope\r\naround for a better passage, and everything went wrong. The _New\r\nIronsides_ made an attempt to turn but became unmanageable, two other\r\nironclads ran afoul of her, and matters were in a bad way when Admiral\r\nDupont signaled for each one to do the best it could.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, eight ironclads secured position in front of Fort Sumter,\r\nat distances varying from a third to half a mile. This placed them in\r\ndirect range of 300 heavy guns which concentrated their appalling fire\r\nupon them, the shots following one another as rapidly as the ticking of\r\na watch. The _Keokuk_, which ran close to Fort Sumter, was struck ninety\r\ntimes, in the course of half an hour, in the hull and turrets, and\r\nnineteen shots pierced her sides close to and below the water-line. Her\r\ncommander with great difficulty extricated her from her perilous\r\nposition, and she sank the next day.\r\n\r\nThe fight was another proof of the fact that, in all such engagements,\r\nthe preponderating advantage is with the land batteries. The ships of\r\nthe squadron were severely injured, but they inflicted no perceptible\r\ndamage upon the forts. Admiral Dupont had gone into the battle against\r\nhis judgment, and he now signaled for the ships to withdraw. All with\r\nthe exception of the _New Ironsides_ returned to Port Royal on the 12th\r\nof April.\r\n\r\nThis failure caused great disappointment in the North and to the\r\ngovernment. Admiral Dupont was ordered to hold his position inside of\r\nCharleston bar, and to prevent the enemy from erecting any new defenses\r\non Morris Island. The admiral replied that he was ready to obey all\r\norders, but, in his judgment, he was directed to take an unwise and\r\ndangerous step. Thereupon he was superseded by Rear-Admiral Dahlgren,\r\nand preparations were begun for a combined land and naval attack upon\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTACK ON CHARLESTON, AUGUST 23D TO SEPTEMBER 29, 1863\r\n\r\n\"After a time eight ironclads secured position in front of Fort Sumpter,\r\nat a distance varying from a third to half a mile. This placed them in\r\ndirect range of 300 heavy guns, which concentrated their appalling fire\r\nupon them, the shots following one another as rapidly as the ticking of\r\na watch.\"]\r\n\r\nOne of the best engineer officers in the service was General Quincy A.\r\nGillmore, who had captured Fort Pulaski at Savannah the previous year.\r\nHe was summoned to Washington, and helped the government to arrange the\r\nplan of attack upon Charleston. The most feasible course seemed to be\r\nfor a military force to seize Morris Island and bombard Fort Sumter from\r\nthat point, the fleet under Dahlgren giving help. There was hope that\r\nthe monitors and ironclads would be able to force their way past the\r\nbatteries and approach nigh enough to strike Charleston.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a sufficient detachment was gathered on Folly Island, which\r\nlies south of Morris Island, and batteries were erected among the woods.\r\nOn the 10th of July, General Strong with 2,000 men attacked a force of\r\nSouth Carolina infantry at the southern part of Morris Island, and drove\r\nthem to Fort Wagner at the opposite end. The Confederates were\r\nreinforced, and, in the attack on Fort Wagner, the Federals were\r\nrepulsed and obliged to retreat, with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 18th, in the midst of a violent thunderstorm, a\r\ndetermined assault was made upon Fort Wagner, one of the newly formed\r\nnegro regiments being in the lead. The fighting was of the most furious\r\ncharacter, but the Federals suffered a decisive defeat, in which their\r\nlosses were five times as great as those of the defenders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gillmore carried parallels against the fort, and the ironclads\r\nassisted in the bombardments; but, though it continued for weeks, the\r\ncity of Charleston seemed to be as far from surrender as ever. A part of\r\nthe time the weather was so intolerably hot that operations were\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nGillmore, however, was so near Charleston that he was able to reach it\r\nwith his heaviest guns, and he prepared to do so. His principal piece\r\nwas a Parrott, which threw a 100-pound ball, and was christened the\r\n\"Swamp Angel.\"\r\n\r\nThe first shot was fired at midnight, August 22d. As the screeching\r\nshell curved over and dropped into the sleeping city, with its frightful\r\nexplosion, it caused consternation. The people sprang from their beds\r\nand rushed into the streets, many fleeing to the country. Beauregard\r\nsent an indignant remonstrance, telling Gillmore that all civilized\r\nnations, before bombarding a city, gave warning that the non-combatants\r\nmight be removed. Gillmore explained his reason for his course, and\r\nagreed to wait until the following night before renewing the\r\nbombardment.\r\n\r\nAt that hour it was resumed, with the promise of grave results, but at\r\nthe thirty-sixth discharge the Swamp Angel exploded, and thus terminated\r\nits own career. General Gillmore continued to push his parallels against\r\nFort Wagner. Although the ironclads could not pass the obstructions to\r\nthe inner harbor so as to help, Gillmore persevered, and finally\r\nrendered Forts Wagner and Gregg untenable. The evacuation occurred on\r\nthe night of September 6th. As soon as the Federals took possession,\r\nthey had to make all haste to repair the ramparts to protect themselves\r\nagainst the fire from Fort Moultrie and James Island, whose guns were\r\nimmediately turned upon them.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Fort Sumter was in ruins, its artillery could not be\r\nserved, and its garrison comprised only a detachment of infantry. Upon\r\nbeing summoned to surrender by Dahlgren, the commander invited the\r\nadmiral to come and take the fort. The effort to do so was made by a\r\nmilitary force and the ironclads on the 9th of September, but failed. No\r\nmore important attempts followed. The result had shown that the defenses\r\nof Charleston were practically impregnable, and, though shells were\r\noccasionally sent into the forts and city, the latter was not captured\r\nuntil near the end of the war, and then it was brought about, as may be\r\nsaid, by the collapse of the Confederacy itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the war began the Southerners were the superiors of the Northerners\r\nas regarded their cavalry. Horseback riding is more common in the South\r\nthan in the North, but it did not take the Union volunteers long to\r\nacquire the art, and, as the war progressed, the cavalry arm was greatly\r\nincreased and strengthened. One of the natural results of this was\r\nnumerous raids by both sides, some of which assumed an importance that\r\nproduced a marked effect on the military campaigns in progress, while in\r\nother cases, the daring excursions were simply an outlet to the\r\nadventurous spirit which is natural to Americans and which manifests\r\nitself upon every opportunity and occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF GENERAL STUART'S RAIDS.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the embarrassment caused General Lee during his\r\nGettysburg campaign by the absence of Stuart with his calvary on one of\r\nhis raids. In the autumn, Stuart started out on a reconnaissance to\r\nCatlett's Station, where he observed French's column in the act of\r\nwithdrawing from the river, whereupon he turned back toward Warrenton.\r\nTaking the road leading from that town to Manassas, he found himself\r\nunexpectedly confronting the corps of General Warren. Thus he was caught\r\ndirectly between two fires and in imminent danger of defeat and capture,\r\nfor his force was but a handful compared with either column of the\r\nFederals. Fortunately for the raider, he and his men were in a strip of\r\nwoods, and had not been seen, but discovery seemed certain, for their\r\nenemies were on every hand, and the slightest inadvertence, even such as\r\nthe neighing of a horse, was likely to betray them.\r\n\r\nStuart called his officers around him to discuss what they could do to\r\nextricate themselves from their dangerous situation. No one proposed to\r\nsurrender, and it looked as if they would be obliged to abandon their\r\nnine pieces of horse artillery and wait until night, when they might cut\r\ntheir way out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWAMP ANGEL BATTERY BOMBARDING CHARLESTON.]\r\n\r\nStuart did not like the idea of losing his guns. At any rate, he would\r\nnot consent, until another plan which had occurred to him was tried.\r\nSeveral of his men were dismounted, and each was furnished with a musket\r\nand infantry knapsack. The uniform was not likely to attract notice in\r\nthe darkness, in case they met any Federals. These messengers were\r\nordered to pick their way through the Union lines to Warrenton, where\r\nthey would find General Lee, who was to be told of the danger in which\r\nStuart was placed. The Confederate commander could be counted upon to\r\nsend prompt help. Fortunately for Stuart, two of his men succeeded in\r\ngetting through the Union lines and reaching Lee.\r\n\r\nAt the best, however, the night must pass before help could arrive, and\r\nit need not be said that the hours were long and anxious ones to the\r\ntroopers hiding in the woods, with the Federal camp-fires burning on\r\nevery side, and the men moving about and likely to come among them at\r\nany moment. They were so close, indeed, that their laughter and\r\nconversation were plainly heard.\r\n\r\nThe alert horsemen suddenly observed two Union officers coming toward\r\nthem. Their careless manner showed they had no thought of danger, and\r\nthey were strolling along, when several dark figures sprang up from the\r\nground, shoved their pistols in their faces, and warned them if they\r\nmade the least outcry they would be instantly shot. The prisoners saw\r\nthe shadowy forms all around them, and were sensible enough to submit\r\nand give no trouble. The night gradually wore away, and just as it was\r\ngrowing light, and while the Union division on the heights of Cedar Run,\r\nwhere they were posted to protect the rear of General Warren, were\r\npreparing breakfast, they were alarmed by the firing of musketry from\r\nthe advance of a Confederate column coming up the Warrenton road.\r\n\r\n\"That means that Uncle Bob has sent us help!\" was the gratified\r\nexclamation of Stuart to his delighted friends; \"we must take a hand in\r\nthis business.\"\r\n\r\nThe cavalry opened fire on the Union lines, which were thrown into some\r\nconfusion, during which Stuart limbered up his guns and quickly rejoined\r\nEwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONEMAN'S RAID.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, General Hooker at the opening of the battle of\r\nChancellorsville was confident that he was going to defeat Lee. In order\r\nto cut off his retreat, he sent General Stoneman, with 2,300 cavalry, on\r\nApril 28th, to the rear of the Confederate army. Stoneman crossed the\r\nRappahannock at Kelly's Ford, where his force was divided. One-half, led\r\nby General Averill, headed for the Orange Railroad, a little way above\r\nCulpeper, then occupied by Fitzhugh Lee, with a force of 500 men. He was\r\nattacked with such vigor that he hurriedly retreated across the Rapidan,\r\nburning the bridges behind him. Averill, instead of pursuing, turned\r\nabout and made his way back to Hooker, in time to accompany him in his\r\nretreat to the northern bank of the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Stoneman crossed the Rapidan on the 1st of May, and galloped\r\nto Louisa Station, on the Virginia Central Railroad, a dozen miles to\r\nthe east of Gordonsville. There he paused and sent out several\r\ndetachments, which wrought a great deal of mischief. One of them\r\nadvanced to Ashland, only fifteen miles from Richmond, while another\r\nwent still closer to the Confederate capital. These bodies of troopers\r\ncaused much alarm, and a general converging of the enemy's cavalry\r\ncaused Stoneman to start on his return, May 6th. For a time he was in\r\ngreat danger, but his men were excellently mounted, and, by hard riding,\r\nthey effected a safe escape along the north bank of the Pamunkey and\r\nYork Rivers, and rejoined their friends at Gloucester.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIERSON'S RAID.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Vicksburg a daring raid was made in the rear of the\r\ncity by Colonel B.H. Grierson. In this instance his work was of great\r\nhelp to General Grant, for he destroyed the Confederate lines of\r\ncommunication, and checked the gathering of reinforcements for\r\nPemberton. Grierson, who conceived the plan of the raid, left La Grange\r\non the 17th of April with three regiments of cavalry. After crossing the\r\nTallahatchie, he rode south to the Macon and Corinth Railroad, where the\r\nrails were torn up, telegraph lines cut, and bridges and other property\r\ndestroyed. To do the work thoroughly detachments were sent in different\r\ndirections, and they spared nothing.\r\n\r\nGrierson now changed his course to the southwest, seized the bridge over\r\nPearl River, burned a large number of locomotives, and forced his way\r\nthrough a wild country to Baton Rouge, which he found in the possession\r\nof Unionists. He had been engaged for a fortnight on his raid, during\r\nwhich he destroyed an immense amount of property, captured several\r\ntowns, fought several sharp skirmishes, and carried off many prisoners.\r\n\r\nJohn S. Mosby was the most daring Confederate raider in the East. Some\r\nof his exploits and escapes were remarkable, and an account of them\r\nwould fill a volume with thrilling incidents. General Lee did not look\r\nwith favor on such irregular work, but accepted it as one of the\r\naccompaniments of war, and it cannot be denied that Mosby gave him\r\nvaluable help in more than one instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN'S RAID.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Morgan was famous in the southwest as a raider and guerrilla. At\r\nthe beginning of July, 1863, he seized Columbia, near Jamestown,\r\nKentucky, and advanced against Colonel Moore at Greenbrier Bridge. His\r\nreception was so hot that he was obliged to retreat, whereupon he\r\nattacked Lebanon, where there was considerable vicious fighting in the\r\nstreets. One of Morgan's regiments was commanded by his brother, who was\r\nkilled. The incensed leader set fire to the houses, and, although the\r\ndefenders surrendered, the place was sacked. Then the invaders retreated\r\nbefore the Union cavalry who were advancing against them. Their course\r\nwas through Northern Kentucky, where they plundered right and left, and\r\nspread dismay on every hand.\r\n\r\nReckless and encouraged by their successes, they now swam their horses\r\nover the Ohio River, and, entering Indiana, gave that State its first\r\nexperience in war. The local militia were called out, but the\r\nexperienced cavalry easily brushed them aside. They knew, however, it\r\nwould be different when they met the regular Union cavalry who were\r\nriding hard after them. To escape them, Morgan started for western\r\nVirginia. When he entered Ohio, the State was terrified, and even\r\nCincinnati trembled, but the raiders had no thought of stopping until\r\nthey readied western Virginia, where they would be safe.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph had carried the news of Morgan's movements everywhere, and\r\nthe determination was general that he should not be allowed to escape\r\nfrom the entanglements in which he and his men had involved themselves.\r\nThe militia guarded all the fords of the Ohio; gunboats steamed back and\r\nforth; the roads were blocked by felled trees, and everything possible\r\nwas done to obstruct the band, who were so laden with plunder that their\r\nexhausted animals had to proceed slowly.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by credible witnesses, who saw the formidable company\r\nriding along the highway when hard pressed, that nearly every man in the\r\nsaddle was sound asleep. They dared not make any extended halt through\r\nfear of their pursuers, and when they did pause it was because of their\r\ndrooping animals.\r\n\r\nReaching the Ohio at last, Morgan planted his field guns near Buffington\r\nIsland, with the view of protecting his men while they swam the river.\r\nBefore he could bring them into use, a gunboat knocked the pieces right\r\nand left like so many tenpins. Abandoning the place, Morgan made the\r\nattempt to cross at Belleville, but was again frustrated. It was now\r\nevident that the time had come when each must lookout for himself.\r\nAccordingly, the band broke up and scattered. Their pursuers picked them\r\nup one by one, and Morgan himself and a few of his men were surrounded\r\nnear New Lisbon, Ohio, and compelled to surrender. He and his principal\r\nofficers were sentenced to the Ohio penitentiary, where they were kept\r\nin close confinement until November 27th, when through the assistance of\r\nfriends (some of whom were probably within the prison), he and six\r\nofficers effected their escape, and succeeded in reaching the\r\nConfederate lines, where they were soon at their characteristic work\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMorgan was a raider by nature, but, as is often the case, the \"pitcher\r\nwent to the fountain once too often.\" While engaged upon one of his\r\nraids the following year he was cornered by the Federal cavalry, and in\r\nthe fight that followed was shot dead.\r\n\r\nFar below these men in moral character were such guerrillas as\r\nQuantrell, who were simply plunderers, assassins, and murderers, who\r\ncarried on their execrable work through innate depravity, rather than\r\nfrom any wish to help the side with which they identified themselves.\r\nMost of them soon ran their brief course, and died, as they had lived,\r\nby violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF LINCOLN (CONCLUDED), 1861-1865.\r\n\r\nWAR FOR THE UNION (CONCLUDED), 1864-1865.\r\n\r\nThe Work Remaining to be Done--General Grant Placed in Command of all\r\nthe Union Armies--The Grand Campaign--Banks' Disastrous Red River\r\nExpedition--How the Union Fleet was Saved--Capture of Mobile by Admiral\r\nFarragut--The Confederate Cruisers--Destruction of the _Alabama_ by the\r\n_Kearsarge_--Fate of the Other Confederate Cruisers--Destruction of the\r\n_Albemarle_ by Lieutenant William B.

The\r\nfirst and most important was that of General Grant against Richmond, or,\r\nmore properly, against Lee, who was still at the head of the unconquered\r\nArmy of Northern Virginia, and who must be overcome before the\r\nConfederate capital could fall. The second was the campaign of General\r\nSherman, through the heart of the Southern Confederacy. Other\r\ninteresting and decisive operations were to be pressed, but all were\r\ncontributory to the two great ones mentioned.\r\n\r\nSeveral momentous truths had forced themselves upon the national\r\ngovernment. It had learned to comprehend the magnitude of the struggle\r\nbefore it. Had the North and South possessed equal resources and the\r\nsame number of troops, the latter could not have been conquered any more\r\nthan the North could have been defeated had the situation been reversed.\r\nBut the North possessed men, wealth, and resources immensely beyond\r\nthose of the South. The war had made the South an armed camp, with\r\nprivation and suffering everywhere, while in the North a person might\r\nhave traveled for days and weeks without suspecting that a domestic war\r\nwas in progress. It was necessary to overwhelm the South, and the North\r\nhad not only the ability to do so, but was resolved that it should be\r\ndone. Its estimates were made on the basis of an army of a million men.\r\nLarge bounties were offered for soldiers, and, when these did not\r\nprovide all that was needed, drafting was resorted to. There had been\r\nrioting and disorder in New York City and other places during the summer\r\nof 1863, when there was a vicious revolt against drafting, but the\r\ngovernment persisted and obtained the men it needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT LEADER.\r\n\r\nAnother proven fact was that the war could not be successfully\r\nprosecuted by a bureau in Washington. This attempt at the beginning had\r\nbrought disaster; but the excuse for this interference was that the\r\nright leaders had not yet appeared. General after general was tried at\r\nthe head of the armies, and had either failed or come short of the\r\nexpected success. The events of 1863, however, indicated unerringly the\r\nright men to whom the destinies of the nation could be safely intrusted.\r\nForemost among these was General Ulysses S. Grant. With that genius of\r\ncommon sense, which always actuated President Lincoln, he nominated him\r\nto the rank of lieutenant-general, the grade of which was revived by\r\nCongress in February, 1864, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on\r\nthe 2d of March. In obedience to a summons from Washington, Grant left\r\nNashville on the 4th of the month, arrived on the 9th, and President\r\nLincoln handed him his commission on the following day.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what your plans are, general,\" said the President, \"nor do\r\nI ask to know them. You have demonstrated your ability to end this war,\r\nand the country expects you to do it. Go ahead, and you may count upon\r\nmy unfaltering support.\"\r\n\r\nGrant modestly accepted the tremendous responsibility, which placed him\r\nin command of all the armies of the United States, and he established\r\nhis headquarters with the Army of the Potomac at Culpeper, Va., March\r\n26, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign determined upon by Grant was to concentrate all the\r\nnational forces into a few distinct armies, which should advance on the\r\nsame day against the opposing Confederate armies, and, by fighting\r\nincessantly, prevent any one of them from reinforcing the other. The\r\narmies of the enemy were themselves to be the objective points, and they\r\nwere to be given no time for rest. Sherman was to advance from Atlanta\r\nagainst Johnston, who had an army larger in numbers than that of Lee;\r\nBanks' army, as soon as it could be withdrawn from the disastrous Red\r\nRiver expedition, was to act against Mobile; Sigel was to pass down the\r\nvalley of Virginia and prevent the enemy from making annoying raids from\r\nthat quarter; Butler was to ascend the James and threaten Richmond; and,\r\nfinally, the Army of the Potomac, under the immediate command of Meade,\r\nwas to protect Washington, and essay the most herculean task of all--the\r\nconquest of Lee and his army.\r\n\r\nOrders were issued by Grant for a general movement of all the national\r\nforces on the 4th of May. Since they were so numerous, and began nearly\r\nat the same time, it is necessary to give the particulars of each in\r\nturn, reserving that of the most important--Grant's own--for the last.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKS' RED RIVER EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nOne of the most discreditable affairs of the war was what is known as\r\nBanks' Red River Expedition. That officer was in command at New Orleans,\r\nwhen it was decided to send a strong force up the Red River, in quest of\r\nthe immense quantities of cotton stored in that region, though the\r\nostensible object was the capture of Shreveport, Louisiana, 350 miles\r\nabove New Orleans, and the capital of the State.\r\n\r\nThe plan was for the army to advance in three columns, supported by\r\nAdmiral Porter with a fleet, which was to force a passage up the Red\r\nRiver. General A.J. Smith was to march from Vicksburg, with the first\r\ndivision of the army, which numbered 10,000 men; Banks was to lead the\r\nsecond from New Orleans, and Steele the third from Little Rock.\r\n\r\nGeneral Edmund Kirby Smith was the Confederate commander of the\r\nTrans-Mississippi Department. Although he had fewer men than the\r\ninvaders, he prepared for a vigorous resistance. He sent Generals Price\r\nand Marmaduke to harass Steele, directed General Dick Taylor to obstruct\r\nthe Red River as much as he could, while he made ready to make the best\r\nfight possible.\r\n\r\nFifty miles above the mouth of the Red River stood Fort de Russy, which,\r\nalthough considerably strengthened, was carried by assault, March 13th.\r\nOn the 15th, Porter's twelve gunboats and thirty transports joined\r\nFranklin at Alexandria. The Federal cavalry occupied Natchitoches, on\r\nthe last day of the month, and in the van of the army; they arrived at\r\nMansfield on the 8th of April, several days after Admiral Porter had\r\nreached Grand Echore on the Red River.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Confederate General Dick Taylor kept fighting and falling\r\nback before the Union advance, but he was continually reinforced, until\r\nhe felt strong enough to offer the Federals battle. This took place on\r\nthe 8th, a short distance from Mansfield. The assault was made with\r\nvehemence, and the Union troops, who were straggling along for miles,\r\nwere taken by surprise and driven into headlong panic, leaving their\r\nartillery behind, and not stopping their flight until under the\r\nprotection of the guns of the Nineteenth Corps. Then a stand was made,\r\nand Banks fell back to his old camping ground at Pleasant Hill. His\r\nintention was to remain there, but his command was so disorganized that\r\nhe continued his flight. The Confederates had already chased them so\r\nlong that they were worn out, while Banks continued retreating until he\r\nreached Grand Echore, where he breathed freely for the first time, since\r\nhe had the protection of the gunboats.\r\n\r\nDisgraceful as was the overthrow of the land forces, a still greater\r\ndisaster threatened the fleet. Porter had gone further up the river, but\r\nreturned to Grand Echore upon learning of the defeat of Banks. He had to\r\nsweep the shores continually with grapeshot, to clear it of the\r\nConfederate sharpshooters, who succeeded in capturing two of the\r\ntransports and blowing up another with a torpedo. The Red River was low,\r\nwith the water falling hourly. The retreating army reached Alexandria on\r\nthe 27th of April, but the fleet was stopped by the shallowness of the\r\nwater above the falls, and the officers despaired of saving it. The only\r\npossible recourse seemed to destroy all the vessels to prevent their\r\nfalling into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE UNION FLEET WAS SAVED.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis, Colonel Joseph Bailey, of Wisconsin, submitted a plan\r\nfor a series of wing dams above the falls, believing they would raise\r\nthe water high enough to float all the vessels. The other engineers\r\nscoffed at the project, but Porter placed 3,000 men and all that Bailey\r\nneeded at his command.\r\n\r\nThe task was a prodigious one, for the falls, as they were termed, were\r\na mile in length and it was necessary to swell the current sufficiently\r\nto carry the vessels past the rocks for the whole distance. The large\r\nforce of men worked incessantly for nearly two weeks, by which time the\r\ntask was accomplished and the fleet plunged through unharmed to the\r\ndeeper water below the falls. The genius of a single man had saved the\r\nUnion fleet.\r\n\r\nBanks, having retreated to Alexandria, paused only long enough to burn\r\nthe town, when he kept on to New Orleans, where some time later he was\r\nrelieved of his command. The Red River expedition was the crowning\r\ndisgrace of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF MOBILE.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of New Orleans, in April, 1862, Mobile was the leading\r\nport of the Southern Confederacy. It was blockaded closely, but the\r\nConfederate cruisers succeeded now and then in slipping in and out,\r\nwhile a number of ironclads were in process of building, and threatened\r\nto break the blockade. Admiral Farragut, the greatest naval hero of\r\nmodern times, after a careful reconnaissance of the defenses, told the\r\ngovernment that if it would provide him with a single ironclad, he\r\nwould capture Mobile. He was promised a strong land force under General\r\nGranger and several monitors, which were sent to him.\r\n\r\nFarragut, fully appreciating the task before him, made his preparations\r\nwith care and thoroughness. His fleet consisted of eighteen vessels,\r\nfour of which--the _Tecumseh_, _Winnebago_, _Manhattan_, and\r\n_Chickasaw_--were ironclads, while the others were of wood. Admiral\r\nBuchanan (commander of the _Merrimac_ in her first day's fight with the\r\n_Monitor_) had less vessels, three gunboats, and the formidable ram\r\n_Tennessee_. But he was assisted by three powerful forts, with large\r\ngarrisons--Gaines, Morgan, and Powell--which commanded the entrance,\r\nwhile the _Tennessee_ was regarded by the Confederates as able to sink\r\nthe whole Union fleet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAILEY'S DAMS ON THE RED RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe wooden vessels were lashed in couples, so as to give mutual help,\r\nand with the _Brooklyn_ and _Hartford_ (Farragut's flagship) in the\r\nlead, the procession entered Mobile Bay on the morning of August 5,\r\n1864. As they came opposite the forts they opened fire upon them, and in\r\na few minutes the latter began their thunderous reply. The battle was\r\ntremendous, and the smoke was so dense that Farragut, who was closely\r\nwatching and directing the action of the fleet, gradually climbed the\r\nrigging, so as to place himself above the obstructing vapor. His height\r\nwas such that the captain of the vessel became anxious for his safety,\r\nsince if he was struck, as looked probable, he was sure to fall to the\r\ndeck or overboard. He, therefore, sent a man after him, with a rope in\r\nhand. Amid the gentle remonstrances of the admiral, this man lashed him\r\nfast to the rigging. When the increasing smoke made it necessary to\r\nclimb higher, Farragut untied the fastenings, and, after he had taken\r\nseveral upward steps, tied himself again.\r\n\r\nThe harbor bristled with torpedoes, to which, however, Farragut and his\r\nofficers paid little heed. The _Tecumseh_, Commander T.A.M. Craven, was\r\nhurrying to attack the ram _Tennessee_, when a gigantic torpedo exploded\r\nbeneath her, smashing in the bottom and causing her to sink so suddenly\r\nthat nearly a hundred men went down with her. The pilot and Craven were\r\nin the pilot house, and, feeling the boat dropping beneath them, both\r\nsprang to the narrow ladder leading out. They reached the foot together,\r\nwhen the commander bowed and, pausing, said to the pilot: \"You first,\r\nsir.\" He had barely time to scramble out, when Captain Craven and the\r\nrest went down.\r\n\r\nThe Union vessels pressed forward with such vigor that, with the\r\nexception of the loss of the _Tecumseh_, the forts were passed without\r\nthe ships receiving serious injury. When, however, the battle seemed\r\nwon, the _Tennessee_ came out from under the guns of Fort Powell and\r\nheaded for the Union vessels. She believed herself invulnerable in her\r\nmassive iron hide, and selected the flagship as her special target. The\r\n_Hartford_ partly dodged her blow and rammed her in return. The ram was\r\naccompanied by three gunboats, which were soon driven out of action, but\r\nthe _Tennessee_ plunged here and there like some enraged monster driven\r\nat bay, but which the guns and attacks of her assailants could not\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nTons of metal were hurled with inconceivable force against her mailed\r\nsides, only to drop harmlessly into the water. She was butted and\r\nrammed, and in each case it was like the rat gnawing a file: the injury\r\nfell upon the assailant. She was so surrounded by her enemies that they\r\ngot in one another's way and caused mutual hurt.\r\n\r\nBut as continual dropping wears away stones, this incessant hammering\r\nfinally showed effect. Admiral Buchanan received a painful wound, and a\r\nnumber of his men were killed; the steering-chains were broken, the\r\nsmoke-stack was carried away, the port shutters jammed, and finally the\r\nwallowing \"sea-hog\" became unmanageable. Then the white flag was\r\ndisplayed and the battle was over. Farragut had won his most memorable\r\nbattle, and the last important seaport of the Confederacy was gone.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Fort Gaines was captured, and Fort Morgan surrendered on\r\nthe 23d of the same month. The land force rendered valuable assistance,\r\nand the blockade became more rigid. The coast line, however, was so\r\nextensive that it was impossible to seal every port, and the Confederacy\r\nobtained a good deal of sorely needed medical supplies through the\r\ndaring blockade-runners, which often managed to elude the watchful\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO ADMIRAL FARRAGUT AT WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThe Confederate cruisers were still roaming the ocean and creating\r\nimmense havoc among the Union shipping. Despite our protests to England,\r\nshe helped to man these vessels, and laid up a fine bill for damages\r\nwhich she was compelled to pay after the close of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATE CRUISERS.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1864, several new cruisers appeared on the ocean, one of\r\nwhich, the _Tallahassee_, boldly steamed up and down off our northern\r\ncoast, and, in the space of ten days, destroyed thirty-three vessels.\r\nThe most famous of all these cruisers was the _Alabama_, which was built\r\nat Birkenhead, England, and launched May 15, 1862. She was a bark-rigged\r\npropeller of 1,016 tons register, with a length over all of 220 feet.\r\nHer two horizontal engines were of 300 horse-power each. When\r\ncompleted, she was sent on a pretended trial trip. At the Azores she\r\nreceived her war material from a waiting transport, while her commander,\r\nCaptain Raphael Semmes, and his officers, who had gone thither on a\r\nBritish steamer, went aboard. The _Alabama_ carried 8 guns and a crew of\r\n149 men, most of whom were Englishmen. Thus fairly launched, she started\r\non her career of destruction, which continued uninterruptedly for\r\ntwenty-two months.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THE ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nOne of the many United States vessels that was engaged in a hunt for the\r\n_Alabama_ was the _Kearsarge_, Captain John Ancrum Winslow. She was of\r\n1,030 tons, carried 7 guns, and had a crew of 163 men, nearly all of\r\nwhom were Americans. On Sunday, July 12, 1864, while lying off the town\r\nof Flushing, Holland, Captain Winslow received a dispatch from Minister\r\nW.L. Dayton, at Paris, notifying him that the _Alabama_ had arrived at\r\nCherbourg, France. Winslow lost no time in steaming thither, and reached\r\nCherbourg on Tuesday, where he saw the cruiser across the breakwater\r\nwith the Confederate flag defiantly flying.\r\n\r\nWinslow did not dare enter the harbor, for, had he done so, he would\r\nhave been obliged, according to international law, to remain twenty-four\r\nhours after the departure of the _Alabama_, which would thereby gain all\r\nthe opportunity she needed for escape. He, therefore, took station off\r\nthe port, intending to wait until the cruiser came out.\r\n\r\nThis precaution, however, was unnecessary, for Semmes, grown bold by his\r\nlong career of destroying unarmed merchantmen, had resolved to offer the\r\n_Kearsarge_ battle. He sent a challenge to Captain Winslow, couched in\r\ninsulting language, and the Union officer promptly accepted it.\r\n\r\nThe news of the impending battle was telegraphed far and wide, and\r\nexcursion trains were run from Paris and other points to Cherbourg. On\r\nSunday, June 19th, fully 15,000 people lined the shores and wharves, and\r\namong them all it may be doubted whether there were more than a hundred\r\nwhose sympathies were not keenly on the side of the _Alabama_. France\r\nwas intensely in favor of the Southern Confederacy, and nothing would\r\nhave pleased Louis Napoleon, the emperor, better than to see our country\r\ntorn apart. He did his utmost to persuade England to join him in\r\nintervening against us.\r\n\r\nWith a faint haze resting on the town and sea, the _Alabama_ steamed\r\nslowly out of the harbor on Sunday morning, June 19th, and headed toward\r\nthe waiting _Kearsarge_. The latter began moving seaward, as if afraid\r\nto meet her antagonist. The object of Captain Winslow, however, was to\r\ndraw the _Alabama_ so far that no question about neutral waters could\r\narise, and in case the _Alabama_ should be disabled, he did not\r\nintend to give her the chance to take refuge in Cherbourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SINKING OF THE \"ALABAMA,\" THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL\r\nCONFEDERATE CRUISERS.\r\n\r\nThe battle between the _Kearsarge_ and the _Alabama_ took place off the\r\ncoast of Holland, June, 1864. \"The famous cruiser was going down, and\r\nthe boats of the _Kearsarge_ were hurriedly sent to help the drowning\r\nmen. The stern settled, the bow rose high in the air, the immense ship\r\nplunged out of sight, and the career of the _Alabama_ was ended\r\nforever.\"]\r\n\r\nThree miles was the neutral limit, but Captain Winslow continued to\r\nsteam out to sea until he had gone nearly seven miles from shore. Then\r\nhe swung around and made for the _Alabama_. As he did so, Captain Semmes\r\ndelivered three broadsides, with little effect. Then fearing a raking\r\nfire, Captain Winslow sheered and fired a broadside at a distance of\r\nlittle more than half a mile, and strove to pass under the _Alabama's_\r\nstern, but Semmes also veered and prevented it.\r\n\r\nSince each vessel kept its starboard broadside toward the other, they\r\nbegan moving in a circular direction, the current gradually carrying\r\nboth westward, while the circle narrowed until its diameter was about a\r\nfourth of a mile.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the fire of the _Kearsarge_ was much more accurate\r\nand destructive than her antagonist's. Hardly had the battle opened when\r\nthe gaff and colors of the _Alabama_ were shot away, but another ensign\r\nwas quickly hoisted at the mizzen. Captain Winslow instructed his\r\ngunners to make every shot count. This was wise, for its effects became\r\nspeedily apparent. The _Kearsarge_ fired 173 shots, nearly all of which\r\nlanded, while of the 370 of the _Alabama_, only 28 hit the _Kearsarge_.\r\nOne of these, a 68-pounder shell, exploded on the quarter-deck, wounding\r\nthree men, one mortally. Another shell, bursting in the hammock\r\nnettings, started a fire, which was speedily extinguished. A third\r\nburied itself in the sternpost, but fortunately did not explode. The\r\ndamage done by the remaining shots was trifling.\r\n\r\nOne of the _Kearsarge's_ 11-inch shells entered the port of the\r\n_Alabama's_ 8-inch gun, tore off a part of the piece, and killed several\r\nof the crew. A second shell entered the same port, killed one man and\r\nwounded several, and soon a third similar shot penetrated the same\r\nopening. Before the action closed, it was necessary to re-form the crew\r\nof the after pivot gun four times. These terrific missiles were aimed\r\nslightly below the water-line of the _Alabama_, with a view of sinking\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour had passed and seven complete revolutions had been\r\ndescribed by the ships, and the eighth had just begun, when it became\r\napparent that the _Alabama_ was sinking. She headed for neutral waters,\r\nnow only two miles distant, but a few well-planted shots stopped her,\r\nand she displayed the white flag. Her race was run, and Captain Winslow\r\nimmediately ceased firing and lowered his only two serviceable boats,\r\nwhich were hurried to the aid of the drowning men. A few minutes later\r\nthe bow of the _Alabama_ rose high in air, and then the noted cruiser\r\nplunged downward, stern foremost, and disappeared forever in the bottom\r\nof the ocean.\r\n\r\nCruising in the neighborhood of the fight was the English yacht\r\n_Deerhound_, which now joined in rescuing the crew of the _Alabama_ at\r\nthe request of Captain Winslow. She was in duty bound to deliver the men\r\nshe saved to Winslow as prisoners of war, but, instead of doing so, she\r\nwatched her chance, and, under full steam, made for Southampton,\r\ncarrying forty-two, among whom were Captain Semmes and fourteen\r\nofficers. Semmes had flung his sword into the sea and leaped overboard\r\nas the _Alabama_ was going down. His vessel had nine killed, ten\r\ndrowned, and twenty-one wounded, while on the _Kearsarge_ of the three\r\nwounded only one died. A demand was made upon the English government for\r\nthe surrender of the men carried away by the _Deerhound_, but it was\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATE OF THE OTHER CRUISERS.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate cruiser _Georgia_ took on the guise of a merchant\r\nvessel, but was seized off the coast of Portugal by the _Niagara_, and\r\nsent to this country as a lawful prize. The _Florida_, while lying in\r\nthe neutral port of Bahia, Brazil, was attacked, October 7th, by the\r\n_Wachuset_, captured, and taken to Hampton Roads. This action was\r\nillegal, being similar to the attack made upon the _Essex_ in the harbor\r\nof Valparaiso in the War of 1812. While awaiting decision as to the\r\nlegality of her capture, she was run into by a steam transport and sunk.\r\nIt may be doubted whether this method of settling the dispute was wholly\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\nThe _Shenandoah_ did most of her destructive work in the far Pacific. As\r\na consequence she did not hear of the conclusion of the war until\r\nseveral months afterward, and she was, therefore, virtually a pirate\r\nfighting under a flag that had no legal existence. Her captain, when the\r\nnews reached him, steamed for England, and turned over his vessel to the\r\nBritish government.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THE \"ALBEMARLE\" BY LIEUTENANT CUSHING.\r\n\r\nProbably no more formidable ironclad was ever built by the Southern\r\nConfederacy than the _Albemarle_. She had been constructed under great\r\ndifficulties, work being begun early in 1863, when, it was said, her\r\nkeel was laid in a cornfield. When finished she was 122 feet over all,\r\nand was propelled by twin screws with engines of 200 horse-power each.\r\nHer armament consisted of an Armstrong gun of 100 pounds at the bow and\r\na similar one at the stern.\r\n\r\nThe _Albemarle_ demonstrated on the first opportunity the appalling\r\npower she possessed. The Federals had captured Plymouth, North Carolina,\r\nwhich was attacked by the Confederates, April 17th and 18th. They were\r\nrepulsed mainly through the assistance of two wooden gunboats, the\r\n_Miami_ and _Southfield_, but the _Albemarle_ came down the river on the\r\n19th and engaged them. The shots of the gunboats did no more harm than\r\nthose of the _Cumberland_ and _Congress_ when fired against the\r\n_Merrimac_. The _Southfield_ was crushed as so much pasteboard, and\r\nsent to the bottom of the river, while the mangled _Miami_ limped off,\r\naccompanied by two tugboats. The next day Plymouth surrendered to the\r\nConfederates. In a fight some weeks later with the Union vessels, the\r\n_Albemarle_ inflicted great injury, and withstood all the ramming and\r\nbroadsides that could be brought against her. She was a most dangerous\r\nvessel indeed, and caused the government a great deal of uneasiness.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made to destroy her, but the Confederates were\r\nwatchful and vigilant. She was moored to the wharf, about eight miles up\r\nthe river, upon the shores of which a thousand men were encamped. They\r\npatrolled the banks and kept bright fires burning all night. The crew of\r\nthe ram were alert, and a boom of cypress logs encircled the craft some\r\nthirty feet from the hull, to ward off the approach of torpedoes. It\r\nwould seem that no possible precaution was neglected.\r\n\r\nAmong the most daring men ever connected with the American navy was\r\nWilliam Barker Cushing. He was born in 1842, and educated at the Naval\r\nAcademy. He was of so wild a disposition that many of his friends saw\r\nlittle hope of his success in life. But, entering the service at the\r\nbeginning of the war, he quickly gave proof of a personal courage that\r\nno danger could affect. He seemed to love peril for the sake of itself,\r\nand where death threatened he eagerly went. He expressed confidence that\r\nhe could destroy the _Albemarle_ and asked permission to make the\r\nattempt. His superior officers knew that if its destruction was within\r\nthe range of human possibility, he would accomplish it, and the ram was\r\nso great a menace to the Union fleet that he was told to try his hand at\r\nthe seeming impossible task.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cushing was a young man of unsurpassable bravery, ready at all\r\ntimes to take desperate chances, there was what might be termed method\r\nin his madness. He needed no one to tell him that in his attempt to\r\ndestroy the _Albemarle_, the slightest neglect in his preparations were\r\nlikely to prove fatal. He, therefore, took every precaution that\r\ningenuity could devise. Two picket boats were constructed with spar\r\ntorpedoes attached, and with engines so formed that by spreading\r\ntarpaulin over them all light and sound was obscured. When traveling at\r\na low rate of speed, they could pass within a few yards of a person in\r\nthe darkness without his being able to hear or see anything. A howitzer\r\nwas mounted at the bow, and the spar, with the torpedo attached, was\r\nfitted at the starboard bow.\r\n\r\nThe boats, having been completed in New York, were sent to Norfolk by\r\nway of the canals. One of them was lost in Chesapeake Bay, but the other\r\nreached its destination. Several days were spent in preparation, and the\r\nnight of October 27th was selected for the venture. It could not have\r\nbeen more favorable, for it was of impenetrable darkness and a fine,\r\nmisty rain was falling. Cushing's companions in the picket boat were:\r\nActing Ensign W.L. Howarth, Acting Master's Mates T.S. Gay and John\r\nWoodman, Acting Assistant Paymaster F.H. Swan, Acting Third Assistant\r\nEngineers C.L. Steever and W. Stotesbury, and eight men whose names were\r\nas follows: S. Higgens, first-class fireman; R. Hamilton, coal heaver;\r\nW. Smith, B. Harley, E.J. Houghton, ordinary seamen; L. Deming, H.\r\nWilkes, and R.H. King, landsmen. He took in tow a small cutter, with\r\nwhich to capture the guard that was in a schooner anchored near the\r\n_Southfield_ that had been raised, and whose duty it was to send up an\r\nalarm rocket on the approach of any expedition against the _Albemarle_.\r\nIt was intended to run ashore a little below the ram, board and capture\r\nher by surprise, and take her down the river.\r\n\r\nIt was about midnight that the start was made. Several of the men were\r\nfamiliar with the river, and the boat kept close to shore, where the\r\ngloom was still more profound. No one spoke except when necessary and\r\nthen in the lowest tones, while all listened and peered into the drizzly\r\nnight. The straining ears could hear only the soft rippling of the water\r\nfrom the prow and the faint muffled clanking of the engine. The speed\r\nwas slackened as they approached the schooner, whose outlines soon\r\nassumed form. No one whispered, but all held themselves ready for the\r\nrush the moment the guard discovered them.\r\n\r\nSentinels, however, are not always alert, and on this dismal night the\r\nguard detected nothing of the phantom craft which glided past like a\r\nshadow with the cutter in tow. This was the first stroke of good\r\nfortune, and each man felt a thrill of encouragement, for only a mile\r\nremained to be passed to reach the _Albemarle_.\r\n\r\nA little way further and the boats swept around a bend in the river,\r\nwhere, had it been daylight, they could have seen the ram. Here was\r\nwhere the fires had been kept blazing the night through, but the guards\r\nwere as drowsy as those below, for they had allowed them to sputter and\r\ndie down to a few embers, while the sentinels were doubtless trying to\r\nkeep comfortable in the wet, dismal night.\r\n\r\nStill stealing noiselessly forward, the men in the boat soon saw the\r\ngloom slowly take shape in front. The outlines revealed the massive\r\nironclad lying still and motionless against the wharf, with not a light\r\nor sign of life visible. The nerves of each of the brave crew were\r\nstrung to the highest tension, when the stillness was broken by the\r\nbarking of a dog. The canine, more vigilant than his masters, gave the\r\nalarm, and instantly it seemed as if a hundred dogs were making night\r\nhideous with their signals. Springing to their feet, the sentinels on\r\nshore discerned the strange boat and challenged it. No reply was given;\r\na second challenge was made, and then a gun was fired. The guards seemed\r\nto spring to life everywhere, more dogs barked, alarm rattles were\r\nsprung, wood was thrown on the fires which flamed up, soldiers seized\r\ntheir weapons and rushed to their places under the sharp commands of\r\ntheir officers.\r\n\r\nCushing now called to the engineer to go ahead under full speed. At the\r\nsame moment, he cut the towline and ordered the men on the cutter to\r\nreturn and capture the guard near the _Southfield_. The launch was\r\ntearing through the water straight for the ram, when, for the first\r\ntime, Cushing became aware of the boom of logs which inclosed it. His\r\nhope now was that these logs had become so slimy from lying long in the\r\nwater that it was possible for the launch to slip over them. With\r\nwonderful coolness, he veered off for a hundred yards, so as to gain\r\nsufficient headway, and then circled around and headed for the ram.\r\n\r\nStanding erect at the bow, Cushing held himself ready to use the torpedo\r\nthe moment he could do so. A volley was fired, which riddled his coat\r\nand tore off the heel of one of his shoes, but he did not falter. Then\r\nfollowed the crisp snapping of the primers of the cannon, which showed\r\nthe immense guns had missed fire. Had they been discharged, the boat and\r\nevery man on it would have been blown to fragments.\r\n\r\n\"Jump from the ram!\" shouted Cushing, as he rushed forward, with the\r\nspeed of a racehorse; \"we're going to blow you up!\"\r\n\r\nThe howitzer at the front of the launch was fired at that moment, and\r\nthen the boat slid over the logs, like a sleigh over the snow, carrying\r\nthe men directly in front of the gaping mouth of the 100-pounder\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nThe critical moment had come, and, crouching forward, Cushing shoved the\r\ntorpedo spar under the overhang, and waited till he felt it rise and\r\nbump against the ship's bottom, when he jerked the trigger line. A\r\nmuffled, cavernous explosion was heard, the ram tilted partly over, and\r\nan immense geyser spouted upward, filling the launch and swamping it.\r\nThe enormous cannon was discharged, but, aimed directly at the boat, the\r\naim was deflected by the careening of the ram, and the frightful charge\r\npassed harmlessly over the heads of the men.\r\n\r\nCushing called to each one to lookout for himself, and leaped as far as\r\nhe could into the water. There he kicked off his shoes, and dropped his\r\nsword and revolver. The incensed Confederates shouted to the Unionists\r\nto surrender, and a number did so; but others, including Cushing,\r\ncontinued swimming until in the darkness they passed out of range.\r\n\r\nIt surpasses comprehension how Cushing escaped. Nearly half his crew had\r\nbeen struck before the launch was submerged, and Paymaster Swan and\r\nanother man were shot at his side. Cushing, Woodman, and Houghton leaped\r\ninto the water at the same time and swam in different directions, no one\r\nknowing where he would come out. Houghton was a powerful swimmer, and,\r\nkeeping cool and husbanding his strength, he made shore a short\r\ndistance below, passed through the enemy's line to the mouth of the\r\nriver, and escaped unharmed.\r\n\r\nCushing continued swimming for nearly a mile, when hearing a splashing\r\nnear him he approached and found Woodman in the last stage of\r\nexhaustion. Cushing gave him all the help he could, but he himself was\r\nworn out, and, despite his efforts, Woodman slipped from his grasp and\r\nwas drowned. When about to give up Cushing's feet touched bottom and he\r\nstruggled to shore, where he sank in a collapse, unable to stir until\r\nmorning. By that time his strength had sufficiently returned to enable\r\nhim to stagger to a swamp where he threw himself down near a path. A few\r\nminutes later, two officers walked by talking earnestly about the\r\nsinking of the _Albemarle_, but the listener could not overhear enough\r\nof their conversation to learn whether or not the ram had been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nGrowing stronger, he pushed into the swamp, until he reached a negro's\r\nhut. There he made himself known, and was received kindly. Cushing asked\r\nthe negro to go to Plymouth and find out whether the _Albemarle_ had\r\nbeen harmed. The African departed, and, when he returned at the end of\r\nseveral hours, his arms were filled with food and his eyes protruding.\r\n\r\n\"Suah as yo's born, marse!\" he gasped, \"de _Albemarle_ am at de bottom\r\nob de riber!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the fact, for the exploding torpedo had gouged more than twenty\r\nsquare feet out of the ram abreast of the port quarter, through which\r\nthe torrent rushed and carried it down in a few minutes. Cushing\r\nremained with his dusky friend until night, when he tramped a long way\r\nthrough swamp and wood to where an old skiff rested against the bank of\r\na small stream. Paddling down this to the river, he kept on until he\r\nreached the Union vessels, where he was taken on board and welcomed as\r\ndeserved the hero who had accomplished that which was beyond the ability\r\nof the whole fleet.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with our account of the closing military operations of\r\nthe war, it is proper to record several minor, but important, events.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1864.\r\n\r\nThe year 1864 was a presidential one. Although Hannibal Hamlin had\r\nserved acceptably as Vice-President throughout Lincoln's first term,\r\npolitical wisdom suggested replacing him with a man more closely\r\nidentified with the struggle for the Union. Hamlin belonged to the State\r\nof Maine, where the voice of disloyalty was never heard. Andrew Johnson,\r\nas we shall learn in the next chapter, was what was termed a war\r\nDemocrat, who had risked his life in the defense of his principles. He\r\nwas nominated for Vice-President, while Lincoln, as was inevitable, was\r\nrenominated for the presidency. The nominees of the Democrats were\r\nGeneral George B. McClellan, the unsuccessful Union commander, and\r\nGeorge H. Pendleton, of Ohio. McClellan acted very creditably when,\r\nfinding that many believed him opposed to the war, he stated in\r\nunequivocal language that he favored its prosecution until the Union was\r\nfully restored. His platform may be described as a criticism of the\r\nmethods of the administration. His position drove away many who would\r\nhave supported a candidate in favor of peace at any price, but he\r\npreserved his self-respect, although it helped to bring his decisive\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nIn the November election the result was: Lincoln and Johnson each 212\r\nelectoral votes; McClellan and Pendleton each 21. On the popular vote,\r\nthe Republican ticket received 2,216,067 and the Democratic 407,342\r\nvotes. Of course, no vote was cast in the eleven seceding States. The\r\nresult was emphatic proof that the North was unalterably opposed to\r\npeace upon any terms except the full restoration of the Union. The great\r\nsuccesses, such as Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Mobile, and the destruction of\r\nthe Confederate cruisers, as well as the rapid exhaustion of the South,\r\ncontributed very much to the success of the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRESS IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nThe distress in the South was intense and grew daily more so. The\r\nConfederate money had so depreciated in value that a paper dollar was\r\nnot worth more than a penny, and by-and-by it had absolutely no value at\r\nall. The farce of such a currency caused many grim jests among the\r\nConfederates themselves. Thus an officer gave his colored servant five\r\nthousand dollars to curry his horse, and another officer exchanged six\r\nmonths of his own pay for a paper dollar. In truth, the Southerners were\r\nfighting without pay, while their clothing and food were of the poorest\r\ncharacter. All the men being in some branch of the service, the women\r\nhad to look after the homes that were running to waste. The conscription\r\nact was made so rigid that the drag-net gathered in the large boys and\r\nmen past middle life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPERITY OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nIt was far different in the North. The enormous demands of the\r\ngovernment for war supplies gave the country an unnatural prosperity.\r\nAlthough prices were high, there was an abundance of money, which, while\r\ndepreciating to some extent, never did so to a degree to cause distress.\r\nThe resources were almost limitless, and the conviction was so general\r\nthat the war was near its conclusion, that the greenback currency and\r\nthe national bonds began to rise in value. The real dissatisfaction was\r\nin the continual demand for more soldiers. In the course of the year\r\nfully 1,200,000 men had been summoned to the ranks. Several drafts took\r\nplace, and bounties were paid, which in many instances were at the rate\r\nof a thousand dollars to a man. A good many people began to declare this\r\ndemand exorbitant, and that, if the real necessity existed, the Union\r\nwas not worth such an appalling cost of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR'S DESOLATION.\r\n\r\nBehind all this seeming prosperity were thousands of mourning households\r\nand desolate hearthstones in the North as well as the South. Fathers,\r\nbrothers, and sons had fallen, and would nevermore return to their loved\r\nones. The shadow was everywhere. Sorrow, broken-hearts, and lamentation\r\nwere in the land, for war, the greatest curse of mankind, spares neither\r\nparent, child, nor babe. The exchange of prisoners, carried on almost\r\nfrom the very opening of the war, ceased, because the Confederate\r\nauthorities refused to exchange negro soldiers. As a consequence,\r\nmultitudes of Union prisoners suffered indescribable misery in many of\r\nthe Southern prisons. This was especially the case in Andersonville,\r\nGeorgia, where a brute named Wirz, a Swiss, showed a fiendish delight in\r\nadding to the tortures of those committed to his care. This miscreant\r\nwas afterward tried for his atrocities, found guilty, and hanged. He was\r\nthe only man executed for the part he took in the war. There was less\r\nsuffering in other places. The straits to which the Confederates\r\nthemselves were driven made it impossible in some instances to give the\r\ncare they would have given to their prisoners. In the early part of\r\n1864, more than a hundred Unionists confined in Libby Prison, Richmond,\r\nescaped by tunneling, but most of them were recaptured and returned to\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nNevada was admitted to the Union in 1864. It formed part of the Mexican\r\ncession of 1848, prior to which time no settlement had been made in the\r\nState. In that year the Mormons settled in Carson and Washoe Valleys. In\r\n1859, silver was found to exist in vast quantities, and, in 1866, the\r\narea of the State was increased by additions from Arizona and Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATE RAIDERS FROM CANADA.\r\n\r\nOne of the most irritating annoyances resulted from the presence of\r\nConfederates in Canada, who continually plotted mischief against the\r\nNorth. In October, 1864, a band of them rode into St. Albans, Vermont,\r\nwhich is only fifteen miles from the border, robbed the bank of a large\r\namount of money, burned a hotel, fired into a crowd of citizens,\r\ncommitted other outrages, and galloped back to Canada, where thirteen\r\nwere arrested and thrown into prison. The legal proceedings which\r\nfollowed resulted in the discharge of the prisoners on technical\r\ngrounds. General Dix, in command of the Eastern Department, issued\r\norders that in the future all such marauders were to be pursued and\r\nshot down or arrested, no matter where they took refuge. Had these\r\nmeasures been carried out, there would have been war with England, which\r\nwould never permit such invasion of her territory. General Dix's action\r\nwas disavowed by our government, while the Canadian authorities took\r\ncare to prevent any more similar outrages.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that General Grant planned a forward movement of the\r\nUnion forces early in May of this year, with the purpose of keeping the\r\nConfederate armies so incessantly engaged that they would have no\r\nopportunity of reinforcing one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE NORTH END OF ANDERSONVILLE PRISON.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph._)\r\n\r\nIn the middle-ground midway of the swamp is the \"Island\" which was\r\ncovered with shelters after the higher ground had all been occupied.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SHERMAN'S ADVANCE TO ATLANTA.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman, the faithful lieutenant of Grant, was in command of the\r\nthree armies, respectively, of the Cumberland, of Tennessee, and of\r\nOhio, led by Generals Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield. General Jo\r\nJohnston was Sherman's opponent, his commanders being Hardee, Hood, and\r\nPolk. The troops were less numerous than the Federals, but they were the\r\nfinest of soldiers and were led by skillful officers.\r\n\r\nSherman made his preparations with care and thoroughness. Chattanooga\r\nwas his starting-point on his march through the South, and by the 1st of\r\nMay he had 254 guns, 100,000 men, and an immense amount of supplies at\r\nthat town. He began his famous march on the 7th of May. Johnston, who\r\nsaw his purpose, confronted him at Dalton, where an attack by Unionists\r\nwas repulsed; but Sherman resorted to flanking tactics, and Johnston\r\nfell back, crossing the river, May 15th, and taking a new position at\r\nEtowah, forty miles to the south of Resaca.\r\n\r\nThe great risk assumed by Sherman will be understood. It was necessary\r\nto preserve his communications, for he had but a single railroad line\r\nbehind him. To do this, he had to leave strong detachments at different\r\npoints, thereby weakening his army as he advanced into Confederate\r\nterritory. Johnston, being among friends, was not obliged to do anything\r\nof that nature. He could preserve his forces intact and add slightly to\r\nthem. By-and-by, the armies would be nearly equal in numbers, when\r\nJohnston proposed to give battle to the invaders.\r\n\r\nThe Union army marched in three columns, their flanks guarded by\r\ncavalry, and the columns always within supporting distance of one\r\nanother. The steady advance and retreat went on with occasional brisk\r\nfighting. On the 14th of June, during an exchange of shots, the head of\r\nGeneral Leonidas Polk was carried away by a cannon ball. Now and then\r\nJohnston attacked Sherman, but invariably without gaining any important\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAt last Sherman grew tired of continually flanking his enemy, and made\r\nthe mistake of assaulting him. This was at Kenesaw Mountain on the 27th\r\nof June. The attack was made with great gallantry, but the Unionists\r\nwere repulsed with the loss of 3,000 men.\r\n\r\nSherman returned to his flanking tactics, which were conducted with so\r\nmuch skill that finally Johnston was forced into the defenses of\r\nAtlanta. It was there he meant to make a stand and deliver battle on\r\nsomething approaching equal terms. His generals were dissatisfied with\r\nhis continual falling back and protested. That Johnston was sagacious in\r\nwhat he did cannot be questioned; but his old enemy, President Davis,\r\ntook advantage of the opportunity to remove him and place General Hood\r\nin chief command.\r\n\r\nHood had not half the ability of Johnston, but he believed in fighting.\r\nHe assumed Johnston's place on the 17th of July. The news was pleasant\r\nto Sherman, for he rated Hood at his true value as compared with\r\nJohnston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHERMAN'S THREE SCOUTS\r\n\r\n\"Setting out at night they paddled continuously down the river until\r\ndaylight, when they ran the boat among the reeds and remained in hiding\r\nuntil night came again.\"]\r\n\r\nIt had been a long and difficult march from Chattanooga to Atlanta, and\r\nyet it may be said that Sherman had only reached his true\r\nstarting-point. He gave his soldiers a needed rest, and waited for\r\nreinforcements. Those expected from Corinth, Mississippi, were routed by\r\nGeneral Forrest, but the needed men were obtained from other quarters,\r\nand the three columns converged upon Atlanta, July 20th. The defenses\r\nextended for three miles about the city, but were not quite completed.\r\nMcPherson secured possession of a hill that gave him a view of the city,\r\nobserving which Hood made a furious assault upon him on the night of the\r\n22d. He came perilously near success, but, by hastening reinforcements\r\nto the threatened point, Sherman was able to repel the attack. In the\r\nfighting General McPherson, one of the best of the Union generals, was\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF GENERAL POLK.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of Sherman was to shut off Atlanta from the rest of the world.\r\nBy thus excluding its supplies, it would be starved into submission, as\r\nwas the case at Vicksburg. Accordingly, he began a series of works,\r\nintended to be extended gradually around the city. This was difficult\r\nand dangerous, as was proven when two columns of Union cavalry, failing\r\nto effect a junction, through some misunderstanding, were separately\r\nattacked and routed. Among the many prisoners taken was General\r\nStoneman, and the cavalry arm of the service was greatly weakened.\r\n\r\nThe impetuous Hood made a furious onslaught upon the Union army July\r\n28th, renewing it several times, but was defeated with heavy loss in\r\neach instance. Sherman, through the failure of one of his generals to\r\nreach his assigned position in time, narrowly missed bagging Hood and\r\nhis whole army.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL OF ATLANTA.\r\n\r\nBut Sherman displayed masterly generalship by so manoeuvring as to\r\ndraw Hood away from the defenses and by thrusting his army between the\r\ncorps of Hardee and Atlanta. The only escape now for the Confederates\r\nwas to abandon the city, which was done on the 1st of September, many of\r\nthe citizens going with the retiring army. At nine o'clock the next\r\nmorning General Slocum, at the head of a strong reconnoitering column,\r\nrode into Atlanta, and the mayor made a formal surrender of the place.\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Atlanta caused great rejoicing in the North, and\r\ncorresponding depression in the South. President Davis hurried to the\r\nneighborhood to investigate for himself. He found matters so bad that\r\nthey could not be much worse. Hood, however, was as combative as ever,\r\nand proposed to attack Sherman's lines of communication. It was a\r\ndangerous proceeding, but Davis consented. On his way back to Richmond\r\nhe stopped at Macon and made a speech, in which he announced the plans\r\nof Hood. This speech was published in the Southern papers, reached the\r\nNorth, where it was republished, and in due time these papers went to\r\nSherman, It can well be understood that Davis' speech proved \"mighty\r\ninteresting\" reading to the Union commander.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF HOOD'S PLAN FOR THE RELIEF OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nHood's plan was simple. He proposed to march into Tennessee, and, by\r\nthreatening Sherman's communications, compel him to withdraw from\r\nGeorgia. But Sherman was not to be caught thus easily. He followed Hood\r\nto the north of the Chattahoochee, and, then letting him go whither he\r\nchose, turned back to Atlanta. Hood kept right on through northern\r\nAlabama, and advanced against Nashville. General Thomas had been sent\r\nby Sherman from Atlanta, with the Army of the Cumberland, to look after\r\nHood. General Schofield, in command in the southern part of the State,\r\nfell back to Franklin, eighteen miles south of Nashville, where he was\r\nattacked November 30th by Hood. It was a savage battle, but the\r\nConfederates were held in check until night, when Schofield retreated\r\nacross the river, and took refuge in Nashville. There General Thomas\r\ngathered all his troops, and threw up a line of intrenchments to the\r\nsouth of the city. Hood appeared in front of them December 2d, and began\r\nbuilding works and counter batteries. He was certain of capturing the\r\nplace and its defenders by regular siege operations. Never did the\r\ngenius of Thomas shine more brilliantly than at the siege of Nashville.\r\nHe industriously gathered reinforcements, perfected his defenses, and\r\nrefused to move until fully prepared. The whole country became\r\nimpatient; even General Grant sent him urgent messages, and at one time\r\nissued an order for his removal. But Thomas could not be shaken from his\r\npurpose. Not until December 15th did he feel himself ready to strike,\r\nand then he did it with the might of a descending avalanche. He sallied\r\nforth, captured several redoubts, and drove back the Confederates for a\r\nnumber of miles. He renewed the battle on the 16th, and utterly routed\r\nHood's army. The panic-stricken troops fled in confusion, drawing\r\nForrest and his cavalry into the disorganized flight, while Thomas\r\nvigorously pursued until the fugitives scrambled over Duck River toward\r\nthe Tennessee, which was crossed on the 27th of December.\r\n\r\nHood's army was virtually destroyed. He lost more than 13,000 prisoners,\r\nincluding several general officers, and many guns, while more than 2,000\r\ndeserters joined Thomas. The disgusted Hood asked to be relieved of his\r\ncommand, and Dick Taylor, who had defeated Banks some months before in\r\nTexas, assumed his place, but he really was left with no army to\r\ncommand. The proud host which had promised so much existed no longer.\r\nThe Rock of Chickamauga had fallen upon it and ground it to powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S MARCH FROM ATLANTA TO THE SEA.\r\n\r\nSherman proved his confidence in Thomas by not waiting for him to\r\ncomplete his wonderful task, before beginning his march from Atlanta to\r\nthe sea, 300 miles distant. Since it was impossible to maintain the long\r\nand increasing slender line of communications behind him, Sherman made\r\nno effort to do so. He \"cut loose\" entirely, proposing to live off the\r\ngranary of the South, through which his 60,000 veterans began their\r\nfamous tramp. Weeks passed, during which the national government heard\r\nnot a word from Sherman, except such as filtered through the Confederate\r\nlines, and which was always tinctured by the hopes of the enemy. There\r\nwere continual rumors of the Union army meeting \"a lion in its path,\"\r\nand of its being overwhelmed by disaster, but nothing of a positive\r\nnature was learned, and naturally there was considerable uneasiness,\r\nthough Grant knew Sherman too well to feel any distrust of his success.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his march, Sherman aimed to deceive the enemy as to\r\nhis real destination. The secret was shared only with his corps\r\ncommanders and General Kilpatrick, leader of the cavalry. The advance\r\nwas in two columns, the right under General Howard and the left under\r\nGeneral Slocum. Atlanta was burned on the night of November 15th, and\r\nSherman himself rode out from the city the next day with the left wing.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the Confederates to present any serious opposition\r\nto the invaders. Frantic appeals were issued to the South to rise and\r\ncrush the enemy, but they accomplished nothing. The bands of militia\r\nwere brushed aside like so many children, and the march \"From Atlanta to\r\nthe Sea\" was simply a huge picnic for Sherman and his army. The opening\r\nof the Mississippi had sliced off the left limb of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, and Sherman was now boring his way through the heart.\r\n\r\nMilledgeville, the capital of the State, was reached on the 21st, but\r\nbefore the Federals arrived the Legislature adjourned precipitately and\r\ntook to its heels. Governor Brown and most of the members ran to\r\nAugusta, which was surrendered two days later, plundered, and partly\r\nburned. Kilpatrick made a demonstration against Macon, and could easily\r\nhave captured it, but his movement was intended only as a feint. Rightly\r\nsurmising by this time that the seacoast was Sherman's destination,\r\nGeneral Hardee did all he could to obstruct the roads leading thither,\r\nbut he was powerless to check the invaders. Thousands of negroes\r\nfollowed the army, singing the \"Day of Jubilee has Come,\" but many of\r\nthe poor people perished amid the dismal wastes and barrens of Eastern\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nFinally Sherman passed down the peninsula formed by the Ogeechee and\r\nSavannah Rivers and approached Savannah. The enemy were easily driven\r\nfrom their field-works, and by December 10th all the Confederates were\r\nforced into their lines and the whole Union army was in front of\r\nSavannah. The 300 miles had been passed in twenty-five days and the\r\nlistening ears could now hear the faint boom of the distant Atlantic\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\nBut Hardee was in Savannah with 15,000 men, capable of offering a strong\r\ndefense. To meet his heavy cannon, Sherman had only field artillery,\r\nand, instead of making a direct attack, which would have involved\r\nconsiderable loss of life, he decided to starve the garrison to terms.\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren was lying off the coast, but the mouth of the river was\r\ncommanded by Fort McAllister, and it was dangerous work to attempt to\r\ncommunicate with the Union fleet. Sherman sent off three scouts, who\r\npaddled cautiously down the river at night, hiding in the rice-fields by\r\nday, until they finally succeeded in attracting the notice of a gunboat\r\nwhich ran in and picked them up. The glorious news was carried to\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren, who immediately dispatched it North, where, as may be\r\nsupposed, it caused unbounded rejoicing.\r\n\r\nFort McAllister, fifteen miles below the city, was such an obstacle to\r\nthe co-operation of the fleet that Sherman determined to capture it. It\r\nwas taken with a rush on the 13th of December, and the way opened for a\r\nsupply of ammunition and heavy guns from Hilton Head. General Forster,\r\nthe Union commander of that department, was ordered to occupy the\r\nrailroad connecting Savannah and Charleston. When that should be done,\r\nSavannah would be completely invested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN'S UNIQUE CHRISTMAS GIFT.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, Sherman demanded the surrender of the city. Hardee refused\r\nand Sherman prepared to bombard it. But the Confederates, who still had\r\ncontrol of Savannah River, retreated across that stream on the night of\r\nthe 20th, and tramped into South Carolina. Sherman entered the city the\r\nnext day and wrote at once to President Lincoln \"I beg to present you,\r\nas a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with 150 heavy guns and\r\nplenty of ammunition; also about 25,000 bales of cotton.\" It was a\r\nunique Christmas gift indeed, and President Lincoln sent back the thanks\r\nof the government and nation to the Union commander, his officers and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n(1820-1891.)]\r\n\r\nOne pleasing feature of Sherman's entrance into Savannah was the\r\nwidespread Union sentiment which manifested itself among the citizens.\r\nThey were tired of the war and glad to see this evidence that its close\r\nwas near. They did not destroy their cotton or property, but were quite\r\nwilling to turn it over to their conquerors. General Geary was appointed\r\ncommandant and ruled with tact and kindness. Here we will leave Sherman\r\nfor a time, and give our attention to the single remaining, but most\r\nimportant, campaign of all--that of General Grant against Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT'S ADVANCE AGAINST LEE.\r\n\r\nWhen the Army of the Potomac was ready to move against Lee and Richmond,\r\nit consisted of three instead of five corps. Hancock commanded the\r\nSecond, Warren the Fifth, and Sedgwick the Sixth. Beside this, the Ninth\r\nCorps, which included many colored troops, was under command of\r\nBurnside, and was left for a time to guard the communications with\r\nWashington. This force numbered 140,000 men, and, as has been stated,\r\nwas the largest number ever assembled by the Unionists.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this stupendous host, 42,000 troops were in and about\r\nWashington, 31,000 in West Virginia, and 59,000 in the department of\r\nVirginia and North Carolina. In South Carolina, Georgia, and at other\r\npoints were 38,000. General Lee had less than 58,000 under his immediate\r\ncommand, and the whole number of Confederates in the region threatened\r\nby Grant's 310,000 was about 125,000.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade retained command of the Army of the Potomac, and the\r\ncavalry corps was under General Philip H. Sheridan. Best of all, the\r\nveterans were now inspired by a feeling of confidence to which they had\r\nlong been strangers. They felt that they had a commander at last who was\r\ncompetent to lead them to victory.\r\n\r\nLee was acting on the defensive and held a powerful position. Longstreet\r\nwas at Gordonsville, Ewell on the Rapidan, and A.P. Hill at Orange\r\nCourt-House. The Rapidan itself was held by small bodies of troops,\r\nwhose duty it was to keep watch of the movements of the Union army.\r\n\r\nGrant's plan was to advance directly to Richmond. He intended to cross\r\nthe Rapidan, attack Lee's right, cut his communications, and compel him\r\nto fight. At the same time Butler was to ascend the James from Fort\r\nMonroe, seize City Point, and, advancing along the south bank of the\r\nriver, cut the Confederate communications south of the James, and, if\r\npossible, capture Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIf Grant succeeded in defeating Lee, he intended to follow him to\r\nRichmond. If he failed, he meant to transfer his whole army to the\r\nsouthern side of the James, using Butler's column to cover the movement,\r\nand attack from that quarter. At the same time, General Sigel was to\r\norganize his army into two expeditions, one under General Crook in the\r\nKanawha Valley, and the other commanded by himself in the Shenandoah\r\nValley. The object of this campaign was to cut the Central Railroad and\r\nthe Virginia and Tennessee Road. Since the bulk of Lee's supplies were\r\nreceived over these lines, the success of the plan would inflict a\r\nmortal blow upon the Confederate army.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac began moving, May 3d, at midnight. The advance\r\nwas in two columns. The right, including Warren's and Sedgwick's Corps,\r\ncrossed the Rapidan at Germania Ford, and the left, Hancock's Corps,\r\nmade the passage at Ely's Ford, six miles below. On the following night,\r\nthe bivouac was between the Rapidan and Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\nReading Grant's purpose, Lee determined to attack him in the dense,\r\nwooded country known as the Wilderness, where it would be impossible for\r\nthe Union commander to use his artillery. Acting promptly, a furious\r\nassault was made and the Confederates attained considerable success. The\r\nground was unfavorable for the Unionists, but Grant did not shrink. His\r\nline was five miles long and mostly within the woods, where he could use\r\nneither cavalry nor artillery with effect; but he made his attack with\r\nsuch vehemence that after several hours of terrific fighting he drove\r\nthe flying Confederates back almost to the headquarters of Lee, where\r\nLongstreet saved the army from overthrow and re-established the line.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDING OF GENERAL LONGSTREET.\r\n\r\nBefore noon the next day, Longstreet forced Hancock's left to the Brock\r\nRoad and determined to seize the latter. Had he done so, another\r\ndisastrous defeat would have been added to those suffered by the Army of\r\nthe Potomac at the hands of Lee. Longstreet was in high spirits and\r\ndetermined to lead the movement in person. While riding forward, he met\r\nGeneral Jenkins, who was also exultant over what seemed certain success.\r\nThe two stopped to shake hands, and when doing so, they and their\r\nescorts were mistaken by a body of Confederate troops for Union cavalry\r\nand fired upon. Longstreet waved his hand and shouted to the men to stop\r\nfiring. They did so, but Jenkins had already been killed and Longstreet\r\nhimself was shot in the throat. He fell from his saddle and lay beside\r\nthe body of Jenkins. He was believed to be dead, but, showing signs of\r\nlife, was placed on a litter and carried to the rear, the soldiers\r\ncheering as he was borne past. The reader will recall the strange\r\nwounding of Stonewall Jackson, under almost similar circumstances, by\r\nhis own men. Longstreet recovered in time to take a leading part in the\r\nclosing incidents of the war.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence caused a feeling akin to dismay in the Confederate\r\nranks, and defeated the movement that was about to be undertaken.\r\nGeneral Lee was so disturbed that he placed himself at the head of a\r\nTexas brigade, with the resolve to lead it in a charge that should be\r\ndecisive, but his men would not permit, and compelled him to resume his\r\nplace at the rear.\r\n\r\nGrant's position was too strong to be carried and Lee was equally\r\nsecure. Meanwhile Grant carefully hunted for a weak spot in his enemy's\r\nline, and decided that Spottsylvania Court-House was the place, and\r\nthither he marched his army on the night of May 7th.\r\n\r\nWhile this movement was in progress, Sheridan and his cavalry made a\r\ndash toward Richmond in the effort to cut Lee's communications. The\r\nvigilant Stuart intercepted them at Yellow Tavern, within seven miles of\r\nthe city, and compelled Sheridan to return, but in the fighting Stuart\r\nreceived a wound from which he died the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen Grant's advance reached Spottsylvania Court-House, the Confederates\r\nwere in possession, and repulsed the attempt to drive them out. While\r\nthe preparations for renewing the battle were going on, General Sedgwick\r\nwas struck in the head by a Confederate sharpshooter and instantly\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT'S REPULSE AT COLD HARBOR.\r\n\r\nA series of flank movements followed, with fierce fighting, in which the\r\nUnion loss was great. Reinforcements were sent to Grant, and nothing\r\ncould deter his resolution to drive Lee to the wall. At Cold Harbor, on\r\nJune 3d, however, the Union commander received one of the most bloody\r\nrepulses of the war, suffering a loss of ten thousand in the space of\r\nless than half an hour, and his losses from the Rapidan to the\r\nChickahominy--whither he moved his army--equaled the whole number of men\r\nin Lee's army. The latter was within the defenses of Richmond, of which\r\nthe centre was Cold Harbor. Having much shorter lines, the Confederates\r\nwere able to anticipate the movements of the Army of the Potomac and\r\npresent a defiant front at all times.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile matters had gone wrong in the Shenandoah Valley. On the 15th\r\nof May, Sigel was utterly routed by Breckinridge. The Union officer\r\nfailed so badly that he was superseded by Hunter, who made just as\r\nwretched a failure. The 15,000 troops under Breckinridge were sent to\r\nreinforce Lee, when, had Sigel and Hunter done their duty, this force\r\nwould have been compelled to stay in the Shenandoah Valley.\r\n\r\nAnother movement that was meant to help Grant materially was that of\r\nButler, who was to threaten Richmond by water, while Grant and Meade\r\nwere assailing the city in front. But Butler was outgeneraled by\r\nBeauregard, who succeeded in \"bottling him up,\" as Grant expressed it,\r\nat Bermuda Hundred, a peninsula formed by the James, twenty miles below\r\nRichmond. There Butler was held helpless, while Beauregard sent a small\r\npart of his meagre force to reinforce Lee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL LEE DASHES TO THE FRONT TO LEAD THE TEXANS'\r\nCHARGE.]\r\n\r\nThe terrible repulse which Grant received at Cold Harbor convinced him\r\nthat it was only throwing away life to persist in the campaign against\r\nRichmond by the \"overland\" route. With characteristic decision, he\r\ndecided to move his army to the front of Petersburg and thus shut off\r\nLee's communication with the South. Holding his position in front of the\r\nConfederate leader until June 12th, Grant crossed the Chickahominy and\r\nadvanced to City Point. Passing the James on pontoon-bridges, he marched\r\ntoward Petersburg, where the army arrived on the 15th. The next day the\r\nArmy of the Potomac was south of the James. Petersburg was immediately\r\nattacked, but the defenders repelled every assault. The next day, Lee's\r\nwhole army entered the breastworks of the town. After repeated attacks\r\nby the Unionists, Grant saw the impossibility of capturing Petersburg\r\nby direct attack and he began its siege. Several times the Confederates\r\nmade sallies against threatening movements and drove the Federals from\r\nthe positions that had been gained at no little loss of life.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, Grant consented to allow Lieutenant-Colonel Pleasant, of\r\na Pennsylvania regiment belonging to Burnside's corps, to run a mine\r\nunder one of the approaches to the enemy's intrenchments before\r\nPetersburg. It was believed, apparently with reason, that the explosion\r\nwould open a gap in the line through which the Federals might make a\r\ndash and capture the town before the defenders could rally from their\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe mine was laid and four tons of powder were fired at daylight on the\r\nmorning of July 30th. A cavity was opened by the stupendous explosion,\r\n200 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 30 feet deep. Instantly, the Union\r\nbatteries opened on those of the enemy, silenced them, and the\r\nassaulting column charged. The dreadful mistake was made by the men of\r\nhalting in the cavity for shelter. The troops sent to their help also\r\nstopped and huddled together, seeing which the terrified gunners ran\r\nback to their abandoned pieces and opened upon the disorganized mass in\r\nthe pit. The slaughter continued until the Confederate officers sickened\r\nat the sight and ordered it stopped. The horrible business resulted in\r\nthe loss of nearly 1,000 prisoners and 3,000 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL EARLY'S RAIDS.\r\n\r\nSince the entire Army of the Potomac was in front of Petersburg, the\r\nConfederates took advantage of the opportunity to give Washington\r\nanother scare, in the hope, also, of compelling Grant to withdraw a\r\nconsiderable body of troops from before Richmond. General Early was sent\r\nthither with 8,000 men by General Lee, with orders to attack the\r\nFederals in the valley. Sigel, whose great forte was that of retreating,\r\nfell back before the advance of Early, crossed the Potomac, and took\r\nposition on Maryland Heights. Early moved up the Monocacy into Maryland,\r\ncausing great alarm in Washington. The President called upon\r\nPennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts for militia with which to\r\nrepel the invasion. They were placed under the command of General Lew\r\nWallace, who was defeated at Monocacy Junction, July 9th. Early attacked\r\nRockville, fourteen miles west of Washington, and Colonel Harry Gilmor,\r\nhimself a citizen of Baltimore, cut the communications between that city\r\nand Philadelphia. He captured a railway train, and among his prisoners\r\nwas General Franklin, who was wounded and on his way north. The loose\r\nwatch kept over the captives allowed them to escape.\r\n\r\nEarly was in high feather over his success, and his cavalry appeared in\r\nfront of Washington, July 11th, and exchanged shots with Fort Stevens;\r\nbut a spirited attack drove them off, and they crossed the Potomac at\r\nEdward's Ferry, and passed to the western side of the Shenandoah. Early\r\nmade his headquarters at Winchester and repelled several assaults upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate leader had been so successful that he soon made a second\r\nraid. He crossed the Potomac, July 29th, and, entering Pennsylvania,\r\nreached Chambersburg, from which a ransom of $200,000 in gold was\r\ndemanded. It not being forthcoming, the city was fired, and the\r\ninvaders, after some hard fighting, succeeded in getting back to the\r\nsouthern shore of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThese raids were so exasperating that Grant, who could not give them his\r\npersonal attention, determined to put an effectual stop to them. The\r\ngovernment united the departments of western Virginia, Washington, and\r\nthe Susquehanna, and placed them under the charge of General Sheridan,\r\nwho had 40,000 men at his disposal. Sheridan, whose force was three\r\ntimes as numerous as Early's, was anxious to move against him, and Grant\r\nfinally gave his consent on the condition that he would desolate the\r\nShenandoah Valley to that extent that nothing would be left to invite\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PHILIP H. SHERIDAN.]\r\n\r\nIn the first encounter between Sheridan and Early near the Opequan, a\r\nsmall tributary of the Potomac, west of the Shenandoah, Early was routed\r\nand sent flying toward Winchester, with the loss of many prisoners and\r\nsupplies. He was driven through the town, and his troops intrenched\r\nthemselves on Fisher's Hill, near Strasburg. They were again attacked,\r\non the 21st of September, and compelled to retreat further up the\r\nvalley. Early received a reinforcement, and secured himself at Brown's\r\nGap, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where for the first time he was really\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nThis left Sheridan free to carry out the orders of Grant to devastate\r\nthe valley, and he made thorough work of it. Nothing was spared, and the\r\nburning and destruction were so complete that his homely remark seemed\r\njustified when he said that no crow would dare attempt to fly across\r\nthe region without taking his rations with him.\r\n\r\nFeeling that the situation was secure, Sheridan now went to Washington\r\nto consult with the government. On the 19th of October the Union camp at\r\nCedar Creek was surprised and routed by Early, who captured eighteen\r\nguns, which were turned on the fugitives as they fled in the direction\r\nof Middletown. Their commander, General Wright, finally succeeded in\r\nrallying them, mainly because the Confederates were so overcome at sight\r\nof the food in the abandoned camps that they gave up the pursuit to\r\nfeast and gorge themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SHERIDAN'S RIDE.\"\r\n\r\nSheridan had reached Winchester, \"twenty miles away,\" on his return from\r\nWashington, when the faint sounds of firing told him of the battle in\r\nprogress. Leaping into his saddle, he spurred at headlong speed down the\r\nhighway, rallied the panic-stricken troops, placed himself at their\r\nhead, and, charging headlong into the rebel mob at Cedar Creek,\r\nscattered them like so much chaff, retook the camps, and routed Early so\r\nutterly that no more raids were attempted by him or any other\r\nConfederates during the remainder of the war. Indeed, it may be said\r\nthat this disgraceful overthrow ended the military career of Jubal\r\nEarly. When some months later General Lee was placed at the head of all\r\nthe military affairs of the Confederacy, he lost no time in doing two\r\nthings: the first was to restore General Jo Johnston to his old command,\r\nand the second to remove Early from his.\r\n\r\nThe stirring incident described furnished the theme for the well-known\r\npoem of T. Buchanan Read, entitled \"Sheridan's Ride.\"\r\n\r\nGrant held fast to that which he won by terrific fighting. Petersburg\r\nlies about twenty miles to the south of Richmond, and the strongly\r\nfortified Union lines were nearly thirty miles in length, extending from\r\na point close to the Weldon Railroad, on Grant's left, across the James\r\nto the neighborhood of Newmarket, on the right. Holding the inner part\r\nof this circle, Lee was able for a long time to repel every assault.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate commander fought furiously to prevent his enemy from\r\nobtaining possession of the Weldon Road, but late in August a lodgment\r\nwas effected from which the Federals could not be driven. Other\r\nadvantages were gained, but the close of the year saw Lee still\r\nunconquered and defiant.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT'S SLOW BUT RESISTLESS PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, 1865, Grant attempted to turn the Confederate right,\r\nbut was repulsed, though he gained several miles of additional\r\nterritory. Sheridan soon after destroyed the Richmond and Lynchburg\r\nRailroad and the locks of the James River Canal, after which he joined\r\nthe Army of the James.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURRENDER OF GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL GRANT, AT APPOMATTOX\r\nCOURT-HOUSE, APRIL 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"The two generals met at the house of Major McLean, in the hamlet of\r\nAppomattox Courthouse, where Lee surrendered all that remained of the\r\nConfederate Army, which for nearly four years had beaten back every\r\nattempt to capture Richmond. Grant's terms, as usual, were generous. He\r\ndid not ask for Lee's sword, and demanded only that he and his men\r\nshould agree not again to bear arms against the Government of the United\r\nStates.\"]\r\n\r\nBut Lee was beginning to feel the tremendous and continued pressure. His\r\narmy numbered barely 35,000 men. A.P. Hill commanded the right wing,\r\nstretching from Petersburg to Hatcher's Run; General J.B. Gordon, the\r\ncentre, at Petersburg; and Longstreet, who had recovered from his wound,\r\nthe left wing, north and south of the James; while the cavalry did what\r\nit could to cover the flanks. This attenuated line was forty miles long.\r\nRealizing the desperate straits, the Confederate authorities early in\r\n1865 placed the entire military operations of the Confederacy in the\r\nhands of Lee.\r\n\r\nThe latter planned to fall back toward Danville and unite with Johnston.\r\nIf successful this would have given him a formidable army; but Grant did\r\nnot intend to permit such a junction. Fighting went on almost\r\ncontinually, the gain being with the Union army, because of its greatly\r\nsuperior numbers and the skill with which they were handled by the\r\nmaster, Grant. April 1st a cannonade opened along the whole Union line.\r\nLee's right wing had been destroyed, but the others were unbroken. At\r\ndaylight the next morning an advance was made against the Confederate\r\nworks. Lee was forced back, and he strengthened his lines by making them\r\nmuch shorter.\r\n\r\nThe Confederates steadily lost ground, many were killed and taken\r\nprisoners, and in a charge upon the Union left General A.P. Hill lost\r\nhis life. At last the enemy's outer lines were hopelessly broken, and\r\nLee telegraphed the startling fact to President Davis, who received it\r\nwhile sitting in church, Sunday, April 2d. The Confederate President was\r\ntold that Lee could hold Petersburg but a few hours longer, and Davis\r\nwas warned to have the authorities ready to leave Richmond unless a\r\nmessage was sent to the contrary. No such longed-for message arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVACUATION OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nThe counsel of Lee was followed. Jefferson Davis, the members of his\r\ncabinet, and a number of leading citizens left the capital that night\r\nfor Charlotte, North Carolina. The whole city was thrown into the\r\nwildest confusion; rioting and drunkenness filled the streets, buildings\r\nwere fired, and pandemonium reigned. General Witzel, who occupied the\r\nUnion works to the north of Richmond, learned the astounding news, and\r\nthe next morning rode into the city without opposition. The tidings were\r\ntelegraphed to Washington. The following day President Lincoln arrived,\r\nand was quartered in the house formerly occupied by Jefferson Davis.\r\nMartial law was proclaimed, and order restored in the stricken city.\r\n\r\nBut General Lee had not yet surrendered. No men ever fought more\r\nheroically than he and his soldiers. On the Sunday that he sent his\r\nmessage to President Davis, the commander found the only line of retreat\r\nleft to him was that which led to the westward, and even that was\r\nthreatened. Anticipating Lee's retreat, Grant used all possible energy\r\nto cut him off. On the night of April 6th Lee crossed the Appomattox\r\nnear Farmville. That night his general officers held a consultation, and\r\nagreed that but one course was left to them and that was to surrender.\r\nTheir views were communicated to Lee, but he would not yet consent to\r\nthat decisive step.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINCOLN ENTERING RICHMOND.]\r\n\r\nGrant was in Farmville on the 7th, and he sent a letter to Lee,\r\nreminding him of the uselessness of further resistance and asking for\r\nhis surrender. Lee still declined, and continued his retreat. Then\r\nSheridan threw his powerful division of cavalry in front of the\r\nConfederates, and Lee decided to cut his way through the ring of\r\nbayonets and sabres by which he was environed. This desperate task was\r\nassigned to the indomitable Gordon. He made a resistless beginning, when\r\nhe saw the impossibility of success. The news was sent to Lee, who\r\nrealized at last that all hope was gone. He forwarded a note to Grant,\r\nasking for a suspension of hostilities with a view to surrender. The two\r\ngenerals met at the house of Major McLean, in the hamlet of Appomattox\r\nCourt-House, on the 9th of April, where Lee surrendered all that\r\nremained of the Confederate army, which for nearly four years had beaten\r\nback every attempt to capture Richmond.\r\n\r\nGrant's terms as usual were generous. He did not ask for Lee's sword,\r\nand demanded only that he and his men should agree not to bear arms\r\nagain against the government of the United States. They were to\r\nsurrender all public property, but Grant told them to keep their horses,\r\n\"as you will need them for your spring ploughing.\" The soldiers who had\r\nfought each other so long and so fiercely fraternized like brothers,\r\nexchanged grim jests over the terrible past, and pledged future\r\nfriendship. The reunion between the officers was equally striking. Most\r\nof them were old acquaintances, and all rejoiced that the war was at\r\nlast ended. General Lee rode with his cavalry escort to his home in\r\nRichmond and rejoined his family. He was treated with respect by the\r\nUnion troops, who could not restrain a feeling of sympathy for their\r\nfallen but magnanimous enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThe bonfires in the North had hardly died out and the echoes of the glad\r\nbells were still lingering in the air, when the whole country was\r\nstartled by one of the most horrifying events in all history. President\r\nLincoln, on the night of April 14th, was sitting in a box at Ford's\r\nTheatre in Washington, accompanied by his wife and another lady and\r\ngentleman, when, at a little past ten o'clock, John Wilkes Booth, an\r\nactor, stealthily entered the box from the rear, and, without any one\r\nsuspecting his awful purpose, fired a pistol-bullet into the President's\r\nbrain. The latter's head sank, and he never recovered consciousness.\r\n\r\nBooth, after firing the shot, leaped upon the stage from the box,\r\nbrandished a dagger, shouted _\"Sic semper tyrannis!\"_ and, before the\r\ndumbfounded spectators could comprehend what had been done, dashed out\r\nof a rear door, sprang upon a waiting horse, and galloped off in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nNo pen can describe the horror and rage which seized the spectators when\r\nthey understood what had taken place. The stricken President was carried\r\nacross the street to a house where he died at twenty-two minutes past\r\nseven the next morning.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of his assassination, an attempt was made upon the life\r\nof Secretary Seward, who was confined to his bed, suffering from a fall.\r\nA male attendant prevented the miscreant from killing the secretary,\r\nthough he was badly cut. The best detective force of the country was set\r\nto work, and an energetic pursuit of Booth was made. He had injured his\r\nankle when leaping from the box upon the stage of the theatre, but he\r\nrode into Maryland, accompanied by another conspirator, named David E.\r\nHarrold. At the end of eleven days they were run down by the pursuing\r\ncavalry, who brought them to bay on the 26th of April. They had\r\ncrossed from Maryland into Virginia and taken refuge in a barn near Port\r\nRoyal, on the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CIVIL WAR PEACE CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\nThree commissioners from the Confederacy suggesting terms of peace to\r\nPresident Lincoln and Secretary Seward in Fortress Monroe, January\r\n1865.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF BOOTH.\r\n\r\nThe barn was surrounded and the two men were summoned to surrender.\r\nHarrold went out and gave himself up. Booth refused and defied the\r\ntroopers, offering to fight them single-handed. To drive him from his\r\nhiding-place, the barn was set on fire. Booth, carbine in hand and\r\nleaning on his crutch, approached the door with the intention of\r\nshooting, when Sergeant Boston Corbett fired through a crevice and hit\r\nBooth in the neck. The wound was a mortal one, and Booth was brought out\r\nof the barn and laid on the ground, where he died after several hours of\r\nintense suffering. The body was taken to Washington and secretly buried.\r\nThere is good reason to believe that it was sunk at night in the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENT OF THE CONSPIRATORS.\r\n\r\nThe country was in no mood to show leniency to any one concerned in the\r\ntaking off of the beloved President. Of the five conspirators tried,\r\nfour were hanged. They were: Payne, Harrold, G.A. Atzeroot, and Mrs.\r\nMary A. Surratt, at whose house the conspirators held their meetings.\r\nDr. S.A. Mudd, who dressed Booth's wounded ankle, and was believed to be\r\nin sympathy with the plotters, was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas for a\r\nnumber of years. He showed so much devotion during an outbreak of yellow\r\nfever there that he was pardoned some time later. John Surratt, the\r\nassailant of Secretary Seward, fled to Italy, where he was discovered by\r\nArchbishop Hughes, and the Italian government, as an act of courtesy,\r\ndelivered him to our government. On his first trial the jury disagreed,\r\nand on the second he escaped through the plea of limitations.\r\n\r\nThe whole country mourned the death of President Lincoln. His greatness,\r\nhis goodness, and his broad, tender charity were appreciated by every\r\none. The South knew that they had lost in him their best friend. Had he\r\nlived, much of the strife of the succeeding few years would have been\r\nsaved, and the bitter cup that was pressed to the lips of the conquered\r\nSouth would have been less bitter than it was made by others. The\r\nremains of the martyred President were laid in their final resting-place\r\nat Springfield, Illinois, and the fame of Lincoln grows and increases\r\nwith the passing years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S NORTHWARD ADVANCES.\r\n\r\nThe army of General Jo Johnston did not surrender until after the death\r\nof President Lincoln. Sherman, as will be remembered, made the city of\r\nSavannah a Christmas present to the President. Leaving a strong\r\ndetachment in the city, Sherman moved northward with an army of 70,000\r\nmen, including artillery, the start being made on the 1st of February.\r\nCharleston, where the first ordinance of secession was passed and which\r\nhad successfully defied every movement against it, now found itself\r\nassailed in the rear. The garrison, after destroying the government\r\nstores, the railway stations, blowing up the ironclads in the harbor,\r\nbursting the guns on the ramparts of the forts, and setting the city on\r\nfire, withdrew. This took place February 17th. The next day General\r\nGillmore entered Charleston and his troops extinguished the few\r\nbuildings that were still burning.\r\n\r\nIt has not been forgotten that Wilmington, North Carolina, had become\r\nthe great blockade-running port of the Southern Confederacy. The mouth\r\nof Cape Fear River was defended by Fort Fisher, a very powerful\r\nfortification. General Butler made an attempt to capture it in December,\r\nbut failed. Another effort followed January 15th, under General Alfred\r\nTerry, and was successful. The defeated garrison joined Johnston to help\r\nhim in disputing the northward advance of Sherman.\r\n\r\nThere was severe fighting, especially at Goldsborough, but the Union\r\narmy was so much the superior that its progress could not be stayed.\r\nThere Schofield reinforced Sherman, who, feeling all danger was past,\r\nturned over the command to his subordinate and went north to consult\r\nwith Grant, reaching his headquarters on the 27th of March. Soon after\r\nthe surrender of Lee, the whole Confederacy was in such a state of\r\ncollapse that the Union cavalry galloped back and forth through every\r\nportion at will.\r\n\r\nReturning to his command, Sherman moved against Johnston, April 10th.\r\nFour days later, Johnston admitted in a communication to the Union\r\ncommander that the surrender of Lee meant the end of the war, and he\r\nasked for a temporary suspension of hostilities, with the view of making\r\narrangements for the laying down of the Confederate arms. Sherman\r\nconsented, and these two commanders met and discussed the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF JO JOHNSTON AND COLLAPSE OF THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nIn the exchange of views which followed, the great soldier, Sherman, was\r\noutwitted by Johnston and the Confederate president and cabinet, who\r\nwere behind him. They secured his agreement to a restoration, so far as\r\nhe could bring it about, of the respective State governments in the\r\nSouth as they were before the war, with immunity for the secession\r\nleaders from punishment, and other privileges, which, if granted, would\r\nhave been throwing away most of the fruits of the stupendous struggle.\r\nSherman thus took upon himself the disposition of civil matters with\r\nwhich he had nothing to do. The more sagacious Grant saw the mistake of\r\nhis old friend, and, visiting his camp, April 24th, told him his\r\nmemorandum was disapproved, and notice was to be sent Johnston of the\r\nresumption of hostilities. Two days later, Sherman and Johnston again\r\nmet, and the Confederate commander promptly agreed to surrender his army\r\non the same conditions that were given to Lee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DESPERATE EXTREMITY OF THE CONFEDERATES AT THE END OF\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR.]\r\n\r\nGeneral J.H. Wilson and his cavalry captured Macon, Georgia, April 21st,\r\nand, on the 4th of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered the remainder of\r\nthe Confederate forces east of the Mississippi, at which time also\r\nAdmiral Farrand surrendered to Admiral Thatcher all the naval forces of\r\nthe Confederacy that were blockaded in the Tombigbee River. At that\r\ntime, Kirby Smith was on the other side of the Mississippi, loudly\r\ndeclaring that he would keep up the fight until independence or better\r\nterms were secured, but his followers did not share his views, and\r\ndeserted so fast that he, Magruder, and others made their way to Mexico,\r\nwhere, after remaining awhile, they returned to the United States and\r\nbecame peaceful and law-abiding citizens. The troops left by them\r\npassed under the command of General Brent, who, on the 26th of May,\r\nsurrendered to General Canby, when it may be said the War for the Union\r\nwas ended.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Johnston, Jefferson Davis and the members of his\r\ncabinet became fugitives, under the escort of a few paroled soldiers. It\r\nwas feared they might join Kirby Smith and encourage him to continue his\r\nresistance, while others believed he was striving to get beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe party hurried through the dismal wastes of Georgia, in continual\r\nfear that the Union cavalry would burst from cover upon them and make\r\nall prisoners. In the early morning light of May 10th, Mr. Davis, while\r\nasleep in his tent, near Irwinsville, Wilkinson County, Georgia, was\r\naroused by the alarming news that the camp was surrounded by Union\r\ncavalry. He leaped to his feet and ran for his horse, but the animal was\r\nalready in the possession of a Federal trooper. His wife threw a shawl\r\nover his shoulders, and he attempted to escape from the camp without\r\nbeing recognized, but he was identified and made prisoner. He had been\r\ncaptured by a squad of General J.H. Wilson's cavalry, under the command\r\nof Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard of the Fourth Michigan. His\r\nfellow-prisoners were his wife and children, his private secretary,\r\nBurton Harrison, his aide-de-camp, and Postmaster-General Reagan, all of\r\nwhom were taken to Macon, and thence to Fort Monroe, Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt was a serious problem, now that the president of the defunct\r\nConfederacy was captured, what should be done with him. He was kept in\r\nFort Monroe until his health was impaired, when he was released on bail;\r\nHorace Greeley, the well-known editor of the _New York Tribune_, being\r\none of his bondsmen. He had been indicted for treason in 1866, being\r\nreleased the following year, but his trial was dropped on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, 1869. He passed the remainder of his life in Memphis, and\r\nlater at Beauvoir, Mississippi, dying in New Orleans, December 6, 1889,\r\nin the eighty-second year of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nThe most carefully prepared statistics of the Civil War give the\r\nfollowing facts: Number of men in the Union army furnished by each State\r\nand Territory, from April 15, 1861, to close of war, 2,778,304, which,\r\nreduced to a three years' standing, was 2,326,168. The number of\r\ncasualties in the volunteer and regular armies of the United States,\r\naccording to a statement prepared by the adjutant-general's office, was:\r\nKilled in battle, 67,058; died of wounds, 43,012; died of disease,\r\n199,720; other causes, such as accidents, murder, Confederate prisons,\r\netc., 40,154; total died, 349,944; total deserted, 199,105. Number of\r\nsoldiers in the Confederate service, who died of wounds or disease\r\n(partial statement), 133,821. Deserted (partial statement), 104,428.\r\nNumber of United States troops captured during the war, 212,508;\r\nConfederate troops captured, 476,169. Number of United States troops\r\nparoled on the field, 16,431; Confederate troops paroled on the field,\r\n248,599. Number of United States troops who died while prisoners,\r\n30,156; Confederate troops who died while prisoners, 30,152. It is safe\r\nto say that the number of men killed and disabled on both sides during\r\nthe War for the Union was fully one million. The public debt of the\r\nUnited States, July 1, 1866, was $2,773,236,173.69, which on the 1st of\r\nNovember, 1897, had been reduced to $1,808,777,643.40.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the frightful brutalities of Captain Wirz, the\r\nkeeper of Andersonville prison. He richly merited the hanging which he\r\nsuffered on the 10th of November, 1865. As has been stated, he was the\r\nonly person executed for his part in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nEngland, upon receiving news of the arrest of Jefferson Davis, declared\r\nall ports, harbors, and waters belonging to Great Britain closed against\r\nevery vessel bearing the Confederate flag. The French government took\r\nthe same action a few days later.\r\n\r\nMore than a generation has passed since the close of the great Civil\r\nWar, which resulted in the cementing of the Union so firmly that the\r\nbonds can never again be broken. Whatever resentment may have been felt\r\nlasted but a brief while, and the late war with Spain removed the last\r\nvestige.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n(1811-1872.)]\r\n\r\nA little incident may serve as one of the thousand similar occurrences\r\nwhich prove how perfectly the North and South fraternized long ago. The\r\nofficer who did the most effective work for the Union in the South\r\nduring the closing months of the war was General James H. Wilson, a\r\ndetachment of whose cavalry captured the fugitive Jefferson Davis. It\r\nwas General Wilson, who, on the 21st of April, 1865, rode into Macon,\r\nGeorgia, and took possession of the city. In the month of December,\r\n1898, while on a visit to Macon, he made an address to the citizens,\r\nfrom which the following extract is given:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTY-THREE YEARS LATER.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: It is with infinite pleasure that I address myself in\r\nwords of peace to a Macon audience. [Cheers.] Thirty-odd years ago I\r\ncame into this town with 15,000 cavalry thundering at my heels.\r\n[Laughter and shouts.] I was met with the roaring of cannon and the\r\nfiring of musketry. [Cheers.] I was greeted by the burning of warehouses\r\nand the destruction of property, which I now profoundly regret.\r\n[Cheers.] The welcome that was extended to me then was of the silent\r\nquality. [Laughter.] An illustrious citizen, then your chief magistrate,\r\nthe Hon. Joseph E. Brown, after a four-hours' interview, speaking of me\r\nthen, said to another gathering of illustrious citizens, at the head of\r\nwhich was Howell Cobb: \"He is a clever young man, but, gentlemen, he\r\ntakes the military view of the situation.\" [Laughter.] That was a fact\r\nthen, but now I come among you and I receive a different welcome. I was\r\nthen a victor; to-day I am a captive. [Cheers.] I must say I am a\r\nwilling captive of your city. The fair women and the brave and excellent\r\ngentlemen of your town have, by their open and generous hospitality,\r\nimprisoned me deep down in their hearts, and I would be recreant to\r\nevery feeling of my own if I desired release from such pleasing bondage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINCOLN'S GRAVE, SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF JOHNSON AND GRANT 1865-1877.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson--Reconstruction--Quarrel Between the President and\r\nCongress--The Fenians--Execution of Maximilian--Admission of\r\nNebraska--Laying of the Atlantic Cable--Purchase of Alaska--Impeachment\r\nand Acquittal of the President--Carpet-bag Rule in the South--Presidential\r\nElection of 1868--U.S. Grant--Settlement of the _Alabama_\r\nClaims--Completion of the Overland Railway--The Chicago Fire--Settlement\r\nof the Northwestern Boundary--Presidential Election of 1872--The Modoc\r\nTroubles--Civil War in Louisiana--Admission of Colorado--Panic of\r\n1873--Notable Deaths--Custer's Massacre--The Centennial--The Presidential\r\nElection of 1876 the Most Perilous in the History of the Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nAs provided by the Constitution, Andrew Johnson, Vice-President, took\r\nthe oath of office as President on the day that Abraham Lincoln died. He\r\nwas born in Raleigh, North Carolina, December 29, 1808, and his parents\r\nwere so poor that they did not send him to school at all. When only ten\r\nyears old, he was apprenticed to a tailor, and anyone who at that time\r\nhad prophesied that he would some day become President of the United\r\nStates would have been set down as an idiot or a lunatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(1808-1875.) One partial term, 1865-1869.]\r\n\r\nAmong the visitors to the tailor shop was a kind-hearted old gentleman\r\nwho was in the habit of reading to the boys and men. Andrew became\r\ninterested in what he heard, and, seeing how much better it would be for\r\nhim to be able to read for himself, set to work and learned. He removed\r\nto Greenville, Tennessee, in 1826, and there married a noble woman, who\r\nencouraged his ambition and helped him in his studies. Nature had given\r\nhim marked ability, and he became interested in local politics. The\r\ncitizens had confidence in him, for he was twice elected alderman, twice\r\nmayor, was sent three times to the State Legislature, and in 1843 was\r\nelected to Congress. He remained there for ten years, when he was chosen\r\ngovernor of Tennessee, and, in 1857, became United States senator.\r\n\r\nJohnson had always been a Democrat, and, when the political upheaval\r\ncame in 1860, he supported Breckinridge. While he favored slavery, he\r\nwas a Unionist in every fibre of his being, and declared that every man\r\nwho raised his hand against the flag should be hanged as a traitor.\r\nTennessee was torn by the savage quarrel, and for a time the\r\nsecessionists were rampant. When Johnson returned to his home in May,\r\n1861, his train was stopped by a mob who were determined to lynch him,\r\nbut he met the angered men at the door with a loaded revolver and cowed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was such men as Johnson that President Lincoln appreciated and\r\ndetermined to keep bound to him. He appointed him military governor of\r\nTennessee in 1862, and it need hardly be said that Johnson made things\r\nlively for the secessionists, and did not forget to give attention to\r\nthose who had persecuted him. His personal courage and honesty won the\r\nadmiration of the North, and, as we have shown, led to his being placed\r\non the ticket with President Lincoln, when he was renominated in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not forget that the surrender of Johnson and the\r\ncapture, imprisonment, and release of Jefferson Davis occurred while\r\nJohnson was President.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nReconstruction was the grave problem that confronted the country at the\r\nclose of the war. The question was as to the status of the States lately\r\nin rebellion. It would not do to restore them to their full rights, with\r\nthe same old governments, for they might make better preparations and\r\nsecede again. Nothing was clearer than that slavery was the real cause\r\nof the war, and the safety of the nation demanded that it should be\r\nextirpated forever. The Emancipation Proclamation was a war measure and\r\nsimply freed the slaves, but did not prevent the re-establishment of\r\nslavery. In December, 1865, therefore, the Thirteenth Amendment, having\r\nbeen adopted by three-fourths of the States, was declared a part of the\r\nConstitution. By it slavery was forever abolished, and one of the\r\ngravest of all perils was removed.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson was a man of strong passions and prejudices. He had\r\nbeen a \"poor white\" in the South, whose condition in some respect was\r\nworse than that of slaves. He held a bitter personal hatred of the\r\naristocratic Southerners, who had brought on the war. His disposition at\r\nfirst was to hang the leaders, but after awhile he swung almost as far\r\nin the opposite direction. At the same time, he was not particularly\r\nconcerned for the welfare of the freed slaves, who were called\r\n\"freedmen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S POLICY.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson termed his plan \"my policy,\" and briefly it was: To\r\nappoint provisional or temporary governors for each of the States lately\r\nin rebellion. These governors called conventions of delegates, who were\r\nelected by the former white voters of the respective States. When the\r\nconventions met they declared all the ordinances of secession void,\r\npledged themselves never to pay any debt of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nand ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, as proposed by Congress early in\r\n1865, and which abolished slavery. Before the close of the year named,\r\neach of the excluded States had been reorganized in accordance with this\r\nplan. Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas took the step while Lincoln was\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious question was as to the treatment of the freedmen. The\r\nSouth had no faith that they would work, except when compelled to do so\r\nby slave-overseers. The new governments passed laws, therefore, to\r\ncompel them to work, under the penalty of being declared vagrants and\r\nsent to jail, where they would be forced to hard labor. This method was\r\ndenounced in the North as a re-establishment of slavery under a new\r\nname. The Republican majority in December, 1865, refused for a time to\r\nadmit any members from the States that had been in rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARREL BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThus a quarrel arose between the President and Congress. The latter\r\nproposed to keep the States on probation for a time, before giving them\r\ntheir full rights, while the President strenuously insisted that they\r\nshould be admitted at once on the same status as those that had not been\r\nengaged in secession. To keep out the eighty-five members who had been\r\nrefused admission, Congress imposed a test oath, which excluded all who\r\nhad been connected in any way with the Confederate government. The\r\nRepublicans had a two-thirds vote in Congress which enabled them to pass\r\nany bill they chose over the President's veto. While they had not\r\nformulated any clear policy, they were resolved to protect the freedmen\r\nin all their rights. The reorganization of Tennessee being satisfactory,\r\nher members were received by Congress in 1866.\r\n\r\nThe congressional elections of this year intrenched the Republicans in\r\nCongress, and they were sure of the power for the next two years to\r\ncarry through any policy upon which they might agree. By that time, too,\r\nthey had fixed upon their plan of reconstruction and prepared to enforce\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis policy was to allow the freedmen to vote and to deprive the\r\nConfederate leaders of the right to do so. To accomplish this, the plan\r\nwas to place all the seceding States under military governors, who\r\nshould call new conventions to form State governments. The negroes and\r\nnot the leading Confederates had the power to vote for these delegates.\r\nProvided the new governments allowed the freedmen the right of suffrage,\r\nand ratified the Fourteenth Amendment (which excluded the leading\r\nConfederates from office), then the Southern senators and\r\nrepresentatives would be admitted to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL.\r\n\r\nThe \"civil rights\" bill, which placed the blacks and whites on the same\r\nfooting, was vetoed by the President, March 27th. He pointed out the\r\ndanger of giving suffrage to 4,000,000 ignorant people, lately slaves,\r\nand said unscrupulous men in the North would hasten South and take\r\nadvantage of their ignorance. This was precisely what took place. The\r\nSouth was overrun by a set of scoundrels known as \"carpet-baggers\"\r\n(because they were supposed to carry all their worldly possessions when\r\nthey reached the South in a carpet bag; in many instances a score of\r\ntrunks would not have sufficed to hold what they took back), whose rule\r\nwas worse than a pestilence, and forms one of the most shameful episodes\r\nin our history. According to the old system, the negroes were counted in\r\nmaking up the congressional representation of the South, and the\r\nRepublicans insisted that they were, therefore, entitled to vote. The\r\nbill was passed April 9th, over the President's veto.\r\n\r\nThe story of the bitter quarrel between the President and Congress is an\r\nunpleasant one. Words were uttered by him and by leading members of\r\nCongress which it would be well to forget. The President became angrier\r\nas the wrangle progressed, for, in the face of the hostile majority, he\r\nwas powerless. The fight continued through the years 1867 and 1868. In\r\nJune of the latter year, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North\r\nCarolina, and South Carolina were re-admitted to Congress. The States\r\nthat had seceded were divided into five military districts, and\r\nPresident Johnson, much against his will, was obliged to appoint the\r\ngovernors. As a result of all this, the negroes were largely in the\r\nmajority in the South, and the Republican vote in Congress was greatly\r\nincreased. But in the North, the fall elections went mostly Democratic,\r\nthough not enough so to overcome the opposing majority in Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring these exciting times there were several occurrences of a\r\ndifferent nature which require notice. The Fenians are men of Irish\r\nbirth who favor the independence of their country from Great Britain.\r\nOne of their favorite methods is by the invasion of Canada. In 1866,\r\nabout 1,500 of them entered Canada from Buffalo, and some skirmishing\r\noccurred, but the movement was so clearly a violation of law that the\r\nPresident sent a military force to the frontier and promptly stopped it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOG-CABIN CHURCH AT JUNEAU, ALASKA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN.\r\n\r\nFrance had taken advantage of our Civil War to make an attempt to\r\nestablish a monarchy in Mexico. French troops were landed, an empire\r\nproclaimed, and Maximilian, an Austrian archduke, declared emperor. He\r\nwent to Mexico in 1864, where he was compelled to fight the Mexicans who\r\nhad risen against his rule. With the help of the strong military force\r\nwhich Louis Napoleon placed at his disposal, he was able to maintain\r\nhimself for a time. With the conclusion of the war, our government\r\nintimated to Emperor Napoleon that it would be politic for him to\r\nwithdraw from Mexico, although we were quite willing to allow Maximilian\r\nto remain emperor if it was the wish of the Mexicans. Napoleon acted on\r\nthe warning, but the misguided victim chose to stay, and was captured by\r\nthe Mexicans in 1867 and shot. That was the end of the attempt to\r\nestablish an empire in Mexico, which has long been a prosperous and\r\nwell-governed republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF NEBRASKA.\r\n\r\nNebraska was admitted to the Union in 1867. It was a part of the\r\nLouisiana purchase and was made a Territory in 1854, by the\r\nKansas-Nebraska act. Being located much further north than Kansas, it\r\nescaped the strife and civil war which desolated that Territory. It has\r\nproven to be a rich agricultural region, though it suffers at times from\r\ngrasshoppers, drought, and storms.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to lay an Atlantic telegraph cable resulted in failures\r\nuntil 1866, when a cable was laid from Ireland to Newfoundland. Since\r\nthen other cables have been successfully stretched beneath the ocean\r\nuntil it may be said the world is girdled by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF ALASKA.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 our country purchased from Russia the large tract in the\r\nnorthwest known as Russian America. The sum paid was $7,200,000, a price\r\nwhich many deemed so exorbitant that it was considered a mere pretext of\r\nSecretary Seward, who strongly urged the measure, in order to give\r\nRussia a bonus for her valuable friendship during the Civil War.\r\nInclusive of the islands, the area of Alaska is 577,390 square miles.\r\nThe country was looked upon as a cold, dismal land of fogs and storms,\r\nwithout any appreciable value, but its seal fisheries and timber have\r\nbeen so productive of late years that it has repaid its original cost\r\ntenfold and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIDENING OF THE BREACH BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nOne of the acts passed by Congress in March, 1867, forbade the President\r\nto dismiss any members of his cabinet without the consent of the Senate.\r\nThe President insisted that the Constitution gave him the right to do\r\nthis. Secretary of War Stanton, who had resigned by his request, was\r\nsucceeded by General Grant, who gave way to Stanton, when the latter was\r\nreplaced by the Senate, in January, 1868. On the 21st of February the\r\nPresident dismissed him and appointed Adjutant-General Thomas secretary\r\n_ad interim_. Stanton refused to yield, and remained at his office night\r\nand day, with a company of friends and a military guard. Several demands\r\nfor the office were made by General Thomas, but all were refused. It was\r\nbelieved the President would send troops to enforce his order, but he\r\ndid not proceed to that extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT AND ACQUITTAL OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February the House of Representatives passed a resolution\r\nto impeach the President. This was simply to accuse or charge him with\r\nthe commission of high crimes and misdemeanors. In such cases the trial\r\nmust be conducted by the Senate. A committee was appointed to prepare\r\nthe articles of impeachment, which, in the main, accused the executive\r\nof violating the civil tenure act in his removal of Secretary Stanton,\r\nthough other charges were added.\r\n\r\nWhen the President is impeached, the Constitution provides that his\r\ntrial shall take place before the Senate, sitting as a court. The trial\r\noccupied thirty-two days, lasting until May 26th, with Chief Justice\r\nChase presiding, on which day a vote was taken on the eleventh article\r\nof impeachment. Thirty-five senators voted for acquittal and nineteen\r\nfor conviction. One more vote--making the necessary two-thirds--would\r\nhave convicted. Ten days later the same vote was given on the other\r\ncharges, whereupon a verdict of acquittal was ordered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SOUTHERN LEGISLATURE UNDER CARPET-BAG RULE.\r\n\r\nThe carpet-baggers debauched the negroes, sending some of the most\r\nignorant of them to the Legislature, where their personal conduct was a\r\ndisgrace and they voted away vast sums of money for adventurers who\r\nbribed them with a pittance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAD CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe country was in a lamentable condition. Congress censured the\r\nPresident, who expressed his contempt for that body. General Sheridan,\r\nwhom the President had removed from the governorship of Louisiana, was\r\ncomplimented for his administration, and Congress declared that there\r\nwas no valid government in the South, the jurisdiction of which was\r\ntransferred to General Grant, the head of the army.\r\n\r\nBy this time the carpet-baggers had swarmed into the sorely harried\r\nregion like so many locusts. They secured the support of the ignorant\r\nblacks, by falsehood and misrepresentations, controlled the State\r\nLegislatures, and had themselves elected to Congress. Enormous debts\r\nwere piled up, and negroes, who could not write their names, exultingly\r\nmade laws for their former masters, who remained in sullen silence at\r\ntheir homes and wondered what affliction was coming next. The colored\r\nlegislators adjourned pell-mell to attend the circus; hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars were stolen, and extravagance, corruption, and\r\ndebauchery ran riot. As a public man remarked, one general\r\nconflagration, sweeping from the Potomac to the Gulf of Mexico, could\r\nnot have wrought more devastation in the South than the few years of\r\ncarpet-bag governments.\r\n\r\nYet all such evils are sure to right themselves, sooner or later. The\r\nmeans are apt to be violent and revolutionary, and sometimes breed crime\r\nof itself. It was not in the nature of things that the whites should\r\nremain passive and meek under this unspeakable misrule. They united for\r\nself-protection. One of the bands thus formed was the Ku-Klux, which in\r\ntime committed so many crimes in terrorizing the negroes that they were\r\nsuppressed by the stern arm of the military; a revolt of the best people\r\ntook place, and soon after 1870 the blight of carpet-bag government\r\ndisappeared from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUE RECONCILIATION.\r\n\r\nDespite the turbulence and angry feeling, the work of reconciliation\r\nwent on of itself. Northern capital entered the promising fields of the\r\nSouth; former Union and Confederate leaders, as well as privates,\r\nrespected one another, as brave men always do, and became warm friends.\r\nWhile many of the former went South, hundreds of the latter made their\r\nhomes in the North, where they were welcomed and assisted in the\r\nstruggle to \"get upon their feet.\" This fraternal mingling of former\r\nsoldiers and the friendly exchange of visits between Union and\r\nConfederate posts brought about true reconciliation, despite the\r\nwrangles of politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1868.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, this was fully accomplished, the presidential election\r\nof 1868 took place. The most popular hero in this country, as in others,\r\nis the military one, and the great value of General Grant's services in\r\nthe war for the Union made it clear, long before the assembling of the\r\nnominating convention, that he would be the candidate of the Republican\r\nparty. He was unanimously named, with Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, as the nominee for\r\nVice-President. The Democrats placed in nomination Horatio Seymour, of\r\nNew York, and General Francis P. Blair, of Missouri. The result in\r\nNovember was as follows: Republican ticket, 214 electoral votes;\r\nDemocratic, 80. The election was a striking proof of the popularity of\r\nthe great soldier.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson was hopeful of a nomination from the Democrats, but his\r\nname was scarcely mentioned. He lived in retirement for a number of\r\nyears, but was elected United States senator in 1875, and he died at his\r\nhome July 31st of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant had already become so identified with the history of\r\nour country that little remains to be added to that which has been\r\nrecorded. He was born at Point Pleasant, Ohio, April 27, 1822. Appointed\r\nto West Point, he gave no evidence of special brilliancy, and was\r\ngraduated in 1843 with only a fair standing. He did good service in the\r\nwar with Mexico and was brevetted captain, but resigned his commission\r\nin 1854 and went into business, where he attained only moderate success.\r\nHe was among the first to volunteer when the Civil War broke out. The\r\nopportunity thus presented for the full display of his military genius\r\nrapidly brought him to the front, the culmination of his career being\r\nreached when he compelled the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox\r\nCourt-House in April, 1865, thereby bringing the long and terrible war\r\nto a triumphant conclusion. He was a man of simple tastes, modest, but\r\nwith an unerring knowledge of his own abilities, thoroughly patriotic,\r\nhonest, chivalrous, devoted to his friends, and so trustful of them that\r\nhe remained their supporters sometimes after receiving proof of their\r\nunworthiness. The mistakes of his administration were due mainly to this\r\ntrait of his character, which it is hard to condemn without reservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT.\r\n\r\n(1822-1885.) Two terms, 1869-1877.]\r\n\r\nThe country being fairly launched once more on its career of progress\r\nand prosperity, the government gained the opportunity to give attention\r\nto matters which it was compelled to pass by while the war was in\r\nprogress. The first most important step was to call England to account\r\nfor her help in fitting out Confederate privateers, when we were in\r\nextremity. It required considerable tact and delicacy to get the\r\n\"Alabama Claims,\" as they were termed, in proper form before the British\r\nauthorities, for they felt sensitive, but it was finally accomplished.\r\nThe arbitration tribunal which sat at Geneva, Switzerland, in June,\r\n1872, decreed that England should pay the United States the sum of\r\n$15,500,000 because of the damage inflicted by Confederate cruisers upon\r\nNorthern commerce. The amount was paid, and friendly relations between\r\nthe two countries were fully restored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. JULIA DENT GRANT.]\r\n\r\nOur rapid growth had long since made the building of a railroad from the\r\nEast to the Pacific a necessity that continually grew more urgent.\r\nConstruction was begun as early as 1863, but the Civil War caused the\r\nwork to lag, and at the end of two years only one hundred miles had been\r\ngraded and forty laid. The progress then became more vigorous.\r\n\r\nThe road consisted of two divisions. The first was from Omaha, Nebraska,\r\nto Ogden, Utah, a distance of 1,032 miles, while the western division,\r\nknown as the Central Pacific, covered the distance of 885 miles between\r\nOgden and San Francisco. Steadily approaching each other, these long\r\nlines of railway met on the 10th of May, 1869, when the last spike, made\r\nof solid gold, was driven, and the two locomotives, standing with their\r\npilots almost touching, joined in a joyous screech of their whistles.\r\nThe important event was celebrated with much ceremony, for it was worthy\r\nof being commemorated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION COMPLETED.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious work of reconstruction was completed during the early\r\nmonths of 1870. Virginia had held out against the terms prescribed by\r\nCongress, but her senators and representatives were admitted to their\r\nseats in the latter part of January; those of Mississippi in the\r\nfollowing month, and those of Texas in March, at which time the\r\nsecretary of State issued a proclamation declaring the adoption of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees negro\r\nsuffrage. For the first time in almost twenty years, all the States were\r\nfully represented in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO FIRE.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October, 1871, Chicago was visited by the greatest\r\nconflagration of modern times, with the single exception of that of\r\nMoscow. Like many events, fraught with momentous consequences, it had a\r\ntrifling cause. A cow kicked over a lamp in a stable on De Koven Street,\r\nwhich set fire to the straw. A gale swiftly carried the flames into some\r\nadjoining lumber yards and frame houses. All the conditions were\r\nfavorable for a tremendous conflagration. The fire swept over the south\r\nbranch of the Chicago River, and raged furiously in the business\r\nportion of the city. The main channel of the river was leaped as if it\r\nwere a narrow alley, and there were anxious hours when thousands\r\nbelieved the whole city was doomed. As it was, the fire-swept district\r\ncovered four or five miles, and fully 20,000 buildings were burned. It\r\nis believed that 250 lives were lost, about 100,000 people made\r\nhomeless, and $192,000,000 worth of property destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BURNING OF CHICAGO IN 1871.]\r\n\r\nChicago's affliction stirred the sympathy of the whole country.\r\nContributions were sent thither from every State, and everything was\r\ndone to aid the sufferers who had lost their all. With true American\r\npluck, the afflicted people bent to the work before them. Night and day\r\nthousands toiled, and within the space of a year a newer and more\r\nmagnificent city rose like a Phoenix from its ashes. Chicago to-day is\r\none of the grandest and most enterprising cities in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY.\r\n\r\nWe had made a treaty with England in 1846 which located the line of our\r\nnorthwestern boundary along the 49th parallel westward to the middle of\r\n\"the channel\" separating the continent from Vancouver's Island, and\r\nthen southward through the middle of the channel and of Fuca's Strait to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. It was found, however, there were several channels,\r\nand it was impossible to decide which was meant in the treaty. The claim\r\nof England included the island of San Juan, she insisting that the\r\ndesignated channel ran to the south of that island. Naturally, we took\r\nthe opposite view and were equally insistent that the channel ran to the\r\nnorth, and that San Juan, therefore, belonged to us. The two nations\r\ndisplayed their good sense by referring the dispute to arbitration and\r\nselected the Emperor of Germany as the arbitrator. He decided in 1872 in\r\nour favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1872.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious presidential election that took place in 1872. The\r\nSouth was bitterly opposed to the Republican plan of reconstruction and\r\na good many in the North sympathized with them. One of the strongest\r\nopponents of Grant's renomination was the _New York Tribune_, of which\r\nHorace Greeley was editor. The Republicans who agreed with him were\r\ncalled \"Liberal Republicans,\" while the Straight-out Democrats retained\r\ntheir organization. Naturally, the regular Republicans renominated\r\nGrant, but Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts, took the place of Schuyler\r\nColfax as the nominee for the Vice-Presidency. Horace Greeley, who had\r\nspent his life in vigorously fighting the principles of the Democratic\r\nparty, was now endorsed by that organization after his nomination by the\r\nLiberal Republicans, with B. Gratz Brown, of Missouri, as his running\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF CHICAGO STOCK-YARDS, THE LARGEST IN THE\r\nWORLD.]\r\n\r\nThe election was a perfect jumble. Eight candidates were voted for as\r\nPresident and eleven for Vice-President. Grant received 286 electoral\r\nvotes and carried thirty-one States. Greeley was so crushed by his\r\ndefeat that he lost his reason and died within a month after election.\r\nHis electors scattered their votes, so that Thomas A. Hendricks, the\r\nregular Democratic candidate, received 42; B. Gratz Brown, 16; Charles\r\nJ. Jenkins, 2; and David Davis, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe second term of Grant was more troublous than the first. The\r\ndifficulties with the Indians, dating from the first settlement in the\r\ncountry, were still with us. At the suggestion of the President, a grand\r\ncouncil of delegates of the civilized tribes met in December, 1870, in\r\nthe Choctaw division of the Indian Territory. The subject brought before\r\nthem was the organization of a republican form of government, to be\r\nunder the general rule of the United States. A second convention was\r\nheld in the following July and a provisional government organized. A\r\nproposal was adopted that the United States should set aside large\r\ntracts of land for the exclusive occupancy and use of the Indians. These\r\nareas were to be known as \"reservations,\" and so long as the Indians\r\nremained upon them they were to be protected from molestation.\r\n\r\nThis scheme seemed to promise a settlement of the vexed question, but it\r\nfailed to accomplish what was expected. In the first place, most of the\r\nIndians were unfriendly to it. No matter how large a part of country you\r\nmay give to a red man as his own, he will not be satisfied without\r\npermission to roam and hunt over _all_ of it.\r\n\r\nA more potent cause of trouble was the origin of all the Indian\r\ntroubles, from the colonial times to the present: the dishonesty and\r\nrascality of the white men brought officially in contact with the red\r\nmen. Not only did these miscreants pursue their evil ways among the\r\nIndians themselves, but there was an \"Indian ring\" in Washington, whose\r\nmembers spent vast sums of money to secure the legislation that enabled\r\nthem to cheat the savages out of millions of dollars. This wholesale\r\nplundering of the different tribes caused Indian wars and massacres,\r\nwhile the evil men at the seat of the government grew wealthy and lived\r\nin luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODOC TROUBLES.\r\n\r\nTrouble at once resulted from removing the Indians to reservations that\r\nwere inferior in every respect to their former homes. The Modocs, who\r\nhad only a few hundred warriors, were compelled by our government to\r\nabandon their fertile lands south of Oregon and go to a section which\r\nwas little better than a desert. They rebelled, and, under the\r\nleadership of Captain Jack and Scar-faced Charley, a number took refuge\r\namong some lava beds on the upper edge of California. On the 11th of\r\nApril, 1873, a conference was held between the Indian leaders and six\r\nmembers of the peace commission. While it was in progress, the savages\r\nsuddenly attacked the white men. General Edward S. Canby and Dr. Thomas\r\nwere instantly killed, and General Meachem, another member, was badly\r\nwounded, but escaped with his life.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Modocs was pushed. After much difficulty and\r\nfighting, they were driven to the wall and compelled to surrender.\r\nCaptain Jack and two of his brother chiefs were hanged in the following\r\nOctober. The remaining members were removed to a reservation in Dakota,\r\nwhere they have given no further trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR IN LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this year, civil war broke out in Louisiana because\r\nof the quarrels over reconstruction measures. The difficulty first\r\nappeared two years earlier, when opposing factions made attempts to\r\ncapture the Legislature by unseating members belonging to the opposing\r\nparty. Matters became so grave that in the following January Federal\r\ntroops had to be used to preserve the peace. In December, 1872, another\r\nbitter quarrel arose over the election of the governor and members of\r\nthe Legislature. The returning board divided, one part declaring William\r\nP. Kellogg elected, while the other gave the election to John McEnery,\r\nthe candidate of the white man's party. Most of the negro vote had been\r\ncast for Kellogg.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, two rival State governments were organized. McEnery\r\nwas enjoined by the United States district court from acting, because,\r\nas was asserted, the returning board which declared him elected had done\r\nso in defiance of its order.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this prohibition, McEnery was inaugurated. The question\r\nwas referred to the Federal government, which declared in favor of\r\nKellogg. Thereupon the McEnery government disbanded, but in the latter\r\npart of 1874 McEnery again laid claim to election. D.P. Penn, his\r\nlieutenant-governor, and his armed followers took possession of the\r\nState House. A fight followed in which Kellogg was driven from the\r\nbuilding, twenty-six persons killed and a large number wounded. Kellogg\r\nappealed to Washington for help. McEnery, who was absent during these\r\nviolent proceedings, now returned and took the place of Penn. President\r\nGrant ordered his supporters to disperse and General Emory forced\r\nMcEnery to surrender. The peace was broken in January, 1875, over the\r\nelection of members to the Legislature, and the Federal troops were\r\nagain called to restore order. A congressional committee was sent South\r\nto investigate, and finally the quarrel was ended and Kellogg was\r\nrecognized as the legal governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF COLORADO.\r\n\r\nColorado became the thirty-eighth State in August, 1876. The name is\r\nSpanish, and refers to that part of the Rocky Mountains noted for its\r\nmany colored peaks. Colorado has more than thirty peaks within its\r\nborders whose height is quite or nearly three miles. The wild,\r\nmountainous region was explored in 1858 at two points, one near Pike's\r\nPeak and the other in the southwestern portion. Both exploring parties\r\ndiscovered gold, which, while abundant, is hard to extract. The\r\nTerritory was organized in 1861, and the principal discoveries of the\r\nenormous deposits of silver have been made since 1870. The date of\r\nColorado's admission has caused it often to be referred to as the\r\n\"Centennial State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PANIC OF 1873.\r\n\r\nWe had learned the meaning of hard times in 1837 and again in 1857. Once\r\nmore, in 1873, the blight fell upon the country. There were various\r\ncauses, all of which, in one sense, were the war. Prices had become\r\ninflated, money was plentiful, and cities, towns, and people had become\r\nextravagant. A mania seemed to seize municipal corporations for\r\nindulging in \"improvements,\" which brought ruinous debts upon the\r\nmunicipalities. Enormous sums of money were invested in the building of\r\nnew railroad lines where the country was not developed sufficiently to\r\nrepay the expenditures. The quantity of goods brought into this country\r\nwas much in excess of that exported, a fact which turned the balance of\r\ntrade, as it was termed, against us. This required the sending abroad of\r\na large amount of money.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the extravagance in railroad building, it may be said\r\nthat, in the single year 1871, 8,000 miles were put in operation.\r\nInstead of using ready money with which to build these lines, bonds were\r\nissued by the railroad companies, which expected to pay the debts out of\r\nthe future earnings of the roads. In the course of five years\r\n$1,750,000,000 were invested in railroad projects. The same speculative\r\nspirit pervaded mining and manufacturing companies, which also borrowed\r\nmoney by issuing bonds. A great amount of these were sold abroad, after\r\nwhich the home market was industriously worked through the newspapers,\r\nwhich overflowed with glowing promises. Thousands of poor widows,\r\norphans, and the trustees of estates invested all their scanty savings\r\nin these enterprises.\r\n\r\nThen the failures began. The banking firm of Jay Cooke & Company,\r\nPhiladelphia, one of the greatest in the United States, suspended, and\r\nthe whole country was alarmed. Next came the panic, which reached its\r\nheight in a few months. This was followed by dull times, when factories\r\nclosed, and multitudes were thrown out of employment. Several years\r\npassed before the country fully recovered from the panic of 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTABLE DEATHS.\r\n\r\nMany noted men died during those times. The bluff, aggressive, and\r\npatriotic Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln's war secretary, passed away in\r\nDecember, 1869, shortly after his appointment to the bench of the\r\nsupreme court by President Grant. General R.E. Lee, who had become\r\npresident of the Washington and Lee University, died at his home in\r\nLexington, Virginia, in 1870. Among others of prominence who died in the\r\nsame year were General George H. Thomas and Admiral Farragut. In 1872,\r\nWilliam H. Seward, Horace Greeley, Professor Morse, and General George\r\nH. Meade breathed their last, and in the year following Chief Justice\r\nChase and Charles Sumner died. Millard Fillmore and Andrew Johnson, as\r\nhas been stated, died respectively in 1874 and 1875.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO GENERAL LEE AT RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats now gained a majority in the House of Representatives for\r\nthe first time since 1860. Among the members elected from the South were\r\nseveral distinguished military leaders of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nbesides Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, who had been its\r\nvice-president.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that gold was discovered among the Black Hills,\r\nwhich by treaty belonged to the Sioux Indians, since the section was\r\nwithin their reservation. White men were warned to keep away, and steps\r\nwere taken by the military authorities to prevent them entering upon the\r\nforbidden ground. But no risk or danger is sufficient to quench men's\r\nthirst for gold, and thousands of the most desperate characters hurried\r\nto the Black Hills and began digging for the yellow deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTER'S MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux are fierce and warlike. They have given our government a great\r\ndeal of trouble, and, finding their reservation invaded by white men,\r\nthey retaliated by leaving it, burning houses, stealing horses, and\r\ncattle, and killing settlers in Wyoming and Montana. Their outrages\r\nbecame so serious that the government sent a strong military force\r\nthither under Generals Terry and Crook, which drove a formidable body of\r\nwarriors under the well-known Sitting Bull and others toward the Big\r\nHorn Mountains and River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GEORGE CROOK.]\r\n\r\nGenerals Reno and Custer rode forward with the Seventh Cavalry to\r\nreconnoitre, and discovered the Indians encamped in a village nearly\r\nthree miles long on the left bank of the Little Big Horn River. Custer,\r\nwho was an impetuous, headlong officer, instantly charged upon the\r\nIndians without waiting for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThis woeful blunder was made June 25, 1876. All that is known of it has\r\nbeen obtained from the Indians themselves. They agree that Custer and\r\nhis men dashed directly among the thousands of warriors, and that they\r\nfought with desperate heroism, but Custer and every one of his men were\r\nkilled. The number was 261. General Reno held his position at the lower\r\nend of the encampment on the bluffs of the Little Big Horn until\r\nreinforcements arrived. Soldiers were sent to the neighborhood, and\r\nthere was more sharp fighting. It was a long time and there was much\r\nnegotiation necessary before the Sioux could be persuaded to return to\r\ntheir reservation in Dakota.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1876, the United States was one hundred years old.\r\nPreparations had been on foot for several years to give it a fitting\r\ncelebration. A bill was passed by Congress as early as March, 1871,\r\nproviding that an exhibition of foreign and American arts, products, and\r\nmanufactures should be held under the auspices of the government of the\r\nUnited States. A centennial commission was appointed, consisting of\r\nGeneral Joseph R. Hawley, of Connecticut; Professor John L. Campbell, of\r\nIndiana; Alfred T. Goshorn, of Ohio; and John L. Shoemaker, of\r\nPennsylvania. Naturally Philadelphia, where the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was written and signed, was selected as the most fitting\r\nplace to hold the celebration. Fairmount Park, one of the largest and\r\nfinest in the world, was set apart for the buildings.\r\n\r\nThe invitations sent to other nations were courteously accepted, the\r\nfollowing being those that took part: The Argentine Confederation,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Denmark, Ecuador,\r\nEgypt, France (including Algeria), German Empire, Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies, Greece, Guatemala, Hawaii, Haiti, Honduras, Italy, Japan,\r\nLiberia, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Orange Free State,\r\nPersia, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunis,\r\nTurkey, United States of Colombia, and Venezuela.\r\n\r\nTo furnish room for the display of the myriads of articles, five\r\nprincipal buildings were erected, viz.: the Main Building, 1,876 feet\r\nlong and 464 feet wide; the Art Gallery or Memorial Hall, Machinery\r\nHall, Agricultural Hall, and Horticultural Hall. The exhibition was\r\nformally opened by President Grant, May 1st, and closed by him six\r\nmonths later. The daily attendance began with about 5,000, but rose to\r\n275,000 toward the close. The total number of visitors was some\r\n10,000,000, and the total receipts, as officially given out, were\r\n$3,761,598. The exhibition was a splendid success in every sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1876.\r\n\r\nFew people to-day understand the danger through which the country passed\r\nin the autumn and winter of 1876. In June, the two great political\r\nparties put their presidential tickets in the field. That of the\r\nRepublicans was Rutherford B. Hayes, of Ohio, and William A. Wheeler, of\r\nNew York; of the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden, of New York, and Thomas A.\r\nHendricks, of Indiana. The Independent Greenback party also nominated a\r\nticket, at the head of which was the venerable philanthropist, Peter\r\nCooper, of New York, with Samuel F. Cary, of Ohio, the candidate for the\r\nvice-presidency.\r\n\r\nThere was little difference between the platforms of the two leading\r\nparties. The Democrats declared for _reform_ through all the methods of\r\nthe administration. The Republicans were equally loud in their calls for\r\nthe reform of every political abuse, and for the punishment of any and\r\nall who made wrongful use of political offices. They also insisted that\r\nthe rights of the colored men should be safeguarded, and denounced the\r\ndoctrine of State sovereignty, of which there was little to be feared,\r\nsince it had been effectually killed by the war.\r\n\r\nThe Greenbackers made considerable stir. They also used the shibboleth\r\nof reform, but put the currency question before all others. Although the\r\ngovernment was committed to the redemption of the national legal-tenders\r\nand bonds in gold, the Greenbackers insisted that this was impossible,\r\nand was also unjust to the debtor class. They claimed, further, that it\r\nwas the duty of the government to provide a national paper currency,\r\nbased not on specie, but on bonds bearing a low rate of interest. The\r\nRepublicans and Democrats maintained that the government could not\r\nabrogate its promises of redeeming the currency and bonds in gold.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback party polled 81,740 votes, the Prohibition 9,522, and the\r\nAmerican 2,636, none gaining an electoral vote. For several days after\r\nthe November election, it was generally believed that the Democrats had\r\nbeen successful, though a few Republican papers, notably the _New York\r\nTimes_, persistently claimed that the Republican ticket had been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEMORIAL HALL OF 1876.]\r\n\r\nThere was a dispute in four States. In Louisiana, the returning board\r\nthrew out the returns from several parishes on the ground of\r\nintimidation and fraud, thereby placing 4,000 majority to the credit of\r\nthe Republicans. The Democrats insisted that the rejected votes should\r\nbe counted, and, had it been done, Tilden would have been elected.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, two bodies claimed to be the legal Legislature and\r\nboth canvassed the returns, one giving a plurality of 800 to the\r\nRepublican ticket and the other a smaller majority to the Democratic.\r\nPrecisely the same wrangle occurred in Florida, where each side claimed\r\na majority of about a hundred. Matters were still more complicated in\r\nOregon, where a Republican elector was declared ineligible, because he\r\nheld the office of postmaster at the time he was chosen elector. The\r\ngovernor proposed to withhold the certificate from him and give it to a\r\nDemocrat. Had everything claimed by the Republicans been conceded, they\r\nwould have had 185 and the Democrats 184. It was necessary, therefore,\r\nfor the Republicans to maintain every point in order to secure their\r\nPresident, for it was beyond dispute that Tilden had received 184\r\nelectoral votes. On the popular vote, he had 4,284,885 to 4,033,950 for\r\nHayes. Each party charged the other with fraud, and thousands of\r\nDemocrats were so incensed at what they believed was a plot to cheat\r\nthem out of the presidency that they were ready to go to war. Had they\r\ndone so, it would have been the most terrible peril that ever came upon\r\nthe Republic, for the war would not have been one section against the\r\nother, but of neighborhood against neighborhood throughout the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL J. TILDEN (1814-1886.)]\r\n\r\nAs if nothing in the way of discord should be lacking, the Senate was\r\nRepublican and the House Democratic. The election being disputed, it\r\nfell to them to decide the question--something they would never do,\r\nsince they were deadlocked. This was so apparent that thoughtful men saw\r\nthat some new and extraordinary means must be found to save the country\r\nfrom civil war.\r\n\r\nCongress, after long and earnest discussion, passed a bill creating an\r\nElectoral Commission, to which it was agreed to submit the dispute. This\r\ncommission was to consist of fifteen members, five to be appointed by\r\nthe House, five by the Senate, and the remaining five to consist of\r\njudges of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe Senate being Republican, its presiding officer, the Vice-President,\r\nnamed three Republicans and two Democrats; the House naturally appointed\r\nthree Democrats and two Republicans; while of the Supreme Court, three\r\nwere Republicans and two Democrats. This, it will be noted, gave to the\r\ncommission eight Republicans and seven Democrats. The body by a strict\r\nparty vote decided every dispute in favor of the Republicans, and on the\r\n2d of March, 1877, two days before inauguration, Rutherford B. Hayes was\r\ndecided President-elect of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION WHICH DECIDED UPON THE ELECTION\r\nOF PRESIDENT HAYES.\r\n\r\nComposed of three Republican and two Democratic Senators, three\r\nDemocratic and two Republican Representatives, three Republican and two\r\nDemocratic Justices of the Supreme Court; total, eight Republicans and\r\nseven Democrats. By a strict party vote the decision was given in favor\r\nof Mr. Hayes, who, two days later, March 4, 1877, was inaugurated\r\nPresident of the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIONS OF HAYES, GARFIELD, AND ARTHUR, 1877-1885.\r\n\r\nR.B.

He entered the military service, at the\r\nbeginning of the war, as major, and rose to the rank of brevet\r\nmajor-general. His career as a soldier was creditable. While still in\r\nthe service, in 1864, he was elected to Congress, and was governor of\r\nOhio in 1867, 1869, and again in 1875. His popularity as chief\r\nmagistrate of one of the leading States led to his nomination to the\r\npresidency, to which, however, it must be conceded, he had not a clear\r\ntitle. He died at Fremont, Ohio, January 17, 1893.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes proved his desire to strengthen the fraternal feeling\r\nbetween the North and South by appointing as a member of his cabinet\r\nDavid McKey, his postmaster-general. Mr. McKey was from Tennessee, and\r\nhad served the Confederacy during the Civil War. Hayes' administration\r\non the whole was uneventful, though marked by a number of incidents\r\nwhich deserve mention. It was in 1877 that the first telephone for\r\nbusiness purposes was put into use. It connected the residence of\r\nCharles Williams, in Somerville, Massachusetts, with his business office\r\nin Boston, three miles distant. Alexander Bell, of the latter city, was\r\nthe inventor of the instrument, which is now in general use throughout\r\nthe country, and serves to connect points more than a thousand miles\r\napart.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY STRIKES.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1877 occurred one of the most violent outbreaks among\r\nlabor men that has ever been known in this country. There was unrest in\r\nthe mining districts over the question of wages, and the dissatisfaction\r\nspread to the principal manufacturing points. When the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad made a reduction of 10 per cent. in the pay of its\r\nemployees it was followed, July 14th, by a partial strike on their line.\r\nThe men had the sympathy of workmen throughout the country, and the\r\nstrike spread to the Pennsylvania, Erie, New York Central, and their\r\nwestern connections, including the Missouri and Pacific, and a number of\r\nless important lines west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is one of the most intelligent\r\nand conservative labor organizations in the country. It has won the\r\nrespect of corporations as well as of the community-at-large by its\r\nfairness and its refusal to engage in strikes, except as a last resort\r\nagainst grievances. Its members are located in all parts of the country,\r\nand include a good many thousands. In the strike named the Brotherhood\r\ntook the lead, and the firemen, brakemen, and other railroad employees\r\njoined them. The result was the stoppage of the wheels of commerce and\r\nthe ruin of vast amounts of perishable freight, to say nothing of the\r\nexpensive delays of all kinds. The railroad companies called upon the\r\nvarious State authorities for protection in operating their lines, but,\r\nas is generally the case, the militia were either in sympathy with the\r\nstrikers or were afraid of them. As a final resort, an appeal was made\r\nto the United States government, whose soldiers understand only one\r\nduty, that of obeying orders.\r\n\r\nThe strikers stopped all trains in Baltimore and Martinsburg, West\r\nVirginia, and defied the authorities. The militia were scattered, but a\r\nfew regulars were sufficient to raise the blockade. On the 20th of July,\r\nin an attempt of the rioters to resist the clearing of the streets in\r\nBaltimore, nine persons were killed and a score wounded. The strike\r\nextended until it included the whole country, with the exception of the\r\ncotton-growing States.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous outbreak was in Pittsburg, where an immense mob held\r\ncontrol of the city for two days. Disorder and violence reigned, and the\r\nauthorities were powerless. When on the 21st soldiers appeared on the\r\nstreets they were assailed with stones and pistol-shots, and they\r\nreplied with several volleys which killed and wounded a number of\r\nrioters. This only added fuel to the flames, and the mob became more\r\nsavage than ever. The soldiers were attacked so furiously that they ran\r\ninto a roundhouse of the railway company for protection. There they were\r\nbesieged, and oil cars were rolled against the building and fired with\r\nthe purpose of burning the soldiers to death. The firemen were not\r\nallowed to put out the flames, and it was several days before the\r\ndefenders were rescued.\r\n\r\nThe infuriated mob applied the torch to the buildings of the railroad\r\ncompany, gutted cars, scattered or carried off the contents, burst open\r\nand drank barrels of whiskey, and raged like so many wild beasts. Before\r\nthe terrific outbreak subsided, the Union Depot and all the machine\r\nshops and railway buildings in the city were burned. Among the losses\r\nwere 126 locomotives and 2,500 cars laden with valuable freight. The\r\nregular troops finally subdued the rioters, but not until a hundred\r\npeople had been killed and property destroyed to the value of five\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nThere was rioting accompanied with violence in Chicago, Buffalo,\r\nColumbus, Ohio, and at many other points. In Chicago, on the 26th of\r\nJuly, nineteen persons were killed. St. Louis was disturbed, but there\r\nwas no special outbreak. In San Francisco a savage attack was made on\r\nthe Chinese and the managers of the lumber yards. At one period, on\r\n6,000 miles of railroad not a wheel was turned, and 100,000 laborers\r\nwere idle or assisting in the rioting. Such violent ebullitions soon\r\nexpend themselves. By-and-by the men began returning to their work, and\r\nwithin two or three weeks all the railroads were operating as usual.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the elevated railway system was adopted in New York\r\nCity. It has proved so convenient that many lines have been added in the\r\nmetropolis, and the same means of travel is used in other cities, though\r\nof late years electric trolley cars have been widely introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEZ PERCE WAR.\r\n\r\nWhen Lewis and Clark journeyed across the upper part of our country, at\r\nthe beginning of the century, they made a treaty with the Nez Perce\r\nIndians, whose home was in the northwest. They were visited afterward by\r\nmissionaries, and no trouble occurred with them until after our war with\r\nMexico. A large section of their land was bought by the United States\r\ngovernment in 1854, and a reservation was set apart for them in\r\nnorthwestern Idaho and northeastern Oregon. As in the case of the\r\nSeminoles of Florida however, many of the chiefs were opposed to the\r\nsale of their lands, and, when the date came for their departure,\r\nrefused to leave.\r\n\r\nChief Joseph of the Nez Perces was one of the most remarkable Indians of\r\nthe century. He was shrewd, sagacious, brave, and remarkably\r\nintelligent. General Wesley Merritt, of the United States army, has\r\npronounced his military genius of the highest order, and, in the\r\nincidents we are about to narrate, his exploit in its way has never been\r\nsurpassed. A good many people will recall seeing Joseph at the\r\nceremonies at the tomb of General Grant in 1897, where his fine military\r\nappearance attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, General Howard, commanding the department of the Columbia,\r\nmarched against the troublesome Nez Perces with a small force of\r\nregulars. Being too weak to fight the soldiers, Chief Joseph, at the\r\nhead of his band, repeatedly eluded them with masterly skill. This\r\nstrange chase continued for hundreds of miles, Joseph keeping his women,\r\nchildren, and impedimenta not only intact, but beyond reach of the\r\npursuers, who were filled with admiration of his genius. In the autumn\r\nof 1877, the Nez Perces passed through the mountains of northern\r\nMontana, where they were confronted by Colonel Miles and the regulars.\r\nEven then Joseph could not be brought to battle, and crossed the\r\nMissouri near the mouth of the Mussel Shell. In the Bear Paw Mountains,\r\nhowever, his camp was surrounded and he was brought to bay. The Nez\r\nPerces fought with great bravery, but were defeated. Joseph faced the\r\ninevitable, and, walking forward to where General Howard was sitting on\r\nhis horse, handed him his rifle. Then, pointing to the sun in the sky,\r\nhe said: \"From where the sun is in yonder heavens, I fight the white man\r\nno more.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Howard admired the valiant and chivalrous warrior, who had\r\nconducted his campaign not only with rare skill, but without any of the\r\noutrages and cruelties which seem natural to the American race. He took\r\nhis hand, and promised to be his friend. General Howard was able to keep\r\nhis promise, and secured such a favorable location for Joseph and his\r\nband that they have been peaceable and satisfied ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMONETIZATION OF SILVER.\r\n\r\nThe money or currency question has long been a disturbing factor in\r\npolitics. During the war the silver currency had been out of\r\ncirculation, its place being taken for awhile by postage stamps and\r\nafterward by \"shinplasters,\" which were paper fractional parts of a\r\ndollar. In 1873, Congress made gold the exclusive money standard. Silver\r\ndepreciated some ten per cent., and the \"hard money\" people opposed the\r\nmeasures that were set on foot to remonetize silver; that is, to bring\r\nit into circulation again. Such a bill was passed, then vetoed by the\r\nPresident, promptly repassed over his veto, and it was ordered that the\r\ncoinage of silver should proceed at a rate not to exceed $2,000,000 a\r\nmonth. About this time (December 18, 1878), gold and paper money for the\r\nfirst time in seventeen years was of equal value.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the law of 1875, specie payments by the United States\r\ngovernment was effected January 1, 1879. At that time there was an\r\naccumulation of $138,000,000 in the United States treasury, nearly all\r\nof it gold, representing forty per cent. of the outstanding bonds. The\r\nmere knowledge of this fact so strengthened the public credit that,\r\ninstead of the anticipated rush on the 1st of January, only $11,000,000\r\nwas offered for redemption. The problem of specie payment proved to be a\r\nbugbear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANT AT WINDSOR CASTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERY AWARD.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Washington, signed in 1872, Americans were allowed to\r\ntake fish of every kind, except shellfish, on the seacoasts and shores\r\nand in the bays, harbors, and creeks of the provinces of Quebec, Nova\r\nScotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward's Island, and the adjacent islands,\r\nwithout restriction as to the distance from shore. In return for this\r\nprivilege, our government agreed to charge a duty upon certain kinds of\r\nfish brought by British subjects into American harbors. There were other\r\nmutual concessions, and, in order to balance matters and make everything\r\nsmooth, the whole question was placed in the hands of an arbitration\r\ncommission, which began its sessions in the summer of 1877, at Halifax.\r\nThe commission included a member appointed by the Queen, one by the\r\nPresident, and the third by the Austrian ambassador at the Court of St.\r\nJames. Our country was astounded by the verdict of this commission,\r\nwhich was that the United States should pay the sum of $5,000,000 to the\r\nBritish government. Even England was surprised, and our government was\r\ndisposed to refuse to accept the verdict; but to do that would have\r\nestablished a bad precedent, and the sum named was paid to Great Britain\r\nin the autumn of 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW FEVER SCOURGE.\r\n\r\nYellow fever has been one of the most dreadful scourges that our country\r\nhas suffered. It first appeared on this continent in 1780, when Boston\r\nwas ravaged in the summer of that year. It afterward appeared in New\r\nYork and Philadelphia, especially in 1793 and 1797, after which its\r\nvisitations have been mainly confined to the South, where the sanitation\r\nmeasures have been less rigid than in the North. It has been proven that\r\nstrict quarantine and absolute cleanliness are safeguards against its\r\nentrance, though, after the frightful plague has once appeared in a\r\nplace, it is impossible to stamp it out. It subsides before the approach\r\nof frost and cold weather, and the cure for those smitten is to carry\r\nthem to cool elevations. Thus far science has not been able to discover\r\nthe real nature of yellow fever, nor to provide a remedy. It has been\r\nestablished, however, that it is due to bacilli or disease germs, as is\r\nthe case with cholera, consumption, and many other diseases, and there\r\nis reason to believe a specific remedy will soon be brought to light.\r\n\r\nOne of the most destructive visitations of yellow fever was in the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1873. Memphis and New Orleans suffered the most,\r\nand at one time those cities were abandoned by all who could leave them.\r\nOther portions of the country contributed every possible assistance in\r\nthe way of medical help, nurses, and money, but before the scourge was\r\nextirpated by cool weather fully 15,000 persons had succumbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1878.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention was held in Chicago at the opening of\r\nJune. As General Grant had returned from his memorable tour round the\r\nworld, having been received everywhere with the highest honors, a\r\ndetermined effort was now made to renominate him for a third term.\r\nRoscoe Conkling, United States senator from New York, was the leader in\r\nthe movement, and the whole number of Grant's supporters was 306, who\r\nwithout a break cast their vote for him thirty-six times in succession.\r\nThey failed because of the widespread opposition to any man holding the\r\nexalted office for a longer period than Washington, the Father of his\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nThe principal rivals of General Grant were James G. Blaine, of Maine,\r\nand John Sherman, of Ohio. There being a deadlock, the supporters of\r\nthese two candidates united and thereby nominated James A. Garfield, of\r\nOhio, with Chester A. Arthur, of New York, as the nominee for\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANT IN JAPAN.]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Convention, which met in Cincinnati in the latter part of\r\nJune, placed in nomination General Winfield S. Hancock, of New York, and\r\nWilliam H. English, of Indiana. The prospect of Hancock's election was\r\nexcellent, but he destroyed it by one of those unfortunate expressions\r\nwhich more than once have defeated candidates for high office. When\r\nquestioned concerning the tariff he expressed the opinion that it was a\r\n\"local issue,\" a remark which many accepted as displaying ignorance of\r\nthe important subject, and they, therefore, voted against him. The\r\nresult was as follows: James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, 214\r\nelectoral votes; W.S. Hancock and W.H. English, 155; James B. Weaver and\r\nB.J. Chambers, the Greenback candidates, received 307,306 popular votes;\r\nNeal Dow and H.A. Thompson, the Prohibition, 10,305; and John W. Phelps\r\nand S.C. Pomeroy, American, 707; but none of the three secured an\r\nelectoral vote.\r\n\r\nJames A. Garfield was born at Orange, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, November\r\n19, 1831. While he was an infant his father died and he was left to the\r\ncare of his noble mother, to whom he was devotedly attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOY JAMES GARFIELD BRINGING HIS FIRST DAY'S EARNINGS\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.]\r\n\r\nGarfield spent his boyhood in the backwoods, and at one time was the\r\ndriver of a canal-boat. He became strong, rugged, and a fine athlete,\r\nand at the same time obtained the rudiments of an English education. At\r\nthe age of seventeen he attended the high school at Chester, and by hard\r\nstudy acquired an excellent knowledge of Latin, Greek, and algebra. He\r\nwas a student at Hiram College, and became an instructor in 1854. The\r\nsame year he entered Williams College, from which he was graduated with\r\nhonor in 1856. He returned to Ohio, and was appointed a professor in\r\nHiram College. He indulged his taste for politics and law, and served\r\nfor a time in the State Senate, but was president of the college when\r\nthe war broke out. He at once volunteered, and was appointed\r\nlieutenant-colonel and afterward colonel of the Forty-second Regiment of\r\nOhio Volunteers.\r\n\r\nGarfield displayed remarkable ability in the military service, and had\r\nhe remained would have won high distinction. As a brigadier-general he\r\ndid fine work in Kentucky and Tennessee. He was chief-of-staff to\r\nGeneral Rosecrans, and showed great gallantry in the tremendous battle\r\nof Chickamauga. He was in the field when elected to Congress in 1862.\r\nHis desire was to remain, but, at the personal request of President\r\nLincoln, he entered Congress, where it was felt his help was needed in\r\nthe important legislation before the country. The estimate in which he\r\nwas held by his fellow-citizens is shown by the fact that he served as a\r\nmember of Congress for seventeen years. In 1879 he was chosen United\r\nStates senator, but did not take his seat because of his nomination for\r\nthe presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\nThe question of \"civil service reform,\" as it is termed, assumed\r\nprominence during the term of Hayes. This, as all understand, means that\r\nthe public offices should be filled not in accordance with politics, but\r\nbe determined by fitness. The charge has been made with reason that,\r\nwhen public servants have become skilled in the discharge of their\r\nduties, they are turned out to make room for the friends of the new\r\nadministration, where politics are different. In that way public service\r\nis injured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES A. GARFIELD (1831-1881.) One partial term, 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe opponents of civil service reform maintain, on the other hand, that\r\nthere are thousands out of office who are just as capable as those in\r\noffice, and that the party ought to reward those that have helped it to\r\nsuccess. \"To the victor belong the spoils\" was the policy of Andrew\r\nJackson, and it has been followed in a greater or less degree ever\r\nsince. The cry of civil service reform was long a well-sounding motto\r\nwith which to catch votes, but no serious effort was made to enforce it.\r\nHayes tried his hand, but the clamor for political rewards was so\r\ninsistent that he gave it up, and matters dropped back into their old\r\nruts. The vexatious question was inherited by Garfield, and the hope was\r\ngeneral that he would not only make a determined effort, but would\r\nsucceed in carrying out the principles of real civil service reform.\r\n\r\nThe task soon proved beyond the capacity of himself or any human being.\r\nIt seemed as if nearly every man in the country had been the deciding\r\nfactor in the election of the President, while the \"original Garfield\r\nman\" would have formed a full regiment. The executive threw up his\r\nhands, and decided to pass over the plague to the next administration.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel produced a split in the Republican party itself, and two\r\nwings were formed, known as \"Half-breeds\" and \"Stalwarts.\" At the head\r\nof the latter was the brilliant New York senator, Roscoe Conkling, who\r\nhad been so persistent in his efforts to renominate General Grant for a\r\nthird term. The leader of the Half-breeds was James G. Blaine, as\r\nbrilliant as Conkling, while both were strong personal opponents. The\r\nStalwarts claimed the right of dividing the offices, as had been the\r\ncustom for a century, the senators and representatives apportioning the\r\nplums among the horde of claimants. The President was supported by the\r\nHalf-breeds in his claim that it was his province to bestow these gifts\r\nas he saw fit.\r\n\r\nThe collectorship of the port of New York is one of the best offices at\r\nthe disposal of the administration. The President nominated Judge\r\nWilliam Robertson. He was personally distasteful to Conkling, and, when\r\nhe found himself unable to prevent his confirmation by the Senate, he\r\nand Thomas C. Platt, the junior senator from New York, resigned their\r\nseats. Both afterward sought and failed to secure a re-election from the\r\nLegislature. Congress adjourned in June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AGED MOTHER OF PRESIDENT GARFIELD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT GARFIELD.\r\n\r\nRelieved from the pressure of his duties, the President now made his\r\narrangements for placing his two sons in Williams College and joining\r\nhis invalid wife at the seashore. On the 2d of July, 1881, accompanied\r\nby Secretary Blaine and several friends, he rode to the Baltimore\r\nRailroad station to board the cars. He had just entered the building and\r\nwas chatting with his secretary, when a miscreant named Charles Julias\r\nGuiteau stepped up behind him and shot him with a pistol in the back.\r\nThe wounded President sank to the floor and was carried to the executive\r\nmansion, while the assassin was hurried to prison before he could be\r\nlynched, as he assuredly would have been but for such prompt action by\r\nthe authorities.\r\n\r\nThe shock to the country was scarcely less than when Abraham Lincoln was\r\nshot in Ford's Theatre. Although the wound of the President was severe,\r\nit was not believed to be necessarily fatal. He received the best\r\nmedical attention, and prayers for his recovery were sent up from every\r\nquarter of the land and across the sea. Daily bulletins of his condition\r\nwere issued and messages of sympathy were received from many crowned\r\nheads on the other side of the Atlantic. The sufferer was removed on the\r\n6th of September to Elberon, New Jersey, where it was hoped the\r\ninvigorating sea-air would bring back strength to his wasted frame.\r\nThese hopes were vain, and, on the 19th of September, he quietly\r\nbreathed his last. It may be noted that this date was the anniversary of\r\nthe battle of Chickamauga, where General Garfield performed his most\r\nbrilliant service in the war. Amid universal expressions of sympathy the\r\nremains were borne to Cleveland, where a fine monument has been erected\r\nto his memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT GARFIELD.]\r\n\r\nGuiteau was a miserable \"crank,\" who had long dogged the President for\r\nan appointment, failing to obtain which he shot him. That his brain was\r\npartly awry, with perhaps a taint of insanity, cannot be questioned,\r\nbut, none the less, it was shown that he clearly knew the difference\r\nbetween right and wrong and was morally responsible for his unspeakable\r\ncrime. He was given a fair trial, and, having been found guilty, was\r\nhanged on the 30th of June, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-FIRST PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nChester Alan Arthur, who was immediately sworn in as President, was born\r\nin Vermont, October 5, 1830. He received his education at Union College,\r\nfrom which he was graduated in 1849. He taught school for a time in his\r\nnative State, and then removed to the City of New York, where he studied\r\nlaw and was admitted to the bar. His ability speedily brought him to the\r\nfront and gave him a lucrative practice. He was quartermaster-general of\r\nthe State of New York during the war and displayed fine executive\r\nability. When the war ended, he resumed the practice of law and was made\r\ncollector of customs for the port of New York in 1871. Seven years later\r\nhe was removed by President Hayes, and shortly after he entered the\r\npresidential canvass of 1880. He died November 18, 1886.\r\n\r\nArthur took the oath of office in New York, on the day succeeding the\r\ndeath of Garfield, and left at once for Washington. Chief Justice Waite\r\nadministered the oath again to him in the vice-president's room. Among\r\nthose present were General Grant, General Sherman, Senator Sherman, and\r\nex-President Hayes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TABLET IN THE WAITING-ROOM OF THE RAILWAY STATION WHERE\r\nGARFIELD WAS SHOT.]\r\n\r\nWhile President Arthur showed slight disposition to change the policy of\r\nthe administration, he inherited many vexatious matters from his\r\npredecessor. One of the worst of these was the \"Star Route Frauds.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapid settlement of the West naturally created a demand for improved\r\nmail facilities. In a number of places, fast mail routes had been\r\norganized by the postoffice department, and these were designated on the\r\nofficial documents by the figures of stars. The authorized expenditures\r\nof the postoffice department were clearly defined, but a clause in the\r\nlaw permitted it to \"expedite\" such routes as proved to be inefficient.\r\nThis opened the door for fraud, and, as is always the case, it lost no\r\ntime in entering.\r\n\r\nThe contracts were let at the legal rates, and then, availing themselves\r\nof the legal authority, the same routes were \"expedited\" at immense\r\nprofits. The money thus stolen--and it amounted to immense sums--was\r\ndivided among the parties letting the contracts and the contractors.\r\nStephen W. Dorsey, John W. Dorsey, and Thomas J. Brady--formerly\r\nsecond-assistant postmaster-general--were indicted for a conspiracy to\r\ndefraud the government and enrich themselves. All were prominent\r\npoliticians, and their trial attracted national attention. Although the\r\ntestimony seemed to establish the guilt of the parties accused, all\r\nthree escaped, the miscarriage of justice causing a qualm of disgust and\r\nindignation among right-minded citizens.\r\n\r\nOne of the famous structures in the country is the Brooklyn Bridge,\r\nwhich was completed and opened for traffic May 24, 1883. Operations on\r\nit were begun January 3, 1870, and the towers were finished six years\r\nlater. The first wire reaching from tower to tower was strung August 14,\r\n1876. Each of the four cables contains 5,296 wires, untwisted, lying\r\nstraight, and held in place by other wires coiled tightly around them.\r\nThe length of the main span is 1,595-1/2 feet; the two land spans are\r\n930 feet each; the masonry approach on the New York side is 1,562 feet\r\nlong, and that on the Brooklyn side 971 feet. The total distance,\r\ntherefore, is about 6,000 feet, or more than a mile. The middle of the\r\nmain span is about 135 feet above the water in summer, and in winter,\r\nowing to the contraction caused by cold, it is three feet more. The\r\nheight is such that nearly any ship can pass under the bridge without\r\nlowering its top-mast. Twenty persons were killed during the\r\nconstruction of the bridge. Although the day was inclement and\r\nunfavorable, the opening of the structure to travel was attended with\r\nmany ceremonies, including civic and military processions, oratory,\r\nsalutes by naval vessels, and illuminations and fireworks in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTER ALAN ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n(1830-1886.) One partial term, 1881-1885.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE.\r\n\r\nThe State of California, on account of its situation, received thousands\r\nof Chinese immigrants every year from across the Pacific. These people\r\nlive so meanly that they could afford to work for wages upon which a\r\nwhite man would starve. Consequently they crowded out other laborers and\r\ncaused so much discontent that something in the nature of a revolt took\r\nplace against them. The grievance of the Californians was so\r\nwell-founded that Congress, while Hayes was President, passed a bill\r\nwhich forbade the immigration of Chinese laborers to this country, and\r\nrequiring those already here to take out certificates, if they left the\r\nUnited States, so as to identify themselves before being allowed to\r\nreturn. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but it was passed in 1882. The\r\namazing ingenuity of the Chinese has enabled them to evade the law in\r\nmany instances, but their immigration was substantially checked.\r\nProbably there is no more degraded community on the face of the earth\r\nthan the part in San Francisco known as \"Chinatown.\" Most of the yellow\r\ncelestials live underground, where their unspeakable villainies are a\r\nflaming reproach to the authorities that permit them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORMONS.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons proved a thorn in the side of the body politic. Their\r\npolygamous practices led to the passage in 1882 of Senator Edmunds' bill\r\nwhich excluded polygamists from holding office. A good many persons\r\nwere convicted and sentenced for violation of the law, which was upheld\r\nby the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nWhile this legislation did much to abate the crime, it cannot be said\r\nthat it effectually ended it, for, at this writing, one of the\r\nrepresentatives from the new State of Utah is the husband of several\r\nwives, and it is apparent that still more severe legislation will be\r\nrequired to stamp out the evil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN CHINATOWN, SAN FRANCISCO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF ALASKA.\r\n\r\nAttention was so generally directed toward Alaska, our recent purchase\r\nfrom Russia, that an exploring expedition visited that country in 1883,\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka. It should be stated\r\nthat the party, which was a small one, went thither without authority\r\nfrom the government, its departure from Portland, Oregon, May 22d, being\r\nsecret. It was gone for several months, and brought back interesting and\r\nvaluable information. One bit of knowledge was new. The explorers\r\nlearned that the length of the great river Yukon is 2,044 miles, which\r\nmakes it the third in length in the United States, the fourth in North\r\nAmerica, the seventh in the western hemisphere, and the seventeenth in\r\nthe world. The area drained by this immense stream is 200,000 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YORKTOWN CENTENNIAL.\r\n\r\nWe have learned of the centennial celebration of the birth of our\r\nrepublic in Philadelphia. Many other celebrations of important events\r\nwere held in different parts of the country, the most important of which\r\nwas the commemoration of the great victory at Yorktown, which brought\r\nthe Revolution to a close and secured the independence of our country.\r\n\r\nAs was befitting, preparations were made on a grand scale for this\r\ncelebration. Thousands journeyed thither days before the exercises\r\nopened. President Arthur arrived at ten o'clock on the morning of\r\nOctober 18, 1881, in a government steamer, his approach being announced\r\nby salute after salute, each of twenty-one guns, from the different\r\nships of the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe exercises were opened with prayer by Rev. Robert Nelson, grandson of\r\nGovernor Nelson, who commanded the Virginia militia at Yorktown and\r\ndirected the fire so as to destroy his own home, in which Cornwallis had\r\nhis headquarters, after which Governor Holliday, of Virginia, made the\r\naddress. At its conclusion, the sword was held up to view which was\r\npresented to the horseman who rode at high speed to Philadelphia with\r\nthe news of the surrender of Cornwallis. Another interesting fact was\r\nthat W.W. Henry, the grandson of Patrick Henry, was sitting at that\r\nmoment on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe corner-stone of the monument was laid with Masonic ceremonies. The\r\nchair in which the Grand Master for the occasion sat was one that had\r\nbeen used by Washington when he was Grand Master of the Virginia Masons.\r\nThe sash and apron were presented to him at Mount Vernon in 1784, and\r\nhad been worked by Mrs. Lafayette. The gavel was made from a portion of\r\nthe quarter-deck of the United States frigate _Lawrence_, flagship of\r\nCommodore Perry, when he won his great victory on Lake Erie in\r\nSeptember, 1813. Space cannot be given to enumerate the notables who\r\nwere present nor the eloquent addresses that were made. Among the guests\r\nwere descendants of Rochambeau, Steuben, and many German and French\r\nfriends. The centennial ode was written by Paul H. Hayne, the Southern\r\npoet (who died in 1886), and the oration of the day was by Robert C.\r\nWinthrop.\r\n\r\nIt was a graceful tribute to the friendly course of England, when\r\nSecretary Blaine, at the reception which followed the ceremonies, read\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n   \"In recognition of the friendly relations so long and so happily\r\n   existing between Great Britain and the United States, in the trust\r\n   and confidence of  peace and good-will between the two countries for\r\n   all centuries to come, and especially as a mark of the profound\r\n   respect entertained by the American people for the illustrious\r\n   sovereign and gracious lady who sits upon the British throne, it is\r\n   hereby ordered that at the close of these services, commemorative of\r\n   the valor and success of our forefathers in their patriotic struggle\r\n   for independence, the British flag shall be saluted by the forces of\r\n   the army and navy of the United States now at Yorktown. The secretary\r\n   of war and the secretary of the navy will give orders accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"CHESTER A. ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n  \"By the PRESIDENT.\r\n  \"JAMES G. BLAINE, Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\nThe final ceremonies of Yorktown occurred on the 20th of October, at\r\nwhich time 9,000 sailors, regulars, and militia made an impressive\r\nspectacle. They were under the command of General Hancock, and\r\nrepresented all of the thirteen original States, including a number of\r\nothers. They passed in review before the President, both branches of\r\nCongress, governors of the States and their staffs, and the French and\r\nGerman guests of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS TO REACH THE NORTH POLE.\r\n\r\nOne of these days the North Pole will be reached, but no one can say\r\nwhen. For hundreds of years the attempt has been made again and again,\r\nand daring navigators have penetrated far into those icy regions, where\r\nthe temperature for months at a time registers forty, fifty, and sixty\r\ndegrees below zero, only to perish or be turned back disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe first American expedition into the Arctic regions was conducted by\r\nDr. Elisha Kent Kane. He sailed from New York in the steamer _Advance_,\r\nMay 30, 1853. He reached Smith Strait, as far as Cape George Russell,\r\nand then returned to Van Rensselaer Harbor for the winter. A number of\r\nexcursions were made from that point, and 125 miles of coast were traced\r\nto the north and east. Two of the men penetrated to Washington Land in\r\nlatitude 82 deg. 27', and discovered an open channel, which they named\r\nKennedy. Kane came home in 1855, having been further north than any\r\nother explorer. He was obliged to abandon his ship and proceed overland\r\nto the Danish settlements in the south, where he was met by a relief\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this expedition was Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, who, in\r\n1860, attained 81 deg. 35' north latitude, when he was forced to return\r\nwithout having accomplished anything of importance. Sir John Franklin,\r\nan English navigator, had been lost in the Arctic regions a number of\r\nyears before, and several expeditions had been sent in search of him,\r\nbut all failed to secure any definite information. In 1860, Dr. Charles\r\nF. Hall, of Connecticut, led an expedition in quest of the lost\r\nexplorer. He was unfortunate enough to lose his boat and was obliged to\r\nreturn. The most interesting discoveries made by Dr. Hall were a number\r\nof relics of Frobisher's expedition to those dismal regions fully 300\r\nyears before. A second party, under Hall, found the same year several\r\nrelics of Franklin, and dissipated all possible hope that he or any of\r\nhis men were still living.\r\n\r\nDr. Hall was an enthusiastic explorer of those inhospitable regions and\r\nspent five years among the Eskemos. Coming home, he organized a third\r\nparty, for, cheerless and dismal as are those frozen solitudes, they\r\nseemed to hold a resistless fascination to all who have visited them.\r\nThis expedition reached 80 deg. north latitude, where Hall died.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREELY EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the proposal was made by an international polar commission that\r\nthe leading countries should unite in establishing meteorological\r\nstations in the polar region. This was with no intention of helping\r\nexplorations toward the North Pole, but to permit the study of weather\r\nphenomena and the actions of the magnetic needle, respecting which much\r\nremains to be learned.\r\n\r\nCongress appropriated funds with which to establish a scientific colony\r\nfor Americans, one at Point Barrow in Alaska and the other at Lady\r\nFranklin Bay in Grinnell Land. These stations were to be occupied for\r\nperiods varying from one to three years.\r\n\r\nThe party designed for Lady Franklin Bay consisted of First Lieutenant\r\nAdolphus W. Greely, U.S.A., Commander; Lieutenants F.S. Kislingbury and\r\nJames B. Lockwood, U.S.A., as assistants; and Dr. O. Pavy as surgeon and\r\nnaturalist. In addition, there were twenty-two sergeants, corporals, and\r\nprivates, all belonging to the army, and two Eskemos. All the other\r\nattempts to establish circumpolar stations, numbering about a dozen,\r\nwere successful.\r\n\r\nThe steamer _Proteus_ conveyed the expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, the\r\nstart being made from the harbor of St. John's, Newfoundland. It would\r\nseem that every needed precaution had been taken to avert disaster.\r\nSince the expedition had an attainable point fixed upon as its\r\ndestination, it would seem that it had only to establish a base, where\r\nthe government would deposit abundant supplies, to which Greely could\r\nreturn when he chose or when he found himself compelled to retreat. Then\r\nhe could carry forward supplies on his sleds and leave them at different\r\npoints along his route, so that he would be sure of finding them on his\r\nreturn. This scheme is so simple that it would seem that there was no\r\npossible, or at least probable, way of going wrong. Yet misfortune has\r\nbeen the fate of most of the Arctic expeditions.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that two ships were to go to Lady Franklin Bay in the\r\nsummer of 1883 to bring back the explorers. These ships were to be the\r\nsteam whaler _Proteus_ and the United States gunboat _Yantic_, commanded\r\nby Lieutenant E.A. Garlington; but the _Proteus_, when near Cape Sabine\r\nand before she had landed her supplies, was crushed by the ice and sunk.\r\nWith great difficulty, Garlington and his men escaped from the wreck in\r\nsmall boats and made their way to Upernavik, where they had left the\r\n_Yantic_. The party then returned to the United States, without having\r\nleft an ounce of supplies at Lady Franklin Bay, where Greely expected to\r\nfind all he needed on his return.\r\n\r\nNow let us follow the exploring party under Greely which left St.\r\nJohn's, Newfoundland, July 7, 1881, in the _Proteus_, that was afterward\r\nlost. Icebergs were soon encountered, but seven hundred miles were\r\npassed without any land appearing. The days had lengthened, light\r\nappearing shortly after midnight and lasting until ten o'clock the\r\nsucceeding night, but the fog was dense and all-pervading. On July 16th,\r\nthe _Proteus_ was steaming cautiously through the mist, when the icy\r\ncoast of Disco Island, several hundred feet in height, loomed up\r\ndirectly ahead.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting sight was a vast iceberg in two parts, joined by an\r\nimmense overhanging arch, under which it would have been easy for the\r\nship to sail. The captain was too wise to make any such attempt. He\r\nsteamed to one side of it, and, when some distance beyond, fired a\r\nsignal gun for a pilot. The report was followed by a thunderous\r\nrumbling, and, looking back, the crew saw the vast arch, weighing\r\nthousands of tons, descend to the water with a crash that caused the\r\nsteamer to rock to and fro for several minutes. Had she been caught\r\nbeneath the mass, she would have been crushed like a tiny insect.\r\n\r\nA landing was made at the settlement of Disco. In this squalid town all\r\nthe dwellings were mere huts, with the exception of those of the\r\ninspector and governor. It was a strange sight to find in one of these\r\ndwellings in the North a piano, billiard table, carpets, and many of the\r\nluxuries of civilized life. The visitors were treated with the utmost\r\nhospitality and took part in a dance in progress.\r\n\r\nReturning to the _Proteus_ the party steamed through the fog to\r\nUpernavik, which was reached on the 23d of July. They were never out of\r\nsight of icebergs, but they caused no trouble, and were easily avoided.\r\nBy means of the steam launch, several men made a passage through inner\r\nwaters to Proven, a sparse settlement, where they procured some clothing\r\nsuitable for the high latitudes.\r\n\r\nThese settlements, far beyond the Arctic Circle, belong to Denmark,\r\nwhich exercises a nominal control over them. One of the industries of\r\nProven is the furnishing of supplies to Arctic explorers. A liberal\r\nquantity of fresh food was secured, beside two native guides and\r\nthirty-two Eskemo dogs. It was near here that McClintock, the explorer,\r\nwas frozen in for an entire year; but the weather continued unusually\r\nmild. A mountainous iceberg while drifting slowly with the current\r\nsloughed off so much from one side that its centre of gravity was\r\ndisplaced and the mountain of ice turned a complete somersault before it\r\nsettled to rest.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any limit to the time in which provisions can be\r\npreserved in the polar regions. A cache was found among the Gary Islands\r\nwhich had been left by Sir George Nares years before, and nearly all was\r\nin as good condition as when placed there. One of the strange phenomena\r\nof the Arctic regions is the red snow, mentioned by Sir John Ross, which\r\nwas seen by the Greely party. This color is found to be due to myriads\r\nof tiny plants deposited on the crust. That most eminent botanist,\r\nRobert Brown, subjected it to careful examination and pronounced it to\r\nbe a unicellular plant of the order _Algae_, and Dr. Greville, of\r\nEdinburgh, gave it its name (_Protococcus nivalis_), by which it is now\r\nknown to the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe steamer halted at Littleton Island on the 2d of August. A number of\r\narticles were found at \"Life-Boat Cove,\" that had been left by the\r\nPolaris expedition in 1873. A quantity of coal was unloaded here to be\r\ntaken aboard on the return.\r\n\r\nSteaming up Kennedy Channel, a deposit of provisions was made near\r\nFranklin Island and Carl Ritter Bay. A short distance north, an immense\r\nice pack stopped the ship which repeatedly tried in vain to butt its way\r\nthrough. It was compelled to drift with the pack until the 11th of\r\nAugust, when an opening appeared and the _Proteus_ forced a passage to\r\nBellot Island, at the entrance to Discovery Harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT LADY FRANKLIN BAY.\r\n\r\nThe steamer had now reached Lady Franklin Bay, which was its\r\ndestination, and near which Fort Conger, a signal station, was to be\r\nestablished. The ship was unloaded and a house built, the men living in\r\ntents the meanwhile, and on the 19th of August, the _Proteus_ bade the\r\nexplorers good-by and started on her return to Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nA number of musk oxen were shot in the vicinity, and now and then a\r\nptarmigan was bagged. The men moved into the house in the latter part of\r\nAugust, and Lockwood directed the laying out of the observatory and the\r\ndigging of the foundation pier for the transit. The earth was frozen so\r\nhard that it was like chipping solid ice. The house gave the men\r\ncomfortable quarters. On the first Sunday all work was stopped and\r\nreligious services held. The intention was to send an exploring\r\nexpedition along the northern coast of Greenland, and it was placed in\r\ncharge of Lockwood. It would have been given to Kislingbury, the senior\r\nofficer, but for the fact that he and Greely were not on good terms.\r\n\r\nMen were sent to examine St. Patrick's Bay to the northeast, for a site\r\nto establish a depot on the channel of exploration. Such a place was\r\nfound and the exploring parties were continually active, some of them\r\ngoing a good many miles from camp. Game was plentiful, but the wolves\r\nwere fierce. Numbers were poisoned by means of arsenic mixed with meat\r\nthrown in their way. It being the beginning of their Arctic experience,\r\nthe men enjoyed themselves to an extent that would hardly be supposed.\r\nThis was mainly because they were kept busy and the novelty of their\r\nlife had not yet worn off. One pleasant custom was that of celebrating\r\nthe birthdays of different members of the party, which was done with a\r\nvigor that sometimes reached good-natured boisterousness.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun sank far from sight on the 16th of October, every one knew\r\nthat it would not show itself again for four months. It will be\r\nadmitted, too, that the weather had become keen, for it registered forty\r\ndegrees below zero most of the time and the moisture within the house\r\nwas frozen to the depth of an inch on the window-panes.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the long, dismal night the wolves became fiercer, and\r\nprowled so closely around the building that no one dared venture far\r\nfrom the door without firearms in his hands, and the men generally went\r\nin company, ready for an attack that was liable to be made at any\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTOLERABLE LONELINESS.\r\n\r\nTime always hangs heavy when one is forced to remain idle and the dismal\r\nnight stretches through a third or half of the year. On the 1st of\r\nNovember, Lieutenant Lockwood, accompanied by seven men, left the\r\ndwelling to try the passage of the straits, hoping to push his way to\r\nthe place where Captain Hall made his winter quarters. They dragged a\r\nheavily loaded sled after them, upon which rested a boat, which they\r\nexpected to use in case they reached open water. The men set out bravely\r\nand toiled hard, but were compelled to turn back, finding it impossible\r\nto make any progress.\r\n\r\nNo one can describe the horrible loneliness of such a life as the party\r\nwere now compelled to lead. They played cards and games, told stories,\r\nand held discussions until all such things palled on their taste. Then\r\nthey grew weary of one another's company, and hours would pass without a\r\nman speaking a word. Dr. Hayes has related that, when thus placed, he\r\nhas dashed out of the dwelling in desperation and wandered for miles\r\nthrough the frozen solitudes, for no other reason than that the company\r\nof his friends had become unbearable. He stated further that a rooster\r\non his ship deliberately flew overboard and committed suicide out of\r\nsheer loneliness.\r\n\r\nOne means resorted to by the explorers for relieving the frightful\r\nmonotony was the publication of a paper called the _Arctic Moon_. The\r\ncontents were written and copies made by the hektograph process. Then\r\nGreely formed a class in arithmetic, and Lockwood taught a class in\r\ngeography and grammar. Matters were quite lively on Thanksgiving Day\r\n(the party being careful to note the passage of the regular days), when\r\nfoot-races were run and shooting matches indulged in, Greely\r\ndistributing the prizes.\r\n\r\nOne of the many curious facts regarding life in the Arctic regions is\r\nthat its rigors are often withstood better by the inexperienced than by\r\nthe experienced. The two Eskemo guides were the most depressed of the\r\nwhole party, and one of them wandered off in a dazed condition. When\r\nfound miles away, he was running as if in fear of his life, and it was\r\nwith great difficulty he was persuaded to return. The second native\r\nwould have run off had he not been closely watched.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of February, the thermometer fell to sixty-five degrees\r\nbelow zero, an intensity of cold which few living men have experienced.\r\nAt such a terrible temperature pure brandy and glycerine freeze hard,\r\nand a man, though heavily clothed, will perish in a few minutes. The\r\nEskemo dogs by choice slept in the snow outside rather than within the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE OF DR. HALL.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of February, Lieutenant Lockwood, accompanied by\r\nBrainard, Jewell, Long, the two Eskemos, and a couple of dog teams,\r\nstarted on a journey to Thank God Harbor, seventy-five miles away. The\r\njourney was made without accident and the observatory was found still\r\nstanding, while near at hand was the grave of the Arctic explorer,\r\nCaptain C.F. Hall. The grave was marked by a metallic headboard, put up\r\nby the English and the other by Hall's comrades. On the British board\r\nare these words: \"To Captain Hall, who sacrificed his life in the\r\nadvancement of science, November 8, 1871. This tablet has been erected\r\nby the British Polar Expedition of 1875, which followed in his footsteps\r\nand profited by his experience.\" The American inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n  IN MEMORY OF\r\n  CHARLES FRANCIS HALL,\r\n  LATE COMMANDER U.S. STEAMER POLARIS, NORTH POLE EXPEDITION,\r\n  DIED NOVEMBER 8, 1871.\r\n  \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE; HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME,\r\n  THOUGH HE WERE DEAD, YET SHALL HE LIVE.\"\r\n\r\nThe great ambition of Lieutenant Lockwood was to lead an expedition\r\nalong the northern coast of Greenland, to which Arctic explorers\r\nhitherto had paid comparatively slight attention. His intelligence,\r\ndaring, and skill caused Greely to give him his full confidence and to\r\nleave the entire arrangement of the venture in his hands.\r\n\r\nLockwood's intention was to start about the 1st of April. Sergeant\r\nBrainard was to go with the supporting parties in advance to Cape Sumner\r\nand leave supplies. Then when Lockwood's party reached the same point,\r\nwith all the provisions they could carry with comfort, the explorers\r\nwould be well supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKWOOD'S EXPEDITION TO THE FAR NORTH.\r\n\r\nAmid the firing of pistols, waving of flags, and cheers, the start was\r\nmade by Lockwood on the 2d of April. Three days later, the party\r\ndragging a sled laden with pemmican reached a snow-house, where they\r\nfound Brainard and his friends returning. There were thirteen in all,\r\nand they were crowded in their close quarters, but the fact gave them\r\nadditional warmth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FUNERAL IN THE ARTIC REGIONS.]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the long Arctic night was about ended. In the\r\nmisty light, a dark object was discerned on the top of a neighboring\r\niceberg, which being scrutinized was recognized as an eagle. It was\r\naccepted as a good omen by the men, who cheered the noble bird that\r\nvividly reminded them of their distant home.\r\n\r\nThe direction was now to the northeast. They crossed the straits at Cape\r\nBeechy, pushing to within a few miles of the eastern shore, whence they\r\nwere to proceed directly to Fort Sumner. In order to follow the course\r\nof the party intelligently the reader needs to keep a reliable map of\r\nthe Arctic regions before him.\r\n\r\nFort Conger stood close to the intersection of sixty-fifth meridian and\r\nthe eighty-second parallel, being a little south of the latter and east\r\nof the former. From this starting-point, the route of Lockwood was\r\nslightly south of northeast to its termination. Almost from the\r\nbeginning, the traveling was so difficult that the bravest explorers\r\ncould not have been blamed for turning back.\r\n\r\nThe ice was tumbled together in irregular masses many feet in thickness,\r\nthrough which they often had to cut the way with axes for their sledges.\r\nThe wind rose to a hurricane, and was of piercing coldness, and so\r\nfilled with fine particles that they cut the face like bird-shot. Most\r\nof the time they could not see one another when separated by a few feet.\r\nMuffled to their eyes, the brave explorers fought their-way onward,\r\noften compelled to stop and turn their backs to the gale, which almost\r\nswept them off their feet. Frequently they crouched behind the piles of\r\nice to regain their breath while the furious wind roared above their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nToughened, as were all the men, some of them succumbed under the fearful\r\nwork. These returned to camp, and the party was reduced to nine. This\r\noccurred on the 10th of April, very near where the 82d parallel crosses\r\nthe 60th meridian. There Lieutenant Lockwood came to a halt, and turned\r\nback with the dogs to Fort Conger. The round journey was a hundred\r\nmiles, but it was necessary to get supplies that could be obtained in no\r\nother way, and to secure new runners for their sledges, which were\r\nbattered by their rough usage.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the two Eskemos, Lockwood made a new start on the 14th of\r\nApril, and averaged two miles an hour until he reached his new camp.\r\nFrom that point the nine men had three sledges, which they dragged, and\r\na fourth that was drawn by the dogs. With indomitable pluck they\r\nstruggled onward, and all were thrilled on the 25th of the month by the\r\nknowledge that they had reached a point further north than had ever been\r\nattained by an American, and they hoped to surpass all others.\r\n\r\nThe heroic explorers had by no means finished their task. At regular\r\npoints they cached their provisions against the return. If the reader\r\nwill locate on his map the intersection of the 55th meridian with the\r\nparallel of 82 deg. 20', he will have a point close to Cape Bryant, where\r\nthe supports of the party withdrew and started on their return to camp.\r\nAll who were now left were Lieutenant Lockwood, Sergeant Brainard, and\r\nthe Eskemo Frederick.\r\n\r\nLockwood apportioned rations for twenty-five days among the three.\r\nConsequently the northward journey and the return must be made within\r\nthat time, since they believed it impossible to obtain food in that\r\nfearful region. Shaking hands with their companions, who wished them\r\ngood-speed, the little party broke into two divisions, one tramping\r\nsouthward, while the other resumed its laborious journey toward the\r\nnortheast.\r\n\r\nBefore Lockwood left Cape Sabine, Lieutenant Greely gave it as his\r\nbelief that his brave assistant might succeed in reaching Cape\r\nBritannia, which lies about 40 deg. east and 82 deg. 45' north. The\r\nexplorer Beaumont saw this cape, but was unable to reach it. When\r\nLockwood and Brainard arrived there, however, they had no thought of\r\nstopping. A cairn was built, a written account of their travels\r\ndeposited, and five days' rations left. Then the heroes bent to their\r\nherculean task again.\r\n\r\nThe Eskemo was left with the dogs, while the two white men, wrapped in\r\ntheir furs, laboriously climbed an adjoining mountain, half a mile in\r\nheight. From the crest they scanned the snowy landscape, the very\r\npicture of desolation. Twenty miles to the northeast, the direction they\r\nwere traveling, they made out a dark promontory, terminating in a rocky\r\nheadland and penetrating the Polar Ocean, while between it and them a\r\nnumber of islands reared their heads and were separated by fiords. Half\r\nof the remaining horizon was filled with the dismal ice of the Frozen\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThey had no expectation of meeting with animal life in this world of\r\ndesolation, but they fired several times (and missed) at ptarmigan, and,\r\nhaving wounded a rabbit, succeeded in running it down. It was a mystery\r\nto them how this little animal found the means of sustaining life so\r\nnear the Pole.\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered how far these three men would have gone had it been\r\npossible to travel. They became accustomed to the exhaustive work, but\r\nthe end of the journey was reached on the 13th of May, when they paused\r\non the edge of an immense fissure in the ice, extending indefinitely to\r\nthe right and left, and too broad to be crossed. They searched for a\r\nlong time, only to learn that it was utterly out of their power to go a\r\nfoot further. Nothing remained but to learn their exact location.\r\n\r\nWhile Lockwood was preparing to take an observation, the sun was\r\nobscured by fog. All the next day so furious a storm raged that they\r\ncould do nothing but huddle in their tent and wait for it to pass.\r\nFinally, the conditions became favorable and Lockwood made his\r\nobservations with the utmost care. When they were completed the\r\nastounding truth was revealed that their latitude was 84 deg. 24-1/2'\r\nnorth and 40 deg. 46-1/2' west from Greenwich. This surpassed the\r\nachievement of the Nares expedition sent out by England, in 1875-76,\r\nfor the sole purpose of reaching the furthest northern point possible.\r\nLockwood and Brainard, therefore, had attained the highest point, which\r\nup to that time had never been reached by man. On the 7th of April,\r\n1895, however, Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, penetrated\r\nto 86 deg. 15', which surpassed that of Lockwood and Brainard by 200\r\nmiles and was within 225 miles of the Pole itself.\r\n\r\nThe return journey was as exhausting and trying as the outward one, but\r\nthe little party never lost courage. Fort Conger was reached early in\r\nJune, and, as may be supposed, the explorers received a royal welcome\r\nfrom their comrades. The three men were suffering from snow blindness,\r\nrheumatism, and various ills brought on by their exposure and terrific\r\nlabors, but all were in high spirits, as they might well be, when they\r\nrecalled the wonderful achievement they had made.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEARY WAITING.\r\n\r\nThe brief summer was at hand. The snow melted during the middle of the\r\nday and the first rain they had seen fell. On the 4th of July they had\r\nshooting matches and engaged in a game of baseball. It can hardly be\r\nsaid, however, that the American game has gained much of a foothold\r\nnorth of the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nAll suffered from intense depression of spirits which could not be\r\nshaken off. Again hours would pass without a man speaking a word. They\r\nseemed mutually repellent and miserable. This sad condition resulted\r\nfrom purely physical causes and no one could be blamed for it.\r\n\r\nThe company were now waiting for the _Proteus_ which was due. Several\r\nreports that she was in sight threw all into pleasurable excitement, but\r\nit need not be said they were doomed to disappointment, since the relief\r\nship was at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. The little steam launch had\r\nbeen repaired and enabled the party to explore the neighboring coasts\r\nfor a distance of several hundred miles. A number of musk oxen were\r\nshot, but, except at certain seasons, their flesh is so strongly\r\nimpregnated with musk that it is unpalatable for food.\r\n\r\nAs the weary days passed without bringing the wished-for steamer, hope\r\nsank. Many were sure some accident had befallen the ship and she would\r\nnever be seen again. If so (and of course such was the fact), more\r\nmonths must pass before the news could be carried to the United States\r\nand a new relief expedition be sent. It was hard thus to be forgotten by\r\ntheir friends at home. As a last resort the party could retreat in their\r\nboats, but all dreaded the almost hopeless recourse. Gradually the\r\nsummer drew to a close and once more they saw the low-sweeping sun dip\r\nbelow the horizon not to appear again for months. The long, horrible\r\nArctic night again enveloped them in misery and gloom.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of January came every member of the party, including\r\nGreely himself, were convinced that their country had abandoned them and\r\nthey must look out for themselves. He announced that if no relief\r\nappeared they would start for home not later than the 8th of August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FARTHEST NORTH REACHED BY LIEUT. LOCKWOOD ON THE\r\nGREELY EXPEDITION.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Lockwood seems to have been about the only member of the\r\nparty who for a time kept up his high spirits. He was not satisfied with\r\nwhat he had already done, and insisted upon another chance to push\r\nnorthward. He had fixed upon the eighty-fourth parallel as the point\r\nto reach, and he urged the matter so strongly that Greely, who greatly\r\nadmired his courage, gave his consent, though confident that he would\r\nfind it impossible to do as well as in the former instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAILURE.\r\n\r\nLockwood made his start on the morning of March 27, 1883, his companions\r\nbeing the same as before. Two weeks later, as Greely was lying in his\r\ntent, wondering how his friend was making out, Lockwood walked in with a\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n\"Too much water,\" he said; \"if it had only been ice, we could have\r\nmanaged it, but we had no means of getting across the water. Better luck\r\nnext time.\"\r\n\r\nThe next time, however, never came. Greely, Lockwood, and Brainard\r\nalways remained on good terms, but it was not the case with some of the\r\nothers. Companionship, under such conditions, is a bore, and many a time\r\nthe three gentlemen named went off on explorations that occupied several\r\ndays, with no other object than to get away from those whose company was\r\ndistasteful beyond bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE START HOMEWARD.\r\n\r\nGreely had given up all hope of receiving help from the United States\r\nand determined to start for home as soon as his surroundings would\r\npermit. His plan was to proceed to Littleton Island, where it was\r\npossible they might find a vessel that would take them to Newfoundland.\r\nThe explorers, twenty-five in all, made their start southward, August 9,\r\n1883. Their boats were the steam launch referred to, a whale boat, an\r\nEnglish boat, and a smaller one, which it was thought would prove useful\r\nin the event of an accident.\r\n\r\nFor a time the progress was encouraging. The water was quite open, but\r\nice soon appeared. They saved their boats from being nipped by drawing\r\nthem up on a floe. When open water again showed, they took to the boats\r\nand reached Sun Bay without mishap. Then they made their way to Cape\r\nLieber, twenty miles south from Fort Conger, where they were almost\r\noverwhelmed in a blinding snowstorm. There they landed and waited for\r\nthe ice to move and open the way for them along the western shore of the\r\nstrait. A fog kept them there several days, and when they started again\r\nit was in the midst of another blinding snowstorm. One of the incidents\r\nof the struggle against ice and tempest was the falling overboard of\r\nLieutenant Greely and an accident to the launch. Scoresby Bay was\r\nreached on the 22d of August, and found to be full of floating ice. It\r\nwas necessary again to save the boats by drawing them up on the floe. By\r\nthat time, too, the supply of coal had become so low that Greely held a\r\nconsultation with his officers over their situation, which was not only\r\ndangerous but rapidly becoming more so. He proposed to abandon the\r\nlaunch, and use the other boats with which to push along the western\r\nshore, but the majority believed they had a chance of making Littleton\r\nIsland. Ere long it was found necessary to leave behind the smallest\r\nboat, and when that was done most of the party believed all were doomed.\r\nThe elements and even the tides were against them.\r\n\r\nThe launch soon became useless and was abandoned. Resort was then had to\r\nsledge travel, two carrying a boat between them, and all pulled by the\r\nmen. They had not gone far in this toilsome manner when another of the\r\nboats had to be left behind, giving them only one. Even the courageous\r\nLockwood now expressed his belief that none of the party would escape\r\nalive. Still it was better to die struggling than to sit down and fold\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes crowded upon them. The current continued the wrong way and\r\nthe floe upon which they were drifting carried them toward Baffin Bay.\r\nSludge ice, the most troublesome of all, abounded, and their poor\r\nrations grew scant. In the latter part of September enough of the floes\r\ncame in contact to permit the men to pass over them to solid land, some\r\ntwelve miles from Cape Sabine. A reconnoitering party in attempting to\r\nreach that point was turned back by the open water. Another company,\r\nhowever, got through and brought back important news. The _Proteus_ had\r\nbeen wrecked and a couple of caches, left by English ships, together\r\nwith the stores brought from the wreck of the _Proteus_, were\r\ndiscovered. As may be supposed, they formed a welcome addition to the\r\nmeagre stock of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST EXTREMITY.\r\n\r\nIt being inevitable that another winter must be passed in the land of\r\ndesolation, preparations were made for doing so. The spot selected was\r\nbetween Cape Sabine and Cocked Hat Island. A hut was erected and the\r\nsupplies moved thither. Greely informed the men that he had decided to\r\nreduce the rations so that they would last until the coming March. A\r\ncairn was built at Cape Sabine in which was placed a record of what had\r\nbeen done by the explorers.\r\n\r\nAll admitted the necessity of reducing the rations, but it was done to\r\nthat extent that the men suffered continually from hunger. They were\r\nglad to eat mouldy potatoes, and, when, occasionally, a fox was shot,\r\nnothing was left but the shining bones. If the preceding period was\r\nhorrible it was now more so, for all felt they had every reason for\r\ndepression, gloom, and despair. The meagre food made them more\r\nsusceptible to cold, and, although Greely strove to awaken an interest\r\nin different educational subjects, the conditions were so woeful that he\r\naccomplished little. It may seem strange, but it was natural that the\r\nmen's thoughts should dwell almost continually upon delicacies in the\r\nway of eating. They talked about the choicest viands and smacked their\r\nlips over tempting feasts which, alas! existed only in imagination.\r\n\r\nEvery man uttered a prayer of thanks when the 21st of December arrived,\r\nfor it meant that the appalling polar night was half over, but how\r\nendless the other half seemed to them!\r\n\r\nIn the following month the feet of Corporal Ellison were so badly frozen\r\nthat they sloughed off, as did several of his fingers. Soon afterward\r\none of the men died. The brave Lockwood felt himself growing so weak\r\nthat he privately requested Greely to leave him behind, if he should be\r\nalive, when the homeward start was made. Greely replied that under no\r\nconceivable circumstances would he abandon any one if alive, provided he\r\nhimself survived the period of waiting.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in February to reach Littleton Island in the hope of\r\nfinding the relief ship or stores, but the open water compelled the men\r\nto turn back. The same cause prevented their getting to the Greenland\r\nshore, which could be seen when the weather was clear.\r\n\r\nWhen the middle of March came all were placed on starvation rations.\r\nNone of the canned vegetables, coffee, or chocolate was left. The\r\nstraits remained open and shut them off from reaching Greenland, where\r\nthey might have found game. The bravest of the party lost heart and sank\r\ninto the apathy of despair. They felt themselves simply waiting for\r\ndeath. Lockwood wrote in his diary: \"I am glad that each day comes to an\r\nend. It brings us nearer the end of this life, whatever that end may\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nThe fuel, which had been carefully husbanded, gave out in the latter\r\npart of March. The famishing sufferers gathered their furs more tightly\r\naround them and huddled together to secure the mutual warmth of their\r\nemaciated bodies. The furs and shoes could be gnawed and eaten when the\r\nlast extremity arrived. Unexpectedly to all, Sergeant Lynn and one of\r\nthe Eskemos died at the beginning of April. When there was a chance to\r\nshoot game the men were too weak to hunt for it.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Lockwood, the hero of the wonderful achievement narrated,\r\nwhose high spirits and exalted courage carried him through all manner of\r\nperils, died early on the morning of April 9th, his death being due to\r\nstarvation. When the brave fellow had passed away there had not been a\r\nmouthful of food within reach for several days.\r\n\r\nBefore this, it became evident that some one was stealing from the\r\nscanty store. Investigation disclosed the wretched thief to be a man\r\nnamed Henry. Greely warned him, for he was imperiling the lives of all.\r\nHe stole again, whereupon, by orders of Greely, he was shot. When the\r\nfinal extremity came there is reason to believe that cannibalism was\r\nindulged in, though not to much extent. There is no certainty, however,\r\non the matter, and the survivors denied having seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE.\r\n\r\nThough it may seem that the Greely party was forgotten at home, yet such\r\nwas not the fact. The loss of the _Proteus_ caused the gravest fears for\r\ntheir safety, and, in the spring of 1884, the navy department fitted out\r\na new relief expedition, consisting of the _Thetis_, the _Bear_, and the\r\n_Alert_, under Commander Winfield S. Schley, who made such a brilliant\r\nrecord in our late war with Spain.\r\n\r\nCommander Schley sailed from Brooklyn in May, and lost not an hour. He\r\nleft St. John's on the 12th, meeting a great deal of ice in Baffin Bay\r\nand Smith Sound, but he fought his way through, and sent a strong party\r\nashore June 22d to hunt for signs of the missing explorers. The steam\r\nlaunch of the _Bear_ took the party to Brevoort Island, where Lieutenant\r\nLockwood's letter was found, giving their location and stating that they\r\nwere nearly out of provisions. Since the letter was dated eight months\r\nbefore, the dismayed commander and his officers believed it hardly\r\npossible that any of the men would be found alive.\r\n\r\nThe _Bear_ was pushed on, and the launch started out again early the\r\nnext morning. Before sunset Greely's camp was discovered. Making all\r\nhaste forward, the relief party lifted the flap and breathlessly peered\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThey saw Greely on his knees, muttering the prayers for the dying over\r\none of his comrades. He looked up, dazed, bewildered, and unable to read\r\nthe full meaning of what met his eyes. Around him, in different\r\npostures, were stretched his comrades, some dead and the others close to\r\ndeath. Those still living were Greely, Brainard, Biederbeck, Fredericks,\r\nLong, Connell, and Ellison. A few days' later arrival on the part of the\r\n_Bear_, and not one would have been breathing. As it was their lives\r\nwere still in great danger, and it was necessary to nurse them with the\r\nutmost care. The remains of all who had died, with the exception of the\r\nEskemo, were brought back to the United States. During the halt in the\r\nharbor of Disco, to leave the body of the Eskemo, Corporal Ellison, who\r\nhad been so badly frozen, died. The relief expedition reached St. John's\r\non July 17th and New York on the 8th of August.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the prize of the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain and\r\nthe back premium were awarded to Captain Adolphus W. Greely and Sergeant\r\nDavid L. Brainard, for having attained the greatest results for the year\r\nin adding to geographical knowledge by examinations or explorations. No\r\none can deny that this recognition and honor were well won.\r\n\r\nThe Greely expedition possesses so much interest that we have given\r\nconsiderable space to the narration. Among the many explorations of the\r\nfar North, few or none equal this, not only in heroic daring but in\r\nresults accomplished. It may be said that the fate of the Sir John\r\nFranklin party was made clear in 1880, by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka,\r\nof the United States army, who discovered the skeletons of several of\r\nthe unfortunate explorers, together with various relics of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1884.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1884 the Democratic candidates were\r\nGrover Cleveland, of New York, and Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana. The\r\nRepublican were James G. Blaine, of Maine, and General John A. Logan, of\r\nIllinois. The chief issue with the Republicans was the tariff, while the\r\nDemocrats put forward that of civil service reform. There was much\r\nbitter discussion, some of the leading Republican papers refusing to\r\nsupport Blaine because of charges affecting his personal integrity. On\r\nthe other hand, Cleveland was attacked with scarcely less bitterness.\r\nThe quarrel between the leading parties caused some of the weaker ones\r\nto put forward candidates, with a result as follows: Grover Cleveland\r\nand T.A. Hendricks, 219; James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, 182; John P.\r\nSt. John and William Daniel, Prohibition, received 151,809 popular\r\nvotes; and Benjamin F. Butler and A.M. West, People's party, 133,825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF CLEVELAND (FIRST) AND OF HARRISON, 1885-1893.\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland--Completion of the Washington Monument--The Bartholdi\r\nStatue--Death of General Grant--Death of Vice-President Hendricks--The\r\nFirst Vice-President to Die in Office--George Clinton--Elbridge\r\nGerry--William R.

Two terms, 1885-1889--1893-1897.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Buffalo, N.Y., has the distinction of being the only one in\r\nthe United States which has furnished two presidents of the country.\r\nMillard Fillmore hailed from Buffalo and Grover Cleveland went from that\r\ncity to occupy the highest office in the gift of the American people.\r\nHis native place, however, was Caldwell, New Jersey, where he was born,\r\nMarch 18, 1837. He was the son of a clergyman and received a fair\r\neducation in the public schools, and became an instructor for a time in\r\nan institution for the blind at Clinton, N.Y. He removed to Buffalo in\r\n1855, and, having engaged in the study of law, soon became prominent at\r\nthe bar. He was appointed assistant district attorney in 1863, and in\r\n1870 was elected sheriff of the county. His course gained the confidence\r\nof the community and led to his election as mayor of Buffalo, in 1881,\r\nthough the city was naturally strongly Republican in politics.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland added to his popularity by his able administration and was\r\nnominated for governor of the State in the autumn of the following year.\r\nHis success by the unprecedented majority of 192,854 attracted national\r\nattention and led the Democrats to believe he was their most available\r\ncandidate for the presidency. His course as governor commended itself to\r\nhis friends, who were so numerous that, when his name was presented at\r\nChicago, he received 683 votes against 137 for all others.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Mr. Cleveland was the first Democratic President\r\nsince the opening of the war. He assumed his office with the best wishes\r\nof the people, though it is worth noting in this place that the majority\r\nby which he was elected was much less than a glance at the returns would\r\nsuggest. At a public reception of Mr. Blaine, during the canvass, a\r\nclergyman referred to the Democratic party as that of \"Rum, Romanism,\r\nand Rebellion.\" This unfortunate expression drove away a number of votes\r\nfrom Mr. Blaine, who was defeated in New York by a few hundreds only;\r\nbut they were sufficient to turn the thirty-six electoral votes to Mr.\r\nCleveland and secure his election by the majority already named.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETION OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nFor years preceding the Civil War, and for a long time afterward, the\r\nWashington monument was a source of reproach and jest among the people,\r\nbecause so long a period was allowed to pass before its completion. The\r\ncorner-stone was laid July 4, 1848, at which time Robert C. Winthrop,\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, delivered the address. The\r\noccasion was made notable by the presence of Daniel Webster, Henry Clay,\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, and President Polk. The memorial to the greatest\r\nAmerican orator that ever lived was allowed to stand uncompleted for\r\nthirty-seven years, its formal dedication taking place February 21st\r\n(the 22d fell on Sunday), 1885. The address of the venerable W.W.\r\nCorcoran, first vice-president of the Washington Monument Society,\r\nformed in 1833, was read by Dr. J.C. Welling, president of Columbia\r\nUniversity, and the ceremonies were of an interesting character. The\r\nMasonic services were conducted by the Grand Lodge of the District of\r\nColumbia, which used the gavel that Washington had employed in laying\r\nthe corner-stone of the national capitol, September 18, 1793, while the\r\nBible was the one upon which he took his vows when made a Mason. A\r\nsecond Bible was the one upon which he was sworn into office, April 30,\r\n1789, when inaugurated President of the United States. This relic is now\r\nthe property of St. John Lodge, No. 1, of New York City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.]\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's address was as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN: Before the dawn of the century whose eventful\r\n   years will soon have faded into the past--when death had but lately\r\n   robbed the republic of its most beloved and illustrious citizen--the\r\n   Congress of the United States pledged the faith of the nation that in\r\n   this city, bearing his honored name, and then, as now, the seat of\r\n   the general government, a monument should be erected 'to commemorate\r\n   the great events of his military and political life.'\r\n\r\n   \"The stately column that stretches heavenward from the plain whereon\r\n   we stand bears witness to all who behold it that the covenant which\r\n   our fathers made their children have fulfilled. In the completion of\r\n   this great work of patriotic endeavor there is abundant cause for\r\n   national rejoicing; for while this structure shall endure it shall be\r\n   to all mankind a steadfast token of the affectionate and reverent\r\n   regard in which this people continue to hold the memory of\r\n   Washington. Well may he ever keep the foremost place in the hearts of\r\n   his countrymen; the faith that never faltered; the wisdom that was\r\n   broader and deeper than any learning taught in schools; the courage\r\n   that shrank from no peril and was dismayed by no defeat; the loyalty\r\n   that kept all selfish purposes subordinate to the demands of\r\n   patriotism and honor; the sagacity that displayed itself in camp and\r\n   cabinet alike; and, above all, that harmonious union of moral and\r\n   intellectual qualities which has never found its parallel among men;\r\n   these are the attributes of character which the intelligent thought\r\n   of this century ascribes to the grandest figure of the last.\r\n\r\n   \"But other and more eloquent lips than mine will to-day rehearse to\r\n   you the story of his noble life and its glorious achievements. To\r\n   myself has been assigned a simpler and more formal duty, in\r\n   fulfillment of which I do now, as President of the United States and\r\n   in behalf of the people, receive this monument from the hands of the\r\n   builder, and declare it dedicated from this time forth to the\r\n   immortal name and memory of George Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies at the monument being completed, those within the capitol\r\nfollowed. General Sheridan was in charge of the military, and the\r\noration of Robert C. Winthrop, who was kept away by illness, was read by\r\nGovernor Long. John W. Daniel, a leading soldier on the side of the\r\nConfederacy during the Civil War and afterward a member of Congress from\r\nVirginia, delivered a graphic sketch of Washington, and closed with the\r\neloquent peroration:\r\n\r\n   \"Long live the republic of Washington! Respected by mankind, beloved\r\n   by all its sons, long may it be the asylum of the poor and oppressed\r\n   of all lands and religions--long may it be the citadel of that\r\n   liberty which writes beneath the eagle's folded wings: 'We will sell\r\n   to no man, we will deny to no man right and justice.'\r\n\r\n   \"Long live the United States of America! Filled with the free,\r\n   magnanimous spirit, crowned by the wisdom, blessed by the moderation,\r\n   hovered over by the guardian angel of Washington's example, may they\r\n   ever be worthy in all things to be defended by the blood of the brave\r\n   who knew the rights of man--may they each be a column, and all\r\n   together, under the Constitution, a perpetual temple of peace,\r\n   unshadowed by a Caesar's palace, at whose altar may freely commune all\r\n   who seek the union of liberty and brotherhood.\r\n\r\n   \"Long live our country! Oh, long through the undying ages may it\r\n   stand, far removed in fact, as in space, from the Old World's feuds\r\n   and follies--solitary and alone in its grandeur and glory--itself the\r\n   immortal monument of him whom Providence commissioned to teach man\r\n   the power of truth, and to prove to the nations that their Redeemer\r\n   liveth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Washington Monument with its 555 feet is the\r\nhighest in the world; the Cathedral at Cologne, 511 feet, is next; while\r\nthe height of the Great Pyramid is 486 feet. The cap-stone was put in\r\nposition December 6, 1884, and the whole cost of the monument was\r\n$1,187,710, of which Congress furnished $900,000. An iron stairway of\r\n900 steps and an elevator provide means for ascending the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARTHOLDI STATUE.\r\n\r\nWhen a person enters New York harbor on his visit or return to the New\r\nWorld, the most striking object upon which his eyes rest is the Statue\r\nof Liberty. This represents the idea of Liberty enlightening the world,\r\nas conceived by Frederick Auguste Bartholdi, the eminent French\r\nsculptor. He began circulating his subscriptions for the work through\r\nFrance in 1874. The popularity of the scheme is attested by the fact\r\nthat contributions were received from 180 cities, forty general\r\ncouncils, a large number of chambers of commerce and of societies, and\r\nmore than 10,000 subscribers. On the 22d of February, 1877, Congress\r\nvoted to accept the gift, and set apart Bedlow's Island for the site.\r\nThe statue was finished in 1883, and displayed to public view for some\r\ntime in Paris. Its official presentation to the minister of the United\r\nStates took place July 4, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe French transport _Isere_, with the Liberty statue on board, arrived\r\nat New York, June 24, 1885, and was saluted and welcomed by a hundred\r\ndifferent vessels. The dedication ceremonies, October 28, 1886, were\r\namong the most impressive ever witnessed in the metropolis of our\r\ncountry. Among those on the reviewing stand, near the Worth Monument,\r\nwere President Cleveland, General Sheridan, the members of the\r\nPresident's cabinet, M. Bartholdi, M. de Lesseps, representative of the\r\ndiplomatic corps at Washington, and many distinguished American\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe following facts will give an idea of the size of this great statue:\r\nthe forefinger is more than eight feet long; the second joint is about\r\nfive feet in circumference; the finger-nail is a foot long, and the nose\r\nnearly four feet; the head is fourteen and a half feet high, and can\r\naccommodate forty persons, while the hollow torch will hold twelve\r\npersons. The copper sheets which form the outside of the statue weigh\r\neighty-eight tons. From the base to the top of the torch is slightly\r\nmore than 150 feet, which is 305 feet above low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nIn no event of Cleveland's first administration was the public more\r\ndeeply concerned than in the death of General Grant, the foremost\r\ndefender of the Union. After his return from his triumphant journey\r\naround the world, he engaged in business in the city of New York. The\r\nsoul of honor himself, it was hard for him to believe the dishonesty of\r\nothers; but he became the victim of unscrupulous persons, and lost not\r\nonly all his own savings but those of many of his friends. He did\r\neverything in his power to make good his losses, but succeeded only to a\r\nslight extent. He was ruined financially, though a grateful nation would\r\nnever permit him to suffer want.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FUNERAL TRAIN OF GENERAL GRANT PASSING WEST POINT.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this sad period that a cancer developed at the root of his\r\ntongue, and, though he received the best medical attention in the\r\ncountry, the malignant excrescence soon made it evident that he was\r\nbeyond human help. He devoted himself heroically to writing his\r\nmemoirs, and, with the grim determination which was so marked a feature\r\nof his character, he fought off the last great enemy until the valuable\r\nwork was finished.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's last days were spent with his family at Mount McGregor\r\nin New York State, where he quietly breathed his last on the evening of\r\nJuly 22, 1885. The body was embalmed and removed to the City Hall in New\r\nYork, where it was viewed by mourning thousands before its removal to\r\nthe last resting-place in Riverside Park. The final impressive scenes,\r\nwhen the remains were deposited in the mausoleum on the banks of the\r\nHudson, took place in 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF VICE-PRESIDENT HENDRICKS.\r\n\r\nThomas A. Hendricks, Vice-President of the United States, died November\r\n25, 1885, at his home in Indianapolis, from paralysis of the heart. He\r\nwas born in Ohio in 1819, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in\r\n1843. He was elected to the Indiana Legislature in 1848, and three years\r\nlater became Democratic member of Congress from the central district of\r\nIndiana. He was chosen a United States senator in 1868, and strongly\r\nopposed the impeachment of President Johnson. He was prominently named\r\nseveral times for the presidency of the United States. In Indianapolis,\r\nwhere he had long made his home, he was universally respected by members\r\nof all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER VICE-PRESIDENTS WHO DIED IN OFFICE.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Hendricks was not the first Vice-President to die in office,\r\nit will be interesting to complete the list. George Clinton served one\r\nterm under Jefferson, and had nearly ended another under Madison, when\r\nhe died in 1812. His career had been extraordinary. He was a soldier in\r\nthe French and Indian War, was a sailor on a privateer, and became a\r\nbrigadier-general in the Revolution, but was unsuccessful in his defense\r\nof the Highland forts in 1777. At one time he was a member of the\r\nProvincial Congress and was the first governor of New York, serving for\r\neighteen years, from 1777 to 1795, and again 1801-04, when he became\r\nVice-President. His death occurred in Washington, and the eight\r\npall-bearers were Revolutionary soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious coincidence that the next Vice-President to die in\r\noffice was the immediate successor of Clinton, Elbridge Gerry, who died\r\nNovember 23, 1814. He was a native of Massachusetts, a member of its\r\ncolonial House of Representatives and a delegate to the Continental\r\nCongress. He signed the Declaration of Independence and aided in framing\r\nthe Constitution, though he refused to sign it, on the ground that it\r\nconferred too much power on the national government. He held a number of\r\nimportant public offices and was governor of Massachusetts in 1810 and\r\n1811. In the latter year, the Republicans (modern Democrats) carried\r\nout a redistricting scheme by which the Essex district took a form which\r\nmany fancied bore a resemblance to a salamander. It was from this\r\nincident that the word \"gerrymander,\" so often heard in politics in\r\nthese days, took its name.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that when Franklin Pierce became President, the\r\nVice-President, William R. King, was an invalid in Cuba, where he took\r\nthe oath of office before the American consul. He was in the last stages\r\nof consumption and died shortly after his return to his home in Alabama.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, Vice-President with General Grant, died November 25, 1875,\r\nhis death being hastened, it is believed, by the news of the death of\r\nhis intimate friend, Senator Ferry, of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe death of General McClellan has already been mentioned as taking\r\nplace on the 29th of October, 1885. A few months later, February 9,\r\n1886, General Hancock died at his home on Governor's Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF GENERAL HANCOCK--HIS CAREER.\r\n\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott Hancock was an ideal American soldier and\r\nofficer, brave, chivalrous, courteous to foe as well as friend,\r\npatriotic, a gentleman at all times and under all circumstances, genial,\r\nremarkably handsome and prepossessing in manner, who made friends\r\neverywhere. His conduct of political affairs in a section of the South\r\nduring the troublous reconstruction days won the commendation of his\r\ngovernment and the respect of the South, who pronounced him a \"just\r\nman,\" for whom they formed a strong personal affection. But for\r\nHancock's unfortunate slip, he assuredly would have been elected\r\nPresident of the United States in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe two peculiarities of Hancock's birth was that he was a twin and was\r\nborn on St. Valentine's day, February 14, 1824, in Montgomery County,\r\nPennsylvania. Appointed to West Point, he found among his fellow-cadets\r\nU.S. Grant, G.B. McClellan, Rosecrans, Longstreet, and Stonewall\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nHancock entered the Mexican War as second lieutenant, taking part in\r\nthree engagements, receiving a wound and winning the brevet of first\r\nlieutenant. He was appointed quartermaster in 1855, with the rank of\r\ncaptain. Three years later he was a member of the expedition to Utah to\r\nbring the Mormons to terms. When the Civil War broke out, he was at Los\r\nAngeles, Southern California, where considerable sympathy was shown for\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. The tact of the United States forces in that\r\nsection held the State true, a patriotic speech of General Hancock\r\ncontributing greatly to the same end.\r\n\r\nHis patriotism would not allow him to remain idle, and, when he learned\r\nof the grave condition of affairs in the East, he applied to be called\r\nthither. The request was granted, and he was so anxious to serve his\r\ncountry that he did not pause to call on his parents while on the way to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nHancock's first appointment was as quartermaster-general in General\r\nRobert Anderson's command in Kentucky; but McClellan, who knew his\r\nworth, made a personal request of President Lincoln to appoint him\r\nbrigadier-general. His commission was dated September 23, 1861.\r\nMcClellan said of him: \"He was a man of the most chivalrous courage and\r\nof superb presence, especially in action; he had a wonderfully quick and\r\ncorrect eye for ground and for handling troops; his judgment was good,\r\nand it would be difficult to find a better corps commander.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY HALL, PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nEquestrian statues of Generals Reynolds and McClellan ornament the\r\nplaza, and one of General Hancock is to be erected on one of the vacant\r\ncorners.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Hancock gave invaluable help in moulding the Army of the Potomac\r\ninto the magnificent form it attained, and his brigade was conceded to\r\nbe the finest and most effective in the whole army at the time the\r\nlanding was made on the peninsula between Chesapeake Bay and the James\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nIn the bloody battle of Williamsburg, his skill and personal courage\r\nwere of the highest order. Making a feint of retreating, he drew the\r\nenemy after him into the position he intended, when he turned and\r\nassailed them with a furious musketry fire. It was his men who captured\r\nthe first colors taken by the Army of the Potomac, and it was on that\r\noccasion that Hancock used the expression which has been often quoted.\r\nIn the midst of the tumult and swirl of battle he shouted: \"Now,\r\ngentlemen, we will give them the bayonet!\" Hancock received the personal\r\nthanks of McClellan for his fine work.\r\n\r\nHe was always loyal to his superiors, McClellan, Burnside, McClellan\r\nagain, Hooker, and Meade, rapidly rising in prominence until at the\r\ngreat battle of Gettysburg he contributed perhaps more than any single\r\nman to the success of the Union arms. Among the titles applied to him by\r\nhis admiring countrymen were \"The Superb\" and \"The Hero of Gettysburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe Confederates who came in contact with him expressed their admiration\r\nof his dauntless courage and coolness. He was painfully wounded, but,\r\nwhile lying on a stretcher, he sent a message to General Meade that the\r\nConfederate army was in retreat. Meade replied with his grateful thanks\r\nand sympathy, and Congress also thanked him.\r\n\r\nHis ardent patriotism placed him in the saddle before his wound had\r\nhealed, and at one time during the battle of the Wilderness he was\r\nobliged to give up his command. At Chancellorsville he captured the\r\nwhole division of General Edward Johnson. When that officer was brought\r\ninto Hancock's tent the latter extended his hand to his old\r\nacquaintance, exclaiming heartily, \"How are you, Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to take your hand,\" replied the humiliated prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Hancock, \"I shouldn't have offered it to you under any\r\nother circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHancock was in command of the Second Army Corps for the last time at the\r\nbattle of Boydton. His remarkable skill in training soldiers caused\r\nSecretary Stanton to assign to him the task of organizing the First\r\nVeteran Corps, composed of soldiers, all of whom had been in service two\r\nyears. He afterward commanded the Army of the Shenandoah, and was in\r\ncharge at Washington at the time of the assassination of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, he was transferred from the command of the division of the\r\nAtlantic and assigned to that of Dakota, where he remained until 1872,\r\nwhen he resumed command of the division of the Atlantic. His last public\r\nappearance was when he commanded the military forces which assisted in\r\nthe funeral ceremonies of General Grant.\r\n\r\nAs a proof that General Hancock's skill with the pen was hardly less\r\nthan that with the sword, the following extract is given from an article\r\nby him on the battle of Gettysburg:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARBITRATION\r\n\r\nThe relations of capital and labor--mutually dependent the one upon the\r\nother--both selfish and often unjust--have caused serious trouble in the\r\npast decade of the world's history. Fair and equitable arbitration seems\r\nto be the only safe and just way of settling disputes of this\r\ncharacter.]\r\n\r\n\"Cemetery Hill has since become consecrated ground. The place where\r\nGeneral Howard was superseded in command on the first day of the fight\r\nis now covered with the graves of thousands of gallant soldiers whose\r\nbones lie buried at the base of the beautiful monumental column which\r\ncommemorates their fame. Two of the marble statues ornamenting the\r\npedestal personify War and History. War, symbolized by a soldier resting\r\nfrom the conflict, narrates to History the story of the struggle and the\r\ndeeds of the martyr-heroes who fell in that famous battle. In\r\nremembrance of these noble comrades who laid down their lives for the\r\ngeneral weal, it were simply sacrilege for any survivor to pour into the\r\nears of History an incorrect account of the contest, still more to\r\nassume to himself honors belonging perhaps less to the living than to\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\n\"The historian of the future who essays to tell the tale of Gettysburg\r\nundertakes an onerous task, a high responsibility, a sacred trust. Above\r\nall things, justice and truth should dwell in his mind and heart. Then,\r\ndipping his pen as it were in the crimson tide, the sunshine of heaven\r\nlighting his page, giving 'honor to whom honor is due,' doing even\r\njustice to the splendid valor alike of friend and foe, he may tell the\r\nworld how the rain descended in streams of fire, and the floods came in\r\nthe billows of rebellion, and the winds blew in blasts of fraternal\r\nexecration, and beat upon the fabric of the Federal Union, and that it\r\nfell not, for, resting on the rights and liberties of the people, it was\r\nfounded upon a rock.\" General Hancock died February 9, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL AND LABOR.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gravest problem which confronts our country is the eternal\r\nstrife between capital and labor. It is a problem which when solved will\r\nprove one of the most beneficent boons that ever blessed mankind.\r\nDisputes continually arise between employers and employees; strikes have\r\noccurred without number, many of them attended by violence, the\r\ndestruction of property and lamentable loss of life. Arbitration is the\r\nbest and most sensible cure for the grave peril which at times has\r\nseemed to threaten the safety of our institutions, and when the employer\r\nand those dependent upon him for the support of themselves and families\r\nmeet in a friendly spirit and discuss their differences, they are\r\ncertain to reach an amicable agreement.\r\n\r\nThat men have the right to strike and combine against a lowering of\r\ntheir wages or for the purpose of increasing them is beyond all dispute.\r\nThat they have the right to destroy property or prevent other men from\r\ntaking their places is contended by no intelligent person, but, so long\r\nas human nature remains as it is, they will do so, with the result that\r\nin almost every instance it is the laborers themselves who are the\r\ngreatest losers and sufferers.\r\n\r\nOne fact for which all ought to be grateful is that the murderous\r\nanarchists who once plotted and struck with the venom of rattlesnakes\r\nhave either disappeared or ceased their evil work. They are scarcely\r\nheard of in these days, and that it may ever remain thus is the fervent\r\nwish of every patriotic and right-minded citizen.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that so long as the United States remains an asylum for\r\nthe persecuted and oppressed of all nations, it must receive many of the\r\nmiscreants that have been compelled to flee from their own countries to\r\nescape the penalty of their crimes. Despite the ravings of the\r\nanarchists, we have good-naturedly let them alone, not believing they\r\nwould ever dare to carry out any of the threats which they were so fond\r\nof making. Thus they became emboldened and finally ventured to put their\r\nexecrable principles into practice.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many strikes in different parts of the country in the\r\nearly months of 1886. A number were settled by arbitration, such as the\r\nstrike on the elevated railroads in New York City, but others were\r\nfought out to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nA strike occurred on the Missouri Pacific Railroad in the spring of\r\n1886. The strikers became violent, destroyed property, and a number of\r\nlives were lost. The end came in May, and, as is generally the case, it\r\nwas against the employes, many of whom were unable to regain the places\r\nthat had been taken by others.\r\n\r\n\r\nANARCHISTIC OUTBREAK IN CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nThe cry for eight hours, at the same rate of wages previously paid for\r\nten, was raised in New York and Chicago in May, 1886. Here and there a\r\ncompromise of nine hours was agreed upon with a half of each Saturday\r\nfor the employes, but in other cases the employers would not yield\r\nanything. This issue led to the strike of 40,000 workmen in Chicago, who\r\nwere chiefly lumbermen, brickmakers, freight-handlers, iron-workers, and\r\nmen employed in factories. So many people were idle that business of all\r\nkinds suffered. Naturally there were many parades and much\r\nspeech-making. That \"an idle mind is the devil's workshop\" was proven by\r\nthe appearance of the communistic red flag in some of the parades and by\r\nthe savage utterances of their speech-makers.\r\n\r\nThe pork packers and brewers amicably adjusted the strikes of their men,\r\nbut the majority of the employers refused to concede anything. Sunday,\r\nthe 2d of May, passed without incident, but the police knew the\r\nanarchists were plotting and trouble was at hand. Probably 12,000\r\nstrikers gathered the next day at the McCormick Reaper Works on Western\r\nAvenue, where they shattered the windows with stones. At the moment an\r\nattack was about to be made upon the buildings, a patrol wagon dashed up\r\nwith twelve policemen, who sprang to the ground. Drawing their revolvers\r\nthey faced the mob and ordered them to disperse. They were answered with\r\na volley of stones. The policemen fired twice over the heads of the\r\nrioters, thereby encouraging instead of intimidating them. Seeing the\r\nfolly of throwing away their shots, the policemen now fired directly at\r\nthe rioters, who answered with pistol-shots, but they did not hit any of\r\nthe officers.\r\n\r\nOther patrol wagons hurried up, and the officers did not wait until they\r\ncould leap out before opening fire. Their brave attack forced back the\r\nmob, and in the course of an hour the streets were cleared. The\r\nterrified workmen were escorted by the policemen to their homes. But for\r\nsuch protection they would have been killed by the infuriated rioters.\r\n\r\nTuesday was marked by many affrays between the officers and\r\nlaw-breakers, but no serious conflict occurred. Placards were\r\ndistributed during the day, calling upon the \"workingmen\" to meet that\r\nevening at the old Haymarket Place, and the organ of the anarchists\r\nurged the men to arm against the police. At the meeting the most\r\nincendiary speeches were made, and the speakers had roused the several\r\nthousand listeners to the highest pitch of excitement, when Inspector\r\nBonfield at the head of a column of officers forced his way to the\r\nstand, ordered the speaker to stop, and commanded the crowd to disperse.\r\nHe was answered with jeers and a storm of missiles. While the policemen\r\nwere calmly awaiting the orders of the inspector, some one in the crowd\r\nthrew a sputtering dynamite bomb at the feet of the officers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HAYMARKET PLAZA, CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nThis monument shows the spot where on May 3, 1886, a dynamite bomb was\r\nthrown by anarchists into a group of policemen, killing seven, crippling\r\neleven for life, and injuring twelve others so they were unable to do\r\nduty for a year.]\r\n\r\nA moment later it exploded, killing seven and crippling eleven for life.\r\nThe enraged survivors dashed into the mob, shooting and using their\r\nclubs with fearful effect. Within five minutes the crowd was scattered,\r\nbut many lay dead and wounded on the ground. In the investigation that\r\nfollowed, it was shown that the anarchists had planned to slay hundreds\r\nof innocent people and plunder the city. Their leaders were brought to\r\ntrial, ably defended, and the most prominent sentenced to death. One\r\ncommitted suicide, a number were hanged, and others sentenced to long\r\nterms of imprisonment. All of the latter were pardoned by Governor\r\nAltgeld when he assumed office. Since that time, as has been stated, the\r\nanarchists have given little trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nThe year 1886 was marked by one of the most terrifying visitations that\r\ncan come to any country. Earthquake shocks have been felt in different\r\nplaces in the United States, and the earth-tremors are so frequent in\r\nCalifornia that they cause little alarm, for very few have inflicted any\r\ndamage to property or life.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 31st, the city of Richmond, Virginia, was thrown\r\ninto consternation by a series of earthquake shocks. The convicts in the\r\npenitentiary became so panic-stricken that the militia had to be called\r\nout to control them. The shock was felt still more violently in\r\nColumbia, South Carolina. The buildings swayed as if rocked in a gale,\r\nand hundreds of citizens rushed into the street in their night robes.\r\nThe scenes were less startling in Memphis, Nashville, Raleigh,\r\nChattanooga, Selma, Lynchburg, Norfolk, Mobile, St. Louis, Cleveland,\r\nIndianapolis, Chicago, Pittsburg, while the tremor was felt as far north\r\nas Albany, N.Y.\r\n\r\nThe most fearful visitation, however, was at Charleston, South Carolina.\r\nTelegraphic communication was cut off with the rest of the world, and\r\nfor hours the horrifying belief prevailed that the city had been\r\nentirely destroyed. Such, happily, was not the fact, though never in all\r\nthe stormy history of Charleston did she pass through so terrible an\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nLate on the evening named, the inhabitants found themselves tossed\r\nabout, with their houses tumbling into ruins. They ran in terror into\r\nthe streets, many not stopping until they reached the open country,\r\nwhile others flung themselves on their knees and begged heaven to save\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe shocks that night were ten in number, each less violent than its\r\npredecessor. Fires started in several quarters, and twenty houses were\r\nburned before the firemen gained control. The next morning vibrations\r\nagain shook the city, all coming from the southeast and passing off in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction. The first warning was a deep, subterraneous\r\nrumbling, then the earth quivered and heaved, and in a few seconds the\r\nterrific wave had gone by. When night came again, 50,000 people--men,\r\nwomen, and children--were in the streets, none daring to enter their\r\nhouses. They fled to the open squares to escape being crushed by the\r\nfalling buildings. Many believed the day of judgment had come and the\r\nnegroes were frenzied with terror.\r\n\r\nSingular effects of the earthquake showed themselves. In some places,\r\nthe covers were hurled from the wells and were followed by geysers of\r\nmud and water. Some wells were entirely emptied, but they soon refilled.\r\nThe shocks continued at varying intervals for several weeks, though none\r\nwas as violent as at first. In Charleston fully a hundred people were\r\nkilled and two-thirds of the city required rebuilding. While damage was\r\ndone at other points, none equaled that at Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe country was quick to respond to the needs of the smitten city.\r\nContributions were forwarded from every point as freely as when Chicago\r\nwas devastated by fire. Tents, provisions, and many thousands of dollars\r\nwere sent thither. Even Queen Victoria telegraphed her sympathy to\r\nPresident Cleveland. One of the mitigations of such scourges is that\r\nthey seem to draw humanity closer into one general brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF THE APACHES.\r\n\r\nAn important work accomplished during the first administration of\r\nCleveland was the conquest and subjection of the Apaches of the\r\nSouthwest. These Indians are the most terrible red men that ever lived\r\nanywhere. They are incredibly tough of frame, as merciless as tigers,\r\nand capable of undergoing hardships and privations before which any\r\nother people would succumb. They will travel for days without a mouthful\r\nof food, will go for hour after hour through a climate that is like that\r\nof Sahara without a drop of moisture, will climb precipitous mountains\r\nas readily as a slight declivity, will lope across the burning deserts\r\nall day without fatigue, or, if riding one of their wiry ponies, will\r\nkill and eat a portion of them when hunger must be attended to, and then\r\ncontinue their journey on foot.\r\n\r\nIf a party of Apache raiders are hard pressed by cavalry, they will\r\nbreak up and continue their flight singly, meeting at some rendezvous\r\nmany miles away, after the discouraged troopers have abandoned pursuit.\r\nThey seem as impervious to the fiery heat of Arizona and New Mexico as\r\nsalamanders. Tonight they may burn a ranchman's home, massacre him and\r\nall his family, and to-morrow morning will repeat the crime fifty miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nNo men could have displayed more bravery and endurance in running down\r\nthe Apaches than the United States cavalry. The metal-work of their\r\nweapons grew so hot that it would blister the bare hands, and for days\r\nthe thermometer marked one hundred and twenty degrees.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bourke, who understands these frightful red men thoroughly,\r\ngives the following description of the Apache:\r\n\r\n\"Physically, he is perfect; he might be a trifle taller for artistic\r\neffect, but his apparent 'squattiness' is due more to great girth of\r\nchest than to diminutive stature. His muscles are hard as bone, and I\r\nhave seen one light a match on the sole of his foot. When Crook first\r\ntook the Apache in hand, he had few wants and cared for no luxuries. War\r\nwas his business, his life, and victory his dream. To attack a Mexican\r\ncamp or isolated village, and run off a herd of cattle, mules, or sheep,\r\nhe would gladly travel hundreds of miles, incurring every risk and\r\ndisplaying a courage which would have been extolled in a historical\r\nnovel as having happened in a raid by Highlanders upon Scotchmen; but\r\nwhen it was _your_ stock, or your friend's stock, it became quite a\r\ndifferent matter. He wore no clothing whatever save a narrow piece of\r\ncalico or buckskin about his loins, a helmet also of buckskin,\r\nplentifully crested with the plumage of the wild turkey and eagle, and\r\nlong-legged moccasins, held to the waist by a string, and turned up at\r\nthe toes in a shield which protected him from stones and the 'cholla'\r\ncactus. If he felt thirsty, he drank from the nearest brook; if there\r\nwas no brook near by he went without, and, putting a stone or a twig in\r\nhis mouth to induce a flow of saliva, journeyed on. When he desired to\r\ncommunicate with friends at home, or to put himself in correspondence\r\nwith persons whose co-operation had been promised, he rubbed two sticks\r\ntogether, and dense signal smoke rolled to the zenith, and was answered\r\nfrom peaks twenty and thirty miles away. By nightfall, his bivouac was\r\npitched at a distance from water, generally on the flank of a rocky\r\nmountain, along which no trail would be left, and up which no force of\r\ncavalry could hope to ascend without making noise enough to wake the\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nThis graphic picture of the dusky scourge of the Southwest will explain\r\nthe dread in which he was held by all who were compelled to live away\r\nfrom the towns. When practicable, the ranchmen combined against the\r\nApaches, but, from the necessities of the case, they were powerless to\r\nextirpate the pests. Unsuccessful attempts were made by the military\r\nforces, but nothing definite was accomplished until General George Crook\r\ntook the work in hand.\r\n\r\nCrook was an old Indian campaigner who thoroughly understood the nature\r\nof the difficult task before him. His preparations being completed, he\r\nordered his different columns to converge, December 9, 1872, on Tonto\r\nBasin, which was one of the principal strongholds of the Apaches in\r\nArizona. The section is inclosed by the Mogollen, the Mazatzal, and the\r\nSierra Ancha Mountains, and the timbered region is so elevated that\r\nduring the winter months it is covered with snow. Crook himself took\r\nstation at Camp Grant, one of the most unattractive posts in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis officer having started on his campaign pushed it with untiring\r\nenergy. He had selected the best Indian fighters to be found anywhere,\r\nand they pursued and rounded up the bucks with amazing skill and\r\npersistency. As soon as they corralled a party of hostiles, they\r\nimpressed the best trailers and used them in running down the others.\r\nThe Indians were allowed no time to rest. When they had fled many miles,\r\nand supposed their pursuers were left far out of sight, as had hitherto\r\nbeen the case, they discovered them at their heels. Plunging into their\r\nfastnesses in the mountains did not avail, for the white and the red\r\ntrailers could follow and did follow them wherever they took refuge.\r\n\r\nThe pursuing detachments frequently crossed one another's trails, often\r\nmet and kept within supporting distance. The danger which threatened the\r\nApaches was as present in the darkness as when the sun was shining. One\r\nof the seemingly inaccessible strongholds was reached by the troopers\r\npushing the pursuit all through the night. As a proof of the skill of\r\nthe Apache trailers, it may be said they were often guided in the gloom\r\nby the feeling of their feet, which told them when they were on the\r\ntrail of the enemy. Captain Bourke, whom we have quoted, was in command\r\nof a detachment of the best Indian trailers and sharpshooters. He thus\r\ndescribes the scene and incidents, when, after hours of stealthy pursuit\r\nthrough the rough region, they came upon the hostiles, who believed\r\nthemselves beyond reach of the most persistent enemies of any race:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL CROOK'S APACHE GUIDE.]\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant William J. Ross, of the Twenty-first Infantry, was assigned\r\nto lead the first detachment, which contained the best shots from among\r\nthe soldiers, packers, and scouts. The second detachment came under my\r\nown orders. Our pioneer party slipped down the face of the precipice\r\nwithout accident, following a trail from which an incautious step would\r\nhave caused them to be dashed to pieces; after a couple of hundred yards\r\nthis brought them face to face with the cave, and not two hundred feet\r\nfrom it. In front of the cave was the party of raiders, just returned\r\nfrom their successful trip of killing and robbing in the settlement near\r\nFlorence on the Gila River. They were dancing to keep themselves warm\r\nand to express their joy over their safe return. Half a dozen or more of\r\nthe squaws had arisen from their slumbers and were bending over a fire\r\nand hurriedly preparing refreshments for their victorious kinsmen. The\r\nfitful gleam of the glowing flame gave a Macbethian tinge to the weird\r\nscene, and brought into bold relief the grim outlines of the cliffs,\r\nbetween whose steep walls, hundreds of feet below, growled the rushing\r\ncurrent of the swift Salado.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians, men and women, were in high good humor, and why should\r\nthey not be? Sheltered in the bosom of these grim precipices, only the\r\neagle, the hawk, the turkey buzzard, or the mountain sheep could venture\r\nto intrude upon them. But hark! What is that noise? Can it be the breeze\r\nof morning which sounds 'click, click?' You will know in one second\r\nmore, poor, deluded, red-skinned wretches, when the 'bang! boom!' of\r\nrifles and carbines, reverberating like the roar of a cannon, from peak\r\nto peak, shall lay six of your number dead in the dust.\r\n\r\n\"The cold, gray dawn of that chill December morning was sending its\r\nfirst rays above the horizon and looking down upon one of the worst\r\nbands of Apaches in Arizona, caught like wolves in a trap. They rejected\r\nwith scorn our summons to surrender, and defiantly shrieked that not one\r\nof our party should escape from the canyon. We heard their death-song\r\nchanted, and then out of the cave and over the great pile of rocks,\r\nwhich protected the entrance like a parapet, swarmed the warriors. But\r\nwe outnumbered them three to one, and poured in lead by the bucketful.\r\nThe bullets, striking the mouth and roof of the cave, glanced among the\r\nsavages in rear of the parapet, and wounded some of the women and\r\nchildren, whose wails filled the air.\r\n\r\n\"During the heaviest part of the firing, a little boy not more than four\r\nyears old, absolutely naked, ran out at the side of the parapet and\r\nstood dumfounded between the two fires. Nantaje, without a moment's\r\npause, rushed forward, grasped the trembling infant by the arm, and\r\nescaped unhurt with him, inside our lines. A bullet, probably deflected\r\nfrom the rocks, had struck the boy on top of his head and plowed around\r\nto the back of his neck, leaving a welt an eighth of an inch thick, but\r\nnot injuring him seriously. Our men suspended their firing to cheer\r\nNantaje and welcome the new arrival; such is the inconsistency of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"Again the Apaches were summoned to surrender, or, if they would not do\r\nthat, to let such of their women and children as so desired pass out\r\nbetween the lines; again they yelled their refusal. Their end had come.\r\nThe detachment led by Major Brown at the top of the precipice, to\r\nprotect our retreat in case of necessity, had worked its way over to a\r\nhigh shelf of rock overlooking the enemy beneath, and began to tumble\r\ndown great bowlders, which speedily crushed the greater number of the\r\nApaches. The Indians on the San Carlos reservation still mourn\r\nperiodically for the seventy-six of their relatives who yielded up the\r\nghost that morning. Every warrior died at his post. The women and\r\nchildren had hidden themselves in the inner recesses of the cave, which\r\nwas of no great depth, and were captured and taken to Camp McDowell. A\r\nnumber of them had been struck by glancing bullets or fragments of\r\nfalling rock. As soon as our pack trains could be brought up, we mounted\r\nthe captives on our horses and mules and started for the nearest\r\nmilitary station, the one just named, over fifty miles away.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most decisive blows received by the hostiles. No\r\nmore murderous band had ever desolated the ranches of Southern Arizona.\r\nIt had been virtually wiped out by the troopers, who, complete as was\r\ntheir work, lost only a single man.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThis achievement may illustrate the manner in which the American\r\ntroopers did their work. A few days later a blow almost as destructive\r\nwas delivered at Turret Butte, and within a month a hundred and ten\r\nApaches in the Superstition Mountains surrendered to Major Brown and\r\naccompanied him to Camp Grant. The Indians understood the character of\r\nthe man who was pressing them so remorselessly. They offered to\r\nsurrender to General Crook, who told them that, if they would stop\r\nkilling people and live peaceful lives, he would teach them to work,\r\nfind a market for their products, and prove himself the truest friend\r\nthey could have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN WARRIOR.]\r\n\r\nThey accepted the offer, for they knew Crook could be trusted. Strange\r\nas it may appear, he had all the Apaches within a month at work digging\r\nditches, cutting hay and wood, planting vegetables, and as peaceful and\r\ncontented as so many farmers in the interior of one of our own States.\r\nThis transformation included all the Apaches in Arizona, excepting the\r\nChiricahuas, who were not within the jurisdiction of Crook.\r\n\r\nThe terrible scourge that had so long desolated the Southwest was gone,\r\nand all would have been well but for the vicious \"Indian Ring\" in\r\nWashington, or, as it was more popularly known, the \"Tucson Ring,\" who\r\nsecured legislation by which the 6,000 Apaches were ordered to leave the\r\nreservation and go to that of San Carlos, where the soil is arid, the\r\nwater brackish, and the flies make life intolerable. As was inevitable,\r\nthe Indians were exasperated and revolted. They preferred to be shot\r\ndown while resenting the injustice than to submit quietly to it. Again\r\nthe reign of terror opened, and the blood of hundreds of innocent people\r\npaid for the villainy of the rapacious miscreants who were beyond reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERONIMO, THE FAMOUS APACHE CHIEF.\r\n\r\nThe most famous chief of the Warm Spring Apaches was Geronimo. Another\r\nhardly less prominent was his cousin Chato, who joined the whites in\r\ntheir attempts to run down Geronimo. They professed to hate each other,\r\nbut there is ground for believing the two were secret allies, and kept\r\nup continual communication by which Geronimo was able to avoid his\r\npursuers and continue his fearful career.\r\n\r\nGeneral Crook took the saddle again, when Geronimo escaped from Fort\r\nApache in May, 1885, with a band of more than a hundred warriors, women,\r\nand children. They traveled one hundred and twenty miles before making\r\ntheir first camp. Try as they might, the cavalry could not get within\r\ngunshot, and, though the chase was pressed for hundreds of miles, the\r\nfugitives placed themselves beyond reach for a time in the Sierra Madre\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nBut Crook never let up, and finally corralled Geronimo. He held him just\r\none night, when he escaped. The wily leader stole back to camp the next\r\nnight, carried off his wife, and was beyond reach before pursuit could\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThere was an agreement between the United States and Mexico by which the\r\ntroops of the former were allowed to follow any marauding Indians beyond\r\nthe Rio Grande when they were seeking escape by entering Mexico. General\r\nH.W. Lawton (who won fame in Cuba during our late war with Spain and\r\nstill more in the Philippines) took the field with the Fourth Cavalry,\r\nMay 5, 1885. Lawton is a giant in stature and strength, with more\r\nendurance than an Indian, absolutely fearless, and he was resolute to\r\nrun down the Apaches, even if compelled to chase them to the city of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nAnd he did it. Geronimo was followed with such untiring persistency,\r\nlosing a number of his bucks in the attacks made on him, that in\r\ndesperation he crossed the Rio Grande and headed again for the Sierra\r\nMadre. A hot chase of two hundred miles brought the Apaches to bay, and\r\na brisk fight took place within the confines of Mexico. The Indians fled\r\nagain, and Lawton kept after them. The pursuit took the troopers 300\r\nmiles south of the boundary line, the trail winding in and out of the\r\nmountains and canyons of Sonora, repeatedly crossing and doubling upon\r\nitself, but all the time drawing nearer the dusky scourges, who at last\r\nwere so worn out and exhausted that when summoned to surrender they did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nGeronimo, one of the worst of all the Apaches, was once more a prisoner\r\nwith his band. But he had been a prisoner before, only to escape and\r\nrenew his outrages. So long as he was anywhere in the Southwest, the\r\nranchmen felt unsafe. Accordingly, he and his leading chiefs were sent\r\nto Fort Pickens, Florida, the others being forwarded to Fort Marion, St.\r\nAugustine. Their health after a time was affected, and they were removed\r\nto Mount Vernon, Alabama. The prisoners, including the women and\r\nchildren, number about 400. A school was opened, whither the boys and\r\ngirls were sent to receive instruction, and some of the brightest pupils\r\nin the well-known Indian School at Carlisle were the boys and girls\r\nwhose fathers were merciless raiders in Arizona only a few years ago,\r\nand who are now quiet, peaceful, contented, and \"good Indians.\" The\r\nApaches have been thoroughly conquered, and the ranchmen and their\r\nfamilies have not the shadow of a fear that the terror that once\r\nshadowed their thresholds can ever return.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1888.\r\n\r\nAlthough President Cleveland offended many of his party by his devotion\r\nto the policy of civil service reform, he was renominated in 1888, while\r\nthe nominee of the Republicans was Benjamin Harrison. Other tickets were\r\nplaced in the field, and the November election resulted as follows:\r\nGrover Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman, Democrats, 168 electoral votes;\r\nBenjamin Harrison and Levi P. Morton, Republicans, 233; Clinton B. Fisk\r\nand John A. Brooks, Prohibition, received 249,907 popular votes; Alson\r\nJ. Streeter and C.E. Cunningham, United Labor, 148,105; James L. Curtis\r\nand James R. Greer, American, 1,591.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN HARRISON. (1833-.) One term, 1889-1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-THIRD PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison was born at North Bend, Ohio, August 20, 1833. His\r\nfather was a farmer, and _his_ father was General William Henry\r\nHarrison, governor of the Northwest Territory, and afterward President\r\nof the United States, and the first to die in office. His father was\r\nBenjamin Harrison, one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Thus the twenty-third President possesses illustrious\r\nlineage.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison entered Miami University when a boy, and was graduated\r\nbefore the age of twenty. He studied law, and upon his admission to the\r\nbar settled in Indianapolis, which has since been his home. He\r\nvolunteered early in the war, and won the praise of Sheridan and other\r\nleaders for his gallantry and bravery. He was elected to the United\r\nStates Senate in 1881, and his ability placed him among the foremost\r\nleaders in that distinguished body. As a debater and off-hand speaker,\r\nhe probably has no superior, while his ability as a lawyer long ago\r\nplaced him in the very front rank of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOHNSTOWN DISASTER.\r\n\r\nThe Conemaugh Valley, in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, is about\r\ntwenty miles in length. The city of Johnstown lies thirty-nine miles\r\nwest-southwest of Altoona and seventy-eight miles east-by-south of\r\nPittsburg. It is the seat of the Cambria Iron Works, which give\r\nemployment to fully 6,000 men, and is one of the leading industrial\r\nestablishments of the country. Conemaugh Lake is at the head of the\r\nwinding valley, eighteen miles away, and was the largest reservoir of\r\nwater in the world. It was a mile and a half wide at its broadest part,\r\nand two miles and a half long. Most of the lake was a hundred feet deep.\r\nThe dam was a fifth of a mile wide, ninety feet thick at its base, and\r\none hundred and ten feet high. The mass of water thus held in restraint\r\nwas inconceivable.\r\n\r\nThe people living in the valley below had often reflected upon the\r\nappalling consequences if this dam should give way. Few persons\r\ncomprehend the mighty strength of water, whose pressure depends mainly\r\nupon its depth. A tiny stream, no thicker than a pipe-stem, can\r\npenetrate deeply enough into a mountain to split it apart, and, should\r\nthe reservoir ever burst its bounds, it would spread death and\r\ndesolation over miles of country below.\r\n\r\nThere had been several alarms, but the engineers sent to make an\r\nexamination of the dam always reported it safe, and the people, like\r\nthose who live at the base of a volcano, came to believe that all the\r\ndanger existed in their imagination.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May, 1889, the dam suddenly gave way, sliding from its\r\nbase, like an oiled piece of machinery, and the vast mass of water shot\r\nforward at the speed of more than two miles a minute. Seven minutes\r\nafter the bursting of the dam, the head of the resistless flood was\r\neighteen miles down the valley. A man on horseback had started, at a\r\ndead-run, some minutes before the catastrophe, shouting a warning to the\r\ninhabitants, some of whom, by instantly taking to flight up the\r\nmountain side, were able to save themselves, but the majority waited too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FURIOUS TORRENT.\r\n\r\nImagination cannot picture the awful power of this prodigious torrent.\r\nTrees were uptorn or flattened to the earth, houses, locomotives, and\r\nmassive machinery were tumbled over and over and bobbed about like so\r\nmany corks, and the flood struck Johnstown with the fury of a cyclone,\r\nsweeping everything before it, as if it were so much chaff. Tearing\r\nthrough the city and carrying with it thousands of tons of wreckage of\r\nevery description, it plunged down the valley till it reached the\r\nrailroad bridge below Johnstown. There, for the first time, it\r\nencountered an obstruction which it could not overcome. The structure\r\nstood as immovable as a solid mountain, and the furious torrent piled up\r\nthe debris for a mile in width and many feet in depth. In this mass were\r\nengines, houses, trees, furniture, household utensils, iron in all\r\nforms, while, winding in and out, were hundreds of miles of barbed wire,\r\nwhich knit the wreckage together. In many of the dwellings people were\r\nimprisoned, and before a step could be taken to relieve them fire broke\r\nout and scores were burned to death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN MOTHER AND INFANT.]\r\n\r\nHow many people lost their lives in the Johnstown flood will never be\r\nknown. The remains of bodies were found for months and even years\r\nafterward. The official list, when made up, was 2,280, of which 741\r\nbodies were unidentified; but there is little doubt that the loss was\r\nfully twice the number given. Nothing of the kind has ever before\r\noccurred in the history of our country, and it is to be hoped that such\r\na disaster will never be repeated.\r\n\r\nAgain the calamity awoke an instant sympathetic response. Provisions,\r\ntents, and money were sent to the sufferers from all parts of the Union,\r\nand nothing that could relieve them was neglected. Johnstown was soon\r\nrebuilt, and to-day there are no signs of the fearful visitation it\r\nreceived, only a comparatively short time since. On November 14, 1892,\r\nat the payment of the annuity provided for the orphans of Johnstown, the\r\nsum of $20,325 was distributed.\r\n\r\nWe came very near to having a war with Chili in the latter part of 1891.\r\nOn the 16th of October of that year, some forty men, attached to the\r\nAmerican warship _Baltimore_, lying in the harbor of Valparaiso,\r\nobtained leave to go ashore. Sailors at such times are as frolicksome as\r\nso many boys let out for a vacation, and it cannot be claimed that these\r\nJackies were models of order and quiet behavior. They were in uniform\r\nand without weapons.\r\n\r\nThey had been in the city only a short time, when one of them became\r\ninvolved in a wrangle with a Chilian. His companions went to his\r\nassistance whereupon a native mob quickly gathered and set upon them.\r\nThe Chilians detest Americans, and, seeing a chance to vent their\r\nfeelings, they did so with vindictive fury. They far outnumbered the\r\nsailors, and besides nearly every one of them was armed. The boatswain's\r\nmate of the _Baltimore_, Riggin by name, was killed and several\r\nseriously wounded, one of whom afterward died from his injuries.\r\nThirty-five of the Americans were arrested and thrown into prison, but\r\nas they could not be held upon any criminal charge they were released.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Baltimore_ was the present Rear-Admiral Schley, who\r\nrescued the Greely party of Arctic explorers, and gave so good an\r\naccount of himself, while in command of the _Brooklyn_, during the\r\ndestruction of Cervera's fleet off Santiago, July 3, 1898. When our\r\ngovernment learned of the affair, it directed Captain Schley to make a\r\nfull investigation. He did so, and his report left no doubt that the\r\nChilians had committed a gross outrage against our flag.\r\n\r\nThe next act of our government was to demand an apology from Chili and\r\nthe payment of an indemnity to the sufferers and to the families of\r\nthose who had been killed by the attack of the mob. Chili is a fiery\r\nnation, and her reply was so insolent that preparations were set on foot\r\nto bring her to terms by force of arms. At the moment, as may be said,\r\nwhen war impended, she sent an apology and forwarded a satisfactory\r\nindemnity, whereupon the flurry subsided.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT INDIAN WAR THREATENED IN 1890-1891.\r\n\r\nA still greater danger threatened the country in the winter of\r\n1890-1891, when we were menaced by the most formidable Indian uprising\r\nthat has ever occurred in the history of our country.\r\n\r\nIndian wars hitherto had been confined to certain localities, where, by\r\nthe prompt concentration of troops, they were speedily subdued; but in\r\nthe instance named the combination was among the leading and most\r\nwarlike tribes, who roamed over thousands of square miles of the\r\nNorthwest. A fact not generally suspected is that the red men of this\r\ncountry are as numerous to-day as they ever were. While certain tribes\r\nhave disappeared, others have increased in number, with the result that\r\nthe sentimental fancy that at some time in the future the red man will\r\ndisappear from the continent has no basis in fact. The probability is\r\nthat they will increase, though not so rapidly as their Caucasian\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nThe strongest tribe in the Northwest is the Sioux. It was they who\r\nperpetrated the massacres in Minnesota in 1862. If necessary they could\r\nplace 5,000 warriors in the field, with every man a brave and skillful\r\nfighter in his way. It was they, too, who overwhelmed Custer and his\r\ncommand on the Little Big Horn in June, 1876. When it is added that the\r\nsquaws are as vicious fighters as their husbands, it will be understood\r\nwhat a war with them means, especially since they have the help of\r\nneighboring tribes.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there have been two classes of Indians. The progressives\r\nfavor civilization, send their children to Carlisle and other schools,\r\nengage in farming, and, in short, are fully civilized. They remain on\r\ntheir reservation and give the government no trouble. Opposed to them\r\nare the barbarians, or untamable red men, who refuse to accept\r\ncivilization, hate the whites, and are ready to go to war on a slight\r\npretext, even though they know there can be but one result, which is\r\ntheir own defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are among the most superstitious people in the world. When,\r\ntherefore, a number of warriors appeared among them, dressed in white\r\nshirts, engaging in furious \"ghost dances,\" and declaring that the\r\nMessiah was about to revisit the earth, drive out the white men, and\r\nrestore the hunting grounds to the faithful Indians, the craze spread\r\nand the fanatical promises of the ghost dancers were eagerly accepted by\r\nthousands of red men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITTING BULL.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous Sioux Indian was the medicine man known as Sitting\r\nBull, already referred to in our account of the Custer massacre. He\r\nalways felt bitter against the whites, and had caused them a good deal\r\nof trouble. He saw in the ghost dance the opportunity for which he\r\nlonged, and he began urging his people to unite against their hereditary\r\nenemies, as he regarded them.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent that, unless he was restrained, he would cause\r\nthe worst kind of trouble, and it was determined to arrest him. The most\r\neffective officers employed against the men are the Indian police in the\r\nservice of the United States government. These people did not like\r\nSitting Bull, and hoped they would have trouble in arresting him, since\r\nit would give the pretext they wanted for shooting him.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull's camp was forty miles northwest of Fort Yates, North\r\nDakota, whither the Indian police rode on the morning of December 15,\r\n1890, with the United States cavalry lingering some distance in the\r\nrear. The taunts of Sitting Bull's boy Crowfoot caused him to offer\r\nresistance, and in a twinkling both parties began shooting. Sitting\r\nBull, his son, and six warriors were killed, while four of the Indian\r\npolice lost their lives, among them the one who had fired the fatal shot\r\nat the medicine man.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of Sitting Bull's command fled to the \"Bad Lands\"\r\nof Dakota, but a number were persuaded to return to Pine Ridge Agency.\r\nThere were so many, however, who refused to come in that the peril\r\nassumed the gravest character. The only way to bring about a real peace\r\nwas to compel the disarming of the Indians, for so long as they had\r\nweapons in their hands they were tempted to make use of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN AGENCY.]\r\n\r\nIt was the time for coolness, tact, and discretion, and the American\r\nofficers displayed it to a commendable degree. They carefully avoided\r\ngiving the Indians cause for offense, while insisting at the same time\r\nupon their being disarmed.\r\n\r\nOn December 28th, a band of malcontents were located near Wounded Knee\r\nCreek, by the Seventh Cavalry, who had been hunting several days for\r\nthem. They were sullen, but, when ordered to surrender their weapons,\r\nmade a pretense of doing so. Emerging from their tepees, however, they\r\nproduced only a few worthless weapons. Being sharply ordered to bring\r\nthe remainder, they suddenly wheeled and began firing upon the soldiers.\r\nIn an instant, a fierce fight was in progress, with the combatants\r\nstanding almost within arm's reach of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUAWS AS VICIOUS AS WILDCATS.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight soldiers were killed and thirty wounded, while fully as\r\nmany of the Indians were shot down. In the fighting, the squaws were as\r\nvicious as wildcats, and fought with as much effectiveness as the\r\nwarriors. A wounded officer was beaten to death by several of them\r\nbefore he could be rescued. Finally, the Indians fled and joined the\r\nmalcontents, already assembled in the Bad Lands.\r\n\r\nThis affair made the outlook still darker. The Seventh Cavalry had just\r\nreached camp on the morning of December 30th, when a courier dashed up\r\nto Pine Ridge, with word that the Catholic Mission building was on fire\r\nand the Indians were killing the teachers and pupils. The wearied\r\ntroopers galloped hurriedly thither, but found the burning building was\r\nthe day school, a mile nearer Pine Ridge. A strong force of Indians were\r\ngathered beyond, and the Seventh attacked them. The Sioux were so\r\nnumerous that the cavalry were in great danger of being surrounded, when\r\na vigorous attack by the Ninth Cavalry (colored) on the rear of the\r\nIndians scattered them.\r\n\r\nWarriors continued to slip away from the agency and join the hostiles.\r\nTheir signal fires were seen burning at night, and recruits came all the\r\nway from British America to help them. It was remarked at one time that\r\nthe only friendly Indians were the police, a few Cheyennes, and the\r\nscouts, including a few Sioux chiefs, among whom American Horse was the\r\nmost conspicuous. He never wavered in his loyalty to the whites, and\r\nboldly combated in argument his enemies, at the risk of being killed at\r\nany moment by his infuriated countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALARMING CLOUD DISSOLVED.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of skirmishes and considerable fighting, but General\r\nMiles, who assumed charge of all the military movements, displayed\r\nadmirable tact. When the Sioux began slowly coming toward the agency, it\r\nwas under orders from him that not a gun should be fired nor a\r\ndemonstration made except to repel an attack or to check a break on the\r\npart of the Indians. This course was followed, the troopers keeping at a\r\ngoodly distance behind the hostiles, who seemed more than once on the\r\npoint of wheeling about and assailing them, despite their promises to\r\ncome into the agency and surrender their arms.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, however, kept their pledge, and, on the 15th of January,\r\n1891, the immense cavalcade entered the agency. Everyone was amazed at\r\nthe strength displayed by the Indians, which was far greater than\r\nsupposed. In the procession were 732 lodges, and careful estimates made\r\nthe whole number 11,000, of whom 3,000 were warriors. Had these red men\r\nbroken loose and started upon the war trail, the consequences would have\r\nbeen frightful.\r\n\r\nWhile the weapons turned in by the Indians were only a few in number and\r\nof poor quality, General Miles was satisfied the trouble was over and\r\nissued a congratulatory address to those under his command. His opinion\r\nof the situation proved correct, and the alarming war cloud that had\r\nhung over the Northwest melted and dissolved. While there have been\r\nslight troubles in different parts of the country since, none assumed a\r\nserious character, and it is believed impossible that ever again the\r\nperil of 1890-91 can threaten the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF NEW STATES.\r\n\r\nSeveral States were admitted to the Union during Harrison's\r\nadministration. The first were North and South Dakota, which became\r\nStates in November, 1889. The Dakotas originally formed part of the\r\nLouisiana purchase. The capital was first established at Yankton in\r\nMarch, 1862, but was removed to Bismarck in 1883. The two States\r\nseparated in 1889.\r\n\r\nIn November of the latter year Montana was admitted, and in July\r\nfollowing Idaho and Wyoming. Montana was a part of Idaho Territory until\r\nMay, 1864, when it was organized as a separate Territory. Idaho itself\r\nwas a part Of Oregon Territory until 1863, and, when first formed, was\r\nmade up of portions of Oregon, Washington, Utah, and Nebraska. The\r\nboundaries were changed in 1864 and a part added to Montana. Wyoming\r\ngained its name from the settlers who went thither from Wyoming Valley,\r\nPennsylvania. It first became a Territory in 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1892.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans renominated President Harrison in 1892, with Whitelaw\r\nReid the candidate for Vice-President, while the Democrats put forward\r\nex-President Cleveland and Adlai E. Stevenson. The result of the\r\nelection was as follows:\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland and Adlai E. Stevenson, Democrats, 277 electoral votes;\r\nBenjamin Harrison and Whitelaw Reid, Republicans, 144. Of the popular\r\nvote, James B. Weaver and James G. Field, People's Party, received\r\n1,041,028 votes; John Bidwell and James B. Cranfil, Prohibition,\r\n264,133; and Simon Wing and Charles M. Matchett, Social Labor, 21,164\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HERO OF THE STRIKE, COAL CREEK, TENN. In 1892 a\r\nperiod of great labor agitation began, lasting for several years. One of\r\nthe most heroic figures of those troublous times is Colonel Anderson,\r\nunder a flag of truce, meeting the infuriated miners at Coal Creek.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF CLEVELAND (SECOND), 1893-1897.\r\n\r\nRepeal of the Purchase Clause of the Sherman Bill--The World's Columbian\r\nExposition at Chicago--The Hawaiian Imbroglio--The Great Railroad Strike\r\nof 1894--Coxey's Commonweal Army--Admission of Utah--Harnessing of\r\nNiagara--Dispute with England Over Venezuela's Boundary--Presidential\r\nElection of 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPEAL OF THE PURCHASE CLAUSE OF THE SHERMAN BILL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY MOORE TELLER. Senator from Colorado. The most\r\nprominent among the \"Silver Senators.\"]\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland was the first President of the United States who had an\r\ninterval between his two terms. His inauguration was succeeded by a\r\nfinancial stringency, which appeared in the summer and autumn of 1893.\r\nThere seemed to be a weakening of general confidence in all parts of the\r\ncountry, and much suffering followed, especially in the large cities,\r\ngreatly relieved, however, by the well-ordered system of charity. Many\r\npeople thought that one cause of the trouble was the Sherman Bill, which\r\nprovided for a large monthly coinage of silver. Congress was convened in\r\nextraordinary session August 7th by the President, who recommended that\r\nbody to repeal the purchase clause of the Sherman act. Such a repeal was\r\npromptly passed by the House, but met with strong opposition in the\r\nSenate. There is less curb to debate in that branch of Congress, and the\r\nsenators from the silver States, like Colorado, Idaho and Nevada, where\r\nthe mining of silver is one of the most important industries, did what\r\nthey could to delay legislation. Some of the speeches were spun out for\r\ndays, with no other purpose than to discourage the friends of the\r\nmeasure by delaying legislation. Finally, however, a vote was reached\r\nOctober 30th, when the bill passed and was immediately signed by the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThe most notable event of Cleveland's second administration was the\r\nWorld's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago. Properly the four\r\nhundredth anniversary of the discovery of America should have taken\r\nplace in 1892, but the preparations were on so grand a scale that they\r\ncould not be completed in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Model of U.S. Man of War Built for exhibit at Worlds\r\nFair.]\r\n\r\nThe part of the government in this memorable celebration was opened by a\r\nstriking naval parade or review of the leading war-ships of the world.\r\nThey assembled at Hampton Roads, Virginia, coming from points of the\r\nglobe thousands of miles apart. Steaming northward to New York, the\r\nreview took place April 27, 1893. In addition to the thirty-five\r\nwar-ships, there were the three Columbian caravels sent by Spain and\r\npresented to the United States. When ranged in two lines on the Hudson,\r\nthese ships extended for three miles, and represented, besides our own\r\ncountry, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Brazil,\r\nHolland, and Argentina. The steel-clad yacht _Dolphin_ steamed between\r\nthese two lines, bearing President Cleveland and his cabinet, while each\r\nship as she came opposite thundered her salute. No conqueror of ancient\r\nor modern times ever received so magnificent a tribute.\r\n\r\nChicago, having won the prize of the location of the World's Fair,\r\nselected the site on the 2d of July, 1890. This covered nearly 700\r\nacres of beautiful laid-out grounds and parks, extending from the point\r\nnearest the city, two and a half miles, to the southern extremity of\r\nJackson Park. The site selected by the directors was the section known\r\nas Jackson Park and the Midway Plaisance. The park has a frontage of one\r\nand a half miles on Lake Michigan and contains 600 acres, while the\r\nMidway Plaisance, connecting Jackson and Washington Parks, afforded\r\neighty-five acres more. It is 600 feet wide and a mile in length. Since\r\nworld's fairs have become a favorite among nations, the following\r\nstatistics will give a correct idea of the vastness of the one held in\r\nChicago, from May 1 to November 1, 1893:\r\n\r\n  London,       1857,  21-1/2 acres occupied;  17,000 exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts, $1,780,000\r\n\r\n  Paris,        1855,  24-1/2   \"      \"       22,000 exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  6,441,200\r\n\r\n  London,       1862,  23-1/2   \"      \"       28,633  exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  1,644,260\r\n\r\n  Paris,        1867,  37       \"      \"       52,000  exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  2,103,675\r\n\r\n  Vienna,       1873, 280       \"      \"      142,000   exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  6,971,832\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia, 1876, 236       \"      \"       30,864   exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  3,813,724\r\n\r\n  Paris,        1878, 100       \"      \"       40,366   exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  2,531,650\r\n\r\n  Paris,        1889, 173       \"      \"       55,000   exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  8,300,000\r\n\r\n  Chicago,      1893, 645       \"      \"       65,422   exhibitors;\r\n    total receipts,  33,290,065\r\n\r\nThe countries which made generous appropriations for exhibits were:\r\nArgentine Republic, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa\r\nRica, Denmark, Danish West Indies, Ecuador, France, Germany, Great\r\nBritain, Barbadoes, British Guiana, British Honduras, Canada, Cape\r\nColony, Ceylon, India, Jamaica, Leeward Islands, New South Wales, New\r\nZealand, Trinidad, Greece, Guatemala, Hawaii, Honduras, Haiti, Japan,\r\nLiberia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Dutch Guiana, Dutch West Indies,\r\nNicaragua, Norway, Orange Free State, Paraguay, Peru, Russia, Salvador,\r\nSan Domingo, Spain, Cuba, Sweden, Uruguay.\r\n\r\nAll the States in the Union entered heartily into the scheme, their\r\ntotal appropriations amounting to $6,000,000. The original plan called\r\nfor ten main buildings: Manufactures, Administration, Machinery,\r\nAgriculture, Electricity, Mines, Transportation, Horticulture,\r\nFisheries, and the Venetian Village; but there were added: the Art\r\nGalleries, the Woman's Building, the Forestry, Dairy, Stock, Pavilion,\r\nTerminal Station, Music Hall, Peristyle, Casino, Choral,\r\nAnthropological, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe grounds and buildings were opened October 21, 1892, with appropriate\r\nceremonies by Vice-President Morton and other distinguished citizens.\r\nThe most important exhibits were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Transportation Building displayed about everything that could be\r\npossibly used in transportation, from the little baby-carriage to the\r\nponderous locomotive. The progress of ship-building from its infancy to\r\nthe present was shown, among the exhibits being an accurate model of the\r\n_Santa Maria_, the principal ship of Columbus, which was wrecked in the\r\nWest Indies, on his first voyage. The Bethlehem steam hammer, the\r\nlargest in the world, was ninety-one feet high and weighed 125 tons.\r\n\r\nAmong the locomotives were the \"Mississippi,\" built in England in 1834;\r\na model of Stephenson's \"Rocket;\" a steam carriage, used in France in\r\n1759; and a model of Trevithick's locomotive of 1803. There were also\r\nthe first cable car built, the boat and steam fixtures made and\r\nnavigated by Captain John Stevens in 1804, and the \"John Bull,\" used on\r\nthe Camden and Amboy Railroad, and which, it is claimed, is the oldest\r\nlocomotive in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINERY HALL.]\r\n\r\nThe exhibit in the Mines and Mining Building were divided into 123\r\nclasses, including cement from Heidelberg, mosaics in Carlsbad stone,\r\nFrench asphalt specimens, French work in gold, platinum, and aluminum,\r\nsilver and ores from nearly every part of the world, and ores from\r\ndifferent sections of our own country.\r\n\r\nThe Government Building was specially attractive, with its exhibits of\r\nthe several departments of the United States government. A case of\r\nhumming birds contained 133 varieties, and in another case were\r\nrepresented 106 families of American birds. There were stuffed fowls,\r\nflamingoes, nests, Rocky Mountain goats and sheep, armadilloes from\r\nTexas, sea otters, American bisons, a Pacific walrus, 300 crocodiles of\r\nthe Nile, crocodile birds, fishes and reptiles, and an almost endless\r\ndisplay of coins and metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Department of Ethnology contained figures of Eskemos and specimens\r\nof their industry, Canadian Indians, Indian wigwam, ancient pottery,\r\nmodels of ruins found in Arizona, a brass lamp used at a feast 169 years\r\nbefore Christ; scrolls of the law of Tarah, made in the tenth century in\r\nAsia; silver spice-box of the time of Christ; phylacteries, used by the\r\nJews at morning prayers, except on Saturday; knife used by priests in\r\nslaying animals for sacrifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the State Department thousands of people gazed with awe upon what was\r\nbelieved to be the original Declaration of Independence as it came from\r\nthe hand of Thomas Jefferson. It was, however, only a close copy, since\r\nthe government under no circumstances will permit the original to leave\r\nthe archives at Washington. But among the original papers were the\r\npetition of the United Colonies to George III., presented by Benjamin\r\nFranklin in 1774; the original journal of the Continental Congress;\r\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation; an autograph letter of George III.;\r\nand various proclamations issued by Presidents, with their autographs\r\nand letters, by Washington, Franklin, the Adamses, Jefferson, Madison,\r\nPolk, Van Buren, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Arthur, and Hayes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL HISTORIC RELICS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting historic papers were letters penned by Napoleon,\r\nAlexander of Russia, and other foreign potentates, the Webster-Ashburton\r\ntreaty signed by Queen Victoria, and a shark's tooth sent as a treaty by\r\nthe king of Samoa. Precious relics were Washington's commission as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the colonial forces, his sword, his diary, and his\r\naccount books and army reports; the sash with which Lafayette bound up\r\nhis wound at Brandywine; the calumet pipe which Washington smoked when\r\nseventeen years old; Benjamin Franklin's cane; the sword of General\r\nJackson; a waistcoat embroidered by Marie Antoinette; wampum made before\r\nthe discovery of America; camp service of pewter used by Washington\r\nthroughout the Revolution; Bible brought over by John Alden in the\r\n_Mayflower_; and a piece of torch carried by \"Old Put\" (General Israel\r\nPutnam) into the den of the wolf which he killed.\r\n\r\nA section of one of the big trees of California was 20 feet in diameter\r\nat the top and 26 feet at the base.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful sufferings of persons imprisoned for debt in England, which\r\nled to the founding of Georgia, were recalled by a warrant for the\r\narrest and imprisonment of one of the unfortunates, issued in 1721.\r\n\r\nThere also were to be seen a page from the Plymouth records of 1620 and\r\n1621; a land patent of 1628; the royal commission creating the common\r\npleas court of Massachusetts in 1696; a page from the horrible\r\nwitchcraft trials in Salem in 1692; a door-knocker brought to this\r\ncountry in the _Mayflower_; and portraits of many historical persons.\r\n\r\nIn the War Department were shown a six-pounder bronze gun presented by\r\nLafayette to the colonial forces; the four-pounder gun that fired the\r\nfirst shot in the Civil War; the rifled gun that fired the last shot;\r\ncannon used in the Mexican War; cast-iron cannon found in the Hudson\r\nRiver; Chinese cannon captured at Corea; cannon captured at Yorktown;\r\nboot-legs from which the starving members of the Greely Arctic\r\nexpedition made soup; relics of Sir John Franklin; a wagon used by\r\nGeneral Sherman throughout all his marches; the sacred shirt worn by\r\nSitting Bull at the time of the massacre of Custer and his command on\r\nthe Little Big Horn.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHIBITS OF THE TREASURY AND POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn the Treasury Department was represented the United States Mint in\r\noperation, besides historic medals, ancient and modern coins, including\r\nthose of foreign countries, a ten-thousand gold dollar certificate and a\r\nsilver certificate of the same denomination.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the philatelists sparkled at the treasures in the Postoffice\r\nDepartment, which included all the issues of stamps from 1847 to 1893.\r\nSome of the single stamps were worth thousands of dollars, and it would\r\nhave required a fortune to purchase the whole collection, had it been\r\nfor sale. The methods of carrying the mail were illustrated by a\r\nrepresentation of dogs drawing a sled over the snow and a Rocky Mountain\r\nstage-coach. It would require volumes to convey an intelligent idea of\r\nthe display in the Patent Office, Interior Department, Geological\r\nSurvey, Agricultural Department, and the United States Commission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS A. EDISON.\r\n\r\n(1847-.)]\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that wonderful discoveries have been made in\r\nelectricity, and no doubt we are close upon still greater ones. The name\r\nof Edison is connected with the marvelous achievements in this field,\r\nand there was much food for thought and speculation in the exhibits of\r\nthe Electricity Building. These, while profoundly interesting, were\r\nmainly so in their hints of what are coming in the near future.\r\n\r\nMachinery Hall was a favorite with thousands of the visitors. The\r\nexhibits were so numerous that they were divided into eighty-six\r\nclasses, grouped into:\r\n\r\n1. Motors and apparatus for the generation and transmission of power,\r\nhydraulic and pneumatic apparatus.\r\n\r\n2. Fire-engines, apparatus and appliances for extinguishing fire.\r\n\r\n3. Machine tools and machines for working metals.\r\n\r\n4. Machinery for the manufacture of textile fabrics and clothing.\r\n\r\n5. Machines for working wood.\r\n\r\n6. Machines and apparatus for type-setting, printing, stamping and\r\nembossing, and for making books and paper making.\r\n\r\n7. Lithography, zincography, and color painting.\r\n\r\n8. Photo-mechanical and other mechanical processes for illustrating,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n9. Miscellaneous hand-tools, machines and apparatus used in various\r\narts.\r\n\r\n10. Machines for working stones, clay, and other minerals.\r\n\r\n11. Machinery used in the preparation of foods, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NOTABLE EXHIBITS.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the model of the Convent of Santa Maria de la Rabida, where\r\nthe wearied Columbus stopped to crave food for himself and boy, was\r\n$50,000. The relics of the great explorer were numerous and of vivid\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nHardly less interesting was the reproduction of the Viking ship\r\nunearthed in a burial mound in Norway in 1880, the model being precisely\r\nthat of the vessels in which the hardy Norsemen navigators crossed the\r\nAtlantic a thousand years ago. It was seventy-six feet in length, the\r\nbow ornamented with a large and finely carved dragon's head and the\r\nstern with a dragon's tail. Rows of embellished shields ran along the\r\noutside of the bulwarks, and all was open except a small deck fore and\r\naft, while two water-tight compartments gave protection to the men in\r\nstormy weather. The rigging consisted of one mast with a single yard,\r\nthat could be readily taken down, but there were places for immense\r\noars, whose handling must have required tremendous muscular power.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Building had an almost endless variety of articles,\r\nsuch as cocoa, chocolate, and drugs from the Netherlands; wood pulp from\r\nSweden; odd-looking shoes and agricultural products from Denmark and\r\nfrom France, the most striking of which was the Menier chocolate tower\r\nthat weighed fifty tons; fertilizers and products from Uruguay; an\r\nelephant tusk seven and a half feet long; woods, wools, and feathers\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope; a Zulu six feet and seven and a half inches\r\ntall; a Canadian cheese weighing eleven tons, with other exhibits from\r\nvarious countries, and specimens of what are grown in most of our own\r\nStates. The articles were so numerous that a list is too lengthy to be\r\ninserted in these pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIKING SHIP.\r\n\r\n1. Appearance when discovered. 2. After restoration. 3. Rudder, shield,\r\nand dragon-head.]\r\n\r\nThe Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building was of such unprecedented\r\nsize that its ground area was more than thirty acres, and its gallery\r\nspace forty-four acres. Its roof structure surpassed any ever made, and\r\nit was the largest building in the world. So vast indeed was it that it\r\nis worth our while to impress it upon our minds by several comparisons.\r\nAny church in Chicago, which contains numerous large ones, can be placed\r\nin the vestibule of St. Peter's at Rome, but the latter is only\r\none-third of the size of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building. The\r\nColiseum of ancient Rome would seat 80,000 persons, but in the central\r\nhall of the Chicago building, which is a single room without a\r\nsupporting column, 75,000 people could be comfortably seated, while the\r\nbuilding itself would seat 300,000 persons. The iron and steel in the\r\nroof would build two Brooklyn bridges, and it required eleven acres of\r\nglass to provide for the skylights. In its construction 17,000,000 feet\r\nof lumber, 13,000,000 pounds of steel, and 2,000,000 pounds of iron were\r\nused, with a total cost of $1,700,000. The ground plan was twice the\r\nsize of the pyramid of Cheops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have recorded enough, however, to give some idea of the wealth of\r\ntreasures exhibited at Chicago in 1893, and which drew visitors from all\r\nparts of the world. It is not worth while to refer at length to the\r\ndisplay of the foreign countries, for those who had the pleasure of\r\nlooking upon them will always carry their pleasant memory, while those\r\nwho were deprived of the privilege can gain no adequate idea from the\r\nmost extended description. The Midway Plaisance was a unique feature,\r\nwith its Hungarian Orpheum, Lapland Village, Dahomey Village, the\r\ncaptive balloon, Chinese Village, Austrian Village, Cyclorama of the\r\nvolcano of Kilauea, the Algerian and Tunisian Village, the Ferris Wheel,\r\nthe never-to-be-forgotten street in Cairo, the numerous natives, and\r\nother scenes that were not always on the highest plane of morality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND WORK BY THE STATES.\r\n\r\nWe as Americans are prone to forget some of the important events in our\r\nhistory. The memory of them fades too soon. A hundred, years must pass\r\nbefore our country will look upon another Columbian Exposition. That, in\r\nthe nature of things, will surpass the one in 1893, as far as that\r\nsurpassed the ordinary country fairs of our grandparents. When that\r\ngreat year--1992--comes around, none of us will be here to look upon its\r\nwonders. It seems proper, therefore, that, in dismissing the subject, we\r\nshould place on record the amount contributed by each State, without\r\nwhich the grand success of the enterprise could never have been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n  Alabama.................. $38,000  Nebraska................. $85,000\r\n  Arizona..................  30,000  Nevada...................  10,000\r\n  Arkansas.................  55,000  New Hampshire............  25,000\r\n  California............... 550,000  New Jersey............... 130,000\r\n  Colorado................. 167,000  New Mexico...............  35,000\r\n  Connecticut..............  75,000  New York................. 600,000\r\n  Delaware.................  20,000  North Carolina...........  45,000\r\n  Florida..................  50,000  North Dakota.............  70,000\r\n  Georgia.................. 100,000  Ohio..................... 200,000\r\n  Idaho.................... 100,000  Oklahoma.................  17,500\r\n  Illinois................. 800,000  Oregon...................  60,000\r\n  Indiana.................. 135,000  Pennsylvania............. 360,000\r\n  Iowa..................... 130,000  Rhode Island.............  57,500\r\n  Kansas................... 165,000  South Carolina...........  50,000\r\n  Kentucky................. 175,000  South Dakota.............  85,000\r\n  Louisiana................  36,000  Tennessee................  25,000\r\n  Maine....................  57,000  Texas....................  40,000\r\n  Maryland.................  60,000  Utah.....................  50,600\r\n  Massachusetts............ 175,000  Vermont..................  39,750\r\n  Michigan................. 275,000  Virginia.................  75,000\r\n  Minnesota................ 150,000  Washington............... 100,000\r\n  Mississippi..............  25,000  West Virginia............  40,000\r\n  Missouri................. 150,000  Wisconsin................ 212,000\r\n  Montana.................. 100,000  Wyoming..................  30,000\r\n                                                            ----------\r\n                                       Total................$6,060,350\r\n\r\nThe islands composing the group known under the general name of Hawaii\r\nhave long been of interest to different nations, and especially to our\r\ncountry. A treaty was made in 1849 between Hawaii and the United States,\r\nwhich provided for commerce and the extradition of criminals, and in\r\n1875 a reciprocity treaty was concluded. This gave a marked impetus to\r\nthe sugar industry, which was almost wholly in the hands of foreigners.\r\nFurther treaty rights were confirmed by Congress in 1891.\r\n\r\nDavid Kalakaua became king of Hawaii in 1874. He had slight ability, and\r\nwas fonder of the pleasures of life than of measures for the good of his\r\ncountry and subjects. He was displeased to see the hold gained by\r\nforeigners in his country and their rapidly growing power. He joined\r\nwith the native Legislature in its cry of \"Hawaii for the Hawaiians,\"\r\nand did all he could to check the material progress of the islands.\r\nProgressive men, however, gained control, and in 1887 Kalakaua was\r\ncompelled to sign a new constitution which deprived him of all but a\r\nshadow of authority. The white residents were granted the right of\r\nsuffrage and closer relations were established with the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in negotiating a treaty with our country Kalakaua died, in\r\n1891, in San Francisco, and his sister, Liliuokalani, succeeded him as\r\nqueen. She was much of the same mould as her brother, but of a more\r\nrevengeful nature. She was angered against the foreigners and the\r\nprogressive party, and alert for an opportunity to strike them a fatal\r\nblow. She thought the time had come in January, 1893, when the leading\r\nparty was bitterly divided over important measures. She summoned the\r\nLegislature and urged it to adopt a new constitution, which took away\r\nthe right of suffrage from the white residents and restored to the crown\r\nthe many privileges that had been taken from it. She was so radical in\r\nher policy that her friends induced her to modify it in several\r\nrespects. She was thoroughly distrusted by the white residents, who did\r\nnot doubt that she would break all her promises the moment the pretext\r\noffered. Nor would they have been surprised if a general massacre of the\r\nwhite inhabitants were ordered.\r\n\r\nSo deep-seated was the alarm that the American residents appealed for\r\nprotection to the United States man-of-war _Boston_, which was lying in\r\nthe harbor of Honolulu. The commander landed a company of marines,\r\nagainst the protest of the queen's minister of foreign affairs and the\r\ngovernor of the island, although they were assured that no attempt would\r\nbe made to interfere with their rights. In the face of this assurance, a\r\nrevolt took place, the monarchy was declared at an end, and a\r\nprovisional government was organized, to continue until terms of union\r\nwith the United States could be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nMore decided steps followed. On February 1, 1894, the government was\r\nformally placed under the protectorate of the United States, and the\r\nStars and Stripes was hoisted over the government building by a party of\r\nmarines. There was a strong sentiment in favor of annexation, and the\r\nAmerican minister was highly pleased.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was of the same mind, and authorized the presence on\r\nthe island of troops that might be needed to protect the lives and\r\nproperty of Americans there, but he disavowed the protectorate. No\r\ndoubt, however, he favored the movement, but thought it wise to \"make\r\nhaste slowly.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time, a treaty was framed which was acceptable to the\r\nPresident. It provided that the government of Hawaii should remain as it\r\nwas, the supreme power to be vested in a commissioner of the United\r\nStates, with the right to veto any of the acts of the local government.\r\nThe public debt was to be assumed by the United States, while\r\nLiliuokalani was to be pensioned at the rate of $20,000 a year, and her\r\ndaughter was to receive $150,000. President Harrison urged upon the\r\nSenate the ratification of the treaty, fearing that delay would induce\r\nsome other power to step in and take the prize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES G. BLAINE.\r\n\r\n(1830-1893.)\r\n\r\nSecretary of State under Harrison's administration.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S CHANGE OF POLICY.\r\n\r\nSuch was the status when President Cleveland came into office on the 4th\r\nof March, 1893. His views were the very opposite of his predecessor's,\r\nand he took steps to enforce them. He maintained there would have been\r\nno revolution in Hawaii had not the force of marines landed from the\r\n_Boston_. He withdrew the proposed treaty from the Senate, and sent\r\nJames H. Blount, of Georgia, to Hawaii as special commissioner to make\r\nan investigation of all that had occurred, and to act in harmony with\r\nthe views of the President. On the 1st of April, Blount caused the\r\nAmerican flag to be hauled down, and formally dissolved the\r\nprotectorate. Minister Stevens was recalled and succeeded by Mr. Blount\r\nas minister plenipotentiary. Steps were taken to restore Liliuokalani,\r\nand her own brutal stubbornness was all that prevented. She was\r\ndetermined to have the lives of the leaders who had deposed her, and to\r\nbanish their families. This could not be permitted, and the Dole\r\ngovernment refused the request to yield its authority to the queen.\r\n\r\nThe situation brought President Cleveland to a standstill, for he had\r\nfirst to obtain the authority of Congress in order to use force, and\r\nthat body was so opposed to his course that it would never consent to\r\naid him. The provisional government grew stronger, and speedily\r\nsuppressed a rebellion that was set on foot by the queen. It won the\r\nrespect of its enemies by showing clemency to the plotters, when it\r\nwould have been legally justified in putting the leaders to death. The\r\nqueen was arrested, whereupon she solemnly renounced for herself and\r\nheirs all claim to the throne, urged her subjects to do the same, and\r\ndeclared her allegiance to the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNEXATION OF HAWAII.\r\n\r\nLet us anticipate a few events. In May, 1898, Representative Newlands\r\nintroduced into the House a resolution providing for the annexation of\r\nHawaii. Considerable opposition developed in the Senate, but the final\r\nvote was carried, July 6th, by 42 to 21. The President appointed as\r\nmembers of the commission, Senators Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois; John\r\nT. Morgan, of Alabama; Representative Robert R. Hitt, of Illinois; and\r\nPresident Dole and Chief Justice Judd, of the Hawaiian Republic. All the\r\ncongressmen named were members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe news of the admission of Hawaii to the Union was received in the\r\nislands with great rejoicing. A salute of one hundred guns was fired on\r\nthe Executive Building grounds at Honolulu, and the formal transfer,\r\nAugust 12th, was attended with appropriate ceremonies. A full\r\ndescription of these interesting islands, their history and their\r\nproducts, will be found in Chapter XXVI. of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT RAILROAD STRIKE OF 1894.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest railroad strikes in this country occurred in the\r\nsummer of 1894. Early in the spring of that year, the Pullman Car\r\nCompany, whose works are near Chicago, notified their employes that they\r\nhad to choose between accepting a reduction in their wages or having the\r\nworks closed. They accepted the cut, although the reduction was from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty per cent. of what they had been receiving.\r\n\r\nWhen May came, the distressed workmen declared it impossible for them\r\nand their families to live on their meagre pay. They demanded a\r\nrestoration of the old rates; but the company refused, affirming that\r\nthey were running the business at a loss and solely with a view of\r\nkeeping the men at work. On the 11th of May, 3,000 workmen, a majority\r\nof the whole number, quit labor and the company closed their works.\r\n\r\nThe American Railway Union assumed charge of the strike and ordered a\r\nboycott of all Pullman cars. Eugene V. Debs was the president of the\r\nUnion, and his sweeping order forbade all engineers, brakemen, and\r\nswitchmen to handle the Pullman cars on every road that used them. This\r\nwas far-reaching, since the Pullman cars are used on almost every line\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nA demand was made upon the Pullman Company to submit the question to\r\narbitration, but the directors refused on the ground that there was\r\nnothing to arbitrate, the question being whether or not they were to be\r\npermitted to operate their own works for themselves. A boycott was\r\ndeclared on all roads running out of Chicago, beginning on the Illinois\r\nCentral. Warning was given to every road handling the Pullman cars that\r\nits employes would be called out, and, if that did not prove effective,\r\nevery trade in the country would be ordered to strike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies were under heavy bonds to draw the Pullman cars,\r\nand it would have cost large sums of money to break their contracts.\r\nThey refused to boycott, and, on June 26th, President Debs declared a\r\nboycott on twenty-two roads running out of Chicago, and ordered the\r\ncommittees representing the employes to call out the workmen without an\r\nhour's unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nThe strike rapidly spread. Debs urged the employes to refrain from\r\ninjuring the property of their employers, but such advice is always\r\nthrown away. Very soon rioting broke out, trains were derailed, and men\r\nwho attempted to take the strikers' places were savagely maltreated.\r\nThere was such a general block of freight that prices of the necessaries\r\nof life rose in Chicago and actual suffering impended. So much property\r\nwas destroyed that the companies called on the city and county\r\nauthorities for protection. The men sent to cope with the strikers were\r\ntoo few, and when Governor Altgeld forwarded troops to the scenes of the\r\noutbreaks, they also were too weak, and many of the militia openly\r\nshowed their sympathy with the mob.\r\n\r\nGrowing bolder, the strikers checked the mails and postal service and\r\nresisted deputy marshals. This brought the national government into the\r\nquarrel, since it is bound to provide for the safe transmission of the\r\nmails. On July 2d a Federal writ was issued covering the judicial\r\ndistrict of northern Illinois, forbidding all interference with the\r\nUnited States mails and with interstate railway commerce. Several\r\nleaders of the strike were arrested, whereat the mob became more\r\nthreatening than ever. The government having been notified that Federal\r\ntroops were necessary to enforce the orders of the courts in Chicago, a\r\nstrong force of cavalry, artillery, and infantry was sent thither.\r\nGovernor Altgeld protested, and President Cleveland told him in effect\r\nto attend to his own business and sent more troops to the Lake City.\r\n\r\nThere were several collisions between the mob and military, in which a\r\nnumber of the former were killed. Buildings were fired, trains ditched,\r\nand the violence increased, whereupon the President dispatched more\r\ntroops thither, with the warning that if necessary he would call out the\r\nwhole United States army to put down the law-breakers.\r\n\r\nThe strike, which was pressed almost wholly by foreigners, was not\r\nconfined to Chicago. A strong antipathy is felt toward railroads in\r\nCalifornia, owing to what some believe have been the wrongful means\r\nemployed by such corporations on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nThere were ugly outbreaks in Los Angeles, Oakland, and Sacramento, the\r\ndifficulty being intensified by the refusal of the militia to act\r\nagainst the strikers. A force of regular soldiers, while hurrying over\r\nthe railroad to the scene of the disturbance, was ditched by the\r\nstrikers and several killed and badly hurt. The incensed soldiers were\r\neager for a chance to reach the strikers, but they were under fine\r\ndiscipline and their officers showed great self-restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE STRIKE.\r\n\r\nThe course of all violent strikes is short. The savage acts repel\r\nwhatever sympathy may have been felt for the workingmen at first. Few of\r\nthe real sufferers took part in the turbulent acts. It was the\r\nforeigners and the desperate men who used the grievances as a pretext\r\nfor their outlawry, in which they were afraid to indulge at other times.\r\nThen, too, the stern, repressive measures of President Cleveland had a\r\nsalutary effect. Many labor organizations when called upon to strike\r\nreplied with expressions of sympathy, but decided to keep at work.\r\nPresident Debs, Vice-President Howard, and other prominent members of\r\nthe American Railway Union were arrested, July 10th, on the charge of\r\nobstructing the United States mails and interfering with the execution\r\nof the laws of the United States. A number--forty-three in all--was\r\nindicted by the Federal grand jury, July 19th, and the bonds were fixed\r\nat $10,000 each. Bail was offered, but they declined to accept it and\r\nwent to jail. On December 14th, Debs was sentenced to six months'\r\nimprisonment for contempt, the terms of the others being fixed at three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nOn August 5th, the general committee of strikers officially declared the\r\nstrike at an end in Chicago, and their action was speedily imitated\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOXEY'S COMMONWEAL ARMY.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable appeals made directly to the law-making\r\npowers by the unemployed was that of Coxey's \"Commonweal Army.\" Despite\r\nsome of its grotesque features, it was deserving of more sympathy than\r\nit received, for it represented a pitiful phase of human poverty and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was that of J.S. Coxey, of Massillon, Ohio, who left that\r\ntown on the 25th of March, 1894, with some seventy-five men. They\r\ncarried no weapons, and believed they would gather enough recruits on\r\nthe road to number 100,000 by the time they reached Washington, where\r\ntheir demands made directly upon Congress would be so imposing that that\r\nbody would not dare refuse them. They intended to ask for the passage of\r\ntwo acts: the first to provide for the issue of $500,000,000 in\r\nlegal-tender notes, to be expended under the direction of the secretary\r\nof war at the rate of $20,000,000 monthly, in the construction of roads\r\nin different parts of the country; the second to authorize any State,\r\ncity, or village to deposit in the United States treasury\r\nnon-interest-bearing bonds, not exceeding in amount one-half the\r\nassessed valuation of its property, on which the secretary of the\r\ntreasury should issue legal-tender notes.\r\n\r\nThis unique enterprise caused some misgiving, for it was feared that\r\nsuch an immense aggregation of the unemployed would result in turbulence\r\nand serious acts of violence. Few could restrain sympathy for the object\r\nof the \"army,\" while condemning the means adopted to make its purpose\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThe result, however, was a dismal fiasco. The trampers committed no\r\ndepredations, and when they approached a town and camped near it the\r\nauthorities and citizens were quite willing to supply their immediate\r\nwants in order to get rid of them. But, while a good many recruits were\r\nadded, fully as many deserted. At no time did Coxey's army number more\r\nthan 500 men, and when it reached Washington on the 1st of May it\r\nincluded precisely 336 persons, who paraded through the streets. Upon\r\nattempting to enter the Capitol grounds they were excluded by the\r\npolice. Coxey and two of his friends disregarded the commands, and were\r\narrested and fined five dollars apiece and sentenced to twenty days'\r\nimprisonment for violating the statute against carrying a banner on the\r\ngrounds and in not \"keeping off the grass.\" The army quickly dissolved\r\nand was heard of no more.\r\n\r\nSimilar organizations started from Oregon, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming,\r\nand different points for Washington. In some instances disreputable\r\ncharacters joined them and committed disorderly acts. In the State of\r\nWashington they seized a railroad train, had a vicious fight with deputy\r\nmarshals, and it was necessary to call out the militia to subdue them.\r\nTrouble occurred in Kansas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. The total\r\nstrength of the six industrial armies never reached 6,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF UTAH.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, 1896, Utah became the forty-fifth member of the\r\nFederal Union. The symbolical star on the flag is at the extreme right\r\nof the fourth row from the top. The size of the national flag was also\r\nchanged from 6 by 5 feet to 5 feet 6 inches by 4 feet 4 inches.\r\n\r\nUtah has been made chiefly famous through the Mormons, who emigrated\r\nthither before the discovery of gold in California. Its size is about\r\ndouble that of the State of New York, and its chief resources are\r\nmineral and agricultural. It forms a part of the Mexican cession of\r\n1848, and its name is derived from the Ute or Utah Indians. Salt Lake\r\nCity was founded, and Utah asked for admission into the Union in 1849,\r\nbut was refused. A territorial government was organized in 1860, with\r\nBrigham Young as governor. It has been shown elsewhere that in 1857 it\r\nwas necessary to send Federal troops to Utah to enforce obedience to the\r\nlaws. Polygamy debarred its admission to the Union for many years.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the State allows women to vote, hold office, and sit\r\non juries, and a trial jury numbers eight instead of twelve persons,\r\nthree-fourths of whom may render a verdict in civil cases, but unanimity\r\nis required to convict of crime. The constitution also forbids polygamy,\r\nand the Mormon authorities maintain that it is not practiced except\r\nwhere plural marriages were contracted before the passage of the United\r\nStates law prohibiting such unions.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by scientists that the power which goes to waste at\r\nNiagara Falls would, if properly utilized, operate all the machinery in\r\nthe world. The discoveries made in electricity have turned attention to\r\nthis inconceivable storage of power, with the result that Niagara has\r\nbeen practically \"harnessed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the Niagara Falls Power Company was incorporated, followed\r\nthree years later by that of the Cataract Construction Company. Work\r\nbegan in October, 1890, and three more years were required to complete\r\nthe tunnel, the surface-canal, and the preliminary wheel-pits.\r\n\r\nThe first distribution of power was made in August, 1895, to the works\r\nof the Pittsburg Reduction Company, near the canal. Other companies were\r\nadded, and the city of Buffalo, in December, 1895, granted a franchise\r\nto the company to supply power to that city. The first customer was the\r\nBuffalo Railway Company. November 15, 1896, at midnight, the current was\r\ntransmitted by a pole line, consisting of three continuous cables of\r\nuninsulated copper, whose total length was seventy-eight miles. Since\r\nthat date, the street cars have been operated by the same motor, with\r\nmore industrial points continually added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOLD PROSPECTING PARTY ON DEBATABLE LAND IN BRITISH\r\nGUIANA.]\r\n\r\nWhile our past history shows that we have had only two wars with Great\r\nBritain, yet it shows also that talk of war has been heard fully a score\r\nof times. Long after 1812, we were extremely sensitive as regarded the\r\nnation that the majority of Americans looked upon as our hereditary foe,\r\nand the calls for war have been sounded in Congress and throughout the\r\nland far oftener than most people suspect. That such a calamity to\r\nmankind has been turned aside is due mainly to the good sense and mutual\r\nforbearance of the majority of people in both countries. England and the\r\nUnited States are the two great English-speaking nations. Together they\r\nare stronger than all the world combined. With the same language, the\r\nsame literature, objects, aims, and religion, a war between them would\r\nbe the most awful catastrophe that could befall humanity.\r\n\r\nThe last flurry with the \"mother country\" occurred in the closing weeks\r\nof 1895, and related to Venezuela, which had been at variance with\r\nEngland for many years. Until 1810, the territory lying between the\r\nmouths of the Orinoco and the Amazon was known as the Guianas. In the\r\nyear named Spain ceded a large part of the country to Venezuela, and in\r\n1814 Holland ceded another to Great Britain. The boundary between the\r\nSpanish and Dutch possessions had never been fixed by treaty, and the\r\ndispute between England and Venezuela lasted until 1887, when diplomatic\r\nrelations were broken off between the two countries.\r\n\r\nVenezuela asked that the dispute might be submitted to arbitration, but\r\nEngland would not agree, though the territory in question was greater in\r\nextent than the State of New York. The United States was naturally\r\ninterested, for the \"Monroe Doctrine\" was involved, and in February,\r\n1895, Congress passed a joint resolution, approving the suggestion of\r\nthe President that the question should be submitted to arbitration, but\r\nEngland still refused. A lengthy correspondence took place between Great\r\nBritain and this country, and, on December 17, 1895, in submitting it to\r\nCongress, President Cleveland asked for authority from that body to\r\nappoint a commission to determine the merits of the boundary dispute, as\r\na guide to the government in deciding its line of action, insisting\r\nfurther that, if England maintained her unwarrantable course, the United\r\nStates should resist \"by every means in its power, as a willful\r\naggression upon its rights and interests, the appropriation by Great\r\nBritain of any lands, or the exercise of governmental jurisdiction over\r\nany territory, which after investigation we have determined of right\r\nbelongs to Venezuela.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the warlike tone of these words. The country and\r\nCongress instantly fired up and the land resounded with war talk.\r\nCongress immediately appropriated the sum of $100,000 for the expense of\r\nthe commission of inquiry, and two days later the Senate passed the bill\r\nwithout a vote in opposition. The committee was named on the 1st of the\r\nfollowing January and promptly began its work.\r\n\r\nBut the sober second thought of wise men in both countries soon made\r\nitself felt. Without prolonging the story, it may be said that the\r\ndispute finally went to arbitration, February 2, 1897, where it should\r\nhave gone in the first place, and it was settled to the full\r\nsatisfaction of Great Britain, the United States, and Venezuela. Another\r\nfact may as well be conceded, without any reflection upon our\r\npatriotism: Had England accepted our challenge to war, for which she was\r\nfully prepared with her invincible navy, and we were in a state of\r\nunreadiness, the United States would have been taught a lesson that she\r\nwould have remembered for centuries to come. Thank God, the trial was\r\nspared to us and in truth can never come, while common sense reigns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUDERT. WHITE. BREWER. ALVEY. GILMAN. VENEZUELAN\r\nCOMMISSION. Appointed by President Cleveland, January, 1896, to\r\ndetermine the true boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1896.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election in the fall of 1896 was a remarkable one. The\r\nmonth of September had hardly opened when there were eight presidential\r\ntickets in the field. Given in the order of their nominations they\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nProhibition (May 27th)--Joshua Levering, of Maryland; Hale Johnson, of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nNational Party, Free Silver, Woman-Suffrage offshoot of the regular\r\nProhibition (May 28th)--Charles E. Bentley, of Nebraska; James H.\r\nSouthgate, of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nRepublican (June 18th)--William McKinley, of Ohio; Garret A. Hobart, of\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nSocialist-Labor (July 4th)--Charles H. Matchett, of New York; Matthew\r\nMaguire, of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nDemocratic (July 10th to 11th)--William Jennings Bryan, of Nebraska;\r\nArthur Sewall, of Maine.\r\n\r\nPeople's Party (July 24th to 25th)--William Jennings Bryan, of Nebraska;\r\nThomas E. Watson, of Georgia.\r\n\r\nNational Democratic Party (September 8th)--John McAuley Palmer, of\r\nIllinois; Simon Boliver Buckner, of Kentucky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WM. JENNINGS BRYAN. Democratic candidate for President,\r\n1896.]\r\n\r\nAs usual, the real contest was between the Democrats and Republicans.\r\nThe platform of the former demanded the free coinage of silver, which\r\nwas opposed by the Republicans, who insisted upon preserving the\r\nexisting gold standard. This question caused a split in each of the\r\nleading parties. When the Republican nominating convention inserted the\r\ngold and silver plank in its platform, Senator Teller, of Colorado, led\r\nthirty-two delegates in their formal withdrawal from the convention. A\r\nlarge majority of those to the National Democratic Convention favored\r\nthe free coinage of silver in the face of an urgent appeal against it by\r\nPresident Cleveland. They would accept no compromise, and, after\r\n\"jamming\" through their platform and nominating Mr. Bryan, they made\r\nArthur Sewall their candidate for Vice-President, though he was\r\npresident of a national bank and a believer in the gold standard.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this action, the Populists or People's Party refused\r\nto accept the candidature of Mr. Sewall, and put in his place the name\r\nof Thomas E. Watson, who was an uncompromising Populist.\r\n\r\nThere was also a revolt among the \"Sound Money Democrats,\" as they were\r\ntermed. Although they knew they had no earthly chance of winning, they\r\nwere determined to place themselves on record, and, after all the other\r\ntickets were in the field, they put Palmer and Buckner in nomination. In\r\ntheir platform they condemned the platform adopted by the silver men and\r\nthe tariff policy of the Republicans. They favored tariff for revenue\r\nonly, the single gold standard, a bank currency under governmental\r\nsupervision, international arbitration, and the maintenance of the\r\nindependence and authority of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan threw all his energies into the canvass and displayed\r\nwonderful industry and vigor. He made whirlwind tours through the\r\ncountry, speaking several times a day and in the evening, and won many\r\nconverts. Had the election taken place a few weeks earlier than the\r\nregular date, it is quite probable he would have won. Mr. McKinley made\r\nno speech-making tours, but talked many times to the crowds who called\r\nupon him at his home in Canton, Ohio. The official vote in November was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nMcKinley and Hobart, Republican, 7,101,401 popular votes; 271 electoral\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nBryan and Sewall, Democrat and Populist, 6,470,656 popular votes; 176\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\nLevering and Johnson, Prohibition, 132,007 popular votes.\r\n\r\nPalmer and Buckner, National Democrat, 133,148 popular votes.\r\n\r\nMatchett and Maguire, Socialist-Labor, 36,274 popular votes.\r\n\r\nBentley and Southgate, Free Silver Prohibition, 13,969 popular votes.\r\n\r\nDespite the political upheavals that periodically occur throughout our\r\ncountry, it steadily advances in prosperity, progress and growth. Its\r\nresources were limitless, and the settlement of the vast fertile areas\r\nin the West and Northwest went on at an extraordinary rate. In no\r\nsection was this so strikingly the fact as in the Northwest. So great\r\nindeed was the growth in that respect that the subject warrants the\r\nspecial chapter that follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNER AT TOP OF STAIRWAY NEW CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY,\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF CLEVELAND (SECOND-CONCLUDED), 1893-1897.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTHWEST.\r\n\r\nBY ALBERT SHAW, PH.D.,\r\n\r\n_Editor \"Review of Reviews,\" formerly editor of \"Minneapolis Tribune.\"_\r\n\r\nSettling the Northwest--The Face of the Country Transformed--Clearing\r\nAway the Forests and its Effects--Tree-planting on the Prairies--Pioneer\r\nLife in the Seventies--The Granary of the World--The Northwestern\r\nFarmer--Transportation and Other Industries--Business Cities and\r\nCentres--United Public Action and its Influence--The Indian\r\nQuestion--Other Elements of Population--Society and General Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Northwest\" is a shifting, uncertain designation. The term has been used\r\nto cover the whole stretch of country from Pittsburg to Puget Sound,\r\nnorth of the Ohio River and the thirty-seventh parallel of latitude.\r\nPopularly it signified the old Northwestern Territory--including Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin--until about the time of the\r\nCivil War. In the decade following the war, Illinois and Iowa were\r\nlargely in the minds of men who spoke of the Northwest. From 1870 to\r\n1880, Iowa, Kansas, northern Missouri, and Nebraska constituted the most\r\nstirring and favored region--the Northwest _par excellence_. But the\r\npast decade has witnessed a remarkable development in the Dakotas; and\r\nMinnesota, North and South Dakota, and Montana, with Iowa and Nebraska,\r\nare perhaps the States most familiarly comprised in the idea of the\r\nNorthwest. These States are really in the heart of the continent--midway\r\nbetween oceans; and perhaps by common consent the term Northwest will, a\r\ndecade hence, have moved on and taken firm possession of Oregon,\r\nWashington, Idaho, and Wyoming, while ultimately Alaska may succeed to\r\nthe designation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBERT SHAW.]\r\n\r\nBut for the present the Northwest is the great arable wedge lying\r\nbetween the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and between the Missouri\r\nRiver and the Rocky Mountains. It is a region that is pretty clearly\r\ndefined upon a map showing physical characteristics. For the most part,\r\nit is a region of great natural fertility, of regular north-temperate\r\nclimate, of moderate but sufficient rainfall, of scant forests and great\r\nprairie expanses, and of high average altitude without mountains. In a\r\nword, it is a region that was adapted by nature to the cultivation of\r\nthe cereals and leading crops of the temperate zone without arduous and\r\ntime-consuming processes for subduing the wilderness and redeeming the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLING THE NORTHWEST.\r\n\r\nThis \"New Northwest,\" in civilization and in all its significant\r\ncharacteristics, is the creature of the vast impulse that the successful\r\ntermination of the war gave the nation. No other extensive area was ever\r\nsettled under similar conditions. The homestead laws, the new American\r\nsystem of railroad building, and the unprecedented demand for staple\r\nfood products in the industrial centres at home and abroad, peopled the\r\nprairies as if by magic. Until 1870, fixing the date very roughly,\r\ntransportation facilities followed colonization. The railroads were\r\nbuilt to serve and stimulate a traffic that already existed. The\r\npioneers had done a generation's work before the iron road overtook\r\nthem. In the past two decades all has been changed. The railroads have\r\nbeen the pioneers and colonizers. They have invaded the solitary\r\nwilderness, and the population has followed. Much of the land has\r\nbelonged to the roads, through subsidy grants, but the greater part of\r\nthe mileage has been laid without the encouragement of land subsidies or\r\nother bonuses, by railway corporations that were willing to look to the\r\nfuture for their reward.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost impossible to over-estimate the significance of this\r\nmethod of colonization. Within a few years it has transformed the\r\nbuffalo ranges into the world's most extensive fields of wheat and corn.\r\nA region comprising northern and western Minnesota and the two Dakotas,\r\nwhich contributed practically nothing to the country's wheat supply\r\ntwelve or fifteen years ago, has, by this system of railroad\r\ncolonization, reached an annual production of 100,000,000 bushels of\r\nwheat alone--about one-fourth of the crop of the entire country. In like\r\nmanner, parts of western Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, that produced no\r\ncorn before 1875 or 1880, are now the centre of corn-raising, and yield\r\nmany hundreds of millions of bushels annually. These regions enter as\r\ntotally new factors into the world's supply of foods and raw materials.\r\nA great area of this new territory might be defined that was inhabited\r\nin 1870 by less than a million people, in 1880 by more than three\r\nmillions, and in 1899 by from eight to ten millions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DISPUTE OVER A BRAND.]\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a man from the East who has visited the Northwestern\r\nStates and Territories at some time between the years 1870 and 1875, and\r\nwho retains a strong impression of what he saw, but who has not been\r\nwest of Chicago since that time, until, in the World's Fair year, he\r\ndetermines upon a new exploration of Iowa, Nebraska, the Datokas,\r\nMinnesota, and Wisconsin. However well informed he had tried to keep\r\nhimself through written descriptions and statistical records of Western\r\nprogress, he would see what nothing but the evidence of his own eyes\r\ncould have made him believe to be possible. Iowa in 1870 was already\r\nproducing a large crop of cereals, and was inhabited by a thriving,\r\nthough very new, farming population. But the aspect of the country was\r\nbare and uninviting, except in the vicinity of the older communities on\r\nthe Mississippi River. As one advanced across the State the farm-houses\r\nwere very small, and looked like isolated dry-goods boxes; there were\r\nfew well-built barns or farm buildings; and the struggling young\r\ncottonwood and soft-maple saplings planted in close groves about the\r\ntiny houses were so slight an obstruction to the sweep of vision across\r\nthe open prairie that they only seemed to emphasize the monotonous\r\nstretches of fertile, but uninteresting, plain. Now the landscape is\r\nwholly transformed. A railroad ride in June through the best parts of\r\nIowa reminds one of a ride through some of the pleasantest farming\r\ndistricts of England. The primitive \"claim shanties\" of thirty years ago\r\nhave given place to commodious farm-houses flanked by great barns and\r\nhay-ricks, and the well-appointed structures of a prosperous\r\nagriculture. In the rich, deep meadows herds of fine-blooded cattle are\r\ngrazing. What was once a blank, dreary landscape is now garden-like and\r\ninviting. The poor little saplings of the earlier days, which seemed to\r\nbe apologizing to the robust corn-stalks in the neighboring fields, have\r\ngrown on that deep soil into great, spreading trees. One can easily\r\nimagine, as he looks off in every direction and notes a wooded horizon,\r\nthat he is--as in Ohio, Indiana, or Kentucky--in a farming region which\r\nhas been cleared out of primeval forests. There are many towns I might\r\nmention which twenty-five years ago, with their new, wooden shanties\r\nscattered over the bare face of the prairie, seemed the hottest place on\r\nearth as the summer sun beat upon their unshaded streets and roofs, and\r\nseemed the coldest places on earth when the fierce blizzards of winter\r\nswept unchecked across the prairie expanses. To-day the density of shade\r\nin those towns is deemed of positive detriment to health, and for\r\nseveral years past there has been a systematic thinning out and trimming\r\nup of the great, clustering elms. Trees of from six to ten feet in girth\r\nare found everywhere by the hundreds of thousands. Each farm-house is\r\nsheltered from winter winds by its own dense groves. Many of the farmers\r\nare able from the surplus growth of wood upon their estates to provide\r\nthemselves with a large and regular supply of fuel. If I have dwelt at\r\nsome length upon this picture of the transformation of the bleak,\r\ngrain-producing Iowa prairies of thirty years ago into the dairy and\r\nlive-stock farms of to-day, with their fragrant meadows and ample\r\ngroves, it is because the picture is one which reveals so much as to the\r\nnature and meaning of Northwestern progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARING AWAY THE FORESTS AND ITS EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nNot a little has been written regarding the rapid destruction of the\r\nvast white-pine forests with which nature has covered large districts of\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. It is true that this denudation has\r\nprogressed at a rate with which nothing of a like character in the\r\nhistory of the world is comparable. It is also true, doubtless, that the\r\nclearing away of dense forest areas has been attended with some\r\ninconvenient climatic results, and particularly with some objectionable\r\neffects upon the even distribution of rainfall and the regularity of the\r\nflow of rivers. But most persons who have been alarmed at the rapidity\r\nof forest destruction in the white-pine belt have wholly overlooked the\r\ngreat compensating facts. It happens that the white-pine region is not\r\nespecially fertile, and that for some time to come it is not likely to\r\nacquire a prosperous agriculture. But adjacent to it and beyond it\r\nthere was a vast region of country which, though utterly treeless, was\r\nendowed with a marvelous richness of soil and with a climate fitted for\r\nall the staple productions of the temperate zone. This region embraced\r\nparts of Illinois, almost the whole of Iowa, southern Minnesota, Kansas,\r\nNebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and parts of Montana--a region of\r\nimperial extent. Now, it happens that for every acre of pine land that\r\nhas been denuded in Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota\r\nthere are somewhere in the great treeless region further south and west\r\ntwo or three new farm-houses. The railroads, pushing ahead of settlement\r\nout into the open prairie, have carried the white-pine lumber from the\r\ngigantic sawmills of the Upper Mississippi and its tributaries; and thus\r\nmillions of acres of land have been brought under cultivation by farmers\r\nwho could not have been housed in comfort but for the proximity of the\r\npine forests. The rapid clearing away of timber areas in Wisconsin has\r\nsimply meant the rapid settlement of North and South Dakota, western\r\nIowa, and Nebraska.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL SPIRES, COLORADO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE PLANTING ON THE PRAIRIES.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of these treeless regions means the successful growth on\r\nevery farm of at least several hundred trees. Without attempting to be\r\nstatistical or exact, we might say that an acre of northern Minnesota\r\npine trees makes it possible for a farmer in Dakota or Nebraska to have\r\na house, farm buildings, and fences, with a holding of at least one\r\nhundred and sixty acres upon which he will successfully cultivate\r\nseveral acres of forest trees of different kinds. Even if the denuded\r\npine lands of the region south and west of Lake Superior would not\r\nreadily produce a second growth of dense forest--which, it should be\r\nsaid in passing, they certainly will--their loss would be far more than\r\nmade good by the universal cultivation of forest trees in the prairie\r\nStates. It is at least comforting to reflect, when the friends of\r\nscientific forestry warn us against the ruthless destruction of standing\r\ntimber, that thus far at least in our Western history we have simply\r\nbeen cutting down trees in order to put a roof over the head of the man\r\nwho was invading treeless regions for the purpose of planting and\r\nnurturing a hundred times as many trees as had been destroyed for his\r\nbenefit! There is something almost inspiring in the contemplation of\r\nmillions of families, all the way from Minnesota to Colorado and Texas,\r\nliving in the shelter of these new pine houses and transforming the\r\nplains into a shaded and fruitful empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIONEER LIFE IN THE SEVENTIES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLUICE-GATE.]\r\n\r\nThe enormous expansion of our railway systems will soon have made it\r\nquite impossible for any of the younger generation to realize what\r\nhardships were attendant upon such limited colonization of treeless\r\nprairie regions as preceded the iron rails. In 1876 I spent the summer\r\nin a part of Dakota to which a considerable number of hardy but poor\r\nfarmers had found their way and taken up claims. They could not easily\r\nprocure wood for houses, no other ordinary building material was\r\naccessible, and they were living in half-underground \"dugouts,\"\r\nso-called. There was much more pleasure and romance in the pioneer\r\nexperiences of my own ancestors a hundred years ago, who were living in\r\ncomfortable log-houses with huge fire places, and shooting abundant\r\nsupplies of deer and wild turkey in the deep woods of southern Ohio. The\r\npluck and industry of these Dakota pioneers, most of whom were Irish men\r\nand Norwegians, won my heartiest sympathy and respect. Poor as they\r\nwere, they maintained one public institution in common--namely, a\r\nschool, with its place of public assemblage. The building had no floor\r\nbut the beaten earth, and, its thick walls were blocks of matted prairie\r\nturf, its roof also being of sods supported upon some poles brought from\r\nthe scanty timber-growth along the margin of a prairie river. To-day\r\nthese poor pioneers are enjoying their reward. Their valley is traversed\r\nby several railroads; prosperous villages have sprung up; their lands\r\nare of considerable value; they all live in well-built farm-houses;\r\ntheir shade trees have grown to a height of fifty or sixty feet; a\r\nbustling and ambitious city, with fine churches, opera-houses, electric\r\nillumination, and the most advanced public educational system, is only a\r\nfew miles away from them. Such transformations have occurred, not alone\r\nin a few spots in Iowa and South Dakota, but are common throughout a\r\nregion that extends from the British dominions to the Indian Territory,\r\nand from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains--a region\r\ncomprising more than a half-million square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANARY OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BETWEEN THE MILLS.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the industrial life of these Northwestern communities is based\r\nsolidly upon agriculture. There is, perhaps, hardly any other\r\nagricultural region of equal extent upon the face of the earth that is\r\nso fertile and so well adapted for the production of the most necessary\r\narticles of human food. During the past decade the world's markets have\r\nbeen notably disturbed and affected, and profound social changes and\r\npolitical agitations have occurred in various remote parts of the earth.\r\nIt is within bounds to assert that the most potent and far-reaching\r\nfactor in the altered conditions of the industrial world during these\r\nrecent years has been the sudden invasion and utilization of this great\r\nnew farming region. Most parts of the world which are fairly prosperous\r\ndo not produce staple food supplies in appreciable surplus quantities.\r\nSeveral regions which are not highly prosperous sell surplus food\r\nproducts out of their poverty rather than out of their abundance. That\r\nis to say, the people of India and the people of Russia have often been\r\nobliged, in order to obtain money to pay their taxes and other necessary\r\nexpenses, to sell and send away to prosperous England the wheat which\r\nthey have needed for hungry mouths at home. They have managed to subsist\r\nupon coarser and cheaper food. But in our Northwestern States the\r\napplication of ingenious machinery to the cultivation of fertile and\r\nvirgin soils has within the past twenty-five years precipitated upon the\r\nworld a stupendous new supply of cereals and of meats, produced in\r\nquantities enormously greater than the people of the Northwestern States\r\ncould consume. These foodstuffs have powerfully affected agriculture in\r\nIreland, England, France, and Germany, and, in fact, in every other part\r\nof the accessible and cultivated globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARREL-HOIST AND TUNNEL THROUGH THE WASHBURN MILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHWESTERN FARMER.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written of late about the condition of the farmer in\r\nthese regions that it is pertinent to inquire who the Western farmer is.\r\nIn the old States the representative farmer is a man of long training in\r\nthe difficult and honorable art of diversified agriculture. He knows\r\nmuch of soils, of crops and their wise rotation, of domestic animals and\r\ntheir breeding, and of a hundred distinct phases of the production, the\r\nlife, and the household economics that belong to the traditions and\r\nmethods of Anglo-Saxon farming. If he is a wise man, owning his land and\r\navoiding extravagance, he can defy any condition of the markets, and can\r\nsurvive any known succession of adverse seasons. There are also many\r\nsuch farmers in the West. But there are thousands of wheat-raisers or\r\ncorn-growers who have followed in the wake of the railway and taken up\r\ngovernment or railroad land, and who are not yet farmers in the truest\r\nand best sense of the word. They are unskilled laborers who have become\r\nspeculators. They obtain their land for nothing, or for a price ranging\r\nfrom one dollar and fifty cents to five dollars per acre. They borrow on\r\nmortgage the money to build a small house and to procure horses and\r\nimplements and seed-grain. Then they proceed to put as large an acreage\r\nas they can manage into a single crop--wheat in the Dakotas, wheat or\r\ncorn in Nebraska and Kansas. They speculate upon the chances of a\r\nfavorable season and a good crop safely harvested; and they speculate\r\nupon the chances of a profitable market. They hope that the first two\r\ncrops may render them the possessor of an unincumbered estate, supplied\r\nwith modest buildings, and with a reasonable quantity of machinery and\r\nlive stock. Sometimes they succeed beyond their anticipations. In many\r\ninstances the chances go against them. They live on the land, and the\r\ntitle is invested in them; but they are using borrowed capital, use it\r\nunskillfully, meet an adverse season or two, lose through foreclosure\r\nthat which has cost them nothing except a year or two of energy spent in\r\nwhat is more nearly akin to gambling than to farming, and finally help\r\nto swell the great chorus that calls the world to witness the distress\r\nof Western agriculture. It cannot be said too emphatically that real\r\nagriculture in the West is safe and prosperous, and that the\r\nunfortunates are the inexperienced persons, usually without capital, who\r\nattempt to raise a single crop on new land. For many of them it would be\r\nabout as wise to take borrowed money and speculate in wheat in the\r\nChicago bucket-shops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOSSBRAE.]\r\n\r\nThe great majority, however, of these inexperienced and capital-less\r\nwheat and corn producers gradually become farmers. It is inevitable, at\r\nfirst, that a country opened by the railroads for the express purpose of\r\nobtaining the largest possible freightage of cereals should for a few\r\nseasons be a \"single-crop country.\" Often the seed-grain is supplied on\r\nloan by the roads themselves. They charge \"what the traffic will bear.\"\r\nThe grain is all, or nearly all, marketed through long series of\r\nelevators following the tracks, at intervals of a few miles, and owned\r\nby some central company that bears a close relation to the railroad.\r\nThus the corporations which control the transportation and handling of\r\nthe grain in effect maintain for their own advantage an exploitation of\r\nthe entire regions that they traverse, through the first years of\r\nsettlement. Year by year the margin of cultivation extends further\r\nWest, and the single-crop sort of farming tends to recede. The wheat\r\ngrowers produce more barley and oats and flax, try corn successfully,\r\nintroduce live stock and dairying, and thus begin to emerge as real\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nUnless this method of Western settlement is comprehended, it is not\r\npossible to understand the old Granger movement and the more recent\r\nlegislative conflicts between the farmers of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas,\r\nMinnesota, and the Dakotas, on the one hand, and the great\r\ntransportation and grain-handling corporations on the other. It was\r\nfundamentally a question of the division of profits. The railroads had\r\n\"made\" the country: were they entitled to allow the farmers simply a\r\nreturn about equal to the cost of production, keeping for themselves the\r\ndifference between the cost and the price in the central markets, or\r\nwere they to base their charges upon the cost of their service, and\r\nleave the farmers to enjoy whatever profits might arise from the\r\nproduction of wheat or corn? Out of that protracted contest has been\r\ndeveloped the principle of the public regulation of rates. The position\r\nof these communities of farmers with interests so similar, forming\r\ncommonwealths so singularly homogeneous, has led to a reliance upon\r\nState aid that is altogether unprecedented in new and sparsely settled\r\nregions, where individualism has usually been dominant, and governmental\r\nactivity relatively inferior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT BLOCK-HOUSE, ALASKA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION AND OTHER INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nBut agriculture, while the basis of Northwestern wealth, is not the sole\r\npursuit. Transportation has become in these regions a powerful interest,\r\nbecause of the vast surplus agricultural product to be carried away, and\r\nof the great quantities of lumber, coal, salt, and staple supplies in\r\ngeneral, to be distributed throughout the new prairie communities. The\r\ntransformation of the pine forests into the homes of several million\r\npeople has, of course, developed marvelous sawmill and building\r\nindustries; and the furnishing of millions of new homes has called into\r\nbeing great factories for the making of wooden furniture, iron stoves,\r\nand all kinds of household supplies. In response to the demand for\r\nagricultural implements and machinery with which to cultivate five\r\nhundred million acres of newly utilized wild land, there have come into\r\nexistence numerous great establishments for the making of machines that\r\nhave been especially invented to meet the peculiarities and exigencies\r\nof Western farm life.\r\n\r\nThrough Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, Indian corn has become a\r\ngreater product in quantity and value than wheat; while in Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, and North and South Dakota the wheat is decidedly the\r\npreponderant crop. Although in addition to oats and barley, which\r\nflourish in all the Western States, it has been found possible to\r\nincrease the acreage of maize in the northern tier, it is now believed\r\nthat the most profitable alternate crop in the latitude of Minneapolis\r\nand St. Paul is to be flax. Already a region including parts of\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas has become the\r\nmost extensive area of flax culture in the whole world. The crop has\r\nbeen produced simply for the seed, which has supplied large linseed oil\r\nfactories in Minneapolis, Chicago, and various Western places. But now\r\nit has been discovered that the flax straw, which has heretofore been\r\nallowed to rot in the fields as a valueless product, can be utilized for\r\na fibre which will make a satisfactory quality of coarse linen fabrics.\r\nLinen mills have been established in Minneapolis, and it is somewhat\r\nconfidently predicted that in course of time the linen industry of that\r\nambitious city will reach proportions even greater than its wonderful\r\nflour industry, which for a number of years has been without a rival\r\nanywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"TWIN CITIES.\"\r\n\r\nThe railroad system of the Northwest has been developed in such a way\r\nthat no one centre may be fairly regarded as the commercial capital of\r\nthe region. Chicago, with its marvelous foresight, has thrown out lines\r\nof travel that draw to itself much of the traffic which would seem\r\nnormally to belong to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth on the north, or\r\nto St. Louis and Kansas City on the south. But in the region now under\r\ndiscussion, the famous \"Twin Cities,\" Minneapolis and St. Paul,\r\nconstitute unquestionably the greatest and most distinctive centre, both\r\nof business and of civilization. They are beautifully situated, and they\r\nadd to a long list of natural advantages very many equally desirable\r\nattractions growing out of the enterprising and ambitious forethought of\r\nthe inhabitants. They are cities of beautiful homes, pleasant parks,\r\nenterprising municipal improvements; advanced educational\r\nestablishments, and varied industrial interests. Each is a distinct\r\nurban community, although they lie so near together that they constitute\r\none general centre of commerce and transportation when viewed from a\r\ndistance. Their stimulating rivalry has had the effect to keep each city\r\nalert and to prevent a listless, degenerate local administration. About\r\nthe Falls of St. Anthony, at Minneapolis, great manufacturing\r\nestablishments are grouping themselves, and each year adds to the\r\ncertainty that these two picturesque and charming cities have before\r\nthem a most brilliant civic future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY, 1885.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED PUBLIC ACTION AND ITS INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to rely upon united public action is illustrated in the\r\ngrowth of Northwestern educational systems. The universities of these\r\ncommonwealths are State universities. Professional education is under\r\nthe State auspices and control. The normal schools and the agricultural\r\nschools belong to the State. The public high school provides\r\nintermediate instruction. The common district school, supported jointly\r\nby local taxation and State subvention, gives elementary education to\r\nthe children of all classes. As the towns grow the tendency to graft\r\nmanual and technical courses upon the ordinary public school curriculum\r\nis unmistakably strong. The Northwest, more than any other part of the\r\ncountry, is disposed to make every kind of education a public function.\r\n\r\nRadicalism has flourished in the homogeneous agricultural society of\r\nthe Northwest. In the anti-monopoly conflict there seemed to have\r\nsurvived some of the intensity of feeling that characterized the\r\nanti-slavery movement; and a tinge of this fanatical quality has always\r\nbeen apparent in the Western and Northwestern monetary heresies. But it\r\nis in the temperance movement that this sweep of radical impulse has\r\nbeen most irresistible. It was natural that the movement should become\r\npolitical and take the form of an agitation for prohibition. The history\r\nof prohibition in Iowa, Kansas, and the Dakotas, and of temperance\r\nlegislation in Minnesota and Nebraska, reveals--even better perhaps than\r\nthe history of the anti-monopoly movement--the radicalism, homogeneity,\r\nand powerful socializing tendencies of the Northwestern people. Between\r\nthese different agitations there has been in reality no slight degree of\r\nrelationship; at least their origin is to be traced to the same general\r\nconditions of society.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which a modern community resorts to State action depends\r\nin no small measure upon the accumulation of private resources. Public\r\nor organized initiative will be relatively strongest where the impulse\r\nto progress is positive but the ability of individuals is small. There\r\nare few rich men in the Northwest. Iowa, great as is the Hawkeye State,\r\nhas no large city and no large fortunes. Of Kansas the same thing may be\r\nsaid. The Dakotas have no rich men and no cities. Minnesota has\r\nMinneapolis and St. Paul, and Nebraska has Omaha; but otherwise these\r\ntwo States are farming communities, without large cities or concentrated\r\nprivate capital. Accordingly the recourse to public action is\r\ncomparatively easy. South Dakota farmers desire to guard against drought\r\nby opening artesian wells for irrigation. They resort to State\r\nlegislation and the sale of county bonds. North Dakota wheat-growers are\r\nunfortunate in the failure of crops. They secure seed-wheat through\r\nState action and their county governments. A similarity of condition\r\nfosters associated action and facilitates the progress of popular\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nIn such a society the spirit of action is intense. If there are few\r\nphilosophers, there is remarkable diffusion of popular knowledge and\r\nelementary education. The dry atmosphere and the cold winters are\r\nnerve-stimulants, and life seems to have a higher tension and velocity\r\nthan in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe Northwest presents a series of very interesting race problems. The\r\nfirst one, chronologically at least, is the problem that the American\r\nIndian presents. It is not so long ago since the Indian was in\r\npossession of a very large portion of the region we are now considering.\r\nA number of tribes were gradually removed further West, or were assigned\r\nto districts in the Indian Territory. But most of them were concentrated\r\nin large reservations in Minnesota, Nebraska, North and South Dakota,\r\nMontana, and Wyoming. The past few years have witnessed the rapid\r\nreduction of these reservations, and the adoption of a policy which, if\r\ncarried to its logical conclusion with energy and good faith, will at an\r\nearly date result in the universal education of the children, in the\r\nabolition of the system of reservations, and in the settlement of the\r\nIndian families upon farms of their own, as fully enfranchised American\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER ELEMENTS OF POPULATION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE-SHORE DRIVE, CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nThe most potent single element of population in the Northwest is of New\r\nEngland origin, although more than half of it has found its way into\r\nIowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas, by filtration\r\nthrough the intermediate States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. But there has also been a vast direct\r\nimmigration from abroad; and this element has come more largely, by far,\r\nfrom the northern than from the central and southern races of Europe.\r\nThe Scandinavian peninsula and the countries about the Baltic and North\r\nSeas have supplied the Northwest with a population that already numbers\r\nmillions. From Chicago to Montana there is now a population of full\r\nScandinavian origin, which, perhaps, may be regarded as about equal in\r\nnumbers to the population that remains in Sweden and Norway. In\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, as well as in\r\nnorthern Iowa and in some parts of Nebraska, there are whole counties\r\nwhere the population is almost entirely Scandinavian. Upon all this\r\nportion of the country for centuries to come the Scandinavian\r\npatronymics will be as firmly fixed as they have been upon the Scotch\r\nand English coasts, where the Northmen intrenched themselves so\r\nnumerously and firmly about nine hundred or a thousand years ago. The\r\nScandinavians in the Northwest become Americans with a rapidity\r\nunequaled by any other non-English-speaking element. Their political\r\nambition is as insatiate as that of the Irish, and they already secure\r\noffices in numbers. Their devotion to the American school system, their\r\npolitical aptitude and ambition, and their enthusiastic pride in\r\nAmerican citizenship are thoroughly hopeful traits, and it is generally\r\nbelieved that they will contribute much of strength and sturdiness to\r\nthe splendid race of Northwestern Americans that is to be developed in\r\nthe Upper Mississippi and Missouri Valleys. The Northwestern Germans\r\nevince a tendency to mass in towns, as in Milwaukee, and to preserve\r\nintact their language and national traits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY AND GENERAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe large towns of the Northwest are notable for the great numbers of\r\nthe brightest and most energetic of the young business and professional\r\nmen of the East that they contain. While they lack the leisure class and\r\nthe traditions of culture that belong to older communities, they may\r\njustly claim a far higher percentage of college-bred men and of families\r\nof cultivated tastes than belong to Eastern towns of like population.\r\nThe intense pressure of business and absorption of private pursuits are,\r\nfor the present, seeming obstacles to the progress of Western\r\ncommunities in the highest things; but already the zeal for public\r\nimprovements and for social progress in all that pertains to true\r\nculture is very great. Two decades hence no man will question the\r\nquality of Northwestern civilization. If the East is losing something of\r\nits distinctive Americanism through the influx of foreign elements and\r\nthe decay of its old-time farming communities, the growth of the\r\nNorthwest, largely upon the basis of New England blood and New England\r\nideas, will make full compensation.\r\n\r\nEvery nation of the world confronts its own racial or climatic or\r\nindustrial problems, and nowhere is there to be found an ideal state of\r\nhappiness or virtue or prosperity; but, all things considered, it may\r\nwell be doubted whether there exists any other extensive portion, either\r\nof America or of the world, in which there is so little of pauperism, of\r\ncrime, of social inequality, of ignorance, and of chafing discontent, as\r\nin the agricultural Northwest that lies between Chicago and the Rocky\r\nMountains. Schools and churches are almost everywhere flourishing in\r\nthis region, and the necessities of life are not beyond the reach of any\r\nelement or class. There is a pleasantness, a hospitality, and a\r\nfriendliness in the social life of the Western communities that is\r\ncertainly not surpassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF McKINLEY, 1897-1901.\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley--Organization of \"Greater New York\"--Removal of General\r\nGrant's Remains to Morningside Park--The Klondike Gold Excitement--Spain's\r\nMisrule in Cuba--Preliminary Events of the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-FIFTH PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley was born at Niles, Trumbull County, Ohio, January 29,\r\n1843, of Scotch ancestry, his father, David, being one of the pioneers\r\nof the iron business in Eastern Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe parents were in moderate circumstances, and the son, having prepared\r\nfor college, was matriculated at Alleghany College, Meadville,\r\nPennsylvania, but his poor health soon obliged him to return to his\r\nhome. He became a schoolteacher at the salary of $25 per month, and, as\r\nwas the custom in many of the country districts, he \"boarded round;\"\r\nthat is, he made his home by turns with the different patrons of his\r\nschool. He used rigid economy, his ambition being to save enough money\r\nto pay his way through college.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n(1843-.) One term, 1897-1901.]\r\n\r\nDestiny, however, had another career, awaiting him. The great Civil War\r\nwas impending, and when the news of the firing on Fort Sumter was\r\nflashed through the land, his patriotic impulses were roused, and, like\r\nthousands of others, he hurried to the defense of his country. He\r\nenlisted in Company E, as a private. It was attached to the Twenty-third\r\nOhio regiment, of which W.S. Rosecrans was colonel and Rutherford B.\r\nHayes major. Of no other regiment can it be said that it furnished two\r\nPresidents to the United States.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year Private McKinley carried a musket, and on the 15th\r\nof April, 1862, was promoted to a sergeancy. Looking back to those\r\nstirring days of his young manhood, President McKinley has said:\r\n\r\n\"I always recall them with pleasure. Those fourteen months that I served\r\nin the ranks taught me a great deal. I was but a schoolboy when I went\r\ninto the army, and that first year was a formative period of my life,\r\nduring which I learned much of men and affairs. I have always been glad\r\nthat I entered the service as a private and served those months in that\r\ncapacity.\"\r\n\r\nMcKinley made a good soldier and saw plenty of fighting. Six weeks after\r\nleaving Columbus, his regiment was in the battle of Carnifex Ferry,\r\nWestern Virginia, where the only victories of the early days of the war\r\nwere won. It was the hardest kind of work, hurrying back and forth\r\nthrough the mountains, drenched by rains, and on short rations most of\r\nthe time. The boy did his work well and was soon ordered to Washington,\r\nwhere he became one of the units in the splendid Army of the Potomac\r\nunder General McClellan.\r\n\r\nAt Antietam, the bloodiest battle of the war, McKinley's gallantry was\r\nso conspicuous that he was promoted to a lieutenancy. He was sent to\r\nWest Virginia again, where he was fighting continually. As an evidence\r\nof the kind of work he did, it may be said that one morning his regiment\r\nbreakfasted in Pennsylvania, ate dinner in Maryland, and took supper in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nWinning promotion by his fine conduct, he became captain, July 25, 1864,\r\nand was brevetted major, on the recommendation of General Sheridan, for\r\nconspicuous bravery at Cedar Creek and Fisher's Hill. The title, \"Major\r\nMcKinley,\" therefore, is the military one by which the President is\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of peace, the young man found himself a veteran of the\r\nwar at the age of twenty-two, and compelled to decide upon the means of\r\nearning his living. He took up the study of law, and was graduated from\r\nthe Albany, N.Y., law school, and admitted to the bar in 1867. He began\r\npractice in Canton, Ohio, and, by his ability and conscientious\r\ndevotion, soon achieved success. He early showed an interest in\r\npolitics, and was often called upon to make public addresses. He\r\nidentified himself with the Republican party, and was elected district\r\nattorney in Stark County, which almost invariably went Democratic. In\r\n1876, he was elected to Congress, against a normal Democratic majority,\r\nfor five successive terms, being defeated when he ran the sixth time\r\nthrough the gerrymandering of his district by his political opponents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREATER NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1898, Greater New York was created by the union of New\r\nYork, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Staten Island, into one\r\nmunicipality. The city now covers nearly 318 square miles, contains over\r\nthree and one-half millions inhabitants, and, next to London, is the\r\nlargest city in the world.]\r\n\r\nDuring his seven terms in Congress, Mr. McKinley was noted for his clear\r\ngrasp of national questions and his interest in tariff legislation. It\r\nwas in 1890 that he brought about the passage of the tariff measure\r\nwhich is always associated with his name. In the same year he was\r\ndefeated, but, being nominated for governor, he was elected by 80,000\r\nmajority. As in the case of Mr. Cleveland, this triumph attracted\r\nnational attention, and his administration was so satisfactory that he\r\ncould have received the nomination for the presidency twice before he\r\naccepted it.\r\n\r\nThe presidential administration of McKinley has proven one of the most\r\neventful in our history, for, as set forth in the following chapters, it\r\nmarked our entrance among the leading nations of the world, in the field\r\nof territorial expansion beyond the limits of our own continent and\r\nhemisphere. Before entering upon the history of this phase of our\r\nnational existence, attention must be given to important happenings of a\r\ndifferent nature. One of these was the organization of what is popularly\r\nknown as \"Greater New York.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OBELISK IN CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GREATER NEW YORK.\"\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, a prominent question among the inhabitants of the\r\nmetropolis and outlying cities was that of their union under one\r\ngovernment. The New York Legislature in 1890 appointed a committee to\r\ninquire into and report upon the subject. After several years of\r\ndiscussion, the Legislature provided for a referendum, the result of\r\nwhich showed a large majority in favor of uniting the cities referred\r\nto. A bill was carefully framed, passed both branches of the law-making\r\nbody by a strong vote in February, 1897, and was signed by the mayors of\r\nBrooklyn and of Long Island City. Mayor Strong, of New York, however,\r\nvetoed the bill, but the Legislature immediately repassed it, and it was\r\nsigned by Governor Black.\r\n\r\nThe expanded metropolis began its official existence January 1, 1898,\r\nthe government being vested in a mayor and a municipal assembly, which\r\nconsists of two branches elected by the people. The population at the\r\ntime named was about 3,400,000, the daily increase being 400. Should\r\nthis rate continue, the total population at the middle of the twentieth\r\ncentury will be 20,000,000, which will make it the most populous in the\r\nworld, unless London wakes up and grows faster than at present.\r\n\r\nThe area of Greater New York is 317.77 square miles. Its greatest width\r\nfrom the Hudson River to the boundary line across Long Island beyond\r\nCreedmoor is sixteen miles, and the extreme length, from the southern\r\nend of Staten Island to the northern limits of Yonkers, is thirty-two\r\nmiles. Within these bounds are the cities of New York, Brooklyn, Long\r\nIsland City, Jamaica, all of Staten Island, the western end of Long\r\nIsland, Coney Island, Rockaway, Valley Stream, Flushing, Whitestone,\r\nCollege Point, Willets' Point, Fort Schuyler, Throggs' Neck,\r\nWestchester, Baychester, Pelham Manor, Van Cortlandt, Riverdale, and\r\nSpuyten Devil.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF GENERAL GRANT'S REMAINS TO MORNINGSIDE PARK.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the remains of General Grant to their final resting-place\r\nin the magnificent tomb on Morningside Heights, on the banks of the\r\nHudson, took place during the first year of McKinley's administration,\r\nand was marked by ceremonies among the most impressive ever witnessed in\r\nthe metropolis of the country. The final tributes to the foremost\r\ndefender of the country were made by eloquent tongues, and pens, and by\r\nthe reverent affection of the nation itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State under President McKinley; resigned 1898.]\r\n\r\nThere have been many attempts made to analyze the character of this\r\nremarkable man. Some of his most intimate friends failed to understand\r\nhim. Among the best of these analyses is that of Lieutenant-General John\r\nM. Schofield. In this our last reference to General Grant, the words of\r\nhis trusted confidant deserve record:\r\n\r\n   \"General Sherman wrote that he could not understand Grant, and\r\n   doubted if Grant understood himself. A very distinguished statesman,\r\n   whose name I need not mention, said to me that, in his opinion, there\r\n   was nothing special in Grant to understand. Others have varied widely\r\n   in their estimates of that  extraordinary character. Yet I believe\r\n   its most extraordinary quality was its extreme simplicity, so extreme\r\n   that many have entirely overlooked it in their search for some deeply\r\n   hidden secret to account for so great a character, unmindful of the\r\n   general fact that simplicity is one of the most prominent attributes\r\n   of greatness.\r\n\r\n   \"The greatest of all the traits of Grant's character was that which\r\n   lay always on the surface, visible to all who had eyes to see it.\r\n   That was his moral and intellectual honesty, integrity, sincerity,\r\n   veracity, and justice. He was incapable of any attempt to deceive\r\n   anybody, except for a legitimate purpose, as in military strategy;\r\n   and, above all, he was incapable of deceiving himself. He possessed\r\n   that rarest of all human faculties, the power of a perfectly accurate\r\n   estimate of himself, uninfluenced by vanity, pride, ambition,\r\n   flattery, or self-interest. Grant was very far from being a modest\r\n   man, as the word is generally understood. His just self-esteem was as\r\n   far above it as it was above flattery. The highest enconiums were\r\n   accepted for what he believed them to be worth. They did not disturb\r\n   his equilibrium in the slightest degree. Confiding, just, and\r\n   generous to everybody else, he treated with silent contempt any\r\n   suggestion that he had been unfaithful to any obligation. He was too\r\n   proud to explain where his honor had been questioned.\r\n\r\n   \"While Grant knew his own merits as well as anybody did, he also knew\r\n   his own imperfections and estimated them at their real value. For\r\n   example, his inability to speak in public, which produced the\r\n   impression of extreme modesty or diffidence, he accepted simply as a\r\n   fact in his nature which was of little or no consequence, and which\r\n   he did not even care to conceal. He would not, for many years, even\r\n   take the trouble to jot down a few words in advance, so as to be able\r\n   to say something when called upon. Indeed, I believe he would have\r\n   regarded it as an unworthy attempt to appear in a false light if he\r\n   had made preparations in advance for an 'extemporaneous' speech. Even\r\n   when he  did in later years write some notes on the back of a\r\n   dinner-card, he would take care to let everybody see that he had done\r\n   so by holding the card in plain view while he read his little speech.\r\n   After telling a story, in which the facts had been modified somewhat\r\n   to give the greater effect, which no one could enjoy more than he\r\n   did, Grant would take care to explain exactly in what respects he had\r\n   altered the facts for the purpose of increasing the interest in his\r\n   story, so that he might not leave any wrong impression.\r\n\r\n   \"When Grant's attention was called to any mistake he had committed,\r\n   he would see and admit it as quickly and unreservedly as if it had\r\n   been made by anybody else, and with a smile which expressed the exact\r\n   opposite of that feeling which most men are apt to show under like\r\n   circumstances. His love of truth and justice was so far above all\r\n   personal considerations that he showed unmistakable evidence of\r\n   gratification when any error into which he might have fallen was\r\n   corrected. The fact that he had made a mistake and that it was\r\n   plainly pointed out to him did not produce the slightest unpleasant\r\n   impression; while the further fact, that no harm had resulted from\r\n   his mistake, gave him real pleasure. In Grant's judgment, no case in\r\n   which any wrong had been done could possibly be regarded as finally\r\n   settled until that wrong was righted, and if he himself had been, in\r\n   any sense, a party to that wrong, he was the more earnest in his\r\n   desire to see justice done. While he thus showed a total absence of\r\n   any false pride of opinion or of knowledge, no man could be firmer\r\n   than he in adherence to his mature judgment, nor more earnest in his\r\n   determination, on proper occasions, to make it understood that his\r\n   opinion was his own and not borrowed from anybody else. His pride in\r\n   his own mature opinion was very great; in that he was as far as\r\n   possible from being a modest man. This absolute confidence in his own\r\n   judgment upon any subject which he had mastered, and the moral\r\n   courage to take upon himself alone the highest responsibility, and to\r\n   demand full authority and freedom to act according to his own\r\n   judgment, without interference from anybody, added to his accurate\r\n   estimate of his own ability and clear perception of the necessity for\r\n   undivided authority and responsibility in the conduct of military\r\n   operations, and in all that concerns the efficiency of armies in time\r\n   of war, constituted the foundation of that very great character.\r\n\r\n   \"When summoned to Washington to take command of all the armies, with\r\n   the rank of lieutenant-general, he determined, before he reached the\r\n   capital, that he would not accept the command under any conditions\r\n   than those above stated. His sense of honor and of loyalty to the\r\n   country would not permit him to consent to be placed in a false\r\n   position, one in which he could not perform the service which the\r\n   country had been led to expect from him, and he had the courage to\r\n   say so in unqualified terms.\r\n\r\n   \"These traits of Grant's character must now be perfectly familiar to\r\n   all who have studied his history, as well as to those who enjoyed\r\n   familiar intercourse with him during his life. They are the traits of\r\n   character which made him, as it seems to me, a very great man, the\r\n   only man of our time, so far as we know, who possessed both the\r\n   character and the military ability which were, under the\r\n   circumstances, indispensable in the commander of the armies which\r\n   were to suppress the great rebellion.\r\n\r\n   \"It has been said that Grant, like Lincoln, was a typical American,\r\n   and for that reason was most beloved and respected by the people.\r\n   That is true of the statesman and the soldier, as well as of the\r\n   people, if it is meant that they were the highest type, that ideal\r\n   which commands the respect and admiration of the highest and best in\r\n   a man's nature, however far he may know it to be above himself. The\r\n   soldiers and the people saw in Grant or in Lincoln, not one of\r\n   themselves, not a plain man of the people, nor yet some superior\r\n   being whom they could not understand, but the personification of\r\n   their highest ideal of a citizen, soldier, or statesman, a man whose\r\n   greatness they could see and understand as plainly as they could\r\n   anything else under the sun. And there was no more mystery about it\r\n   all, in fact, than there was in the popular mind.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPEAKER THOMAS B. REED.\r\n\r\nResigned as Speaker in 1899.]\r\n\r\nTo the widow of General Grant was given the right to select the spot for\r\nthe last resting-place of his remains, she to repose after death beside\r\nher husband. She decided upon Riverside. It then became the privilege of\r\nhis friends to provide a suitable tomb for the illustrious soldier. The\r\nfunds needed, amounting to nearly half a million dollars, were raised by\r\nsubscription, ground was broken on the anniversary of Grant's birthday,\r\nApril 27, 1891, and a year later the corner-stone was laid by President\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of General Grant, standing on the banks of the Hudson, is an\r\nimposing structure, square in shape, ninety feet on each side, and of\r\nthe Grecian-Doric order. The entrance on the south side is guarded by a\r\nportico in double lines of columns, approached by steps seventy feet in\r\nwidth. The tomb is surmounted at a height of seventy-two feet with a\r\ncornice and parapet, above which is a circular cupola, seventy feet in\r\ndiameter, terminating in a top the shape of a pyramid, which is 280 feet\r\nabove the river.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the structure is of cruciform form, seventy-six feet at\r\nits greatest length, the piers of masonry at the corners being connected\r\nby arches which form recesses. The arches are fifty feet in height, and\r\nare surmounted by an open circular gallery, capped with a panneled dome,\r\n105 feet above the floor. Scenes in General Grant's career are depicted\r\nwith sculpture on the plane and relieved surfaces in _alto rilievo_. The\r\ngranite of the structure is light in color, and the sarcophagus of\r\nbrilliant reddish porphyry. The crypt rests directly under the centre of\r\nthe dome, stairways connecting with the passage surrounding the\r\nsarcophagus, where the remains of the widow of General Grant are\r\neventually to repose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF U.S. GRANT, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies attending the removal of the remains on April 27, 1897,\r\nincluded three impressive displays, the ceremony at the tomb, the parade\r\nof the army--the National Guard and civic bodies--and the review of the\r\nnavy and merchant marine on the Hudson. Those who gathered to take part\r\nin the final tribute to the great soldier included the President,\r\nVice-President of the United States, the Cabinet, many State governors,\r\nprominent American citizens, and representatives of foreign nations.\r\nFrom 129th Street to the Battery, and from Whitehall up East River to\r\nthe Bridge, thousands of American and foreign flags were displayed,\r\nwhile the parade of men on foot included 60,000 persons.\r\n\r\nBishop Newman opened the exercises with prayer, and President McKinley\r\nmade one of the finest speeches of his life, the opening words of which\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n   \"A great life, dedicated to the welfare of the nation, here finds its\r\n   earthly coronation. Even if this day lacked the impressiveness of\r\n   ceremony and was devoid of pageantry, it would still be memorable,\r\n   because it is the anniversary of the birth of the most famous and\r\n   best beloved of American soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVIEW OF THE NAVY AND MERCHANT MARINE ON THE HUDSON,\r\nAPRIL 27, 1897.]\r\n\r\nThe President concluded with the words:\r\n\r\n   \"With Washington and Lincoln, Grant had an exalted place in the\r\n   history and the affections of the people. To-day his memory is held\r\n   in equal esteem by those whom he led to victory, and by those who\r\n   accepted his generous terms of peace. The veteran leaders of the Blue\r\n   and Gray here meet not only to honor the name of Grant, but to\r\n   testify to the living reality of a fraternal national spirit which\r\n   has triumphed over the differences of the past and transcends the\r\n   limitations of sectional lines. Its completion--which we pray God to\r\n   speed--will be the nation's greatest glory.\r\n\r\n   \"It is right that General Grant should have a memorial commensurate\r\n   with his greatness, and that his last resting-place should be in the\r\n   city of his choice, to which he was so attached, and of whose ties he\r\n   was not forgetful even in death. Fitting, too, is it that the great\r\n   soldier should sleep beside the noble river on whose banks he first\r\n   learned the art of war, and of which he became master and leader\r\n   without a rival.\r\n\r\n   \"But let us not forget the glorious distinction with which the\r\n   metropolis among the fair sisterhood of American cities has honored\r\n   his life and memory. With all that riches and sculpture can do to\r\n   render the edifice worthy of the man, upon a site unsurpassed for\r\n   magnificence, has this monument been reared by New York as a\r\n   perpetual record of his illustrious deeds, in the certainty that, as\r\n   time passes, around it will assemble, with gratitude and reverence\r\n   and veneration, men of all climes, races, and nationalities.\r\n\r\n   \"New York holds in its keeping the precious dust of the silent\r\n   soldier, but his achievements--what he and his brave comrades wrought\r\n   for mankind--are in the keeping of seventy millions of American\r\n   citizens, who will guard the sacred heritage forever and\r\n   forevermore.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALASKA]\r\n\r\nGeneral Horace Porter, president of the Grant Memorial Association, made\r\nan address, giving the history of the crowning work of the association,\r\nrendering acknowledgment to those who had given valuable help, and\r\nclosing with a masterly and eloquent tribute to the great citizen whom\r\nall had gathered to honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KLONDIKE GOLD EXCITEMENT.\r\n\r\nThere was much excitement throughout the country in 1897 over the\r\nreported discoveries of rich deposits of gold in the Klondike, as the\r\nregion along the Yukon River in Alaska is called. These reports were\r\ndiscredited at first, but they were repeated, and proof soon appeared\r\nthat they were based upon truth. In the autumn of 1896, about fifty\r\nminers visited the section, led thither by the rumors that had come to\r\nthem. None of the men carried more than his outfit and a few hundred\r\ndollars, but when they returned they brought gold to the value of from\r\n$5,000 to $100,000 apiece, besides leaving claims behind them that were\r\nworth hundreds of thousands of dollars. In July, 1897, a party of miners\r\narrived at Seattle from the Klondike, bringing with them nuggets and\r\ngold-dust weighing more than a ton and worth a million and a half of\r\ndollars. Besides this, other men continually came back with such\r\nquantities of the precious metal that it was apparent that not only were\r\nthe reports justified, but, what is the exception in such cases, the\r\nwhole truth had not been told.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence was that a rush set in for the Klondike, which\r\nis the name of a tributary of the Yukon, and flows through the richest\r\ngold fields, where the mining days of early California were repeated.\r\nDawson City was founded at the mouth of the Klondike, and in a short\r\ntime had a population of 5,000. Before the year closed, 500 claims were\r\nlocated, with more taken up daily. As was inevitable, there was much\r\nsuffering, for the Yukon is closed by ice during the greater part of the\r\nyear, and the winter climate is of Arctic severity. The most productive\r\nfields were found to be not in Alaska, but in the British provinces\r\nknown as the Northwest Territories. While many gathered fortunes in the\r\nKlondike, the majority, after great hardships and suffering, returned to\r\ntheir homes poorer than when they left them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READY FOR THE TRAIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN'S MISRULE IN CUBA.\r\n\r\nThe administration of McKinley occupies a prominent place in American\r\nhistory because of our brief and decisive war with Spain. A full account\r\nis given in the pages that follow, but it is proper in this chapter to\r\nset forth some historical facts, that will serve to clear the way to a\r\nproper understanding of the story of the war itself.\r\n\r\nSpain may best illustrate the certain decline of the Latin race and the\r\nrise of the Anglo-Saxon. When America was discovered, she was the\r\nleading maritime power of the world, but she was corrupt, rapacious,\r\nferocious, and totally devoid of what is best expressed by the term\r\n\"common sense.\" So lacking indeed was she in this prime requisite that\r\nshe alienated, when it was just as easy to attract, the weaker nations\r\nand colonies with which she came in contact. It has been shown in the\r\nearlier chapters of this work that when her exploring expeditions into\r\nthe interior of America were obliged to depend for their own existence\r\nupon the good-will of the natives, and when they could readily gain and\r\nretain that good-will, they roused the hatred of the simple-minded\r\nnatives by their frightful cruelties. The chief amusement of the early\r\nSpaniards was killing Indians. They did it from the innate brutality of\r\ntheir nature, when they could have gained tenfold more by justice and\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of those poor people was precisely what on a larger scale\r\nhas been shown to her colonies. England wins and holds her dependencies\r\nthrough her liberality and justice; Spain repels hers through her\r\ntreachery, falsehoods, and injustice. As a consequence, England has\r\nbecome one of the mightiest nations in the world, while Spain has\r\nsteadily declined to a fourth-rate power. With the example of the\r\nresults of her idiocy, to say nothing of its dishonor, ever before her,\r\nshe has persisted in that idiocy, never learning from experience, but\r\nalways selfish, short-sighted, cruel, treacherous, and unjust.\r\n\r\nThe steadiness with which Cuba clung to the mother country won for her\r\nthe title of the \"Ever Faithful Isle.\" Had she received any\r\nconsideration at all, she still would have held fast. She poured\r\nprincely revenues into the lap of Spain; when other colonies revolted,\r\nshe refused to be moved. It required long years of outrage, robbery, and\r\ninjustice to turn her affection into hate, but Spain persisted until the\r\ntime came when human nature could stand no more. The crushed worm turned\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte deposed the Bourbon King, Ferdinand VII., in\r\n1808, and placed his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, Cuba\r\ndeclared her loyalty to the old dynasty, and the king made many promises\r\nof what he would do to prove his gratitude when he should come to his\r\nown. This took place five years later, whereupon the king violated every\r\npledge he had made.\r\n\r\nThe truth gradually worked its way into the Cuban mind that the only\r\nthing a Spaniard could be depended upon to do is to violate his most\r\nsolemn promises. Secret societies began assuming form in the island,\r\nwhose plotting and aim were to wrest their country from Spain, on the\r\nground of the non-fulfillment of the pledges made by Ferdinand VII. of\r\nwhat he would do when he came to the throne.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made for a revolt, whose avowed object was the\r\nestablishment of a Cuban republic. A certain night in 1823 was fixed\r\nupon for a general uprising, but there were traitors in the councils,\r\nwho notified the authorities, and, before the date named, the leaders\r\nwere arrested and the revolt quenched ere a blow could be struck.\r\n\r\nThese severe measures could not quell the spirit of liberty that was\r\nabroad. It was not long before the Black Eagle Society was formed. It\r\nincluded many hundred members, had its headquarters in Mexico, and\r\nboldly secured recruits in the United States. But again the cause was\r\nbetrayed by its members, the leaders were arrested and imprisoned, and\r\nSpain was secure for a time in the control of the island.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of that country's course against suspected citizens,\r\nit may be said that in 1844 a rumor spread that large numbers of the\r\nslaves on the plantations near Matanzas were making secret preparations\r\nto rise and slay their masters. Investigation failed to establish the\r\ntruth of these charges, but many were put to the torture to compel them\r\nto confess, and nearly a hundred were condemned and shot in cold blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL CALIXTO GARCIA.\r\n\r\nHero of three wars for Cuba's freedom. Died of pneumonia in Washington,\r\nD.C., December, 1898.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the affairs of Cuba from its proximity were always of great\r\ninterest to the United States, and a number of filibustering expeditions\r\nlanded on the island and aided the Cubans in their futile revolts\r\nagainst Spain. These attempts at their best could only keep the island\r\nin a turmoil, and give Spain the pretext for using the most brutal\r\nmeasures of repression.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 a revolution occurred in Spain itself, and Queen Isabella, one\r\nof the worst rulers that sorely accursed country ever had, was driven\r\ninto exile. Cuba had not forgotten the lesson of the opening of the\r\ncentury, and, instead of proclaiming her loyalty to the deposed dynasty,\r\nshe seized what promised to be a favorable opportunity for gaining her\r\nown independence.\r\n\r\nOne of the fairest and most impartial publications anywhere is the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, which used the following language in giving the\r\nreasons for the Cuban revolt of 1868:\r\n\r\n   \"Spain governs the island of Cuba with an iron and blood-stained\r\n   hand. The former holds the latter deprived of political, civil, and\r\n   religious liberties. Hence the unfortunate Cubans being illegally\r\n   prosecuted and sent into exile, or executed by military commissions,\r\n   in times of peace; hence their being kept from public meetings, and\r\n   forbidden to speak or write on affairs of State; hence their\r\n   remonstrances against the evils that afflicted them being looked upon\r\n   as the proceedings of rebels, from the fact that they are obliged to\r\n   keep silence and obey; hence the never-ending plague of hungry\r\n   officials from Spain to devour the product of their industry and\r\n   labor; hence their exclusion from the art of government; hence the\r\n   restrictions to which public instruction with them is subjected in\r\n   order to keep them so ignorant as not to be able to know and enforce\r\n   their rights in any shape or form whatever; hence the navy and the\r\n   standing army, which are kept in their country at an enormous\r\n   expenditure from their own wealth to make them bend their knees and\r\n   submit their necks to the iron yoke that disgraces them; hence the\r\n   grinding taxation under which they labor, and which would make all\r\n   perish in misery but for the marvelous fertility of their soil.\"\r\n\r\nThe opportunity was a golden one for Spain to win back the affection of\r\nCuba by generosity and justice. What steps did she take to do so?\r\n\r\nAlthough the Cubans were ground to the very dust by taxation, levied in\r\nall cases by Spaniards, and not by their own officials, Spain proposed,\r\nin 1868, to add to the burden. In October of that year Carlos M. de\r\nCespedes, a lawyer of Bayamo, raised the standard of revolt, placed\r\nhimself at the head of a handful of patriots, which were soon joined by\r\nthousands, and in April, 1869, a republican constitution was adopted,\r\nslavery declared abolished, Cespedes was elected president, Francisco\r\nAguilero vice-president, and a legislature was called together.\r\n\r\nThere never was hope of this insurrection securing the independence of\r\nCuba. The patriots were too few in number, too badly armed and equipped,\r\nand not handled so as to be effective. But they caused great suffering\r\nand ruin throughout the island. They instituted a guerrilla system of\r\nwarfare, and cost Spain many valuable lives. The wet and rainy seasons\r\ncame and went, and still the savage fighting continued, until at last\r\nthe rebels as well as the Spaniards were ready to welcome peace.\r\n\r\nMartinez Campos was the Spanish commander, and he promised General\r\nMaximo Gomez, leader of the insurgents, that the reforms for which he\r\nand his comrades were contending should be granted on condition that\r\nthey laid down their arms. The pledge was a sacred one, and no doubt\r\nCampos meant honestly to keep it. Unfortunately, however, there were\r\nhigher powers than he behind him. Gomez accepted the promises of a\r\nbrother soldier, and on February 10, 1878, the treaty of El Zanjon was\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nThis treaty guaranteed representation to the Cubans in the Spanish\r\nCortes, and all who took part in the insurrection were pardoned.\r\n\r\nNow the lesson of all this was so plain that the wayfaring man, though a\r\nfool, had no excuse for erring. Spain had bitterly learned the temper of\r\nthe Cubans. She could not fail to see that but one possible way existed\r\nfor her to retain control of them, and, of course, that was the very way\r\nshe avoided. The Madrid authorities thought they did a wise thing when\r\nthey secured control of the polls, and made sure that the delegates\r\nelected were their own. Schools, sewerage, roads, everything that could\r\nhelp the island were neglected and taxation increased. The reforms\r\npromised to the insurgents upon condition of laying down their arms\r\nproved a delusion and a snare. Thus the \"captain-general\" had his name\r\nchanged to \"governor-general,\" but his tyrannical powers remained the\r\nsame as before. The right of banishment was formally repealed, but the\r\noutrages continued under another law that was equally effective, and so\r\non to the end of the chapter. Once again the Cubans had been fooled by\r\ntrusting to Spanish honor. They resolved that as soon as arrangements\r\ncould be effected, they would set another insurrection on foot, which\r\nwould be fought out to the death or until independence was secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL MAXIMO GOMEZ.\r\n\r\n_The Washington of Cuba_ is the title applied to this hero, who, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the patriot army, made Cuban liberty possible.]\r\n\r\nSeveral important ends were accomplished by the Ten Years' War. Slavery\r\nwas abolished in 1886, and the island was divided into the present six\r\nprovinces. As in previous instances the United States was counted upon\r\nfor the greatest material assistance in prosecuting the revolution. The\r\nspirit of adventure is always strong among Americans, and the\r\nfilibustering enterprises appealed strongly to them. The spice of danger\r\nby which they were attended was their chief attraction. Our government\r\nwas bound by treaty to prevent them, so far as she could, and it went to\r\ngreat expense in doing so. A number of expeditions were unable to get\r\naway from New York, but others escaped the vigilance of officials, and\r\nlanded guns, ammunition, and men at different points on the island. One\r\nof the greatest helps in this unlawful business was the dishonesty of\r\nthe officials employed by Spain to prevent the landing of supplies and\r\nmen. There was never any difficulty in bribing these officers, who\r\nstumbled over one another in their eagerness to be bribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST CUBAN REVOLUTION LAUNCHED.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the leaders in the former late revolt were consulting upon\r\nthe best steps to launch the new revolution. Maximo Gomez was living in\r\nSan Domingo, and, when he was offered the command of the revolutionary\r\nforces, he promptly accepted the responsibility. The offer came to him\r\nthrough Jose Marti, the head of the organization.\r\n\r\nThe grim veterans were resolute in their purpose. After studying the\r\nsituation, they agreed that a general uprising should be set on foot in\r\nall the provinces on February 24, 1895. It was impossible to do this,\r\nbut the standard of revolt was raised on the date named in three of the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nOne Spanish official read truly the meaning of the signs. He was\r\nCalleja, the captain-general. Though the revolt in the province of\r\nSantiago de Cuba looked trifling, he knew it was like a tiny blaze\r\nkindled in the dry prairie grass. He wished to act liberally toward the\r\ninsurgents, but the blind government at Madrid blocked his every step.\r\nSince it had played the fool from the beginning, it kept up the farce to\r\nthe end. They ordered Calleja to stamp out the rebellion, and he did his\r\nutmost to obey orders.\r\n\r\nCould the royal and insurgent forces be brought to meet in fair combat,\r\nthe latter would have been crushed out of existence at the first\r\nmeeting. But the insurgent leaders were too shrewd to risk anything of\r\nthat nature. They resumed their guerrilla tactics, striking hard blows,\r\nhere, there, anywhere that the chance offered, and then fled into the\r\nwoods and mountains before the regulars could be brought against them.\r\n\r\nSuch a style of warfare is always cruel and accompanied by outrages of a\r\nshocking character. The Cubans were as savage in their methods as the\r\nSpaniards. They blew up bridges and railroad trains with dynamite,\r\nregardless of the fact that, in so doing, it was the innocent instead of\r\nthe guilty who suffered. They burned the sugar cane, destroyed the\r\ntobacco and coffee plantations, and impoverished the planters in order\r\nto shut off the revenues of Spain and deprive her forces of their needed\r\nsupplies; they spread desolation and ruin everywhere, in the vain hope\r\nthat the mother country could thus be brought to a realizing sense of\r\nthe true situation.\r\n\r\nBut Spain was deaf and blind. She sent thousands of soldiers across the\r\nAtlantic, including the members of the best families in the kingdom, to\r\ndie in the pestilential lowlands of Cuba, while trying to stamp out the\r\nfires of revolution that continually grew and spread.\r\n\r\nThe island was cursed by three political parties, each of which was\r\nstrenuous in the maintenance of its views. The dominant party of course\r\nwas the loyalists, who held all the offices and opposed any compromise\r\nwith the insurgents. They were quite willing to make promises, with no\r\nintention of fulfilling them, but knew the Cubans could no longer be\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nThe second party was the insurgents, who, as has been shown, had\r\n\"enlisted for the war,\" and were determined not to lay down their arms\r\nuntil independence was achieved. The autonomists stood between these\r\nextremes, favoring home rule instead of independence, while admitting\r\nthe misgovernment of Cuba.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSE MARTI.\r\n\r\nPresident of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. Led into ambush and killed\r\nby the Spaniards, May 19, 1895.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were determined to prevent the coming of Antonio Maceo, a\r\nveteran of the Ten Years' War, possessed of great courage and resources,\r\nwho was living in Costa Rica. They knew he had been communicated with\r\nand his presence would prove a tower of strength to the insurgents.\r\nBodies of Spanish cavalry galloped along the coasts, on the alert to\r\ncatch or shoot the rebel leader, while the officials closely watched all\r\narrivals at the seaports for the feared rebel.\r\n\r\nDespite these precautions, Maceo and twenty-two comrades of the previous\r\nwar effected a landing on the eastern end of the island. They were\r\nalmost immediately discovered by the Spanish cavalry, and a fierce fight\r\nfollowed, in which several Cubans were killed. Maceo fought furiously,\r\nseemingly inspired by the knowledge that he was again striking for the\r\nfreedom of his country, and he came within a hair of being killed. He\r\neluded his enemies, however, and, plunging into the thickets, started\r\nfor the interior to meet the other insurgent leaders. The abundance of\r\ntropical fruits saved him from starving, and it was not long before he\r\nmet with straggling bodies of his countrymen, who hailed his coming with\r\nenthusiasm. Recruits rapidly gathered around him, and he placed himself\r\nat the head of the ardent patriots.\r\n\r\nIt was just ten days after the landing of Maceo that Gomez and Jose\r\nMarti, coming from Santo Domingo, landed on the southern coast of Cuba.\r\nThey had a lively time in avoiding the Spanish patrol, but succeeded in\r\nreaching a strong force of insurgents, and Gomez assumed his duties as\r\ncommander-in-chief. Recruits were gathered to the number of several\r\nthousand, and Gomez and Marti started for the central provinces with the\r\npurpose of formally establishing the government. Marti was led astray on\r\nthe road by a treacherous guide and killed.\r\n\r\nFully alive to the serious work before him, Captain-General Calleja\r\ncalled upon Spain for help in quelling the rebellion. She sent 25,000\r\ntroops to Cuba and Calleja was relieved by Field-Marshal Campos. This\r\nwas a popular move, for it was Campos who brought the Ten Years' War to\r\na close, and it was generally believed he would repeat his success.\r\n\r\nThe first important act of Campos was to divide Cuba into zones, by\r\nmeans of a number of strongly guarded military lines, extending north\r\nand south across the narrower part of the island. They were called\r\n\"trochas,\" and were expected to offer an impassable check to the\r\ninsurgents, who, thus confined within definite limits, could be crushed\r\nor driven into the sea with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTONIO MACEO.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General in the Cuban Army.]\r\n\r\nThe scheme, however, was a failure. The rebels crossed the trochas at\r\nwill, kept up their guerrilla tactics, picked off the regulars,\r\ndestroyed railroad trains, and went so far as to shoot the messengers\r\nwho dared to enter their camp with proposals for making peace on other\r\nterms than independence.\r\n\r\nThe Cubans were full of hope. They had their old leaders with them, men\r\nwho had led them in former campaigns and proven their courage and skill.\r\nRecruits flocked to their standards, until it has been estimated that by\r\nthe close of the year fully 20,000 insurgents were in the field. With\r\nsuch strong commands, the leaders were able to attain several important\r\nsuccesses. Considerable bodies of the regulars were defeated with\r\nserious losses, and, in one instance, Campos succeeded in saving himself\r\nand command only by the artillery he happened to have with him.\r\n\r\nCampos had prosecuted the war through civilized methods, and, therefore,\r\nfell into disfavor at home. He was not a representative Spanish\r\ncommander, and was now superseded by General Valeriano Weyler, who\r\narrived in Havana in February, 1896. This man had as much human feeling\r\nin his heart as a wounded tiger. His policy was _extermination_. He\r\nestablished two powerful trochas across the island, but they proved as\r\nineffective as those of Campos. Then he ordered the planters and their\r\nfamilies, who were able to pick up a wretched living on their places, to\r\nmove into the nearest towns, where they would be able to raise no more\r\nfood for the insurgents. It mattered not to Weyler that neither could\r\nthese reconcentrados raise any food for themselves, and therefore must\r\nstarve: that was no concern of his. As he viewed it, starvation was the\r\nright method of ridding Cuba of those who yearned for its freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo pen can picture the horrors that followed. The woeful scenes sent a\r\nshudder throughout the United States, and many good people demanded that\r\nthe unspeakable crime should be checked by armed intervention. To do\r\nthis meant war with Spain, but we were ready for that. A Congressional\r\nparty visited Cuba in March, 1898, and witnessed the hideous suffering\r\nof the Cubans, of whom more than a hundred thousand had been starved to\r\ndeath, with scores still perishing daily. In referring to what they\r\nsaw, Senator Proctor, of Vermont, said: \"I shall refer to these horrible\r\nthings no further. They are there. God pity me, I have seen them; they\r\nwill remain in my mind forever, and this is almost the twentieth\r\ncentury. Christ died nineteen hundred years ago, and Spain is a\r\nChristian nation. She has set up more crosses in more lands, beneath\r\nmore skies, and under them has butchered more people than all the other\r\nnations of the earth combined. God grant that before another Christmas\r\nmorning the last vestige of Spanish tyranny and oppression will have\r\nvanished from the western hemisphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe ferocious measures of Weyler brought so indignant a protest from our\r\ncountry that he was recalled, and his place taken by General Ramon\r\nBlanco, who reached Havana in the autumn of 1897. Under him the\r\nindecisive fighting went on much as before, with no important advantage\r\ngained by either side. Friends of Cuba made appeals in Congress for the\r\ngranting of belligerent rights to the insurgents, but strict\r\ninternational law demanded that their government should gain a more\r\ntangible form and existence before such rights could be conceded.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this state of extreme tension when the blowing-up of the\r\n_Maine_ occurred. While riding quietly at anchor in the harbor of\r\nHavana, on the night of February 15, 1898, she was utterly destroyed by\r\na terrific explosion, which killed 266 officers and men. The news\r\nthrilled the land with horror and rage, for it was taken at once for\r\ngranted that the appalling crime had been committed by Spaniards, but\r\nthe absolute proof remained to be brought forward, and the Americans,\r\nwith their proverbial love of justice and fair-play, waited for such\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nCompetent men were selected for the investigation, and they spent three\r\nweeks in making it. They reported that it had been established beyond\r\nquestion that the _Maine_ was destroyed by an outside explosion, or\r\nsubmarine mine, though they were unable to determine who was directly\r\nresponsible for the act.\r\n\r\nThe insistence of Spain, of course, was that the explosion was\r\naccidental and resulted from carelessness on the part of Captain Sigsbee\r\nand his crew; but it may be doubted whether any of the Spanish officials\r\nin Havana ever really held such a belief. While Spain herself was not\r\ndirectly responsible for the destruction of the warship and those who\r\nwent down in her, it was some of her officials who destroyed her. The\r\ndisplacement of the ferocious Weyler had incensed a good many of his\r\nfriends, some of whom most likely expressed their views in this manner,\r\nwhich, happily for the credit of humanity, is exceedingly rare in the\r\nhistory of nations.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: PRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND THE WAR CABINET\r\n\r\n       LYMAN J.

It was, in brief, a war for humanity, for\r\nAmerica could no longer close her ears to the wails of the dead and\r\ndying that lay perishing, as may be said, on her very doorsteps. It was\r\nnot a war for conquest or gain, nor was it in revenge for the awful\r\ncrime of the destruction of the _Maine_, though few nations would have\r\nrestrained their wrath with such sublime patience as did our countrymen\r\nwhile the investigation was in progress. Yet it cannot be denied that\r\nthis unparalleled outrage intensified the war fever in the United\r\nStates, and thousands were eager for the opportunity to punish Spanish\r\ncruelty and treachery. Congress reflected this spirit when by a\r\nunanimous vote it appropriated $50,000,000 \"for the national defense.\"\r\nThe War and Navy Departments hummed with the activity of recruiting, the\r\npreparations of vessels and coast defenses, the purchase of war material\r\nand vessels at home, while agents were sent to Europe to procure all the\r\nwar-ships in the market. Unlimited capital was at their command, and\r\nthe question of price was never an obstacle. When hostilities impended\r\nthe United States was unprepared for war, but by amazing activity,\r\nenergy, and skill the preparations were pushed and completed with a\r\nrapidity that approached the marvelous.\r\n\r\nWar being inevitable, President McKinley sought to gain time for our\r\nconsular representatives to leave Cuba, where the situation daily and\r\nhourly grew more dangerous. Consul Hyatt left Santiago on April 3d, but\r\nConsul-General Lee, always fearless, remained at Havana until April\r\n10th, with the resolution that no American refugees should be left\r\nbehind, where very soon their lives would not be worth an hour's\r\npurchase. Lee landed in Key West April 11th, and on the same day\r\nPresident McKinley sent his message upon the situation to Congress. On\r\nApril 18th the two houses adopted the following:\r\n\r\n   WHEREAS, The abhorrent conditions which have existed for more than\r\n   three years in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have\r\n   shocked the moral sense of the people of the United States, have been\r\n   a disgrace to Christian civilization, culminating, as they have, in\r\n   the destruction of a United States battleship with 266 of its\r\n   officers and crew, while on a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana,\r\n   and cannot longer be endured, as has been set forth by the President\r\n   of the United States in his message to Congress of April 11, 1898,\r\n   upon which the action of Congress was invited; therefore,\r\n\r\n   _Resolved_, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n   States of America, in Congress assembled--\r\n\r\n   First--That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought\r\n   to be, free and independent.\r\n\r\n   Second--That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the\r\n   government of the United States does hereby demand, that the\r\n   government of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government\r\n   in the island of Cuba, and withdraw its land and naval forces from\r\n   Cuba and Cuban waters.\r\n\r\n   Third--That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,\r\n   directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\n   United States, and to call into the actual service of the United\r\n   States the militia of the several States, to such extent as may be\r\n   necessary to carry these resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\n   Fourth--That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or\r\n   intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\r\n   island, except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its\r\n   determination when that is completed to leave the government and\r\n   control of the island to its people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY OF HAVANA AND HARBOR, SHOWING WRECK OF THE\r\nBATTLESHIP MAINE.]\r\n\r\nThis resolution was signed by the President April 20th, and a copy\r\nserved on the Spanish minister, who demanded his passports, and\r\nimmediately left Washington. The contents were telegraphed to United\r\nStates Minister Woodford at Madrid, with instructions to officially\r\ncommunicate them to the Spanish government, giving it until April 23d to\r\nanswer. The Spanish authorities, however, anticipated this action by\r\nsending the American minister his passports on the morning of April\r\n21st. This act was of itself equivalent to a declaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe making of history now went forward with impressive swiftness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLESHIP \"MAINE\" Destroyed in Havana Harbor,\r\nFebruary 15, 1898, by which the lives of two officers and 264 members of\r\nthe crew were lost. This disaster was popularly believed to have been\r\nthe work of Spaniards, and was a potent factor in hastening the war\r\nbetween Spain and the United States.]\r\n\r\nOn April 22d the United States fleet was ordered to blockade Havana. On\r\nthe 24th Spain declared war, and the United States Congress followed\r\nwith a similar declaration on the 25th. The call for 75,000 volunteer\r\ntroops was increased to 125,000 and subsequently to 200,000. The massing\r\nof men and stores was rapidly begun throughout the country. Within a\r\nmonth expeditions were organized for various points of attack,\r\nwar-vessels were bought, and ocean passenger steamers were converted\r\ninto auxiliary cruisers and transports. By the first of July about\r\n40,000 soldiers had been sent to Cuba and the Philippine Islands. The\r\nrapidity with which preparations were made and the victories gained and\r\nthe progress shown by the Americans at once astonished and challenged\r\nthe admiration of foreign nations, who had regarded America as a country\r\nunprepared for war by land or sea. On April 27th, following the\r\ndeclaration of war on the 25th, Admiral Sampson, having previously\r\nblockaded the harbor of Havana, was reconnoitering with three vessels in\r\nthe vicinity of Matanzas, Cuba, when he discovered the Spanish forces\r\nbuilding earthworks, and ventured so close in his efforts to investigate\r\nthe same that a challenge shot was fired from the fortification, Rubal\r\nCava. Admiral Sampson quickly formed the _New York, Cincinnati_, and\r\n_Puritan_ into a triangle and opened fire with their eight-inch guns.\r\nThe action was very spirited on both sides for the space of eighteen\r\nminutes, at the expiration of which time the Spanish batteries were\r\nsilenced and the earthworks destroyed, without casualty on the American\r\nside, though two shells burst dangerously near the _New York_. The last\r\nshot fired by the Americans was from one of the _Puritan's_\r\nthirteen-inch guns, which landed with deadly accuracy in the very centre\r\nof Rubal Cava, and, exploding, completely destroyed the earthworks. This\r\nwas the first action of the war, though it could hardly be dignified by\r\nthe name of a battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF MANILA.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the next engagement would be the bombardment of\r\nMorro Castle, at Havana. But it is the unexpected that often happens in\r\nwar. In the Philippine Islands, on the other side of the world, the\r\nfirst real battle--one of the most remarkable in history--was next to\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nOn April 25th the following dispatch of eight potent words was cabled to\r\nCommodore Dewey on the coast of China: \"Capture or destroy the Spanish\r\nsquadron at Manila.\" \"Never,\" says James Gordon Bennett, \"were\r\ninstructions more effectively carried out. Within seven hours after\r\narriving on the scene of action nothing remained to be done.\" It was on\r\nthe 27th that Dewey sailed from Mirs Bay, China, and on the night of the\r\n30th he lay before the entrance of the harbor of Manila, seven hundred\r\nmiles away. Under the cover of darkness, with all lights extinguished on\r\nhis ships, he daringly steamed into this unknown harbor, which he\r\nbelieved to be strewn with mines, and at daybreak engaged the Spanish\r\nfleet. Commodore Dewey knew it meant everything for him and his fleet to\r\nwin or lose this battle. He was in the enemy's country, 7,000 miles from\r\nhome. The issue of this battle must mean victory, Spanish dungeons, or\r\nthe bottom of the ocean. \"_Keep cool and obey orders_\" was the signal he\r\ngave to his fleet, and then came the order to fire. The Americans had\r\nseven ships, the _Olympia_, _Baltimore_, _Raleigh_, _Petrel_, _Concord_,\r\n_Boston_, and the dispatch-boat _McCullough_. The Spaniards had eleven,\r\nthe _Reina Christina_, _Castilla_, _Don Antonio de Ulloa_, _Isla de\r\nLuzon_, _Isla de Cuba_, _General Lezo_, _Marquis de Duero_, _Cano_,\r\n_Velasco_, _Isla de Mindanao_, and a transport.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Commodore Dewey fought on the offensive, and, after\r\nthe manner of Nelson and Farragut, concentrated his fire upon the\r\nstrongest ships one after another with terrible execution. The Spanish\r\nships were inferior to his, but there were more of them, and they were\r\nunder the protection of the land batteries. The fire of the Americans\r\nwas especially noted for its terrific rapidity and the wonderful\r\naccuracy of its aim. The battle lasted for about five hours, and\r\nresulted in the destruction of all the Spanish ships and the silencing\r\nof the land batteries. The Spanish loss in killed and wounded was\r\nestimated to be fully one thousand men, while on the American side not a\r\nship was even seriously damaged and not a single man was killed\r\noutright, and only six were wounded. More than a month after the battle,\r\nCaptain Charles B. Gridley, Commander of the _Olympia_, died, though his\r\ndeath was the result of an accident received in the discharge of his\r\nduty during the battle, and not from a wound. On May 2d Commodore Dewey\r\ncut the cable connecting Manila with Hong Kong, and destroyed the\r\nfortifications at the entrance of Manila Bay, and took possession of the\r\nnaval station at Cavite. This was to prevent communication between the\r\nPhilippine Islands and the government at Madrid, and necessitated the\r\nsending of Commodore Dewey's official account of the battle by the\r\ndispatch-boat _MCCullough_ to Hong Kong, whence it was cabled to the\r\nUnited States. After its receipt, May 9th, both Houses adopted\r\nresolutions of congratulation to Commodore Dewey and his officers and\r\nmen for their gallantry at Manila, voted an appropriation for medals for\r\nthe crew and a fine sword for the gallant Commander, and also passed a\r\nbill authorizing the President to appoint another rear-admiral, which\r\nhonor was promptly conferred upon Commodore Dewey, accompanied by the\r\nthanks of the President and of the nation for the admirable and heroic\r\nservices rendered his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF CUBA]\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Manila must ever remain a monument to the daring and\r\ncourage of Admiral Dewey. However unevenly matched the two fleets may\r\nhave been, the world agrees with the eminent foreign naval critic who\r\ndeclared: \"This complete victory was the product of forethought, cool,\r\nwell-balanced judgment, discipline, and bravery. It was a magnificent\r\nachievement, and Dewey will go down in history ranking with John Paul\r\nJones and Lord Nelson as a naval hero.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey might have taken possession of the city of Manila\r\nimmediately. He cabled the United States that he could do so, but the\r\nfact remained that he had not sufficient men to care for his ships and\r\nat the same time effect a successful landing in the town of Manila.\r\nTherefore he chose to remain on his ships, and though the city was at\r\nhis mercy, he refrained from a bombardment because he believed it would\r\nlead to a massacre of the Spaniards on the part of the insurgents\r\nsurrounding the city, which it would be beyond his power to stop. This\r\nhumane manifestation toward the conquered foe adds to the lustre of the\r\nhero's crown, and at the same time places the seal of greatness upon the\r\nbrow of the victor. He not only refrained from bombarding the city, but\r\nreceived and cared for the wounded Spaniards upon his own vessels. Thus,\r\nwhile he did all that was required of him without costing his country\r\nthe life of a single citizen, he manifested a spirit of humanity and\r\ngenerosity toward the vanquished foe fully in keeping with the\r\nsympathetic spirit which involved this nation in the war for humanity's\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Manila further demonstrated that a fleet with heavier guns\r\nis virtually invulnerable in a campaign with a squadron bearing lighter\r\nmetal, however gallantly the crew of the latter may fight.\r\n\r\nBefore the Battle of Manila it was recognized that the government had\r\nserious trouble on its hands. On May 4th President McKinley nominated\r\nten new Major-Generals, including Thomas H. Wilson, Fitzhugh Lee, Wm. J.\r\nSewell (who was not commissioned), and Joseph Wheeler, from private\r\nlife, and promoted Brigadier-Generals Breckinridge, Otis, Coppinger,\r\nShafter, Graham, Wade, and Merriam, from the regular army. The\r\norganization and mobilization of troops was promptly begun and rapidly\r\npushed. Meantime our naval vessels were actively cruising around the\r\nIsland of Cuba, expecting the appearance of the Spanish fleet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF MANILA, MAY 1, 1898.\r\n\r\nADMIRAL MONTOJO. ADMIRAL DEWEY.\r\n\r\nThis illustration is historically correct. It shows the positions of the\r\nvessels in that memorable battle which sounded at once the death knell\r\nof Spanish authority in the East and West Indies.]\r\n\r\nOn May 11th the gunboat _Wilmington_, revenue-cutter _Hudson_, and the\r\ntorpedo-boat _Winslow_ entered Cardenas Bay, Cuba, to attack the\r\ndefenses and three small Spanish gunboats that had taken refuge in the\r\nharbor. The _Winslow_ being of light draft took the lead, and when\r\nwithin eight hundred yards of the fort was fired upon with disastrous\r\neffect, being struck eighteen times and rendered helpless. For more than\r\nan hour the frail little craft was at the mercy of the enemy's\r\nbatteries. The revenue-cutter _Hudson_ quickly answered her signal of\r\ndistress by coming to the rescue, and as she was in the act of drawing\r\nthe disabled boat away a shell from the enemy burst on the _Winslow's_\r\ndeck, killing three of her crew outright and wounding many more. Ensign\r\nWorth Bagley, of the _Winslow_, who had recently entered active service,\r\nwas one of the killed. He was the first officer who lost his life in the\r\nwar. The same shell badly wounded Lieutenant Bernadon, Commander of the\r\nboat. The _Hudson_, amidst a rain of fire from the Spanish gunboats and\r\nfortifications, succeeded in towing the _Winslow_ to Key West, where the\r\nbodies of the dead were prepared for burial and the vessel was placed in\r\nrepair. On May 12th the First Infantry landed near Port Cabanas, Cuba,\r\nwith supplies for the insurgents, which they succeeded in delivering\r\nafter a skirmish with the Spanish troops. This was the first land\r\nengagement of the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP SCENE AT CHICKAMAUGA.]\r\n\r\nOn the same date Admiral Sampson's squadron arrived at San Juan, Porto\r\nRico, whither it had gone in the expectation of meeting with Admiral\r\nCervera's fleet, which had sailed westward from the Cape Verde Islands\r\non April 29th, after Portugal's declaration of neutrality. The Spanish\r\nfleet, however, did not materialize, and Admiral Sampson, while on the\r\nground, concluded it would be well to draw the fire of the forts that he\r\nmight at least judge of their strength and efficiency, if indeed he\r\nshould not render them incapable of assisting the Spanish fleet in the\r\nevent of its resorting to this port at a later period. Accordingly,\r\nSampson bombarded the batteries defending San Juan, inflicting much\r\ndamage and sustaining a loss of two men killed and six wounded. The loss\r\nof the enemy is not known. The American war-ships sustained only trivial\r\ninjuries, but after the engagement it could be plainly seen that one end\r\nof Morro Castle was in ruins. The Cabras Island fort was silenced and\r\nthe San Carlos battery was damaged. No shots were aimed at the city by\r\nthe American fleet.\r\n\r\nDeeming it unnecessary to wait for the Spanish war-ships in the vicinity\r\nof San Juan, Sampson withdrew his squadron and sailed westward in the\r\nhope of finding Cervera's fleet, which was dodging about the Caribbean\r\nSea. First it was heard of at the French island, Martinique, whence\r\nafter a short stay it sailed westward. Two days later it halted at the\r\nDutch island, Curacoa, for coal and supplies. After leaving this point\r\nit was again lost sight of. Then began the chase of Commodore Schley and\r\nAdmiral Sampson to catch the fugitive. Schley, with his flying squadron,\r\nsailed from Key West around the western end of Cuba, and Sampson kept\r\nguard over the Windward and other passages to the east of the island. It\r\nwas expected that one or the other of these fleets would encounter the\r\nSpaniard on the open sea, but in this they were mistaken. Cervera was\r\nnot making his way to the Mexican shore on the west, as some said, nor\r\nwas he seeking to slip through one of the passages into the Atlantic and\r\nsail home to Spain, nor attack Commodore Watson's blockading vessels\r\nbefore Havana, according to other expert opinions expressed and widely\r\npublished. For many days the hunt of the war-ships went on like a\r\nfox-chase. On May 21st Commodore Schley blockaded Cienfuegos, supposing\r\nthat Cervera was inside the harbor, but on the 24th he discovered his\r\nmistake and sailed to Santiago, where he lay before the entrance to the\r\nharbor for three days, not knowing whether or not the Spaniard was\r\ninside. On May 30th it was positively discovered that he had Cervera\r\nbottled up in the narrow harbor of Santiago. He had been there since the\r\n19th, and had landed 800 men, 20,000 Mauser rifles, a great supply of\r\nammunition, and four great guns for the defense of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AGAINST SANTIAGO.\r\n\r\nOn May 31st Commodore Schley opened fire on the fortifications at the\r\nmouth of the harbor, which lasted for about half an hour. This was for\r\nthe purpose of discovering the location and strength of the batteries,\r\nsome of which were concealed, and in this he was completely successful.\r\nTwo of the batteries were silenced, and the flagship of the Spaniards,\r\nwhich took part in the engagement, was damaged. The Americans received\r\nno injury to vessels and no loss of men. On June 1st Admiral Sampson\r\narrived before Santiago, and relieved Commodore Schley of the chief\r\ncommand of the forces, then consisting of sixteen war-ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHMOND PEARSON HOBSON.]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sampson, naturally a cautious commander, suffered great\r\napprehension lest Cervera might slip out of the harbor and escape during\r\nthe darkness of the night or the progress of a storm, which would compel\r\nthe blockading fleet to stand far off shore. There was a point in the\r\nchannel wide enough for only one warship to pass at a time, and if this\r\ncould be rendered impassable Cervera's doom would be sealed. How to\r\nreach and close this passage was the difficult problem to be solved. On\r\neither shore of the narrow channel stood frowning forts with cannon, and\r\nthere were other fortifications to be passed before it could be reached.\r\nYoung Lieutenant Richmond Pearson Hobson, a naval engineer, had attached\r\nhimself to Admiral Sampson's flagship, _New York_, just before it sailed\r\nfrom Key West, and it was this young man of less than thirty years who\r\nsolved the problem by a plan originated by Admiral Sampson, which he\r\nexecuted with a heroic daring that finds perhaps no parallel in all\r\nnaval history. At three o'clock A.M., June 3d, in company with seven\r\nvolunteers from the _New York_ and other ships, he took the United\r\nStates collier _Merrimac_, a large vessel with 600 tons of coal on\r\nboard, and started with the purpose of sinking it in the channel. The\r\nchances were ten to one that the batteries from the forts would sink the\r\nvessel before it could reach the narrow neck, and the chances were\r\nhardly one in one hundred that any of the men on board the collier would\r\ncome out of this daring attempt alive. The ship had hardly started when\r\nthe forts opened fire, and amid the thunder of artillery and a rain of\r\nsteel and bursting shells the boat with its eight brave heroes held on\r\nits way, as steadily as if they knew not their danger. The channel was\r\nreached, and the boat turned across the channel. The sea-doors were\r\nopened and torpedoes exploded by the intrepid crew, sinking the vessel\r\nalmost instantly, but not in the position desired. As the ship went down\r\nthe men, with side-arms buckled on, took to a small boat, and, escape\r\nbeing impossible, they surrendered to the enemy. It seems scarcely less\r\nthan a miracle that any of the eight men escaped, yet the fact remained\r\nthat not one of them was seriously injured. The Spaniards were so\r\nimpressed with this act of bravery and heroism that they treated the\r\nprisoners with the utmost courtesy, confined them in Morro Castle, and\r\nAdmiral Cervera promptly sent a special officer, under a flag of truce,\r\nto inform Admiral Sampson of their safety. The prisoners were kept\r\nconfined in Morro Castle for some days, when they were removed to a\r\nplace of greater safety, where they were held until exchanged on July\r\n7th.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BOMBARDMENT OF SANTIAGO AND THE COMING OF THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June the American fleet under Admiral Sampson bombarded\r\nthe forts of Santiago for about three hours. The gunners were all\r\ninstructed, however, to spare Morro Castle lest they should inflict\r\ninjury upon Hobson and his heroic companions, who were then confined\r\nwithin its walls. Nearly all of the fortifications at the entrance of\r\nthe harbor were silenced. An examination after the fleet had withdrawn\r\nrevealed the fact that no lives were lost on the American side, and none\r\nof the vessels were seriously injured. The Spanish ship _Reina Mercedes_\r\nwas sunk in the harbor, she being the only ship from the enemy's fleet\r\nwhich ventured within the range of the American's guns.\r\n\r\nThe danger of entering the narrow harbor in the face of Cervera's fleet\r\nrendered it necessary to take the city by land, and the government began\r\npreparations to send General Shafter with a large force from Tampa to\r\naid the fleet in reducing the city. Some 15,000 men, including the now\r\nfamous Rough Riders of New York, were hurried upon transports, and under\r\nthe greatest convoy of gunboats, cruisers, and battleships which ever\r\nescorted an army started for the western end of the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nBut the honor of making the first landing on Cuban soil belongs to the\r\nmarines. It was on June the 10th, a few days before the army of General\r\nShafter sailed from Tampa, that a landing was effected by Colonel\r\nHuntington's six hundred marines at Caimanera, Guantanamo Bay, some\r\ndistance east of Santiago. The object of this landing was twofold:\r\nfirst, to secure a place where our war-ships could safely take on coal\r\nfrom colliers, and, second, to unite if possible with the insurgents in\r\nharassing the Spaniards until General Shafter's army could arrive.\r\nFurthermore, Guantanamo Bay furnished the American ships a safe harbor\r\nin case of storm.\r\n\r\nIn the whole history of the war few more thrilling passages are to be\r\nfound than the record of this brave band's achievements. The place of\r\nlanding was a low, round, bush-covered hill on the eastern side of the\r\nbay. On the crest of the hill was a small clearing occupied by an\r\nadvance post of the Spanish army. When the marines landed and began to\r\nclimb the hill, the enemy, with little resistance, retreated to the\r\nwoods, and the marines were soon occupying the cleared space abandoned\r\nby them. They had scarcely begun to compliment themselves on their easy\r\nvictory when they discovered that the retreat had only been a snare to\r\nlure them into the open space, while unfortunately all around the\r\nclearing the woods grew thick, and their unprotected position was also\r\noverlooked by a range of higher hills covered with a dense undergrowth.\r\nThus the Spanish were able under cover of the bushes to creep close up\r\nto our forces, and they soon began to fire upon them from the higher\r\nground of the wooded range. The marines replied vigorously to the fire\r\nof their hidden foe, and thus continued their hit-and-miss engagement\r\nfor a period of four days and nights, with only occasional\r\nintermissions. Perhaps the poor marksmanship of the Spaniards is to be\r\nthanked for the fact that they were not utterly annihilated. On the\r\nfourth day the Spanish gave up the contest and abandoned the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE.]\r\n\r\nMajor Henry C. Cochrane, second in command, states that he slept only an\r\nhour and a half in the four days, and that many of his men became so\r\nexhausted that they fell asleep standing on their feet with their rifles\r\nin their hands. It is remarkable that during the four days the Americans\r\nlost only six killed and about twenty wounded. The Spaniards suffered a\r\nloss several times as great, fifteen of them having been found by the\r\nAmericans dead on the field. It is not known how many they carried away\r\nor how many were wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING OF SHAFTER'S ARMY.\r\n\r\nOn June 13th troops began to leave Tampa and Key West for operations\r\nagainst Santiago, and on June 20th the transports bearing them arrived\r\noff that city. Two days later General Shafter landed his army of 16,000\r\nsoldiers at Daiquiri, a short distance east of the entrance to the\r\nharbor, with the loss of only two men, and they by accident. Before the\r\ncoming of the troops the Spanish had evacuated the village of Daiquiri,\r\nwhich is a little inland from the anchorage bearing the same name, and\r\nset fire to the town, blowing up two magazines and destroying the\r\nrailroad roundhouse containing several locomotives. As the transports\r\nneared the landing-place Sampson's ships opened fire upon Juragua,\r\nengaging all the forts for about six miles to the west. This was done to\r\ndistract the attention of the Spanish from the landing soldiers, and was\r\nentirely successful. After the forts were silenced the _New Orleans_ and\r\nseveral gunboats shelled the woods in advance of the landing troops. The\r\nsoldiers went ashore in full fighting trim, each man carrying thirty-six\r\nrations, two hundred rounds of ammunition for his rifle, and a\r\nshelter-tent.\r\n\r\nWhile the troops were landing at Daiquiri, the battleship _Texas_,\r\nhitherto considered as an unfortunate ship by the attaches of the navy,\r\ncompletely changed her reputation and distinguished herself by assailing\r\nand silencing, unaided, the Spanish battery La Socapa at Santiago, which\r\nhad hitherto withstood the attacks against it, though all the ships of\r\nCommodore Schley's command had twice fiercely bombarded it without\r\nresult. Captain Philip and his men were complimented in warm terms of\r\npraise by Admiral Sampson. The _Texas_ was struck but once, and that by\r\nthe last shot from the Spanish fort, killing one man and wounding eight\r\nothers, seriously damaging the ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL WILLIAM T. SAMPSON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VICTORY OF THE ROUGH RIDERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICANS STORMING SAN JUAN HILL\r\n\r\nThe most dramatic scene and the most destructive battle of the Spanish\r\nWar.]\r\n\r\nOn June 24th the force under General Shafter reached Juragua, and the\r\nbattle by land was now really to begin. It was about ten miles out from\r\nSantiago, at a point known as La Guasima. The country was covered with\r\nhigh grass and chaparral, and in this and on the wooded hills a strong\r\nforce of Spaniards was hidden. Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt's Rough\r\nRiders, technically known as the First Volunteer Cavalry, under command\r\nof Colonel Wood, were in the fight, and it is to their bravery and dash\r\nthat the glory of the day chiefly belongs. Troops under command of\r\nGeneral Young had been sent out in advance, with the Rough Riders on his\r\nflank. There were about 1,200 of the cavalry in all, including the Rough\r\nRiders and the First and Tenth Regulars. They encountered a body of two\r\nthousand Spaniards in a thicket, whom they fought dismounted. The\r\nvolunteers were especially eager for the fight, and, perhaps due\r\nsomewhat to their own imprudence, were led into an ambuscade, as perfect\r\nas was ever planned by an Indian. The main body of the Spaniards was\r\nposted on a hill approached by two heavily wooded slopes and fortified\r\nby two blockhouses, flanked by intrenchments of stones and fallen trees.\r\nAt the bottom of these hills run two roads, along one of which the Rough\r\nRiders marched, and along the other eight troops of the Eighth and Tenth\r\nCavalry, under General Young. These roads are little more than gullies,\r\nvery narrow, and at places almost impassable. Nearly half a mile\r\nseparated Roosevelt's men from the Regulars, and it was in these trails\r\nthat the battle began.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODORE ROOSEVELT.]\r\n\r\nFor an hour they held their position in the midst of an unseen force,\r\nwhich poured a perfect hail of bullets upon them from in front and on\r\nboth sides. At length, seeing that their only way of escape was by\r\ndashing boldly at the hidden foe, Colonel Wood took command on the right\r\nof his column of Rough Riders, placing Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt at\r\nthe left, and thus, with a rousing yell, they led their soldiers in a\r\nrushing charge before which the Spaniards fled from the hills and the\r\nvictorious assailants took the blockhouses. The Americans had sixteen\r\nkilled and fifty-two wounded, forty-two of the casualties occurring to\r\nthe Rough Riders and twenty-six among the Regulars. It is estimated that\r\nthe Spanish killed were nearly or quite one hundred. Thirty-seven were\r\nfound by the Americans dead on the ground. They had carried off their\r\nwounded, and doubtless thought they had taken most of the killed away\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR THE ASSAULT UPON SANTIAGO.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Rough Riders and the Regulars at La Guasima, though\r\nso dearly bought, stimulated the soldiers of the whole army with the\r\nspirit of war and the desire for an opportunity to join in the conquest.\r\nThey had not long to wait. The advance upon Santiago was vigorously\r\nprosecuted on the land side, while the ships stood guard over the\r\nentrapped Spanish Admiral Cervera in the harbor, and, anon, shelled\r\nevery fort that manifested signs of activity. On June 25th, Sevilla,\r\nwithin sight of Santiago, was taken by General Chaffee, and an advance\r\nupon the city was planned to be made in three columns by way of Altares,\r\nFirmeza, and Juragua. General Garcia with 5,000 Cuban insurgents had\r\nplaced himself some time before at the command of the American leader.\r\nOn the 28th of June another large expedition of troops was landed, so\r\nthat the entire force under General Shafter, including the Cuban allies,\r\nnumbered over 22,000 fighting men.\r\n\r\nThe enemy fell back at all points until the right of the American column\r\nwas within three miles of Santiago, and by the end of June the two\r\narmies had well-defined positions. The Spanish intrenchments extended\r\naround the city, being kept at a distance of about three and one-half\r\nmiles from the corporation limits. The trenches were occupied by about\r\n12,000 Spanish soldiers, and there were some good fortifications along\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of General Shafter to distribute his forces so as to\r\nface this entire line as nearly as possible. A week was consumed, after\r\nthe landing was completed, in making these arrangements and in sending\r\nforward the artillery, during which time the battle of La Guasima,\r\nreferred to, with some minor affairs, had occurred. Meantime the ships\r\nof Admiral Sampson had dragged up the cables and connected them by\r\ntap-wires with Shafter's headquarters, thus establishing communication\r\ndirectly with Washington from the scene of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF SAN JUAN AND EL CANEY.\r\n\r\nThe attack began July 1st, involving the whole line, but the main\r\nstruggle occurred opposite the left centre of the column on the heights\r\nof San Juan, and the next greatest engagement was on the right of the\r\nAmerican line at the little town of El Caney. These two points are\r\nseveral miles apart, the city of Santiago occupying very nearly the apex\r\nof a triangle of which a line connecting these two positions would form\r\nthe base. John R. Church thus described the battles of July 1st and 2d:\r\n\r\n   \"El Caney was taken by General Lawton's men after a sharp contest and\r\n   severe loss on both sides. Here as everywhere there were blockhouses\r\n   and trenches to be carried in the face of a hot fire from Mauser\r\n   rifles, and the rifles were well served. The jungle must disturb the\r\n   aim seriously, for our men did not suffer severely while under its\r\n   cover, but in crossing clearings the rapid fire of the repeating\r\n   rifles told with deadly effect. The object of the attack on El Caney\r\n   was to crush the Spanish lines at a point near the city and allow us\r\n   to gain a high hill from which the place could be bombarded if\r\n   necessary. In all of this we were entirely successful. The engagement\r\n   began at 6.40 A.M., and by 4 o'clock the Spaniards were forced to\r\n   abandon the place and retreat toward their lines nearer the city. The\r\n   fight was opened by Capron's battery, at a range of 2,400 yards, and\r\n   the troops engaged were Chaffee's brigade, the Seventh, Twelfth, and\r\n   Seventeenth Infantry, who moved on Caney from the east; Colonel\r\n   Miles' brigade of the First, Fourth, and Twenty-fifth Infantry,\r\n   operating from the south; while Ludlow's brigade, containing the\r\n   Eighth and Twenty-second Infantry and Second Massachusetts, made a\r\n   detour to attack from the southwest. The Spanish force is thought to\r\n   have been 1,500 to 2,000 strong. It certainly fought our men for nine\r\n   hours, but of course had the advantage of a fort and strong\r\n   intrenchments.\r\n\r\n   \"The operations of our centre were calculated to cut the\r\n   communications of Santiago with El Morro and permit our forces to\r\n   advance to the bay, and the principal effort of General Linares, the\r\n   Spanish commander in the field, seems to have been to defeat this\r\n   movement. He had fortified San Juan strongly, throwing up on it\r\n   intrenchments that in the hands of a more determined force would have\r\n   been impregnable.\r\n\r\n   \"The battle of San Juan was opened by Grimes' battery, to which the\r\n   enemy replied with shrapnell. The cavalry, dismounted, supported by\r\n   Hawkins' brigade, advanced up the valley from the hill of El Pozo,\r\n   forded several streams, where they lost heavily, and deployed at the\r\n   foot of the series of hills known as San Juan under a sharp fire from\r\n   all sides, which was exceedingly annoying because the enemy could not\r\n   be discerned, owing to the long range and smokeless powder. They were\r\n   under fire for two hours before the charge could be made and a\r\n   position reached under the brow of the hill. It was not until nearly\r\n   4 o'clock that the neighboring hills were occupied by our troops and\r\n   the final successful effort to crown the ridge could be made. The\r\n   obstacles interposed by the Spaniards made these charges anything but\r\n   the 'rushes' which war histories mention so often. They were slow and\r\n   painful advances through difficult obstacles and a withering fire.\r\n   The last 'charge' continued an hour, but at 4.45 the firing ceased,\r\n   with San Juan in our possession.\r\n\r\n   \"The Spaniards made liberal use of barbed-wire fencing, which proved\r\n   to  be so effective as a stop to our advance that it is likely to\r\n   take its place among approved defensive materials in future wars. It\r\n   was used in two ways: Wires were stretched near the ground to trip up\r\n   our men when on the run. Beyond them were fences in parallel lines,\r\n   some being too high to be vaulted over.\r\n\r\n   \"The object of our attack was a blockhouse on the top of the hill of\r\n   San Juan, guarded by trenches and the defenses spoken of, a mile and\r\n   a half long. Our troops advanced steadily against a hot fire\r\n   maintained by the enemy, who used their rifles with accuracy, but did\r\n   not cling to their works stubbornly when we reached them. San Juan\r\n   was carried in the afternoon. The attack on Aguadores was also\r\n   successful, though it was not intended to be more than a feint to\r\n   draw off men who might otherwise have increased our difficulties at\r\n   San Juan. By nightfall General Shafter was able to telegraph that he\r\n   had carried all the outworks and was within three-quarters of a mile\r\n   of the city.\r\n\r\n   \"Though the enemy's lines were broken in the principal places, they\r\n   yielded no more than was forced from them, and the battle was resumed\r\n   on the 2d. The last day saw our left flank resting on the bay and our\r\n   lines drawn around the city within easy gun-fire. Fears were\r\n   entertained that the enemy would evacuate the place, and the right\r\n   flank was pushed around to the north and eventually to the northwest\r\n   of the city.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fight at San Juan General Linares, commanding the Spanish forces\r\nin Santiago, was severely wounded, and transferred the command to\r\nGeneral Jose Toral, second in authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF CERVERA'S FLEET.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous two days' fight by land the fleet of Admiral Cervera\r\nin Santiago harbor had taken an active part in shelling our positions,\r\nwith no inconsiderable effect; and General Shafter, largely on this\r\naccount, had about despaired of taking the city, with the force at his\r\ncommand. In fact, he went so far on the morning of July 3d as to\r\ntelegraph Washington that his losses had been greatly underestimated,\r\nthat he met with stronger resistance than he had anticipated, and was\r\nseriously considering falling back to a position five miles to the rear\r\nto await reinforcements. He was also anxious for an interview with\r\nAdmiral Sampson. The fleet had been shelling the enemy during the two\r\ndays' fight, but it was necessary that the navy and army should have an\r\nunderstanding; and at 8.30 o'clock on Sunday morning Admiral Sampson\r\nwith his flagship _New York_ steamed eastward for the purpose of\r\nconferring with the general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OREGON.\r\n\r\nOne of the most renowned ships of the American Navy is the mighty\r\nBattleship Oregon. Her famous run from San Francisco around Cape Horn to\r\ntake part in the Battle of Santiago has never been equalled by any\r\nbattleship in the world's history. After she won fame in the destruction\r\nof Cervera's fleet she was ordered to Manila by Admiral Dewey \"for\r\npolitical reasons\" and remained there throughout the Philippine War\r\nhurling her 13-inch shells into the Insurgent ranks when occasion\r\nrequired.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles telegraphed General Shafter, in response to his request to\r\nhold his position, that he would be with him in a week with strong\r\nreinforcements; and he promptly started two expeditions, aggregating\r\nover 6,000 men, which reached Santiago on the 8th and 10th\r\nrespectively, in time to witness the closing engagements and surrender\r\nof the city. But fortune again favored our cause and completely changed\r\nthe situation, unexpectedly to the American commanders of the land and\r\nnaval forces.\r\n\r\nIt was on Sunday morning, July 3d, just before Sampson landed to meet\r\nShafter, that Admiral Cervera, in obedience to commands from his home\r\ngovernment, endeavored to run his fleet past the blockading squadron of\r\nthe Americans, with the result that all of his ships were destroyed,\r\nnearly 500 of his men killed and wounded, and himself and about 1,300\r\nothers were made prisoners. This naval engagement was one of the most\r\ndramatic and terrible in all the history of conflict upon the seas, and,\r\nas it was really the beginning of the end of what promised to be a long\r\nand terrible struggle, it was undoubtedly the most important battle of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL WINFIELD SCOTT SCHLEY.]\r\n\r\nIt had been just one month, to a day, since Hobson sunk the _Merrimac_\r\nat the harbor's mouth to keep Cervera in, and for nearly one month and a\r\nhalf the fleets of Schley and Sampson had lain, like watch-dogs before\r\nthe gate, without for one moment relaxing their vigilance. The quiet of\r\nSunday morning brooded over the scene. Even the winds seemed resting\r\nfrom their labors and the sea lay smooth as glass. For two days before,\r\nJuly 1st and 2d, the fleets had bombarded the forts of Santiago for the\r\nfourth time, and all the ships, except the _Oregon_, had steam down so\r\nlow as to allow them a speed of only five knots an hour. At half-past\r\nnine o'clock the bugler sounded the call to quarters, and the Jackies\r\nappeared on deck rigged in their cleanest clothes for their regular\r\nSunday inspection. On board the _Texas_ the devout Captain Philip had\r\nsounded the trumpet-call to religious services. In an instant a line of\r\nsmoke was seen coming out of the harbor by the watch on the _Iowa_, and\r\nfrom that vessel's yard a signal was run up--\"The enemy is escaping to\r\nthe westward.\" Simultaneously, from her bridge a six-pounder boomed on\r\nthe still air to draw the attention of the other ships to her\r\nfluttering signal. On every vessel white masses were seen scrambling\r\nforward. Jackies and firemen tumbled over one another rushing to their\r\nstations. Officers jumped into the turrets through manholes, dressed in\r\ntheir best uniforms, and captains rushed to their conning towers. There\r\nwas no time to waste--scarcely enough to get the battle-hatches screwed\r\non tight. Jingle, jingle, went the signal-bells in the engine-rooms, and\r\n\"Steam! Steam!\" the captains cried through the tubes. Far below decks,\r\nin 125 to 150 degrees of heat, naked men shoveled in the black coal and\r\nforced drafts were put on.\r\n\r\nOne minute after the _Iowa_ fired her signal-gun she was moving toward\r\nthe harbor. From under the Castle of Morro came Admiral Cervera's\r\nflagship, the _Infanta Maria Teresa_, followed by her sister armored\r\ncruisers, _Almirante Oquendo_ and _Vizcaya_--so much alike that they\r\ncould not be distinguished at any distance. There was also the splendid\r\n_Cristobal Colon_, and after them all the two fine torpedo-boat\r\ndestroyers, _Pluton_ and _Furor_. The _Teresa_ opened fire as she\r\nsighted the American vessels, as did all of her companions, and the\r\nforts from the heights belched forth at the same time. Countless geysers\r\naround our slowly approaching battleships showed where the Spanish\r\nshells exploded in the water. The Americans replied. The battle was on,\r\nbut at a long range of two or three miles, so that the secondary\r\nbatteries could not be called into use; but thirteen-inch shells from\r\nthe _Oregon_ and _Indiana_ and the twelve-inch shells from the _Texas_\r\nand _Iowa_ were churning up the water around the enemy. At this juncture\r\nit seemed impossible for the Americans to head off the Spanish cruisers\r\nfrom passing the western point, for they had come out of the harbor at a\r\nspeed of thirteen and one-half knots an hour, for which the blockading\r\nfleet was not prepared. But Admiral Sampson's instructions were simple\r\nand well understood--\"Should the enemy come out, close in and head him\r\noff\"--and every ship was now endeavoring to obey that standing command\r\nwhile they piled on coal and steamed up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, from the rapidly approaching _New York_ the signal\r\nfluttered--\"Close into the mouth of the harbor and engage the enemy;\"\r\nbut the admiral was too far away, or the men were too busy to see this\r\nsignal, which they were, nevertheless, obeying to the letter.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the leading Spanish cruiser had almost reached the\r\nwestern point of the bay, and when it was evident that Cervera was\r\nleading his entire fleet in one direction, that the battle commenced in\r\nits fury. The _Iowa_ and the _Oregon_ headed straight for the shore,\r\nintending to ram if possible one or more of the Spaniards. The _Indiana_\r\nand the _Texas_ were following, and the _Brooklyn_, in the endeavor to\r\ncut off the advance ship, was headed straight for the western point. The\r\nlittle unprotected _Gloucester_ steamed right across the harbor mouth\r\nand engaged the _Oquendo_ at closer range than any of the other ships,\r\nat the same time firing on the _Furor_ and _Pluton_, which were rapidly\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nIt then became apparent that the _Oregon_ and _Iowa_ could not ram, and\r\nthat the _Brooklyn_ could not head them off, as she had hoped, and,\r\nturning in a parallel course with them, a running fight ensued.\r\nBroadside after broadside came fast with terrific slaughter. The\r\nrapid-fire guns of the _Iowa_ nearest the _Teresa_ enveloped the former\r\nvessel in a mantle of smoke and flame. She was followed by the _Oregon_,\r\n_Indiana_, _Texas_, and _Brooklyn_, all pouring a rain of red-hot steel\r\nand exploding shell into the fleeing cruisers as they passed along in\r\ntheir desperate effort to escape. The _Furor_ and _Pluton_ dashed like\r\nmad colts for the _Brooklyn_, and Commodore Schley signaled--\"Repel\r\ntorpedo-destroyers.\" Some of the heavy ships turned their guns upon the\r\nlittle monsters. It was short work. Clouds of black smoke rising from\r\ntheir thin sides showed how seriously they suffered as they floundered\r\nin the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL JOHN C. WATSON.\r\n\r\nCommander of the Blockading Fleet at Havana.]\r\n\r\nThe _Brooklyn_ and _Oregon_ dashed on after the cruisers, followed by\r\nthe other big ships, leaving the _Furor_ and _Pluton_ to the\r\n_Gloucester_, hoping the _New York_, which was coming in the distance,\r\nwould arrive in time to help her out if she needed it. The firing from\r\nthe main and second batteries of all the battleships--_Oregon_, _Iowa_,\r\n_Texas_--and the cruiser _Brooklyn_ was turned upon the _Vizcaya_,\r\n_Teresa_, and _Oquendo_ with such terrific broadsides and accuracy of\r\naim that the Spaniards were driven from their guns repeatedly; but the\r\nofficers gave the men liquor and drove them back, beating and sometimes\r\nshooting down those who weakened, without mercy; but under the terrific\r\nfire of the Americans the poor wretches were again driven away or fell\r\nmangled by their guns or stunned from the concussions of the missiles on\r\nthe sides of their ships.\r\n\r\nPresently flames and smoke burst out from the _Teresa_ and the\r\n_Oquendo_. The fire leaped from the port-holes; and amid the din of\r\nbattle and above it all rose the wild cheers of the Americans as both\r\nthese splendid ships slowly reeled like drunken men and headed for the\r\nshore. \"They are on fire! We've finished them,\" shouted the gunners.\r\nDown came the Spanish flags. The news went all over the ships--it being\r\ncommanded by Commodore Schley to keep everyone informed, even those far\r\nbelow in the fire-rooms--and from engineers and firemen in the hot\r\nbowels of the great leviathans to the men in the fighting-tops the\r\nwelkin rang until the shins reverberated with exuberant cheers.\r\n\r\nThis was 10.20 A.M. Previously, the two torpedo boats had gone down, and\r\nonly two dozen of their 140 men survived, these having been picked up by\r\nthe _Gloucester_, which plucky little unprotected \"dare-devil,\" not\r\ncontent with the destruction she had courted and escaped only as one of\r\nthe unexplainable mysteries of Spanish gunnery, was coming up to join\r\nthe chase after bigger game; and it was to Lieutenant Wainwright, her\r\ncommander, that Admiral Cervera surrendered. The _Maine was_ avenged.\r\n(Lieutenant Wainwright was executive officer on that ill-fated vessel\r\nwhen she was blown up February 15th.) Cervera was wounded, hatless, and\r\nalmost naked when he was taken on board the _Gloucester_. Lieutenant\r\nWainwright cordially saluted him and grasped him by the hand, saying, \"I\r\ncongratulate you, Admiral Cervera, upon as gallant a fight as was ever\r\nmade upon the sea.\" He placed his cabin at the service of Cervera and\r\nhis officers, while his surgeon dressed their wounds and his men did all\r\nthey could for their comfort--Wainwright supplying the admiral with\r\nclothing. Cervera was overcome with emotion, and the face of the old\r\ngray-bearded warrior was suffused in tears. The _Iowa_ and _Indiana_\r\ncame up soon after the _Gloucester_ and assisted in the rescue of the\r\ndrowning Spaniards from the _Oquendo_ and _Teresa_, after which they all\r\nhurried on after the vanishing _Brooklyn_ and _Oregon_, which were\r\npursuing the _Vizcaya_ and _Colon_, the only two remaining vessels of\r\nCervera's splendid fleet. From pursuer and pursued the smoke rose in\r\nvolumes and the booming guns over the waters sang the song of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four minutes after the sinking of the _Teresa_ and _Oquendo_,\r\nthe _Vizcaya_, riddled by the _Oregon's_ great shells and burning\r\nfiercely, hauled down her flag and headed for the shore, where she hung\r\nupon the rocks. In a dying effort she had tried to ram the _Brooklyn_,\r\nbut the fire of the big cruiser was too hot for her. The _Texas_ and the\r\nlittle _Vixen_ were seen to be about a mile to the rear, and the\r\n_Vizcaya_ was left to them and the _Iowa_, the latter staying by her\r\nfinally, while the _Texas_ and _Vixen_ followed on.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a forlorn hope to catch the _Colon_. She was four and\r\none-half miles away. But the _Brooklyn_ and the _Oregon_ were running\r\nlike express trains, and the _Texas_ sped after the fugitives with all\r\nher might. The chase lasted two hours. Firing ceased, and every power of\r\nthe ship and the nerve of commodore, captains, and officers were devoted\r\nto increasing the speed. Men from the guns, naked to the waist and\r\nperspiring in streams, were called on deck for rest and an airing. It\r\nwas a grimy and dirty but jolly set of Jackies, and jokes were merrily\r\ncracked as they sped on and waited. Only the men in the fire-rooms were\r\nworking as never before. It was their battle now, a battle of speed. At\r\n12.30 it was seen the Americans were gaining. Cheers went up and all was\r\nmade ready. \"We may wing that fellow yet,\" said Commodore Schley, as he\r\ncommanded Captain Clark to try a big thirteen-inch shell. \"Remember the\r\nMaine\" was flung out on a pennant from the mast-head of the _Oregon_,\r\nand at 8,500 yards she began to send her 1,000-pound shots shrieking\r\nover the _Brooklyn_ after the flying Spaniard. One threw tons of water\r\non board the fugitive, and the _Brooklyn_ a few minutes later with\r\neight-inch guns began to pelt her sides. Everyone expected a game fight\r\nfrom the proud and splendid _Colon_ with her smokeless powder and\r\nrapid-fire guns; but all were surprised when, after a feeble resistance,\r\nat 1.15 o'clock her captain struck his colors and ran his ship ashore\r\nsixty miles from Santiago, opening her sea-valves to sink her after she\r\nhad surrendered.\r\n\r\nVictory was at last complete. As the _Brooklyn_ and _Oregon_ moved upon\r\nthe prey word of the surrender was sent below, and naked men poured out\r\nof the fire-rooms, black with smoke and dirt and glistening with\r\nperspiration, but wild with joy. Commodore Schley gazed down at the\r\ngrimy, gruesome, joyous firemen with glistening eyes suspicious of\r\ntears, and said, in a husky voice, eloquent with emotion, \"_Those are\r\nthe fellows who made this day_.\" Then he signaled--\"The enemy has\r\nsurrendered.\" The _Texas_, five miles to the east, repeated the signal\r\nto Admiral Sampson some miles further away, coming at top speed of the\r\n_New York_. Next the commodore signaled the admiral--\"_A glorious\r\nvictory has been achieved. Details communicated later_.\" And then, to\r\nall the ships, \"_This is a great day for our country_,\" all of which\r\nwere repeated by the _Texas_ to the ships further east. The cheering was\r\nwild. Such a scene was never, perhaps, witnessed upon the ocean. Admiral\r\nSampson arrived before the _Colon_ sank, and placing the great nose of\r\nthe _New York_ against that vessel pushed her into shallow water, where\r\nshe sank, but was not entirely submerged. Thus perished from the earth\r\nthe bulk of the sea power of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish losses were 1,800 men killed, wounded, and made prisoners,\r\nand six ships destroyed or sunk, the property loss being about\r\n$12,000,000. The American loss was one man killed and three wounded, all\r\nfrom the _Brooklyn_, a result little short of a miracle from the fact\r\nthat the _Brooklyn_ was hit thirty-six times, and nearly all the ships\r\nwere struck more than once.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were treated with the utmost courtesy. Many of them were\r\ntaken or rescued entirely naked, and scores of them were wounded. Their\r\nbehavior was manly and their fortitude won the admiration of their\r\ncaptors. Whatever may be said of Spanish marksmanship, there is no\r\ndiscount on Spanish courage. After a short detention Cervera and his\r\ncaptured sailors were sent north to New Hampshire and thence to\r\nAnnapolis, where they were held until released by order of President\r\nMcKinley, August 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREATENED BOMBARDMENT OF SANTIAGO AND FLIGHT OF THE REFUGEES.\r\n\r\nOn July 3d, while the great naval duel was in progress upon the sea,\r\nGeneral Shafter demanded the surrender of Santiago upon pain of\r\nbombardment. The demand was refused by General Toral, who commanded the\r\nforces after the wounding of General Linares. General Shafter stated\r\nthat he would postpone the bombardment until noon of July 5th to allow\r\nforeigners and non-combatants to get out of the city, and he urged\r\nGeneral Toral in the name of humanity to use his influence and aid to\r\nfacilitate the rapid departure of unarmed citizens and foreigners.\r\nAccordingly late in the afternoon of July 4th General Toral posted\r\nnotices upon the walls of Santiago advising all women, children, and\r\nnon-combatants that between five and nine o'clock on the morning of the\r\n5th they might pass out by any gate of the city, all pilgrims going on\r\nfoot, no carriages being allowed, and stating that stretchers would be\r\nprovided for the crippled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL WILLIAM R. SHAFTER.]\r\n\r\nPromptly at five o'clock on the following morning a great line of\r\npilgrims wound out of Santiago. It was no rabble, but well-behaved\r\ncrowds of men and women, with great droves of children. About four\r\nhundred persons were carried out on litters. Many of the poorer women\r\nwore large crucifixes and some entered El Caney telling their beads. But\r\nthere were many not so fortunate as to reach the city. Along the\r\nhighroads in all directions thousands of families squatted entirely\r\nwithout food or shelter, and many deaths occurred among them. The Red\r\nCross Society did much to relieve the suffering, but it lacked means of\r\ntransporting supplies to the front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURRENDER OF SANTIAGO, JULY 17, 1898.\r\n\r\nAfter a little ceremony the two commanding Generals faced each other,\r\nand General Toral, speaking in Spanish, said: \"Through fate I am forced\r\nto surrender to General Shafter of the American Army the city and\r\nstrongholds of the City of Santiago.\" General Shafter in reply said: \"I\r\nreceive the city in the name of the Government of the United States.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the flag of truce was still flying on the morning of July 6th a\r\ncommunication was received from General Toral, requesting that the time\r\nof truce be further extended, as he wanted to communicate again with the\r\nSpanish government at Madrid concerning the surrender of the city; and,\r\nfurther, that the cable operators, who were Englishmen and had fled to\r\nEl Caney with the refugees, be returned to the city that he might do so.\r\nGeneral Shafter extended the truce until four o'clock on Sunday, July\r\n10th, and the operators returned from El Caney to work the wires for\r\nGeneral Toral. During all this time the refugees continued to throng the\r\nroads to Siboney and El Caney, until 20,000 fugitives were congregated\r\nat the two points. It is a disgraceful fact, however, that while this\r\ntruce was granted at the request of the Spanish general, it was taken\r\nadvantage of by the troops under him to loot the city. Both Cuban and\r\nSpanish families suffered from their rapacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL NELSON A. MILES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST BATTLE AND THE SURRENDER OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\nOn July 8th and 10th the two expeditions of General Miles arrived,\r\nreinforcing General Shafter's army with over 6,000 men. General Toral\r\nwas acquainted with the fact of their presence, and General Miles\r\nurgently impressed upon him that further resistance could but result in\r\na useless loss of life. The Spanish commander replied that he had not\r\nreceived permission to surrender, and if the Americans would not wait\r\nlonger he could only obey orders of his government, and that he and his\r\nmen would die fighting. Accordingly a joint bombardment by the army and\r\nnavy was begun. The artillery reply of the Spaniards was feeble and\r\nspiritless, though our attack on the city was chiefly with artillery.\r\nThey seemed to depend most upon their small arms, and returned the\r\nvolleys fired from the trenches vigorously. Our lines were elaborately\r\nprotected with over 22,000 sand-bags, while the Spaniards were protected\r\nwith bamboo poles filled with earth. In this engagement the dynamite gun\r\nof the Rough Riders did excellent service, striking the enemy's\r\ntrenches and blowing field-pieces into the air. The bombardment\r\ncontinued until the afternoon of the second day, when a flag of truce\r\nwas displayed over the city. It was thought that General Toral was about\r\nto surrender, but instead he only asked more time.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of General Miles, General Shafter consented to another\r\ntruce, and, at last, on July 14th, after an interview with Generals\r\nMiles and Shafter, in which he agreed to give up the city on condition\r\nthat the army would be returned to Spain at the expense of America,\r\nGeneral Toral surrendered. On July 16th the agreement, with the formal\r\napproval of the Madrid and Washington governments, was signed in\r\nduplicate by the commissioners, each side retaining a copy. This event\r\nwas accepted throughout the world as marking the end of the\r\nSpanish-American War.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the surrender involved the following points:\r\n\r\n   \"(1) The 20,000 refugees at El Caney and Siboney to be sent back to\r\n   the city. (2) An American infantry patrol to be posted on the roads\r\n   surrounding the city and in the country between it and the American\r\n   cavalry. (3) Our hospital corps to give attention, as far as\r\n   possible, to the sick and wounded Spanish soldiers in Santiago. (4)\r\n   All the Spanish troops in the province, except ten thousand men at\r\n   Holguin, under command of General Luque, to come into the city and\r\n   surrender. (5) The guns and defenses of the city to be turned over to\r\n   the Americans in good condition. (6) The Americans to have full use\r\n   of the Juragua Railroad, which belongs to the Spanish government. (7)\r\n   The Spaniards to surrender their arms. (8) All the Spaniards to be\r\n   conveyed to Spain on board of American transports with the least\r\n   possible delay, and be permitted to take portable church property\r\n   with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING POSSESSION OF SANTIAGO AND RAISING THE AMERICAN FLAG.\r\n\r\nThe formality of taking possession of the city yet remained to be done.\r\nTo that end, immediately after the signing of the agreement by the\r\ncommissioners, General Shafter notified General Toral that he would\r\nformally receive his surrender of the city the next day, Sunday, July\r\n17th, at nine o'clock in the morning. Accordingly at about 8.30 A.M.,\r\nSunday, General Shafter, accompanied by the commander of the American\r\narmy, General Nelson A. Miles, Generals Wheeler and Lawton, and several\r\nofficers, walked slowly down the hill to the road leading to Santiago.\r\nUnder the great mango tree which had witnessed all the negotiations,\r\nGeneral Toral, in full uniform, accompanied by 200 Spanish officers, met\r\nthe Americans. After a little ceremony in military manoeuvring, the\r\ntwo commanding generals faced each other, and General Toral, speaking in\r\nSpanish, said:\r\n\r\n\"Through fate I am forced to surrender to General Shafter, of the\r\nAmerican army, the city and the strongholds of the city of Santiago.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Toral's voice trembled with emotion as he spoke the words giving\r\nup the town to his victorious enemy. As he finished speaking the Spanish\r\nofficers presented arms.\r\n\r\nGeneral Shafter, in reply, said:\r\n\r\n\"I receive the city in the name of the government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Spanish general then wheeled about, presenting arms,\r\nand General Shafter, with the American officers, cavalry and infantry,\r\nchosen for the occasion, passed into the city and on to the governor's\r\npalace, where a crowd, numbering 3,000 persons, had gathered. As the\r\ngreat bell in the tower of the cathedral nearby gave the first stroke of\r\ntwelve o'clock the American flag was run up from the flag-pole on the\r\npalace, and as it floated to the breeze all hats were removed by the\r\nspectators, while the soldiers presented arms. As the cathedral bell\r\ntolled the last stroke of the hour the military band began to play \"The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner,\" which was followed by \"Three Cheers for the Red,\r\nWhite, and Blue.\" The cheering of the soldiers were joined by more than\r\nhalf of the people, who seemed greatly pleased and yelled \"Viva los\r\nAmericanos.\" The soldiers along almost the whole of the American line\r\ncould see and had watched with alternating silence and cheers the entire\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH WHEELER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SHAFTER'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE VICTORY.\r\n\r\nHaving assigned soldiers to patrol and preserve order within the city,\r\nGeneral Shafter and his staff returned to their quarters at camp, and\r\nthe victorious commander, who two weeks before was almost disheartened,\r\nsent a dispatch announcing the formal surrender of Santiago. It was the\r\nfirst dispatch of the kind received at Washington from a foreign country\r\nfor more than fifty years. The following extract from General Shafter's\r\ntelegram sums up the situation:\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to announce that the American flag has been this\r\ninstant, 12 noon, hoisted over the house of the civil government in the\r\ncity of Santiago. An immense concourse of people was present, a squadron\r\nof cavalry and a regiment of infantry presenting arms, and a band\r\nplaying national airs. A light battery fired a salute of twenty-one\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect order is being maintained by the municipal government. The\r\ndistress is very great, but there is little sickness in town, and\r\nscarcely any yellow fever.\r\n\r\n\"A small gunboat and about 200 seamen left by Cervera have surrendered\r\nto me. Obstructions are being removed from the mouth of the harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Upon coming into the city I discovered a perfect entanglement of\r\ndefenses. Fighting as the Spaniards did the first day, it would have\r\ncost five thousand lives to have taken it.\r\n\r\n\"Battalions of Spanish troops have been depositing arms since daylight\r\nin the armory, over which I have a guard. General Toral formally\r\nsurrendered the plaza and all stores at 9 A.M. About 7,000 rifles,\r\n600,000 cartridges, and many fine modern guns were given up.\r\n\r\n\"This important victory, with its substantial fruits of conquest, was\r\nwon by a loss of 1,593 men killed, wounded, and missing. Lawton, who had\r\nthe severe fighting around El Caney, lost 410 men. Kent lost 859 men in\r\nthe still more severe assault on San Juan and the other conflicts of the\r\ncentre. The cavalry lost 285 men, many of whom fell at El Caney, and the\r\nfeint at Aguadores cost thirty-seven men. One man of the Signal Corps\r\nwas killed and one wounded. Trying as it is to bear the casualties of\r\nthe first fight, there can be no doubt that in a military sense our\r\nsuccess was not dearly won.\"\r\n\r\nThus within less than thirty days from the time Shafter's army landed\r\nupon Cuban soil he had received the surrender not only of the city of\r\nSantiago, but nearly the whole of the province of that name--or about\r\none-tenth of the entire island.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN PORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nIt was General Miles' original plan after establishing a blockade of\r\nCuban ports to open the war in Porto Rico, and make no general invasion\r\nof Cuba during the sickly season, but the enclosure of Cervera's fleet\r\nin the harbor of Santiago changed the conditions and made it necessary\r\nto move a military force to that point before going elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNow that Santiago had surrendered, according to the original plan of\r\nGeneral Miles, the attention of the army and navy was again turned to\r\nPorto Rico, and the work of fitting out expeditions to that island was\r\nbegun at once. There were three expeditions sent. The first under\r\nGeneral Miles sailed from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, July 21st; the second\r\nunder General Ernst on the same day sailed from Charleston, S.C.; the\r\nthird under General Brooke embarked at Newport News on July 26th. All of\r\nthese expeditions, aggregating about 11,000 men, were convoyed by\r\nwar-ships, and successfully landed. The first, under General Miles,\r\nreached Guanica at daylight on July 25th, where a Spanish force\r\nattempted to resist their landing, but a few well-directed shells from\r\nthe _Massachusetts_, _Gloucester_, and _Columbia_ soon put the enemy to\r\nflight. A party then went ashore and pulled down the Spanish flag from\r\nthe blockhouse--the first trophy of war from Porto Rican soil. As the\r\ntroops began to land the Spaniards opened fire upon them. The Americans\r\nreplied with their rifles and machine guns, and the ships also shelled\r\nthe enemy from the harbor. Five dead Spaniards were found after the\r\nfiring had ceased. Not an American was touched.\r\n\r\nBefore nightfall all the troops were landed. The next day General Miles\r\nmarched toward Ponce. Four men were wounded in a skirmish at Yauco on\r\nthe way, but at Ponce, where General Ernst's expedition from Charleston\r\nmet them and disembarked on July 28th, the Spaniards fled on the\r\napproach of the Americans, whom the mayor of the city and the people\r\nwelcomed with joy, making many demonstrations in their honor and\r\noffering their services to hunt and fight the Spaniards. General Miles\r\nissued a proclamation to the people declaring clearly the United States'\r\npurpose of annexing them. The mayor of Ponce published this\r\nproclamation, with an appeal from himself to the people to salute and\r\nhail the American flag as their own, and to welcome and aid the American\r\nsoldiers as their deliverers and brothers.\r\n\r\nOn August 4th General Brooke arrived, and the fleet commander, Captain\r\nHigginson, with little resistance opened the port of Arroyo, where they\r\nwere successfully landed the next day, and General Haines' brigade\r\ncaptured the place with a few prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were then in possession of all the principal ports on the\r\nsouth coast, covering between fifty and sixty miles of that shore. A\r\nforward movement was inaugurated in three divisions--all of which we\r\nwill consider together--the object of General Miles being to occupy the\r\nisland and drive the Spanish forces before him into San Juan, and by the\r\naid of the fleet capture them there in a body, though the Spanish forces\r\nnumbered 8,000 regulars and 9,000 volunteers, against which were the\r\n11,000 land forces of the Americans and also their fleet.\r\n\r\nThe town of Coamo was captured August 9th after half an hour of fighting\r\nby Generals Ernst and Wilson, the Americans driving the Spaniards from\r\ntheir trenches, and sustaining a loss of six wounded. On the 10th\r\nGeneral Schwan encountered 1,000 Spaniards at Rosario River. This was\r\nthe most severe engagement in Porto Rico. The Spaniards were routed,\r\nwith what loss is unknown. The Americans had two killed and sixteen\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th General Wilson moved on to Abonito and found the enemy\r\nstrongly intrenched in the mountain fastnesses along the road. He\r\nventured an attack with artillery, sustaining a loss of one man killed\r\nand four wounded. On pain of another attack he sent a messenger\r\ndemanding the surrender of the town of Abonito; but the soldierly answer\r\nwas sent back: \"Tell General Wilson to stay where he is if he wishes to\r\navoid the shedding of much blood.\" General Wilson concluded to delay\r\nuntil General Brooke could come up before making the assault, and, while\r\nthus waiting, the news of peace arrived.\r\n\r\nMeantime General Brooke had been operating around Guayama, where he had\r\nfive men wounded. At three o'clock, August 12th, the battle was just\r\nopening in good order, and a great fight was anticipated. The gunners\r\nwere sighting their first pieces when one of the signal corps galloped\r\nup with the telegram announcing _peace_. \"You came just fifteen minutes\r\ntoo soon. The troops will be disappointed,\" said General Brooke, and\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nSo ended the well-planned campaign of Porto Rico, in which General Miles\r\nhad arranged, by a masterly operation with 11,000 men, the occupation of\r\nan island 108 miles long by thirty-seven broad. As it was, he had\r\nalready occupied about one-third of the island with a loss of only three\r\nkilled and twenty-eight wounded, against a preponderating force of\r\n17,000 Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of the protocol of peace General Brooke was left in\r\ncharge of about half the forces in Porto Rico, pending a final peace,\r\nwhile General Miles with the other half returned to the United States,\r\nwhere he arrived early in September and was received with fitting\r\novations in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, at which latter city\r\nhe again took up his quarters as the Commander of the American Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nAfter Dewey's victory at Manila, already referred to, it became evident\r\nthat he must have the co-operation of an army in capturing and\r\ncontrolling the city. The insurgents under General Aguinaldo appeared\r\nanxious to assist Admiral Dewey, but it was feared that he could not\r\ncontrol them. Accordingly, the big monitor _Monterey_ was started for\r\nManila and orders were given for the immediate outfitting of expeditions\r\nfrom San Francisco under command of Major-General Wesley Merritt. The\r\nfirst expedition consisted of between 2,500 and 3,000 troops, commanded\r\nby Brigadier-General Anderson, carried on three ships, the _Charleston_,\r\nthe _City of Pekin_, and the _City of Sydney_. This was the longest\r\nexpedition (about 6,000 miles) on which American troops were ever sent,\r\nand the men carried supplies to last a year. The _Charleston_ got away\r\non the 22d, and the other two vessels followed three days later. The\r\nexpedition went through safely, arriving at Manila July 1st. The\r\n_Charleston_ had stopped on June 21st at the Ladrone Islands and\r\ncaptured the island of Guam without resistance. The soldiers of the\r\ngarrison were taken on as prisoners to Manila and a garrison of American\r\nsoldiers left in charge, with the stars and stripes waving over the\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE WAR ROOM AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe above illustration shows President McKinley, Secretary Long,\r\nSecretary Alger, and Major-General Miles consulting map during the\r\nprogress of the Spanish-American War. It is in this room that the plans\r\nof conducting the war by land and sea, are formulated, and the commands\r\nfor action are wired to the fleet and the army.]\r\n\r\nThe second expedition of 3,500 men sailed June 15th under General\r\nGreene, who used the steamer _China_ as his flagship. This expedition\r\nlanded July 16th at Cavite in the midst of considerable excitement on\r\naccount of the aggressive movements of the insurgents and the daily\r\nencounters and skirmishes between them and the Spanish forces.\r\n\r\nOn June 23d the monitor _Monadnoc_ sailed to further reinforce Admiral\r\nDewey, and four days later the third expedition of 4,000 troops under\r\nGeneral McArthur passed out of the Golden Gate amid the cheers of the\r\nmultitude, as the others had done; and on the 29th General Merritt\r\nfollowed on the _Newport_. Nearly one month later, July 23d, General\r\nH.G. Otis, with 900 men, sailed on the _City of Rio de Janeiro_ from San\r\nFrancisco, thus making a total of nearly 12,000 men, all told, sent to\r\nthe Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nGeneral Merritt arrived at Cavite July 25th, and on July 29th the\r\nAmerican forces advanced from Cavite toward Manila. On the 31st, while\r\nenroute, they were attacked at Malate by 3,000 Spaniards, whom they\r\nrepulsed, but sustained a loss of nine men killed and forty-seven\r\nwounded, nine of them seriously. This was the first loss of life on the\r\npart of the Americans in action in the Philippines. The Spanish\r\ncasualties were much heavier. On the same day General McArthur's\r\nreinforcements arrived at Cavite, and several days were devoted to\r\npreparations for a combined land and naval attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL WESLEY MERRITT.]\r\n\r\nOn August 7th Admiral Dewey and General Merritt demanded the surrender\r\nof the city within forty-eight hours, and foreign war-ships took their\r\nrespective subjects on board for protection. On August 9th the\r\nSpaniards asked more time to hear from Madrid, but this was refused,\r\nand on the 13th a final demand was made for immediate surrender, which\r\nGovernor-General Augusti refused and embarked with his family on board a\r\nGerman man-of-war, which sailed with him for Hong Kong. At 9.30 o'clock\r\nthe bombardment began with fury, all of the vessels sending hot shot at\r\nthe doomed city.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the bombardment by the fleet American soldiers under\r\nGenerals McArthur and Greene were ordered to storm the Spanish trenches\r\nwhich extended ten miles around the city. The soldiers rose cheering and\r\ndashed for the Spanish earthworks. A deadly fire met them, but the men\r\nrushed on and swept the enemy from their outer defenses, forcing them to\r\ntheir inner trenches. A second charge was made upon these, and the\r\nSpaniards retreated into the walled city, where they promptly sent up a\r\nwhite flag. The ships at once ceased firing, and the victorious\r\nAmericans entered the city after six hours' fighting. General Merritt\r\ntook command as military governor. The Spanish forces numbered 7,000 and\r\nthe Americans 10,000 men. The loss to the Americans was about fifty\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing, which was very small under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the insurgents had formed a government with Aguinaldo as\r\npresident. They declared themselves most friendly to American occupation\r\nof the islands, with a view to aiding them to establish an independent\r\ngovernment, which they hoped would be granted to them. On September 15th\r\nthey opened their republican congress at Malolos, and President\r\nAguinaldo made the opening address, expressing warm appreciation of\r\nAmericans and indulging the hope that they meant to establish the\r\nindependence of the islands. On September 16th, however, in obedience to\r\nthe command of General Otis, they withdrew their forces from the\r\nvicinity of Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE PROTOCOL.\r\n\r\nPrecisely how to open the negotiations for peace was a delicate and\r\ndifficult question. Its solution, however, proved easy enough when the\r\nattempt was made. During the latter part of July the Spanish government,\r\nthrough M. Jules Cambon, the French ambassador at Washington, submitted\r\na note, asking the United States government for a statement of the\r\nground on which it would be willing to cease hostilities and arrange for\r\na peaceable settlement. Accordingly, on July 30th, a statement,\r\nembodying President McKinley's views, was transmitted to Spain, and on\r\nAugust 2d Spain virtually accepted the terms by cable. On August 9th\r\nSpain's formal reply was presented by M. Cambon, and on the next day he\r\nand Secretary Day agreed upon terms of a protocol, to be sent to Spain\r\nfor her approval. Two days later, the 12th inst., the French ambassador\r\nwas authorized to sign the protocol for Spain, and the signatures were\r\naffixed the same afternoon at the White House (M. Cambon signing for\r\nSpain and Secretary Day for the United States), in the presence of\r\nPresident McKinley and the chief assistants of the Department of State.\r\nThe six main points covered by the protocol were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. That Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title\r\nto Cuba.\r\n\r\n\"2. That Porto Rico and other Spanish islands in the West Indies, and an\r\nisland in the Ladrones, to be selected by the United States, shall be\r\nceded to the latter.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and\r\nharbor of Manila, pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which\r\nshall determine the control, disposition, and government of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n\"4. That Cuba, Porto Rico, and other Spanish islands in the West Indies\r\nshall be immediately evacuated, and that commissioners, to be appointed\r\nwithin ten days, shall, within thirty days from the signing of the\r\nprotocol, meet at Havana and San Juan, respectively, to arrange and\r\nexecute the details of the evacuation.\r\n\r\n\"5. That the United States and Spain will each appoint not more than\r\nfive commissioners to negotiate and conclude a treaty of peace. The\r\ncommissioners are to meet at Paris not later than October 1st.\r\n\r\n\"6. On the signing of the protocol, hostilities will be suspended and\r\nnotice to that effect be given as soon as possible by each government to\r\nthe commanders of its military and naval forces.\"\r\n\r\nOn the very same afternoon President McKinley issued a proclamation\r\nannouncing on the part of the United States a suspension of hostilities,\r\nand over the wires the word went ringing throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the land and under the ocean that peace was restored. The\r\ncable from Hong Kong to Manila, however, had not been repaired for use\r\nsince Dewey had cut it in May; consequently it was several days before\r\ntidings could reach General Merritt and Admiral Dewey; and meantime the\r\nbattle of Manila, which occurred on the 13th, was fought.\r\n\r\nOn August 17th President McKinley named commissioners to adjust the\r\nSpanish evacuation of Cuba and Porto Rico, in accordance with the terms\r\nof the protocol. Rear-Admiral Wm. T. Sampson, Senator Matthew C. Butler,\r\nand Major-General James F. Wade were appointed for Cuba, and\r\nRear-Admiral W.S. Schley, Brigadier-General Wm. W. Gordon, and\r\nMajor-General John R. Brooke for Porto Rico. In due time Spain announced\r\nher commissioners, and, as agreed, they met in September and the\r\narrangements for evacuation were speedily completed and carried out.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley appointed as the National Peace Commission,\r\nSecretary of State Wm. R. Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis of Minnesota,\r\nSenator Wm. P. Frye of Maine, Senator George Gray of Delaware, and Mr.\r\nWhitelaw Reid of New York. Secretary Day resigned his State portfolio\r\nSeptember 16th, in which he was succeeded by Colonel John Hay, former\r\nAmbassador to England. With ex-Secretary Day at their head the Americans\r\nsailed from New York, September 17th, met the Spanish Commissioners at\r\nParis, France, as agreed, and arranged the details of the final peace\r\nbetween the two nations. Thus ended the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME-COMING OF OUR SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\nAfter Spain's virtual acceptance of the terms of peace contained in\r\nPresident McKinley's note of July 30th, it was deemed unnecessary to\r\nkeep all the forces unoccupied in the fever districts of Cuba and the\r\nunsanitary camps of our own country; consequently the next day after\r\nreceipts of Spain's message of August 2d, on August 3d, the home-coming\r\nwas inaugurated by ordering all cavalry under General Shafter at\r\nSantiago to be transported to Montauk Point, Long Island, and on the 6th\r\ninstant transports sailed bearing those who were to come north. These\r\nwere followed rapidly by others from Santiago, and later by about half\r\nthe forces from Porto Rico under General Miles, and others from the\r\nvarious camps, so that by the end of September, 1898, nearly half of the\r\ngreat army of 268,000 men had been mustered out of service or sent home\r\non furlough.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of universal regret that so many of our brave volunteers\r\ndied of neglect in camps and on transports, and that fever, malaria, and\r\nexposure carried several times the number to their graves as were sent\r\nthere by Spanish bullets. Severe criticisms have been lodged against the\r\nWar Department for both lack of efficiency and neglect in caring for the\r\ncomfort, health, and life of those who went forward at their country's\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be remembered that the War Department undertook and\r\naccomplished a herculean task, and it could not be expected, starting\r\nwith a regular force of less than 30,000 men, that an army of a quarter\r\nof a million could be built up out of volunteers who had to be\r\ncollected, trained, clothed, equipped, and provisioned, and a war waged\r\nand won on two sides of the globe, in a little over three months,\r\nwithout much suffering and many mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nDecember 10, 1898, was one of the most eventful days in the past\r\ndecade--one fraught with great interest to the world, and involving the\r\ndestiny of more than 10,000,000 of people. At nine o'clock on the\r\nevening of that day the commissioners of the United States and those of\r\nSpain met for the last time, after about eleven weeks of\r\ndeliberation, in the magnificent apartments of the foreign ministry at\r\nthe French capital, and signed the Treaty of Peace, which finally marked\r\nthe end of the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES PEACE COMMISSIONERS OF THE SPANISH WAR\r\n\r\nAppointed September 9, 1898. Met Spanish Commissioners at Paris, October\r\n1st. Treaty of Peace signed by the Commissioners at Paris, December\r\n10th. Ratified by the United States Senate at Washington, February 6,\r\n1899.]\r\n\r\nThis treaty transformed the political geography of the world by\r\nestablishing the United States' authority in both hemispheres, and also\r\nin the tropics, where it had never before extended. It, furthermore,\r\nbrought under our dominion and obligated us for the government of\r\nstrange and widely isolated peoples, who have little or no knowledge of\r\nliberty and government as measured by the American standards. In this\r\nnew assumption of responsibility America essayed a difficult problem,\r\nthe solving of which involved results that could not fail to influence\r\nthe destiny of our nation and the future history of the whole world.\r\n\r\nOn January 3, 1899, the Hon. John Hay, Secretary of State, delivered the\r\nTreaty of Peace to President McKinley, who, on January 4th, forwarded\r\nthe same to the Senate of the United States with a view to its\r\nratification.

Stands\r\n   of colors, uncaptured war-vessels, small arms, guns of all calibers,\r\n   with their carriages and accessories, powder, ammunition, live stock,\r\n   and materials and supplies of all kinds belonging to the land and\r\n   naval forces of Spain in the Philippines and Guam, remain the\r\n   property of Spain. Pieces of heavy  ordnance, exclusive of field\r\n   artillery, in the fortifications and coast defenses shall remain in\r\n   their emplacements for the term of six months, to be reckoned from\r\n   the exchange of ratifications of the treaty; and the United States\r\n   may, in the meantime, purchase such material from Spain if a\r\n   satisfactory agreement between the two Governments on the subject\r\n   shall be reached.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE VI.--Spain will, upon the signature of the present treaty,\r\n   release prisoners of war and all persons detained or imprisoned for\r\n   political offenses in connection with the insurrections in Cuba and\r\n   the Philippines and the war with the United States.\r\n\r\n   Reciprocally, the United States will release all persons made\r\n   prisoners of war by the American forces and will undertake to obtain\r\n   the release of all Spanish prisoners in the hands of the insurgents\r\n   in Cuba and the Philippines.\r\n\r\n   The Government of the United States will at its own cost return to\r\n   Spain and the Government of Spain will at its own cost return to the\r\n   United States, Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, according to\r\n   the situation of their respective homes, prisoners released or caused\r\n   to be released by them, respectively, under this article.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE VII.--The United States and Spain mutually relinquish all\r\n   claims for indemnity, national and individual, of every kind, of\r\n   either Government or of its citizens or subjects, against the other\r\n   Government that may have arisen since the beginning of the late\r\n   insurrection in Cuba, and prior to the exchange of ratifications of\r\n   the present treaty, including all claims for indemnity for the cost\r\n   of the war.\r\n\r\n   The United States will adjudicate and settle the claims of its\r\n   citizens against Spain relinquished in this article.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE VIII.--In conformity with the provisions of Articles I, II,\r\n   and III of this treaty, Spain relinquishes in Cuba and cedes in Porto\r\n   Rico and other islands in the West Indies, in the island of Guam and\r\n   in the Philippine archipelago, all the buildings, wharves, barracks,\r\n   forts, structures, public highways, and other immovable property,\r\n   which, in conformity with law, belong to the public domain, and as\r\n   such belong to the Crown of Spain.\r\n\r\n   And it is hereby declared that the relinquishment or cession, as the\r\n   case may be, to which the preceding paragraph refers, cannot in any\r\n   respect impair the property or rights which by law belong to the\r\n   peaceful possession of property of all kinds, of provinces,\r\n   municipalities, public or private establishments, ecclesiastical or\r\n   civic bodies, or any other associations having legal capacity to\r\n   acquire and possess property in the aforesaid territories renounced\r\n   or ceded, or of private individuals, of whatsoever nationality such\r\n   individuals may be.\r\n\r\n   The aforesaid relinquishment or cession, as the case may be, includes\r\n   all documents exclusively referring to the sovereignty relinquished\r\n   or ceded that may exist in the archives of the Peninsula.

Such\r\n   archives and records shall be carefully preserved, and private\r\n   persons shall, without distinction, have the right to require in\r\n   accordance with law authenticated copies of the contracts, wills, and\r\n   other instruments forming part of notarial protocols or files, or\r\n   which may be contained in the executive or judicial archives, be the\r\n   latter in Spain or in the islands aforesaid.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE IX.--Spanish subjects, natives of the peninsula, residing in\r\n   the territory over which Spain by the present treaty relinquishes or\r\n   cedes her sovereignty, may remain in such territory or may remove\r\n   therefrom, retaining in either event all their rights of property,\r\n   including the right to sell or dispose of such property or of its\r\n   proceeds, and they shall also have the right to carry on their\r\n   industry, commerce, and professions, being subject in respect thereof\r\n   to such laws as are applicable to other foreigners. In case they\r\n   remain in the territory they may preserve their allegiance to the\r\n   Crown of Spain by making before a court of record, within a year from\r\n   the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty, a\r\n   declaration of their decision to preserve such allegiance, in default\r\n   of which declaration they shall be held to have renounced it and to\r\n   have adopted the nationality of the territory in which they may\r\n   reside.\r\n\r\n   The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of\r\n   the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined\r\n   by the Congress.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE X.--The inhabitants of the territories over which Spain\r\n   relinquishes or cedes her sovereignty shall be secure in the free\r\n   exercise of their religion.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XI.--The Spaniards residing in the territories over which\r\n   Spain by this treaty cedes or relinquishes her sovereignty shall be\r\n   subject in matters civil as well as criminal to the jurisdiction of\r\n   the courts of the country wherein they reside, pursuant to the\r\n   ordinary laws governing the same; and they shall have the right to\r\n   appear before such courts and to pursue the same course as citizens\r\n   of the country to which the courts belong.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XII.--Judicial proceedings pending at the time of the\r\n   exchange of ratifications of this treaty in the territories over\r\n   which Spain relinquishes or cedes her sovereignty shall be determined\r\n   according to the following rules:\r\n\r\n   1. Judgments rendered either in civil suits between private\r\n   individuals or in criminal matters before the date mentioned and with\r\n   respect to which there is no recourse or right of revenue under the\r\n   Spanish law shall be deemed to be final, and shall be executed in due\r\n   form by competent authority in the territory within which such\r\n   judgments should be carried out.\r\n\r\n   2. Civil suits between private individuals which may on the date\r\n   mentioned be undetermined shall be prosecuted to judgment before the\r\n   court in which they may then be pending or in the court that may be\r\n   substituted therefor.\r\n\r\n   3. Criminal actions pending on the date mentioned before the Supreme\r\n   Court of Spain against citizens of the territory which by this treaty\r\n   ceases to be Spanish shall continue under its jurisdiction until\r\n   final judgment; but such judgment having been rendered, the execution\r\n   thereof shall be committed to the competent authority of the place in\r\n   which the case arose.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XIII.--The rights of property secured by copyrights and\r\n   patents acquired by Spaniards in the Island de Cuba, and in Porto\r\n   Rico, the Philippines, and other ceded territories, at the time of\r\n   the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, shall continue to\r\n   be respected. Spanish scientific, literary, and artistic works not\r\n   subversive of public order in the territories in question shall\r\n   continue to be admitted free of duty into such territories for the\r\n   period of ten years, to be reckoned from the days of the exchange of\r\n   the ratifications of this treaty.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XIV.--Spain will have the power to establish consular offices\r\n   in the ports and places of the territories the sovereignty over which\r\n   has been either relinquished or ceded by the present treaty.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XV.--The Government of each country will, for the term of ten\r\n   years, accord to the merchant vessels of the other country the same\r\n   treatment in respect of all port charges, including entrance and\r\n   clearance dues, light dues and tonnage duties, as it accords to its\r\n   own merchant vessels not engaged in the coastwise trade.\r\n\r\n   This article may at any time be terminated on six months' notice\r\n   given by either Government to the other.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XVI.--It is understood that any obligations assumed in this\r\n   treaty by the United States with respect to Cuba are limited to the\r\n   time of its occupancy thereof; but it will, upon the termination of\r\n   such occupancy, advise any government established in the island to\r\n   assume the same obligations.\r\n\r\n   ARTICLE XVII.--The present treaty shall be ratified by the President\r\n   of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\n   Senate thereof, and by Her Majesty, the Queen Regent of Spain, and\r\n   the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington within six months\r\n   from the date hereof, or earlier, if possible.\r\n\r\n   In faith whereof, we, the respective Plenipotentiaries, have signed\r\n   this treaty and have hereunto affixed our seals.\r\n\r\n   Done in duplicate, at Paris, the tenth day of December, in the year\r\n   of our Lord one thousand eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM R. DAY,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM P. FRYE,\r\n\r\nWHITELAW REID,\r\n\r\nB. DE ABARZUZA,\r\n\r\nW.R. DE VILLA URRUTIA,\r\n\r\nCUSHMAN K. DAVIS,\r\n\r\nGEORGE GRAY,\r\n\r\nEUGENIO M. RIOS,\r\n\r\nJ. DE GARNICA,\r\n\r\nRAFAEL CERERO.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Regent of Spain signed the ratification of the Treaty of Peace\r\non March 17, 1899, and the final act took place on the afternoon of\r\nApril 11th, when copies of the final protocol were exchanged at\r\nWashington by President McKinley and the French ambassador, M. Cambon,\r\nrepresenting Spain. The President immediately issued a proclamation of\r\npeace, and thus the Spanish-American War came to an official end. A few\r\nweeks later the sum of $20,000,000 was paid to Spain, in accordance with\r\nthe treaty, as partial compensation for the surrender of her rights in\r\nthe Philippines, and diplomatic relations between the Latin kingdom and\r\nthe United States were resumed.\r\n\r\nThe territory which passes under the control of our government by the\r\nabove treaty of peace has a combined area of about 168,000 square miles,\r\nequal to nine good States. It all lies within the tropics, where\r\nhitherto not an acre of our country has extended; and, for that reason,\r\nits acquisition is of the greatest commercial significance. These\r\nislands produce all tropical fruits, plants, spices, timbers, etc. Their\r\ncombined population is upwards of 10,000,000 people, and among this vast\r\nnumber there are few manufactories of any kind. They are consumers or\r\nprospective consumers of all manufactured goods; they require the\r\nproducts of the temperate zone, and in return everything they produce is\r\nmarketable in our country.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish forces withdrew from Cuba, December 31, 1898, and, on the\r\nfollowing day, the Stars and Stripes was hoisted over Havana. The\r\nchange of sovereignties in Porto Rico took place without trouble, but\r\nthere has been some disturbance in Cuba, and it is evident that\r\nconsiderable time must elapse before peace will be fully restored and a\r\nstable government established in the island.\r\n\r\nThough the war with Spain was closed, serious trouble broke out in the\r\nPhilippines. Aguinaldo, who had headed most of the rebellions against\r\nSpain during the later years, refused to acknowledge the authority of\r\nthe United States, and, rallying thousands of Filipinos around him, set\r\non foot what he claimed was a war of independence. Our government sent a\r\nstrong force of regulars and volunteers thither, all of whom acquitted\r\nthemselves with splendid heroism and bravery, and defeated the rebels\r\nrepeatedly, capturing strongholds one after the other, and, in fact,\r\ndriving everything resistlessly before them. The fighting was of the\r\nsharpest kind, and our troops had many killed and wounded, though that\r\nof the enemy was tenfold greater. All such struggles, however, when\r\nAmerican valor and skill are arrayed on one side, can have but one\r\nresult; and, animated by our sense of duty, which demanded that a firm,\r\nequitable, and just government should be established in the Philippines,\r\nthis beneficent purpose was certain to be attained in the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL ELWELL S. OTIS]\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 1899, President McKinley nominated Rear-Admiral George Dewey\r\nto the rank of full admiral, his commission to date from March 2d, and\r\nthe Senate immediately and unanimously confirmed the nomination, which\r\nhad been so richly earned. This hero, as modest as he is great, remained\r\nin the Philippines to complete his herculean task, instead of seizing\r\nthe first opportunity to return home and receive the overwhelming honors\r\nwhich his countrymen were eagerly waiting to show him. Finally, when his\r\nvast work was virtually completed and his health showed evidence of the\r\nterrific and long-continued strain to which it had been subjected, he\r\nturned over his command, by direction of the government, to Rear-Admiral\r\nWatson, and, proceeding by a leisurely course, reached home in the\r\nautumn of 1899. The honors showered upon him by his grateful and\r\nadmiring countrymen proved not only his clear title to the foremost rank\r\namong the greatest naval heroes of ancient and modern times, but\r\nattested the truth that the United States is not ungrateful, and that\r\nthere is no reward too exalted for her to bestow upon those who have\r\nworthily won it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL DEWEY'S FLAGSHIP THE \"OLYMPIA.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEN.

It practically sounded the death-knell of the conservative\r\ndoctrine of non-expansion beyond our own natural physical boundaries.\r\nThe only precedent approaching this act, in our history, is the\r\nannexation of Texas. The Louisiana Territory, Florida, and Alaska were\r\nacquired by purchase; California, New Mexico, and a part of Colorado\r\nwere obtained by cession from Mexico; Oregon, Washington, Montana, and\r\nIdaho by treaty with Great Britain. Texas alone was annexed. The fact,\r\nhowever, that it was a republic is the only circumstance which makes its\r\ncase analogous to that of Hawaii. Texas lay between two large nations,\r\nand was obliged to seek union with one of them. It was within our own\r\ncontinent and inhabited largely by our own people. Hawaii marks our\r\nfirst advance into foreign lands, and ranges America for the first time\r\namong the nations whose policy is that of expansion, by territorial\r\nextensions, over the globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE GRASS HOUSE, HAWAII.]\r\n\r\nHawaii is called the \"Paradise of the Pacific,\" and there is little\r\ndoubt that its climate, fertility and healthfulness justify the name.\r\nIt is one of the few spots upon earth where one can almost, to use a\r\nslang phrase, \"touch the button\" and obtain any kind of weather he\r\ndesires. Mark Twain's suggestion to those who go to these islands to\r\nfind a congenial clime is about as practical as it is humorous--\"Select\r\nyour climate, mark your thermometer at the temperature desired, and\r\nclimb until the mercury stops there.\" Everyone who visits Hawaii is\r\ncharmed with the country, and never forgets its novelty, stupendous and\r\ndelightful scenery, clear atmosphere, gorgeous sunlight, and profusion\r\nof fruits and flowers.\r\n\r\n\"No alien land in all the world,\" writes Mr. Clemens, \"could so\r\nlongingly and beseechingly haunt me, sleeping and waking, through half a\r\nlife-time, as that has done. Other things leave me, but that abides.\r\nOther things change, but that remains the same. For me its balmy airs\r\nare always blowing; its summer seas flash in the sun; the pulsing of its\r\nsurf beats in my ear; I can see its garlanded crags, its leaping\r\ncascades, its plumy palms drowsing by the shore, its remote summits\r\nfloating like islands above the cloud rack; I can feel the spirit of its\r\nwoodland solitudes; I can hear the splash of its brooks; in my nostrils\r\nstill lives the breath of flowers that perished twenty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY AND LOCATION.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook discovered the islands in January, 1778, and named them the\r\nSandwich Islands, after Lord Sandwich; but the native name, Hawaii, is\r\nmore generally used. There is good evidence that Juan Gaetano, in the\r\nyear 1555--223 years before Cook's visit--landed upon their shores. Old\r\nSpanish charts and the traditions of the natives bear out this theory,\r\nbut they were not made known to the world until Cook visited them. It is\r\npopularly believed that the original inhabitants of Hawaii came from New\r\nZealand, though that island is some 4,000 miles southwest of them. The\r\nphysical appearance of the people is very similar, and their languages\r\nare so much alike that a native Hawaiian and a native New Zealander,\r\nmeeting for the first time, can carry on a conversation. Their ideas of\r\nthe Deity and some of their religious customs are nearly the same. That\r\nthe islands have been peopled for a long time is proven by the fact that\r\nhuman bones are found under lava beds and coral reefs where geologists\r\ndeclare they have lain for at least thirteen hundred years.\r\n\r\nThere are eight inhabited islands in the archipelago, Hawaii, Maui,\r\nKahoolawi, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau, comprising an area\r\nof 6,700 square miles, a little less than that of the State of New\r\nJersey, and about five hundred miles greater than the combined areas of\r\nRhode Island and Connecticut. They extend from northwest to southeast,\r\nover a distance of about 380 miles, the several islands being separated\r\nby channels varying in width from six to sixty miles. They lie entirely\r\nwithin the tropics, not far from a direct line between San Francisco and\r\nJapan, 2,080 miles from San Francisco, which is nearer to them than any\r\nother point of land, except one of the Carolines. The largest and most\r\nsouthern island is Hawaii, which has given its name to the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISING THE AMERICAN FLAG IN HONOLULU, AUGUST 12, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe cut in the corner shows the Royal Palace formerly occupied by the\r\nHawaiian Kings.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHEST AND LARGEST VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nThe entire archipelago is of volcanic origin, but there are no active\r\ncraters to be found at the present time, except two, on the island of\r\nHawaii. Mauna Loa is the highest volcano in the world, being nearly\r\n14,000 feet above the sea. It has an immense crater; but, while it still\r\nsends forth smoke and has a lake of molten lava at the bottom, there\r\nhave been no eruptions for a number of years. Kilauea, the largest\r\nactive volcano on the globe, is about sixteen miles from Mauna Loa, on\r\none of its foothills, 4,000 feet above the sea, and is in a constant\r\nstate of activity. Its last great eruption occurred in 1894. This\r\nvolcano was described by the missionary Ellis in the year 1823, and\r\nhundreds of tourists visit it every year. Its crater is nine miles in\r\ncircumference and several hundred feet deep. Under the conduct of\r\ncompetent guides the tourists descend into the crater and walk over the\r\ncool lava in places, while near them the hot flame and molten lava are\r\nspouting to the height of hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\nThe largest extinct volcano in the archipelago is on the island of Maui,\r\nthe bottom of the crater measuring sixteen square miles. All of these\r\nstupendous volcanic mountains rise so gently on the western side that\r\nhorsemen easily ride to their summits.\r\n\r\n\r\nINHABITANTS OF THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nWhen Cook visited Hawaii, he found the islands inhabited, according to\r\nhis estimate, by 400,000 natives. Forty years later when the census was\r\ntaken there were 142,000. These diminished one-half during the next\r\nfifty years, and the native population of the islands in 1897 was only\r\n31,019. The total population by the last census, when the islands became\r\na part of the United States, was 109,020, made up, in addition to the\r\nnatives mentioned, of 24,407 Japanese, 21,616 Chinese, 12,191\r\nPortuguese, and 3,086 Americans. The remainder were half-castes from\r\nforeign intermarriage with the natives, together with a small\r\nrepresentation from England, Germany, and other European countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HULA DANCING GIRLS, HAWAII.]\r\n\r\nThat the original Hawaiians must soon become extinct as a pure race is\r\nevident, though they have never been persecuted or maltreated. They are\r\na handsome, strong-looking people, with a rich dark complexion, jet\r\nblack eyes, wavy hair, full voluptuous lips, and teeth of snowy\r\nwhiteness; but they are constitutionally weak, easily contract and\r\nquickly succumb to disease, and the only hope of perpetuating their\r\nblood seems to lie in mixing it by intermarriage with other races.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TIMES IN HAWAII.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1795, all the islands had separate kings, but in that and the\r\nfollowing year the great king of Hawaii, Kamehameha, with cannon that he\r\nprocured from Vancouver's ships, assaulted and subjugated all the\r\nsurrounding kings, and since that time the islands have been under one\r\ngovernment. Previous to this, the natives had been at war, according to\r\ntheir traditions, for three hundred years. The fierceness of their\r\nhand-to-hand conflicts, as described by their historians, has probably\r\nnot been surpassed by those of any other people in the world. The four\r\ndescendants of Kamehameha reigned until 1872, when the last of his line\r\ndied childless. A new king was elected, who died within a year, and\r\nanother was then elected by the people. It was to this last line that\r\nQueen Liliuokalani belonged, and she was deposed by the revolution of\r\n1893, led by the American and European residents upon the islands. These\r\npatriots set up a provisional government and made repeated application\r\nfor admission to the United States, the tender of the islands being\r\nfinally accepted by a joint vote of Congress on July 7, 1898, since\r\nwhich time the Hawaiian Islands have been a part of our country.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs of the native Hawaiians are most interesting,\r\nbut space forbids a description of them here. Their religion was a gross\r\nform of idolatry, with many gods. Human sacrifice was freely practiced.\r\nThey deified dead chiefs and worshiped their bones. The great king,\r\nKamehameha I., though an idolater, was a most progressive monarch, and\r\ninvited Vancouver, who went there in 1794, taking swine, cattle, sheep,\r\nand horses, together with oranges and other valuable plants, to bring\r\nover teachers and missionaries to teach his people \"the white man's\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF AMERICAN MISSIONARIES.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until 1820, after the death of the great king, that the\r\nfirst missionaries arrived, and they came from America. The year\r\nprevious, in 1819, Kamehameha II. had destroyed many of the temples and\r\nidols and forbidden idol worship in the islands; consequently, when the\r\nmissionaries arrived they beheld the unprecedented spectacle of a nation\r\nwithout a religion. The natives were rapidly converted to Christianity.\r\nIt was these American missionaries who first reduced the Hawaiian\r\nlanguage to writing, established schools and taught the natives. As a\r\nresult of their work, the Hawaiians are the most generally educated\r\npeople, in the elementary sense, in the world. There is hardly a person\r\nin the islands, above the age of eight years, who cannot read and write.\r\nIn spite of education, however, many of the ancient superstitions still\r\nexist, and some of the old stone temples are yet standing. What the\r\nUnited States will do with these heathen temples remains to be seen. The\r\nnatives revere them as relics of their savage history, and as such they\r\nmay be preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH IN HONOLULU, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nBuilt of lava stone. Seating capacity about 3000.]\r\n\r\nAside from the horrors of superstitions, the Hawaiians lead a happy\r\nlife, full of amusements of various kinds on the land and water--for\r\nHawaiian men, women and children live much of their time in the water.\r\nInfants are often taught the art of swimming before they can walk. The\r\nsurf riding or swimming of the natives astonished Captain Cook more than\r\nany of their remarkable performances. The time selected was when a storm\r\nwas tossing the waves high and the surf was furious. Then the men and\r\nwomen would dive through the surf, with narrow boards about nine inches\r\nwide and eight feet long, and, swimming a mile or more out to sea, mount\r\non the crest of a huge billow, and sitting, kneeling or standing, with\r\nwild gesticulations, ride over the waves and breakers like gods or\r\ndemons of the storm. This practice has now ceased to be indulged in. But\r\nthe swimming of the Kanaka boys, who flock around incoming steamers, and\r\ndive after and catch coins which tourists throw into the water, like so\r\nmany ducks diving after corn, shows what a degree of perfection the\r\nnatatorial art has attained among the native Hawaiians. Sledging down\r\nthe mountain sides, boxing, and tournament riding are other popular\r\namusements; and, with the exception of boxing, the women compete with\r\nthe men in the amusements.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nSugar is king in Hawaii as wheat is in the Northwest. In 1890 there were\r\n19,000 laborers--nearly one-fifth of the total population--engaged on\r\nsugar plantations. Ten tons to the acre have been raised on the richest\r\nlands. The average is over four tons per acre, but it requires from\r\neighteen to twenty months for a crop to mature. Rice growing is also an\r\nimportant industry. It is raised in marsh lands, and nearly all the\r\nlabor is done by Chinese, though they do not own the land. Coffee is\r\nhappily well suited to the soil that is unfitted for sugar and rice, and\r\nthe Hawaiian coffee is particularly fine, combining the strength of the\r\nJava with a delicate flavor of its own.\r\n\r\nDiversified farming is coming more into vogue. Fruit raising will\r\nundoubtedly become one of the most important branches when fast steamers\r\nare provided for its transportation. Sheep and cattle raising must also\r\nprove profitable, since the animals require little feeding and need no\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\"Almost all kinds of vegetables and fruits can be raised, many of those\r\nbelonging to the temperate zones thriving on the elevated mountain\r\nslopes. Fruit is abundant; the guava grows wild in all the islands, and\r\nwere the manufacture of jelly made from it carried on, on a large scale,\r\nthe product could doubtless be exported with profit. Both bananas and\r\npineapples are prolific, and there are many fruits and vegetables, which\r\nas yet have been raised only for local trade, which would, if cultivated\r\nfor export, bring in rich returns.\r\n\r\n\"Of the total exports from the Hawaiian Islands in 1895, the United\r\nStates received 99.04 per cent., and in the same year 79.04 per cent. of\r\nthe imports to the islands were from the United States. The total value\r\nof the sugar sent to the United States in 1896 was $14,932,010; of rice,\r\n$194,903; of coffee, $45,444; and of bananas, $121,273.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF CITY.\r\n\r\nHonolulu, the capital city, is to Hawaii what Havana is to Cuba, or\r\nbetter, what Manila is to the Philippine Islands. Here are concentrated\r\nthe business, political and social forces that control the life and\r\nprogress of the entire archipelago. This city of 30,000 inhabitants is\r\nsituated on the south coast of Oahu, and extends up the Nuuanu Valley.\r\nIt is well provided with street-car lines--which also run to a bathing\r\nresort four miles outside the city--a telephone system, electric lights,\r\nnumerous stores, churches and schools, a library of over 10,000 volumes,\r\nand frequent steam communication with San Francisco. There are papers\r\npublished in the English, Hawaiian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Chinese\r\nlanguages, and a railroad is being built, of which thirty miles along\r\nthe coast are already completed. Honolulu has also a well-equipped fire\r\ndepartment and public water-works. The residence portions of the city\r\nare well laid out, the houses, many of which are very handsome, being\r\nsurrounded by gardens kept green throughout the year. The climate is\r\nmild and even, and the city is a delightful and a beautiful place of\r\nresidence. Hawaii is peculiarly an agricultural country, and Honolulu\r\ngains its importance solely as a distributing centre or depot of\r\nsupplies. Warehouses, lumber yards, and commercial houses abound, but\r\nthere is a singular absence of mills and factories and productive\r\nestablishments. There are no metals or minerals, or as yet, textile\r\nplants or food plants, whose manufacture is undertaken in this unique\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR CANE PLANTATION, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nAbout one-fifth of the entire population is engaged in sugar culture.\r\nThe average product is about three tons per acre.]\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands are, without question, on the threshold of a great\r\nindustrial era, fraught with most potent results to the prosperity and\r\ndevelopment of that land. Its climate is delightful and healthful, and\r\nits soil so fertile that it will easily support 5,000,000 people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENOR MONTERO RIOS\r\n\r\nPresident of the Spanish Peace Commission whose painful duty required\r\nhim to sign away his country's colonial possessions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL RAMON BLANCO\r\n\r\nWho succeeded Weyler as Captain-General of Cuba in 1897.

In\r\nthe hand of Providence, this island became the doorway to America. It\r\nwas here that Columbus landed, October 28, 1492. True, he touched\r\nearlier at one of the smaller islands to the north; but it was merely a\r\nhalting before pushing on to Cuba. \"Juana\" Columbus called the island,\r\nin honor of Isabella's infant son. Afterward it was successively known\r\nas Fernandina, Santiago, and Ave Maria; but the simple natives, who were\r\nthere to the number of 350,000, called it _Cooba_, and this name\r\nprevailed over the Spanish titles, as the island has finally prevailed\r\nover Spanish domination, and it has come under the protection of America\r\nwith its Indian name, slightly changed to _Cuba_, remaining as the sole\r\nand only heritage we have of the simple aborigines who have utterly\r\nperished from the face of the earth under Spanish cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN THE CATHEDRAL AT HAVANA.\r\n\r\nThe ashes of the great discoverer were removed from this tomb to Spain\r\nin December, 1898.]\r\n\r\nIn 1494 Columbus visited Cuba a second time, and once again in 1502. In\r\n1511 Diego Columbus, the son of the great discoverer, with a colony of\r\nbetween three and four hundred Spaniards, came, and in 1514 he founded\r\nthe towns of Santiago and Trinidad. Five years later, in 1519, the\r\npresent capital Havana, or _Habana_, was founded. The French reduced the\r\ncity in 1538, practically demolishing the whole town. Under the\r\ngovernor, De Soto, it was rebuilt and fortified, the famous Morro Castle\r\nand the Punta, which are still standing, being built at that early date.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\nThe natives, whom Columbus found in Cuba, were agreeable in feature, and\r\nso amiable in disposition that they welcomed the white man with open\r\narms, and, besides contributing food, readily gave up their treasures to\r\nplease the Spaniards. Unlike the warlike cannibal tribes of the Lesser\r\nAntilles, known as the Caribs, they lived in comparative peace with one\r\nanother, and had a religion which recognized the Supreme Being. Columbus\r\nheld several conferences with these simple natives, who numbered,\r\naccording to his estimate, from 350,000 to half a million souls, and his\r\nassociations and dealings with them on his first visit were always\r\nfriendly and of a mutually pleasing nature. But when he returned to\r\nSpain he left soldiers, who brutally maltreated them, until the natives\r\nrose in revolt and exterminated every white man. Even Columbus himself,\r\nin 1494, had to fight the Indians at the landing-place.\r\n\r\nA salubrious climate, a fertile soil, and simple wants rendered it\r\nunnecessary for the native to do hard work; and although it is well\r\nproven that he did mine copper and traded in it with the mound builders\r\nof Florida, yet the native was not accustomed to arduous toil, and\r\nrebelled against it. This, perhaps, was unfortunate, for the perpetuity\r\nof his race at that time depended upon this very quality. The Spanish\r\n\"friend\" who came to the island was incapable of work. He neither would\r\nnor could, under his ethics of self-respect, abase himself to labor, so\r\nhe proceeded to enslave the native to labor for him. The Cuban rebelled,\r\nand fled before the superior Spanish weapons from the coasts to the\r\nmountain fastnesses of the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERMINATION OF THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\nThen began that cruel and long-continued war of extermination, of which\r\nhistory has recorded the most shocking details. The conquest was begun\r\nunder Diego Columbus, the son of the great discoverer. The merciless\r\nVelasquez was his general, and the frightful cruelties which he\r\ninaugurated upon the simple natives have been continued for nearly four\r\nhundred years by his successors in the island, though the annihilation\r\nof the aboriginal tribes themselves was a brief and bloody work.\r\nVelasquez rode them down and trampled them--regardless of age or\r\nsex--under the iron hoofs of his war-horses, slashed them with swords,\r\ndevastated their villages, and bore them away into slavery. The Cuban\r\nhad no weapons; the mountain fastnesses could not hide him from his\r\nrelentless pursuer. African slaves, who were brought to the island in\r\nSpanish ships, were armed and forced by their masters to chase the\r\nnatives, and not a forest or mountain top was a place of refuge for\r\nthese doomed children of the soil. One historian declares: \"There is\r\nlittle doubt that before 1560 the whole of this native population had\r\ndisappeared from the island. They were so completely exterminated that\r\nit is doubtful if the blood of their race was even remotely preserved in\r\nthe mixed classes who followed African and Chinese introduction.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNIFICENT INDIAN STATUE IN THE PRADO, HAVANA, CUBA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA PERIOD OF REST.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two hundred years after the extermination of the natives,\r\nCuba rested without a struggle in the arms of Spain. The early settlers\r\nengaged almost wholly in pastoral pursuits. Tobacco was indigenous to\r\nthe soil, and in 1580 the Cuban planters began its culture. Later,\r\nsugar-cane was imported from the Canaries, and found to be a fruitful\r\nand profitable crop. The beginning of the culture of sugar demanded more\r\nlaborers, and the importation of additional slaves was the result. In\r\n1717, Spain attempted to make a monopoly of the tobacco culture, and the\r\nfirst Cuban revolt occurred. In 1723 a second uprising took place,\r\nbecause of an oppressive government; but these early revolts against\r\ntyranny were insignificant as compared with those of the last\r\nhalf-century.\r\n\r\nIn 1762, the city of Havana was captured by the English, with an\r\nexpedition commanded by Lord Albemarle, but his fighting troops were\r\nprincipally Americans under the immediate command of Generals Phineas\r\nLyman and Israel Putnam of Revolutionary fame. The story of Putnam's\r\ncommand in this war is thrilling and sad. After first suffering\r\nshipwreck and many hardships in reaching the island, they lay before\r\nHavana, where Spanish bullets and fever almost annihilated the whole\r\ncommand. Scarcely more than one in fifty lived to return to America. By\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, 1763, Cuba was unfortunately restored to Spain, and\r\nit was afterward that her troubles with the \"Mother Country,\" as Spain\r\naffectionately called herself to all her provinces, began. The hand of\r\noppression for one and a quarter centuries relaxed not its grasp, and\r\nyear by year grew heavier and more galling.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCONTENT AND INSURRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nSome of the most prolific seeds of modern revolutions may be said to\r\nhave been sown when the African slave trade assumed important\r\nproportions, in 1791. About the same time began a large importation of\r\nChinese coolies, for which Cuba paid a bounty of $400 apiece to the\r\nimporter. These coolies bound themselves to the Spaniards for eight\r\nyears, for which they were paid $4.00 per month as wages. The new influx\r\nof labor and the coming of Las Casas as Captain-General to Cuba, in\r\n1790, mark the beginning of Cuba's great period of prosperity. This\r\nenterprising ruler introduced numerous public improvements, established\r\nbotanical gardens and schools of agriculture, with a view to developing\r\nand increasing Cuba's resources and commercial importance. Owing to his\r\nwise administration, Cuba prospered and remained undisturbed for a long\r\nwhile. An insurrection occurred among the slaves in 1812, which was\r\npromptly put down with characteristic cruelty, and the blacks remained\r\n\"good niggers\" for a third of a century. By the year 1844, the slave\r\ntrade with Cuba had grown to enormous proportions. In that year alone,\r\nstatistics tell us, 10,000 slaves were landed from Africa upon the\r\nisland. Another wild and fanatical insurrection occurred the same year\r\namong them, which, as before, ended in failure. Seventy-eight of the\r\nrebels were shot, and many otherwise punished. By 1850, the slaves had\r\nso multiplied and the importation had been so large that the census\r\nshowed there were nearly 500,000 on the island.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in 1823 and 1827, insurrections were attempted on the part of\r\nthe Creoles (descendants of Spanish and French settlers) and other free\r\nCubans. They failed, and the blood of the martyrs was seed in the\r\nground. Revolutionist and enslaved insurrectionist gradually drifted\r\ntogether. They had a common cause--to struggle for freedom against\r\noppression. The bondsman was little or no worse off than the Creoles,\r\nChinese coolies, and free negroes--all native-born Cubans were shut out\r\nfrom the enjoyment of true citizenship. They must do the work and pay\r\nthe tribute, but Spaniards, born in Spain, were alone allowed to hold\r\noffice of profit or trust under the government; and they looked with\r\ninexpressible contempt upon the rest of the population, and, with the\r\nbacking of the army, preserved their domination in spite of their\r\ninferior numbers. The governor-general was appointed from Spain and held\r\noffice from three to five years, and was expected to steal or extort\r\nhimself rich in that time. It is said not one governor-general ever\r\nfailed to do so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DARING ATTACK BY THE PATRIOTS OF CUBA UPON A FORT NEAR\r\nVUELTAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEN YEARS' WAR.\r\n\r\nThe first long and determined struggle of the oppressed people of Cuba\r\nfor liberty began in 1868. In that year a revolution broke out in Spain,\r\nand the patriots seized the opportunity, while the mother country was\r\noccupied at home, for an heroic effort to liberate themselves. They rose\r\nfirst at Yara, in the district of Bayamo, and on October 10th of that\r\nyear made a declaration of independence. Eight days later the city of\r\nBayamo was taken by the patriots, and early in November they defeated a\r\nforce sent against them from Santiago. The majority of the South\r\nAmerican republics hastened to recognize the Cubans as belligerents;\r\nbut--though they held their own in guerrilla warfare against the Spanish\r\nforces for ten years, fighting in the forests and bravely resisting all\r\nthe efforts of Spain to subdue them--there was not one great power in\r\nthe world willing to extend to the patriots the recognition of\r\nbelligerent rights. The cruelty of the Spaniards toward the soldiers\r\nthey captured, and to all inhabitants who sympathized with the patriots'\r\ncause, was equaled only by the courage, fortitude, and exalted\r\npatriotism which animated their victims. The following instances,\r\nselected from scores that might be cited, are given in the Spaniards'\r\nown words, translated, _verbatim_, into English:\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH TESTIMONY OF HORRORS PRACTICED.\r\n\r\nJacob Rivocoba, under date of September 4, 1896, writes:\r\n\r\n   \"We captured seventeen, thirteen of whom were shot outright; on dying\r\n   they shouted, 'Hurrah for free Cuba! hurrah for independence!' A\r\n   mulatto said, 'Hurrah for Cespedes!' On the following day we killed a\r\n   Cuban officer and another man. Among the thirteen that we shot the\r\n   first day were found three sons and their father; the father\r\n   witnessed the execution of his sons without even changing color, and\r\n   when his turn came he said he died for the independence of his\r\n   country. On coming back we brought along with us three carts filled\r\n   with women and children, the families of those we had shot; and they\r\n   asked us to shoot them, because they would rather die than live among\r\n   Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nPedro Fardon, another officer, who entered entirely into the spirit of\r\nthe service he honored, writes on September 22, 1869:\r\n\r\n   \"Not a single Cuban will remain in this island, because we shoot all\r\n   those we find in the fields, on the farms, and in every hovel.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, again, on the same day, the same officer sends the following good\r\nnews to his old father:\r\n\r\n   \"We do not leave a creature alive where we pass, be it man or animal.\r\n   If we find cows, we kill them; if horses, ditto; if hogs, ditto; men,\r\n   women, or children, ditto; as to the houses, we burn them: so every\r\n   one receives his due--the men in balls, the animals in\r\n   bayonet-thrusts. The island will remain a desert.\"\r\n\r\nThese atrocities were perpetrated not alone by the common soldier. In\r\nfact, the above reports come from men who were officers in the Spanish\r\narmy, and they show that such actions were approved by the highest\r\nauthority. A well-authenticated account assures us that General Count\r\nBalmaceda himself went on one occasion to the home of a patriot family,\r\nMora by name, to arrest or kill the patriots he had heard were stopping\r\nthere; but, finding the men all absent, he wreaked his vengeance and\r\nthirst for blood by butchering the two Mora sisters and burning the\r\nhouse over their bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE AND FAIR PROMISES.\r\n\r\nAt last, Spain, seeing that she could neither induce the Cubans to\r\nsurrender nor draw them into a decisive battle; and finding,\r\nfurthermore, that her army of 200,000 men was likely to be annihilated\r\nby death, disease, and patriot bullets, made overtures, which, by\r\npromising many privileges to the people that they had not before\r\nenjoyed, effected a peace. As a result of this war, slavery was\r\nabolished in the island; but Spain's promises for fair and equitable\r\ngovernment were repudiated, and the civil powers became more\r\nextortionate and severe than ever. This war laid a heavy debt upon\r\nSpain, and Cuba was taxed inordinately. The people soon saw that they\r\nhad been duped. The world looked upon Cuba and Spain as at peace. To the\r\noutsider the surface was placid, but underneath \"the waters were\r\ntroubled.\" Such heroic spirits as Generals Calixto Garcia, Jose Marti,\r\nAntonio Maceo, and Maximo Gomez, leaders in the ten years' struggle,\r\nstill lived, though scattered far apart, and in their hearts bore a load\r\nof righteous wrath against their treacherous foe. While such men lived\r\nand such conditions existed another conflict was inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST GREAT STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM.\r\n\r\nIt was on February 24, 1895, that the last revolution of the Cuban\r\npatriots began. Spain had heard the mutterings of the coming storm, and\r\nhoped to stay it by visiting with severe punishment every Cuban\r\nsuspected of patriotic affiliations. Antonio Maceo, a mulatto, but a man\r\nof fortune and education, a veteran of the ten years' war, and a Cuban\r\nby birth, was banished to San Domingo. There were other exiles in Key\r\nWest, New York, and elsewhere. Jose Marti was the leading spirit in\r\nforming the Cuban Junta in New York and organizing revolutionary clubs\r\namong Cubans everywhere. Antonio Maceo was the first of the old leaders\r\nin the field. He went secretly to Cuba and began organizing the\r\ninsurrectionists, and when war was declared the flag of the new\r\nrepublic, bearing a lone white star in a red field, was flung to the\r\nbreeze. Captain-General Calleja declared martial law in the insurgents'\r\nvicinity, and troops were hastily summoned and sent from Spain. The\r\nrevolutionists from the start fought by guerrilla methods of warfare,\r\ndashing upon the unsuspecting Spanish towns and forces, and escaping to\r\nthe mountains before the organized Spaniards could retaliate.\r\n\r\nJose Marti and Jose Maceo--brother of the general--were prompt to join\r\nthe active forces, and on April 13, 1895, General Maximo Gomez, a native\r\nof San Domingo, came over and was made commander of the insurgent\r\nforces. This grizzled old hero, with nearly seventy years behind him,\r\nwas at once an inspiration and a host within himself. An army of 6,000\r\nmen was ready for his command, and the revolution took on new life and\r\nbegan in all its fury. On May 19th the insurgents met their first great\r\ndisaster, when Jose Marti was led into an ambush and killed. But his\r\nblood was like a seed planted, from which thousands of patriots sprang\r\nup for the ranks. Within a few days there were 10,000 ill-armed but\r\ndetermined men in the field. They had no artillery, nearly half were\r\nwithout guns, and there was little ammunition for those who were armed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANS OF CAMPOS THWARTED.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1895, Captain-General Calleja was replaced by Martinez Campos,\r\nthe commander in the preceding war, and one of the ablest of the Spanish\r\ngenerals. He sought to conciliate the people and alleviate the\r\nprevailing distress, but the rebels in arms had lost all faith in\r\nSpanish honor, while the veteran Gomez proved so wily that Campos could\r\nneither capture him nor force him into an engagement. Everywhere Gomez\r\nmarched he gathered new patriots. Near the city of Bayamo, Maceo\r\nattacked Campos, and the Spanish commander barely escaped with his life.\r\nHe was besieged in Bayamo, and had to stay there until 10,000 soldiers\r\nwere sent to escort him home. That was the last of Campos' fighting. By\r\nAugust, Spain had spent $21,300,000 and lost 20,000 men by death, and\r\n39,000 additional soldiers had been brought into the island, 25,000 of\r\nthem the flower of the Spanish army, and she was also forced to issue\r\n$120,000,000 bonds, which she sold at a great sacrifice, to carry on the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN C.D. SIGSBEE\r\n\r\nCommander of the \"Maine\" at the frightful catastrophe in Havana Harbor,\r\nFebruary 15, 1898.]\r\n\r\nThe patriots met September 13, 1895, at Camaguey and formed their\r\ngovernment by adopting a constitution and electing a president and other\r\nstate officers. This body formally conferred upon Gomez the commission\r\nof commander-in-chief of the army. Before the close of the month, there\r\nwere 30,000 rebels in the field. Spanish war-ships patroled the coast,\r\nbut the insurgents held the whole interior of Santiago province, and\r\ngovernment forces dared not venture away from the sea. The same was true\r\nof Santa Clara and Puerto Principe. Matanzas was debatable ground; but\r\nGomez made bold raids into the very vicinity of Havana. Spain continued\r\nto increase her army, till by the year 1898 it numbered about 200,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAs if the cup of Cuba's sorrow were not sufficiently bitter, or her\r\nlong-suffering patriots had not drunk deep enough of its gall, General\r\nCampos was recalled, and General Valeriano Weyler (nicknamed \"The\r\nButcher\") arrived in February, 1896. He promptly inaugurated the most\r\nbitter and inhuman policy in the annals of modern warfare. It began with\r\na campaign of intimidation, in which his motto was \"Subjugation or\r\nDeath.\" He established a system of espionage that was perfect, and the\r\ntestimony of the spy was all the evidence he required. He heeded no\r\nprayer and knew no mercy. His prisons overflowed with suspected\r\npatriots, and his sunrise executions, every morning, made room for\r\nothers. It was thus that General Weyler carried on the war from his\r\npalace against the unarmed natives, his 200,000 soldiers seldom securing\r\na shot at the insurgents, who were continually bushwhacking them with\r\ndeadly effect, while yellow fever carried them off by the thousands. How\r\nmany lives Weyler sacrificed in that dreadful year will never be known.\r\nHow many suspects he frightened into giving him all their gold for mercy\r\nand then coldly shot for treason, no record will disclose; but the\r\ncrowded, unmarked graves on the hillside outside Havana are mute but\r\neloquent witnesses of his infamy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUNRISE EXECUTIONS.\r\n\r\nOutside the prison walls, Havana. Weyler's way of getting rid of\r\nprisoners.]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, Gomez declared that all Cubans must take sides.\r\nThey must be for or against. It was no time for neutrals and there could\r\nbe no neutral ground, so he boldly levied forced contributions upon\r\nplanters unfavorable to his cause, and extended protection to those who\r\nbefriended the patriots. Exasperated by Weyler's atrocities upon\r\nnon-combatant patriots, he dared to destroy or confiscate the property\r\nof Spanish sympathizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF GENERAL MACEO.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 4, 1896, the insurgents suffered an irreparable\r\nloss in the death of General Maceo, who was led into an ambush and\r\nkilled, it is believed, through the treachery of his staff physician.\r\nEight brothers of Maceo had previously given their lives for Cuban\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1896, the island was desolate to an extreme perhaps\r\nunprecedented in modern times. The country was laid waste and the\r\ncities were starving. Under the pretext of protecting them, Weyler\r\ngathered the non-combatants into towns and stockades, and it is\r\nauthoritatively stated that 200,000 men, women, and children of the\r\n\"reconcentrados,\" as they were called, died of disease and starvation.\r\nThe insurgents remained masters of the island except along the coasts.\r\nThe only important incident of actual warfare was the capture of\r\nVictoria de las Tunas, in Santiago province, by General Garcia at the\r\nhead of 3,000 men, after three days' fighting. In this battle the\r\nSpanish commander lost his life and forty per cent. of his troops were\r\nkilled or wounded; the rest surrendered to Garcia, and the rebels\r\nsecured by their victory 1,000 rifles, 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition,\r\nand two Krupp guns.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1898 the United States intervened. The story of our war\r\nwith Spain for Cuba's freedom is elsewhere related.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARA BARTON.\r\n\r\nPresident of the American Red Cross Society.]\r\n\r\nSpain has paid dearly for her supremacy in Cuba during the last third of\r\nthe nineteenth century. Notwithstanding the fact that the revenue from\r\nCuba for several years prior to the Ten Years' War of 1868-78 amounted\r\nto $26,000,000 annually--about $18 for every man, woman, and child in\r\nthe island--$20,000,000 of it was absorbed in Spain's official circles\r\nat Havana, and \"the other $6,000,000 that the Spanish government\r\nreceived,\" says one historian, \"was hardly enough to pay transportation\r\nrates on the help that the mother country had to send to her army of\r\noccupation.\" Consequently, despite this enormous tax, a heavy debt\r\naccumulated on account of the island, even before the Ten Years' War\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEARFUL COST OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Ten Years' War (1878) Spain had laid upon the island\r\na public debt of $200,000,000, and required her to raise $39,000,000 of\r\nrevenue annually, an average at that time of nearly $30 per inhabitant.\r\nBut Spain's own debt had, also, increased to nearly $2,000,000,000, and\r\nduring this Ten Years' War she had sent 200,000 soldiers and her\r\nfavorite commanders to the island, only about 50,000 of whom ever\r\nreturned. According to our Consular Report of July, 1898, when the last\r\nrevolution began, 1895, the Cuban debt had reached $295,707,264. The\r\ninterest on this alone imposed a burden of $9.79 per annum upon each\r\ninhabitant. During the war, Spain had 200,000 troops in the island, and\r\nthe three and one-half years' conflict cost her the loss of nearly\r\n100,000 lives, mostly from sickness, and, as yet, unknown millions of\r\ndollars. The real figures of the loss of life and treasure seem\r\nincredible when we consider that Cuba is not larger than our State of\r\nPennsylvania, and that her entire population at the beginning of the war\r\nwas about one-fourth that of the State named, or a little less than that\r\nof the city of Chicago alone. Yet Spain, with an army larger than the\r\ncombined northern and southern forces at the battle of Gettysburg, was\r\nunable to overcome the insurgents, who had never more than one-fourth as\r\nmany men enlisted. But she harassed, tortured, and starved to death\r\nwithin three years, perhaps, over 500,000 non-combatant citizens in her\r\nattempt to subjugate the patriots, and was in a fair way to depopulate\r\nthe whole island when the United States at last intervened to succor\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF THE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nWhat the future of Cuba may be under new conditions of government\r\nremains to be seen. Certainly, in all the world's history few sadder or\r\nmore devastated lands have gathered their remnants of population upon\r\nthe ashes of their ruins and turned a hopeful face to the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPANISH MESTIZA.]\r\n\r\nBut the soil, the mineral and the timber not even Spanish tyranny could\r\ndestroy; and in these lie the hope, we might say the sure guarantee, of\r\nCuba's future. In wealth of resources and fertility of soil, Cuba is\r\nsuperior to all other tropical countries, and these fully justify its\r\nright to the title \"Pearl of the Antilles,\" first given it by Columbus.\r\nUnder a wise and secure government, its possibilities are almost\r\nlimitless. Owing to its location at the entrance of the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nwhich it divides into the Yucatan and Florida channels, on the south and\r\nnorth, the island has been termed the \"Key to the Gulf of Mexico,\" and\r\non its coat of arms is emblazoned a key, as if to imply its ability to\r\nopen or close this great sea to the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nCuba extends from east to west 760 miles, is 21 miles wide in its\r\nnarrowest part and 111 miles in the widest, with an average width of 60\r\nmiles. It has numerous harbors, which afford excellent anchorage. The\r\narea of the island proper is 41,655 square miles (a little larger than\r\nthe State of Ohio); and including the Isle of Pines and other small\r\npoints around its entire length, numbering in all some 1,200, there are\r\n47,278 square miles altogether in Cuba and belonging to it. The island\r\nis intersected by broken ranges of mountains, which gradually increase\r\nin height from west to east, where they reach an elevation of nearly\r\n8,000 feet. The central and western portions of the island are the most\r\nfertile, while the principal mineral deposits are in the mountains of\r\nthe eastern end. In Matanzas and other central provinces, the\r\nwell-drained, gently sloping plains, diversified by low, forest-clad\r\nhills, are especially adapted to sugar culture, and the country under\r\nnormal conditions presents the appearance of vast fields of cane. The\r\nwestern portion of the island is also mountainous, but the elevations\r\nare not great, and in the valleys and along the fertile slopes of this\r\ndistrict is produced the greater part of the tobacco for which the\r\nisland is famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILITY OF SOIL AND ITS PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the whole island seems well-nigh inexhaustible. Except in\r\ntobacco culture, fertilizers are never used. In the sugar districts are\r\nfound old canefields that have produced annual crops for a hundred years\r\nwithout perceptible impoverishment of the soil. Besides sugar and\r\ntobacco, the island yields Indian corn, rice, manioc (the plant from\r\nwhich tapioca is prepared), oranges, bananas, pineapples, mangoes,\r\nguava, and all other tropical fruits, with many of those belonging to\r\nthe temperate zone. Raw sugar, molasses, and tobacco are the chief\r\nproducts, and, with fruits, nuts, and unmanufactured woods, form the\r\nbulk of exports, though coffee culture, formerly active, is now being\r\nrevived, and its fine quality indicates that it must in time become one\r\nof the most important products of the island.\r\n\r\nAs a sugar country, Cuba takes first rank in the world. Mr. Gallon, the\r\nEnglish Consul, in his report to his government in 1897 upon this Cuban\r\ncrop, declared: \"Of the other cane-sugar countries of the world, Java is\r\nthe only one which comes within 50 per cent. of the amount of sugar\r\nproduced annually in Cuba in normal times, and Java and the Hawaiian\r\nIslands are the only ones which are so generally advanced in the process\r\nof manufacture.\" Our own Consul, Hyatt, in his report of February, 1897,\r\nexpresses the belief that Cuba is equal to supplying the entire demands\r\nof the whole western hemisphere with sugar--a market for 4,000,000 tons\r\nor more, and requiring a crop four times as large as the island has ever\r\nyet produced. Those who regard this statement as extravagant should\r\nremember that Cuba, although founded and settled more than fifty years\r\nbefore the United States, has nearly 14,000,000 acres of uncleared\r\nprimeval forest-land, and is capable of easily supporting a population\r\nmore than ten times that of the present. In fact, the Island of Java,\r\nnot so rich as Cuba, and of very nearly the same area, with less\r\ntillable land, has over 22,000,000 inhabitants as against\r\nCuba's--perhaps at this time--not more than 1,200,000 souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL AND TIMBER RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe mineral resources of Cuba are second in importance to its\r\nagricultural products. Gold and silver are not believed to exist in\r\npaying quantities, but its most valuable mineral, copper, seems to be\r\nalmost inexhaustible. The iron and manganese mines, in the vicinity of\r\nSantiago, are of great importance, the ores being rated among the finest\r\nin the world. Deposits of asphalt and mineral oils are also found.\r\n\r\nThe third resource of Cuba in importance is its forest product. Its\r\nmillions of acres of unbroken woodlands are rich in valuable hard woods,\r\nsuitable for the finest cabinet-work and ship-building, and also furnish\r\nmany excellent dye woods. Mahogany, cedar, rosewood, and ebony abound.\r\nThe palm, of which there are thirty-odd species found in the island, is\r\none of the most characteristic and valuable of Cuban trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of Cuba has been great in the past, but Spanish laws made\r\nit expensive and oppressive to the Cubans. Its location and resources,\r\nwith wise government, assure to the island an enormous trade in the\r\nfuture. There are already four cities of marked importance to the\r\ncommercial world: Havana with a population of 250,000, Santiago with\r\n71,000, Matanzas with 29,000, and Cienfuegos with 30,000, are all\r\nseaport cities with excellent harbors, and all do a large exporting\r\nbusiness. Add to these Cardenas with 25,000, Trinidad with 18,000,\r\nManzanillo with 10,000, and Guantanamo and Baracoa, each with 7,000\r\ninhabitants, we have an array of ten cities such as few strictly farming\r\ncountries of like size possess. Aside from cigar and cigarette making,\r\nthere is little manufacturing in Cuba; but fruit canneries, sugar\r\nrefineries, and various manufacturing industries for the consumption of\r\nnative products will rapidly follow in the steps of good government.\r\nHence, in the field of manufacturing this island offers excellent\r\ninducements to capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONS AND CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nLike all tropical countries, Cuba has but two seasons, the wet and the\r\ndry. The former extends from May to October, June, July, and August\r\nbeing the most rainy months. The dry season lasts from November to May.\r\nThis fact must go far toward making the island more and more popular as\r\na winter health resort. The interior of the island is mountainous, and\r\nalways pleasantly cool at night, while on the highlands the heat in the\r\nday is less oppressive than in New York and Pennsylvania during the\r\nhottest summer weather; consequently, when once yellow fever, which now\r\nravages the coasts of the island on account of its defective sanitation,\r\nis extirpated, as it doubtless will be under the new order of things,\r\nCuba will become the seat of many winter homes for wealthy residents of\r\nthe United States. Even in the summer, the temperature seldom rises\r\nabove 90 deg., while the average for the year is 77 deg. At no place,\r\nexcept in the extreme mountainous altitude, is it ever cold enough for\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VOLANTE, THE TYPICAL CUBAN CONVEYANCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVACUATION OF HAVANA.\r\n\r\nThe complete transfer of authority in the island of Cuba from Spain to\r\nthe United States took place on Sunday, January 1, 1899. At noon on that\r\nday Captain-General Castellanos and staff met the representatives of the\r\nUnited States in the hall of his palace, and with due formality and\r\nmarked Spanish courtesy, in the name of the King and Queen Regent of\r\nSpain, delivered possession of Cuba to General Wade, head of the\r\nAmerican Evacuation Committee, and he in turn transferred the same to\r\nGeneral Brooke, who had been appointed by President McKinley as Military\r\nGovernor of the Division of Cuba. No unpleasant incident marred the\r\noccasion. General Castellanos spoke with evident yet becoming emotion on\r\nso important an occasion. Three Cuban generals were present, who, at\r\nGeneral Castellanos' request, were presented to him, and the Spaniard\r\nsaid, with marked grace and evident sincerity, \"I am sorry, gentlemen,\r\nthat we are enemies, being of the same blood;\" to which one of the Cuban\r\npatriots courteously responded, with commendable charity, \"We fought\r\nonly for Cuba, and now that she is free we are no longer enemies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE PUBLIC GROUNDS, HAVANA, CUBA.]\r\n\r\nThe formal transfer had scarcely taken place within the palace hall when\r\nthe flag of Spain was lowered from Morro Castle, Cabanas Fortress, and\r\nall the public buildings, and the stars and stripes instantly arose in\r\nits place on the flagpoles of these old and historic buildings. As its\r\ngraceful folds floated gently out upon the breeze, the crowds from the\r\nstreets cheered, the band played the most appropriate of all airs, while\r\nvoices in many places in the throng, catching up the tune, sang the\r\ninspiring words of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NEW POSSESSIONS (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL PORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nIt was in November of the year 1493, on his second voyage to the New\r\nWorld, that Columbus landed upon a strange island in quest of water for\r\nhis ships. He found it in abundance, and called the place\r\n_Aquadilla_--the watering place. As he had done at Cuba the year before,\r\nthe great discoverer held pleasant conferences with the natives, and\r\nwith due ceremony took possession of the island for his benefactors and\r\nsovereigns--Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. From that day until it was\r\nceded to the United States in 1898, as a result of the Spanish-American\r\nWar, Porto Rico remained one of the most attractive and valuable of\r\nSpain's West Indian possessions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MARKET GIRL, PORTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nThe simple and friendly natives gladly welcomed their Spanish invaders,\r\nwho, with the same promptness which was manifested in Cuba, proceeded to\r\nenslave and exterminate them. In 1510, Ponce de Leon founded the first\r\nsettlement on the site of the present village of Puerto Viejo. The next\r\nyear the noted invader founded San Juan, the present capital of the\r\nisland. One of the most interesting sights of this old city to-day is\r\nthe Casa Blanca, built at that period as the palatial residence of Ponce\r\nde Leon. It was there, perhaps, after he had finished his conquest of\r\nthe island, that this famous old Spaniard listened to the wonderful\r\nstory of the natives, who served him as slaves, concerning the\r\nmysterious country over the sea which had hidden in its forests a\r\nfountain wherein an old man might plunge and be restored to all the\r\nvigor of youth. It was there and thus, perhaps, while sitting at leisure\r\nin his palace, that de Leon planned the voyage in search of that\r\n\"fountain of youth\" which resulted in the discovery and exploration of\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAN JUAN, PORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nThis city, the capital of Porto Rico, was founded by Ponce de Leon in\r\n1511. It is a fine specimen of an old walled town, having portcullis,\r\ngates, walls and battlements which cost millions of dollars. It is built\r\non a long, narrow island, connected with the mainland by a bridge. Its\r\npopulation in 1899, estimated at 31,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\nAs to the number of natives in Porto Rico when the Spaniards came old\r\nchroniclers differ. Some say there were 500,000, others 300,000. It is\r\nall surmise. Probably the latter figure is an over-estimate, for Cuba,\r\nmore than ten times as large, was not thought to contain more than half\r\na million inhabitants at most. A detailed account of their manners and\r\ncustoms was written by one of the early Spaniards, and part of it is\r\ntranslated by the British Consul, Mr. Bidwell, in his Consular Report of\r\n1880. Some of the statements in this old book are most peculiar and\r\ninteresting. Within the last forty years archaeologists have discovered\r\nmany stone axes, spear-heads and knives, stone and clay images, and\r\npieces of earthenware made by the aboriginal Porto Ricans, and these are\r\npreserved in the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, in Berlin, and\r\nelsewhere. It is curious that none of these remains had been found prior\r\nto 1856. On the banks of the Rio Grande there still stands, also, a rude\r\nstone monument, with strange designs carved upon its surface.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times, the island, with its rich produce and commerce,\r\nwas the prey of robbers. The fierce cannibal Caribs from the south made\r\nexpeditions to it before the white men came; and for many decades after\r\nthe Spanish conquest it suffered attacks from pirates by sea and\r\nbrigands upon land, who found easy hiding within its deep forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACKS AND INVASIONS BY FOREIGN FORCES.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, San Juan was sacked by the English under Drake, and again,\r\nthree years later, by the Duke of Cumberland. In 1615, Baldwin Heinrich,\r\na Dutchman, lost his life in an attack upon the governor's castle, and\r\nseveral of his ships were destroyed by a hurricane. The English failed\r\nto capture it, fifty-three years later; and Abercrombie tried it again\r\nin 1797, but had to give up the undertaking after a three days' siege.\r\nIt was one hundred and one years after Abercrombie's siege before\r\nanother hostile fleet appeared before and bombarded San Juan. That was\r\ndone by Admiral Sampson, May 12, 1898, with the United States squadron\r\nof modern ironclad battleships and cruisers. In this engagement Morro\r\nCastle, which, though impregnable a hundred years before, was unable to\r\nwithstand modern guns, and was in a large part reduced to ruins.\r\n\r\nGeneral Nelson A. Miles landed his United States troops on the island in\r\nJuly, 1898, and on the 12th of August, before he completed his conquest,\r\nhostilities were closed by the protocol of peace, and amid the rejoicing\r\nof the natives \"Beautiful Porto Rico\" became a province of the United\r\nStates. The one and only attempt the Porto Ricans ever made to throw off\r\nthe Spanish yoke was in 1820; but conditions for hiding from the\r\nsoldiers were not so good as the Cubans enjoyed in their large island,\r\nand Spanish supremacy was completely re-established by 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND AND ITS POPULATION.\r\n\r\nPorto Rico is at once the most healthful and most densely populated\r\nisland of the West Indies. It is almost rectangular in form--100 miles\r\nlong and 36 broad. Its total area is about 3,600 square miles--a little\r\nlarger than the combined areas of Rhode Island and Delaware. Its\r\npopulation, unlike that of Cuba, has greatly increased within the last\r\nfifty years. In 1830, it numbered 319,000; in 1887, 813,937--about 220\r\npeople to the square mile, a density which few States of the Union can\r\nequal. About half of its population are negroes or mulattoes, who were\r\nintroduced by the Spaniards as slaves in the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUSTOM HOUSE, PONCE, PORTO RICO, AFTER THE RAISING OF\r\nTHE AMERICAN FLAG BY GENERAL MILES.]\r\n\r\nAmong the people of European origin the most numerous are the Spaniards,\r\nwith many Germans, Swedes, Danes, Russians, Frenchmen, Chuetos\r\n(descendants from the Moorish Jews), and natives of the Canary Islands.\r\nThere are also a number of Chinese, while the Gibaros, or small\r\nland-holders and day-laborers of the country districts, are a curious\r\nold Spanish cross with the aboriginal Indian blood. In this class the\r\naborigines are more fortunate than the original Cubans in having even a\r\ntrace of their blood preserved.\r\n\r\nThe island is said to be capable of easily supporting three times its\r\npresent population, the soil is so universally fertile and its resources\r\nare so well diversified. Though droughts occur in certain parts of the\r\nisland, it is all extremely well watered, by more than one thousand\r\nstreams, enumerated on the maps, and the dry sections have a system of\r\nirrigation which may be operated very effectually and with little\r\nexpense. Of the 1,300 streams, forty-seven are considerable rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBER IN ABUNDANCE AND VARIETY.\r\n\r\nForests still cover all the elevated parts of the hill country of the\r\ninterior, the inhabitants living mostly along the coast. The main need\r\nto set the interior teeming with a thrifty and healthy population is a\r\nsystem of good roads. The interior, with the exception of a few\r\nextensive savannas, is one vast expanse of rounded hills, covered with\r\nsuch rich soil that they may be cultivated to their summits. At present\r\nthese forests are accessible only by mule tracks. \"The timber of the\r\nisland,\" says our official report, \"comprises more than five hundred\r\nvarieties of trees, and in the more elevated regions the vegetation of\r\nthe temperate zones is not unknown. On the hills is found a luxuriant\r\nand diversified vegetation, tree-ferns and mountain palms being\r\nabundant. At a lower level grow many varieties of trees noted for their\r\nuseful woods, such as the mahogany, cedar, walnut, and laurel. The\r\nmammee, guaiacum, and copal, besides other trees and shrubs valuable for\r\ntheir gum, flourish in all parts of the island. The coffee tree and\r\nsugar cane, both of which grow well at an altitude of a thousand feet or\r\nmore, were introduced into the island--the former from Martinique in\r\n1722, the latter from the Canaries, through Santo Domingo. Tobacco grows\r\neasily in the lowlands, while maize, pineapples, bananas, etc., are all\r\nprolific. The banana and plantain bear fruit within ten months after\r\nplanting, and like the cocoa palm, live through an ordinary life-time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALS AND MINING.\r\n\r\n\"The mineral resources of the island,\" says our consul in his report,\r\n\"have been very little developed, the only mineral industry of any\r\nimportance being the salt works situated at Guanica, Salinas, and Cabo\r\nRojo. Sulphides of copper and magnetic oxides of iron are found in large\r\nquantities, and formerly gold to a considerable extent was found in many\r\nof the streams. At present the natives still wash out nuggets by the\r\ncrude process in use in the time of Ponce de Leon. Marble, carbonates,\r\nlignite, and amber are also present in varying quantities, and hot\r\nsprings and mineral waters occur, the best known ones being at Coamo,\r\nnear Santa Isabel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of Porto Rico amounted, in 1896, to $36,624,120, exceeding\r\nthe records of all previous years; the increase, no doubt, being largely\r\ndue to the unsettled condition of Cuba. The value of the exports for the\r\nsame year was, for the first time for more than a decade, slightly in\r\nexcess of that of the imports; the former being valued at $18,341,430,\r\nthe latter at $18,282,690. The chief exports from the island are\r\nagricultural products. The principal articles are sugar, coffee,\r\nmolasses, and tobacco; while rice, wheat, flour, and manufactured\r\narticles are among the chief imports. The value of the sugar and\r\nmolasses exported to the United States during the ten years from 1888 to\r\n1897 made up 95 per cent. of the total value of the exports to that\r\ncountry. Fruits, nuts, and spices are also exported to a small extent.\r\nOf the non-agricultural exports the most important are perfumery and\r\ncosmetics; chemicals, drugs, and dyes; unmanufactured wood, and salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE BELLES, PORTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nThe leading article of import from the United States is wheat flour.\r\nCorn and meal, bread, biscuit, meats, dairy products, wood and its\r\nmanufactures, iron, steel, etc., are also imported.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSan Juan, the capital, is situated on an island off the northern coast\r\nof the mainland, with which it is now connected by the San Antonio\r\nbridge. The city is a perfect specimen of a walled and fortified town,\r\nwith Morro Castle crowning the promontory at the western extremity of\r\nthe island. The population, including the inhabitants of Marina and\r\nPuerta de Tierra, as well as those within the city walls, was estimated\r\nin 1896 at 30,000, and consists largely of negroes and of mixed races.\r\nOwing to the lack of a good water supply, and the general unsanitary\r\nconditions which prevail, the city is unhealthy. The houses are all of\r\ntwo stories, the poorer inhabitants occupying the ground floor, while\r\nthose better off live above them. There is no running water in the city,\r\nthe inhabitants being dependent for their supply upon the rainfall which\r\nis caught on the flat roofs of the houses and stored in cisterns, and in\r\ndry seasons the supply is entirely exhausted. The city is built upon\r\nclay mixed with lime packed hard and impervious to water. Its\r\nmanufactures are of small importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARKET PLACE, PONCE, PORTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Ponce, with a population of 37,500, and in commercial\r\nimportance the second city of Porto Rico, is situated two miles from the\r\ncoast in the southern part of the island. With an ample water supply\r\nconveyed to the city by an aqueduct it is, perhaps, the healthiest town\r\non the island. Playa, its port, having a population of 5,000, is\r\nconnected with it by a fine road.\r\n\r\nThe town of Arecibo, with a population of from 6,000 to 7,000, is\r\nsituated on the northern coast of Porto Rico, and is the port for a\r\ndistrict of some 30,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the island, though hot and humid, is healthful, except in\r\nmarshy districts and in cities where sanitary rules are neglected.\r\nYellow fever seldom occurs, and when it does it is confined to the\r\nunsanitary towns and their surroundings, never appearing far from the\r\ncoasts. The thermometer does not fall below 50 deg. or rise above 90 deg.\r\nThe heat is not so great as at Santiago, though the latter is one and a\r\nhalf degrees further north. As in Cuba, there are but two seasons, the\r\nrainy and the dry, the former lasting from July to December, the latter\r\nfrom January to the close of June. The delightful, dry and salubrious\r\natmosphere of midwinter and spring, with its general healthfulness,\r\npromises to bring this island into prominence both as a resort for\r\ninvalids and for homes to those who would escape the rigors of northern\r\nwinters.\r\n\r\nPorto Rico is an ideal lazy man's country, and the overworked American\r\nwill, undoubtedly, come to make it more and more his Mecca for rest and\r\nrecuperation. Even the interior feels the soft, salt air from the ocean.\r\nThe people are kind-hearted, \"easy-going,\" hospitable, and fond of\r\namusement. Every environment conduces to the dismission of all\r\nworriment, to rest, sleep, and a happy-go-lucky state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NEW POSSESSIONS (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n  \"Most bounteous here in her sea-girt lands,\r\n  Nature stretches forth her hands,\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  And walks on gold and silver, and knows her power increased,\r\n  Nor fears the tyrant longer--'Our Lady of the East.'\"--_Stoddard_.\r\n\r\nThe most important, and by far the most interesting, as well as the\r\nleast known of America's new possessions, gained by her war with Spain,\r\nare the Philippine Islands. Comparatively few Americans have ever set\r\nfoot upon that far-away and semi-civilized land, the possession of which\r\nenables America to say with England, \"The sun never sets upon our flag.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILIPINOS OF THE SAVAGE TRIBES.]\r\n\r\nThe Philippines lie almost exactly on the other side of the globe from\r\nus. Approximately speaking, our noonday is their midnight; our sunset is\r\ntheir sunrise. There are some 1,200 of these islands, 400 of which are\r\ninhabited or capable of supporting a population; they cover about\r\n125,000 square miles; they lie in the tropical seas, generally speaking,\r\nfrom five to eighteen degrees north latitude, and are bounded by the\r\nChina Sea on the west and the Pacific Ocean on the east; they are about\r\n7,000 miles southwest from San Francisco, a little over 600 southeast\r\nfrom Hong Kong, China, and about 1,000 almost due north from Australia;\r\nthey contain between 5,000,000 and 8,000,000 inhabitants, about\r\none-third of whom had prior to Dewey's victory, May 1, 1898,\r\nacknowledged Spanish sovereignty to the extent of paying regular tribute\r\nto the Spanish crown; the remainder are bound together in tribes under\r\nindependent native princes or Mohammedan rulers. Perhaps 2,500,000 all\r\ntold have become nominal Catholics in religion. The rest are Mohammedans\r\nand idolaters. There are no Protestant churches in the islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE HUNTERS, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ESCOLTA, LOOKING SOUTH.\r\n\r\nThis is the Broadway of Manila. Along this famous street the principal\r\nretail shops of the city are situated. Chinese and half-castes are the\r\nprincipal retail merchants. At the time of the capture of the city by\r\nAdmiral Dewey and General Merritt there were not over one dozen European\r\nmerchants in Manila. Not one American firm was there; the last one, a\r\nBoston hemp dealer, having been driven out some years before.]\r\n\r\nIt was twenty-nine years after Columbus discovered America that Magellan\r\nsaw the Philippines, the largest archipelago in the world, in 1521. The\r\nvoyage of Magellan was much longer and scarcely less heroic than that of\r\nthe discoverer of America. Having been provided with a fleet by the\r\nSpanish king with which to search for spice islands, but secretly\r\ndetermined to sail round the world, he set out with five vessels on\r\nAugust 10, 1519, crossed the Atlantic to America, and skirted the\r\neastern coast southward in the hope of finding some western passage into\r\nthe Pacific, which, a few years previous, had been discovered by Balboa.\r\nIt was a year and two months to a day from the time he left Spain until\r\nhe reached the southern point of the mainland of South America and\r\npassed through the straight which has since borne his name. On the way,\r\none of his vessels deserted; another was wrecked in a storm. When he\r\npassed through the Straight of Magellan he had remaining but three of\r\nhis original five ships, and they were the first European vessels that\r\never breasted the waves of the mighty western ocean. Once upon the\r\nunknown but placid sea--which he named the Pacific--the bold navigator\r\nsteered straight to the northwest. Five months later, about March\r\n1st, he discovered the Ladrone Islands--which name Magellan gave to the\r\ngroup on account of the thieving propensities of the natives--the word\r\n_Ladrone_ meaning robber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAUTIFUL LUNETA, MANILA's FASHIONABLE PROMENADE AND\r\nDRIVE.\r\n\r\nThis most celebrated drive and promenade in the city of Manila is by the\r\nold sea wall. The Governor and Archbishop, with their escorts and\r\nstriking equipages, came every afternoon to air themselves, and in the\r\ncool of every summer evening, when the fine military band of the Spanish\r\narmy used to play. The whole population apparently came out to listen.\r\nThis was also the place of all great processions, executions, etc.]\r\n\r\nAfter a short stay at the islands, he steered southwest, landing on the\r\nnorth coast of Mindanao, the second largest island of the Philippines.\r\nThe natives were friendly and offered to pilot Magellan to the island of\r\nCebu, which lay to the north, and which they reported to be very rich.\r\nAfter taking possession of Mindanao in the name of his king, the\r\ndiscoverer proceeded to Cebu, where he made such demonstrations and gave\r\nsuch descriptions of the glory and power of Spain that he easily formed\r\na treaty with the king of the island, who swore allegiance to his\r\nnew-found master and had himself and chief advisers baptized in the\r\nCatholic faith. Magellan then joined the king in his war against some of\r\nthe neighboring powers, and on April 25, 1521, was killed in a skirmish.\r\nThe spot where he fell is now marked by a monument.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\nTrouble soon arose between Magellan's sailors and their new-found\r\nallies. The Spaniards were invited to a banquet, and twenty-seven of\r\nthem were treacherously slain. The remainder, fearing for their lives,\r\nescaped in their ships and sailed for home. It was soon discovered that\r\nthey had too few men to manage the three vessels, and one of them was\r\ndestroyed. The other two proceeded on their voyage and discovered the\r\nspice island of Tidor, where they loaded with spices; but a few days\r\nlater one of the vessels sprang a leak and went down with her freight\r\nand crew. The other, after many hardships, reached Spain, thus\r\ncompleting the first circumnavigation of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND EXPEDITION TO THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nIn 1555, Philip II. came to the Spanish throne and determined to send\r\nanother expedition to the East Indies. His religious zeal inspired him\r\nto conquer and christianize the islands. To shorten the long and\r\ndangerous voyage, he decided to prepare and start with five ships from\r\nthe coast of Mexico. Miguel Lopez de Legaspi led the expedition,\r\nconsisting of four hundred soldiers and sailors and six Augustine monks.\r\nIn due time the expedition landed at Cebu. The formidable appearance of\r\nthe ships awed the natives, and on April 27, 1565--forty years after\r\nMagellan's remnant had fled from the island--Legaspi landed and took\r\npossession. In honor of the Spanish king the archipelago was given the\r\nname of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nIn 1570 Legaspi sent his grandson, Salcedo, to subdue the island of\r\nLuzon, the northernmost and the largest of the Philippine group. He\r\nlanded near the present site of Manila. The trustful natives readily\r\nagreed to accept the Spanish king as their master, and to pay tribute.\r\nSuch slight tribal resistances as were offered were quickly subdued. The\r\nnext year Legaspi went to Manila to visit his grandson; and, seeing the\r\nimportance of the situation and its fine harbor, declared that city the\r\ncapital of the whole archipelago and the king of Spain the sovereign of\r\nall the islands. Accordingly, he moved his headquarters to that point,\r\nbuilt houses and fortifications, and within a year had the city well\r\norganized, when he died, leaving Salcedo as his successor in command. It\r\nis remarkable how much these two men accomplished with so small a force;\r\nbut they did it not so much by arms as by cajoling and deceiving the\r\nsimple natives. Furthermore, they allowed the conquered people to be\r\ngoverned by their own chiefs in their own way, so long as they paid a\r\nliberal tribute to the Spanish crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLES FOE SUPREMACY.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Philippines has been monotonous from their discovery\r\nuntil the present, a monotony broken at times by periods of adventures\r\nin which Manila has generally been the central scene. About 1580,\r\nLima-hong, a Chinese pirate, took the city with an armed fleet of\r\nsixty-two vessels, bearing 4,000 men and 1,500 women. They met with\r\nstubborn resistance, but succeeded in scaling the walls and entering the\r\ncity. The Spanish forces were driven into a fort, which the Chinese\r\nstormed. A bloody hand-to-hand conflict followed, and the Chinese were\r\nfinally repulsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIPPINE WARRIORS.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century the Dutch attempted to obtain\r\npossession of the Philippines. They captured scores of Spanish\r\nmerchantmen and treasure ships. Many naval engagements followed, the\r\ndetails of which read like the thrilling records of buccaneers and\r\npirates, rather than the wars between two civil powers. Finally, after\r\nhalf a century of warfare, the Dutch were decisively beaten, and\r\nabandoned their efforts to capture the Spanish islands, much to the\r\ndisadvantage of the Filipinos, for the islands of Java, Sumatra, and\r\nother Dutch possessions to the south of the Philippines have been\r\nremarkably prosperous under the mild rule of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILA TAKEN BY THE ENGLISH.\r\n\r\nIn 1662, the Chinese planned a revolution against the Spanish\r\nauthorities. The governor heard of it, and a general massacre of the\r\nMongolians followed. It was even planned to destroy every Chinaman on\r\nthe islands, and they were in a fair way to do it, when, at length, the\r\nSpaniards bethought themselves that by so doing they would practically\r\ndepopulate the islands of tradesmen and mechanics. Accordingly, they\r\noffered pardon to those who would surrender and swear allegiance. A\r\ncentury later, England sent a fleet under Admiral Cornish, with General\r\nDraper commanding the troops, against Manila. After a desperate battle\r\nthe city fell, and the terms of surrender incorporated provisions for\r\nfree trade, freedom of speech, and, best of all, freedom in religion to\r\nthe inhabitants of the islands, and required Spain to pay England about\r\n$4,000,000 indemnity. By the Peace of Paris, in 1763, however, the war\r\nbetween England and Spain was terminated, and one of the conditions was\r\nthat Spain should retain the sovereignty of the Philippines. The English\r\ntroops were withdrawn, and the unfortunate islands were again placed (as\r\nCuba was by the same treaty) under the domination of their tyrannical\r\nmistress, and remained under Spanish rule from that time until the\r\nAmericans freed them in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPRISINGS OF THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the uprisings of the natives, the tyranny of the church,\r\nas conducted by the friars and priests, was the cause. Such was the case\r\nin 1622, in 1649, and in 1660. The occasion of the revolt of 1744 is a\r\nfair example of the provocations leading to all. A Jesuit priest ordered\r\nall his parishioners arrested as criminals when they failed to attend\r\nmass. One of the unfortunates died, and the priest denied him rights of\r\nburial, ordering that his body be thrown upon the ground and left to rot\r\nin the sun before his dwelling. The brother of the man in his\r\nexasperation organized a mob, captured the priest, killed him, and\r\nexposed his body for four days. Thus was formed the nucleus of a rebel\r\narmy. The insurgents in their mountain fastnesses gained their\r\nindependence and maintained it for thirty-five years, until they secured\r\nfrom Spain a promise of the expulsion of the Jesuit priests from the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nOther revolutions followed in 1823, 1827, and 1844, but all were\r\nsuppressed. In 1872, the most formidable outbreak up to that time\r\noccurred at Cavite. Hatred of the Spanish friars was the cause of this\r\nuprising also. Spain had promised in the Council of Trent to prohibit\r\nfriars from holding parishes. The promises were never carried out, and\r\nthe friars grew continually richer and more powerful and oppressive. Had\r\nthe plan of the insurgents not been balked by a mistaken signal, no\r\ndoubt they would have destroyed the Spanish garrison at Manila, but a\r\nmisunderstanding caused their defeat. The friars insisted that the\r\ncaptured leaders should be executed, and it was done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NATIVE RESIDENCE IN THE SUBURBS OF MANILA.\r\n\r\nEvery cottage, however humble, is surrounded by tropical trees and\r\nflowers. The interiors are remarkably clean and cheerful. Bamboo enters\r\nlargely into the construction of all native houses and they are\r\ngenerally covered with thatch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, the insurrection broke out again. Its causes were the old\r\noppressions: unbearable taxes, and imprisonment or banishment, with the\r\ncomplete confiscation of property of those who could not pay; no justice\r\nexcept for those who could buy it; extortion by the friars; marriage\r\nceremony so costly that a poor man could not pay the fee; homes and\r\nfamilies broken up and ruined; burial refused to the dead, unless a\r\nlarge sum was paid in advance; no provision and no chance for education.\r\nSuch were some of the causes that again goaded the natives to revolution\r\nand nerved them with courage to achieve victory after victory over their\r\nenemies until they were, promised most of the reforms which they\r\ndemanded. Then they laid down their arms, and, as usual, the\r\nGovernor-General failed to carry out a single pledge.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition, and another revolt, more formidable than any of\r\nthe past, was forming, when Commodore Dewey with his American fleet\r\nentered Manila Bay, May 1, 1898, and, by a victory unparalleled in naval\r\nwarfare, sunk the Spanish ships, silenced the forts, and dethroned the\r\npower of Spain forever in a land which her tyranny had blighted for more\r\nthan three hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS: THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the scope of this article to give details\r\nconcerning all the inhabitants of this far-away archipelago. Professor\r\nWorcester, of the University of Michigan, tells us that the population\r\ncomprises more than eighty distinct tribes, with individual\r\npeculiarities. They are scattered over hundreds of islands, and one who\r\nreally wants to know these peoples must leave cities and towns far\r\nbehind, and, at the risk of his life, through pathless forests, amid\r\nvolcanic mountains, at the mercy of savages, penetrate to the innermost\r\nwilds. Notwithstanding the fact that for hundreds of years bold men, led\r\nby the love of science or by the spirit of adventure, have continued to\r\npenetrate these dark regions, there are many sections where the foot of\r\ncivilized man has never trod; or, if so, he came not back to tell of the\r\nlands and peoples which his eyes beheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF EXPLORING THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThere have been great obstacles in the way of a thorough exploration of\r\nthese islands. Spain persistently opposed the representatives of any\r\nother nation entering the country. She suspected every man with a gun of\r\ndesigning to raise an insurrection or make mischief among the natives.\r\nThe account of red tape necessary to secure guns and ammunition for a\r\nlittle party of four or five explorers admitted through the customs at\r\nManila is one of the most significant, as well as one of the most\r\nhumorous, passages in Professor Worcester's story of his several years'\r\nsojourn while exploring the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the savage tribes in the interior had no respect\r\nfor Spain's authority, and will have none for ours for years to come.\r\nTwo-thirds of them paid no tribute, and many of them never heard of\r\nSpain, or, if so, only remembered that a long time ago white men came\r\nand cruelly persecuted the natives along the shore. These wild tribes\r\nthink themselves still the owners of the land. Some of them go naked and\r\npractice cannibalism and other horrible savage customs. Any explorer's\r\nlife is in danger among them; consequently most tourists to the\r\nPhilippines see Manila and make short excursions around that city. The\r\nmore ambitious run down to the cities of Iloilo and Cebu, making short\r\nexcursions into the country from those points, and then return, thinking\r\nthey have seen the Philippines. Nothing could be further from the truth.\r\nSuch travelers no more see the Philippine Islands than Columbus explored\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL MORO VILLAGE, SOUTHERN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nEven near the coast there are savages who are almost as ignorant as\r\ntheir brethren in the interior. Mr. Stevens tells us that only \"thirty\r\nmiles from Manila is a race of dwarfs that go without clothes, wear\r\nknee-bracelets of horsehair, and respect nothing but the jungle in which\r\nthey live.\" The principal native peoples are of Malayan origin. Of\r\nthese, to the north of Manila are the Igorrotes; in the islands south of\r\nLuzon are the civilized Visayas, and below them in Mindanao and the Sulu\r\nArchipelago are the fierce Moros, who originally came from the island of\r\nBorneo, settling in the Philippines a short time before the Spanish\r\ndiscovery. They are Mohammedans in religion, and as fanatical and as\r\nfearless fighters as the Turks themselves. For three hundred years the\r\nSpaniards have been fighting these savages, and while they have overcome\r\nthem in nearly all the coast towns, they have expended, it is said,\r\nupward of $100,000,000 and sacrificed more than one hundred thousand\r\nlives in doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARLIKE MOROS.\r\n\r\nThe fierce Moro warriors keep the Spanish settlers along their coasts in\r\na constant state of alarm, and the visitor to the towns feels as if he\r\nwere at an Indian outpost in early American history, because of the\r\nconstant state of apprehension that prevails. Fortunately, however, the\r\nMoros along the coast have learned to distinguish between the Spaniard\r\nand the Englishman or American, and through them the generosity of the\r\n_Englese_, as they call all Anglo-Saxons, has spread to their brethren\r\nin the interior. Therefore, American and English explorers have been\r\nenabled to go into sections where the Spanish friars and monks, who have\r\nbeen practically the only Spanish explorers, would meet with certain\r\ndeath. The Mohammedan fanaticism of the Moros, and that of the Catholic\r\nfriars and Jesuits, absolutely refuse compromise.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos (little Negroes) and the Mangyans are the principal\r\nrepresentatives of the aboriginal inhabitants before the Malayan tribes\r\ncame. There are supposed to be, collectively, about 1,000,000 of them,\r\nand they are almost as destitute of clothing and as uncivilized as the\r\nsavages whom Columbus found in America, and far more degenerate and\r\nloathsome in habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF MANILA.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Luzon, on which the city of Manila stands, is about as\r\nlarge as the State of New York, its area being variously estimated at\r\nfrom 43,000 to 47,000 square smiles. It is the largest island in the\r\nPhilippine group, comprising perhaps one-third of the area of the entire\r\narchipelago. Its inhabitants are the most civilized, and its territory\r\nthe most thoroughly explored. The city of Manila is the metropolis of\r\nthe Philippines. The population of the city proper and its environs is\r\nconsidered to be some 300,000 souls, of whom 200,000 are natives, 40,000\r\nfull-blooded Chinese, 50,000 Chinese half-castes, 5,000 Spanish, mostly\r\nsoldiers, 4,000 Spanish half-castes, and 300 white foreigners other than\r\nSpaniards. Mr. Joseph Earle Stevens, already referred to, who\r\nrepresented the only American firm in the city of Manila, under Spanish\r\nrule (which finally had to turn its business over to the English and\r\nleave the island a few years since), informs us that he and three others\r\nwere the only representatives of the United States in Manila as late as\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nThe city is built on a beautiful bay from twenty-five to thirty miles\r\nacross, and on both shores of the Pasig River. On the right bank of the\r\nriver, going up from the bay, is the old walled town, and around the\r\nwalls are the weedy, moats or ditches. The heavy guns and frowning\r\ncannon from the walls suggest a troubled past. This old city is built in\r\ntriangular form, about a mile on each side, and is regarded as very\r\nunhealthful, for the walls both keep out the breeze and keep in the foul\r\nair and odors. The principal buildings in the old part of the city are\r\nthe cathedral, many parish churches, a few schoolhouses, and the\r\nofficial buildings. The population in the walled city is given at\r\n20,000. Up to a few years ago, no foreigner was permitted to sleep\r\nwithin its walls on account of the Spaniards' fear of a conspiracy. A\r\nbridge across the Pasig connects old Manila with the new or unwalled\r\ncity, where nearly all of the business is done and the native and\r\nforeign residents live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE PASIG RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis bridge connects the old walled city on one side of the river with\r\nthe new unwalled city on the other. Sea-going vessels ascend the river\r\nup to the bridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES AND TYPHOONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIPYARDS AND ARSENAL AT CAVITE.\r\n\r\nCavite is a city of about 5000 inhabitants, ten miles from Manila. The\r\nSpanish arsenal and the only shipyards in the colony are located here.\r\nIt is the chief naval station of the islands, and has always been\r\nconsidered the key to Manila from the sea. It was seized by the\r\ninsurgents in 1872, and again in 1896, and it was its forts that so\r\nharassed Dewey with their bombardment, and it was one of the first\r\nplaces occupied by the Americans after the fall of Manila.]\r\n\r\nIt does not take one long to exhaust the sights of Manila, if the\r\npeople, who are always interesting, are excepted. Aside from the\r\ncathedral and a few of the churches, the buildings of the city are\r\nanything but imposing. In fact, there is little encouragement to\r\nconstruct fine edifices because of the danger from earthquakes and\r\ntyphoons. It is said that not a year passes without a number of slight\r\nearthquake shocks, and very serious ones have occurred. In 1645\r\nnearly all of the public buildings were wrecked and 600 persons killed.\r\nA very destructive earthquake was that of 1863, when 400 people were\r\nkilled, 2,000 wounded, and 46 public buildings and 1,100 private houses\r\nwere badly injured or completely destroyed. In 1874 earthquakes were\r\nagain very numerous throughout the islands, shocks being felt at\r\nintervals in certain sections for several weeks. But the most violent\r\nconvulsion of modern times occurred in 1880 when even greater\r\ndestruction than in 1863 visited Manila and other towns of Luzon.\r\nConsequently there are very few buildings to be found more than two\r\nstories high; and the heavy tile roofs formerly in use have, for the\r\nmost part, been replaced by lighter coverings of galvanized iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISING THE FLAG ON FORT SAN ANTONIO DE ABAD, MALATE.\r\n\r\nThis old fort was silenced by Dewey's guns August 13, 1898, with the\r\nassistance of land forces under General Anderson. The Astor Battery on\r\nshore under Captain March supported General McArthur's forces on the\r\nright wing. It was the California and Colorado Volunteer Regiments, with\r\nthe Eighteenth Regulars, who finally drove out the Spaniards and\r\noccupied the position where the Californians at once raised the Stars\r\nand Stripes. The marks of Dewey's shells are seen on the side of the\r\nfort.]\r\n\r\nThese light roofs, however, are in constant danger of being stripped off\r\nby the typhoons, terrible storms which come with a twisting motion as if\r\nrising from the earth or the sea, fairly pulling everything detachable\r\nafter them. Masts of ships and roofs of houses are frequently carried by\r\nthese hurricanes miles distant. The better to resist the typhoons, most\r\nof the light native houses are built on bamboo poles, which allow the\r\nwind to pass freely under them, and sway and bend in the storm like a\r\ntree; whereas, if they were set solidly on the earth, they would be\r\nlifted up bodily and carried away. Glass windows being too frail to\r\nresist the shaking of the earthquakes and the typhoons, small,\r\ntranslucent oyster shells are used instead. The light thus admitted\r\nresembles that passing through ground-glass, or, rather, stained glass,\r\nfor the coloring in the shells imparts a mellow tinted radiance like the\r\nwindows of a cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A POPULAR STREET CONVEYANCE.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, carriages and street cars are used in Manila, but there\r\nare hundreds of the above \"native cabs,\" for carrying single persons\r\nshort distances, and they are liberally patronized.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILA AS A BUSINESS CENTER.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Manila are wretchedly paved or not paved at all, and as\r\nlate as 1893 were lighted by kerosene lamps or by wicks suspended in\r\ndishes of cocoanut oil. Lately an electric plant has been introduced,\r\nand parts of the city are lighted in this manner. There are two lines of\r\nstreet cars in Manila. The motive power for a car is a single small\r\npony, and foreigners marvel to see one of those little animals drawing\r\nthirty-odd people.\r\n\r\nThe retail trade and petty banking of Manila is almost entirely in the\r\nhands of the half-castes and Chinese, and many of them have grown\r\nimmensely wealthy. There are only about three hundred Europeans in\r\nbusiness in the whole Philippine group, and they conduct the bulk of the\r\nimporting and exporting trade. Manila contains a number of large cigar\r\nand cigarette factories, one of which employs 10,000 hands. There is\r\nalso a sugar refinery, a steam rice mill, and a rope factory worked\r\npartly by men and partly by oxen, a Spanish brewery and a German cement\r\nfactory, a Swiss umbrella factory and a Swiss hat factory. The single\r\ncotton mill, in which $200,000 of English capital is invested, runs\r\n6,000 spindles.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of 1897 show that the whole trade of Manila comprised\r\nonly forty-five Spanish, nineteen German, and seventeen English firms,\r\nwith six Swiss brokers and two French storekeepers having large\r\nestablishments. One of the most profitable businesses is said to be that\r\nof selling cheap jewelry to the natives. Breastpins which dealers buy in\r\nEurope for twelve cents each are readily sold for from $1.50 to $2.00\r\neach to the simple Filipinos. Almost everything that is manufactured\r\nabroad has a fine prospective market in the Philippines, when the\r\ncondition of the people permits them to buy.\r\n\r\nA certain charm attaches to many specimens of native handiwork. The\r\nwomen weave exquisitely beautiful fabrics from the fiber of plants. The\r\nfloors of Manila houses are admired by all foreigners. They are made of\r\nhard wood and polished with banana leaves and greasy cloths until they\r\nshine brightly and give an aspect of cool airiness to the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WEDDING PROCESSION.\r\n\r\nAs in Asiatic countries, weddings in the Philippines are occasions of\r\ngreat ceremony. No marriage would be considered \"in style\" without a\r\ngorgeous procession.]\r\n\r\nAny kind of amusement is popular with the Filipinos--with so much\r\nleisure on their hands--provided it does not require too great exertion\r\non their part. They are fond of the theatre, and, up to a few years ago,\r\nbullfighting was a favorite pastime; but the most prominent of modern\r\namusements for the natives and half-castes is cockfighting. It is said\r\nthat every native has his fighting cock, which is reared and trained\r\nwith the greatest care until he shows sufficient skill to entitle him to\r\nan entrance into the public cockpit where he will fight for a prize. The\r\nchickens occupy the family residence, roosting overhead; and, in case of\r\nfire, it is said that the game \"rooster\" is saved before the babies.\r\nProfessor Worcester tells an amusing story of the annoyance of the\r\ncrowing cocks above his head in the morning and the devices and tricks\r\nhe and his companions employed to quiet them. The Manila lottery is\r\nanother institution which intensely excites the sluggish native, and\r\ntakes from him the money which he does not lose on the cockfights. Under\r\nthe United States Government this lottery will, no doubt, be abolished\r\nin time. It formerly belonged to the Spanish Government, and Spain\r\nderived an annual profit of half a million dollars from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMMERCE OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary, so far as the commercial world is concerned, to\r\nmention any other locality outside of the city of Manila. To commerce,\r\nthis city (whose total imports in 1897 were only $10,000,000 and its\r\nexports $20,000,000) is the Philippine Islands. Its present meagre\r\nforeign trade represents only an average purchase of about one dollar\r\nper inhabitant, and an average sale of two dollars per inhabitant for\r\nthe largest archipelago in the world, and one of the richest in soil and\r\nnatural resources. The bulk of these exports were hemp, sugar, and\r\ntobacco; and, strange as it may seem, the United States received 41 per\r\ncent. of her hemp and 55 per cent. of her sugar for the year 1897,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that we had not one commercial firm doing\r\nbusiness in that whole vast domain.\r\n\r\nThe city of Iloilo is on the southern coast of the fertile island of\r\nPanay, and, next to Manila, the chief port of the Philippines. It has an\r\nexcellent harbor, and the surrounding country is very productive, having\r\nextensive plantations of sugar, rice, and tobacco. The population of\r\nIloilo is only 12,000, but there are a few larger towns in the district,\r\nof which it is the seaport. Though the city at spring tides is covered\r\nwith water, it is said to be a very healthful place, and much cooler\r\nthan Manila.\r\n\r\nThe other open port, Cebu, on the eastern coast of the island of the\r\nsame name, is a well-built town, and has a population of about 13,000.\r\nFrom this point the bulk of the hemp for export comes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak of the other islands in detail. Seven of the\r\ngroup average larger than the State of New Jersey; Luzon is as extensive\r\nas Ohio, Mindanao equals Indiana; and, as we have stated before, about\r\nfour hundred of them are inhabitable, and, like Java, Borneo, and the\r\nSpice Islands, all are rich in natural resources. They are of a volcanic\r\norigin, and may be described in general as rugged and mountainous. The\r\ncoasts of most of the islands are deeply indented by the sea, and the\r\nlarger ones are well watered by streams, the mouths of which afford good\r\nharbors. Many of the mountainous parts abound in minerals. Mr. Karuph,\r\nPresident of the Philippine Mineral Syndicate, in May, 1898, addressed a\r\nletter to Hon. John Hay, at that time our ambassador to England, in\r\nwhich he declares that the Philippines will soon come prominently\r\nforward as a new center of the world's gold production. \"There is not a\r\nbrook,\" says Mr. Karuph, \"that finds its way into the Pacific Ocean\r\nwhose sands and gravel do not pan the color of gold. Many valuable\r\ndeposits are close to deep water. I know of no other part of the world,\r\nthe Alaskan Treadwell mines alone excepted, where pay ore is found\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of the anchorage of sea-going vessels.\" In\r\naddition to gold, iron, copper, lead, sulphur, and other minerals are\r\nfound, and are believed to exist in paying quantities. The numerous\r\nmineral springs attest their presence in almost every part of the\r\nprincipal islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING SUGAR.\r\n\r\nLarge pans containing the sugar are set in the sun to evaporate the\r\nmoisture. No refining or clarifying machinery has been introduced into\r\nthe Philippine Islands.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTS AND TIMBER.\r\n\r\nThe forest products of the islands are perhaps of greater value than\r\ntheir mineral resources. Timber not only exists in almost exhaustless\r\nquantity, but--considering the whole group, which extends nearly a\r\nthousand miles from north to south--in unprecedented diversity,\r\nembracing sixty varieties of the most valuable woods, several of which\r\nare so hard that they cannot be cut with ordinary saws, some so heavy\r\nthat they sink in water, and two or three so durable as to afford ground\r\nfor the claim that they outlast iron and steel when placed in the\r\nground or under water. Several of these woods are unknown elsewhere,\r\nand, altogether, they are admirably suited for various decorative\r\npurposes and for the manufacture of fine implements and furniture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRANGE WAGONS OF ALBAY.\r\n\r\nThe eighty-odd different tribes who inhabit the Philippines have varying\r\ndialects, manners, and customs. The peculiar house-roofed wagons, shown\r\nin the above illustration, are found in only one locality.]\r\n\r\nHere also are pepper, cinnamon, wax, and gums of various sorts, cloves,\r\ntea, and vanilla, while all tropical fruits, such as cocoanuts, bananas,\r\nlemons, limes, oranges of several varieties, pineapples, citrons,\r\nbread-fruits, custard apples, pawpaws, and mangroves nourish, and most\r\nof them grow wild, though, of course, they are not equal to the\r\ncultivated fruit. There are fifty-odd varieties of the banana in the\r\narchipelago, from the midget, which makes but a single mouthful, to the\r\nhuge fruit eighteen inches long. There seems to be no limit to which\r\ntropical fruits and farm products can be cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe animal and bird life of the Philippines offer a field of interesting\r\nresearch to naturalists. There are no important carnivorous animals. A\r\nsmall wild-cat and two species of civet-cats constitute about all that\r\nbelong to that class. The house-cats of the Philippines have curious\r\nfish-hook crooks in the ends of their tails. There are several species\r\nof deer in the archipelago. Hogs run wild in large numbers. The large\r\nwater buffalo (_carabao_) has been domesticated and is the chief beast\r\nof burden with the natives. The _timarau_ is another small species of\r\nbuffalo, very wild and entirely untamable; and, though numerous in\r\ncertain places, is hard to find, and when brought to bay dies fighting.\r\n\r\nBirds abound in all of the islands; nearly six hundred species have been\r\nfound, over fifty of which exist nowhere else in the world. One of these\r\nspecies builds a nest which is highly prized by Chinese epicures as an\r\narticle of diet. Prof. Worcester tells us \"the best quality of them\r\nsometimes bring more than their weight in gold.\" Crocodiles are numerous\r\nin fresh-water lakes and streams, attaining enormous size, and in\r\ncertain places causing much loss of life among stock and men as well.\r\nSnakes also abound, and some of them are very venomous. Cobras are found\r\nin the southern islands. Pythons are numerous, some of the smaller sizes\r\nbeing sold in the towns and kept in houses to catch rats, at which they\r\nare said to be more expert than house-cats.\r\n\r\nAll the domestic animals, aside from the _carabao_, have been introduced\r\nfrom abroad. Cattle are extensively raised, and in some of the islands\r\nrun wild. The horses are a small Spanish breed, but are very strong and\r\nhave great endurance. Large European horses do not stand the climate\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE, VOLCANOES, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual temperature of Manila is 80 deg. F. The thermometer seldom\r\nrises above 100 deg. or falls below 60 deg. anywhere in the archipelago.\r\nThere is no month in the year during which it does not rise as high as 91\r\ndeg. January and December are the coldest months, the average temperature\r\nbeing 70 deg. to 73 deg.. May is the warmest, the average being 84 deg.\r\nApril is the next warmest, with an average of 83 deg.; but the weather\r\nis generally very moist and humid, which makes the heat more trying. The\r\nthree winter months have cool nights. Malaria is prevalent, but\r\ncontagious diseases are comparatively few. Yellow fever and cholera are\r\nseldom heard of.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines are the home of many volcanoes, a number of them still\r\nactive. Mayon, in the island of Luzon, is one of the most remarkable\r\nvolcanic mountains on the globe. It is a perfect cone, rising to the\r\nheight of 8,900 feet, and is in constant activity; its latest\r\ndestructive eruption took place in 1888. Apo, in the island of Mindanao,\r\n10,312 feet high, is the largest of the Philippine volcanoes. Next is\r\nCanloon in Negros, which rises 8,192 feet above the sea. Taal is in a\r\nlake, with a height of 900 feet, and is noteworthy as being the lowest\r\nvolcano in the world. To those not accustomed to volcanoes, these great\r\nfire-spouting mountains, which are but prominent representatives of many\r\nlesser ones in the islands, seem to be an ever-present danger to the\r\ninhabitants; but the natives and those who live there manifest little or\r\nno fear of them. In fact, they rather pride themselves in their\r\npossession of such terrifying neighbors.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline view of the Philippine Archipelago of the present\r\nday. A new era has opened up in the history of that wonderful land with\r\nits liberation from the Spanish yoke. The dense ignorance and\r\nsemi-savage barbarities which exist there must not be expected to yield\r\ntoo rapidly to the touch of human kindness and brotherly love with which\r\nthe Christian world will now visit those semi-civilized and untamed\r\nchildren of nature. Nevertheless, western civilization and western\r\nprogress will undoubtedly work mighty changes in the lives of those\r\npeople, in the development of that country, during the first quarter of\r\nthe twentieth century, which ushers in the dawn of its freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF MANILA.\r\n\r\nIn all the annals of naval warfare there is no engagement, terminating\r\nin so signal a victory with so little damage to the victors, as that\r\nwhich made the name of George Dewey immortal on the memorable Sunday\r\nmorning of May 1, 1898, in Manila Bay. The world knows the story of that\r\nbattle, for it has been told hundreds of times in the thousands of\r\nnewspapers and magazines and scores of books throughout the civilized\r\nworld. But few, perhaps, who peruse these pages have read the simple\r\ndetails of the fight as narrated by that most modest of men, Admiral\r\nDewey himself. We cannot better close this chapter on the Philippines\r\nthan by inserting Admiral Dewey's official report of the battle which\r\nwrested the Filipinos from Spanish tyranny and placed nearly ten\r\nmillions of oppressed people under the protecting care of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG MAN OF THE UPPER CLASS.\r\n\r\nWhite duck or crash trousers and a silk or pina shirt make a fashionable\r\nsuit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGUINALDO AT THE AGE OF 22.\r\n\r\nDressed in fine pina cloth shirt.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOING THE FAMILY WASH.\r\n\r\nThe glory of all Philippine women is their long and beautiful hair.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE WOMAN FRUIT SELLER.\r\n\r\nAnd customers, Manila.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL DEWEY'S STORY OF MANILA.\r\n\r\n   \"UNITED STATES FLAGSHIP OLYMPIA, CAVITE, May 4, 1898.\r\n\r\n   \"The squadron left Mirs Bay on April 27th, arrived off Bolinao on the\r\n   morning of April 30th, and, finding no vessels there, proceeded down\r\n   the coast and arrived off the entrance to Manila Bay on the same\r\n   afternoon. The Boston and the Concord were sent to reconnoitre Port\r\n   Subic. A thorough search was made of the port by the Boston and the\r\n   Concord, but the Spanish fleet was not found. Entered the south\r\n   channel at 11:30 P.M., steaming in column at eight knots. After half\r\n   the squadron had passed, a battery on the south side of the channel\r\n   opened fire, none of the shots taking effect. The Boston and\r\n   McCulloch returned the fire. The squadron proceeded across the bay at\r\n   slow speed and arrived off Manila at daybreak, and was fired upon at\r\n   5:15 A.M. by three batteries at Manila and two near Cavite, and by\r\n   the Spanish fleet anchored in an approximately east and west line\r\n   across the mouth of Bakor Bay, with their left in shoal water in\r\n   Canacao Bay.\r\n\r\n   \"The squadron then proceeded to the attack, the flagship Olympia,\r\n   under my personal direction, leading, followed at a distance by the\r\n   Baltimore, Raleigh, Petrel, Concord, and Boston in the order named,\r\n   which formation was maintained throughout the action. The squadron\r\n   opened fire at 5:41 A.M. While advancing to the attack two mines were\r\n   exploded ahead of the flagship, too far to be effective. The squadron\r\n   maintained a continuous and precise fire at ranges varying from 5,000\r\n   to 2,000 yards, countermarching in a line approximately parallel to\r\n   that of the Spanish fleet. The enemy's fire was vigorous, but\r\n   generally ineffective. Early in the engagement two launches put out\r\n   toward the Olympia with the apparent intention of using torpedoes.\r\n   One was sunk and the other disabled by our fire and beached before\r\n   they were able to fire their torpedoes.\r\n\r\n   \"At seven A.M. the Spanish flagship Reina Cristina made a desperate\r\n   attempt to leave the line and come out to engage at short range, but\r\n   was received with such a galling fire, the entire battery of the\r\n   Olympia being concentrated upon her, that she was barely able to\r\n   return to the shelter of the point. The fires started in her by our\r\n   shells at the time were not extinguished until she sank. The three\r\n   batteries at Manila had kept up a continuous fire from the beginning\r\n   of the engagement, which fire was not returned by my squadron. The\r\n   first of these batteries was situated on the south mole-head at the\r\n   entrance of the Pasig River, the second on the south position of the\r\n   walled city of Manila, and the third at Molate, about one-half mile\r\n   further south. At this point I sent a message to the Governor-General\r\n   to the effect that if the batteries did not cease firing the city\r\n   would be shelled. This had the effect of silencing them.\r\n\r\n   \"At 7:35 A.M. I ceased firing and withdrew the squadron for\r\n   breakfast. At 11:16 I returned to the attack. By this time the\r\n   Spanish flagship and almost all the Spanish fleet were in flames. At\r\n   12:30 the squadron ceased firing, the batteries being silenced and\r\n   the ships sunk, burned, and deserted.\r\n\r\n   \"At 12:40 the squadron returned and anchored off Manila, the Petrel\r\n   being left behind to complete the destruction of the smaller\r\n   gunboats, which were behind the point of Cavite. This duty was\r\n   performed by Commander E.P. Wood in the most expeditious and complete\r\n   manner possible. The Spanish lost the following vessels: Sunk, Reina\r\n   Cristina, Castilla, Don Antonio de Ulloa; burned, Don Juan de\r\n   Austria, Isla de Luzon, Isla de Cuba, General Lezo, Marquia del\r\n   Duero, El Correo, Velasco, and Isla de Mindanao (transport);\r\n   captured, Rapido and Hercules (tugs), and several small launches.\r\n\r\n   \"I am unable to obtain complete accounts of the enemy's killed and\r\n   wounded, but believe their losses to be very heavy. The Reina\r\n   Cristina alone had 150 killed, including the captain, and ninety\r\n   wounded. I am happy to report that the damage done to the squadron\r\n   under my command was inconsiderable. There were none killed and only\r\n   seven men in the squadron were slightly wounded. Several of the\r\n   vessels were struck and even penetrated, but the damage was of the\r\n   slightest, and the squadron is in as good condition now as before the\r\n   battle.\r\n\r\n   \"I beg to state to the department that I doubt if any\r\n   commander-in-chief was ever served by more loyal, efficient, and\r\n   gallant-captains than those of the squadron now under my command.\r\n   Captain Frank Wildes, commanding the Boston, volunteered to remain in\r\n   command of his vessel, although his relief arrived before leaving\r\n   Hong Kong. Assistant Surgeon Kindelberger, of the Olympia, and Gunner\r\n   J.C. Evans, of the Boston, also volunteered to remain, after orders\r\n   detaching them had arrived. The conduct of my personal staff was\r\n   excellent. Commander B.P. Lamberton, chief of staff, was a volunteer\r\n   for that position, and gave me most efficient aid. Lieutenant Brumby,\r\n   Flag Lieutenant, and Ensign E.P. Scott, aide, performed their duties\r\n   as signal officers in a highly creditable manner; Caldwell, Flag\r\n   Secretary, volunteered for and was assigned to a subdivision of the\r\n   five-inch battery. Mr. J.L. Stickney, formerly an officer in the\r\n   United States Navy, and now correspondent for the New York _Herald_,\r\n   volunteered for duty as my aide, and rendered valuable service. I\r\n   desire especially to mention the coolness of Lieutenant C.G. Calkins,\r\n   the navigator of the Olympia, who came under my personal observation,\r\n   being on the bridge with me throughout the entire action, and giving\r\n   the ranges to the guns with an accuracy that was proven by the\r\n   excellence of the firing.\r\n\r\n   \"On May 2d, the day following the engagement, the squadron again went\r\n   to Cavite, where it remains. On the 3d the military forces evacuated\r\n   the Cavite arsenal, which was taken possession of by a landing party.\r\n   On the same day the Raleigh and the Baltimore secured the surrender\r\n   of the batteries on Corregidor Island, paroling the garrison and\r\n   destroying the guns. On the morning of May 4th, the transport Manila,\r\n   which had been aground in Bakor Bay, was towed off and made a prize.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOUTH OF THE PASIG RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe city of Old Manila is surrounded by water. On the west is the sea,\r\nto the north is the Pasig River, while moats, connected with the river\r\nby sluices, flank the other two sides. All the principal warehouses of\r\nthe city are on the Pasig, and ships deliver and receive their cargoes\r\ndirect, without the necessity of cartage.]\r\n\r\nOUR NEW POSSESSIONS (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\nTHE LADRONE, OR MARIANA ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIt was a welcome sight to Magellan and his crew when, one day in March,\r\nnearly 400 years ago, they beheld the verdant and beautifully sloping\r\nhills of the Ladrone Islands. Eighteen weary months before they had\r\nsailed from the coast of Spain, and all that time, first to the\r\nsouthwest and then to the northwest, they had followed the setting sun.\r\nTheirs were the first vessels manned by white men that had ever plowed\r\nthe trackless Pacific; and this was the first land ever seen by white\r\nmen within that unknown ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was a pitiable crew on those three small, weather-beaten ships, who\r\ndrew, that March morning, toward the coast of the present island of\r\nGuam, which is now a possession of the United States. Hunger and thirst\r\nhad driven them to the verge of madness. They had eaten even the leather\r\nthongs from their sail fastenings, and only a small mug of water per day\r\nwas the portion of drink for a man. \"Land! Land!!\" It was a glad cry\r\nfrom the watch aloft. There were palm trees, cocoanuts, green grass,\r\ntropical fruits, an abundance of fresh water, and--though naked--a\r\ncurious and friendly people. No wonder Magellan paused to rest himself\r\nand his sailors.\r\n\r\nThose little islands have never been of much value, and never can be.\r\nSeventeen of them stretching in a row about six hundred miles from north\r\nto south, and their total area, including their islets and reefs, is\r\nvariously estimated at from 400 to 560 square miles. Hence, there is but\r\nabout one-fourth more territory on the whole seventeen islands combined\r\nthan is included within the corporate limits of the city of Greater New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nA broad channel divides the Ladrones into two groups. The northern group\r\nconsists of ten islets, without inhabitants; the southern group has\r\nseven islands, four of which are inhabited. The largest island,\r\n_Guahan_, known to us as _Guam_, ceded to us by Spain, was taken by our\r\nwarship Charleston on July 4, 1898. This island contains the only town\r\nin the colony. Its full Spanish name is _San Ignacio de Agana_. It is\r\nthe capital of the archipelago, and contains more than half of the whole\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\nWhen first visited by Europeans, the archipelago contained from 40,000\r\nto 60,000 souls, represented by two distinct classes, the nobles and the\r\npeople, between whom marriage, and even contact, were forbidden. But the\r\nSpanish conquest soon ended this distinction by reducing all alike to\r\nservitude. For a long time after Spanish occupation, the natives\r\ncomplained and finally rebelled against the oppressive measures of their\r\nrulers; but by the end of the seventeenth century they ceased their\r\nresistance, and it was found by a census that fully half of them had\r\nperished or escaped in their canoes to the Caroline Islands, and that\r\ntwo-thirds of their one hundred and eighty villages had fallen to ruins.\r\nThen came an epidemic which swept away nearly all the natives of Guam;\r\nand the island of Tinian (one of the group) was depopulated and its\r\ninhabitants brought to Guam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE HOUSE AND PALMS, LADRONE ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the new arrivals soon died. In the year 1760, a census showed\r\na total of only 1,654 inhabitants left in all the islands, and the\r\nSpaniards repopulated them by bringing Tagals from the Philippines.\r\nThese, mixed with the remaining natives and Spaniards, have steadily\r\nincreased. The population of the islands in 1899 was estimated at about\r\n9,000. The people are generally lacking in energy, loose in morals, and\r\nmiserably poor. Their education has been seriously neglected. Their\r\nreligion is Catholic, no Protestant missions having been encouraged--we\r\nmight say, not allowed--there or in the Philippines or the Carolines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY, CLIMATE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the northern group are mountainous, the altitudes\r\nreaching from 2,600 to 2,700 feet. There are evidences of volcanoes all\r\nover the archipelago, and some mountains contain small craters and cones\r\nnot yet extinct. The climate of the Ladrones, though humid, is\r\nsalubrious, and the heat, being tempered by the trade winds, is milder\r\nthan in the Philippines. The yearly average temperature of Guam is 81 deg.\r\nStreams are everywhere copious--though the clearing of the land has\r\ndiminished their size of late years. The original flora consists\r\ngenerally of Asiatic plants, but much has been introduced from the\r\nPhilippines and other sources.\r\n\r\nCocoanuts, palms, the bread tree, and tropical trees and plants\r\ngenerally, thrive. The large fruit bat which abounds in the Philippines\r\nis indigenous to the Ladrones, and, despite its objectionable odor, is a\r\nprincipal article of food. Swine and oxen are allowed to run wild, and\r\nare hunted when needed. There are only a few species of birds; even\r\ninsects are rare; and the reptiles are represented by several kinds of\r\nlizards and a single species of serpent. No domestic animals were known\r\nin the islands until introduced by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States steamship Charleston opened fire on the little\r\ncity of Agana, July 4, 1898, the people had not heard of the war, and\r\nthe governor said he thought \"the noble Americans were saluting\" him,\r\nand was \"deeply humiliated because he had no powder to return their\r\nsalute.\" It was an easy, bloodless victory. The governor and his\r\nsoldiers were carried to Manila as prisoners, and an American garrison\r\nof a few men left to take charge of this new American territory in the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThus at the close of the nineteenth century, the Greater United States\r\nassumes its appointed place among the foremost nations of the world, and\r\nstands on the threshold of achievements whose grandeur no man dare\r\nattempt to prophesy. We pause, awed, grateful, and profoundly impressed,\r\nwhen we recall the mighty events, the amazing progress, and the\r\nwonderful advancements in discovery, science, art, literature, and all\r\nthat tends to the good of mankind that are certain to give the twentieth\r\ncentury a pre-eminence above all the years that have gone before.\r\n\r\nThe new era of our country has opened. The United States enters on the\r\nfirst stage of the transformation from an isolated commonwealth into an\r\noutreaching power with dependencies in both hemispheres. We can no\r\nlonger hold an attitude of aloofness from the rest of the world. With\r\nvulnerable points in our outlying possessions, we must make ready to\r\ndefend them not only by force of arms but by diplomatic skill.\r\nEntangling alliances as heretofore will be avoided, and the conditions,\r\ncomplications, and policies of foreign powers must in the future possess\r\na practical importance for us.\r\n\r\nThe original thirteen States have expanded into forty-five, embracing\r\nthe vast area between the two oceans and extending from the British\r\npossessions to the Gulf of Mexico. To them has now been added our\r\ncolonial territory, so vast in extent that, like the British Empire, the\r\nsun never sets on our dominions. Where a hundred years ago were only a\r\nfew scattered villages and towns, imperial cities now raise their heads.\r\nThousands of square miles of forest and solitude have given place to\r\ncultivated farms, to factories, and workshops that hum with the wheels\r\nof industry. The Patent Office issues 40,000 patents each year. We have\r\nthree cities with more than a million population apiece, and twenty-five\r\nwith a population ranging from a hundred thousand to half a million.\r\nGreater New York is the second city in the world, and, if its present\r\nrate of growth continues, it will surpass London before the middle of\r\nthe coming century. Our population has grown from 3,000,000 at the close\r\nof the Revolution to 75,000,000. When Andrew Jackson became President\r\nthere was not a mile of railroad in the United States. To-day our\r\nmileage exceeds that of all the countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa\r\ncombined, and the employes, connected directly or indirectly with\r\nrailroads in the United States, number almost a million persons. The\r\nhalf-dozen crude newspapers of the Revolution have expanded into more\r\nthan 20,000, whose daily news is gathered from every quarter of the\r\nglobe. The total yearly issue is more than three billions.\r\n\r\nNo country can approach the advancements we have made in invention, in\r\ndiscovery, in science, in art, in education and in all the civilizing\r\nagencies of mankind. Volumes would be required to name our achievements\r\nin these lines. Our material property has been or is equally wonderful.\r\nWhen the Civil War closed, our public debt was nearly $3,000,000,000. On\r\nDecember 1, 1898, it was $1,036,000,000. Most of the leading nations\r\nhave great debts, but the United States is the only one which is\r\nsteadily decreasing its debt and at the same time enormously increasing\r\nits resources. The debt of Great Britain is now about $87 per capita,\r\nthat of France $115, of Holland $100, of Italy $75, and of the United\r\nStates less than $15, with the security increasing all the time.\r\n\r\nLet the thoughtful reader note these striking facts. European nations\r\ngenerally, and some South American nations also, have been compelled to\r\nresort to various methods of taxation to supply the sums needed for\r\nordinary governmental expenses, to meet the interest on the existing\r\ndebt, to provide resources for new expenditures, buildings, armament,\r\nsubsidies, and various public works. England has an income tax and many\r\nstamp taxes, a house tax, and collects some 20 per cent. of its revenue\r\nfrom direct taxation. France has a tobacco monopoly, registration taxes,\r\nstamp taxes, tax on windows, and innumerable local taxes, one being the\r\noctroi, or tax on goods entering cities. In addition to an income tax,\r\nand many stamp taxes, Austria derives a good deal of its public revenue\r\nfrom lotteries. Italy goes still further with her tobacco monopoly,\r\nhouse tax, income tax, salt tax, octroi duties, stamp taxes, and heavy\r\nlegacy and registration taxes. In the United States, however, the public\r\nrevenues have been provided for and all public expenses met, and the\r\nnational debt reduced beside, without recourse to any direct taxation.\r\nWe have no government monopolies, and the Treasury maintains a healthful\r\ncondition from the receipts of customs and internal revenue payments.\r\n\r\nThus with the spirit of fraternity between all sections of the Union\r\nstronger than ever before, with the spirit of patriotism more deeply\r\nimbedded and all-pervading, with our moral, educational, and material\r\nprosperity and progress greater than any time in our past history, and\r\nnever equaled by any nation, since the annals of mankind began--we face\r\nthe future, bravely resolved to meet all requirements, responsibilities,\r\nand duties as become men whose motto is\r\n\r\n\r\nIN GOD IS OUR TRUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The End._",
