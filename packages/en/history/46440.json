It confirmed the hypothesis of a circumambient ocean, first\r\nput forward by Hecataeus, but rejected by Ptolemy and his numerous\r\nfollowers; and, at the same time diverted into a new channel the\r\nprofitable spice trade with the East which for ages had passed through\r\nSyria and Alexandria. In consequence of this diversion Venice lost her\r\nmonopoly, and Lisbon became for a time the great spice-market of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut Portugal was a small country whose resources were hardly even equal\r\nto the task of waging the continuous wars with the Moors in which\r\nshe had so unwisely been engaged for generations past. And when, in\r\naddition to her African forces, she was called upon to maintain great\r\nfleets in the distant East, in order to enforce her monopoly of the\r\nspice trade, at first in the face only of the Moors, and afterwards in\r\nthat of powerful European rivals, her resources speedily came to an\r\nend, and she found herself exhausted and helpless. It may well be asked\r\nwhether Portugal would not be happier now, and richer, too, had she\r\nnever had the opportunity of dwelling upon these ancient glories; had\r\nthe wealth of the Indies never been poured into her lap, only to breed\r\ncorruption; and had her strength not been wasted in a struggle to which\r\nshe was materially unequal, and which ended in exhaustion and ruin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vasco da Gama.\r\n\r\n(_From a Contemporary Medallion in the Cloister of Belem._)]\r\n\r\nPortugal, however, notwithstanding the sad ending of her vast Eastern\r\nenterprises, is still justly proud of the achievements of her “great”\r\nVasco da Gama, and boldly places him by the side of Magelhães and\r\nChristopher Columbus, as one of a noble triad which occupies the\r\nforemost rank among the great navigators of an Age of Great Discoveries.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama was born, about 1460,[1] at Sines, of which coast-town\r\nhis father, Estevão, was alcaidemór. He was the youngest of three\r\nbrothers. Genealogists trace back his pedigree to a valiant soldier,\r\nAlvaro Annes da Gama, who resided at Olivença in 1280, and greatly\r\ndistinguished himself in the wars with the Moors. The Gamas could thus\r\nboast of gentle blood, though they neither belonged to the aristocracy\r\nof Portugal, nor were they possessed of much worldly wealth.\r\n\r\nWe know next to nothing of Vasco da Gama’s youth. When King João,\r\nafter the return of Bartholomeu Dias, decided to fit out an armada to\r\ncomplete the discovery of an ocean highway to India, he selected Vasco\r\nda Gama as its captain-major, and this choice of the King was confirmed\r\nby his successor, D. Manuel.[2] Such an appointment would not have\r\nbeen made had not Vasco da Gama already been known as a man of energy,\r\ncapacity and competent knowledge. We ought therefore not be surprised\r\nif Garcia de Resende, in his _Chronicle of D. João II_ (c. 146), tells\r\nus that he was a man whom the King trusted, as he had already served\r\nin his fleets and in maritime affairs, and whom he had consequently\r\ncharged, in 1492, with the task of seizing the French vessels lying in\r\nthe ports of Algarve, in reprisal for the capture by a French pirate of\r\na Portuguese caravel returning from S. Jorge da Mina with gold.[3]\r\n\r\nCastanheda (I, c. 2) speaks of Vasco as having done good service in\r\nthe time of King João II, and as being experienced in the affairs of\r\nthe sea. Mariz (_Dial._, iv, c. 14; v, c. 1) calls him a young man\r\n(_mancebo_), high-spirited and indefatigable, who had such a thorough\r\nknowledge of navigation (_arte maritima_) that he would have been able\r\nto hold his own with the most experienced pilots of Europe. We know,\r\nmoreover, from Barros and Goes that he landed at S. Helena Bay with\r\nhis pilots in order to determine the latitude. These extracts show,\r\nat all events, that Vasco da Gama was not a mere landsman; nor is it\r\nlikely that the command of an expedition, the one object of which was\r\ndiscovery, and not trade or war, would have been entrusted to such an\r\none.\r\n\r\nHe was, moreover, well qualified for his post in other respects. His\r\nindomitable firmness made him shrink from no obstacle which opposed\r\nitself to the success of his expedition; and notwithstanding the\r\nunheard-of length of the voyage and the hardships endured, he retained\r\nthe confidence of his men to the very last.\r\n\r\nThe question whether Da Gama can fairly be ranked with Columbus and\r\nMagelhães, has frequently been discussed.\r\n\r\nThe first place among these three undoubtedly belongs to Magelhães, the\r\nrenegade Portuguese, who first guided a ship across the wide expanse\r\nof the Pacific. The second place is almost universally accorded to\r\nColumbus, whose unconscious discovery of a new world, fit to become the\r\nsecond home of the European races, was immensely more far-reaching in\r\nits consequences than the discovery of an ocean highway to India, now\r\nlargely discarded in favour of the shorter route across the isthmus of\r\nSuez.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained, in support of the claims of Columbus, that he was\r\nthe originator of the scheme the success of which covered him with\r\neverlasting glory, whilst Vasco da Gama simply obeyed the behests of\r\nhis King, when he took the lead of an expedition which was to crown the\r\nefforts made by little Portugal for generations past.\r\n\r\nThere is much truth in this contention. The scheme of reaching the\r\nEast by a westward course across the Atlantic had no doubt been\r\nentertained in Portugal in the reign of Affonso the African [1438-81].\r\nFernão Martinz, the Royal Chaplain, had discussed its prospects with\r\nPaolo Toscanelli, when in Italy, and had been instructed to apply for\r\nfurther particulars to the Florentine physician, in response to which\r\nhe had received the famous letter of June 25th, 1474, and the chart\r\nwhich accompanied it. But practically nothing was done, except that an\r\nadventurer or two[4] were authorised to seek for the islands supposed\r\nto lie to the west of the Azores. Prince Henry the Navigator would\r\nperhaps have acted upon such a suggestion, had he been still alive,\r\nbut the King’s resources were devoted to Africa, or wasted in two\r\ndisastrous wars with Spain.\r\n\r\nColumbus, on the other hand, made the discarded scheme his own; he,\r\ntoo, applied to Toscanelli for counsel,[5] and found confirmation of\r\nthat physician’s erroneous hypothesis as to the small breadth of the\r\nAtlantic by studying the _Imago Mundi_ of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly,\r\nand other writings. Nor did he rest until he found in Queen Isabella\r\nthe Catholic a patron who enabled him to put his theories to the test\r\nof practical experience. It was his good fortune that Providence had\r\nplaced the new world as a barrier between him and Marco Polo’s Cipangu\r\n(Japan), which was his goal, or he might never have returned to claim\r\nthe reward of his success.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of D. João II, in 1481, the discovery of Africa was\r\nresumed with renewed vigour, and the councillors of that King acted\r\nwisely when they advised him to decline the offers of Columbus,[6] for\r\nthe resources of Portugal were quite unequal to pursuing at one and the\r\nsame time a search for a western route and continuing the efforts for\r\nopening a practical route around the southern extremity of Africa. And\r\nthus it happened that Columbus “discovered a new world for Castile and\r\nLeon”, and not for Portugal.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we come to consider the physical difficulties which\r\nhad to be overcome by these great navigators in the accomplishment of\r\ntheir purpose, the greater credit must undoubtedly be awarded to Vasco\r\nda Gama. Columbus, trusting as implicitly to the chart and sailing\r\ndirections of Toscanelli as did Vasco da Gama to those of Dias, and,\r\nperhaps, of Pero de Covilhão, shaped a course westward of Gomera; and,\r\nhaving sailed in that direction for thirty-six days, and for a distance\r\nof 2,600 miles, made his first landfall at Guanahani, being favoured\r\nall the while by the prevailing easterly winds. The task which Vasco\r\nda Gama undertook was far more difficult of accomplishment. Instead\r\nof creeping along the coast, as had been done by his predecessors,\r\nhe conceived the bold idea of shaping a course which would take him\r\ndirect through the mid-Atlantic from the Cape Verde Islands to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. The direct distance to be covered was 3,770 miles, but\r\nthe physical obstacles presented by winds and currents could only be\r\novercome by taking a circuitous course, and thus it happened that he\r\nspent ninety-three days at sea before he made his first landfall to the\r\nnorth of the bay of St. Helena. This first passage across the southern\r\nAtlantic is one of the great achievements recorded in the annals of\r\nmaritime exploration.\r\n\r\nOnce beyond the Cape, Vasco had to struggle against the Agulhas\r\ncurrent, which had baffled Bartholomeu Dias, and against the current of\r\nMozambique; and it was only after he had secured a trustworthy pilot at\r\nMelinde that the difficulties of the outward voyage can be said to have\r\nbeen overcome.\r\n\r\nIn one other respect Vasco da Gama, or, perhaps, we ought to say his\r\npilots, proved themselves the superiors of Columbus, namely, in the\r\naccuracy of the charts of their discoveries which they brought home\r\nto Portugal. Accepting the Cantino Chart[7] as a fair embodiment of\r\nthe work done by this expedition, we find that the greatest error\r\nin latitude amounts to 1° 40´. The errors of Columbus were far more\r\nconsiderable. In three places of his Journal the latitude of the north\r\ncoast of Cuba is stated to be 42° by actual observation; and that this\r\nis no clerical error, thrice repeated in three different places, seems\r\nto be proved by the evidence of the charts. On that of Juan de la Cosa,\r\nfor instance, Cuba is made to extend to lat. 35° N. (instead of 23°\r\n10´), and even on the rough sketch drawn by Bartolomeo Columbus after\r\nthe return from the Fourth Voyage, Jamaica and Puerto Rico (Spagnola)\r\nare placed 6° too far to the north.[8]\r\n\r\nVerily, the Portuguese of those days were superior as navigators to\r\ntheir Spanish rivals and the Italians.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosterity is fortunate in possessing a very full abstract of the\r\nJournal which Columbus kept during his first voyage to the West\r\nIndies.[9] No such trustworthy record is available in the case of Vasco\r\nda Gama, whose original reports have disappeared. They were consulted,\r\nno doubt, by João de Barros and Damião de Goes; but these writers, much\r\nto our loss, dealt very briefly with all that refers to navigation.\r\nThe only available account written by a member of the expedition is\r\nthe _Roteiro_ or Journal, a translation of which fills the bulk of\r\nthis volume, and of which, later on, we shall speak at greater length.\r\nThe only other contemporary accounts, which we also reproduce, are at\r\nsecond-hand, and are contained in the letters written by King Manuel\r\nand Girolamo Sernigi immediately after the return of Vasco da Gama’s\r\nvessels from India.\r\n\r\nApart from these, our chief authorities regarding this voyage are still\r\nthe _Decades_ of João de Barros and the _Chronicle_ of King Manuel, by\r\nDamião de Goes. Both these authors held official positions which gave\r\nthem access to the records preserved in the India House. Castanheda\r\nrelied almost wholly upon the _Roteiro_, but a few additional\r\nstatements of interest may be found in his pages.\r\n\r\nAs to the _Lendas_ of Gaspar Correa, we are unable to look upon his\r\naccount of Vasco da Gama’s first voyage as anything but a jumble of\r\ntruth and fiction,[10] notwithstanding that he claims to have made use\r\nof the diary of a priest, Figueiro, who is stated to have sailed in\r\nVasco’s fleet. Correa’s long residence in India—from 1514 to the time\r\nof his death—must have proved an advantage when relating events which\r\ncame under his personal observation, but it also precluded him from\r\nconsulting the documents placed on record in the Archives of Lisbon.\r\nThis much is certain: that whoever accepts Correa as his guide must\r\nreject the almost unanimous evidence of other writers of authority who\r\nhave dealt with this important voyage.[11]\r\n\r\nA few additional facts may be gleaned from Faria y Sousa’s _Asia\r\nPortuguesa_, from Duarte Pacheco Pereira and Antonio Galvão; but in the\r\nmain we are dependent upon the _Roteiro_, for recent searches[12] in\r\nthe _Torre do Tombo_ have yielded absolutely nothing, so far as we are\r\naware, which throws additional light upon Da Gama’s First Voyage, with\r\nwhich alone we are concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd now we shall proceed to give an account of the _Roteiro_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Manuscript of the “Roteiro”._\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of the manuscript of this Journal, we entrust\r\nourselves to the guidance of Professors Kopke and Antonio da Costa\r\nPaiva, the two gentlemen who first published it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signature of Fernam Lopes de Castanheda]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Mark]\r\n\r\nThat is:—\r\n\r\n  “Em Nome de Ds Amem// Na era de mill iiij LR vij\r\n   mamdou Ellrey Dom manuell o primo desde nome em portugall/\r\n        a descobrir/ quat\r\n  navios/ os quaes hiam em busca da especiaria/ dos quaees na\r\n  vios hia por capitam moor Vco da Gama e dos outros duũ\r\n  delles Paullo da Gama seu jrmaoo e doutro njcollao Coelho”.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript originally belonged to the famous Convent of Santa Cruz\r\nat Coimbra, whence it was transferred, together with other precious\r\nMSS., to the public library of Oporto.\r\n\r\nIt is not an autograph, for on fol. 64 (p. 77 of this translation),\r\nwhere the author has left a blank, the copyist, to guard against his\r\nbeing supposed to have been careless in his task, has added these\r\nwords: “The author has omitted to tell us how these weapons were\r\nmade”. This copy, however, was taken in the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as may be seen from the style of the writing as exhibited in\r\nthe facsimile of the first paragraph of the work, shown on preceding\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe MS. is in folio, and is rudely bound up in a sheet of parchment,\r\ntorn out of some book of ecclesiastical offices. The ink is a little\r\nfaded, but the writing is still perfectly legible. The paper is of\r\nordinary strength, and of rather a dark tint; the manufacturer’s water\r\nmark is shown in the above facsimile. Blank leaves of more modern make,\r\nand having a different water-mark, have been inserted at the front and\r\nback, and the first of these leaves contains the following inscription\r\nin a modern hand, which is still legible, although pains have been\r\ntaken to erase it:—\r\n\r\n  “Pertinet ad usum fratris Theotonii de Sancto\r\n     G ... Canonici Regularis in Cenobio\r\n               Scte Crucis”.\r\n\r\nImmediately below this we read:—\r\n\r\n  “Dô Theotonio”,\r\n\r\nand near the bottom of the page, in a modern hand, probably that of\r\none of the librarians of the convent:—\r\n\r\n  “Descobrimento da India por D. Vasco\r\n            da Gamma”.\r\n\r\nProf. Kopke suggests[13] that the copyist of this valuable MS. was\r\nthe famous historian Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, who was Apparitor\r\nand Keeper of the Archives in the University of Coimbra, and was\r\nengaged there during twenty years, much to the injury of his health\r\nand private fortune, in collecting the materials for his _Historia do\r\nDescobrimento e Conquista da India_. In support of this assumption\r\nhe publishes a signature (see the facsimile on page xxii) taken from\r\na copy of the first book of Castanheda’s history, published in 1551.\r\nBut A. Herculano,[14] whilst admitting this signature to be genuine,\r\npoints out that the cursive characters of the MS. are of a type\r\nexceedingly common during the first half of the sixteenth century, and\r\nthat it would consequently not be safe to attribute it to any writer\r\nin particular. Until, therefore, further evidence is forthcoming, we\r\ncannot accept the Professor’s theory that we are indebted for this copy\r\nto Castanheda; though, as we have already said, there can be no doubt\r\nthat in writing his account of the First Voyage of Vasco da Gama he\r\ndepended almost exclusively for his facts upon the anonymous author of\r\nthis _Roteiro_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Author of the “Roteiro”._\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, as suggested by Prof. Kopke, that the title by\r\nwhich the _Roteiro_ was known at the convent of Santa Cruz misled\r\ncertain bibliographers into a belief that Vasco da Gama himself had\r\nwritten this account of his voyage.\r\n\r\nThus Nicoláo Antonio, in his _Bibliotheca Hispana Veta_ (1672), lib.\r\n10, c. 15, § 543, says:—\r\n\r\n  “Vascus da Gama ... dedit reversus Emanueli suo Regi populari\r\n  Portugaliæ idiomate navigationis suae ad Indiam anno MCDXCVII\r\n  relationem, quae lucem vidit.”\r\n\r\nThe words “quae lucem vidit” need not, however, be understood as\r\nconveying the meaning that this narrative was actually printed and\r\npublished, for the same author, in his _Bibliotheca Hispana Nova_,\r\nmakes use of the same equivocal expression when describing another\r\nvoyage to India, expressly stated by him to be still in MS.\r\n\r\nMoreri, in his _Dictionnaire_ (1732), quoting as his authority a\r\n_Bibliotheca Portuguesa_ in MS., which he had from “a man of judgment\r\nand of vast erudition”, states that Vasco da Gama is said to have\r\npublished an account of his first voyage to India, but that no copy of\r\nit had up till then been discovered.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Barbosa Machado, the author of the standard _Bibliotheca\r\nLusitana_ (t. iii, p. 775), 1752, accepting Nicoláo Antonio as his\r\nauthority, says that Vasco da Gama “wrote an account of the voyage\r\nwhich he made to India in 1497”.[15]\r\n\r\nWe are quite safe in assuming that no such a narrative has ever been\r\npublished, although it is equally certain that Vasco da Gama furnished\r\nofficial reports of his proceedings, which were still available when\r\nJoão de Barros wrote his _Decades_, but are so no longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one has yet succeeded in discovering the author of the _Roteiro_.\r\nProf. Kopke attempts to arrive at the name by a process of elimination,\r\nand in doing so starts with several assumptions which we cannot accept.\r\nFirst of all he assumes that Castanheda must have known the writer of\r\nthe MS. of which he made such excellent use in writing his history.\r\nBut Castanheda only became acquainted with this MS. after 1530, when\r\nhe took up his residence at Coimbra on his return from India, that\r\nis, more than thirty years after it had been written. Of course, the\r\nauthor might then have been still alive, notwithstanding the lapse of\r\nyears; but had this been the case, and had Castanheda been personally\r\nacquainted with him, he would surely have obtained from him an account\r\nof the termination of the voyage, instead of abruptly breaking off in\r\nthe same way as the _Roteiro_ does, with the arrival of the fleet at\r\nthe shoals of the Rio Grande (see p. 93), adding that he had been\r\nunable to ascertain the particulars of the further voyage of the\r\ncaptain-major, and only knew that Coelho arrived at Cascaes on July\r\n10th, 1499.[16] It is probable, moreover, that if Castanheda had known\r\nthe name of the author to whom he was so greatly indebted, he would\r\nhave mentioned it in his book. Prof. Kopke assumes further that the\r\nwriter was a common sailor or soldier, and most probably the former:\r\nfirst, because he frequently makes use of the expression “nós outros”\r\n(we others) as if to draw a distinction between the officers of the\r\nships and the class to which he himself belonged; and, secondly,\r\nbecause “the style of his narrative would seem to point to his humble\r\ncondition”. We can admit neither of these conclusions. The author by\r\nno means uses the expression “we others” in the restricted sense in\r\nwhich Prof. Kopke understands it. In proof of this we may refer to\r\nsuch sentences as are to be found at pp. 57 and 61:—“When the King\r\nbeckoned to the captain he looked at us others”; “as to us others, we\r\ndiverted ourselves”—the “others”, in both these cases, including the\r\nthirteen men who attended Vasco da Gama to Calecut, and among whom were\r\nthe three pursers, the captain-major’s secretary, and others who may\r\nnot have been “persons of distinction” but who nevertheless cannot be\r\nclassed with “common soldiers or sailors”. As to the literary style of\r\nthe Journal, we may at once admit that its author cannot take rank with\r\nBarros, Castanheda or Correa, but this by no means proves him to have\r\nbeen an uncultured man, or of “humble condition.” His spelling may not\r\nhave been quite in accordance with the somewhat loose rules followed\r\nin the fifteenth century, but his narrative is straightforward and to\r\nthe point, and shows that he was a man of judgment perfectly able to\r\ngive an intelligent account of the many novel facts which came under\r\nhis observation. If he looked upon the Hindus as fellow-Christians, he\r\nshared that opinion with the other members of the expedition, including\r\nits chief. It only needs a perusal of such a collection of letters,\r\nreports, and narratives as is to be found in _Alguns documentos do\r\nArchivo nacional_ (Lisbon, 1892) to convince us that there were men\r\nholding high positions in those days whose literary abilities fell\r\nshort of those which can be claimed on behalf of our author. Moreover,\r\nit is not likely that access to the information required to enable\r\nhim to write a _Roteiro da Viagem_ would have been given to a “common\r\nsailor or soldier”, even if such a person had been bold enough to ask\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWe shall now follow Prof. Kopke in his “process of elimination”:—\r\n\r\n1. The author, in the course of his narrative, mentions a number of\r\npersons by name, and these we must eliminate forthwith. They are:\r\nVasco and Paulo da Gama, Nicolau Coelho (p. 22), Pero d’Alenquer (p.\r\n5), João de Coimbra (p. 30), Martin Affonso (pp. 12, 17), Sancho Mexia\r\n(p. 6), and Fernão Veloso (p. 7).\r\n\r\n2. We know further that the author served on board the _S.\r\nRaphael_.[17] This disposes of Gonçalo Alvares and Diogo Dias[18] of\r\nthe _S. Gabriel_; and of Gonçalo Nunes, Pero Escolar, and Alvaro de\r\nBraga, of the _Berrio_.\r\n\r\n3. The author mentions certain things as having been done by persons\r\nwhose names he does not give. The name of one of these is supplied by\r\nCastanheda and Barros. We thus learn from Barros that Fernão Martins\r\n“was the sailor mentioned by the author (p. 23) as being able to speak\r\nthe language of the Moors; and from Castanheda (I, p. 51) that he was\r\none of the two men sent with a message to the King of Calecut (p. 50).\r\nThe convict who was sent to Calecut on May 21st (p. 48) was João Nunez,\r\naccording to Correa. The author states (p. 64, line 18, and p. 65, last\r\nline) that the captain-major sent three men along the beach in search\r\nof the ships’ boats. According to Castanheda (I, pp. 71 and 72), one of\r\nthese men was Gonçalo Pires.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore strike out all these names from the list of possible\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\n4. Three members of the expedition are reported to have died during\r\nthe voyage, namely, Pedro de Covilhão, the priest; Pedro de Faria de\r\nFigueredo, and his brother Francisco, all of them mentioned by Faria y\r\nSousa alone.\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, there are four convicts whose names are given by Correa,\r\nnone of whom is likely to have been the author of the MS. The presence\r\nof some of these convicts is, moreover, very doubtful.\r\n\r\nWe have thus accounted for all the members of the expedition whose\r\nnames are known, with the exception of eight.\r\n\r\nFour of these—João de Sá, Alvaro Velho, João Palha and João de\r\nSetubal—are stated to have been among the thirteen who attended Vasco\r\nda Gama to Calecut (p. 51), and of these, João de Sá was clerk in the\r\n_S. Raphael_, the author’s ship. He certainly might have been the\r\nauthor. Prof. Kopke thinks not, first, because of the author’s supposed\r\nhumble position; secondly, because João de Sá, if we may credit an\r\nanecdote recorded by Castanheda (I, p. 57),[19] had his doubts about\r\nthe people of India being Christians, whilst the author unhesitatingly\r\naffirms them to be so. The only other person mentioned by Castanheda\r\nas having been connected with the expedition is Alvaro Velho, a\r\nsoldier, who, according to Prof. Kopke, may “fairly be looked upon as\r\nthe author of this Journal.” He admits, however, that this conclusion\r\nis acceptable only on the assumption that Castanheda knew the author: a\r\npurely gratuitous assumption, in our opinion.\r\n\r\nCastanheda only mentions six out of the thirteen who were present\r\nat Vasco da Gama’s audience of the Zamorin. Correa mentions two\r\nothers—João de Setubal and João Palha. Five remain thus to be accounted\r\nfor; and, although these may have included servants and trumpeters, not\r\nlikely to have troubled about keeping a journal, our author may have\r\nbeen among them. It will thus be seen that this process of elimination\r\nhas led to no result, and that we cannot even tell whether the author’s\r\nname occurs in any single account of this expedition. Comparing his\r\n“Journal” with the contents of Sernigi’s first letter, it almost seems\r\nas if he had been the person from whom the Florentine derived the bulk\r\nof his information. In that case his name may perhaps turn up some day\r\nin the Italian archives. If our choice were limited to Alvaro Velho and\r\nJoão de Sá, we should feel inclined to decide in favour of the latter.\r\n\r\nCorrea mentions three other persons as having been with Vasco da Gama:\r\nnamely, João Figueiro, whose diary he claims to have used, and who\r\ncannot therefore have been the author of a “Journal” the contents of\r\nwhich are so widely different; André Gonçalves and João d’Amoxeira.\r\nCamões adds a fourth name, that of Leonardo Ribeyra. This exhausts the\r\nmuster-roll, as far as the names are known to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Portuguese Editions of the “Roteiro”._[20]\r\n\r\nThe _Roteiro_ was printed for the first time in 1838. The editors,\r\nDiogo Kopke and Dr. Antonio da Costa Paiva, both teachers at the\r\n_Academia Polytechnica_ of Oporto, furnished it with an introduction,\r\nin which they give an account of the manuscript and discuss its\r\nauthorship, add sixty-nine notes, explanatory of the text, and append\r\nKing Manuel’s letters patent of January 10th, 1502 (see p. 230). The\r\nillustrations include a map, the facsimile of a page of the MS., a\r\nportrait, and an illustrated title-page of poor design. The book was\r\npublished by subscription. Three hundred and ninety-two copies were\r\nsubscribed for, including two hundred and thirty-seven by residents in\r\nOporto, among whom British wine-merchants figure prominently. Only five\r\ncopies went abroad, and three of these were subscribed for by Captain\r\nWashington, R.N., the Royal Geographical Society, and the Geographical\r\nSociety of Paris.\r\n\r\nA second edition appeared at Lisbon in 1861. Its editors, A.\r\nHerculano, the famous historian, and Baron do Castello de Paiva,\r\nclaim to have “got rid of those imperfections in the text, as also in\r\nthe notes of the first edition,[21] which must be attributed to the\r\ninexperience of the editors, and to their eagerness to bring before\r\nthe public so precious an historical document”. Their emendations,\r\nhowever, are not of a kind to justify this somewhat brutal reference to\r\nthe work done by their predecessors. They consist, in the main, of a\r\nmodernisation of the spelling, the introduction of a few “philological”\r\nnotes of no particular interest, and a short preface in which Correa’s\r\n_Lendas da India_ are spoken of in terms of eulogy. These _Lendas_\r\nthe editors consider to be “far superior in substance (_quanto á\r\nsubstancia_) to the _Decades_ of João de Barros, and to the exuberant\r\nbut evidently honest narrative of Castanheda.” After praising Correa\r\n“for depicting in firm contours and vivid colours” the human passions\r\nbrought into play by close companionship within the narrow limits of a\r\nship, they admit that as to “facts” “he is often vague, forgetful, or\r\nambiguous”. They conclude by saying that the author of the _Roteiro_\r\nand the chronicle-writers mutually complement each other, and jointly\r\nacquaint us with all the details of one of the great events in the\r\nhistory of modern nations.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The French Translations of the “Roteiro”._\r\n\r\nTwo have been published. The first of these, by M. Ferdinand Denis,\r\nwill be found in the third volume of Charton’s _Voyageurs Anciens et\r\nModernes_, Paris, 1855. It is based upon the first Portuguese edition,\r\nand ends with the arrival of the two vessels at the Rio Grande. The\r\nnotes by Professor Kopke are embodied in those of the translator, who\r\nhas added an introduction, giving a short but excellent biography of\r\nVasco da Gama, and a bibliography. The map of the original is retained,\r\nand there are twenty illustrations, including two portraits of Vasco\r\nda Gama, the one stated to be from Count Farrobo’s painting, as\r\npublished in the _Panorama_, the other from a Paris MS. of Barretto de\r\nRezende.[23]\r\n\r\nFor the second French translation[24] we are indebted to M. Arthur\r\nMorelet. It is from the second Portuguese edition, and not a word of\r\neither text or notes has been omitted. The translator has confined\r\nhimself to supplying a short introduction. The map is retained, but a\r\nfree rendering of Count Farrobo’s painting[25] has been substituted for\r\nthe poor portrait of Vasco da Gama in the original, and the portrait of\r\nKing Manuel has been omitted as being “flat, without relief and vigour,\r\nand wanting even in that unaffected simplicity which marks the works\r\nof that period.”[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The English Translation._\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Hakluyt Society published Lord Stanley of Alderley’s\r\ntranslation of the _Three Voyages of Vasco da Gama_, from the\r\n_Lendas_ of Gaspar Correa, with numerous foot-notes indicating those\r\ninstances in which Correa differs from Barros, Goes, Castanheda and\r\nother historians, as well as from the poetical version of this voyage\r\npresented in the _Lusiadas_ of Camões.\r\n\r\nIt was intended at the same time to bring out an English version of\r\nthe _Roteiro_, but no definite arrangements were made, and thus the\r\nmatter was left in abeyance until the present Editor revived the idea,\r\nand suggested that the volume proposed might prove acceptable as an\r\ninteresting though humble contribution to the literature of the Fourth\r\nCentenary of Vasco da Gama’s arrival in India, which Portugal is about\r\nto celebrate.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the _Roteiro_ itself is literal and complete. The\r\nnotes of the Portuguese editors have, however, been abridged, and only\r\nthe substance of what they say in their introductions has been retained.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Editor has added translations of the letters\r\nof King Manuel and Sernigi, and of three Portuguese accounts of the\r\nvoyage. He has, moreover, added Appendices, among which the one\r\ndealing with early maps will, he hopes, prove of some interest.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Editor fulfils an agreeable duty in acknowledging\r\nthe kindly help and advice extended to him by a number of gentlemen.\r\nTo Capt. E. J. de Carvalho e Vasconcellos and Senhor José Bastos, of\r\nLisbon, he is indebted for the fine portraits which ornament this\r\nedition; to Prof. Gallois for a tracing of the unpublished portion of\r\nCanerio’s chart; to Dr. M. C. Caputo for a photograph of the African\r\nportion of the Cantino chart; to Prof. Biagi for a copy of Sernigi’s\r\nletter in the _Biblioteca Riccardiana_; to Sir J. Kirk for several\r\nillustrations and important notes; to the late Rt. Rev. Dr. J. M.\r\nSpeechley, and the Rev. J. J. Jaus, of the Basel Missionary Society,\r\nfor notes on Calecut; and for help in minor matters to Dr. Garnett, of\r\nthe British Museum; Baron Hulot, Secretary of the Paris Geographical\r\nSociety; M. Marcel, of the _Bibliothèque Nationale_; Prof. Dalla\r\nVedova, of Rome; Prof. Berchet, of Venice; and Capt. B. B. da Silva, of\r\nLisbon.\r\n\r\nHis special thanks are due to three members of the Hakluyt Society,\r\nnamely, Sir Clements Markham, the President; Admiral Albert H. Markham,\r\nwho acted as the Editor’s nautical adviser; and Mr. William Foster, the\r\nSecretary, whose careful reading of the proofs kept this volume free\r\nfrom many a blunder.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _March, 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A CHART\r\n  illustrating the First Voyage of\r\n  VASCO DA GAMA\r\n  1497-99\r\n\r\n  HAKLUYT.

Amen!\r\n\r\nIn the year 1497 King Dom Manuel, the first of that name in Portugal,\r\ndespatched four vessels to make discoveries and go in search of spices.\r\nVasco da Gama was the captain-major of these vessels; Paulo da Gama,\r\nhis brother, commanded one of them, and Nicolau Coelho another.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Lisbon to the Cape Verde Islands._]\r\n\r\nWe left Restello[28] on Saturday, July 8, 1497. May God our Lord permit\r\nus to accomplish this voyage in his service. Amen!\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday [July 15] we sighted the Canaries, and in\r\nthe night passed to the lee of Lançarote. During the following night,\r\nat break of day [July 16] we made the Terra Alta, where we fished for\r\na couple of hours, and in the evening, at dusk, we were off the Rio do\r\nOuro.[29]\r\n\r\nThe fog[30] during the night grew so dense that Paulo da Gama lost\r\nsight of the captain-major, and when day broke [July 17] we saw neither\r\nhim nor the other vessels. We therefore made sail for the Cape Verde\r\nislands, as we had been instructed to do in case of becoming separated.\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday, [July 22], at break of day, we sighted the\r\nIlha do Sal,[31] and an hour afterwards discovered three vessels,\r\nwhich turned out to be the store-ship, and the vessels commanded by\r\nNicolau Coelho and Bartholameu Diz [Dias], the last of whom sailed in\r\nour company as far as the Mine.[32] They, too, had lost sight of the\r\ncaptain-major. Having joined company we pursued our route, but the wind\r\nfell, and we were becalmed until Wednesday [July 26]. At ten o’clock on\r\nthat day we sighted the captain-major, about five leagues ahead of us,\r\nand having got speech with him in the evening we gave expression to our\r\njoy by many times firing off our bombards[33] and sounding the trumpets.\r\n\r\nThe day after this, a Thursday [July 27], we arrived at the island\r\nof Samtiago [São Thiago],[34] and joyfully anchored in the bay of\r\nSanta Maria, where we took on board meat, water and wood, and did the\r\nmuch-needed repairs to our yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Across the Southern Atlantic._]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, August 3, we left in an easterly direction. On August\r\n18,[35] when about 200 leagues from Samtiaguo, going south, the\r\ncaptain-major’s main yard broke, and we lay to under foresail and\r\nmainsail for two days and a night. On the 22nd of the same month,\r\nwhen going S. by W., we saw many birds resembling herons.[36] On the\r\napproach of night they flew vigorously to the S.S.E., as if making for\r\nthe land.[37] On the same day, being then quite 800 leagues out at sea\r\n[_i.e._, reckoning from S. Thiago], we saw a whale.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, October 27, the eve of St. Simon and Jude, we saw many\r\nwhales, as also quoquas[38] and seals.[39]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, November 1, the day of All Saints, we perceived many\r\nindications of the neighbourhood of land, including gulf-weed,[40]\r\nwhich grows along the coast.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 4th of the same month, a couple of hours before\r\nbreak of day, we had soundings in 110 fathoms,[41] and at nine o’clock\r\nwe sighted the land.[42] We then drew near to each other, and having\r\nput on our gala clothes, we saluted the captain-major by firing our\r\nbombards, and dressed the ships with flags and standards. In the course\r\nof the day we tacked so as to come close to the land, but as we failed\r\nto identify it, we again stood out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Bay of St. Helena._]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday [November 7] we returned to the land, which we found to be\r\nlow, with a broad bay opening into it. The captain-major sent Pero\r\nd’Alenquer[43] in a boat to take soundings and to search for good\r\nanchoring ground. The bay was found to be very clean, and to afford\r\nshelter against all winds except those from the N.W. It extended east\r\nand west, and we named it Santa Helena.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday [November 8] we cast anchor in this bay, and we remained\r\nthere eight days, cleaning the ships, mending the sails, and taking in\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe river Samtiagua [S. Thiago][44] enters the bay four leagues to the\r\nS.E. of the anchorage. It comes from the interior (sertão), is about\r\na stone’s throw across at the mouth, and from two to three fathoms in\r\ndepth at all states of the tide.[45]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this country are tawny-coloured.[46] Their food is\r\nconfined to the flesh of seals, whales and gazelles, and the roots of\r\nherbs. They are dressed in skins, and wear sheaths over their virile\r\nmembers.[47] They are armed with poles of olive wood to which a horn,\r\nbrowned in the fire, is attached.[48] Their numerous dogs resemble\r\nthose of Portugal, and bark like them. The birds of the country,\r\nlikewise, are the same as in Portugal, and include cormorants, gulls,\r\nturtle doves, crested larks, and many others. The climate is healthy\r\nand temperate, and produces good herbage.\r\n\r\nOn the day after we had cast anchor, that is to say on Thursday\r\n[November 9], we landed with the captain-major, and made captive one of\r\nthe natives, who was small of stature like Sancho Mexia. This man had\r\nbeen gathering honey in the sandy waste, for in this country the bees\r\ndeposit their honey at the foot of the mounds around the bushes. He\r\nwas taken on board the captain-major’s ship, and being placed at table\r\nhe ate of all we ate. On the following day the captain-major had him\r\nwell dressed and sent ashore.[49]\r\n\r\nOn the following day [November 10] fourteen or fifteen natives came to\r\nwhere our ships lay. The captain-major landed and showed them a variety\r\nof merchandise, with the view of finding out whether such things were\r\nto be found in their country. This merchandise included cinnamon,\r\ncloves, seed-pearls, gold, and many other things, but it was evident\r\nthat they had no knowledge whatever of such articles, and they were\r\nconsequently given round bells and tin rings. This happened on Friday,\r\nand the like took place on Saturday.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday [November 12] about forty or fifty natives made their\r\nappearance, and having dined, we landed, and in exchange for the\r\nçeitils[50] with which we came provided, we obtained shells, which they\r\nwore as ornaments in their ears, and which looked as if they had been\r\nplated, and fox-tails attached to a handle, with which they fanned\r\ntheir faces. I also acquired for one çeitil one of the sheaths which\r\nthey wore over their members, and this seemed to show that they valued\r\ncopper very highly; indeed, they wore small beads of that metal in\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nOn that day Fernão Velloso, who was with the captain-major, expressed\r\na great desire to be permitted to accompany the natives to their\r\nhouses, so that he might find out how they lived and what they ate.\r\nThe captain-major yielded to his importunities, and allowed him to\r\naccompany them, and when we returned to the captain-major’s vessel to\r\nsup, he went away with the negroes. Soon after they had left us they\r\ncaught a seal, and when they came to the foot of a hill in a barren\r\nplace they roasted it, and gave some of it to Fernão Velloso, as also\r\nsome of the roots which they eat. After this meal they expressed a\r\ndesire that he should not accompany them any further, but return to the\r\nvessels. When Fernão Velloso came abreast of the vessels he began to\r\nshout, the negroes keeping in the bush.\r\n\r\nWe were still at supper; but when his shouts were heard the\r\ncaptain-major rose at once, and so did we others, and we entered a\r\nsailing boat. The negroes then began running along the beach, and they\r\ncame as quickly up with Fernão Velloso[51] as we did, and when we\r\nendeavoured to get him into the boat they threw their assegais, and\r\nwounded the captain-major and three or four others. All this happened\r\nbecause we looked upon these people as men of little spirit, quite\r\nincapable of violence, and had therefore landed without first arming\r\nourselves. We then returned to the ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Rounding the Cape_].\r\n\r\nAt daybreak of Thursday the 16th of November, having careened our ships\r\nand taken in wood, we set sail. At that time we did not know how far\r\nwe might be abaft the Cape of Good Hope. Pero d’Alenquer thought the\r\ndistance about thirty leagues,[52] but he was not certain, for on his\r\nreturn voyage [when with B. Dias] he had left the Cape in the morning\r\nand had gone past this bay with the wind astern, whilst on the outward\r\nvoyage he had kept at sea, and was therefore unable to identify the\r\nlocality where we now were. We therefore stood out towards the S.S.W.\r\nand late on Saturday [November 18] we beheld the Cape. On that same\r\nday we again stood out to sea, returning to the land in the course\r\nof the night. On Sunday morning, November 19, we once more made for\r\nthe Cape, but were again unable to round it, for the wind blew from\r\nthe S.S.W., whilst the Cape juts out towards the S.W. We then again\r\nstood out to sea, returning to the land on Monday night. At last, on\r\nWednesday [November 22], at noon, having the wind astern, we succeeded\r\nin doubling the Cape, and then ran along the coast.[53]\r\n\r\nTo the south of this Cape of Good Hope, and close to it, a vast bay,\r\nsix leagues broad at its mouth, enters about six leagues into the\r\nland.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Bay of São Braz_].[55]\r\n\r\nLate on Saturday, November 25, the day of St. Catherine’s, we entered\r\nthe bay (angra) of Sam Brás, where we remained for thirteen days, for\r\nthere we broke up our store-ship and transferred her contents to the\r\nother vessels.[56]\r\n\r\nOn Friday [December 1], whilst still in the bay of Sam Brás, about\r\nninety men resembling those we had met at St. Helena Bay made their\r\nappearance. Some of them walked along the beach, whilst others\r\nremained upon the hills. All, or most of us, were at the time in the\r\ncaptain-major’s vessel. As soon as we saw them we launched and armed\r\nthe boats, and started for the land. When close to the shore the\r\ncaptain-major threw them little round bells, which they picked up. They\r\neven ventured to approach us, and took some of these bells from the\r\ncaptain-major’s hand. This surprised us greatly, for when Bartholomeu\r\nDias[57] was here the natives fled without taking any of the objects\r\nwhich he offered them. Nay, on one occasion, when Dias was taking in\r\nwater, close to the beach, they sought to prevent him, and when they\r\npelted him with stones, from a hill, he killed one of them with the\r\narrow of a cross-bow. It appeared to us that they did not fly on this\r\noccasion, because they had heard from the people at the bay of St.\r\nHelena (only sixty leagues distant by sea)[58] that there was no harm\r\nin us, and that we even gave away things which were ours.\r\n\r\nThe captain-major did not land at this spot, because there was much\r\nbush, but proceeded to an open part of the beach, when he made signs\r\nto the negroes to approach. This they did. The captain-major and the\r\nother captains then landed, being attended by armed men, some of whom\r\ncarried cross-bows. He then made the negroes understand, by signs, that\r\nthey were to disperse, and to approach him only singly or in couples.\r\nTo those who approached he gave small bells and red caps, in return\r\nfor which they presented him with ivory bracelets, such as they wore\r\non their arms, for it appears that elephants are plentiful in this\r\ncountry. We actually found some of their droppings near the watering\r\nplace where they had gone to drink.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday [December 2] about two hundred negroes came, both young\r\nand old. They brought with them about a dozen oxen and cows and four\r\nor five sheep. As soon as we saw them we went ashore. They forthwith\r\nbegan to play on four or five flutes,[59] some producing high notes and\r\nothers low ones, thus making a pretty harmony for negroes who are not\r\nexpected to be musicians; and they danced in the style of negroes. The\r\ncaptain-major then ordered the trumpets to be sounded, and we, in the\r\nboats, danced, and the captain-major did so likewise when he rejoined\r\nus. This festivity ended, we landed where we had landed before, and\r\nbought a black ox for three bracelets. This ox we dined off on Sunday.\r\nWe found him very fat, and his meat as toothsome as the beef of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday [December 3] many visitors came, and brought with them their\r\nwomen and little boys, the women remaining on the top of a hill near\r\nthe sea. They had with them many oxen and cows. Having collected in\r\ntwo spots on the beach, they played and danced as they had done on\r\nSaturday. It is the custom of this people for the young men to remain\r\nin the bush with their weapons. The [older] men came to converse with\r\nus. They carried a short stick in the hand, attached to which was a\r\nfox’s tail, with which they fan the face. Whilst conversing with them,\r\nby signs, we observed the young men crouching in the bush, holding\r\ntheir weapons in their hands. The captain-major then ordered Martin\r\nAffonso, who had formerly been in Manicongo [Congo] to advance, and\r\nto buy an ox, for which purpose he was supplied with bracelets. The\r\nnatives, having accepted the bracelets, took him by the hand, and,\r\npointing to the watering place, asked him why we took away their\r\nwater, and simultaneously drove their cattle into the bush. When the\r\ncaptain-major observed this he ordered us to gather together, and\r\ncalled upon Martin Affonso to retreat, for he suspected some treachery.\r\nHaving drawn together we proceeded [in our boats] to the place where\r\nwe had been at first. The negroes followed us. The captain-major then\r\nordered us to land, armed with lances, assegais, and strung cross-bows,\r\nand wearing our breast-plates, for he wanted to show that we had the\r\nmeans of doing them an injury, although we had no desire to employ\r\nthem. When they observed this they ran away. The captain-major, anxious\r\nthat none should be killed by mischance, ordered the boats to draw\r\ntogether; but to prove that we were able, although unwilling to hurt\r\nthem, he ordered two bombards to be fired from the poop of the long\r\nboat. They were by that time all seated close to the bush, not far\r\nfrom the beach, but the first discharge caused them to retreat so\r\nprecipitately that in their flight they dropped the skins with which\r\nthey were covered and their weapons. When they were in the bush two of\r\nthem turned back to pick up the articles which had been dropped. They\r\nthen continued their flight to the top of a hill, driving their cattle\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nThe oxen of this country are as large as those of Alemtejo, wonderfully\r\nfat and very tame. They are geldings, and hornless. Upon the fattest\r\namong them the negroes place a packsaddle made of reeds, as is done\r\nin Castille, and upon this saddle they place a kind of litter made of\r\nsticks, upon which they ride. If they wish to sell an ox they pass a\r\nstick through his nostrils, and thus lead him.\r\n\r\nThere is an island in this bay, three bowshots from the land, where\r\nthere are many seals.[60] Some of these are as big as bears, very\r\nformidable, with large tusks. These attack man, and no spear, whatever\r\nthe force with which it is thrown, can wound them. There are others\r\nmuch smaller and others quite small. And whilst the big ones roar like\r\nlions, the little ones cry like goats. One day, when we approached this\r\nisland for our amusement, we counted, among large and small ones, three\r\nthousand, and we fired among them with our bombards from the sea. On\r\nthe same island there are birds as big as ducks, but they cannot fly,\r\nbecause they have no feathers on their wings. These birds, of whom we\r\nkilled as many as we chose, are called Fotylicayos, and they bray like\r\nasses.[61]\r\n\r\nWhilst taking in water in this bay of Sam Brás, on a Wednesday,\r\nwe erected a cross and a pillar.[62] The cross was made out of a\r\nmizzen-mast, and very high. On the following Thursday [December 7],\r\nwhen about to set sail, we saw about ten or twelve negroes, who\r\ndemolished both the cross and the pillar before we had left.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_São Braz to Natal._]\r\n\r\nHaving taken on board all we stood in need of we took our departure,\r\nbut as the wind failed us we anchored the same day, having proceeded\r\nonly two leagues.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning, the day of the Immaculate Concepcion [December 8],\r\nwe again set sail. On Tuesday [December 12], the eve of Santa Lucia,\r\nwe encountered a great storm, and ran before a stern-wind with the\r\nforesail much lowered. On that day we lost sight of Nicolau Coelho, but\r\nat sunset we saw him from the top four or five leagues astern, and it\r\nseemed as if he saw us too. We exhibited signal lights and lay to. By\r\nthe end of the first watch he had come up with us, not because he had\r\nseen us during the day, but because the wind, being scant, he could not\r\nhelp coming in our waters.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Friday [December 15] we saw the land near the Ilhéos\r\nchãos (Flat Islands). These are five leagues beyond the Ilhéo da Cruz\r\n(Cross Island). From the Bay of Sam Brás to Cross Island is a distance\r\nof sixty leagues, and as much from the Cape of Good Hope to the Bay\r\nof Sam Brás. From the Flat Islands to the last pillar erected by\r\nBartholomeu Dias is five leagues, and from this pillar to the Rio do\r\nInfante is fifteen leagues.[63]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday [December 16] we passed the last pillar, and as we ran\r\nalong the coast we observed two men running along the beach in a\r\ndirection contrary to that which we followed. The country about here\r\nis very charming and well wooded; we saw much cattle, and the further\r\nwe advanced the more did the character of the country improve, and the\r\ntrees increase in size.\r\n\r\nDuring the following night we lay to. We were then already beyond the\r\nlast discovery made by Bartholomeu Dias.[64] On the next day [December\r\n17], till vespers, we sailed along the coast before a stern-wind, when\r\nthe wind springing round to the east we stood out to sea. And thus we\r\nkept making tacks until sunset on Tuesday [December 19], when the wind\r\nagain veered to the west. We then lay to during the night, in order\r\nthat we might on the following day examine the coast and find out where\r\nwe were.\r\n\r\nIn the morning [December 20] we made straight for the land, and at ten\r\no’clock found ourselves once more at the Ilhéo da Cruz (Cross Island),\r\nthat is sixty leagues abaft our dead reckoning! This was due to the\r\ncurrents, which are very strong here.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very day we again went forward by the route we had already\r\nattempted, and being favoured during three or four days by a strong\r\nstern-wind, we were able to overcome the currents which we had feared\r\nmight frustrate our plans. Henceforth it pleased God in His mercy to\r\nallow us to make headway! We were not again driven back. May it please\r\nHim that it be thus alway!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Natal._]\r\n\r\nBy Christmas Day, the 25th of December, we had discovered seventy\r\nleagues of coast [beyond Dias’ furthest]. On that day, after dinner,\r\nwhen setting a bonnet, we discovered that the mast had sprung ... and\r\n... secured it with lashings below the top, and that the crack opened\r\nand shut. We patched it up with backstays, hoping to be able to repair\r\nit thoroughly as soon as we should reach a sheltered port.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday [December 28] we anchored near the coast, and took much\r\nfish.[66] At sunset we again set sail and pursued our route. At that\r\nplace the mooring-rope snapped and we lost an anchor.\r\n\r\nWe now went so far out to sea, without touching any port, that\r\ndrinking-water began to fail us, and our food had to be cooked with\r\nsalt water. Our daily ration of water was reduced to a quartilho.[67]\r\nIt thus became necessary to seek a port.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Terra da boa Gente and Rio do Cobre._]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 11th [1498][68] we discovered a small river and\r\nanchored near the coast. On the following day we went close in shore in\r\nour boats, and saw a crowd of negroes, both men and women. They were\r\ntall people, and a chief (“Senhor”) was among them. The captain-major\r\nordered Martin Affonso, who had been a long time in Manicongo, and\r\nanother man, to land. They were received hospitably. The captain-major\r\nin consequence sent the chief a jacket, a pair of red pantaloons, a\r\nMoorish cap and a bracelet. The chief said that we were welcome to\r\nanything in his country of which we stood in need: at least this is\r\nhow Martin Affonso understood him. That night, Martin Affonso and his\r\ncompanion accompanied the chief to his village, whilst we returned to\r\nthe ships. On the road the chief donned the garments which had been\r\npresented to him, and to those who came forth to meet him he said with\r\nmuch apparent satisfaction, “Look, what has been given to me!” The\r\npeople upon this clapped hands as a sign of courtesy, and this they did\r\nthree or four times until he arrived at the village. Having paraded the\r\nwhole of the place, thus dressed up, the chief retired to his house,\r\nand ordered his two guests to be lodged in a compound, where they were\r\ngiven porridge of millet, which abounds in that country, and a fowl,\r\njust like those of Portugal. All the night through, numbers of men and\r\nwomen came to have a look at them. In the morning the chief visited\r\nthem, and asked them to go back to the ships. He ordered two men to\r\naccompany them, and gave them fowls as a present for the captain-major,\r\ntelling them at the same time that he would show the things that had\r\nbeen given him to a great chief, who appears to be the king of that\r\ncountry. When our men reached the landing place where our boats awaited\r\nthem, they were attended by quite two hundred men, who had come to see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis country seemed to us to be densely peopled. There are many\r\nchiefs,[69] and the number of women seems to be greater than that of\r\nthe men, for among those who came to see us there were forty women\r\nto every twenty men. The houses are built of straw. The arms of the\r\npeople include long bows and arrows and spears with iron blades. Copper\r\nseems to be plentiful, for the people wore [ornaments] of it on their\r\nlegs and arms and in their twisted hair. Tin, likewise, is found in\r\nthe country, for it is to be seen on the hilts of their daggers, the\r\nsheaths of which are made of ivory. Linen cloth is highly prized by\r\nthe people, who were always willing to give large quantities of copper\r\nin exchange for shirts. They have large calabashes in which they carry\r\nsea-water inland, where they pour it into pits, to obtain the salt [by\r\nevaporation].\r\n\r\nWe stayed five days at this place, taking in water, which our visitors\r\nconveyed to our boats. Our stay was not, however, sufficiently\r\nprolonged to enable us to take in as much water as we really needed,\r\nfor the wind favoured a prosecution of our voyage.\r\n\r\nWe were at anchor here, near the coast, exposed to the swell of the\r\nsea. We called the country _Terra da Boa Gente_ (land of good people),\r\nand the river _Rio do Cobre_ (copper river).[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Rio dos Bons Signaes._][71]\r\n\r\nOn Monday [January 22] we discovered a low coast thickly wooded with\r\ntall trees. Continuing our course we perceived the broad mouth of a\r\nriver. As it was necessary to find out where we were, we cast anchor.\r\nOn Thursday [January 25], at night, we entered. The _Berrio_ was\r\nalready there, having entered the night before—that is eight days\r\nbefore the end of January [_i.e._, January 24.][72]\r\n\r\nThe country is low and marshy, and covered with tall trees yielding an\r\nabundance of various fruits, which the inhabitants eat.\r\n\r\nThese people are black and well made. They go naked, merely wearing a\r\npiece of cotton stuff around their loins, that worn by the women being\r\nlarger than that worn by the men. The young women are good-looking.\r\nTheir lips are pierced in three places, and they wear in them bits of\r\ntwisted tin. These people took much delight in us. They brought us in\r\ntheir _almadias_[73] what they had, whilst we went into their village\r\nto procure water.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been two or three days at this place two gentlemen\r\n(senhores) of the country came to see us. They were very haughty, and\r\nvalued nothing which we gave them. One of them wore a _touca_,[74] with\r\na fringe embroidered in silk, and the other a cap of green satin. A\r\nyoung man in their company—so we understood from their signs—had come\r\nfrom a distant country, and had already seen big ships like ours. These\r\ntokens (signaes) gladdened our hearts, for it appeared as if we were\r\nreally approaching the bourne of our desires. These gentlemen had some\r\nhuts built on the river bank, close to the ships, in which they stayed\r\nseven days, sending daily to the ships, offering to barter cloths which\r\nbore a mark of red ochre. And when they were tired of being there, they\r\nleft in their _almadias_ for the upper river.\r\n\r\nAs to ourselves, we spent thirty-two days[75] in the river taking\r\nin water, careening the ships,[76] and repairing the mast of the\r\n_Raphael_. Many of our men fell ill here, their feet and hands\r\nswelling, and their gums growing over their teeth, so that they could\r\nnot eat.[77]\r\n\r\nWe erected here a pillar which we called the pillar of St. Raphael,[78]\r\nbecause it had been brought in the ship bearing that name. The river we\r\ncalled Rio dos Bons Signaes (River of good signs or tokens).\r\n\r\n\r\n[_To Moçambique._]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday [February 24] we left this place and gained the open sea.\r\nDuring the night we stood N.E., so as to keep away from the land, which\r\nwas very pleasing to look upon. On Sunday [February 25] we still stood\r\nN.E., and at vesper time discovered three small islands, out in the\r\nopen, of which two were covered with tall trees, while the third and\r\nsmallest was barren. The distance from one island to the other was four\r\nleagues.[79]\r\n\r\nOn the following day we pursued our route, and did so during six days,\r\nlying to at night.[80]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 1st of March, we sighted islands and the mainland,\r\nbut as it was late we again stood out to sea, and lay to till morning.\r\nWe then approached the land, of which I shall speak in what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Moçambique._][81]\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning [March 2] Nicolau Coelho, when attempting to enter\r\nthe bay, mistook the channel and came upon a bank. When putting about\r\nship, towards the other ships which followed in his wake, Coelho\r\nperceived some sailing boats approaching from a village on this island,\r\nin order to welcome the captain-major and his brother. As for ourselves\r\nwe continued in the direction of our proposed anchorage, these boats\r\nfollowing us all the while, and making signs for us to stop. When\r\nwe had cast anchor in the roadstead of the island from which these\r\nboats had come, there approached seven or eight of them, including\r\n_almadias_, the people in them playing upon _anafils_.[82] They invited\r\nus to proceed further into the bay, offering to take us into port if we\r\ndesired it. Those among them who boarded our ships ate and drank what\r\nwe did, and went their way when they were satisfied.[83]\r\n\r\nThe captain thought that we should enter this bay in order that we\r\nmight find out what sort of people we had to deal with; that Nicolau\r\nCoelho should go first in his vessel, to take soundings at the\r\nentrance, and that, if found practicable, we should follow him. As\r\nCoelho prepared to enter he struck the point of the island and broke\r\nhis helm, but he immediately disengaged himself and regained deep\r\nwater. I was with him at the time. When we were again in deep water we\r\nstruck our sails and cast anchor at a distance of two bowshots from the\r\nvillage.[84]\r\n\r\nThe people of this country are of a ruddy complexion[85] and well\r\nmade. They are Mohammedans, and their language is the same as that of\r\nthe Moors.[86] Their dresses are of fine linen or cotton stuffs, with\r\nvariously coloured stripes, and of rich and elaborate workmanship.\r\nThey all wear _toucas_ with borders of silk embroidered in gold. They\r\nare merchants, and have transactions with white Moors, four of whose\r\nvessels were at the time in port, laden with gold, silver, cloves,\r\npepper, ginger, and silver rings, as also with quantities of pearls,\r\njewels,[87] and rubies, all of which articles are used by the people\r\nof this country. We understood them to say that all these things, with\r\nthe exception of the gold, were brought thither by these Moors; that\r\nfurther on, where we were going to, they abounded, and that precious\r\nstones, pearls and spices were so plentiful that there was no need\r\nto purchase them as they could be collected in baskets. All this we\r\nlearned through a sailor the captain-major had with him, and who,\r\nhaving formerly been a prisoner among the Moors, understood their\r\nlanguage.[88]\r\n\r\nThese Moors, moreover, told us that along the route which we were about\r\nto follow we should meet with numerous shoals; that there were many\r\ncities along the coast, and also an island, one half the population of\r\nwhich consisted of Moors and the other half of Christians,[89] who were\r\nat war with each other. This island was said to be very wealthy.\r\n\r\nWe were told, morever, that Prester John[90] resided not far from\r\nthis place; that he held many cities along the coast, and that the\r\ninhabitants of those cities were great merchants and owned big ships.\r\nThe residence of Prester John was said to be far in the interior, and\r\ncould be reached only on the back of camels. These Moors had also\r\nbrought hither two Christian captives from India.[91] This information,\r\nand many other things which we heard, rendered us so happy that we\r\ncried with joy, and prayed God to grant us health, so that we might\r\nbehold what we so much desired.\r\n\r\nIn this place and island of Moncobiquy [Moçambique] there resided\r\na chief [senhor] who had the title of Sultan, and was like a\r\nvice-roy.[92] He often came aboard our ships attended by some of his\r\npeople. The captain-major gave him many good things to eat, and made\r\nhim a present of hats, _marlotas_,[93] corals and many other articles.\r\nHe was, however, so proud that he treated all we gave him with\r\ncontempt, and asked for scarlet cloth, of which we had none. We gave\r\nhim, however, of all the things we had.\r\n\r\nOne day the captain-major invited him to a repast, when there was an\r\nabundance of figs and comfits, and begged him for two pilots to go with\r\nus. He at once granted this request, subject to our coming to terms\r\nwith them. The captain-major gave each of them thirty mitkals[94] in\r\ngold and two _marlotas_, on condition that from the day on which they\r\nreceived this payment one of them should always remain on board if the\r\nother desired to go on land. With these terms they were well satisfied.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, March 10, we set sail and anchored one league out at sea,\r\nclose to an island,[95] where mass was said on Sunday, when those who\r\nwished to do so confessed and joined in the communion.\r\n\r\nOne of our pilots lived on the island, and when we had anchored we\r\narmed two boats to go in search of him. The captain-major went in\r\none boat and Nicolau Coelho in the other. They were met by five or\r\nsix boats (barcas) coming from the island, and crowded with people\r\narmed with bows and long arrows and bucklers,[96] who gave them to\r\nunderstand by signs that they were to return to the town. When the\r\ncaptain saw this he secured the pilot whom he had taken with him, and\r\nordered the bombards to fire upon the boats. Paulo da Gama, who had\r\nremained with the ships, so as to be prepared to render succour in case\r\nof need, no sooner heard the reports of the bombards than he started in\r\nthe _Berrio_. The Moors, who were already flying, fled still faster,\r\nand gained the land before the _Berrio_ was able to come up with them.\r\nWe then returned to our anchorage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vessels of this country are of good size and decked. There are no\r\nnails, and the planks are held together by cords,[97] as are also those\r\nof their boats (barcos). The sails are made of palm-matting.[98] Their\r\nmariners have Genoese needles,[99] by which they steer, quadrants, and\r\nnavigating charts.\r\n\r\nThe palms of this country yield a fruit as large as a melon, of which\r\nthe kernel is eaten.[100] It has a nutty flavour. There also grow in\r\nabundance melons and cucumbers, which were brought to us for barter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day in which Nicolau Coelho entered the port, the Lord of the\r\nplace came on board with a numerous suite. He was received well,\r\nand Coelho presented him with a red hood, in return for which the\r\nLord handed him a black rosary, which he made use of when saying his\r\nprayers, to be held as a pledge. He then begged Nicolau Coelho for the\r\nuse of his boat, to take him ashore. This was granted. And after he had\r\nlanded he invited those who had accompanied him to his house, where he\r\ngave them to eat. He then dismissed them, giving them a jar of bruised\r\ndates made into a preserve with cloves and cumin, as a present for\r\nNicolau Coelho. Subsequently he sent many things to the captain-major.\r\nAll this happened at the time when he took us for Turks or for Moors\r\nfrom some foreign land, for in case we came from Turkey he begged to be\r\nshown the bows of our country and our books of the Law. But when they\r\nlearnt that we were Christians they arranged to seize and kill us by\r\ntreachery. The pilot, whom we took with us, subsequently revealed to us\r\nall they intended to do, if they were able.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_False Start and Return to Moçambique._]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday [March 11] we celebrated mass beneath a tall tree on the\r\nisland [of S. Jorge]. We returned on board and at once set sail, taking\r\nwith us many fowls, goats and pigeons, which had been given us in\r\nexchange for small glass-beads.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday [March 13] we saw high mountains rising on the other side\r\nof a cape. The coast near the cape was sparsely covered with trees,\r\nresembling elms. We were at that time over twenty leagues from our\r\nstarting-place, and there we remained becalmed during Tuesday and\r\nWednesday. During the following night we stood off shore with a light\r\neasterly wind, and in the morning [March 15] found ourselves four\r\nleagues abaft Moçambique, but we went again forward on that day until\r\nthe evening, when we anchored once more close to the island [of S.\r\nJorge] on which mass had been celebrated the preceding Sunday, and\r\nthere we remained eight days waiting for a favourable wind.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay here the King of Moçambique sent word that he wanted to\r\nmake peace with us and to be our friend. His ambassador was a white\r\nMoor and sharif,[101] that is priest, and at the same time a great\r\ndrunkard.\r\n\r\nWhilst at this place a Moor with his little son came on board one of\r\nour ships, and asked to be allowed to accompany us, as he was from\r\nnear Mecca, and had come to Moçambique as pilot of a vessel from that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs the weather did not favour us it became necessary once more to enter\r\nthe port of Moçambique, in order to procure the water of which we stood\r\nin need, for the watering place is on the mainland. This water is drunk\r\nby the inhabitants of the island, for all the water they have there is\r\nbrackish.[102]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday [March 22] we entered the port, and when it grew dark we\r\nlowered our boats. At midnight the captain-major and Nicolau Coelho,\r\naccompanied by some of us, started in search of water. We took with\r\nus the Moorish pilot, whose object appeared to be to make his escape,\r\nrather than to guide us to a watering-place. As a matter of fact he\r\neither would not or could not find a watering-place, although we\r\ncontinued our search until morning. We then withdrew to our ships.\r\n\r\nIn the evening [March 23] we returned to the main land, attended by the\r\nsame pilot. On approaching the watering-place we saw about twenty men\r\non the beach. They were armed with assegais, and forbade our approach.\r\nThe captain-major upon this ordered three bombards to be fired upon\r\nthem, so that we might land. Having effected our landing, these men\r\nfled into the bush, and we took as much water as we wanted. When the\r\nsun was about to set we discovered that a negro belonging to João de\r\nCoimbra had effected his escape.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, the 24th of March, being the eve of Lady Day, a\r\nMoor came abreast our ships, and [sneeringly] told us that if we\r\nwanted water we might go in search of it, giving us to understand\r\nthat we should meet with something which would make us turn back. The\r\ncaptain-major no sooner heard this [threat] than he resolved to go, in\r\norder to show that we were able to do them harm if we desired it. We\r\nforthwith armed our boats, placing bombards in their poops, and started\r\nfor the village [town]. The Moors had constructed palisades by lashing\r\nplanks together, so that those behind them could not be seen. They were\r\nat the time walking along the beach, armed with assegais, swords,[103]\r\nbows, and slings, with which they hurled stones at us. But our bombards\r\nsoon made it so hot for them that they fled behind their palisades;\r\nbut this turned out to their injury rather than their profit. During\r\nthe three hours that we were occupied in this manner [bombarding the\r\ntown] we saw two men killed, one on the beach and the other behind the\r\npalisades. When we were weary of this work we retired to our ships to\r\ndine. They at once began to fly, carrying their chattels in _almadias_\r\nto a village on the mainland.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we started in our boats, in the hope of being able to make\r\na few prisoners, whom we might exchange for the two Indian Christians\r\nwhom they held captive and the negro who had deserted. With this\r\nobject in view we chased an _almadia_, which belonged to the sharif\r\nand was laden with his chattels, and another in which were four\r\nnegroes.[104] The latter was captured by Paulo da Gama, whilst the one\r\nladen with chattels was abandoned by the crew as soon as they reached\r\nthe land. We took still another _almadia_ which had likewise been\r\nabandoned. The negroes we took on board our ships. In the _almadias_\r\nwe found fine cotton-stuffs, baskets made of palm-fronds, a glazed\r\njar containing butter, glass phials with scented water, books of the\r\nLaw, a box containing skeins of cotton, a cotton net, and many small\r\nbaskets filled with millet. All these things, with the exception of\r\nthe books, which were kept back to be shown to the king, were given by\r\nthe captain-major to the sailors who were with him and with the other\r\ncaptains.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday [March 25] we took in water, and on Monday we proceeded in\r\nour armed boats to the village, when the inhabitants spoke to us from\r\ntheir houses, they daring no longer to venture on the beach. Having\r\ndischarged a few bombards at them we rejoined our ships.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday [March 27] we left the town and anchored close to the islets\r\nof São Jorge,[105] where we remained for three days, in the hope that\r\nGod would grant us a favourable wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Moçambique to Mombaça_].\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 29th of March, we left these islets of S. Jorge, and\r\nas the wind was light, we only covered twenty-eight leagues up to the\r\nmorning of Saturday, the 31st of the month.[106]\r\n\r\nIn the morning of that day we were once more abreast of the land of\r\nthe Moors, from which powerful currents had previously carried us.[107]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, April 1, we came to some islands close to the mainland.\r\nThe first of these we called _Ilha do Açoutado_ (“Island of the\r\nflogged-one”), because of the flogging inflicted upon our Moorish\r\npilot, who had lied to the captain on Saturday night, by stating that\r\nthese islands were the mainland. Native craft take their course between\r\nthese islands and the mainland, where the water is four fathoms deep,\r\nbut we kept outside of them. These islands are numerous, and we were\r\nunable to distinguish one from the other; they are inhabited.\r\n\r\nOn Monday [April 2] we sighted other islands five leagues off the\r\nshore.[108]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 4th of April, we made sail to the N.W., and before\r\nnoon we sighted an extensive country, and two islands close to it,\r\nsurrounded with shoals. And when we were near enough for the pilots to\r\nrecognise these islands, they told us that we had left three leagues\r\nbehind us an island[109] inhabited by Christians. We manœuvred all\r\nday in the hope of fetching this island, but in vain, for the wind was\r\ntoo strong for us. After this we thought it best to bear away for a\r\ncity called Mombaça, reported to be four days ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThe above island was one of those which we had come to discover, for\r\nour pilots said that it was inhabited by Christians.\r\n\r\nWhen we bore away for the north it was already late, and the wind was\r\nhigh. At nightfall we perceived a large island, which remained to the\r\nnorth of us.[110] Our pilot told us that there were two towns on this\r\nisland, one of Christians and the other of Moors.\r\n\r\nThat night we stood out to sea, and in the morning [April 5] we no\r\nlonger saw the land. We then steered to the N.W., and in the evening\r\nwe again beheld the land. During the following night we bore away to\r\nthe N. by W., and during the morning-watch we changed our course to\r\nthe N.N.W. Sailing thus before a favourable wind, the _S. Raphael_,\r\ntwo hours before break of day [April 6], ran aground on a shoal, about\r\ntwo leagues from the land. Immediately the _Raphael_ touched bottom,\r\nthe vessels following her were warned by shouts, and these were no\r\nsooner heard than they cast anchor about the distance of a gunshot from\r\nthe stranded vessel, and lowered their boats. When the tide fell the\r\n_Raphael_ lay high and dry. With the help of the boats many anchors\r\nwere laid out, and when the tide rose again, in the course of the day,\r\nthe vessel floated and there was much rejoicing.\r\n\r\nOn the mainland, facing these shoals, there rises a lofty range of\r\nmountains, beautiful of aspect. These mountains we called _Serras de\r\nSão Raphael_, and we gave the same name to the shoals.[111]\r\n\r\nWhilst the vessel was high and dry, two _Almadias_ approached us. One\r\nwas laden with fine oranges, better than those of Portugal. Two of the\r\nMoors remained on board, and accompanied us next day to Mombaça.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning, the 7th of the month, and eve of Palm Sunday,\r\nwe ran along the coast and saw some islands at a distance of fifteen\r\nleagues from the mainland, and about six leagues in extent. They supply\r\nthe vessels of the country with masts. All are inhabited by Moors.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Mombaça_].\r\n\r\nOn Saturday [April 7] we cast anchor off Mombaça, but did not enter\r\nthe port. No sooner had we been perceived than a _zavra_[113] manned\r\nby Moors came out to us: in front of the city there lay numerous\r\nvessels all dressed in flags.[114] And we, anxious not to be outdone,\r\nalso dressed our ships, and we actually surpassed their show, for we\r\nwanted in nothing but men, even the few whom we had being very ill.\r\nWe anchored here with much pleasure, for we confidently hoped that on\r\nthe following day we might go on land and hear mass jointly with the\r\nChristians reported to live there under their own _alcaide_[115] in a\r\nquarter separate from that of the Moors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native Craft in the Harbour of Mombasa.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph by the late Capt. Foot, R.N._)]\r\n\r\nThe pilots who had come with us told us there resided both Moors and\r\nChristians in this city; that these latter lived apart under their\r\nown lords, and that on our arrival they would receive us with much\r\nhonour and take us to their houses. But they said this for a purpose\r\nof their own, for it was not true. At midnight there approached us a\r\n_zavra_ with about a hundred men, all armed with cutlasses (tarçados)\r\nand bucklers. When they came to the vessel of the captain-major they\r\nattempted to board her, armed as they were, but this was not permitted,\r\nonly four or five of the most distinguished men among them being\r\nallowed on board. They remained about a couple of hours, and it seemed\r\nto us that they paid us this visit merely to find out whether they\r\nmight not capture one or the other of our vessels.\r\n\r\nOn Palm Sunday [April 8] the King of Mombaça sent the captain-major a\r\nsheep and large quantities of oranges, lemons and sugar-cane, together\r\nwith a ring, as a pledge of safety, letting him know that in case of\r\nhis entering the port he would be supplied with all he stood in need\r\nof. This present was conveyed to us by two men, almost white, who said\r\nthey were Christians, which appeared to be the fact. The captain-major\r\nsent the king a string of coral-beads as a return present, and let\r\nhim know that he purposed entering the port on the following day. On\r\nthe same day the captain-major’s vessel was visited by four Moors of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nTwo men were sent by the captain-major to the king, still further to\r\nconfirm these peaceful assurances. When these landed they were followed\r\nby a crowd as far as the gates of the palace. Before reaching the king\r\nthey passed through four doors, each guarded by a doorkeeper with a\r\ndrawn cutlass. The king received them hospitably, and ordered that they\r\nshould be shown over the city. They stopped on their way at the house\r\nof two Christian merchants, who showed them a paper (carta), an object\r\nof their adoration, on which was a sketch of the Holy Ghost.[116] When\r\nthey had seen all, the king sent them back with samples of cloves,\r\npepper and corn,[117] with which articles he would allow us to load our\r\nships.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday [April 10], when weighing anchor to enter the port, the\r\ncaptain-major’s vessel would not pay off, and struck the vessel which\r\nfollowed astern. We therefore again cast anchor. When the Moors who\r\nwere in our ship saw that we did not go on, they scrambled into a\r\n_zavra_ attached to our stern; whilst the two pilots whom we had\r\nbrought from Moçambique jumped into the water, and were picked up by\r\nthe men in the _zavra_. At night the captain-major “questioned” two\r\nMoors [from Moçambique][118] whom we had on board, by dropping boiling\r\noil upon their skin, so that they might confess any treachery intended\r\nagainst us. They said that orders had been given to capture us as\r\nsoon as we entered the port, and thus to avenge what we had done at\r\nMoçambique. And when this torture was being applied a second time, one\r\nof the Moors, although his hands were tied, threw himself into the sea,\r\nwhilst the other did so during the morning watch.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight two _almadias_, with many men in them, approached. The\r\n_almadias_ stood off whilst the men entered the water, some swimming\r\nin the direction of the _Berrio_, others in that of the _Raphael_.\r\nThose who swam to the _Berrio_ began to cut the cable. The men on watch\r\nthought at first that they were tunny fish, but when they perceived\r\ntheir mistake they shouted to the other vessels. The other swimmers had\r\nalready got hold of the rigging of the mizzen-mast. Seeing themselves\r\ndiscovered, they silently slipped down and fled. These and other wicked\r\ntricks were practised upon us by these dogs, but our Lord did not\r\nallow them to succeed, because they were unbelievers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tower at Mombasa.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph by Sir John Kirk._)]\r\n\r\nMombaça is a large city seated upon an eminence washed by the sea. Its\r\nport is entered daily by numerous vessels. At its entrance stands a\r\npillar, and by the sea a low-lying fortress.[119] Those who had gone on\r\nshore told us that in the town they had seen many men in irons; and it\r\nseemed to us that these must be Christians, as the Christians in that\r\ncountry are at war with the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe Christian merchants in the town are only temporary residents, and\r\nare held in much subjection, they not being allowed to do anything\r\nexcept by the order of the Moorish King.\r\n\r\nIt pleased God in his mercy that on arriving at this city all our sick\r\nrecovered their health, for the climate (“air”) of this place is very\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAfter the malice and treachery planned by these dogs had been\r\ndiscovered, we still remained on Wednesday and Thursday [April 11 and\r\n12].[120]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Mombaça to Malindi._]\r\n\r\nWe left in the morning [April 13], the wind being light, and anchored\r\nabout eight leagues from Mombaça, close to the shore. At break of day\r\n[April 14] we saw two boats (_barcas_) about three leagues to the\r\nleeward, in the open sea, and at once gave chase, with the intention of\r\ncapturing them, for we wanted to secure a pilot who would guide us to\r\nwhere we wanted to go. At vesper-time we came up with one of them, and\r\ncaptured it, the other escaping towards the land. In the one we took we\r\nfound seventeen men, besides gold, silver, and an abundance of maize\r\nand other provisions; as also a young woman, who was the wife of an old\r\nMoor of distinction, who was a passenger. When we came up with the boat\r\nthey all threw themselves into the water, but we picked them up from\r\nour boats.\r\n\r\nThat same day [April 14] at sunset, we cast anchor off a place called\r\nMilinde (Malindi),[121] which is thirty leagues from Mombaça. The\r\nfollowing places are between Mombaça and Milinde, viz., Benapa, Toça\r\nand Nuguoquioniete.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Malindi._][123]\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday [April 15] the Moors whom we had taken in the boat\r\ntold us that there were at this city of Melinde four vessels belonging\r\nto Christians from India,[124] and that if it pleased us to take them\r\nthere, they would provide us, instead of them, Christian pilots and\r\nall we stood in need of, including water, wood and other things. The\r\ncaptain-major much desired to have pilots from the country, and having\r\ndiscussed the matter with his Moorish prisoners, he cast anchor off\r\nthe town, at a distance of about half a league from the mainland. The\r\ninhabitants of the town did not venture to come aboard our ships, for\r\nthey had already learnt that we had captured a vessel and made her\r\noccupants prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning [April 16] the captain-major had the old Moor\r\ntaken to a sandbank in front of the town, where he was picked up by\r\nan _almadia_.[125] The Moor explained to the king the wishes of the\r\ncaptain-major, and how much he desired to make peace with him. After\r\ndinner the Moor came back in a _zavra_, accompanied by one of the\r\nking’s cavaliers and a sharif: he also brought three sheep. These\r\nmessengers told the captain-general that the king would rejoice to make\r\npeace with him, and to enter into friendly relations; that he would\r\nwillingly grant to the captain-major all his country afforded, whether\r\npilots or anything else. The captain-major upon this sent word that\r\nhe proposed to enter the port on the following day, and forwarded by\r\nthe king’s messengers a present consisting of a _balandrau_,[126] two\r\nstrings of coral, three wash-hand basins, a hat, little bells and two\r\npieces of _lambel_.[127]\r\n\r\nConsequently, on Tuesday [April 17] we approached nearer to the town.\r\nThe king sent the captain-major six sheep, besides quantities of\r\ncloves, cumin, ginger, nutmeg and pepper, as also a message, telling\r\nhim that if he desired to have an interview with him he (the king)\r\nwould come out in his _zavra_, when the captain-major could meet him in\r\na boat.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday [April 18], after dinner, when the king came up close to\r\nthe ships in a _zavra_, the captain-major at once entered one of his\r\nboats, which had been well furnished, and many friendly words were\r\nexchanged when they lay side by side. The king having invited the\r\ncaptain-major to come to his house to rest, after which he (the king)\r\nwould visit him on board his ship, the captain-major said that he was\r\nnot permitted by his master to go on land, and if he were to do so a\r\nbad report would be given of him. The king wanted to know what would be\r\nsaid of himself by his people if he were to visit the ships, and what\r\naccount could he render them? He then asked for the name of our king,\r\nwhich was written down for him, and said that on our return he would\r\nsend an ambassador with us, or a letter.\r\n\r\nWhen both had said all they desired, the captain-major sent for the\r\nMoors whom he had taken prisoner, and surrendered them all. This gave\r\nmuch satisfaction to the king, who said that he valued this act more\r\nhighly than if he had been presented with a town. And the king, much\r\npleased, made the circuit of our ships, the bombards of which fired a\r\nsalute. About three hours were spent in this way. When the king went\r\naway he left in the ship one of his sons and a sharif, and took two of\r\nus away with him, to whom he desired to show his palace. He, moreover,\r\ntold the captain that as he would not go ashore he would himself return\r\non the following day to the beach, and would order his horsemen to go\r\nthrough some exercises.\r\n\r\nThe king wore a robe (royal cloak) of damask trimmed with green satin,\r\nand a rich _touca_. He was seated on two cushioned chairs of bronze,\r\nbeneath a round sunshade of crimson satin attached to a pole. An old\r\nman, who attended him as page, carried a short sword in a silver\r\nsheath. There were many players on _anafils_, and two trumpets of\r\nivory,[128] richly carved, and of the size of a man, which were blown\r\nfrom a hole in the side, and made sweet harmony with the _anafils_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Siwa Blower.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph by Sir John Kirk._)]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday [April 19] the captain-major and Nicolau Coelho rowed along\r\nthe front of the town, bombards having been placed in the poops of\r\ntheir long-boats. Many people were along the shore, and among them two\r\nhorsemen, who appeared to take much delight in a sham-fight. The king\r\nwas carried in a palanquin from the stone steps of his palace to the\r\nside of the captain-major’s boats. He again begged the captain to come\r\nashore, as he had a helpless father who wanted to see him, and that\r\nhe and his sons would go on board the ships as hostages. The captain,\r\nhowever, excused himself.[129]\r\n\r\nWe found here four vessels belonging to Indian Christians. When\r\nthey came for the first time on board Paulo da Gama’s ship, the\r\ncaptain-major being there at the time, they were shown an altar-piece\r\nrepresenting Our Lady at the foot of the cross, with Jesus Christ in\r\nher arms and the apostles around her. When the Indians saw this picture\r\nthey prostrated themselves, and as long as we were there they came to\r\nsay their prayers in front of it, bringing offerings of cloves, pepper,\r\nand other things.[130]\r\n\r\nThese Indians are tawny men; they wear but little clothing and have\r\nlong beards and long hair, which they braid. They told us that they ate\r\nno beef. Their language differs from that of the Arabs, but some of\r\nthem know a little of it, as they hold much intercourse with them.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which the captain-major went up to the town in the boats,\r\nthese Christian Indians fired off many bombards from their vessels,\r\nand when they saw him pass they raised their hands and shouted lustily\r\n_Christ! Christ!_[131]\r\n\r\nThat same night they asked the king’s permission to give us a\r\nnight-fête. And when night came they fired off many bombards, sent up\r\nrockets, and raised loud shouts.\r\n\r\nThese Indians warned the captain-major against going on shore, and told\r\nhim not to trust to their “fanfares”, as they neither came from their\r\nhearts nor from their good will.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, the 22nd of April, the king’s _zavra_ brought\r\non board one of his confidential servants, and as two days had passed\r\nwithout any visitors, the captain-major had this man seized, and sent\r\nword to the king that he required the pilots whom he had promised. The\r\nking, when he received this message, sent a Christian pilot,[132] and\r\nthe captain-major allowed the gentleman, whom he had retained in his\r\nvessel, to go away.\r\n\r\nWe were much pleased with the Christian pilot whom the king had sent\r\nus. We learnt from him that the island of which we heard at Moçambique\r\nas being inhabited by Christians was in reality an island subject to\r\nthis same King of Moçambique; that half of it belonged to the Moors and\r\nthe other half to the Christians; that many pearls were to be found\r\nthere, and that it was called Quyluee.[133] This is the island the\r\nMoorish pilots wanted to take us to, and we also wished to go there,\r\nfor we believed that what they said was true.\r\n\r\nThe town of Malindi lies in a bay and extends along the shore. It\r\nmay be likened to Alcouchette.[134] Its houses are lofty and well\r\nwhite-washed, and have many windows; on the landside are palm-groves,\r\nand all around it maize and vegetables are being cultivated.\r\n\r\nWe remained in front of this town during nine days,[135] and all this\r\ntime we had fêtes, sham-fights, and musical performances (“fanfares”).\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Across the Gulf—the Arabian Sea._]\r\n\r\nWe left Malindi on Tuesday, the 24th of the month [of April] for a city\r\ncalled Qualecut [Calecut], with the pilot whom the king had given us.\r\nThe coast there runs north and south, and the land encloses a huge bay\r\nwith a strait. In this bay,[136] we were told, were to be found many\r\nlarge cities of Christians and Moors, including one called Quambay\r\n[Cambay], as also six-hundred known islands, and within it the Red Sea\r\nand the “house” [Kaabah] of Mecca.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday [April 29] we once more saw the North Star,\r\nwhich we had not seen for a long time.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 18th of May,[137] after having seen no land for\r\ntwenty-three days,[138] we sighted lofty mountains, and having all\r\nthis time sailed before the wind we could not have made less than 600\r\nleagues. The land, when first sighted,[139] was at a distance of eight\r\nleagues, and our lead reached bottom at forty-five fathoms. That same\r\nnight we took a course to the S.S.W., so as to get away from the coast.\r\nOn the following day [May 19] we again approached the land, but owing\r\nto the heavy rain and a thunderstorm,[140] which prevailed whilst we\r\nwere sailing along the coast, our pilot was unable to identify the\r\nexact locality. On Sunday [May 20] we found ourselves close to some\r\nmountains,[141] and when we were near enough for the pilot to recognise\r\nthem he told us that they were above Calecut, and that this was the\r\ncountry we desired to go to.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Calecut._]\r\n\r\n[_Arrival._] That night [May 20] we anchored two leagues from the city\r\nof Calecut, and we did so because our pilot mistook _Capua_,[142] a\r\ntown at that place, for Calecut. Still further[143] there is another\r\ntown called _Pandarani_.[144] We anchored about a league and a half\r\nfrom the shore. After we were at anchor, four boats (_almadias_)\r\napproached us from the land, who asked of what nation we were. We told\r\nthem, and they then pointed out Calecut to us.\r\n\r\nOn the following day [May 21] these same boats came again alongside,\r\nwhen the captain-major sent one of the convicts[145] to Calecut, and\r\nthose with whom he went took him to two Moors from Tunis, who could\r\nspeak Castilian and Genoese.[146] The first greeting that he received\r\nwas in these words: “May the Devil take thee! What brought you hither?”\r\nThey asked what he sought so far away from home, and he told them that\r\nwe came in search of Christians and of spices. They said: “Why does not\r\nthe King of Castile, the King of France, or the Signoria of Venice\r\nsend hither?” He said that the King of Portugal would not consent\r\nto their doing so, and they said he did the right thing. After this\r\nconversation they took him to their lodgings and gave him wheaten bread\r\nand honey. When he had eaten he returned to the ships, accompanied\r\nby one of the Moors, who was, no sooner on board, than he said these\r\nwords: “A lucky venture, a lucky venture! Plenty of rubies, plenty of\r\nemeralds! You owe great thanks to God, for having brought you to a\r\ncountry holding such riches!” We were greatly astonished to hear his\r\ntalk, for we never expected to hear our language spoken so far away\r\nfrom Portugal.[147]\r\n\r\n[_A description of Calecut._] The city of Calecut is inhabited by\r\nChristians. They are of a tawny complexion. Some of them have big\r\nbeards and long hair, whilst others clip their hair short or shave the\r\nhead, merely allowing a tuft to remain on the crown as a sign that they\r\nare Christians. They also wear moustaches. They pierce the ears and\r\nwear much gold in them. They go naked down to the waist, covering their\r\nlower extremities with very fine cotton stuffs. But it is only the\r\nmost respectable who do this, for the others manage as best they are\r\nable.[148]\r\n\r\nThe women of this country, as a rule, are ugly and of small stature.\r\nThey wear many jewels of gold round the neck, numerous bracelets on\r\ntheir arms, and rings set with precious stones on their toes. All\r\nthese people are well-disposed and apparently of mild temper. At first\r\nsight they seem covetous and ignorant.\r\n\r\n[_A messenger sent to the King_]. When we arrived at Calecut the king\r\nwas fifteen leagues away.[149] The captain-major sent two men[150] to\r\nhim with a message, informing him that an ambassador had arrived from\r\nthe King of Portugal with letters, and that if he desired it he would\r\ntake them to where the king then was.\r\n\r\nThe king presented the bearers of this message with much fine cloth. He\r\nsent word to the captain bidding him welcome, saying that he was about\r\nto proceed to Qualecut (Calecut). As a matter of fact, he started at\r\nonce with a large retinue.\r\n\r\n[_At Anchor at Pandarani_, May 27]. A pilot accompanied our two men,\r\nwith orders to take us to a place called Pandarani, below the place\r\n[Capua] where we anchored at first. At this time we were actually in\r\nfront of the city of Calecut. We were told that the anchorage at the\r\nplace to which we were to go was good, whilst at the place we were\r\nthen it was bad, with a stony bottom, which was quite true;[151] and,\r\nmoreover, that it was customary for the ships which came to this\r\ncountry to anchor there for the sake of safety. We ourselves did not\r\nfeel comfortable, and the captain-major had no sooner received this\r\nroyal message than he ordered the sails to be set, and we departed. We\r\ndid not, however, anchor as near the shore as the king’s pilot desired.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at anchor, a message arrived informing the captain-major\r\nthat the king was already in the city. At the same time the king sent\r\na _bale_,[152] with other men of distinction, to Pandarani, to conduct\r\nthe captain-major to where the king awaited him. This _bale_ is like\r\nan _alcaide_, and is always attended by two hundred men armed with\r\nswords and bucklers. As it was late when this message arrived, the\r\ncaptain-major deferred going.\r\n\r\n[_Gama goes to Calecut._] On the following morning, which was Monday,\r\nMay 28th, the captain-major set out to speak to the king, and took with\r\nhim thirteen men, of whom I was one.[153] We put on our best attire,\r\nplaced bombards in our boats, and took with us trumpets and many flags.\r\nOn landing, the captain-major was received by the _alcaide_, with\r\nwhom were many men, armed and unarmed. The reception was friendly,\r\nas if the people were pleased to see us, though at first appearances\r\nlooked threatening, for they carried naked swords in their hands. A\r\npalanquin was provided for the captain-major, such as is used by men\r\nof distinction in that country, as also by some of the merchants,\r\nwho pay something to the king for this privilege. The captain-major\r\nentered the palanquin, which was carried by six men by turns. Attended\r\nby all these people we took the road of Qualecut, and came first to\r\nanother town, called Capua. The captain-major was there deposited at\r\nthe house of a man of rank, whilst we others were provided with food,\r\nconsisting of rice, with much butter, and excellent boiled fish. The\r\ncaptain-major did not wish to eat, and when we had done so, we embarked\r\non a river close by, which flows between the sea and the mainland,\r\nclose to the coast.[154] The two boats in which we embarked were lashed\r\ntogether,[155] so that we were not separated. There were numerous other\r\nboats, all crowded with people. As to those who were on the banks I say\r\nnothing; their number was infinite, and they had all come to see us. We\r\nwent up that river for about a league, and saw many large ships drawn\r\nup high and dry on its banks, for there is no port here.\r\n\r\nWhen we disembarked, the captain-major once more entered his palanquin.\r\nThe road was crowded with a countless multitude anxious to see us. Even\r\nthe women came out of their houses with children in their arms and\r\nfollowed us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Krishna nursed by Devaki.]\r\n\r\n[_Christian Church._][156] When we arrived [at Calecut] they took us to\r\na large church, and this is what we saw:—\r\n\r\nThe body of the church is as large as a monastery, all built of hewn\r\nstone and covered with tiles. At the main entrance rises a pillar of\r\nbronze as high as a mast, on the top of which was perched a bird,\r\napparently a cock. In addition to this, there was another pillar\r\nas high as a man, and very stout. In the centre of the body of the\r\nchurch rose a chapel,[157] all built of hewn stone, with a bronze door\r\nsufficiently wide for a man to pass, and stone steps leading up to it.\r\nWithin this sanctuary stood a small image which they said represented\r\nOur Lady.[158] Along the walls, by the main entrance, hung seven small\r\nbells.[159] In this church the captain-major said his prayers, and we\r\nwith him.[160]\r\n\r\nWe did not go within the chapel, for it is the custom that only certain\r\nservants of the church, called _quafees_,[161] should enter. These\r\n_quafees_ wore some threads passing over the left shoulder and under\r\nthe right arm, in the same manner as our deacons wear the stole. They\r\nthrew holy water over us, and gave us some white earth,[162] which\r\nthe Christians of this country are in the habit of putting on their\r\nforeheads, breasts, around the neck, and on the forearms. They threw\r\nholy water upon the captain-major and gave him some of the earth,\r\nwhich he gave in charge of someone, giving them to understand that he\r\nwould put it on later.\r\n\r\nMany other saints were painted on the walls of the church, wearing\r\ncrowns. They were painted variously, with teeth protruding an inch from\r\nthe mouth, and four or five arms.\r\n\r\nBelow this church there was a large masonry tank, similar to many\r\nothers which we had seen along the road.\r\n\r\n[_Progress through the Town._] After we had left that place, and had\r\narrived at the entrance to the city [of Calecut] we were shown another\r\nchurch, where we saw things like those described above. Here the crowd\r\ngrew so dense that progress along the street became next to impossible,\r\nand for this reason they put the captain into a house, and us with him.\r\n\r\nThe king sent a brother of the _bale_, who was a lord of this\r\ncountry, to accompany the captain, and he was attended by men beating\r\ndrums, blowing _anafils_ and bagpipes, and firing off matchlocks. In\r\nconducting the captain they showed us much respect, more than is shown\r\nin Spain to a king. The number of people was countless, for in addition\r\nto those who surrounded us, and among whom there were two thousand\r\narmed men, they crowded the roofs and houses.\r\n\r\n[_The King’s Palace._][163] The further we advanced in the direction\r\nof the king’s palace, the more did they increase in number. And when\r\nwe arrived there, men of much distinction and great lords came out to\r\nmeet the captain, and joined those who were already in attendance upon\r\nhim. It was then an hour before sunset. When we reached the palace we\r\npassed through a gate into a courtyard of great size, and before we\r\narrived at where the king was, we passed four doors, through which we\r\nhad to force our way, giving many blows to the people. When, at last,\r\nwe reached the door where the king was, there came forth from it a\r\nlittle old man, who holds a position resembling that of a bishop, and\r\nwhose advice the king acts upon in all affairs of the church. This man\r\nembraced the captain when he entered the door. Several men were wounded\r\nat this door,[164] and we only got in by the use of much force.\r\n\r\n[_A Royal Audience, May 28._][165] The king was in a small court,\r\nreclining upon a couch covered with a cloth of green velvet, above\r\nwhich was a good mattress, and upon this again a sheet of cotton stuff,\r\nvery white and fine, more so than any linen. The cushions were after\r\nthe same fashion. In his left hand the king held a very large golden\r\ncup [spittoon], having a capacity of half an almude [8 pints]. At its\r\nmouth this cup was two palmas [16 inches] wide, and apparently it was\r\nmassive. Into this cup the king threw the husks of a certain herb\r\nwhich is chewed by the people of this country because of its soothing\r\neffects, and which they call _atambor_.[166] On the right side of the\r\nking stood a basin of gold, so large that a man might just encircle\r\nit with his arms: this contained the herbs. There were likewise many\r\nsilver jugs. The canopy above the couch was all gilt.\r\n\r\nThe captain, on entering, saluted in the manner of the country: by\r\nputting the hands together, then raising them towards Heaven, as is\r\ndone by Christians when addressing God, and immediately afterwards\r\nopening them and shutting the fists quickly. The king beckoned to\r\nthe captain with his right hand to come nearer, but the captain did\r\nnot approach him, for it is the custom of the country for no man to\r\napproach the king except only the servant who hands him the herbs, and\r\nwhen anyone addresses the king he holds his hand before the mouth, and\r\nremains at a distance. When the king beckoned to the captain he looked\r\nat us others, and ordered us to be seated on a stone bench near him,\r\nwhere he could see us. He ordered that water for our hands should be\r\ngiven us, as also some fruit, one kind of which resembled a melon,\r\nexcept that its outside was rough and the inside sweet, whilst another\r\nkind of fruit resembled a fig, and tasted very nice.[167] There were\r\nmen who prepared these fruits for us; and the king looked at us eating,\r\nand smiled; and talked to the servant who stood near him supplying him\r\nwith the herbs referred to.\r\n\r\nThen, throwing his eyes on the captain, who sat facing him, he invited\r\nhim to address himself to the courtiers present, saying they were men\r\nof much distinction, that he could tell them whatever he desired to\r\nsay, and they would repeat it to him (the king). The captain-major\r\nreplied that he was the ambassador of the King of Portugal, and the\r\nbearer of a message which he could only deliver to him personally. The\r\nking said this was good, and immediately asked him to be conducted to\r\na chamber. When the captain-major had entered, the king, too, rose and\r\njoined him, whilst we remained where we were.[168] All this happened\r\nabout sunset. An old man who was in the court took away the couch as\r\nsoon as the king rose, but allowed the plate to remain. The king, when\r\nhe joined the captain, threw himself upon another couch, covered with\r\nvarious stuffs embroidered in gold, and asked the captain what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nAnd the captain told him he was the ambassador of a King of Portugal,\r\nwho was Lord of many countries and the possessor of great wealth of\r\nevery description, exceeding that of any king of these parts; that for\r\na period of sixty years his ancestors had annually sent out vessels to\r\nmake discoveries in the direction of India, as they knew that there\r\nwere Christian kings there like themselves. This, he said, was the\r\nreason which induced them to order this country to be discovered, not\r\nbecause they sought for gold or silver, for of this they had such\r\nabundance that they needed not what was to be found in this country.\r\nHe further stated that the captains sent out travelled for a year\r\nor two, until their provisions were exhausted, and then returned to\r\nPortugal, without having succeeded in making the desired discovery.\r\nThere reigned a king now whose name was Dom Manuel, who had ordered him\r\nto build three vessels, of which he had been appointed captain-major,\r\nand who had ordered him not to return to Portugal until he should have\r\ndiscovered this King of the Christians, on pain of having his head cut\r\noff. That two letters[169] had been intrusted to him to be presented\r\nin case he succeeded in discovering him, and that he would do so on\r\nthe ensuing day; and, finally, he had been instructed to say by word\r\nof mouth that he [the King of Portugal] desired to be his friend and\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this the king said that he was welcome; that, on his part,\r\nhe held him as a friend and brother, and would send ambassadors with\r\nhim to Portugal. This latter had been asked as a favour, the captain\r\npretending that he would not dare to present himself before his king\r\nand master unless he was able to present, at the same time, some men of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThese and many other things passed between the two in this chamber,\r\nand as it was already late in the night, the king asked the captain\r\nwith whom he desired to lodge, with Christians or with Moors? And the\r\ncaptain replied, neither with Christians nor with Moors, and begged as\r\na favour that he be given a lodging by himself. The king said he would\r\norder it thus, upon which the captain took leave of the king and came\r\nto where we were, that is, to a veranda lit up by a huge candlestick.\r\nBy that time four hours of the night had already gone.[170]\r\n\r\n[_A Night’s Lodging._] We then all went forth with the captain in\r\nsearch of our lodgings, and a countless crowd with us. And the rain\r\npoured down so heavily that the streets ran with water. The captain\r\nwent on the back of six men [in a palanquin], and the time occupied\r\nin passing through the city was so long that the captain at last grew\r\ntired, and complained to the king’s factor, a Moor of distinction,\r\nwho attended him to the lodgings. The Moor then took him to his own\r\nhouse,[171] and we were admitted to a court within it, where there was\r\na veranda roofed in with tiles. Many carpets had been spread, and there\r\nwere two large candlesticks like those at the Royal palace. At the top\r\nof each of these were great iron lamps, fed with oil or butter, and\r\neach lamp had four wicks, which gave much light. These lamps they use\r\ninstead of torches.\r\n\r\nThis same Moor then had a horse brought for the captain to take him to\r\nhis lodgings, but it was without a saddle, and the captain refused to\r\nmount it.[172] We then started for our lodgings, and when we arrived\r\nwe found there some of our men [who had come from the ships] with the\r\ncaptain’s bed, and with numerous other things which the captain had\r\nbrought as presents for the king.[173]\r\n\r\n[_Presents for the King._] On Tuesday [May 29] the captain got ready\r\nthe following things to be sent to the king, viz., twelve pieces of\r\n_lambel_,[174] four scarlet hoods, six hats, four strings of coral, a\r\ncase containing six wash-hand basins, a case of sugar, two casks of\r\noil, and two of honey. And as it is the custom not to send anything\r\nto the king without the knowledge of the Moor, his factor, and of the\r\n_bale_, the captain informed them of his intention. They came, and\r\nwhen they saw the present they laughed at it, saying that it was not\r\na thing to offer to a king, that the poorest merchant from Mecca, or\r\nany other part of India, gave more, and that if he wanted to make a\r\npresent it should be in gold, as the king would not accept such things.\r\nWhen the captain heard this he grew sad, and said that he had brought\r\nno gold, that, moreover, he was no merchant, but an ambassador; that\r\nhe gave of that which he had, which was his own [private gift] and\r\nnot the king’s;[175] that if the King of Portugal ordered him to\r\nreturn he would intrust him with far richer presents; and that if King\r\nCamolim[176] would not accept these things he would send them back to\r\nthe ships. Upon this they declared that they would not forward his\r\npresents, nor consent to his forwarding them himself. When they had\r\ngone there came certain Moorish merchants, and they all depreciated the\r\npresent which the captain desired to be sent to the king.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain saw that they were determined not to forward his\r\npresent, he said, that as they would not allow him to send his present\r\nto the palace he would go to speak to the king, and would then return\r\nto the ships. They approved of this, and told him that if he would\r\nwait a short time they would return and accompany him to the palace.\r\nAnd the captain waited all day, but they never came back. The captain\r\nwas very wroth at being among so phlegmatic and unreliable a people,\r\nand intended, at first, to go to the palace without them. On further\r\nconsideration, however, he thought it best to wait until the following\r\nday. As to us others, we diverted ourselves, singing and dancing to the\r\nsound of trumpets, and enjoyed ourselves much.\r\n\r\n[_A Second Audience, May 30._] On Wednesday morning the Moors returned,\r\nand took the captain to the palace, and us others with him. The palace\r\nwas crowded with armed men. Our captain was kept waiting with his\r\nconductors for fully four long hours, outside a door, which was only\r\nopened when the king sent word to admit him, attended by two men only,\r\nwhom he might select. The captain said that he desired to have Fernão\r\nMartins with him, who could interpret, and his secretary.[177] It\r\nseemed to him, as it did to us, that this separation portended no good.\r\n\r\nWhen he had entered, the king said that he had expected him on Tuesday.\r\nThe captain said that the long road had tired him, and that for this\r\nreason he had not come to see him. The king then said that he had told\r\nhim that he came from a very rich kingdom, and yet had brought him\r\nnothing; that he had also told him that he was the bearer of a letter,\r\nwhich had not yet been delivered. To this the captain rejoined that he\r\nhad brought nothing, because the object of his voyage was merely to\r\nmake discoveries, but that when other ships came he would then see what\r\nthey brought him; as to the letter, it was true that he had brought\r\none, and would deliver it immediately.\r\n\r\nThe king then asked what it was he had come to discover: stones or men?\r\nIf he came to discover men, as he said, why had he brought nothing?\r\nMoreover, he had been told that he carried with him the golden image of\r\na Santa Maria. The captain said that the Santa Maria was not of gold,\r\nand that even if she were he would not part with her, as she had guided\r\nhim across the ocean, and would guide him back to his own country. The\r\nking then asked for the letter. The captain said that he begged as a\r\nfavour, that as the Moors wished him ill and might misinterpret him, a\r\nChristian able to speak Arabic should be sent for. The king said this\r\nwas well, and at once sent for a young man, of small stature, whose\r\nname was Quaram. The captain then said that he had two letters, one\r\nwritten in his own language and the other in that of the Moors; that\r\nhe was able to read the former, and knew that it contained nothing but\r\nwhat would prove acceptable; but that as to the other he was unable to\r\nread it, and it might be good, or contain something that was erroneous.\r\nAs the Christian was unable to _read_ Moorish, four Moors took the\r\nletter and read it between them, after which they translated it to the\r\nking, who was well satisfied with its contents.\r\n\r\nThe king then asked what kind of merchandise was to be found in his\r\ncountry. The captain said there was much corn, cloth, iron, bronze, and\r\nmany other things. The king asked whether he had any merchandise with\r\nhim. The captain replied that he had a little of each sort, as samples,\r\nand that if permitted to return to the ships he would order it to be\r\nlanded, and that meantime four or five men would remain at the lodgings\r\nassigned them. The king said no! He might take all his people with him,\r\nsecurely moor his ships, land his merchandise, and sell it to the best\r\nadvantage. Having taken leave of the king the captain returned to his\r\nlodgings, and we with him. As it was already late no attempt was made\r\nto depart that night.\r\n\r\n[_Return to Pandarani, May 31._] On Thursday morning a horse without\r\na saddle was brought to the captain, who declined to mount it, asking\r\nthat a horse of the country, that is a palanquin, might be provided, as\r\nhe could not ride a horse without a saddle. He was then taken to the\r\nhouse of a wealthy merchant of the name of Guzerate,[178] who ordered a\r\npalanquin to be got ready. On its arrival the captain started at once\r\nfor Pandarani, where our ships were, many people following him. We\r\nothers, not being able to keep up with him, were left behind. Trudging\r\nthus along we were overtaken by the _bale_, who passed on to join the\r\ncaptain. We lost our way, and wandered far inland, but the _bale_ sent\r\na man after us, who put us on the right road. When we reached Pandarani\r\nwe found the captain inside a rest-house, of which there were many\r\nalong the road, so that travellers and wayfarers might find protection\r\nagainst the rain.\r\n\r\n[_Detention at Pandarani, May 31 to June 2._] The _bale_ and many\r\nothers were with the captain. On our arrival the captain asked the\r\n_bale_ for an _almadia_, so that we might go to our ships; but the\r\n_bale_ and the others said that it was already late—in fact, the sun\r\nhad set—and that he should go next day. The captain said that unless\r\nhe provided an _almadia_ he would return to the king, who had given\r\norders to take him back to the ships, whilst they tried to detain him—a\r\nvery bad thing, as he was a Christian like themselves. When they saw\r\nthe dark looks of the captain they said he was at liberty to depart at\r\nonce, and that they would give him thirty _almadias_ if he needed them.\r\nThey then took us along the beach, and as it seemed to the captain\r\nthat they harboured some evil design, he sent three men in advance,\r\nwith orders that in case they found the ship’s boats and his brother,\r\nto tell him to conceal himself. They went, and finding nothing, turned\r\nback; but as we had been taken in another direction we did not meet.\r\n\r\nThey then took us to the house of a Moor—for it was already far in\r\nthe night—and when we got there they told us that they would go in\r\nsearch of the three men who had not yet returned. When they were\r\ngone, the captain ordered fowls and rice to be purchased, and we ate,\r\nnotwithstanding our fatigue, having been all day on our legs.\r\n\r\nThose who had gone [in search of the three men] only returned in the\r\nmorning, and the captain said that after all they seemed well disposed\r\ntowards us, and had acted with the best intentions when they objected\r\nto our departure the day before. On the other hand we suspected them\r\non account of what had happened at Calecut, and looked upon them as\r\nill-disposed.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned [June 1] the captain again asked for boats to take\r\nhim to his ships. They then began to whisper among themselves, and said\r\nthat we should have them if we would order our vessels to come nearer\r\nthe shore. The captain said that if he ordered his vessels to approach\r\nhis brother would think that he was being held a prisoner, and that he\r\ngave this order on compulsion, and would hoist the sails and return\r\nto Portugal. They said that if we refused to order the ships to come\r\nnearer we should not be permitted to embark. The captain said that King\r\nÇamolin had sent him back to his ships, and that as they would not\r\nlet him go, as ordered by the king, he should return to the king, who\r\nwas a Christian like himself. If the king would not let him go, and\r\nwanted him to remain in his country, he would do so with much pleasure.\r\nThey agreed that he should be permitted to go, but afforded him no\r\nopportunity for doing so, for they immediately closed all the doors,\r\nand many armed men entered to guard us, none of us being allowed to go\r\noutside without being accompanied by several of these guards.\r\n\r\nThey then asked us to give up our sails and rudders. The captain\r\ndeclared that he would give up none of these things: King Çamolin\r\nhaving unconditionally ordered him to return to his ships, they might\r\ndo with him whatever they liked, but he would give up nothing.\r\n\r\nThe captain and we others felt very down-hearted, though outwardly we\r\npretended not to notice what they did. The captain said that as they\r\nrefused him permission to go back, they would at least allow his men\r\nto do so, as at the place they were in they would die of hunger. But\r\nthey said that we must remain where we were, and that if we died of\r\nhunger we must bear it, as they cared nothing for that. Whilst thus\r\ndetained, one of the men whom we had missed the night before turned\r\nup. He told the captain that Nicolau Coelho had been awaiting him\r\nwith the boats since last night. When the captain heard this he sent\r\na man away secretly to Nicolau Coelho, because of the guards by whom\r\nwe were surrounded, with orders to go back to the ships and place\r\nthem in a secure place. Nicolau Coelho, on receipt of this message,\r\ndeparted forthwith. But our guards having information of what was\r\ngoing on, at once launched a large number of _almadias_ and pursued\r\nhim for a short distance. When they found that they could not overtake\r\nhim they returned to the captain, whom they asked to write a letter\r\nto his brother, requesting him to bring the ships nearer to the land\r\nand further within the port [roadstead]. The captain said he was quite\r\nwilling, but that his brother would not do this; and that even if he\r\nconsented those who were with him, not being willing to die, would not\r\ndo so. But they asked how this could be, as they knew well that any\r\norder he gave would be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe captain did not wish the ships to come within the port, for it\r\nseemed to him—as it did to us—that once inside they could easily be\r\ncaptured, after which they would first kill him, and then us others, as\r\nwe were already in their power.\r\n\r\nWe passed all that day most anxiously. At night more people surrounded\r\nus than ever before, and we were no longer allowed to walk in the\r\ncompound, within which we were, but confined within a small tiled\r\ncourt, with a multitude of people around us. We quite expected that\r\non the following day we should be separated, or that some harm would\r\nbefall us, for we noticed that our gaolers were much annoyed with us.\r\nThis, however, did not prevent our making a good supper off the things\r\nfound in the village. Throughout that night we were guarded by over\r\na hundred men, all armed with swords, two-edged battleaxes,[179]\r\nshields, and bows and arrows. Whilst some of these slept, others kept\r\nguard, each taking his turn of duty throughout the night.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Saturday, June 2, in the morning, these gentlemen\r\n[_i.e._, the _bale_ and others] came back, and this time they “wore\r\nbetter faces.” They told the captain that as he had informed the king\r\nthat he intended to land his merchandise, he should now give orders to\r\nhave this done, as it was the custom of the country that every ship on\r\nits arrival should at once land the merchandise it brought, as also the\r\ncrews, and that the vendors should not return on board until the whole\r\nof it had been sold. The captain consented, and said he would write to\r\nhis brother to see to its being done. They said this was well, and that\r\nimmediately after the arrival of the merchandise he would be permitted\r\nto return to his ship. The captain at once wrote to his brother to send\r\nhim certain things, and he did so at once. On their receipt the captain\r\nwas allowed to go on board, two men remaining behind with the things\r\nthat had been landed.[180]\r\n\r\nAt this we rejoiced greatly, and rendered thanks to God for having\r\nextricated us from the hands of people who had no more sense than\r\nbeasts, for we knew well that once the captain was on board those who\r\nhad been landed would have nothing to fear. When the captain reached\r\nhis ship he ordered that no more merchandise should be sent.\r\n\r\n[_The Portuguese Merchandise at Pandarani, June 2-23._]\r\n\r\nFive days afterwards [on June 7] the captain sent word to the king\r\nthat, although he had sent him straight back to his ships, certain of\r\nhis people had detained him a night and a day on the road; that he had\r\nlanded his merchandise as he had been ordered, but that the Moors only\r\ncame to depreciate it; and that for these reasons he looked forward\r\nto what he (the king) would order; that he placed no value upon this\r\nmerchandise, but that he and his ships were at his service. The king at\r\nonce sent word saying that those who acted thus were bad Christians,\r\nand that he would punish them. He, at the same time, sent seven or\r\neight merchants to inspect the merchandise, and to become purchasers if\r\nthey felt inclined. He also sent a man of quality to remain with the\r\nfactor already there, and authorised them to kill any Moor who might go\r\nthere, without fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nThe merchants whom the king had sent remained about eight days, but\r\ninstead of buying they depreciated the merchandise. The Moors no longer\r\nvisited the house where the merchandise was, but they bore us no\r\ngood-will, and when one of us landed they spat on the ground, saying:\r\n“Portugal, Portugal.” Indeed from the very first they had sought means\r\nto take and kill us.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain found that the merchandise found no buyers at that\r\nplace, he applied to the king for permission to forward it to Calecut.\r\nThe king at once ordered the _bale_ to get a sufficient number of men\r\nwho were to carry the whole on their backs to Calecut, this to be done\r\nat his expense, as nothing belonging to the King of Portugal was to\r\nbe burthened with expenses whilst in his country. But all this was\r\ndone because it was intended to do us some ill-turn, for it had been\r\nreported to the king that we were thieves and went about to steal.\r\nNevertheless, he did all this in the manner shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Merchandise removed to Calecut, June 24._]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 24th of June, being the day of St. John the Baptist,\r\nthe merchandise left for Calecut. The captain then ordered that all\r\nour people should visit that town by turns, and in the following\r\nmanner:—Each ship was to send a man ashore, on whose return another\r\nshould be sent. In this way all would have their turn, and would be\r\nable to make such purchases as they desired. These men were made\r\nwelcome by the Christians along the road, who showed much pleasure\r\nwhen one of them entered a house, to eat or to sleep, and they gave\r\nthem freely of all they had. At the same time many men came on board\r\nour ships to sell us fish in exchange for bread, and they were made\r\nwelcome by us. Many of them were accompanied by their sons and little\r\nchildren, and the captain ordered that they should be fed. All this was\r\ndone for the sake of establishing relations of peace and amity, and to\r\ninduce them to speak well of us and not evil. So great was the number\r\nof these visitors that sometimes it was night before we could get rid\r\nof them; and this was due to the dense population of the country and\r\nthe scarcity of food. It even happened that when some of our men were\r\nengaged in mending a sail, and took biscuits with them to eat, that old\r\nand young fell upon them, took the biscuits out of their hands, and\r\nleft them nothing to eat.\r\n\r\nIn this manner all on board ship went on land by twos and threes,\r\ntaking with them bracelets, clothes, new shirts, and other articles,\r\nwhich they desired to sell. We did not, however, effect these sales at\r\nthe prices hoped for when we arrived at Moncobiquy [Moçambique], for\r\na very fine shirt which in Portugal fetches 300 reis, was worth here\r\nonly two fanôes,[181] which is equivalent only to 30 reis, for 30 reis\r\nin this country is a big sum. And just as we sold shirts cheaply so we\r\nsold other things, in order to take some things away from this country,\r\nif only for samples. Those who visited the city bought there cloves,\r\ncinnamon, and precious stones; and having bought what they desired they\r\ncame back to the ships, without any one speaking to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain found the people of the country so well disposed, he\r\nleft a factor with the merchandise, together with a clerk and some\r\nother men.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Diogo Dias Carries a Message to the King, August 13._]\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for our departure the captain-major sent a\r\npresent to the king, consisting of amber, corals, and many other\r\nthings. At the same time he ordered the king to be informed that he\r\ndesired to leave for Portugal, and that if the king would send some\r\npeople with him to the King of Portugal, he would leave behind him a\r\nfactor, a clerk and some other men, in charge of the merchandise. In\r\nreturn for the present he begged on behalf of his lord [the King of\r\nPortugal] for a bahar[182] of cinnamon, a bahar of cloves, as also\r\nsamples of such other spices as he thought proper, saying that the\r\nfactor would pay for them, if he desired it.\r\n\r\nFour days were allowed to pass after the dispatch of this message\r\nbefore speech could be had with the king. And when the bearer of it\r\nentered the place where the king was, he (the king) looked at him with\r\na “bad face,” and asked what he wanted. The bearer then delivered his\r\nmessage, as explained above, and then referred to the present which\r\nhad been sent. The king said that what he brought ought to have been\r\nsent to his factor, and that he did not want to look at it. He then\r\ndesired the captain to be informed that as he wished to depart he\r\nshould pay him 600 xerafins,[183] and that then he might go: this was\r\nthe custom of the country and of those who came to it. Diogo Dias, who\r\nwas the bearer of the message, said he would return with this reply to\r\nthe captain. But when he left [the palace] certain men followed him,\r\nand when he arrived at the house in Calecut where the merchandise was\r\ndeposited, they put a number of men inside with him to watch that none\r\nof it was sent away. At the same time proclamation was made throughout\r\nthe town prohibiting all boats from approaching our ships.\r\n\r\nWhen they [the Portuguese] saw that they were prisoners, they sent a\r\nyoung negro who was with them along the coast to seek for some one to\r\ntake him to the ships, and to give information that they had been made\r\nprisoners by order of the king. The negro went to the outskirts of the\r\ntown, where there lived some fishermen, one of whom took him on board,\r\non payment of three fanôes. This the fisherman ventured to do because\r\nit was dark, and they could not be seen from the city; and when he\r\nhad put his passenger on board he at once departed. This happened on\r\nMonday, the 13th August, 1498.\r\n\r\nThis news made us sad; not only because we saw some of our men in\r\nthe hands of our enemies, but also because it interfered with our\r\ndeparture. We also felt grieved that a Christian king, to whom we\r\nhad given of ours, should do us such an ill turn. At the same time\r\nwe did not hold him as culpable as he seemed to be, for we were well\r\naware that the Moors of the place, who were merchants from Mecca and\r\nelsewhere, and who knew us, could ill digest us. They had told the king\r\nthat we were thieves, and that if once we navigated to his country,\r\nno more ships from Mecca, nor from Quambaye [Cambay], nor from\r\nImgros,[184] nor from any other part, would visit him. They added that\r\nhe would derive no profit from this [trade with Portugal] as we had\r\nnothing to give, but would rather take away, and that thus his country\r\nwould be ruined. They, moreover, offered rich bribes to the king to\r\ncapture and kill us, so that we should not return to Portugal.\r\n\r\nAll this the captain learnt from a Moor of the country,[185] who\r\nrevealed all that was intended to be done, warning the captains, and\r\nmore especially the captain-major, against going on shore. In addition\r\nto what we learnt through the Moor, we were told by two Christians\r\nthat if the captains went ashore their heads would be cut off, as this\r\nwas the way the king dealt with those who came to his country without\r\ngiving him gold.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the state of affairs. On the next day [August 14] no\r\nboats came out to the ships. On the day after that [August 15] there\r\ncame an _almadia_, with four young men, who brought precious stones\r\nfor sale; but it appeared to us that they came rather by order of the\r\nMoors, in order to see what we should do to them, than for the purpose\r\nof selling stones. The captain, however, made them welcome, and wrote a\r\nletter to his people on shore, which they took away with them. When the\r\npeople saw that no harm befell them, there came daily many merchants,\r\nand others who were not merchants, from curiosity, and all were made\r\nwelcome by us and given to eat.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday [August 19] about twenty-five men came. Among\r\nthem were six persons of quality, and the captain perceived that\r\nthrough these we might recover the men who were detained as prisoners\r\non land. He therefore laid hands upon them, and upon a dozen of the\r\nothers, being eighteen[186] in all. The rest he ordered to be landed\r\nin one of his boats, and gave them a letter to be delivered to the\r\nking’s Moorish factor, in which he declared that if he would restore\r\nthe men who were being kept prisoners he would liberate those whom he\r\nhad taken. When it became known that we had taken these men, a crowd\r\nproceeded to the house where our merchandise was kept, and conducted\r\nour men to the house of the factor, without doing them any harm.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 23rd,[187] of the same month, we made sail, saying we\r\nwere going to Portugal, but hoped to be back soon, and that then they\r\nwould know whether we were thieves. We anchored about four leagues to\r\nthe leeward of Calecut, and we did this because of the headwind.\r\n\r\nOn the next day [August 24] we returned towards the land, but not being\r\nable to weather certain shoals in front of Calecut, we again stood off\r\nand anchored within sight of the city.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday [August 25] we again stood off and anchored so far out at\r\nsea that we could scarcely see the land. On Sunday [August 26] whilst\r\nat anchor, waiting for a breeze, a boat which had been on the lookout\r\nfor us approached, and informed us that Diogo Dias was in the king’s\r\nhouse, and that if we liberated those whom we detained, he should be\r\nbrought on board. The captain, however, was of opinion that he had\r\nbeen killed, and that they said this in order to detain us until they\r\nhad completed their armaments, or until ships of Mecca able to capture\r\nus had arrived. He therefore bade them retire, threatening otherwise\r\nto fire his bombards upon them, and not to return without bringing\r\nhim [Dias] and his men, or at least a letter from them. He added that\r\nunless this were done quickly he intended to take off the heads of his\r\ncaptives. A breeze then sprang up, and we sailed along the coast until\r\nwe anchored.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The King sends for Diogo Dias._]\r\n\r\nWhen the king heard that we had sailed for Portugal, and that he\r\nwas thus no longer able to carry his point, he thought of undoing\r\nthe evil he had done. He sent for Diogo Dias, whom he received with\r\nmarked kindness, and not in the way he did when he was the bearer of\r\n[Vasco’s] present. He asked why the captain had carried off these men.\r\nDiogo Dias said it was because the king would not allow him and his to\r\nreturn to the ships, and detained them as prisoners in the city. The\r\nking said he had done well. He then asked whether his factor had asked\r\nfor anything,[188] giving us to understand that he was ignorant of the\r\nmatter, and that the factor alone was responsible for this extortion.\r\nTurning to his factor, he asked whether he was unaware that quite\r\nrecently he had killed another factor because he had levied tribute\r\nupon some merchants that had come to this country? The king then said:\r\n“Go you back to the ships, you and the others who are with you; tell\r\nthe captain to send me back the men he took; that the pillar, which I\r\nunderstood him to say he desires to be erected on the land shall be\r\ntaken away by those who bring you back, and put up; and, moreover,\r\nthat you will remain here with the merchandise.” At the same time he\r\nforwarded a letter to the captain, which had been written for him by\r\nDiogo Dias with an iron pen upon a palm-leaf, as is the custom of\r\nthe country, and which was intended for the King of Portugal. The\r\ntenor[189] of this letter was as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Vasco da Gama, a gentleman of your household, came to my\r\n  country, whereat I was pleased. My country is rich in cinnamon,\r\n  cloves, ginger, pepper, and precious stones. That which I ask of\r\n  you in exchange is gold, silver, corals and scarlet cloth.”\r\n\r\n[_Off Calecut, August 27-30._] On Monday, the 27th of this month, in\r\nthe morning, whilst we were at anchor, seven boats with many people in\r\nthem brought Diogo Dias and the other [Portuguese] who were with him.\r\nNot daring to put him on board, they placed him in the captain’s long\r\nboat, which was still attached to the stern. They had not brought the\r\nmerchandise, for they believed that Diogo Dias would return with them.\r\nBut once the captain had them back on board, he would not allow them\r\nto return to the land. The pillar[190] he gave to those in the boat,\r\nas the king had given orders for it to be set up. He also gave up, in\r\nexchange, the six most distinguished among his prisoners, keeping six\r\nothers, whom he promised to surrender if on the morrow the merchandise\r\nwere restored to him.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday [August 28], in the morning, whilst at anchor, a Moor of\r\nTunis,[191] who spoke our language, took refuge on board one of our\r\nships, saying, that all he had had been taken from him, that worse\r\nmight happen, and that this was his usual luck. The people of the\r\ncountry, he said, charged him with being a Christian, who had come to\r\nCalecut by order of the King of Portugal; for this reason he preferred\r\ngoing away with us, rather than remain in a country where any day he\r\nmight be killed.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock seven boats with many people in them approached us.\r\nThree of them carried on their benches the striped cloth which we had\r\nleft on land, and we were given to understand that this was all the\r\nmerchandise which belonged to us.[192] These three came to within a\r\ncertain distance of the ships, whilst the other four kept away. We were\r\ntold that if we sent them their men in one of our boats they would\r\ngive our merchandise in exchange for them. However, we saw through\r\ntheir cunning, and the captain-major told them to go away, saying that\r\nhe cared nought for the merchandise, but wanted to take these men to\r\nPortugal.[193] He warned them at the same time to be careful, as he\r\nhoped shortly to be back in Calecut, when they would know whether we\r\nwere thieves, as had been told them by the Moors.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 29th [of August], the captain-major and the other\r\ncaptains agreed that, inasmuch that we had discovered the country we\r\nhad come in search of, as also spices and precious stones, and it\r\nappeared impossible to establish cordial relations with the people,\r\nit would be as well to take our departure. And it was resolved that\r\nwe should take with us the men whom we detained, as, on our return to\r\nCalecut, they might be useful to us in establishing friendly relations.\r\nWe therefore set sail and left for Portugal, greatly rejoicing at our\r\ngood fortune in having made so great a discovery.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday [August 30], at noon, being becalmed about a league below\r\n[that is, north of] Calecut, about seventy boats approached us.[194]\r\nThey were crowded with people wearing a kind of cuirass made of red\r\ncloth, folded. Their weapons for the body, the arms and the head were\r\nthese[195].... When these boats came within the range of our bombards,\r\nthe captain-major ordered us to fire upon them. They followed us for\r\nabout an hour and a half, when there arose a thunderstorm which carried\r\nus out to sea; and when they saw they could no longer do us harm they\r\nturned back, whilst we pursued our route.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Calecut and its Commerce._]\r\n\r\nFrom this country of Calecut, or Alta India,[196] come the spices which\r\nare consumed in the East and the West, in Portugal, as in all other\r\ncountries of the world, as also precious stones of every description.\r\nThe following spices are to be found in this city of Calecut, being\r\nits own produce: much ginger and pepper and cinnamon, although the\r\nlast is not of so fine a quality as that brought from an island called\r\nÇillan [Ceylon],[197] which is eight days journey from Calecut. Calecut\r\nis the staple for all this cinnamon. Cloves are brought to this city\r\nfrom an island called Melequa [Malacca].[198] The Mecca vessels\r\ncarry these spices from there to a city in Mecca[199] called Judeâ\r\n[Jidda], and from the said island to Judeâ is a voyage of fifty days\r\nsailing before the wind, for the vessels of this country cannot tack.\r\nAt Judeâ they discharge their cargoes, paying customs duties to the\r\nGrand Sultan.[200] The merchandise is then transshipped to smaller\r\nvessels, which carry it through the Red Sea to a place close to Santa\r\nCatarina of Mount Sinai, called Tuuz,[201] where customs dues are paid\r\nonce more. From that place the merchants carry the spices on the back\r\nof camels, which they hire at the rate of 4 cruzados each, to Quayro\r\n[Cairo], a journey occupying ten days. At Quayro duties are paid again.\r\nOn this road to Cairo they are frequently robbed by thieves, who live\r\nin that country, such as the Bedouins and others.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo the spices are embarked on the river Nile, which rises in\r\nPrester John’s country in Lower India, and descending that river for\r\ntwo days they reach a place called Roxette [Rosetta], where duties have\r\nto be paid once more. There they are placed on camels, and are conveyed\r\nin one day to a city called Alexandria, which is a sea-port. This city\r\nis visited by the galleys of Venice and Genoa, in search of these\r\nspices, which yield the Grand Sultan a revenue of 600,000 cruzados[202]\r\nin customs duties, out of which he pays to a king called Cidadym[203]\r\nan annual subsidy of 100,000 cruzados for making war upon Prester\r\nJohn. The title of Grand Sultan is bought for money, and does not pass\r\nfrom father to son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE VOYAGE HOME.]\r\n\r\nI now again speak of our voyage home.\r\n\r\nGoing thus along the coast we kept tacking, with the aid of the land\r\nand sea breezes, for the wind was feeble. When becalmed in the day we\r\nlay to.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, September 10, the captain-major landed one of the men whom\r\nwe had taken, and who had lost an eye, with a letter to the Çamolin,\r\nwritten in Moorish [Arabic] by one of the Moors who came with us.[204]\r\nThe country where we landed this Moor was called Compia,[205] and its\r\nking, Biaquolle, was at war with the King of Calecut.\r\n\r\nOn the following day [September 11], whilst becalmed, boats approached\r\nthe ships, and the boatmen, who offered fish for sale, came on board\r\nwithout exhibiting any fear.\r\n\r\n[_Santa Maria Islands._][206]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 15th of said month, we found ourselves near some\r\nislets, about two leagues from the land. We there launched a boat\r\nand put up a pillar on one of these islets, which we called Santa\r\nMaria, the king having ordered three pillars (padrãos), to be named S.\r\nRaphael, S. Gabriel, and Santa Maria. We had thus succeeded in erecting\r\nthese three, _scilicet_, the first, that of S. Raphael, on the Rio dos\r\nbons signaes; the second, that of S. Gabriel, at Calecut; and this, the\r\nlast, named Santa Maria.\r\n\r\nHere again many boats came to us with fish, and the captain made the\r\nboatmen happy by presenting them with shirts. He asked them whether\r\nthey would be glad if he placed a pillar upon the island. They said\r\nthat they would be very glad indeed, for its erection would confirm\r\nthe fact that we were Christians like themselves. The pillar was\r\nconsequently erected in much amity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Anjediva, September 20 to October 5._][207]\r\n\r\nThat same night, with a land breeze, we made sail and pursued our\r\nroute. On the following Thursday, the 20th of the month,[208] we came\r\nto a hilly country, very beautiful and salubrious, close to which there\r\nwere six small islands.\r\n\r\nThere we anchored, near the land, and launched a boat to take in water\r\nand wood to last us during our voyage across the Gulf, which we hoped\r\nto accomplish, if the wind favoured us. On landing we met a young man,\r\nwho pointed out to us a spring of excellent water rising between two\r\nhills on the bank of a river. The captain-major gave this man a cap,\r\nand asked whether he was a Moor or a Christian. The man said that he\r\nwas a Christian, and when told that we too were Christians he was much\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nOn the following day [September 21] an _almadia_ came to us with four\r\nmen, who brought gourds and cucumbers. The captain-major asked whether\r\ncinnamon, ginger, or any other spices were to be found in this country.\r\nThey said there was plenty of cinnamon, but no other kind of spice. The\r\ncaptain at once sent two men with them to the mainland to bring him a\r\nsample, and they were taken to a wood where a large number of trees\r\nyielding cinnamon were growing, and they cut off two big branches,\r\nwith their foliage. When we went in our boats to fetch water we met\r\nthese two men with their cinnamon branches, and they were accompanied\r\nby about twenty others, who brought the captain fowls, cow-milk and\r\ngourds. They asked the captain to send these two men along with them,\r\nas there was much dry cinnamon not far off, which they would show them,\r\nand of which they would bring samples.[209]\r\n\r\nHaving taken in water we returned to the ships, and these men promised\r\nto come on the ensuing day to bring a present of cows, pigs and fowls.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning [September 22] we observed two vessels close\r\nto the land, about two leagues off, but took no further notice of\r\nthem. We cut wood whilst waiting for the tide to enable us to enter\r\nthe river to take in water, and being thus engaged it struck the\r\ncaptain that these vessels were larger than he had thought at first. He\r\ntherefore ordered us into the boats, as soon as we had eaten, and sent\r\nus to find out whether these vessels belonged to Moors or Christians.\r\nAfter his return on board, the captain-major ordered a mariner to go\r\naloft and look out for vessels, and this man reported that out in the\r\nopen sea and at a distance of about six leagues he saw eight vessels\r\nbecalmed. The captain, when he heard this, at once gave orders to sink\r\nthese vessels. They, as soon as they felt the breeze, put the helm hard\r\na-lee, and when they were abreast of us, at a distance of a couple\r\nof leagues, and we thought they might discover us, we made for them.\r\nWhen they saw us coming they bore away for the land. One of them being\r\ndisabled, owing to her helm breaking, the men in her made their escape\r\nin the boat, which they dragged astern, and reached the land in safety.\r\nWe, who were nearest to that vessel, at once boarded her, but found\r\nnothing in her except provisions, coco-nuts, four jars of palm-sugar,\r\nand arms, all the rest being sand used as ballast. The seven other\r\nvessels grounded, and we fired upon them from our boats.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning [September 23], whilst at anchor, seven men in\r\na boat visited us, and they told us that these vessels had come from\r\nCalecut in search of us, and that if they had succeeded in taking us we\r\nshould have been killed.[210]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, having left this place, we anchored at a\r\ndistance of two bombard-shots from the place at which we had been at\r\nfirst, and close to an island, where we had been told that water would\r\nbe found.[211] The captain-major at once sent Nicolau Coelho in an\r\narmed boat in search for this watering place. He came there upon the\r\nruins of a large stone church which had been destroyed by the Moors,\r\nwith the exception of a chapel which had been roofed with straw. This,\r\nat least, was told us by the natives of the country, who prayed there\r\nto three black stones which stood in the middle of the chapel.[212]\r\nBeside this church we discovered a tank of the same workmanship as the\r\nchurch itself—that is, built of hewn stone—from which we took as much\r\nwater as we needed. Another tank, of large size and four fathoms deep,\r\noccupied the highest part of the island. On the beach, in front of the\r\nchurch, we careened the _Berrio_ and the ship of the captain-major. The\r\n_Raphael_ was not drawn up on the beach, on account of difficulties\r\nwhich will be referred to further on.\r\n\r\nBeing one day in the _Berrio_, which was drawn up on the beach, there\r\napproached two large boats, or _fustas_,[213] crowded with people. They\r\nrowed to the sound of drums and bagpipes, and displayed flags at the\r\nmasthead. Five other boats remained on the coast for their protection.\r\nAs they came nearer we asked the people whom we had with us who they\r\nwere. They told us not to allow them to come on board, as they were\r\nrobbers who would seize us if they could. The people of this country,\r\nthey said, carried arms and boarded vessels as if they came as friends,\r\nand having succeeded, and feeling strong enough, they laid hands upon\r\nthem. For this reason they were fired upon from the _Raphael_ and\r\nthe captain-major’s ship, as soon as they came within range of our\r\nbombards. They began to shout “Tambaram,”[214] which meant that they\r\nwere Christians, for the Christians of India call God “Tambaram.” When\r\nthey found that we took no notice of this, they fled towards the land.\r\nNicolau Coelho pursued them for a short distance, when he was recalled\r\nby a signal flag on the ship of the captain-major.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, whilst the captain and many of our people were\r\non land, careening the _Berrio_, there arrived two small boats with\r\na dozen well-dressed men in them, who brought a bundle of sugar-cane\r\nas a present for the captain-major. After they had landed they asked\r\npermission to see the ships. The captain thought they were spies, and\r\ngrew angry. Just then two other boats, with as many people, made their\r\nappearance, but those who had come first, seeing that the captain was\r\nnot favourably disposed towards them, warned these new-comers not to\r\nland, but to turn back. They, too, re-embarked at once, and went away.\r\n\r\nWhilst the ship of the captain-major was being careened there arrived\r\na man,[215] about forty years of age, who spoke Venetian well. He was\r\ndressed in linen, wore a fine _touca_ on his head, and a sword in his\r\nbelt. He had no sooner landed than he embraced the captain-major and\r\nthe captains, and said that he was a Christian from the west, who had\r\ncome to this country in early youth; that he was now in the service\r\nof a Moorish lord,[216] who could muster 40,000 horsemen; that he,\r\ntoo, had become a Moor, although at heart still a Christian. He said\r\nthat, being one day at his master’s house, news was brought that men\r\nhad arrived at Calecut, whose speech none could understand, and who\r\nwere wholly clad; that when he heard this he said that these strangers\r\nmust be Franks, for this is the name by which we [Europeans] are known\r\nin these parts. He then begged permission of his master to be allowed\r\nto visit us, saying that a refusal would cause him to die of sorrow.\r\nHis master thereupon had told him to go and tell us that we might\r\nhave anything in his country which suited us, including ships and\r\nprovisions, and that if we desired to remain permanently it would give\r\nhim much pleasure. When the captain had cordially thanked him for these\r\noffers, which appeared to him to have been made in good faith, our\r\nvisitor asked as a favour that a cheese be given him, which he desired\r\nto take to one of his companions who had remained on the mainland, as a\r\ntoken that all had gone well. The captain ordered a cheese and two soft\r\nloaves to be given to him. He remained on the island, talking so much\r\nand about so many things, that at times he contradicted himself.\r\n\r\nPaulo da Gama, in the meanwhile, had sought the Christians who had come\r\nwith this visitor, and asked who he was. They said he was a pirate\r\n(_armador_), who had come to attack us, and that his ships, with many\r\npeople in them, had remained on the coast. Knowing this much, and\r\nconjecturing the rest, we seized him, took him to the vessel drawn\r\nup on the beach, and there began to thrash him, in order to make him\r\nconfess whether he was really a pirate, or what was the object with\r\nwhich he had come to us. He then told us that he was well aware that\r\nthe whole country was ill-disposed towards us, and that numbers of\r\narmed men were around, hidden within the creeks, but that they would\r\nnot for the present venture to attack us, as they were expecting some\r\nforty vessels which were being armed to pursue us. He added that he\r\ndid not know when they would be ready to attack us. As to himself\r\nhe said nothing except what he had said at first. Afterwards he\r\nwas “questioned”[217] three or four times, and although he did not\r\ndefinitely say so, we understood from his gestures that he had come to\r\nsee the ships, so that he might know what sort of people we were, and\r\nhow we were armed.\r\n\r\nAt this island we remained twelve days, eating much fish, which\r\nwas brought for sale from the mainland, as also many pumpkins and\r\ncucumbers. They also brought us boat-loads of green cinnamon-wood with\r\nthe leaves still on. When our ships had been careened, and we had taken\r\nin as much water as we needed, and had broken up the vessel which we\r\nhad captured, we took our departure. This happened on Friday, October\r\n5.[218]\r\n\r\nBefore the vessel referred to was broken up, its captain offered us\r\n1000 fanões for it, but the captain-major said that it was not for\r\nsale, and as it belonged to an enemy he preferred to burn it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were about two hundred leagues out at sea, the Moor whom we\r\nhad taken with us declared that the time for dissembling was now past.\r\nIt was true that he had heard at the house of his master that we had\r\nlost ourselves along the coast, and were unable to find our way home;\r\nthat for this reason many vessels had been despatched to capture\r\nus; and that his master had sent him to find out what we were doing\r\nand to entice us to his country, for if a privateer had taken us he\r\nwould not have received a share of the booty, whilst if we had landed\r\nwithin his territory we should have been completely in his power,\r\nand being valiant men, he could have employed us in his wars with the\r\nneighbouring kings. This reckoning, however, was made without the host.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Voyage across the Arabian Sea._]\r\n\r\nOwing to frequent calms and foul winds it took us three months less\r\nthree days to cross this gulf,[219] and all our people again suffered\r\nfrom their gums, which grew over their teeth, so that they could not\r\neat. Their legs also swelled, and other parts of the body, and these\r\nswellings spread until the sufferer died, without exhibiting symptoms\r\nof any other disease. Thirty of our men died in this manner—an equal\r\nnumber having died previously—and those able to navigate each ship were\r\nonly seven or eight, and even these were not as well as they ought to\r\nhave been. I assure you that if this state of affairs had continued\r\nfor another fortnight, there would have been no men at all to navigate\r\nthe ships. We had come to such a pass that all bonds of discipline had\r\ngone. Whilst suffering this affliction we addressed vows and petitions\r\nto the saints on behalf of our ships. The captains had held council,\r\nand they had agreed that if a favourable wind enabled us we would\r\nreturn to India whence we had come.\r\n\r\nBut it pleased God in his mercy to send us a wind which, in the course\r\nof six days, carried us within sight of land, and at this we rejoiced\r\nas much as if the land we saw had been Portugal, for with the help\r\nof God we hoped to recover our health there, as we had done once\r\nbefore.[220]\r\n\r\nThis happened on January 2, 1499.[221] It was night when we came close\r\nto the land, and for this reason we put about ship and lay to. In the\r\nmorning [January 3] we reconnoitred the coast, so as to find out\r\nwhither the Lord had taken us, for there was not a pilot on board, nor\r\nany other man who could tell on the chart in what place we were. Some\r\nsaid that we must be among certain islands off Moçambique, about 300\r\nleagues from the mainland;[222] and they said this because a Moor whom\r\nwe had taken at Moçambique had asserted that these islands were very\r\nunhealthy, and that their inhabitants suffered from the same disease\r\nwhich had afflicted us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Magadoxo._]\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves off a large town, with houses of several stories,\r\nbig palaces in its centre, and four towers around it. This town faced\r\nthe sea, belonged to the Moors, and was called Magadoxo.[223] When we\r\nwere quite close to it we fired off many bombards,[224] and continued\r\nalong the coast with a fair wind. We went on thus during the day, but\r\nlay to at night, as we did not know how far we were from Milingue\r\n[Malindi] whither we wished to go.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 5th of the month, being becalmed, a thunderstorm burst\r\nupon us, and tore the ties of the _Raphael_. Whilst repairing these a\r\nprivateer came out from a town called Pate[225] with eight boats and\r\nmany men, but as soon as he came within reach of our bombards we fired\r\nupon him, and he fled. There being no wind we were not able to follow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Malindi._]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 7th [of January][226] we again cast anchor off Milindy,\r\nwhen the king at once sent off to us a long boat holding many people,\r\nwith a present of sheep, and a message to the captain-major, bidding\r\nhim welcome. The king said that he had been expected for days past,\r\nand gave expression to his amicable and peaceable sentiments.\r\nThe captain-major sent a man on shore with these messengers with\r\ninstructions to bring off a supply of oranges, which were much desired\r\nby our sick. These he brought on the following day, as also other kinds\r\nof fruit; but our sick did not much profit by this, for the climate\r\naffected them in such a way that many of them died here. Moors also\r\ncame on board, by order of the king, offering fowls and eggs.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain saw that all this attention was shown us at a time\r\nwhen we stood so much in need of it, he sent a present to the king, and\r\nalso a message by the mouth of one of our men who spoke Arabic, begging\r\nfor a tusk of ivory to be given to the King [of Portugal], his Lord,\r\nand asking that a pillar be placed on the land as a sign of friendship.\r\nThe king replied that he would do what was asked out of love for the\r\nKing of Portugal, whom he desired to serve; and, in fact, he at once\r\nordered a tusk to be taken to the captain and ordered the pillar to be\r\nerected.[227]\r\n\r\nHe also sent a young Moor,[228] who desired to go with us to Portugal,\r\nand whom he recommended strongly to the captain-major, saying that he\r\nsent him in order that the King of Portugal might know how much he\r\ndesired his friendship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vasco da Gama’s Pillar at Malindi.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph by Sir John Kirk._)]\r\n\r\nWe remained five days at this place enjoying ourselves, and reposing\r\nfrom the hardships endured during a passage in the course of which all\r\nof us had been face to face with death.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Malindi to São Braz._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Figure-head of the _S. Raphael_.]\r\n\r\nWe left on Friday [January 11], in the morning, and on Saturday, which\r\nwas the 12th of the month, we passed close to Mombaça. On Sunday\r\n[January 13] we anchored at the _Baixos de S. Raphael_,[229] where\r\nwe set fire to the ship of that name, as it was impossible for us to\r\nnavigate three vessels with the few hands that remained to us. The\r\ncontents of this ship were transferred to the two other ships. We\r\nwere here fifteen days,[230] and from a town in front of us, called\r\nTamugate,[231] many fowls were brought to us for sale or barter in\r\nexchange for shirts and bracelets.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 27th, we left this place with a fair wind. During the\r\nfollowing night we lay to, and in the morning [January 28] we came\r\nclose to a large island called Jamgiber [Zanzibar], which is peopled\r\nby Moors, and is quite ten leagues[232] from the mainland. Late on\r\nFebruary 1, we anchored off the island of S. Jorge, near Moçambique and\r\nleft at once. On the following day [February 2], in the morning, we set\r\nup a pillar in that island, where we had said mass on going out. The\r\nrain fell so heavily that we could not light a fire for melting the\r\nlead to fix the cross, and it therefore remained without one. We then\r\nreturned to the ships.\r\n\r\nOn March 3 we reached the Angra de São Braz, where we caught many\r\nanchovies, seals and penguins, which we salted for our voyage. On the\r\n12th we left, but when ten or twelve leagues from the watering-place\r\nthe wind blew so strongly from the west, that we were compelled to\r\nreturn to this bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_São Braz to the Rio Grande._]\r\n\r\nWhen the wind fell we started once more, and the Lord gave us such a\r\ngood wind that on the 20th we were able to double the Cape of Good\r\nHope. Those who had come so far were in good health and quite robust,\r\nalthough at times nearly dead from the cold winds which we experienced.\r\nThis feeling, however, we attributed less to the cold than to the heat\r\nof the countries from which we had come.\r\n\r\nWe pursued our route with a great desire of reaching home. For\r\ntwenty-seven days[233] we had the wind astern, and were carried by it\r\nto the neighbourhood of the island of São Thiago. To judge from our\r\ncharts we were within a hundred leagues from it, but some supposed we\r\nwere quite near. But the wind fell and we were becalmed. The little\r\nwind there was came from ahead. Thunderstorms,[234] which came from the\r\nland, enabled us to tell our whereabouts, and we plied to windward as\r\nwell as we could.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 25th of April, we had soundings of 35 fathoms. All\r\nthat day we followed our route, and the least sounding we had was 20\r\nfathoms. We nevertheless could get no sight of the land, but the pilots\r\ntold us that we were near the shoals of the Rio Grande.[235]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here the Journal ends abruptly. The succeeding events may be shortly\r\nstated. Vasco da Gama and Coelho were separated in a storm, according\r\nto Resende. Coelho continued his voyage, arriving at Cascaes, below\r\nLisbon, on July 10, 1499. Vasco da Gama, having waited one day for\r\nhis consort, proceeded to the island of São Thiago, placed João de Sá\r\nin charge of the _S. Gabriel_, and chartered a caravel in which he\r\nconveyed his dying brother Paulo to the island of Terceira. João de\r\nSá arrived soon after Coelho, and certainly anterior to August 28th,\r\non which day the king addressed a letter to the Cardinal Protector of\r\nPortugal (see Appendix). Paulo died a day after he had landed at the\r\nAngra of Terceira, and was buried in the church of the Monastery of S.\r\nFrancisco.[236] A resident of Terceira, one Arthur Rodriguez, at once\r\nstarted in a caravel to carry the news of Vasco da Gama’s arrival to\r\nLisbon.\r\n\r\nThe date of Vasco da Gama’s return to Lisbon is not known with\r\ncertainty. The commission appointed in 1871 to remove the remains of\r\nVasco da Gama from the church of Vidigueira to Belem made every effort\r\nto ascertain the exact date, but in vain; and whilst Barros, Goes,\r\nand Pero Barretto de Resende state that it happened on August 29th,\r\nCastanheda fixes upon September 8th, and a MS. in the Torre do Tombo,\r\nconsulted by Texeira de Aragão, has September 18th. Herculano, in a\r\nnote to the second edition of the “Roteiro”, is content with saying\r\nthat it happened at the end of August or at the beginning of September.\r\nTexeira de Aragão assumes (on the ground of a vague expression in De\r\nBarros) that he reached Terceira on August 29th, arrived at Lisbon on\r\nSeptember 9th, and made his triumphal entry into the town on September\r\n18th. This assumption is partly supported by the statement of Barros\r\nthat Vasco da Gama, after his arrival at Belem, on account of the loss\r\nhe had suffered in the death of a beloved brother, spent nine days in\r\nretirement.[237]\r\n\r\nI am myself inclined to believe that Vasco da Gama reached Lisbon on\r\nAugust 29th, and made his triumphal entry on September 8th.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE KINGDOMS TO THE SOUTH OF CALECUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of certain kingdoms on the coast to the\r\nsouth of Calecut, together with the productions of each, and what they\r\nare worth, all of which I have learnt in the most trustworthy manner\r\nfrom a man who spoke our language and who had come to those parts from\r\nAlexandria thirty years before.[238]\r\n\r\nCALECUT, where we were. The articles of merchandise mentioned below\r\nare sent to it, and the vessels of Mecca take their cargoes to that\r\ncity. The King, who is called Çamolim, can muster 100,000 fighting men,\r\nincluding auxiliaries, for the number under his proper jurisdiction is\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\nIn the following we give the articles of merchandise brought thither\r\nin the vessels of Mecca, and their value throughout this part of\r\nIndia[239]:—\r\n\r\n_Copper_, of which the frazila of nearly 30 pounds is worth 50 fanãos\r\nor 3 cruzados.\r\n\r\n_Stone of Baqua_,[240] which is worth its weight in silver.\r\n\r\n_Knives_, worth one fanão each.\r\n\r\n_Rosewater_, worth 50 fanãos the frazila.\r\n\r\n_Alum_, worth 50 fanãos the frazila.\r\n\r\n_Camlot_, worth 7 cruzados the piece.\r\n\r\n_Red cloth_, worth 2 cruzados the _pequy_[241] of three spans (palmas).\r\n\r\n_Quicksilver_, worth 10 cruzados the frazila.\r\n\r\nQUORONGOLIZ [Corongolor][242] is a Christian country and the king is\r\na Christian. Its distance from Calecut by sea, and with a favourable\r\nwind, is 3 days. The king can muster 40,000 fighting men. There is much\r\npepper, the frazila being worth 9 fanãos, whilst at Calecut it is worth\r\n14.\r\n\r\nCOLEU [Colam, Coulão][243] is Christian. Its distance from Calecut by\r\nsea, and with a good wind, is 10 days. The king can muster 10,000 men.\r\nThere is much cotton-cloth in this country, but little pepper.\r\n\r\nCAELL [Cael],[244] the king of which is a Moor, whilst the people are\r\nChristians. Its distance from Calecut, by sea, is 10 days. The king can\r\nassemble 4,000 fighting men, and owns 100 war-elephants. There are many\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nCHOMANDARLA [Choramandel][245] is inhabited by Christians, and the king\r\nis a Christian. He can muster 100,000 men. There is much lac here,\r\nworth half a cruzado the frazila, and an extensive manufacture of\r\ncotton cloths.\r\n\r\nCEYLAM [Ceylon] is a very large island inhabited by Christians under a\r\nChristian king. It is 8 days from Calecut, with a favourable wind. The\r\nking can muster 4,000 men, and has moreover many elephants for war as\r\nwell as for sale. All the fine cinnamon of India is found here, as well\r\nas many sapphires, superior to those of other countries,[246] besides\r\nrubies, few but of good quality.\r\n\r\nCAMATARRA [Sumatra] is Christian. It is 30 days from Calecut with a\r\nfavourable wind. The king can muster 4,000 fighting men, and has 1,000\r\nhorsemen and 300 war-elephants. In this country much spun[247] silk is\r\nfound, worth 8 cruzados the frazila. There is also much lac, worth 10\r\ncruzados the bahar of 20 frazilas [208 kilo.].\r\n\r\nXARNAUZ[248] is Christian and has a Christian king. Its distance\r\nfrom Calecut is 50 days with a good wind. The king can muster 20,000\r\nfighting men and 4,000 horse, and owns 400 war-elephants. In this\r\ncountry is found much benzoin,[249] worth 3 cruzados the frazila, as\r\nalso much aloes,[250] worth 25 cruzados the frazila.\r\n\r\nTENACAR[251] is Christian with a Christian king. It is 40 days’ sail\r\nfrom Calecut, if the wind is favourable. The king can muster 10,000\r\nfighting men and possesses 500 fighting elephants. In this country is\r\nfound much Brazil-wood[252] which yields a red dye, as fine as kermes,\r\nand is worth 3 cruzados the bahar, whilst at Quayro [Cairo] it fetches\r\n60. There is likewise a little aloes.\r\n\r\nBEMGALA [Bengal].[253] In this kingdom there are many Moors and few\r\nChristians, and the king is a Christian. He can muster 20,000 fighting\r\nmen on foot and 10,000 horse. In this country there is much cloth made\r\nof cotton and of silk, and much silver. The distance from Calecut is 40\r\ndays’ sail, with a favourable wind.\r\n\r\nMELEQUA [Malacca] is Christian with a Christian king. It is 40 days’\r\nsail from Qualecut [Calecut], with a good wind. The king can muster\r\n10,000 fighting men, including 1,200 horse. All cloves[254] come from\r\nhere, being worth on the spot 9 cruzados the bahar,[255] as also\r\nnutmeg, which is worth the like amount. There is also much porcelain,\r\nmuch silk and much tin, of which last they coin money; but this money\r\nis heavy and of little value, 3 frazilas being worth only 1 cruzado.\r\nThere are many big parrots in this country, whose plumage is red, like\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nPEGUO [Pegu] is Christian and has a Christian king. The inhabitants are\r\nas white as we are. The king can muster 20,000 fighting men, _scilicet_\r\n10,000 horse and the others on foot, besides 400 war-elephants. This\r\ncountry produces all the musk[256] of the world. The king possesses an\r\nisland about four days’ sail, with a good wind, from the mainland. In\r\nthis island there are animals like deer, who have pouches containing\r\nthis musk, attached to their navels. At a certain period of each year\r\nthey rub themselves against trees, when the pouches come off. It is\r\nthen that the people of the country gather them. Their abundance is\r\nsuch that they give you four large pouches, or ten to twelve small\r\nones, which would fill a large chest, for one cruzado. On the mainland\r\nmany rubies[257] and much gold are found. For ten cruzados as much gold\r\nmay be bought here as for twenty-five at Calecut. There is also much\r\nlac and benzoin of two kinds, white and black. The frazila of white\r\nbenzoin is worth three cruzados, of black only a cruzado and a half.\r\nThe silver to be obtained here for ten cruzados is worth fifteen at\r\nCalecut.\r\n\r\nThe distance of this country from Calecut is thirty days with a fair\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nBEMGUALA [Bengal][258] has a Moorish king, and is inhabited by both\r\nMoors and Christians. Its distance from Calecut is thirty-five days\r\nwith a fair wind. There may be 25,000 fighting men, _scilicet_ 10,000\r\nhorse and the remainder on foot, as also 400 war-elephants. In this\r\ncountry the following merchandise is found:—much corn and much cloth of\r\ngreat value. Cloth which may be bought here for ten cruzados is worth\r\nforty at Calecut. There is also much silver.\r\n\r\nCONIMATA[259] has a Christian king and Christian inhabitants. It is\r\nfifty days’ sail from Calecut, with a good wind.\r\n\r\nThe king can assemble five or six thousand men, and owns one thousand\r\nfighting elephants. In this country there are many sapphires and much\r\nbrazil-wood.\r\n\r\nPATER[260] has Christian inhabitants and a Christian king, and there is\r\nnot a single Moor. The king can assemble four thousand fighting men,\r\nand has a hundred war-elephants. In this country is found much rhubarb,\r\nthe frazila on the spot being worth nine cruzados. There are also many\r\nspinel rubies and much lac, a bahar of which is worth four cruzados.\r\nThe distance from Calecut is fifty days with a fair wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ABOUT ELEPHANTS.]\r\n\r\n_How the Elephants fight in this country._\r\n\r\nThey make a house of wood holding four men, and this house is put on\r\nthe back of the elephant with the four men in it. The elephant has\r\nattached five naked swords to each of his tusks, being ten for the two\r\ntusks. This renders him so redoubtable that none awaits his attack if\r\nflight is possible. Whatever those seated on the top order to be done\r\nis done as if he were a rational creature, for if they tell him “kill\r\nthis one, or do this thing or another”, he does it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How they capture Elephants in the Primeval Forests._\r\n\r\nWhen they wish to capture a wild elephant they take a tame female, and\r\ndig a large hole on the track frequented by elephants, and cover its\r\nmouth with brushwood. They then tell the female “Go! and if you meet\r\nwith an elephant, entice him to this hole, in such a way that he falls\r\ninto it, but take care that you do not fall into it yourself.” She then\r\ngoes away, and does as she has been told, and when she meets one she\r\ndraws him on in such a way that he must fall into the hole, and the\r\nhole is so deep that unaided he could never get out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How they are got out of the hole and broken-in._\r\n\r\nAfter the elephant has fallen into this hole, five or six days are\r\nallowed to pass before he is given anything to eat. When that time has\r\nelapsed, a man brings him a very small supply of food, the supply being\r\nincreased from day to day until he eats by himself. This is continued\r\nfor about a month, during which time those who bring him food gradually\r\ntame him, until at last they venture to descend into the hole. This\r\nis done for several days until he permits the man to put his hands\r\nupon his tusks. He then goes into the hole and puts heavy chains around\r\nthe legs, and whilst in this condition they train him so well that he\r\nlearns all but to speak.\r\n\r\nThese elephants are kept in stables like horses, and a good elephant is\r\nworth 2,000 cruzados.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES AT ALEXANDRIA.[262]\r\n\r\n                                                [Value per\r\n                                                 Pound.]\r\n                                                _£_    _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  One quintal of cinnamon is worth 25 cruzados,  0      2    5\r\n   ”     ”       cloves       ”     20    ”      0      1   11\r\n   ”     ”       pepper       ”     15    ”      0      1    5\r\n   ”     ”       ginger       ”     21    ”      0      2    0\r\n  (At Calecut one bahar, equal to 5 quintals,\r\n    is worth 20 cruzados)                        0      0    5\r\n  One quintal of nutmeg is worth    16 cruzados, 0      1    7\r\n   ”     ”       lac          ”     25    ”      0      2    5\r\n   ”     ”       Brazil-wood  ”     10    ”      0      1    0\r\n  One ratel of rhubarb        ”     12    ”      5     16    0\r\n  One mitikal of musk         ”      1    ”     50      5    4\r\n  One ratel of aloe-wood      ”      2    ”      0     19    4\r\n   ”    ”      benzoin        ”      1    ”      0      9    8\r\n  One quintal of frankincense ”      2    ”      0      0    2½\r\n  (At Mecca the bahar is worth 2 cruzados)       0      0    0½\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A VOCABULARY OF MALAYALAM.]\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF CALECUT.[263]\r\n\r\n\r\n  See, look!           nocane [nōkka].\r\n  Hearest thou?

C. Texeira de Aragão in the _Boletim_ of the\r\nLisbon Geographical Society, VI, 1886, p. 673. It was published a\r\nsecond time in _Alguns Documentos do Archivo National da Torre do\r\nTombo_, Lisbon, 1892, p. 95. There are several omissions in the latter\r\nversion, due probably to the illegibility of the manuscript. In our\r\nrendering of this valuable document, all passages omitted in _Alguns\r\nDocumentos_ are printed in italics, while attention is directed to\r\nother differences by means of foot-notes.\r\n\r\nThe draught of the letter addressed to the “Cardinal Protector” also\r\nexists in the Torre do Tombo,[266] but is evidently very illegible,\r\nfor the text published by Texeira de Aragão is full of blanks. The\r\noriginal, as also the letter to Pope Alexander VI, to which reference\r\nis made, may possibly be discovered in Rome. The letter is dated August\r\n28, 1499, that is, the day before Vasco da Gama’s supposed return\r\nto Lisbon. It was certainly written _after_ the arrival of the _S.\r\nGabriel_, for it refers to the “Moor of Tunis” or Monçaide, to the\r\n“Jew”, who subsequently became known as Gaspar da Gama, and to the men\r\ncarried off from Calecut, none of whom is likely to have been on board\r\nCoelho’s small vessel.[267]\r\n\r\nThe “Cardinal Protector” can be identified with D. Jorge da Costa, a\r\nman of mean extraction, whom Doña Catharina, the virgin daughter of\r\nKing Duarte, and sister of King Afonso IV, appointed her chaplain, and\r\nwho subsequently rose to high dignities in the Church, until, finally,\r\nthe Pope bestowed upon him a cardinal’s hat. King John took a dislike\r\nto the cardinal, who went to reside at Rome; but King Manuel had a\r\nhigh opinion of his wisdom, and soon after his accession, in 1495,\r\nhe invited him, through Pedro Correa,[268] his special ambassador to\r\nthe Court of Rome, to return to Lisbon. The cardinal declined this\r\ninvitation, pleading his great age and infirmities as an excuse, but\r\never afterwards attended most faithfully to the King’s business with\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—KING MANUEL’S LETTER TO THE KING AND QUEEN OF CASTILE, JULY 1499.\r\n\r\n  Most high and excellent Prince and Princess, most potent Lord and\r\n  Lady!\r\n\r\n  Your Highnesses already know that we had ordered _Vasco da Gama,\r\n  a nobleman of our household, and his brother Paulo da Gama, with_\r\n  four vessels to make discoveries by sea, and that two years have now\r\n  elapsed since their departure. And as the principal motive of this\r\n  enterprise has been, with our predecessors, the service of God our\r\n  Lord, and our own advantage,[269] it pleased Him in His mercy to\r\n  speed them on their route. From a message which has now been brought\r\n  to this city by one of the captains,[270] we learn that they did\r\n  reach and discover India and other kingdoms _and lordships_ bordering\r\n  upon it; that they entered and navigated its sea, finding large\r\n  cities, large edifices and rivers, and great populations, among whom\r\n  is carried on all the trade in spices and precious stones, which are\r\n  forwarded in ships (which these same explorers saw and met with in\r\n  good numbers and of great size) to Mecca, and thence to Cairo, whence\r\n  they are dispersed throughout the world. Of these [spices, etc.] they\r\n  have brought a quantity, including cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg,\r\n  _and pepper_, as well as other kinds, together with the boughs and\r\n  leaves[271] of the same; also many fine stones of all sorts, such as\r\n  rubies and others. And they also came to a country in which there are\r\n  mines of gold, of which [gold], as of the spices and precious stones,\r\n  they did not bring as much as they could have done, for they took no\r\n  merchandise with them.[272]\r\n\r\n  As we are aware that your Highnesses will hear of these things\r\n  with much pleasure and satisfaction, we thought well to give this\r\n  information. And your Highnesses may believe, in accordance with what\r\n  we have learnt concerning the Christian people whom these explorers\r\n  reached, that it will be possible, notwithstanding that they are\r\n  not as yet strong in the faith or possessed of a thorough knowledge\r\n  of it, to do much in the service of God and the exaltation of the\r\n  Holy Faith, once they shall have been converted and fully fortified\r\n  (confirmed) in it. And when _they shall have thus been fortified in\r\n  the faith there will be an opportunity for destroying the Moors of\r\n  those parts. Moreover, we hope, with the help of God, that_ the great\r\n  trade which now enriches the Moors of those parts, through whose\r\n  hands it passes without the intervention of other persons or peoples,\r\n  shall, in consequence of our regulations (ordenanços) be diverted _to\r\n  the natives and ships of our own kingdom_, so that henceforth all\r\n  Christendom, _in this part of Europe_, shall be able, _in a large\r\n  measure_, to provide itself with these spices and precious stones.\r\n  This, with the help of God, who in His mercy thus ordained it, will\r\n  cause our designs and intentions to be pushed with more ardour\r\n  [especially as respects] the war upon the Moors _of the territories\r\n  conquered by us in these parts_, which your Highnesses are so firmly\r\n  resolved upon, and in which we are equally zealous.\r\n\r\n  And we pray your Highnesses, in consideration of this great favour,\r\n  which, with much gratitude, we received from Our Lord, to cause to be\r\n  addressed to Him those praises which are His due.[273]\r\n\r\n  Most high _and excellent Prince and Princess, most potent Lord and\r\n  Lady, may the Lord our God ever hold your persons and kingdoms in His\r\n  holy keeping_.\r\n\r\n  _Written at Lisbon, July 1499._\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—KING MANUEL TO THE CARDINAL PROTECTOR, AUGUST 28TH, 1499.\r\n\r\n  Most Reverend Father in Christ, whom we love much as a brother!\r\n\r\n  We, Dom Manuel, by the Grace of God King of Portugal and of the\r\n  Algarves on this side of and beyond the sea, in Africa, Lord of\r\n  Guinea and of the Conquest the Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia,\r\n  Arabia, Persia and India, We send to recommend to your Reverence\r\n  ... very great news ... Our Lord having ended our labours in the\r\n  exploration of Ethiopia and India, of other countries, and eastern\r\n  islands ... we inform you with pleasure ... and in order that you may\r\n  know the progress of events we enclose the draught of a letter which\r\n  we wrote to the Holy Father ... Beyond what we wrote to his Holiness,\r\n  your Reverence must know that those who have just returned from this\r\n  investigation and discovery visited, among other ports of India, a\r\n  city called Qualicut, whence they brought us cinnamon, cloves ... the\r\n  King looks upon himself and the major part of his people as Christian\r\n  ... throughout the year there are found there cucumbers, oranges,\r\n  lemons and citrons ... there are great fleets ... The island of\r\n  Taprobane, which is called Ceilam,[274] is 150 leagues from Qualicut\r\n  ... Our people brought five or six Indians from Qualicut ... moreover\r\n  a Moor of Tunes ... and a Jew,[275] who turned Christian, and who is\r\n  a merchant and lapidary, and well acquainted with the coasts from\r\n  Alexandria to India, and beyond with the interior (_sertão_) and\r\n  Tartary as far as the major sea.... As soon as we had these news\r\n  we ordered general processions to be made throughout our kingdom,\r\n  returning many thanks to Our Lord ... His Holiness and your Reverence\r\n  must (_deve_) publicly rejoice no less and give many praises to God.\r\n  Also, whereas by Apostolical[276] grants we enjoy very fully the\r\n  sovereignty and dominion of all we have discovered, in such manner\r\n  that little or nothing else seems needed, yet would it please us, and\r\n  we affectionately beg that after you shall have handed our letters\r\n  to the Holy Father and the College of Cardinals, it may please you,\r\n  speaking in this as if from yourself, to ask for a fresh expression\r\n  of satisfaction with reference to a matter of such novelty and great\r\n  and recent merit, so as to obtain His Holiness’s renewed approval and\r\n  declaration, in such form as may appear best to you, most Reverend\r\n  Father, whom Our Lord hold in his keeping.\r\n\r\n  Written at Lisbon, August 28, 1499.\r\n\r\n  The King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VASCO DA GAMA.\r\n\r\n(_From the Portrait in the Museu das Bellas Artes at Lisbon._)]\r\n\r\nThis portrait formerly belonged to the Conde de Farrobo, who had it\r\nfrom the Casa de Niza. It was presented to the Museu in 1866 by King\r\nD. Ferdinand. It dates back, apparently, to the first quarter of the\r\nsixteenth century. In 1845 it was restored by Luiz Tirinanzi. The above\r\nis taken from a photograph kindly forwarded by Senhor José Bastos, of\r\nLisbon. The signature attached (Ho Conde Almyrante) is that of Vasco da\r\nGama.\r\n\r\nThe portrait in the possession of the Conde de Lavradio, which was\r\npublished in Lord Stanley of Alderley’s _The Three Voyages of Vasco da\r\nGama_, is a copy of the above.\r\n\r\nGIROLAMO SERNIGI’S LETTERS ON VASCO DA GAMA’S FIRST VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGirolamo Sernigi was born in Florence in 1453. His father, Cipriano di\r\nChimenti, was a member of the Clothiers’ Guild, and was held in high\r\nrespect by his fellow citizens. The family became extinct in 1680.[277]\r\n\r\nGirolamo was residing at Lisbon, where he had settled as a merchant,\r\nwhen Vasco da Gama’s expedition returned from India. He remained there\r\nfor many years afterwards, and in 1510 commanded a vessel which went\r\nout to Malacca with the fleet of Diogo Mendez de Vasconcellos.[278]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the letters giving an account of the voyage of Vasco\r\nda Gama, he wrote others dealing with the trade between Portugal and\r\nIndia. Some of these will be found in the _Diari_ of Marino Sanuto.\r\n\r\nManuscript copies of these letters exist in the Biblioteca Riccardiana,\r\nFlorence (Codices 1910, f. 61, and 2112b), in the library of Mr. Ralph\r\nSneyd, of Newcastle-under-Lyne, and possibly elsewhere. I am indebted\r\nto the mediation of Dr. R. Garnett and the kindness of Professor\r\nBiagi, chief librarian of the Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenciana, at\r\nFlorence, for a careful copy of Codex 1910. The MS. in the library\r\nof Mr. Sneyd formerly belonged to Count Soranzo of Venice, and Prof.\r\nGuglielmo Berchet of that city quotes passages from it in his valuable\r\ncontribution to the “Raccolta Colombiana”.[279] I regret to say that I\r\nfailed in my endeavours to secure a copy of this valuable manuscript.\r\nFortunately, to judge from the few extracts given by Prof. Berchet,\r\nthere seems to be no reason to suppose that it differs in any essential\r\nrespect from the other documents of which I was able to avail myself.\r\n\r\nThe two letters addressed to a gentleman at Florence were published for\r\nthe first time in Fracanzio di Montalboddo’s famous _Paesi novamente\r\nretrovati_, Vicenza, 1507. This seems to be a faithful reproduction of\r\nthe original, except that a few passages have been omitted, and that\r\nthe letters have been divided into chapters, each with a distinctive\r\nheading. Ramusio,[280] who republished these letters in 1550, has taken\r\nmuch greater liberties with their writer. He has not merely improved\r\nhis literary style, but has also condensed many passages, not always\r\nvery happily, and suppressed others altogether. The more important of\r\nthese omissions, and occasional additions, have been pointed out by me\r\nin the notes appended to the present translation.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s name is not mentioned by Fracanzio or Ramusio.\r\nBandini[281] rashly suggested it was Amerigo Vespucci, who addressed\r\nthese letters to Dr. Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici. Professor\r\nKopke[282] devotes several pages to a refutation of this untenable\r\nhypothesis. It suffices to state that Vespucci was away with Alonzo de\r\nHojeda in the West Indies, from May 1499 to February 1500, and cannot\r\nconsequently have been at Lisbon in July 1499, when the first vessel of\r\nVasco da Gama’s fleet came back from India.[283]\r\n\r\nTo Baldelli Boni is due the credit of having first made known the name\r\nof the actual writer, and of having directed attention to the copy of\r\nthe first letter existing in the Riccardian library.[284]\r\n\r\nThe first of these letters was undoubtedly written immediately after\r\nthe arrival of Coelho’s vessel, on July 10th. The information it\r\nconveys was obtained from various members of the expedition, and there\r\nis at least one passage in it which shows that it was not all written\r\non the same day.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was written some time afterwards, for it embodies\r\ninformation obtained from the “pilot”, Gaspar da Gama, who had not come\r\nback when the first letter was written (see p. 136). This intelligent\r\ninformant reached Lisbon on board the flag-ship, the _S. Gabriel_, the\r\ncommand of which had been entrusted by Vasco da Gama to his clerk, João\r\nde Sá, when he himself left São Thiago in a caravel for Terçeira.\r\n\r\nBoth these letters are addressed to a gentleman at Florence with whom\r\nthe writer was not on terms of familiarity, and whom he consequently\r\naddresses as “Vossignoria”. This need not, however, be translated as\r\n“your Lordship”, for that style of address was customary in the case of\r\npersons of much humbler degree.\r\n\r\nThe third letter is undoubtedly by the same writer. An abstract of\r\nit, in German, was discovered among the papers of Conrad Peutinger,\r\nof Augsburg, the antiquarian, and at one time the owner of the famous\r\n_Tabula Peutingeriana_. It was first published, together with other\r\ndocuments dealing with early voyages to the New World and to India, by\r\nDr. G. Greiff, in 1861.[285]\r\n\r\nPeutinger[286] was shown this letter during a temporary visit to\r\nRome, and made the abstract thus published. He states explicitly that\r\nthe letter was addressed to the author’s _brother_. Covering the same\r\nground as the preceding letters, and written about the same time, it is\r\nonly natural that there should occur many similar passages; and this\r\nwould in all probability be even more apparent if we were in a position\r\nto collate the letter seen by Peutinger at Rome with that preserved in\r\nthe “Riccardiana”. But the letter, notwithstanding, is quite distinct\r\nfrom the letters addressed to a gentleman in Florence. The arrangement\r\nof the subjects dealt with is different, and whilst we meet with\r\nparagraphs not to be found in either of the other letters, there are\r\nnumerous omissions. Among these latter we may direct attention to the\r\nspeculation about the Chinese being Germans, which would most certainly\r\nnot have been passed over by a German.\r\n\r\nThe Peutinger letter was written after the captain had come back “_a\r\nsalvamento_” to Lisbon with the “one vessel” of 90 tons, not previously\r\naccounted for. This definite statement is rather puzzling, for if Vasco\r\nda Gama really came home in his flagship, we are either compelled to\r\nreject the statements of such well-accredited historians as De Barros,\r\nGoes, and Castanheda, who affirm that the captain-major ordered João de\r\nSá to take his flagship, the _S. Gabriel_, to Lisbon, whilst he himself\r\nchartered a swift caravel which conveyed himself and his dying brother\r\nto the Azores; or we must assume that João de Sá, having refitted the\r\n_S. Gabriel_ at São Thiago, joined his chief at Terçeira, and returned\r\nwith him to Lisbon.[287] We are inclined to believe that we have before\r\nus an inaccurate statement made by the writer of the letter, or else\r\nan erroneous rendering of his meaning by Peutinger. The letter was\r\ncertainly written after the arrival of João de Sá in the _S. Gabriel_,\r\nbut Vasco da Gama himself, coming direct from Terçeira, may have\r\nreached Lisbon a day or two later: these two distinct events becoming\r\nthus blended, as it were, in the mind of a man not thoroughly informed\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nWe have contented ourselves with printing a few extracts from\r\nPeutinger’s letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIROLAMO SERNIGI’S FIRST LETTER TO A GENTLEMAN AT FLORENCE.[288]\r\n\r\n  [_The Start._]\r\n\r\n  The most illustrious Lord Manuel of Portugal sent 3 new vessels to\r\n  discover new countries, namely 2 vessels[289] (balonieri) of 90\r\n  tons each, and one of 50 tons, in addition to which there was a\r\n  ship (navetta), of one hundred and ten tons, laden with provisions.\r\n  Between them they took away cxviij men,[290] and they left this city\r\n  of Lisbon on July 9 1497.[291] Vasco da Gama went as captain of this\r\n  fleet.\r\n\r\n  [_The Voyage._]\r\n\r\n  On July x 1499 the vessel of 50 tons came back to this city.[292] The\r\n  captain, Vasco da Gama, remained at the Cape Verde islands with one\r\n  of the vessels of 90 tons in order to land there his brother Paulo da\r\n  Gama, who was very ill.[293] The other vessel of 90 tons was burnt\r\n  because there were not people enough to navigate and steer her. The\r\n  store-ship also was burnt, for it was not intended she should return.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the voyage there died 55 men from a disease which\r\n  first attacked the mouth, and thence descended to the throat; they\r\n  also suffered great pain in the legs from the knee downwards.\r\n\r\n  They discovered 1800 leagues[294] (each league being equal to 4¼\r\n  of our miles) of new land beyond the cape of Good Hope, which cape\r\n  was first discovered in the time of King John. Beyond that cape they\r\n  followed the coast for about 600 leagues[295] and met with a dense\r\n  population of black people. And when they had made these 600 leagues\r\n  they discovered a large river,[296] and at the mouth of that river a\r\n  great village inhabited by black people, who are, as it were, subject\r\n  to the Moors. These Moors live in the interior of the country, and\r\n  continually make war upon the blacks. And in this river, according to\r\n  these blacks, are found immense quantities (infinite) of gold; and\r\n  they told the captain that if he would tarry a moon,[297] that is a\r\n  month, they would give him gold in plenty. But the captain would\r\n  not wait, and went about 350 leagues[298] further, and discovered\r\n  a great walled city, with very good stone houses in the Moorish\r\n  style, inhabited by Moors of the colour of Indians. There the\r\n  captain landed, and the Moorish king of this city received him with\r\n  much feasting (chon gran festa), and gave him a pilot for crossing\r\n  the gulf. This city is called Melinde, and lies at the entrance of\r\n  a gulf, the whole of which is peopled by Moors. This pilot spoke\r\n  Italian.[299]\r\n\r\n  [_The Arabian Sea._]\r\n\r\n  This gulf is above 700 leagues across,[300] and they crossed it from\r\n  side to side, and came to a very large city, larger than Lisbon,\r\n  inhabited by Christians, and called Chalichut.\r\n\r\n  On both sides of this gulf there is a dense population of Moors, with\r\n  great towns and castles.[301] At the termination of this gulf there\r\n  is a strait[302] like that of Romania,[303] and having passed through\r\n  this strait there is another and greater gulf, which is the Red Sea.\r\n  And from the right hand of this to the house of Mecca, where is the\r\n  tomb of Mohammed, is 3 days’ journey by land. At the said house of\r\n  Mecca is a very great town of Moors. I am of opinion that this is the\r\n  Gulf of Arabia,[304] concerning which Pliny wrote that Alexander the\r\n  Great went there, to make war, as also did the Romans, who took all\r\n  by war.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Chalichut._]\r\n\r\n  Let us return to the above-named city of Chalichut, which is bigger\r\n  than Lisbon, and peopled by Christian Indians, as said.[305]\r\n\r\n  In this city are churches with bells,[306] but there are no priests,\r\n  and the divine offices are not performed nor sacrificial [masses]\r\n  celebrated, but in each church there is a pillar holding water, in\r\n  the manner of the fonts holding our holy water, and a second pillar\r\n  with balm. They bathe once every 3 years in a river which is near the\r\n  city.[307] The houses in this city are of stone and mortar, in the\r\n  Moorish style, and the roads laid out and straight as are these.[308]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_An Audience._]\r\n\r\n  And the king of this city is waited upon in grand style (molto\r\n  altamente), and keeps regal state, having his chamberlains,\r\n  door-keepers, and barons,[309] as also a very sumptuous palace.\r\n  When the captain of the said vessel arrived at the city the king was\r\n  away at a castle at a distance of about 6 leagues, and having been\r\n  informed that Christians had arrived he at once came to the city\r\n  attended by about 5000 persons.[310] After the lapse of 3 days the\r\n  king sent for the captain, who had stayed in his vessel. The captain,\r\n  with xii of his men, went at once, and about 5000 persons accompanied\r\n  him from the shore as far as the palace of the king, at the gate of\r\n  which stood x doorkeepers with silver-mounted sticks. Having entered\r\n  he proceeded to a chamber where the king reposed upon a low couch.\r\n  The whole of the floor was covered with green velvet,[311] whilst\r\n  around it was drapery of variously-coloured damask. The couch had a\r\n  very fine white coverlet, all worked with gold thread, and above it\r\n  was a canopy, very white, delicate and sumptuous.\r\n\r\n  The king at once asked[312] the captain what he had come to seek.\r\n  The captain replied that it was the custom among Christians that when\r\n  an ambassador had to deliver his message to a prince he should do so\r\n  in secret and not in public. The king, upon this, ordered all his\r\n  people outside. The captain then said that the King of Portugal had\r\n  long since heard of his Highness (alteza) and that he was a Christian\r\n  king. Being desirous of his friendship he had been ordered to visit\r\n  him, as was the custom between Christian kings.\r\n\r\n  The king received this message (ambascata) most graciously, and\r\n  ordered the Christian captain to be lodged in the house of a very\r\n  rich Moor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Moorish Merchants._]\r\n\r\n  In this city there reside many very wealthy Moorish merchants, and\r\n  all the trade is in their hands.[313] They have a fine mosque[314] in\r\n  the square of the town. The king is, as it were, governed by these\r\n  Moors because of the presents which they give him; and owing to their\r\n  industry[315] the government is wholly in their hands, for these\r\n  Christians are coarse people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Spice Trade._]\r\n\r\n  All kinds of spices are to be found in this city of Chalichut, such\r\n  as cinnamon, pepper, ginger, frankincense, lac; and brazil-wood\r\n  abounds in the forests. These spices do not grow here, but[316] in\r\n  a certain island at a distance of 160 leagues from this city, near\r\n  the mainland. It can be reached overland in xx days and is inhabited\r\n  by Moors.[317] All the above spices are brought to this city as to a\r\n  staple.[318]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Coins._]\r\n\r\n  The coins most in circulation in this city are serafins of fine gold,\r\n  coined by the Sultan of Babylonia,[319] which weigh 2 or 3 grains\r\n  less than a ducat, and are called serafins.[320] There also circulate\r\n  some Venetian and Genoese ducats, as also small silver coins, which\r\n  must likewise be of the coinage of said sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Merchandise._]\r\n\r\n  There is abundance of silken stuffs, namely, velvets of various\r\n  colours,[321] satins, damask, taffetas, brocades worked in gold,\r\n  scarlet cloth, brass and tin ware.[322] In fine, all these things are\r\n  to be found in abundance, and it is my opinion that the cloths worked\r\n  in gold and the silks are brought thither from Cairo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Shipping._]\r\n\r\n  The Portuguese remained three months at that town, namely, from May\r\n  21[323] to August 25, and during that time there arrived about 1,500\r\n  Moorish vessels in search of spices. The largest of these vessels did\r\n  not exceed 800 tons.[324] They are of all sorts, large and small.\r\n  Having only one mast they can make headway only with the wind astern,\r\n  and sometimes are obliged to wait from four to six months for fair\r\n  weather [the monsoon or season].\r\n\r\n  Many of these vessels are lost.[325] They are badly built,[326] and\r\n  very frail. They carry neither arms nor artillery.\r\n\r\n  The vessels which visit the islands to carry spices to this city of\r\n  Chalichut are flat-bottomed, so as to draw little water, for there\r\n  are many dry places (shoals). Some of these vessels are built without\r\n  any nails or iron,[327] for they have to pass over the loadstone.\r\n\r\n  All the vessels, as long as they remain at this city, are drawn\r\n  up on the beach, for there is no port where they would be safe\r\n  otherwise.[328]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Prices._]\r\n\r\n  A load of cinnamon equal to 5 Lisbon cantars[329] is worth in\r\n  that city between x and xii ducats, or serafins, at most; but in\r\n  the islands where it is collected it is worth only half that sum.\r\n  Pepper and cloves are rated similarly. Ginger[330] and cinnamon are\r\n  worth more than any other spices, but lac is worth next to nothing,\r\n  and they ballast their vessels with it, that is calk them.[331]\r\n  Brazil-wood abounds in the forests.\r\n\r\n  In payment they only take gold and silver; coral and other\r\n  merchandise of our parts they esteem but little,[332] linen-cloth\r\n  excepted, which I believe would find a ready market, as the sailors\r\n  bartered some of their shirts very profitably for spices, although\r\n  very fine white linen cloth, probably imported from Cairo, is found\r\n  there.\r\n\r\n  There is a custom-house in this city as elsewhere, and merchandise\r\n  pays a duty of 5 p. c.\r\n\r\n  The Portuguese who returned home brought a few precious stones of\r\n  little value, for, in truth, they had neither gold nor silver to buy\r\n  any. They say that these jewels are very dear there, as also are\r\n  pearls, but I believe they are to be had cheap. This is my opinion,\r\n  but those they bought were in the hands of Moorish brokers, who sell\r\n  at a fourfold profit. They have brought some balasci,[333] sapphires\r\n  and very small rubies, as also many garnets. They say that the\r\n  captain brings some valuable jewels, which he bought with the silver\r\n  which he had at his disposal, but as he has not yet come back it is\r\n  not known what he brings.[334]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Trade with Egypt and East Africa._]\r\n\r\n  Most of the vessels which lade spices at Chalichut cross the large\r\n  gulf, mentioned above, over which the pilot took them; they then pass\r\n  through the strait.[335] The Red Sea is crossed in smaller vessels,\r\n  after which they proceed by land to the House of Mecca, which is a\r\n  journey of 3 days. They then take the route for Cairo, past the foot\r\n  of Mount Sinai, and through a desert of sand where, they say, high\r\n  winds sometimes raise the sand in such a manner that it covers them.\r\n  Some of the spice-vessels visit all the cities of the gulf, others\r\n  go to the mouth of the great river,[336] where gold is found and a\r\n  Moorish population, and there discharge their cargoes.\r\n\r\n  They found in this city of Chalichut barrels of Malvasia[337] from\r\n  Candia, and I believe that they were brought from Cairo, as is other\r\n  merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Chinese Visitors._]\r\n\r\n  It is now about 80 years since there arrived in this city of Chalicut\r\n  certain vessels of white Christians, who wore their hair long like\r\n  Germans, and had no beards except around the mouth, such as are worn\r\n  at Constantinople by cavaliers and courtiers.[338] They landed,\r\n  wearing a cuirass, helmet, and vizor, and carrying a certain weapon\r\n  [sword] attached to a spear. Their vessels are armed with bombards,\r\n  shorter than those in use with us. Once every two years they return\r\n  with 20 or 25 vessels. They are unable to tell what people they are,\r\n  nor what merchandise they bring to this city, save that it includes\r\n  very fine linen-cloth and brass-ware. They load spices. Their vessels\r\n  have four masts like those of Spain. If they were Germans it seems\r\n  to me that we should have had some notice about them; possibly they\r\n  may be Russians if they have a port there. On the arrival of the\r\n  captain we may learn who these people are, for the Italian-speaking\r\n  pilot, who was given him by the Moorish king,[339] and whom he took\r\n  away contrary to his inclinations, is with him, and may be able to\r\n  tell.[340]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Food._]\r\n\r\n  Corn in abundance is found in this city of Chalichut, it being\r\n  brought thither by the Moors. For 3 reals,[341] which are smaller\r\n  than ours, bread sufficient for the daily sustenance of a man can be\r\n  purchased. Their bread is unleavened, resembling small cakes, which\r\n  are baked daily in the ashes. Rice, likewise, is found in abundance.\r\n  There are cows and oxen. They are small, but yield much milk and\r\n  butter. Oranges of indifferent flavour[342] are plentiful, as also\r\n  lemons, citrons and limes, very good melons,[343] dates, fresh and\r\n  dried, and great variety of other kinds of fruit.\r\n\r\n  The king of this city of Chalichut eats neither of meat nor fish\r\n  nor anything that has been killed, nor do his barons, courtiers,\r\n  or other persons of quality, for they say that Jesus Christ[344]\r\n  said in his law that he who kills shall die. For this reason they\r\n  refuse to eat anything that has been killed, and it is a great\r\n  thing that they should be able to support themselves without eating\r\n  meat or fish.[345] The common people eat meat and fish, but they\r\n  do not eat oxen or cows, for they hold these animals to be blessed\r\n  (benedetto), and when they meet an ox on the highway they touch him,\r\n  and afterwards kiss their hand, as a sign of great humility.\r\n\r\n  The king lives on rice, milk and butter,[346] and so do his barons\r\n  and some of the other men of quality. And the king is waited upon\r\n  right royally at table. He drinks palm-wine out of a silver cup. This\r\n  cup he does not put to his mouth, but holds at some distance and\r\n  pours the wine down his throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Fish._]\r\n\r\n  The fish are of the same kinds as are those of Portugal, namely,\r\n  perch,[347] soles,[348] bream,[349] salmon, mullets, and so of all\r\n  other kinds. And there are fishermen who go a-fishing[350] [soles and\r\n  salmon].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Elephants._]\r\n\r\n  The Christians ride on elephants, of whom there are many: they are\r\n  domesticated. When the king goes to war most of his people go on\r\n  foot, but some are mounted on elephants; but when he goes from place\r\n  to place he causes himself to be carried by some among the principal\r\n  men of his court.[351]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Dress._]\r\n\r\n  All or most of these people are clothed in cotton-cloths from the\r\n  waist down to the knee, but from the waist upwards they go naked.\r\n  Courtiers and men of condition dress in the same manner, but make\r\n  use of silk-stuffs, reddish or scarlet or of other colours, as seems\r\n  good to them.[352] The wives (ladies) of men of condition are clothed\r\n  above the girdle in very white and delicate linen; but the wives\r\n  of lower degree are naked above the waist.[353] The Moors dress\r\n  according to their custom in _jubbi_ and _balandrau_.[354]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Distance to Lisbon._]\r\n\r\n  From this city of Chalichut to Lisbon is a distance of 3800\r\n  leagues,[355] and at the rate of 4½ miles to the league this makes\r\n  17,100 miles, and as much again for the return voyage. From this the\r\n  time in which such a voyage can be made may be judged, it requiring\r\n  from 15 to 16 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Native Navigation._]\r\n\r\n  The mariners of that part, namely the Moors, do not guide themselves\r\n  by the Pole in navigating this gulf, but trust to quadrants of\r\n  wood.[356] When they cross the gulf to that side, so they were told\r\n  by the pilot, they leave a thousand or more islands[357] to the\r\n  right; and whoever gets among these will be lost as there are many\r\n  rocks (shoals), and I am inclined to think that they be those which\r\n  were discovered by the King of Castile.[358]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Prester John._]\r\n\r\n  At the city of Chalichut they have some knowledge of Prester\r\n  John,[359] but not much, as he is far away. These Christians believe\r\n  that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, without sin, was\r\n  crucified and killed by the Jews, and buried at Jerusalem. They also\r\n  have some knowledge of the Pope of Rome, but know nothing of our\r\n  faith beyond this. They [the people of Prester John] have letters and\r\n  a written language.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Articles of Commerce._]\r\n\r\n  In this city are found many tusks of elephants, also much cotton,\r\n  sugar and sweetmeats, and all the wealth of the world seems now to\r\n  have been discovered.\r\n\r\n  I presume that wine would prove a good article in these parts, and\r\n  very acceptable to these Christians. Oil, too, is in demand.\r\n\r\n  Justice is strictly administered in this city. Robbers, murderers,\r\n  and other malefactors are incontinently impaled in the Turkish\r\n  fashion; and whoever defrauds the king’s excise (customs) is punished\r\n  by having his merchandise confiscated.\r\n\r\n  Civet, musk, ambergris and storax are met with.[360]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Spice Islands._]\r\n\r\n  The island where the spices grow is called Zilon, and is 60[361]\r\n  leagues from said city. In that island grow the trees which yield\r\n  very good cinnamon; as also pepper.[362] However, there is still\r\n  another island [in which spices grow]. Cinnamon and pepper also grow\r\n  on the mainland, around this city, but the quality is inferior to the\r\n  products of the islands. Ginger grows on the mainland, and is of very\r\n  good quality. Cloves grow at a great distance. Of rhubarb there is\r\n  much, and many other kinds of spices are found there, as also many\r\n  almonds.[363]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The Arabian Sea._]\r\n\r\n  I stated above that the gulf was wholly peopled by Moors, but I have\r\n  since[364] learnt that this is not the case. Only the shore on this\r\n  side [the west], where is the city of Melinde, is wholly inhabited\r\n  by white Moors, whilst the further [eastern] shore is peopled by\r\n  Christian Indians, who are white as we are. Along the coast and\r\n  throughout the mainland much corn, meat and fruit are produced.\r\n\r\n  The country around the city of Melinde is very fertile, and many of\r\n  these provisions are shipped from it to Chalichut, for most of the\r\n  land around the latter is sandy and yields no fruit.[365]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The Monsoons._]\r\n\r\n  There are only two dominant winds in those parts, namely westerly and\r\n  easterly winds, and it is winter during the former and summer during\r\n  the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Artists._]\r\n\r\n  There are many excellent painters in this city of Ghalinde,[366] of\r\n  figures as well as of other subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Architecture._]\r\n\r\n  Neither Ghalinde nor any of the other cities is enclosed within\r\n  walls or otherwise, but there are many good houses, built in the\r\n  Moorish style, of stone and mortar, and streets regularly laid out\r\n  (ordinate).[367]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Ceylon._]\r\n\r\n  In the island of Zilon, where the cinnamon grows, are found many\r\n  precious stones and the biggest sapphires.\r\n\r\n  GIROLAMO SERNIGI.\r\n\r\n  Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIROLAMO SERNIGI’S SECOND LETTER TO A GENTLEMAN OF FLORENCE.[368]\r\n\r\n  Since I sent you full particulars about India and its discovery there\r\n  has arrived here the pilot whom they took by force. He appeared to\r\n  be a Sclavonian and turns out to be a Jew, born at Alexandria, or in\r\n  those parts, and thence went to India when very young. At Calichut he\r\n  has a wife and children. He owned a ship and went several times to\r\n  sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Spices._]\r\n\r\n  This man told wonderful things about those countries, and their\r\n  wealth in spices. The best and finest cinnamon is procured from\r\n  another island [Ceylon], about 150 leagues beyond Calichut and very\r\n  near the mainland. This island is inhabited by Moors. Pepper and\r\n  cloves come from more distant parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Jews._]\r\n\r\n  He says that there are not many Jews there; and that there is a King\r\n  of the Jews of the ten tribes of the Jewish people which went out of\r\n  Egypt.[369]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Christians._]\r\n\r\n  He says that in those countries there are many gentiles, that is\r\n  idolaters, and only a few Christians;[370] that the supposed churches\r\n  and belfries are in reality temples of idolaters, and that the\r\n  pictures within them are those of idols and not of Saints. To me\r\n  this seems more probable than saying that there are Christians but\r\n  no divine administrations, no priests and no sacrificial mass. I do\r\n  not understand that there are any Christians there to be taken into\r\n  account,[371] excepting those of Prester John, whose country is far\r\n  from Calichut, on this [_i.e._, the western] side of the Gulf of\r\n  Arabia, and borders upon the country of the King of Melinde, and,\r\n  far in the interior, upon the Ethiopians, that is the black people\r\n  of Guinea, as also upon Egypt, that is the country of the Sultan of\r\n  Babylon [Cairo]. This Prester John has priests, who offer sacrifices,\r\n  respect the Gospels and the Laws of the Church, much as is done by\r\n  other Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Trade with Egypt._]\r\n\r\n  The Sultan has a port on the Red Sea, and the route from Alexandria\r\n  to that port passes throughout through his territories, it being a\r\n  journey of quite lxxx days.[372] At that port all spices coming from\r\n  Calichut are discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_A Pearl Fishery._]\r\n\r\n  There is an island about a league from the mainland,[373] inhabited\r\n  by fishermen, who do nothing but fish for pearls. There is no water\r\n  in the island, and many barges go daily to a large river on the\r\n  mainland where they are filled with water—no tubs or barrels being\r\n  used. When the animals of the island see these barges return, they\r\n  immediately hasten to the shore to drink out of these barges. Pearls\r\n  are not fished at any island except this one which lies quite 60\r\n  leagues[374] this side of Calichut. It is inhabited by gentiles, who\r\n  set great store by cows and oxen, whom they almost worship, so that\r\n  anyone discovered to have eaten beef is adjudged guilty of death.[375]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Taprobana._]\r\n\r\n  Taprobana, concerning which Pliny wrote so fully, was not known\r\n  to the pilot, for it must be quite out at sea, far away from the\r\n  mainland.[376]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_A Pagoda._]\r\n\r\n  At Calichut there is a temple and whoever enters it before noon on a\r\n  seventh Wednesday dies[377] because of diabolical apparitions. The\r\n  Jewish pilot affirms that this is most certainly true, and that on a\r\n  certain day of the year some lamps in this same temple begin to burn\r\n  spontaneously and cause many deformities of nature to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Moorish Navigation._]\r\n\r\n  He, moreover, stated that in those seas they navigate without\r\n  compasses, but with the aid of quadrants of wood. This seems to be a\r\n  difficult thing to do, especially during a fog, when it is impossible\r\n  to see the stars. They also have a kind of very small anchor, but I\r\n  do not know how it is used.[378] The planks of their vessels are held\r\n  together by cords, and they are three palms longer than the beam. All\r\n  the vessels of that country are built at Calichut, for no wood is\r\n  found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Suitable Exports._]\r\n\r\n  The articles of merchandise most suitable for that country seem to\r\n  be coral, copper kettles and thin plates of the same metal; tartar,\r\n  spectacles (for there are countries where a pair of them fetches\r\n  a high price), coarse linens, wine, oil, thin brocades, and also\r\n  boccasins, that is cloths. The said Jew has thrown much light on all\r\n  these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Plans of King Manuel._]\r\n\r\n  Our King of Portugal is very keen in this matter and has already\r\n  ordered four vessels to be got ready, besides two caravels, well\r\n  armed, to sail in January with plenty of merchandise.[379] Should the\r\n  King of Calicut not allow the Portuguese to trade in those countries,\r\n  the captain of these vessels is instructed to capture as many native\r\n  craft as he can. In my opinion he will be able to capture as many as\r\n  he chooses, for they are frail, and so badly constructed that they\r\n  can only sail before the wind. Of these native vessels, engaged in\r\n  the spice trade, there are very many.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Elephants._]\r\n\r\n  The principal animals of this country are elephants, which they\r\n  employ in war. On the back of the animal they place a kind of castle\r\n  sheltering three or four fighting men, in addition to whom there\r\n  is one man, and he the most important, who guides the animal, as\r\n  described by Pliny.[380] Some kings there are who have 1500 elephants\r\n  each, others a thousand and others eight hundred, according to the\r\n  extent of their dominions. When they wish to beach their ships they\r\n  do so by the strength of these animals, and they make them run, which\r\n  seems fabulous, but is nevertheless true.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_Precious Stones._]\r\n\r\n  Those who have returned say that precious stones (jewels) are\r\n  plentiful, but dear in comparison with other merchandise. Neither\r\n  the captain nor the others have brought back jewels worth taking\r\n  into account, and this makes me think that they are not found there,\r\n  but come from afar. The princes and kings of those countries value\r\n  precious stones very much.\r\n\r\n  Storax, benzoin, civet and similar things are not as plentiful there\r\n  as I was led to believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The Royal Title._]\r\n\r\n  Our king has taken a title from those countries, viz. King of\r\n  Portugal and Algarve on this and on the other side of the sea, in\r\n  Africa, Lord of Guinea, and of the conquest, the navigation and\r\n  commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India.\r\n\r\n  This is what I was able to learn from some persons of intelligence\r\n  who returned with this fleet. And if I have written it down somewhat\r\n  at random you, Sir,[381] will pardon and excuse me.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM GIROLAMO SERNIGI’S LETTER TO HIS BROTHER, 1499.\r\n\r\n  _From an Abstract made by Conrad Peutinger at Rome._\r\n\r\n  The four vessels left Lisbon on July 10, 1499 ... The captain\r\n  remained behind with three vessels, because his brother Paulo da\r\n  Gama, was sick unto death. He landed him at an island called Capo\r\n  Verde, far from Lisbon, and burnt two vessels, the one of 110 tons\r\n  and one of 90 tons, so that they might not fall into the hands of\r\n  the heathen [Mohammedans], for 55 of his people had died, and he\r\n  was unable to bring these ships home with the remaining 63 men.\r\n  Afterwards the captain came _a Sambameno_ (_a salvamento_, safely)\r\n  back to Lisbon with the one ship.[382]\r\n\r\n  ... On the voyage out from Lisbon the vessels came to some distant\r\n  islands where they [the Portuguese] had been before.[383] Beyond\r\n  these islands they came to a gulf, or arm of the sea, which they\r\n  crossed, having the land always to the left and the broad sea to the\r\n  right....\r\n\r\n  Various kinds of spices are brought from distant islands to Colokutt.\r\n  Pepper, brazil-wood, _grao_,[384] cinnamon, frankincense, lac, are to\r\n  be found there. These things abound and are worth next to nothing.\r\n  Of brazil-wood there is plenty. There are likewise many ivory tusks\r\n  and various other kinds of merchandise, such as variously-coloured\r\n  silk-stuffs, costly cloth worked in gold, fine white linen, and\r\n  woollen-stuffs, such as bocassins of various colours, and also much\r\n  cotton. It is thought that the silver stuffs and cloths, as also the\r\n  linens, come from Alkeiro (Cairo).\r\n\r\n  ... Most of the spices brought to Kalikut are said to come from the\r\n  island of Zelong (Ceylon). Only heathen live in that island, and the\r\n  king is a heathen [Moor]. It is at a distance of 160 leagues from\r\n  Kalekutt, and only one league from the mainland. By land it is a\r\n  journey of twenty days. In the island are forests of brazil-wood and\r\n  roseberries,[385] and other spices, including cloves and rhubarb, are\r\n  found. Some minor spices come from more distant islands. Cinnamon is\r\n  imported from Ceylon ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VASCO DA GAMA.\r\n\r\n(_From a Paris MS. of Barretto de Rezende._)]\r\n\r\nTHREE PORTUGUESE ACCOUNTS OF VASCO DA GAMA’S FIRST VOYAGE (1608-1646).\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—JORNAL DAS VIAGENS DOS PORTUGUEZES AS INDIAS, 1608.\r\n\r\nThe late Visconde de Santarem, in his _Noticia dos Manuscriptos_, 2nd\r\nedition, Lisbon, 1863, p. 93, draws attention to the existence of a MS.\r\nin the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, which in his opinion furnishes\r\nmost valuable chronological information on the Portuguese voyages to\r\nIndia, from 1497 to 1632. We have translated from this codex all that\r\nrefers to the first voyage of Vasco da Gama; and a perusal of the\r\ntranslation will, we think, convince the reader that he has before him,\r\nnot a document based upon authentic sources, but a compilation of very\r\ndoubtful value.\r\n\r\nWe have examined three copies, or rather editions, of this _Jornal das\r\nViagens dos Portuguezes ás Indias_, viz.:—\r\n\r\n1. _Bibl. Nat. Port. 8, No. 85._ This is the earliest of the three\r\nMSS., for it only extends to the year 1608. On folio 206b is a\r\nstatement to the effect that it was copied in 1618 from a MS. in the\r\npossession of the Conde de Vidigueira.\r\n\r\n2. _Bibl. Nat. Port. 46._ This, formerly, bore the number 10023, and\r\nis the MS. described by Santarem. It is identical with Port. 8, except\r\nthat its information is extended to the year 1632.\r\n\r\n3 _British Museum Add. MSS. 20902._ This is the MS. quoted by\r\nDr. Walter de Gray Birch (_The Commentaries of the Great Afonso\r\nDalboquerque_, ii, p. xvi). It is still more recent than the preceding,\r\nhaving been extended by an unknown author to the year 1653. A list of\r\nthe Viceroys up to 1610 is appended. The marginal notes are derived\r\nfrom Pedro Barretto de Rezende’s _Livro das Armadas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR 1497.\r\n\r\nOn the second of June, 1497, there set sail from Lisbon for the\r\ndiscovery of Oriental India, Vasco da Gama, the second son of Estevão\r\nda Gama, comptroller (veador) of the household of the King Don\r\nAffonso V, and of Doña Isabel Sodré, his wife, as captain-major of\r\nfour vessels: himself in the _São Raphael_; Paulo da Gama, his elder\r\nbrother, in the São Gabriel; Nicolao Coelho in the _São Miguel_.\r\n\r\nGonçalo Nunes was captain of a vessel carrying provisions, which this\r\nside (_antes_) the Cape of Good Hope were transferred to the other\r\nvessels, when he returned to this kingdom [of Portugal]. And the vessel\r\n_S. Gabriel_, in which went Paulo da Gama, being much dilapidated, so\r\nas to be unable to continue the voyage, was broken up for the purpose\r\nof repairing the other vessels, in a river of Cafraria, beyond the\r\nCape of Good Hope, which was named the river of Mercy. And Paulo da\r\nGama went over to the vessel of his brother, while his people were\r\ndistributed among the two vessels. Thence they continued their voyage.\r\n\r\nHaving come to an anchor at Moçambique, where the Sheikh attempted to\r\ntake the vessels by treachery, they disembarked at the island of São\r\nJorge, where was celebrated the first mass beyond the Cape of Good\r\nHope. Thence they went to Quiloa and Mombaça, and the kings of all\r\nthese islands attempted to act treacherously, but God would not permit\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nAt Melinde the King made them honestly welcome, and gave them\r\ntrustworthy pilots, who guided them to Angediva, where they fought the\r\nfustas of the Sabayo, the governor of Goa, over whom they gained the\r\nvictory. And thence they went to Calicut, where the Samori planned many\r\ntreacherous acts which took no effect. Thence they went to Cochim,\r\nwhere the King received them well, and to Cananor, in the same manner.\r\nThere they completed the loading of the two vessels, and returned to\r\nthis kingdom, arriving safely at Lisbon on September 18th, 1499.[386]\r\n\r\nPaulo da Gama died of an illness in the island of Terçeira, at the city\r\nof Angra, and lies buried in the monastery of São Francisco of that\r\ncity.[387]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—LUIZ DE FIGUEIREDO FALCÃO, 1612.\r\n\r\nLuiz de Figueiredo Falcão was secretary of King Philip II of Portugal\r\n(Philip III of Spain), and is the compiler of a _Livro em que se contem\r\ntoda a Fazenda, & Real Patrimonio dos Reynos de Portugal, India, ilhas\r\nadjacentes de sua coroa_, which was printed by order of the Portuguese\r\nGovernment in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe Preface is dated “Madrid, October 20, MDC.VII”, but this is\r\nevidently a misprint, for reference is made in it to a list of captains\r\nwho went to India since 1497 as containing information up to the year\r\n1612; and instead of VII, we ought therefore to read XII, the date of\r\nthe book being thus 1612.\r\n\r\nThe author had access to the original records in the India House,\r\nand claims to have expended three years upon the compilation of his\r\nwork, which certainly contains a mass of information of the highest\r\ninterest. Nevertheless, his book is not free from errors, many of\r\nwhich have already been pointed out by Cunha Rivara in an Appendix to\r\na translation of the _Viagem de Francisco Pyrard_, published at Nova\r\nGoa in 1858. Texeira de Aragão (_Boletim_, Lisbon Geographical Society,\r\nvi, p. 578) also warns against accepting without question all the\r\nstatements made by this author.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following information on Vasco da Gama’s first voyage from\r\na “List of Captain-majors and Captains who went to India since 1497”,\r\np. 137:—\r\n\r\n  1497.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1497 there departed for India Vasco da Gama, the\r\n  first discoverer, as captain-major of four vessels. He left\r\n  Lisbon on July 8th, 1497.\r\n\r\n  _São Miguel_, flagship      Pilot: Pero d’Alenquer.\r\n  _São Raphael_               Captain: Paulo da Gama,\r\n                                brother of Vasco da Gama.\r\n                              Pilot: João de Coimbra.\r\n  _Berrio_                    Captain: Nicolao Coelho.\r\n                              Pilot: Pero Escolar.\r\n  A ship (_nao_)              Captain: Gonçalo Nunez, a\r\n                                retainer of Vasco da Gama.\r\n                                She carried provisions.[388]\r\n\r\n  The _Berrio_, with her captain, returned and reached the bar of\r\n  Lisbon on July 10th, 1499.\r\n\r\n  Vasco da Gama went from India to Cape Verde, where he remained\r\n  with his brother, Paulo da Gama, who died there, and whose body\r\n  he conveyed to the island of Terçeira, and he sent one of his\r\n  servants with the _São Raphael_ to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n  Vasco da Gama himself reached Lisbon in a caravel on August\r\n  29th, two years and nearly two months after he had left that\r\n  port.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to point out that the flagship was\r\nthe _São Gabriel_, and that Paulo da Gama came back in that vessel\r\nand not in the store-ship. It was, indeed, Paulo’s own ship, the _São\r\nRaphael_, which was burnt off Tangáta.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the author’s inconsistencies, we need only quote\r\nthe following passage from a “Summary Statement of Vessels which left\r\nPortugal for India”, p. 194:—\r\n\r\n  Between July 10th, 1499, on which day there arrived in the port\r\n  of Lisbon the ship _São Raphael_, in which Vasco da Gama had\r\n  gone to India in 1497, and 1612, there came back from India 425\r\n  vessels.\r\n\r\nIt was the _Berrio_ which came back on July 10th, the _São Raphael_\r\nhaving been burnt off Mtangata; and Vasco da Gama did not go in the _S.\r\nRaphael_, by the author’s own (erroneous) statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—PEDRO BARRETTO DE REZENDE, 1646.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pedro Barretto de Rezende, a professed Knight of the Order of\r\nSt. Benedict of Aviz, and a native of Pavia,[389] is the author of a\r\n_Livro do Estado da India_, consisting of three Parts and an Appendix,\r\nof which MS. copies exist in the British Museum (Sloane Collection, No.\r\n197) and the Bibliothèque Nationale (Port. 1, and Port. 36). Part I of\r\nthis work contains a succinct account of the doings of the Viceroys of\r\nIndia up to 1634, and gives portraits of all of them; Parts II and III\r\ncontain plans of the Portuguese forts between the Cape of Good Hope and\r\nChina, with descriptions; whilst the Appendix furnishes an account of\r\nthe “armadas” or fleets which were sent to India up to 1605.\r\n\r\nDr. Walter de Gray Birch (_Commentaries of the Great Afonso\r\nDalboquerque_, i, pp. vii-xiii) has given an account of the MS. of this\r\nwork existing in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vasco da Gama as Viceroy.\r\n\r\n(_After Correa’s portrait in the Palacio do Governo, at Goa._)]\r\n\r\nIf this valuable document should ever be printed, it will be necessary\r\nto collate the copies existing in London, Paris, and probably also\r\nelsewhere, for they are not in all respects identical. Port. 36 seems\r\nto me to deserve the preference as far as respects Part I, but Part\r\nII (the description of the forts) has been abridged, as compared with\r\nPort. 1. The portraits in this latter are more neatly done than in\r\nPort. 36. No reference to the source of these full-length portraits is\r\nmade by the author. They certainly differ from the portraits designed\r\nin 1547 by a native artist under the supervision of Gaspar Correa, and\r\npublished in the Lisbon edition of his _Lendas_ (see t. iv, p. 596).\r\nLord Stanley (_Vasco da Gama_, p. ix) says that Correa’s portraits are\r\n“better” than those in Rezende’s work. All that we can say is that\r\nthey are not worse. Our full-length portrait is from a MS. of Barretto\r\nde Rezende in the Bibliothéque Nationale, as reproduced in Charton’s\r\n_Voyageurs anciens et modernes_. The small oval portrait is from a\r\ncopy of Correa’s painting which was made by order of D. Francisco, da\r\nAssumpção de Brito, who was installed Archbishop of Goa in 1774. It\r\nwas first published in 1817 in a work entitled _Retratos e Elogios de\r\nVarões e Donas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST VOYAGE, 1497; FOUR SAILS.\r\n\r\nKing John II of Portugal having died without a legitimate son, Dom\r\nManuel was proclaimed King on October 27th, 1495; and as this fresh\r\ndignity entailed that he should prosecute the undertakings initiated by\r\nhis predecessors, he proposed to himself to go on with the discovery of\r\nOriental India by sea, which, seventy-five years before, had been set\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nIn 1496 he had many councils on this affair, and in consequence of\r\nthe resolutions arrived at he agreed (_assentou_) to despatch on this\r\nenterprise one Vasco da Gama, and forthwith arranged for the fleet to\r\nbe sent, the work upon which was carried on with such expedition that\r\nrigging and all was ready by Saturday, July 8th, 1496.\r\n\r\nThe fleet (_armada_) only included three ships of from 100 to 320 tons,\r\nand there went in them, between sailors and soldiers, 260 persons. In\r\naddition there was a ship carrying provisions.\r\n\r\nThe flag-ship, in which Vasco da Gama, the captain-major, embarked,\r\nwas called the _São Gabriel_, and Pero de Alemquer was the pilot. The\r\nsecond ship was called the _São Raphael_; Paulo da Gama, the brother of\r\nsaid Vasco, was captain, and João de Coimbra, pilot.\r\n\r\nThe third vessel was called the _Berrio_; Nicolao Coelho was her\r\ncaptain and P^o. Escolar her pilot.\r\n\r\nGonsalo Nunes, a retainer (_criado_) of Vasco da Gama, was captain of\r\nthe cargo-ship (_nao_); only provisions went in her. These, as also the\r\ncrew, having been transferred to the other ships at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, they set fire to her.\r\n\r\nThey set sail from the bar of Lisbon on July 8th, 1497, arrived at\r\nMoçambique on March 1st, 1498, made Mombasa on Palm Sunday, the 7th of\r\nApril,[390] and Melinde on the 15th of the same month.\r\n\r\nThere he took pilots to guide him to India, and on May 16th of the\r\nsame year, ’498,[391] he made the land at a port on the coast of\r\nMallavar (Malabar), in the kingdom of the Samorim, two leagues below\r\nCallecut, which is the principal city and capital of that kingdom.\r\nThere he remained seventy-four days, in the course of which, induced\r\nthereto by the Moors who live in that country, he practised upon us a\r\nthousand deceits. But having discovered that for the sake of which he\r\nhad been sent, namely, India, of which he was able to take home such\r\ngood intelligence, he determined to return to Portugal, and set sail on\r\nAugust 29th of this same year, namely, ’498. At the Anjediva islands\r\nhe careened the ships and took in water, and there he took a Jew who,\r\nby order of Sabayo, the King of Goa, had visited him, it being the\r\nintention, immediately after the return of this Jew, to send a fleet\r\nagainst him (Vasco da Gama).\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama departed thence and made the coast of Melinde. Wishing to\r\ndepart thence for this kingdom, the ship _São Raphael_, in which was\r\nhis brother, was lost on the same shoals on which she had already once\r\ngrounded on the way out to India. The loss of this ship did not give\r\nmuch concern to Vasco da Gama, for he was short of men, and those in\r\nher were distributed among the two other vessels. He passed Moçambique,\r\ndoubled the Cape of Good Hope on March 20th, 1499; when near the Cape\r\nVerde Islands a severe storm separated the two vessels, namely, that\r\nin which he (Vasco) was from her consort in which was Nicolau Coelho,\r\nwho, leading, lost sight of Vasco da Gama, and reached the bar of\r\nLisbon[392] on July 10th of said year.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama only arrived on August 29th in a caravel, for his\r\nbrother, Paulo da Gama, being very ill, he went from the island of\r\nSão Thiago to that of Terçeira, allowing his ship to be taken to Lisbon\r\nby João de Sá.\r\n\r\nAnd Vasco da Gama buried his brother, whose death much afflicted\r\nhim, in the island of Terçeira, and after that landed at Lisbon on\r\nAugust 29th, as stated above, or two years after he had started on his\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Livro das armadas e capitaes que forão a India_, which, as\r\nalready stated, forms an Appendix to Rezende’s _Livro do estado da\r\nIndia_, we take the following:—\r\n\r\n  _Vasco da Gama, captain-major, 1497._\r\n\r\n  He departed on July 8th, by order of King Dom Manuel, with four\r\n  ships to discover India, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Vasco da Gama in the _S. Gabriel_.\r\n  Paulo da Gama, his brother, in the _S. Raphael_.\r\n  Nicolao Coelho in the ship _Berrio_.\r\n  Gonçalo Nunes in a store-ship.\r\n\r\nThe people and provisions in the ship of Gonçalo Nunes were distributed\r\namong the other ships after the Cape of Good Hope had been passed, and\r\nbeyond the Aguada (watering-place) of S. Braz, and this ship, having\r\nbeen stripped, was set on fire.\r\n\r\nThe ship of Paulo da Gama stranded on the voyage home to Portugal on\r\nthe shoals between Guilva [Kilwa] and Mombaça, and these shoals were\r\nnamed after the _S. Raphael_ which had now run aground upon them. Her\r\npeople were distributed among the two companion-ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SÃO GABRIEL”.\r\n\r\n(_From a Model designed by Captain A. A. Baldaque da Silva, drawn by\r\nHerbert Johnson._)]\r\n\r\nVASCO DA GAMA’S SHIPS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\nAll authorities agree that the fleet, or armada, fitted out for Vasco\r\nda Gama’s voyage numbered four vessels, but they are not agreed as to\r\nthe names which these vessels bore. We are not, however, likely to\r\nbe misled if we accept the unanimous testimony of the author of our\r\n_Roteiro_, of João de Barros, Lopez de Castanheda, Pedro Barretto de\r\nRezende, and Manuel Faria y Sousa: according to whom the names of the\r\nships and of their principal officers were as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _S. Gabriel_ (flag-ship).—Vasco da Gama, captain-major; Pero\r\n  d’Alenquer, pilot; Gonçalo Alvarez, master; Diogo Dias, clerk.\r\n\r\n  _S. Raphael._—Paulo da Gama, captain; João de Coimbra pilot;\r\n  João de Sá, clerk.\r\n\r\n  _Berrio._—Nicolau Coelho, captain; Pero Escolar, pilot; Alvaro\r\n  de Braga, clerk.\r\n\r\n  _Store-ship._—Gonçalo Nunes, captain.\r\n\r\nCorrea and the unknown author of the _Jornal das Viagens_ (p. 145) call\r\nthe “Berrio” _S. Miguel_, and make the _S. Raphael_ the flag-ship;\r\nwhilst L. de Figueiredo de Falcão (p. 147) substitutes a _S. Miguel_\r\nfor the _S. Raphael_. It is just possible that the vessel popularly\r\ncalled _Berrio_, after its former owner, had been re-christened _S.\r\nMiguel_.\r\n\r\nThe _Berrio_ was one of those swift lateen-rigged vessels for which\r\nPortugal was famous from the thirteenth to the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, and which, after the _barinel_[393] had been\r\ndiscarded, were exclusively employed in the exploration of the African\r\ncoast. Their burthen did not exceed 200 tons, and they had two or three\r\nmasts, and occasionally even four.[394] The _Berrio_ is stated to have\r\nbeen a vessel of only 50 tons. She was named after her former owner and\r\npilot,[395] of whom she was purchased expressly for this voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Caravel.\r\n\r\n(_After a Painting of the sixteenth century, in the Monastery of the\r\nMother of God at Lisbon._)]\r\n\r\nThe store-ship was of more considerable size. Sernigi (p. 123) says\r\nshe measured 110 tons; Castanheda credits her with 200. She may have\r\nbeen a so-called _caravela redonda_, that is a caravel which carried\r\nsquare sails on the main and fore-masts and triangular ones on the\r\nmizzen-mast and the bowsprit. This vessel was purchased of Ayres\r\nCorrea, a shipowner of Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe _S. Gabriel_ and _S. Raphael_ were specially built for this\r\nvoyage. Bartholomeu Dias, who superintended their construction,\r\ndiscarded the caravel in which he himself had achieved his great\r\nsuccess, in favour of square-rigged vessels of greater burthen, which,\r\nalthough slower sailers and less able to ply to windward, offered\r\ngreater safety and more comfort to their crews. He took care, at the\r\nsame time, that the draught of these vessels should enable them to\r\nnavigate shallow waters, such as it was expected would be met with in\r\nthe course of the voyage. The timber for these two vessels had been cut\r\nduring the last year of the reign of King John, in the Crown woods of\r\nLeiria and Alcacer. The vessels having been completed, the King ordered\r\nthem to be equipped by Fernão Lourenço, the factor of the house of\r\nMines, and one of the most “magnificent” men of his time.[396]\r\n\r\nNo contemporary description or picture of these vessels has reached\r\nus, but there can hardly be a doubt that their type[397] is fairly\r\nrepresented on a painting made by order of D. Jorge Cabral, who was\r\nGovernor of India from 1549 to 1550. This painting subsequently became\r\nthe property of D. João de Castro. A copy of it was first published\r\nby the Visconde de Juromenha, who took it from a MS. dated 1558.[398]\r\nThe fine woodcut in W. S. Lindsay’s _History of Merchant Shipping_\r\n(II, p. 5), from an ancient picture which also belonged to D. João de\r\nCastro, seems to be derived from the same source, but as the vessel\r\ncarries the flag of the Order of Christ at the main, and not the Royal\r\nStandard, it cannot represent the flag-ship. At all events, it is not\r\nmore authentic than either of the ships delineated in the drawing first\r\npublished by Juromenha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The supposed Armada of Vasco da Gama.\r\n\r\n(_From a Painting made by order of Jorge Cabral (1549-50.))_]\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ very widely as to the tonnage of these two vessels.\r\nSernigi (see p. 123) says they were of 90 tons each, thus partly\r\nbearing out Correa, who states that the _three_ ships (including the\r\n_Berrio_) were built of the same size and pattern.[399] D. Pacheco\r\nPereira[400] states that the largest of them did not exceed 100 tons;\r\nJ. de Barros gives them a burthen of between 100 and 120 tons; whilst\r\nCastanheda allocates 120 tons to the flag-ship and 100 to the _S.\r\nRaphael_.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the authorities quoted dwell upon the small size of the\r\nvessels which for the first time reached India from a European port,\r\nand even give reasons for this limitation of burthen,[401] there is\r\nsome ground for believing that the tonnage of Vasco da Gama’s ships,\r\nexpressed according to modern terminology, was in reality much greater\r\nthan is usually supposed. Pedro Barretto de Rezende (p. 151) may\r\ntherefore have some justification when he states that these vessels\r\nranged from 100 to 320 tons. Mr. Lindsay (_loc. cit._) would go even\r\nfurther. The _S. Gabriel_, according to him, was constructed to carry\r\n400 pipes, equivalent to 400 tons measurement, or about 250 to 300 tons\r\nregister. He adds that Sr. E. Pinto Bastos agrees with him.[402]\r\n\r\nIn considering this question of tonnage, it must be borne in mind that\r\n“ton”, at the close of the fifteenth century, was a different measure\r\nfrom what it is at present. We learn from E. A. D’Albertis[403] that\r\nthe _tonelada_ of Seville was supposed to afford accommodation for two\r\npipes of 27½ arrobas (98 gallons) each, and measured 1.405 cubic\r\nmetres, or about 50 cubic feet. The _tonel_ of Biscay was 20 per cent.\r\nlarger. According to Capt. H. Lopez de Mendonça, the _tonel_ at Lisbon\r\nmeasured 6 palmos de goa in length (talha), and 4 such palmos in\r\nbreadth and height (parea), that is, about 85 cubic feet.[404] This,\r\nhowever, seems excessive, for my wine merchant tells me that two butts\r\nof sherry of 108 gallons each would occupy only 75 cubic feet. At\r\nany rate, these data show that the ton of the fifteenth century was\r\nconsiderably larger than the ton measurement of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nTwo attempts have been made recently by distinguished officers of the\r\nPortuguese Navy, Captains Joào Braz d’Oliveira[405] and A. A. Baldaque\r\nda Silva,[406] to reconstruct Vasco da Gama’s flagship, or rather to\r\ndesign a ship of a type existing at the close of the fifteenth century,\r\nand answering as nearly as possible to the scanty indications to be\r\nfound within the pages of the historians of this memorable voyage. In\r\nthis reconstruction good use has been made of an early manuscript on\r\nshipbuilding by Fernando Oliveira (_O livro da fabrica das Nãos_),\r\nwhich Captain Lopez de Mendonça proposes to publish.\r\n\r\nThe designs produced by the two naval officers differ widely in several\r\nrespects, and more especially as regards the relation between the\r\ntotal length of the ship and the breadth of beam. In Captain B. da\r\nSilva’s ship the beam is equal to one-third of the length, whilst the\r\nproportion in Captain J. Braz d’Oliveira’s ship is as one to five. The\r\nformer of these ships is broad-beamed, as befits the period, whilst the\r\nlatter is almost as slim as a modern clipper. It must be remembered\r\nthat, until comparatively recent times, it was held that the length\r\nof a sailing ship should not exceed four times the breadth of beam;\r\nand this maxim was undoubtedly acted upon by the shipbuilders of the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nCaptain Baldaque da Silva’s design of the _S. Gabriel_ has been\r\nembodied in a model, and from a photograph of this model Mr. Herbert\r\nJohnson has produced the illustration placed in front of this Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the ship designed by Captain Baldaque da Silvia are\r\nas follows:—[407]\r\n\r\n  Length over all                             84.1 feet.\r\n  Water-line (when laden)                     64.0  ”\r\n  Keel                                        56.7  ”\r\n  Breadth of beam                             27.9  ”\r\n  Depth                                       17.1  ”\r\n  Draught, abaft                               7.5  ”\r\n     ”     forward                             5.6  ”\r\n  Metocentric height above the water-line\r\n    (laden)                                    7.4  ”\r\n  Displacement                                 178 tons.\r\n  Tonnage                 4,130 cubic feet, or 103  ”\r\n\r\nThis, as I learn from a private letter of Captain B. da Silva, is\r\nsupposed to be the gross under-deck tonnage, but on calculating the\r\ntonnage according to the Builders’ Old Measurement Rule, I find it\r\nto amount to 230 tons of 40 cubic feet each, whilst the “expeditive”\r\nmethod practised at Venice[408] during the fifteenth century yields 896\r\nbotte of 28 gallons, or about 250 toneladas.\r\n\r\nThe ship was flat-bottomed, with a square stern and bluff bow, the\r\nlatter ornamented with a figure of her patron saint. Wales were placed\r\nalong the sides to reduce her rolling when going before the wind.\r\nFormidable “castles” rose fore and aft, having a deep waist between\r\nthem. These “castles,” however, had not then grown to the portentous\r\nheight attained at a subsequent period, when they rendered it difficult\r\nto govern the ship in a gale, and it often became necessary to cut down\r\nthe foremast and dismantle the forecastle to enable them to keep her\r\nhead to the wind.\r\n\r\nThese “castles” were in reality citadels, and enabled the crew to make\r\na last stand after the vessel had been boarded. A notable instance of\r\nthis occurred in the course of the fight with the _Meri_ in 1502.[409]\r\n\r\nThe captain was lodged in the castle rising upon the quarter-deck,\r\nthe officers were accommodated in the room below his and in the\r\nforecastle, whilst the men had their quarters beneath the gang boards\r\nwhich ran along the top-sides from castle to castle. The men were\r\neach allowed a locker, to contain such goods as they might obtain by\r\nbarter with the natives. Ladders led from the main deck up to the\r\nfighting decks (_chapitéo de ré_ and _de vante_) of the two castles,\r\nand these were defended against boarders by nettings. The tiller of the\r\nrudder entered the battery abaft the captain’s apartments, where also\r\nstood the binnacle. The armament consisted of twenty guns. The lower\r\nbattery of the “castle” rising on the quarter-deck was armed with eight\r\nbreech-loaders made of wrought-iron staves, held together by hoops and\r\nmounted on forked props. The upper battery held six bombards, and the\r\nforecastle the same number.[410] We may at once state that the men\r\ncarried no firearms. Their arms included cross-bows, spears, axes,\r\nswords, javelins, and boarding-pikes. Some of the officers were clad in\r\nsteel armour, whilst the men had to be content with leather jerkins and\r\nbreast-plates.\r\n\r\nAmidships stood the _batel_, or long boat, in addition to which there\r\nwas available a yawl rowed with four or six oars.\r\n\r\nThere were three masts and a bowsprit. The main-mast rose to a height\r\nof 110 ft. above the keel and flew the Royal Standard at its head,\r\nwhilst the captain’s scarlet flag floated from the crow’s-nest, nearly\r\n70 ft. above deck. A similar crow’s-nest was attached to the foremast.\r\nIn the case of an engagement these points of vantage were occupied by\r\nfighting men, who hurled thence javelins, grenades, and powder-pots\r\nupon the enemy. The sails were square, with the exception of that of\r\nthe mizzen, which was triangular. When spread they presented 4,000\r\nsquare feet of canvas to the wind; this was exclusive of the “bonnets”\r\nwhich were occasionally laced to the leeches of the mainsail, and\r\nserved to some extent the same purpose as a modern studding-sail.[411]\r\nThe Cross of the Order of Christ was painted on each sail.\r\n\r\nThe anchors, two in number, were of iron, with a wooden stock and a\r\nring for bending the cable.\r\n\r\nThe hold was divided into three compartments. Amidships were the water\r\nbarrels, with coils of cable on the top of them—a very inconvenient\r\narrangement; abaft was the powder-magazine, and most arms and\r\nmunitions, including iron and stone balls, were kept there; the forward\r\ncompartment was used for the storage of requisites, including spare\r\nsails and a spare anchor.\r\n\r\nThe lower deck was divided by bulkheads into three compartments, two\r\nof which were set apart for provisions, presents, and articles of\r\nbarter. The “provisions”, according to Castanheda, were calculated to\r\nsuffice for three years, and the daily rations were on a liberal scale,\r\nconsisting of 1½ pounds of biscuit, 1 pound of beef or half a pound\r\nof pork, 2½ pints of water, 1¼ pints of wine, one-third of a gill\r\nof vinegar, and half that quantity of oil. On fast days, half a pound\r\nof rice, of codfish, or cheese was substituted for the meat. There\r\nwere, in addition, flour, lentils, sardines, plums, almonds, onions,\r\ngarlic, mustard, salt, sugar and honey. These ships’ stores were\r\nsupplemented by fish, caught whenever an opportunity offered, and by\r\nfresh provisions obtained when in port, among which were oranges, which\r\nproved most acceptable to the many men suffering from scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe merchandise was not only insufficient in quantity, but proved\r\naltogether unsuited to the Indian market. It seems to have included\r\n_lambel_ (striped cotton stuff), sugar, olive-oil, honey, and coral\r\nbeads. Among the objects intended for presents, there were wash-hand\r\nbasins, scarlet hoods, silk jackets, pantaloons, hats, Moorish caps;\r\nbesides such trifles as glass beads, little round bells, tin rings\r\nand bracelets, which were well enough suited for barter on the Guinea\r\ncoast, but were not appreciated by the wealthy merchants of Calecut. Of\r\nready money there seems to have been little to spare. All this is made\r\nevident by the letters of D. Manuel and Signor Sernigi.\r\n\r\nThe scientific outfit of the expedition, it may safely be presumed,\r\nwas the best to be procured at the time. The learned D. Diogo Ortiz de\r\nVilhegas[412] furnished Da Gama with maps and books, including, almost\r\nas a matter of course, a copy of Ptolemy, and copies of the information\r\non the East collected at Lisbon for years past. Among these reports,\r\nthat sent home by Pero de Covilhão found, no doubt, a place,[413] as\r\nalso the information furnished by Lucas Marcos,[414] an Abyssinian\r\npriest who visited Lisbon about 1490.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical instruments were provided by Zacut, the astronomer,\r\nand it is even stated that Vasco enjoyed the advantage of being trained\r\nas a practical observer by that learned Hebrew. These instruments\r\nincluded a large wooden astrolabe, smaller astrolabes of metal, and, in\r\nall probability, also quadrants; and they were accompanied by a copy\r\nof Zacut’s _Almanach perpetuum Celestium motuum cujus radix est 1473_,\r\na translation of which, by José Vizinho, had been printed at Leiria\r\nin 1496.[415] These tables enabled the navigator to calculate his\r\nlatitudes by observing the altitude of the sun.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, a sufficient supply of compasses, of sounding\r\nleads and hour-glasses, and possibly also a _catena a poppa_, that is,\r\na rope towed at the stern to determine the ship’s leeway, and a _toleta\r\nde marteloia_, a graphical substitute for our modern traverse tables,\r\nboth of them contrivances long since in use among the Italians. It\r\nis also possible that Vasco was already provided with an equinoctial\r\ncompass for determining the time of high water at the ports he\r\nvisited, and with a variation compass. This instrument consisted of a\r\ncombination of a sun-dial with a magnetic needle. It had been invented\r\nby Peurbach, _c._ 1460, was improved by Felipe Guillen, 1528, and by\r\nPedro Nunes, 1537, and used for the first time on an extensive scale\r\nby João de Castro, during a voyage to India and the Red Sea, in\r\n1538-41.[416] We are inclined to think that Vasco had such a variation\r\ncompass, for the Cabo das Agulhas, or “Needle Cape”, thus named because\r\nthe needle there pointed, or was supposed to point, due north, has\r\nalready found a place on Cantino’s Chart, and can have been named only\r\nas the result of an actual observation, however inaccurate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cão’s Padrão at Cape Cross.]\r\n\r\nLastly, there remain to be noticed the Padrãos, or pillars of stone\r\nwhich were on board the vessels, and three of which, by the king’s\r\nexpress desire, were dedicated to S. Raphael, S. Gabriel, and S. Maria\r\n(see p. 80). Barros and Castanheda tell us that these pillars resembled\r\nthose set up by Cão and Dias in the time of D. João II; and in a series\r\nof pictures which D. Manuel desired to have painted in celebration of\r\nthe discovery of India, the Padrão to be shown at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, or “Prasum promontorium”, was to have been surmounted by a cross,\r\nand to bear the Royal Arms and a Pelican, with an inscription giving\r\nthe date.[417]\r\n\r\nCorrea, on the other hand, affirms in his _Lendas_ that the pillar\r\nset up at the Rio da Misericordia (the Rio dos Bons Signaes of the\r\n_Roteiro_) was of marble, with two escutcheons, one of the arms of\r\nPortugal, and the other (at the back) of a sphere, and that the\r\ninscription was “Do senhorio de Portugal reino de Christãos”. The\r\npillar at Melinde had the same escutcheons, but the inscription was\r\nlimited to the words “Rey Manoel”.[418] As Correa had an opportunity of\r\nseeing these pillars, his description of them may be correct, though he\r\nis an arrant fabulator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VASCO DA GAMA.\r\n\r\n(_From A. Morelet’s French version of the “Roteiro”, 1864._)\r\n\r\nAfter a Portrait formerly the property of Conde de Farrobo, now in the\r\n_Museu das Bellas Artes_, Lisbon.]\r\n\r\nMUSTER-ROLL OF VASCO DA GAMA’S FLEET.\r\n\r\nThe officers and men in Vasco da Gama’s _armada_ were carefully\r\nselected. Several of them had been with Bartholomeu Dias round the\r\nCape; all of them, as appears from this “Journal”, justified by their\r\nconduct under sometimes trying circumstances the selection which had\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nAuthorities widely differ as to the number of men who embarked. Sernigi\r\n(p. 124) says there were only 118, of whom 55 died during the voyage\r\nand only 63 returned. Galvão says there were 120, besides the men in\r\nthe store-ship. Castanheda and Goes raise the number to 148, of whom\r\nonly 55 returned, many of them broken in health. Faria y Sousa and\r\nSan Ramon say there were 160, and the latter adds that 93 of these\r\ndied during the voyage, thus confirming a statement made by King\r\nManuel in his letter of February 20th, 1504, to the effect that less\r\nthan one-half returned.[419] According to Barros there were 170 men,\r\nincluding soldiers and sailors. Correa raises the number to 260, for he\r\nsays that in each of the three ships there were 80 officers and men,\r\nincluding servants, besides six convicts and two priests.[420] He says\r\nnothing of the store-ship. By the time Vasco da Gama had reached the\r\nRio da Misericordia only 150 out of this number are said to have been\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nCorrea, no doubt, exaggerates. On the other hand, Sernigi’s numbers\r\nseem to us to err quite as much on the other side. It is quite true\r\nthat a Mediterranean merchantman of 100 tons, in the sixteenth century,\r\nwas manned by 12 able and 8 ordinary seamen;[421] but in the case of\r\nan expedition sent forth for a number of years and to unknown dangers,\r\nthis number would no doubt have been increased. We are, therefore,\r\ninclined to believe that the number given by De Barros—namely, 170—may\r\nbe nearer the truth, namely 70 men in the flag-ship, 50 in the _S.\r\nRaphael_, 30 in the caravel, and 20 in the store-ship. The men in the\r\nflag-ship may have included 1 captain, 1 master, 1 pilot, 1 assistant\r\npilot, 1 mate (contramestre), 1 boatswain (guardião), 20 able seamen\r\n(marinheiros), 10 ordinary seamen (grumetes), 2 boys (pagens), 1\r\nchief gunner or constable, 8 bombardiers, 4 trumpeters, 1 clerk or\r\npurser (escrivão), 1 storekeeper (dispenseiro), 1 officer of justice\r\n(meirinho), 1 barber-surgeon, 2 interpreters, 1 chaplain, 6 artificers\r\n(ropemaker, carpenter, calker, cooper, armourer and cook), and 10\r\nservants. One or more of these servants may have been negro slaves. The\r\n“Degradados”, or convicts on board, to be “adventured on land” (p. 48),\r\nare included in the total. Whether private gentlemen were permitted to\r\njoin this expedition as volunteers history doth not record.\r\n\r\nThe following “muster-roll” contains short notices of all those who\r\nare stated to have embarked at Lisbon in Vasco da Gama’s fleet, or who\r\nsubsequently joined it, either voluntarily or upon compulsion.\r\n\r\nApart from natives, thirty-one persons are mentioned, and with respect\r\nto twenty-six of these no reasonable doubt can be entertained that they\r\nwere actually members of the ships’ companies.\r\n\r\nThose among them whose names appear in the “Journal” are distinguished\r\nby an asterisk.[422]\r\n\r\nCAPTAINS.\r\n\r\n*_Vasco da Gama_, Captain-Major in the _S.

Gabriel_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p.\r\n279; Castanheda, I, p. 7; Goes, I, 69; Faria y Sousa, p. 29). He had\r\nbeen with Dias in the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, and with the\r\nCongo mission in 1490.\r\n\r\n*_João de Coimbra_, pilot of the _S. Raphael_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p.\r\n279). A negro slave belonging to him deserted at Moçambique (see p. 30).\r\n\r\n_Pero Escolar_, pilot of the _Berrio_ (Barros, _ib._; Faria y Sousa,\r\np. 29). On February 18, 1500, the King granted him a pension of 4,000\r\nreis. He went as pilot with Cabral.\r\n\r\n_Gonçalo Alvares_, master of the _S. Gabriel_ (Barros, _ib._). He\r\nsubsequently held the office of pilot-major of India (Correa, _Lendas_,\r\nI, p. 570). On January 26, 1504, the King granted him a pension of\r\n6,000 reis (Texeira de Aragão, _Boletim_, 1886, p. 674).\r\n\r\n_André Gonçalves._ According to Correa (_Lendas_, I, p. 148), he had\r\nbeen with Vasco da Gama, whose interest had procured him an appointment\r\nin Cabral’s fleet. The same untrustworthy author states (p. 152) that\r\nCabral sent him back from Brazil with the news of his discovery, and\r\nthat the King, immediately after his arrival, fitted out a fleet to\r\ncontinue the explorations in the New World. Barros (I, pt. 1, p. 384)\r\nand Castanheda (I, p. 97) state that Cabral sent back Gaspar de Lemos.\r\nNeither they, nor, as far as I am aware, any other authority, mention\r\nan André Gonçalves in connection with Gama’s or Cabral’s expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURSERS OR CLERKS.\r\n\r\n*_Diogo Dias_, clerk of the _S. Gabriel_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 279;\r\nCastanheda, I, pp. 54, 80; Goes, I, p. 90; Faria y Sousa, I, p. 29). He\r\nwas a brother of Bartholomeu Dias, the discoverer of the Cape of Good\r\nHope.\r\n\r\n_João de Sá_, clerk of the _S. Raphael_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 370;\r\nCastanheda, Goes, Faria y Sousa). He again went to India with Cabral\r\n(Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 403), and subsequently became treasurer of the\r\nIndia House (Castanheda, I, p. 54).\r\n\r\n_Alvaro de Braga_, clerk of the _Berrio_ (Barros, Castanheda, Goes).\r\nVasco appointed him head of the factory at Calecut. Correa (_Lendas_,\r\nI, pp. 89-91) erroneously calls him Pedro de Braga. He was rewarded by\r\nthe King, February 1, 1501 (_Boletim_, 1886, p. 675).\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERPRETERS.\r\n\r\n*_Martim Affonso_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 289; Castanheda, I, p. 15;\r\nGoes, I, p. 74; Faria y Sousa, p. 29). He had lived in Congo.\r\n\r\n_Fernão Martins_ (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 290; Castanheda, I, pp. 51, 54;\r\nGoes, I, p. 89). Vasco sent him to the King of Calecut, and he was\r\npresent at the audience which Vasco had of the King (Goes, I, p. 95).\r\nSubsequently he filled several positions of trust in India. He is the\r\n“African slave” who spoke Arabic, referred to by Correa (Stanley’s\r\n_Vasco da Gama_, pp. 76, 203).\r\n\r\n_João Martins_, see João Nunez, _infra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIESTS.\r\n\r\n_Pedro de Covilhã_, called Pero de Cobillones by Faria y Sousa (I, p.\r\n29), who refers to ancient documents and the assertion of F. Christoval\r\nOsorio, of the Order of Trinity, as his authorities. He was Prior of\r\na monastery of the Order of the Trinity at Lisbon, and went out as\r\nChaplain of the Fleet and Father Confessor. According to Francisco de\r\nSousa’s _Oriente Conquistado_, I, p. 477, he died a martyr on July\r\n7, 1498, and this statement is accepted by P. Francisco de S. Maria\r\n(_Anno historico_, II, Lisbon, 1794, p. 323). Fr. Jeronymo de São Jose\r\n(_Historia chronologica da Ordem da S. Trindade_, Lisbon, 1789-94)\r\nenlarges upon this by stating that this apocryphal “protomartyr” of\r\nIndia “was speared whilst expounding the doctrines of the Trinity”.\r\nAt the date of his alleged death, Vasco da Gama was still at Calecut.\r\nHe may have died of disease. Neither Barros, Castanheda, nor Correa\r\nmentions the name of this priest.\r\n\r\n_João Figueiro._ Correa claims to have derived much information from\r\na diary kept by this priest, of which only fragments appear to have\r\ncome into his possession. Other authors ignore the name (see Stanley’s\r\n_Vasco da Gama_, pp. ii, vi, 260).\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILORS AND SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n_João d’Ameixoeira_ or _Dameiroeiro_. According to Correa (I, p. 136),\r\nhe was one of the mutineers who returned to Portugal. No other writer\r\nmentions him.\r\n\r\n_Pedro de Faria e Figueiredo_, died at Cabo das Correntes (Faria y\r\nSousa, I, p. 29).\r\n\r\n_Francisco de Faria e Figueiredo_, brother of the preceding. He wrote\r\nLatin verses. He, too, died at Cabo das Correntes (Faria y Sousa, I, p.\r\n29).\r\n\r\n*_Sancho Mexia_, incidentally mentioned in the _Roteiro_ (see p. 6).\r\n\r\n_João Palha_, one of the thirteen who attended Vasco da Gama to Calecut\r\n(Correa, I, p. 96).\r\n\r\n_Gonçalo Pirez_, a mariner and retainer of Vasco da Gama (Castanheda,\r\nI, p. 54). On May 31, 1497, he had been appointed master of a caravel\r\nrecently built at Oporto (Texeira de Aragão, _Boletim_, 1886, p. 563).\r\n\r\n_Leonardo Ribeyro._ According to Manuel Correa’s commentary on the\r\n_Obras do grande Camões_, Lisbon, 1720, this, on the authority of the\r\npoet himself, is the full name of the “Leonardo” mentioned in Canto\r\nVI, stanza 40. Faria y Sousa (_Asia Portuguesa_, I, p. 29) identified\r\nthis “Leonardo” with Francisco de Faria e Figueredo, but subsequently\r\n(_Commentos aos Lusiadas_, 1639) he gave up the point.\r\n\r\n_João de Setubal_, according to Correa (I, pp. 96, 104, 107), was one\r\nof the thirteen who accompanied Vasco da Gama to Calecut (see Stanley’s\r\n_Vasco da Gama_, pp. 119, 213).\r\n\r\n_Alvaro Velho_, a soldier (Castanheda, I, p. 54; Goes, I, p. 90; Faria\r\ny Sousa). Perhaps this is the Alvaro Velho de Barreyro mentioned\r\nby Valentin Ferdinand (Valentino de Moravia or Alemão), in his\r\n_Description of Africa_ (1507), as having resided eight years at Sierra\r\nLeone (see Kunstmann, in _Abhdlgn. d. bayer. Ak. d. W., Cl. iij_, t.\r\nIX, Abt. 1).\r\n\r\n*_Fernão Veloso_, a soldier (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 283-6; Castanheda,\r\nI, p. 9; Goes, I, p. 71; Faria y Sousa; Camoens, Canto VI, stanza 41).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVICTS OR BANISHED MEN (DEGRADADOS).\r\n\r\n_Pedro Dias_, nicknamed “Northeasterling”. Correa (_Lendas_, I, p.\r\n46) says that Vasco da Gama left him behind at Moçambique, and that\r\nsubsequently he came to India (compare Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p.\r\n106).\r\n\r\n_Pero Esteves._ Correa (_Lendas_, I, p. 236) says that Vasco da Gama\r\nleft him behind at Quiloa, and that when J. da Nova reached that port\r\nin 1501, he came out to meet him. Barros (I, pt. 1, p. 467) says that\r\nthe convict who met J. da Nova had been landed by Cabral, and that his\r\nname was Antonio Fernandez.\r\n\r\n_João Machado_, according to Correa (_Lendas_, I, pp. 41, 160), was\r\nleft behind by Vasco da Gama at Moçambique, but according to Barros (I,\r\npt. 1, p. 406) it was Cabral who left him at Melinde, with instructions\r\nto make inquiries about Prester John. Cabral may have transferred him\r\nfrom Moçambique to the more northern port. He subsequently did good\r\nservice, and Affonso de Albuquerque appointed him alcaide mór of Goa.\r\nHe was slain in battle, 1515 (see Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 93-5).\r\n\r\n_Damião Rodriguez_ was a friend of João Machado, and a seaman on board\r\nthe _S. Gabriel_, from which vessel he deserted at the shoals of S.\r\nRaphael. When Cabral came to Moçambique, his grave was pointed out. All\r\nthis is stated on the sole authority of Correa (_Lendas_, I, p. 160).\r\nCompare Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 94.\r\n\r\n_João Nunez_, a “new” Christian (_i.e._, a converted Jew), who knew a\r\nlittle Arabic and Hebrew, and was landed at Calecut. In the Portuguese\r\nedition of Correa (I, p. 78) he is erroneously called João Martins (see\r\nStanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 159, 180, 206).\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVES AND OTHERS EMBARKED IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\n*_Gaspar da Gama._ This is the “Moor”, or renegade, who joined Vasco\r\nda Gama at Anjediva Island. Our anonymous author describes him as\r\nabout forty years of age, and as being able to speak “Venetian” well.\r\nHe claimed to have come to India in early youth, and was at the time\r\nin the service of the Governor of Goa. Vasco da Gama carried him to\r\nPortugal, where he was baptized and received the name of Gaspar da\r\nGama. In the _Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque_ (Hakluyt Society,\r\n1884) he is frequently referred to as Gaspar da India. Correa (_Lendas\r\nda India_) usually refers to him as Gaspar da Gama, but also calls him\r\nGaspar de las Indias, or Gaspar d’Almeida. King Manuel, in his letter\r\nto the Cardinal Protector, calls him a “Jew, who turned Christian, a\r\nmerchant and lapidary”. Sernigi (see p. 136) held a conversation with\r\nhim at Lisbon. He speaks of him as a Sclavonian Jew, born at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nAccording to the information given by Barros and Goes, the parents\r\nof Gaspar fled from Posen, in Poland, at the time when King Casimir\r\ncruelly persecuted the Jews (about 1456). After a short residence in\r\nPalestine they removed to Alexandria, where Gaspar was born (Barros, I,\r\npt. 1, pp. 364-5; Goes, pt. 1, c. 44).\r\n\r\nHe accompanied Cabral as interpreter. Vespucci met him on his homeward\r\nvoyage at Cape Verde, and in his letter of June 4, 1501, published by\r\nBaldelli (_Il Milione_, 1827), he speaks highly of Gaspar’s linguistic\r\nattainments, and refers to his extensive travels in Asia.\r\n\r\nGaspar repeatedly accompanied Portuguese expeditions to India, and was\r\nlast heard of in 1510. Goes (_loc. cit._) says that King Manuel liked\r\nhim, and appointed him a cavalier of his household.\r\n\r\nCorrea (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 247) describes this Gaspar as\r\na Jew, who, “at the taking of Granada was a very young man; and who,\r\nhaving been driven from his country, passed through many lands ... on\r\nto India”. But, as Granada was only taken in 1492, this is absurd.\r\n\r\nLunardo da Chá Masser, who came to Lisbon in 1504 as ambassador of\r\nthe Signoria, in a letter written about 1506 and first published in\r\nthe _Archivio Storico Italiano_ (Florence, 1846), says that Gaspar\r\nmarried a Portuguese lady,[423] and was granted a pension of 170 ducats\r\nannually, in recognition of the valuable information which he furnished\r\nrespecting the Oriental trade.\r\n\r\n*_Monçaide_, who came on board Vasco da Gama’s vessel at Calecut,\r\nis stated by Barros (I, pt. 1, pp. 330 _et seq._) and Goes (I, p.\r\n98) to have been a native of Tunis, who, in the time of King John II\r\nhad done business with the Portuguese at Oran, and spoke Castilian.\r\nHe accompanied Vasco da Gama to Portugal and was baptised. In King\r\nManuel’s letter to the Cardinal Protector he is referred to as a “Moor\r\nof Tunis”. The author of the _Roteiro_ calls him a “Moor of Tunis” whom\r\nthe Moors of Calecut suspected of being a Christian and emissary of the\r\nKing of Portugal (p. 75).\r\n\r\nCorrea (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 162-5, 221) says that he was\r\na native of Seville, who, having been captured when five years old,\r\nturned Moslem, although “in his soul he was still a Christian”. He\r\ngenerally refers to this man as “the Castilian”, and says that his true\r\nname was Alonso Perez.\r\n\r\nCastanheda (I, p. 50) tells us that the Portuguese corrupted Monçaide\r\ninto Bontaibo, a combination of the Portuguese _bom_, “good”, and the\r\nArabic _tayyib_, having the same meaning. Monçaide is probably a\r\ncorruption of El Masud, the “happy-one” (Burton’s _Camoens_, iv, p. 432).\r\n\r\n*_Malemo Canaqua_, or _Cana_, the pilot who guided Vasco da Gama from\r\nMelinde to Calecut. He was a native of Gujarat (Barros, I, pt. 1, pp.\r\n319, 328, 330; Goes, I, c. 38; Castanheda, I, p. 41). Malemo stands\r\nfor “muallim” or “mallim”, “master” or “teacher”, the usual native\r\ndesignation of the skipper of a vessel, whilst “Kanaka” designates the\r\npilot’s caste.\r\n\r\n_Davane_, of Cambay, said to have been taken out of a dhau to the south\r\nof Moçambique, to have agreed to accompany Vasco da Gama to Calecut as\r\nbroker, and to have been ultimately discharged with good testimonials\r\nin November 1498 at Cananor, is only mentioned by Correa (Stanley’s\r\n_Vasco da Gama_, pp. 79, 84, 113, 128, 235). No other historian knows\r\nanything about this mythical personage.\r\n\r\n*_Baltasar_, and the four other Moors, forcibly carried away from\r\nCalecut (see pp. 73, 75, and 79, and King Manuel’s letter to the\r\nCardinal Protector, p. 115) were taken back by Cabral, as was also\r\nthe Ambassador of the King of Melinde (_Alguns Documentos do Archivo\r\nnacional_, 1892, p. 97).\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama originally detained eighteen “Moors”. He is stated in the\r\n“Journal” to have subsequently liberated six, and to have sent one with\r\na letter to the Zamorin. This would leave eleven, not five. The number\r\nof those liberated must, therefore, have been twelve, and not six.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALECUT IN 1876.\r\n\r\n(_From a Sketch by Mr. Herbert Johnson._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King was at Montemór o novo[424] when he despatched Vasco da Gama\r\nand his fellow-commanders upon the momentous expedition which was to\r\nplace Portugal for a time in the forefront of maritime and commercial\r\npowers. It was summer, and His Majesty did not, therefore, desert the\r\nbeautiful hills of Monfurado for the stifling heat of the capital, in\r\norder that he might witness the embarkation of his “loyal vassal” whom,\r\non account of his proved valour and past services he had deemed worthy\r\nof the honourable distinction of being entrusted with the conduct of so\r\nimportant an enterprise.[425] Vasco da Gama and his officers, the night\r\nbefore their departure, kept vigil in the chapel of Our Lady of Belem,\r\nwhich was not then a stately pile such as that which now occupies the\r\nsite of the original unostentatious _ermida_ founded by Prince Henry\r\nfor the convenience of mariners.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, which was Saturday, the 8th of July,\r\n1497,[426] Vasco da Gama and his companions were escorted to the beach\r\nby a procession of priests and friars. They all carried lighted tapers,\r\nand an excited crowd muttered responses to the litany which was being\r\nintoned by the priests. On reaching the place of embarkation, the vicar\r\nof the chapel celebrated mass and received a general confession; after\r\nwhich, in virtue of a Bull published by Pope Nicholas V in 1452, he\r\nabsolved the departing adventurers of their sins. And thus they left on\r\ntheir errand with the blessings of the Church, in the favour of their\r\nKing, and amidst the acclamations of a sympathising people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lisbon to the Cape Verde Islands._\r\n\r\nWinds and currents being favourable, the voyage to the Cape\r\nVerde Islands was accomplished in good time, and the flag-ship,\r\nnotwithstanding some delay caused by a dense fog on the Saharan coast,\r\nreached the Ilha do Sal, 1,590 miles from Lisbon, in the course of\r\nfourteen days, if not earlier, and on July 27th the little armada lay\r\nsnugly in the harbour of São Thiago.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Voyage across the Southern Atlantic._\r\n\r\nThe accounts of Vasco da Gama’s remarkable voyage across the Southern\r\nAtlantic are of so scanty a nature that it is quite impossible to lay\r\ndown his track with certainty. What we learn from the “Journal” may be\r\ncondensed into a few words. The little armada left São Thiago on August\r\n3rd, _going east_! On the 18th of that month, when 200 leagues (680\r\nmiles) out at sea, the main-yard of the flagship sprung in a squall,\r\nand this necessitated laying to for a couple of days and a night. On\r\nthe 22nd of October,[427] when 800 leagues (2,700 miles) out at sea,\r\ngoing S. by W.,[428] large birds were seen flying to the S.S.E. as if\r\nmaking for the land, as also a whale.[429] On October 27th more whales\r\nwere seen, besides seals. On November 4th, at 9 A.M., the main land was\r\nsighted, probably about 150 miles to the north of St. Helena Bay (30°\r\nS.).\r\n\r\nIn these days of hydrographic offices and sailing directories we know\r\nhow a sailing vessel desirous of proceeding from the Cape Verde Islands\r\nto the Cape would shape her course. She would endeavour to cross the\r\nequator about long. 22° W., pass to the leeward of Trinidad Island\r\n(20° S.), and then, gradually gaining a higher latitude, trust to the\r\n“brave” westerly winds carrying her beyond Tristão da Cunha to the\r\nCape, or beyond.[430]\r\n\r\nBut Vasco da Gama had none of this information to guide him in shaping\r\nhis course. He was informed, as a matter of course, about the winds\r\nand currents prevailing off the Guinea coast, but of what might be\r\nexperienced in the open sea beyond he knew nothing.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that he may have considered the possibility of\r\nreaching the Cape by a direct course of 3,770 miles, and he may even\r\nhave attempted to carry out such a scheme. In the end, however, he\r\nwould never have been able to work down against the strong S.E.\r\n“trades” and northern currents, for his ships could not be laid\r\nnearer than six points to the wind, and even then they would have made\r\nconsiderable leeway.\r\n\r\nHis actual course, in any case, must have been a circuitous one, and\r\nwe may suppose it to have been as follows:—Having left São Thiago in\r\nan easterly direction,[431] he kept in the direction of the coast\r\nfor a considerable distance, but when he came within the influence\r\nof the dreaded _doldrums_ he met with unpleasant weather in the\r\nshape of calms, baffling winds, and squalls, which prevail more\r\nespecially during the months of June, July, and August. One of these\r\nsqualls sprung the mainyard of the flagship, and heaving up a new\r\nyard necessitated a delay of two days and a night. When attempting to\r\nmake southing he was driven to the westward, but managed to cross the\r\nequator in about 19° west.\r\n\r\nThence he followed a circuitous course, which brought him within 600\r\nmiles of the coast of Brazil. The northern part of this assumed course\r\nlies to the west of a track recommended by Captain Horsburgh as being\r\nmost favourable for vessels proceeding between April and October from\r\nthe Cape Verdes to St. Helena, whilst its southern part lies to the\r\nwest of the usual track of sailing vessels going from Ascension to the\r\nCape. In this manner we suppose Vasco da Gama to have reached lat. 30°\r\nS. long. 15° W., by October 22nd. This point lies about 800 leagues, or\r\n2,700 miles, in a direct line from São Thiago; but by the track assumed\r\nby us the distance is 1,030 leagues, or 3,480 miles. As Vasco da Gama\r\nspent eighty days in making this distance, including the time lost in\r\nrepairing his yard, his daily run only amounted to 44 miles.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Vasco da Gama saw birds flying to the S.S.E. They\r\nwere no doubt making for Tristão da Cunha, which lies at a distance of\r\nabout 400 miles in that direction. He also saw a whale, a very common\r\nsight in these latitudes.[432]\r\n\r\nThus far the course followed had been more or less southerly, but Vasco\r\nda Gama had now passed beyond the S.E. “trades”, and found himself\r\nunder the welcome influence of “brave” west winds and of an eastern\r\ncurrent, running at the rate of a knot in the hour. This speeded him on\r\nhis course, and he covered the 500 leagues, or 1,700 miles, which still\r\nseparated him from the west coast of Africa, in the course of thirteen\r\ndays, making his first landfall on November 4th in about 30° S. His\r\naverage daily run on this course must, therefore, have amounted to 131\r\nmiles.[433]\r\n\r\nThis may seem a high rate, but it is by no means an exceptional one.\r\nVasco himself made at least 114 miles daily during his passage from\r\nLisbon to the Cape Verdes, and 125 between the Cape and the Guinea\r\ncoast when homeward bound. Columbus, during his first voyage, averaged\r\n84 miles[434] daily between Gomera and Guanahani, but on nine days his\r\ndaily run exceeded 150 miles, and on one day—the 4th of September—he\r\nactually covered 210 miles, although he had to take into account the\r\nbad sailing qualities of one of his vessels, the _Niña_.\r\n\r\nWe have laid down Vasco da Gama’s hypothetical track with a\r\nconsiderable amount of diffidence. The passage might, of course,\r\nhave been effected in various other ways.[435] When Cabral started\r\nfor India in 1500 he was instructed by Vasco da Gama himself to sail\r\nsouthward from the Cape Verde Islands, until he should have reached the\r\nlatitude of the Cape, and then to head to the east. Cabral, however,\r\nwas carried by winds and currents towards Brazil, which he made in lat.\r\n17° 20´ S., and thence followed a track which took him past Trinidad\r\nand Fernão Vaz,[436] and does not differ much from that now recommended\r\nto sailing vessels.\r\n\r\nJoão da Nova, who left for India in March 1501, did not follow the\r\nroute of his predecessor, perhaps on account of the terrible disaster\r\nwhich overtook Cabral when in the vicinity of Tristão da Cunha. Nova\r\nseems to have attempted a direct passage; for following perhaps the\r\neastern route recommended to a later generation by Laurie’s _Sailing\r\nDirectory for the Ethiopic Ocean_ (4th edition, by A. G. Finlay, p.\r\n74), he discovered the island of Ascension on the outward voyage, and\r\nis generally credited with having reached the Cape without coming\r\nwithin sight of the coast of Brazil.[437]\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama, during his second voyage in 1502, seems to have seen\r\nno land from the time he left Cape Verde until he arrived at Sofala,\r\nthat is, during ninety-nine days, viz., from March 7th to June 14th: a\r\nremarkably quick passage. He seems on that occasion to have given the\r\nCape of Good Hope a wide berth.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, Estevão da Gama, who left Lisbon on April 1st, took\r\nthe western route. He passed the Cape Verde Islands on April 15th,\r\nTrinidad,[438] in the Southern Atlantic, on May 18th, doubled the Cape\r\nabout the beginning of June, and first made land, on July 11th, at the\r\nCabo Primeiro, on the coast of Natal, one hundred and two days after\r\nhis departure from Lisbon.\r\n\r\nWhen Affonso de Albuquerque reached Cape Verde on his voyage to India,\r\nin 1503, he took counsel with his pilots whether to follow the “usual\r\nroute” along the coast of Africa, or to make boldly for mid-ocean. The\r\nlatter course was decided upon. After a voyage of twenty-eight days,\r\nthe Island of Ascension[439] was reached, at an estimated distance of\r\n750 to 800 leagues from the Cape. Subsequently de Albuquerque touched\r\nthe coast of Brazil, and then stood across the Atlantic for the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, which he made on July 6th, having thus accomplished the\r\npassage from Lisbon in the course of ninety-one days.\r\n\r\nDuarte Pacheco, who wrote his _Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis_ in 1505,\r\nrecommends vessels to go south from Cape Verde for 600 leagues, to lat.\r\n19° S., and thence to make for a point 40 leagues to the S.W. of the\r\nCape of Good Hope, in lat. 37° S. Such a course would take a vessel to\r\nthe windward of Trinidad.\r\n\r\nThese notes prove that the Portuguese, in the course of a few years,\r\nmust have acquired a remarkably correct knowledge of the winds and\r\ncurrents of the Southern Atlantic; for the tracks laid down and\r\nfollowed by their pilots in the beginning of the sixteenth century\r\ndiffer but little, if at all, from those recommended in our modern\r\nsailing directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doubling the Cape_.\r\n\r\nThree days after his landfall we find Vasco da Gama in the Bay of St.\r\nHelena, where he careened his ships, took in a fresh supply of water,\r\nand observed the latitude.[440]\r\n\r\nHe left this anchorage on November 16th. Two days afterwards he sighted\r\nthe Cape, but the wind being from the S.S.W. he was obliged to stand\r\noff and on until the 22nd, when he succeeded in getting beyond it\r\n“without encountering the storms and perils expected by the mariners”;\r\nand following the coast he cast anchor in the Bay of S. Braz on the\r\n25th, and there set up his first padrão. In that run he must have been\r\nfavoured by the wind, which along the coast and in November blows\r\ngenerally from the S.E., although westerly winds and even gales are not\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\nBarros, Castanheda, and Goes give the same account of the doubling of\r\nthe Cape, but Correa would have us believe that Vasco da Gama, after\r\nhaving made a landfall to the north of the Cape, stood out for the open\r\nsea for a month, until there were scarcely six hours of sunlight in the\r\nday; and that, even after that, and after he had once more failed to\r\nreach the southern extremity of Africa, he continued south for two more\r\nmonths. Then at last he turned again to the east, and found that he\r\nhad doubled the Cape. Beyond it he discovered lofty mountains and many\r\nrivers, one of which was ascended by Coelho for twenty leagues.[441]\r\nThe utter absurdity of this account is evident, and it is surprising\r\nthat it should have been accepted by serious historians. A day of six\r\nhours may be experienced in lat. 58° 30´ S. in mid-winter—that is in\r\nJune—but nowhere in the southern hemisphere during summer. In November\r\nthe duration of daylight in that latitude is about sixteen hours,\r\nand to talk about “darkness” under these circumstances seems absurd.\r\nIt would, moreover, have been impossible to reach so high a latitude\r\nwithout coming amidst masses of drift-ice, which surely would have\r\nproved a stranger experience to Vasco’s companions than “tremendous\r\nseas” and “high winds”, and better worth recording.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Along the East Coast of Africa._\r\n\r\nOn December 8th Vasco left the Bay of S. Braz, and four days afterwards\r\nexperienced a heavy westerly gale (p. 18).\r\n\r\nBarros, Goes, and Castanheda refer to this gale, but Correa, not\r\ncontent with a gale, conjures up a succession of storms, continuing for\r\ndays, so that the crews clamoured to be taken back to Portugal. The men\r\nin Coelho’s ships are actually said to have conspired to mutiny at\r\nthe earliest opportunity. Their intention, we are expected to believe,\r\nwas made known to the captain-major by a mysteriously-worded message\r\nshouted from ship to ship by Coelho. Vasco at once summoned his people,\r\ndeclared to them that “if the bad weather came again he had determined\r\nto put back; but to disculpate himself with the King it was necessary\r\nfor some among them to sign a document giving the reasons for putting\r\nback.” Having invited on this pretence his pilot, his master and three\r\nleading seamen into his cabin, he treacherously put them in irons, and,\r\nflinging all the instruments necessary for navigating the ship into\r\nthe sea, declared that God would henceforth be their master and pilot.\r\nThe men were released on reaching the River of Mercy, but on their\r\nreturn to Portugal they were ironed once more, to be presented in that\r\ndegrading state to their King![442]\r\n\r\nOsorio[443] likewise gives an account of a mutiny, but says that it\r\noccurred before the Cape was doubled. He differs in other respects\r\nfrom Correa, stating, for instance, that “_all_ the pilots were put\r\nin chains.” As Osorio’s book was published in 1571, whilst Correa’s\r\nMS., although written in 1561, only reached Lisbon in 1583, it is not\r\nprobable that the former borrowed from the latter. They may both have\r\nderived their information from the same impure source, and accepted\r\nan idle tradition as the record of a fact. That there may have been\r\nsome discontent among the men is quite possible, but we cannot\r\nbelieve that the pilots intended to head a mutiny. We quite agree\r\nwith Professor Kopke,[444] when he prefers the authority of Barros,\r\nGoes, and Castanheda, and of the author of this “Journal”, to that of\r\nOsorio. This applies with still greater force to the absurdly elaborate\r\naccount of Correa. Professor A. Herculano, in the second edition of\r\nthe _Roteiro_ (p. viii), discredits Professor Kopke’s notes on the\r\ninsufficient ground that the eminent authorities referred to above\r\nrefrained from every allusion to a mutiny from a “fear of tarnishing\r\nthe fame of Vasco da Gama’s companions.” But Herculano believed in\r\nCorrea—we do not.\r\n\r\nEarly on December 15th, Vasco once more made for the land, and found\r\nhimself abreast, the Ilhéos Chãos (Bird islands) in Algoa Bay, having\r\nthus covered only a couple of hundred miles in the course of seven\r\ndays. Fair progress was made for a couple of days after this. The\r\nvessels kept near the coast, and being favoured by the wind, and also\r\nby an inshore counter-current, were able to pass beyond the pillar set\r\nup by Dias and the furthest point reached by that navigator. But on\r\nDecember 17th the wind sprang round to the east. Vasco da Gama stood\r\nout to sea, and was thus made to experience the full force of the\r\nAgulhas current, which here runs at a distance of about ten miles from\r\nthe land. He was unable to make head against the combined forces of\r\nwind and current, and when, on December 20th, he again approached the\r\nland he found himself at the Ilhéo da Cruz, 27 miles to the westward of\r\nthe group of islets from which he had started on the 15th (see p. 15).\r\n\r\nHenceforth, for a number of days, the wind proved propitious, and by\r\nDecember 25th our voyagers, clinging all the while to the coast, had\r\nproceeded 240 miles beyond the furthest point reached by Dias (as\r\nestimated by the pilots); and three days afterwards they cast anchor\r\nand took a quantity of fish. This locality we identify with Durnford\r\nPoint—the Ponta da Pescaria of the old charts—300 miles beyond the Rio\r\nde Infante (which was Dias’s furthest), and 370 miles beyond the Ilhéo\r\nda Cruz. The daily run since December 20th had thus averaged 46 miles.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama then stood off the land, for reasons not given by any\r\nof the historians. Whether it was from fear of being driven upon a\r\nlee-shore by a strong easterly wind, or the hope of being able to\r\nshorten his passage by a more direct north-easterly course, we are\r\nunable to tell. However that may be, a fortnight passed before the\r\nvessels returned to the land, so that drinking-water began to fail, and\r\nthe men had to be put on short rations. It was on the 11th of January\r\nthat Vasco da Gama found himself off the mouth of a small river, the\r\nRio do Cobre, where he established friendly relations with the “good\r\npeople” of a country ruled by petty chiefs.[445] The distance of\r\nthis river from the “Fishing Point” is only 315 miles, and contrary\r\nwinds must therefore have driven the little flotilla far out of its\r\ndirect course, but not as far as the neighbourhood of Madagascar, for\r\nsoutherly winds would have been picked up there, which would have\r\ncarried it more speedily towards its destination than was possible in\r\nthe face of the south-easterly winds prevailing along the coast of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of five days, Vasco da Gama left the Rio do Cobre on\r\nJanuary 16th, and without further incident, and leaving Sofala far\r\nto the west, he arrived off the mouth of the Rio dos Bons Signaes\r\n(Kilimani) on January 24th, having thus accomplished a distance of 480\r\nmiles in eight days. Coelho’s caravel at once crossed the bar to take\r\nsoundings, and the two ships followed on the next day. In this river\r\nVasco da Gama stayed 31 days, careening his vessels, refreshing his\r\ncrews, and erecting a padrão dedicated to S. Raphael (see p. 19). It\r\nwas here that he heard the glad tidings of more civilised regions in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nOn February 24th the vessels once more gained the open sea, and\r\nfollowing the coast for six days arrived off Mozambique on March 2nd.\r\nDuring this voyage of 330 miles they kept outside the islands which\r\nhere skirt the coast, and lay to at night, as usual, which accounts for\r\nthe slow rate of progress made during this coasting voyage. Coelho,\r\nas before, led the way, and entered by the shallow southern channel,\r\nbetween the islands of S. Thiago and S. Jorge. The three vessels\r\nanchored in front of the town (see p. 23). Later on they removed to\r\nthe island of S. Jorge, where mass was read on March 12th, after which\r\nthe little flotilla set sail for the north. Two days afterwards, the\r\nSoriza Peaks rose in the distance. In the course of that day they were\r\nbecalmed. A light easterly wind arose, and at night on the 14th they\r\nstood off shore; and when in the morning of the 15th they looked about\r\nthem, they found that the Mozambique current, which here frequently\r\nruns at the rate of two to four knots to the southward, had swept\r\nthem twelve miles abaft Mozambique. Sailing vessels are advised,[446]\r\nunder such circumstances, to stand to the eastward for sixty miles or\r\nmore, and regain their northing beyond the influence of the southerly\r\ncurrent. Of course, Vasco da Gama knew nothing about all this.\r\nFortunately, he was able to recover his old anchorage at the island of\r\nS. Jorge in the course of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nA fresh start was made on March 29th. This time the wind was\r\nfavourable. The Moorish pilot whom Vasco da Gama had on board took him\r\npast Kilwa, which the captain would have liked to have visited, and\r\nshaped a course outside Mafia, Zanzibar and the other islands lying\r\noff that coast. Early on April 7th the _S. Raphael_ ran aground near\r\nMtangata, but was speedily got off; and on April 7th Vasco da Gama cast\r\nanchor in the outer road of Mombasa, the finest port on the whole\r\ncoast of Eastern Africa. The distance thus accomplished in the course\r\nof nine days was 690 miles (see p. 34).\r\n\r\nSixty miles more brought the Portuguese to the roadstead of Melinde,\r\nwhere they cast anchor on April 14th, and remained until the 24th. This\r\nwas the only town at which they met with a cordial reception (p. 40).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Across the Arabian Gulf to Calecut._\r\n\r\nOn April 24th Vasco da Gama, who had secured the services of a Gujarati\r\npilot, started for India. By that time the S.W. monsoon was blowing\r\nsteadily, though not as yet very strongly. The African coast was kept\r\nin sight for a couple of days, after which the vessels stood boldly\r\nacross the “Great Gulf.” They passed in all probability to the south of\r\nthe _Baixos de Padua_. They had been twenty-one days at sea, and were\r\nstill 24 miles from the land, when there rose in front of them a lofty\r\nwooded mountain. This was Mount Eli, 2,220 miles from Melinde, and the\r\nday on which India was first beheld by Europeans who had come direct\r\nfrom a European port was May 18th, a Friday (see p. 47).[447]\r\n\r\nGalvão[448] is the only author who mentions the “Flats of Padua,”[449]\r\nas having been discovered by Vasco da Gama on his outward voyage,\r\nand we freely accept his statement, for the Portuguese must either\r\nhave crossed the Laccadives or passed to the north of them. As these\r\nislands are very low, the author of the _Roteiro_ may not have thought\r\nit worth while to mention them. It is evident, however, from what\r\nSernigi says (p. 134), as also from the evidence of the earliest maps\r\nillustrating this voyage, that the Portuguese learnt a good deal about\r\nthem from the pilots whom they employed.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, having stood off during the night, the\r\ncaptain-major again approached the land, but the western Ghats were\r\nwrapped in clouds, and it rained heavily, so that the pilot failed\r\nto identify the locality. The day after, however, the 20th of May,\r\nhaving passed Monte Formosa (see p. 47, note 6), he recognised the\r\nlofty mountains above Calecut, and in the evening of that day the\r\nlittle fleet was riding at anchor about five miles off Capocate, or\r\nCapua, a small town only seven miles to the north of the much-desired\r\ncity, which was pointed out to the expectant Portuguese (p. 48). Soon\r\nafterwards Vasco da Gama took up a position right in front of that\r\ncity;[450] but on May 27th a pilot of the Zamorin guided him to an\r\nanchorage off Pandarani, thirteen miles to the north, on the ground of\r\nits greater safety, and at that anchorage the Portuguese remained no\r\nless than 88 days, until August 23rd, when Vasco da Gama once more took\r\nup a position four leagues to the leeward of Calecut. From that time\r\nto the day of his final departure, in the afternoon of August 30th,\r\nhe hovered about that city, standing off and on, as the state of the\r\nweather or the exigencies of his relations with the Zamorin required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Voyage Home._\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of August 30th, a tornado carried Vasco da Gama out\r\nto sea (p. 77), and when making his way along the coast he was obliged\r\nto tack, depending for his progress upon land and sea breezes, and\r\nlaying-to when becalmed. At Cananor he sent ashore one of his captives\r\n(p. 79), but held no communication with the town himself. On September\r\n15th he landed on a small island, and erected the padrão dedicated to\r\nSt. Mary (p. 80).[451]\r\n\r\nOn September 20th Vasco da Gama arrived at the Anjediva Islands, about\r\n14° 45´ N., having thus spent twenty-one days in accomplishing 240\r\nmiles. He seems, first of all, to have anchored near the Oyster Rocks,\r\noff the Kalipadi river, but on September 24th he landed on the largest\r\nof these islands, where he remained until October 5th, waiting for a\r\npropitious wind, and availed himself of the enforced leisure to careen\r\nthe flagship and the _Berrio_ (p. 83).\r\n\r\nThe passage across the gulf proved a fearful trial for the Portuguese.\r\nFoul winds and calms impeded their progress, whilst a renewed outbreak\r\nof scurvy carried off thirty victims and prostrated the remaining men,\r\nso that only seven or eight were fit to do duty in each vessel. Vasco\r\nda Gama had left Anjediva on October 5th (a Friday!), although the N.E.\r\nmonsoon only sets in at the end of the month, and ninety days elapsed\r\nbefore the African coast came within sight, near Magadoxo, and five\r\nmore before the hard-proved mariners once more found themselves with\r\nthe friendly Sultan of Melinde (p. 89).\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the voyage home calls for little comment. Having\r\nleft Melinde on January 11th, Vasco da Gama, passing between the\r\nmainland and Zanzibar, stopped for a fortnight at the “baixos” upon\r\nwhich the _S. Raphael_ had run in the outward voyage, and there that\r\ndoomed ship was set on fire, as there were no men left to sail her.\r\nLate on February 1st the remaining two vessels hove to in front of S.\r\nJorge Island, where a padrão was erected on the following morning in\r\ndrenching rain. The voyage was continued without communicating with the\r\ntown of Moçambique, and on March 3rd Vasco once more found himself in\r\nthe Bay of S. Braz.\r\n\r\nThe Cape was doubled on March 20th. The wind proved fair during\r\ntwenty-seven days—that is, to April 16th or 17th—but after came calms\r\nand foul winds; and on April 25th, when the wearied mariners already\r\nbelieved themselves to be near S. Thiago, the pilots told them that\r\nthey had only reached the shoals off the Rio Grande (p. 93).\r\n\r\nHere the two consorts appear to have parted company, under\r\ncircumstances not known; and whilst Vasco da Gama accompanied his dying\r\nbrother to Terçeira, Coelho is said to have made straight for Lisbon,\r\nwhere he arrived, after a voyage of seventy-six days, on July 10th. The\r\ndistance along the coast of Africa is only 1,900 miles, and that by way\r\nof the Azores, the only route at all suitable for sailing vessels, is\r\n2,920 miles. The passage ought certainly to have been accomplished in\r\nforty days.[452] What did he do during the remaining thirty-six days?\r\nWe cannot suppose for one moment that an experienced sailor like Coelho\r\nwould have faced the head-winds of the coast for the sake of shortening\r\nthe distance to be run. Still, such things _have_ happened.\r\n\r\nFrom the following statement of distances run it will be seen that\r\nfrom July 8th, 1497, the day of Vasco da Gama’s departure from Lisbon\r\nto the return of Coelho on July 10th, 1499, there elapsed 732 days,\r\nor two years and two days. Of this time 316 days were expended before\r\nCalecut was reached, 102 at Calecut and in its vicinity, and 314 on the\r\nhomeward passage.[453]\r\n\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------+-------+--------+--------+-------\r\n                                              |       |Old Por-|        |Average\r\n                Dates and Places.             | Days. | tuguse |Nautical| Daily\r\n                                              |       |Leagues.| Miles. |  Run,\r\n                                              |       |  (1)   |        | Miles.\r\n  --------------------------------------------+-------+--------+--------+-------\r\n  Lisbon to S.

In\r\ntracing the progress of his expedition with the aid of charts we are\r\nconsequently dependent upon compilations which, although contemporary,\r\nembody also materials brought home by other navigators.\r\n\r\nOne great drawback of all the charts available for our purpose is their\r\nsmall scale.[457] This compelled their compilers to make a selection\r\nfrom the names which they found inserted upon the larger charts at\r\ntheir disposal, and this selection may not always have been a judicious\r\none. The compilation of a map from discordant materials presents\r\ndifficulties even in the present day, and these difficulties were much\r\ngreater at a time when the compiler had not at his command trustworthy\r\nobservations for latitude which would have enabled him to check the\r\npositions of intermediate places, and bring into agreement the records\r\nbrought home by successive explorers. As an instance, we may mention\r\nthat in the five maps which we shall bring more fully under notice, the\r\nlatitude assigned to the Cape of Good Hope varies between 29° and 34°\r\nS., its true position being 34° 22´ S. As to longitudes, they had to\r\nbe determined by dead reckoning, and it need not therefore surprise us\r\nif, on the maps referred to, the Cape is placed from 3° 50´ to 10° 20´\r\ntoo far to the eastward. Nay, this near approach to the truth, in at\r\nleast one instance, compels our recognition of the skill of the men who\r\npiloted the first ships around that long-sought _Cabo desejado_.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty arises from the crabbed characters employed by\r\nthe map draughtsmen of the early part of the sixteenth century: a\r\ndifficulty all the more serious when these illegible characters had to\r\nbe reproduced by Italians having no knowledge of the language of the\r\ndocuments they used, or the meaning of the uncouth names which they\r\nwere called upon to copy. It is one of the great merits of Mercator\r\nto have caused these characters to be banished from the maps of his\r\ncountrymen; but a second Mercator is still wanted to do the same good\r\nwork for their printed books.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to a consideration of the charts which illustrate more\r\nespecially Vasco da Gama’s first voyage.\r\n\r\nThe first of these charts is by Henricus Martellus Germanus. It is one\r\nof many in a MS., _Insularium illustratum_, now in the British Museum\r\n(Add. MS. 15760). It is a map of the world, very roughly drawn and\r\nwithout a scale, and is dated 1489, that is almost immediately after\r\nthe return of Dias in the December of the preceding year. The author,\r\nno doubt, was an Italian, and other maps by his skilful hand are\r\nknown to exist.[458] Unfortunately for our purpose, the coast beyond\r\nthe Cape is very incorrectly drawn, and there are but six names, viz.,\r\nGolfo dentro delle serre (False Bay), Rio della vacche (Gouritz), Cavo\r\ndalhado (talhado, Seal Point), Golfo de Pastori (St. Francis Bay),\r\nPadrom de S. George (instead of Gregorio), and Ilha de fonte (instead\r\nof infante).[459]\r\n\r\nThe first map illustrating, or rather attempting to illustrate, Vasco\r\nda Gama’s voyage is that compiled by Juan de la Cosa, the famous pilot\r\nof Columbus, in 1500. The author was fairly well informed of the\r\ndiscoveries made by his own countrymen, but knew apparently but little\r\nabout those of the Portuguese. Thus, although Vicente Yanez Pinzon only\r\nreturned to Spain on September 30th, 1500, the coast explored by him\r\nto the westward of the Rostro hermoso (the Cabo de Agostinho of the\r\nPortuguese) is laid down properly; whilst Santa Cruz, discovered by\r\nCabral in April 1500, is incorrectly indicated,[460] although Gaspar de\r\nLemos, whom Cabral sent back with the news of his discovery, arrived in\r\nPortugal three months before the Spanish navigator. As to two groups\r\nof islands in the southern Atlantic, namely, “thebas, yslas tibras\r\netiopicas yn mare oceanum austral” (lat 1° 40´ S.), and “Y. tausens,\r\nylas tausens montises etiopicus oceanas” (lat. 15° S.), they seem to\r\nbe quite imaginary, and I only refer to them here because they kept\r\ntheir place on later maps, and might be mistaken for the islands\r\ndiscovered by João da Nova in 1501-2. Of the results of Vasco da Gama’s\r\nexpedition Juan de la Cosa must have been very ill-informed; among\r\nthe many uncouth and incomprehensible names inserted by him along the\r\nEastern coast of Africa there is not one which can be traced to Gama.\r\nNot even such places as Sofala, Quiloa, Moçambique and Mombaça can be\r\nidentified, whilst Zanzibar and Madagascar lie far out in the Indian\r\nOcean.[461]\r\n\r\nThe coastline of the Indian Ocean is Ptolemaic; there is no hint at\r\nthe peninsular shape of India, the map being in that respect inferior\r\nto that of the Catalan, more than a hundred years older, and the\r\nonly indication of Vasco da Gama’s visit to these seas is the name\r\n“Calicut”, placed on the south coast of Caramania (Kerman), with a\r\nlegend to the east of it: “tierra descubierto por el rey dom Manuel rey\r\nde Portugal.”[462]\r\n\r\nOur next chart shows a great advance upon the preceding. It was\r\npurchased at a sale in London, and is now the property of Dr. Hamy,\r\nwho published a description of it, with facsimiles, in his _Études\r\nhistoriques et géographiques_, Paris, 1896. The author is not known.\r\nHis chart places on record the discoveries made by Vicente Yanez\r\nPinzon, Cabral, Sancho de Toar, and Cortereal, and by the expedition\r\nwhich King Manuel sent to Brazil in 1501, and which returned at\r\nthe beginning of September, 1502.[463] This expedition, which was\r\naccompanied by Vespucci, explored the American coast as far as the\r\nRio de Cananea, in lat. 25° 45´ S. The author knows nothing of the\r\ndiscoveries of João da Nova, who returned to Lisbon on September 11th,\r\n1502. We may therefore safely date his map “1502”, as is done by Dr.\r\nHamy.\r\n\r\nOne curious feature of this map is its double equator: that for the\r\nwestern half of the map being the ‘new’ equator, to which the recent\r\ndiscoveries of the Spaniards and Portuguese are to be referred, whilst\r\nthat for the east lies four degrees to the north of the former, and\r\nis taken from Ptolemy. Indeed, the outline of the Indian Ocean is\r\nPtolemy’s, and so is the nomenclature, with a few exceptions to be\r\nnoticed presently. In the south-east, however, the author has broken\r\nthrough Ptolemy’s encircling barrier, and has thus opened a way from\r\nthe _Indicum mare_ to an outer ocean where room has been found for\r\nSeilam, Iava and far Quinsai. The eastern edge of his Oekumene lies\r\n205° to the east of Lisbon (196° E. of Greenwich).[464] The only\r\noriginal features within the Indian Ocean are a peninsular India,\r\nwhich is made to project from Ptolemy’s old coastline to the west of\r\nTaprobana, with a town, “Colochuti”, and the islands of Madagascar and\r\nTangibar lying far out at sea in lat. 20° S. The only other modern\r\nname within this wide area is “Malacha”, which is placed in the Aurea\r\nChersonesus.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature along the African coast is fairly full, and evidently\r\ntaken from original sources,[465] but the spelling is so corrupt, and\r\nthe letters are frequently so illegible, that I failed to make out many\r\nof the names, although I had that portion of the map which specially\r\ninterested me enlarged from Dr. Hamy’s facsimile by photography. An\r\nexamination of the copy, which I give, will show that the drawing of\r\nthe coast-line leaves very much to be desired.\r\n\r\nA very great advance upon the preceding is shown by a chart which\r\nAlberto Cantino, the correspondent of Hercules d’Este, Duke of Ferrara,\r\ncaused to be specially designed for his patron, at Lisbon, and for\r\nwhich he paid twelve golden ducats. There can be no doubt about the\r\ndate of this map. It was begun after Cortereal’s return, October 11th,\r\n1501, and had been completed some time before November, 1502. The\r\nMS. of this valuable chart is deposited in the Biblioteca Estense at\r\nModena. The American portion of it has been published by Mr. Harrisse\r\n(_Les Cortereals_, Paris, 1888[466]), and the Indian Section by the\r\nVienna Geographical Society.[467] Through the kindness of Signor M. C.\r\nCaputo, librarian of the Biblioteca Estense, who procured for me an\r\nexcellent photograph, I am enabled to publish Africa from the Gulf of\r\nGuinea to Makhdesho. An examination of this reproduction will at once\r\nestablish the superiority of this chart over those already noticed, as\r\nalso over later charts. The outline of Africa is wonderfully correct,\r\nconsidering the age of the chart, and the broad face presented by\r\nthat continent to the south is brought out most satisfactorily.\r\nUnfortunately, several of the names along the south coast are rendered\r\nillegible, even on the original, owing to the coloured Table Mountain,\r\nand I have failed to decipher these satisfactorily, notwithstanding the\r\nkind help afforded me by Signor Caputo. Along the east coast there is a\r\npaucity of names. It should be observed that the padrões and Portuguese\r\nflags have been located somewhat at haphazard.\r\n\r\nWhilst the African coast is taken exclusively from recent Portuguese\r\nsources, that of India and Further India is largely based upon native\r\ninformation. This is proved by some of the legends. At Çatiguam we read\r\n“esta em xi pulgados a o norte,” but these “pulgados” or inches are\r\nclearly the “isbas” of the “Mohit,” a mode of expressing the latitude\r\nwhich is peculiar to the Indian Ocean and has been explained by me on\r\np. 26, note 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sidi Ali Ben Hosein’s MOHIT 1554.]\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the reader to judge of the extent to which the\r\ncompilers of early Portuguese maps were indebted to native sailing\r\ndirectories and charts, and of the judgment exercised by them in\r\ntheir use, I insert here a reduction of Dr. Tomaschek’s elaborate\r\nreconstruction of a chart in accordance with the data contained in\r\nAdmiral Sidi Ali ben Hosein’s “Mohit,” or “Encyclopædia of the Sea,”\r\nwhich, although only written in 1554, embodies the local knowledge\r\ngained in the course of centuries, and is not indebted to Portuguese\r\ncharts for its superiority.[468]\r\n\r\nThe next chart to be considered is by Nicolas de Canerio, of Genoa.\r\nIts date is undoubtedly the same as that of the Cantino Map, that is,\r\nit was drawn before the results of João da Nova’s voyage had become\r\navailable. This is proved by finding “y. tebas, iste insulle chamada\r\nsecular” in the mid-Atlantic (9° S.), with a Portuguese flag, for these\r\nislands are borrowed from Juan de la Cosa, and have nothing to do with\r\nConceiçao (Ascension) or St. Helena, discovered by João da Nova. It is\r\nalmost wholly based upon the materials previously utilised by Cantino’s\r\ndraughtsman, although more detailed in outline and with a more ample\r\nnomenclature in some places. The shape of Africa, however, is far more\r\ncorrectly given on Cantino’s chart than on Canerio’s,[469] and the\r\ntechnical workmanship of the former is of a superior character. The\r\nlegends on both maps have evidently been taken from the same source:\r\nthose on Cantino’s map, as far as I have been able to examine it,\r\nappearing to be more numerous and in some cases fuller.\r\n\r\nThe MS. of this important chart is at present in the Hydrographic\r\nOffice at Paris. Prof. L. Gallois, whose contributions to the history\r\nof geography are highly appreciated by all interested in the subject,\r\nhas given an account of it in the _Bulletin_ of the Geographical\r\nSociety of Lyons.[470] This account is accompanied by a reproduction of\r\ntwo sections of the map, viz., America and Africa. Prof. Gallois has\r\nhad the extreme kindness to supply me with a tracing of the Asiatic\r\nportion of the map, and has thus enabled me to produce Map VII,\r\nillustrating this volume. My reproduction contains all the names of\r\nthe original to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, whilst the legends\r\nfor which there was no room upon the Reduction are given at the end of\r\nthis Appendix.\r\n\r\nOn examining this chart it will at once be seen that the author—not the\r\nItalian copyist, whose name alone appears upon it—drew very largely\r\nupon native information. Still, he has not ventured to disassociate\r\nhimself altogether from Ptolemy. He has, however, made some use of\r\nMarco Polo, though he puts the names taken from him—such as Murfulu,\r\nVar and Coilu—in the wrong places. The island in the middle of the\r\nIndian ocean—Y. rana—is not one of the Mascarenhas, as might be\r\nsupposed, but the Illa Iaua of the Catalan map, that is, Java. The\r\nlegend tells us that “In this island is much benjoim, and silk and\r\nporcelain.” Still further south there are three islands, representing\r\nthe Mascarenhas, then known by Malabari names.\r\n\r\nA few words remain to be said about the Portuguese maps published in\r\nthe Strassburg edition of Ptolemy, in 1513. The originals upon which\r\nthese maps are based were sent to Duke Renée II of Lorraine (died\r\n1508), from Portugal. Uebelin and Essler, the editors of Ptolemy,\r\nstate that they were drawn by an “admiral” of King Ferdinand. But\r\nLelewel[471] points out that the king meant must be D. Manuel of\r\nPortugal. They may have been forwarded together with the French\r\ntranslation of Vespucci’s _Four Voyages_, 1504, and Vespucci may even\r\nhave had something to do with their compilation, even though not the\r\nactual compiler. But however this may be, and whatever the date of\r\nactual publication, there can be no doubt that they are identical in\r\nall essentials with Canerio’s chart, and must be referred to the same\r\ndate, that is 1502.[472]\r\n\r\nOn placing side by side some of the above charts it almost looks as\r\nif they were not merely based upon the same original authorities, but\r\nhad actually been slavishly copied one from the other, or from some\r\ncommon prototype. On a closer examination, however, this opinion is not\r\nsustainable, for the latitudes and longitudes assigned by the authors\r\nto the leading points will be found to differ very considerably. The\r\nfollowing little table show this as regards the latitudes:—\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n     ——      | True Lat.|  Cosa.  |   Hamy.  | Cantino. | Canerio. |Strassburg\r\n             |          |         |          |          |          | Ptolemy.\r\n  -----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  Congo      | 6°  5´ S.|5° 30´ S.| 7° 50´ S.|   6° S.  |  10° S.  |  10° S.\r\n  Cape of    |          |         |          |          |          |\r\n    Good Hope|34° 22´ S.| 29° S.  |30° 40´ S.|32° 45´ S.|  34° S.  |33° 40´ S.\r\n  Malindi    | 3° 20´ S.|    —    |   3° N.  | 3° 25´ S.|   1° S.  |   1° N.\r\n  Calecut    |11° 50´ N.| 18° N.  |  13° N.  |  10° N.  |13° 20´ N.|17° 30´ N.\r\n  Malacca    | 2° 13´ N.|   —     | 2° 30´ N.|  14° S.  |12° 30´ N.|   8° S.\r\n  -----------+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n  The latitudes from Dr. Hamy’s chart are referred to the Western\r\n  Equator.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now append the legends to be found in Canerio’s chart, together with\r\na translation.

Subsequently the bay was dedicated\r\nto S. Catherine.\r\n\r\n[f] “Queimada” means a forest-fire, but there are no “forests”, at all\r\nevents near the coast. The hills, however, are partially covered with\r\nbush, which may have been set on fire.\r\n\r\n[g] This second “golfo dos vaqueiros” may be a duplication.\r\n\r\n[h] Our present Lagoa Bay seems originally to have been called “Bay of\r\nthe Rock”. Subsequently it became known as Bahia dos lobos (Seal Bay)\r\nand Bahia de lagoa (Lagoon Bay), perhaps after the Rio da lagoa (Lagoon\r\nRiver), which figures very prominently on Dr. Hamy’s and Cantino’s\r\nCharts, and almost seems to represent the Rio de Infante in the case of\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe Kasuga River, which is closed at its mouth, and forms a lake-like\r\nexpansion at the back of the dunes, seems to correspond more nearly\r\nwith the conditions required. Several other rivers, to the east and\r\nwest of it, present the same feature, and these may have given rise to\r\nthe designation “Praia das alagôas”, _i.e._, Shore of Lagoons.\r\n\r\nFor identifications of localities within this bay, see p. 14, _note_.\r\n\r\n[i] Thus named after the evergreen oak (_Ilex crocea_), known in South\r\nAfrica as Safraan hout.\r\n\r\n[j] Along this coast the pent-up water of several rivulets soaks\r\nthrough the coast-ridge, giving rise to springs. This may account for\r\nthe “Fountain Rock”.\r\n\r\n[k] Keiskamma Point looks like an island when seen from the sea, and\r\nthis may account for the island of St. Christopher, of the first\r\nexplorers, developing into a river dedicated to the same Saint when the\r\ncountry became better known.\r\n\r\n[l] “Praia corada” (Red shore), I am unable to identify, as there are\r\nno red cliffs along this part of the coast. Perhaps we ought to read\r\n“_cerrada_”, with reference to the rocks which fringe the coast.\r\n\r\n[m] I can make nothing of “Golfo boscho”. Bósco is the Italian for\r\n“wood, forest”, and is the synonym of “bosque” in Portuguese. Woods are\r\nplentiful along this coast.\r\n\r\n[n] For its identification, see p. 17.\r\n\r\n[o] Delagoa Bay seems to have been known originally as “Golfo dos tres\r\nReis magos” (Gulf of the Three Kings); see p. 18, _note_. The Rio do\r\nOuro is the Limpopo.\r\n\r\n[p] See p. 19, _note_: The “barreiras” to the east of it may be a reef\r\nforming a “barrier” along the coast.\r\n\r\n[q] See p. 19, note 1, and p. 21.\r\n\r\n[r] These words prove that the compiler of Dr. Hamy’s Chart was able\r\nto utilise materials brought home by Vasco da Gama’s pilots, for it is\r\njust in this locality that he again turned to the land, and discovered\r\nhis “first islands”. See p. 21.\r\n\r\n[s] See p. 21, note 2.\r\n\r\n[t] “Coraes” means “corals”. “Moçambique Flat” is a great coral bank.\r\n\r\n[u] This river was named after one of Vasco da Gama’s companions.

This\r\nliberality had been called forth by the sensation produced by the\r\ndiscovery of an ocean highway to India, and the expectation that great\r\nwealth would pour into Portugal as a consequence; it was kept alive by\r\nthe persistent importunities of the discoverer.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama certainly did not undervalue the services he had rendered\r\nto the King. He considered himself entitled to a high reward, and in\r\nthe end secured it. His ambition, from the very first, seems to have\r\nbeen to take his place among the territorial nobles of his native\r\nland. His father, Estevão da Gama, had at one time been Alcaide-mór of\r\nSines, he himself had been born at that picturesque old fishing town,\r\nand his desire to be territorially connected with it was therefore\r\nonly natural. The King was quite willing that this should be, but\r\nSines belonged to the Order of S. Thiago, of which D. Jorge, Duke of\r\nCoimbra, a natural son of D. João II, was master; and although a papal\r\ndispensation had been received in 1501, which empowered the Order to\r\nexchange Sines for some other town, the Order refused to part with it\r\n(see Document 1). Meanwhile the King, on February 22, 1501, had granted\r\nVasco da Gama not only an annual pension of 1,000 cruzados (_£_483),\r\nbut also the territorial title of “Dom” (Documents 2 and 3).[474]\r\n\r\nStill further favours were conferred upon Vasco da Gama on January 10,\r\n1502, only one month previous to his second departure for India; and\r\nthis, we are told, was done “freely”, and without these favours having\r\nbeen solicited either by their recipient or by any of his friends (see\r\nDocument 4). These favours included an annual hereditary pension of\r\n300,000 reis (_£_362), the title of “Admiral of India”, with all the\r\nvaluable privileges conferred by it;[475] the right of sending annually\r\nto India 200 cruzados, to be laid out in merchandise, upon which no\r\nimport duties were to be levied, excepting the 5 per cent. claimed by\r\nthe Order of Christ,[476] and confirmation of the hereditary title of\r\n“Dom”, which was also to be borne by his brother Ayres, and in its\r\nfeminine form of “Dona” by his sister Theresa.\r\n\r\nA few months after Vasco da Gama’s return from his second voyage, the\r\nKing, who was especially pleased with the “tribute” received from the\r\nSultan of Kilwa, bestowed upon him a further hereditary pension of\r\n400,000 reis (1,000 cruzados, or _£_483). This was done on February 4,\r\n1504 (Document 5).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the negotiations for putting Gama in possession of Sines\r\nhad made no progress, and the Admiral, impatient of the delay, took\r\nup his residence in that town, began to build himself a manor-house,\r\nand generally conducted himself as if the town were his own. The\r\nalcaidemór, D. Luiz de Noronha, did not venture to interfere, but\r\nthe Order of S. Thiago complained to the King; and the King, justly\r\nincensed at the masterful conduct of his vassal, peremptorily ordered\r\nhis Admiral to quit Sines within thirty days, and not to return to it\r\nexcept by special permission of the Master of S. Thiago. This order was\r\ndated March 21, 1507 (see Document 7). We need scarcely say that it was\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nBut the Admiral still hankered after the territorial honours which had\r\nbeen promised him. He enjoyed already three royal pensions amounting\r\nto 2,750 cruzados (_£_1,328), and Leonardo Masser,[477] the Venetian\r\nAmbassador at Lisbon, estimated the whole of his income at that time at\r\n4,000 ducats, or rather cruzados (_£_1,930). This was a very large sum\r\nindeed. There were at that time only six noblemen, two archbishops, and\r\nseven bishops in all Portugal whose income exceeded his.[478]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1508, the King authorised Luiz d’Arca to cede to Vasco\r\nda Gama the alcaideria-mór of Villafranca de Xira (see Document 8),\r\nbut the negotiations appear to have led to no result. Ten years were\r\nallowed to pass, when the Admiral informed the King that, the promised\r\ntitle of “Count” not having been conferred upon him, he desired\r\npermission to emigrate with his family. The King, on August 17,\r\n1518 (see Document 13), granted this permission, on condition that\r\nthe Admiral should defer his departure until the end of the year.\r\nIn the meantime he seriously looked about him for the territorial\r\nqualification which would enable him to confer upon his importunate\r\nAdmiral the title of Count. D. Jayme, Duke of Bragança, a nephew\r\nof the King, who held Vasco da Gama in high respect, was willing\r\nto accommodate his uncle. By an agreement signed on November 4,\r\n1519, he surrendered the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de Frades,\r\nin consideration of Vasco da Gama ceding to him an hereditary Royal\r\npension of 400,000 reis (1,000 cruzados), and in addition, paying the\r\nsum of 4,000 cruzados in gold. This transaction having been completed\r\nat Evora, on November 7, the King, in Document 16, granted to Vasco da\r\nGama, his heirs and successors, the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de\r\nFrades, together with all revenues and privileges hitherto enjoyed by\r\nthe Duke of Bragança; and on December 29 he conferred upon his Admiral\r\nthe title of “Conde de Vidigueira” (see Documents 14-17).\r\n\r\nAnd thus, when Vasco da Gama, in April, 1524, departed for the last\r\ntime for India, the great ambition of his life had been realised. He\r\ndied at Cochin, on Christmas eve of the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACTS OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n1.—_Lisbon, December 24, 1499._[479]\r\n\r\nBy Letters Patent, dated Lisbon, December 24, 1499, the King, in\r\nrecognition of the merits of Vasco da Gama, and the great services\r\nrendered by him in the discovery of India, grants to him, his heirs\r\nand successors, the town of Sines, together with all the revenues,\r\nprivileges, and tithes pertaining thereto, as well as civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction. But inasmuch as this town belongs to the Order\r\nof São Thiago, the formal title-deeds are to be drawn up only after\r\nthis Order shall have received satisfaction by the grant of another\r\ntown belonging to the Crown, and dispensation of the Holy Father,\r\nsanctioning this exchange, shall have been received.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction was, moreover, to be given to D. Luiz de Noronha, the\r\nalcaide-mór of the said city. But should D. Luiz refuse to surrender\r\nthe said alcaideria, then, the dispensation of the Pope having been\r\nreceived, the King promises at once to put Vasco da Gama in possession\r\nof the said town, and likewise of the castle, as soon as terms shall\r\nhave been arranged with D. Luiz de Noronha.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.—_Lisbon, February 22, 1501._[480]\r\n\r\nD. Manuel orders the Casa da Mina to pay annually to Vasco da Gama the\r\nof sum 1,000 cruzados in gold [at that time equal to 390,000 reis],\r\nuntil he shall have been placed in possession of the manor of Sines.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.—_Lisbon, November 19, 1501._[481]\r\n\r\nThe King orders Gonçalo de Sequeira, chief treasurer of the Casa de\r\nCeuta, to deliver to Dom Vasco da Gama 15 moios [43 imperial quarters]\r\nof wheat, of the value of 28,000 reis, in part-payment of 70,000 reis\r\ndue to him this year, the balance of 41,200 reis to be levied upon the\r\nCasa da Mina.\r\n\r\nThe receipt given by Vasco da Gama for this wheat is still extant, and\r\nis one of the very few autographs of the Admiral in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Facsimile of a Receipt given by Vasco da Gama]\r\n\r\nThat is to say:\r\n\r\n  dõ v^{co} da gama dygo que he verdade que receby os dytos q’nze\r\n  moyos de trygo do dyto g^o de sequeyra feito a xxbiij de\r\n  novẽbro de q’nhẽtos hu.\r\n\r\n  dõ v^{co} da gama.\r\n\r\nOr, in English:—\r\n\r\nDon Vasco da Gama acknowledges to have received said 15 moios of wheat\r\nfrom said g^o de Sequeyra.

Manuel after pointing out, in these letters-patent, that the\r\nexplorations begun by the Infante D. Henry [the Navigator] in\r\n1433,[483] in the hope of discovering a new highway to India, had been\r\ncontinued by King Alfonso and King John, at an expenditure of many\r\nlives and of much treasure, until, in 1482,[484] the Rio do Infante, at\r\na distance of 1,885 leagues, had been reached, continues:\r\n\r\n“Being animated by an ardent desire to continue the work initiated by\r\nthe Infante and our predecessors, and being assured that Vasco da Gama,\r\na gentleman of our household, was well qualified for rendering us this\r\nservice, and would disregard the perils to his person and the risk of\r\nlife which he ran in accomplishing the task set him, we sent him to\r\nIndia as captain-major of our fleet, and with him Paulo da Gama, his\r\nbrother, and Nicolau Coelho, likewise a gentleman of our household. In\r\nthis voyage he did most excellent service, for whilst only 1885 leagues\r\nof coast had been discovered during the many years which had elapsed\r\nsince the commencement of this enterprise, and by the many captains\r\nsent out, he by himself, in this single voyage, discovered 1550\r\nleagues, in addition to a great gold-mine and many wealthy towns and\r\ncities, having a great trade, and finally reached and discovered that\r\nIndia, which all those who have given descriptions of the world rank\r\nhigher in wealth than any other country, which from all time had been\r\ncoveted by the Emperors and Kings of the world, and for the sake of\r\nwhich such heavy expenses had been incurred in this kingdom, and so\r\nmany captains and others forfeited their lives—a country, in fact,\r\nwhich all kings not only desired to possess but even to discover.\r\n\r\n“This discovery, begun years ago, he accomplished at a greater\r\nsacrifice of life and of treasure, and at greater peril to his own\r\nperson, than suffered by those who preceded him. Paulo da Gama,\r\nhis brother, died in the course of the voyage, as also one-half of\r\nthe people whom we sent out with this _armada_, they having passed\r\nthrough many perils, not only because of the length of this voyage,\r\nwhich exceeded two years, but also because of the desire to furnish\r\ntrustworthy information on these territories and all connected with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“And bearing in mind the great services yielded to ourselves and our\r\nkingdoms by this voyage and discovery; the great advantages accruing\r\nthence, not only to our kingdoms but to all Christendom; the injury\r\ndone to the infidels [_i.e._, Mohammedans] who, up till now, have\r\nenjoyed the advantages offered by India; and more especially the hope\r\nthat all the people of India will rally round Our Lord, seeing that\r\nthey may easily be led to a knowledge of His holy faith, some of them\r\nalready being instructed in it; desiring, moreover, to recompense him\r\nfor his services, as befits a prince when dealing with those who have\r\nso greatly and so well served him, and to bestow upon him a grace and\r\nfavour; with full knowledge, and out of our royal and absolute power,\r\nwithout his having solicited it, nor any other person on his behalf,\r\nwe grant him, freely and irrevocably, from this day in perpetuity, an\r\nannuity of 300,000 reis, to be paid to him and his descendants.”\r\n\r\nFor the payment of this annuity the King assigns the new tithe on fish\r\nimposed upon the towns of Sines and Villanova de Milfontes, supposed\r\nto yield 60,000 reis annually, which tithe has been surrendered by\r\nMartinho de Castelbranco, who held it from the Crown, and has been\r\ncompensated elsewhere. Any surplus receipts out of this tithe were to\r\nbe retained by Vasco da Gama, the King, on the other hand, not being\r\nobliged to make up any deficiencies. Secondly, the King surrenders\r\n130,000 reis annually out of the excise levied upon Sines, any\r\ndeficiency in that amount to be made up out of the excise of S. Thiago\r\nde Cacem. Thirdly, the King assigns to him 40,000 reis, to be paid\r\nout of the excise of S. Thiago. Lastly, the 70,000 reis still wanted\r\nto make up the 300,000 reis shall be paid out of the receipts of the\r\ntimber octroi of the city of Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIn addition the King appoints him Admiral of India, conferring all\r\nhonours, franchises and revenues which that rank carries with it,\r\nthroughout the territories which shall be placed under the rule of the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he is granted the privilege of sending annually, by the royal\r\nvessels, 200 cruzados to India, to be laid out in merchandise, upon\r\nthe importation of which no duties whatever shall be levied except\r\nthe 5 per cent. payable to the Order of Christ; this privilege to be\r\ntransmitted to his descendants.\r\n\r\nThe King, moreover, confers upon him, his brother Ayres da Gama, and\r\nhis sister, Tarayja (Theresa) da Gama, the hereditary title of Dom\r\n(Dona).\r\n\r\nFinally, the King desires that the heirs of Vasco da Gama shall always\r\nbear the name of Gama, in memory of the said Vasco da Gama.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.—_Lisbon, February 4, 1504._[485]\r\n\r\nThe King, having pointed out that as Divine justice recompenses, in the\r\nother world, those who have firmly adhered to the Catholic faith and\r\npractised good works, so should the Kings and Princes of this world\r\nrecompense those who have rendered them faithful service, directs\r\nattention to the signal services rendered by Vasco da Gama during his\r\nfirst voyage, when he discovered India. This discovery has resulted in\r\na great accession of wealth. What the Romans, and Emperors and Kings\r\nhave vainly attempted, has been accomplished by the said Admiral,\r\nand the advantages coveted by all nations have been secured to his\r\nkingdoms. These results have been attained at a great loss of life, for\r\nmore than half the men in this first expedition have succumbed, and\r\namong them Paulo da Gama, the brother of the Admiral. On his return\r\nhonours and other rewards were conferred on the Admiral.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a second voyage[486] the services rendered by him\r\nhave been equally brilliant. The King of Kilwa has been reduced to\r\nsubmission, and compelled to pay an annual tribute of 1,500 mitkals\r\nin gold,[487] the first instalment of which has been received. This\r\nking is very powerful, and the owner of the gold mines of Sofala, the\r\nrichest in that part of the world. In all other respects Vasco da Gama\r\nhas faithfully guarded the royal interests, both in making war upon the\r\nMoors of Mecca, and in peaceable negotiations with the kings of those\r\ncountries. The fleet intrusted to him, owing to the wisdom and judgment\r\nexercised, has returned richly laden. On these grounds he is entitled\r\nto some recompense. Acting as becomes a King, and considering his\r\nmerits, he, D. Manuel, therefore grants him, and his male descendants\r\nin the direct line, an annuity of 400,000 reis, to commence on the\r\nfirst of January of this year, 1504, and to be secured on the salt tax\r\nof the city of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.—_Lisbon, February 20, 1504._[488]\r\n\r\nThe King instructs Fernão Lourenço, factor of the Guinea and India\r\ntrade, to pay henceforth the annuity of 1,000 cruzados to Vasco da\r\nGama; each caravel coming from the city of S. Jorge da Mina is to\r\ncontribute 32,500 reis, the payments out of twelve caravels thus making\r\nup a total of 390,000 reis.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.—_Thomar, March 21, 1507._[489]\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated Thomar, March 21, 1507, and signed by Antonio\r\nCarneiro, the King’s chief secretary,[490] Vasco da Gama, the Admiral\r\nof India, is informed that within thirty days after date he must\r\nwithdraw from the town of Sines, with his wife and the whole of his\r\nhousehold, and that neither himself, nor his wife, nor his household\r\ncan be permitted to return to that town, or its precincts, except by\r\npermission of the Master [of the Order of São Thiago and Aviz], In case\r\nany of them should enter the town without such permission, they will\r\nrender themselves liable to a fine of fifty cruzados, beyond which\r\nthey will incur the punishment deserved by those who refuse obedience\r\nto the orders of their King and Lord. In a postcript the King orders,\r\nmoreover, that the same penalty shall be incurred if Vasco da Gama\r\ncontinue the buildings he has commenced.\r\n\r\n(This Royal Edict was presented on June 26, 1507, at the office of the\r\nMaster of the Order at S. Thiago de Cacem, by one João da Gama,[491]\r\nand ordered to be placed in the Archives of the Order).\r\n\r\n\r\n8.—_Tavira, November 18, 1508._[492]\r\n\r\nThe King authorises Luiz d’Arca to surrender his Alcaideriamór of\r\nVillafranca de Xira[493] to the Admiral of India (Vasco da Gama).\r\n\r\n\r\n9.—_Lisbon, November 19, 1511._[494]\r\n\r\nThe King orders the authorities (“judges”) of the Order of S. Thiago\r\nto afford the receiver appointed by the Admiral every facility for\r\ncollecting the revenues assigned him in the towns of S. Thiago de\r\nCacem, Sines and Villanova de Milfontes.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.—_Lisbon, June 1, 1513._[494]\r\n\r\nThe King informs all whom it may concern that in consideration of the\r\nmerits and very great services of Dom Vasco da Gama, it pleases him\r\nto order that no freights be charged upon merchandise forwarded to\r\nthe Admiral from India, whether sent by royal or private ships, the\r\nexpenses, in the latter case, being charged to the India House. This\r\nprivilege is not to extend to certain spices reserved for the Crown.\r\n\r\n11.—_Lisbon, August 22, 1515._[495]\r\n\r\nThe King authorises the Admiral to send with each fleet sailing to\r\nIndia a person to attend to his business, this person to draw pay as a\r\nman-at-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n12.—_Lisbon, August 29, 1515._[496]\r\n\r\n1). Manuel, having quoted _in extenso_ the conditions of a pension of\r\n400,000 reis granted on February 4, 1504, orders that one-half this\r\npension shall be paid in future out of the revenues of the town of\r\nNiza,[497] and the other out of the salt-tax, as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.—_Lisbon, August 17, 1518._[498]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral having reminded the King that the title of “Count” has been\r\npromised him, but has not yet been conferred, asks permission to leave\r\nthe kingdom. The King, in a letter in which he addresses Vasco da Gama\r\nas “Almirante amiguo”, replies: “We order you to remain in our kingdom\r\nup to the end of December of the present year, and we hope by that time\r\nyou will have seen the error you are about to commit, and desire to\r\nserve us as is seeming, and not take the extreme course proposed. But\r\nif by that time you are still minded to go, we shall not hinder your\r\ndeparture, with your wife, your sons, and all your moveable property.\r\nDone at Lisbon by the Secretary [Antonio Carneiro], August 17, 1518....\r\nThe King.”\r\n\r\n\r\n14.—_Evora, October 24, 1519._[499]\r\n\r\nThe King authorises Vasco da Gama to surrender his pension of 400,000\r\nreis [see No. 5], to D. Jayme, Duke of Bragança, and the latter to give\r\nin exchange the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de Frades.\r\n\r\n\r\n15.—Villa Viçosa, November 4, 1519.[500]\r\n\r\nD. Jayme, Duke of Bragança and Guimaraes, authorises his “ouvidor”\r\n(bailiff), João Alves, to surrender the towns of Vidigueira and Villa\r\nde Frades, with all their revenues, etc., to D. Vasco da Gama, on\r\ncondition of the latter ceding to him an hereditary pension of 400,000\r\nreis, which he has from the King, and of paying, in addition, a sum of\r\n4,000 cruzados in gold.\r\n\r\n[This transaction was completed at Evora, where Vasco da Gama resided,\r\non November 7, the 4,000 cruzados being paid in Portugueses of 10\r\ncruzados each. As the eldest sons of the contracting parties, D.\r\nTheodesio of Bragança and D. Francisco da Gama, were still minors, it\r\nwas agreed that the King should be asked to “overlook this deficiency\r\nof age”, so that they, too, should be bound by this agreement.[501]]\r\n\r\n\r\n16.—_Evora, December 17, 1519._[502]\r\n\r\nThe King, having sanctioned the arrangement between the Duke of\r\nBragança and Vasco da Gama, and having dwelt once more upon the good\r\nservices rendered by the latter not only to the Crown, but also to the\r\ninhabitants of the kingdom, and to all Christendom, grants to him and\r\nhis heirs, irrevocably and for all time, the towns of Vidigueira and\r\nVilla de Frades, together with all privileges, including civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction and church patronage, which had been enjoyed by\r\nthe Dukes of Bragança, [These privileges, it should be understood,\r\nexceeded those usually enjoyed by a mere Count.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17.—_Evora, December 29, 1519._[503]\r\n\r\nD. Manoel, after a glowing eulogy of the services rendered by his\r\nAdmiral of India, confers upon him the title of Count of Vidigueira,\r\ntogether with all prerogatives, rights, graces, privileges, liberties\r\nand franchises enjoyed by the Counts of the Kingdom by usage and\r\nancient custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n18.—_Lisbon, March 30, 1522._[504]\r\n\r\nD. João III confirms Vasco da Gama’s claim, as Admiral, to the\r\nanchorage dues paid at Malacca, Goa and Ormuz, and authorises him to\r\nappoint receivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.—_Evora, February 5, 1524._[505]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral, being about to proceed to India for a third time, the\r\nKing, D. João III, is pleased to order that in case of his death his\r\nson and heir shall forthwith assume the title of Count of Vidigueira,\r\nand enter upon the enjoyment of all privileges, etc., to which this\r\nrank entitles him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Church and Monastery of Our Lady of the Relics at\r\nVidigueira.\r\n\r\n(_From a woodcut in Teixeira de Aragão’s Paper._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] He was thus eighteen years of age when Queen Isabella, in 1478,\r\ngranted a safe-conduct to him and Fernão de Lemos, enabling them to\r\npass through Castile on their way to Tangier (Navarrete, iii, p. 477).\r\nAccording to P. Antonio Carvalho da Costa’s unsupported statement,\r\nVasco da Gama was born in 1469.\r\n\r\n[2] According to Castanheda, the appointment was at first offered\r\nto Paulo da Gama, Vasco’s elder brother. He declined on account of\r\nill-health, but offered to accompany his brother as captain of one of\r\nthe vessels.\r\n\r\n[3] Vasco da Gama, after his return from India, married Catarina de\r\nAtaide. He proceeded a second time to India in 1502. When returning\r\nfrom Cananor he shaped a direct course across the Indian Ocean to\r\nMozambique. After a long period of rest, King João III again sent him\r\nto India in 1524, but he died at Cochin on December 25th of the same\r\nyear, at the age of sixty-five. His remains were taken to Portugal in\r\n1538, and deposited at Vidigueira. Since 1880 they are supposed to have\r\nfound their last resting-place in the church of Belem.\r\n\r\nFor an interesting estimate of the character of the great navigator,\r\nsee Lord Stanley of Alderley’s _The Three Voyages of Vasco da Gama_\r\n(Hakluyt Society), 1869. See also the Appendices of this volume for\r\nfurther information on the first voyage.\r\n\r\n[4] Ruy Gonçalves da Camara in 1473, Fernão Telles in 1474.\r\n\r\n[5] Toscanelli’s letter to Columbus was written long after that\r\naddressed to Fernão Martinz, for the expression _ha dias_ (perhaps a\r\nrendering of _pridem_ or _haud diu_) does not mean “a few days ago”,\r\nbut “long ago.” Columbus himself uses it in that sense when he writes\r\nfrom Jamaica that the “Emperor of Catayo asked long ago (_ha dias_)\r\nfor men of learning to instruct him in the faith of Christ.” The\r\nrequest for missionaries had been made to the Pope in 1339 (Navarrete,\r\n_Colleccion_, 2nd ed., I, p. 457).\r\n\r\n[6] Barros, _Dec. I_, l. 3, c. ii.\r\n\r\n[7] It is quite possible that the draughtsman of the Cantino Chart\r\nplaced St. Helena Bay incorrectly, and not as determined by Vasco da\r\nGama. Canerio places this bay in lat. 32° 30´ S., which is only 10´ out\r\nof its true position.\r\n\r\n[8] See Wieser, _Die Karte des Bartolomeo Columbo_, Innsbruck, 1893.\r\nCuba is not shown on this chart, possibly because Bartolomeo would not\r\ndo violence to his conscience by representing it as a part of Asia\r\n(as his brother believed it to be to the day of his death) after its\r\ninsularity had been recognised.\r\n\r\n[9] _The Journal of Christopher Columbus_, by C. R. Markham (Hakluyt\r\nSociety), 1893.\r\n\r\n[10] Thus Correa states correctly that the Cape was rounded in\r\nNovember, that is, in the height of summer, but introduces accessory\r\ndetails—perhaps taken from an account of some other voyage (Cabral’s,\r\nfor instance)—which could only have happened in mid-winter. (See p.\r\n193).\r\n\r\n[11] An excellent translation of Correa’s account of _The Three Voyages\r\nof Vasco da Gama_, by Lord Stanley of Alderley, was published by the\r\nHakluyt Society in 1869. It is accompanied by foot-notes, directing\r\nattention to those numerous instances in which Correa differs from\r\nother writers.\r\n\r\n[12] Most of the documents discovered on these occasions were made\r\nknown by Texeira de Aragão and Luciano Cordeiro, to whose published\r\nworks frequent reference will be made.\r\n\r\n[13] _Roteiro_, prim, edição, p. xix.\r\n\r\n[14] _Roteiro_, seg. edição, p. xii.\r\n\r\n[15] Prof. Kopke (_Roteiro_, prim. ed., pp. ix-xiv) deals much more\r\nfully with this subject. We have been content to give the substance of\r\nhis remarks.\r\n\r\n[16] See livro I, c. xxvii, of the first edition (1551) of his\r\n_Historia_. In the edition of 1554 this passage is suppressed, but\r\nfurther particulars of the voyage are not given.\r\n\r\n[17] For a conclusive proof of this see p. 2. After the _S. Raphael_\r\nhad been broken up, the author may have been transferred to Coelho’s\r\nvessel, and have returned in her.\r\n\r\n[18] This is the “secretary” (escrivão) of Vasco da Gama. Castanheda\r\n(I, p. 54) mentions also the comptroller (veador) of the captain-major,\r\nbut we are inclined to think that this is a duplication of the same\r\nperson, namely, Diogo Dias, the clerk or purser of the _S. Gabriel_.\r\n\r\n[19] See p. 54, note 2, for this anecdote.\r\n\r\n[20] _Roteiro da Viagem que em descobrimento da India pelo Cabo da Boa\r\nEsperança fez Dom Vasco da Gama em 1497._ Porto, 1838. 8vo, pp. xxviii,\r\n184.\r\n\r\n[21] _Roteiro da Viagem de Vasco da Gama em_ MCCCCXCVII.

Gabriel_ (flag-ship), the _S. Raphael_ (Paulo da Gama), the\r\n_Berrio_ (Nicolau Coelho), and a store-ship (Gonçalo Nunes). The author\r\nserved on board the _S. Raphael_. See Introduction.\r\n\r\n[28] In the suburb of Restello, four miles below the Arsenal of\r\nLisbon, stood a chapel or _ermida_, which had been built by Henry the\r\nNavigator for the use of mariners. In this chapel Vasco da Gama and his\r\ncompanions spent the night previous to their departure in prayer. After\r\nhis victorious return, D. Manuel founded on its site the magnificent\r\nmonastery of Our Lady of Bethlehem or Belem.\r\n\r\n[29] The forbidding line of low cliffs, extending for 35 miles from\r\nLeven Head to Elbow Point, in lat. 24° N., was known to the Portuguese\r\nof the time as _terra alta_ (see D. Pacheco Pereira, _Esmeraldo de Situ\r\nOrbis_, p. 40). The Rio do Ouro or River of Gold is a basin, extending\r\nabout 20 miles inland and four miles wide at its mouth. No river flows\r\ninto it. The real “River of Gold” is the Senegal or the Upper Niger.\r\n\r\n[30] Castanheda attributes the separation of the vessels to the fog and\r\na storm.\r\n\r\n[31] At the southern extremity of Ilha do Sal, in lat. 16° 31´ N., is\r\nthe Porto de Santa Maria.\r\n\r\n[32] S. Jorge da Mina, the famous fort built on the Gold Coast\r\nin 1482, by Diogo d’Azambuja, one of whose captains had been the\r\nvery Bartholomew Dias who five years afterwards doubled the Cape,\r\nand who now returned to the _Mine_, having been made its captain,\r\nin recognition of his great services. (See L. Cordeira, _Diogo\r\nd’Azambuja_, Lisbon, 1890, and Barros, edition of 1778, to. I, part 1,\r\np. 271.)\r\n\r\n[33] Bombardas, originally catapults, subsequently any piece of\r\nordnance from which stone balls were thrown. In the north of Europe the\r\nterm was restricted to mortars. Gama, however, carried breech-loading\r\nguns, with movable _cameras_ or chambers. (See Stanley’s _Vasco da\r\nGama_, p. 226, _note_ and _Introduction_.)\r\n\r\n[34] São Thiago, the largest of the Cape Verde Islands. The Porto da\r\nPraia, within which lies the Island of Santa Maria (14° 50´ N.), is no\r\ndoubt the bay referred to in the text.\r\n\r\n[35] This date, August 18th, is obviously wrong. Deducting the delay of\r\ntwo days, Vasco da Gama spent 95 days on his passage from São Thiago\r\nto the Bay of St. Helena, the distance being about 1,170 leagues\r\n(4,290 miles), his daily progress amounted to 12 leagues or 45 miles.\r\nIf the dates in the text were correct, he would have made 12½\r\nleagues daily up to August 18th, and between that date and the 22nd\r\n(allowing for the delay) at least 300 leagues (1,010 miles), which is\r\nquite impossible. It is evident that the second date is wrong, and\r\ninstead of “the same month”, we ought perhaps to read “October”. In\r\nthat case the daily progress, up to October 22nd, would have averaged\r\n10 leagues (34 miles). Thence, to St. Helena Bay, a distance of\r\n370 leagues accomplished in 16 days, the daily progress would have\r\naveraged nearly 23 leagues (78 miles). Of course these are merely rough\r\napproximations, as the course taken by Vasco da Gama and the incidents\r\nof this memorable passage are not known to us. We may mention that\r\nmodern sailing vessels going from S. Thiago by way of Sierra Leone and\r\nAscension to the Cape, a distance of 5,410 miles, occupy on an average\r\n49½ days on the passage, making thus 110 miles daily (58 in crossing\r\nfrom Sierra Leone to Ascension). A ship going direct (3,770 miles) has\r\nperformed the passage in 41 days, thus averaging 92 daily. (See Admiral\r\nFitzroy’s “Passage Tables” in the _Meteorological Papers_ published by\r\nthe Admiralty in 1858.)\r\n\r\n[36] The MS. has _Garçõees_, a word not to be found in the dictionary,\r\nbut evidently an augmentative of _garça_, a heron. Pimental, in his\r\n_Arte de Navegar_, mentions large birds with dark wings and white\r\nbodies as being met with a hundred leagues to the west of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, which are known as _Gaivotões_.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\nThe Gaivota, or gull, however, in no respect resembles a heron.\r\n\r\n[37] That is, towards Tristão da Cunha, Gama being at that time 400 miles\r\nto the N.N.W. of these islands.\r\n\r\n[38] Kopke supposes that we should read _phoca_ instead of _quoqua_,\r\nbut this is not very likely, as _lobo marinho_ is employed throughout\r\nthe _Rutter_ to describe the _phocæ_ or seals. Among the animals\r\nwhich these early navigators must have met with, but which are not\r\nmentioned, are porpoises (_peixe de porco_) and dolphins (_doiradas_ or\r\ngilt-heads).\r\n\r\n[39] _Lobo marinho_, sea-wolf, a term vaguely applied to all species of\r\nseals, as also to the sea-elephant, has been translated throughout as\r\n_seal_.\r\n\r\n[40] _Golfão, i.e._, Zostera nana, which is met with along the coast of\r\nSouth-Western Africa.\r\n\r\n[41] A Portuguese fathom, or _braça_, is equal to 5.76 feet.\r\n\r\n[42] This was considerably to the north of St. Helena Bay, which was\r\nonly reached three days later.\r\n\r\n[43] A reference, no doubt, to Pero d’Alenquer, Vasco da Gama’s pilot,\r\nwho had been with B. Dias during his memorable voyage round the Cape,\r\nas had probably others of this armada.\r\n\r\n[44] Now called Berg River.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[45] Castanheda and Goes state that Nicolau Coelho was sent to take\r\nthe soundings. It is, however, much more probable that this duty\r\nwas intrusted to Pero d’Alenquer, who had already doubled the Cape\r\nwith Bartholomew Dias, and had touched at several points in its\r\nvicinity.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\nI cannot see how his having been with Dias can have conferred any\r\nvery special qualification for taking soundings in a bay which Pero\r\nd’Alenquer had never seen before. On subsequent occasions Coelho seems\r\nto have been employed repeatedly upon this duty.\r\n\r\n[46] _Baço_, a vague term, meaning also brown or blackish.\r\n\r\n[47] Castanheda, in his first edition (1551), adopted this statement,\r\nbut subsequently suppressed it. D. Jeronymo Osorio, Bishop of Silves,\r\nin _De rebus Emanuelsis_, has “pudenta ligneis vaginis includunt.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\nThe use of such a sheath is universal among the Bantu tribes of\r\nSouthern Africa, but seems now to be more honoured in the breach than\r\nthe observance among the Hottentots, here spoken of. John of Empoli,\r\nwho went to India with Afonso de Albuquerque (_Ramusio_, i), observed\r\nsuch a sheath made of leather with the hair on, among the Hottentots of\r\nthe Bay of S. Blas. Leguat (Hakluyt Society’s edition, 1891, p. 288)\r\nfound it still in use in 1698.\r\n\r\n[48] The shafts of their assegais are made of assegai- or lance-wood\r\n(_Curtisea faginda_) and not of olive-wood, and even in John of\r\nEmpoli’s time had iron blades. Their spears for spearing fish, on the\r\nother hand, are tipped with the straight horn of the gemsbuck.\r\n\r\n[49] We learn from Barros that Vasco da Gama landed for the purpose of\r\nobserving the latitude. The captive was handed over to two ship’s boys,\r\none of whom was a negro, with orders to treat him well.\r\n\r\n[50] _Çeitil_, a copper coin, worth about one-third of a farthing.\r\n\r\n[51] We gather from Barros and Goes that Fernão Velloso was granted\r\nthe desired permission at the intercession of Paulo da Gama. When\r\nVasco da Gama returned to his vessel, Coelho and some of the crew were\r\nleft behind, collecting wood and lobsters. Paulo amused himself by\r\nharpooning a whale, which nearly cost him dearly, for the whale dived,\r\nand would have capsized the boat had not the water been shallow. In the\r\nafternoon, when Coelho and his people were returning to the vessels,\r\nVelloso was observed to run down a hill. Vasco da Gama, ever observant,\r\nsaw this from his ship, and at once ordered Coelho back, entering\r\nhimself a boat to join him. Some delay or misunderstanding occurred,\r\nthe “negroes” threw stones and discharged arrows, and several men were\r\nwounded, including the captain-major and Gonçalo Alvarez. For further\r\nparticulars see Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[52] The distance is 33 leagues.\r\n\r\n[53] Castanheda says that the Cape was doubled on “Wednesday, November\r\n20”, but Wednesday was the 22nd. Barros says “Tuesday, 20th”, but\r\nTuesday was the 21st. Compare Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[54] The actual dimensions of False Bay are about 5 by 5 leagues.\r\nThe bay is called “Golfo dent^o. delle Serre” on the map of Henricus\r\nMartellus Germanus, 1489, which illustrates the voyage of B. Dias (Add.\r\nMS. 15760, Brit. Mus.).\r\n\r\n[55] This is without the shadow of a doubt Mossel Bay (see plan on map\r\nII). It is also most probably the Bahia de los Vaqueiros of B. Dias,\r\nwho certainly was here [see below]. Barros refers to it as being _now_\r\ncalled S. Braz. Its original name had thus been abandoned in favour of\r\nthat bestowed by Vasco da Gama.\r\n\r\n[56] The thirteen days are counted from November 25 to December 7,\r\nboth these days being counted. According to Castanheda (I, p. 12), the\r\nstore-ship was burnt.\r\n\r\n[57] See note 4, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[58] The distance by sea is over 90 leagues, that by land 64. “By sea”\r\nis probably a slip of the pen.\r\n\r\n[59] The “gora” is the great musical instrument of the Hottentots. It\r\nis not a flute or reed-pipe.\r\n\r\n[60] This island is still known as “Seal” Island, although its former\r\nvisitors no longer make their appearance. The islet lies about half a\r\nmile from the land, is only 250 ft. in length and 15 ft. high.\r\n\r\n[61] Usually called _Sotilicaires_ by Portuguese writers. They are\r\nclearly Cape Penguins.—KOPKE (abridged).\r\n\r\n[62] The word used by the author is “padrão”, that is, a stone pillar\r\nbearing the arms of Portugal and an inscription, such as King John\r\nfirst ordered to be set up by his explorers. None of the “pillars” set\r\nup by Vasco da Gama has been recovered, for the “pillar” near Malindi\r\nis clearly of later date (see p. 90).\r\n\r\n[63] This paragraph is of the greatest importance with reference to\r\nthe voyage of B. Dias, for Pero d’Alenquer, one of his companions, is\r\nthe real authority for these statements. The usual statement that this\r\npillar was erected on the Ilha da Cruz must henceforth be rejected,\r\nas had already been done in 1575, when M. de Mesquita Perestrello\r\nmade a survey of this coast (see his Report in Pimental’s _Roteiro da\r\nNavegação da India Oriental_).\r\n\r\nThe distances given by the author are remarkably correct. From the\r\nCape of Good Hope to Mossel Bay (São Braz) is 60 leagues, as stated by\r\nhim. Thence to Santa Cruz is 56 leagues; from Santa Cruz to the Rio de\r\nInfante is 21 leagues.\r\n\r\n_Santa Cruz_ is the largest of a group of islands in the western part\r\nof Algoa Bay. It is 4 cables in length, rises to a height of 195 ft.,\r\nand is nearly all bare rock. _There are no springs._ The _Ilhéos chãos_\r\nare readily identified with a cluster of low rocky islets about 7\r\nleagues to the east. The Cape Padrone of the charts marks the site of\r\nthe last pillar erected by Dias, and 5 leagues beyond it rises “Ship\r\nRock,” in the locality where Perestrello claims to have discovered\r\nthe _Penedo das Fontes_ of Barros and other writers. Perestrello\r\nhad, no doubt, in his possession original documents (now lost) which\r\nenabled him to identify the localities named by the early explorers.\r\nHis substantial agreement with the author of this _Roteiro_ is most\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[64] That is the Rio do Infante, now known as the Great Fish river.\r\n\r\n[65] The Agulhas current hereabouts runs at the rate of 1 to 4 knots an\r\nhour to the westward.\r\n\r\n[66] On Canerio’s map there is a Ponta da Pescaria, to the north of\r\nPort Natal.\r\n\r\n[67] Equivalent to three-fourths of a pint.\r\n\r\n[68] The MS. says January 10th, but Thursday was the 11th.\r\n\r\n[69] Hence called “Terra dos Fumos”, or, more correctly, “Mfumos” the\r\n“land of petty chiefs”. Dr. Hamy’s chart of 1502 has the name; Canerio\r\nhas a “terra thrimias”, an exceptionally unrecognisable corruption\r\nof it; whilst on Ribero’s map (1529) we find the name, although in a\r\nslightly corrupted form (humos). The appellation has nothing to do with\r\neither “smoke” (fumo), or “moisture” (humor).\r\n\r\n[70] Barros (_Dec. I_, l. 4, c. 4) tells us that Vasco da Gama entered\r\nthe Rio dos Reis, by others called Rio do Cobre, on Twelfth Night\r\n(January 6). Goes, on the other hand, confirms the author of the\r\n_Roteiro_, and there cannot be a doubt that Barros is mistaken. The\r\nRio dos Reis is, indeed, one of the rivers which enters the bay\r\nsubsequently called after Lourenço Marques, but discovered, either in\r\n1501 by Sancho de Toar, one of the captains of Cabral’s fleet, or in\r\nthe following year by Antonio de Campo.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamy’s Chart has “R. do reys”, Canerio’s “G. de lom raios”\r\n(evidently a corrupt rendering of “Golfo dos or delos Reis”, which\r\nthus seems to have been the earliest name bestowed upon what is now\r\nknown as Delagoa Bay). The “agoada de bon passa” of Dr. Hamy’s Chart,\r\nand the “Rio d’aguada” of Canerio, between this bay and Cabo das\r\nCorrentes, is clearly the locality referred to by the author. Ribero\r\n(1529) has a “Rio de la laguna,” a “_rio de los reyes_”, and further\r\neast, an “aguada de buena paz”. M. de Mesquita Perestrello (1575)\r\nplaces the “Aguada da boa Paz” 15 leagues to the east of “Rio do Ouro”\r\n(the Limpopo), and 43 leagues to the west of Cabo das Correntes. This\r\nposition corresponds to that of the Zavora River of Admiralty Chart\r\nNo. 648, in 34° 25´ E. It was here that Vasco da Gama cast anchor. The\r\nreference to the “swell of the sea” quite precludes the notion that he\r\nentered the well-sheltered Delagoa Bay.\r\n\r\nM. Kopke (in a note, _Roteiro_, p. 147) would place the “Aguada da Boa\r\nGente” between the Lagoa River and the Limpopo (Inhambane), in 32° 23´\r\nE., and says that this locality is still generally known as “Aguada da\r\nBoa Paz”, but I can find no confirmation of this. Moreover, if this be\r\nthe “Aguada”, where, on this barren coast, are we to look for the “Rio\r\ndo Cobre”? (Compare Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 66). See Map III.\r\n\r\n[71] João dos Santos (_Ethiopia Oriental_, I. 2, c. 20) already\r\nidentified this river with the Kiliman River. Dr. Hamy’s Chart calls\r\nit “Rio de bon Signals”, an evident corruption. Barros and Goes both\r\ncall it “Rio dos Bons Signals”, whilst Correa refers to it as Rio da\r\nMisericordia, the river of Mercy (see Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p.\r\n11). Comp. Map III.\r\n\r\n[72] A very involved sentence! Gama arrived off the bar of the Kiliman\r\non January 24, cast anchor, and sent the smallest of his vessels, the\r\n_Berrio_, within, to take soundings. On the day after, the 25th, he\r\ncrossed the bar with the two other vessels.\r\n\r\n[73] _Almadia_, a “dug-out”, properly El Maziyah, ferry-boat (Burton’s\r\n_Camoens_, iv, p. 577.)\r\n\r\n[74] Burton (_Commentary_, p. 408), points out that the “touca” is not\r\na turban, but a kind of cap. Its shape, however, was not that of the\r\n“toque” of our milliners.\r\n\r\n[75] From January 24 to February 24, both days included, is thirty-two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[76] Barros says they were beached for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[77] This disease was evidently scurvy, so fatal to our early\r\nnavigators. Castanheda (I. c. 4) tells us that in this time of trouble\r\nPaulo da Gama visited the sick night and day, condoled with them, and\r\nfreely distributed the medicines which he had brought for his own use.\r\n\r\n[78] The Padrão de São Raphael is distinctly marked and named on Dr.\r\nHamy’s and Canerio’s Charts. No trace of it has ever been discovered.\r\n\r\n[79] These are the “Insule primeras” (_i.e._, Ilhas primeiras) of Dr.\r\nHamy’s and Canerio’s Charts. They are five in number, and form a chain\r\nless than 5 leagues in length. The three southern islands (Silva,\r\ndo Fogo, and Crown) form a separate group, and are bare, whilst the\r\ntwo northern islands (Casuarina and Epidendron) have trees. Gama,\r\napparently, missed the two southernmost islands.\r\n\r\n[80] These six days are reckoned from February 24 to March 1.\r\n\r\nCorrea (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 76-84) says that on the voyage\r\nfrom the river of Mercy to Moçambique, Davane, a Moor, was taken out of\r\na zambuk. Barros and Goes know nothing of this incident. Later on (p.\r\n128) we are told that this Davane agreed to accompany the Portuguese\r\nas broker, and that he was finally discharged at Cananor with good\r\ntestimonials (p. 235). He was nicknamed “tayyib”, which in Arabic means\r\n“good” (p. 132). See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[81] See plan on Map III. See also Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[82] Arabic, el Nafir, a sort of straight Moorish trumpet or tuba.\r\n\r\n[83] They took their visitors for “Turks”, or at all events for\r\nMohammedans. All this changed after their true character had been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n[84] It appears from this that Vasco da Gama entered the port\r\nimmediately on his arrival, and took up a position close to the town.\r\n\r\n[85] “Ruivo”, red, in the original. Castanheda, who made use of this\r\nJournal, substitutes baço, tawny, which is equally inapplicable.\r\n\r\n[86] That is, Arabic. The “Moors” of the author are, in fact, either\r\npure Arabs (white Moors) or Swahilis speaking Arabic.\r\n\r\n[87] “Aljofar”, cf. Arabic jauhar, johar, a jewel or precious stone\r\n(Burton). Aljofar, in Portuguese, means seed-pearls.\r\n\r\n[88] Barros says that Fernão Martins was their interpreter.\r\n\r\n[89] The notions about the Christianity of India prevailing at that\r\ntime in Portugal (and among the earlier navigators) will be referred\r\nto elsewhere. We may add that Vasco da Gama was instructed to find out\r\na mighty sovereign, known as Prester John, said to be a Christian, but\r\nthe situation of whose states was very uncertain.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[90] On Prester John, see Zarncke (_Abhd. K. Sächs. G. der Wiss._,\r\n1876 and 1879), and G. Uzielli (_Boll. della Soc. Africana d’Italia_,\r\n1892, viii). Vasco da Gama had no doubt received special instructions\r\nto inquire for that Christian potentate. At one time he was looked for\r\ninland from Benin, but the information received from Pero de Covilhão,\r\nwhom King John had despatched overland to India, in 1487, no less than\r\nthat furnished by Lucas Marcos, an Abyssinian priest, who came to\r\nLisbon soon after Covilhão’s departure, confirmed the Portuguese in the\r\nbelief that the “Prester John” they were in quest of was the Emperor\r\nof Ethiopia, whose capital at that time was in Shoa. (See Covilhão’s\r\nnarrative, as given by _Alvarez_, Hakluyt Soc., 1881.)\r\n\r\n[91] Barros calls them Abyssinians from the country of Prester John,\r\nand says that when they saw the image of the saint which formed the\r\nfigure-head of the St. Gabriel, they knelt down and worshipped. The\r\nAbyssinian Christians, whatever their shortcomings, do not worship\r\nimages, as is the practice of the Roman Church. These captives,\r\ntherefore, must have been Indians, as stated by our author.\r\n\r\n[92] Barros calls this sheikh Zacoeja (Shah Khwajah?).\r\n\r\n[93] Marlota, a short dress of silk or wool worn in Persia and India.\r\n(Moura, _Vestig. da lingua Arab._, sub “marlota.”)\r\n\r\n[94] A Mozambique matikal (miskal) weighs 4.41346 grammes (Antonio\r\nNunes, _O livro dos Pesos_, 1554, p. 50, published at Lisbon, 1868),\r\nand its value in standard gold would consequently be about 12_s._;\r\nelsewhere (p. 64) he makes this coin the equivalent of 467 reis, or\r\nabout 11_s._ 4_d._ (_see_ Index, under _Cruzado_).\r\n\r\n[95] The island of S. Jorge.\r\n\r\n[96] Tavolochinha, in the original, is an obsolete word, which from\r\nits etymology seems to refer to a defensive armour presenting a broad\r\nsurface (tavola). Castanheda, in relating this incident, substitutes\r\n_escudo_—shield—whilst Goes and Osorio speak of _adargas_ or _parmae_,\r\nthat is, bucklers.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[97] Tamiça, lit. “spatry-cord”, popularly known as coir-rope. These\r\n“sewn boats” were already in use when the _Periplus of the Erythrean\r\nSea_ was written, and the town of Rhapta (from [Greek: rhaptein], _to\r\nsew_) derived its name from them. (See McCrindle, _The Commerce and\r\nNavigation of the Erythrean Sea_, p. 71).\r\n\r\n[98]\r\n\r\n  “Mats were the wings wherewith they lightly flew,\r\n  From certain palm-fronds wove by cunning hand.”\r\n\r\n  _Camoens_, Canto I, st. 46.—Burton’s Translation.\r\n\r\n[99] The “Genoese needle” is, of course, the mariner’s\r\ncompass.—According to the “Mohit” of Admiral Sidi Ali ben Hosein\r\n(1554), published by Dr. Bittner and Dr. Tomascheck (Vienna, 1897), the\r\npilots of the Indian Ocean determined relative latitudes by observing\r\nthe altitudes of certain stars. The result was expressed, not in\r\ndegrees as was done by the scientific astronomers of the day, but in\r\n_isbas_ or “fingers”, each equivalent to 1° 42´ 50”. The instrument\r\nwhich they used consisted of three staffs. Two of these were moveable\r\non a hinge, and were directed respectively upon the horizon, and the\r\nstar the altitude of which it was desired to determine. A third staff\r\n(or an octant) was fixed at the end of the horizon-staff, and upon it\r\nthe angle observed could be read off. Vasco da Gama brought one of\r\nthese instruments with him to Portugal, but the astronomer of Cabral’s\r\nexpedition, who had been instructed to test its qualities, reported\r\nunfavourably (_Alguns documentos_, 1892, p. 122). Yet the results\r\nobtained by means of this instrument by the pilots of the Indian Ocean\r\nwere very satisfactory, and the charts prepared by these very practical\r\nmen were far more correct than the abortions produced by “scientific”\r\nArab geographers. Parallels (at intervals of one-eighth of an _isba_)\r\nand meridians were marked upon these charts, and they were superior\r\nin this respect to the Portulani of the Mediterranean pilots. The\r\nmeridians were probably drawn at intervals of _zams_, which were equal\r\nto one-eighth _isba_, or three hours’ sail, or nearly thirteen of our\r\nsea-miles. It is quite possible, as suggested by Dr. Bittner, that\r\nthese pilots also invented the cross-staff, for _balhestilho_, the\r\nname by which this instrument became known in Portugal, is more likely\r\nto be derived from the Arabic _al-balista_ (altitude), than from the\r\nLatin _ballista_. Compare also Barros (_Dec. I_, liv. 4, c. 6), where\r\nan allusion is made to the instrument employed by the pilot who joined\r\nVasco da Gama at Malindi. Barros says that the instrument consisted of\r\nthree _taboas_ or plates.\r\n\r\n[100] This fruit is the coco-nut.\r\n\r\n[101] The sharifs (“nobles”) are the descendants of the Prophet, and\r\nalthough not “priests”, they enjoy a certain religious rank. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this title can be claimed only by the head of the family\r\nwhich descends from the Prophet in a direct line. All others can only\r\nclaim the title of _Saiyid_, Lord. The “white” Moors are, of course,\r\ntrue Arabs.\r\n\r\n[102] There are Government tanks now on the island, which are filled by\r\nthe prisoners of Fort St. Sebastian.\r\n\r\n[103] _Agonia_, Arabic _El Jumbiyah_, a crooked poniard, worn in the\r\nwaist-belt.\r\n\r\n[104] Barros calls these captives “Moors”, and the author himself does\r\nthe same at a later stage of his Journal (see note, p. 37).\r\n\r\n[105] That is S. Jorge, and the small islet of S. Thiago, 1¾ miles\r\nto the south.\r\n\r\n[106] The text has 30th, but Saturday was the 31st.\r\n\r\n[107] These were the Kerimba islands, the southernmost of which is\r\nKiziwa, 12° 35´ S. The mainland being generally low, will rarely be\r\nseen when coasting outside the reefs (_Africa Pilot_, Part III, p. 254).\r\n\r\n[108] These were the islands off Cabo Delgado, called Ilhas das Cabecas\r\n(Cabras?) on Dr. Hamy’s and Canerio’s maps. None of these, however, is\r\nmore than nine miles from the mainland.\r\n\r\n[109] This island was Quiloa (Kilwa), whose king, at that time, was\r\nthe most powerful along the coast, Sofala, the Zambezi, Angoshe and\r\nMozambique being subject to him (_Duarto Barbosa_, p. 10).—KOPKE.\r\n\r\nWhen Vasco da Gama attempted to put back he had probably reached Ras\r\nTikwiri, 8° 50´ S.\r\n\r\n[110] Mafia.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[111] On the homeward voyage, in January 1499, the _S. Raphael_ was\r\nburnt at these shoals, which are described as lying off the town of\r\nTamugata (Mtangata), and this enables us to fix upon the locality with\r\nmuch certainty. There still is a roadstead or bay called Mtangata,\r\nwhich “the long roll of the Indian Ocean renders a place of trembling\r\nto the coast trader” (Burton, _Journal Royal Geographical Society_,\r\n1858, p. 200). A “town” of this name exists no longer, but Burton\r\ndescribes the ruins of what was once an extensive city near the village\r\nof Tongoni.\r\n\r\nThere are no “mountains” close to the coast corresponding to the\r\n“Serras de S. Raphael”, but the mountains of Usambara, rising 20 to 25\r\nmiles inland to an altitude of 3,500 ft., are visible in clear weather\r\nfor a distance of 62 miles.\r\n\r\nSir John Kirk writes to me: “The baixas de S. Raphael are undoubtedly\r\nthe coral reefs of Mtangata; and the Usambara mountains, with their\r\nvalleys, steep precipices, and lofty summits would, especially at that\r\nseason of the year, be plainly seen from the ships. There can be no\r\ndoubt as to this point, as these are the only mountains that approach\r\nthe coast and form so marked an object from the sea when the air is\r\nclear. They are then visible from the town of Zanzibar.”\r\n\r\n[112] This was Pemba, which, owing to its deep bays, appeared to\r\nconsist of a number of islands. Its distance from the mainland is only\r\n30 miles (9 leagues), its length 37 miles. The trees of that island\r\nstill supply masts for native vessels (Note by Sir J. Kirk).\r\n\r\n[113] Zavra or zabra, a dhow, which is a small open vessel, sharp at\r\nthe stern, with a square sail of matting.\r\n\r\n[114] The Swahili “dress” their vessels at the feast that follows the\r\nRamadan month (Sir J. Kirk), but Ramadan, of the year of the Hejra 903,\r\n_began_ on April 23, 1498, and the Bairam therefore lasted from May\r\n22-24. These dates are according to the Old Style.\r\n\r\n[115] _Alcaide_, from the Arabic _Alkadi_, the Judge.\r\n\r\n[116] Burton (_Camoens_, iv, p. 241) suggests that this picture of the\r\nHoly Ghost may have been a figure of Kapot-eshwar, the Hindu pigeon-god\r\nand goddess, an incarnation of Shiva and his wife, the third person of\r\nthe Hindu Triad.\r\n\r\n[117] Trigo tremez, corn that ripens in three months. This, according\r\nto a note furnished by Sir John Kirk, would be sorghum (the “matama” of\r\nthe Swahili), which is sent in shiploads to Arabia and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[118] These two “Moors” were undoubtedly two of the four men whom Paulo\r\nda Gama had captured at Moçambique, but whom the author previously\r\ndescribed as “Negroes”. Of the two pilots who escaped, one had been\r\ngiven them by the Sultan of Moçambique, the other must have been the\r\nold Moor who came on board voluntarily, unless one of the men taken by\r\nPaulo was a pilot. (See note 1, p. 31).\r\n\r\n[119] Barros (_Dec. I_, liv. 8, c. 7) says erroneously that this fort\r\nwas built _after_ Vasco da Gama’s visit. When the vessel of Sancho de\r\nToar, of the armada of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, was lost near Mombaça, the\r\nMoors succeeded in fishing up seven or eight of her guns. These they\r\nplaced in this fort, in the vain hope of being thus enabled to resist\r\nthe attack of D. Francisco d’Almeida in 1505.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[120] Castanheda (I, c. 10, p. 35) says they waited two days in\r\nthe hope of being able to secure a pilot to take them to Calecut. On\r\ncrossing the bar they were unable to heave up one of the anchors. The\r\nMoors subsequently fished it up and placed it near the royal palace,\r\nwhere D. Francisco d’Almeida found it when he took the town in 1505.\r\n\r\n[121] The author spells Milinde, Milynde, Milingue.\r\n\r\n[122] Sir J. Kirk suggests to me that these places are Mtwapa, Takaungu\r\nand Kilifi, distorted into Benapa, Toca-nuguo and Quioniete. “Kioni” is\r\nthe native name of the village usually called Kilifi.\r\n\r\n[123] The ruins of the ancient town of Malindi lie to the south of the\r\nmodern village of that name, and are of great extent. They include\r\nthe remains of a town wall. Persian and Arabic inscriptions have\r\nbeen discovered, but, with the exception of Vasco da Gama’s pillar,\r\nno traces of occupation by the Portuguese. Malindi Road, or Port\r\nMelinda of the Admiralty chart, lies about three miles to the south\r\nof the town, but Vasco da Gama anchored off the town, and not in this\r\nsheltered road. The anchorage is less than half a mile from the town in\r\nfour fathoms and a half. Comp. Lord Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[124] Barros speaks of these Christians as Banyans, while Goes and\r\nCastanheda say that these vessels belonged to merchants from Cranganor,\r\nin Malabar.\r\n\r\n[125] Correa (p. 113) says that the Moor sent with this message was the\r\nDavane already referred to, and (p. 115) distinguishes him from the\r\nMoor who was captured on April 14th.\r\n\r\n[126] _Balandrau_, a surtout worn by the Brothers of Mercy in Portugal.\r\n\r\n[127] _Lambel_, a striped cotton stuff which had a large sale at the\r\nbeginning of the African trade.—HERCULANO.\r\n\r\n[128] I am indebted for a photograph of one of these trumpets to Sir\r\nJohn Kirk, who states that the Royal Trumpet, or Siwa, was peculiar\r\nto the cities ruled by the descendants of the Persians of Shiraz, who\r\nsettled on this coast in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They were\r\nof ivory, or copper and wood, and consisted of three pieces. The ivory\r\nor copper was sometimes most elaborately carved, and bore Arabic texts.\r\n\r\n[129] We learn from this passage that the “king” referred to by the\r\nauthor was in reality the king’s son, who acted as regent. He may\r\nbe supposed to be the Sheikh Wagerage (Wajeraj), who in 1515 wrote\r\na letter to D. Manuel, in which he begged for permission to send\r\nannually _one_ vessel to Goa and to Mozambique. He very humbly (or\r\nsarcastically?) addresses the king as the “fountain of the commerce\r\nof all cities and kingdoms, the most equitable of sovereigns, and the\r\nenricher of all people”; when, indeed, the Portuguese had crippled\r\nthe trade of Malindi, which had received them with open arms. Another\r\nletter addressed to King Manuel was written by “Ali, King of Melinde”,\r\nin 1520. Was this “king” the son of Wajeraj, or of the “prince who\r\nvisited Vasco da Gama on board his vessel”? F. João de’Sousa, who\r\npublishes these letters (_Documentos Arabicos_, Lisbon, 1790, pp. 67,\r\n123), with a few comments, only obscures the point, unless indeed\r\nWajeraj the Sheikh and Ali the Prince be one and the same person.\r\n\r\nCabral met a Sheikh Omar, a brother of the King of Malindi, who was\r\npresent at Malindi when Vasco da Gama touched at that place; as also a\r\nSheikh Foteima, an uncle of the king (Barros, _Dec. I_, liv. 5, c. 3).\r\n\r\nOn the ungenerous treatment dealt to the King of Malindi, see D. F.\r\nd’Almeida’s letter of 1507 (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 125).\r\n\r\n[130] Of course they looked upon these Romish images and pictures as\r\noutlandish representations of their own gods or idols.\r\n\r\n[131] Burton (_Camoens_, IV, p. 420) suggests that they cried\r\n_Krishna_, the name of the eighth Incarnation of Vishnu, the second\r\nperson of the Hindu Trinity, and the most popular of Indian gods. Sir\r\nJ. Kirk knows of no word resembling “Krist” likely to have been called\r\nout by these Indians.\r\n\r\n[132] This pilot was a native of Gujarat, whom Goes (c. 38), Barros\r\n(_Dec. I_, liv. 4, c. 6), and Faria y Sousa call Malema Cana, or\r\nCanaqua. Malema is a corruption of Mallim, master or teacher, whilst\r\nCanaqua (Kanaka), is the name of his caste. It is also used for sailing\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n[133] The island in question is Kilwa. The information furnished by\r\nthis Malindi pilot is scarcely more correct than that previously\r\nobtained from the Moors (see note 3, p. 32).\r\n\r\n[134] Alcochete, a town on the left bank of the estuary of the Tagus,\r\nabove Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[135] From April 15 to 23 is nine days.\r\n\r\n[136] The “Bay” is the Arabian Sea, which the “Strait” of Bab el\r\nMandeb joins to the Red Sea. Cambay (Khambhat), in Gujarat, when the\r\nPortuguese first came to India, was one of the most flourishing marts\r\nof commerce. The silting up of the Gulf accounts, in a large measure,\r\nfor its commercial decline since then.\r\n\r\n[137] The MS. says 17th, but Friday was the 18th.\r\n\r\n[138] From April 24 to May 18, both days inclusive, is twenty-five\r\ndays; the African coast was within sight for several days.\r\n\r\n[139] Mount Eli (Dely) was probably the land first sighted, a\r\nconspicuous hill forming a promontory about 16 miles to the north of\r\nCananor, and named thus from the Cardamoms which are largely exported\r\nfrom this part of Malabar, and are called Ela in Sanscrit (Yule’s\r\n_Marco Polo_, ii, p. 321).\r\n\r\n[140] The rains in Malabar begin about April or May, and continue until\r\nSeptember or October. They are synchronous with the S.W. monsoon, and\r\nare heaviest in June, July, and August. The annual rainfall exceeds 150\r\ninches!\r\n\r\n[141] Cotta Point, or Cape Kadalur, the “Monte Formosa”, of the\r\nPortuguese, 15 miles N.N.W. of Calecut.\r\n\r\n[142] Castanheda and Barros call this place Capocate. It was seven\r\nmiles N.N.W. of Calecut, at the mouth of the Elatur River.\r\n\r\n[143] The MS. says “abaixo”, below, with reference no doubt to the\r\nlatitude, which is less than that of Calecut.\r\n\r\n[144] Pandaramy (Pandarani) is Batuta’s Fandarain. Barros calls it\r\nPandarane. It is identical with Pantharini Kollam, the northern Kollam\r\nor Quillan, and boasts one of the nine original mosques built on the\r\nMalabar coast by Malik Ibn Dinar. It is 14 miles N.N.W. of Calecut. The\r\nauthor of the MS. elsewhere spells Pandaramy and Pandarin.\r\n\r\n[145] According to Correa (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 159), his name\r\nwas João Nunez. See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[146] One of the “Moors” is frequently referred to as “Monçaide”. See\r\nAppendix E.\r\n\r\n[147] Castanheda (I, c. 15) retails the conversation which this Moor\r\nis supposed to have had with Gama on board ship, and says that the\r\ncaptain-major was much pleased with his offers of service.\r\n\r\n[148] The visitors thus became at once acquainted with the various\r\ncastes constituting the population of Calecut, including the _Nairs_,\r\nor fighting caste of Malabar, who eat meat (which shows a servile\r\norigin), but wear the thread of the Dwija (twice-born), rank next to\r\nthe Brahmans, and practise polyandry; and the turbulent _Moplah_, who\r\nare descendants of Arab fathers and native women. These latter are the\r\n“native” Moors.\r\n\r\n[149] Goes (I, c. 39) and Castanheda (I, c. 15) say that he was at\r\nPanane, a coast town, 28 miles to the south of Calecut.\r\n\r\n[150] One of these messengers was Fernão Martins. They were accompanied\r\nby Monçaide (Castanheda, I, c. 15).\r\n\r\n[151] Off Calecut there are banks and reefs which may endanger the\r\nsafety of a ship, but the anchorage in the roadstead within them is\r\nperfectly safe.\r\n\r\n[152] _Bale_ in the Arabic Wali, governor. _Alcaide_, in Portuguese,\r\nhas this same meaning. Barros and Castanheda give this official the\r\ntitle of “Catual” (Kot-wal, governor of a fort, in Hindustani). He was\r\nthe civil intendant of the Rajah and head of the police. Correa calls\r\nhim _gosil_, or _guozil_ (pron. Wozil), a corruption, probably, of the\r\nArabic _wazir_, minister.\r\n\r\n[153] Among the thirteen men were Diogo Dias, João de Sá, Gonçalo\r\nPirez, Alvaro Velho, Alvaro de Braga, João de Setubal, João de Palha,\r\nand six others, whose names are not recorded. Paulo da Gama and\r\nCoelho were left in charge of the vessels, with orders to sail at\r\nonce for Portugal should any disaster happen to their chief. Coelho\r\nwas, moreover, ordered to await his chief’s return in the boats. See\r\nAppendix E.\r\n\r\n[154] This river is the Elatur. See Map IV.\r\n\r\n[155] Burton (_Goa_, p. 191) says that even now the usual ferry-boat\r\nconsists of a platform of planks lashed to two canoes and usually\r\nrailed round.\r\n\r\n[156] This “church” was, of course, a pagoda or temple. The high pillar\r\nin front of it is used for suspending the flag which indicates the\r\ncommencement of the Temple festival. It is of wood, but usually covered\r\nwith copper or silver. The cock, which surmounts it, is the symbol of\r\nthe War-god Subraumainar. The smaller pillar supports the coco-oil\r\nlamps during the festival.—Rev. J. J. Jaus.\r\n\r\n[157] Corucheo, which literally means spire or minaret; but further on\r\nthe author calls this sanctuary a chapel, capella. Goes (c. 40) calls\r\nit a “round” chapel.\r\n\r\n[158] Goes (c. 40) says that the four priests alone entered this\r\nsanctuary, and, pointing to the image, said “Maria, Maria”, upon which\r\nthe natives prostrated themselves, whilst the Portuguese knelt, in\r\nadoration of the Virgin. Burton suggests that this was an image of\r\nGauri, the “White Goddess”, whilst Charton (III, p. 246) suggests Maha\r\nMaja and her son Shakya. Our illustration is taken from E. Moor, _The\r\nHindu Pantheon_, new edition by Rev. W. O. Simpson (Madras, 1864) Plate\r\nxxxv. It represents Krishna and his mother Devaki. When Kansa (Devaki’s\r\nbrother) heard of his birth, he ordered all newly-born infants to be\r\nslain. The trays with animals and fruit are supposed to symbolise\r\nKrishna’s power over the animal and vegetable kingdoms. On the low\r\ntable are placed food, poison, and amrita, symbolising life, death, and\r\nimmortality, as also a small triangular die denoting trinity in unity.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Jacob Jaus, of the Basel Mission at Calicut, informs me\r\nthat there is a local deity called Māri, or Māriamma, much dreaded as\r\nthe goddess of small-pox, and highly venerated. Amma, in Malayalam,\r\nmeans mother.\r\n\r\n[159] These bells are struck by the Brahmans when they enter the\r\ntemple, but must not be touched by people of inferior castes.\r\n\r\n[160] It is just possible that some of the Portuguese doubted whether\r\nthese Hindu Gods and images represented the saints of their own\r\nchurches. Castanheda (i, p. 57) says that when João de Sá knelt down by\r\nthe side of Vasco da Gama, he said: “If these be devils, I worship the\r\ntrue God”; at which his chief smiled. But however this may be, it is\r\nequally true that the reports furnished by the heads of the expedition\r\ndescribed these Hindus as Christians, and that the king believed them\r\nto be so (see Appendix A).\r\n\r\n[161] The “quafees” are, of course, Brahman priests. The Rev. J. J.\r\nJaus suggests _kāz_ (Arabic), meaning “judge”.\r\n\r\n[162] The “white earth” is a mixture of dust, cow-dung, sacrificial\r\nashes, sandal wood, etc., cemented in rice-water (see Belnos, _The\r\nSundya or Daily Prayer of the Brahmans_, Lond., 1851).\r\n\r\n[163] For a description of this palace, see _Travels of Pietro della\r\nValle_ (Hakluyt Society, 1892), pp. 367-377.\r\n\r\n[164] Goes says that knives were used.\r\n\r\n[165] For Correa’s elaborate but quite untrustworthy narrative of this\r\naudience, see Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 193-6.\r\n\r\n[166] Atambor, a corruption of the Arabic _tambur_, the betel-nut. It\r\nis the fruit of Areca Catechu, and is universally chewed throughout\r\nIndia, the Indian Archipelago and Southern China. Its juice discolours\r\nthe teeth, but is said to make the breath sweet, and to be conducive\r\nto health. “Erva” (herb) is quite inapplicable to this fruit. Usually\r\nit is cut up into four slices, which are wrapped up in a leaf of\r\nBetel-pepper (Piper Betle), and chewed with an admixture of lime and\r\ncatechu.\r\n\r\n[167] These fruits were the Jack (_Artocarpus integrifolia_) and\r\nbananas.\r\n\r\n[168] According to Goes (c. 41), Gama was attended by his interpreter,\r\nFernão Martins, whilst the king was attended by the head Brahman, his\r\nbetel carrier, and his factor (veador da fazenda), who, he said, were\r\npersons in his confidence.\r\n\r\n[169] These are, of course, the letters referred to by Barros and other\r\nhistorians, which were given to Gama when he left Portugal. Correa’s\r\nstory, that Vasco and his brother Paulo concocted the letters whilst\r\noff Calecut, and forged the king’s signature, is therefore quite\r\nincredible. Nor is Gama made to say in the “Roteiro” that he had been\r\nsent with a fleet of fifty ships, and that the voyage took two years\r\n(Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 168, 173). The “grand” Vasco has many\r\nsins to answer for, and we ought not, without good proof, to fasten\r\nupon him the charge of forgery. As to truthfulness, that seems not to\r\nhave been a strong point with the diplomatists of that age.\r\n\r\n[170] That is, it was about 10 P.M.\r\n\r\n[171] This was done to afford shelter until the rain should have ceased.\r\n\r\n[172] It is still the practice in Calecut to ride horses without a\r\nsaddle, and no slight seems therefore to have been intended.\r\n\r\n[173] According to G. Correa’s not very credible narrative, the captain\r\nslept at the factory, which had been established previously to the\r\naudience of which an account has just been given.\r\n\r\n[174] _Lambel_, striped cloth, see p. 41, note 3.\r\n\r\n[175] As a matter of fact, Vasco da Gama was very poorly provided with\r\nsuitable merchandise, as may be seen from the king’s letter printed in\r\nthe Appendix.\r\n\r\n[176] Barros writes Çamorij; Correa, Samori and Çamorin, and others\r\nZamorin. It is a title; according to some a corrupt reading of Tamuri\r\nRajah, Tamuri being the name of the most exalted family of the Nair\r\ncaste, whilst others derive it from “Samudriya Rajah”, that is, “King\r\nof the Coast” (see G. P. Badger’s _Varthema_, pp. lxii and I, 37).\r\n\r\n[177] Whom others call his “veador”, that is butler or comptroller of\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\n[178] That is, a man of Guzerat.\r\n\r\n[179] “Bisarma” in the original. Herculano accepts the definition of\r\nSpelmann (_[v]_. Ducange, _sub_ bisarma).\r\n\r\n[180] These men were Diogo Dias, as factor, and Alvaro de Braga as his\r\nassistant (Castanheda, I, 74.)\r\n\r\n[181] The fanão of Calecut (according to Nunes, _O Livro dos Pesos_,\r\n1554) is worth 25-5/7 reis, or 7.45_d._ Three hundred reis of the\r\ncoinage of 1485 were of the value of 7_s._ 7_d._, taking the gold\r\ncruzado at 9_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n[182] The bahar at Calecut is equivalent to 208.16 kilogrammes (Nunes,\r\n_O Livro dos Pesos_.)\r\n\r\n[183] The xerafin at Calecut is worth about 7_s._ 5_d._; the sum demanded\r\ntherefore amounted to £223.\r\n\r\n[184] Can this be Ormuz?\r\n\r\n[185] This Moor was Monçaide, elsewhere more accurately referred to as\r\n“a Moor of Tunis”. See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[186] The author says nineteen; but it appears from what precedes that\r\nthere were only eighteen in all. See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[187] The author says Wednesday, but that day was the 22nd.\r\n\r\n[188] A reference to the 600 xerafins.\r\n\r\n[189] The “tenor”, not the literal phraseology; and hence the absence\r\nof the complimentary verbiage so usual with Orientals must not be\r\ninterpreted as an intentional insult to the King of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[190] This pillar was dedicated to S. Gabriel. There exists apparently\r\nno record of its having actually been set up by the king, as promised.\r\n\r\n[191] This “Moor of Tunis”, according to Castanheda (I, c. 24, p. 8),\r\nwas Bontaibe (Monçaide), concerning whom see Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[192] As a matter of fact, it was only a portion of what had been\r\nlanded, and Cabral was instructed to demand payment from the Samorin\r\nfor what had not been returned (_Alguns documentos_, p. 98).\r\n\r\n[193] Five of these men of Calecut were actually taken to Lisbon. They\r\nwere restored to their country by Cabral (see _Alguns documentos_, p.\r\n97).\r\n\r\n[194] Castanheda calls these “barcas”, _tones_. The “tone” is a rowing\r\nboat, the planks of which are “sewn” together.\r\n\r\n[195] A note by the copyist says:—“The author has omitted to tell us\r\nhow these weapons were made.”\r\n\r\n[196] The country of Prester John (Abyssinia) was known as “Lower\r\nIndia.”\r\n\r\n[197] Ceylon cinnamon still enjoys this pre-eminence, its cultivation\r\nin other parts of the world not having hitherto been attended with\r\nsuccess. The “cinnamon”, or cassia, found in Malabar is of very\r\ninferior quality.\r\n\r\n[198] The Moluccas, and more especially Amboīna, are the true home\r\nof the clove, the cultivation of which is now carried on widely in\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[199] Should be Arabia.\r\n\r\n[200] The “Grand Sultan” is, of course, the Circassian Mamluk Sultan of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n[201] Prof. Kopke rashly identifies this place with Suez, but M. F.\r\nDenis points out that it must be Tor.\r\n\r\n[202] The cruzado was a Portuguese gold coin worth about 9s. 8d.;\r\n600,000 cruzados amounted thus to £290,000.\r\n\r\n[203] This Cidadym (called Cadadin in the _Commentaries of Afonso\r\nDalbuquerque_, Hakluyt Society, 1875, i, p. 202) can be identified with\r\nSultan Muhammed ben Azhar ed-din ben Ali ben Abu Bekr ben Sa’d ed din,\r\nof Harar, who ruled 1487-1520 (see Paulitschke, _Harar_, p. 506).\r\n\r\n[204] Castanheda (I, c. 25, p. 84) says that Monçaide wrote this\r\nletter, in which Vasco da Gama apologised for having carried off the\r\nMalabaris; explained that he had done so in order that they might bear\r\nwitness to the discoveries he had made; and said that he would have\r\nleft a factor behind him if he had not been afraid that the Moors would\r\nkill him. He expressed a hope that ultimately friendly relations would\r\nbe established to their mutual advantage. Goes (c. 43), who also gives\r\na version of this letter, says the king was much pleased with it, and\r\nread it to his wives and the relatives of the kidnapped men.\r\n\r\n[205] Burton (_Camoens_) identifies Compia with Cananor, which, on\r\nthe partition of the dominions of Cherman Perumal was included in\r\nthe kingdom of the Chirrakal Rajahs. From João de Sousa (_Documentos\r\nArabicos_, p. 80) we learn that the king with whom Vasco da Gama made a\r\ntreaty in 1502 was called Cotelery. Correa (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_,\r\np. 224) gives a circumstantial account of Vasco da Gama’s transactions\r\nwith the king of Cananor during this first voyage. Neither Goes nor\r\nBarros knows anything about these events.\r\n\r\n[206] These are the Netrani or Pigeon Islands (Ilhas dos Pombos), in\r\nlat. 14° 1´ N., the largest being about half a mile in length, and\r\nrising to a height of 300 feet.\r\n\r\n[207] The Anjediva or “Five Islands” lie close to the coast in 14° 45´\r\nN., and about 40 miles to the south of Goa. The largest of these is\r\nnot quite a mile in length. It rises boldly from the sea, but a beach\r\non its northern side affords facilities for landing. D. Francisco de\r\nAlmeida built a fort there in 1505, but it was demolished seven months\r\nafterwards. The existing fortifications were erected by order of\r\nFrancisco de Tavora, Conde d’Alvar, in 1682. (See A. Lopez Mendes, _A\r\nIndia Portugueza_, ii, 1886, p. 209, with map.)\r\n\r\n[208] The author says 19th, but Thursday was the 20th.\r\n\r\n[209] These branches and leaves were carried to Portugal, as we learn\r\nfrom the king’s letter (see Appendix A), but they had most certainly\r\nnot been taken from true cinnamon trees, for only an inferior cassia is\r\nfound in that part of India.\r\n\r\n[210] Barros and Goes say that the leader of these vessels was a\r\npirate named Timoja, whose head-quarters were at Onor. He subsequently\r\nrendered valuable services to the Portuguese. (See Stanley’s _Vasco da\r\nGama_, p. 244.)\r\n\r\n[211] This island was the largest of the Anjediva.\r\n\r\n[212] Three lingams, emblems of the generative power?\r\n\r\n[213] The _fusta_ is a galley or undecked rowing boat, with one mast.\r\nFor an illustration see Linschoten’s _Itinerarium ofte Schip-vaert_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[214] Tambaram, in Malayalam, has merely the meaning of lord or master.\r\n\r\n[215] This man subsequently became known as Gaspar da Gama. See\r\nAppendix E.\r\n\r\n[216] The Sabayo or Governor of Goa.\r\n\r\n[217] The original MS. uses the verb “perguntar”, that is, to question;\r\nbut Barros says that he was tortured, and this would account for his\r\nattempting to make himself understood by “gestures”, when previously he\r\nhad spoken very fluently, and had been understood.\r\n\r\n[218] September 24 to October 5 is twelve days, both days inclusive.\r\n\r\n[219] From October 5 to January 2.\r\n\r\n[220] At Mombaça.\r\n\r\n[221] The MS. says “February” but this is an obvious mistake.\r\n\r\n[222] From Moçambique to Madagascar is only 60 leagues; 300 leagues\r\nwould carry a ship as far as the Seychelles.\r\n\r\n[223] Mukhdisho of the Arabs, Madisha of the Somal, in lat. 5° N. The\r\ntown was founded by Arabs, perhaps on the site of a more ancient city,\r\nin 907, and attained the height of its prosperity under the dynasty of\r\nthe El Mdofer, which was expelled by the Abgal Somal, probably in the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[224] Whether merely as a sign of rejoicing or in wanton enmity is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n[225] Pate is an island in 26° 5´ S., with a town of the same name.\r\n\r\n[226] The author says the 9th, but Monday was the 7th. The stay of five\r\ndays extended from the 7th to the 11th.\r\n\r\n[227] “Vasco da Gama’s Pillar”, now to be seen at Malindi, close to the\r\ntown (to the left of it as seen from the sea) and at the extremity of\r\na narrow rocky promontory of only a few feet in height, is certainly\r\nnot the padrão erected by the great navigator, though it probably\r\noccupies its site. When Cabral arrived at Malindi in 1501 the pillar\r\nhad been removed, it having proved a “stone of offence” to the people\r\nof Mombaça. The king, however, had stowed it away carefully, and had\r\neven caused the royal arms to be repainted. João de Sá, who had been\r\nwith Gama, identified it.\r\n\r\nThe existing pillar, of which we give an illustration, is built up\r\nof concrete made of coral rock and lime. It rises to a height of 16\r\nfeet, and is surmounted by a cross, bearing on the sea side the arms\r\nof Portugal, but no inscription. It is not the pillar put up at the\r\nrequest of Vasco da Gama, but Sir John Kirk feels sure that the cross\r\nis very ancient. The latter is of sandstone, and evidently of local\r\nmake, whilst the other crosses discovered hitherto are of limestone or\r\nmarble. See Introduction.\r\n\r\n[228] This ambassador returned with Cabral in 1501.\r\n\r\n[229] The figure-head of the _S. Raphael_ was taken away by Vasco da\r\nGama and treated as an heirloom by the family, several members of\r\nwhich carried it with them on their travels. It ultimately found a\r\nresting-place in the church of Vidigueira, founded by D. Francisco da\r\nGama. When the church was desecrated in 1840, the figure was removed to\r\nanother church, where Texeira de Aragão discovered it in 1853. It is\r\nnow in the church at Belem. The figure is carved in oak, and about 24\r\ninches in height (see _Texeira de Aragão_, in the Boletim of the Lisbon\r\nGeographical Society, VI, 1886, p. 621.)\r\n\r\n[230] The author says five, but from January 13 to January 27, both\r\nincluded, is fifteen days.\r\n\r\n[231] Barros says _Tangata_. It is Mtangata (see note, p. 33).\r\n\r\n[232] Zanzibar is only twenty miles (six leagues) from the mainland.\r\n\r\n[233] Twenty-seven days carry us from March 20 to April 16.\r\n\r\n[234] The author here evidently refers to tornadoes or violent gusts\r\nof wind peculiar to the west coast of Africa, and more frequent at the\r\nbeginning and termination of the rainy season. They generally blow off\r\nshore, their approach being indicated by an arch of clouds, from which\r\nlightning and thunder constantly proceed. At Sierra Leone the rainy\r\nseason begins at the end of April (see _Africa Pilot_, 1893, Part II,\r\np. 10).\r\n\r\n[235] The Rio Grande of the Portuguese is an arm of the sea from five\r\nto thirteen miles in breadth, called Orango Channel on the Admiralty\r\nChart. It lies between the mainland and the Bissagos islands.\r\n\r\n[236] This church was demolished in 1646; the place of burial can no\r\nlonger be identified.\r\n\r\n[237] See _Jose da Silva Mendes Leal_ (Transactions of Lisbon Academy,\r\n1871), and _Texeira de Aragão_ (Boletim Lisbon Geogr. Soc., VI, 1886,\r\np. 583).\r\n\r\n[238] This trustworthy man can have been no other than the “Moor” who\r\nwas carried off from Anjediva (see Appendix E), and who, having been\r\nbaptised, became known as Gaspar da Gama.\r\n\r\n[239] The frazila of Calecut is equal to 10.4 kilogr.; the fanão is\r\nworth 25-5/7 reis of 1555 (about 7.45_d._) and the cruzado is worth\r\n9_s._ 8_d._ But if 3 cruzados are accepted as the equivalent of 50\r\nfanãos, the value of a fanão would be 6.96_d._\r\n\r\n[240] I have little doubt that instead of Baqua we ought to read\r\nBezoar. In D. Manuel’s letter to the King of Castile, the royal writer\r\nstates that among the presents which the King of Cochin gave to Vasco\r\nda Gama (in 1502) there was a stone as large as a filbert, which was\r\ntaken out of the head of a very rare animal, called Burgoldof, and\r\nwhich proved a specific against all poisons.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. J. Jaus, of the Basel Mission, informs me that the\r\nbezoar, in Malayalam, is called _Gōrōchanam_, which means “out of\r\nthe cow’s brain”, _go_ signifying cow. It still sells for its weight\r\nin silver, and is highly prized as a medicine and antidote. My\r\nesteemed correspondent is unable to enlighten me as to the meaning of\r\n_burgoldof_.\r\n\r\nBishop J. M. Speechly, in a letter addressed to me, suggests that\r\n“Baqua” (Bakwa) may be a corruption of “Bagawat”, a common name for\r\nShiva, and the “Stone of Baqua” a dedication to him.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic name of the bezoar (badesar) has the meaning of antidote.\r\nThis “stone” is a calcareous concretion found in the intestines of some\r\nanimals, more especially goats and antelopes, but also in those of\r\nmonkeys. It varies in size from a pea to a fist. All through the Middle\r\nAges, this oriental bezoar was looked upon as a most potent medicine\r\nagainst poisons, and it is still highly valued in the East. The Bezoar\r\nof Goa (Gowa) is an artificial product made up of musk, ambergris, and\r\ngum of tragacanth.\r\n\r\n[241] The pequy (pik) is about 27 inches.\r\n\r\n[242] This, according to Prof. Kopke, is meant for Crangalor, the\r\nmodern Kodungalar in Cochin. The frazila there is equal to 8.314 kilo.,\r\nand the fanão, when buying pepper, is valued at 22-8/19 reis (6.5_d._).\r\n\r\n[243] It is the Coilum of Marco Polo, the Columbum of Friar Jordanus\r\n(1330), the modern Quilon. It is one of the principal seats of the\r\nSyrian Christians. The Portuguese built a fort there in 1503.\r\n\r\n[244] Marco Polo’s Cael has been satisfactorily identified by Dr.\r\nCaldwell with the decayed village of Kayal (Palaya Kayal), near the\r\nmouth of the Tamrapanni river; whilst our author’s Caell is the\r\nCallegrande of Barros, now represented by Kayal Patnam, some distance\r\nto the south of that river. (Comp. Yule’s _Marco Polo_, ii, p. 307.)\r\nThe pearl fisheries are near it, on the coast of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[245] According to Prof. Kopke, it extended from Point Calymere to the\r\nGodavari.\r\n\r\n[246] Barbosa (p. 214) says that “the best sapphires are found in\r\nCeylon,” as also “many rubies,” but inferior to those of Pegu.\r\n\r\n[247] The silk referred to by the author, as also by Barbosa and\r\nBarros, is the produce of the silk cotton tree (_Bombax malabaricum_)\r\nand is much inferior in quality to true silk.—KOPKE.\r\n\r\n[248] This, according to Prof. Kopke and Yule (_Marco Polo_, ii, p.\r\n222), is Siam, the old capital of which (Ayuthia) is called Sornau or\r\nXarnau by Varthema, Giovanni d’Empoli, and Mendez Pinto.\r\n\r\n[249] Benzoin (Gum-Benjamin) is the produce of Styrax Benzoin, found in\r\nSiam, Cochin-China, Java and Sumatra, that of Siam being accounted the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n[250] The odoriferous aloe-wood of the author is the wood of _Aquilaria\r\nAgallocha (Roxb.)_, found in Further India, and more especially in\r\nChamba. Its Sanscrit name, Aguru, was corrupted into Agila and Aquila;\r\nand hence its Latin and Portuguese name of “Eaglewood.” (Yule’s _Marco\r\nPolo_, ii, p. 215.)\r\n\r\n[251] Prof. Kopke identifies Tenacar with Tenasserim, a great emporium\r\nat one time, through which the products of Siam reached the outer world.\r\n\r\n[252] Brazil-wood first became known in Europe at the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century under the designation of _Lignum presillum_.\r\nThe most esteemed kind of this dye-wood is known as Sapan wood\r\n(_Caesalpinia sappan_), found more especially in Siam.\r\n\r\n[253] This is no doubt Bengal, the capital of which was Chatigam\r\n(Chittagong).\r\n\r\n[254] Cloves were originally found only in the Moluccas; the true\r\nnutmeg (_Myristica moschata_) comes from the same islands and those\r\nfurther to the east. Tin was—and still is—a native product. The silk\r\nand porcelain came from China.\r\n\r\n[255] The frazila was equal to 10.51 kilo., the bahar was 210.22 kilo.\r\nThe cruzado was a silver coin and was valued at 360 reis (8_s._ 8_d._).\r\n\r\n[256] Barbosa (p. 186) gives a better account of musk, which really\r\nonly reaches Pegu from the interior. It is the secretion of _Moschus\r\nmoschiferus_, an animal resembling a deer, which lives in the mountains\r\nlying between the Amur river, China and India. The male has a pouch\r\nbetween the navel and the genitals which holds about 50 grammes of this\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\n[257] Burma, above Pegu, is still famous for its rubies.\r\n\r\n[258] This is evidently a duplicate account of what has been said above\r\nabout Bemgala.\r\n\r\n[259] Prof. Kopke would identify this with Timor, where there is a fort\r\ncalled Camanaça. This, however, is quite inadmissible, for there are no\r\nelephants in Timor. I am more inclined to think that “Conimata” stands\r\nfor Sumatra, a small state in North Sumatra, adjoining Pedir. The\r\nvoyage to Pater and Conimata is stated to occupy the same time, viz.,\r\nfifty days. If this be so, there is a duplication of Sumatra as well as\r\nof Bengal.\r\n\r\n[260] This seems to be Pedir, a small kingdom in Northern Sumatra,\r\nwhich had a pagan king when Varthema was there, although many of the\r\ninhabitants were Mohammedans. Rhubarb (_Rheum officinale_) is, however,\r\nonly to be found in W. and N.W. China and in Tibet. The lacca tree is a\r\nnative of Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[261] Say £966.\r\n\r\n[262] In calculating these values we have assumed the quintal to be\r\nequivalent to 100 pounds, the bahar = 460 pounds, the ratel = 1 pound.\r\nThe cruzado is taken at 9_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare these prices with those given by Duarte\r\nBarbosa for Calecut. Assuming the fanão to be worth 6.5_d._ they were\r\nas follows per pound:—Cinnamon, 4.3_d._; cloves, 7.2_d._ to 8.3_d._;\r\npepper, 2.9_d._ to 3.3_d._; ginger, 0.5_d._ to 0.9_d._; nutmeg, 3.0_d._\r\nto 3.36_d._; lac, 3.6_d._ to 5.2_d._; rhubarb, 9_s._ 9_d._ to 11_s._;\r\nmusk, £15 11_s._; aloe-wood, 24_s._ 7_d._; frankincense, 0.9_d._ to\r\n1.5_d._ A purchaser of one pound of each of these commodities would\r\nhave paid at Calecut £17 13_s._ 6_d._, and would have received at\r\nAlexandria £57 12_s._ 8_d._, an increase of 210 per cent. (See Lord\r\nStanley of Alderley’s version of _Duarte Barbosa_, Hakluyt Society,\r\n1866, p. 219.)\r\n\r\nPresent Retail Prices in London are as follows (per pound): cinnamon,\r\n1_s._ 8_d._; cloves, 1_s._ 6_d._; pepper, 7½_d._ to 10½_d._;\r\nginger, 10_d._ to 1_s._ 4_d._; nutmeg, 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._; lac,\r\n8_d._; rhubarb, 8_s._ to 12_s._; musk, £117.\r\n\r\n[263] The words placed within brackets have been kindly furnished me\r\nby the Rt. Rev. J. M. Speechly, D.D., who was Bishop of Travancore,\r\n1879-89. In a letter to me he remarks that, “at the sea-port towns\r\ngenerally the worst Malayālam is spoken. Many Malayālam words are the\r\nsame in Tamil, and in this list there are some which a Tamil scholar\r\nwould be able to point out. Also, it is not unlikely that there are\r\nsome Arabic words Malayālamised in the list. The anonymous author’s\r\nlist is a very interesting one, and his journal, I have no doubt, will\r\nbe so also. The ‘ne’ which ends so many words may stand for ‘nī’,\r\n‘thou’. Sometimes it is only an expressive ending”.\r\n\r\n[264] She died in childbed on August 24, 1498; and Dom Manuel, having\r\nbeen granted a dispensation from the Pope, married her sister, Doña\r\nMaria, on August 24, 1500, the second anniversary of his first wife’s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[265] _Collecção de S. Vicente_, t. III, fol. 513; XIV, fol. 1.\r\n\r\n[266] _Collecção de S. Vicente_, t. XIV, fol. 1.\r\n\r\n[267] Gaspar da Gama certainly came in the _S. Gabriel_ (see\r\nSernigi’s letter, Appendix B).\r\n\r\n[268] The immediate business of Pedro Correa was to get Pope Alexander\r\nVI to grant permission to the Commanders and Knights of the Orders of\r\nChrist and Aviz to marry. In this he succeeded (Goes, _Chronica do D.\r\nManuel_, I, c. 15).\r\n\r\n[269] “e proveito nosso.” This, in _Alguns Documentos_, is rendered “e\r\nprincipalemente nosso”. It is just possible that the King meant to say\r\nthat the “service of God” was his principal object, as it had been that\r\nof his predecessors.\r\n\r\n[270] “By these same discoverers” (_Alguns Documentos_).\r\n\r\n[271] This reference to “boughs and leaves” reminds us of what the\r\nauthor of the _Journal_ says about gathering the branches and leaves of\r\nsupposed cinnamon trees, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[272] _Alguns Documentos_ adds: “nor such as suited”, that is, suited\r\nthe requirements of the Indian market.\r\n\r\n[273] This paragraph only appears in _Alguns Documentos_.\r\n\r\n[274] The King, or his advisers, thus at once identified Ptolemy’s\r\nTaprobane with Ceylon, whilst Ortelius, the professional geographer,\r\nseventy-six years later, still assigns that name to Sumatra (see his\r\nmap _Indiae Orientalis_, in _Theatrum Orbis Terrarum_).\r\n\r\n[275] Monçaide and Gaspar da Gama, see Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[276] A Bull of Alexander VI, dated Rome 1497, kalendas of June, allows\r\nKing Manuel and his successors to keep possession of the countries\r\nconquered from the infidels, without prejudice to any prior claims of\r\nother Christian powers, and prohibits all kings, not possessing such\r\nclaims, from disturbing King Manuel in the enjoyment of these rights.\r\nFinally, the Pope requires the King to establish the Christian religion\r\nin all the countries he may conquer (quoted from _Alguns Documentos_,\r\np. 90).\r\n\r\n[277] Canestrini, _Delle relazioni tra Firenze e il Portugallo_\r\n(Archivo Storico Italiano, Florence, 1846, App. III).\r\n\r\n[278] Falcão, _Livro de toda a fazenda_, 1612, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[279] See Parte III, _Fonti italiane_, vol. i, p. 215; vol. ii, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[280] _Delle Navigationi e Viaggi_, i, Venice, 1550.\r\n\r\n[281] _Vita e lettere d’ Amerigo Vespucci_, Firenze, 1745, p.

He\r\nis supposed to have paid a flying visit to Rome early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. His brother-in-law, Christopher Welser, was at that time\r\nresident there, and perhaps the abstract was made by him.\r\n\r\n[287] Sailing vessels going from the Cape Verde Islands to Lisbon\r\nfrequently shape their course by the Azores. See p. 94.\r\n\r\n[288] Translated from Codex 1910 in the Riccardian Library at Florence.\r\n\r\n[289] Literally, “whalers”, or “vessels having the shape of a whale”,\r\ncalled “barinels” by the Portuguese, and not caravels.\r\n\r\n[290] According to the _Paesi novamente retrovati_ and Ramusio, there\r\nwere 180, but Peutinger says there were 118, of whom 55 died and 60\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n[291] According to the _Paesi_, etc., July 11th.\r\n\r\n[292] This was the vessel commanded by Nicolau Coelho.\r\n\r\n[293] “_Molto amalado_”. The _Paesi_ says “amallato a morte”, sick unto\r\ndeath, the very expression used by Peutinger.\r\n\r\n[294] Ramusio says 1,300 leagues, but even this is a gross\r\nexaggeration. If we allow 17½ leagues to a degree, the new land\r\nactually discovered beyond the Rio de Infante amounted to 860 leagues,\r\nviz., 800 leagues along the African coast and 60 leagues in India.\r\n\r\n[295] From the Cape to the Rio dos Bons Signaes is only 460 leagues.\r\n\r\n[296] The Rio dos Bons Signaes, or Kiliman River.\r\n\r\n[297] Peutinger says: “if they would stay till new moon, when the\r\nwaters would grow small, they would give them gold in plenty in\r\nexchange for their money or merchandise.”\r\n\r\nThe Zambezi begins to subside in the beginning of April. Vasco da Gama\r\nleft on February 25th. This is a very satisfactory confirmation of the\r\nwriter’s information.\r\n\r\n[298] From the Kiliman River (Zambezi) to Melinde is 330 leagues.\r\n\r\n[299] The writer must have misunderstood his informants. Gaspar da Gama\r\nis evidently referred to. See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[300] From Melinde to Calecut is about 2,340 miles, or 682 leagues.\r\n\r\n[301] This sentence is omitted by Ramusio.\r\n\r\n[302] The “Bab el mandeb”.\r\n\r\n[303] The Strait of Romania is the Bosporus, ancient cartographers\r\n(Ortelius and others) very properly writing “Romania” for the Turkish\r\n“Rum-ili”, instead of the corrupt “Roumelia” of most modern authors.\r\n\r\n[304] The “Sinus Arabicus” of Pliny (vi, 28) is a gulf of the\r\nErythrean, identical with our Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[305] Peutinger adds that the people of Calecut were neither black nor\r\nwhite; and that they were Christians, although bad ones.\r\n\r\n[306] Peutinger says: “churches and convents.”\r\n\r\n[307] Peutinger’s version of this sentence is as follows: “Large and\r\nsmall are baptized in a state of nudity, once every three years, in a\r\nriver near the town.”\r\n\r\n[308] The writer evidently refers to the roads in Portugal, but Ramusio\r\nsays “as in Italy”.\r\n\r\n[309] Ramusio: “Esquires, doorkeepers and chamberlains.”\r\n\r\n[310] Ramusio and Peutinger say: “by about fifty persons.”\r\n\r\n[311] Peutinger says the couch “was hung round (umhangen) with\r\nblackish-green velvet, and had a white coverlet, all worked with gold,\r\nand above it a sumptuous curtain. The walls were hung with fine velvet\r\nof various colours.”\r\n\r\n[312] Peutinger: “the king had the captain asked what he wanted or\r\nsought.”\r\n\r\n[313] Ramusio: “carried on in their vessels.”\r\n\r\n[314] Peutinger translates: “Irrkirche,” _i.e._, heterodox church.\r\n\r\n[315] Industria: The word in Peutinger’s letter, “gescheidigkeit”, or\r\nintelligence, seems more appropriate.\r\n\r\n[316] Ramusio adds here “partly”. The island is Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[317] Ramusio adds: “and not by Christians, and the Moors are the\r\nmasters (signori).”\r\n\r\n[318] The Italian original has “stapola”.\r\n\r\n[319] Babylonia of Egypt. Ramusio omits “Babylonia”. Peutinger has\r\nAlkeiro (Cairo).\r\n\r\n[320] The xerafins of Portuguese authors, worth about 7_s._ 10_d._ (at\r\nCalecut).\r\n\r\n[321] The _Paesi_ and Ramusio add “zetanini velutati”; and Ramusio\r\nintroduces also “damasked Lucca cloth”, in place of “scarlet cloth”.\r\nProf. Dalla Vedova suggests that “cetanini” may stand for “setini”,\r\na silken stuff of narrow width used in decorating the columns of\r\nchurches. Bandini says it means “zendado, a kind of cloth”. Lucca was\r\nfamous in the sixteenth century for its silks and woollen cloths.\r\n\r\n[322] Tin, from Malacca.\r\n\r\n[323] The _Paesi_, Ramusio, and Peutinger say May 19. According to the\r\n“Roteiro”, Vasco da Gama anchored off Capua on May 20.\r\n\r\n[324] Ramusio says 200 tons; Peutinger 1,200.\r\n\r\n[325] This sentence is omitted by Ramusio; but Peutinger says “many of\r\nthese vessels are drowned in the sea”.\r\n\r\n[326] Ramusio says: “are of curious build”.\r\n\r\n[327] Ramusio adds: “but with wooden bolts”, but omits the allusion to\r\nthe loadstone.\r\n\r\nPeutinger locates the “calamito or loadstone” near Ceylon. The myth\r\nof magnetic mountains and islands originated in India or China, and\r\nwas widely credited during the Middle Ages. It was believed that the\r\nmagnet pulled out the iron bolts and nails of passing ships, which\r\nthen fell to pieces and were lost.]\r\n\r\n[328] Ramusio adds: “The sea rises and falls alternately every six\r\nhours, as elsewhere, and sometimes between 500 and 700 vessels may be\r\nseen there—a great sight”.\r\n\r\n[329] Peutinger adds that the cantar is equal to 250 pounds, when in\r\nfact it is only a hundredweight. Five cantars were equal to 1 bahar =\r\n208 kilo = 460 pounds.\r\n\r\n[330] Ramusio and Peutinger say that ginger is worth only one half.\r\nThey say nothing about cinnamon.\r\n\r\n[331] Ramusio says nothing about “calking”. The writer seems to look\r\nupon “ballasting” and “calking” as identical operations. Or has he made\r\nuse of a Portuguese term (alastrar), the meaning of which he did not\r\nknow? Or are we to understand that lac was employed as a substitute for\r\npitch?\r\n\r\n[332] Ramusio and Peutinger say that they also take corals in payment,\r\nand this seems more probable.\r\n\r\n[333] “Balasci” are the pink rubies named after the country of their\r\norigin, Badakhshi, which was usually known, according to Ibn Batuta,\r\nas Al-balaksh (Yule’s _Marco Polo_, I, p. 169; Heyd, _Geschichte des\r\nLevante-Handels_, 1879, I, p. 582). Badakhshi is Badakhshan, and not a\r\nkingdom near Pegu and Bengal, as supposed by Duarte Barbosa (Hakluyt\r\nSociety’s edition, 1866, p. 212).\r\n\r\n[334] The latter part of this sentence is omitted by Ramusio.\r\n\r\n[335] Bab el Mandeb.\r\n\r\n[336] The Rio dos Bons Signaes, or Zambezi.\r\n\r\n[337] Malvasia (Malmsey) is a luscious Greek wine, named after the\r\ntown of Napoli di Malvasia, in Laconia. The vines were transplanted to\r\nCrete, Madeira, and other places.\r\n\r\n[338] Ramusio says: “they had a beard between the nose and the mouth,\r\nsuch as is worn by the courtiers at Constantinople, who call it a\r\nmoustache.”\r\n\r\n[339] Ramusio adds: “of Melinde”. The “pilot” here referred to was\r\nGaspar da Gama. See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[340] This information was apparently never asked for. The “strangers”\r\nwere undoubtedly Chinese. Marco Polo (_Yule_, I, p. lxvi, and II, pp.\r\n197, 327) already mentions their four-masted vessels. In his time,\r\nChinese vessels regularly visited the west coast of India. The vizor\r\nin the guise of a mask, distinctly points to the Chinese, and the\r\nsword attached to a spear is a Chinese weapon. Up to the introduction\r\nof pig-tails by the Manju, in 1644, the Chinese wore their hair long.\r\nA punitive fleet of sixty-two Chinese vessels was sent to Ceylon in\r\n1401. In 1417 an embassy was sent from Mu-ku-tu-su (Magadoxo) to China\r\n(Bretschneider, _On the Knowledge possessed by the Ancient Chinese of\r\nthe Arabs_, London, 1871), and in 1431 Chinese junks might be seen at\r\nJedda (Hirth, _Verhandlungen_, Berlin Geographical Society, 1889, p.\r\n46).\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the fifteenth century the intercourse between\r\nChina and Malabar seems to have become rare, until at last it ceased\r\naltogether (Richthofen, _China_, I, p. 10, 5).\r\n\r\nRamusio contemptuously suppresses the writer’s speculations about these\r\ncurious strangers being Germans or Russians.\r\n\r\n[341] Less than a penny.\r\n\r\n[342] “di mezo sapore”. Ramusio has “tutte dolci”.\r\n\r\n[343] “Poponi”: Ramusio says “pomi”, apples.\r\n\r\n[344] Or rather Buddha.\r\n\r\n[345] Ramusio has suppressed this passage.\r\n\r\n[346] Ramusio adds: “And bread made of corn and other things of the\r\nkind”.\r\n\r\n[347] Professor Dalla Vedova suggests that the “pescotto” of the\r\noriginal may be the “Pesce persico” (_Perca fluviatilis_), or perch.\r\nRamusio, in his edition of 1563, however, has “pescietti”, which means\r\n“small fishes” (sardines).\r\n\r\n[348] Lenguazzi: perhaps the modern “linguattole”, or sole.\r\n\r\n[349] Bisuccho, in Portuguese Besugo, the sea-bream (_Sparus\r\ncantabricus_).\r\n\r\n[350] The words within brackets are only to be found in the _Paesi_.\r\n\r\n[351] Ramusio adds: “There are also horses as with us, and they are\r\nhighly valued by Christians and Moors alike”. Peutinger and the _Paesi_\r\nsay the same.\r\n\r\n[352] Ramusio says: “silk-stuffs and bocassins”. He does not mention\r\nthe colours.\r\n\r\n[353] Peutinger adds: “They are decent, quiet (fromm) people at his\r\ncourt, and dress according to their condition and rank (adel)”.\r\n\r\n[354] _Jubbi_ (Arabic) is a long coat or caftan; the _balandrau_\r\n(Portuguese) is a surtout worn by the Brothers of Mercy in Portugal.\r\nRamusio calls the latter garments _palascani_.\r\n\r\n[355] The actual distance is about 10,500 nautical miles, or 3,060\r\nPortuguese leagues.\r\n\r\n[356] In his second letter the writer recurs to this subject.\r\n\r\n[357] These are the Laccadive islands, fourteen in number: but, as\r\ntheir name implies (Laksha Dwipa = the Hundred Thousand Islands),\r\nsupposed to be much more numerous. Mr. Sneyd’s _Codex_ says there were\r\n11,000 of these islands. The Maldives were known as Narikela Dwipa.\r\n\r\n[358] That is the West Indies!\r\n\r\n[359] Ramusio adds: “through vessels which go to Mecca”.\r\n\r\n[360] Ramusio adds: “benzoin”.\r\n\r\n[361] It should be 160.\r\n\r\n[362] Ramusio adds: “many sapphires and other jewels”. He then says:\r\n“Pepper and ginger grow around the said city of Calicut”. The paragraph\r\nis worded obscurely, but my version seems to be preferable. Sapphires\r\nare mentioned at the end of the letter.\r\n\r\n[363] Ramusio does not mention almonds, nor does Peutinger.\r\n\r\n[364] This expression proves that the letter was not written at one\r\nsitting, but by degrees.\r\n\r\n[365] Ramusio has much condensed the whole of this paragraph, and seems\r\nto have misunderstood the writer. The statement that provisions were\r\nsent from Melinde to Calecut can hardly be accepted, and it was perhaps\r\nfor this reason that Ramusio suppressed the name of that town. The\r\ncountry around Calecut is certainly sandy, but it is not as sterile as\r\nthe bald statement of the writer would lead one to believe, for the\r\ncity lies in the midst of extensive groves of palm, mango, and jack\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nPeutinger thus summarises this passage: “The country around Kalekut is\r\nmostly sand, and neither corn nor any other fruit grows there. These\r\nare imported by sea.”\r\n\r\n[366] Should be Chalechut, as Bandini prints it.\r\n\r\n[367] The last two paragraphs have been omitted by Ramusio.\r\n\r\n[368] Translated from the _Paesi novamente retrovati_, Vicenza, 1507.\r\n\r\n[369] The true history of the Jewish colony in Malabar has been written\r\nby Claudius Buchanan (_Christian Researches in Asia_, Edinburgh, 1812).\r\nRitter (_Erdkunde_, v, pp. 595-601) gives an excellent summary.\r\n\r\n[370] Gaspar da Gama was quite right. There were no Christians at\r\nCalecut when Vasco da Gama first visited that town, nor are there\r\nmany now. Cochin, and not Calecut, was the chief seat of the Syrian\r\nChristians of Malabar. They were an offshoot of the church of Persia,\r\nwhich recognised the Nestorian patriarch of Babylon (Mosul). After\r\nthe condemnation of their dogmas by the Council of Ephesus (431)\r\nthey sought a refuge in distant countries. After 1599 many of them\r\nrecognised the Pope, but after the ascendency of the Dutch (since\r\n1653) some turned Protestants, whilst others recognised the Jacobite\r\nbishop of Antioch as their head. Popularly they are known as S. Thomas\r\nChristians, although there exists not the slightest evidence of that\r\nApostle ever having visited India. Their worship is of a simple\r\nnature: they admit no images to their churches, reject the doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation, and allow their priests to marry (G. Milne Rae,\r\n_The Syrian Church in India_, 1892; Percy Badger, _The Nestorians and\r\ntheir Ritual_, 1852; German, _Die Kirche der Thomaschristen_, 1877).\r\n\r\n[371] Ramusio says: “excepting those called Jacobites and those of\r\nPrester John.”\r\n\r\n[372] Ramusio says forty days.\r\n\r\n[373] Ramusio adds: “towards the Gulf of Persia”.\r\n\r\n[374] Ramusio says 300 leagues. The real distance of Bahrein is about\r\n550 leagues. There may be some confusion with the Manar pearl fishery.\r\n\r\n[375] Varthema (p. 95) and Duarte Barbosa (p. 37) refer to the pearl\r\nfishery of the Bahrein islands. They both describe the islanders as\r\nMohammedans. Mr. Bent (_Journal Royal Geographical Society_, xii, 1890)\r\nvisited the islands in 1889, and states that there is a good supply of\r\nwater. Indeed, a river such as is described in the letter only exists\r\nsome 250 miles away.\r\n\r\n[376] King Manuel was better advised (see p. 115, note).\r\n\r\n[377] Ramusio says: “is frightened”.\r\n\r\n[378] These “anchors”, according to Varthema (p. 153), consist of a\r\nblock of marble, which has two ropes attached to it. On the African\r\ncoast a box fitted with stones is used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[379] The next expedition was that sent out under Pedralvarez Cabral,\r\nwho left Lisbon in March, 1500, with thirteen vessels.\r\n\r\n[380] In Book VIII of his _Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[381] This last paragraph is not found in the _Paesi novamente\r\nretrovati_, and is taken from Ramusio.\r\n\r\n[382] This paragraph is rather puzzling. July 10th, 1499, was the date\r\nof Coelho’s arrival. Of the four vessels, two are correctly stated to\r\nhave been burnt, though not near Cape Verde, namely, the store ship of\r\n110 tons, and one of the vessels of 90 tons (the _S. Raphael_). Coelho\r\nbrought home the small vessel of 50 tons, and the “captain” himself is\r\nstated to have returned in the remaining vessel of 90 tons.\r\n\r\n[383] The Cape Verde islands.\r\n\r\n[384] Grão or gran (Portuguese), kermes-grain, anciently scarlet, is\r\nnot mentioned by Ramusio.\r\n\r\n[385] Rosebeeren (Roseberries) seems to stand for Rose mallus, or\r\nRossamalha, an aromatic resin containing benzoic acid, yielded by the\r\nmajestic Rasamala tree (_Altingia excelsa_) of Java, where it is used\r\nas a substitute for benzoin.\r\n\r\n[386] I need hardly direct the reader’s attention to the fact that the\r\nfustas of the Sabayo were fought _after_ Vasco’s return from Calecut,\r\nand that he visited neither Cochin nor Cananor in the course of this\r\nfirst voyage.\r\n\r\n[387] A MS. in the Torre do Tombo quoted by Texeira de Aragão\r\n(_Boletim_, VI, 1886, p. 580), ornamented with the coloured coats of\r\narms of the _Counts_ of Vidigueira, and extending to 1641, seems to\r\nbe identical in several respects with the MS. from which the above\r\nis quoted. The concluding portion, beginning with “returned to this\r\nkingdom”, is taken word for word from the earlier _Jornal_. Vasco da\r\nGama is stated to have gone in the _S. Raphael_, whilst Paulo’s vessel,\r\nthe _S. Gabriel_, is said to have been destroyed on the homeward voyage\r\nnear Cabo de S. Vicente.\r\n\r\n[388] Paulo da Gama came back in this vessel, his own having been burnt\r\nby order of Vasco da Gama, off Tangáta. [_Note by the author._]\r\n\r\n[389] Pavia, a small town twenty miles to the north of Evora.\r\n\r\n[390] The 7th of April was a Saturday (see p. 34).\r\n\r\n[391] The preceding dates agree with those in the _Journal_, but the\r\nanchorage, two leagues from Calecut (see p. 48) was only reached on May\r\n20th, and the stay at or off Calecut was certainly much longer than the\r\nseventy-four days allowed by Rezende. In fact, seventy-four days would\r\nonly carry us from May 20th to August 1st.\r\n\r\n[392] That is, the mouth of the Tagus.\r\n\r\n[393] A sailing vessel occasionally propelled by oars.\r\n\r\n[394] Henrique Lopes de Mendonça, _Estudos sobre navios Portuguezes_,\r\nLisbon (Ac.

The result is expressed in _botte_.\r\n\r\n[409] See J. de Barros, _Dec.

Correa (Stanley’s\r\n_Vasco da Gama_) says that the ships, or some of them, in Vasco da\r\nGama’s second voyage were armed with six heavy guns below, four smaller\r\nguns and four falconets on deck, and several swivel guns. The caravels,\r\nthough only manned by thirty men, carried four heavy guns below, six\r\nfalconets and twelve swivel guns.\r\n\r\n[411] Note by Sir Clements R. Markham.\r\n\r\n[412] D. Diogo Ortiz de Vilhegas was a native of Calçadinha, in Leon,\r\nand came to Portugal as father-confessor and spiritual director of that\r\n“excellent lady”, D. Joanna. King Manuel held him in high respect,\r\nand appointed him Bishop of Tangier in 1491. Jointly with Masters\r\nRodriguez, the physician, and Jose Vizinho, he is responsible for\r\nreporting adversely on the bold projects of Columbus. In 1500, he was\r\ntransferred to the See of Ceuta, and, in 1505, to that of Vizeu. He\r\nnever resided in his African dioceses. When Gama took leave of the King\r\nat Montemór ó novo, Vilhegas is said to have celebrated Mass. He died\r\nin 1519 at Almeirim.—(Paiva Manso, _Historia Ecclesiastica_, Lisbon,\r\n1872, I, pp. 40, 47, 62.)\r\n\r\n[413] Pero de Covilhão and Affonso de Paiva were despatched from\r\nSantarem in 1487 to spy out the countries of the east. Covilhão, in\r\nthe course of his extensive travels, visited Hormuz, Calecut, and\r\nthe east coast of Africa as far as Sofala. He ultimately reached the\r\ncourt of Prester John, and was never again allowed to leave it. These\r\ntravellers, too, received a map and instructions from D. Diogo de\r\nVilhegas. The best account of Covilhão’s adventures is that furnished\r\nby Alvarez, c. 103 (see Lord Stanley’s translation, published by the\r\nHakluyt Society).\r\n\r\n[414] Lucas Marcos visited Rome and Lisbon. The information furnished\r\nby him included a vocabulary.—(Barros, _Da Asia_, _Dec. I_, l. iii, c. 5.)\r\n\r\n[415] Abraham ben Samuel Zacuto was professor of astronomy and\r\nmathematics in the University of Salamanca when King John II called\r\nhim to Portugal in 1492, and appointed him Astronomer Royal. He is\r\nthe author of _Ephemerides_, originally written in Hebrew, a Latin\r\ntranslation of which, by José Vizinho, one of his pupils, was first\r\nprinted in 1496—on the eve of Vasco da Gama’s departure—although there\r\ncan be no doubt that these useful tables previously circulated in MS.\r\nJosé Vizinho is perhaps identical with the physician José whom King\r\nJohn had charged, jointly with Master Rodrigo, to prepare tables of\r\nthe declination of the sun, which would enable navigators to determine\r\ntheir latitude after they had lost sight of the Pole star. Rudolf Wolf\r\n(_Geschichte der Astronomie_, p. 97) credits Regiomontanus with having\r\nproduced the first set of “practical” tables for the use of mariners.\r\nHe does not even once mention Zacuto in his history, and states that\r\nthe tables of the great German astronomer were those made use of by\r\nDias and Vasco da Gama. As the _Ephemerides_ of Regiomontanus were\r\nprinted in 1474, they naturally became more widely known than those of\r\nZacuto, which only circulated in MS., and they were, perhaps, brought\r\nto Portugal by Martin Behaim. It cannot, however, be doubted that the\r\ntables which Vasco da Gama took with him were those of Zacuto.\r\n\r\nFor the contents of the first printed edition of Zacuto’s _Almanach\r\nPerpetuum_, see Antonio Ribeiro dos Santos in _Memorias de Litteratura\r\nPortugueza_, 2 edição, VIII, p. 46; for later reprints of the Tables of\r\nthe Declination of the Sun, see Luciano Cordeira in the _Boletim_ of\r\nthe Lisbon Geographical Society, 1883, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[416] See Hellmann, in _Zeitschrift für Erdkunde_, 1897. The _Roteiros_\r\nof João de Castro, containing these observations, were published at\r\nLisbon, 1833 and 1882.\r\n\r\n[417] The description of this proposed series is of historical interest\r\n(see _Alguns documentos_, 1892, p. 516).\r\n\r\n[418] See Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 73 and 144. The “Sphere” was\r\na device bestowed upon D. Manuel by King João II. A coin called an\r\n“Esphera de Ouro” was coined in Portuguese India. M.B. Lopez Fernandes\r\n(_Memoria das moedas_, Lisbon, 1856, p. 121) had such a coin in his\r\npossession. It had the device on the face, and a royal crown with the\r\nword MEA on the obverse. Manuel de Faria (_Noticias de Portugal_, Disc.\r\nIV, § 31) thinks that MEA stands for “Mine”, meaning that the whole\r\nsphere was Manuel’s; but Fernandes is inclined to think that it stands\r\nfor MEIA, that is, “Half”. The coin in his collection had an intrinsic\r\nvalue of about six shillings.\r\n\r\nThe Pelican was the device of King João II. It may have been on the\r\npadrãos erected by Dias, but has not been discovered on those of Cão.\r\n\r\n[419] See Texeira de Aragão (_Boletim_, VI, 1886, p. 562).\r\n\r\n[420] See Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 38, 73, 94, 96.\r\n\r\n[421] According to J. de Escalante de Mendoso (1575), quoted by\r\nD’Albertis, _loc. cit._, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[422] In quoting authorities I refer to the following editions:—João\r\nde Barros, _Da Asia_, Lisbon, 1788; Castanheda, _Historia da India_,\r\nLisbon, 1833; Manuel de Faria y Sousa, _Asia Portuguesa_, Lisbon, 1666;\r\nGaspar Correa, _Lendas da India_, Lisbon, 1858-64; Damião de Goes,\r\n_Chronica do Rei D. Manuel_, 1790.\r\n\r\n[423] If Correa (I, p. 656) can be trusted, he still had a wife at\r\nCochin in 1506. Sernigi (see p. 136) credits him with a wife and\r\nchildren at Calecut.\r\n\r\n[424] Barros, _Dec. I_, iv, c. 1; Goes, I, c. 23; Castanheda, I, c. 2.\r\n\r\n[425] Correa gives a circumstantial account of the embarkation in the\r\nKing’s presence, but the description of the paintings which were to\r\nhave been executed by the King’s order in illustration of the discovery\r\nand “conquest” of India, shows very conclusively that the King was\r\n_not_ there (_Alguns documentos_, p. 516).\r\n\r\n[426] This, without a doubt, is the correct date. The author of our\r\n“Journal”, Barros, Goes, Castanheda, and Faria y Sousa, they all agree\r\nin this. Sernigi gives July 9th; Correa fixes upon March 25th as the\r\nday of departure.\r\n\r\nWe may say, once for all, that the dates given in the “Journal” may\r\nconfidently be accepted as correct, allowing for a few _lapsi calami_\r\n(or errors of the copyist), which can fortunately be rectified in\r\nnearly every instance, as the Author names the day of the week, and\r\noften even the name of the Saint to whom the day is dedicated.\r\n\r\n[427] This date is doubtful. See p. 3, note 3. The wrong date is not\r\nAugust 18th, but August 22nd.\r\n\r\n[428] The variation being about 19° E., according to João de Castro,\r\nthe true course would have been nearly S. by E.\r\n\r\n[429] See p. 4, note 1.\r\n\r\n[430] See Admiralty “Chart showing the tracks of sailing vessels with\r\nauxiliary steam power”; the valuable track-charts by Capt. A. Schück in\r\nthe _Jahresbericht_ of the Hamburg Geographical Society, for 1874; Dr.\r\nG. Schott, “Die Verkehrswege” in _Zeitschrift für Erdkunde_, 1895, with\r\nmaps; the sailing directories of all ages since Duarte Pacheco wrote\r\nhis _Esmeraldo_ in 1505.\r\n\r\n[431] According to Barros, Bartholemeu Dias kept in his company until\r\nhe took the direction of Mina.\r\n\r\n[432] See, for instance, _The Voyage of François Leguat_, by Capt.\r\nPasfield Oliver (Hakluyt Society, 1891), i, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[433] Modern sailing vessels do much better. The passage from São\r\nThiago to the Cape by way of Trinidad (5,140 miles) is made on an\r\naverage in forty-six days, being a daily run of 125 miles, as compared\r\nwith 54 miles daily, with which we have credited Vasco da Gama (see the\r\nTable at the end of this Appendix).\r\n\r\n[434] One league of Columbus = 4 Italian miles = 3.38 nautical miles.\r\n\r\n[435] In note 3, p. 3, we have assumed a somewhat shorter course, but\r\nafter due consideration we now give the preference to the track laid\r\ndown upon our chart. On an old map of Africa, by H. Moll, a “tract”\r\npassing to the east of Ascension and St. Helena is recommended as “a\r\ngood course of sailing from Great Britain to the East Indies in the\r\nSpring and Fall”. What would Admiral Wharton say to this?\r\n\r\n[436] These islands are distinctly shown on the Cantino Chart, but\r\nunfortunately not named. They are not, however, the _Ys. Tebas_ of\r\nJuan de la Cosa, as is supposed by the Editor of Spruner’s _Historical\r\nAtlas_, for the chart of the Spanish pilot which contains this name\r\nwas completed before Cabral’s return. If we can credit a statement of\r\nCorrea (Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 825), who quotes Gaspar da Gama\r\nas his authority, Cabral also discovered Tristão da Cunha. He certainly\r\nmust have been very near these islands when several of his vessels\r\nfoundered.\r\n\r\n[437] King Manuel, in his letter of 1505, to King Ferdinand of Castile\r\n(“Centenario do descobrimento da America”, Lisbon, 1892), says that\r\nJoão da Nova sailed to the Terra de Santa Cruz (Brazil), and thence to\r\nthe Cape. He does not mention Ascension (Conceiçao). This, however, is\r\nnot conclusive, for Kings, unlike Popes, are not infallible. Barros,\r\nGoes, and Galvão are our authorities for the discovery of the island of\r\nConcepçao in 8° S.\r\n\r\n[438] There is no doubt that the island referred to by Thome Lopes (see\r\nRamusio) as being 330 leagues from the Ilha dos Papagaios (Brazil), 775\r\nleagues from the Ilha da Boa Vista (Cape Verdes), and 850 leagues from\r\nthe Cape, is the island now known as Trinidad. This island, on early\r\nPortuguese charts, is called Ascenção menor.\r\n\r\n[439] If the distance given by Giovanni da Empoli, who writes as\r\nan eye-witness, can be trusted, this must be the Ascenção menor\r\n(Trinidad), and not the island discovered by João da Nova, which is\r\nonly 400 leagues from Cape Verde.\r\n\r\n[440] On Canerio’s chart St. Helena’s Bay is placed 32° 30´ S., the\r\ntrue latitude being 32° 40´ S. Cantino, whose _outline_ is far more\r\ncorrect places the Bay in 31° S.\r\n\r\n[441] See Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, p. 48. Compare Introduction, p.\r\nxviii.\r\n\r\n[442] See Stanley’s _Vasco da Gama_, pp. 62, 67, 270.\r\n\r\n[443] _The History of the Portuguese during the Reign of Emmanuel_\r\nLondon, 1752, 1, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[444] _Roteiro_, first edition, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[445] For a discussion of these sites, see p. 18, _note_.\r\n\r\n[446] _Africa Pilot_, iii, p. 241.\r\n\r\n[447] Vasco da Gama thus took 24 days to cross from Melinde to India.\r\nCabral, João da Nova, Estevão da Gama and Affonso de Albuquerque\r\neffected this passage in from 15 to 18 days. They crossed in August,\r\nwhen the S.-W. monsoon blows freshly.\r\n\r\n[448] _The Discoveries of the World_ (Hakluyt Society), p. 93.\r\n\r\n[449] These “Flats” are a submerged coral reef lying between 12° 30´\r\nand 13° 40´ N. The native name is Maniyal Par.\r\n\r\n[450] According to the author of Add. MS. 20901 (British Museum),\r\nVasco da Gama “cast anchor in front of the most noble and rich city of\r\nCalecut on May 22”. The date of this MS. is about 1516.\r\n\r\n[451] On page 80, note 2, we have identified the island upon which\r\nthis padrão was placed with Pigeon Island, 14° 1´, on the ground of\r\nits answering better to the description given by the author of the\r\n_Roteiro_; but we see reasons for accepting the general opinion that\r\none of the islands off Mulpy (perhaps Coco Nut Island) must be meant,\r\nalthough none of these islets is more than a mile from the coast,\r\ninstead of two leagues. Barros (Dec. 1, l. iv, c. ii.) locates the\r\nIlhéos de Santa Maria between Bacanor and Baticala.\r\n\r\n[452] Cabral, on his homeward voyage in 1501, reached Lisbon from Cape\r\nVerde in twenty days, but Juan Sebastian del Cano, in the _Victoria_,\r\ntook fifty-seven days to reach San Lucar from the Cape Verde Islands.\r\n\r\n[453] In converting legoas into nautical miles we have assumed 100\r\nlegoas to be the equivalent of 338 miles. See _League_ in Index and\r\nGlossary.\r\n\r\n[454] Or thirty miles, if we exclude the five days wasted in a vain\r\neffort to stem the Agulhas current (see p. 15).\r\n\r\n[455] No account is taken of the four days lost in an attempt to sail\r\nnorth (see p. 28).\r\n\r\n[456] This includes a delay of fifteen (?five) days when burning the\r\n_S. Raphael_.\r\n\r\n[457] Charts on a larger scale, but of a later date, are available,\r\nand enable us to trace the physical features of the coast, but their\r\nnomenclature is not always that of the original discoverers. Nor are\r\nwe so fortunate as to possess such full descriptions of the coast as\r\nare to be found in the “Africa Pilot”, for the _Esmeraldo de Situ\r\nOrbis_ (1505) of the famous Duarte Pacheco Pereira stops short at the\r\nRio de Infante; whilst works such as Linschoten’s _Itinerarium ofte\r\nSchipvaert_, belong either to a much later epoch, or are of too general\r\na nature to prove of use when attempting to identify the more obscure\r\nplace-names. I think it was Admiral Ignacio da Costa Quintella, the\r\nauthor of the _Annaes da marinha Portugueza_, who regretted that the\r\ntask of writing the history of Portuguese exploration should have\r\ndevolved almost exclusively upon landsmen, who neglected to give\r\nsatisfactory accounts of the routes followed by the early navigators.\r\nThis regret we fully share.\r\n\r\n[458] See, for instance, A. Mori, in _Atti IIº Congresso Geogr.\r\nItaliana_, Rome, 1895, who describes maps by him in a “Ptolemy” in the\r\nBiblioteca Nazionale at Florence.\r\n\r\n[459] The late Dr. Kohl published a facsimile of this map in the\r\n_Zeitschrift für Erdkunde_, I, 1856, but it is not very accurate.\r\nThat portion of the map which lies between the Guinea islands and\r\nDias’s furthest accompanies my Paper on “Cão, Dias and Behaim”, in the\r\n_Geographical Journal_.\r\n\r\n[460] A legend (near the southern tropic and on the meridian of Lisbon)\r\nrefers to Santa Cruz as “ysla descubierta por portugal”.\r\n\r\n[461] There are flags at Abaran, c. etiopico and quinonico.\r\n\r\n[462] A fine facsimile of this map was published at Madrid, in 1892, by\r\nAntonio Cánovas Vallego and Prof. Traynor, together with a biographical\r\nsketch of Juan de la Cosa by Antonio Vasáno.\r\n\r\n[463] A.

Bittner, Vienna, 1897, with thirty maps by Dr. Tomaschek.\r\n\r\n[468] Even Ptolemy seems to have been in possession of some of these\r\nIndian sailing charts, and Dr. Tomaschek suggests that the monstrous\r\nsize of his Taprobana, or Ceylon, is due to his having mistaken the\r\nhorizontal lines crossing these charts for parallels drawn at intervals\r\nof a degree.\r\n\r\n[469] Africa to the north of Mozambique measures 28° across on\r\nCanerio’s chart, and 25° on Cantino’s, the actual breadth being 26°.\r\n\r\n[470] _Le Portulan de Nicolas de Canerio_ (Bulletin de la Soc. de\r\nGéogr. de Lyon, 1890).\r\n\r\n[471] _Geographie du Moyen Age_, ii, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[472] In Nordenskiöld’s _Atlas_ will be found facsimiles of these maps.\r\n\r\n[473] Instead of a full translation of the two documents on this\r\nsubject, which are printed as an appendix to the original edition of\r\nthe _Roteiro_, we have given abstracts of all the available documents\r\nbearing upon it. Most of these will be found _in extenso_ in Teixeira\r\nde Aragão’s _Vasco da Gama e a Vidigueira_ (Boletim, Lisbon Geogr.\r\nSoc., 1886, pp. 541-702); Luciano Cordeiro’s _De come e quando foi\r\nfeito Conde Vasco da Gama_ (Boletim, 1892, pp. 257-303); and Cordeiro’s\r\n_O Premio da Descoberta_, Lisbon, 1897.\r\n\r\n[474] The original document bestowing this title is not available, but\r\nthe King makes use of it in his Order of Nov. 19th, 1501.\r\n\r\n[475] Compare Document 18 at end of this Appendix.\r\n\r\n[476] See also Documents 10 and 11.\r\n\r\n[477] Peragallo, _Carta de El-Rei D.

The highest incomes were enjoyed\r\nby the Duke of Coimbra (16,000 cruz.), the Duke of Bragança (16,000\r\ncruz.), the Bishop of Evora (12,000 cruz.), the Marquis of Villa Real\r\nand the Archbishop of Lisbon (10,000 cruz. each).\r\n\r\n[479] Cordeiro, _Boletim_, 1892, p. 285.\r\n\r\n[480] Quoted by teixeira de Aragão, p. 572, from a document in the\r\nTorre do Tombo.\r\n\r\n[481] teixeira de Aragão, p. 573.\r\n\r\n[482] This document was first printed as an Appendix to the second\r\nedition of the _Roteiro_, and has since been published as an Appendix\r\nto Lord Stanley of Alderley’s _Vasco da Gama_, and in _Alguns\r\nDocumentos_, p. 127. Its provisions were confirmed in favour of D.\r\nFrancisco da Gama by King John III, May 4th, 1526 (Cordeiro, _O Premio\r\nda Descoberta_, pp. 48-55.)\r\n\r\n[483] In 1434 (not 1433) Gil Eanes doubled Cape Bojador.\r\n\r\n[484] In 1482 Diogo Cão discovered the Congo. We ought evidently to\r\nread 1488, for the Congo is only 1,240 leagues from Lisbon, whilst the\r\n1,885 leagues actually carry us to the Rio do Infante. The name is thus\r\nspelt in this document as if the river had been named in honour of\r\nPrince Henry, and not after João Infante, the companion of Dias.\r\n\r\n[485] Published _in extenso_ in the 2nd edition of the _Roteiro_, p.\r\n175.\r\n\r\n[486] Departure from Lisbon, February 10, 1502; return, September 1,\r\n1503.\r\n\r\n[487] About _£_900. The King had this gold converted into a “custodia”,\r\nwhich he presented to the church of Belem.\r\n\r\n[488] Cordeiro, Boletim, 1892, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[489] Teixeira de Aragão, p. 675.\r\n\r\n[490] Leonardo da Chá Maser calls him “discreet and experienced,\r\nalthough quite illiterate” (see Peragallo, _Carta de El-Rei D. Manuel_,\r\nLisbon, 1892, p. 89).\r\n\r\n[491] This Gama was the third son of the first Vasco, and consequently\r\nan uncle of the Admiral.

The Portuguese\r\n    pilots generally assumed 17½ of these legoas to be equal to 1°;\r\n    and had they known the real size of the earth the league would have\r\n    been 6,350 m., an error of only 1.27 per cent. in the estimate of the\r\n    size of the earth as determined by observation for latitude taken at\r\n    sea.\r\n\r\n    There can hardly be a doubt that the Italian mile was the\r\n    same as the old Roman mile, and had a length of 1,480 m.\r\n    Consequently, 4.236 of these miles were equal to a legoa, and\r\n    when Sernigi (see p. 124) reckons 4¼ of these miles to a\r\n    legoa he is very near the truth. On the Cantino chart 75 Italian\r\n    miles are = 1° = 17.5 Portuguese legoas, and if we accept this\r\n    estimate the legoa would be = 4.29 Italian miles. The Portuguese\r\n    pilots at the Conference of Badajoz (1525), maintained, however,\r\n    that 1 legoa = 4 Italian miles. As to Prof. Wagner’s “Portulano\r\n    mile” (_Report of Sixth International Geographical Congress_,\r\n    p. 698) of only 1,265 m., its shortness is obviously due to the\r\n    very common over-estimate of distances, even when there is no\r\n    mileage charge as in the case of London cabmen.\r\n\r\n  +Leal, J. da Silva Mendes+, quoted, 95\r\n\r\n  +Leiria+ (39° 42´ N., 8° 50´ W.), 159\r\n\r\n  +Lelewel, Joachim+, 211\r\n\r\n  +Leguat, F.+, quoted, 6\r\n\r\n  +Lemos, Gaspar de+, 205\r\n\r\n  +Leonardo+ of Camões, 178\r\n\r\n  +Linen cloth+, 18\r\n\r\n  +Lindsay, W.
