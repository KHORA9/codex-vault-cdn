TURNER\r\nMY WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn republishing these essays in collected form, it has seemed best to\r\nissue them as they were originally printed, with the exception of a few\r\nslight corrections of slips in the text and with the omission of\r\noccasional duplication of language in the different essays. A\r\nconsiderable part of whatever value they may possess arises from the\r\nfact that they are commentaries in different periods on the central\r\ntheme of the influence of the frontier in American history. Consequently\r\nthey may have some historical significance as contemporaneous attempts\r\nof a student of American history, at successive transitions in our\r\ndevelopment during the past quarter century to interpret the relations\r\nof the present to the past. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the\r\nvarious societies and periodicals which have given permission to reprint\r\nthe essays.\r\n\r\nVarious essays dealing with the connection of diplomatic history and the\r\nfrontier and others stressing the significance of the section, or\r\ngeographic province, in American history, are not included in the\r\npresent collection. Neither the French nor the Spanish frontier is\r\nwithin the scope of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe future alone can disclose how far these interpretations are correct\r\nfor the age of colonization which came gradually to an end with the\r\ndisappearance of the frontier and free land. It alone can reveal how\r\nmuch of the courageous, creative American spirit, and how large a part\r\nof the historic American ideals are to be carried over into that new age\r\nwhich is replacing the era of free lands and of measurable isolation by\r\nconsolidated and complex industrial development and by increasing\r\nresemblances and connections between the New World and the Old.\r\n\r\nBut the larger part of what has been distinctive and valuable in\r\nAmerica's contribution to the history of the human spirit has been due\r\nto this nation's peculiar experience in extending its type of frontier\r\ninto new regions; and in creating peaceful societies with new ideals in\r\nthe successive vast and differing geographic provinces which together\r\nmake up the United States. Directly or indirectly these experiences\r\nshaped the life of the Eastern as well as the Western States, and even\r\nreacted upon the Old World and influenced the direction of its thought\r\nand its progress. This experience has been fundamental in the economic,\r\npolitical and social characteristics of the American people and in their\r\nconceptions of their destiny.\r\n\r\nWriting at the close of 1796, the French minister to the United States,\r\nM. Adet, reported to his government that Jefferson could not be relied\r\non to be devoted to French interests, and he added: \"Jefferson, I say,\r\nis American, and by that name, he cannot be sincerely our friend. An\r\nAmerican is the born enemy of all European peoples.\" Obviously erroneous\r\nas are these words, there was an element of truth in them. If we would\r\nunderstand this element of truth, we must study the transforming\r\ninfluence of the American wilderness, remote from Europe, and by its\r\nresources and its free opportunities affording the conditions under\r\nwhich a new people, with new social and political types and ideals,\r\ncould arise to play its own part in the world, and to influence Europe.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK J.

In the discussion of its extent, its\r\nwestward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place\r\nin the census reports.\" This brief official statement marks the closing\r\nof a great historic movement. Up to our own day American history has\r\nbeen in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great\r\nWest. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession,\r\nand the advance of American settlement westward, explain American\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nBehind institutions, behind constitutional forms and modifications, lie\r\nthe vital forces that call these organs into life and shape them to meet\r\nchanging conditions. The peculiarity of American institutions is, the\r\nfact that they have been compelled to adapt themselves to the changes of\r\nan expanding people--to the changes involved in crossing a continent, in\r\nwinning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this progress\r\nout of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier\r\ninto the complexity of city life. Said Calhoun in 1817, \"We are great,\r\nand rapidly--I was about to say fearfully--growing!\"[2:1] So saying, he\r\ntouched the distinguishing feature of American life. All peoples show\r\ndevelopment; the germ theory of politics has been sufficiently\r\nemphasized. In the case of most nations, however, the development has\r\noccurred in a limited area; and if the nation has expanded, it has met\r\nother growing peoples whom it has conquered. But in the case of the\r\nUnited States we have a different phenomenon. Limiting our attention to\r\nthe Atlantic coast, we have the familiar phenomenon of the evolution of\r\ninstitutions in a limited area, such as the rise of representative\r\ngovernment; the differentiation of simple colonial governments into\r\ncomplex organs; the progress from primitive industrial society, without\r\ndivision of labor, up to manufacturing civilization. But we have in\r\naddition to this a recurrence of the process of evolution in each\r\nwestern area reached in the process of expansion. Thus American\r\ndevelopment has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a\r\nreturn to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line,\r\nand a new development for that area. American social development has\r\nbeen continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial\r\nrebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with\r\nits new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of\r\nprimitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The\r\ntrue point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic\r\ncoast, it is the Great West. Even the slavery struggle, which is made so\r\nexclusive an object of attention by writers like Professor von Holst,\r\noccupies its important place in American history because of its relation\r\nto westward expansion.\r\n\r\nIn this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave--the meeting\r\npoint between savagery and civilization. Much has been written about the\r\nfrontier from the point of view of border warfare and the chase, but as\r\na field for the serious study of the economist and the historian it has\r\nbeen neglected.\r\n\r\nThe American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European\r\nfrontier--a fortified boundary line running through dense populations.\r\nThe most significant thing about the American frontier is, that it lies\r\nat the hither edge of free land. In the census reports it is treated as\r\nthe margin of that settlement which has a density of two or more to the\r\nsquare mile. The term is an elastic one, and for our purposes does not\r\nneed sharp definition. We shall consider the whole frontier belt,\r\nincluding the Indian country and the outer margin of the \"settled area\"\r\nof the census reports. This paper will make no attempt to treat the\r\nsubject exhaustively; its aim is simply to call attention to the\r\nfrontier as a fertile field for investigation, and to suggest some of\r\nthe problems which arise in connection with it.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of America we have to observe how European life\r\nentered the continent, and how America modified and developed that life\r\nand reacted on Europe. Our early history is the study of European germs\r\ndeveloping in an American environment. Too exclusive attention has been\r\npaid by institutional students to the Germanic origins, too little to\r\nthe American factors. The frontier is the line of most rapid and\r\neffective Americanization. The wilderness masters the colonist. It finds\r\nhim a European in dress, industries, tools, modes of travel, and\r\nthought. It takes him from the railroad car and puts him in the birch\r\ncanoe. It strips off the garments of civilization and arrays him in the\r\nhunting shirt and the moccasin. It puts him in the log cabin of the\r\nCherokee and Iroquois and runs an Indian palisade around him. Before\r\nlong he has gone to planting Indian corn and plowing with a sharp stick;\r\nhe shouts the war cry and takes the scalp in orthodox Indian fashion. In\r\nshort, at the frontier the environment is at first too strong for the\r\nman. He must accept the conditions which it furnishes, or perish, and so\r\nhe fits himself into the Indian clearings and follows the Indian trails.\r\nLittle by little he transforms the wilderness, but the outcome is not\r\nthe old Europe, not simply the development of Germanic germs, any more\r\nthan the first phenomenon was a case of reversion to the Germanic mark.\r\nThe fact is, that here is a new product that is American. At first, the\r\nfrontier was the Atlantic coast. It was the frontier of Europe in a very\r\nreal sense. Moving westward, the frontier became more and more American.\r\nAs successive terminal moraines result from successive glaciations, so\r\neach frontier leaves its traces behind it, and when it becomes a settled\r\narea the region still partakes of the frontier characteristics. Thus the\r\nadvance of the frontier has meant a steady movement away from the\r\ninfluence of Europe, a steady growth of independence on American lines.\r\nAnd to study this advance, the men who grew up under these conditions,\r\nand the political, economic, and social results of it, is to study the\r\nreally American part of our history.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the seventeenth century the frontier was advanced up\r\nthe Atlantic river courses, just beyond the \"fall line,\" and the\r\ntidewater region became the settled area. In the first half of the\r\neighteenth century another advance occurred. Traders followed the\r\nDelaware and Shawnese Indians to the Ohio as early as the end of the\r\nfirst quarter of the century.[5:1] Gov. Spotswood, of Virginia, made an\r\nexpedition in 1714 across the Blue Ridge. The end of the first quarter\r\nof the century saw the advance of the Scotch-Irish and the Palatine\r\nGermans up the Shenandoah Valley into the western part of Virginia, and\r\nalong the Piedmont region of the Carolinas.[5:2] The Germans in New York\r\npushed the frontier of settlement up the Mohawk to German Flats.[5:3] In\r\nPennsylvania the town of Bedford indicates the line of settlement.\r\nSettlements soon began on the New River, or the Great Kanawha, and on\r\nthe sources of the Yadkin and French Broad.[5:4] The King attempted to\r\narrest the advance by his proclamation of 1763,[5:5] forbidding\r\nsettlements beyond the sources of the rivers flowing into the Atlantic;\r\nbut in vain. In the period of the Revolution the frontier crossed the\r\nAlleghanies into Kentucky and Tennessee, and the upper waters of the\r\nOhio were settled.[5:6] When the first census was taken in 1790, the\r\ncontinuous settled area was bounded by a line which ran near the coast\r\nof Maine, and included New England except a portion of Vermont and New\r\nHampshire, New York along the Hudson and up the Mohawk about\r\nSchenectady, eastern and southern Pennsylvania, Virginia well across the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and the Carolinas and eastern Georgia.[6:1] Beyond\r\nthis region of continuous settlement were the small settled areas of\r\nKentucky and Tennessee, and the Ohio, with the mountains intervening\r\nbetween them and the Atlantic area, thus giving a new and important\r\ncharacter to the frontier. The isolation of the region increased its\r\npeculiarly American tendencies, and the need of transportation\r\nfacilities to connect it with the East called out important schemes of\r\ninternal improvement, which will be noted farther on. The \"West,\" as a\r\nself-conscious section, began to evolve.\r\n\r\nFrom decade to decade distinct advances of the frontier occurred. By the\r\ncensus of 1820[6:2] the settled area included Ohio, southern Indiana and\r\nIllinois, southeastern Missouri, and about one-half of Louisiana. This\r\nsettled area had surrounded Indian areas, and the management of these\r\ntribes became an object of political concern. The frontier region of the\r\ntime lay along the Great Lakes, where Astor's American Fur Company\r\noperated in the Indian trade,[6:3] and beyond the Mississippi, where\r\nIndian traders extended their activity even to the Rocky Mountains;\r\nFlorida also furnished frontier conditions. The Mississippi River region\r\nwas the scene of typical frontier settlements.[7:1]\r\n\r\nThe rising steam navigation[7:2] on western waters, the opening of the\r\nErie Canal, and the westward extension of cotton[7:3] culture added five\r\nfrontier states to the Union in this period. Grund, writing in 1836,\r\ndeclares: \"It appears then that the universal disposition of Americans\r\nto emigrate to the western wilderness, in order to enlarge their\r\ndominion over inanimate nature, is the actual result of an expansive\r\npower which is inherent in them, and which by continually agitating all\r\nclasses of society is constantly throwing a large portion of the whole\r\npopulation on the extreme confines of the State, in order to gain space\r\nfor its development. Hardly is a new State or Territory formed before\r\nthe same principle manifests itself again and gives rise to a further\r\nemigration; and so is it destined to go on until a physical barrier must\r\nfinally obstruct its progress.\"[7:4]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this century the line indicated by the present eastern\r\nboundary of Indian Territory, Nebraska, and Kansas marked the frontier\r\nof the Indian country.[8:1] Minnesota and Wisconsin still exhibited\r\nfrontier conditions,[8:2] but the distinctive frontier of the period is\r\nfound in California, where the gold discoveries had sent a sudden tide\r\nof adventurous miners, and in Oregon, and the settlements in Utah.[8:3]\r\nAs the frontier had leaped over the Alleghanies, so now it skipped the\r\nGreat Plains and the Rocky Mountains; and in the same way that the\r\nadvance of the frontiersmen beyond the Alleghanies had caused the rise\r\nof important questions of transportation and internal improvement, so\r\nnow the settlers beyond the Rocky Mountains needed means of\r\ncommunication with the East, and in the furnishing of these arose the\r\nsettlement of the Great Plains and the development of still another kind\r\nof frontier life. Railroads, fostered by land grants, sent an\r\nincreasing tide of immigrants into the Far West. The United States Army\r\nfought a series of Indian wars in Minnesota, Dakota, and the Indian\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nBy 1880 the settled area had been pushed into northern Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, and Minnesota, along Dakota rivers, and in the Black Hills\r\nregion, and was ascending the rivers of Kansas and Nebraska. The\r\ndevelopment of mines in Colorado had drawn isolated frontier settlements\r\ninto that region, and Montana and Idaho were receiving settlers. The\r\nfrontier was found in these mining camps and the ranches of the Great\r\nPlains. The superintendent of the census for 1890 reports, as previously\r\nstated, that the settlements of the West lie so scattered over the\r\nregion that there can no longer be said to be a frontier line.\r\n\r\nIn these successive frontiers we find natural boundary lines which have\r\nserved to mark and to affect the characteristics of the frontiers,\r\nnamely: the \"fall line;\" the Alleghany Mountains; the Mississippi; the\r\nMissouri where its direction approximates north and south; the line of\r\nthe arid lands, approximately the ninety-ninth meridian; and the Rocky\r\nMountains. The fall line marked the frontier of the seventeenth century;\r\nthe Alleghanies that of the eighteenth; the Mississippi that of the\r\nfirst quarter of the nineteenth; the Missouri that of the middle of this\r\ncentury (omitting the California movement); and the belt of the Rocky\r\nMountains and the arid tract, the present frontier. Each was won by a\r\nseries of Indian wars.\r\n\r\nAt the Atlantic frontier one can study the germs of processes repeated\r\nat each successive frontier. We have the complex European life sharply\r\nprecipitated by the wilderness into the simplicity of primitive\r\nconditions. The first frontier had to meet its Indian question, its\r\nquestion of the disposition of the public domain, of the means of\r\nintercourse with older settlements, of the extension of political\r\norganization, of religious and educational activity. And the settlement\r\nof these and similar questions for one frontier served as a guide for\r\nthe next. The American student needs not to go to the \"prim little\r\ntownships of Sleswick\" for illustrations of the law of continuity and\r\ndevelopment. For example, he may study the origin of our land policies\r\nin the colonial land policy; he may see how the system grew by adapting\r\nthe statutes to the customs of the successive frontiers.[10:1] He may\r\nsee how the mining experience in the lead regions of Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, and Iowa was applied to the mining laws of the Sierras,[10:2]\r\nand how our Indian policy has been a series of experimentations on\r\nsuccessive frontiers. Each tier of new States has found in the older\r\nones material for its constitutions.[10:3] Each frontier has made\r\nsimilar contributions to American character, as will be discussed\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nBut with all these similarities there are essential differences due to\r\nthe place element and the time element. It is evident that the farming\r\nfrontier of the Mississippi Valley presents different conditions from\r\nthe mining frontier of the Rocky Mountains. The frontier reached by the\r\nPacific Railroad, surveyed into rectangles, guarded by the United States\r\nArmy, and recruited by the daily immigrant ship, moves forward at a\r\nswifter pace and in a different way than the frontier reached by the\r\nbirch canoe or the pack horse. The geologist traces patiently the shores\r\nof ancient seas, maps their areas, and compares the older and the newer.\r\nIt would be a work worth the historian's labors to mark these various\r\nfrontiers and in detail compare one with another. Not only would there\r\nresult a more adequate conception of American development and\r\ncharacteristics, but invaluable additions would be made to the history\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nLoria,[11:1] the Italian economist, has urged the study of colonial life\r\nas an aid in understanding the stages of European development, affirming\r\nthat colonial settlement is for economic science what the mountain is\r\nfor geology, bringing to light primitive stratifications. \"America,\" he\r\nsays, \"has the key to the historical enigma which Europe has sought for\r\ncenturies in vain, and the land which has no history reveals luminously\r\nthe course of universal history.\" There is much truth in this. The\r\nUnited States lies like a huge page in the history of society. Line by\r\nline as we read this continental page from West to East we find the\r\nrecord of social evolution. It begins with the Indian and the hunter; it\r\ngoes on to tell of the disintegration of savagery by the entrance of the\r\ntrader, the pathfinder of civilization; we read the annals of the\r\npastoral stage in ranch life; the exploitation of the soil by the\r\nraising of unrotated crops of corn and wheat in sparsely settled farming\r\ncommunities; the intensive culture of the denser farm settlement; and\r\nfinally the manufacturing organization with city and factory\r\nsystem.[11:2] This page is familiar to the student of census statistics,\r\nbut how little of it has been used by our historians. Particularly in\r\neastern States this page is a palimpsest. What is now a manufacturing\r\nState was in an earlier decade an area of intensive farming. Earlier yet\r\nit had been a wheat area, and still earlier the \"range\" had attracted\r\nthe cattle-herder. Thus Wisconsin, now developing manufacture, is a\r\nState with varied agricultural interests. But earlier it was given over\r\nto almost exclusive grain-raising, like North Dakota at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEach of these areas has had an influence in our economic and political\r\nhistory; the evolution of each into a higher stage has worked political\r\ntransformations. But what constitutional historian has made any adequate\r\nattempt to interpret political facts by the light of these social areas\r\nand changes?[12:1]\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic frontier was compounded of fisherman, fur-trader, miner,\r\ncattle-raiser, and farmer. Excepting the fisherman, each type of\r\nindustry was on the march toward the West, impelled by an irresistible\r\nattraction. Each passed in successive waves across the continent. Stand\r\nat Cumberland Gap and watch the procession of civilization, marching\r\nsingle file--the buffalo following the trail to the salt springs, the\r\nIndian, the fur-trader and hunter, the cattle-raiser, the pioneer\r\nfarmer--and the frontier has passed by. Stand at South Pass in the\r\nRockies a century later and see the same procession with wider intervals\r\nbetween. The unequal rate of advance compels us to distinguish the\r\nfrontier into the trader's frontier, the rancher's frontier, or the\r\nminer's frontier, and the farmer's frontier. When the mines and the cow\r\npens were still near the fall line the traders' pack trains were\r\ntinkling across the Alleghanies, and the French on the Great Lakes were\r\nfortifying their posts, alarmed by the British trader's birch canoe.\r\nWhen the trappers scaled the Rockies, the farmer was still near the\r\nmouth of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nWhy was it that the Indian trader passed so rapidly across the\r\ncontinent? What effects followed from the trader's frontier? The trade\r\nwas coeval with American discovery. The Norsemen, Vespuccius, Verrazani,\r\nHudson, John Smith, all trafficked for furs. The Plymouth pilgrims\r\nsettled in Indian cornfields, and their first return cargo was of beaver\r\nand lumber. The records of the various New England colonies show how\r\nsteadily exploration was carried into the wilderness by this trade. What\r\nis true for New England is, as would be expected, even plainer for the\r\nrest of the colonies. All along the coast from Maine to Georgia the\r\nIndian trade opened up the river courses. Steadily the trader passed\r\nwestward, utilizing the older lines of French trade. The Ohio, the Great\r\nLakes, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Platte, the lines of\r\nwestern advance, were ascended by traders. They found the passes in the\r\nRocky Mountains and guided Lewis and Clark,[13:1] Frémont, and Bidwell.\r\nThe explanation of the rapidity of this advance is connected with the\r\neffects of the trader on the Indian. The trading post left the unarmed\r\ntribes at the mercy of those that had purchased fire-arms--a truth which\r\nthe Iroquois Indians wrote in blood, and so the remote and unvisited\r\ntribes gave eager welcome to the trader. \"The savages,\" wrote La Salle,\r\n\"take better care of us French than of their own children; from us only\r\ncan they get guns and goods.\" This accounts for the trader's power and\r\nthe rapidity of his advance. Thus the disintegrating forces of\r\ncivilization entered the wilderness. Every river valley and Indian trail\r\nbecame a fissure in Indian society, and so that society became\r\nhoneycombed. Long before the pioneer farmer appeared on the scene,\r\nprimitive Indian life had passed away. The farmers met Indians armed\r\nwith guns. The trading frontier, while steadily undermining Indian power\r\nby making the tribes ultimately dependent on the whites, yet, through\r\nits sale of guns, gave to the Indian increased power of resistance to\r\nthe farming frontier. French colonization was dominated by its trading\r\nfrontier; English colonization by its farming frontier. There was an\r\nantagonism between the two frontiers as between the two nations. Said\r\nDuquesne to the Iroquois, \"Are you ignorant of the difference between\r\nthe king of England and the king of France? Go see the forts that our\r\nking has established and you will see that you can still hunt under\r\ntheir very walls. They have been placed for your advantage in places\r\nwhich you frequent. The English, on the contrary, are no sooner in\r\npossession of a place than the game is driven away. The forest falls\r\nbefore them as they advance, and the soil is laid bare so that you can\r\nscarce find the wherewithal to erect a shelter for the night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this opposition of the interests of the trader and\r\nthe farmer, the Indian trade pioneered the way for civilization. The\r\nbuffalo trail became the Indian trail, and this became the trader's\r\n\"trace;\" the trails widened into roads, and the roads into turnpikes,\r\nand these in turn were transformed into railroads. The same origin can\r\nbe shown for the railroads of the South, the Far West, and the Dominion\r\nof Canada.[14:1] The trading posts reached by these trails were on the\r\nsites of Indian villages which had been placed in positions suggested by\r\nnature; and these trading posts, situated so as to command the water\r\nsystems of the country, have grown into such cities as Albany,\r\nPittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Council Bluffs, and Kansas\r\nCity. Thus civilization in America has followed the arteries made by\r\ngeology, pouring an ever richer tide through them, until at last the\r\nslender paths of aboriginal intercourse have been broadened and\r\ninterwoven into the complex mazes of modern commercial lines; the\r\nwilderness has been interpenetrated by lines of civilization growing\r\never more numerous. It is like the steady growth of a complex nervous\r\nsystem for the originally simple, inert continent. If one would\r\nunderstand why we are to-day one nation, rather than a collection of\r\nisolated states, he must study this economic and social consolidation of\r\nthe country. In this progress from savage conditions lie topics for the\r\nevolutionist.[15:1]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Indian frontier as a consolidating agent in our\r\nhistory is important. From the close of the seventeenth century various\r\nintercolonial congresses have been called to treat with Indians and\r\nestablish common measures of defense. Particularism was strongest in\r\ncolonies with no Indian frontier. This frontier stretched along the\r\nwestern border like a cord of union. The Indian was a common danger,\r\ndemanding united action. Most celebrated of these conferences was the\r\nAlbany congress of 1754, called to treat with the Six Nations, and to\r\nconsider plans of union. Even a cursory reading of the plan proposed by\r\nthe congress reveals the importance of the frontier. The powers of the\r\ngeneral council and the officers were, chiefly, the determination of\r\npeace and war with the Indians, the regulation of Indian trade, the\r\npurchase of Indian lands, and the creation and government of new\r\nsettlements as a security against the Indians. It is evident that the\r\nunifying tendencies of the Revolutionary period were facilitated by the\r\nprevious coöperation in the regulation of the frontier. In this\r\nconnection may be mentioned the importance of the frontier, from that\r\nday to this, as a military training school, keeping alive the power of\r\nresistance to aggression, and developing the stalwart and rugged\r\nqualities of the frontiersman.\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible in the limits of this paper to trace the other\r\nfrontiers across the continent. Travelers of the eighteenth century\r\nfound the \"cowpens\" among the canebrakes and peavine pastures of the\r\nSouth, and the \"cow drivers\" took their droves to Charleston,\r\nPhiladelphia, and New York.[16:1] Travelers at the close of the War of\r\n1812 met droves of more than a thousand cattle and swine from the\r\ninterior of Ohio going to Pennsylvania to fatten for the Philadelphia\r\nmarket.[16:2] The ranges of the Great Plains, with ranch and cowboy and\r\nnomadic life, are things of yesterday and of to-day. The experience of\r\nthe Carolina cowpens guided the ranchers of Texas. One element favoring\r\nthe rapid extension of the rancher's frontier is the fact that in a\r\nremote country lacking transportation facilities the product must be in\r\nsmall bulk, or must be able to transport itself, and the cattle raiser\r\ncould easily drive his product to market. The effect of these great\r\nranches on the subsequent agrarian history of the localities in which\r\nthey existed should be studied.\r\n\r\nThe maps of the census reports show an uneven advance of the farmer's\r\nfrontier, with tongues of settlement pushed forward and with\r\nindentations of wilderness. In part this is due to Indian resistance, in\r\npart to the location of river valleys and passes, in part to the unequal\r\nforce of the centers of frontier attraction. Among the important centers\r\nof attraction may be mentioned the following: fertile and favorably\r\nsituated soils, salt springs, mines, and army posts.\r\n\r\nThe frontier army post, serving to protect the settlers from the\r\nIndians, has also acted as a wedge to open the Indian country, and has\r\nbeen a nucleus for settlement.[16:3] In this connection mention should\r\nalso be made of the government military and exploring expeditions in\r\ndetermining the lines of settlement. But all the more important\r\nexpeditions were greatly indebted to the earliest pathmakers, the Indian\r\nguides, the traders and trappers, and the French voyageurs, who were\r\ninevitable parts of governmental expeditions from the days of Lewis and\r\nClark.[17:1] Each expedition was an epitome of the previous factors in\r\nwestern advance.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting monograph, Victor Hehn[17:2] has traced the effect of\r\nsalt upon early European development, and has pointed out how it\r\naffected the lines of settlement and the form of administration. A\r\nsimilar study might be made for the salt springs of the United States.\r\nThe early settlers were tied to the coast by the need of salt, without\r\nwhich they could not preserve their meats or live in comfort. Writing in\r\n1752, Bishop Spangenburg says of a colony for which he was seeking lands\r\nin North Carolina, \"They will require salt & other necessaries which\r\nthey can neither manufacture nor raise. Either they must go to\r\nCharleston, which is 300 miles distant . . . Or else they must go to\r\nBoling's Point in V{a} on a branch of the James & is also 300 miles from\r\nhere. . . Or else they must go down the Roanoke--I know not how many\r\nmiles--where salt is brought up from the Cape Fear.\"[17:3] This may\r\nserve as a typical illustration. An annual pilgrimage to the coast for\r\nsalt thus became essential. Taking flocks or furs and ginseng root, the\r\nearly settlers sent their pack trains after seeding time each year to\r\nthe coast.[17:4] This proved to be an important educational influence,\r\nsince it was almost the only way in which the pioneer learned what was\r\ngoing on in the East. But when discovery was made of the salt springs of\r\nthe Kanawha, and the Holston, and Kentucky, and central New York, the\r\nWest began to be freed from dependence on the coast. It was in part the\r\neffect of finding these salt springs that enabled settlement to cross\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the mountains rose between the pioneer and the seaboard, a\r\nnew order of Americanism arose. The West and the East began to get out\r\nof touch of each other. The settlements from the sea to the mountains\r\nkept connection with the rear and had a certain solidarity. But the\r\nover-mountain men grew more and more independent. The East took a narrow\r\nview of American advance, and nearly lost these men. Kentucky and\r\nTennessee history bears abundant witness to the truth of this statement.\r\nThe East began to try to hedge and limit westward expansion. Though\r\nWebster could declare that there were no Alleghanies in his politics,\r\nyet in politics in general they were a very solid factor.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of the beasts took hunter and trader to the west, the\r\nexploitation of the grasses took the rancher west, and the exploitation\r\nof the virgin soil of the river valleys and prairies attracted the\r\nfarmer. Good soils have been the most continuous attraction to the\r\nfarmer's frontier. The land hunger of the Virginians drew them down the\r\nrivers into Carolina, in early colonial days; the search for soils took\r\nthe Massachusetts men to Pennsylvania and to New York. As the eastern\r\nlands were taken up migration flowed across them to the west. Daniel\r\nBoone, the great backwoodsman, who combined the occupations of hunter,\r\ntrader, cattle-raiser, farmer, and surveyor--learning, probably from the\r\ntraders, of the fertility of the lands of the upper Yadkin, where the\r\ntraders were wont to rest as they took their way to the Indians, left\r\nhis Pennsylvania home with his father, and passed down the Great Valley\r\nroad to that stream. Learning from a trader of the game and rich\r\npastures of Kentucky, he pioneered the way for the farmers to that\r\nregion. Thence he passed to the frontier of Missouri, where his\r\nsettlement was long a landmark on the frontier. Here again he helped to\r\nopen the way for civilization, finding salt licks, and trails, and land.\r\nHis son was among the earliest trappers in the passes of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and his party are said to have been the first to camp on the\r\npresent site of Denver. His grandson, Col. A. J. Boone, of Colorado, was\r\na power among the Indians of the Rocky Mountains, and was appointed an\r\nagent by the government. Kit Carson's mother was a Boone.[19:1] Thus\r\nthis family epitomizes the backwoodsman's advance across the continent.\r\n\r\nThe farmer's advance came in a distinct series of waves. In Peck's New\r\nGuide to the West, published in Boston in 1837, occurs this suggestive\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n     Generally, in all the western settlements, three classes, like\r\n     the waves of the ocean, have rolled one after the other. First\r\n     comes the pioneer, who depends for the subsistence of his\r\n     family chiefly upon the natural growth of vegetation, called\r\n     the \"range,\" and the proceeds of hunting. His implements of\r\n     agriculture are rude, chiefly of his own make, and his efforts\r\n     directed mainly to a crop of corn and a \"truck patch.\" The\r\n     last is a rude garden for growing cabbage, beans, corn for\r\n     roasting ears, cucumbers, and potatoes. A log cabin, and,\r\n     occasionally, a stable and corn-crib, and a field of a dozen\r\n     acres, the timber girdled or \"deadened,\" and fenced, are\r\n     enough for his occupancy. It is quite immaterial whether he\r\n     ever becomes the owner of the soil. He is the occupant for\r\n     the time being, pays no rent, and feels as independent as the\r\n     \"lord of the manor.\" With a horse, cow, and one or two\r\n     breeders of swine, he strikes into the woods with his family,\r\n     and becomes the founder of a new county, or perhaps state. He\r\n     builds his cabin, gathers around him a few other families of\r\n     similar tastes and habits, and occupies till the range is\r\n     somewhat subdued, and hunting a little precarious, or, which\r\n     is more frequently the case, till the neighbors crowd around,\r\n     roads, bridges, and fields annoy him, and he lacks elbow room.\r\n     The preëmption law enables him to dispose of his cabin and\r\n     cornfield to the next class of emigrants; and, to employ his\r\n     own figures, he \"breaks for the high timber,\" \"clears out for\r\n     the New Purchase,\" or migrates to Arkansas or Texas, to work\r\n     the same process over.\r\n\r\n     The next class of emigrants purchase the lands, add field to\r\n     field, clear out the roads, throw rough bridges over the\r\n     streams, put up hewn log houses with glass windows and brick\r\n     or stone chimneys, occasionally plant orchards, build mills,\r\n     school-houses, court-houses, etc., and exhibit the picture and\r\n     forms of plain, frugal, civilized life.\r\n\r\n     Another wave rolls on. The men of capital and enterprise come.\r\n     The settler is ready to sell out and take the advantage of the\r\n     rise in property, push farther into the interior and become,\r\n     himself, a man of capital and enterprise in turn. The small\r\n     village rises to a spacious town or city; substantial edifices\r\n     of brick, extensive fields, orchards, gardens, colleges, and\r\n     churches are seen. Broadcloths, silks, leghorns, crapes, and\r\n     all the refinements, luxuries, elegancies, frivolities, and\r\n     fashions are in vogue. Thus wave after wave is rolling\r\n     westward; the real Eldorado is still farther on.\r\n\r\n     A portion of the two first classes remain stationary amidst\r\n     the general movement, improve their habits and condition, and\r\n     rise in the scale of society.\r\n\r\n     The writer has traveled much amongst the first class, the real\r\n     pioneers. He has lived many years in connection with the\r\n     second grade; and now the third wave is sweeping over large\r\n     districts of Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Migration has\r\n     become almost a habit in the West. Hundreds of men can be\r\n     found, not over 50 years of age, who have settled for the\r\n     fourth, fifth, or sixth time on a new spot. To sell out and\r\n     remove only a few hundred miles makes up a portion of the\r\n     variety of backwoods life and manners.[21:1]\r\n\r\nOmitting those of the pioneer farmers who move from the love of\r\nadventure, the advance of the more steady farmer is easy to understand.\r\nObviously the immigrant was attracted by the cheap lands of the\r\nfrontier, and even the native farmer felt their influence strongly. Year\r\nby year the farmers who lived on soil whose returns were diminished by\r\nunrotated crops were offered the virgin soil of the frontier at nominal\r\nprices. Their growing families demanded more lands, and these were dear.\r\nThe competition of the unexhausted, cheap, and easily tilled prairie\r\nlands compelled the farmer either to go west and continue the exhaustion\r\nof the soil on a new frontier, or to adopt intensive culture. Thus the\r\ncensus of 1890 shows, in the Northwest, many counties in which there is\r\nan absolute or a relative decrease of population. These States have been\r\nsending farmers to advance the frontier on the plains, and have\r\nthemselves begun to turn to intensive farming and to manufacture. A\r\ndecade before this, Ohio had shown the same transition stage. Thus the\r\ndemand for land and the love of wilderness freedom drew the frontier\r\never onward.\r\n\r\nHaving now roughly outlined the various kinds of frontiers, and their\r\nmodes of advance, chiefly from the point of view of the frontier itself,\r\nwe may next inquire what were the influences on the East and on the Old\r\nWorld. A rapid enumeration of some of the more noteworthy effects is all\r\nthat I have time for.\r\n\r\nFirst, we note that the frontier promoted the formation of a composite\r\nnationality for the American people. The coast was preponderantly\r\nEnglish, but the later tides of continental immigration flowed across to\r\nthe free lands. This was the case from the early colonial days. The\r\nScotch-Irish and the Palatine Germans, or \"Pennsylvania Dutch,\"\r\nfurnished the dominant element in the stock of the colonial frontier.\r\nWith these peoples were also the freed indented servants, or\r\nredemptioners, who at the expiration of their time of service passed to\r\nthe frontier. Governor Spotswood of Virginia writes in 1717, \"The\r\ninhabitants of our frontiers are composed generally of such as have been\r\ntransported hither as servants, and, being out of their time, settle\r\nthemselves where land is to be taken up and that will produce the\r\nnecessarys of life with little labour.\"[22:1] Very generally these\r\nredemptioners were of non-English stock. In the crucible of the\r\nfrontier the immigrants were Americanized, liberated, and fused into a\r\nmixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics. The\r\nprocess has gone on from the early days to our own. Burke and other\r\nwriters in the middle of the eighteenth century believed that\r\nPennsylvania[23:1] was \"threatened with the danger of being wholly\r\nforeign in language, manners, and perhaps even inclinations.\" The German\r\nand Scotch-Irish elements in the frontier of the South were only less\r\ngreat. In the middle of the present century the German element in\r\nWisconsin was already so considerable that leading publicists looked to\r\nthe creation of a German state out of the commonwealth by concentrating\r\ntheir colonization.[23:2] Such examples teach us to beware of\r\nmisinterpreting the fact that there is a common English speech in\r\nAmerica into a belief that the stock is also English.\r\n\r\nIn another way the advance of the frontier decreased our dependence on\r\nEngland. The coast, particularly of the South, lacked diversified\r\nindustries, and was dependent on England for the bulk of its supplies.\r\nIn the South there was even a dependence on the Northern colonies for\r\narticles of food. Governor Glenn, of South Carolina, writes in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century: \"Our trade with New York and\r\nPhiladelphia was of this sort, draining us of all the little money and\r\nbills we could gather from other places for their bread, flour, beer,\r\nhams, bacon, and other things of their produce, all which, except beer,\r\nour new townships begin to supply us with, which are settled with very\r\nindustrious and thriving Germans. This no doubt diminishes the number of\r\nshipping and the appearance of our trade, but it is far from being a\r\ndetriment to us.\"[23:3]\r\n\r\nBefore long the frontier created a demand for merchants. As it\r\nretreated from the coast it became less and less possible for England to\r\nbring her supplies directly to the consumer's wharfs, and carry away\r\nstaple crops, and staple crops began to give way to diversified\r\nagriculture for a time. The effect of this phase of the frontier action\r\nupon the northern section is perceived when we realize how the advance\r\nof the frontier aroused seaboard cities like Boston, New York, and\r\nBaltimore, to engage in rivalry for what Washington called \"the\r\nextensive and valuable trade of a rising empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislation which most developed the powers of the national\r\ngovernment, and played the largest part in its activity, was conditioned\r\non the frontier. Writers have discussed the subjects of tariff, land,\r\nand internal improvement, as subsidiary to the slavery question. But\r\nwhen American history comes to be rightly viewed it will be seen that\r\nthe slavery question is an incident. In the period from the end of the\r\nfirst half of the present century to the close of the Civil War slavery\r\nrose to primary, but far from exclusive, importance. But this does not\r\njustify Dr. von Holst (to take an example) in treating our\r\nconstitutional history in its formative period down to 1828 in a single\r\nvolume, giving six volumes chiefly to the history of slavery from 1828\r\nto 1861, under the title \"Constitutional History of the United States.\"\r\nThe growth of nationalism and the evolution of American political\r\ninstitutions were dependent on the advance of the frontier. Even so\r\nrecent a writer as Rhodes, in his \"History of the United States since\r\nthe Compromise of 1850,\" has treated the legislation called out by the\r\nwestern advance as incidental to the slavery struggle.\r\n\r\nThis is a wrong perspective. The pioneer needed the goods of the coast,\r\nand so the grand series of internal improvement and railroad legislation\r\nbegan, with potent nationalizing effects. Over internal improvements\r\noccurred great debates, in which grave constitutional questions were\r\ndiscussed. Sectional groupings appear in the votes, profoundly\r\nsignificant for the historian. Loose construction increased as the\r\nnation marched westward.[25:1] But the West was not content with\r\nbringing the farm to the factory. Under the lead of Clay--\"Harry of the\r\nWest\"--protective tariffs were passed, with the cry of bringing the\r\nfactory to the farm. The disposition of the public lands was a third\r\nimportant subject of national legislation influenced by the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe public domain has been a force of profound importance in the\r\nnationalization and development of the government. The effects of the\r\nstruggle of the landed and the landless States, and of the Ordinance of\r\n1787, need no discussion.[25:2] Administratively the frontier called out\r\nsome of the highest and most vitalizing activities of the general\r\ngovernment. The purchase of Louisiana was perhaps the constitutional\r\nturning point in the history of the Republic, inasmuch as it afforded\r\nboth a new area for national legislation and the occasion of the\r\ndownfall of the policy of strict construction. But the purchase of\r\nLouisiana was called out by frontier needs and demands. As frontier\r\nStates accrued to the Union the national power grew. In a speech on the\r\ndedication of the Calhoun monument Mr. Lamar explained: \"In 1789 the\r\nStates were the creators of the Federal Government; in 1861 the Federal\r\nGovernment was the creator of a large majority of the States.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the public domain from the point of view of the sale\r\nand disposal of the public lands we are again brought face to face with\r\nthe frontier. The policy of the United States in dealing with its lands\r\nis in sharp contrast with the European system of scientific\r\nadministration. Efforts to make this domain a source of revenue, and to\r\nwithhold it from emigrants in order that settlement might be compact,\r\nwere in vain. The jealousy and the fears of the East were powerless in\r\nthe face of the demands of the frontiersmen. John Quincy Adams was\r\nobliged to confess: \"My own system of administration, which was to make\r\nthe national domain the inexhaustible fund for progressive and unceasing\r\ninternal improvement, has failed.\" The reason is obvious; a system of\r\nadministration was not what the West demanded; it wanted land. Adams\r\nstates the situation as follows: \"The slaveholders of the South have\r\nbought the coöperation of the western country by the bribe of the\r\nwestern lands, abandoning to the new Western States their own proportion\r\nof the public property and aiding them in the design of grasping all the\r\nlands into their own hands.\" Thomas H. Benton was the author of this\r\nsystem, which he brought forward as a substitute for the American system\r\nof Mr. Clay, and to supplant him as the leading statesman of the West.\r\nMr. Clay, by his tariff compromise with Mr. Calhoun, abandoned his own\r\nAmerican system. At the same time he brought forward a plan for\r\ndistributing among all the States of the Union the proceeds of the sales\r\nof the public lands. His bill for that purpose passed both Houses of\r\nCongress, but was vetoed by President Jackson, who, in his annual\r\nmessage of December, 1832, formally recommended that all public lands\r\nshould be gratuitously given away to individual adventurers and to the\r\nStates in which the lands are situated.[26:1]\r\n\r\n\"No subject,\" said Henry Clay, \"which has presented itself to the\r\npresent, or perhaps any preceding, Congress, is of greater magnitude\r\nthan that of the public lands.\" When we consider the far-reaching\r\neffects of the government's land policy upon political, economic, and\r\nsocial aspects of American life, we are disposed to agree with him. But\r\nthis legislation was framed under frontier influences, and under the\r\nlead of Western statesmen like Benton and Jackson. Said Senator Scott of\r\nIndiana in 1841: \"I consider the preëmption law merely declaratory of\r\nthe custom or common law of the settlers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the legislation with regard to land, tariff, and\r\ninternal improvements--the American system of the nationalizing Whig\r\nparty--was conditioned on frontier ideas and needs. But it was not\r\nmerely in legislative action that the frontier worked against the\r\nsectionalism of the coast. The economic and social characteristics of\r\nthe frontier worked against sectionalism. The men of the frontier had\r\ncloser resemblances to the Middle region than to either of the other\r\nsections. Pennsylvania had been the seed-plot of frontier emigration,\r\nand, although she passed on her settlers along the Great Valley into the\r\nwest of Virginia and the Carolinas, yet the industrial society of these\r\nSouthern frontiersmen was always more like that of the Middle region\r\nthan like that of the tide-water portion of the South, which later came\r\nto spread its industrial type throughout the South.\r\n\r\nThe Middle region, entered by New York harbor, was an open door to all\r\nEurope. The tide-water part of the South represented typical Englishmen,\r\nmodified by a warm climate and servile labor, and living in baronial\r\nfashion on great plantations; New England stood for a special English\r\nmovement--Puritanism. The Middle region was less English than the other\r\nsections. It had a wide mixture of nationalities, a varied society, the\r\nmixed town and county system of local government, a varied economic\r\nlife, many religious sects. In short, it was a region mediating between\r\nNew England and the South, and the East and the West. It represented\r\nthat composite nationality which the contemporary United States\r\nexhibits, that juxtaposition of non-English groups, occupying a valley\r\nor a little settlement, and presenting reflections of the map of Europe\r\nin their variety. It was democratic and nonsectional, if not national;\r\n\"easy, tolerant, and contented;\" rooted strongly in material prosperity.\r\nIt was typical of the modern United States. It was least sectional, not\r\nonly because it lay between North and South, but also because with no\r\nbarriers to shut out its frontiers from its settled region, and with a\r\nsystem of connecting waterways, the Middle region mediated between East\r\nand West as well as between North and South. Thus it became the\r\ntypically American region. Even the New Englander, who was shut out from\r\nthe frontier by the Middle region, tarrying in New York or Pennsylvania\r\non his westward march, lost the acuteness of his sectionalism on the\r\nway.[28:1]\r\n\r\nThe spread of cotton culture into the interior of the South finally\r\nbroke down the contrast between the \"tide-water\" region and the rest of\r\nthe State, and based Southern interests on slavery. Before this process\r\nrevealed its results the western portion of the South, which was akin to\r\nPennsylvania in stock, society, and industry, showed tendencies to fall\r\naway from the faith of the fathers into internal improvement legislation\r\nand nationalism. In the Virginia convention of 1829-30, called to revise\r\nthe constitution, Mr. Leigh, of Chesterfield, one of the tide-water\r\ncounties, declared:\r\n\r\n     One of the main causes of discontent which led to this\r\n     convention, that which had the strongest influence in\r\n     overcoming our veneration for the work of our fathers, which\r\n     taught us to contemn the sentiments of Henry and Mason and\r\n     Pendleton, which weaned us from our reverence for the\r\n     constituted authorities of the State, was an overweening\r\n     passion for internal improvement. I say this with perfect\r\n     knowledge, for it has been avowed to me by gentlemen from the\r\n     West over and over again. And let me tell the gentleman from\r\n     Albemarle (Mr. Gordon) that it has been another principal\r\n     object of those who set this ball of revolution in motion, to\r\n     overturn the doctrine of State rights, of which Virginia has\r\n     been the very pillar, and to remove the barrier she has\r\n     interposed to the interference of the Federal Government in\r\n     that same work of internal improvement, by so reorganizing the\r\n     legislature that Virginia, too, may be hitched to the Federal\r\n     car.\r\n\r\nIt was this nationalizing tendency of the West that transformed the\r\ndemocracy of Jefferson into the national republicanism of Monroe and the\r\ndemocracy of Andrew Jackson. The West of the War of 1812, the West of\r\nClay, and Benton and Harrison, and Andrew Jackson, shut off by the\r\nMiddle States and the mountains from the coast sections, had a\r\nsolidarity of its own with national tendencies.[29:1] On the tide of the\r\nFather of Waters, North and South met and mingled into a nation.\r\nInterstate migration went steadily on--a process of cross-fertilization\r\nof ideas and institutions. The fierce struggle of the sections over\r\nslavery on the western frontier does not diminish the truth of this\r\nstatement; it proves the truth of it. Slavery was a sectional trait that\r\nwould not down, but in the West it could not remain sectional. It was\r\nthe greatest of frontiersmen who declared: \"I believe this Government\r\ncan not endure permanently half slave and half free. It will become all\r\nof one thing or all of the other.\" Nothing works for nationalism like\r\nintercourse within the nation. Mobility of population is death to\r\nlocalism, and the western frontier worked irresistibly in unsettling\r\npopulation. The effect reached back from the frontier and affected\r\nprofoundly the Atlantic coast and even the Old World.\r\n\r\nBut the most important effect of the frontier has been in the promotion\r\nof democracy here and in Europe. As has been indicated, the frontier is\r\nproductive of individualism. Complex society is precipitated by the\r\nwilderness into a kind of primitive organization based on the family.\r\nThe tendency is anti-social. It produces antipathy to control, and\r\nparticularly to any direct control. The tax-gatherer is viewed as a\r\nrepresentative of oppression. Prof. Osgood, in an able article,[30:1]\r\nhas pointed out that the frontier conditions prevalent in the colonies\r\nare important factors in the explanation of the American Revolution,\r\nwhere individual liberty was sometimes confused with absence of all\r\neffective government. The same conditions aid in explaining the\r\ndifficulty of instituting a strong government in the period of the\r\nconfederacy. The frontier individualism has from the beginning promoted\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe frontier States that came into the Union in the first quarter of a\r\ncentury of its existence came in with democratic suffrage provisions,\r\nand had reactive effects of the highest importance upon the older States\r\nwhose peoples were being attracted there. An extension of the franchise\r\nbecame essential. It was _western_ New York that forced an extension of\r\nsuffrage in the constitutional convention of that State in 1821; and it\r\nwas _western_ Virginia that compelled the tide-water region to put a\r\nmore liberal suffrage provision in the constitution framed in 1830, and\r\nto give to the frontier region a more nearly proportionate\r\nrepresentation with the tide-water aristocracy. The rise of democracy as\r\nan effective force in the nation came in with western preponderance\r\nunder Jackson and William Henry Harrison, and it meant the triumph of\r\nthe frontier--with all of its good and with all of its evil\r\nelements.[31:1] An interesting illustration of the tone of frontier\r\ndemocracy in 1830 comes from the same debates in the Virginia convention\r\nalready referred to. A representative from western Virginia declared:\r\n\r\n     But, sir, it is not the increase of population in the West\r\n     which this gentleman ought to fear. It is the energy which the\r\n     mountain breeze and western habits impart to those emigrants.\r\n     They are regenerated, politically I mean, sir. They soon\r\n     become _working politicians_; and the difference, sir, between\r\n     a _talking_ and a _working_ politician is immense. The Old\r\n     Dominion has long been celebrated for producing great orators;\r\n     the ablest metaphysicians in policy; men that can split hairs\r\n     in all abstruse questions of political economy. But at home,\r\n     or when they return from Congress, they have negroes to fan\r\n     them asleep. But a Pennsylvania, a New York, an Ohio, or a\r\n     western Virginia statesman, though far inferior in logic,\r\n     metaphysics, and rhetoric to an old Virginia statesman, has\r\n     this advantage, that when he returns home he takes off his\r\n     coat and takes hold of the plow. This gives him bone and\r\n     muscle, sir, and preserves his republican principles pure and\r\n     uncontaminated.\r\n\r\nSo long as free land exists, the opportunity for a competency exists,\r\nand economic power secures political power. But the democracy born of\r\nfree land, strong in selfishness and individualism, intolerant of\r\nadministrative experience and education, and pressing individual liberty\r\nbeyond its proper bounds, has its dangers as well as its benefits.\r\nIndividualism in America has allowed a laxity in regard to governmental\r\naffairs which has rendered possible the spoils system and all the\r\nmanifest evils that follow from the lack of a highly developed civic\r\nspirit. In this connection may be noted also the influence of frontier\r\nconditions in permitting lax business honor, inflated paper currency and\r\nwild-cat banking. The colonial and revolutionary frontier was the region\r\nwhence emanated many of the worst forms of an evil currency.[32:1] The\r\nWest in the War of 1812 repeated the phenomenon on the frontier of that\r\nday, while the speculation and wild-cat banking of the period of the\r\ncrisis of 1837 occurred on the new frontier belt of the next tier of\r\nStates. Thus each one of the periods of lax financial integrity\r\ncoincides with periods when a new set of frontier communities had\r\narisen, and coincides in area with these successive frontiers, for the\r\nmost part. The recent Populist agitation is a case in point. Many a\r\nState that now declines any connection with the tenets of the Populists,\r\nitself adhered to such ideas in an earlier stage of the development of\r\nthe State. A primitive society can hardly be expected to show the\r\nintelligent appreciation of the complexity of business interests in a\r\ndeveloped society. The continual recurrence of these areas of\r\npaper-money agitation is another evidence that the frontier can be\r\nisolated and studied as a factor in American history of the highest\r\nimportance.[32:2]\r\n\r\nThe East has always feared the result of an unregulated advance of the\r\nfrontier, and has tried to check and guide it. The English authorities\r\nwould have checked settlement at the headwaters of the Atlantic\r\ntributaries and allowed the \"savages to enjoy their deserts in quiet\r\nlest the peltry trade should decrease.\" This called out Burke's splendid\r\nprotest:\r\n\r\n     If you stopped your grants, what would be the consequence? The\r\n     people would occupy without grants. They have already so\r\n     occupied in many places. You can not station garrisons in\r\n     every part of these deserts. If you drive the people from one\r\n     place, they will carry on their annual tillage and remove with\r\n     their flocks and herds to another. Many of the people in the\r\n     back settlements are already little attached to particular\r\n     situations. Already they have topped the Appalachian\r\n     Mountains. From thence they behold before them an immense\r\n     plain, one vast, rich, level meadow; a square of five hundred\r\n     miles. Over this they would wander without a possibility of\r\n     restraint; they would change their manners with their habits\r\n     of life; would soon forget a government by which they were\r\n     disowned; would become hordes of English Tartars; and, pouring\r\n     down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irresistible\r\n     cavalry, become masters of your governors and your\r\n     counselers, your collectors and comptrollers, and of all the\r\n     slaves that adhered to them. Such would, and in no long time\r\n     must, be the effect of attempting to forbid as a crime and to\r\n     suppress as an evil the command and blessing of Providence,\r\n     \"Increase and multiply.\" Such would be the happy result of an\r\n     endeavor to keep as a lair of wild beasts that earth which\r\n     God, by an express charter, has given to the children of men.\r\n\r\nBut the English Government was not alone in its desire to limit the\r\nadvance of the frontier and guide its destinies. Tidewater\r\nVirginia[34:1] and South Carolina[34:2] gerrymandered those colonies to\r\ninsure the dominance of the coast in their legislatures. Washington\r\ndesired to settle a State at a time in the Northwest; Jefferson would\r\nreserve from settlement the territory of his Louisiana Purchase north of\r\nthe thirty-second parallel, in order to offer it to the Indians in\r\nexchange for their settlements east of the Mississippi. \"When we shall\r\nbe full on this side,\" he writes, \"we may lay off a range of States on\r\nthe western bank from the head to the mouth, and so range after range,\r\nadvancing compactly as we multiply.\" Madison went so far as to argue to\r\nthe French minister that the United States had no interest in seeing\r\npopulation extend itself on the right bank of the Mississippi, but\r\nshould rather fear it. When the Oregon question was under debate, in\r\n1824, Smyth, of Virginia, would draw an unchangeable line for the limits\r\nof the United States at the outer limit of two tiers of States beyond\r\nthe Mississippi, complaining that the seaboard States were being drained\r\nof the flower of their population by the bringing of too much land into\r\nmarket. Even Thomas Benton, the man of widest views of the destiny of\r\nthe West, at this stage of his career declared that along the ridge of\r\nthe Rocky mountains \"the western limits of the Republic should be drawn,\r\nand the statue of the fabled god Terminus should be raised upon its\r\nhighest peak, never to be thrown down.\"[35:1] But the attempts to limit\r\nthe boundaries, to restrict land sales and settlement, and to deprive\r\nthe West of its share of political power were all in vain. Steadily the\r\nfrontier of settlement advanced and carried with it individualism,\r\ndemocracy, and nationalism, and powerfully affected the East and the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe most effective efforts of the East to regulate the frontier came\r\nthrough its educational and religious activity, exerted by interstate\r\nmigration and by organized societies. Speaking in 1835, Dr. Lyman\r\nBeecher declared: \"It is equally plain that the religious and political\r\ndestiny of our nation is to be decided in the West,\" and he pointed out\r\nthat the population of the West \"is assembled from all the States of the\r\nUnion and from all the nations of Europe, and is rushing in like the\r\nwaters of the flood, demanding for its moral preservation the immediate\r\nand universal action of those institutions which discipline the mind and\r\narm the conscience and the heart. And so various are the opinions and\r\nhabits, and so recent and imperfect is the acquaintance, and so sparse\r\nare the settlements of the West, that no homogeneous public sentiment\r\ncan be formed to legislate immediately into being the requisite\r\ninstitutions. And yet they are all needed immediately in their utmost\r\nperfection and power. A nation is being 'born in a day.' . . . But what\r\nwill become of the West if her prosperity rushes up to such a majesty of\r\npower, while those great institutions linger which are necessary to form\r\nthe mind and the conscience and the heart of that vast world. It must\r\nnot be permitted. . . . Let no man at the East quiet himself and dream\r\nof liberty, whatever may become of the West. . . . Her destiny is our\r\ndestiny.\"[36:1]\r\n\r\nWith the appeal to the conscience of New England, he adds appeals to her\r\nfears lest other religious sects anticipate her own. The New England\r\npreacher and school-teacher left their mark on the West. The dread of\r\nWestern emancipation from New England's political and economic control\r\nwas paralleled by her fears lest the West cut loose from her religion.\r\nCommenting in 1850 on reports that settlement was rapidly extending\r\nnorthward in Wisconsin, the editor of the _Home Missionary_ writes: \"We\r\nscarcely know whether to rejoice or mourn over this extension of our\r\nsettlements. While we sympathize in whatever tends to increase the\r\nphysical resources and prosperity of our country, we can not forget that\r\nwith all these dispersions into remote and still remoter corners of the\r\nland the supply of the means of grace is becoming relatively less and\r\nless.\" Acting in accordance with such ideas, home missions were\r\nestablished and Western colleges were erected. As seaboard cities like\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and Baltimore strove for the mastery of Western\r\ntrade, so the various denominations strove for the possession of the\r\nWest. Thus an intellectual stream from New England sources fertilized\r\nthe West. Other sections sent their missionaries; but the real struggle\r\nwas between sects. The contest for power and the expansive tendency\r\nfurnished to the various sects by the existence of a moving frontier\r\nmust have had important results on the character of religious\r\norganization in the United States. The multiplication of rival churches\r\nin the little frontier towns had deep and lasting social effects. The\r\nreligious aspects of the frontier make a chapter in our history which\r\nneeds study.\r\n\r\nFrom the conditions of frontier life came intellectual traits of\r\nprofound importance. The works of travelers along each frontier from\r\ncolonial days onward describe certain common traits, and these traits\r\nhave, while softening down, still persisted as survivals in the place of\r\ntheir origin, even when a higher social organization succeeded. The\r\nresult is that to the frontier the American intellect owes its striking\r\ncharacteristics. That coarseness and strength combined with acuteness\r\nand inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to\r\nfind expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the\r\nartistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless, nervous\r\nenergy;[37:1] that dominant individualism, working for good and for\r\nevil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with\r\nfreedom--these are traits of the frontier, or traits called out\r\nelsewhere because of the existence of the frontier. Since the days when\r\nthe fleet of Columbus sailed into the waters of the New World, America\r\nhas been another name for opportunity, and the people of the United\r\nStates have taken their tone from the incessant expansion which has not\r\nonly been open but has even been forced upon them. He would be a rash\r\nprophet who should assert that the expansive character of American life\r\nhas now entirely ceased. Movement has been its dominant fact, and,\r\nunless this training has no effect upon a people, the American energy\r\nwill continually demand a wider field for its exercise. But never again\r\nwill such gifts of free land offer themselves. For a moment, at the\r\nfrontier, the bonds of custom are broken and unrestraint is triumphant.\r\nThere is not _tabula rasa_. The stubborn American environment is there\r\nwith its imperious summons to accept its conditions; the inherited ways\r\nof doing things are also there; and yet, in spite of environment, and in\r\nspite of custom, each frontier did indeed furnish a new field of\r\nopportunity, a gate of escape from the bondage of the past; and\r\nfreshness, and confidence, and scorn of older society, impatience of its\r\nrestraints and its ideas, and indifference to its lessons, have\r\naccompanied the frontier. What the Mediterranean Sea was to the Greeks,\r\nbreaking the bond of custom, offering new experiences, calling out new\r\ninstitutions and activities, that, and more, the ever retreating\r\nfrontier has been to the United States directly, and to the nations of\r\nEurope more remotely. And now, four centuries from the discovery of\r\nAmerica, at the end of a hundred years of life under the Constitution,\r\nthe frontier has gone, and with its going has closed the first period of\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1:1] A paper read at the meeting of the American Historical Association\r\nin Chicago, July 12, 1893.

In the discussion of its\r\n     extent, the westward movement, etc., it cannot therefore any\r\n     longer have a place in the census reports.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries prior to this announcement, in 1690, a committee of the\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts recommended the Court to order what shall\r\nbe the frontier and to maintain a committee to settle garrisons on the\r\nfrontier with forty soldiers to each frontier town as a main\r\nguard.[39:2] In the two hundred years between this official attempt to\r\nlocate the Massachusetts frontier line, and the official announcement of\r\nthe ending of the national frontier line, westward expansion was the\r\nmost important single process in American history.\r\n\r\nThe designation \"frontier town\" was not, however, a new one. As early as\r\n1645 inhabitants of Concord, Sudbury, and Dedham, \"being inland townes\r\n& but thinly peopled,\" were forbidden to remove without authority;[40:1]\r\nin 1669, certain towns had been the subject of legislation as \"frontier\r\ntowns;\"[40:2] and in the period of King Philip's War there were various\r\nenactments regarding frontier towns.[40:3] In the session of 1675-6 it\r\nhad been proposed to build a fence of stockades or stone eight feet high\r\nfrom the Charles \"where it is navigable\" to the Concord at Billerica and\r\nthence to the Merrimac and down the river to the Bay, \"by which meanes\r\nthat whole tract will [be] environed, for the security & safty (vnder\r\nGod) of the people, their houses, goods & cattel; from the rage & fury\r\nof the enimy.\"[40:4] This project, however, of a kind of Roman Wall did\r\nnot appeal to the frontiersmen of the time. It was a part of the\r\nantiquated ideas of defense which had been illustrated by the impossible\r\nequipment of the heavily armored soldier of the early Puritan régime\r\nwhose corslets and head pieces, pikes, matchlocks, fourquettes and\r\nbandoleers, went out of use about the period of King Philip's War. The\r\nfifty-seven postures provided in the approved manual of arms for loading\r\nand firing the matchlock proved too great a handicap in the chase of the\r\nnimble savage. In this era the frontier fighter adapted himself to a\r\nmore open order, and lighter equipment suggested by the Indian warrior's\r\npractice.[40:5]\r\n\r\nThe settler on the outskirts of Puritan civilization took up the task of\r\nbearing the brunt of attack and pushing forward the line of advance\r\nwhich year after year carried American settlements into the wilderness.\r\nIn American thought and speech the term \"frontier\" has come to mean the\r\nedge of settlement, rather than, as in Europe, the political boundary.\r\nBy 1690 it was already evident that the frontier of settlement and the\r\nfrontier of military defense were coinciding. As population advanced\r\ninto the wilderness and thus successively brought new exposed areas\r\nbetween the settlements on the one side and the Indians with their\r\nEuropean backers on the other, the military frontier ceased to be\r\nthought of as the Atlantic coast, but rather as a moving line bounding\r\nthe un-won wilderness. It could not be a fortified boundary along the\r\ncharter limits, for those limits extended to the South Sea, and\r\nconflicted with the bounds of sister colonies. The thing to be defended\r\nwas the outer edge of this expanding society, a changing frontier, one\r\nthat needed designation and re-statement with the changing location of\r\nthe \"West.\"\r\n\r\nIt will help to illustrate the significance of this new frontier when we\r\nsee that Virginia at about the same time as Massachusetts underwent a\r\nsimilar change and attempted to establish frontier towns, or\r\n\"co-habitations,\" at the \"heads,\" that is the first falls, the vicinity\r\nof Richmond, Petersburg, etc., of her rivers.[41:1]\r\n\r\nThe Virginia system of \"particular plantations\" introduced along the\r\nJames at the close of the London Company's activity had furnished a type\r\nfor the New England town. In recompense, at this later day the New\r\nEngland town may have furnished a model for Virginia's efforts to create\r\nfrontier settlements by legislation.\r\n\r\nAn act of March 12, 1694-5, by the General Court of Massachusetts\r\nenumerated the \"Frontier Towns\" which the inhabitants were forbidden to\r\ndesert on pain of loss of their lands (if landholders) or of\r\nimprisonment (if not landholders), unless permission to remove were\r\nfirst obtained.[42:1] These eleven frontier towns included Wells, York,\r\nand Kittery on the eastern frontier, and Amesbury, Haverhill, Dunstable,\r\nChelmsford, Groton, Lancaster, Marlborough,[42:2] and Deerfield. In\r\nMarch, 1699-1700, the law was reënacted with the addition of Brookfield,\r\nMendon, and Woodstock, together with seven others, Salisbury,\r\nAndover,[42:3] Billerica, Hatfield, Hadley, Westfield, and Northampton,\r\nwhich, \"tho' they be not frontiers as those towns first named, yet lye\r\nmore open than many others to an attack of an Enemy.\"[42:4]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1704 the General Court of Connecticut, following\r\nclosely the act of Massachusetts, named as her frontier towns, not to\r\nbe deserted, Symsbury, Waterbury, Danbury, Colchester, Windham,\r\nMansfield, and Plainfield.\r\n\r\nThus about the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century there was an officially designated frontier line for\r\nNew England. The line passing through these enumerated towns represents:\r\n(1) the outskirts of settlement along the eastern coast and up the\r\nMerrimac and its tributaries,--a region threatened from the Indian\r\ncountry by way of the Winnepesaukee Lake; (2) the end of the ribbon of\r\nsettlement up the Connecticut Valley, menaced by the Canadian Indians by\r\nway of the Lake Champlain and Winooski River route to the Connecticut;\r\n(3) boundary towns which marked the edges of that inferior agricultural\r\nregion, where the hard crystalline rocks furnished a later foundation\r\nfor Shays' Rebellion, opposition to the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and the abandoned farm; and (4) the isolated intervale of\r\nBrookfield which lay intermediate between these frontiers.\r\n\r\nBesides this New England frontier there was a belt of settlement in New\r\nYork, ascending the Hudson to where Albany and Schenectady served as\r\noutposts against the Five Nations, who menaced the Mohawk, and against\r\nthe French and the Canadian Indians, who threatened the Hudson by way of\r\nLake Champlain and Lake George.[43:1] The sinister relations of leading\r\ncitizens of Albany engaged in the fur trade with these Indians, even\r\nduring time of war, tended to protect the Hudson River frontier at the\r\nexpense of the frontier towns of New England.\r\n\r\nThe common sequence of frontier types (fur trader, cattle-raising\r\npioneer, small primitive farmer, and the farmer engaged in intensive\r\nvaried agriculture to produce a surplus for export) had appeared, though\r\nconfusedly, in New England. The traders and their posts had prepared the\r\nway for the frontier towns,[44:1] and the cattle industry was most\r\nimportant to the early farmers.[44:2] But the stages succeeded rapidly\r\nand intermingled. After King Philip's War, while Albany was still in the\r\nfur-trading stage, the New England frontier towns were rather like mark\r\ncolonies, military-agricultural outposts against the Indian enemy.\r\n\r\nThe story of the border warfare between Canada and the frontier towns\r\nfurnishes ample material for studying frontier life and institutions;\r\nbut I shall not attempt to deal with the narrative of the wars. The\r\npalisaded meeting-house square, the fortified isolated garrison houses,\r\nthe massacres and captivities are familiar features of New England's\r\nhistory. The Indian was a very real influence upon the mind and morals\r\nas well as upon the institutions of frontier New England. The occasional\r\ninstances of Puritans returning from captivity to visit the frontier\r\ntowns, Catholic in religion, painted and garbed as Indians and speaking\r\nthe Indian tongue,[44:3] and the half-breed children of captive Puritan\r\nmothers, tell a sensational part of the story; but in the normal, as\r\nwell as in such exceptional relations of the frontier townsmen to the\r\nIndians, there are clear evidences of the transforming influence of the\r\nIndian frontier upon the Puritan type of English colonist.\r\n\r\nIn 1703-4, for example, the General Court of Massachusetts ordered five\r\nhundred pairs of snowshoes and an equal number of moccasins for use in\r\nspecified counties \"lying Frontier next to the Wilderness.\"[45:1]\r\nConnecticut in 1704 after referring to her frontier towns and garrisons\r\nordered that \"said company of English and Indians shall, from time to\r\ntime at the discretion of their chief co[=m]ander, range the woods to\r\nindevour the discovery of an approaching enemy, and in especiall manner\r\nfrom Westfield to Ousatunnuck.[45:2] . . . And for the incouragement of\r\nour forces gone or going against the enemy, this Court will allow out of\r\nthe publick treasurie the su[=m]e of five pounds for every mans scalp of\r\nthe enemy killed in this Colonie.\"[45:3] Massachusetts offered bounties\r\nfor scalps, varying in amount according to whether the scalp was of men,\r\nor women and youths, and whether it was taken by regular forces under\r\npay, volunteers in service, or volunteers without pay.[45:4] One of the\r\nmost striking phases of frontier adjustment, was the proposal of the\r\nRev. Solomon Stoddard of Northampton in the fall of 1703, urging the use\r\nof dogs \"to hunt Indians as they do Bears.\" The argument was that the\r\ndogs would catch many an Indian who would be too light of foot for the\r\ntownsmen, nor was it to be thought of as inhuman; for the Indians \"act\r\nlike wolves and are to be dealt with as wolves.\"[45:5] In fact\r\nMassachusetts passed an act in 1706 for the raising and increasing of\r\ndogs for the better security of the frontiers, and both Massachusetts\r\nand Connecticut in 1708 paid money from their treasury for the trailing\r\nof dogs.[46:1]\r\n\r\nThus we come to familiar ground: the Massachusetts frontiersman like his\r\nwestern successor hated the Indians; the \"tawney serpents,\" of Cotton\r\nMather's phrase, were to be hunted down and scalped in accord with law\r\nand, in at least one instance by the chaplain himself, a Harvard\r\ngraduate, the hero of the Ballad of Pigwacket, who\r\n\r\n                        many Indians slew,\r\n     And some of them he scalp'd when bullets round him flew.[46:2]\r\n\r\nWithin the area bounded by the frontier line, were the broken fragments\r\nof Indians defeated in the era of King Philip's War, restrained within\r\nreservations, drunken and degenerate survivors, among whom the\r\nmissionaries worked with small results, a vexation to the border\r\ntowns,[46:3] as they were in the case of later frontiers. Although, as\r\nhas been said, the frontier towns had scattered garrison houses, and\r\npalisaded enclosures similar to the neighborhood forts, or stations, of\r\nKentucky in the Revolution, and of Indiana and Illinois in the War of\r\n1812, one difference is particularly noteworthy. In the case of\r\nfrontiersmen who came down from Pennsylvania into the Upland South along\r\nthe eastern edge of the Alleghanies, as well as in the more obvious case\r\nof the backwoodsmen of Kentucky and Tennessee, the frontier towns were\r\ntoo isolated from the main settled regions to allow much military\r\nprotection by the older areas. On the New England frontier, because it\r\nwas adjacent to the coast towns, this was not the case, and here, as in\r\nseventeenth century Virginia, great activity in protecting the frontier\r\nwas evinced by the colonial authorities, and the frontier towns\r\nthemselves called loudly for assistance. This phase of frontier defense\r\nneeds a special study, but at present it is sufficient to recall that\r\nthe colony sent garrisons to the frontier besides using the militia of\r\nthe frontier towns; and that it employed rangers to patrol from garrison\r\nto garrison.[47:1]\r\n\r\nThese were prototypes of the regular army post, and of rangers,\r\ndragoons, cavalry and mounted police who have carried the remoter\r\nmilitary frontier forward. It is possible to trace this military cordon\r\nfrom New England to the Carolinas early in the eighteenth century, still\r\nneighboring the coast; by 1840 it ran from Fort Snelling on the upper\r\nMississippi through various posts to the Sabine boundary of Texas, and\r\nso it passed forward until to-day it lies at the edge of Mexico and the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nA few examples of frontier appeals for garrison aid will help to an\r\nunderstanding of the early form of the military frontier. Wells asks,\r\nJune 30, 1689:\r\n\r\n     1 That yo{r} Hon{rs} will please to send us speedily twenty\r\n     Eight good brisk men that may be serviceable as a guard to us\r\n     whilest we get in our Harvest of Hay & Corn, (we being unable\r\n     to Defend ourselves & to Do our work), & also to Persue &\r\n     destroy the Enemy as occasion may require\r\n\r\n     2 That these men may be compleatly furnished with Arms,\r\n     Amunition & Provision, and that upon the Countrys account, it\r\n     being a Generall War.[48:1]\r\n\r\nDunstable, \"still weak and unable both to keep our Garrisons and to send\r\nout men to get hay for our Cattle; without doeing which wee cannot\r\nsubsist,\" petitioned July 23, 1689, for twenty footmen for a month \"to\r\nscout about the towne while wee get our hay.\" Otherwise, they say, they\r\nmust be forced to leave.[48:2] Still more indicative of this temper is\r\nthe petition of Lancaster, March 11, 1675-6, to the Governor and\r\nCouncil: \"As God has made you father over us so you will have a father's\r\npity to us.\" They asked a guard of men and aid, without which they must\r\nleave.[48:3] Deerfield pled in 1678 to the General Court, \"unlest you\r\nwill be pleased to take us (out of your fatherlike pitty) and Cherish us\r\nin yo{r} Bosomes we are like Suddainly to breathe out o{r} Last\r\nBreath.\"[48:4]\r\n\r\nThe perils of the time, the hardships of the frontier towns and\r\nreadiness of this particular frontier to ask appropriations for losses\r\nand wounds,[48:5] are abundantly illustrated in similar petitions from\r\nother towns. One is tempted at times to attribute the very frank\r\nself-pity and dependent attitude to a minister's phrasing, and to the\r\ndesire to secure remission of taxes, the latter a frontier trait more\r\noften associated with riot than with religion in other regions.\r\n\r\nAs an example of various petitions the following from Groton in 1704 is\r\nsuggestive. Here the minister's hand is probably absent:\r\n\r\n     1 That wharas by the all dessposing hand of god who orders all\r\n     things in infinit wisdom it is our portion to liue In such a\r\n     part of the land which by reson of the enemy Is becom vary\r\n     dangras as by wofull experiants we haue falt both formarly and\r\n     of late to our grat damidg & discoridgment and espashaly this\r\n     last yere hauing lost so many parsons som killed som\r\n     captauated and som remoued and allso much corn & cattell and\r\n     horses & hay wharby wee ar gratly Impouerrished and brought\r\n     uary low & in a uary pore capasity to subsist any longer As\r\n     the barers her of can inform your honors\r\n\r\n     2 And more then all this our paster mr hobard is & hath been\r\n     for aboue a yere uncapable of desspansing the ordinances of\r\n     god amongst us & we haue advised with th Raurant Elders of our\r\n     nayboring churches and they aduise to hyare another minister\r\n     and to saport mr hobard and to make our adras to your honours\r\n     we haue but litel laft to pay our deus with being so pore and\r\n     few In numbr ather to town or cuntrey & we being a frantere\r\n     town & lyable to dangor there being no safty in going out nor\r\n     coming in but for a long time we haue got our brad with the\r\n     parel of our liues & allso broght uery low by so grat a charg\r\n     of bilding garisons & fortefycations by ordur of athorety &\r\n     thar is saural of our Inhabitants ramoued out of town & others\r\n     are prouiding to remoue, axcapt somthing be don for our\r\n     Incoridgment for we are so few & so por that we canot pay two\r\n     ministors nathar ar we wiling to liue without any we spand so\r\n     much time in waching and warding that we can doe but litel els\r\n     & truly we haue liued allmost 2 yers more like soulders then\r\n     other wise & accapt your honars can find out some bater way\r\n     for our safty and support we cannot uphold as a town ather by\r\n     remitting our tax or tow alow pay for building the sauarall\r\n     forts alowed and ordred by athority or alls to alow the one\r\n     half of our own Inhabitants to be under pay or to grant\r\n     liberty for our remufe Into our naiburing towns to tak cer for\r\n     oursalfs all which if your honors shall se meet to grant you\r\n     will hereby gratly incoridg your humble pateceners to conflect\r\n     with th many trubls we are ensadant unto.[50:1]\r\n\r\nForced together into houses for protection, getting in their crops at\r\nthe peril of their lives, the frontier townsmen felt it a hardship to\r\ncontribute also to the taxes of the province while they helped to\r\nprotect the exposed frontier. In addition there were grievances of\r\nabsentee proprietors who paid no town taxes and yet profited by the\r\nexertions of the frontiersmen; of that I shall speak later.\r\n\r\nIf we were to trust to these petitions asking favors from the government\r\nof the colony, we might impute to these early frontiersmen a degree of\r\nsubmission to authority unlike that of other frontiersmen,[51:1] and\r\nindeed not wholly warranted by the facts. Reading carefully, we find\r\nthat, however prudently phrased, the petitions are in fact complaints\r\nagainst taxation; demands for expenditures by the colony in their\r\nbehalf; criticisms of absentee proprietors; intimations that they may be\r\nforced to abandon the frontier position so essential to the defense of\r\nthe settled eastern country.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of military insubordination characteristic of the frontier is\r\nevident in the accounts of these towns, such as Pynchon's in 1694,\r\ncomplaining of the decay of the fortifications at Hatfield, Hadley, and\r\nSpringfield: \"the people a little wilful. Inclined to doe when and how\r\nthey please or not at all.\"[51:2] Saltonstall writes from Haverhill\r\nabout the same time regarding his ill success in recruiting: \"I will\r\nnever plead for an Haverhill man more,\" and he begs that some meet\r\nperson be sent \"to tell us what we should, may or must do. I have\r\nlaboured in vain: some go this, and that, and the other way at pleasure,\r\nand do what they list.\"[51:3] This has a familiar ring to the student of\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the later frontier also, the existence of a common\r\ndanger on the borders of settlement tended to consolidate not only the\r\ntowns of Massachusetts into united action for defense, but also the\r\nvarious colonies. The frontier was an incentive to sectional combination\r\nthen as it was to nationalism afterward. When in 1692 Connecticut sent\r\nsoldiers from her own colony to aid the Massachusetts towns on the\r\nConnecticut River,[52:1] she showed a realization that the Deerfield\r\npeople, who were \"in a sense in the enemy's Mouth almost,\" as Pynchon\r\nwrote, constituted her own frontier[52:2] and that the facts of\r\ngeography were more compelling than arbitrary colonial boundaries.\r\nThereby she also took a step that helped to break down provincial\r\nantagonisms. When in 1689 Massachusetts and Connecticut sent agents to\r\nAlbany to join with New York in making presents to the Indians of that\r\ncolony in order to engage their aid against the French,[52:3] they\r\nrecognized (as their leaders put it) that Albany was \"the hinge\" of the\r\nfrontier in this exposed quarter. In thanking Connecticut for the\r\nassistance furnished in 1690 Livingston said: \"I hope your honors do not\r\nlook upon Albany as Albany, but as the frontier of your honor's Colony\r\nand of all their Majesties countries.\"[52:4]\r\n\r\nThe very essence of the American frontier is that it is the graphic line\r\nwhich records the expansive energies of the people behind it, and which\r\nby the law of its own being continually draws that advance after it to\r\nnew conquests. This is one of the most significant things about New\r\nEngland's frontier in these years. That long blood-stained line of the\r\neastern frontier which skirted the Maine coast was of great importance,\r\nfor it imparted a western tone to the life and characteristics of the\r\nMaine people which endures to this day, and it was one line of advance\r\nfor New England toward the mouth of the St. Lawrence, leading again and\r\nagain to diplomatic negotiations with the powers that held that river.\r\nThe line of the towns that occupied the waters of the Merrimac, tempted\r\nthe province continually into the wilderness of New Hampshire. The\r\nConnecticut river towns pressed steadily up that stream, along its\r\ntributaries into the Hoosatonic valleys, and into the valleys between\r\nthe Green Mountains of Vermont. By the end of 1723, the General Court of\r\nMassachusetts enacted,--\r\n\r\n     That It will be of Great Service to all the Western Frontiers,\r\n     both in this and the Neighboring Government of Conn., to Build\r\n     a Block House above Northfield, in the most convenient Place\r\n     on the Lands called the Equivilant Lands, & to post in it\r\n     forty Able Men, English & Western Indians, to be employed in\r\n     Scouting at a Good Distance up Conn. River, West River, Otter\r\n     Creek, and sometimes Eastwardly above the Great Manadnuck, for\r\n     the Discovery of the Enemy Coming towards anny of the frontier\r\n     Towns.[53:1]\r\n\r\nThe \"frontier Towns\" were preparing to swarm. It was not long before\r\nFort Dummer replaced \"the Block House,\" and the Berkshires and Vermont\r\nbecame new frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson River likewise was recognized as another line of advance\r\npointing the way to Lake Champlain and Montreal, calling out demands\r\nthat protection should be secured by means of an aggressive advance of\r\nthe frontier. _Canada delenda est_ became the rallying cry in New\r\nEngland as well as in New York, and combined diplomatic pressure and\r\nmilitary expeditions followed in the French and Indian wars and in the\r\nRevolution, in which the children of the Connecticut and Massachusetts\r\nfrontier towns, acclimated to Indian fighting, followed Ethan Allen and\r\nhis fellows to the north.[54:1]\r\n\r\nHaving touched upon some of the military and expansive tendencies of\r\nthis first official frontier, let us next turn to its social, economic,\r\nand political aspects. How far was this first frontier a field for the\r\ninvestment of eastern capital and for political control by it? Were\r\nthere evidences of antagonism between the frontier and the settled,\r\nproperty-holding classes of the coast? Restless democracy, resentfulness\r\nover taxation and control, and recriminations between the Western\r\npioneer and the Eastern capitalist, have been characteristic features of\r\nother frontiers: were similar phenomena in evidence here? Did\r\n\"Populistic\" tendencies appear in this frontier, and were there\r\ngrievances which explained these tendencies?[54:2]\r\n\r\nIn such colonies as New York and Virginia the land grants were often\r\nmade to members of the Council and their influential friends, even when\r\nthere were actual settlers already on the grants. In the case of New\r\nEngland the land system is usually so described as to give the\r\nimpression that it was based on a non-commercial policy, creating new\r\nPuritan towns by free grants of land made in advance to approved\r\nsettlers. This description does not completely fit the case. That there\r\nwas an economic interest on the part of absentee proprietors, and that\r\nmen of political influence with the government were often among the\r\ngrantees seems also to be true. Melville Egleston states the case thus:\r\n\"The court was careful not to authorize new plantations unless they were\r\nto be in a measure under the influence of men in whom confidence could\r\nbe placed, and commonly acted upon their application.\"[55:1] The\r\nfrontier, as we shall observe later, was not always disposed to see the\r\npractice in so favorable a light.\r\n\r\nNew towns seem to have been the result in some cases of the aggregation\r\nof settlers upon and about a large private grant; more often they\r\nresulted from settlers in older towns, where the town limits were\r\nextensive, spreading out to the good lands of the outskirts, beyond easy\r\naccess to the meeting-house, and then asking recognition as a separate\r\ntown. In some cases they may have been due to squatting on unassigned\r\nlands, or purchasing the Indian title and then asking confirmation. In\r\nothers grants were made in advance of settlement.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1636 the General Court had ordered that none go to new\r\nplantations without leave of a majority of the magistrates.[55:2] This\r\nmade the legal situation clear, but it would be dangerous to conclude\r\nthat it represented the actual situation. In any case there would be a\r\nnecessity for the settlers finally to secure the assent of the Court.\r\nThis could be facilitated by a grant to leading men having political\r\ninfluence with the magistrates. The complaints of absentee proprietors\r\nwhich find expression in the frontier petitions of the seventeenth and\r\nearly eighteenth century seems to indicate that this happened. In the\r\nsucceeding years of the eighteenth century the grants to leading men and\r\nthe economic and political motives in the grants are increasingly\r\nevident. This whole topic should be made the subject of special study.\r\nWhat is here offered is merely suggestive of a problem.[56:1]\r\n\r\nThe frontier settlers criticized the absentee proprietors, who profited\r\nby the pioneers' expenditure of labor and blood upon their farms, while\r\nthey themselves enjoyed security in an eastern town. A few examples from\r\ntown historians will illustrate this. Among the towns of the Merrimac\r\nValley, Salisbury was planted on the basis of a grant to a dozen\r\nproprietors including such men as Mr. Bradstreet and the younger Dudley,\r\nonly two of whom actually lived and died in Salisbury.[56:2] Amesbury\r\nwas set off from Salisbury by division, one half of the signers of the\r\nagreement signing by mark. Haverhill was first seated in 1641, following\r\npetitions from Mr. Ward, the Ipswich minister, his son-in-law, Giles\r\nFirmin, and others. Firmin's letter to Governor Winthrop, in 1640,\r\ncomplains that Ipswich had given him his ground in that town on\r\ncondition that he should stay in the town three years or else he could\r\nnot sell it, \"whenas others have no business but range from place to\r\nplace on purpose to live upon the countrey.\"[56:3]\r\n\r\nDunstable's large grant was brought about by a combination of leading\r\nmen who had received grants after the survey of 1652; among such grants\r\nwas one to the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company and another to\r\nThomas Brattle of Boston. Apparently it was settled chiefly by others\r\nthan the original grantees.[57:1] Groton voted in 1685 to sue the\r\n\"non-Residenc\" to assist in paying the rate, and in 1679 the General\r\nCourt had ordered non-residents having land at Groton to pay rates for\r\ntheir lands as residents did.[57:2] Lancaster (Nashaway) was granted to\r\nproprietors including various craftsmen in iron, indicating, perhaps, an\r\nexpectation of iron works, and few of the original proprietors actually\r\nsettled in the town.[57:3] The grant of 1653-4 was made by the Court\r\nafter reciting: (1) that it had ordered in 1647 that the \"ordering and\r\ndisposeing of the Plantation at Nashaway is wholly in the Courts power\";\r\n(2) \"Considering that there is allredy at Nashaway about nine Families\r\nand that severall both freemen and others intend to goe and setle there,\r\nsome whereof are named in this Petition,\" etc.\r\n\r\nMendon, begun in 1660 by Braintree people, is a particularly significant\r\nexample. In 1681 the inhabitants petitioned that while they are not \"of\r\nthe number of those who dwell in their ceiled houses & yet say the time\r\nis not come that the Lord's house should be built,\" yet they have gone\r\noutside of their strength \"unless others who are proprietors as well as\r\nourselves, (the price of whose lands is much raysed by our carrying on\r\npublic work & will be nothing worth if we are forced to quit the place)\r\ndoo beare an equal share in Town charges with us. Those who are not yet\r\ncome up to us are a great and far yet abler part of our\r\nProprietors . . .\"[57:4] In 1684 the selectmen inform the General Court\r\nthat one half of the proprietors, two only excepted, are dwelling in\r\nother places, \"Our proprietors, abroad,\" say they, \"object that they see\r\nno reason why they should pay as much for thayer lands as we do for our\r\nLand and stock, which we answer that if their be not a noff of reason\r\nfor it, we are sure there is more than enough of necessity to supply\r\nthat is wanting in reason.\"[58:1] This is the authentic voice of the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nDeerfield furnishes another type, inasmuch as a considerable part of its\r\nland was first held by Dedham, to which the grant was made as a\r\nrecompense for the location of the Natick Indian reservation. Dedham\r\nshares in the town often fell into the hands of speculators, and\r\nSheldon, the careful historian of Deerfield, declares that not a single\r\nDedham man became a permanent resident of the grant. In 1678 Deerfield\r\npetitioned the General Court as follows:\r\n\r\n     You may be pleased to know that the very principle & best of\r\n     the land; the best for soile; the best for situation; as lying\r\n     in y{e} centre & midle of the town: & as to quantity, nere\r\n     half, belongs unto eight or 9 proprietors each and every of\r\n     which, are never like to come to a settlement amongst us,\r\n     which we have formerly found grievous & doe Judge for the\r\n     future will be found intollerable if not altered. O{r}\r\n     minister, Mr. Mather . . . & we ourselves are much discouraged\r\n     as judging the Plantation will be spoiled if thes proprietors\r\n     may not be begged, or will not be bought up on very easy terms\r\n     outt of their Right . . . Butt as long as the maine of the\r\n     plantation Lies in men's hands that can't improve it\r\n     themselves, neither are ever like to putt such tenants on to\r\n     it as shall be likely to advance the good of y{e} place in\r\n     Civill or sacred Respects; he, ourselves, and all others that\r\n     think of going to it, are much discouraged.[59:1]\r\n\r\nWoodstock, later a Connecticut town, was settled under a grant in the\r\nNipmuc country made to the town of Roxbury. The settlers, who located\r\ntheir farms near the trading post about which the Indians still\r\ncollected, were called the \"go-ers,\" while the \"stayers\" were those who\r\nremained in Roxbury, and retained half of the new grant; but it should\r\nbe added that they paid the go-ers a sum of money to facilitate the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThis absentee proprietorship and the commercial attitude toward the\r\nlands of new towns became more evident in succeeding years of the\r\neighteenth century. Leicester, for example, was confirmed by the General\r\nCourt in 1713. The twenty shares were divided among twenty-two\r\nproprietors, including Jeremiah Dummer, Paul Dudley (Attorney-General),\r\nWilliam Dudley (like Paul a son of the Governor, Joseph Dudley), Thomas\r\nHutchinson (father of the later Governor), John Clark (the political\r\nleader), and Samuel Sewall (son of the Chief Justice). These were all\r\nmen of influence, and none of the proprietors became inhabitants of\r\nLeicester. The proprietors tried to induce the fifty families, whose\r\nsettlement was one of the conditions on which the grant was made, to\r\noccupy the eastern half of the township reserving the rest as their\r\nabsolute property.[59:2]\r\n\r\nThe author of a currency tract, in 1716, entitled \"Some Considerations\r\nupon the Several Sorts of Banks,\" remarks that formerly, when land was\r\neasy to be obtained, good men came over as indentured servants; but now,\r\nhe says, they are runaways, thieves, and disorderly persons. The remedy\r\nfor this, in his opinion, would be to induce servants to come over by\r\noffering them homes when the terms of indenture should expire.[60:1] He\r\ntherefore advocates that townships should be laid out four or five miles\r\nsquare in which grants of fifty or sixty acres could be made to\r\nservants.[60:2] Concern over the increase of negro slaves in\r\nMassachusetts seems to have been the reason for this proposal. It\r\nindicates that the current practice in disposing of the lands did not\r\nprovide for the poorer people.\r\n\r\nBut Massachusetts did not follow this suggestion of a homestead policy.\r\nOn the contrary, the desire to locate towns to create continuous lines\r\nof settlement along the roads between the disconnected frontiers and to\r\nprotect boundary claims by granting tiers of towns in the disputed\r\ntract, as well, no doubt, as pressure from financial interests, led the\r\nGeneral Court between 1715 and 1762 to dispose of the remaining public\r\ndomain of Massachusetts under conditions that made speculation and\r\ncolonization by capitalists important factors.[60:3] When in 1762\r\nMassachusetts sold a group of townships in the Berkshires to the highest\r\nbidders (by whole townships),[60:4] the transfer from the\r\nsocial-religious to the economic conception was complete, and the\r\nfrontier was deeply influenced by the change to \"land mongering.\"\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, there was an increasing recognition of the\r\nreligious and social element in settling the frontier, due in part, no\r\ndoubt, to a desire to provide for the preservation of eastern ideals and\r\ninfluences in the West. Provisions for reserving lands within the\r\ngranted townships for the support of an approved minister, and for\r\nschools, appear in the seventeenth century and become a common feature\r\nof the grants for frontier towns in the eighteenth.[61:1] This practice\r\nwith respect to the New England frontier became the foundation for the\r\nsystem of grants of land from the public domain for the support of\r\ncommon schools and state universities by the federal government from its\r\nbeginning, and has been profoundly influential in later Western States.\r\n\r\nAnother ground for discontent over land questions was furnished by the\r\nsystem of granting lands within the town by the commoners. The principle\r\nwhich in many, if not all, cases guided the proprietors in distributing\r\nthe town lots is familiar and is well stated in the Lancaster town\r\nrecords (1653):\r\n\r\n     And, whereas Lotts are Now Laid out for the most part Equally\r\n     to Rich and poore, Partly to keepe the Towne from Scatering to\r\n     farr, and partly out of Charitie and Respect to men of meaner\r\n     estate, yet that Equallitie (which is the rule of God) may be\r\n     observed, we Covenant and Agree, That in a second Devition and\r\n     so through all other Devitions of Land the mater shall be\r\n     drawne as neere to _equallitie according to mens estates_ as\r\n     wee are able to doe, That he which hath now more then his\r\n     estate Deserveth in home Lotts and entervale Lotts shall haue\r\n     so much Less: and he that hath Less then his estate Deserveth\r\n     shall haue so much more.[62:1]\r\n\r\nThis peculiar doctrine of \"equality\" had early in the history of the\r\ncolony created discontents. Winthrop explained the principle which\r\ngoverned himself and his colleagues in the case of the Boston committee\r\nof 1634 by saying that their divisions were arranged \"partly to prevent\r\nthe neglect of trades.\" This is a pregnant idea; it underlay much of the\r\nlater opposition of New England as a manufacturing section to the free\r\nhomestead or cheap land policy, demanded by the West and by the labor\r\nparty, in the national public domain. The migration of labor to free\r\nlands meant that higher wages must be paid to those who remained. The\r\nuse of the town lands by the established classes to promote an approved\r\nform of society naturally must have had some effect on migration.\r\n\r\nBut a more effective source of disputes was with respect to the relation\r\nof the town proprietors to the public domain of the town in contrast\r\nwith the non-proprietors as a class. The need of keeping the town\r\nmeeting and the proprietors' meeting separate in the old towns in\r\nearlier years was not so great as it was when the new-comers became\r\nnumerous. In an increasing degree these new-comers were either not\r\ngranted lands at all, or were not admitted to the body of proprietors\r\nwith rights in the possession of the undivided town lands. Contentions\r\non the part of the town meeting that it had the right of dealing with\r\nthe town lands occasionally appear, significantly, in the frontier towns\r\nof Haverhill, Massachusetts, Simsbury, Connecticut, and in the towns of\r\nthe Connecticut Valley.[63:1] Jonathan Edwards, in 1751, declared that\r\nthere had been in Northampton for forty or fifty years \"two parties\r\nsomewhat like the court and country parties of England. . . . The first\r\nparty embraced the great proprietors of land, and the parties concerned\r\nabout land and other matters.\"[63:2] The tendency to divide up the\r\ncommon lands among the proprietors in individual possession did not\r\nbecome marked until the eighteenth century; but the exclusion of some\r\nfrom possession of the town lands and the \"equality\" in allotment\r\nfavoring men with already large estates must have attracted ambitious\r\nmen who were not of the favored class to join in the movement to new\r\ntowns. Religious dissensions would combine to make frontier society as\r\nit formed early in the eighteenth century more and more democratic,\r\ndissatisfied with the existing order, and less respectful of authority.\r\nWe shall not understand the relative radicalism of parts of the\r\nBerkshires, Vermont and interior New Hampshire without enquiry into the\r\ndegree in which the control over the lands by a proprietary monopoly\r\naffected the men who settled on the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe final aspect of this frontier to be examined, is the attitude of the\r\nconservatives of the older sections towards this movement of westward\r\nadvance. President Dwight in the era of the War of 1812 was very\r\ncritical of the \"foresters,\" but saw in such a movement a safety valve\r\nto the institutions of New England by allowing the escape of the\r\nexplosive advocates of \"Innovation.\"[63:3]\r\n\r\nCotton Mather is perhaps not a typical representative of the\r\nconservative sentiment at the close of the seventeenth century, but his\r\nwritings may partly reflect the attitude of Boston Bay toward New\r\nEngland's first Western frontier. Writing in 1694 of \"Wonderful Passages\r\nwhich have Occurred, First in the Protections and then in the\r\nAfflictions of New England,\" he says:\r\n\r\n     One while the Enclosing of _Commons_ hath made Neighbours,\r\n     that should have been like Sheep, to _Bite and devour one\r\n     another_. . . . Again, Do our _Old_ People, any of them _Go\r\n     Out_ from the Institutions of God, Swarming into New\r\n     Settlements, where they and their Untaught Families are like\r\n     to _Perish for Lack of Vision_? They that have done so,\r\n     heretofore, have to their Cost found, that they were got unto\r\n     the _Wrong side of the Hedge_, in their doing so. Think, here\r\n     _Should this be done any more?_ We read of Balaam, in Num. 22,\r\n     23. He was to his Damage, _driven to the_ Wall, when he would\r\n     needs make an unlawful Salley forth after the _Gain_ of this\r\n     World. . . . Why, when men, for the Sake of Earthly Gain,\r\n     would be _going out_ into the _Warm_ Sun, they drive _Through\r\n     the Wall_, and the _Angel of the Lord_ becomes their Enemy.\r\n\r\nIn his essay on \"Frontiers Well-Defended\" (1707) Mather assures the\r\npioneers that they \"dwell in a Hatsarmaneth,\" a place of \"tawney\r\nserpents,\" are \"inhabitants of the Valley of Achor,\" and are \"the Poor\r\nof this World.\" There may be significance in his assertion: \"It is\r\nremarkable to see that when the Unchurched Villages, have been so many\r\nof them, _utterly broken up_, in the _War_, that has been upon us, those\r\nthat have had _Churches_ regularly formed in them, have generally been\r\nunder a more _sensible Protection_ of Heaven.\" \"Sirs,\" he says, \"a\r\n_Church-State_ well form'd may fortify you wonderfully!\" He recommends\r\nabstention from profane swearing, furious cursing, Sabbath breaking,\r\nunchastity, dishonesty, robbing of God by defrauding the ministers of\r\ntheir dues, drunkenness, and revels and he reminds them that even the\r\nIndians have family prayers! Like his successors who solicited\r\nmissionary contributions for the salvation of the frontier in the\r\nMississippi Valley during the forties of the nineteenth century, this\r\nearly spokesman for New England laid stress upon teaching anti-popery,\r\nparticularly in view of the captivity that might await them.\r\n\r\nIn summing up, we find many of the traits of later frontiers in this\r\nearly prototype, the Massachusetts frontier. It lies at the edge of the\r\nIndian country and tends to advance. It calls out militant qualities and\r\nreveals the imprint of wilderness conditions upon the psychology and\r\nmorals as well as upon the institutions of the people. It demands common\r\ndefense and thus becomes a factor for consolidation. It is built on the\r\nbasis of a preliminary fur trade, and is settled by the combined and\r\nsometimes antagonistic forces of eastern men of property (the absentee\r\nproprietors) and the democratic pioneers. The East attempted to regulate\r\nand control it. Individualistic and democratic tendencies were\r\nemphasized both by the wilderness conditions and, probably, by the prior\r\ncontentions between the proprietors and non-proprietors of the towns\r\nfrom which settlers moved to the frontier. Removal away from the control\r\nof the customary usages of the older communities and from the\r\nconservative influence of the body of the clergy, increased the\r\ninnovating tendency. Finally the towns were regarded by at least one\r\nprominent representative of the established order in the East, as an\r\nundesirable place for the re-location of the pillars of society. The\r\ntemptation to look upon the frontier as a field for investment was\r\nviewed by the clergy as a danger to the \"institutions of God.\" The\r\nfrontier was \"the Wrong side of the Hedge.\"\r\n\r\nBut to this \"wrong side of the hedge\" New England men continued to\r\nmigrate. The frontier towns of 1695 were hardly more than suburbs of\r\nBoston. The frontier of a century later included New England's colonies\r\nin Vermont, Western New York, the Wyoming Valley, the Connecticut\r\nReserve, and the Ohio Company's settlement in the Old Northwest\r\nTerritory. By the time of the Civil War the frontier towns of New\r\nEngland had occupied the great prairie zone of the Middle West and were\r\neven planted in Mormon Utah and in parts of the Pacific Coast. New\r\nEngland's sons had become the organizers of a Greater New England in the\r\nWest, captains of industry, political leaders, founders of educational\r\nsystems, and prophets of religion, in a section that was to influence\r\nthe ideals and shape the destiny of the nation in ways to which the eyes\r\nof men like Cotton Mather were sealed.[66:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39:1] Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, April,\r\n1914, xvii, 250-271.

The oldest West\r\nwas the Atlantic coast. Roughly speaking, it took a century of Indian\r\nfighting and forest felling for the colonial settlements to expand into\r\nthe interior to a distance of about a hundred miles from the coast.\r\nIndeed, some stretches were hardly touched in that period. This conquest\r\nof the nearest wilderness in the course of the seventeenth century and\r\nin the early years of the eighteenth, gave control of the maritime\r\nsection of the nation and made way for the new movement of westward\r\nexpansion which I propose to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Winning of the West,\" Roosevelt dealt chiefly with the region\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies, and with the period of the later eighteenth\r\ncentury, although he prefaced his account with an excellent chapter\r\ndescribing the backwoodsmen of the Alleghanies and their social\r\nconditions from 1769 to 1774. It is important to notice, however, that\r\nhe is concerned with a backwoods society already formed; that he ignores\r\nthe New England frontier and its part in the winning of the West, and\r\ndoes not recognize that there was a West to be won between New England\r\nand the Great Lakes. In short, he is interested in the winning of the\r\nWest beyond the Alleghanies by the southern half of the frontier folk.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a western area intermediate between the coastal\r\ncolonial settlements of the seventeenth century and the trans-Alleghany\r\nsettlements of the latter portion of the eighteenth century. This\r\nsection I propose to isolate and discuss under the name of the Old West,\r\nand in the period from about 1676 to 1763. It includes the back country\r\nof New England, the Mohawk Valley, the Great Valley of Pennsylvania, the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and the Piedmont--that is, the interior or upland\r\nportion of the South, lying between the Alleghanies and the head of\r\nnavigation of the Atlantic rivers marked by the \"fall line.\"[68:1]\r\n\r\nIn this region, and in these years, are to be found the beginnings of\r\nmuch that is characteristic in Western society, for the Atlantic coast\r\nwas in such close touch with Europe that its frontier experience was\r\nsoon counteracted, and it developed along other lines. It is unfortunate\r\nthat the colonial back country appealed so long to historians solely in\r\nconnection with the colonial wars, for the development of its society,\r\nits institutions and mental attitude all need study. Its history has\r\nbeen dealt with in separate fragments, by states, or towns, or in\r\ndiscussions of special phases, such as German and Scotch-Irish\r\nimmigration. The Old West as a whole can be appreciated only by\r\nobliterating the state boundaries which conceal its unity, by\r\ncorrelating the special and fragmentary studies, and by filling the gaps\r\nin the material for understanding the formation of its society. The\r\npresent paper is rather a reconnaissance than a conquest of the field, a\r\nprogram for study of the Old West rather than an exposition of it.\r\n\r\nThe end of the period proposed may be placed about 1763, and the\r\nbeginning between 1676 and 1700. The termination of the period is marked\r\nby the Peace of Paris in 1763, and the royal proclamation of that year\r\nforbidding settlement beyond the Alleghanies. By this time the\r\nsettlement of the Old West was fairly accomplished, and new advances\r\nwere soon made into the \"Western Waters\" beyond the mountains and into\r\nthe interior of Vermont and New Hampshire. The isolation of the\r\ntransmontane settlements, and the special conditions and doctrines of\r\nthe Revolutionary era during which they were formed, make a natural\r\ndistinction between the period of which I am to speak and the later\r\nextension of the West.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the period is necessarily an indeterminate date, owing\r\nto the different times of colonizing the coastal areas which served as\r\nbases of operations in the westward advance. The most active movements\r\ninto the Old West occurred after 1730. But in 1676 New England, having\r\nclosed the exhausting struggle with the Indians, known as King Philip's\r\nWar, could regard her established settlements as secure, and go on to\r\ncomplete her possession of the interior. This she did in the midst of\r\nconflicts with the exterior Indian tribes which invaded her frontiers\r\nfrom New York and Canada during the French and Indian wars from 1690 to\r\n1760, and under frontier conditions different from the conditions of the\r\nearlier Puritan colonization. In 1676, Virginia was passing through\r\nIndian fighting--keenest along the fall line, where the frontier\r\nlay--and also experiencing a social revolt which resulted in the defeat\r\nof the democratic forces that sought to stay the progress of\r\naristocratic control in the colony.[70:1] The date marks the end of the\r\nperiod when the Virginia tidewater could itself be regarded as a\r\nfrontier region, and consequently the beginning of a more special\r\ninterest in the interior.\r\n\r\nLet us first examine the northern part of the movement into the back\r\ncountry. The expansion of New England into the vacant spaces of its own\r\nsection, in the period we have chosen for discussion, resulted in the\r\nformation of an interior society which contrasted in many ways with that\r\nof the coast, and which has a special significance in Western history,\r\nin that it was this interior New England people who settled the Greater\r\nNew England in central and western New York, the Wyoming Valley, the\r\nConnecticut Reserve of Ohio, and much of the prairie areas of the Old\r\nNorthwest. It is important to realize that the Old West included\r\ninterior New England.\r\n\r\nThe situation in New England at the close of the seventeenth century is\r\nindicated by the Massachusetts act of 1694 enumerating eleven towns,\r\nthen on the frontier and exposed to raids, none of which might be\r\nvoluntarily deserted without leave of the governor and council, on\r\npenalty of loss of their freeholds by the landowners, or fine of other\r\ninhabitants.[70:2]\r\n\r\nThus these frontier settlers were made substantially garrisons, or \"mark\r\ncolonies.\" Crowded into the palisades of the town, and obliged in spite\r\nof their poverty to bear the brunt of Indian attack, their hardships are\r\nillustrated in the manly but pathetic letters of Deerfield's minister,\r\nMr. Williams,[70:3] in 1704. Parkman succinctly describes the general\r\nconditions in these words:[70:4]\r\n\r\n     The exposed frontier of New England was between two and three\r\n     hundred miles long, and consisted of farms and hamlets loosely\r\n     scattered through an almost impervious forest. . . . Even in\r\n     so-called villages the houses were far apart, because, except\r\n     on the seashore, the people lived by farming. Such as were\r\n     able to do so fenced their dwellings with palisades, or built\r\n     them of solid timber, with loopholes, a projecting upper story\r\n     like a block house, and sometimes a flanker at one or more of\r\n     the corners. In the more considerable settlements the largest\r\n     of these fortified houses was occupied in time of danger by\r\n     armed men and served as a place of refuge for the neighbors.\r\n\r\nInto these places, in days of alarm, were crowded the outlying settlers,\r\njust as was the case in later times in the Kentucky \"stations.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of such frontier conditions, the outlying towns continued to\r\nmultiply. Between 1720 and the middle of the century, settlement crept\r\nup the Housatonic and its lateral valley into the Berkshires. About 1720\r\nLitchfield was established; in 1725, Sheffield; in 1730, Great\r\nBarrington; and in 1735 a road was cut and towns soon established\r\nbetween Westfield and these Housatonic settlements, thus uniting them\r\nwith the older extensions along the Connecticut and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nIn this period, scattered and sometimes unwelcome Scotch-Irish\r\nsettlements were established, such as that at Londonderry, New\r\nHampshire, and in the Berkshires, as well as in the region won in King\r\nPhilip's War from the Nipmucks, whither there came also Huguenots.[72:1]\r\n\r\nIn King George's War, the Connecticut River settlers found their\r\nfrontier protection in such rude stockades as those at the sites of\r\nKeene, of Charlestown, New Hampshire (Number Four), Fort Shirley at the\r\nhead of Deerfield River (Heath), and Fort Pelham (Rowe); while Fort\r\nMassachusetts (Adams) guarded the Hoosac gateway to the Hoosatonic\r\nValley. These frontier garrisons and the self-defense of the\r\nbackwoodsmen of New England are well portrayed in the pages of\r\nParkman.[72:2] At the close of the war, settlement again expanded into\r\nthe Berkshires, where Lennox, West Hoosac (Williamstown), and Pittsfield\r\nwere established in the middle of the century. Checked by the fighting\r\nin the last French and Indian War, the frontier went forward after the\r\nPeace of Paris (1763) at an exceptional rate, especially into Vermont\r\nand interior New Hampshire. An anonymous writer gives a contemporary\r\nview of the situation on the eve of the Revolution:[72:3]\r\n\r\n     The richest parts remaining to be granted are on the northern\r\n     branches of the Connecticut river, towards Crown Point where\r\n     are great districts of fertile soil still unsettled. The North\r\n     part of New Hampshire, the province of Maine, and the\r\n     territory of Sagadahock have but few settlements in them\r\n     compared with the tracts yet unsettled. . . .\r\n\r\n     I should further observe that these tracts have since the\r\n     peace [_i. e._, 1763], been settling pretty fast: farms on the\r\n     river Connecticut are every day extending beyond the old fort\r\n     Dummer, for near thirty miles; and will in a few years reach\r\n     to Kohasser which is nearly two hundred miles; not that such\r\n     an extent will be one-tenth settled, but the new-comers do not\r\n     fix near their neighbors, and go on regularly, but take spots\r\n     that please them best, though twenty or thirty miles beyond\r\n     any others. This to people of a sociable disposition in Europe\r\n     would appear very strange, but the Americans do not regard the\r\n     near neighborhood of other farmers; twenty or thirty miles by\r\n     water they esteem no distance in matters of this sort; besides\r\n     in a country that promises well the intermediate space is not\r\n     long in filling up. Between Connecticut river and Lake\r\n     Champlain upon Otter Creek, and all along Lake Sacrament\r\n     [George] and the rivers that fall into it, and the whole\r\n     length of Wood Creek, are numerous settlements made since the\r\n     peace.[73:1]\r\n\r\nFor nearly a hundred years, therefore, New England communities had been\r\npushed out to new frontiers in the intervals between the almost\r\ncontinuous wars with the French and Indians. Probably the most\r\ndistinctive feature in this frontier was the importance of the community\r\ntype of settlement; in other words, of the towns, with their Puritan\r\nideals in education, morals, and religion. This has always been a matter\r\nof pride to the statesmen and annalists of New England, as is\r\nillustrated by these words of Holland in his \"Western Massachusetts,\"\r\ncommenting on the settlement of the Connecticut Valley in villages,\r\nwhereby in his judgment morality, education, and urbanity were\r\npreserved:\r\n\r\n     The influence of this policy can only be fully appreciated\r\n     when standing by the side of the solitary settler's hut in the\r\n     West, where even an Eastern man has degenerated to a boor in\r\n     manners, where his children have grown up uneducated, and\r\n     where the Sabbath has become an unknown day, and religion and\r\n     its obligations have ceased to exercise control upon the heart\r\n     and life.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the real value of the community type of settlement, its\r\nestablishment in New England was intimately connected both with the\r\nCongregational religious organization and with the land system of the\r\ncolonies of that section, under which the colonial governments made\r\ngrants--not in tracts to individuals, but in townships to groups of\r\nproprietors who in turn assigned lands to the inhabitants without cost.\r\nThe typical form of establishing a town was as follows: On application\r\nof an approved body of men, desiring to establish a new settlement, the\r\ncolonial General Court would appoint a committee to view the desired\r\nland and report on its fitness; an order for the grant would then issue,\r\nin varying areas, not far from the equivalent of six miles square. In\r\nthe eighteenth century especially, it was common to reserve certain lots\r\nof the town for the support of schools and the ministry. This was the\r\norigin of that very important feature of Western society, federal land\r\ngrants for schools and colleges.[74:1] The General Courts also made\r\nregulations regarding the common lands, the terms for admitting\r\ninhabitants, etc., and thus kept a firm hand upon the social structure\r\nof the new settlements as they formed on the frontier.\r\n\r\nThis practice, seen in its purity in the seventeenth century\r\nespecially, was markedly different from the practices of other colonies\r\nin the settlement of their back lands. For during most of the period New\r\nEngland did not use her wild lands, or public domain, as a source of\r\nrevenue by sale to individuals or to companies, with the reservation of\r\nquit-rents; nor attract individual settlers by \"head rights,\" or\r\nfifty-acre grants, after the Virginia type; nor did the colonies of the\r\nNew England group often make extensive grants to individuals, on the\r\nground of special services, or because of influence with the government,\r\nor on the theory that the grantee would introduce settlers on his grant.\r\nThey donated their lands to groups of men who became town proprietors\r\nfor the purpose of establishing communities. These proprietors were\r\nsupposed to hold the lands in trust, to be assigned to inhabitants under\r\nrestraints to ensure the persistence of Puritan ideals.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the seventeenth century the proprietors awarded lands to\r\nthe new-comers in accordance with this theory. But as density of\r\nsettlement increased, and lands grew scarce in the older towns, the\r\nproprietors began to assert their legal right to the unoccupied lands\r\nand to refuse to share them with inhabitants who were not of the body of\r\nproprietors. The distinction resulted in class conflicts in the towns,\r\nespecially in the eighteenth century,[75:1] over the ownership and\r\ndisposal of the common lands.\r\n\r\nThe new settlements, by a process of natural selection, would afford\r\nopportunity to the least contented, whether because of grievances, or\r\nambitions, to establish themselves. This tended to produce a Western\r\nflavor in the towns on the frontier. But it was not until the original\r\nideals of the land system began to change, that the opportunity to make\r\nnew settlements for such reasons became common. As the economic and\r\npolitical ideal replaced the religious and social ideal, in the\r\nconditions under which new towns could be established, this became more\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSuch a change was in progress in the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury and during the eighteenth. In 1713, 1715, and 1727,\r\nMassachusetts determined upon a policy of locating towns in advance of\r\nsettlement, to protect her boundary claims. In 1736 she laid out five\r\ntowns near the New Hampshire border, and a year earlier opened four\r\ncontiguous towns to connect her Housatonic and Connecticut Valley\r\nsettlements.[76:1] Grants in non-adjacent regions were sometimes made to\r\nold towns, the proprietors of which sold them to those who wished to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThe history of the town of Litchfield illustrates the increasing\r\nimportance of the economic factor. At a time when Connecticut feared\r\nthat Andros might dispose of the public lands to the disadvantage of the\r\ncolony, the legislature granted a large part of Western Connecticut to\r\nthe towns of Hartford and Windsor, _pro forma_, as a means of\r\nwithdrawing the lands from his hands. But these towns refused to give up\r\nthe lands after the danger had passed, and proceeded to sell part of\r\nthem.[76:2] Riots occurred when the colonial authorities attempted to\r\nassert possession, and the matter was at length compromised in 1719 by\r\nallowing Litchfield to be settled in accordance with the town grants,\r\nwhile the colony reserved the larger part of northwestern Connecticut.\r\nIn 1737 the colony disposed of its last unlocated lands by sale in lots.\r\nIn 1762 Massachusetts sold a group of entire townships in the Berkshires\r\nto the highest bidders.[77:1]\r\n\r\nBut the most striking illustration of the tendency, is afforded by the\r\n\"New Hampshire grants\" of Governor Wentworth, who, chiefly in the years\r\nabout 1760, made grants of a hundred and thirty towns west of the\r\nConnecticut, in what is now the State of Vermont, but which was then in\r\ndispute between New Hampshire and New York. These grants, while in form\r\nmuch like other town grants, were disposed of for cash, chiefly to\r\nspeculators who hastened to sell their rights to the throngs of\r\nland-seekers who, after the peace, began to pour into the Green Mountain\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to point out how this would affect the movement of\r\nWestern settlement in respect to individualistic speculation in public\r\nlands; how it would open a career to the land jobbers, as well as to the\r\nnatural leaders in the competitive movement for acquiring the best\r\nlands, for laying out town sites and building up new communities under\r\n\"boom\" conditions. The migratory tendency of New Englanders was\r\nincreased by this gradual change in its land policy; the attachment to a\r\nlocality was diminished. The later years showed increasing emphasis by\r\nNew England upon individual success, greater respect for the self-made\r\nman who, in the midst of opportunities under competitive conditions,\r\nachieved superiority. The old dominance of town settlement, village\r\nmoral police, and traditional class control gave way slowly. Settlement\r\nin communities and rooted Puritan habits and ideals had enduring\r\ninfluences in the regions settled by New Englanders; but it was in this\r\nOld West, in the years just before the Revolution, that individualism\r\nbegan to play an important rôle, along with the traditional habit of\r\nexpanding in organized communities.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Vermont towns revealed more fully than before, the\r\ncapability of New Englanders to become democratic pioneers, under\r\ncharacteristic frontier conditions. Their economic life was simple and\r\nself-sufficing. They readily adopted lynch law (the use of the \"birch\r\nseal\" is familiar to readers of Vermont history) to protect their land\r\ntitles in the troubled times when these \"Green Mountain Boys\" resisted\r\nNew York's assertion of authority. They later became an independent\r\nRevolutionary state with frontier directness, and in very many respects\r\ntheir history in the Revolutionary epoch is similar to that of settlers\r\nin Kentucky and Tennessee, both in assertion of the right to independent\r\nself government and in a frontier separatism.[78:1] Vermont may be\r\nregarded as the culmination of the frontier movement which I have been\r\ndescribing in New England.\r\n\r\nBy this time two distinct New Englands existed--the one coastal, and\r\ndominated by commercial interests and the established congregational\r\nchurches; the other a primitive agricultural area, democratic in\r\nprinciple, and with various sects increasingly indifferent to the fear\r\nof \"innovation\" which the dominant classes of the old communities felt.\r\nAlready speculative land companies had begun New England settlements in\r\nthe Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania, as well as on the lower Mississippi;\r\nand New England missions among the Indians, such as that at Stockbridge,\r\nwere beginning the noteworthy religious and educational expansion of the\r\nsection to the west.\r\n\r\nThat this movement of expansion had been chiefly from south to north,\r\nalong the river valleys, should not conceal from us the fact that it was\r\nin essential characteristics a Western movement, especially in the\r\nsocial traits that were developing. Even the men who lived in the long\r\nline of settlements on the Maine coast, under frontier conditions, and\r\nremote from the older centers of New England, developed traits and a\r\ndemocratic spirit that relate them closely to the Westerners, in spite\r\nof the fact that Maine is \"down east\" by preëminence.[79:1]\r\n\r\nThe frontier of the Middle region in this period of the formation of the\r\nOld West, was divided into two parts, which happen to coincide with the\r\ncolonies of New York and Pennsylvania. In the latter colony the trend of\r\nsettlement was into the Great Valley, and so on to the Southern uplands;\r\nwhile the advance of settlement in New York was like that of New\r\nEngland, chiefly northward, following the line of Hudson River.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson and the Mohawk constituted the area of the Old West in this\r\npart of the eighteenth century. With them were associated the Wallkill,\r\ntributary to the Hudson, and Cherry Valley near the Mohawk, along the\r\nsources of the Susquehanna. The Berkshires walled the Hudson in to the\r\neast; the Adirondacks and the Catskills to the west. Where the Mohawk\r\nValley penetrated between the mountainous areas, the Iroquois Indians\r\nwere too formidable for advance on such a slender line. Nothing but\r\ndense settlement along the narrow strip of the Hudson, if even that,\r\ncould have furnished the necessary momentum for overcoming the Indian\r\nbarrier; and this pressure was lacking, for the population was\r\ncomparatively sparse in contrast with the task to be performed. What\r\nmost needs discussion in the case of New York, therefore, is not the\r\nhistory of expansion as in other sections, but the absence of expansive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe fur-trade had led the way up the Hudson, and made beginnings of\r\nsettlements at strategic points near the confluence of the Mohawk. But\r\nthe fur-trader was not followed by a tide of pioneers. One of the most\r\nimportant factors in restraining density of population in New York, in\r\nretarding the settlement of its frontier, and in determining the\r\nconditions there, was the land system of that colony.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the patroon grants along the lower Hudson, great\r\nestates had been the common form of land tenure. Rensselaerswyck reached\r\nat one time over seven hundred thousand acres. These great patroon\r\nestates were confirmed by the English governors, who in their turn\r\nfollowed a similar policy. By 1732 two and one-half million acres were\r\nengrossed in manorial grants.[80:1] In 1764, Governor Colden wrote[80:2]\r\nthat three of the extravagant grants contain,\r\n\r\n     as the proprietors claim, above a million acres each, several\r\n     others above 200,000. * * * Although these grants contain a\r\n     great part of the province, they are made in trifling\r\n     acknowledgements. The far greater part of them still remain\r\n     uncultivated, without any benefit to the community, and are\r\n     likewise a discouragement to the settling and improving the\r\n     lands in the neighborhood of them, for from the uncertainty of\r\n     their boundaries, the patentees of these great tracts are\r\n     daily enlarging their pretensions, and by tedious and most\r\n     expensive law suits, distress and ruin poor families who have\r\n     taken out grants near them.\r\n\r\nHe adds that \"the proprietors of the great tracts are not only freed\r\nfrom the quit-rents, which the other landholders in the province pay,\r\nbut by their influence in the assembly are freed from every other public\r\ntax on their lands.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1769 it was estimated that at least five-sixths of the inhabitants of\r\nWestchester County lived within the bounds of the great manors\r\nthere.[81:1] In Albany County the Livingston manor spread over seven\r\nmodern townships, and the great Van Rensselaer manor stretched\r\ntwenty-four by twenty-eight miles along the Hudson; while still farther,\r\non the Mohawk, were the vast possessions of Sir William Johnson.[81:2]\r\n\r\nIt was not simply that the grants were extensive, but that the policy\r\nof the proprietors favored the leasing rather than the sale of the\r\nlands--frequently also of the stock, and taking payment in shares. It\r\nfollowed that settlers preferred to go to frontiers where a more liberal\r\nland policy prevailed. At one time it seemed possible that the tide of\r\nGerman settlement, which finally sought Pennsylvania and the up-country\r\nof the South, might flow into New York. In 1710, Governor Hunter\r\npurchased a tract in Livingston's manor and located nearly fifteen\r\nhundred Palatines on it to produce naval stores.[82:1] But the attempt\r\nsoon failed; the Germans applied to the Indians on Schoharie Creek, a\r\nbranch of the Mohawk, for a grant of land and migrated there, only to\r\nfind that the governor had already granted the land. Again were the\r\nvillages broken up, some remaining and some moving farther up the\r\nMohawk, where they and accessions to their number established the\r\nfrontier settlements about Palatine Bridge, in the region where, in the\r\nRevolution, Herkimer led these German frontiersmen to stem the British\r\nattack in the battle of Oriskany. They constituted the most effective\r\nmilitary defense of Mohawk Valley. Still another portion took their way\r\nacross to the waters of the Susquehanna, and at Tulpehockon Creek began\r\nan important center of German settlement in the Great Valley of\r\nPennsylvania.[82:2]\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect of the history of the movement into the\r\nfrontier of New York at this period, therefore, was the evidence which\r\nit afforded that in the competition for settlement between colonies\r\npossessing a vast area of vacant land, those which imposed feudal\r\ntenures and undemocratic restraints, and which exploited settlers, were\r\ncertain to lose.\r\n\r\nThe manorial practice gave a bad name to New York as a region for\r\nsettlement, which not even the actual opportunities in certain parts of\r\nthe colony could counteract. The diplomacy of New York governors during\r\nthis period of the Old West, in securing a protectorate over the Six\r\nNations and a consequent claim to their territory, and in holding them\r\naloof from France, constituted the most effective contribution of that\r\ncolony to the movement of American expansion. When lands of these tribes\r\nwere obtained after Sullivan's expedition in the Revolution (in which\r\nNew England soldiers played a prominent part), it was by the New England\r\ninundation into this interior that they were colonized. And it was under\r\nconditions like those prevailing in the later years of the expansion of\r\nsettlements in New England itself, that this settlement of interior and\r\nwestern New York was effected.\r\n\r\nThe result was, that New York became divided into two distinct peoples:\r\nthe dwellers along Hudson Valley, and the Yankee pioneers of the\r\ninterior. But the settlement of central and western New York, like the\r\nsettlement of Vermont, is a story that belongs to the era in which the\r\ntrans-Alleghany West was occupied.\r\n\r\nWe can best consider the settlement of the share of the Old West which\r\nis located in Pennsylvania as a part of the migration which occupied the\r\nSouthern Uplands, and before entering upon this it will be advantageous\r\nto survey that part of the movement toward the interior which proceeded\r\nwestward from the coast. First let us observe the conditions at the\r\neastern edge of these uplands, along the fall line in Virginia, in the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century, in order that the process and\r\nthe significance of the movement may be better understood.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of Bacon's Rebellion, in Virginia, strenuous efforts\r\nwere made to protect the frontier line which ran along the falls of the\r\nriver, against the attacks of Indians. This \"fall line,\" as the\r\ngeographers call it, marking the head of navigation, and thus the\r\nboundary of the maritime or lowland South, runs from the site of\r\nWashington, through Richmond, and on to Raleigh, North Carolina, and\r\nColumbia, South Carolina. Virginia having earliest advanced thus far to\r\nthe interior, found it necessary in the closing years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury to draw a military frontier along this line. As early as 1675 a\r\nstatute was enacted,[84:1] providing that paid troops of five hundred\r\nmen should be drawn from the midland and most secure parts of the\r\ncountry and placed on the \"heads of the rivers\" and other places\r\nfronting upon the Indians. What was meant by the \"heads of the rivers,\"\r\nis shown by the fact that several of these forts were located either at\r\nthe falls of the rivers or just above tidewater, as follows: one on the\r\nlower Potomac in Stafford County; one near the falls of the\r\nRappahannock; one on the Mattapony; one on the Pamunky; one at the falls\r\nof the James (near the site of Richmond); one near the falls of the\r\nAppomattox, and others on the Blackwater, the Nansemond, and the Accomac\r\npeninsula, all in the eastern part of Virginia.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1679, similar provision was made,[84:2] and an especially\r\ninteresting act was passed, making _quasi_ manorial grants to Major\r\nLawrence Smith and Captain William Byrd, \"to seate certain lands at the\r\nhead [falls] of Rappahannock and James river\" respectively. This scheme\r\nfailed for lack of approval by the authorities in England.[84:3] But\r\nByrd at the falls of the James near the present site of Richmond,\r\nRobert Beverley on the Rappahannock, and other frontier commanders on\r\nthe York and Potomac, continued to undertake colonial defense. The\r\nsystem of mounted rangers was established in 1691, by which a\r\nlieutenant, eleven soldiers, and two Indians at the \"heads\" or falls of\r\neach great river were to scout for enemy,[85:1] and the Indian boundary\r\nline was strictly defined.\r\n\r\nBy the opening years of the eighteenth century (1701), the assembly of\r\nVirginia had reached the conclusion that settlement would be the best\r\nmeans of protecting the frontiers, and that the best way of \"settling in\r\nco-habitations upon the said land frontiers within this government will\r\nbe by encouragements to induce societies of men to undertake the\r\nsame.\"[85:2] It was declared to be inexpedient to have less than twenty\r\nfighting men in each \"society,\" and provision was made for a land grant\r\nto be given to these societies (or towns) not less than 10,000 nor more\r\nthan 30,000 acres upon any of the frontiers, to be held in common by the\r\nsociety. The power of ordering and managing these lands, and the\r\nsettling and planting of them, was to remain in the society. Virginia\r\nwas to pay the cost of survey, also quit-rents for the first twenty\r\nyears for the two-hundred-acre tract as the site of the \"co-habitation.\"\r\nWithin this two hundred acres each member was to have a half-acre lot\r\nfor living upon, and a right to two hundred acres next adjacent, until\r\nthe thirty thousand acres were taken up. The members of the society\r\nwere exempt from taxes for twenty years, and from the requirements of\r\nmilitary duty except such as they imposed upon themselves. The\r\nresemblance to the New England town is obvious.\r\n\r\n\"Provided alwayes,\" ran the quaint statute, \"and it is the true intent\r\nand meaning of this act that for every five hundred acres of land to be\r\ngranted in pursuance of this act there shall be and shall be continually\r\nkept upon the said land one christian man between sixteen and sixty\r\nyears of age perfect of limb, able and fitt for service who shall alsoe\r\nbe continually provided with a well fixed musquett or fuzee, a good\r\npistoll, sharp simeter, tomahawk and five pounds of good clean pistoll\r\npowder and twenty pounds of sizable leaden bulletts or swan or goose\r\nshott to be kept within the fort directed by this act besides the powder\r\nand shott for his necessary or useful shooting at game. Provided also\r\nthat the said warlike christian man shall have his dwelling and\r\ncontinual abode within the space of two hundred acres of land to be laid\r\nout in a geometricall square or as near that figure as conveniency will\r\nadmit,\" etc. Within two years the society was required to cause a half\r\nacre in the middle of the \"co-habitation\" to be palisaded \"with good\r\nsound pallisadoes at least thirteen foot long and six inches diameter in\r\nthe middle of the length thereof, and set double and at least three foot\r\nwithin the ground.\"\r\n\r\nSuch in 1701 was the idea of the Virginia tidewater assembly of a\r\nfrontiersman, and of the frontier towns by which the Old Dominion should\r\nspread her population into the upland South. But the \"warlike Christian\r\nman\" who actually came to furnish the firing line for Virginia, was\r\ndestined to be the Scotch-Irishman and the German with long rifle in\r\nplace of \"fuzee\" and \"simeter,\" and altogether too restless to have his\r\ncontinual abode within the space of two hundred acres. Nevertheless\r\nthere are points of resemblance between this idea of societies settled\r\nabout a fortified town and the later \"stations\" of Kentucky.[87:1]\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the eighteenth century the engrossing of the lands\r\nof lowland Virginia had progressed so far, the practice of holding large\r\ntracts of wasteland for reserves in the great plantations had become so\r\ncommon, that the authorities of Virginia reported to the home government\r\nthat the best lands were all taken up,[87:2] and settlers were passing\r\ninto North Carolina seeking cheap lands near navigable rivers. Attention\r\nwas directed also to the Piedmont portions of Virginia, for by this time\r\nthe Indians were conquered in this region. It was now possible to\r\nacquire land by purchase[87:3] at five shillings sterling for fifty\r\nacres, as well as by head-rights for importation or settlement, and land\r\nspeculation soon turned to the new area.\r\n\r\nAlready the Piedmont had been somewhat explored.[87:4] Even by the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, fur-traders had followed the trail\r\nsouthwest from the James more than four hundred miles to the Catawbas\r\nand later to the Cherokees. Col. William Byrd had, as we have seen, not\r\nonly been absorbing good lands in the lowlands, and defending his post\r\nat the falls of the James, like a Count of the Border, but he also\r\nengaged in this fur-trade and sent his pack trains along this trail\r\nthrough the Piedmont of the Carolinas,[87:5] and took note of the rich\r\nsavannas of that region. Charleston traders engaged in rivalry for this\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before cattle raisers from the older settlements,\r\nlearning from the traders of the fertile plains and peavine pastures of\r\nthis land, followed the fur-traders and erected scattered \"cow-pens\" or\r\nranches beyond the line of plantations in the Piedmont. Even at the\r\nclose of the seventeenth century, herds of wild horses and cattle ranged\r\nat the outskirts of the Virginia settlements, and were hunted by the\r\nplanters, driven into pens, and branded somewhat after the manner of the\r\nlater ranching on the Great Plains.[88:1] Now the cow-drovers and the\r\ncow-pens[88:2] began to enter the uplands. The Indians had by this time\r\nbeen reduced to submission in most of the Virginia Piedmont--as Governor\r\nSpotswood[88:3] reported in 1712, living \"quietly on our frontiers,\r\ntrafficking with the Inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the Tuscaroras and Yemassees about this time in the\r\nCarolinas, similar opportunities for expansion existed there. The cattle\r\ndrovers sometimes took their herds from range to range; sometimes they\r\nwere gathered permanently near the pens, finding the range sufficient\r\nthroughout the year. They were driven to Charleston, or later sometimes\r\neven to Philadelphia and Baltimore markets. By the middle of the\r\ncentury, disease worked havoc with them in South Carolina[89:1] and\r\ndestroyed seven-eighths of those in North Carolina; Virginia made\r\nregulations governing the driving of cattle through her frontier\r\ncounties to avoid the disease, just as in our own time the northern\r\ncattlemen attempted to protect their herds against the Texas fever.\r\n\r\nThus cattle raisers from the coast followed the fur-traders toward the\r\nuplands, and already pioneer farmers were straggling into the same\r\nregion, soon to be outnumbered by the tide of settlement that flowed\r\ninto the region from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of the uplands by contemporaneous writers are in\r\nglowing terms. Makemie, in his \"Plain and Friendly Persuasion\" (1705),\r\ndeclared \"The best, richest, and most healthy part of your Country is\r\nyet to be inhabited, above the falls of every River, to the Mountains.\"\r\nJones, in his \"Present State of Virginia\" (1724), comments on the\r\nconvenience of tidewater transportation, etc., but declares that section\r\n\"not nearly so healthy as the uplands and Barrens which serve for Ranges\r\nfor Stock,\" although he speaks less enthusiastically of the savannas and\r\nmarshes which lay in the midst of the forest areas. In fact, the\r\nPiedmont was by no means the unbroken forest that might have been\r\nimagined, for in addition to natural meadows, the Indians had burned\r\nover large tracts.[89:2] It was a rare combination of woodland and\r\npasture, with clear running streams and mild climate.[89:3]\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the Virginia Piedmont received a special impetus from\r\nthe interest which Governor Spotswood took in the frontier. In 1710 he\r\nproposed a plan for intercepting the French in their occupation of the\r\ninterior, by inducing Virginia settlement to proceed along one side of\r\nJames River only, until this column of advancing pioneers should strike\r\nthe attenuated line of French posts in the center. In the same year he\r\nsent a body of horsemen to the top of the Blue Ridge, where they could\r\noverlook the Valley of Virginia.[90:1] By 1714 he became active as a\r\ncolonizer himself. Thirty miles above the falls of the Rappahannock, on\r\nthe Rapidan at Germanna,[90:2] he settled a little village of German\r\nredemptioners (who in return for having the passage paid agreed to serve\r\nwithout wages for a term of years), to engage in his iron works, also to\r\nact as rangers on the frontier. From here, in 1716, with two companies\r\nof rangers and four Indians, Governor Spotswood and a band of Virginia\r\ngentlemen made a summer picnic excursion of two weeks across the Blue\r\nRidge into the Shenandoah Valley. _Sic juvat transcendere montes_ was\r\nthe motto of these Knights of the Golden Horse Shoe, as the governor\r\ndubbed them. But they were not the \"warlike christian men\" destined to\r\noccupy the frontier.\r\n\r\nSpotswood's interest in the advance along the Rappahannock, probably\r\naccounts for the fact that in 1720 Spotsylvania and Brunswick were\r\norganized as frontier counties of Virginia.[91:1] Five hundred dollars\r\nwere contributed by the colony to the church, and a thousand dollars for\r\narms and ammunition for the settlers in these counties. The fears of the\r\nFrench and Indians beyond the high mountains, were alleged as reasons\r\nfor this advance. To attract settlers to these new counties, they were\r\n(1723) exempt from purchasing the lands under the system of head rights,\r\nand from payment of quit-rents for seven years after 1721. The free\r\ngrants so obtained were not to exceed a thousand acres. This was soon\r\nextended to six thousand acres, but with provision requiring the\r\nsettlement of a certain number of families upon the grant within a\r\ncertain time. In 1729 Spotswood was ordered by the Council to produce\r\n\"rights\" and pay the quit-rents for the 59,786 acres which he claimed in\r\nthis county.\r\n\r\nOther similar actions by the Council show that large holdings were\r\ndeveloping there, also that the difficulty of establishing a frontier\r\ndemocracy in contact with the area of expanding plantations, was very\r\nreal.[91:2] By the time of the occupation of the Shenandoah Valley,\r\ntherefore, the custom was established in this part of Virginia,[91:3] of\r\nmaking grants of a thousand acres for each family settled. Speculative\r\nplanters, influential with the Governor and Council secured grants of\r\nmany thousand acres, conditioned upon seating a certain number of\r\nfamilies, and satisfying the requirements of planting. Thus what had\r\noriginally been intended as direct grants to the actual settler,\r\nfrequently became grants to great planters like Beverley, who promoted\r\nthe coming of Scotch-Irish and German settlers, or took advantage of\r\nthe natural drift into the Valley, to sell lands in their grants, as a\r\nrule, reserving quit-rents. The liberal grants per family enabled these\r\nspeculative planters, while satisfying the terms of settlement, to hold\r\nlarge portions of the grant for themselves. Under the lax requirements,\r\nand probably still more lax enforcement, of the provisions for actual\r\ncultivation or cattle-raising,[92:1] it was not difficult to hold such\r\nwild land. These conditions rendered possible the extension of a measure\r\nof aristocratic planter life in the course of time to the Piedmont and\r\nValley lands of Virginia. It must be added, however, that some of the\r\nnewcomers, both Germans and Scotch-Irish, like the Van Meters, Stover,\r\nand Lewis, also showed an ability to act as promoters in locating\r\nsettlers and securing grants to themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the Shenandoah Valley, lay part of the estate of\r\nLord Fairfax, some six million acres in extent, which came to the family\r\nby dower from the old Culpeper and Arlington grant of Northern Neck. In\r\n1748, the youthful Washington was surveying this estate along the upper\r\nwaters of the Potomac, finding a bed under the stars and learning the\r\nlife of the frontier.\r\n\r\nLord Fairfax established his own Greenway manor,[92:2] and divided his\r\ndomain into other manors, giving ninety-nine-year leases to settlers\r\nalready on the ground at twenty shillings annually per hundred acres;\r\nwhile of the new-comers he exacted two shillings annual quit-rent for\r\nthis amount of land in fee simple. Litigation kept land titles uncertain\r\nhere, for many years. Similarly, Beverley's manor, about Staunton,\r\nrepresented a grant of 118,000 acres to Beverley and his associates on\r\ncondition of placing the proper number of families on the tract.[93:1]\r\nThus speculative planters on this frontier shared in the movement of\r\noccupation and made an aristocratic element in the up-country; but the\r\nincreasing proportion of Scotch-Irish immigrants, as well as German\r\nsettlers, together with the contrast in natural conditions, made the\r\ninterior a different Virginia from that of the tidewater.\r\n\r\nAs settlement ascended the Rappahannock, and emigrants began to enter\r\nthe Valley from the north, so, contemporaneously, settlement ascended\r\nthe James above the falls, succeeding to the posts of the\r\nfur-traders.[93:2] Goochland County was set off in 1728, and the growth\r\nof population led, as early as 1729, to proposals for establishing a\r\ncity (Richmond) at the falls. Along the upper James, as on the\r\nRappahannock, speculative planters bought headrights and located\r\nsettlers and tenants to hold their grants.[93:3] Into this region came\r\nnatives of Virginia, emigrants from the British isles, and scattered\r\nrepresentatives of other lands, some of them coming up the James, others\r\nup the York, and still others arriving with the southward-moving current\r\nalong both sides of the Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nBefore 1730 few settlers lived above the mouth of the Rivanna. In 1732\r\nPeter Jefferson patented a thousand acres at the eastern opening of its\r\nmountain gap, and here, under frontier conditions, Thomas Jefferson was\r\nborn in 1743 near his later estate of Monticello. About him were pioneer\r\nfarmers, as well as foresighted engrossers of the land. In the main his\r\ncountry was that of a democratic frontier people--Scotch-Irish\r\nPresbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and other sects,[94:1] out of\r\nsympathy with the established church and the landed gentry of the\r\nlowlands. This society in which he was born, was to find in Jefferson a\r\npowerful exponent of its ideals.[94:2] Patrick Henry was born in 1736\r\nabove the falls, not far from Richmond, and he also was a mouthpiece of\r\ninterior Virginia in the Revolutionary era. In short, a society was\r\nalready forming in the Virginia Piedmont which was composed of many\r\nsects, of independent yeomen as well as their great planter leaders--a\r\nsociety naturally expansive, seeing its opportunity to deal in\r\nunoccupied lands along the frontier which continually moved toward the\r\nWest, and in this era of the eighteenth century dominated by the\r\ndemocratic ideals of pioneers rather than by the aristocratic tendencies\r\nof slaveholding planters. As there were two New Englands, so there were\r\nby this time two Virginias, and the uplands belonged with the Old West.\r\n\r\nThe advance across the fall line from the coast was, in North Carolina,\r\nmuch slower than in Virginia. After the Tuscarora War (1712-13) an\r\nextensive region west from Pamlico Sound was opened (1724). The region\r\nto the north, about the Roanoke, had before this begun to receive\r\nfrontier settlers, largely from Virginia. Their traits are interestingly\r\nportrayed in Byrd's \"Dividing Line.\" By 1728 the farthest inhabitants\r\nalong the Virginia boundary were frontiersmen about Great Creek, a\r\nbranch of the Roanoke.[94:3] The North Carolina commissioners desired to\r\nstop running the line after going a hundred and seventy miles, on the\r\nplea that they were already fifty miles beyond the outermost inhabitant,\r\nand there would be no need for an age or two to carry the line farther;\r\nbut the Virginia surveyors pointed out that already speculators were\r\ntaking up the land. A line from Weldon to Fayetteville would roughly\r\nmark the western boundary of North Carolina's sparse population of forty\r\nthousand souls.[95:1]\r\n\r\nThe slower advance is explained, partly because of the later settlement\r\nof the Carolinas, partly because the Indians continued to be troublesome\r\non the flanks of the advancing population, as seen in the Tuscarora and\r\nYemassee wars, and partly because the pine barrens running parallel with\r\nthe fall line made a zone of infertile land not attractive to settlers.\r\nThe North Carolina low country, indeed, had from the end of the\r\nseventeenth century been a kind of southern frontier for overflow from\r\nVirginia; and in many ways was assimilated to the type of the up-country\r\nin its turbulent democracy, its variety of sects and peoples, and its\r\nprimitive conditions. But under the lax management of the public lands,\r\nthe use of \"blank patents\" and other evasions made possible the\r\ndevelopment of large landholding, side by side with headrights to\r\nsettlers. Here, as in Virginia, a great proprietary grant extended\r\nacross the colony--Lord Granville's proprietary was a zone embracing the\r\nnorthern half of North Carolina. Within the area, sales and quit-rents\r\nwere administered by the agents of the owner, with the result that\r\nuncertainty and disorder of an agrarian nature extended down to the\r\nRevolution. There were likewise great speculative holdings, conditioned\r\non seating a certain proportion of settlers, into which the frontiersmen\r\nwere drifting.[95:2] But this system also made it possible for agents of\r\nlater migrating congregations to establish colonies like that of the\r\nMoravians at Wachovia.[95:3] Thus, by the time settlers came into the\r\nuplands from the north, a land system existed similar to that of\r\nVirginia. A common holding was a square mile (640 acres), but in\r\npractice this did not prevent the accumulation of great estates.[96:1]\r\nWhereas Virginia's Piedmont area was to a large extent entered by\r\nextensions from the coast, that of North Carolina remained almost\r\nuntouched by 1730.[96:2]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of South Carolina. By 1730, settlement had progressed\r\nhardly eighty miles from the coast, even in the settled area of the\r\nlowlands. The tendency to engross the lowlands for large plantations was\r\nclear, here as elsewhere.[96:3] The surveyor-general reports in 1732\r\nthat not as many as a thousand acres within a hundred miles of\r\nCharleston, or within twenty miles of a river or navigable creek, were\r\nunpossessed. In 1729 the crown ordered eleven townships of twenty\r\nthousand acres each to be laid out in rectangles, divided into fifty\r\nacres for each actual settler under a quit-rent of four shillings a year\r\nfor every hundred acres, or proportionally, to be paid after the first\r\nten years.[96:4] By 1732 these townships, designed to attract foreign\r\nProtestants, were laid out on the great rivers of the colony. As they\r\nwere located in the middle region, east of the fall line, among pine\r\nbarrens, or in malarial lands in the southern corner of the colony, they\r\nall proved abortive as towns, except Orangeburg[96:5] on the North\r\nEdisto, where German redemptioners made a settlement. The Scotch-Irish\r\nPresbyterians who came to Williamsburg, on Black River, suffered\r\nhardships; as did the Swiss who, under the visionary leadership of\r\nPurry, settled in the deadly climate of Purrysburg, on the lower\r\nSavannah. To Welsh colonists from Pennsylvania there was made a\r\ngrant--known as the \"Welsh tract,\" embracing over 173,000 acres on the\r\nGreat Pedee (Marion County)[97:1] under headrights of fifty acres, also\r\na bounty in provisions, tools, and livestock.\r\n\r\nThese attempts, east of the fall line, are interesting as showing\r\nthe colonial policy of marking out towns (which were to be\r\npolitically-organized parishes, with representation in the legislature),\r\nand attracting foreigners thereto, prior to the coming of settlers from\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Georgia, in 1732, completed the southern line of\r\ncolonization toward the Piedmont. Among the objects of the colony, as\r\nspecified in the charters, were the relief of the poor and the\r\nprotection of the frontiers. To guard against the tendency to engross\r\nthe lands in great estates, already so clearly revealed in the older\r\ncolonies, the Georgia trustees provided that the grants of fifty acres\r\nshould not be alienated or divided, but should pass to the male heirs\r\nand revert to the trustees in case heirs were lacking. No grant greater\r\nthan five hundred acres was permitted, and even this was made\r\nconditionally upon the holder settling ten colonists. However, under\r\nlocal conditions and the competition and example of neighboring\r\ncolonies, this attempt to restrict land tenure in the interest of\r\ndemocracy broke down by 1750, and Georgia's land system became not\r\nunlike that of the other Southern colonies.[97:2]\r\n\r\nIn 1734, Salzburgers had been located above Savannah, and within seven\r\nyears some twelve hundred German Protestants were dwelling on the\r\nGeorgia frontier; while a settlement of Scotch Highlanders at Darien,\r\nnear the mouth of the Altamaha, protected the southern frontier. At\r\nAugusta, an Indian trading fort (1735), whence the dealers in peltry\r\nvisited the Cherokee, completed the familiar picture of frontier\r\nadvance.[98:1]\r\n\r\nWe have now hastily surveyed the movement of the frontier of settlement\r\nwestward from the lowlands, in the later years of the seventeenth and\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century. There is much that is common in\r\nthe whole line of advance. The original settlers engross the desirable\r\nlands of the older area. Indented servants and new-comers pass to the\r\nfrontier seeking a place to locate their headrights, or plant new towns.\r\nAdventurous and speculative wealthy planters acquire large holdings in\r\nthe new areas, and bring over settlers to satisfy the requirements of\r\nseating and cultivating their extensive grants, thus building up a\r\nyeomanry of small landholders side by side with the holders of large\r\nestates. The most far-sighted of the new-comers follow the example of\r\nthe planters, and petition for increasing extensive grants. Meanwhile,\r\npioneers like Abraham Wood, himself once an indented servant, and\r\ngentlemen like Col. William Byrd--prosecuting the Indian trade from\r\ntheir posts at the \"heads\" of the rivers, and combining frontier\r\nprotection, exploring, and surveying--make known the more distant\r\nfertile soils of the Piedmont. Already in the first part of the\r\neighteenth century, the frontier population tended to be a rude\r\ndemocracy, with a large representation of Scotch-Irish, Germans, Welsh,\r\nand Huguenot French settlers, holding religious faiths unlike that of\r\nthe followers of the established church in the lowlands. The movement of\r\nslaves into the region was unimportant, but not unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Valley was practically unsettled in 1730, as was much of\r\nVirginia's Piedmont area and all the Piedmont area of the Carolinas. The\r\nsignificance of the movement of settlers from the North into this vacant\r\nValley and Piedmont, behind the area occupied by expansion from the\r\ncoast is, that it was geographically separated from the westward\r\nmovement from the coast, and that it was sufficient in volume to recruit\r\nthe democratic forces and postpone for a long time the process of social\r\nassimilation to the type of the lowlands.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out, especially in the Carolinas a belt of pine\r\nbarrens, roughly eighty miles in breadth, ran parallel with the fall\r\nline and thus discouraged western advance across this belt, even before\r\nthe head of navigation was reached. In Virginia, the Blue Ridge made an\r\nalmost equally effective barrier, walling off the Shenandoah Valley from\r\nthe westward advance. At the same time this valley was but a\r\ncontinuation of the Great Valley, that ran along the eastern edge of the\r\nAlleghanies in southeastern Pennsylvania, and included in its mountain\r\ntrough the Cumberland and Hagerstown valleys. In short, a broad\r\nlimestone band of fertile soil was stretched within mountain walls,\r\nsoutherly from Pennsylvania to southwestern Virginia; and here the\r\nwatergaps opened the way to descend to the Carolina Piedmont. This whole\r\narea, a kind of peninsula thrust down from Pennsylvania, was rendered\r\ncomparatively inaccessible to the westward movement from the lowlands,\r\nand was equally accessible to the population which was entering\r\nPennsylvania.[99:1]\r\n\r\nThus it happened that from about 1730 to 1760 a generation of settlers\r\npoured along this mountain trough into the southern uplands, or\r\nPiedmont, creating a new continuous social and economic area, which cut\r\nacross the artificial colonial boundary lines, disarranged the regular\r\nextension of local government from the coast westward, and built up a\r\nnew Pennsylvania in contrast with the old Quaker colonies, and a new\r\nSouth in contrast with the tidewater South. This New South composed the\r\nsouthern half of the Old West.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning, Pennsylvania was advertised as a home for dissenting\r\nsects seeking freedom in the wilderness. But it was not until the exodus\r\nof German redemptioners,[100:1] from about 1717, that the Palatinate and\r\nneighboring areas sent the great tide of Germans which by the time of\r\nthe Revolution made them nearly a third of the total population of\r\nPennsylvania. It has been carefully estimated that in 1775 over 200,000\r\nGermans lived in the thirteen colonies, chiefly along the frontier zone\r\nof the Old West. Of these, a hundred thousand had their home in\r\nPennsylvania, mainly in the Great Valley, in the region which is still\r\nso notably the abode of the \"Pennsylvania Dutch.\"[100:2]\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit us to describe this movement of\r\ncolonization.[100:3] The entrance to the fertile limestone soils of the\r\nGreat Valley of Pennsylvania was easy, in view of the low elevation of\r\nthe South Mountain ridge, and the watergaps thereto. The continuation\r\nalong the similar valley to the south, in Maryland and Virginia, was a\r\nnatural one, especially as the increasing tide of emigrants raised the\r\nprice of lands.[100:4] In 1719 the proprietor's price for Pennsylvania\r\nlands was ten pounds per hundred acres, and two shillings quit-rents. In\r\n1732 this became fifteen and one-half pounds, with a quit-rent of a half\r\npenny per acre.[101:1] During the period 1718 to 1732, when the Germans\r\nwere coming in great numbers, the management of the lands fell into\r\nconfusion, and many seated themselves as squatters, without\r\ntitle.[101:2] This was a fortunate possibility for the poor\r\nredemptioners, who had sold their service for a term of years in order\r\nto secure their transportation to America.\r\n\r\nBy 1726 it was estimated that there were 100,000 squatters;[101:3] and\r\nof the 670,000 acres occupied between 1732 and 1740, it is estimated\r\nthat 400,000 acres were settled without grants.[101:4] Nevertheless\r\nthese must ultimately be paid for, with interest, and the concession of\r\nthe right of preëmption to squatters made this easier. But it was not\r\nuntil 1755 that the governor offered land free from purchase, and this\r\nwas to be taken only west of the Alleghanies.[101:5]\r\n\r\nAlthough the credit system relieved the difficulty in Pennsylvania, the\r\nlands of that colony were in competition with the Maryland lands,\r\noffered between 1717 and 1738 at forty shillings sterling per hundred\r\nacres, which in 1738 was raised to five pounds sterling.[101:6] At the\r\nsame time, in the Virginia Valley, as will be recalled, free grants were\r\nbeing made of a thousand acres per family. Although large tracts of the\r\nShenandoah Valley had been granted to speculators like Beverley,\r\nBorden, and the Carters, as well as to Lord Fairfax, the owners sold\r\nsix or seven pounds cheaper per hundred acres than did the Pennsylvania\r\nland office.[102:1] Between 1726 and 1734, therefore, the Germans began\r\nto enter this valley,[102:2] and before long they extended their\r\nsettlements into the Piedmont of the Carolinas,[102:3] being recruited\r\nin South Carolina by emigrants coming by way of Charleston--especially\r\nafter Governor Glenn's purchase from the Cherokee in 1755, of the\r\nextreme western portion of the colony. Between 1750 and the Revolution,\r\nthese settlers in the Carolinas greatly increased in numbers.\r\n\r\nThus a zone of almost continuous German settlements had been\r\nestablished, running from the head of the Mohawk in New York to the\r\nSavannah in Georgia. They had found the best soils, and they knew how to\r\ntill them intensively and thriftily, as attested by their large,\r\nwell-filled barns, good stock, and big canvas-covered Conestoga wagons.\r\nThey preferred to dwell in groups, often of the same religious\r\ndenomination--Lutherans, Reformed, Moravians, Mennonites, and many\r\nlesser sects. The diaries of Moravian missionaries from Pennsylvania,\r\nwho visited them, show how the parent congregations kept in touch with\r\ntheir colonies[102:4] and how intimate, in general, was the bond of\r\nconnection between this whole German frontier zone and that of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this German occupation of Valley and Piedmont, went\r\nthe migration of the Scotch-Irish.[103:1] These lowland Scots had been\r\nplanted in Ulster early in the seventeenth century. Followers of John\r\nKnox, they had the contentious individualism and revolutionary temper\r\nthat seem natural to Scotch Presbyterianism. They were brought up on the\r\nOld Testament, and in the doctrine of government by covenant or compact.\r\nIn Ireland their fighting qualities had been revealed in the siege of\r\nLondonderry, where their stubborn resistance balked the hopes of James\r\nII. However, religious and political disabilities were imposed upon\r\nthese Ulstermen, which made them discontented, and hard times\r\ncontributed to detach them from their homes. Their movement to America\r\nwas contemporaneous with the heavy German migration. By the Revolution,\r\nit is believed that a third of the population of Pennsylvania was\r\nScotch-Irish; and it has been estimated, probably too liberally, that a\r\nhalf million came to the United States between 1730 and 1770.[103:2]\r\nEspecially after the Rebellion of 1745, large numbers of Highlanders\r\ncame to increase the Scotch blood in the nation.[103:3] Some of the\r\nScotch-Irish went to New England.[103:4] Given the cold shoulder by\r\ncongregational Puritans, they passed to unsettled lands about Worcester,\r\nto the frontier in the Berkshires, and in southern New Hampshire at\r\nLondonderry--whence came John Stark, a frontier leader in the French\r\nand Indian War, and the hero of Bennington in the Revolution, as well as\r\nthe ancestors of Horace Greeley and S. P. Chase. In New York, a\r\nScotch-Irish settlement was planted on the frontier at Cherry\r\nValley.[104:1] Scotch Highlanders came to the Mohawk,[104:2] where they\r\nfollowed Sir William Johnson and became Tory raiders in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut it was in Pennsylvania that the center of Scotch-Irish power lay.\r\n\"These bold and indigent strangers, saying as their excuse when\r\nchallenged for titles that we had solicited for colonists and they had\r\ncome accordingly,\"[104:3] and asserting that \"it was against the laws of\r\nGod and nature that so much land should be idle while so many christians\r\nwanted it to work on and to raise their bread,\" squatted on the vacant\r\nlands, especially in the region disputed between Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland, and remained in spite of efforts to drive them off. Finding\r\nthe Great Valley in the hands of the Germans, they planted their own\r\noutposts along the line of the Indian trading path from Lancaster to\r\nBedford; they occupied Cumberland Valley, and before 1760 pressed up the\r\nJuniata somewhat beyond the narrows, spreading out along its\r\ntributaries, and by 1768 had to be warned off from the Redstone country\r\nto avoid Indian trouble. By the time of the Revolution, their\r\nsettlements made Pittsburgh a center from which was to come a new era in\r\nPennsylvania history. It was the Scotch-Irish and German\r\nfur-traders[104:4] whose pack trains pioneered into the Ohio Valley in\r\nthe days before the French and Indian wars. The messengers between\r\ncivilization and savagery were such men,[105:1] as the Irish Croghan,\r\nand the Germans Conrad Weiser and Christian Post.\r\n\r\nLike the Germans, the Scotch-Irish passed into the Shenandoah\r\nValley,[105:2] and on to the uplands of the South. In 1738 a delegation\r\nof the Philadelphia Presbyterian synod was sent to the Virginia governor\r\nand received assurances of security of religious freedom; the same\r\npolicy was followed by the Carolinas. By 1760 a zone of Scotch-Irish\r\nPresbyterian churches extended from the frontiers of New England to the\r\nfrontiers of South Carolina. This zone combined in part with the German\r\nzone, but in general Scotch-Irishmen tended to follow the valleys\r\nfarther toward the mountains, to be the outer edge of this frontier.\r\nAlong with this combined frontier stream were English, Welsh and Irish\r\nQuakers, and French Huguenots.[105:3]\r\n\r\nAmong this moving mass, as it passed along the Valley into the Piedmont,\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century, were Daniel Boone, John Sevier,\r\nJames Robertson, and the ancestors of John C. Calhoun, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nJefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, James K. Polk, Sam Houston, and Davy\r\nCrockett, while the father of Andrew Jackson came to the Carolina\r\nPiedmont at the same time from the coast. Recalling that Thomas\r\nJefferson's home was on the frontier, at the edge of the Blue Ridge, we\r\nperceive that these names represent the militant expansive movement in\r\nAmerican life. They foretell the settlement across the Alleghanies in\r\nKentucky and Tennessee; the Louisiana Purchase, and Lewis and Clark's\r\ntranscontinental exploration; the conquest of the Gulf Plains in the\r\nWar of 1812-15; the annexation of Texas; the acquisition of California\r\nand the Spanish Southwest. They represent, too, frontier democracy in\r\nits two aspects personified in Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. It\r\nwas a democracy responsive to leadership, susceptible to waves of\r\nemotion, of a \"high religeous voltage\"--quick and direct in action.\r\n\r\nThe volume of this Northern movement into the Southern uplands is\r\nillustrated by the statement of Governor Tryon, of North Carolina, that\r\nin the summer and winter of 1765 more than a thousand immigrant wagons\r\npassed through Salisbury, in that colony.[106:1] Coming by families, or\r\ngroups of families or congregations, they often drove their herds with\r\nthem. Whereas in 1746 scarce a hundred fighting men were found in Orange\r\nand the western counties of North Carolina, there were in 1753 fully\r\nthree thousand, in addition to over a thousand Scotch in the Cumberland;\r\nand they covered the province more or less thickly, from Hillsboro and\r\nFayetteville to the mountains.[106:2] Bassett remarks that the\r\nPresbyterians received their first ministers from the synod of New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, and later on sent their ministerial students to\r\nPrinceton College. \"Indeed it is likely that the inhabitants of this\r\nregion knew more about Philadelphia at that time than about Newbern or\r\nEdenton.\"[106:3]\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to note briefly, in conclusion, some of the\r\nresults of the occupation of this new frontier during the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century--some of the consequences of this formation of\r\nthe Old West.\r\n\r\nI. A fighting frontier had been created all along the line from New\r\nEngland to Georgia, which bore the brunt of French and Indian attacks\r\nand gave indispensable service during the Revolution. The significance\r\nof this fact could only be developed by an extended survey of the\r\nscattered border warfare of this era. We should have to see Rogers\r\nleading his New England Rangers, and Washington defending interior\r\nVirginia with his frontiersmen in their hunting shirts, in the French\r\nand Indian War. When all of the campaigns about the region of Canada,\r\nLake Champlain, and the Hudson, central New York (Oriskany, Cherry\r\nValley, Sullivan's expedition against the Iroquois), Wyoming Valley,\r\nwestern Pennsylvania, the Virginia Valley, and the back country of the\r\nSouth are considered as a whole from this point of view, the meaning of\r\nthe Old West will become more apparent.\r\n\r\nII. A new society had been established, differing in essentials from the\r\ncolonial society of the coast. It was a democratic self-sufficing,\r\nprimitive agricultural society, in which individualism was more\r\npronounced than the community life of the lowlands. The indented servant\r\nand the slave were not a normal part of its labor system. It was engaged\r\nin grain and cattle raising, not in producing staples, and it found a\r\npartial means of supplying its scarcity of specie by the peltries which\r\nit shipped to the coast. But the hunter folk were already pushing\r\nfarther on; the cow-pens and the range were giving place to the small\r\nfarm, as in our own day they have done in the cattle country. It was a\r\nregion of hard work and poverty, not of wealth and leisure. Schools and\r\nchurches were secured under serious difficulty,[107:1] if at all; but in\r\nspite of the natural tendencies of a frontier life, a large portion of\r\nthe interior showed a distinctly religious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIII. The Old West began the movement of internal trade which developed\r\nhome markets and diminished that colonial dependence on Europe in\r\nindustrial matters shown by the maritime and staple-raising sections.\r\nNot only did Boston and other New England towns increase as trading\r\ncenters when the back country settled up, but an even more significant\r\ninterchange occurred along the Valley and Piedmont. The German farmers\r\nof the Great Valley brought their woven linen, knitted stockings,\r\nfirkins of butter, dried apples, grain, etc., to Philadelphia and\r\nespecially to Baltimore, which was laid out in 1730. To this city also\r\ncame trade from the Shenandoah Valley, and even from the Piedmont came\r\npeltry trains and droves of cattle and hogs to the same market.[108:1]\r\nThe increase of settlement on the upper James resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the city of Richmond at the falls of the river in 1737.\r\nAlready the tobacco-planting aristocracy of the lowlands were finding\r\nrivals in the grain-raising area of interior Virginia and Maryland.\r\nCharleston prospered as the up-country of the Carolinas grew. Writing in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, Governor Glenn, of South Carolina,\r\nexplained the apparent diminution of the colony's shipping thus:[108:2]\r\n\r\n     Our trade with New York and Philadelphia was of this sort,\r\n     draining us of all the little money and bills that we could\r\n     gather from other places, for their bread, flour, beer, hams,\r\n     bacon, and other things of their produce, all which, except\r\n     beer, our new townships begin to supply us with which are\r\n     settled with very industrious and consequently thriving\r\n     Germans.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before this interior trade produced those rivalries for\r\ncommercial ascendancy, between the coastwise cities, which still\r\ncontinue. The problem of internal improvements became a pressing one,\r\nand the statutes show increasing provision for roads, ferries, bridges,\r\nriver improvements, etc.[109:1] The basis was being laid for a national\r\neconomy, and at the same time a new source for foreign export was\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIV. The Old West raised the issues of nativism and a lower standard of\r\ncomfort. In New England, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians had been frowned\r\nupon and pushed away by the Puritan townsmen.[109:2] In Pennsylvania,\r\nthe coming of the Germans and the Scotch-Irish in such numbers caused\r\ngrave anxiety. Indeed, a bill was passed to limit the importation of the\r\nPalatines, but it was vetoed.[109:3] Such astute observers as Franklin\r\nfeared in 1753 that Pennsylvania would be unable to preserve its\r\nlanguage and that even its government would become precarious.[109:4] \"I\r\nremember,\" he declares, \"when they modestly declined intermeddling in\r\nour elections, but now they come in droves and carry all before them,\r\nexcept in one or two counties;\" and he lamented that the English could\r\nnot remove their prejudices by addressing them in German.[109:5] Dr.\r\nDouglas[109:6] apprehended that Pennsylvania would \"degenerate into a\r\nforeign colony\" and endanger the quiet of the adjacent provinces. Edmund\r\nBurke, regretting that the Germans adhered to their own schools,\r\nliterature, and language, and that they possessed great tracts without\r\nadmixture of English, feared that they would not blend and become one\r\npeople with the British colonists, and that the colony was threatened\r\nwith the danger of being wholly foreign. He also noted that \"these\r\nforeigners by their industry, frugality, and a hard way of living, in\r\nwhich they greatly exceed our people, have in a manner thrust them out\r\nin several places.\"[110:1] This is a phenomenon with which a succession\r\nof later frontiers has familiarized us. In point of fact the\r\n\"Pennsylvania Dutch\" remained through our history a very stubborn area\r\nto assimilate, with corresponding effect upon Pennsylvania politics.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted also that this coming of non-English stock to the\r\nfrontier raised in all the colonies affected, questions of\r\nnaturalization and land tenure by aliens.[110:2]\r\n\r\nV. The creation of this frontier society--of which so large a portion\r\ndiffered from that of the coast in language and religion as well as in\r\neconomic life, social structure, and ideals--produced an antagonism\r\nbetween interior and coast, which worked itself out in interesting\r\nfashion. In general this took these forms: contests between the\r\nproperty-holding class of the coast and the debtor class of the\r\ninterior, where specie was lacking, and where paper money and a\r\nreadjustment of the basis of taxation were demanded; contests over\r\ndefective or unjust local government in the administration of taxes,\r\nfees, lands, and the courts; contests over apportionment in the\r\nlegislature, whereby the coast was able to dominate, even when its white\r\npopulation was in the minority; contests to secure the complete\r\nseparation of church and state; and, later, contests over slavery,\r\ninternal improvements, and party politics in general. These contests are\r\nalso intimately connected with the political philosophy of the\r\nRevolution and with the development of American democracy. In nearly\r\nevery colony prior to the Revolution, struggles had been in progress\r\nbetween the party of privilege, chiefly the Eastern men of property\r\nallied with the English authorities, and the democratic classes,\r\nstrongest in the West and the cities.\r\n\r\nThis theme deserves more space than can here be allotted to it; but a\r\nrapid survey of conditions in this respect, along the whole frontier,\r\nwill at least serve to bring out the point.\r\n\r\nIn New England as a whole, the contest is less in evidence. That part of\r\nthe friction elsewhere seen as the result of defective local government\r\nin the back country, was met by the efficiency of the town system; but\r\nbetween the interior and the coast there were struggles over\r\napportionment and religious freedom. The former is illustrated by the\r\nconvention that met in Dracut, Massachusetts, in 1776, to petition the\r\nStates of Massachusetts and New Hampshire to relieve the financial\r\ndistress and unfair legislative representation. Sixteen of the border\r\ntowns of New Hampshire sent delegates to this convention. Two years\r\nlater, these New Hampshire towns attempted to join Vermont.[111:1] As a\r\nRevolutionary State, Vermont itself was an illustration of the same\r\ntendency of the interior to break away from the coast. Massachusetts in\r\nthis period witnessed a campaign between the paper money party which was\r\nentrenched in the more recently and thinly-settled areas of the interior\r\nand west, and the property-holding classes of the coast.[111:2] The\r\nopposition to the constitutions of 1778 and 1780 is tinctured with the\r\nsame antagonism between the ideas of the newer part of the interior and\r\nof the coast.[112:1] Shays' Rebellion and the anti-federal opposition of\r\n1787-88 found its stronghold in the same interior areas.[112:2]\r\n\r\nThe religious struggles continued until the democratic interior, where\r\ndissenting sects were strong, and where there was antagonism to the\r\nprivileges of the congregational church, finally secured complete\r\ndisestablishment in New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. But\r\nthis belongs to a later period.[112:3]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania affords a clear illustration of these sectional\r\nantagonisms. The memorial of the frontier \"Paxton Boys,\" in 1764,\r\ndemanded a right to share in political privileges with the older part of\r\nthe colony, and protested against the apportionment by which the\r\ncounties of Chester, Bucks, and Philadelphia, together with the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, elected twenty-six delegates, while the five frontier\r\ncounties had but ten.[112:4] The frontier complained against the failure\r\nof the dominant Quaker party of the coast to protect the interior\r\nagainst the Indians.[112:5] The three old wealthy counties under Quaker\r\nrule feared the growth of the West, therefore made few new counties, and\r\ncarefully restricted the representation in each to preserve the majority\r\nin the old section. At the same time, by a property qualification they\r\nmet the danger of the democratic city population. Among the points of\r\ngrievance in this colony, in addition to apportionment and\r\nrepresentation, was the difficulty of access to the county seat, owing\r\nto the size of the back counties. Dr. Lincoln has well set forth the\r\nstruggle of the back country, culminating in its triumph in the\r\nconstitutional convention of 1776, which was chiefly the work of the\r\nPresbyterian counties.[113:1] Indeed, there were two revolutions in\r\nPennsylvania, which went on side by side: one a revolt against the\r\ncoastal property-holding classes, the old dominant Quaker party, and the\r\nother a revolt against Great Britain, which was in this colony made\r\npossible only by the triumph of the interior.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, as early as 1710, Governor Spotswood had complained that\r\nthe old counties remained small while the new ones were sometimes ninety\r\nmiles long, the inhabitants being obliged to travel thirty or forty\r\nmiles to their own court-house. Some of the counties had 1,700\r\ntithables, while others only a dozen miles square had 500. Justices of\r\nthe peace disliked to ride forty or fifty miles to their monthly courts.\r\nLikewise there was disparity in the size of parishes--for example, that\r\nof Varina, on the upper James, had nine hundred tithables, many of whom\r\nlived fifty miles from their church. But the vestry refused to allow the\r\nremote parishioners to separate, because it would increase the parish\r\nlevy of those that remained. He feared lest this would afford\r\n\"opportunity to Sectarys to establish their opinions among 'em, and\r\nthereby shake that happy establishment of the Church of England which\r\nthis colony enjoys with less mixture of Dissenters than any other of her\r\nMaj'tie's plantations, and when once Schism has crept into the Church,\r\nit will soon create faction in the Civil Government.\"\r\n\r\nThat Spotswood's fears were well founded, we have already seen. As the\r\nsectaries of the back country increased, dissatisfaction with the\r\nestablished church grew. After the Revolution came, Jefferson, with the\r\nback country behind him, was able finally to destroy the establishment,\r\nand to break down the system of entails and primogeniture behind which\r\nthe tobacco-planting aristocracy of the coast was entrenched. The desire\r\nof Jefferson to see slavery gradually abolished and popular education\r\nprovided, is a further illustration of the attitude of the interior. In\r\nshort, Jeffersonian democracy, with its idea of separation of church and\r\nstate, its wish to popularize education, and its dislike for special\r\nprivilege, was deeply affected by the Western society of the Old\r\nDominion.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian reform movement, however, was unable to redress the\r\ngrievance of unequal apportionment. In 1780 Jefferson pointed out that\r\nthe practice of allowing each county an equal representation in the\r\nlegislature gave control to the numerous small counties of the\r\ntidewater, while the large populous counties of the up-country suffered.\r\n\"Thus,\" he wrote, \"the 19,000 men below the falls give law to more than\r\n30,000 living in other parts of the state, and appoint all their chief\r\nofficers, executive and judiciary.\"[114:1] This led to a long struggle\r\nbetween coast and interior, terminated only when the slave population\r\npassed across the fall line, and more nearly assimilated coast and\r\nup-country. In the mountain areas which did not undergo this change, the\r\nindependent state of West Virginia remains as a monument of the contest.\r\nIn the convention of 1829-30, the whole philosophy of representation was\r\ndiscussed, and the coast defended its control as necessary to protect\r\nproperty from the assaults of a numerical majority. They feared that\r\nthe interior would tax their slaves in order to secure funds for\r\ninternal improvements.\r\n\r\nAs Doddridge put the case:[115:1]\r\n\r\n     The principle is that the owners of slave property must be\r\n     possessed of all the powers of government, however small their\r\n     own numbers may be, to secure that property from the rapacity\r\n     of an overgrown majority of white men. This principle admits\r\n     of no relaxation, because the weaker the minority becomes, the\r\n     greater will their need for power be according to their own\r\n     doctrines.\r\n\r\nLeigh of Chesterfield county declared:[115:2]\r\n\r\n     It is remarkable--I mention it for the curiosity of the\r\n     fact--that if any evil, physical or moral, arise in any of the\r\n     states south of us, it never takes a northerly direction, or\r\n     taints the Southern breeze; whereas, if any plague originate\r\n     in the North, it is sure to spread to the South and to invade\r\n     us sooner or later; the influenza--the smallpox--the\r\n     varioloid--the Hessian fly--the Circuit Court\r\n     system--Universal Suffrage--all come from the North, _and they\r\n     always cross above the falls of the great rivers_; below, it\r\n     seems, the broad expanse of waters interposing, effectually\r\n     arrests their progress.\r\n\r\nNothing could more clearly bring out the sense of contrast between\r\nupland and lowland Virginia, and the continued intimacy of the bond of\r\nconnection between the North and its Valley and Piedmont colonies, than\r\nthis unconscious testimony.\r\n\r\nIn North and South Carolina the upland South, beyond the pine barrens\r\nand the fall line, had similar grievances against the coast; but as the\r\nzone of separation was more strongly marked, the grievances were more\r\nacute. The tide of backwoods settlement flowing down the Piedmont from\r\nthe north, had cut across the lines of local government and disarranged\r\nthe regular course of development of the colonies from the\r\nseacoast.[116:1] Under the common practice, large counties in North\r\nCarolina and parishes in South Carolina had been projected into the\r\nunoccupied interior from the older settlements along their eastern edge.\r\n\r\nBut the Piedmont settlers brought their own social order, and could not\r\nbe well governed by the older planters living far away toward the\r\nseaboard. This may be illustrated by conditions in South Carolina. The\r\ngeneral court in Charleston had absorbed county and precinct courts,\r\nexcept the minor jurisdiction of justices of the peace. This was well\r\nenough for the great planters who made their regular residence there for\r\na part of each year; but it was a source of oppression to the up-country\r\nsettlers, remote from the court. The difficulty of bringing witnesses,\r\nthe delay of the law, and the costs all resulted in the escape of\r\ncriminals as well as in the immunity of reckless debtors. The extortions\r\nof officials, and their occasional collusion with horse and cattle\r\nthieves, and the lack of regular administration of the law, led the\r\nSouth Carolina up-country men to take affairs in their own hands, and in\r\n1764 to establish associations to administer lynch law under the name of\r\n\"Regulators.\" The \"Scovillites,\" or government party, and the\r\nRegulators met in arms on the Saluda in 1769, but hostilities were\r\naverted and remedial measures passed, which alleviated the difficulty\r\nuntil the Revolution.[117:1] There still remained, however, the\r\ngrievance of unjust legislative representation.[117:2] Calhoun stated\r\nthe condition in these words:\r\n\r\n     The upper country had no representation in the government and\r\n     no political existence as a constituent portion of the state\r\n     until a period near the commencement of the revolution.\r\n     Indeed, during the revolution, and until the formation of the\r\n     present constitution, in 1790, its political weight was\r\n     scarcely felt in the government. Even then although it had\r\n     become the most populous section, power was so distributed\r\n     under the constitution as to leave it in a minority in every\r\n     department of government.\r\n\r\nEven in 1794 it was claimed by the up-country leaders that four-fifths\r\nof the people were governed by one-fifth. Nor was the difficulty met\r\nuntil the constitutional amendment of 1808, the effect of which was to\r\ngive the control of the senate to the lower section and of the house of\r\nrepresentatives to the upper section, thus providing a mutual\r\nveto.[117:3] This South Carolina experience furnished the historical\r\nbasis for Calhoun's argument for nullification, and for the political\r\nphilosophy underlying his theory of the \"concurrent majority.\"[118:1]\r\nThis adjustment was effected, however, only after the advance of the\r\nblack belt toward the interior had assimilated portions of the Piedmont\r\nto lowland ideals.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to North Carolina's upper country we find the familiar\r\nstory, but with a more tragic ending. The local officials owed their\r\nselection to the governor and the council whom he appointed. Thus power\r\nwas all concentrated in the official \"ring\" of the lowland area. The men\r\nof the interior resented the extortionate fees and the poll tax, which\r\nbore with unequal weight upon the poor settlers of the back country.\r\nThis tax had been continued after sufficient funds had been collected to\r\nextinguish the debt for which it was originally levied, but venal\r\nsheriffs had failed to pay it into the treasury. A report of 1770 showed\r\nat least one defaulting sheriff in every county of the province.[118:2]\r\nThis tax, which was almost the sole tax of the colony, was to be\r\ncollected in specie, for the warehouse system, by which staples might be\r\naccepted, while familiar on the coast, did not apply to the interior.\r\nThe specie was exceedingly difficult to obtain; in lack of it, the\r\nfarmer saw the sheriff, who owed his appointment to the dominant lowland\r\nplanters, sell the lands of the delinquent to his speculative friends.\r\nLawyers and court fees followed.\r\n\r\nIn short, the interior felt that it was being exploited,[118:3] and it\r\nhad no redress, for the legislature was so apportioned that all power\r\nrested in the old lowland region. Efforts to secure paper money failed\r\nby reason of the governor's opposition under instructions from the\r\ncrown, and the currency was contracting at the very time when population\r\nwas rapidly increasing in the interior.[119:1] As in New England, in the\r\ndays of Shays' Rebellion, violent prejudice existed against the\r\njudiciary and the lawyers, and it must, of course, be understood that\r\nthe movement was not free from frontier dislike of taxation and the\r\nrestraints of law and order in general. In 1766 and 1768, meetings were\r\nheld in the upper counties to organize the opposition, and an\r\n\"association\"[119:2] was formed, the members of which pledged themselves\r\nto pay no more taxes or fees until they satisfied themselves that these\r\nwere agreeable to law.\r\n\r\nThe Regulators, as they called themselves, assembled in the autumn of\r\n1768 to the number of nearly four thousand, and tried to secure terms of\r\nadjustment. In 1770 the court-house at Hillsboro was broken into by a\r\nmob. The assembly passed some measures designed to conciliate the back\r\ncountry; but before they became operative, Governor Tryon's militia,\r\nabout twelve hundred men, largely from the lowlands, and led by the\r\ngentry whose privileges were involved, met the motley army of the\r\nRegulators, who numbered about two thousand, in the battle of the\r\nAlamance (May, 1771). Many were killed and wounded, the Regulators\r\ndispersed, and over six thousand men came into camp and took the oath of\r\nsubmission to the colonial authorities. The battle was not the first\r\nbattle of the Revolution, as it has been sometimes called, for it had\r\nlittle or no relation to the stamp act; and many of the frontiersmen\r\ninvolved, later refused to fight against England because of the very\r\nhatred which had been inspired for the lowland Revolutionary leaders in\r\nthis battle of the Alamance. The interior of the Carolinas was a region\r\nwhere neighbors, during the Revolution, engaged in internecine conflicts\r\nof Tories against Whigs.\r\n\r\nBut in the sense that the battle of Alamance was a conflict against\r\nprivilege, and for equality of political rights and power, it was indeed\r\na preliminary battle of the Revolution, although fought against many of\r\nthe very men who later professed Revolutionary doctrines in North\r\nCarolina. The need of recognizing the importance of the interior led to\r\nconcessions in the convention of 1776 in that state. \"Of the forty-four\r\nsections of the constitution, thirteen are embodiments of reforms sought\r\nby the Regulators.\"[120:1] But it was in this period that hundreds of\r\nNorth Carolina backwoodsmen crossed the mountains to Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, many of them coming from the heart of the Regulator region.\r\nThey used the device of \"associations\" to provide for government in\r\ntheir communities.[120:2]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of apportionment, North Carolina showed the same lodgment\r\nof power in the hands of the coast, even after population preponderated\r\nin the Piedmont.[120:3]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to comment on the uniformity of the evidence which has\r\nbeen adduced, to show that the Old West, the interior region from New\r\nEngland to Georgia, had a common grievance against the coast; that it\r\nwas deprived throughout most of the region of its due share of\r\nrepresentation, and neglected and oppressed in local government in large\r\nportions of the section. The familiar struggle of West against East, of\r\ndemocracy against privileged classes, was exhibited along the entire\r\nline. The phenomenon must be considered as a unit, not in the fragments\r\nof state histories. It was a struggle of interior against coast.\r\n\r\nVI. Perhaps the most noteworthy Western activity in the Revolutionary\r\nera, aside from the aspects already mentioned, was in the part which the\r\nmultitude of sects in the Old West played in securing the great\r\ncontribution which the United States made to civilization by providing\r\nfor complete religious liberty, a secular state with free churches.\r\nParticularly the Revolutionary constitutions of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia, under the influence of the back country, insured religious\r\nfreedom. The effects of the North Carolina upland area to secure a\r\nsimilar result were noteworthy, though for the time ineffective.[121:1]\r\n\r\nVII. As population increased in these years, the coast gradually yielded\r\nto the up-country's demands. This may be illustrated by the transfer of\r\nthe capitals from the lowlands to the fall line and Valley. In 1779,\r\nVirginia changed her seat of government from Williamsburg to Richmond;\r\nin 1790, South Carolina, from Charleston to Columbia; in 1791, North\r\nCarolina, from Edenton to Raleigh; in 1797, New York, from New York City\r\nto Albany; in 1799, Pennsylvania, from Philadelphia to Lancaster.\r\n\r\nVIII. The democratic aspect of the new constitutions was also influenced\r\nby the frontier as well as by the prevalent Revolutionary philosophy;\r\nand the demands for paper money, stay and tender laws, etc., of this\r\nperiod were strongest in the interior. It was this region that supported\r\nShays' Rebellion; it was (with some important exceptions) the same area\r\nthat resisted the ratification of the federal constitution, fearful of a\r\nstronger government and of the loss of paper money.\r\n\r\nIX. The interior later showed its opposition to the coast by the\r\npersistent contest against slavery, carried on in the up-country of\r\nVirginia, and North and South Carolina. Until the decade 1830-40, it was\r\nnot certain that both Virginia and North Carolina would not find some\r\nmeans of gradual abolition. The same influence accounts for much of the\r\nexodus of the Piedmont pioneers into Indiana and Illinois, in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century.[122:1]\r\n\r\nX. These were the regions, also, in which were developed the desire of\r\nthe pioneers who crossed the mountains, and settled on the \"Western\r\nwaters,\" to establish new States free from control by the lowlands,\r\nowning their own lands, able to determine their own currency, and in\r\ngeneral to govern themselves in accordance with the ideals of the Old\r\nWest. They were ready also, if need be, to become independent of the Old\r\nThirteen. Vermont must be considered in this aspect, as well as Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee.[122:2]\r\n\r\nXI. The land system of the Old West furnished precedents which developed\r\ninto the land system of the trans-Alleghany West.[122:3] The squatters\r\nof Pennsylvania and the Carolinas found it easy to repeat the operation\r\non another frontier. Preëmption laws became established features. The\r\nRevolution gave opportunity to confiscate the claims of Lord Fairfax,\r\nLord Granville, and McCulloh to their vast estates, as well as the\r\nremaining lands of the Pennsylvania proprietors. The 640 acre (or one\r\nsquare mile) unit of North Carolina for preëmptions, and frontier land\r\nbounties, became the area awarded to frontier stations by Virginia in\r\n1779, and the \"section\" of the later federal land system. The Virginia\r\npreëmption right of four hundred acres on the Western waters, or a\r\nthousand for those who came prior to 1778, was, in substance, the\r\ncontinuation of a system familiar in the Old West.\r\n\r\nThe grants to Beverley, of over a hundred thousand acres in the Valley,\r\nconditioned on seating a family for every thousand acres, and the\r\nsimilar grants to Borden, Carter, and Lewis, were followed by the great\r\ngrant to the Ohio Company. This company, including leading Virginia\r\nplanters and some frontiersmen, asked in 1749 for two hundred thousand\r\nacres on the upper Ohio, conditioned on seating a hundred families in\r\nseven years, and for an additional grant of three hundred thousand acres\r\nafter this should be accomplished. It was proposed to settle Germans on\r\nthese lands.\r\n\r\nThe Loyal Land Company, by order of the Virginia council (1749), was\r\nauthorized to take up eight hundred thousand acres west and north of the\r\nsouthern boundary of Virginia, on condition of purchasing \"rights\" for\r\nthe amount within four years. The company sold many tracts for £3 per\r\nhundred acres to settlers, but finally lost its claim. The Mississippi\r\nCompany, including in its membership the Lees, Washingtons, and other\r\ngreat Virginia planters, applied for two and one-half million acres in\r\nthe West in 1769. Similar land companies of New England origin, like\r\nthe Susquehanna Company and Lyman's Mississippi Company, exhibit the\r\nsame tendency of the Old West on the northern side. New England's Ohio\r\nCompany of Associates, which settled Marietta, had striking resemblances\r\nto town proprietors.\r\n\r\nThese were only the most noteworthy of many companies of this period,\r\nand it is evident that they were a natural outgrowth of speculations in\r\nthe Old West. Washington, securing military bounty land claims of\r\nsoldiers of the French and Indian War, and selecting lands in West\r\nVirginia until he controlled over seventy thousand acres for\r\nspeculation, is an excellent illustration of the tendency. He also\r\nthought of colonizing German Palatines upon his lands. The formation of\r\nthe Transylvania and Vandalia companies were natural developments on a\r\nstill vaster scale.[124:1]\r\n\r\nXII. The final phase of the Old West, which I wish merely to mention, in\r\nconclusion, is its colonization of areas beyond the mountains. The\r\nessential unity of the movement is brought out by a study of how New\r\nEngland's Old West settled northern Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont,\r\nthe Adirondacks, central and Western New York, the Wyoming Valley (once\r\norganized as a part of Litchfield, Connecticut), the Ohio Company's\r\nregion about Marietta, and Connecticut's Western Reserve on the shores\r\nof Lake Erie; and how the pioneers of the Great Valley and the Piedmont\r\nregion of the South crossed the Alleghanies and settled on the Western\r\nWaters. Daniel Boone, going from his Pennsylvania home to the Yadkin,\r\nand from the Yadkin to Tennessee and Kentucky, took part in the whole\r\nprocess, and later in its continuation into Missouri.[124:2] The social\r\nconditions and ideals of the Old West powerfully shaped those of the\r\ntrans-Alleghany West.\r\n\r\nThe important contrast between the spirit of individual colonization,\r\nresentful of control, which the Southern frontiersmen showed, and the\r\nspirit of community colonization and control to which the New England\r\npioneers inclined, left deep traces on the later history of the\r\nWest.[125:1] The Old West diminished the importance of the town as a\r\ncolonizing unit, even in New England. In the Southern area, efforts to\r\nlegislate towns into existence, as in Virginia, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, failed. They faded away before wilderness conditions. But in\r\ngeneral, the Northern stream of migration was communal, and the Southern\r\nindividual. The difference which existed between that portion of the Old\r\nWest which was formed by the northward colonization, chiefly of the New\r\nEngland Plateau (including New York), and that portion formed by the\r\nsouthward colonization of the Virginia Valley and the Southern Piedmont\r\nwas reflected in the history of the Middle West and the Mississippi\r\nValley.[125:2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67:1] _Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin for\r\n1908._ Reprinted with the permission of the Society.\r\n\r\n[68:1] For the settled area in 1660, see the map by Lois Mathews in\r\nChanning, \"United Stales\" (N.

E.\r\nBolton, I. J. Cox, Chapman, Father Engelhart, and other California and\r\nTexas investigators, although the works of Hubert Howe Bancroft remain a\r\nuseful mine of material. There was, of course, a contemporaneous Old\r\nWest on both the French and the Spanish frontiers. The formation,\r\napproach and ultimate collision and intermingling of these contrasting\r\ntypes of frontiers are worthy of a special study.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE WEST[126:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican sectional nomenclature is still confused. Once \"the West\"\r\ndescribed the whole region beyond the Alleghanies; but the term has\r\nhopelessly lost its definiteness. The rapidity of the spread of\r\nsettlement has broken down old usage, and as yet no substitute has been\r\ngenerally accepted. The \"Middle West\" is a term variously used by the\r\npublic, but for the purpose of the present paper, it will be applied to\r\nthat region of the United States included in the census reports under\r\nthe name of the North Central division, comprising the States of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin (the old \"Territory Northwest\r\nof the River Ohio\"), and their trans-Mississippi sisters of the\r\nLouisiana Purchase,--Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, North\r\nDakota, and South Dakota. It is an imperial domain. If the greater\r\ncountries of Central Europe,--France, Germany, Italy, and\r\nAustro-Hungary,--were laid down upon this area, the Middle West would\r\nstill show a margin of spare territory. Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and\r\nBuffalo constitute its gateways to the Eastern States; Kansas City,\r\nOmaha, St. Paul-Minneapolis, and Duluth-Superior dominate its western\r\nareas; Cincinnati and St. Louis stand on its southern borders; and\r\nChicago reigns at the center. What Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and\r\nBaltimore are to the Atlantic seaboard these cities are to the Middle\r\nWest. The Great Lakes and the Mississippi, with the Ohio and the\r\nMissouri as laterals, constitute the vast water system that binds the\r\nMiddle West together. It is the economic and political center of the\r\nRepublic. At one edge is the Populism of the prairies; at the other, the\r\ncapitalism that is typified in Pittsburgh. Great as are the local\r\ndifferences within the Middle West, it possesses, in its physiography,\r\nin the history of its settlement, and in its economic and social life, a\r\nunity and interdependence which warrant a study of the area as an\r\nentity. Within the limits of this article, treatment of so vast a\r\nregion, however, can at best afford no more than an outline sketch, in\r\nwhich old and well-known facts must, if possible, be so grouped as to\r\nexplain the position of the section in American history.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulties of the task, there is a definite advantage\r\nin so large a view. By fixing our attention too exclusively upon the\r\nartificial boundary lines of the States, we have failed to perceive much\r\nthat is significant in the westward development of the United States.\r\nFor instance, our colonial system did not begin with the Spanish War;\r\nthe United States has had a colonial history and policy from the\r\nbeginning of the Republic; but they have been hidden under the\r\nphraseology of \"interstate migration\" and \"territorial organization.\"\r\n\r\nThe American people have occupied a spacious wilderness; vast\r\nphysiographic provinces, each with its own peculiarities, have lain\r\nacross the path of this migration, and each has furnished a special\r\nenvironment for economic and social transformation. It is possible to\r\nunderestimate the importance of State lines, but if we direct our gaze\r\nrather to the physiographic province than to the State area, we shall be\r\nable to see some facts in a new light. Then it becomes clear that these\r\nphysiographic provinces of America are in some respects comparable to\r\nthe countries of Europe, and that each has its own history of occupation\r\nand development. General Francis A. Walker once remarked that \"the\r\ncourse of settlement has called upon our people to occupy territory as\r\nextensive as Switzerland, as England, as Italy, and latterly, as France\r\nor Germany, every ten years.\" It is this element of vastness in the\r\nachievements of American democracy that gives a peculiar interest to the\r\nconquest and development of the Middle West. The effects of this\r\nconquest and development upon the present United States have been of\r\nfundamental importance.\r\n\r\nGeographically the Middle West is almost conterminous with the Provinces\r\nof the Lake and Prairie Plains; but the larger share of Kansas and\r\nNebraska, and the western part of the two Dakotas belong to the Great\r\nPlains; the Ozark Mountains occupy a portion of Missouri, and the\r\nsouthern parts of Ohio and Indiana merge into the Alleghany Plateau. The\r\nrelation of the Provinces of the Lake and Prairie Plains to the rest of\r\nthe United States is an important element in the significance of the\r\nMiddle West. On the north lies the similar region of Canada: the Great\r\nLakes are in the center of the whole eastern and more thickly settled\r\nhalf of North America, and they bind the Canadian and Middle Western\r\npeople together. On the south, the provinces meet the apex of that of\r\nthe Gulf Plains, and the Mississippi unites them. To the west, they\r\nmerge gradually into the Great Plains; the Missouri and its tributaries\r\nand the Pacific railroads make for them a bond of union; another rather\r\neffective bond is the interdependence of the cattle of the plains and\r\nthe corn of the prairies. To the east, the province meets the Alleghany\r\nand New England Plateaus, and is connected with them by the upper Ohio\r\nand by the line of the Erie Canal. Here the interaction of industrial\r\nlife and the historical facts of settlement have produced a close\r\nrelationship. The intimate connection between the larger part of the\r\nNorth Central and the North Atlantic divisions of the United States will\r\nimpress any one who examines the industrial and social maps of the\r\ncensus atlas. By reason of these interprovincial relationships, the\r\nMiddle West is the mediator between Canada and the United States, and\r\nbetween the concentrated wealth and manufactures of the North Atlantic\r\nStates and the sparsely settled Western mining, cattle-raising, and\r\nagricultural States. It has a connection with the South that was once\r\nstill closer, and is likely before long to reassert itself with new\r\npower. Within the limits of the United States, therefore, we have\r\nproblems of interprovincial trade and commerce similar to those that\r\nexist between the nations of the Old World.\r\n\r\nOver most of the Province of the Lake and Prairie Plains the Laurentide\r\nglacier spread its drift, rich in limestone and other rock powder, which\r\nfarmers in less favored sections must purchase to replenish the soil.\r\nThe alluvial deposit from primeval lakes contributed to fatten the soil\r\nof other parts of the prairies. Taken as a whole, the Prairie Plains\r\nsurpass in fertility any other region of America or Europe, unless we\r\nexcept some territory about the Black Sea. It is a land marked out as\r\nthe granary of the nation; but it is more than a granary. On the rocky\r\nshores of Lake Superior were concealed copper mines rivaled only by\r\nthose of Montana, and iron fields which now[129:1] furnish the ore for\r\nthe production of eighty per cent of the pig iron of the United States.\r\nThe Great Lakes afford a highway between these iron fields and the coal\r\nareas of the Ohio Valley. The gas and oil deposits of the Ohio Valley,\r\nthe coal of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and eastern Kansas, the lead and\r\nzinc of the Ozark region and of the upper Mississippi Valley, and the\r\ngold of the black Hills,--all contribute underground wealth to the\r\nMiddle West.\r\n\r\nThe primeval American forest once spread its shade over vast portions\r\nof the same province. Ohio, Indiana, southern Michigan, and central\r\nWisconsin were almost covered with a growth of noble deciduous trees. In\r\nsouthern Illinois, along the broad bottom lands of the Mississippi and\r\nthe Illinois, and in southern and southwestern Missouri, similar forests\r\nprevailed. To the north, in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, appeared\r\nthe somber white pine wilderness, interlaced with hard woods, which\r\nswept in ample zone along the Great Lakes, till the deciduous forests\r\ntriumphed again, and, in their turn, faded into the treeless expanse of\r\nthe prairies. In the remaining portions were openings in the midst of\r\nthe forested area, and then the grassy ocean of prairie that rolled to\r\nwest and northwest, until it passed beyond the line of sufficient\r\nrainfall for agriculture without irrigation, into the semi-arid\r\nstretches of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, the forested region of this\r\nprovince was occupied by the wigwams of many different tribes of the\r\nAlgonquin tongue, sparsely scattered in villages along the water\r\ncourses, warring and trading through the vast wilderness. The western\r\nedge of the prairie and the Great Plains were held by the Sioux, chasing\r\nherds of bison across these far-stretching expanses. These horsemen of\r\nthe plains and the canoemen of the Great Lakes and the Ohio were factors\r\nwith which civilization had to reckon, for they constituted important\r\nportions of perhaps the fiercest native race with which the white man\r\nhas ever battled for new lands.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman had done but little fighting for this region. He swore\r\nbrotherhood with its savages, traded with them, intermarried with them,\r\nand explored the Middle West; but he left the wilderness much as he\r\nfound it. Some six or seven thousand French people in all, about Detroit\r\nand Vincennes, and in the Illinois country, and scattered among the\r\nIndian villages of the remote lakes and streams, held possession when\r\nGeorge Washington reached the site of Pittsburgh, bearing Virginia's\r\nsummons of eviction to France. In his person fate knocked at the portals\r\nof a \"rising empire.\" France hurried her commanders and garrisons, with\r\nIndian allies, from the posts about the Great Lakes and the upper\r\nMississippi; but it was in vain. In vain, too, the aftermath of\r\nPontiac's widespread Indian uprising against the English occupation.\r\nWhen she came into possession of the lands between the Ohio, the\r\nMississippi, and the Great Lakes, England organized them as a part of\r\nthe Province of Quebec. The daring conquest of George Rogers Clark left\r\nVirginia in military possession of the Illinois country at the\r\nconclusion of the Revolutionary War; but over all the remainder of the\r\nOld Northwest, England was in control. Although she ceded the region by\r\nthe treaty which closed the Revolution, she remained for many years the\r\nmistress of the Indians and the fur trade. When Lord Shelburne was\r\nupbraided in parliament for yielding the Northwest to the United States,\r\nthe complaint was that he had clothed the Americans \"in the warm\r\ncovering of our fur trade,\" and his defense was that the peltry trade of\r\nthe ceded tract was not sufficiently profitable to warrant further war.\r\nBut the English government became convinced that the Indian trade\r\ndemanded the retention of the Northwest, and she did in fact hold her\r\nposts there in spite of the treaty of peace. Dundas, the English\r\nsecretary for the colonies, expressed the policy, when he declared, in\r\n1792, that the object was to interpose an Indian barrier between Canada\r\nand the United States; and in pursuance of this policy of preserving the\r\nNorthwest as an Indian buffer State, the Canadian authorities supported\r\nthe Indians in their resistance to American settlement beyond the Ohio.\r\nThe conception of the Northwest as an Indian reserve strikingly exhibits\r\nEngland's inability to foresee the future of the region, and to measure\r\nthe forces of American expansion.\r\n\r\nBy the cessions of Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut,\r\nthe Old Congress had come into nominal possession of an extensive public\r\ndomain, and a field for the exercise of national authority. The\r\nsignificance of this fact in the development of national power is not\r\nlikely to be overestimated. The first result was the completion of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787, which provided a territorial government for the Old\r\nNorthwest, with provisions for the admission of States into the Union.\r\nThis federal colonial system guaranteed that the new national\r\npossessions should not be governed as dependent provinces, but should\r\nenter as a group of sister States into the federation.[132:1] While the\r\nimportance of the article excluding slavery has often been pointed out,\r\nit is probable that the provisions for a federal colonial organization\r\nhave been at least equally potential in our actual development. The full\r\nsignificance of this feature of the Ordinance is only appreciated when\r\nwe consider its continuous influence upon the American territorial and\r\nState policy in the westward expansion to the Pacific, and the political\r\npreconceptions with which Americans approach the problems of government\r\nin the new insular possessions. The Land Ordinance of 1785 is also\r\nworthy of attention in this connection, for under its provisions almost\r\nall of the Middle West has been divided by the government surveyor into\r\nrectangles of sections and townships, by whose lines the settler has\r\nbeen able easily and certainly to locate his farm, and the forester his\r\n\"forty.\" In the local organization of the Middle West these lines have\r\nplayed an important part.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible within the limits of this paper to detail the\r\nhistory of the occupation of the Middle West; but the larger aspects of\r\nthe flow of population into the region may be sketched. Massachusetts\r\nmen had formed the Ohio Company, and had been influential in shaping the\r\nliberal provisions of the Ordinance. Their land purchase, paid for in\r\nsoldiers' certificates, embraced an area larger than the State of Rhode\r\nIsland. At Marietta in 1788, under the shelter of Fort Harmar, their\r\nbullet-proof barge landed the first New England colony. A New Jersey\r\ncolony was planted soon after at Cincinnati in the Symmes Purchase. Thus\r\nAmerican civilization crossed the Ohio. The French settlements at\r\nDetroit and in Indiana and Illinois belonged to other times and had\r\ntheir own ideals; but with the entrance of the American pioneer into the\r\nforest of the Middle West, a new era began. The Indians, with the moral\r\nsupport of England, resisted the invasion, and an Indian war followed.\r\nThe conquest of Wayne, in 1795, pushed back the Indians to the\r\nGreenville line, extending irregularly across the State of Ohio from the\r\nsite of Cleveland to Fort Recovery in the middle point of her present\r\nwestern boundary, and secured certain areas in Indiana. In the same\r\nperiod Jay's treaty provided for the withdrawal of the British posts.\r\nAfter this extension of the area open to the pioneer, new settlements\r\nwere rapidly formed. Connecticut disposed of her reserved land about\r\nLake Erie to companies, and in 1796 General Moses Cleaveland led the way\r\nto the site of the city that bears his name. This was the beginning of\r\nthe occupation of the Western Reserve, a district about as large as the\r\nparent State of Connecticut, a New England colony in the Middle West,\r\nwhich has maintained, even to the present time, the impress of New\r\nEngland traits. Virginia and Kentucky settlers sought the Virginia\r\nMilitary Bounty Lands, and the foundation of Chillicothe here, in 1796,\r\nafforded a center for Southern settlement. The region is a modified\r\nextension of the limestone area of Kentucky, and naturally attracted the\r\nemigrants from the Blue Grass State. Ohio's history is deeply marked by\r\nthe interaction of the New England, Middle, and Southern colonies within\r\nher borders.\r\n\r\nBy the opening of the nineteenth century, when Napoleon's cession\r\nbrought to the United States the vast spaces of the Louisiana Purchase\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, the pioneers had hardly more than entered the\r\noutskirts of the forest along the Ohio and Lake Erie. But by 1810 the\r\ngovernment had extinguished the Indian title to the unsecured portions\r\nof the Western Reserve, and to great tracts of Indiana, along the Ohio\r\nand up the Wabash Valley; thus protecting the Ohio highway from the\r\nIndians, and opening new lands to settlement. The embargo had destroyed\r\nthe trade of New England, and had weighted down her citizens with debt\r\nand taxation; caravans of Yankee emigrant wagons, precursors of the\r\n\"prairie schooner,\" had already begun to cross Pennsylvania on their way\r\nto Ohio; and they now greatly increased in number. North Carolina back\r\ncountrymen flocked to the Indiana settlements, giving the peculiar\r\nHoosier flavor to the State, and other Southerners followed,\r\noutnumbering the Northern immigrants, who sought the eastern edge of\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nTecumthe, rendered desperate by the advance into his hunting grounds,\r\ntook up the hatchet, made wide-reaching alliances among the Indians, and\r\nturned to England for protection. The Indian war merged into the War of\r\n1812, and the settlers strove in vain to add Canadian lands to their\r\nempire. In the diplomatic negotiations that followed the war, England\r\nmade another attempt to erect the Old Northwest beyond the Greenville\r\nline into a permanent Indian barrier between Canada and the United\r\nStates; but the demand was refused, and by the treaties of 1818, the\r\nIndians were pressed still farther north. In the meantime, Indian\r\ntreaties had released additional land in southern Illinois, and pioneers\r\nwere widening the bounds of the old French settlements. Avoiding the\r\nrich savannas of the prairie regions, as devoid of wood, remote from\r\ntransportation facilities, and suited only to grazing, they entered the\r\nhard woods--and in the early twenties they were advancing in a\r\nwedge-shaped column up the Illinois Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Southern element constituted the main portion of this phalanx of\r\nax-bearers. Abraham Lincoln's father joined the throng of Kentuckians\r\nthat entered the Indiana woods in 1816, and the boy, when he had learned\r\nto hew out a forest home, betook himself, in 1830, to Sangamon county,\r\nIllinois. He represents the pioneer of the period; but his ax sank\r\ndeeper than other men's, and the plaster cast of his great sinewy hand,\r\nat Washington, embodies the training of these frontier railsplitters, in\r\nthe days when Fort Dearborn, on the site of Chicago, was but a military\r\noutpost in a desolate country. While the hard woods of Illinois were\r\nbeing entered, the pioneer movement passed also into the Missouri\r\nValley. The French lead miners had already opened the southeastern\r\nsection, and Southern mountaineers had pushed up the Missouri; but now\r\nthe planters from the Ohio Valley and the upper Tennessee followed,\r\nseeking the alluvial soils for slave labor. Moving across the southern\r\nborder of free Illinois, they had awakened regrets in that State at the\r\nloss of so large a body of settlers.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Middle West, as a whole, in the decade from 1810 to 1820,\r\nwe perceive that settlement extended from the shores of Lake Erie in an\r\narc, following the banks of the Ohio till it joined the Mississippi, and\r\nthence along that river and up the Missouri well into the center of the\r\nState. The next decade was marked by the increased use of the steamboat;\r\npioneers pressed farther up the streams, etching out the hard wood\r\nforests well up to the prairie lands, and forming additional tracts of\r\nsettlement in the region tributary to Detroit and in the southeastern\r\npart of Michigan. In the area of the Galena lead mines of northwestern\r\nIllinois, southwestern Wisconsin, and northeastern Iowa, Southerners had\r\nalready begun operations; and if we except Ohio and Michigan, the\r\ndominant element in all this overflow of settlement into the Middle West\r\nwas Southern, particularly from Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina.\r\nThe settlements were still dependent on the rivers for transportation,\r\nand the areas between the rivers were but lightly occupied. The\r\nMississippi constituted the principal outlet for the products of the\r\nMiddle West; Pittsburgh furnished most of the supplies for the region,\r\nbut New Orleans received its crops. The Old National road was built\r\npiecemeal, and too late, as a whole, to make a great artery of trade\r\nthroughout the Middle West, in this early period; but it marked the\r\nnorthern borders of the Southern stream of population, running, as this\r\ndid, through Columbus, Indianapolis, and Vandalia.\r\n\r\nThe twenty years from 1830 to 1850 saw great changes in the composition\r\nof the population of the Middle West. The opening of the Erie Canal in\r\n1825 was an epoch-making event. It furnished a new outlet and inlet for\r\nnorthwestern traffic; Buffalo began to grow, and New York City changed\r\nfrom a local market to a great commercial center. But even more\r\nimportant was the place which the canal occupied as the highway for a\r\nnew migration.\r\n\r\nIn the march of the New England people from the coast, three movements\r\nare of especial importance: the advance from the seaboard up the\r\nConnecticut and Housatonic Valleys through Massachusetts and into\r\nVermont; the advance thence to central and western New York; and the\r\nadvance to the interior of the Old Northwest. The second of these stages\r\noccupied the generation from about 1790 to 1820; after that the second\r\ngeneration was ready to seek new lands; and these the Erie Canal and\r\nlake navigation opened to them, and to the Vermonters and other\r\nadventurous spirits of New England. It was this combined New York-New\r\nEngland stream that in the thirties poured in large volume into the zone\r\nnorth of the settlements which have been described. The newcomers filled\r\nin the southern counties of Michigan and Wisconsin, the northern\r\ncountries of Illinois, and parts of the northern and central areas of\r\nIndiana. Pennsylvania and Ohio sent a similar type of people to the area\r\nadjacent to those States. In Iowa a stream combined of the Southern\r\nelement and of these settlers sought the wooded tributaries of the\r\nMississippi in the southeastern part of the State. In default of legal\r\nauthority, in this early period, they formed squatter governments and\r\nland associations, comparable to the action of the Massachusetts men who\r\nin the first quarter of the seventeenth century \"squatted\" in the\r\nConnecticut Valley.\r\n\r\nA great forward movement had occurred, which took possession of oak\r\nopenings and prairies, gave birth to the cities of Chicago, Milwaukee,\r\nSt. Paul, and Minneapolis, as well as to a multitude of lesser cities,\r\nand replaced the dominance of the Southern element by that of a modified\r\nPuritan stock. The railroad system of the early fifties bound the\r\nMississippi to the North Atlantic seaboard; New Orleans gave way to New\r\nYork as the outlet for the Middle West, and the day of river settlement\r\nwas succeeded by the era of inter-river settlement and railway\r\ntransportation. The change in the political and social ideals was at\r\nleast equal to the change in economic connections, and together these\r\nforces made an intimate organic union between New England, New York, and\r\nthe newly settled West. In estimating the New England influence in the\r\nMiddle West, it must not be forgotten that the New York settlers were\r\nmainly New Englanders of a later generation.\r\n\r\nCombined with the streams from the East came the German migration into\r\nthe Middle West. Over half a million, mainly from the Palatinate,\r\nWürtemberg, and the adjacent regions, sought America between 1830 and\r\n1850, and nearly a million more Germans came in the next decade. The\r\nlarger portion of these went into the Middle West; they became pioneers\r\nin the newer parts of Ohio, especially along the central ridge, and in\r\nCincinnati; they took up the hardwood lands of the Wisconsin counties\r\nalong Lake Michigan; and they came in important numbers to Missouri,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, and Michigan, and to the river towns of Iowa. The\r\nmigration in the thirties and forties contained an exceptionally large\r\nproportion of educated and forceful leaders, men who had struggled in\r\nvain for the ideal of a liberal German nation, and who contributed\r\nimportant intellectual forces to the communities in which they settled.\r\nThe Germans, as a whole, furnished a conservative and thrifty\r\nagricultural element to the Middle West. In some of their social ideals\r\nthey came into collision with the Puritan element from New England, and\r\nthe outcome of the steady contest has been a compromise. Of all the\r\nStates, Wisconsin has been most deeply influenced by the Germans.\r\n\r\nBy the later fifties, therefore, the control of the Middle West had\r\npassed to its Northern zone of population, and this zone included\r\nrepresentatives of the Middle States, New England, and Germany as its\r\nprincipal elements. The Southern people, north of the Ohio, differed in\r\nimportant respects from the Southerners across the river. They had\r\nsprung largely from the humbler classes of the South, although there\r\nwere important exceptions. The early pioneer life, however, was\r\nill-suited to the great plantations, and slavery was excluded under the\r\nOrdinance. Thus this Southern zone of the Middle West, particularly in\r\nIndiana and Illinois, constituted a mediating section between the South\r\nand the North. The Mississippi still acted as a bond of union, and up to\r\nthe close of the War of 1812 the Valley, north and south, had been\r\nfundamentally of the same social organization. In order to understand\r\nwhat follows, we must bear in mind the outlines of the occupation of the\r\nGulf Plains. While settlement had been crossing the Ohio to the\r\nNorthwest, the spread of cotton culture and negro slavery into the\r\nSouthwest had been equally significant. What the New England States and\r\nNew York were in the occupation of the Middle West, Virginia, the\r\nCarolinas, and Georgia were in the occupation of the Gulf States. But,\r\nas in the case of the Northwest, a modification of the original stock\r\noccurred in the new environment. A greater energy and initiative\r\nappeared in the new Southern lands; the pioneer's devotion to exploiting\r\nthe territory in which he was placed transferred slavery from the\r\npatriarchal to the commercial basis. The same expansive tendency seen in\r\nthe Northwest revealed itself, with a belligerent seasoning, in the Gulf\r\nStates. They had a program of action. Abraham Lincoln migrated from\r\nKentucky to Indiana and to Illinois. Jefferson Davis moved from Kentucky\r\nto Louisiana, and thence to Mississippi, in the same period. Starting\r\nfrom the same locality, each represented the divergent flow of streams\r\nof settlement into contrasted environments. The result of these\r\nantagonistic streams of migration to the West was a struggle between the\r\nLake and Prairie plainsmen, on the one side, and the Gulf plainsmen, on\r\nthe other, for the possession of the Mississippi Valley. It was the\r\ncrucial part of the struggle between the Northern and Southern sections\r\nof the nation. What gave slavery and State sovereignty their power as\r\nissues was the fact that they involved the question of dominance over\r\ncommon territory in an expanding nation. The place of the Middle West in\r\nthe origin and settlement of the great slavery struggle is of the\r\nhighest significance.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, a modified form of\r\nslavery existed under a system of indenture of the colored servant; and\r\nthe effort of Southern settlers in Indiana and in Illinois to\r\nreintroduce slavery are indicative of the importance of the pro-slavery\r\nelement in the Northwest. But the most significant early manifestation\r\nof the rival currents of migration with respect to slavery is seen in\r\nthe contest which culminated in the Missouri Compromise. The historical\r\nobstacle of the Ordinance, as well as natural conditions, gave an\r\nadvantage to the anti-slavery settlers northwest of the Ohio; but when\r\nthe Mississippi was crossed, and the rival streams of settlement mingled\r\nin the area of the Louisiana Purchase, the struggle followed. It was an\r\nIllinois man, with constituents in both currents of settlement, who\r\nintroduced the Missouri Compromise, which made a _modus vivendi_ for the\r\nMiddle West, until the Compromise of 1850 gave to Senator Douglas of\r\nIllinois, in 1854, the opportunity to reopen the issue by his\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill. In his doctrine of \"squatter-sovereignty,\" or the\r\nright of the territories to determine the question of slavery within\r\ntheir bounds, Douglas utilized a favorite Western political idea, one\r\nwhich Cass of Michigan had promulgated before. Douglas set the love of\r\nthe Middle West for local self-government against its preponderant\r\nantipathy to the spread of slavery. At the same time he brought to the\r\nsupport of the doctrine the Democratic party, which ever since the days\r\nof Andrew Jackson had voiced the love of the frontier for individualism\r\nand for popular power. In his \"Young America\" doctrines Douglas had also\r\nmade himself the spokesman of Western expansive tendencies. He thus\r\nfound important sources of popular support when he invoked the localism\r\nof his section. Western appeals to Congress for aid in internal\r\nimprovements, protective tariffs, and land grants had been indications\r\nof nationalism. The doctrine of squatter-sovereignty itself catered to\r\nthe love of national union by presenting the appearance of a\r\nnon-sectional compromise, which should allow the new areas of the Middle\r\nWest to determine their own institutions. But the Free Soil party,\r\nstrongest in the regions occupied by the New York-New England colonists,\r\nand having for its program national prohibition of the spread of slavery\r\ninto the territories, had already found in the Middle West an important\r\ncenter of power. The strength of the movement far surpassed the actual\r\nvoting power of the Free Soil party, for it compelled both Whigs and\r\nDemocrats to propose fusion on the basis of concession to Free Soil\r\ndoctrines. The New England settlers and the western New York\r\nsettlers,--the children of New England,--were keenly alive to the\r\nimportance of the issue. Indeed, Seward, in an address at Madison,\r\nWisconsin, in 1860, declared that the Northwest, in reality, extended to\r\nthe base of the Alleghanies, and that the new States had \"matured just\r\nin the critical moment to rally the free States of the Atlantic coast,\r\nto call them back to their ancient principles.\"\r\n\r\nThese Free Soil forces and the nationalistic tendencies of the Middle\r\nWest proved too strong for the opposing doctrines when the real struggle\r\ncame. Calhoun and Taney shaped the issue so logically that the Middle\r\nWest saw that the contest was not only a war for the preservation of the\r\nUnion, but also a war for the possession of the unoccupied West, a\r\nstruggle between the Middle West and the States of the Gulf Plains. The\r\neconomic life of the Middle West had been bound by the railroad to the\r\nNorth Atlantic, and its interests, as well as its love of national\r\nunity, made it in every way hostile to secession. When Dr. Cutler had\r\nurged the desires of the Ohio Company upon Congress, in 1787, he had\r\npromised to plant in the Ohio Valley a colony that would stand for the\r\nUnion. Vinton of Ohio, in arguing for the admission of Iowa, urged the\r\nposition of the Middle West as the great unifying section of the\r\ncountry: \"Disunion,\" he said, \"is ruin to them. They have no\r\nalternative but to resist it whenever or wherever attempted. . . .\r\nMassachusetts and South Carolina might, for aught I know, find a\r\ndividing line that would be mutually satisfactory to them; but, Sir,\r\nthey can find no such line to which the western country can assent.\" But\r\nit was Abraham Lincoln who stated the issue with the greatest precision,\r\nand who voiced most clearly the nationalism of the Middle West, when he\r\ndeclared, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this\r\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was that when the civil war in Kansas grew into the Civil War in\r\nthe Union, after Lincoln's election to the presidency, the Middle West,\r\ndominated by its combined Puritan and German population, ceased to\r\ncompromise, and turned the scale in favor of the North. The Middle West\r\nfurnished more than one-third of the Union troops. The names of Grant\r\nand Sherman are sufficient testimony to her leadership in the field. The\r\nnames of Lincoln and Chase show that the presidential, the financial,\r\nand the war powers were in the hands of the Middle West. If we were to\r\naccept Seward's own classification, the conduct of foreign affairs as\r\nwell belonged to the same section; it was, at least, in the hands of\r\nrepresentatives of the dominant forces of the section. The Middle West,\r\nled by Grant and Sherman, hewed its way down the Mississippi and across\r\nthe Gulf States, and Lincoln could exult in 1863, \"The Father of Waters\r\nagain goes unvexed to the sea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it, nor\r\nyet wholly to them.\"\r\n\r\nIn thus outlining the relations of the Middle West to the slavery\r\nstruggle, we have passed over important extensions of settlement in the\r\ndecade before the war. In these years, not only did the density of\r\nsettlement increase in the older portions of the region, but new waves\r\nof colonization passed into the remoter prairies. Iowa's pioneers,\r\nafter Indian cessions had been secured, spread well toward her western\r\nlimits. Minnesota, also, was recruited by a column of pioneers. The\r\ntreaty of Traverse de Sioux, in 1851, opened over twenty million acres\r\nof arable land in that State, and Minnesota increased her population\r\n2730.7 per cent in the decade from 1850 to 1860.\r\n\r\nUp to this decade the pine belt of the Middle West, in northern\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota had been the field of operations of\r\nIndian traders. At first under English companies, and afterward under\r\nAstor's American Fur Company, the traders with their French and\r\nhalf-breed boatmen skirted the Great Lakes and followed the rivers into\r\nthe forests, where they stationed their posts and spread goods and\r\nwhiskey among the Indians. Their posts were centers of disintegration\r\namong the savages. The new wants and the demoralization which resulted\r\nfrom the Indian trade facilitated the purchases of their lands by the\r\nfederal government. The trader was followed by the seeker for the best\r\npine land \"forties\"; and by the time of the Civil War the exploitation\r\nof the pine belt had fairly begun. The Irish and Canadian choppers,\r\nfollowed by the Scandinavians, joined the forest men, and log drives\r\nsucceeded the trading canoe. Men from the pine woods of Maine and\r\nVermont directed the industry, and became magnates in the mill towns\r\nthat grew up in the forests,--millionaires, and afterwards political\r\nleaders. In the prairie country of the Middle West, the Indian trade\r\nthat centered at St. Louis had been important ever since 1820, with an\r\ninfluence upon the Indians of the plains similar to the influence of the\r\nnorthern fur trade upon the Indians of the forest. By 1840 the removal\r\npolicy had effected the transfer of most of the eastern tribes to lands\r\nacross the Mississippi. Tribal names that formerly belonged to Ohio and\r\nthe rest of the Old Northwest were found on the map of the Kansas\r\nValley. The Platte country belonged to the Pawnee and their neighbors,\r\nand to the north along the Upper Missouri were the Sioux, or Dakota,\r\nCrow, Cheyenne, and other horse Indians, following the vast herds of\r\nbuffalo that grazed on the Great Plains. The discovery of California\r\ngold and the opening of the Oregon country, in the middle of the\r\ncentury, made it necessary to secure a road through the Indian lands for\r\nthe procession of pioneers that crossed the prairies to the Pacific. The\r\norganization of Kansas and Nebraska, in 1854, was the first step in the\r\nwithdrawal of these territories from the Indians. A period of almost\r\nconstant Indian hostility followed, for the savage lords of the\r\nboundless prairies instinctively felt the significance of the entrance\r\nof the farmer into their empire. In Minnesota the Sioux took advantage\r\nof the Civil War to rise; but the outcome was the destruction of their\r\nreservations in that State, and the opening of great tracts to the\r\npioneers. When the Pacific railways were begun, Red Cloud, the astute\r\nSioux chief, who, in some ways, stands as the successor of Pontiac and\r\nof Tecumthe, rallied the principal tribes of the Great Plains to resist\r\nthe march of civilization. Their hostility resulted in the peace measure\r\nof 1867 and 1868, which assigned to the Sioux and their allies\r\nreservations embracing the major portion of Dakota territory, west of\r\nthe Missouri River. The systematic slaughter of millions of buffalo, in\r\nthe years between 1866 and 1873, for the sake of their hides, put an end\r\nto the vast herds of the Great Plains, and destroyed the economic\r\nfoundation of the Indians. Henceforth they were dependent on the whites\r\nfor their food supply, and the Great Plains were open to the cattle\r\nranchers.\r\n\r\nIn a preface written in 1872 for a new edition of \"The Oregon Trail,\"\r\nwhich had appeared in 1847, Francis Parkman said, \"The wild cavalcade\r\nthat defiled with me down the gorges of the Black Hills, with its paint\r\nand war plumes, fluttering trophies and savage embroidery, bows, arrows,\r\nlances, and shields, will never be seen again.\" The prairies were ready\r\nfor the final rush of occupation. The homestead law of 1862, passed in\r\nthe midst of the war, did not reveal its full importance as an element\r\nin the settlement of the Middle West until after peace. It began to\r\noperate most actively, contemporaneously with the development of the\r\nseveral railways to the Pacific, in the two decades from 1870 to 1890,\r\nand in connection with the marketing of the railroad land grants. The\r\noutcome was an epoch-making extension of population.\r\n\r\nBefore 1870 the vast and fertile valley of the Red River, once the level\r\nbed of an ancient lake, occupying the region where North Dakota and\r\nMinnesota meet, was almost virgin soil. But in 1875 the great Dalrymple\r\nfarm showed its advantages for wheat raising, and a tide of farm seekers\r\nturned to the region. The \"Jim River\" Valley of South Dakota attracted\r\nstill other settlers. The Northern Pacific and the Great Northern\r\nRailway thrust out laterals into these Minnesota and Dakota wheat areas\r\nfrom which to draw the nourishment for their daring passage to the\r\nPacific. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, the Chicago and\r\nNorthwestern Railway, Burlington, and other roads, gridironed the\r\nregion; and the unoccupied lands of the Middle West were taken up by a\r\nmigration that in its system and scale is unprecedented. The railroads\r\nsent their agents and their literature everywhere, \"booming\" the \"Golden\r\nWest\"; the opportunity for economic and political fortunes in such\r\nrapidly growing communities attracted multitudes of Americans whom the\r\ncheap land alone would not have tempted. In 1870 the Dakotas had 14,000\r\nsettlers; in 1890 they had over 510,000. Nebraska's population was\r\n28,000 in 1860; 123,000 in 1870; 452,000 in 1880; and 1,059,000 in\r\n1890. Kansas had 107,000 in 1860; 364,000 in 1870; 996,000 in 1880; and\r\n1,427,000 in 1890. Wisconsin and New York gave the largest fractions of\r\nthe native element to Minnesota; Illinois and Ohio together sent perhaps\r\none-third of the native element of Kansas and Nebraska, but the Missouri\r\nand Southern settlers were strongly represented in Kansas; Wisconsin,\r\nNew York, Minnesota, and Iowa gave North Dakota the most of her native\r\nsettlers; and Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and New York did the same for\r\nSouth Dakota.\r\n\r\nRailroads and steamships organized foreign immigration on scale and\r\nsystem never before equaled; a high-water mark of American immigration\r\ncame in the early eighties. Germans and Scandinavians were rushed by\r\nemigrant trains out to the prairies, to fill the remaining spaces in the\r\nolder States of the Middle West. The census of 1890 showed in Minnesota\r\n373,000 persons of Scandinavian parentage, and out of the total million\r\nand one-half persons of Scandinavian parentage in the United States, the\r\nMiddle West received all but about three hundred thousand. The persons\r\nof German parentage in the Middle West numbered over four millions out\r\nof a total of less than seven millions in the whole country. The\r\nprovince had, in 1890, a smaller proportion of persons of foreign\r\nparentage than had the North Atlantic division, but the proportions\r\nvaried greatly in the different States. Indiana had the lowest\r\npercentage, 20.38; and, rising in the scale, Missouri had 24.94; Kansas\r\n26.75; Ohio 33.93; Nebraska 42.45; Iowa 43.57; Illinois 49.01; Michigan\r\n54.58; Wisconsin 73.65; Minnesota 75.37; and North Dakota 78.87.\r\n\r\nWhat these statistics of settlement mean when translated into the\r\npioneer life of the prairie, cannot be told here. There were sharp\r\ncontrasts with the pioneer life of the Old Northwest; for the forest\r\nshade, there was substituted the boundless prairie; the sod house for\r\nthe log hut; the continental railway for the old National Turnpike and\r\nthe Erie Canal. Life moved faster, in larger masses, and with greater\r\nmomentum in this pioneer movement. The horizon line was more remote.\r\nThings were done in the gross. The transcontinental railroad, the\r\nbonanza farm, the steam plow, harvester, and thresher, the \"league-long\r\nfurrow,\" and the vast cattle ranches, all suggested spacious combination\r\nand systematization of industry. The largest hopes were excited by these\r\nconquests of the prairie. The occupation of western Kansas may\r\nillustrate the movement which went on also in the west of Nebraska and\r\nthe Dakotas. The pioneer farmer tried to push into the region with the\r\nold methods of settlement. Deceived by rainy seasons and the railroad\r\nadvertisements, and recklessly optimistic, hosts of settlers poured out\r\ninto the plains beyond the region of sufficient rainfall for successful\r\nagriculture without irrigation. Dry seasons starved them back; but a\r\nrepetition of good rainfalls again aroused the determination to occupy\r\nthe western plains. Boom towns flourished like prairie weeds; Eastern\r\ncapital struggled for a chance to share in the venture, and the Kansas\r\nfarmers eagerly mortgaged their possessions to secure the capital so\r\nfreely offered for their attack on the arid lands. By 1887 the tide of\r\nthe pioneer farmers had flowed across the semi-arid plains to the\r\nwestern boundary of the State. But it was a hopeless effort to conquer a\r\nnew province by the forces that had won the prairies. The wave of\r\nsettlement dashed itself in vain against the conditions of the Great\r\nPlains. The native American farmer had received his first defeat; farm\r\nproducts at the same period had depreciated, and he turned to the\r\nnational government for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThe Populistic movement of the western half of the Middle West is a\r\ncomplex of many forces. In some respects it is the latest manifestation\r\nof the same forces that brought on the crisis of 1837 in the earlier\r\nregion of pioneer exploitation. That era of over-confidence, reckless\r\ninternal improvements, and land purchases by borrowed capital, brought a\r\nreaction when it became apparent that the future had been\r\nover-discounted. But, in that time, there were the farther free lands to\r\nwhich the ruined pioneer could turn. The demand for an expansion of the\r\ncurrency has marked each area of Western advance. The greenback movement\r\nof Ohio and the eastern part of the Middle West grew into the fiat\r\nmoney, free silver, and land bank propositions of the Populists across\r\nthe Mississippi. Efforts for cheaper transportation also appear in each\r\nstage of Western advance. When the pioneer left the rivers and had to\r\nhaul his crops by wagon to a market, the transportation factor\r\ndetermined both his profits and the extension of settlement. Demands for\r\nnational aid to roads and canals had marked the pioneer advance of the\r\nfirst third of the century. The \"Granger\" attacks upon the railway\r\nrates, and in favor of governmental regulation, marked a second advance\r\nof Western settlement. The Farmers' Alliance and the Populist demand for\r\ngovernment ownership of the railroad is a phase of the same effort of\r\nthe pioneer farmer, on his latest frontier. The proposals have taken\r\nincreasing proportions in each region of Western Advance. Taken as a\r\nwhole, Populism is a manifestation of the old pioneer ideals of the\r\nnative American, with the added element of increasing readiness to\r\nutilize the national government to effect its ends. This is not\r\nunnatural in a section whose lands were originally purchased by the\r\ngovernment and given away to its settlers by the same authority, whose\r\nrailroads were built largely by federal land grants, and whose\r\nsettlements were protected by the United States army and governed by the\r\nnational authority until they were carved into rectangular States and\r\nadmitted into the Union. Its native settlers were drawn from many\r\nStates, many of them former soldiers of the Civil War, who mingled in\r\nnew lands with foreign immigrants accustomed to the vigorous authority\r\nof European national governments.\r\n\r\nBut these old ideals of the American pioneer, phrased in the new\r\nlanguage of national power, did not meet with the assent of the East.\r\nEven in the Middle West a change of deepest import had been in progress\r\nduring these years of prairie settlement. The agricultural preponderance\r\nof the country has passed to the prairies, and manufacturing has\r\ndeveloped in the areas once devoted to pioneer farming. In the decade\r\nprior to the Civil War, the area of greatest wheat production passed\r\nfrom Ohio and the States to the east, into Illinois, Indiana, and\r\nWisconsin; after 1880, the center of wheat growing moved across the\r\nMississippi; and in 1890 the new settlements produced half the crop of\r\nthe United States. The corn area shows a similar migration. In 1840 the\r\nSouthern States produced half the crop, and the Middle West one-fifth;\r\nby 1860 the situation was reversed and in 1890 nearly one-half the corn\r\nof the Union came from beyond the Mississippi. Thus the settlers of the\r\nOld Northwest and their crops have moved together across the\r\nMississippi, and in the regions whence they migrated varied agriculture\r\nand manufacture have sprung up.\r\n\r\nAs these movements in population and products have passed across the\r\nMiddle West, and as the economic life of the eastern border has been\r\nintensified, a huge industrial organism has been created in the\r\nprovince,--an organism of tremendous power, activity, and unity.\r\nFundamentally the Middle West is an agricultural area unequaled for its\r\ncombination of space, variety, productiveness, and freedom from\r\ninterruption by deserts or mountains. The huge water system of the Great\r\nLakes has become the highway of a mighty commerce. The Sault Ste. Marie\r\nCanal, although open but two-thirds of the year, is the channel of a\r\ntraffic of greater tonnage than that which passes through the Suez\r\nCanal, and nearly all this commerce moves almost the whole length of the\r\nGreat Lakes system; the chief ports being Duluth, Chicago, Detroit,\r\nCleveland, and Buffalo. The transportation facilities of the Great Lakes\r\nwere revolutionized after 1886, to supply the needs of commerce between\r\nthe East and the newly developed lands of the Middle West; the tonnage\r\ndoubled; wooden ships gave way to steel; sailing vessels yielded to\r\nsteam; and huge docks, derricks, and elevators, triumphs of mechanical\r\nskill, were constructed. A competent investigator has lately declared\r\nthat \"there is probably in the world to-day no place at tide water where\r\nship plates can be laid down for a less price than they can be\r\nmanufactured or purchased at the lake ports.\"\r\n\r\nThis rapid rise of the merchant marine of our inland seas has led to the\r\ndemand for deep water canals to connect them with the ocean road to\r\nEurope. When the fleets of the Great Lakes plow the Atlantic, and when\r\nDuluth and Chicago become seaports, the water transportation of the\r\nMiddle West will have completed its evolution. The significance of the\r\ndevelopment of the railway systems is not inferior to that of the great\r\nwater way. Chicago has become the greatest railroad center of the world,\r\nnor is there another area of like size which equals this in its railroad\r\nfacilities; all the forces of the nation intersect here. Improved\r\nterminals, steel rails, better rolling stock, and consolidation of\r\nrailway systems have accompanied the advance of the people of the Middle\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThis unparalleled development of transportation facilities measures the\r\nmagnitude of the material development of the province. Its wheat and\r\ncorn surplus supplies the deficit of the rest of the United States and\r\nmuch of that of Europe. Such is the agricultural condition of the\r\nprovince of which Monroe wrote to Jefferson, in 1786, in these words: \"A\r\ngreat part of the territory is miserably poor, especially that near\r\nLakes Michigan and Erie, and that upon the Mississippi and the Illinois\r\nconsists of extensive plains which have not had, from appearances, and\r\nwill not have, a single bush on them for ages. The districts, therefore,\r\nwithin which these fall will never contain a sufficient number of\r\ninhabitants to entitle them to membership in the confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nMinneapolis and Duluth receive the spring wheat of the northern\r\nprairies, and after manufacturing great portions of it into flour,\r\ntransmit it to Buffalo, the eastern cities, and to Europe. Chicago is\r\nstill the great city of the corn belt, but its power as a milling and\r\nwheat center has been passing to the cities that receive tribute from\r\nthe northern prairies. It lies in the region of winter wheat, corn,\r\noats, and live stock. Kansas City, St. Louis, and Cincinnati are the\r\nsister cities of this zone, which reaches into the grazing country of\r\nthe Great Plains. The meeting point of corn and cattle has led to the\r\ndevelopment of the packing industries,--large business systems that send\r\nthe beef and pork of the region to supply the East and parts of Europe.\r\nThe \"feeding system\" adopted in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, whereby the\r\nstock is fattened from the surplus corn of the region, constitutes a\r\nspecies of varied farming that has saved these States from the disasters\r\nof the failure of a single industry, and has been one solution of the\r\neconomic life of the transition belt between the prairies and the Great\r\nPlains. Under a more complex agriculture, better adapted to the various\r\nsections of the State, and with better crops, Kansas has become more\r\nprosperous and less a center of political discontent.\r\n\r\nWhile this development of the agricultural interests of the Middle West\r\nhas been in progress, the exploitation of the pine woods of the north\r\nhas furnished another contribution to the commerce of the province. The\r\ncenter of activity has migrated from Michigan to Minnesota, and the\r\nlumber traffic furnishes one of the principal contributions to the\r\nvessels that ply the Great Lakes and supply the tributary mills. As the\r\nwhite pine vanishes before the organized forces of exploitation, the\r\nremaining hard woods serve to establish factories in the former mill\r\ntowns. The more fertile denuded lands of the north are now receiving\r\nsettlers who repeat the old pioneer life among the stumps.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking development in the industrial history of the\r\nMiddle West in recent years has been due to the opening up of the iron\r\nmines of Lake Superior. Even in 1873 the Lake Superior ores furnished a\r\nquarter of the total production of American blast furnaces. The opening\r\nof the Gogebic mines in 1884, and the development of the Vermillion and\r\nMesabi mines adjacent to the head of the lake, in the early nineties,\r\ncompleted the transfer of iron ore production to the Lake Superior\r\nregion. Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin together now produce the ore\r\nfor eighty per cent of the pig iron of the United States. Four-fifths of\r\nthis great product moves to the ports on Lake Erie and the rest to the\r\nmanufactories at Chicago and Milwaukee. The vast steel and iron industry\r\nthat centers at Pittsburgh and Cleveland, with important outposts like\r\nChicago and Milwaukee, is the outcome of the meeting of the coal of the\r\neastern and southern borders of the province and of Pennsylvania, with\r\nthe iron ores of the north. The industry has been systematized and\r\nconsolidated by a few captains of industry. Steam shovels dig the ore\r\nfrom many of the Mesabi mines; gravity roads carry it to the docks and\r\nto the ships, and huge hoisting and carrying devices, built especially\r\nfor the traffic, unload it for the railroad and the furnace. Iron and\r\ncoal mines, transportation fleets, railroad systems, and iron\r\nmanufactories are concentrated in a few corporations, principally the\r\nUnited States Steel Corporation. The world has never seen such a\r\nconsolidation of capital and so complete a systematization of economic\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nSuch is the economic appearance of the Middle West a century after the\r\npioneers left the frontier village of Pittsburgh and crossed the Ohio\r\ninto the forests. De Tocqueville exclaimed, with reason, in 1833: \"This\r\ngradual and continuous progress of the European race toward the Rocky\r\nMountains has the solemnity of a providential event. It is like a deluge\r\nof men, rising unabatedly, and driven daily onward by the hand of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe ideals of the Middle West began in the log huts set in the midst of\r\nthe forest a century ago. While his horizon was still bounded by the\r\nclearing that his ax had made, the pioneer dreamed of continental\r\nconquests. The vastness of the wilderness kindled his imagination. His\r\nvision saw beyond the dank swamp at the edge of the great lake to the\r\nlofty buildings and the jostling multitudes of a mighty city; beyond the\r\nrank, grass-clad prairie to the seas of golden grain; beyond the harsh\r\nlife of the log hut and the sod house to the home of his children, where\r\nshould dwell comfort and the higher things of life, though they might\r\nnot be for him. The men and women who made the Middle West were\r\nidealists, and they had the power of will to make their dreams come\r\ntrue. Here, also, were the pioneer's traits,--individual activity,\r\ninventiveness, and competition for the prizes of the rich province that\r\nawaited exploitation under freedom and equality of opportunity. He\r\nhonored the man whose eye was the quickest and whose grasp was the\r\nstrongest in this contest: it was \"every one for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe early society of the Middle West was not a complex, highly\r\ndifferentiated and organized society. Almost every family was a\r\nself-sufficing unit, and liberty and equality flourished in the\r\nfrontier periods of the Middle West as perhaps never before in history.\r\nAmerican democracy came from the forest, and its destiny drove it to\r\nmaterial conquests; but the materialism of the pioneer was not the dull\r\ncontented materialism of an old and fixed society. Both native settler\r\nand European immigrant saw in this free and competitive movement of the\r\nfrontier the chance to break the bondage of social rank, and to rise to\r\na higher plane of existence. The pioneer was passionately desirous to\r\nsecure for himself and for his family a favorable place in the midst of\r\nthese large and free but vanishing opportunities. It took a century for\r\nthis society to fit itself into the conditions of the whole province.\r\nLittle by little, nature pressed into her mold the plastic pioneer life.\r\nThe Middle West, yesterday a pioneer province, is to-day the field of\r\nindustrial resources and systematization so vast that Europe, alarmed\r\nfor her industries in competition with this new power, is discussing the\r\npolicy of forming protective alliances among the nations of the\r\ncontinent. Into this region flowed the great forces of modern\r\ncapitalism. Indeed, the region itself furnished favorable conditions for\r\nthe creation of these forces, and trained many of the famous American\r\nindustrial leaders. The Prairies, the Great Plains, and the Great Lakes\r\nfurnished new standards of industrial measurement. From this society,\r\nseated amidst a wealth of material advantages, and breeding\r\nindividualism, energetic competition, inventiveness, and spaciousness of\r\ndesign, came the triumph of the strongest. The captains of industry\r\narose and seized on nature's gifts. Struggling with one another,\r\nincreasing the scope of their ambitions as the largeness of the\r\nresources and the extent of the fields of activity revealed themselves,\r\nthey were forced to accept the natural conditions of a province vast in\r\narea but simple in structure. Competition grew into consolidation. On\r\nthe Pittsburgh border of the Middle West the completion of the process\r\nis most clearly seen. On the prairies of Kansas stands the Populist, a\r\nsurvival of the pioneer, striving to adjust present conditions to his\r\nold ideals.\r\n\r\nThe ideals of equality, freedom of opportunity, faith in the common man\r\nare deep rooted in all the Middle West. The frontier stage, through\r\nwhich each portion passed, left abiding traces on the older, as well as\r\non the newer, areas of the province. Nor were these ideals limited to\r\nthe native American settlers: Germans and Scandinavians who poured into\r\nthe Middle West sought the country with like hopes and like faith. These\r\nfacts must be remembered in estimating the effects of the economic\r\ntransformation of the province upon its democracy. The peculiar\r\ndemocracy of the frontier has passed away with the conditions that\r\nproduced it; but the democratic aspirations remain. They are held with\r\npassionate determination.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Middle West is that of adapting democracy to the vast\r\neconomic organization of the present. This region which has so often\r\nneeded the reminder that bigness is not greatness, may yet show that its\r\ntraining has produced the power to reconcile popular government and\r\nculture with the huge industrial society of the modern world. The\r\ndemocracies of the past have been small communities, under simple and\r\nprimitive economic conditions. At bottom the problem is how to reconcile\r\nreal greatness with bigness.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the Middle West should accomplish this; the future\r\nof the Republic is with her. Politically she is dominant, as is\r\nillustrated by the fact that six out of seven of the Presidents elected\r\nsince 1860 have come from her borders. Twenty-six million people live in\r\nthe Middle West as against twenty-one million in New England and the\r\nMiddle States together, and the Middle West has indefinite capacity for\r\ngrowth. The educational forces are more democratic than in the East,\r\nand the Middle West has twice as many students (if we count together the\r\ncommon school, secondary, and collegiate attendance), as have New\r\nEngland and the Middle States combined. Nor is this educational system,\r\nas a whole, inferior to that of the Eastern States. State universities\r\ncrown the public school system in every one of these States of the\r\nMiddle West, and rank with the universities of the seaboard, while\r\nprivate munificence has furnished others on an unexampled scale. The\r\npublic and private art collections of Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Paul, and\r\nother cities rival those of the seaboard. \"World's fairs,\" with their\r\nimportant popular educational influences, have been held at Chicago,\r\nOmaha, and Buffalo; and the next of these national gatherings is to be\r\nat St. Louis. There is throughout the Middle West a vigor and a mental\r\nactivity among the common people that bode well for its future. If the\r\ntask of reducing the Province of the Lake and Prairie Plains to the uses\r\nof civilization should for a time overweigh art and literature, and even\r\nhigh political and social ideals, it would not be surprising. But if the\r\nideals of the pioneers shall survive the inundation of material success,\r\nwe may expect to see in the Middle West the rise of a highly intelligent\r\nsociety where culture shall be reconciled with democracy in the large.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126:1] With acknowledgments to the _International Monthly_, December,\r\n1901.\r\n\r\n[129:1] 1901.\r\n\r\n[132:1] See F. J. Turner, \"Western State-Making in the Revolutionary\r\nEra,\" in _Am. Historical Review_, i, pp. 70 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE OHIO VALLEY IN AMERICAN HISTORY[157:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a notable essay Professor Josiah Royce has asserted the salutary\r\ninfluence of a highly organized provincial life in order to counteract\r\ncertain evils arising from the tremendous development of nationalism in\r\nour own day. Among these evils he enumerates: first, the frequent\r\nchanges of dwelling place, whereby the community is in danger of losing\r\nthe well-knit organization of a common life; second, the tendency to\r\nreduce variety in national civilization, to assimilate all to a common\r\ntype and thus to discourage individuality, and produce a \"remorseless\r\nmechanism--vast, irrational;\" third, the evils arising from the fact\r\nthat waves of emotion, the passion of the mob, tend in our day to sweep\r\nacross the nation.\r\n\r\nAgainst these surges of national feeling Professor Royce would erect\r\ndikes in the form of provincialism, the resistance of separate sections\r\neach with its own traditions, beliefs and aspirations. \"Our national\r\nunities have grown so vast, our forces of social consolidation so\r\nparamount, the resulting problems, conflicts, evils, have become so\r\nintensified,\" he says, that we must seek in the province renewed\r\nstrength, usefulness and beauty of American life.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of this philosopher's appeal for a revival of\r\nsectionalism, on a higher level, in order to check the tendencies to a\r\ndeadening uniformity of national consolidation (and to me this appeal,\r\nunder the limitations which he gives it, seems warranted by the\r\nconditions)--it is certainly true that in the history of the United\r\nStates sectionalism holds a place too little recognized by the\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nBy sectionalism I do not mean the struggle between North and South which\r\nculminated in the Civil War. That extreme and tragic form of\r\nsectionalism indeed has almost engrossed the attention of historians,\r\nand it is, no doubt, the most striking and painful example of the\r\nphenomenon in our history. But there are older, and perhaps in the long\r\nrun more enduring examples of the play of sectional forces than the\r\nslavery struggle, and there are various sections besides North and\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the United States is, in size and natural resources, an empire,\r\na collection of potential nations, rather than a single nation. It is\r\ncomparable in area to Europe. If the coast of California be placed along\r\nthe coast of Spain, Charleston, South Carolina, would fall near\r\nConstantinople; the northern shores of Lake Superior would touch the\r\nBaltic, and New Orleans would lie in southern Italy. Within this vast\r\nempire there are geographic provinces, separate in physical conditions,\r\ninto which American colonization has flowed, and in each of which a\r\nspecial society has developed, with an economic, political and social\r\nlife of its own. Each of these provinces, or sections, has developed its\r\nown leaders, who in the public life of the nation have voiced the needs\r\nof their section, contended with the representatives of other sections,\r\nand arranged compromises between sections in national legislation and\r\npolicy, almost as ambassadors from separate countries in a European\r\ncongress might make treaties.\r\n\r\nBetween these sections commercial relations have sprung up, and economic\r\ncombinations and contests may be traced by the student who looks beneath\r\nthe surface of our national life to the actual grouping of States in\r\ncongressional votes on tariff, internal improvement, currency and\r\nbanking, and all the varied legislation in the field of commerce.\r\nAmerican industrial life is the outcome of the combinations and contests\r\nof groups of States in sections. And the intellectual, the spiritual\r\nlife of the nation is the result of the interplay of the sectional\r\nideals, fundamental assumptions and emotions.\r\n\r\nIn short, the real federal aspect of the nation, if we penetrate beneath\r\nconstitutional forms to the deeper currents of social, economic and\r\npolitical life, will be found to lie in the relation of sections and\r\nnation, rather than in the relation of States and nation. Recently\r\nex-secretary Root emphasized the danger that the States, by neglecting\r\nto fulfil their duties, might fall into decay, while the national\r\ngovernment engrossed their former power. But even if the States\r\ndisappeared altogether as effective factors in our national life, the\r\nsections might, in my opinion, gain from that very disappearance a\r\nstrength and activity that would prove effective limitations upon the\r\nnationalizing process.\r\n\r\nWithout pursuing the interesting speculation, I may note as evidence of\r\nthe development of sectionalism, the various gatherings of business men,\r\nreligious denominations and educational organizations in groups of\r\nStates. Among the signs of growth of a healthy provincialism is the\r\nformation of sectional historical societies. While the American\r\nHistorical Association has been growing vigorously and becoming a\r\ngenuine gathering of historical students from all parts of the nation,\r\nthere have also arisen societies in various sections to deal with the\r\nparticular history of the groups of States. In part this is due to the\r\ngreat distances which render attendance difficult upon the meetings of\r\nthe national body to-day, but we would be short-sighted, indeed, who\r\nfailed to perceive in the formation of the Pacific Coast Historical\r\nAssociation, the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, and the\r\nOhio Valley Historical Association, for example, genuine and spontaneous\r\nmanifestations of a sectional consciousness.\r\n\r\nThese associations spring in large part from the recognition in each of\r\na common past, a common body of experiences, traditions, institutions\r\nand ideals. It is not necessary now to raise the question whether all of\r\nthese associations are based on a real community of historical interest,\r\nwhether there are overlapping areas, whether new combinations may not be\r\nmade? They are at least substantial attempts to find a common sectional\r\nunity, and out of their interest in the past of the section, increasing\r\ntendencies to common sectional ideas and policies are certain to follow.\r\nI do not mean to prophesy any disruptive tendency in American life by\r\nthe rejuvenation of sectional self-consciousness; but I do mean to\r\nassert that American life will be enriched and safe-guarded by the\r\ndevelopment of the greater variety of interest, purposes and ideals\r\nwhich seem to be arising. A measure of local concentration seems\r\nnecessary to produce healthy, intellectual and moral life. The spread of\r\nsocial forces over too vast an area makes for monotony and stagnation.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, raise the question of how far the Ohio Valley has had a\r\npart of its own in the making of the nation. I have not the temerity to\r\nattempt a history of the Valley in the brief compass of this address.\r\nNor am I confident of my ability even to pick out the more important\r\nfeatures of its history in our common national life. But I venture to\r\nput the problem, to state some familiar facts from the special point of\r\nview, with the hope of arousing interest in the theme among the many\r\nstudents who are advancing the science of history in this section.\r\n\r\nTo the physiographer the section is made up of the province of the\r\nAlleghany Plateaus and the southern portion of the Prairie Plains. In\r\nit are found rich mineral deposits which are changing the life of the\r\nsection and of the nation. Although you reckon in your membership only\r\nthe states that touch the Ohio River, parts of those states are, from\r\nthe point of view of their social origins, more closely connected with\r\nthe Northwest on the Lake Plains, than with the Ohio Valley; and, on the\r\nother hand, the Tennessee Valley, though it sweeps far toward the Lower\r\nSouth, and only joins the Ohio at the end of its course, has been\r\nthrough much of the history of the region an essential part of this\r\nsociety. Together these rivers made up the \"Western World\" of the\r\npioneers of the Revolutionary era; the \"Western Waters\" of the\r\nbackwoodsmen.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the unity of the section and its place in history were\r\ndetermined by the \"beautiful river,\" as the French explorers called\r\nit--the Ohio, which pours its flood for over a thousand miles, a great\r\nhighway to the West; a historic artery of commerce, a wedge of advance\r\nbetween powerful Indian confederacies, and rival European nations, to\r\nthe Mississippi Valley; a home for six mighty States, now in the heart\r\nof the nation, rich in material wealth, richer in the history of\r\nAmerican democracy, a society that holds a place midway between the\r\nindustrial sections of the seaboard and the plains and prairies of the\r\nagricultural West; between the society that formed later along the\r\nlevels about the Great Lakes, and the society that arose in the Lower\r\nSouth on the plains of the Gulf of Mexico. The Alleghanies bound it on\r\nthe east, the Mississippi on the west. At the forks of the great river\r\nlies Pittsburgh, the historic gateway to the West, the present symbol\r\nand embodiment of the age of steel, the type of modern industrialism.\r\nNear its western border is St. Louis, looking toward the Prairies, the\r\nGreat Plains and the Rocky Mountains, the land into which the tide of\r\nmodern colonization turns.\r\n\r\nBetween these old cities, for whose sites European nations contended,\r\nstand the cities whose growth preëminently represents the Ohio valley;\r\nCincinnati, the historic queen of the river; Louisville, the warder of\r\nthe falls; the cities of the \"Old National Road,\" Columbus,\r\nIndianapolis; the cities of the Blue Grass lands, which made Kentucky\r\nthe goal of the pioneers; and the cities of that young commonwealth,\r\nwhom the Ohio river by force of its attraction tore away from an\r\nuncongenial control by the Old Dominion, and joined to the social\r\nsection where it belonged.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Valley is, therefore, not only a commercial highway, it is a\r\nmiddle kingdom between the East and the West, between the northern area,\r\nwhich was occupied by a greater New England and emigrants from northern\r\nEurope, and the southern area of the \"Cotton Kingdom.\" As Pennsylvania\r\nand New York constituted the Middle Region in our earlier history,\r\nbetween New England and the seaboard South, so the Ohio Valley became\r\nthe Middle Region of a later time. In its position as a highway and a\r\nMiddle Region are found the keys to its place in American history.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the Ohio Valley seems to have been a highway for\r\nmigration, and the home of a culture of its own. The sciences of\r\nAmerican archeology and ethnology are too new to enable us to speak with\r\nconfidence upon the origins and earlier distribution of the aborigines,\r\nbut it is at least clear that the Ohio river played an important part in\r\nthe movements of the earlier men in America, and that the mounds of the\r\nvalley indicate a special type of development intermediate between that\r\nof the northern hunter folk, and the pueblo building races of the south.\r\nThis dim and yet fascinating introduction to the history of the Ohio\r\nwill afford ample opportunity for later students of the relations\r\nbetween geography and population to make contributions to our history.\r\n\r\nThe French explorers saw the river, but failed to grasp its significance\r\nas a strategic line in the conquest of the West. Entangled in the water\r\nlabyrinth of the vast interior, and kindled with aspirations to reach\r\nthe \"Sea of the West,\" their fur traders and explorers pushed their way\r\nthrough the forests of the North and across the plains of the South,\r\nfrom river to lake, from lake to river, until they met the mountains of\r\nthe West. But while they were reaching the upper course of the Missouri\r\nand the Spanish outposts of Santa Fé, they missed the opportunity to\r\nhold the Ohio Valley, and before France could settle the Valley, the\r\nlong and attenuated line of French posts in the west, reaching from\r\nCanada to Louisiana, was struck by the advancing column of the American\r\nbackwoodsmen in the center by the way of the Ohio. Parkman, in whose\r\ngolden pages is written the epic of the American wilderness, found his\r\nhero in the wandering Frenchman. Perhaps because he was a New Englander\r\nhe missed a great opportunity and neglected to portray the formation and\r\nadvance of the backwood society which was finally to erase the traces of\r\nFrench control in the interior of North America.\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance in a consideration of the national\r\naspects of the history of the Ohio Valley, that the messenger of English\r\ncivilization, who summoned the French to evacuate the Valley and its\r\napproaches, and whose men near the forks of the Ohio fired the opening\r\ngun of the world-historic conflict that wrought the doom of New France\r\nin America, was George Washington, the first American to win a national\r\nposition in the United States. The father of his country was the prophet\r\nof the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nInto this dominion, in the next scene of this drama, came the\r\nbackwoodsmen, the men who began the formation of the society of the\r\nValley. I wish to consider the effects of the formation of this society\r\nupon the nation. And first let us consider the stock itself.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Valley was settled, for the most part (though with important\r\nexceptions, especially in Ohio), by men of the Upland South, and this\r\ndetermined a large part of its influence in the nation through a long\r\nperiod. As the Ohio Valley, as a whole, was an extension of the Upland\r\nSouth, so the Upland South was, broadly speaking, an extension from the\r\nold Middle Region, chiefly from Pennsylvania. The society of pioneers,\r\nEnglish, Scotch-Irish, Germans, and other nationalities which formed in\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century in the Great Valley of\r\nPennsylvania and its lateral extensions was the nursery of the American\r\nbackwoodsmen. Between about 1730 and the Revolution, successive tides of\r\npioneers ascended the Shenandoah, occupied the Piedmont, or up-country\r\nof Virginia and the Carolinas, and received recruits from similar\r\npeoples who came by eastward advances from the coast toward this Old\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThus by the middle of the eighteenth century a new section had been\r\ncreated in America, a kind of peninsula thrust down from Pennsylvania\r\nbetween the falls of the rivers of the South Atlantic colonies on the\r\none side and the Alleghany mountains on the other. Its population showed\r\na mixture of nationalities and religions. Less English than the colonial\r\ncoast, it was built on a basis of religious feeling different from that\r\nof Puritan New England, and still different from the conservative\r\nAnglicans of the southern seaboard. The Scotch-Irish Presbyterians with\r\nthe glow of the covenanters; German sectaries with serious-minded\r\ndevotion to one or another of a multiplicity of sects, but withal deeply\r\nresponsive to the call of the religious spirit, and the English Quakers\r\nall furnish a foundation of emotional responsiveness to religion and a\r\nreadiness to find a new heaven and a new earth in politics as well as in\r\nreligion. In spite of the influence of the backwoods in hampering\r\nreligious organization, this upland society was a fertile field for\r\ntillage by such democratic and emotional sects as the Baptists,\r\nMethodists and the later Campbellites, as well as by Presbyterians. Mr.\r\nBryce has well characterized the South as a region of \"high religious\r\nvoltage,\" but this characterization is especially applicable to the\r\nUpland South, and its colonies in the Ohio Valley. It is not necessary\r\nto assert that this religious spirit resulted in the kind of conduct\r\nassociated with the religious life of the Puritans. What I wish to point\r\nout is the responsiveness of the Upland South to emotional religious and\r\npolitical appeal.\r\n\r\nBesides its variety of stocks and its religious sects responsive to\r\nemotion, the Upland South was intensely democratic and individualistic.\r\nIt believed that government was based on a limited contract for the\r\nbenefit of the individual, and it acted independently of governmental\r\norgans and restraints with such ease that in many regions this was the\r\nhabitual mode of social procedure: voluntary coöperation was more\r\nnatural to the Southern Uplanders than action through the machinery of\r\ngovernment, especially when government checked rather than aided their\r\nindustrial and social tendencies and desires. It was a naturally radical\r\nsociety. It was moreover a rural section not of the planter or merchant\r\ntype, but characterized by the small farmer, building his log cabin in\r\nthe wilderness, raising a small crop and a few animals for family use.\r\nIt was this stock which began to pass into the Ohio Valley when Daniel\r\nBoone, and the pioneers associated with his name, followed the\r\n\"Wilderness Trace\" from the Upland South to the Blue Grass lands in the\r\nmidst of the Kentucky hills, on the Ohio river. In the opening years of\r\nthe Revolution these pioneers were recruited by westward extensions\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and West Virginia. With this colonization of the Ohio\r\nValley begins a chapter in American history.\r\n\r\nThis settlement contributed a new element to our national development\r\nand raised new national problems. It took a long time for the seaboard\r\nSouth to assimilate the upland section. We cannot think of the South as\r\na unit through much of its ante-bellum history without doing violence to\r\nthe facts. The struggle between the men of the up-country and the men of\r\nthe tide-water, made a large part of the domestic history of the \"Old\r\nSouth.\" Nevertheless, the Upland South, as slavery and cotton\r\ncultivation extended westward from the coast, gradually merged in the\r\nEast. On the other hand, its children, who placed the wall of the\r\nAlleghanies between them and the East, gave thereby a new life to the\r\nconditions and ideals which were lost in their former home. Nor was this\r\nall. Beyond the mountains new conditions, new problems, aroused new\r\nambitions and new social ideals. Its entrance into the \"Western World\"\r\nwas a tonic to this stock. Its crossing put new fire into its\r\nveins--fires of militant expansion, creative social energy, triumphant\r\ndemocracy. A new section was added to the American nation, a new element\r\nwas infused into the combination which we call the United States, a new\r\nflavor was given to the American spirit.\r\n\r\nWe may next rapidly note some of the results. First, let us consider the\r\nnational effects of the settlement of this new social type in the Ohio\r\nValley upon the expansion and diplomacy of the nation. Almost from the\r\nfirst the Ohio valley had constituted the problem of westward expansion.\r\nIt was the entering wedge to the possession of the Mississippi Valley,\r\nand, although reluctantly, the Eastern colonies and then the Eastern\r\nStates were compelled to join in the struggle first to possess the Ohio,\r\nthen to retain it, and finally to enforce its demand for the possession\r\nof the whole Mississippi Valley and the basin of the Great Lakes as a\r\nmeans of outlet for its crops and of defense for its settlements. The\r\npart played by the pioneers of the Ohio Valley as a flying column of the\r\nnation, sent across the mountains and making a line of advance between\r\nhostile Indians and English on the north, and hostile Indians and\r\nSpaniards on the south, is itself too extensive a theme to be more than\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHere in historic Kentucky, in the State which was the home of George\r\nRogers Clark it is not necessary to dwell upon his clear insight and\r\ncourage in carrying American arms into the Northwest. From the first,\r\nWashington also grasped the significance of the Ohio Valley as a \"rising\r\nempire,\" whose population and trade were essential to the nation, but\r\nwhich found its natural outlet down the Mississippi, where Spain blocked\r\nthe river, and which was in danger of withdrawing from the weak\r\nconfederacy. The intrigues of England to attract the Valley to herself\r\nand those of Spain to add the settlements to the Spanish Empire, the use\r\nof the Indians by these rivals, and the efforts of France to use the\r\npioneers of Kentucky to win New Orleans and the whole Valley between the\r\nAlleghanies and the Rocky Mountains for a revived French Empire in\r\nAmerica, are among the fascinating chapters of American, as well as of\r\nOhio Valley, history. This position of the Valley explains much of the\r\nIndian wars, the foreign relations, and, indirectly, the domestic\r\npolitics of the period from the Revolution to the purchase of Louisiana.\r\nIndeed, the purchase was in large measure due to the pressure of the\r\nsettlers of the Ohio Valley to secure this necessary outlet. It was the\r\nOhio Valley which forced the nation away from a narrow colonial attitude\r\ninto its career as a nation among other nations with an adequate\r\nphysical basis for future growth.\r\n\r\nIn this development of a foreign policy in connection with the Ohio\r\nValley, we find the germ of the Monroe doctrine, and the beginnings of\r\nthe definite independence of the United States from the state system of\r\nthe Old World, the beginning, in fact, of its career as a world power.\r\nThis expansive impulse went on into the War of 1812, a war which was in\r\nno inconsiderable degree, the result of the aggressive leadership of a\r\ngroup of men from Kentucky and Tennessee, and especially of the daring\r\nand lofty demands of Henry Clay, who even thus early voiced the spirit\r\nof the Ohio Valley. That in this war William Henry Harrison and the\r\nKentucky troops achieved the real conquest of the northwest province and\r\nAndrew Jackson with his Tennesseeans achieved the real conquest of the\r\nGulf Plains, is in itself abundant evidence of the part played in the\r\nexpansion of the nation by the section which formed on the Ohio and its\r\ntributaries. Nor was this the end of the process, for the annexation of\r\nTexas and the Pacific Coast was in a very real sense only an aftermath\r\nof the same movement of expansion.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ohio Valley was leading the way to the building of a greater\r\nnation, it was also the field wherein was formed an important\r\ncontribution of the United States to political institutions. By this I\r\nmean what George Bancroft has well called \"federal colonial system,\"\r\nthat is, our system of territories and new States. It is a mistake to\r\nattribute this system to the Ordinance of 1787 and to the leadership of\r\nNew England. It was in large measure the work of the communities of the\r\nOhio Valley who wrought out the essentials of the system for themselves,\r\nand by their attitude imposed it, of necessity, upon the nation. The\r\ngreat Ordinance only perfected the system.[168:1]\r\n\r\nUnder the belief that all men going into vacant lands have the right to\r\nshape their own political institutions, the riflemen of western\r\nVirginia, western Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Tennessee, during the\r\nRevolution, protested against the rule of governments east of the\r\nmountains, and asserted with manly independence their right to\r\nself-government. But it is significant that in making this assertion,\r\nthey at the same time petitioned congress to admit them to the\r\nsisterhood of States. Even when leaders like Wilkinson were attempting\r\nto induce Kentucky to act as an independent nation, the national spirit\r\nof the people as a whole led them to delay until at last they found\r\nthemselves a State of the new Union. This recognition of the paramount\r\nauthority of congress and this demand for self-government under that\r\nauthority, constitute the foundations of the federal territorial system,\r\nas expressed in congressional resolutions, worked out tentatively in\r\nJefferson's Ordinance of 1784, and finally shaped in the Ordinance of\r\n1787.\r\n\r\nThus the Ohio Valley was not only the area to which this system was\r\napplied, but it was itself instrumental in shaping the system by its own\r\ndemands and by the danger that too rigorous an assertion of either State\r\nor national power over these remote communities might result in their\r\nloss to the nation. The importance of the result can hardly be\r\noverestimated. It insured the peaceful and free development of the great\r\nWest and gave it political organization not as the outcome of wars of\r\nhostile States, nor by arbitrary government by distant powers, but by\r\nterritorial government combined with large local autonomy. These\r\ngovernments in turn were admitted as equal States of the Union. By this\r\npeaceful process of colonization a whole continent has been filled with\r\nfree and orderly commonwealths so quietly, so naturally, that we can\r\nonly appreciate the profound significance of the process by contrasting\r\nit with the spread of European nations through conquest and oppression.\r\n\r\nNext let me invite your attention to the part played by the Ohio Valley\r\nin the economic legislation which shaped our history in the years of the\r\nmaking of the nation between the War of 1812 and the rise of the slavery\r\nstruggle. It needs but slight reflection to discover that in the area in\r\nquestion, the men and measures of the Ohio Valley held the balance of\r\npower and set the course of our national progress. The problems before\r\nthe country at that time were problems of internal development: the mode\r\nof dealing with the public domain; the building of roads and digging of\r\ncanals for the internal improvement of a nation which was separated into\r\nEast and West by the Alleghany Mountains; the formation of a tariff\r\nsystem for the protection of home industries and to supply a market for\r\nthe surplus of the West which no longer found an outlet in warring\r\nEurope; the framing of a banking and currency system which should meet\r\nthe needs of the new interstate commerce produced by the rise of the\r\nwestern surplus.\r\n\r\nIn the Ohio Valley, by the initiative of Ohio Valley men, and often\r\nagainst the protest of Eastern sections, the public land policy was\r\ndeveloped by laws which subordinated the revenue idea to the idea of the\r\nupbuilding of a democracy of small landholders. The squatters of the\r\nOhio Valley forced the passage of preëmption laws and these laws in\r\ntheir turn led to the homestead agitation. There has been no single\r\nelement more influential in shaping American democracy and its ideals\r\nthan this land policy. And whether the system be regarded as harmful or\r\nhelpful, there can be, I think, no doubt that it was the outcome of\r\nconditions imposed by the settlers of the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nWhen one names the tariff, internal improvements and the bank, he is\r\nbound to add the title \"The American System,\" and to think of Henry Clay\r\nof Kentucky, the captivating young statesman, who fashioned a national\r\npolicy, raised issues and disciplined a party to support them and who\r\nfinally imposed the system upon the nation. But, however clearly we\r\nrecognize the genius and originality of Henry Clay as a political\r\nleader; however we recognize that he has a national standing as a\r\nconstructive statesman, we must perceive, if we probe the matter deeply\r\nenough, that his policy and his power grew out of the economic and\r\nsocial conditions of the people whose needs he voiced--the people of the\r\nOhio Valley. It was the fact that in this period they had begun to\r\ncreate an agricultural surplus, which made the necessity for this\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe nation has recently celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of\r\nFulton's invention of the steamboat, and the Hudson river has been\r\nablaze in his honor; but in truth it is on the Ohio and the Mississippi\r\nthat the fires of celebration should really burn in honor of Fulton, for\r\nthe historic significance to the United States of the invention of the\r\nsteamboat does not lie in its use on Eastern rivers; not even in its use\r\non the ocean; for our own internal commerce carried in our own ships has\r\nhad a vaster influence upon our national life than has our foreign\r\ncommerce. And this internal commerce was at first, and for many years,\r\nthe commerce of the Ohio Valley carried by way of the Mississippi. When\r\nFulton's steamboat was applied in 1811 to the Western Waters, it became\r\npossible to develop agriculture and to get the Western crops rapidly and\r\ncheaply to a market. The result was a tremendous growth in the entire\r\nOhio Valley, but this invention did not solve the problem of cheap\r\nsupplies of Eastern manufactures, nor satisfy the desire of the West to\r\nbuild up its own factories in order to consume its own products. The\r\nOhio Valley had seen the advantage of home markets, as her towns grew\r\nup with their commerce and manufacturers close to the rural regions.\r\nLands had increased in value in proportion to their nearness to these\r\ncities, and crops were in higher demand near them. Thus Henry Clay found\r\na whole section standing behind him when he demanded a protective tariff\r\nto create home markets on a national scale, and when he urged the\r\nbreaking of the Alleghany barrier by a national system of roads and\r\ncanals. If we analyse the congressional votes by which the tariff and\r\ninternal improvement acts were passed, we shall find that there was an\r\nalmost unbroken South against them, a Middle Region largely for them, a\r\nNew England divided, and the Ohio Valley almost a unit, holding the\r\nbalance of power and casting it in favor of the American system.\r\n\r\nThe next topic to which I ask your attention is the influence of the\r\nOhio Valley in the promotion of democracy. On this I shall, by reason of\r\nlack of time, be obliged merely to point out that the powerful group of\r\nOhio Valley States, which sprang out of the democracy of the backwoods,\r\nand which entered the Union one after the other with manhood suffrage,\r\ngreatly recruited the effective forces of democracy in the Union. Not\r\nonly did they add new recruits, but by their competitive pressure for\r\npopulation they forced the older States to break down their historic\r\nrestraints upon the right of voting, unless they were to lose their\r\npeople to the freer life of the West.\r\n\r\nBut in the era of Jacksonian democracy, Henry Clay and his followers\r\nengaged the great Tennesseean in a fierce political struggle out of\r\nwhich was born the rival Whig and Democratic parties. This struggle was\r\nin fact reflective of the conditions which had arisen in the Ohio\r\nValley. As the section had grown in population and wealth, as the trails\r\nchanged into roads, the cabins into well-built houses, the clearings\r\ninto broad farms, the hamlets into towns; as barter became commerce and\r\nall the modern processes of industrial development began to operate in\r\nthis rising region, the Ohio Valley broke apart into the rival interests\r\nof the industrial forces (the town-makers and the business builders), on\r\nthe one side and the old rural democracy of the uplands on the other.\r\nThis division was symbolical of national processes. In the contest\r\nbetween these forces, Andrew Jackson was the champion of the cause of\r\nthe upland democracy. He denounced the money power, banks and the whole\r\ncredit system and sounded a fierce tocsin of danger against the\r\nincreasing influence of wealth in politics. Henry Clay, on the other\r\nhand, represented the new industrial forces along the Ohio. It is\r\ncertainly significant that in the rivalry between the great Whig of the\r\nOhio Valley and the great Democrat of its Tennessee tributary lay the\r\nissues of American politics almost until the slavery struggle. The\r\nresponsiveness of the Ohio Valley to leadership and its enthusiasm in\r\naction are illustrated by the Harrison campaign of 1840; in that \"log\r\ncabin campaign\" when the Whigs \"stole the thunder\" of pioneer Jacksonian\r\ndemocracy for another backwoods hero, the Ohio Valley carried its spirit\r\nas well as its political favorite throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on each side of the Ohio Valley, other sections were forming.\r\nNew England and the children of New England in western New York and an\r\nincreasing flood of German immigrants were pouring into the Great Lake\r\nbasin and the prairies, north of the upland peoples who had chopped out\r\nhomes in the forests along the Ohio. This section was tied to the East\r\nby the Great Lake navigation and the Erie canal, it became in fact an\r\nextension of New England and New York. Here the Free Soil party found\r\nits strength and New York newspapers expressed the political ideas.\r\nAlthough this section tried to attach the Ohio River interests to itself\r\nby canals and later by railroads, it was in reality for a long time\r\nseparate in its ideals and its interests and never succeeded in\r\ndominating the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nOn the south along the Gulf Plains there developed the \"Cotton Kingdom,\"\r\na Greater South with a radical program of slavery expansion mapped out\r\nby bold and aggressive leaders. Already this Southern section had\r\nattempted to establish increasing commercial relations with the Ohio\r\nValley. The staple-producing region was a principal consumer of its live\r\nstock and food products. South Carolina leaders like Calhoun tried to\r\nbind the Ohio to the chariot of the South by the Cincinnati and\r\nCharleston Railroad, designed to make an outlet for the Ohio Valley\r\nproducts to the southeast. Georgia in her turn was a rival of South\r\nCarolina in plans to drain this commerce itself. In all of these plans\r\nto connect the Ohio Valley commercially with the South, the political\r\nobject was quite as prominent as the commercial.\r\n\r\nIn short, various areas were bidding for the support of the zone of\r\npopulation along the Ohio River. The Ohio Valley recognized its old\r\nrelationship to the South, but its people were by no means champions of\r\nslavery. In the southern portion of the States north of the Ohio where\r\nindented servitude for many years opened a way to a system of\r\nsemi-slavery, there were divided counsels. Kentucky also spoke with no\r\ncertain voice. As a result, it is in these regions that we find the\r\nstronghold of the compromising movement in the slavery struggle.\r\nKentucky furnished Abraham Lincoln to Illinois, and Jefferson Davis to\r\nMississippi, and was in reality the very center of the region of\r\nadjustment between these rival interests. Senator Thomas, of southern\r\nIllinois, moved the Missouri Compromise, and Henry Clay was the most\r\neffective champion of that compromise, as he was the architect of the\r\nCompromise of 1850. The Crittenden compromise proposals on the eve of\r\nthe Civil War came also from Kentucky and represent the persistence of\r\nthe spirit of Henry Clay.\r\n\r\nIn a word, as I pointed out in the beginning, the Ohio Valley was a\r\nMiddle Region with a strong national allegiance, striving to hold apart\r\nwith either hand the sectional combatants in this struggle. In the\r\ncautious development of his policy of emancipation, we may see the\r\nprofound influence of the Ohio Valley upon Abraham Lincoln--Kentucky's\r\ngreatest son. No one can understand his presidency without proper\r\nappreciation of the deep influence of the Ohio Valley, its ideals and\r\nits prejudices upon America's original contribution to the great men of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to make it clear, I trust, that the Ohio Valley has\r\nnot only a local history worthy of study, a rich heritage to its people,\r\nbut also that it has been an independent and powerful force in shaping\r\nthe development of a nation. Of the late history of this Valley, the\r\nrise of its vast industrial power, its far-reaching commercial\r\ninfluence, it is not necessary that I should speak. You know its\r\nstatesmen and their influence upon our own time; you know the relation\r\nof Ohio to the office of President of the United States! Nor is it\r\nnecessary that I should attempt to prophesy concerning the future which\r\nthe Ohio Valley will hold in the nation.\r\n\r\nIn that new age of inland water transportation, which is certain to\r\nsupplement the age of the railroad, there can be no more important\r\nregion than the Ohio Valley. Let us hope that its old love of democracy\r\nmay endure, and that in this section, where the first trans-Alleghany\r\npioneers struck blows at the forests, there may be brought to blossom\r\nand to fruit the ripe civilization of a people who know that whatever\r\nthe glories of prosperity may be, there are greater glories of the\r\nspirit of man; who know that in the ultimate record of history, the\r\nplace of the Ohio Valley will depend upon the contribution which her\r\npeople and her leaders make to the cause of an enlightened, a\r\ncultivated, a God-fearing and a free, as well as a comfortable,\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157:1] An address before the Ohio Valley Historical Association,\r\nOctober 16, 1909.\r\n\r\n[168:1] See F. J. Turner, \"New States West of the Alleghanies,\"\r\n_American Historical Review_, i, pp. 70 ff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN AMERICAN HISTORY[177:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of a company of sympathetic and critical students of history in\r\nthe South and in the West is bound to revolutionize the perspective of\r\nAmerican history. Already our Eastern colleagues are aware in general,\r\nif not in detail, of the importance of the work of this nation in\r\ndealing with the vast interior, and with the influence of the West upon\r\nthe nation. Indeed, I might take as the text for this address the words\r\nof one of our Eastern historians, Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, who, a\r\ndecade ago, wrote:\r\n\r\n     The Mississippi Valley yields to no region in the world in\r\n     interest, in romance, and in promise for the future. Here, if\r\n     anywhere, is the real America--the field, the theater, and the\r\n     basis of the civilization of the Western World. The history of\r\n     the Mississippi Valley is the history of the United States;\r\n     its future is the future of one of the most powerful of modern\r\n     nations.[177:2]\r\n\r\nIf those of us who have been insisting on the importance of our own\r\nregion are led at times by the enthusiasm of the pioneer for the\r\ninviting historical domain that opens before us to overstate the\r\nimportance of our subject, we may at least plead that we have gone no\r\nfarther than some of our brethren of the East; and we may take comfort\r\nin this declaration of Theodore Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n     The states that have grown up around the Great Lakes and in\r\n     the Valley of the Upper Mississippi, [are] the states which\r\n     are destined to be the greatest, the richest, the most\r\n     prosperous of all the great, rich, and prosperous\r\n     commonwealths which go to make up the mightiest republic the\r\n     world has ever seen. These states . . . form the heart of the\r\n     country geographically, and they will soon become the heart in\r\n     population and in political and social importance. . . . I\r\n     should be sorry to think that before these states there loomed\r\n     a future of material prosperity merely. I regard this section\r\n     of the country as the heart of true American sentiment.[178:1]\r\n\r\nIn studying the history of the whole Mississippi Valley, therefore, the\r\nmembers of this Association are studying the origins of that portion of\r\nthe nation which is admitted by competent Eastern authorities to be the\r\nsection potentially most influential in the future of America. They are\r\nalso studying the region which has engaged the most vital activities of\r\nthe whole nation; for the problems arising from the existence of the\r\nMississippi Valley, whether of movement of population, diplomacy,\r\npolitics, economic development, or social structure, have been\r\nfundamental problems in shaping the nation. It is not a narrow, not even\r\na local, interest which determines the mission of this Association. It\r\nis nothing less than the study of the American people in the presence\r\nand under the influence of the vast spaces, the imperial resources of\r\nthe great interior. The social destiny of this Valley will be the social\r\ndestiny, and will mark the place in history, of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn a large sense, and in the one usually given to it by geographers and\r\nhistorians, the Mississippi Valley includes the whole interior basin, a\r\nprovince which drains into nearly two thousand miles of navigable waters\r\nof the Mississippi itself, two thousand miles of the tawny flood of the\r\nMissouri, and a thousand miles of the Ohio--five thousand miles of main\r\nwater highways open to the steamboat, nearly two and a half million\r\nsquare miles of drainage basin, a land greater than all Europe except\r\nRussia, Norway, and Sweden, a land of levels, marked by essential\r\ngeographic unity, a land estimated to be able to support a population of\r\ntwo or three hundred millions, three times the present population of the\r\nwhole nation, an empire of natural resources in which to build a noble\r\nsocial structure worthy to hold its place as the heart of American\r\nindustrial, political and spiritual life.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the Mississippi Valley in American history was first\r\nshown in the fact that it opened to various nations visions of power in\r\nthe New World--visions that sweep across the horizon of historical\r\npossibility like the luminous but unsubstantial aurora of a comet's\r\ntrain, portentous and fleeting.\r\n\r\nOut of the darkness of the primitive history of the continent are being\r\ndrawn the evidences of the rise and fall of Indian cultures, the\r\nmigrations through and into the great Valley by men of the Stone Age,\r\nhinted at in legends and languages, dimly told in the records of mounds\r\nand artifacts, but waiting still for complete interpretation.\r\n\r\nInto these spaces and among the savage peoples, came France and wrote a\r\nromantic page in our early history, a page that tells of unfulfilled\r\nempire. What is striking in the effect of the Mississippi Valley upon\r\nFrance is the pronounced influence of the unity of its great spaces. It\r\nis not without meaning that Radisson and Groseilliers not only reached\r\nthe extreme of Lake Superior but also, in all probability, entered upon\r\nthe waters of the Mississippi and learned of its western affluent; that\r\nMarquette not only received the Indians of the Illinois region in his\r\npost on the shores of Lake Superior, but traversed the length of the\r\nMississippi almost to its mouth, and returning revealed the site of\r\nChicago; that La Salle was inspired with the vision of a huge interior\r\nempire reaching from the Gulf to the Great Lakes. Before the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century, Perrot's influence was supreme in the Upper\r\nMississippi, while D'Iberville was laying the foundations of Louisiana\r\ntoward the mouth of the river. Nor is it without significance that while\r\nthe Verendryes were advancing toward the northwest (where they\r\ndiscovered the Big Horn Mountains and revealed the natural boundaries of\r\nthe Valley) the Mallet brothers were ascending the Platte, crossing the\r\nColorado plains to Santa Fé and so revealing the natural boundaries\r\ntoward the southwest.\r\n\r\nTo the English the great Valley was a land beyond the Alleghanies.\r\nSpotswood, the far-sighted Governor of Virginia, predecessor of frontier\r\nbuilders, grasped the situation when he proposed western settlements to\r\nprevent the French from becoming a great people at the back of the\r\ncolonies. He realized the importance of the Mississippi Valley as the\r\nfield for expansion, and the necessity to the English empire of\r\ndominating it, if England would remain the great power of the New World.\r\n\r\nIn the war that followed between France and England, we now see what\r\nthe men of the time could not have realized: that the main issue was\r\nneither the possession of the fisheries nor the approaches to the St.\r\nLawrence on the one hemisphere, nor the possession of India on the\r\nother, but the mastery of the interior basin of North America.\r\n\r\nHow little the nations realized the true meaning of the final victory of\r\nEngland is shown in the fact that Spain reluctantly received from France\r\nthe cession of the lands beyond the Mississippi, accepting it as a means\r\nof preventing the infringement of her colonial monopoly in Spanish\r\nAmerica rather than as a field for imperial expansion.\r\n\r\nBut we know now that when George Washington came as a stripling to the\r\ncamp of the French at the edge of the great Valley and demanded the\r\nrelinquishment of the French posts in the name of Virginia, he was\r\ndemanding in the name of the English speaking people the right to occupy\r\nand rule the real center of American resources and power. When\r\nBraddock's axmen cut their road from the Potomac toward the forks of the\r\nOhio they were opening a channel through which the forces of\r\ncivilization should flow with ever increasing momentum and \"carving a\r\ncross on the wilderness rim\" at the spot which is now the center of\r\nindustrial power of the American nation.\r\n\r\nEngland trembled on the brink of her great conquest, fearful of the\r\neffect of these far-stretching rivers upon her colonial system, timorous\r\nin the presence of the fierce peoples who held the vast domain beyond\r\nthe Alleghanies. It seems clear, however, that the Proclamation of 1763,\r\nforbidding settlement and the patenting of lands beyond the Alleghanies,\r\nwas not intended as a permanent creation of an Indian reservation out of\r\nthis Valley, but was rather a temporary arrangement in order that\r\nBritish plans might mature and a system of gradual colonization be\r\ndevised. Already our greatest leaders, men like Washington and\r\nFranklin, had been quick to see the importance of this new area for\r\nenlarged activities of the American people. A sudden revelation that it\r\nwas the West, rather than the ocean, which was the real theater for the\r\ncreative energy of America came with the triumph over France. The Ohio\r\nCompany and the Loyal Land Company indicate the interest at the outbreak\r\nof the war, while the Mississippi Company, headed by the Washingtons and\r\nLees, organized to occupy southern Illinois, Indiana, and western\r\nKentucky, mark the Virginia interest in the Mississippi Valley, and\r\nFranklin's activity in promoting a colony in the Illinois country\r\nillustrates the interest of the Philadelphians. Indeed, Franklin saw\r\nclearly the possibilities of a settlement there as a means of breaking\r\nup Spanish America. Writing to his son in 1767 he declared that a\r\n\"settlement should be made in the Illinois country . . . raising a\r\nstrength there which on occasions of a future war might easily be poured\r\ndown the Mississippi upon the lower country and into the Bay of Mexico\r\nto be used against Cuba, the French Islands, or Mexico itself.\"[182:1]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Valley had been the despair of France in the matter of\r\ngovernmental control. The coureurs de bois escaping from restraints of\r\nlaw and order took their way through its extensive wilderness, exploring\r\nand trading as they listed. Similarly, when the English colonists\r\ncrossed the Alleghanies they escaped from the control of mother colonies\r\nas well as of the mother country. If the Mississippi Valley revealed to\r\nthe statesmen of the East, in the exultation of the war with France, an\r\nopportunity for new empire building, it revealed to the frontiersmen,\r\nwho penetrated the passes of the Alleghanies, and entered into their new\r\ninheritance, the sharp distinctions between them and the Eastern lands\r\nwhich they left behind. From the beginning it was clear that the lands\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies furnished an opportunity and an incentive to\r\ndevelop American society on independent and unconventional lines. The\r\n\"men of the Western Waters\" broke with the old order of things,\r\nsubordinated social restraint to the freedom of the individual, won\r\ntheir title to the rich lands which they entered by hard fighting\r\nagainst the Indians, hotly challenged the right of the East to rule\r\nthem, demanded their own States, and would not be refused, spoke with\r\ncontempt of the old social order of ranks and classes in the lands\r\nbetween the Alleghanies and the Atlantic, and proclaimed the ideal of\r\ndemocracy for the vast country which they had entered. Not with the\r\nmercurial facility of the French did they follow the river systems of\r\nthe Great Valley. Like the advance of the glacier they changed the face\r\nof the country in their steady and inevitable progress, and they sought\r\nthe sea. It was not long before the Spaniards at the mouth of the river\r\nrealized the meaning of the new forces that had entered the Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the Governor of Louisiana wrote:\r\n\r\n     This vast and restless population progressively driving the\r\n     Indian tribes before them and upon us, seek to possess\r\n     themselves of all the extensive regions which the Indians\r\n     occupy between the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, the Gulf of\r\n     Mexico, and the Appalachian Mountains, thus becoming our\r\n     neighbors, at the same time that they menacingly ask for the\r\n     free navigation of the Mississippi. If they achieve their\r\n     object, their ambitions would not be confined to this side of\r\n     the Mississippi. Their writings, public papers, and speeches,\r\n     all turn on this point, the free navigation of the Gulf by the\r\n     rivers . . . which empty into it, the rich fur trade of the\r\n     Missouri, and in time the possession of the rich mines of the\r\n     interior provinces of the very Kingdom of Mexico. Their mode\r\n     of growth and their policy are as formidable for Spain as\r\n     their armies. . . . Their roving spirit and the readiness with\r\n     which they procure sustenance and shelter facilitate rapid\r\n     settlement. A rifle and a little corn meal in a bag are\r\n     enough for an American wandering alone in the woods for a\r\n     month. . . . With logs crossed upon one another he makes a\r\n     house, and even an impregnable fort against the Indians. . . .\r\n     Cold does not terrify him, and when a family wearies of one\r\n     place, it moves to another and settles there with the same\r\n     ease.\r\n\r\n     If such men come to occupy the banks of the Mississippi and\r\n     Missouri, or secure their navigation, doubtless nothing will\r\n     prevent them from crossing and penetrating into our provinces\r\n     on the other side, which, being to a great extent unoccupied,\r\n     can oppose no resistance. . . . In my opinion, a general\r\n     revolution in America threatens Spain unless the remedy be\r\n     applied promptly.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the pioneers who had occupied the uplands of the South, the\r\nbackwoods stock with its Scotch-Irish leaders which had formed on the\r\neastern edge of the Alleghanies, separate and distinct from the type of\r\ntidewater and New England, had found in the Mississippi Valley a new\r\nfield for expansion under conditions of free land and unrestraint. These\r\nconditions gave it promise of ample time to work out its own social\r\ntype. But, first of all, these men who were occupying the Western Waters\r\nmust find an outlet for their surplus products, if they were to become\r\na powerful people. While the Alleghanies placed a veto toward the east,\r\nthe Mississippi opened a broad highway to the south. Its swift current\r\ntook their flat boats in its strong arms to bear them to the sea, but\r\nacross the outlet of the great river Spain drew the barrier of her\r\ncolonial monopoly and denied them exit.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the Mississippi Valley in American history at the\r\nopening of the new republic, therefore, lay in the fact that, beyond the\r\narea of the social and political control of the thirteen colonies, there\r\nhad arisen a new and aggressive society which imperiously put the\r\nquestions of the public lands, internal communication, local\r\nself-government, defense, and aggressive expansion, before the\r\nlegislators of the old colonial régime. The men of the Mississippi\r\nValley compelled the men of the East to think in American terms instead\r\nof European. They dragged a reluctant nation on in a new course.\r\n\r\nFrom the Revolution to the end of the War of 1812 Europe regarded the\r\ndestiny of the Mississippi Valley as undetermined. Spain desired to\r\nmaintain her hold by means of the control given through the possession\r\nof the mouth of the river and the Gulf, by her influence upon the Indian\r\ntribes, and by intrigues with the settlers. Her object was primarily to\r\nsafeguard the Spanish American monopoly which had made her a great\r\nnation in the world. Instinctively she seemed to surmise that out of\r\nthis Valley were the issues of her future; here was the lever which\r\nmight break successively, from her empire fragments about the\r\nGulf--Louisiana, Florida and Texas, Cuba and Porto Rico--the Southwest\r\nand Pacific coast, and even the Philippines and the Isthmian Canal,\r\nwhile the American republic, building itself on the resources of the\r\nValley, should become paramount over the independent republics into\r\nwhich her empire was to disintegrate.\r\n\r\nFrance, seeking to regain her former colonial power, would use the\r\nMississippi Valley as a means of provisioning her West Indian islands;\r\nof dominating Spanish America, and of subordinating to her purposes the\r\nfeeble United States, which her policy assigned to the lands between the\r\nAtlantic and the Alleghanies. The ancient Bourbon monarchy, the\r\nrevolutionary republic, and the Napoleonic empire--all contemplated the\r\nacquisition of the whole Valley of the Mississippi from the Alleghanies\r\nto the Rocky Mountains.[186:1]\r\n\r\nEngland holding the Great Lakes, dominating the northern Indian\r\npopulations and threatening the Gulf and the mouth of the Mississippi by\r\nher fleet, watched during the Revolution, the Confederation, and the\r\nearly republic for the breaking of the fragile bonds of the thirteen\r\nStates, ready to extend her protection over the settlers in the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the prospect of England's taking Louisiana and Florida from\r\nSpain, Jefferson wrote in 1790: \"Embraced from St. Croix to St. Mary's\r\non one side by their possessions, on the other by their fleet, we need\r\nnot hesitate to say that they would soon find means to unite to them all\r\nthe territory covered by the ramifications of the Mississippi.\" And\r\nthat, he thought, must result in \"bloody and eternal war or indissoluble\r\nconfederacy\" with England.\r\n\r\nNone of these nations deemed it impossible that American settlers in the\r\nMississippi Valley might be won to accept another flag than that of the\r\nUnited States. Gardoqui had the effrontery in 1787 to suggest to Madison\r\nthat the Kentuckians would make good Spanish subjects. France enlisted\r\nthe support of frontiersmen led by George Rogers Clark for her attempted\r\nconquest of Louisiana in 1793. England tried to win support among the\r\nwestern settlers. Indeed, when we recall that George Rogers Clark\r\naccepted a commission as Major General from France in 1793 and again in\r\n1798; that Wilkinson, afterwards commander-in-chief of the American\r\narmy, secretly asked Spanish citizenship and promised renunciation of\r\nhis American allegiance; that Governor Sevier of Franklin, afterwards\r\nSenator from Tennessee and its first Governor as a State, Robertson the\r\nfounder of Cumberland, and Blount, Governor of the Southwest Territory\r\nand afterwards Senator from Tennessee, were all willing to accept the\r\nrule of another nation sooner than see the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nyielded by the American government we can easily believe that it lay\r\nwithin the realm of possibility that another allegiance might have been\r\naccepted by the frontiersmen themselves. We may well trust Rufus Putnam,\r\nwhose federalism and devotion to his country had been proved and whose\r\nwork in founding New England's settlement at Marietta is well known,\r\nwhen he wrote in 1790 in answer to Fisher Ames's question whether the\r\nMississippi Valley could be retained in the Union: \"Should Congress give\r\nup her claim to the navigation of the Mississippi or cede it to the\r\nSpaniards, I believe the people in the Western quarter would separate\r\nthemselves from the United States very soon. Such a measure, I have no\r\ndoubt, would excite so much rage and dissatisfaction that the people\r\nwould sooner put themselves under the despotic government of Spain than\r\nremain the indented servants of Congress.\" He added that if Congress did\r\nnot afford due protection also to these western settlers they might turn\r\nto England or Spain.[187:1]\r\n\r\nPrior to the railroad the Mississippi Valley was potentially the basis\r\nfor an independent empire, in spite of the fact that its population\r\nwould inevitably be drawn from the Eastern States. Its natural outlet\r\nwas down the current to the Gulf. New Orleans controlled the Valley, in\r\nthe words of Wilkinson, \"as the key the lock, or the citadel the\r\noutworks.\" So long as the Mississippi Valley was menaced, or in part\r\ncontrolled, by rival European states, just so long must the United\r\nStates be a part of the state system of Europe, involved in its\r\nfortunes. And particularly was this the case in view of the fact that\r\nuntil the Union made internal commerce, based upon the Mississippi\r\nValley, its dominant economic interest, the merchants and sailors of the\r\nnortheastern States and the staple producers of the southern sea-board\r\nwere a commercial appanage of Europe. The significance of the\r\nMississippi Valley was clearly seen by Jefferson. Writing to Livingston\r\nin 1802 he declared:\r\n\r\n     There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which\r\n     is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through\r\n     which the produce of three-eights of our territory must pass\r\n     to market, and from its fertility it will ere long yield more\r\n     than half of our whole produce and contain more than half of\r\n     our inhabitants. . . . The day that France takes possession of\r\n     New Orleans fixes the sentence which is to restrain her within\r\n     her low-water mark. It seals the union of two nations who in\r\n     conjunction can maintain exclusive possession of the ocean.\r\n     From that moment we must marry ourselves to the British fleet\r\n     and nation . . . holding the two continents of America in\r\n     sequestration for the common purposes of the united British\r\n     and American nations.[188:1]\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Louisiana was a recognition of the essential unity of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. The French engineer Collot reported to his\r\ngovernment after an investigation in 1796:\r\n\r\n     All the positions on the left [east] bank of the Mississippi\r\n     . . . without the alliance of the Western states are far from\r\n     covering Louisiana. . . . When two nations possess, one the\r\n     coasts and the other the plains, the former must inevitably\r\n     embark or submit. From thence I conclude that the Western\r\n     States of the North American republic must unite themselves\r\n     with Louisiana and form in the future one single compact\r\n     nation; or else that colony to whatever power it shall belong\r\n     will be conquered or devoured.\r\n\r\nThe effect of bringing political unity to the Mississippi Valley by the\r\nLouisiana Purchase was profound. It was the decisive step of the United\r\nStates on an independent career as a world power, free from entangling\r\nforeign alliances. The victories of Harrison in the Northwest, in the\r\nWar of 1812 that followed, ensured our expansion in the northern half of\r\nthe Valley. Jackson's triumphal march to the Gulf and his defense of New\r\nOrleans in the same war won the basis for that Cotton Kingdom, so\r\nimportant in the economic life of the nation and so pregnant with the\r\nissue of slavery.[189:1] The acquisition of Florida, Texas, and the Far\r\nWest followed naturally. Not only was the nation set on an independent\r\npath in foreign relations; its political system was revolutionized, for\r\nthe Mississippi Valley now opened the way for adding State after State,\r\nswamping the New England section and its Federalism. The doctrine of\r\nstrict construction had received a fatal blow at the hands of its own\r\nprophet. The old conception of historic sovereign States, makers of a\r\nfederation, was shattered by this vast addition of raw material for an\r\nindefinite number of parallelograms called States, nursed through a\r\nTerritorial period by the Federal government, admitted under conditions,\r\nand animated by national rather than by State patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe area of the nation had been so enlarged and the development of the\r\ninternal resources so promoted, by the acquisition of the whole course\r\nof the mighty river, its tributaries and its outlet, that the Atlantic\r\ncoast soon turned its economic energies from the sea to the interior.\r\nCities and sections began to struggle for ascendancy over its industrial\r\nlife. A real national activity, a genuine American culture began. The\r\nvast spaces, the huge natural resources, of the Valley demanded\r\nexploitation and population. Later there came the tide of foreign\r\nimmigration which has risen so steadily that it has made a composite\r\nAmerican people whose amalgamation is destined to produce a new national\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nBut without attempting to exhaust, or even to indicate, all the effects\r\nof the Louisiana Purchase, I wish next to ask your attention to the\r\nsignificance of the Mississippi Valley in the promotion of democracy and\r\nthe transfer of the political center of gravity in the nation. The\r\nMississippi Valley has been the especial home of democracy. Born of free\r\nland and the pioneer spirit, nurtured in the ideas of the Revolution and\r\nfinding free play for these ideas in the freedom of the wilderness,\r\ndemocracy showed itself in the earliest utterances of the men of the\r\nWestern Waters and it has persisted there. The demand for local\r\nself-government, which was insistent on the frontier, and the\r\nendorsement given by the Alleghanies to these demands led to the\r\ncreation of a system of independent Western governments and to the\r\nOrdinance of 1787, an original contribution to colonial policy. This was\r\nframed in the period when any rigorous subjection of the West to Eastern\r\nrule would have endangered the ties that bound them to the Union\r\nitself. In the Constitutional Convention prominent Eastern statesmen\r\nexpressed their fears of the Western democracy and would have checked\r\nits ability to out-vote the regions of property by limiting its\r\npolitical power, so that it should never equal that of the Atlantic\r\ncoast. But more liberal counsels prevailed. In the first debates upon\r\nthe public lands, also, it was clearly stated that the social system of\r\nthe nation was involved quite as much as the question of revenue.\r\nEastern fears that cheap lands in abundance would depopulate the\r\nAtlantic States and check their industrial growth by a scarcity of labor\r\nsupply were met by the answer of one of the representatives in 1796:\r\n\r\n     I question if any man would be hardy enough to point out a\r\n     class of citizens by name that ought to be the servants of the\r\n     community; yet unless that is done to what class of the People\r\n     could you direct such a law? But if you passed such an act\r\n     [limiting the area offered for sale in the Mississippi\r\n     Valley], it would be tantamount to saying that there is some\r\n     class which must remain here, and by law be obliged to serve\r\n     the others for such wages as they please to give.\r\n\r\nGallatin showed his comprehension of the basis of the prosperous\r\nAmerican democracy in the same debate when he said:\r\n\r\n     If the cause of the happiness of this country was examined\r\n     into, it would be found to arise as much from the great plenty\r\n     of land in proportion to the inhabitants, which their citizens\r\n     enjoyed as from the wisdom of their political institutions.\r\n\r\nOut of this frontier democratic society where the freedom and abundance\r\nof land in the great Valley opened a refuge to the oppressed in all\r\nregions, came the Jacksonian democracy which governed the nation after\r\nthe downfall of the party of John Quincy Adams. Its center rested in\r\nTennessee, the region from which so large a portion of the Mississippi\r\nValley was settled by descendants of the men of the Upland South. The\r\nrule of the Mississippi Valley is seen when we recall the place that\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri held in both parties. Besides Jackson,\r\nClay, Harrison and Polk, we count such presidential candidates as Hugh\r\nWhite and John Bell, Vice President R. M. Johnson, Grundy, the chairman\r\nof the finance committee, and Benton, the champion of western\r\nradicalism.\r\n\r\nIt was in this same period, and largely by reason of the drainage of\r\npopulation to the West, and the stir in the air raised by the Western\r\nwinds of Jacksonian democracy, that most of the older States\r\nreconstructed their constitutions on a more democratic basis. From the\r\nMississippi Valley where there were liberal suffrage provisions (based\r\non population alone instead of property and population), disregard of\r\nvested interests, and insistence on the rights of man, came the\r\ninspiration for this era of change in the franchise and apportionment,\r\nof reform of laws for imprisonment for debt, of general attacks upon\r\nmonopoly and privilege. \"It is now plain,\" wrote Jackson in 1837, \"that\r\nthe war is to be carried on by the monied aristocracy of the few against\r\nthe democracy of numbers; the [prosperous] to make the honest laborers\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water . . . through the credit and paper\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Mississippi Valley had grown in population and\r\npolitical power so that it ranked with the older sections. The next\r\nindication of its significance in American history which I shall\r\nmention is its position in shaping the economic and political course of\r\nthe nation between the close of the War of 1812 and the slavery\r\nstruggle. In 1790 the Mississippi Valley had a population of about a\r\nhundred thousand, or one-fortieth of that of the United States as a\r\nwhole; by 1810 it had over a million, or one-seventh; by 1830 it had\r\nthree and two-thirds millions, or over one-fourth; by 1840 over six\r\nmillions, more than one-third. While the Atlantic coast increased only a\r\nmillion and a half souls between 1830 and 1840, the Mississippi Valley\r\ngained nearly three millions. Ohio (virgin wilderness in 1790) was, half\r\na century later, nearly as populous as Pennsylvania and twice as\r\npopulous as Massachusetts. While Virginia, North Carolina, and South\r\nCarolina were gaining 60,000 souls between 1830 and 1840, Illinois\r\ngained 318,000. Indeed, the growth of this State alone excelled that of\r\nthe entire South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThese figures show the significance of the Mississippi Valley in its\r\npressure upon the older section by the competition of its cheap lands,\r\nits abundant harvests, and its drainage of the labor supply. All of\r\nthese things meant an upward lift to the Eastern wage earner. But they\r\nmeant also an increase of political power in the Valley. Before the War\r\nof 1812 the Mississippi Valley had six senators, New England ten, the\r\nMiddle States ten, and the South eight. By 1840 the Mississippi Valley\r\nhad twenty-two senators, double those of the Middle States and New\r\nEngland combined, and nearly three times as many as the Old South; while\r\nin the House of Representatives the Mississippi Valley outweighed any\r\none of the old sections. In 1810 it had less than one-third the power of\r\nNew England and the South together in the House. In 1840 it outweighed\r\nthem both combined and because of its special circumstances it held the\r\nbalance of power.\r\n\r\nWhile the Mississippi Valley thus rose to superior political power as\r\ncompared with any of the old sections, its economic development made it\r\nthe inciting factor in the industrial life of the nation. After the War\r\nof 1812 the steamboat revolutionized the transportation facilities of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. In each economic area a surplus formed,\r\ndemanding an outlet and demanding returns in manufactures. The spread of\r\ncotton into the lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Plains had a\r\ndouble significance. This transfer of the center of cotton production\r\naway from the Atlantic South not only brought increasing hardship and\r\nincreasing unrest to the East as the competition of the virgin soils\r\ndepressed Atlantic land values and made Eastern labor increasingly dear,\r\nbut the price of cotton fell also in due proportion to the increase in\r\nproduction by the Mississippi Valley. While the transfer of economic\r\npower from the Seaboard South to the Cotton Kingdom of the lower\r\nMississippi Valley was in progress, the upper Mississippi Valley was\r\nleaping forward, partly under the stimulus of a market for its surplus\r\nin the plantations of the South, where almost exclusive cultivation of\r\nthe great staples resulted in a lack of foodstuffs and livestock.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the great river and its affluents became the highway of\r\na commerce that reached to the West Indies, the Atlantic Coast, Europe,\r\nand South America. The Mississippi Valley was an industrial entity, from\r\nPittsburgh and Santa Fé to New Orleans. It became the most important\r\ninfluence in American politics and industry. Washington had declared in\r\n1784 that it was the part of wisdom for Virginia to bind the West to the\r\nEast by ties of interest through internal improvement thereby taking\r\nadvantage of the extensive and valuable trade of a rising empire.\r\n\r\nThis realization of the fact that an economic empire was growing up\r\nbeyond the mountains stimulated rival cities, New York, Philadelphia,\r\nand Baltimore, to engage in a struggle to supply the West with goods\r\nand receive its products. This resulted in an attempt to break down the\r\nbarrier of the Alleghanies by internal improvements. The movement became\r\nespecially active after the War of 1812, when New York carried out De\r\nWitt Clinton's vast conception of making by the Erie Canal a greater\r\nHudson which should drain to the port of New York all the basin of the\r\nGreat Lakes, and by means of other canals even divert the traffic from\r\nthe tributaries of the Mississippi. New York City's commercial\r\nascendancy dates from this connection with interior New York and the\r\nMississippi Valley. A writer in Hunt's _Merchants' Magazine_ in 1869\r\nmakes the significance of this clearer by these words:\r\n\r\n     There was a period in the history of the seaboard cities when\r\n     there was no West; and when the Alleghany Mountains formed the\r\n     frontier of settlement and agricultural production. During\r\n     that epoch the seaboard cities, North and South, grew in\r\n     proportion to the extent and fertility of the country in their\r\n     rear; and as Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia\r\n     were more productive in staples valuable to commerce than the\r\n     colonies north of them, the cities of Baltimore, Norfolk,\r\n     Charleston, and Savannah enjoyed a greater trade and\r\n     experienced a larger growth than those on the northern\r\n     seaboard.\r\n\r\nHe, then, classifies the periods of city development into three: (1) the\r\nprovincial, limited to the Atlantic seaboard; (2) that of canal and\r\nturnpike connected with the Mississippi Valley; and (3) that of railroad\r\nconnection. Thus he was able to show how Norfolk, for example, was shut\r\noff from the enriching currents of interior trade and was outstripped\r\nby New York. The efforts of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and\r\nSavannah to divert the trade of the Mississippi system to their own\r\nports on the Atlantic, and the rise or fall of these cities in\r\nproportion as they succeeded are a sufficient indication of the meaning\r\nof the Mississippi Valley in American industrial life. What colonial\r\nempire has been for London that the Mississippi Valley is to the\r\nseaboard cities of the United States, awakening visions of industrial\r\nempire, systematic control of vast spaces, producing the American type\r\nof the captain of industry.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone city rivalry that converged upon the Mississippi Valley\r\nand sought its alliance. Sectional rivalry likewise saw that the balance\r\nof power possessed by the interior furnished an opportunity for\r\ncombinations. This was a fundamental feature of Calhoun's policy when he\r\nurged the seaboard South to complete a railroad system to tap the\r\nNorthwest. As Washington had hoped to make western trade seek its outlet\r\nin Virginia and build up the industrial power of the Old Dominion by\r\nenriching intercourse with the Mississippi Valley, as Monroe wished to\r\nbind the West to Virginia's political interests; and as De Witt Clinton\r\nwished to attach it to New York, so Calhoun and Hayne would make\r\n\"Georgia and Carolina the commercial center of the Union, and the two\r\nmost powerful and influential members of the confederacy,\" by draining\r\nthe Mississippi Valley to their ports. \"I believe,\" said Calhoun, \"that\r\nthe success of a connection of the West is of the last importance to us\r\npolitically and commercially. . . . I do verily believe that Charleston\r\nhas more advantages in her position for the Western trade, than any city\r\non the Atlantic, but to develop them we ought to look to the Tennessee\r\ninstead of the Ohio, and much farther to the West than Cincinnati or\r\nLexington.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the secret of Calhoun's advocacy in 1836 and 1837 both of the\r\ndistribution of the surplus revenue and of the cession of the public\r\nlands to the States in which they lay, as an inducement to the West to\r\nally itself with Southern policies; and it is the key to the readiness\r\nof Calhoun, even after he lost his nationalism, to promote internal\r\nimprovements which would foster the southward current of trade on the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, I may simply call your attention to the fact\r\nthat Clay's whole system of internal improvements and tariff was based\r\nupon the place of the Mississippi Valley in American life. It was the\r\nupper part of the Valley, and especially the Ohio Valley, that furnished\r\nthe votes which carried the tariffs of 1816, 1824, and 1828. Its\r\ninterests profoundly influenced the details of those tariffs and its\r\nneed of internal improvement constituted a basis for sectional\r\nbargaining in all the constructive legislation after the War of 1812.\r\nNew England, the Middle Region, and the South each sought alliance with\r\nthe growing section beyond the mountains. American legislation bears the\r\nenduring evidence of these alliances. Even the National Bank found in\r\nthis Valley the main sphere of its business. The nation had turned its\r\nenergies to internal exploitation, and sections contended for the\r\neconomic and political power derived from connection with the interior.\r\n\r\nBut already the Mississippi Valley was beginning to stratify, both\r\nsocially and geographically. As the railroads pushed across the\r\nmountains, the tide of New England and New York colonists and German\r\nimmigrants sought the basin of the Great Lakes and the Upper\r\nMississippi. A distinct zone, industrially and socially connected with\r\nNew England, was forming. The railroad reinforced the Erie Canal and, as\r\nDe Bow put it, turned back the tide of the Father of Waters so that its\r\noutlet was in New York instead of New Orleans for a large part of the\r\nValley. Below the Northern zone was the border zone of the Upland\r\nSouth, the region of compromise, including both banks of the Ohio and\r\nthe Missouri and reaching down to the hills on the north of the Gulf\r\nPlains. The Cotton Kingdom based on slavery found its center in the\r\nfertile soils along the Lower Mississippi and the black prairies of\r\nGeorgia and Alabama, and was settled largely by planters from the old\r\ncotton lands of the Atlantic States. The Mississippi Valley had\r\nrejuvenated slavery, had given it an aggressive tone characteristic of\r\nWestern life.\r\n\r\nThus the Valley found itself in the midst of the slavery struggle at the\r\nvery time when its own society had lost homogeneity. Let us allow two\r\nleaders, one of the South and one of the North, to describe the\r\nsituation; and, first, let the South speak. Said Hammond, of South\r\nCarolina,[198:1] in a speech in the Senate on March 4, 1858:\r\n\r\n     I think it not improper that I should attempt to bring the\r\n     North and South face to face, and see what resources each of\r\n     us might have in the contingency of separate organizations.\r\n\r\n     Through the heart of our country runs the great Mississippi,\r\n     the father of waters, into whose bosom are poured thirty-six\r\n     thousand miles of tributary streams; and beyond we have the\r\n     desert prairie wastes to protect us in our rear. Can you hem\r\n     in such a territory as that? You talk of putting up a wall of\r\n     fire around eight hundred and fifty thousand miles so\r\n     situated! How absurd.\r\n\r\n     But in this territory lies the great valley of the\r\n     Mississippi, now the real and soon to be the acknowledged seat\r\n     of the empire of the world. The sway of that valley will be as\r\n     great as ever the Nile knew in the earlier ages of mankind.\r\n     We own the most of it. The most valuable part of it belongs to\r\n     us now; and although those who have settled above us are now\r\n     opposed to us, another generation will tell a different tale.\r\n     They are ours by all the laws of nature; slave labor will go\r\n     to every foot of this great valley where it will be found\r\n     profitable to use it, and some of those who may not use it are\r\n     soon to be united with us by such ties as will make us one and\r\n     inseparable. The iron horse will soon be clattering over the\r\n     sunny plains of the South to bear the products of its upper\r\n     tributaries to our Atlantic ports, as it now does through the\r\n     ice-bound North. There is the great Mississippi, bond of union\r\n     made by nature herself. She will maintain it forever.\r\n\r\nAs the Seaboard South had transferred the mantle of leadership to\r\nTennessee and then to the Cotton Kingdom of the Lower Mississippi, so\r\nNew England and New York resigned their command to the northern half of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and the basin of the Great Lakes. Seward, the\r\nold-time leader of the Eastern Whigs who had just lost the Republican\r\nnomination for the presidency to Lincoln, may rightfully speak for the\r\nNortheast. In the fall of 1860, addressing an audience at Madison,\r\nWisconsin, he declared:[199:1]\r\n\r\n     The empire established at Washington is of less than a hundred\r\n     years' formation. It was the empire of thirteen Atlantic\r\n     states. Still, practically, the mission of that empire is\r\n     fulfilled. The power that directs it is ready to pass away\r\n     from those thirteen states, and although held and exercised\r\n     under the same constitution and national form of government,\r\n     yet it is now in the very act of being transferred from the\r\n     thirteen states east of the Alleghany mountains and on the\r\n     coast of the Atlantic ocean, to the twenty states that lie\r\n     west of the Alleghanies, and stretch away from their base to\r\n     the base of the Rocky mountains on the West, and you are the\r\n     heirs to it. When the next census shall reveal your power, you\r\n     will be found to be the masters of the United States of\r\n     America, and through them the dominating political power of\r\n     the world.\r\n\r\nAppealing to the Northwest on the slavery issue Seward declared:\r\n\r\n     The whole responsibility rests henceforth directly or\r\n     indirectly on the people of the Northwest. . . . There can be\r\n     no virtue in commercial and manufacturing communities to\r\n     maintain a democracy, when the democracy themselves do not\r\n     want a democracy. There is no virtue in Pearl street, in Wall\r\n     street, in Court street, in Chestnut street, in any other\r\n     street of great commercial cities, that can save the great\r\n     democratic government of ours, when you cease to uphold it\r\n     with your intelligent votes, your strong and mighty hands. You\r\n     must, therefore, lead us as we heretofore reserved and\r\n     prepared the way for you. We resign to you the banner of human\r\n     rights and human liberty, on this continent, and we bid you be\r\n     firm, bold and onward and then you may hope that we will be\r\n     able to follow you.\r\n\r\nWhen we survey the course of the slavery struggle in the United States\r\nit is clear that the form the question took was due to the Mississippi\r\nValley. The Ordinance of 1787, the Missouri Compromise, the Texas\r\nquestion, the Free Soil agitation, the Compromise of 1850, the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, the Dred Scott decision, \"bleeding Kansas\"--these\r\nare all Mississippi Valley questions, and the mere enumeration makes it\r\nplain that it was the Mississippi Valley as an area for expansion which\r\ngave the slavery issue its significance in American history. But for\r\nthis field of expansion, slavery might have fulfilled the expectation of\r\nthe fathers and gradually died away.\r\n\r\nOf the significance of the Mississippi Valley in the Civil War, it is\r\nunnecessary that I should speak. Illinois gave to the North its\r\nPresident; Mississippi gave to the South its President. Lincoln and\r\nDavis were both born in Kentucky. Grant and Sherman, the northern\r\ngenerals, came from the Mississippi Valley; and both of them believed\r\nthat when Vicksburg fell the cause of the South was lost, and so it must\r\nhave been if the Confederacy had been unable, after victories in the\r\nEast, to regain the Father of Waters; for, as General Sherman said:\r\n\"Whatever power holds that river can govern this continent.\"\r\n\r\nWith the close of the war political power passed for many years to the\r\nnorthern half of the Mississippi Valley, as the names of Grant, Hayes,\r\nGarfield, Harrison, and McKinley indicate. The population of the Valley\r\ngrew from about fifteen millions in 1860 to over forty millions in\r\n1900--over half the total population of the United States. The\r\nsignificance of its industrial growth is not likely to be overestimated\r\nor overlooked. On its northern border, from near Minnesota's boundary\r\nline, through the Great Lakes to Pittsburgh, on its eastern edge, runs a\r\nhuge movement of iron from mine to factory. This industry is basal in\r\nAmerican life, and it has revolutionized the industry of the world. The\r\nUnited States produces pig iron and steel in amount equal to her two\r\ngreatest competitors combined, and the iron ores for this product are\r\nchiefly in the Mississippi Valley. It is the chief producer of coal,\r\nthereby enabling the United States almost to equal the combined\r\nproduction of Germany and Great Britain; and great oil fields of the\r\nnation are in its midst. Its huge crops of wheat and corn and its cattle\r\nare the main resources for the United States and are drawn upon by\r\nEurope. Its cotton furnishes two-thirds of the world's factory supply.\r\nIts railroad system constitutes the greatest transportation network in\r\nthe world. Again it is seeking industrial consolidation by demanding\r\nimprovement of its vast water system as a unit. If this design, favored\r\nby Roosevelt, shall at some time be accomplished, again the bulk of the\r\ncommerce of the Valley may flow along the old routes to New Orleans; and\r\nto Galveston by the development of southern railroad outlets after the\r\nbuilding of the Panama Canal. For the development and exploitation of\r\nthese and of the transportation and trade interests of the Middle West,\r\nEastern capital has been consolidated into huge corporations, trusts,\r\nand combinations. With the influx of capital, and the rise of cities and\r\nmanufactures, portions of the Mississippi Valley have become assimilated\r\nwith the East. With the end of the era of free lands the basis of its\r\ndemocratic society is passing away.\r\n\r\nThe final topic on which I shall briefly comment in this discussion of\r\nthe significance of the Mississippi Valley in American history is a\r\ncorollary of this condition. Has the Mississippi Valley a permanent\r\ncontribution to make to American society, or is it to be adjusted into a\r\ntype characteristically Eastern and European? In other words, has the\r\nUnited States itself an original contribution to make to the history of\r\nsociety? This is what it comes to. The most significant fact in the\r\nMississippi Valley is its ideals. Here has been developed, not by\r\nrevolutionary theory, but by growth among free opportunities, the\r\nconception of a vast democracy made up of mobile ascending individuals,\r\nconscious of their power and their responsibilities. Can these ideals of\r\nindividualism and democracy be reconciled and applied to the twentieth\r\ncentury type of civilization?\r\n\r\nOther nations have been rich and prosperous and powerful, art-loving and\r\nempire-building. No other nation on a vast scale has been controlled by\r\na self-conscious, self-restrained democracy in the interests of progress\r\nand freedom, industrial as well as political. It is in the vast and\r\nlevel spaces of the Mississippi Valley, if anywhere, that the forces of\r\nsocial transformation and the modification of its democratic ideals may\r\nbe arrested.\r\n\r\nBeginning with competitive individualism, as well as with belief in\r\nequality, the farmers of the Mississippi Valley gradually learned that\r\nunrestrained competition and combination meant the triumph of the\r\nstrongest, the seizure in the interest of a dominant class of the\r\nstrategic points of the nation's life. They learned that between the\r\nideal of individualism, unrestrained by society, and the ideal of\r\ndemocracy, was an innate conflict; that their very ambitions and\r\nforcefulness had endangered their democracy. The significance of the\r\nMississippi Valley in American history has lain partly in the fact that\r\nit was a region of revolt. Here have arisen varied, sometimes\r\nill-considered, but always devoted, movements for ameliorating the lot\r\nof the common man in the interests of democracy. Out of the Mississippi\r\nValley have come successive and related tidal waves of popular demand\r\nfor real or imagined legislative safeguards to their rights and their\r\nsocial ideals. The Granger movement, the Greenback movement, the\r\nPopulist movement, Bryan Democracy, and Roosevelt Republicanism all\r\nfound their greatest strength in the Mississippi Valley. They were\r\nMississippi Valley ideals in action. Its people were learning by\r\nexperiment and experience how to grapple with the fundamental problem of\r\ncreating a just social order that shall sustain the free, progressive,\r\nindividual in a real democracy. The Mississippi Valley is asking, \"What\r\nshall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\"\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Valley has furnished a new social order to America. Its\r\nuniversities have set new types of institutions for social service and\r\nfor the elevation of the plain people. Its historians should recount its\r\nold ambitions, and inventory its ideals, as well as its resources, for\r\nthe information of the present age, to the end that building on its\r\npast, the mighty Valley may have a significance in the life of the\r\nnation even more profound than any which I have recounted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[177:1] Proceedings of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association for\r\n1909-10.

A glance at the map of the United States reveals the truth.\r\nTo write of a \"Western sectionalism,\" bounded on the east by the\r\nAlleghanies, is, in itself, to proclaim the writer a provincial. What is\r\nthe West? What has it been in American life? To have the answers to\r\nthese questions, is to understand the most significant features of the\r\nUnited States of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe West, at bottom, is a form of society, rather than an area. It is\r\nthe term applied to the region whose social conditions result from the\r\napplication of older institutions and ideas to the transforming\r\ninfluences of free land. By this application, a new environment is\r\nsuddenly entered, freedom of opportunity is opened, the cake of custom\r\nis broken, and new activities, new lines of growth, new institutions and\r\nnew ideals, are brought into existence. The wilderness disappears, the\r\n\"West\" proper passes on to a new frontier, and in the former area, a new\r\nsociety has emerged from its contact with the backwoods. Gradually this\r\nsociety loses its primitive conditions, and assimilates itself to the\r\ntype of the older social conditions of the East; but it bears within it\r\nenduring and distinguishing survivals of its frontier experience. Decade\r\nafter decade, West after West, this rebirth of American society has gone\r\non, has left its traces behind it, and has reacted on the East. The\r\nhistory of our political institutions, our democracy, is not a history\r\nof imitation, of simple borrowing; it is a history of the evolution and\r\nadaptation of organs in response to changed environment, a history of\r\nthe origin of new political species. In this sense, therefore, the West\r\nhas been a constructive force of the highest significance in our life.\r\nTo use the words of that acute and widely informed observer, Mr. Bryce,\r\n\"The West is the most American part of America. . . . What Europe is to\r\nAsia, what America is to England, that the Western States and\r\nTerritories are to the Atlantic States.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe West, as a phase of social organization, began with the Atlantic\r\ncoast, and passed across the continent. But the colonial tide-water area\r\nwas in close touch with the Old World, and soon lost its Western\r\naspects. In the middle of the eighteenth century, the newer social\r\nconditions appeared along the upper waters of the tributaries of the\r\nAtlantic. Here it was that the West took on its distinguishing features,\r\nand transmitted frontier traits and ideals to this area in later days.\r\nOn the coast, were the fishermen and skippers, the merchants and\r\nplanters, with eyes turned toward Europe. Beyond the falls of the rivers\r\nwere the pioneer farmers, largely of non-English stock, Scotch-Irish and\r\nGerman. They constituted a distinct people, and may be regarded as an\r\nexpansion of the social and economic life of the middle region into the\r\nback country of the South. These frontiersmen were the ancestors of\r\nBoone, Andrew Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, and Lincoln. Washington and\r\nJefferson were profoundly affected by these frontier conditions. The\r\nforest clearings have been the seed plots of American character.\r\n\r\nIn the Revolutionary days, the settlers crossed the Alleghanies and put\r\na barrier between them and the coast. They became, to use their phrases,\r\n\"the men of the Western waters,\" the heirs of the \"Western world.\" In\r\nthis era, the backwoodsmen, all along the western slopes of the\r\nmountains, with a keen sense of the difference between them and the\r\ndwellers on the coast, demanded organization into independent States of\r\nthe Union. Self-government was their ideal. Said one of their rude, but\r\nenergetic petitions for statehood: \"Some of our fellow-citizens may\r\nthink we are not able to conduct our affairs and consult our interests;\r\nbut if our society is rude, much wisdom is not necessary to supply our\r\nwants, and a fool can sometimes put on his clothes better than a wise\r\nman can do it for him.\" This forest philosophy is the philosophy of\r\nAmerican democracy. But the men of the coast were not ready to admit its\r\nimplications. They apportioned the State legislatures so that the\r\nproperty-holding minority of the tide-water lands were able to outvote\r\nthe more populous back countries. A similar system was proposed by\r\nFederalists in the constitutional convention of 1787. Gouverneur Morris,\r\narguing in favor of basing representation on property as well as\r\nnumbers, declared that \"he looked forward, also, to that range of new\r\nStates which would soon be formed in the West. He thought the rule of\r\nrepresentation ought to be so fixed, as to secure to the Atlantic States\r\na prevalence in the national councils.\" \"The new States,\" said he, \"will\r\nknow less of the public interest than these; will have an interest in\r\nmany respects different; in particular will be little scrupulous of\r\ninvolving the community in wars, the burdens and operations of which\r\nwould fall chiefly on the maritime States. Provision ought, therefore,\r\nto be made to prevent the maritime States from being hereafter outvoted\r\nby them.\" He added that the Western country \"would not be able to\r\nfurnish men equally enlightened to share in the administration of our\r\ncommon interests. The busy haunts of men, not the remote wilderness, was\r\nthe proper school of political talents. If the Western people get power\r\ninto their hands, they will ruin the Atlantic interest. The back\r\nmembers are always most averse to the best measures.\" Add to these\r\nutterances of Gouverneur Morris the impassioned protest of Josiah\r\nQuincy, of Massachusetts, in the debates in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on the admission of Louisiana. Referring to the\r\ndiscussion over the slave votes and the West in the constitutional\r\nconvention, he declared, \"Suppose, then, that it had been distinctly\r\nforeseen that, in addition to the effect of this weight, the whole\r\npopulation of a world beyond the Mississippi was to be brought into this\r\nand the other branch of the legislature, to form our laws, control our\r\nrights, and decide our destiny. Sir, can it be pretended that the\r\npatriots of that day would for one moment have listened to it? . . .\r\nThey had not taken degrees at the hospital of idiocy. . . . Why, sir, I\r\nhave already heard of six States, and some say there will be, at no\r\ngreat distant time, more. I have also heard that the mouth of the Ohio\r\nwill be far to the east of the center of the contemplated empire. . . .\r\nYou have no authority to throw the rights and property of this people\r\ninto 'hotch-pot' with the wild men on the Missouri, nor with the mixed,\r\nthough more respectable, race of Anglo-Hispano-Gallo-Americans who bask\r\non the sands in the mouth of the Mississippi. . . . Do you suppose the\r\npeople of the Northern and Atlantic States will, or ought to, look on\r\nwith patience and see Representatives and Senators from the Red River\r\nand Missouri, pouring themselves upon this and the other floor, managing\r\nthe concerns of a seaboard fifteen hundred miles, at least, from their\r\nresidence; and having a preponderancy in councils into which,\r\nconstitutionally, they could never have been admitted?\"\r\n\r\nLike an echo from the fears expressed by the East at the close of the\r\neighteenth century come the words of an eminent Eastern man of\r\nletters[208:1] at the end of the nineteenth century, in warning against\r\nthe West: \"Materialized in their temper; with few ideals of an ennobling\r\nsort; little instructed in the lessons of history; safe from exposure to\r\nthe direct calamities and physical horrors of war; with undeveloped\r\nimaginations and sympathies--they form a community unfortunate and\r\ndangerous from the possession of power without a due sense of its\r\ncorresponding responsibilities; a community in which the passion for war\r\nmay easily be excited as the fancied means by which its greatness may be\r\nconvincingly exhibited, and its ambitions gratified. . . . Some chance\r\nspark may fire the prairie.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the problem of the West, as it looked to New England\r\nleaders of thought in the beginning and at the end of this century. From\r\nthe first, it was recognized that a new type was growing up beyond the\r\nseaboard, and that the time would come when the destiny of the nation\r\nwould be in Western hands. The divergence of these societies became\r\nclear in the struggle over the ratification of the federal constitution.\r\nThe up-country agricultural regions, the communities that were in debt\r\nand desired paper money, with some Western exceptions, opposed the\r\ninstrument; but the areas of intercourse and property carried the day.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand, therefore, what were some of the ideals\r\nof this early Western democracy. How did the frontiersman differ from\r\nthe man of the coast?\r\n\r\nThe most obvious fact regarding the man of the Western Waters is that he\r\nhad placed himself under influences destructive to many of the gains of\r\ncivilization. Remote from the opportunity for systematic education,\r\nsubstituting a log hut in the forest-clearing for the social comforts of\r\nthe town, he suffered hardships and privations, and reverted in many\r\nways to primitive conditions of life. Engaged in a struggle to subdue\r\nthe forest, working as an individual, and with little specie or\r\ncapital, his interests were with the debtor class. At each stage of its\r\nadvance, the West has favored an expansion of the currency. The pioneer\r\nhad boundless confidence in the future of his own community, and when\r\nseasons of financial contraction and depression occurred, he, who had\r\nstaked his all on confidence in Western development, and had fought the\r\nsavage for his home, was inclined to reproach the conservative sections\r\nand classes. To explain this antagonism requires more than denunciation\r\nof dishonesty, ignorance, and boorishness as fundamental Western traits.\r\nLegislation in the United States has had to deal with two distinct\r\nsocial conditions. In some portions of the country there was, and is, an\r\naggregation of property, and vested rights are in the foreground: in\r\nothers, capital is lacking, more primitive conditions prevail, with\r\ndifferent economic and social ideals, and the contentment of the average\r\nindividual is placed in the foreground. That in the conflict between\r\nthese two ideals an even hand has always been held by the government\r\nwould be difficult to show.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the Western man from the seaboard, and his\r\nenvironment, made him in a large degree free from European precedents\r\nand forces. He looked at things independently and with small regard or\r\nappreciation for the best Old World experience. He had no ideal of a\r\nphilosophical, eclectic nation, that should advance civilization by\r\n\"intercourse with foreigners and familiarity with their point of view,\r\nand readiness to adopt whatever is best and most suitable in their\r\nideas, manners, and customs.\" His was rather the ideal of conserving and\r\ndeveloping what was original and valuable in this new country. The\r\nentrance of old society upon free lands meant to him opportunity for a\r\nnew type of democracy and new popular ideals. The West was not\r\nconservative: buoyant self-confidence and self-assertion were\r\ndistinguishing traits in its composition. It saw in its growth nothing\r\nless than a new order of society and state. In this conception were\r\nelements of evil and elements of good.\r\n\r\nBut the fundamental fact in regard to this new society was its relation\r\nto land. Professor Boutmy has said of the United States, \"Their one\r\nprimary and predominant object is to cultivate and settle these\r\nprairies, forests, and vast waste lands. The striking and peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of American society is that it is not so much a democracy\r\nas a huge commercial company for the discovery, cultivation, and\r\ncapitalization of its enormous territory. The United States are\r\nprimarily a commercial society, and only secondarily a nation.\" Of\r\ncourse, this involves a serious misapprehension. By the very fact of the\r\ntask here set forth, far-reaching ideals of the state and of society\r\nhave been evolved in the West, accompanied by loyalty to the nation\r\nrepresentative of these ideals. But M. Boutmy's description hits the\r\nsubstantial fact, that the fundamental traits of the man of the interior\r\nwere due to the free lands of the West. These turned his attention to\r\nthe great task of subduing them to the purposes of civilization, and to\r\nthe task of advancing his economic and social status in the new\r\ndemocracy which he was helping to create. Art, literature, refinement,\r\nscientific administration, all had to give way to this Titanic labor.\r\nEnergy, incessant activity, became the lot of this new American. Says a\r\ntraveler of the time of Andrew Jackson, \"America is like a vast\r\nworkshop, over the door of which is printed in blazing characters, 'No\r\nadmittance here, except on business.'\" The West of our own day reminds\r\nMr. Bryce \"of the crowd which Vathek found in the hall of Eblis, each\r\ndarting hither and thither with swift steps and unquiet mien, driven to\r\nand fro by a fire in the heart. Time seems too short for what they have\r\nto do, and the result always to come short of their desire.\"\r\n\r\nBut free lands and the consciousness of working out their social\r\ndestiny did more than turn the Westerner to material interests and\r\ndevote him to a restless existence. They promoted equality among the\r\nWestern settlers, and reacted as a check on the aristocratic influences\r\nof the East. Where everybody could have a farm, almost for taking it,\r\neconomic equality easily resulted, and this involved political equality.\r\nNot without a struggle would the Western man abandon this ideal, and it\r\ngoes far to explain the unrest in the remote West to-day.\r\n\r\nWestern democracy included individual liberty, as well as equality. The\r\nfrontiersman was impatient of restraints. He knew how to preserve order,\r\neven in the absence of legal authority. If there were cattle thieves,\r\nlynch law was sudden and effective: the regulators of the Carolinas were\r\nthe predecessors of the claims associations of Iowa and the vigilance\r\ncommittees of California. But the individual was not ready to submit to\r\ncomplex regulations. Population was sparse, there was no multitude of\r\njostling interests, as in older settlements, demanding an elaborate\r\nsystem of personal restraints. Society became atomic. There was a\r\nreproduction of the primitive idea of the personality of the law, a\r\ncrime was more an offense against the victim than a violation of the law\r\nof the land. Substantial justice, secured in the most direct way, was\r\nthe ideal of the backwoodsman. He had little patience with finely drawn\r\ndistinctions or scruples of method. If the thing was one proper to be\r\ndone, then the most immediate, rough and ready, effective way was the\r\nbest way.\r\n\r\nIt followed from the lack of organized political life, from the atomic\r\nconditions of the backwoods society, that the individual was exalted and\r\ngiven free play. The West was another name for opportunity. Here were\r\nmines to be seized, fertile valleys to be preëmpted, all the natural\r\nresources open to the shrewdest and the boldest. The United States is\r\nunique in the extent to which the individual has been given an open\r\nfield, unchecked by restraints of an old social order, or of scientific\r\nadministration of government. The self-made man was the Western man's\r\nideal, was the kind of man that all men might become. Out of his\r\nwilderness experience, out of the freedom of his opportunities, he\r\nfashioned a formula for social regeneration,--the freedom of the\r\nindividual to seek his own. He did not consider that his conditions were\r\nexceptional and temporary.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, leadership easily develops,--a leadership based\r\non the possession of the qualities most serviceable to the young\r\nsociety. In the history of Western settlement, we see each forted\r\nvillage following its local hero. Clay, Jackson, Harrison, Lincoln, were\r\nillustrations of this tendency in periods when the Western hero rose to\r\nthe dignity of national hero.\r\n\r\nThe Western man believed in the manifest destiny of his country. On his\r\nborder, and checking his advance, were the Indian, the Spaniard, and the\r\nEnglishman. He was indignant at Eastern indifference and lack of\r\nsympathy with his view of his relations to these peoples; at the\r\nshort-sightedness of Eastern policy. The closure of the Mississippi by\r\nSpain, and the proposal to exchange our claim of freedom of navigating\r\nthe river, in return for commercial advantages to New England, nearly\r\nled to the withdrawal of the West from the Union. It was the Western\r\ndemands that brought about the purchase of Louisiana, and turned the\r\nscale in favor of declaring the War of 1812. Militant qualities were\r\nfavored by the annual expansion of the settled area in the face of\r\nhostile Indians and the stubborn wilderness. The West caught the vision\r\nof the nation's continental destiny. Henry Adams, in his History of the\r\nUnited States, makes the American of 1800 exclaim to the foreign\r\nvisitor, \"Look at my wealth! See these solid mountains of salt and\r\niron, of lead, copper, silver, and gold. See these magnificent cities\r\nscattered broadcast to the Pacific! See my cornfields rustling and\r\nwaving in the summer breeze from ocean to ocean, so far that the sun\r\nitself is not high enough to mark where the distant mountains bound my\r\ngolden seas. Look at this continent of mine, fairest of created worlds,\r\nas she lies turning up to the sun's never failing caress her broad and\r\nexuberant breasts, overflowing with milk for her hundred million\r\nchildren.\" And the foreigner saw only dreary deserts, tenanted by\r\nsparse, ague-stricken pioneers and savages. The cities were log huts and\r\ngambling dens. But the frontiersman's dream was prophetic. In spite of\r\nhis rude, gross nature, this early Western man was an idealist withal.\r\nHe dreamed dreams and beheld visions. He had faith in man, hope for\r\ndemocracy, belief in America's destiny, unbounded confidence in his\r\nability to make his dreams come true. Said Harriet Martineau in 1834, \"I\r\nregard the American people as a great embryo poet, now moody, now wild,\r\nbut bringing out results of absolute good sense: restless and wayward in\r\naction, but with deep peace at his heart; exulting that he has caught\r\nthe true aspect of things past, and the depth of futurity which lies\r\nbefore him, wherein to create something so magnificent as the world has\r\nscarcely begun to dream of. There is the strongest hope of a nation that\r\nis capable of being possessed with an idea.\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear this idealism of the West in mind. The very\r\nmaterialism that has been urged against the West was accompanied by\r\nideals of equality, of the exaltation of the common man, of national\r\nexpansion, that makes it a profound mistake to write of the West as\r\nthough it were engrossed in mere material ends. It has been, and is,\r\npreëminently a region of ideals, mistaken or not.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that these economic and social conditions were so\r\nfundamental in Western life that they might well dominate whatever\r\naccessions came to the West by immigration from the coast sections or\r\nfrom Europe. Nevertheless, the West cannot be understood without bearing\r\nin mind the fact that it has received the great streams from the North\r\nand from the South, and that the Mississippi compelled these currents to\r\nintermingle. Here it was that sectionalism first gave way under the\r\npressure of unification. Ultimately the conflicting ideas and\r\ninstitutions of the old sections struggled for dominance in this area\r\nunder the influence of the forces that made for uniformity, but this is\r\nmerely another phase of the truth that the West must become unified,\r\nthat it could not rest in sectional groupings. For precisely this reason\r\nthe struggle occurred. In the period from the Revolution to the close of\r\nthe War of 1812, the democracy of the Southern and Middle States\r\ncontributed the main streams of settlement and social influence to the\r\nWest. Even in Ohio political power was soon lost by the New England\r\nleaders. The democratic spirit of the Middle region left an indelible\r\nimpress on the West in this its formative period. After the War of 1812,\r\nNew England, its supremacy in the carrying trade of the world having\r\nvanished, became a hive from which swarms of settlers went out to\r\nwestern New York and the remoter regions.\r\n\r\nThese settlers spread New England ideals of education and character and\r\npolitical institutions, and acted as a leaven of great significance in\r\nthe Northwest. But it would be a mistake to believe that an unmixed New\r\nEngland influence took possession of the Northwest. These pioneers did\r\nnot come from the class that conserved the type of New England\r\ncivilization pure and undefiled. They represented a less contented, less\r\nconservative influence. Moreover, by their sojourn in the Middle Region,\r\non their westward march, they underwent modification, and when the\r\nfarther West received them, they suffered a forest-change, indeed. The\r\nWesternized New England man was no longer the representative of the\r\nsection that he left. He was less conservative, less provincial, more\r\nadaptable and approachable, less rigorous in his Puritan ideals, less a\r\nman of culture, more a man of action.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, therefore, the Western men, in the \"era of\r\ngood feeling,\" had much homogeneity throughout the Mississippi Valley,\r\nand began to stand as a new national type. Under the lead of Henry Clay\r\nthey invoked the national government to break down the mountain barrier\r\nby internal improvements, and thus to give their crops an outlet to the\r\ncoast. Under him they appealed to the national government for a\r\nprotective tariff to create a home market. A group of frontier States\r\nentered the Union with democratic provisions respecting the suffrage,\r\nand with devotion to the nation that had given them their lands, built\r\ntheir roads and canals, regulated their territorial life, and made them\r\nequals in the sisterhood of States. At last these Western forces of\r\naggressive nationalism and democracy took possession of the government\r\nin the person of the man who best embodied them, Andrew Jackson. This\r\nnew democracy that captured the country and destroyed the ideals of\r\nstatesmanship came from no theorist's dreams of the German forest. It\r\ncame, stark and strong and full of life, from the American forest. But\r\nthe triumph of this Western democracy revealed also the fact that it\r\ncould rally to its aid the laboring classes of the coast, then just\r\nbeginning to acquire self-consciousness and organization.\r\n\r\nThe next phase of Western development revealed forces of division\r\nbetween the northern and southern portions of the West. With the spread\r\nof the cotton culture went the slave system and the great plantation.\r\nThe small farmer in his log cabin, raising varied crops, was displaced\r\nby the planter raising cotton. In all except the mountainous areas the\r\nindustrial organization of the tidewater took possession of the\r\nSouthwest, the unity of the back country was broken, and the solid South\r\nwas formed. In the Northwest this was the era of railroads and canals,\r\nopening the region to the increasing stream of Middle State and New\r\nEngland settlement, and strengthening the opposition to slavery. A map\r\nshowing the location of the men of New England ancestry in the Northwest\r\nwould represent also the counties in which the Free Soil party cast its\r\nheaviest votes. The commercial connections of the Northwest likewise\r\nwere reversed by the railroad. The result is stated by a writer in _De\r\nBow's Review_ in 1852 in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"What is New Orleans now? Where are her dreams of greatness\r\n     and glory? . . . Whilst she slept, an enemy has sowed tares in\r\n     her most prolific fields. Armed with energy, enterprise, and\r\n     an indomitable spirit, that enemy, by a system of bold,\r\n     vigorous, and sustained efforts, has succeeded in reversing\r\n     the very laws of nature and of nature's God,--rolled back the\r\n     mighty tide of the Mississippi and its thousand tributary\r\n     streams, until their mouth, practically and commercially, is\r\n     more at New York or Boston than at New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nThe West broke asunder, and the great struggle over the social system to\r\nbe given to the lands beyond the Mississippi followed. In the Civil War\r\nthe Northwest furnished the national hero,--Lincoln was the very flower\r\nof frontier training and ideals,--and it also took into its hands the\r\nwhole power of the government. Before the war closed, the West could\r\nclaim the President, Vice-President, Chief Justice, Speaker of the\r\nHouse, Secretary of the Treasury, Postmaster-General, Attorney-General,\r\nGeneral of the army, and Admiral of the navy. The leading generals of\r\nthe war had been furnished by the West. It was the region of action,\r\nand in the crisis it took the reins.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the nation was followed by a new era of Western\r\ndevelopment. The national forces projected themselves across the\r\nprairies and plains. Railroads, fostered by government loans and land\r\ngrants, opened the way for settlement and poured a flood of European\r\nimmigrants and restless pioneers from all sections of the Union into the\r\ngovernment lands. The army of the United States pushed back the Indian,\r\nrectangular Territories were carved into checkerboard States, creations\r\nof the federal government, without a history, without physiographical\r\nunity, without particularistic ideas. The later frontiersman leaned on\r\nthe strong arm of national power.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the South underwent a revolution. The plantation, based\r\non slavery, gave place to the farm, the gentry to the democratic\r\nelements. As in the West, new industries, of mining and of manufacture,\r\nsprang up as by magic. The New South, like the New West, was an area of\r\nconstruction, a debtor area, an area of unrest; and it, too, had learned\r\nthe uses to which federal legislation might be put.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Old Northwest[218:1] passed through an economic and\r\nsocial transformation. The whole West furnished an area over which\r\nsuccessive waves of economic development have passed. The State of\r\nWisconsin, now much like parts of the State of New York, was at an\r\nearlier period like the State of Nebraska of to-day; the Granger\r\nmovement and Greenback party had for a time the ascendancy; and in the\r\nnorthern counties of the State, where there is a sparser population, and\r\nthe country is being settled, its sympathies are still with the debtor\r\nclass. Thus the Old Northwest is a region where the older frontier\r\nconditions survive in parts, and where the inherited ways of looking at\r\nthings are largely to be traced to its frontier days. At the same time\r\nit is a region in many ways assimilated to the East. It understands both\r\nsections. It is not entirely content with the existing structure of\r\neconomic society in the sections where wealth has accumulated and\r\ncorporate organizations are powerful; but neither has it seemed to feel\r\nthat its interests lie in supporting the program of the prairies and the\r\nSouth. In the Fifty-third Congress it voted for the income tax, but it\r\nrejected free coinage. It is still affected by the ideal of the\r\nself-made man, rather than by the ideal of industrial nationalism. It is\r\nmore American, but less cosmopolitan than the seaboard.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to see clearly some of the factors involved in\r\nthe Western problem. For nearly three centuries the dominant fact in\r\nAmerican life has been expansion. With the settlement of the Pacific\r\ncoast and the occupation of the free lands, this movement has come to a\r\ncheck. That these energies of expansion will no longer operate would be\r\na rash prediction; and the demands for a vigorous foreign policy, for an\r\ninteroceanic canal, for a revival of our power upon the seas, and for\r\nthe extension of American influence to outlying islands and adjoining\r\ncountries, are indications that the movement will continue. The\r\nstronghold of these demands lies west of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nIn the remoter West, the restless, rushing wave of settlement has broken\r\nwith a shock against the arid plains. The free lands are gone, the\r\ncontinent is crossed, and all this push and energy is turning into\r\nchannels of agitation. Failures in one area can no longer be made good\r\nby taking up land on a new frontier; the conditions of a settled society\r\nare being reached with suddenness and with confusion. The West has been\r\nbuilt up with borrowed capital, and the question of the stability of\r\ngold, as a standard of deferred payments, is eagerly agitated by the\r\ndebtor West, profoundly dissatisfied with the industrial conditions that\r\nconfront it, and actuated by frontier directness and rigor in its\r\nremedies. For the most part, the men who built up the West beyond the\r\nMississippi, and who are now leading the agitation,[220:1] came as\r\npioneers from the old Northwest, in the days when it was just passing\r\nfrom the stage of a frontier section. For example, Senator Allen of\r\nNebraska, president of the recent national Populist Convention, and a\r\ntype of the political leaders of his section, was born in Ohio in the\r\nmiddle of the century, went in his youth to Iowa, and not long after the\r\nCivil War made his home in Nebraska. As a boy, he saw the buffalo driven\r\nout by the settlers; he saw the Indian retreat as the pioneer advanced.\r\nHis training is that of the old West, in its frontier days. And now the\r\nfrontier opportunities are gone. Discontent is demanding an extension of\r\ngovernmental activity in its behalf. In these demands, it finds itself\r\nin touch with the depressed agricultural classes and the workingmen of\r\nthe South and East. The Western problem is no longer a sectional\r\nproblem: it is a social problem on a national scale. The greater West,\r\nextending from the Alleghanies to the Pacific, cannot be regarded as a\r\nunit; it requires analysis into regions and classes. But its area, its\r\npopulation, and its material resources would give force to its assertion\r\nthat if there is a sectionalism in the country, the sectionalism is\r\nEastern. The old West, united to the new South, would produce, not a new\r\nsectionalism, but a new Americanism. It would not mean sectional\r\ndisunion, as some have speculated, but it might mean a drastic assertion\r\nof national government and imperial expansion under a popular hero.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the real situation: a people composed of heterogeneous\r\nmaterials, with diverse and conflicting ideals and social interests,\r\nhaving passed from the task of filling up the vacant spaces of the\r\ncontinent, is now thrown back upon itself, and is seeking an\r\nequilibrium. The diverse elements are being fused into national unity.\r\nThe forces of reorganization are turbulent and the nation seems like a\r\nwitches' kettle.\r\n\r\nBut the West has its own centers of industrial life and culture not\r\nunlike those of the East. It has State universities, rivaling in\r\nconservative and scientific economic instruction those of any other part\r\nof the Union, and its citizens more often visit the East, than do\r\nEastern men the West. As time goes on, its industrial development will\r\nbring it more into harmony with the East.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Old Northwest holds the balance of power, and is the\r\nbattlefield on which these issues of American development are to be\r\nsettled. It has more in common with all parts of the nation than has any\r\nother region. It understands the East, as the East does not understand\r\nthe West. The White City which recently rose on the shores of Lake\r\nMichigan fitly typified its growing culture as well as its capacity for\r\ngreat achievement. Its complex and representative industrial\r\norganization and business ties, its determination to hold fast to what\r\nis original and good in its Western experience, and its readiness to\r\nlearn and receive the results of the experience of other sections and\r\nnations, make it an open-minded and safe arbiter of the American\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nIn the long run the \"Center of the Republic\" may be trusted to strike a\r\nwise balance between the contending ideals. But she does not deceive\r\nherself; she knows that the problem of the West means nothing less than\r\nthe problem of working out original social ideals and social adjustments\r\nfor the American nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205:1] _Atlantic Monthly_, September, 1896.

The New\r\nNorthwest fronts the watery labyrinth of Puget Sound and awaits its\r\ndestiny upon the Pacific. The Old Northwest, the historic Northwest\r\nTerritory, is now the new Middle Region of the United States. A century\r\nago it was a wilderness, broken only by a few French settlements and the\r\nstraggling American hamlets along the Ohio and its tributaries, while,\r\non the shore of Lake Erie, Moses Cleaveland had just led a handful of\r\nmen to the Connecticut Reserve. To-day it is the keystone of the\r\nAmerican Commonwealth. Since 1860 the center of population of the United\r\nStates has rested within its limits, and the center of manufacturing in\r\nthe nation lies eight miles from President McKinley's Ohio home. Of the\r\nseven men who have been elected to the presidency of the United States\r\nsince 1860, six have come from the Old Northwest, and the seventh came\r\nfrom the kindred region of western New York. The congressional\r\nRepresentatives from these five States of the Old Northwest already\r\noutnumber those from the old Middle States, and are three times as\r\nnumerous as those from New England.\r\n\r\nThe elements that have contributed to the civilization of this region\r\nare therefore well worth consideration. To know the States that make up\r\nthe Old Northwest--Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin--one\r\nmust understand their social origins.\r\n\r\nEldest in this sisterhood was Ohio. New England gave the formative\r\nimpulses to this State by the part which the Ohio Company played in\r\nsecuring the Ordinance of 1787, and at Marietta and Cleveland\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut planted enduring centers of Puritan\r\ninfluence. During the same period New Jersey and Pennsylvania sent their\r\ncolonists to the Symmes Purchase, in which Cincinnati was the\r\nrallying-point, while Virginians sought the Military Bounty Lands in the\r\nregion of Chillicothe. The Middle States and the South, with their\r\ndemocratic ideas, constituted the dominant element in Ohio politics in\r\nthe early part of her history. This dominance is shown by the nativity\r\nof the members of the Ohio legislature elected in 1820: New England\r\nfurnished nine Senators and sixteen Representatives, chiefly from\r\nConnecticut; New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, seventeen Senators\r\nand twenty-one Representatives, mostly from Pennsylvania; while the\r\nSouth furnished nine Senators and twenty-seven Representatives, of whom\r\nthe majority came from Virginia. Five of the Representatives were native\r\nof Ireland, presumably Scotch-Irishmen. In the Ohio Senate, therefore,\r\nthe Middle States had as many representatives as had New England and the\r\nSouth together, while the Southern men slightly outnumbered the Middle\r\nStates men in the Assembly. Together, the emigrants from the Democratic\r\nSouth and Middle Region outnumbered the Federalist New Englanders three\r\nto one. Although Ohio is popularly considered a child of New England, it\r\nis clear that in these formative years of her statehood the commonwealth\r\nwas dominated by other forces.\r\n\r\nBy the close of this early period, in 1820, the settlement in Ohio had\r\ncovered more or less fully all except the northwest corner of the State,\r\nand Indiana's formative period was well started. Here, as in Ohio,\r\nthere was a large Southern element. But while the Southern stream that\r\nflowed into Ohio had its sources in Virginia, the main current that\r\nsought Indiana came from North Carolina; and these settlers were for the\r\nmost part from the humbler classes. In the settlement of Indiana from\r\nthe South two separate elements are distinguishable: the Quaker\r\nmigration from North Carolina, moving chiefly because of anti-slavery\r\nconvictions; the \"poor white\" stream, made up in part of restless\r\nhunters and thriftless pioneers moving without definite ambitions, and\r\nin part of other classes, such as former overseers, migrating to the new\r\ncountry with definite purpose of improving their fortunes.\r\n\r\nThese elements constituted well-marked features in the Southern\r\ncontribution to Indiana, and they explain why she has been named the\r\nHoosier State; but it should by no means be thought that all of the\r\nSouthern immigrants came under these classes, nor that these have been\r\nthe normal elements in the development of the Indiana of to-day. In the\r\nNorthwest, where interstate migration has been so continuous and\r\nwidespread, the lack of typical State peculiarities is obvious, and the\r\nstudent of society, like the traveler, is tempted, in his effort to\r\ndistinguish the community from its neighbors, to exaggerate the odd and\r\nexceptional elements which give a particular flavor to the State.\r\nIndiana has suffered somewhat from this tendency; but it is undoubted\r\nthat these peculiarities of origin left deep and abiding influences upon\r\nthe State. In 1820 her settlement was chiefly in the southern counties,\r\nwhere Southern and Middle States influence was dominant. Her two United\r\nStates Senators were Virginians by birth, while her Representative was\r\nfrom Pennsylvania. The Southern element continued so powerful that one\r\nstudent of Indiana origins has estimated that in 1850 one-third of the\r\npopulation of the State were native Carolinians and their children in\r\nthe first generation. Not until a few years before the Civil War did the\r\nNorthern current exert a decisive influence upon Indiana. She had no\r\nsuch lake ports as had her sister States, and extension of settlement\r\ninto the State from ports like Chicago was interrupted by the less\r\nattractive area of the northwestern part of Indiana. Add to this the\r\ngeological fact that the limestone ridges and the best soils ran in\r\nnearly perpendicular belts northward from the Ohio, and it will be seen\r\nhow circumstances combined to diminish Northern and to facilitate\r\nSouthern influences in the State prior to the railroad development.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois, also, the current of migration was at first preponderantly\r\nSouthern, but the settlers were less often from the Atlantic coast.\r\nKentucky and Tennessee were generous contributors, but many of the\r\ndistinguished leaders came from Virginia, and it is worthy of note that\r\nin 1820 the two United States Senators of Illinois were of Maryland\r\nancestry, while her Representative was of Kentucky origin. The swarms of\r\nland-seekers between 1820 and 1830 ascended the Illinois river, and\r\nspread out between that river and the Mississippi. It was in this period\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln's father, who had come from Kentucky to Indiana,\r\nagain left his log cabin and traveled by ox-team with his family to the\r\npopular Illinois county of Sangamon. Here Lincoln split his famous rails\r\nto fence their land, and grew up under the influences of this migration\r\nof the Southern pioneers to the prairies. They were not predominantly of\r\nthe planter class; but the fierce contest in 1824 over the proposition\r\nto open Illinois to slavery was won for freedom by a narrow majority.\r\n\r\nLooking at the three States, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, prior to 1850,\r\nwe perceive how important was the voice of the South here, and we can\r\nthe more easily understand the early affiliation of the Northwest with\r\nher sister States to the south on the Western waters. It was not\r\nwithout reason that the proposal of the Missouri Compromise came from\r\nIllinois, and it was a natural enthusiasm with which these States\r\nfollowed Henry Clay in the war policy of 1812. The combination of the\r\nSouth, the western portion of the Middle States, and the Mississippi\r\nValley gave the ascendancy to the democratic ideals of the followers of\r\nJefferson, and left New England a weakened and isolated section for\r\nnearly half a century. Many of the most characteristic elements in\r\nAmerican life in the first part of the century were due to this\r\nrelationship between the South and the trans-Alleghany region. But even\r\nthus early the Northwest had revealed strong predilections for the\r\nNorthern economic ideals as against the peculiar institution of the\r\nSouth, and this tendency grew with the increase of New England\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nThe northern two in this sisterhood of Northwestern States were the\r\nfirst to be entered by the French, but latest by the English settlers.\r\nWhy Michigan was not occupied by New York men at an earlier period is at\r\nfirst sight not easy to understand. Perhaps the adverse reports of\r\nsurveyors who visited the interior of the State, the partial\r\ngeographical isolation, and the unprogressive character of the French\r\nsettlers account for the tardy occupation of the area. Certain it is\r\nthat while the southern tier of States was sought by swarms of settlers,\r\nWisconsin and Michigan still echoed to Canadian boating-songs, and\r\nvoyageurs paddled their birch canoes along the streams of the wilderness\r\nto traffic with the savages. Great Britain maintained the dominant\r\nposition until after the War of 1812, and the real center of authority\r\nwas in Canada.\r\n\r\nBut after the digging of the Erie Canal, settlement began to turn into\r\nMichigan. Between 1830 and 1840 the population of the State leaped from\r\n31,000 to 212,000, in the face of the fact that the heavy debt of the\r\nState and the crisis of 1837 turned from her borders many of the\r\nthrifty, debt-hating Germans. The vast majority of the settlers were New\r\nYorkers. Michigan is distinctly a child of the Empire State. Canadians,\r\nboth French and English, continued to come as the lumber interests of\r\nthe region increased. By 1850 Michigan contained nearly 400,000\r\ninhabitants, who occupied the southern half of the State.\r\n\r\nBut she now found an active competitor for settlement in Wisconsin. In\r\nthis region two forces had attracted the earlier inhabitants. The\r\nfur-trading posts of Green Bay, Prairie du Chien, and Milwaukee\r\nconstituted one element, in which the French influence was continued.\r\nThe lead region of the southwest corner of the State formed the center\r\nof attraction for Illinois and Southern pioneers. The soldiers who\r\nfollowed Black Hawk's trail in 1832 reported the richness of the soil,\r\nand an era of immigration followed. To the port of Milwaukee came a\r\ncombined migration from western New York and New England, and spread\r\nalong the southern tier of prairie counties until it met the Southern\r\nsettlers in the lead region. Many of the early political contests in the\r\nState were connected, as in Ohio and Illinois, with the antagonisms\r\nbetween the sections thus brought together in a limited area.\r\n\r\nThe other element in the formation of Wisconsin was that of the Germans,\r\nthen just entering upon their vast immigration to the United States.\r\nWisconsin was free from debt; she made a constitution of exceptional\r\nliberality to foreigners, and instead of treasuring her school lands or\r\nusing them for internal improvements, she sold them for almost nothing\r\nto attract immigration. The result was that the prudent Germans, who\r\nloved light taxes and cheap hard wood lands, turned toward\r\nWisconsin,--another _Völkerwanderung_. From Milwaukee as a center they\r\nspread north along the shore of Lake Michigan, and later into northern\r\ncentral Wisconsin, following the belt of the hardwood forests. So\r\nconsiderable were their numbers that such an economist as Roscher wrote\r\nof the feasibility of making Wisconsin a German State. \"They can plant\r\nthe vine on the hills,\" cried Franz Löher in 1847, \"and drink with happy\r\nsong and dance; they can have German schools and universities, German\r\nliterature and art, German science and philosophy, German courts and\r\nassemblies; in short, they can form a German State, in which the German\r\nlanguage shall be as much the popular and official language as the\r\nEnglish is now, and in which the German spirit shall rule.\" By 1860 the\r\nGerman-born were sixteen per cent of the population of the State. But\r\nthe New York and New England stream proved even more broad and steady in\r\nits flow in these years before the war. Wisconsin's population rose from\r\n30,000 in 1840 to 300,000 in 1850.\r\n\r\nThe New England element that entered this State is probably typical of\r\nthe same element in Wisconsin's neighboring States, and demands notice.\r\nIt came for the most part, not from the seaboard of Massachusetts, which\r\nhas so frequently represented New England to the popular apprehension. A\r\nlarge element in this stock was the product of the migration that\r\nascended the valleys of Connecticut and central Massachusetts through\r\nthe hills into Vermont and New York,--a pioneer folk almost from the\r\ntime of their origin. The Vermont colonists decidedly outnumbered those\r\nof Massachusetts in both Michigan and Wisconsin, and were far more\r\nnumerous in other Northwestern States than the population of Vermont\r\nwarranted. Together with this current came the settlers from western New\r\nYork. These were generally descendants of this same pioneer New England\r\nstock, continuing into a remoter West the movement that had brought\r\ntheir parents to New York. The combined current from New England and New\r\nYork thus constituted a distinctly modified New England stock, and was\r\nclearly the dominant native element in Michigan and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe decade of the forties was also the period of Iowa's rapid increase.\r\nAlthough not politically a part of the Old Northwest, in history she is\r\nclosely related to that region. Her growth was by no means so rapid as\r\nwas Wisconsin's, for the proportion of foreign immigration was less.\r\nWhereas in 1850 more than one-third of Wisconsin's population was\r\nforeign-born, the proportion for Iowa was not much over one-tenth. The\r\nmain body of her people finally came from the Middle States, and\r\nIllinois and Ohio; but Southern elements were well represented,\r\nparticularly among her political leaders.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the century was the turning-point in the transfer of\r\ncontrol in the Northwest. Below the line of the old national turnpike,\r\nmarked by the cities of Columbus, Indianapolis, Vandalia, and St. Louis,\r\nthe counties had acquired a stability of settlement; and partly because\r\nof the Southern element, partly because of a natural tendency of new\r\ncommunities toward Jacksonian ideals, these counties were preponderantly\r\nDemocratic. But the Southern migration had turned to the cotton areas of\r\nthe Southwest, and the development of railroads and canals had broken\r\nthe historic commercial ascendancy of the Mississippi River; New Orleans\r\nwas yielding the scepter to New York. The tide of migration from the\r\nNorth poured along these newly opened channels, and occupied the less\r\nsettled counties above the national turnpike. In cities like Columbus\r\nand Indianapolis, where the two currents had run side by side, the\r\ncombined elements were most clearly marked, but in the Northwest as a\r\nwhole a varied population had been formed. This region seemed to\r\nrepresent and understand the various parts of the Union. It was this\r\naspect which Mr. Vinton, of Ohio, urged in Congress when he made his\r\nnotable speech in favor of the admission of Iowa. He pleaded the\r\nmission of the Northwest as the mediator between the sections and the\r\nunifying agency in the nation, with such power and pathos as to thrill\r\neven John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nBut there are some issues which cannot be settled by compromise,\r\ntendencies one of which must conquer the other. Such an issue the slave\r\npower raised, and raised too late for support in the upper half of the\r\nMississippi Basin. The Northern and the Southern elements found\r\nthemselves in opposition to each other. \"A house divided against itself\r\ncannot stand,\" said Abraham Lincoln, a Northern leader of Southern\r\norigin. Douglas, a leader of the Southern forces, though coming from New\r\nEngland, declared his indifference whether slavery were voted up or down\r\nin the Western Territories. The historic debates between these two\r\nchampions reveal the complex conditions in the Northwest, and take on a\r\nnew meaning when considered in the light of this contest between the\r\nNorthern and the Southern elements. The State that had been so potent\r\nfor compromise was at last the battle-ground itself, and the places\r\nselected for the various debates of Lincoln and Douglas marked the\r\nstrongholds and the outposts of the antagonistic forces.\r\n\r\nAt this time the kinship of western New York and the dominant element in\r\nthe Northwest was clearly revealed. Speaking for the anti-slavery forces\r\nat Madison, Wisconsin, in 1860, Seward said: \"The Northwest is by no\r\nmeans so small as you may think it. I speak to you because I feel that I\r\nam, and during all my mature life have been, one of you. Although of New\r\nYork, I am still a citizen of the Northwest. The Northwest extends\r\neastward to the base of the Alleghany Mountains, and does not all of\r\nwestern New York lie westward of the Alleghany Mountains? Whence comes\r\nall the inspiration of free soil which spreads itself with such cheerful\r\nvoices over all these plains? Why, from New York westward of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains. The people before me,--who are you but New York\r\nmen, while you are men of the Northwest?\" In the Civil War, western New\r\nYork and the Northwest were powerful in the forum and in the field. A\r\nmillion soldiers came from the States that the Ordinance, passed by\r\nSouthern votes, had devoted to freedom.\r\n\r\nThis was the first grave time of trial for the Northwest, and it did\r\nmuch eventually to give to the region a homogeneity and\r\nself-consciousness. But at the close of the war the region was still\r\nagricultural, only half-developed; still breaking ground in northern\r\nforests; still receiving contributions of peoples which radically\r\nmodified the social organism, and undergoing economic changes almost\r\nrevolutionary in their rapidity and extent. The changes since the war\r\nare of more social importance, in many respects, than those in the years\r\ncommonly referred to as the formative period. As a result, the Northwest\r\nfinds herself again between contending forces, sharing the interests of\r\nEast and West, as once before those of North and South, and forced to\r\ngive her voice on issues of equal significance for the destiny of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nIn these transforming years since 1860, Ohio, finding the magician's\r\ntalisman that revealed the treasury of mineral wealth, gas, and\r\npetroleum beneath her fields, has leaped to a front rank among the\r\nmanufacturing States of the Union. Potential on the Great Lakes by\r\nreason of her ports of Toledo and Cleveland, tapping the Ohio river\r\nartery of trade at Cincinnati, and closely connected with all the vast\r\nmaterial development of the upper waters of this river in western\r\nPennsylvania and West Virginia, Ohio has become distinctly a part of the\r\neastern social organism, much like the State of Pennsylvania. The\r\ncomplexity of her origin still persists. Ohio has no preponderant social\r\ncenter; her multiplicity of colleges and universities bears tribute to\r\nthe diversity of the elements that have made the State. One-third of\r\nher people are of foreign parentage (one or both parents foreign-born),\r\nand the city of Cincinnati has been deeply affected by the German stock,\r\nwhile Cleveland strongly reflects the influence of the New England\r\nelement. That influence is still very palpable, but it is New England in\r\nthe presence of natural gas, iron, and coal, New England shaped by blast\r\nand forge. The Middle State ideals will dominate Ohio's future.\r\n\r\nBucolic Indiana, too, within the last decade has come into the\r\npossession of gas-fields and has increased the exploitation of her coals\r\nuntil she seems destined to share in the industrial type represented by\r\nOhio. Cities have arisen, like a dream, on the sites of country\r\nvillages. But Indiana has a much smaller proportion of foreign elements\r\nthan any other State of the Old Northwest, and it is the Southern\r\nelement that still differentiates her from her sisters. While Ohio's\r\npolitical leaders still attest the Puritan migration, Indiana's clasp\r\nhands with the leaders from the South.\r\n\r\nThe Southern elements continue also to reveal themselves in the\r\nDemocratic southwestern counties of Illinois, grouped like a broad delta\r\nof the Illinois River, while northern Illinois holds a larger proportion\r\nof descendants of the Middle States and New England. About one-half her\r\npopulation is of foreign parentage, in which the German, Irish, and\r\nScandinavians furnish the largest elements. She is a great agricultural\r\nState and a great manufacturing State, the connecting link between the\r\nMississippi and the Great Lakes. Her metropolis, Chicago, is the very\r\ntype of Northwestern development for good and for evil. It is an epitome\r\nof her composite nationality. A recent writer, analyzing the school\r\ncensus of Chicago, points out that \"only two cities in the German\r\nEmpire, Berlin and Hamburg, have a greater German population than\r\nChicago; only two in Sweden, Stockholm and Göteborg, have more Swedes;\r\nand only two in Norway, Christiana and Bergen, have more Norwegians\";\r\nwhile the Irish, Polish, Bohemians, and Dutch elements are also largely\r\nrepresented. But in spite of her rapidity of growth and her complex\r\nelements, Chicago stands as the representative of the will-power and\r\ngenius for action of the Middle West, and the State of Illinois will be\r\nthe battle-ground for social and economic ideals for the next\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nMichigan is two States. The northern peninsula is cut off from the\r\nsouthern physically, industrially, and in the history of settlement. It\r\nwould seem that her natural destiny was with Wisconsin, or some possible\r\nnew State embracing the iron and copper, forest and shipping areas of\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota on Lake Superior. The lower peninsula\r\nof Michigan is the daughter of New York and over twelve per cent of\r\nMichigan's present population were born in that State, and her traits\r\nare those of the parent State. Over half her population is of foreign\r\nparentage, of which Canada and England together have furnished one-half,\r\nwhile the Germans outnumber any other single foreign element. The State\r\nhas undergone a steady industrial development, exploiting her northern\r\nmines and forests, developing her lumber interests with Saginaw as the\r\ncenter, raising fruits along the lake shore counties, and producing\r\ngrain in the middle trough of counties running from Saginaw Bay to the\r\nsouth of Lake Michigan. Her state university has been her peculiar\r\nglory, furnishing the first model for the state university, and it is\r\nthe educational contribution of the Northwest to the nation.\r\n\r\nWisconsin's future is dependent upon the influence of the large\r\nproportion of her population of foreign parentage, for nearly\r\nthree-fourths of her inhabitants are of that class. She thus has a\r\nsmaller percentage of native population than any other of the States\r\nformed from the Old Northwest. Of this foreign element the Germans\r\nconstitute by far the largest part, with the Scandinavians second. Her\r\nAmerican population born outside of Wisconsin comes chiefly from New\r\nYork. In contrast with the Ohio River States, she lacks the Southern\r\nelement. Her greater foreign population and her dairy interests contrast\r\nwith Michigan's Canadian and English elements and fruit culture. Her\r\nrelations are more Western than Michigan's by reason of her connection\r\nwith the Mississippi and the prairie States. Her foreign element is\r\nslightly less than Minnesota's, and in the latter State the\r\nScandinavians take the place held by the Germans in Wisconsin. The\r\nfacility with which the Scandinavians catch the spirit of Western\r\nAmerica and assimilate with their neighbors is much greater than is the\r\ncase with the Germans, so that Wisconsin seems to offer opportunity for\r\nnon-English influence in a greater degree than her sister on the west.\r\nWhile Minnesota's economic development has heretofore been closely\r\ndependent on the wheat-producing prairies, the opening of the iron\r\nfields of the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, together with the development\r\nof St. Paul and Minneapolis, Duluth and West Superior, and the\r\nprospective achievement of a deep-water communication with the Atlantic,\r\nseem to offer to that State a new and imperial industrial destiny.\r\nBetween this stupendous economic future to the northwest and the\r\ncolossal growth of Chicago on the southeast Wisconsin seems likely to\r\nbecome a middle agricultural area, developing particularly into a dairy\r\nState. She is powerfully affected by the conservative tendencies of her\r\nGerman element in times of political agitation and of proposals of\r\nsocial change.\r\n\r\nSome of the social modifications in this State are more or less typical\r\nof important processes at work among the neighboring States of the Old\r\nNorthwest. In the north, the men who built up the lumber interests of\r\nthe State, who founded a mill town surrounded by the stumps of the pine\r\nforests which they exploited for the prairie markets, have acquired\r\nwealth and political power. The spacious and well-appointed home of the\r\ntown-builder may now be seen in many a northern community, in a group of\r\nless pretentious homes of operatives and tradesmen, the social\r\ndistinctions between them emphasized by the difference in nationality. A\r\nfew years before, this captain of industry was perhaps actively engaged\r\nin the task of seeking the best \"forties\" or directing the operations of\r\nhis log-drivers. His wife and daughters make extensive visits to Europe,\r\nhis sons go to some university, and he himself is likely to acquire\r\npolitical position, or to devote his energies to saving the town from\r\nindustrial decline, as the timber is cut away, by transforming it into a\r\nmanufacturing center for more finished products. Still others continue\r\ntheir activity among the forests of the South. This social history of\r\nthe timber areas of Wisconsin has left clear indications in the\r\ndevelopment of the peculiar political leadership in the northern portion\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nIn the southern and middle counties of the State, the original\r\nsettlement of the native American pioneer farmer, a tendency is showing\r\nitself to divide the farms and to sell to thrifty Germans, or to\r\ncultivate the soil by tenants, while the farmer retires to live in the\r\nneighboring village, and perhaps to organize creameries and develop a\r\ndairy business. The result is that a replacement of nationalities is in\r\nprogress. Townships and even counties once dominated by the native\r\nAmerican farmers of New York extraction are now possessed by Germans or\r\nother European nationalities. Large portions of the retail trades of the\r\ntowns are also passing into German hands, while the native element seeks\r\nthe cities, the professions, or mercantile enterprises of larger\r\ncharacter. The non-native element shows distinct tendencies to dwell in\r\ngroups. One of the most striking illustrations of this fact is the\r\ncommunity of New Glarus, in Wisconsin, formed by a carefully organized\r\nmigration from Glarus in Switzerland, aided by the canton itself. For\r\nsome years this community was a miniature Swiss canton in social\r\norganization and customs, but of late it has become increasingly\r\nassimilated to the American type, and has left an impress by\r\ntransforming the county in which it is from a grain-raising to a dairy\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nFrom Milwaukee as a center, the influence of the Germans upon the social\r\ncustoms and ideals of Wisconsin has been marked. Milwaukee has many of\r\nthe aspects of a German city, and has furnished a stronghold of\r\nresistance to native American efforts to enact rigid temperance\r\nlegislation, laws regulative of parochial schools, and similar attempts\r\nto bend the German type to the social ideas of the pioneer American\r\nstock. In the last presidential election, the German area of the State\r\ndeserted the Democratic party, and its opposition to free silver was a\r\ndecisive factor in the overwhelming victory of the Republicans in\r\nWisconsin. With all the evidence of the persistence of the influence of\r\nthis nationality, it is nevertheless clear that each decade marks an\r\nincreased assimilation and homogeneity in the State; but the result is a\r\ncompromise, and not a conquest by either element.\r\n\r\nThe States of the Old Northwest gave to McKinley a plurality of over\r\n367,000 out of a total vote of about 3,734,000. New England and the\r\nMiddle States together gave him a plurality of 979,000 in about the same\r\nvote, while the farther West gave to Bryan a decisive net plurality. It\r\nthus appears that the Old Northwest occupied the position of a political\r\nmiddle region between East and West. The significance of this position\r\nis manifest when it is recalled that this section is the child of the\r\nEast and the mother of the Populistic West.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the Western prairies was determined by forces similar\r\nto those which settled the Old Northwest. In the decade before the war,\r\nMinnesota succeeded to the place held by Wisconsin as the Mecca of\r\nsettlers in the prior decade. To Wisconsin and New York she owes the\r\nlargest proportion of her native settlers born outside of the State.\r\nKansas and Nebraska were settled most rapidly in the decade following\r\nthe war, and had a large proportion of soldiers in their American\r\nimmigrants. Illinois and Ohio together furnished about one-third of the\r\nnative settlers of these States, but the element coming from Southern\r\nStates was stronger in Kansas than in Nebraska. Both these States have\r\nan exceptionally large proportion of native whites as compared with\r\ntheir neighbors among the prairie States. Kansas, for example, has about\r\ntwenty-six per cent of persons of foreign parentage, while Nebraska has\r\nabout forty-two, Iowa forty-three, South Dakota sixty, Wisconsin\r\nseventy-three, Minnesota seventy-five, and North Dakota seventy-nine.\r\nNorth Dakota's development was greatest in the decade prior to 1890. Her\r\nnative stock came in largest numbers from Wisconsin, with New York,\r\nMinnesota, and Iowa next in order. The growth of South Dakota occupied\r\nthe two decades prior to the census of 1890, and she has recruited her\r\nnative element from Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and New York.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the large migration from the States of the Old\r\nNorthwest to the virgin soils of these prairie States many counties in\r\nthe parent States show a considerable decline in growth in the decade\r\nbefore 1890. There is significance in the fact that, with the exception\r\nof Iowa, these prairie States, the colonies of the Old Northwest, gave\r\nBryan votes in the election of 1896 in the ratio of their proportion of\r\npersons of native parentage. North Dakota, with the heaviest foreign\r\nelement, was carried for McKinley, while South Dakota, with a much\r\nsmaller foreign vote, went for Bryan. Kansas and Nebraska rank with Ohio\r\nin their native percentage, and they were the center of prairie\r\nPopulism. Of course, there were other important local economic and\r\npolitical explanations for this ratio, but it seems to have a basis of\r\nreal meaning. Certain it is that the leaders of the silver movement came\r\nfrom the native element furnished by the Old Northwest. The original\r\nPopulists in the Kansas legislature of 1891 were born in different\r\nStates as follows: in Ohio, twelve; Indiana, six; Illinois, five; New\r\nYork, four; Pennsylvania, two; Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine, one\r\neach,--making a total, for the Northern current, of thirty-two. Of the\r\nremaining eighteen, thirteen were from the South, and one each from\r\nKansas, Missouri, California, England and Ireland. Nearly all were\r\nMethodists and former Republicans.[238:1]\r\n\r\nLooking at the silver movement more largely, we find that of the Kansas\r\ndelegation in the Fifty-fourth Congress, one was born in Kansas, and the\r\nrest in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maine.\r\nAll of the Nebraska delegation in the House came from the Old Northwest\r\nor from Iowa. The biographies of the two Representatives from the State\r\nof Washington tell an interesting story. These men came as children to\r\nthe pine woods of Wisconsin, took up public lands, and worked on the\r\nfarm and in the pineries. One passed on to a homestead in Nebraska\r\nbefore settling in Washington. Thus they kept one stage ahead of the\r\nsocial transformations of the West. This is the usual training of the\r\nWestern politicians. If the reader would see a picture of the\r\nrepresentative Kansas Populist, let him examine the family portraits of\r\nthe Ohio farmer in the middle of this century.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the Populist is the American farmer who has kept in advance\r\nof the economic and social transformations that have overtaken those\r\nwho remained behind. While, doubtless, investigation into the ancestry\r\nof the Populists and \"silver men\" who came to the prairies from the Old\r\nNorthwest would show a large proportion of Southern origin, yet the\r\ncenter of discontent seems to have been among the men of the New England\r\nand New York current. If New England looks with care at these men, she\r\nmay recognize in them the familiar lineaments of the embattled farmers\r\nwho fired the shot heard round the world. The continuous advance of this\r\npioneer stock from New England has preserved for us the older type of\r\nthe pioneer of frontier New England.\r\n\r\nI do not overlook the transforming influences of the wilderness on this\r\nstock ever since it left the earlier frontier to follow up the valleys\r\nof western Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, into western New\r\nYork, into Ohio, into Iowa, and out to the arid plains of western Kansas\r\nand Nebraska; nor do I overlook the peculiar industrial conditions of\r\nthe prairie States. But I desire to insist upon the other truth, also,\r\nthat these westward immigrants, keeping for generations in advance of\r\nthe transforming industrial and social forces that have wrought so vast\r\na revolution in the older regions of the East which they left, could not\r\nbut preserve important aspects of the older farmer type. In the arid\r\nWest these pioneers have halted and have turned to perceive an altered\r\nnation and changed social ideals. They see the sharp contrast between\r\ntheir traditional idea of America, as the land of opportunity, the land\r\nof the self-made man, free from class distinctions and from the power of\r\nwealth, and the existing America, so unlike the earlier ideal. If we\r\nfollow back the line of march of the Puritan farmer, we shall see how\r\nresponsive he has always been to _isms_, and how persistently he has\r\nresisted encroachments on his ideals of individual opportunity and\r\ndemocracy. He is the prophet of the \"higher law\" in Kansas before the\r\nCivil War. He is the Prohibitionist of Iowa and Wisconsin, crying out\r\nagainst German customs as an invasion of his traditional ideals. He is\r\nthe Granger of Wisconsin, passing restrictive railroad legislation. He\r\nis the Abolitionist, the Anti-mason, the Millerite, the Woman\r\nSuffragist, the Spiritualist, the Mormon, of Western New York. Follow\r\nhim to his New England home in the turbulent days of Shays' rebellion,\r\npaper money, stay and tender laws, and land banks. The radicals among\r\nthese New England farmers hated lawyers and capitalists. \"I would not\r\ntrust them,\" said Abraham White, in the ratification convention of\r\nMassachusetts, in 1788, \"though every one of them should be a Moses.\"\r\n\"These lawyers,\" cried Amos Singletary, \"and men of learning and moneyed\r\nmen that talk so finely and gloss over matters so smoothly to make us\r\npoor illiterate people swallow the pill, expect to get into Congress\r\nthemselves! They mean to get all the money into their hands, and then\r\nthey will swallow up all us little folk, like the Leviathan, Mr.\r\nPresident; yea, just as the whale swallowed up Jonah.\"\r\n\r\nIf the voice of Mary Ellen Lease sounds raucous to the New England man\r\nto-day, while it is sweet music in the ears of the Kansas farmer, let\r\nhim ponder the utterances of these frontier farmers in the days of the\r\nRevolution; and if he is still doubtful of this spiritual kinship, let\r\nhim read the words of the levelers and sectaries of Cromwell's army.\r\n\r\nThe story of the political leaders who remained in the place of their\r\nbirth and shared its economic changes differs from the story of those\r\nwho by moving to the West continued on a new area the old social type.\r\nIn the throng of Scotch-Irish pioneers that entered the uplands of the\r\nCarolinas in the second quarter of the eighteenth century were the\r\nancestors of Calhoun and of Andrew Jackson. Remaining in this region,\r\nCalhoun shared the transformations of the South Carolina interior. He\r\nsaw it change from the area of the pioneer farmers to an area of great\r\nplanters raising cotton by slave labor. This explains the transformation\r\nof the nationalist and protectionist Calhoun of 1816 into the\r\nstate-sovereignty and free-trade Calhoun. Jackson, on the other hand,\r\nleft the region while it was still a frontier, shared the frontier life\r\nof Tennessee, and reflected the democracy and nationalism of his people.\r\nHenry Clay lived long enough in the kindred State of Kentucky to see it\r\npass from a frontier to a settled community, and his views on slavery\r\nreflected the transitional history of that State. Lincoln, on the other\r\nhand, born in Kentucky in 1809, while the State was still under frontier\r\nconditions, migrated in 1816 to Indiana, and in 1830 to Illinois. The\r\npioneer influences of his community did much to shape his life, and the\r\ndevelopment of the raw frontiersman into the statesman was not unlike\r\nthe development of his own State. Political leaders who experienced the\r\nlater growth of the Northwest, like Garfield, Hayes, Harrison, and\r\nMcKinley, show clearly the continued transformations of the section. But\r\nin the days when the Northwest was still in the gristle, she sent her\r\nsons into the newer West to continue the views of life and the policies\r\nof the half-frontier region they had left.\r\n\r\nTo-day, the Northwest, standing between her ancestral connections in the\r\nEast and her children in the West, partly like the East, partly like the\r\nWest, finds herself in a position strangely like that in the days of the\r\nslavery struggle, when her origins presented to her a \"divided duty.\"\r\nBut these issues are not with the same imperious \"Which?\" as was the\r\nissue of freedom or slavery.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Northwest as a whole, one sees, in the character of its\r\nindustries and in the elements of its population, it is identified on\r\nthe east with the zone of States including the middle region and New\r\nEngland. Cotton culture and the negro make a clear line of division\r\nbetween the Old Northwest and the South. And yet in important historical\r\nideals--in the process of expansion, in the persistence of agricultural\r\ninterests, in impulsiveness, in imperialistic ways of looking at the\r\nAmerican destiny, in hero-worship, in the newness of its present social\r\nstructure--the Old Northwest has much in common with the South and the\r\nFar West.\r\n\r\nBehind her is the old pioneer past of simple democratic conditions, and\r\nfreedom of opportunity for all men. Before her is a superb industrial\r\ndevelopment, the brilliancy of success as evinced in a vast population,\r\naggregate wealth, and sectional power.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[222:1] _Atlantic Monthly_, April, 1897.

Ever since that era there has\r\nbeen an inclination on the part of writers on democracy to emphasize the\r\nanalytical and theoretical treatment to the neglect of the underlying\r\nfactors of historical development.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we consider the underlying conditions and forces that\r\ncreate the democratic type of government, and at times contradict the\r\nexternal forms to which the name democracy is applied, we shall find\r\nthat under this name there have appeared a multitude of political types\r\nradically unlike in fact.\r\n\r\nThe careful student of history must, therefore, seek the explanation of\r\nthe forms and changes of political institutions in the social and\r\neconomic forces that determine them. To know that at any one time a\r\nnation may be called a democracy, an aristocracy, or a monarchy, is not\r\nso important as to know what are the social and economic tendencies of\r\nthe state. These are the vital forces that work beneath the surface and\r\ndominate the external form. It is to changes in the economic and social\r\nlife of a people that we must look for the forces, that ultimately\r\ncreate and modify organs of political action.\r\n\r\nFor the time, adaptation of political structure may be incomplete or\r\nconcealed. Old organs will be utilized to express new forces, and so\r\ngradual and subtle will be the change that it may hardly be recognized.\r\nThe pseudo-democracies under the Medici at Florence and under Augustus\r\nat Rome are familiar examples of this type. Or again, if the political\r\nstructure be rigid, incapable of responding to the changes demanded by\r\ngrowth, the expansive forces of social and economic transformation may\r\nrend it in some catastrophe like that of the French Revolution. In\r\nall these changes both conscious ideals and unconscious social\r\nreorganization are at work.\r\n\r\nThese facts are familiar to the student, and yet it is doubtful if they\r\nhave been fully considered in connection with American democracy. For a\r\ncentury at least, in conventional expression, Americans have referred to\r\na \"glorious Constitution\" in explaining the stability and prosperity of\r\ntheir democracy. We have believed as a nation that other peoples had\r\nonly to will our democratic institutions in order to repeat our own\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Western contributions to democracy, it is essential that\r\nthe considerations which have just been mentioned shall be kept in mind.\r\nWhatever these contributions may have been, we find ourselves at the\r\npresent time in an era of such profound economic and social\r\ntransformation as to raise the question of the effect of these changes\r\nupon the democratic institutions of the United States. Within a decade\r\nfour marked changes have occurred in our national development; taken\r\ntogether they constitute a revolution.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the exhaustion of the supply of free land and the\r\nclosing of the movement of Western advance as an effective factor in\r\nAmerican development. The first rough conquest of the wilderness is\r\naccomplished, and that great supply of free lands which year after year\r\nhas served to reinforce the democratic influences in the United States\r\nis exhausted. It is true that vast tracts of government land are still\r\nuntaken, but they constitute the mountain and arid regions, only a small\r\nfraction of them capable of conquest, and then only by the application\r\nof capital and combined effort. The free lands that made the American\r\npioneer have gone.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, contemporaneously with this there has been such a\r\nconcentration of capital in the control of fundamental industries as to\r\nmake a new epoch in the economic development of the United States. The\r\niron, the coal, and the cattle of the country have all fallen under the\r\ndomination of a few great corporations with allied interests, and by the\r\nrapid combination of the important railroad systems and steamship lines,\r\nin concert with these same forces, even the breadstuffs and the\r\nmanufactures of the nation are to some degree controlled in a similar\r\nway. This is largely the work of the last decade. The development of the\r\ngreatest iron mines of Lake Superior occurred in the early nineties, and\r\nin the same decade came the combination by which the coal and the coke\r\nof the country, and the transportation systems that connect them with\r\nthe iron mines, have been brought under a few concentrated managements.\r\nSide by side with this concentration of capital has gone the combination\r\nof labor in the same vast industries. The one is in a certain sense the\r\nconcomitant of the other, but the movement acquires an additional\r\nsignificance because of the fact that during the past fifteen years the\r\nlabor class has been so recruited by a tide of foreign immigration that\r\nthis class is now largely made up of persons of foreign parentage, and\r\nthe lines of cleavage which begin to appear in this country between\r\ncapital and labor have been accentuated by distinctions of nationality.\r\n\r\nA third phenomenon connected with the two just mentioned is the\r\nexpansion of the United States politically and commercially into lands\r\nbeyond the seas. A cycle of American development has been completed. Up\r\nto the close of the War of 1812, this country was involved in the\r\nfortunes of the European state system. The first quarter of a century of\r\nour national existence was almost a continual struggle to prevent\r\nourselves being drawn into the European wars. At the close of that era\r\nof conflict, the United States set its face toward the West. It began\r\nthe settlement and improvement of the vast interior of the country. Here\r\nwas the field of our colonization, here the field of our political\r\nactivity. This process being completed, it is not strange that we find\r\nthe United States again involved in world-politics. The revolution that\r\noccurred four years ago, when the United States struck down that ancient\r\nnation under whose auspices the New World was discovered, is hardly yet\r\nmore than dimly understood. The insular wreckage of the Spanish War,\r\nPorto Rico and the Philippines, with the problems presented by the\r\nHawaiian Islands, Cuba, the Isthmian Canal, and China, all are\r\nindications of the new direction of the ship of state, and while we thus\r\nturn our attention overseas, our concentrated industrial strength has\r\ngiven us a striking power against the commerce of Europe that is already\r\nproducing consternation in the Old World. Having completed the conquest\r\nof the wilderness, and having consolidated our interests, we are\r\nbeginning to consider the relations of democracy and empire.\r\n\r\nAnd fourth, the political parties of the United States, now tend to\r\ndivide on issues that involve the question of Socialism. The rise of the\r\nPopulist party in the last decade, and the acceptance of so many of its\r\nprinciples by the Democratic party under the leadership of Mr. Bryan,\r\nshow in striking manner the birth of new political ideas, the\r\nreformation of the lines of political conflict.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if in any ten years of American history more significant\r\nfactors in our growth have revealed themselves. The struggle of the\r\npioneer farmers to subdue the arid lands of the Great Plains in the\r\neighties was followed by the official announcement of the extinction of\r\nthe frontier line in 1890. The dramatic outcome of the Chicago\r\nConvention of 1896 marked the rise into power of the representatives of\r\nPopulistic change. Two years later came the battle of Manila, which\r\nbroke down the old isolation of the nation, and started it on a path the\r\ngoal of which no man can foretell; and finally, but two years ago came\r\nthat concentration of which the billion and a half dollar steel trust\r\nand the union of the Northern continental railways are stupendous\r\nexamples. Is it not obvious, then, that the student who seeks for the\r\nexplanation of democracy in the social and economic forces that underlie\r\npolitical forms must make inquiry into the conditions that have produced\r\nour democratic institutions, if he would estimate the effect of these\r\nvast changes? As a contribution to this inquiry, let us now turn to an\r\nexamination of the part that the West has played in shaping our\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the settlement of America, the frontier regions\r\nhave exercised a steady influence toward democracy. In Virginia, to take\r\nan example, it can be traced as early as the period of Bacon's\r\nRebellion, a hundred years before our Declaration of Independence. The\r\nsmall landholders, seeing that their powers were steadily passing into\r\nthe hands of the wealthy planters who controlled Church and State and\r\nlands, rose in revolt. A generation later, in the governorship of\r\nAlexander Spotswood, we find a contest between the frontier settlers and\r\nthe property-holding classes of the coast. The democracy with which\r\nSpotswood had to struggle, and of which he so bitterly complained, was a\r\ndemocracy made up of small landholders, of the newer immigrants, and of\r\nindented servants, who at the expiration of their time of servitude\r\npassed into the interior to take up lands and engage in pioneer farming.\r\nThe \"War of the Regulation,\" just on the eve of the American Revolution,\r\nshows the steady persistence of this struggle between the classes of the\r\ninterior and those of the coast. The Declaration of Grievances which the\r\nback counties of the Carolinas then drew up against the aristocracy that\r\ndominated the politics of those colonies exhibits the contest between\r\nthe democracy of the frontier and the established classes who\r\napportioned the legislature in such fashion as to secure effective\r\ncontrol of government. Indeed, in a period before the outbreak of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, one can trace a distinct belt of democratic\r\nterritory extending from the back country of New England down through\r\nwestern New York, Pennsylvania, and the South.[248:1]\r\n\r\nIn each colony this region was in conflict with the dominant classes of\r\nthe coast. It constituted a quasi-revolutionary area before the days of\r\nthe Revolution, and it formed the basis on which the Democratic party\r\nwas afterwards established. It was, therefore, in the West, as it was in\r\nthe period before the Declaration of Independence, that the struggle for\r\ndemocratic development first revealed itself, and in that area the\r\nessential ideas of American democracy had already appeared. Through the\r\nperiod of the Revolution and of the Confederation a similar contest can\r\nbe noted. On the frontier of New England, along the western border of\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas, and in the communities beyond\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains, there arose a demand of the frontier settlers\r\nfor independent statehood based on democratic provisions. There is a\r\nstrain of fierceness in their energetic petitions demanding\r\nself-government under the theory that every people have the right to\r\nestablish their own political institutions in an area which they have\r\nwon from the wilderness. Those revolutionary principles based on\r\nnatural rights, for which the seaboard colonies were contending, were\r\ntaken up with frontier energy in an attempt to apply them to the lands\r\nof the West. No one can read their petitions denouncing the control\r\nexercised by the wealthy landholders of the coast, appealing to the\r\nrecord of their conquest of the wilderness, and demanding the possession\r\nof the lands for which they have fought the Indians, and which they had\r\nreduced by their ax to civilization, without recognizing in these\r\nfrontier communities the cradle of a belligerent Western democracy. \"A\r\nfool can sometimes put on his coat better than a wise man can do it for\r\nhim,\"--such is the philosophy of its petitioners. In this period also\r\ncame the contests of the interior agricultural portion of New England\r\nagainst the coast-wise merchants and property-holders, of which Shays'\r\nRebellion is the best known, although by no means an isolated instance.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the constitutional convention, this struggle for\r\ndemocracy had affected a fairly well-defined division into parties.\r\nAlthough these parties did not at first recognize their interstate\r\nconnections, there were similar issues on which they split in almost all\r\nthe States. The demands for an issue of paper money, the stay of\r\nexecution against debtors, and the relief against excessive taxation\r\nwere found in every colony in the interior agricultural regions. The\r\nrise of this significant movement wakened the apprehensions of the men\r\nof means, and in the debates over the basis of suffrage for the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the constitutional convention of 1787 leaders of the\r\nconservative party did not hesitate to demand that safeguards to the\r\nproperty should be furnished the coast against the interior. The outcome\r\nof the debate left the question of suffrage for the House of\r\nRepresentatives dependent upon the policy of the separate States. This\r\nwas in effect imposing a property qualification throughout the nation as\r\na whole, and it was only as the interior of the country developed that\r\nthese restrictions gradually gave way in the direction of manhood\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nAll of these scattered democratic tendencies Jefferson combined, in the\r\nperiod of Washington's presidency, into the Democratic-Republican party.\r\nJefferson was the first prophet of American democracy, and when we\r\nanalyse the essential features of his gospel, it is clear that the\r\nWestern influence was the dominant element. Jefferson himself was born\r\nin the frontier region of Virginia, on the edge of the Blue Ridge, in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. His father was a pioneer.\r\nJefferson's \"Notes on Virginia\" reveal clearly his conception that\r\ndemocracy should have an agricultural basis, and that manufacturing\r\ndevelopment and city life were dangerous to the purity of the body\r\npolitic. Simplicity and economy in government, the right of revolution,\r\nthe freedom of the individual, the belief that those who win the vacant\r\nlands are entitled to shape their own government in their own\r\nway,--these are all parts of the platform of political principles to\r\nwhich he gave his adhesion, and they are all elements eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the Western democracy into which he was born.\r\n\r\nIn the period of the Revolution he had brought in a series of measures\r\nwhich tended to throw the power of Virginia into the hands of the\r\nsettlers in the interior rather than of the coastwise aristocracy. The\r\nrepeal of the laws of entail and primogeniture would have destroyed the\r\ngreat estates on which the planting aristocracy based its power. The\r\nabolition of the Established Church would still further have diminished\r\nthe influence of the coastwise party in favor of the dissenting sects of\r\nthe interior. His scheme of general public education reflected the same\r\ntendency, and his demand for the abolition of slavery was characteristic\r\nof a representative of the West rather than of the old-time aristocracy\r\nof the coast. His sympathy with the Western expansion culminated in the\r\nLouisiana Purchase. In short, the tendencies of Jefferson's legislation\r\nwere to replace the dominance of the planting aristocracy by the\r\ndominance of the interior class, which had sought in vain to achieve its\r\nliberties in the period of Bacon's Rebellion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Thomas Jefferson was the John the Baptist of democracy,\r\nnot its Moses. Only with the slow setting of the tide of settlement\r\nfarther and farther toward the interior did the democratic influence\r\ngrow strong enough to take actual possession of the government. The\r\nperiod from 1800 to 1820 saw a steady increase in these tendencies. The\r\nestablished classes in New England and the South began to take alarm.\r\nPerhaps no better illustration of the apprehensions of the old-time\r\nFederal conservative can be given than these utterances of President\r\nDwight, of Yale College, in the book of travels which he published in\r\nthat period:--\r\n\r\n     The class of pioneers cannot live in regular society. They are\r\n     too idle, too talkative, too passionate, too prodigal, and too\r\n     shiftless to acquire either property or character. They are\r\n     impatient of the restraints of law, religion, and morality,\r\n     and grumble about the taxes by which the Rulers, Ministers,\r\n     and Schoolmasters are supported. . . . After exposing the\r\n     injustice of the community in neglecting to invest persons of\r\n     such superior merit in public offices, in many an eloquent\r\n     harangue uttered by many a kitchen fire, in every blacksmith\r\n     shop, in every corner of the streets, and finding all their\r\n     efforts vain, they become at length discouraged, and under the\r\n     pressure of poverty, the fear of the gaol, and consciousness\r\n     of public contempt, leave their native places and betake\r\n     themselves to the wilderness.\r\n\r\nSuch was a conservative's impression of that pioneer movement of New\r\nEngland colonists who had spread up the valley of the Connecticut into\r\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, and western New York in the period of which he\r\nwrote, and who afterwards went on to possess the Northwest. New England\r\nFederalism looked with a shudder at the democratic ideas of those who\r\nrefused to recognize the established order. But in that period there\r\ncame into the Union a sisterhood of frontier States--Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Missouri--with provisions for the franchise that brought in\r\ncomplete democracy.\r\n\r\nEven the newly created States of the Southwest showed the tendency. The\r\nwind of democracy blew so strongly from the West, that even in the older\r\nStates of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia,\r\nconventions were called, which liberalized their constitutions by\r\nstrengthening the democratic basis of the State. In the same time the\r\nlabor population of the cities began to assert its power and its\r\ndetermination to share in government. Of this frontier democracy which\r\nnow took possession of the nation, Andrew Jackson was the very\r\npersonification. He was born in the backwoods of the Carolinas in the\r\nmidst of the turbulent democracy that preceded the Revolution, and he\r\ngrew up in the frontier State of Tennessee. In the midst of this region\r\nof personal feuds and frontier ideals of law, he quickly rose to\r\nleadership. The appearance of this frontiersman on the floor of Congress\r\nwas an omen full of significance. He reached Philadelphia at the close\r\nof Washington's administration, having ridden on horseback nearly eight\r\nhundred miles to his destination. Gallatin, himself a Western man,\r\ndescribes Jackson as he entered the halls of Congress: \"A tall, lank,\r\nuncouth-looking personage, with long locks of hair hanging over his face\r\nand a cue down his back tied in an eel-skin; his dress singular; his\r\nmanners those of a rough backwoodsman.\" And Jefferson testified: \"When I\r\nwas President of the Senate he was a Senator, and he could never speak\r\non account of the rashness of his feelings. I have seen him attempt it\r\nrepeatedly and as often choke with rage.\" At last the frontier in the\r\nperson of its typical man had found a place in the Government. This\r\nsix-foot backwoodsman, with blue eyes that could blaze on occasion, this\r\ncholeric, impetuous, self-willed Scotch-Irish leader of men, this expert\r\nduelist, and ready fighter, this embodiment of the tenacious, vehement,\r\npersonal West, was in politics to stay. The frontier democracy of that\r\ntime had the instincts of the clansman in the days of Scotch border\r\nwarfare. Vehement and tenacious as the democracy was, strenuously as\r\neach man contended with his neighbor for the spoils of the new country\r\nthat opened before them, they all had respect for the man who best\r\nexpressed their aspirations and their ideas. Every community had its\r\nhero. In the War of 1812 and the subsequent Indian fighting Jackson made\r\ngood his claim, not only to the loyalty of the people of Tennessee, but\r\nof the whole West, and even of the nation. He had the essential traits\r\nof the Kentucky and Tennessee frontier. It was a frontier free from the\r\ninfluence of European ideas and institutions. The men of the \"Western\r\nWorld\" turned their backs upon the Atlantic Ocean, and with a grim\r\nenergy and self-reliance began to build up a society free from the\r\ndominance of ancient forms.\r\n\r\nThe Westerner defended himself and resented governmental restrictions.\r\nThe duel and the blood-feud found congenial soil in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee. The idea of the personality of law was often dominant over\r\nthe organized machinery of justice. That method was best which was most\r\ndirect and effective. The backwoodsman was intolerant of men who split\r\nhairs, or scrupled over the method of reaching the right. In a word, the\r\nunchecked development of the individual was the significant product of\r\nthis frontier democracy. It sought rather to express itself by choosing\r\na man of the people, than by the formation of elaborate governmental\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIt was because Andrew Jackson personified these essential Western traits\r\nthat in his presidency he became the idol and the mouthpiece of the\r\npopular will. In his assault upon the Bank as an engine of aristocracy,\r\nand in his denunciation of nullification, he went directly to his object\r\nwith the ruthless energy of a frontiersman. For formal law and the\r\nsubtleties of State sovereignty he had the contempt of a backwoodsman.\r\nNor is it without significance that this typical man of the new\r\ndemocracy will always be associated with the triumph of the spoils\r\nsystem in national politics. To the new democracy of the West, office\r\nwas an opportunity to exercise natural rights as an equal citizen of the\r\ncommunity. Rotation in office served not simply to allow the successful\r\nman to punish his enemies and reward his friends, but it also furnished\r\nthe training in the actual conduct of political affairs which every\r\nAmerican claimed as his birthright. Only in a primitive democracy of the\r\ntype of the United States in 1830 could such a system have existed\r\nwithout the ruin of the State. National government in that period was no\r\ncomplex and nicely adjusted machine, and the evils of the system were\r\nlong in making themselves fully apparent.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Andrew Jackson marked the end of the old era of trained\r\nstatesmen for the Presidency. With him began the era of the popular\r\nhero. Even Martin Van Buren, whom we think of in connection with the\r\nEast, was born in a log house under conditions that were not unlike\r\nparts of the older West. Harrison was the hero of the Northwest, as\r\nJackson had been of the Southwest. Polk was a typical Tennesseean, eager\r\nto expand the nation, and Zachary Taylor was what Webster called a\r\n\"frontier colonel.\" During the period that followed Jackson, power\r\npassed from the region of Kentucky and Tennessee to the border of the\r\nMississippi. The natural democratic tendencies that had earlier shown\r\nthemselves in the Gulf States were destroyed, however, by the spread of\r\ncotton culture, and the development of great plantations in that region.\r\nWhat had been typical of the democracy of the Revolutionary frontier and\r\nof the frontier of Andrew Jackson was now to be seen in the States\r\nbetween the Ohio and the Mississippi. As Andrew Jackson is the typical\r\ndemocrat of the former region, so Abraham Lincoln is the very embodiment\r\nof the pioneer period of the Old Northwest. Indeed, he is the embodiment\r\nof the democracy of the West. How can one speak of him except in the\r\nwords of Lowell's great \"Commemoration Ode\":--\r\n\r\n     \"For him her Old-World moulds aside she threw,\r\n     And, choosing sweet clay from the breast\r\n         Of the unexhausted West,\r\n     With stuff untainted shaped a hero new,\r\n     Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     His was no lonely mountain-peak of mind,\r\n     Thrusting to thin air o'er our cloudy bars,\r\n     A sea-mark now, now lost in vapors blind;\r\n     Broad prairie rather, genial, level-lined,\r\n     Fruitful and friendly for all human kind,\r\n     Yet also nigh to heaven and loved of loftiest stars.\r\n         Nothing of Europe here,\r\n     Or, then, of Europe fronting mornward still,\r\n     Ere any names of Serf and Peer,\r\n     Could Nature's equal scheme deface;\r\n     New birth of our new soil, the first American.\"\r\n\r\nThe pioneer life from which Lincoln came differed in important respects\r\nfrom the frontier democracy typified by Andrew Jackson. Jackson's\r\ndemocracy was contentious, individualistic, and it sought the ideal of\r\nlocal self-government and expansion. Lincoln represents rather the\r\npioneer folk who entered the forest of the great Northwest to chop out a\r\nhome, to build up their fortunes in the midst of a continually ascending\r\nindustrial movement. In the democracy of the Southwest, industrial\r\ndevelopment and city life were only minor factors, but to the democracy\r\nof the Northwest they were its very life. To widen the area of the\r\nclearing, to contend with one another for the mastery of the industrial\r\nresources of the rich provinces, to struggle for a place in the\r\nascending movement of society, to transmit to one's offspring the chance\r\nfor education, for industrial betterment, for the rise in life which the\r\nhardships of the pioneer existence denied to the pioneer himself, these\r\nwere some of the ideals of the region to which Lincoln came. The men\r\nwere commonwealth builders, industry builders. Whereas the type of hero\r\nin the Southwest was militant, in the Northwest he was industrial. It\r\nwas in the midst of these \"plain people,\" as he loved to call them, that\r\nLincoln grew to manhood. As Emerson says: \"He is the true history of the\r\nAmerican people in his time.\" The years of his early life were the years\r\nwhen the democracy of the Northwest came into struggle with the\r\ninstitution of slavery which threatened to forbid the expansion of the\r\ndemocratic pioneer life in the West. In President Eliot's essay on \"Five\r\nAmerican Contributions to Civilization,\" he instances as one of the\r\nsupreme tests of American democracy its attitude upon the question of\r\nslavery. But if democracy chose wisely and worked effectively toward the\r\nsolution of this problem, it must be remembered that Western democracy\r\ntook the lead. The rail-splitter himself became the nation's President\r\nin that fierce time of struggle, and armies of the woodsmen and pioneer\r\nfarmers recruited in the Old Northwest made free the Father of Waters,\r\nmarched through Georgia, and helped to force the struggle to a\r\nconclusion at Appomattox. The free pioneer democracy struck down the\r\nslave-holding aristocracy on its march to the West.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter in the development of Western democracy is the one that\r\ndeals with its conquest over the vast spaces of the new West. At each\r\nnew stage of Western development, the people have had to grapple with\r\nlarger areas, with bigger combinations. The little colony of\r\nMassachusetts veterans that settled at Marietta received a land grant as\r\nlarge as the State of Rhode Island. The band of Connecticut pioneers\r\nthat followed Moses Cleaveland to the Connecticut Reserve occupied a\r\nregion as large as the parent State. The area which settlers of New\r\nEngland stock occupied on the prairies of northern Illinois surpassed\r\nthe combined area of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Men\r\nwho had become accustomed to the narrow valleys and the little towns of\r\nthe East found themselves out on the boundless spaces of the West\r\ndealing with units of such magnitude as dwarfed their former experience.\r\nThe Great Lakes, the Prairies, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains,\r\nthe Mississippi and the Missouri, furnished new standards of measurement\r\nfor the achievement of this industrial democracy. Individualism began to\r\ngive way to coöperation and to governmental activity. Even in the\r\nearlier days of the democratic conquest of the wilderness, demands had\r\nbeen made upon the government for support in internal improvements, but\r\nthis new West showed a growing tendency to call to its assistance the\r\npowerful arm of national authority. In the period since the Civil War,\r\nthe vast public domain has been donated to the individual farmer, to\r\nStates for education, to railroads for the construction of\r\ntransportation lines.\r\n\r\nMoreover, with the advent of democracy in the last fifteen years upon\r\nthe Great Plains, new physical conditions have presented themselves\r\nwhich have accelerated the social tendency of Western democracy. The\r\npioneer farmer of the days of Lincoln could place his family on a\r\nflatboat, strike into the wilderness, cut out his clearing, and with\r\nlittle or no capital go on to the achievement of industrial\r\nindependence. Even the homesteader on the Western prairies found it\r\npossible to work out a similar independent destiny, although the factor\r\nof transportation made a serious and increasing impediment to the free\r\nworking-out of his individual career. But when the arid lands and the\r\nmineral resources of the Far West were reached, no conquest was possible\r\nby the old individual pioneer methods. Here expensive irrigation works\r\nmust be constructed, coöperative activity was demanded in utilization of\r\nthe water supply, capital beyond the reach of the small farmer was\r\nrequired. In a word, the physiographic province itself decreed that the\r\ndestiny of this new frontier should be social rather than individual.\r\n\r\nMagnitude of social achievement is the watchword of the democracy since\r\nthe Civil War. From petty towns built in the marshes, cities arose whose\r\ngreatness and industrial power are the wonder of our time. The\r\nconditions were ideal for the production of captains of industry. The\r\nold democratic admiration for the self-made man, its old deference to\r\nthe rights of competitive individual development, together with the\r\nstupendous natural resources that opened to the conquest of the keenest\r\nand the strongest, gave such conditions of mobility as enabled the\r\ndevelopment of the large corporate industries which in our own decade\r\nhave marked the West.\r\n\r\nThus, in brief, have been outlined the chief phases of the development\r\nof Western democracy in the different areas which it has conquered.\r\nThere has been a steady development of the industrial ideal, and a\r\nsteady increase of the social tendency, in this later movement of\r\nWestern democracy. While the individualism of the frontier, so prominent\r\nin the earliest days of the Western advance, has been preserved as an\r\nideal, more and more these individuals struggling each with the other,\r\ndealing with vaster and vaster areas, with larger and larger problems,\r\nhave found it necessary to combine under the leadership of the\r\nstrongest. This is the explanation of the rise of those preëminent\r\ncaptains of industry whose genius has concentrated capital to control\r\nthe fundamental resources of the nation. If now in the way of\r\nrecapitulation, we try to pick out from the influences that have gone to\r\nthe making of Western democracy the factors which constitute the net\r\nresult of this movement, we shall have to mention at least the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nMost important of all has been the fact that an area of free land has\r\ncontinually lain on the western border of the settled area of the United\r\nStates. Whenever social conditions tended to crystallize in the East,\r\nwhenever capital tended to press upon labor or political restraints to\r\nimpede the freedom of the mass, there was this gate of escape to the\r\nfree conditions of the frontier. These free lands promoted\r\nindividualism, economic equality, freedom to rise, democracy. Men would\r\nnot accept inferior wages and a permanent position of social\r\nsubordination when this promised land of freedom and equality was theirs\r\nfor the taking. Who would rest content under oppressive legislative\r\nconditions when with a slight effort he might reach a land wherein to\r\nbecome a co-worker in the building of free cities and free States on the\r\nlines of his own ideal? In a word, then, free lands meant free\r\nopportunities. Their existence has differentiated the American\r\ndemocracy from the democracies which have preceded it, because ever, as\r\ndemocracy in the East took the form of highly specialized and\r\ncomplicated industrial society, in the West it kept in touch with\r\nprimitive conditions, and by action and reaction these two forces have\r\nshaped our history.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, these free lands and this treasury of industrial\r\nresources have existed over such vast spaces that they have demanded of\r\ndemocracy increasing spaciousness of design and power of execution.\r\nWestern democracy is contrasted with the democracy of all other times in\r\nthe largeness of the tasks to which it has set its hand, and in the vast\r\nachievements which it has wrought out in the control of nature and of\r\npolitics. It would be difficult to over-emphasize the importance of this\r\ntraining upon democracy. Never before in the history of the world has a\r\ndemocracy existed on so vast an area and handled things in the gross\r\nwith such success, with such largeness of design, and such grasp upon\r\nthe means of execution. In short, democracy has learned in the West of\r\nthe United States how to deal with the problem of magnitude. The old\r\nhistoric democracies were but little states with primitive economic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBut the very task of dealing with vast resources, over vast areas, under\r\nthe conditions of free competition furnished by the West, has produced\r\nthe rise of those captains of industry whose success in consolidating\r\neconomic power now raises the question as to whether democracy under\r\nsuch conditions can survive. For the old military type of Western\r\nleaders like George Rogers Clark, Andrew Jackson, and William Henry\r\nHarrison have been substituted such industrial leaders as James J. Hill,\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie.\r\n\r\nThe question is imperative, then, What ideals persist from this\r\ndemocratic experience of the West; and have they acquired sufficient\r\nmomentum to sustain themselves under conditions so radically unlike\r\nthose in the days of their origin? In other words, the question put at\r\nthe beginning of this discussion becomes pertinent. Under the forms of\r\nthe American democracy is there in reality evolving such a concentration\r\nof economic and social power in the hands of a comparatively few men as\r\nmay make political democracy an appearance rather than a reality? The\r\nfree lands are gone. The material forces that gave vitality to Western\r\ndemocracy are passing away. It is to the realm of the spirit, to the\r\ndomain of ideals and legislation, that we must look for Western\r\ninfluence upon democracy in our own days.\r\n\r\nWestern democracy has been from the time of its birth idealistic. The\r\nvery fact of the wilderness appealed to men as a fair, blank page on\r\nwhich to write a new chapter in the story of man's struggle for a higher\r\ntype of society. The Western wilds, from the Alleghanies to the Pacific,\r\nconstituted the richest free gift that was ever spread out before\r\ncivilized man. To the peasant and artisan of the Old World, bound by the\r\nchains of social class, as old as custom and as inevitable as fate, the\r\nWest offered an exit into a free life and greater well-being among the\r\nbounties of nature, into the midst of resources that demanded manly\r\nexertion, and that gave in return the chance for indefinite ascent in\r\nthe scale of social advance. \"To each she offered gifts after his will.\"\r\nNever again can such an opportunity come to the sons of men. It was\r\nunique, and the thing is so near us, so much a part of our lives, that\r\nwe do not even yet comprehend its full significance. The existence of\r\nthis land of opportunity has made America the goal of idealists from the\r\ndays of the Pilgrim Fathers. With all the materialism of the pioneer\r\nmovements, this idealistic conception of the vacant lands as an\r\nopportunity for a new order of things is unmistakably present.\r\nKipling's \"Song of the English\" has given it expression:--\r\n\r\n     \"We were dreamers, dreaming greatly, in the man-stifled town;\r\n     We yearned beyond the sky-line where the strange roads go down.\r\n     Came the Whisper, came the Vision, came the Power with the Need,\r\n     Till the Soul that is not man's soul was lent us to lead.\r\n     As the deer breaks--as the steer breaks--from the herd where they\r\n         graze,\r\n     In the faith of little children we went on our ways.\r\n     Then the wood failed--then the food failed--then the last water\r\n         dried--\r\n     In the faith of little children we lay down and died.\r\n\r\n     \"On the sand-drift--on the veldt-side--in the fern-scrub we lay,\r\n     That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way.\r\n     Follow after--follow after! We have watered the root\r\n     And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit!\r\n     Follow after--we are waiting by the trails that we lost\r\n     For the sound of many footsteps, for the tread of a host.\r\n\r\n     \"Follow after--follow after--for the harvest is sown:\r\n     By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the vision that called to Roger Williams,--that \"prophetic soul\r\nravished of truth disembodied,\" \"unable to enter into treaty with its\r\nenvironment,\" and forced to seek the wilderness. \"Oh, how sweet,\" wrote\r\nWilliam Penn, from his forest refuge, \"is the quiet of these parts,\r\nfreed from the troubles and perplexities of woeful Europe.\" And here he\r\nprojected what he called his \"Holy Experiment in Government.\"\r\n\r\nIf the later West offers few such striking illustrations of the relation\r\nof the wilderness to idealistic schemes, and if some of the designs were\r\nfantastic and abortive, none the less the influence is a fact. Hardly a\r\nWestern State but has been the Mecca of some sect or band of social\r\nreformers, anxious to put into practice their ideals, in vacant land,\r\nfar removed from the checks of a settled form of social organization.\r\nConsider the Dunkards, the Icarians, the Fourierists, the Mormons, and\r\nsimilar idealists who sought our Western wilds. But the idealistic\r\ninfluence is not limited to the dreamers' conception of a new State. It\r\ngave to the pioneer farmer and city builder a restless energy, a quick\r\ncapacity for judgment and action, a belief in liberty, freedom of\r\nopportunity, and a resistance to the domination of class which infused a\r\nvitality and power into the individual atoms of this democratic mass.\r\nEven as he dwelt among the stumps of his newly-cut clearing, the pioneer\r\nhad the creative vision of a new order of society. In imagination he\r\npushed back the forest boundary to the confines of a mighty\r\nCommonwealth; he willed that log cabins should become the lofty\r\nbuildings of great cities. He decreed that his children should enter\r\ninto a heritage of education, comfort, and social welfare, and for this\r\nideal he bore the scars of the wilderness. Possessed with this idea he\r\nennobled his task and laid deep foundations for a democratic State. Nor\r\nwas this idealism by any means limited to the American pioneer.\r\n\r\nTo the old native democratic stock has been added a vast army of\r\nrecruits from the Old World. There are in the Middle West alone four\r\nmillion persons of German parentage out of a total of seven millions in\r\nthe country. Over a million persons of Scandinavian parentage live in\r\nthe same region. The democracy of the newer West is deeply affected by\r\nthe ideals brought by these immigrants from the Old World. To them\r\nAmerica was not simply a new home; it was a land of opportunity, of\r\nfreedom, of democracy. It meant to them, as to the American pioneer that\r\npreceded them, the opportunity to destroy the bonds of social caste that\r\nbound them in their older home, to hew out for themselves in a new\r\ncountry a destiny proportioned to the powers that God had given them, a\r\nchance to place their families under better conditions and to win a\r\nlarger life than the life that they had left behind. He who believes\r\nthat even the hordes of recent immigrants from southern Italy are drawn\r\nto these shores by nothing more than a dull and blind materialism has\r\nnot penetrated into the heart of the problem. The idealism and\r\nexpectation of these children of the Old World, the hopes which they\r\nhave formed for a newer and freer life across the seas, are almost\r\npathetic when one considers how far they are from the possibility of\r\nfruition. He who would take stock of American democracy must not forget\r\nthe accumulation of human purposes and ideals which immigration has\r\nadded to the American populace.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it must also be remembered that these democratic\r\nideals have existed at each stage of the advance of the frontier, and\r\nhave left behind them deep and enduring effects on the thinking of the\r\nwhole country. Long after the frontier period of a particular region of\r\nthe United States has passed away, the conception of society, the ideals\r\nand aspirations which it produced, persist in the minds of the people.\r\nSo recent has been the transition of the greater portion of the United\r\nStates from frontier conditions to conditions of settled life, that we\r\nare, over the large portion of the United States, hardly a generation\r\nremoved from the primitive conditions of the West. If, indeed, we\r\nourselves were not pioneers, our fathers were, and the inherited ways of\r\nlooking at things, the fundamental assumptions of the American people,\r\nhave all been shaped by this experience of democracy on its westward\r\nmarch. This experience has been wrought into the very warp and woof of\r\nAmerican thought.\r\n\r\nEven those masters of industry and capital who have risen to power by\r\nthe conquest of Western resources came from the midst of this society\r\nand still profess its principles. John D. Rockefeller was born on a New\r\nYork farm, and began his career as a young business man in St. Louis.\r\nMarcus Hanna was a Cleveland grocer's clerk at the age of twenty. Claus\r\nSpreckles, the sugar king, came from Germany as a steerage passenger to\r\nthe United States in 1848. Marshall Field was a farmer boy in Conway,\r\nMassachusetts, until he left to grow up with the young Chicago. Andrew\r\nCarnegie came as a ten-year-old boy from Scotland to Pittsburgh, then a\r\ndistinctively Western town. He built up his fortunes through successive\r\ngrades until he became the dominating factor in the great iron\r\nindustries, and paved the way for that colossal achievement, the Steel\r\nTrust. Whatever may be the tendencies of this corporation, there can be\r\nlittle doubt of the democratic ideals of Mr. Carnegie himself. With\r\nlavish hand he has strewn millions through the United States for the\r\npromotion of libraries. The effect of this library movement in\r\nperpetuating the democracy that comes from an intelligent and\r\nself-respecting people can hardly be measured. In his \"Triumphant\r\nDemocracy,\" published in 1886, Mr. Carnegie, the ironmaster, said, in\r\nreference to the mineral wealth of the United States: \"Thank God, these\r\ntreasures are in the hands of an intelligent people, the Democracy, to\r\nbe used for the general good of the masses, and not made the spoils of\r\nmonarchs, courts, and aristocracy, to be turned to the base and selfish\r\nends of a privileged hereditary class.\" It would be hard to find a more\r\nrigorous assertion of democratic doctrine than the celebrated utterance,\r\nattributed to the same man, that he should feel it a disgrace to die\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the services of American democracy, President Eliot\r\nincluded the corporation as one of its achievements, declaring that\r\n\"freedom of incorporation, though no longer exclusively a democratic\r\nagency, has given a strong support to democratic institutions.\" In one\r\nsense this is doubtless true, since the corporation has been one of the\r\nmeans by which small properties can be aggregated into an effective\r\nworking body. Socialistic writers have long been fond of pointing out\r\nalso that these various concentrations pave the way for and make\r\npossible social control. From this point of view it is possible that the\r\nmasters of industry may prove to be not so much an incipient aristocracy\r\nas the pathfinders for democracy in reducing the industrial world to\r\nsystematic consolidation suited to democratic control. The great\r\ngeniuses that have built up the modern industrial concentration were\r\ntrained in the midst of democratic society. They were the product of\r\nthese democratic conditions. Freedom to rise was the very condition of\r\ntheir existence. Whether they will be followed by successors who will\r\nadopt the exploitation of the masses, and who will be capable of\r\nretaining under efficient control these vast resources, is one of the\r\nquestions which we shall have to face.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is clear: American democracy is fundamentally the\r\noutcome of the experiences of the American people in dealing with the\r\nWest. Western democracy through the whole of its earlier period tended\r\nto the production of a society of which the most distinctive fact was\r\nthe freedom of the individual to rise under conditions of social\r\nmobility, and whose ambition was the liberty and well-being of the\r\nmasses. This conception has vitalized all American democracy, and has\r\nbrought it into sharp contrasts with the democracies of history, and\r\nwith those modern efforts of Europe to create an artificial democratic\r\norder by legislation. The problem of the United States is not to create\r\ndemocracy, but to conserve democratic institutions and ideals. In the\r\nlater period of its development, Western democracy has been gaining\r\nexperience in the problem of social control. It has steadily enlarged\r\nthe sphere of its action and the instruments for its perpetuation. By\r\nits system of public schools, from the grades to the graduate work of\r\nthe great universities, the West has created a larger single body of\r\nintelligent plain people than can be found elsewhere in the world. Its\r\npolitical tendencies, whether we consider Democracy, Populism, or\r\nRepublicanism, are distinctly in the direction of greater social control\r\nand the conservation of the old democratic ideals.\r\n\r\nTo these ideals the West adheres with even a passionate determination.\r\nIf, in working out its mastery of the resources of the interior, it has\r\nproduced a type of industrial leader so powerful as to be the wonder of\r\nthe world, nevertheless, it is still to be determined whether these men\r\nconstitute a menace to democratic institutions, or the most efficient\r\nfactor for adjusting democratic control to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nWhatever shall be the outcome of the rush of this huge industrial modern\r\nUnited States to its place among the nations of the earth, the formation\r\nof its Western democracy will always remain one of the wonderful\r\nchapters in the history of the human race. Into this vast shaggy\r\ncontinent of ours poured the first feeble tide of European settlement.\r\nEuropean men, institutions, and ideas were lodged in the American\r\nwilderness, and this great American West took them to her bosom, taught\r\nthem a new way of looking upon the destiny of the common man, trained\r\nthem in adaptation to the conditions of the New World, to the creation\r\nof new institutions to meet new needs; and ever as society on her\r\neastern border grew to resemble the Old World in its social forms and\r\nits industry, ever, as it began to lose faith in the ideals of\r\ndemocracy, she opened new provinces, and dowered new democracies in her\r\nmost distant domains with her material treasures and with the ennobling\r\ninfluence that the fierce love of freedom, the strength that came from\r\nhewing out a home, making a school and a church, and creating a higher\r\nfuture for his family, furnished to the pioneer.\r\n\r\nShe gave to the world such types as the farmer Thomas Jefferson, with\r\nhis Declaration of Independence, his statute for religious toleration,\r\nand his purchase of Louisiana. She gave us Andrew Jackson, that fierce\r\nTennessee spirit who broke down the traditions of conservative rule,\r\nswept away the privacies and privileges of officialdom, and, like a\r\nGothic leader, opened the temple of the nation to the populace. She gave\r\nus Abraham Lincoln, whose gaunt frontier form and gnarled, massive hand\r\ntold of the conflict with the forest, whose grasp of the ax-handle of\r\nthe pioneer was no firmer than his grasp of the helm of the ship of\r\nstate as it breasted the seas of civil war. She has furnished to this\r\nnew democracy her stores of mineral wealth, that dwarf those of the Old\r\nWorld, and her provinces that in themselves are vaster and more\r\nproductive than most of the nations of Europe. Out of her bounty has\r\ncome a nation whose industrial competition alarms the Old World, and the\r\nmasters of whose resources wield wealth and power vaster than the wealth\r\nand power of kings. Best of all, the West gave, not only to the\r\nAmerican, but to the unhappy and oppressed of all lands, a vision of\r\nhope, and assurance that the world held a place where were to be found\r\nhigh faith in man and the will and power to furnish him the opportunity\r\nto grow to the full measure of his own capacity. Great and powerful as\r\nare the new sons of her loins, the Republic is greater than they. The\r\npaths of the pioneer have widened into broad highways. The forest\r\nclearing has expanded into affluent commonwealths. Let us see to it that\r\nthe ideals of the pioneer in his log cabin shall enlarge into the\r\nspiritual life of a democracy where civic power shall dominate and\r\nutilize individual achievement for the common good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[243:1] _Atlantic Monthly_, January, 1903. Reprinted by permission.\r\n\r\n[248:1] See chapter iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nPIONEER IDEALS AND THE STATE UNIVERSITY[269:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideals of a people, their aspirations and convictions, their hopes\r\nand ambitions, their dreams and determinations, are assets in their\r\ncivilization as real and important as per capita wealth or industrial\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThis nation was formed under pioneer ideals. During three centuries\r\nafter Captain John Smith struck the first blow at the American forest on\r\nthe eastern edge of the continent, the pioneers were abandoning settled\r\nsociety for the wilderness, seeking, for generation after generation,\r\nnew frontiers. Their experiences left abiding influences upon the ideas\r\nand purposes of the nation. Indeed the older settled regions themselves\r\nwere shaped profoundly by the very fact that the whole nation was\r\npioneering and that in the development of the West the East had its own\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe first ideal of the pioneer was that of conquest. It was his task to\r\nfight with nature for the chance to exist. Not as in older countries did\r\nthis contest take place in a mythical past, told in folk lore and epic.\r\nIt has been continuous to our own day. Facing each generation of\r\npioneers was the unmastered continent. Vast forests blocked the way;\r\nmountainous ramparts interposed; desolate, grass-clad prairies, barren\r\noceans of rolling plains, arid deserts, and a fierce race of savages,\r\nall had to be met and defeated. The rifle and the ax are the symbols of\r\nthe backwoods pioneer. They meant a training in aggressive courage, in\r\ndomination, in directness of action, in destructiveness.\r\n\r\nTo the pioneer the forest was no friendly resource for posterity, no\r\nobject of careful economy. He must wage a hand-to-hand war upon it,\r\ncutting and burning a little space to let in the light upon a dozen\r\nacres of hard-won soil, and year after year expanding the clearing into\r\nnew woodlands against the stubborn resistance of primeval trunks and\r\nmatted roots. He made war against the rank fertility of the soil. While\r\nnew worlds of virgin land lay ever just beyond, it was idle to expect\r\nthe pioneer to stay his hand and turn to scientific farming. Indeed, as\r\nSecretary Wilson has said, the pioneer would, in that case, have raised\r\nwheat that no one wanted to eat, corn to store on the farm, and cotton\r\nnot worth the picking.\r\n\r\nThus, fired with the ideal of subduing the wilderness, the destroying\r\npioneer fought his way across the continent, masterful and wasteful,\r\npreparing the way by seeking the immediate thing, rejoicing in rude\r\nstrength and wilful achievement.\r\n\r\nBut even this backwoodsman was more than a mere destroyer. He had\r\nvisions. He was finder as well as fighter--the trail-maker for\r\ncivilization, the inventor of new ways. Although Rudyard Kipling's\r\n\"Foreloper\"[270:1] deals with the English pioneer in lands beneath the\r\nSouthern Cross, yet the poem portrays American traits as well:\r\n\r\n     \"The gull shall whistle in his wake, the blind wave break in fire,\r\n     He shall fulfill God's utmost will, unknowing his desire;\r\n     And he shall see old planets pass and alien stars arise,\r\n     And give the gale his reckless sail in shadow of new skies.\r\n\r\n     \"Strong lust of gear shall drive him out and hunger arm his hand\r\n     To wring food from desert nude, his foothold from the sand.\r\n     His neighbors' smoke shall vex his eyes, their voices break his\r\n         rest;\r\n     He shall go forth till south is north, sullen and dispossessed;\r\n     He shall desire loneliness and his desire shall bring\r\n     Hard on his heels, a thousand wheels, a people and a king.\r\n\r\n     \"He shall come back on his own track, and by his scarce cool camp,\r\n     There shall he meet the roaring street, the derrick and the stamp;\r\n     For he must blaze a nation's way with hatchet and with brand,\r\n     Till on his last won wilderness an empire's bulwarks stand.\"\r\n\r\nThis quest after the unknown, this yearning \"beyond the sky line, where\r\nthe strange roads go down,\" is of the very essence of the backwoods\r\npioneer, even though he was unconscious of its spiritual significance.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer was taught in the school of experience that the crops of one\r\narea would not do for a new frontier; that the scythe of the clearing\r\nmust be replaced by the reaper of the prairies. He was forced to make\r\nold tools serve new uses; to shape former habits, institutions and ideas\r\nto changed conditions; and to find new means when the old proved\r\ninapplicable. He was building a new society as well as breaking new\r\nsoil; he had the ideal of nonconformity and of change. He rebelled\r\nagainst the conventional.\r\n\r\nBesides the ideals of conquest and of discovery, the pioneer had the\r\nideal of personal development, free from social and governmental\r\nconstraint. He came from a civilization based on individual competition,\r\nand he brought the conception with him to the wilderness where a wealth\r\nof resources, and innumerable opportunities gave it a new scope. The\r\nprizes were for the keenest and the strongest; for them were the best\r\nbottom lands, the finest timber tracts, the best salt-springs, the\r\nrichest ore beds; and not only these natural gifts, but also the\r\nopportunities afforded in the midst of a forming society. Here were mill\r\nsites, town sites, transportation lines, banking centers, openings in\r\nthe law, in politics--all the varied chances for advancement afforded in\r\na rapidly developing society where everything was open to him who knew\r\nhow to seize the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe squatter enforced his claim to lands even against the government's\r\ntitle by the use of extra-legal combinations and force. He appealed to\r\nlynch law with little hesitation. He was impatient of any governmental\r\nrestriction upon his individual right to deal with the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn our own day we sometimes hear of congressmen sent to jail for\r\nviolating land laws; but the different spirit in the pioneer days may be\r\nillustrated by a speech of Delegate Sibley of Minnesota in Congress in\r\n1852. In view of the fact that he became the State's first governor, a\r\nregent of its university, president of its historical society, and a\r\ndoctor of laws of Princeton, we may assume that he was a pillar of\r\nsociety. He said:\r\n\r\n     The government has watched its public domain with jealous eye,\r\n     and there are now enactments upon your statute books, aimed at\r\n     the trespassers upon it, which should be expunged as a\r\n     disgrace to the country and to the nineteenth century.\r\n     Especially is he pursued with unrelenting severity, who has\r\n     dared to break the silence of the primeval forest by the blows\r\n     of the American ax. The hardy lumberman who has penetrated to\r\n     the remotest wilds of the Northwest, to drag from their\r\n     recesses the materials for building up towns and cities in the\r\n     great valley of the Mississippi, has been particularly marked\r\n     out as a victim. After enduring all the privations and\r\n     subjecting himself to all the perils incident to his\r\n     vocation--when he has toiled for months to add by his honest\r\n     labor to the comfort of his fellow men, and to the aggregate\r\n     wealth of the nation, he finds himself suddenly in the\r\n     clutches of the law for trespassing on the public domain. The\r\n     proceeds of his long winter's work are reft from him, and\r\n     exposed to public sale for the benefit of his paternal\r\n     government . . . and the object of this oppression and wrong\r\n     is further harassed by vexatious law proceedings against him.\r\n\r\nSibley's protest in congress against these \"outrages\" by which the\r\nnorthern lumbermen were \"harassed\" in their work of what would now be\r\ncalled stealing government timber, aroused no protest from his\r\ncolleagues. No president called this congressman an undesirable citizen\r\nor gave him over to the courts.\r\n\r\nThus many of the pioneers, following the ideal of the right of the\r\nindividual to rise, subordinated the rights of the nation and posterity\r\nto the desire that the country should be \"developed\" and that the\r\nindividual should advance with as little interference as possible.\r\nSquatter doctrines and individualism have left deep traces upon American\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nBut quite as deeply fixed in the pioneer's mind as the ideal of\r\nindividualism was the ideal of democracy. He had a passionate hatred for\r\naristocracy, monopoly and special privilege; he believed in simplicity,\r\neconomy and in the rule of the people. It is true that he honored the\r\nsuccessful man, and that he strove in all ways to advance himself. But\r\nthe West was so free and so vast, the barriers to individual achievement\r\nwere so remote, that the pioneer was hardly conscious that any danger to\r\nequality could come from his competition for natural resources. He\r\nthought of democracy as in some way the result of our political\r\ninstitutions, and he failed to see that it was primarily the result of\r\nthe free lands and immense opportunities which surrounded him.\r\nOccasional statesmen voiced the idea that American democracy was based\r\non the abundance of unoccupied land, even in the first debates on the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThis early recognition of the influence of abundance of land in shaping\r\nthe economic conditions of American democracy is peculiarly significant\r\nto-day in view of the practical exhaustion of the supply of cheap arable\r\npublic lands open to the poor man, and the coincident development of\r\nlabor unions to keep up wages.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the strength of democratic movements has chiefly lain\r\nin the regions of the pioneer. \"Our governments tend too much to\r\ndemocracy,\" wrote Izard, of South Carolina, to Jefferson, in 1785. \"A\r\nhandicraftsman thinks an apprenticeship necessary to make him acquainted\r\nwith his business. But our backcountrymen are of the opinion that a\r\npolitician may be born just as well as a poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary ideas, of course, gave a great impetus to democracy,\r\nand in substantially every colony there was a double revolution, one for\r\nindependence and the other for the overthrow of aristocratic control.\r\nBut in the long run the effective force behind American democracy was\r\nthe presence of the practically free land into which men might escape\r\nfrom oppression or inequalities which burdened them in the older\r\nsettlements. This possibility compelled the coastwise States to\r\nliberalize the franchise; and it prevented the formation of a dominant\r\nclass, whether based on property or on custom. Among the pioneers one\r\nman was as good as his neighbor. He had the same chance; conditions were\r\nsimple and free. Economic equality fostered political equality. An\r\noptimistic and buoyant belief in the worth of the plain people, a\r\ndevout faith in man prevailed in the West. Democracy became almost the\r\nreligion of the pioneer. He held with passionate devotion the idea that\r\nhe was building under freedom a new society, based on self government,\r\nand for the welfare of the average man.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even as he proclaimed the gospel of democracy the pioneer showed\r\na vague apprehension lest the time be short--lest equality should not\r\nendure--lest he might fall behind in the ascending movement of Western\r\nsociety. This led him on in feverish haste to acquire advantages as\r\nthough he only half believed his dream. \"Before him lies a boundless\r\ncontinent,\" wrote De Tocqueville, in the days when pioneer democracy was\r\ntriumphant under Jackson, \"and he urges forward as if time pressed and\r\nhe was afraid of finding no room for his exertions.\"\r\n\r\nEven while Jackson lived, labor leaders and speculative thinkers were\r\ndemanding legislation to place a limit on the amount of land which one\r\nperson might acquire and to provide free farms. De Tocqueville saw the\r\nsigns of change. \"Between the workman and the master,\" he said, \"there\r\nare frequent relations but no real association. . . . I am of the\r\nopinion, upon the whole, that the manufacturing aristocracy which is\r\ngrowing up under our eyes is one of the harshest which ever existed in\r\nthe world; . . . if ever a permanent inequality, of conditions and\r\naristocracy again penetrate into the world, it may be predicted that\r\nthis is the gate by which they will enter.\" But the sanative influences\r\nof the free spaces of the West were destined to ameliorate labor's\r\ncondition, to afford new hopes and new faith to pioneer democracy, and\r\nto postpone the problem.\r\n\r\nAs the settlers advanced into provinces whose area dwarfed that of the\r\nolder sections, pioneer democracy itself began to undergo changes, both\r\nin its composition and in its processes of expansion. At the close of\r\nthe Civil War, when settlement was spreading with greatest vigor across\r\nthe Mississippi, the railways began their work as colonists. Their land\r\ngrants from the government, amounting altogether by 1871 to an area five\r\ntimes that of the State of Pennsylvania, demanded purchasers, and so the\r\nrailroads pioneered the way for the pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe homestead law increased the tide of settlers. The improved farm\r\nmachinery made it possible for him to go boldly out on to the prairie\r\nand to deal effectively with virgin soil in farms whose cultivated area\r\nmade the old clearings of the backwoodsman seem mere garden plots. Two\r\nthings resulted from these conditions, which profoundly modified pioneer\r\nideals. In the first place the new form of colonization demanded an\r\nincreasing use of capital; and the rapidity of the formation of towns,\r\nthe speed with which society developed, made men the more eager to\r\nsecure bank credit to deal with the new West. This made the pioneer more\r\ndependent on the eastern economic forces. In the second place the farmer\r\nbecame dependent as never before on transportation companies. In this\r\nspeculative movement the railroads, finding that they had pressed too\r\nfar in advance and had issued stock to freely for their earnings to\r\njustify the face of the investment, came into collision with the pioneer\r\non the question of rates and of discriminations. The Greenback movement\r\nand the Granger movements were appeals to government to prevent what the\r\npioneer thought to be invasions of pioneer democracy.\r\n\r\nAs the western settler began to face the problem of magnitude in the\r\nareas he was occupying; as he began to adjust his life to the modern\r\nforces of capital and to complex productive processes; as he began to\r\nsee that, go where he would, the question of credit and currency, of\r\ntransportation and distribution in general conditioned his success, he\r\nsought relief by legislation. He began to lose his primitive attitude\r\nof individualism, government began to look less like a necessary evil\r\nand more like an instrument for the perpetuation of his democratic\r\nideals. In brief, the defenses of the pioneer democrat began to shift,\r\nfrom free land to legislation, from the ideal of individualism to the\r\nideal of social control through regulation by law. He had no sympathy\r\nwith a radical reconstruction of society by the revolution of socialism;\r\neven his alliances with the movement of organized labor, which\r\nparalleled that of organized capital in the East, were only\r\nhalf-hearted. But he was becoming alarmed over the future of the free\r\ndemocratic ideal. The wisdom of his legislation it is not necessary to\r\ndiscuss here. The essential point is that his conception of the right of\r\ngovernment to control social process had undergone a change. He was\r\ncoming to regard legislation as an instrument of social construction.\r\nThe individualism of the Kentucky pioneer of 1796 was giving way to the\r\nPopulism of the Kansas pioneer of 1896.\r\n\r\nThe later days of pioneer democracy are too familiar to require much\r\nexposition. But they are profoundly significant. As the pioneer doctrine\r\nof free competition for the resources of the nation revealed its\r\ntendencies; as individual, corporation and trust, like the pioneer,\r\nturned increasingly to legal devices to promote their contrasting\r\nideals, the natural resources were falling into private possession.\r\nTides of alien immigrants were surging into the country to replace the\r\nold American stock in the labor market, to lower the standard of living\r\nand to increase the pressure of population upon the land. These recent\r\nforeigners have lodged almost exclusively in the dozen great centers of\r\nindustrial life, and there they have accented the antagonisms between\r\ncapital and labor by the fact that the labor supply has become\r\nincreasingly foreign born, and recruited from nationalities who arouse\r\nno sympathy on the part of capital and little on the part of the\r\ngeneral public. Class distinctions are accented by national prejudices,\r\nand democracy is thereby invaded. But even in the dull brains of great\r\nmasses of these unfortunates from southern and eastern Europe the idea\r\nof America as the land of freedom and of opportunity to rise, the land\r\nof pioneer democratic ideals, has found lodgment, and if it is given\r\ntime and is not turned into revolutionary lines it will fructify.\r\n\r\nAs the American pioneer passed on in advance of this new tide of\r\nEuropean immigration, he found lands increasingly limited. In place of\r\nthe old lavish opportunity for the settler to set his stakes where he\r\nwould, there were frantic rushes of thousands of eager pioneers across\r\nthe line of newly opened Indian reservations. Even in 1889, when\r\nOklahoma was opened to settlement, twenty thousand settlers crowded at\r\nthe boundaries, like straining athletes, waiting the bugle note that\r\nshould start the race across the line. To-day great crowds gather at the\r\nland lotteries of the government as the remaining fragments of the\r\npublic domain are flung to hungry settlers.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of pioneers from the Middle West have crossed the\r\nnational boundary into Canadian wheat fields eager to find farms for\r\ntheir children, although under an alien flag. And finally the government\r\nhas taken to itself great areas of arid land for reclamation by costly\r\nirrigation projects whereby to furnish twenty-acre tracts in the desert\r\nto settlers under careful regulation of water rights. The government\r\nsupplies the capital for huge irrigation dams and reservoirs and builds\r\nthem itself. It owns and operates quarries, coal mines and timber to\r\nfacilitate this work. It seeks the remotest regions of the earth for\r\ncrops suitable for these areas. It analyzes the soils and tells the\r\nfarmer what and when and how to plant. It has even considered the rental\r\nto manufacturers of the surplus water, electrical and steam power\r\ngenerated in its irrigation works and the utilization of this power to\r\nextract nitrates from the air to replenish worn-out soils. The pioneer\r\nof the arid regions must be both a capitalist and the protégé of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nConsider the contrast between the conditions of the pioneers at the\r\nbeginning and at the end of this period of development. Three hundred\r\nyears ago adventurous Englishmen on the coast of Virginia began the\r\nattack on the wilderness. Three years ago the President of the United\r\nStates summoned the governors of forty-six states to deliberate upon the\r\ndanger of the exhaustion of the natural resources of the nation.[279:1]\r\n\r\nThe pressure of population upon the food supply is already felt and we\r\nare at the beginning only of this transformation. It is profoundly\r\nsignificant that at the very time when American democracy is becoming\r\nconscious that its pioneer basis of free land and sparse population is\r\ngiving way, it is also brought face to face with the startling outcome\r\nof its old ideals of individualism and exploitation under competition\r\nuncontrolled by government. Pioneer society itself was not sufficiently\r\nsophisticated to work out to its logical result the conception of the\r\nself-made man. But the captains of industry by applying squatter\r\ndoctrines to the evolution of American industrial society, have made the\r\nprocess so clear that he who runs may read. Contests imply alliances as\r\nwell as rivalries. The increasing magnitude of the areas to be dealt\r\nwith and the occurrences of times of industrial stress furnished\r\noccasion for such unions. The panic of 1873 was followed by an\r\nunprecedented combination of individual businesses and partnerships into\r\ncorporations. The panic of 1893 marked the beginning of an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of corporate combinations into pools and trusts, agreements\r\nand absorptions, until, by the time of the panic of 1907, it seemed not\r\nimpossible that the outcome of free competition under individualism was\r\nto be monopoly of the most important natural resources and processes by\r\na limited group of men whose vast fortunes were so invested in allied\r\nand dependent industries that they constituted the dominating force in\r\nthe industrial life of the nation. The development of large scale\r\nfactory production, the benefit of combination in the competitive\r\nstruggle, and the tremendous advantage of concentration in securing\r\npossession of the unoccupied opportunities, were so great that vast\r\naccumulations of capital became the normal agency of the industrial\r\nworld. In almost exact ratio to the diminution of the supply of\r\nunpossessed resources, combinations of capital have increased in\r\nmagnitude and in efficiency of conquest. The solitary backwoodsman\r\nwielding his ax at the edge of a measureless forest is replaced by\r\ncompanies capitalized at millions, operating railroads, sawmills, and\r\nall the enginery of modern machinery to harvest the remaining\r\ntrees.[280:1]\r\n\r\nA new national development is before us without the former safety valve\r\nof abundant resources open to him who would take. Classes are becoming\r\nalarmingly distinct: There is the demand on the one side voiced by Mr.\r\nHarriman so well and by others since, that nothing must be done to\r\ninterfere with the early pioneer ideals of the exploitation and the\r\ndevelopment of the country's wealth; that restrictive and reforming\r\nlegislation must on no account threaten prosperity even for a moment. In\r\nfact, we sometimes hear in these days, from men of influence, serious\r\ndoubts of democracy, and intimations that the country would be better\r\noff if it freely resigned itself to guidance by the geniuses who are\r\nmastering the economic forces of the nation, and who, it is alleged,\r\nwould work out the prosperity of the United States more effectively, if\r\nunvexed by politicians and people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an inharmonious group of reformers are sounding the\r\nwarning that American democratic ideals and society are menaced and\r\nalready invaded by the very conditions that make this apparent\r\nprosperity; that the economic resources are no longer limitless and\r\nfree; that the aggregate national wealth is increasing at the cost of\r\npresent social justice and moral health, and the future well-being of\r\nthe American people. The Granger and the Populist were prophets of this\r\nreform movement. Mr. Bryan's Democracy, Mr. Debs' Socialism, and Mr.\r\nRoosevelt's Republicanism all had in common the emphasis upon the need\r\nof governmental regulation of industrial tendencies in the interest of\r\nthe common man; the checking of the power of those business Titans who\r\nemerged successful out of the competitive individualism of pioneer\r\nAmerica. As land values rise, as meat and bread grow dearer, as the\r\nprocess of industrial consolidation goes on, and as Eastern industrial\r\nconditions spread across the West, the problems of traditional American\r\ndemocracy will become increasingly grave.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when University men may well consider pioneer ideals,\r\nfor American society has reached the end of the first great period in\r\nits formation. It must survey itself, reflect upon its origins, consider\r\nwhat freightage of purposes it carried in its long march across the\r\ncontinent, what ambitions it had for the man, what rôle it would play in\r\nthe world. How shall we conserve what was best in pioneer ideals? How\r\nadjust the old conceptions to the changed conditions of modern life?\r\n\r\nOther nations have been rich and prosperous and powerful. But the United\r\nStates has believed that it had an original contribution to make to the\r\nhistory of society by the production of a self-determining,\r\nself-restrained, intelligent democracy. It is in the Middle West that\r\nsociety has formed on lines least like those of Europe. It is here, if\r\nanywhere, that American democracy will make its stand against the\r\ntendency to adjust to a European type.\r\n\r\nThis consideration gives importance to my final topic, the relation of\r\nthe University to pioneer ideals and to the changing conditions of\r\nAmerican democracy. President Pritchett of the Carnegie Foundation has\r\nrecently declared that in no other form of popular activity does a\r\nnation or State so clearly reveal its ideals or the quality of its\r\ncivilization as in its system of education; and he finds, especially in\r\nthe State University, \"a conception of education from the standpoint of\r\nthe whole people.\" \"If our American democracy were to-day called to give\r\nproof of its constructive ability,\" he says, \"the State University and\r\nthe public school system which it crowns would be the strongest evidence\r\nof its fitness which it could offer.\"\r\n\r\nIt may at least be conceded that an essential characteristic of the\r\nState University is its democracy in the largest sense. The provision in\r\nthe Constitution of Indiana of 1816, so familiar to you all, for a\r\n\"general system of education ascending in regular gradations from\r\ntownship schools to a State University, wherein tuition shall be gratis\r\nand equally open to all,\" expresses the Middle Western conception born\r\nin the days of pioneer society and doubtless deeply influenced by\r\nJeffersonian democracy.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious fact about these universities, perhaps, lies in their\r\nintegral relation with the public schools, whereby the pupil has pressed\r\nupon him the question whether he shall go to college, and whereby the\r\nroad is made open and direct to the highest training. By this means the\r\nState offers to every class the means of education, and even engages in\r\npropaganda to induce students to continue. It sinks deep shafts through\r\nthe social strata to find the gold of real ability in the underlying\r\nrock of the masses. It fosters that due degree of individualism which is\r\nimplied in the right of every human being to have opportunity to rise in\r\nwhatever directions his peculiar abilities entitle him to go,\r\nsubordinate to the welfare of the state. It keeps the avenues of\r\npromotion to the highest offices, the highest honors, open to the\r\nhumblest and most obscure lad who has the natural gifts, at the same\r\ntime that it aids in the improvement of the masses.\r\n\r\nNothing in our educational history is more striking than the steady\r\npressure of democracy upon its universities to adapt them to the\r\nrequirements of all the people. From the State Universities of the\r\nMiddle West, shaped under pioneer ideals, have come the fuller\r\nrecognition of scientific studies, and especially those of applied\r\nscience devoted to the conquest of nature; the breaking down of the\r\ntraditional required curriculum; the union of vocational and college\r\nwork in the same institution; the development of agricultural and\r\nengineering colleges and business courses; the training of lawyers,\r\nadministrators, public men, and journalists--all under the ideal of\r\nservice to democracy rather than of individual advancement alone. Other\r\nuniversities do the same thing; but the head springs and the main\r\ncurrent of this great stream of tendency come from the land of the\r\npioneers, the democratic states of the Middle West. And the people\r\nthemselves, through their boards of trustees and the legislature, are in\r\nthe last resort the court of appeal as to the directions and conditions\r\nof growth, as well as have the fountain of income from which these\r\nuniversities derive their existence.\r\n\r\nThe State University has thus both a peculiar power in the directness of\r\nits influence upon the whole people and a peculiar limitation in its\r\ndependence upon the people. The ideals of the people constitute the\r\natmosphere in which it moves, though it can itself affect this\r\natmosphere. Herein is the source of its strength and the direction of\r\nits difficulties. For to fulfil its mission of uplifting the state to\r\ncontinuously higher levels the University must, in the words of Mr.\r\nBryce, \"serve the time without yielding to it;\" it must recognize new\r\nneeds without becoming subordinate to the immediately practical, to the\r\nshort-sightedly expedient. It must not sacrifice the higher efficiency\r\nfor the more obvious but lower efficiency. It must have the wisdom to\r\nmake expenditures for results which pay manifold in the enrichment of\r\ncivilization, but which are not immediate and palpable.\r\n\r\nIn the transitional condition of American democracy which I have tried\r\nto indicate, the mission of the university is most important. The times\r\ncall for educated leaders. General experience and rule-of-thumb\r\ninformation are inadequate for the solution of the problems of a\r\ndemocracy which no longer owns the safety fund of an unlimited quantity\r\nof untouched resources. Scientific farming must increase the yield of\r\nthe field, scientific forestry must economize the woodlands, scientific\r\nexperiment and construction by chemist, physicist, biologist and\r\nengineer must be applied to all of nature's forces in our complex modern\r\nsociety. The test tube and the microscope are needed rather than ax and\r\nrifle in this new ideal of conquest. The very discoveries of science in\r\nsuch fields as public health and manufacturing processes have made it\r\nnecessary to depend upon the expert, and if the ranks of experts are to\r\nbe recruited broadly from the democratic masses as well as from those of\r\nlarger means, the State Universities must furnish at least as liberal\r\nopportunities for research and training as the universities based on\r\nprivate endowments furnish. It needs no argument to show that it is not\r\nto the advantage of democracy to give over the training of the expert\r\nexclusively to privately endowed institutions.\r\n\r\nBut quite as much in the field of legislation and of public life in\r\ngeneral as in the industrial world is the expert needed. The industrial\r\nconditions which shape society are too complex, problems of labor,\r\nfinance, social reform too difficult to be dealt with intelligently and\r\nwisely without the leadership of highly educated men familiar with the\r\nlegislation and literature on social questions in other States and\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nBy training in science, in law, politics, economics and history the\r\nuniversities may supply from the ranks of democracy administrators,\r\nlegislators, judges and experts for commissions who shall\r\ndisinterestedly and intelligently mediate between contending interests.\r\nWhen the words \"capitalistic classes\" and \"the proletariate\" can be used\r\nand understood in America it is surely time to develop such men, with\r\nthe ideal of service to the State, who may help to break the force of\r\nthese collisions, to find common grounds between the contestants and to\r\npossess the respect and confidence of all parties which are genuinely\r\nloyal to the best American ideals.\r\n\r\nThe signs of such a development are already plain in the expert\r\ncommissions of some States; in the increasing proportion of university\r\nmen in legislatures; in the university men's influence in federal\r\ndepartments and commissions. It is hardly too much to say that the best\r\nhope of intelligent and principled progress in economic and social\r\nlegislation and administration lies in the increasing influence of\r\nAmerican universities. By sending out these open-minded experts, by\r\nfurnishing well-fitted legislators, public leaders and teachers, by\r\ngraduating successive armies of enlightened citizens accustomed to deal\r\ndispassionately with the problems of modern life, able to think for\r\nthemselves, governed not by ignorance, by prejudice or by impulse, but\r\nby knowledge and reason and high-mindedness, the State Universities will\r\nsafeguard democracy. Without such leaders and followers democratic\r\nreactions may create revolutions, but they will not be able to produce\r\nindustrial and social progress. America's problem is not violently to\r\nintroduce democratic ideals, but to preserve and entrench them by\r\ncourageous adaptation to new conditions. Educated leadership sets\r\nbulwarks against both the passionate impulses of the mob and the\r\nsinister designs of those who would subordinate public welfare to\r\nprivate greed. Lord Bacon's splendid utterance still rings true: \"The\r\nlearning of the few is despotism; the learning of the many is liberty.\r\nAnd intelligent and principled liberty is fame, wisdom and power.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a danger to the universities in this very opportunity. At first\r\npioneer democracy had scant respect for the expert. He believed that \"a\r\nfool can put on his coat better than a wise man can do it for him.\"\r\nThere is much truth in the belief; and the educated leader, even he who\r\nhas been trained under present university conditions, in direct contact\r\nwith the world about him, will still have to contend with this inherited\r\nsuspicion of the expert. But if he be well trained and worthy of his\r\ntraining, if he be endowed with creative imagination and personality, he\r\nwill make good his leadership.\r\n\r\nA more serious danger will come when the universities are fully\r\nrecognized as powerful factors in shaping the life of the State--not\r\nmere cloisters, remote from its life, but an influential element in its\r\nlife. Then it may easily happen that the smoke of the battle-field of\r\npolitical and social controversy will obscure their pure air, that\r\nefforts will be made to stamp out the exceptional doctrine and the\r\nexceptional man. Those who investigate and teach within the university\r\nwalls must respond to the injunction of the church, \"_Sursum\r\ncorda_\"--lift up the heart to high thinking and impartial search for\r\nthe unsullied truth in the interests of all the people; this is the holy\r\ngrail of the universities.\r\n\r\nThat they may perform their work they must be left free, as the pioneer\r\nwas free, to explore new regions and to report what they find; for like\r\nthe pioneers they have the ideal of investigation, they seek new\r\nhorizons. They are not tied to past knowledge; they recognize the fact\r\nthat the universe still abounds in mystery, that science and society\r\nhave not crystallized, but are still growing and need their pioneer\r\ntrail-makers. New and beneficent discoveries in nature, new and\r\nbeneficial discoveries in the processes and directions of the growth of\r\nsociety, substitutes for the vanishing material basis of pioneer\r\ndemocracy may be expected if the university pioneers are left free to\r\nseek the trail.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the university has a duty in adjusting pioneer ideals to\r\nthe new requirements of American democracy, even more important than\r\nthose which I have named. The early pioneer was an individualist and a\r\nseeker after the undiscovered; but he did not understand the richness\r\nand complexity of life as a whole; he did not fully realize his\r\nopportunities of individualism and discovery. He stood in his somber\r\nforest as the traveler sometimes stands in a village on the Alps when\r\nthe mist has shrouded everything, and only the squalid hut, the stony\r\nfield, the muddy pathway are in view. But suddenly a wind sweeps the fog\r\naway. Vast fields of radiant snow and sparkling ice lie before him;\r\nprofound abysses open at his feet; and as he lifts his eyes the\r\nunimaginable peak of the Matterhorn cleaves the thin air, far, far\r\nabove. A new and unsuspected world is revealed all about him. Thus it is\r\nthe function of the university to reveal to the individual the mystery\r\nand the glory of life as a whole--to open all the realms of rational\r\nhuman enjoyment and achievement; to preserve the consciousness of the\r\npast; to spread before the eye the beauty of the universe; and to throw\r\nwide its portals of duty and of power to the human soul. It must honor\r\nthe poet and painter, the writer and the teacher, the scientist and the\r\ninventor, the musician and the prophet of righteousness--the men of\r\ngenius in all fields who make life nobler. It must call forth anew, and\r\nfor finer uses, the pioneer's love of creative individualism and provide\r\nfor it a spiritual atmosphere friendly to the development of personality\r\nin all uplifting ways. It must check the tendency to act in mediocre\r\nsocial masses with undue emphasis upon the ideals of prosperity and\r\npolitics. In short, it must summon ability of all kinds to joyous and\r\nearnest effort for the welfare and the spiritual enrichment of society.\r\nIt must awaken new tastes and ambitions among the people.\r\n\r\nThe light of these university watch towers should flash from State to\r\nState until American democracy itself is illuminated with higher and\r\nbroader ideals of what constitutes service to the State and to mankind;\r\nof what are prizes; of what is worthy of praise and reward. So long as\r\nsuccess in amassing great wealth for the aggrandizement of the\r\nindividual is the exclusive or the dominant standard of success, so long\r\nas material prosperity, regardless of the conditions of its cost, or the\r\ncivilization which results, is the shibboleth, American democracy, that\r\nfaith in the common man which the pioneer cherishes, is in danger. For\r\nthe strongest will make their way unerringly to whatever goal society\r\nsets up as the mark of conceded preëminence. What more effective agency\r\nis there for the cultivation of the seed wheat of ideals than the\r\nuniversity? Where can we find a more promising body of sowers of the\r\ngrain?\r\n\r\nThe pioneer's clearing must be broadened into a domain where all that is\r\nworthy of human endeavor may find fertile soil on which to grow; and\r\nAmerica must exact of the constructive business geniuses who owe their\r\nrise to the freedom of pioneer democracy supreme allegiance and devotion\r\nto the commonweal. In fostering such an outcome and in tempering the\r\nasperities of the conflicts that must precede its fulfilment, the nation\r\nhas no more promising agency than the State Universities, no more\r\nhopeful product than their graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[269:1] Commencement Address at the University of Indiana, 1910.\r\n\r\n[270:1] [Printed from an earlier version; since published in his \"Songs\r\nfrom Books,\" p. 93, under the title, \"The Voortrekker.\" Even fuller of\r\ninsight into the idealistic side of the frontier, is his \"Explorer,\" in\r\n\"Collected Verse,\" p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[279:1] Written in 1910.\r\n\r\n[280:1] Omissions from the original are incorporated in later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE WEST AND AMERICAN IDEALS[290:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue to American traditions that each succeeding generation ought to\r\nfind in the Republic a better home, once in every year the colleges and\r\nuniversities summon the nation to lift its eyes from the routine of\r\nwork, in order to take stock of the country's purposes and achievements,\r\nto examine its past and consider its future.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of self-examination is hardly characteristic of the people\r\nas a whole. Particularly it is not characteristic of the historic\r\nAmerican. He has been an opportunist rather than a dealer in general\r\nideas. Destiny set him in a current which bore him swiftly along through\r\nsuch a wealth of opportunity that reflection and well-considered\r\nplanning seemed wasted time. He knew not where he was going, but he was\r\non his way, cheerful, optimistic, busy and buoyant.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are reaching a changed condition, less apparent perhaps, in\r\nthe newer regions than in the old, but sufficiently obvious to extend\r\nthe commencement frame of mind from the college to the country as a\r\nwhole. The swift and inevitable current of the upper reaches of the\r\nnation's history has borne it to the broader expanse and slower\r\nstretches which mark the nearness of the level sea. The vessel, no\r\nlonger carried along by the rushing waters, finds it necessary to\r\ndetermine its own directions on this new ocean of its future, to give\r\nconscious consideration to its motive power and to its steering gear.\r\n\r\nIt matters not so much that those who address these college men and\r\nwomen upon life, give conflicting answers to the questions of whence and\r\nwhither: the pause for remembrance, for reflection and for aspiration is\r\nwholesome in itself.\r\n\r\nAlthough the American people are becoming more self-conscious, more\r\nresponsive to the appeal to act by deliberate choices, we should be\r\nover-sanguine if we believed that even in this new day these\r\ncommencement surveys were taken to heart by the general public, or that\r\nthey were directly and immediately influential upon national thought and\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut even while we check our enthusiasm by this realization of the common\r\nthought, we must take heart. The University's peculiar privilege and\r\ndistinction lie in the fact that it is not the passive instrument of the\r\nState to voice its current ideas. Its problem is not that of expressing\r\ntendencies. Its mission is to create tendencies and to direct them. Its\r\nproblem is that of leadership and of ideals. It is called, of course, to\r\njustify the support which the public gives it, by working in close and\r\nsympathetic touch with those it serves. More than that, it would lose\r\nimportant element of strength if it failed to recognize the fact that\r\nimprovement and creative movement often come from the masses themselves,\r\ninstinctively moving toward a better order. The University's graduates\r\nmust be fitted to take their places naturally and effectually in the\r\ncommon life of the time.\r\n\r\nBut the University is called especially to justify its existence by\r\ngiving to its sons and daughters something which they could not well\r\nhave gotten through the ordinary experiences of the life outside its\r\nwalls. It is called to serve the time by independent research and by\r\noriginal thought. If it were a mere recording instrument of conventional\r\nopinion and average information, it is hard to see why the University\r\nshould exist at all. To clasp hands with the common life in order that\r\nit may lift that life, to be a radiant center enkindling the society in\r\nwhich it has its being, these are primary duties of the University.\r\nFortunate the State which gives free play to this spirit of inquiry. Let\r\nit \"grubstake\" its intellectual prospectors and send them forth where\r\n\"the trails run out and stop.\" A famous scientist holds that the\r\nuniversal ether bears vital germs which impinging upon a dead world\r\nwould bring life to it. So, at least it is, in the world of thought,\r\nwhere energized ideals put in the air and carried here and there by the\r\nwaves and currents of the intellectual atmosphere, fertilize vast inert\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThe University, therefore, has a double duty. On the one hand it must\r\naid in the improvement of the general economic and social environment.\r\nIt must help on in the work of scientific discovery and of making such\r\nconditions of existence, economic, political and social, as will produce\r\nmore fertile and responsive soil for a higher and better life. It must\r\nstimulate a wider demand on the part of the public for right leadership.\r\nIt must extend its operations more widely among the people and sink\r\ndeeper shafts through social strata to find new supplies of intellectual\r\ngold in popular levels yet untouched. And on the other hand, it must\r\nfind and fit men and women for leadership. It must both awaken new\r\ndemands and it must satisfy those demands by trained leaders with new\r\nmotives, with new incentives to ambition, with higher and broader\r\nconception of what constitute the prize in life, of what constitutes\r\nsuccess. The University has to deal with both the soil and sifted seed\r\nin the agriculture of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nIts efficiency is not the efficiency which the business engineer is\r\nfitted to appraise. If it is a training ship, it is a training ship\r\nbound on a voyage of discovery, seeking new horizons. The economy of the\r\nUniversity's consumption can only be rightly measured by the later times\r\nwhich shall possess those new realms of the spirit which its voyage\r\nshall reveal. If the ships of Columbus had engaged in a profitable\r\ncoastwise traffic between Palos and Cadiz they might have saved sail\r\ncloth, but their keels would never have grated on the shores of a New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of the undiscovered is strong in America. For three centuries\r\nthe fundamental process in its history was the westward movement, the\r\ndiscovery and occupation of the vast free spaces of the continent. We\r\nare the first generation of Americans who can look back upon that era as\r\na historic movement now coming to its end. Other generations have been\r\nso much a part of it that they could hardly comprehend its significance.\r\nTo them it seemed inevitable. The free land and the natural resources\r\nseemed practically inexhaustible. Nor were they aware of the fact that\r\ntheir most fundamental traits, their institutions, even their ideals\r\nwere shaped by this interaction between the wilderness and themselves.\r\n\r\nAmerican democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried\r\nin the _Susan Constant_ to Virginia, nor in the _Mayflower_ to Plymouth.\r\nIt came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time\r\nit touched a new frontier. Not the constitution, but free land and an\r\nabundance of natural resources open to a fit people, made the democratic\r\ntype of society in America for three centuries while it occupied its\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are looking with a shock upon a changed world. The national\r\nproblem is no longer how to cut and burn away the vast screen of the\r\ndense and daunting forest; it is how to save and wisely use the\r\nremaining timber. It is no longer how to get the great spaces of\r\nfertile prairie land in humid zones out of the hands of the government\r\ninto the hands of the pioneer; these lands have already passed into\r\nprivate possession. No longer is it a question of how to avoid or cross\r\nthe Great Plains and the arid desert. It is a question of how to conquer\r\nthose rejected lands by new method of farming and by cultivating new\r\ncrops from seed collected by the government and by scientists from the\r\ncold, dry steppes of Siberia, the burning sands of Egypt, and the remote\r\ninterior of China. It is a problem of how to bring the precious rills of\r\nwater on to the alkali and sage brush. Population is increasing faster\r\nthan the food supply.\r\n\r\nNew farm lands no longer increase decade after decade in areas equal to\r\nthose of European states. While the ratio of increase of improved land\r\ndeclines, the value of farm lands rise and the price of food leaps\r\nupward, reversing the old ratio between the two. The cry of scientific\r\nfarming and the conservation of natural resources replaces the cry of\r\nrapid conquest of the wilderness. We have so far won our national home,\r\nwrested from it its first rich treasures, and drawn to it the\r\nunfortunate of other lands, that we are already obliged to compare\r\nourselves with settled states of the Old World. In place of our attitude\r\nof contemptuous indifference to the legislation of such countries as\r\nGermany and England, even Western States like Wisconsin send commissions\r\nto study their systems of taxation, workingmen's insurance, old age\r\npensions and a great variety of other remedies for social ills.\r\n\r\nIf we look about the periphery of the nation, everywhere we see the\r\nindications that our world is changing. On the streets of Northeastern\r\ncities like New York and Boston, the faces which we meet are to a\r\nsurprising extent those of Southeastern Europe. Puritan New England,\r\nwhich turned its capital into factories and mills and drew to its shores\r\nan army of cheap labor, governed these people for a time by a ruling\r\nclass like an upper stratum between which and the lower strata there was\r\nno assimilation. There was no such evolution into an assimilated\r\ncommonwealth as is seen in Middle Western agricultural States, where\r\nimmigrant and old native stock came in together and built up a\r\nhomogeneous society on the principle of give and take. But now the\r\nNortheastern coast finds its destiny, politically and economically,\r\npassing away from the descendants of the Puritans. It is the little\r\nJewish boy, the Greek or the Sicilian, who takes the traveler through\r\nhistoric streets, now the home of these newer people to the Old North\r\nChurch or to Paul Revere's house, or to Tea Wharf, and tells you in his\r\nstrange patois the story of revolution against oppression.\r\n\r\nAlong the Southern Atlantic and the Gulf coast, in spite of the\r\npreservative influence of the negro, whose presence has always called\r\nout resistance to change on the part of the whites, the forces of social\r\nand industrial transformation are at work. The old tidewater aristocracy\r\nhas surrendered to the up-country democrats. Along the line of the\r\nAlleghanies like an advancing column, the forces of Northern capital,\r\ntextile and steel mills, year after year extend their invasion into the\r\nlower South. New Orleans, once the mistress of the commerce of the\r\nMississippi Valley, is awakening to new dreams of world commerce. On the\r\nsouthern border, similar invasions of American capital have been\r\nentering Mexico. At the same time, the opening of the Panama Canal has\r\ncompleted the dream of the ages of the Straits of Anian between Atlantic\r\nand Pacific. Four hundred years ago, Balboa raised the flag of Spain at\r\nthe edge of the Sea of the West and we are now preparing to celebrate\r\nboth that anniversary, and the piercing of the continent. New relations\r\nhave been created between Spanish America and the United States and the\r\nworld is watching the mediation of Argentina, Brazil and Chile between\r\nthe contending forces of Mexico and the Union. Once more alien national\r\ninterests lie threatening at our borders, but we no longer appeal to the\r\nMonroe Doctrine and send our armies of frontiersmen to settle our\r\nconcerns off-hand. We take council with European nations and with the\r\nsisterhood of South America, and propose a remedy of social\r\nreorganization in place of imperious will and force. Whether the effort\r\nwill succeed or not, it is a significant indication that an old order is\r\npassing away, when such a solution is undertaken by a President of\r\nScotch Presbyterian stock, born in the State of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the Northern border, where we are about to celebrate a\r\ncentury of peace with England, we see in progress, like a belated\r\nprocession of our own history the spread of pioneers, the opening of new\r\nwildernesses, the building of new cities, the growth of a new and mighty\r\nnation. That old American advance of the wheat farmer from the\r\nConnecticut to the Mohawk, and the Genesee, from the Great Valley of\r\nPennsylvania to the Ohio Valley and the prairies of the Middle West, is\r\nnow by its own momentum and under the stimulus of Canadian homesteads\r\nand the high price of wheat, carried across the national border to the\r\nonce lone plains where the Hudson Bay dog trains crossed the desolate\r\nsnows of the wild North Land. In the Pacific Northwest the era of\r\nconstruction has not ended, but it is so rapidly in progress that we can\r\nalready see the closing of the age of the pioneer. Already Alaska\r\nbeckons on the north, and pointing to her wealth of natural resources\r\nasks the nation on what new terms the new age will deal with her. Across\r\nthe Pacific looms Asia, no longer a remote vision and a symbol of the\r\nunchanging, but borne as by mirage close to our shores and raising grave\r\nquestions of the common destiny of the people of the ocean. The dreams\r\nof Benton and of Seward of a regenerated Orient, when the long march of\r\nwestward civilization should complete its circle, seem almost to be in\r\nprocess of realization. The age of the Pacific Ocean begins, mysterious\r\nand unfathomable in its meaning for our own future.\r\n\r\nTurning to view the interior, we see the same picture of change. When\r\nthe Superintendent of the Census in 1890 declared the frontier line no\r\nlonger traceable, the beginning of the rush into Oklahoma had just\r\noccurred. Here where the broken fragments of Indian nations from the\r\nEast had been gathered and where the wilder tribes of the Southwest were\r\nbeing settled, came the rush of the land-hungry pioneer. Almost at a\r\nblow the old Indian territory passed away, populous cities came into\r\nbeing and it was not long before gushing oil wells made a new era of\r\nsudden wealth. The farm lands of the Middle West taken as free\r\nhomesteads or bought for a mere pittance, have risen so in value that\r\nthe original owners have in an increasing degree either sold them in\r\norder to reinvest in the newer cheap lands of the West, or have moved\r\ninto the town and have left the tillage to tenant farmers. The growth of\r\nabsentee ownership of the soil is producing a serious problem in the\r\nformer centers of the Granger and the Populist. Along the Old Northwest\r\nthe Great Lakes are becoming a new Mediterranean Sea joining the realms\r\nof wheat and iron ore, at one end with the coal and furnaces of the\r\nforks of the Ohio, where the most intense and wide-reaching center of\r\nindustrial energy exists. City life like that of the East, manufactures\r\nand accumulated capital, seem to be reproducing in the center of the\r\nRepublic the tendencies already so plain on the Atlantic Coast.\r\n\r\nAcross the Great Plains where buffalo and Indian held sway successive\r\nindustrial waves are passing. The old free range gave place to the\r\nranch, the ranch to the homestead and now in places in the arid lands\r\nthe homestead is replaced by the ten or twenty acre irrigated fruit\r\nfarm. The age of cheap land, cheap corn and wheat, and cheap cattle has\r\ngone forever. The federal government has undertaken vast paternal\r\nenterprises of reclamation of the desert.\r\n\r\nIn the Rocky Mountains where at the time of Civil War, the first\r\nimportant rushes to gold and silver mines carried the frontier backward\r\non a march toward the east, the most amazing transformations have\r\noccurred. Here, where prospectors made new trails, and lived the wild\r\nfree life of mountain men, here where the human spirit seemed likely to\r\nattain the largest measure of individual freedom, and where fortune\r\nbeckoned to the common man, have come revolutions wrought by the demand\r\nfor organized industry and capital. In the regions where the popular\r\ntribunal and the free competitive life flourished, we have seen law and\r\norder break down in the unmitigated collision of great aggregations of\r\ncapital, with each other and with organized socialistic labor. The\r\nCripple Creek strikes, the contests at Butte, the Goldfield mobs, the\r\nrecent Colorado fighting, all tell a similar story,--the solid impact of\r\ncontending forces in regions where civic power and loyalty to the State\r\nhave never fully developed. Like the Grand Cañon, where in dazzling\r\nlight the huge geologic history is written so large that none may fail\r\nto read it, so in the Rocky Mountains the dangers of modern American\r\nindustrial tendencies have been exposed.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the Cascades on our way to Seattle, one of the passengers\r\nwas moved to explain his feeling on the excellence of Puget Sound in\r\ncontrast with the remaining visible Universe. He did it well in spite of\r\nirreverent interruptions from those fellow travelers who were\r\nunconverted children of the East, and at last he broke forth in\r\npassionate challenge, \"Why should I not love Seattle! It took me from\r\nthe slums of the Atlantic Coast, a poor Swedish boy with hardly fifteen\r\ndollars in my pocket. It gave me a home by the beautiful sea; it spread\r\nbefore my eyes a vision of snow-capped peaks and smiling fields; it\r\nbrought abundance and a new life to me and my children and I love it, I\r\nlove it! If I were a multi-millionaire I would charter freight cars and\r\ncarry away from the crowded tenements and noisome alleys of the eastern\r\ncities and the Old World the toiling masses, and let them loose in our\r\nvast forests and ore-laden mountains to learn what life really is!\" And\r\nmy heart was stirred by his words and by the whirling spaces of woods\r\nand peaks through which we passed.\r\n\r\nBut as I looked and listened to this passionate outcry, I remembered the\r\nwords of Talleyrand, the exiled Bishop of Autun, in Washington's\r\nadministration. Looking down from an eminence not far from Philadelphia\r\nupon a wilderness which is now in the heart of that huge industrial\r\nsociety where population presses on the means of life, even the\r\ncold-blooded and cynical Talleyrand, gazing on those unpeopled hills and\r\nforests, kindled with the vision of coming clearings, the smiling farms\r\nand grazing herds that were to be, the populous towns that should be\r\nbuilt, the newer and finer social organization that should there arise.\r\nAnd then I remembered the hall in Harvard's museum of social ethics\r\nthrough which I pass to my lecture room when I speak on the history of\r\nthe Westward movement. That hall is covered with an exhibit of the work\r\nin Pittsburgh steel mills, and of the congested tenements. Its charts\r\nand diagrams tell of the long hours of work, the death rate, the\r\nrelation of typhoid to the slums, the gathering of the poor of all\r\nSoutheastern Europe to make a civilization at that center of American\r\nindustrial energy and vast capital that is a social tragedy. As I enter\r\nmy lecture room through that hall, I speak of the young Washington\r\nleading his Virginia frontiersmen to the magnificent forest at the\r\nforks of the Ohio. Where Braddock and his men, \"carving a cross on the\r\nwilderness rim,\" were struck by the painted savages in the primeval\r\nwoods, huge furnaces belch forth perpetual fires and Huns and Bulgars,\r\nPoles and Sicilians struggle for a chance to earn their daily bread, and\r\nlive a brutal and degraded life. Irresistibly there rushed across my\r\nmind the memorable words of Huxley:\r\n\r\n     \"Even the best of modern civilization appears to me to exhibit\r\n     a condition of mankind which neither embodies any worthy ideal\r\n     nor even possesses the merit of stability. I do not hesitate\r\n     to express the opinion that, if there is no hope of a large\r\n     improvement of the condition of the greater part of the human\r\n     family; if it is true that the increase of knowledge, the\r\n     winning of a greater dominion over Nature, which is its\r\n     consequence, and the wealth which follows upon that dominion,\r\n     are to make no difference in the extent and the intensity of\r\n     Want, with its concomitant physical and moral degradation,\r\n     among the masses of the people, I should hail the advent of\r\n     some kindly comet, which would sweep the whole affair away, as\r\n     a desirable consummation.\"\r\n\r\nBut if there is disillusion and shock and apprehension as we come to\r\nrealize these changes, to strong men and women there is challenge and\r\ninspiration in them too. In place of old frontiers of wilderness, there\r\nare new frontiers of unwon fields of science, fruitful for the needs of\r\nthe race; there are frontiers of better social domains yet unexplored.\r\nLet us hold to our attitude of faith and courage, and creative zeal.\r\nLet us dream as our fathers dreamt and let us make our dreams come\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n     \"Daughters of Time, the hypocritic days,\r\n     Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,\r\n     And marching single in an endless file,\r\n     Bear diadems and fagots in their hands.\r\n     To each they offer gifts after his will\r\n     Bread, kingdoms, stars, and sky that hold them all.\r\n     I, in my pleachéd garden watched the pomp,\r\n     Forgot my morning wishes, hastily\r\n     Took a few herbs and apples and the day\r\n     Turned and departed silent. I, too late,\r\n     Under her solemn fillet, saw the scorn!\"\r\n\r\nWhat were America's \"morning wishes\"? From the beginning of that long\r\nwestward march of the American people America has never been the home of\r\nmere contented materialism. It has continuously sought new ways and\r\ndreamed of a perfected social type.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century when men dealt with the New World which\r\nColumbus found, the ideal of discovery was dominant. Here was placed\r\nwithin the reach of men whose ideas had been bounded by the Atlantic,\r\nnew realms to be explored. America became the land of European dreams,\r\nits Fortunate Islands were made real, where, in the imagination of old\r\nEurope, peace and happiness, as well as riches and eternal youth, were\r\nto be found. To Sir Edwin Sandys and his friends of the London Company,\r\nVirginia offered an opportunity to erect the Republic for which they had\r\nlonged in vain in England. To the Puritans, New England was the new land\r\nof freedom, wherein they might establish the institutions of God,\r\naccording to their own faith. As the vision died away in Virginia toward\r\nthe close of the seventeenth century, it was taken up anew by the fiery\r\nBacon with his revolution to establish a real democracy in place of the\r\nrule of the planter aristocracy, that formed along the coast. Hardly\r\nhad he been overthrown when in the eighteenth century, the democratic\r\nideal was rejuvenated by the strong frontiersmen, who pressed beyond the\r\nNew England Coast into the Berkshires and up the valleys of the Green\r\nMountains of Vermont, and by the Scotch-Irish and German pioneers who\r\nfollowed the Great Valley from Pennsylvania into the Upland South. In\r\nboth the Yankee frontiersmen and the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the\r\nSouth, the Calvinistic conception of the importance of the individual,\r\nbound by free covenant to his fellow men and to God, was a compelling\r\ninfluence, and all their wilderness experience combined to emphasize the\r\nideals of opening new ways, of giving freer play to the individual, and\r\nof constructing democratic society.\r\n\r\nWhen the backwoodsmen crossed the Alleghanies they put between\r\nthemselves and the Atlantic Coast a barrier which seemed to separate\r\nthem from a region already too much like the Europe they had left, and\r\nas they followed the courses of the rivers that flowed to the\r\nMississippi, they called themselves \"Men of the Western Waters,\" and\r\ntheir new home in the Mississippi Valley was the \"Western World.\" Here,\r\nby the thirties, Jacksonian democracy flourished, strong in the faith of\r\nthe intrinsic excellence of the common man, in his right to make his own\r\nplace in the world, and in his capacity to share in government. But\r\nwhile Jacksonian democracy demanded these rights, it was also loyal to\r\nleadership as the very name implies. It was ready to follow to the\r\nuttermost the man in whom it placed its trust, whether the hero were\r\nfrontier fighter or president, and it even rebuked and limited its own\r\nlegislative representatives and recalled its senators when they ran\r\ncounter to their chosen executive. Jacksonian democracy was essentially\r\nrural. It was based on the good fellowship and genuine social feeling of\r\nthe frontier, in which classes and inequalities of fortune played\r\nlittle part. But it did not demand equality of condition, for there was\r\nabundance of natural resources and the belief that the self-made man had\r\na right to his success in the free competition which western life\r\nafforded, was as prominent in their thought as was the love of\r\ndemocracy. On the other hand, they viewed governmental restraints with\r\nsuspicion as a limitation on their right to work out their own\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nFor the banking institutions and capitalists of the East they had an\r\ninstinctive antipathy. Already they feared that the \"money power\" as\r\nJackson called it, was planning to make hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater of the common people.\r\n\r\nIn this view they found allies among the labor leaders of the East, who\r\nin the same period began their fight for better conditions of the wage\r\nearner. These Locofocos were the first Americans to demand fundamental\r\nsocial changes for the benefit of the workers in the cities. Like the\r\nWestern pioneers, they protested against monopolies and special\r\nprivilege. But they also had a constructive policy, whereby society was\r\nto be kept democratic by free gifts of the public land, so that surplus\r\nlabor might not bid against itself, but might find an outlet in the\r\nWest. Thus to both the labor theorist and the practical pioneer, the\r\nexistence of what seemed inexhaustible cheap land and unpossessed\r\nresources was the condition of democracy. In these years of the thirties\r\nand forties, Western democracy took on its distinctive form. Travelers\r\nlike De Tocqueville and Harriet Martineau, came to study and to report\r\nit enthusiastically to Europe.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this westward marching army of individualistic\r\nliberty-loving democratic backwoodsmen, went a more northern stream of\r\npioneers, who cherished similar ideas, but added to them the desire to\r\ncreate new industrial centers, to build up factories, to build\r\nrailroads, and to develop the country by founding cities and extending\r\nprosperity. They were ready to call upon legislatures to aid in this, by\r\nsubscriptions to stock, grants of franchises, promotion of banking and\r\ninternal improvements. These were the Whig followers of that other\r\nWestern leader, Henry Clay, and their early strength lay in the Ohio\r\nValley, and particularly among the well-to-do. In the South their\r\nstrength was found among the aristocracy of the Cotton Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBoth of these Western groups, Whigs and Democrats alike, had one common\r\nideal: the desire to leave their children a better heritage than they\r\nthemselves had received, and both were fired with devotion to the ideal\r\nof creating in this New World a home more worthy of mankind. Both were\r\nready to break with the past, to boldly strike out new lines of social\r\nendeavor, and both believed in American expansion.\r\n\r\nBefore these tendencies had worked themselves out, three new forces\r\nentered. In the sudden extension of our boundaries to the Pacific Coast,\r\nwhich took place in the forties, the nation won so vast a domain that\r\nits resources seemed illimitable and its society seemed able to throw\r\noff all its maladies by the very presence of these vast new spaces. At\r\nthe same period the great activity of railroad building to the\r\nMississippi Valley occurred, making these lands available and diverting\r\nattention to the task of economic construction. The third influence was\r\nthe slavery question which, becoming acute, shaped the American ideals\r\nand public discussion for nearly a generation. Viewed from one angle,\r\nthis struggle involved the great question of national unity. From\r\nanother it involved the question of the relations of labor and capital,\r\ndemocracy and aristocracy. It was not without significance that Abraham\r\nLincoln became the very type of American pioneer democracy, the first\r\nadequate and elemental demonstration to the world that that democracy\r\ncould produce a man who belonged to the ages.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, new national energies were set loose, and new\r\nconstruction and development engaged the attention of the Westerners as\r\nthey occupied prairies and Great Plains and mountains. Democracy and\r\ncapitalistic development did not seem antagonistic.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the frontier, Western social and political ideals\r\ntook new form. Capital began to consolidate in even greater masses, and\r\nincreasingly attempted to reduce to system and control the processes of\r\nindustrial development. Labor with equal step organized its forces to\r\ndestroy the old competitive system. It is not strange that the Western\r\npioneers took alarm for their ideals of democracy as the outcome of the\r\nfree struggle for the national resources became apparent. They espoused\r\nthe cause of governmental activity.\r\n\r\nIt was a new gospel, for the Western radical became convinced that he\r\nmust sacrifice his ideal of individualism and free competition in order\r\nto maintain his ideal of democracy. Under this conviction the Populist\r\nrevised the pioneer conception of government. He saw in government no\r\nlonger something outside of him, but the people themselves shaping their\r\nown affairs. He demanded therefore an extension of the powers of\r\ngovernments in the interest of his historic ideal of democratic society.\r\nHe demanded not only free silver, but the ownership of the agencies of\r\ncommunication and transportation, the income tax, the postal savings\r\nbank, the provision of means of credit for agriculture, the construction\r\nof more effective devices to express the will of the people, primary\r\nnominations, direct elections, initiative, referendum and recall. In a\r\nword, capital, labor, and the Western pioneer, all deserted the ideal of\r\ncompetitive individualism in order to organize their interests in more\r\neffective combinations. The disappearance of the frontier, the closing\r\nof the era which was marked by the influence of the West as a form of\r\nsociety, brings with it new problems of social adjustment, new demands\r\nfor considering our past ideals and our present needs.\r\n\r\nLet us recall the conditions of the foreign relations along our borders,\r\nthe dangers that wait us if we fail to unite in the solution of our\r\ndomestic problems. Let us recall those internal evidences of the\r\ndestruction of our old social order. If we take to heart this warning,\r\nwe shall do well also to recount our historic ideals, to take stock of\r\nthose purposes, and fundamental assumptions that have gone to make the\r\nAmerican spirit and the meaning of America in world history.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there was the ideal of discovery, the courageous\r\ndetermination to break new paths, indifference to the dogma that because\r\nan institution or a condition exists, it must remain. All American\r\nexperience has gone to the making of the spirit of innovation; it is in\r\nthe blood and will not be repressed.\r\n\r\nThen, there was the ideal of democracy, the ideal of a free\r\nself-directing people, responsive to leadership in the forming of\r\nprograms and their execution, but insistent that the procedure should be\r\nthat of free choice, not of compulsion.\r\n\r\nBut there was also the ideal of individualism. This democratic society\r\nwas not a disciplined army, where all must keep step and where the\r\ncollective interests destroyed individual will and work. Rather it was a\r\nmobile mass of freely circulating atoms, each seeking its own place and\r\nfinding play for its own powers and for its own original initiative. We\r\ncannot lay too much stress upon this point, for it was at the very heart\r\nof the whole American movement. The world was to be made a better world\r\nby the example of a democracy in which there was freedom of the\r\nindividual, in which there was the vitality and mobility productive of\r\noriginality and variety.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the far-reaching influence of the disappearance of\r\nunlimited resources open to all men for the taking, and considering the\r\nrecoil of the common man when he saw the outcome of the competitive\r\nstruggle for these resources as the supply came to its end over most of\r\nthe nation, we can understand the reaction against individualism and in\r\nfavor of drastic assertion of the powers of government. Legislation is\r\ntaking the place of the free lands as the means of preserving the ideal\r\nof democracy. But at the same time it is endangering the other pioneer\r\nideal of creative and competitive individualism. Both were essential and\r\nconstituted what was best in America's contribution to history and to\r\nprogress. Both must be preserved if the nation would be true to its\r\npast, and would fulfil its highest destiny. It would be a grave\r\nmisfortune if these people so rich in experience, in self-confidence and\r\naspiration, in creative genius, should turn to some Old World discipline\r\nof socialism or plutocracy, or despotic rule, whether by class or by\r\ndictator. Nor shall we be driven to these alternatives. Our ancient\r\nhopes, our courageous faith, our underlying good humor and love of fair\r\nplay will triumph in the end. There will be give and take in all\r\ndirections. There will be disinterested leadership, under loyalty to the\r\nbest American ideals. Nowhere is this leadership more likely to arise\r\nthan among the men trained in the Universities, aware of the promise of\r\nthe past and the possibilities of the future. The times call for new\r\nambitions and new motives.\r\n\r\nIn a most suggestive essay on the Problems of Modern Democracy, Mr.\r\nGodkin has said:\r\n\r\n     M. de Tocqueville and all his followers take it for granted\r\n     that the great incentive to excellence, in all countries in\r\n     which excellence is found, is the patronage and encouragement\r\n     of an aristocracy; that democracy is generally content with\r\n     mediocrity. But where is the proof of this? The incentive to\r\n     exertion which is widest, most constant, and most powerful in\r\n     its operations in all civilized countries, is the desire of\r\n     distinction; and this may be composed either of love of fame\r\n     or love of wealth or of both. In literary and artistic and\r\n     scientific pursuits, sometimes the strongest influence is\r\n     exerted by a love of the subject. But it may safely be said\r\n     that no man has ever labored in any of the higher colleges to\r\n     whom the applause and appreciation of his fellows was not one\r\n     of the sweetest rewards of his exertions.\r\n\r\n     What is there we would ask, in the nature of democratic\r\n     institutions, that should render this great spring of action\r\n     powerless, that should deprive glory of all radiance, and put\r\n     ambition to sleep? Is it not notorious, on the contrary, that\r\n     one of the most marked peculiarities of democratic society, or\r\n     of a society drifting toward democracy, is the fire of\r\n     competition which rages in it, the fevered anxiety which\r\n     possesses all its members to rise above the dead level to\r\n     which the law is ever seeking to confine them, and by some\r\n     brilliant stroke become something higher and more remarkable\r\n     than their fellows? The secret of that great restlessness\r\n     which is one of the most disagreeable accompaniments of life\r\n     in democratic countries, is in fact due to the eagerness of\r\n     everybody to grasp the prizes of which in aristocratic\r\n     countries, only the few have much chance. And in no other\r\n     society is success more worshiped, is distinction of any kind\r\n     more widely flattered and caressed.\r\n\r\n     In democratic societies, in fact, excellence is the first\r\n     title to distinction; in aristocratic ones there are two or\r\n     three others which are far stronger and which must be stronger\r\n     or aristocracy could not exist. The moment you acknowledge\r\n     that the highest social position ought to be the reward of the\r\n     man who has the most talent, you make aristocratic\r\n     institutions impossible.\r\n\r\nAll that was buoyant and creative in American life would be lost if we\r\ngave up the respect for distinct personality, and variety in genius, and\r\ncame to the dead level of common standards. To be \"socialized into an\r\naverage\" and placed \"under the tutelage of the mass of us,\" as a recent\r\nwriter has put it, would be an irreparable loss. Nor is it necessary in\r\na democracy, as these words of Godkin well disclose. What is needed is\r\nthe multiplication of motives for ambition and the opening of new lines\r\nof achievement for the strongest. As we turn from the task of the first\r\nrough conquest of the continent there lies before us a whole wealth of\r\nunexploited resources in the realm of the spirit. Arts and letters,\r\nscience and better social creation, loyalty and political service to the\r\ncommonweal,--these and a thousand other directions of activity are open\r\nto the men, who formerly under the incentive of attaining distinction by\r\namassing extraordinary wealth, saw success only in material display.\r\nNewer and finer careers will open to the ambitious when once public\r\nopinion shall award the laurels to those who rise above their fellows in\r\nthese new fields of labor. It has not been the gold, but the getting of\r\nthe gold, that has caught the imaginations of our captains of industry.\r\nTheir real enjoyment lay not in the luxuries which wealth brought, but\r\nin the work of construction and in the place which society awarded them.\r\nA new era will come if schools and universities can only widen the\r\nintellectual horizon of the people, help to lay the foundations of a\r\nbetter industrial life, show them new goals for endeavor, inspire them\r\nwith more varied and higher ideals.\r\n\r\nThe Western spirit must be invoked for new and nobler achievements. Of\r\nthat matured Western spirit, Tennyson's Ulysses is a symbol.\r\n\r\n     \". . . I am become a name\r\n     For always roaming with an hungry heart,\r\n     Much have I seen and known . . .\r\n     I am a part of all that I have met;\r\n     Yet all experience is an arch, where thro'\r\n     Gleams that untravelled world, whose margin fades\r\n     Forever and forever when I move.\r\n     How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\r\n     To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     And this gray spirit yearning in desire\r\n     To follow knowledge like a shining star\r\n     Beyond the utmost hound of human thought.\r\n     . . .

The revolution in the social and economic structure of this\r\ncountry during the past two decades is comparable to what occurred when\r\nindependence was declared and the constitution was formed, or to the\r\nchanges wrought by the era which began half a century ago, the era of\r\nCivil War and Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThese changes have been long in preparation and are, in part, the result\r\nof world-wide forces of reorganization incident to the age of steam\r\nproduction and large-scale industry, and, in part, the result of the\r\nclosing of the period of the colonization of the West. They have been\r\nprophesied, and the course of the movement partly described by students\r\nof American development; but after all, it is with a shock that the\r\npeople of the United States are coming to realize that the fundamental\r\nforces which have shaped their society up to the present are\r\ndisappearing. Twenty years ago, as I have before had occasion to point\r\nout, the Superintendent of the Census declared that the frontier line,\r\nwhich its maps had depicted for decade after decade of the westward\r\nmarch of the nation, could no longer be described. To-day we must add\r\nthat the age of free competition of individuals for the unpossessed\r\nresources of the nation is nearing its end. It is taking less than a\r\ngeneration to write the chapter which began with the disappearance of\r\nthe line of the frontier--the last chapter in the history of the\r\ncolonization of the United States, the conclusion to the annals of its\r\npioneer democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful chapter, this final rush of American energy upon the\r\nremaining wilderness. Even the bare statistics become eloquent of a new\r\nera. They no longer derive their significance from the exhibit of vast\r\nproportions of the public domain transferred to agriculture, of\r\nwildernesses equal to European nations changed decade after decade into\r\nthe farm area of the United States. It is true there was added to the\r\nfarms of the nation between 1870 and 1880 a territory equal to that of\r\nFrance, and between 1880 and 1900 a territory equal to the European area\r\nof France, Germany, England, and Wales combined. The records of 1910 are\r\nnot yet available, but whatever they reveal they will not be so full of\r\nmeaning as the figures which tell of upleaping wealth and organization\r\nand concentration of industrial power in the East in the last decade. As\r\nthe final provinces of the Western empire have been subdued to the\r\npurposes of civilization and have yielded their spoils, as the spheres\r\nof operation of the great industrial corporations have extended, with\r\nthe extension of American settlement, production and wealth have\r\nincreased beyond all precedent.\r\n\r\nThe total deposits in all national banks have more than trebled in the\r\npresent decade; the money in circulation has doubled since 1890. The\r\nflood of gold makes it difficult to gage the full meaning of the\r\nincredible increase in values, for in the decade ending with 1909 over\r\n41,600,000 ounces of gold were mined in the United States alone. Over\r\nfour million ounces have been produced every year since 1905, whereas\r\nbetween 1880 and 1894 no year showed a production of two million ounces.\r\nAs a result of this swelling stream of gold and instruments of credit,\r\naided by a variety of other causes, prices have risen until their height\r\nhas become one of the most marked features and influential factors in\r\nAmerican life, producing social readjustments and contributing\r\neffectively to party revolutions.\r\n\r\nBut if we avoid those statistics which require analysis because of the\r\nchanging standard of value, we still find that the decade occupies an\r\nexceptional place in American history. More coal was mined in the United\r\nStates in the ten years after 1897 than in all the life of the nation\r\nbefore that time.[313:1] Fifty years ago we mined less than fifteen\r\nmillion long tons of coal. In 1907 we mined nearly 429,000,000. At the\r\npresent rate it is estimated that the supply of coal would be exhausted\r\nat a date no farther in the future than the formation of the\r\nconstitution is in the past. Iron and coal are the measures of\r\nindustrial power. The nation has produced three times as much iron ore\r\nin the past two decades as in all its previous history; the production\r\nof the past ten years was more than double that of the prior decade.\r\nPig-iron production is admitted to be an excellent barometer of\r\nmanufacture and of transportation. Never until 1898 had this reached an\r\nannual total of ten million long tons. But in the five years beginning\r\nwith 1904 it averaged over twice that. By 1907 the United States had\r\nsurpassed Great Britain, Germany, and France combined in the production\r\nof pig-iron and steel together, and in the same decade a single great\r\ncorporation has established its domination over the iron mines and steel\r\nmanufacture of the United States. It is more than a mere accident that\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation with its stocks and bonds\r\naggregating $1,400,000,000 was organized at the beginning of the present\r\ndecade. The former wilderness about Lake Superior has, principally in\r\nthe past two decades, established its position as overwhelmingly the\r\npreponderant source of iron ore, present and prospective, in the United\r\nStates--a treasury from which Pittsburgh has drawn wealth and extended\r\nits unparalleled industrial empire in these years. The tremendous\r\nenergies thus liberated at this center of industrial power in the United\r\nStates revolutionized methods of manufacture in general, and in many\r\nindirect ways profoundly influenced the life of the nation.\r\n\r\nRailroad statistics also exhibit unprecedented development, the\r\nformation of a new industrial society. The number of passengers carried\r\none mile more than doubled between 1890 and 1908; freight carried one\r\nmile has nearly trebled in the same period and has doubled in the past\r\ndecade. Agricultural products tell a different story. The corn crop has\r\nonly risen from about two billion bushels in 1891 to two and\r\nseven-tenths billions in 1909; wheat from six hundred and eleven million\r\nbushels in 1891 to only seven hundred and thirty-seven million in 1909;\r\nand cotton from about nine million bales in 1891 to ten and three-tenths\r\nmillion bales in 1909. Population has increased in the United States\r\nproper from about sixty-two and one-half millions in 1890 to\r\nseventy-five and one-half millions in 1900 and to over ninety millions\r\nin 1910.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from these statistics that the ratio of the nation's\r\nincreased production of immediate wealth by the enormously increased\r\nexploitation of its remaining natural resources vastly exceeds the ratio\r\nof increase of population and still more strikingly exceeds the ratio of\r\nincrease of agricultural products. Already population is pressing upon\r\nthe food supply while capital consolidates in billion-dollar\r\norganizations. The \"Triumphant Democracy\" whose achievements the\r\niron-master celebrated has reached a stature even more imposing than he\r\ncould have foreseen; but still less did he perceive the changes in\r\ndemocracy itself and the conditions of its life which have accompanied\r\nthis material growth.\r\n\r\nHaving colonized the Far West, having mastered its internal resources,\r\nthe nation turned at the conclusion of the nineteenth and the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century to deal with the Far East to engage in the\r\nworld-politics of the Pacific Ocean. Having continued its historic\r\nexpansion into the lands of the old Spanish empire by the successful\r\noutcome of the recent war, the United States became the mistress of the\r\nPhilippines at the same time that it came into possession of the\r\nHawaiian Islands, and the controlling influence in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nIt provided early in the present decade for connecting its Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts by the Isthmian Canal, and became an imperial republic\r\nwith dependencies and protectorates--admittedly a new world-power, with\r\na potential voice in the problems of Europe, Asia, and Africa.\r\n\r\nThis extension of power, this undertaking of grave responsibilities in\r\nnew fields, this entry into the sisterhood of world-states, was no\r\nisolated event. It was, indeed, in some respects the logical outcome of\r\nthe nation's march to the Pacific, the sequence to the era in which it\r\nwas engaged in occupying the free lands and exploiting the resources of\r\nthe West. When it had achieved this position among the nations of the\r\nearth, the United States found itself confronted, also, with the need of\r\nconstitutional readjustment, arising from the relations of federal\r\ngovernment and territorial acquisitions. It was obliged to reconsider\r\nquestions of the rights of man and traditional American ideals of\r\nliberty and democracy, in view of the task of government of other races\r\npolitically inexperienced and undeveloped.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to consider the effect upon American society and domestic\r\npolicy in these two decades of transition we are met with palpable\r\nevidences of the invasion of the old pioneer democratic order. Obvious\r\namong them is the effect of unprecedented immigration to supply the\r\nmobile army of cheap labor for the centers of industrial life. In the\r\npast ten years, beginning with 1900, over eight million immigrants have\r\narrived. The newcomers of the eight years since 1900 would, according to\r\na writer in 1908, \"repopulate all the five older New England States as\r\nthey stand to-day; or, if properly disseminated over the newer parts of\r\nthe country they would serve to populate no less than nineteen states of\r\nthe Union as they stand.\" In 1907 \"there were one and one-quarter\r\nmillion arrivals. This number would entirely populate both New Hampshire\r\nand Maine, two of our oldest States.\" \"The arrivals of this one year\r\nwould found a State with more inhabitants than any one of twenty-one of\r\nour other existing commonwealths which could be named.\" Not only has the\r\naddition to the population from Europe been thus extraordinary, it has\r\ncome in increasing measure from southern and eastern Europe. For the\r\nyear 1907, Professor Ripley,[316:1] whom I am quoting, has redistributed\r\nthe incomers on the basis of physical type and finds that one-quarter of\r\nthem were of the Mediterranean race, one-quarter of the Slavic race,\r\none-eighth Jewish, and only one-sixth of the Alpine, and one-sixth of\r\nthe Teutonic. In 1882 Germans had come to the amount of 250,000; in 1907\r\nthey were replaced by 330,000 South Italians. Thus it is evident that\r\nthe ethnic elements of the United States have undergone startling\r\nchanges; and instead of spreading over the nation these immigrants have\r\nconcentrated especially in the cities and great industrial centers in\r\nthe past decade. The composition of the labor class and its relation to\r\nwages and to the native American employer have been deeply influenced\r\nthereby; the sympathy of the employers with labor has been unfavorably\r\naffected by the pressure of great numbers of immigrants of alien\r\nnationality and of lower standards of life.\r\n\r\nThe familiar facts of the massing of population in the cities and the\r\ncontemporaneous increase of urban power, and of the massing of capital\r\nand production in fewer and vastly greater industrial units, especially\r\nattest the revolution. \"It is a proposition too plain to require\r\nelucidation,\" wrote Richard Rush, Secretary of the Treasury, in his\r\nreport of 1827, \"that the creation of capital is retarded rather than\r\naccelerated by the diffusion of a thin population over a great surface\r\nof soil.\"[317:1] Thirty years before Rush wrote these words Albert\r\nGallatin declared in Congress that \"if the cause of the happiness of\r\nthis country were examined into, it would be found to arise as much from\r\nthe great plenty of land in proportion to the inhabitants which their\r\ncitizens enjoyed as from the wisdom of their political institutions.\"\r\nPossibly both of these Pennsylvania financiers were right under the\r\nconditions of the time; but it is at least significant that capital and\r\nlabor entered upon a new era as the end of the free lands approached. A\r\ncontemporary of Gallatin in Congress had replied to the argument that\r\ncheap lands would depopulate the Atlantic coast by saying that if a law\r\nwere framed to prevent ready access to western lands it would be\r\ntantamount to saying that there is some class which must remain \"and by\r\nlaw be obliged to serve the others for such wages as they pleased to\r\ngive.\" The passage of the arable public domain into private possession\r\nhas raised this question in a new form and has brought forth new\r\nanswers. This is peculiarly the era when competitive individualism in\r\nthe midst of vast unappropriated opportunities changed into the\r\nmonopoly of the fundamental industrial processes by huge aggregations of\r\ncapital as the free lands disappeared. All the tendencies of the\r\nlarge-scale production of the twentieth century, all the trend to the\r\nmassing of capital in large combinations, all of the energies of the age\r\nof steam, found in America exceptional freedom of action and were\r\noffered regions of activity equal to the states of all Western Europe.\r\nHere they reached their highest development.\r\n\r\nThe decade following 1897 is marked by the work of Mr. Harriman and his\r\nrivals in building up the various railroads into a few great groups, a\r\nprocess that had gone so far that before his death Mr. Harriman was\r\nambitious to concentrate them all under his single control. High finance\r\nunder the leadership of Mr. Morgan steadily achieved the consolidation\r\nof the greater industries into trusts or combinations and effected a\r\ncommunity of interests between them and a few dominant banking\r\norganizations, with allied insurance companies and trust companies. In\r\nNew York City have been centered, as never before, the banking reserves\r\nof the nation, and here, by the financial management of capital and\r\nspeculative promotion, there has grown up a unified control over the\r\nnation's industrial life. Colossal private fortunes have arisen. No\r\nlonger is the per capita wealth of the nation a real index to the\r\nprosperity of the average man. Labor on the other hand has shown an\r\nincreasing self-consciousness, is combining and increasing its demands.\r\nIn a word, the old pioneer individualism is disappearing, while the\r\nforces of social combination are manifesting themselves as never before.\r\nThe self-made man has become, in popular speech, the coal baron, the\r\nsteel king, the oil king, the cattle king, the railroad magnate, the\r\nmaster of high finance, the monarch of trusts. The world has never\r\nbefore seen such huge fortunes exercising combined control over the\r\neconomic life of a people, and such luxury as has come out of the\r\nindividualistic pioneer democracy of America in the course of\r\ncompetitive evolution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the masters of industry, who control interests which\r\nrepresent billions of dollars, do not admit that they have broken with\r\npioneer ideals. They regard themselves as pioneers under changed\r\nconditions, carrying on the old work of developing the natural resources\r\nof the nation, compelled by the constructive fever in their veins, even\r\nin ill-health and old age and after the accumulation of wealth beyond\r\ntheir power to enjoy, to seek new avenues of action and of power, to\r\nchop new clearings, to find new trails, to expand the horizon of the\r\nnation's activity, and to extend the scope of their dominion. \"This\r\ncountry,\" said the late Mr. Harriman in an interview a few years ago,\r\n\"has been developed by a wonderful people, flush with enthusiasm,\r\nimagination and speculative bent. . . . They have been magnificent\r\npioneers. They saw into the future and adapted their work to the\r\npossibilities. . . . Stifle that enthusiasm, deaden that imagination and\r\nprohibit that speculation by restrictive and cramping conservative law,\r\nand you tend to produce a moribund and conservative people and country.\"\r\nThis is an appeal to the historic ideals of Americans who viewed the\r\nrepublic as the guardian of individual freedom to compete for the\r\ncontrol of the natural resources of the nation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have the voice of the insurgent West, recently\r\ngiven utterance in the New Nationalism of ex-President Roosevelt,\r\ndemanding increase of federal authority to curb the special interests,\r\nthe powerful industrial organizations, and the monopolies, for the sake\r\nof the conservation of our natural resources and the preservation of\r\nAmerican democracy.\r\n\r\nThe past decade has witnessed an extraordinary federal activity in\r\nlimiting individual and corporate freedom for the benefit of society. To\r\nthat decade belong the conservation congresses and the effective\r\norganization of the Forest Service, and the Reclamation Service. Taken\r\ntogether these developments alone would mark a new era, for over three\r\nhundred million acres are, as a result of this policy, reserved from\r\nentry and sale, an area more than equal to that of all the states which\r\nestablished the constitution, if we exclude their western claims; and\r\nthese reserved lands are held for a more beneficial use of their\r\nforests, minerals, arid tracts, and water rights, by the nation as a\r\nwhole. Another example is the extension of the activity of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, which seeks the remotest regions of the earth\r\nfor crops suitable to the areas reclaimed by the government, maps and\r\nanalyzes the soils, fosters the improvement of seeds and animals, tells\r\nthe farmer when and how and what to plant, and makes war upon diseases\r\nof plants and animals and insect pests. The recent legislation for pure\r\nfood and meat inspection, and the whole mass of regulative law under the\r\nInterstate Commerce clause of the constitution, further illustrates the\r\nsame tendency.\r\n\r\nTwo ideals were fundamental in traditional American thought, ideals that\r\ndeveloped in the pioneer era. One was that of individual freedom to\r\ncompete unrestrictedly for the resources of a continent--the squatter\r\nideal. To the pioneer government was an evil. The other was the ideal of\r\na democracy--\"government of the people, by the people and for the\r\npeople.\" The operation of these ideals took place contemporaneously with\r\nthe passing into private possession of the free public domain and the\r\nnatural resources of the United States. But American democracy was based\r\non an abundance of free lands; these were the very conditions that\r\nshaped its growth and its fundamental traits. Thus time has revealed\r\nthat these two ideals of pioneer democracy had elements of mutual\r\nhostility and contained the seeds of its dissolution. The present finds\r\nitself engaged in the task of readjusting its old ideals to new\r\nconditions and is turning increasingly to government to preserve its\r\ntraditional democracy. It is not surprising that socialism shows\r\nnoteworthy gains as elections continue; that parties are forming on new\r\nlines; that the demand for primary elections, for popular choice of\r\nsenators, initiative, referendum, and recall, is spreading, and that the\r\nregions once the center of pioneer democracy exhibit these tendencies in\r\nthe most marked degree. They are efforts to find substitutes for that\r\nformer safeguard of democracy, the disappearing free lands. They are the\r\nsequence to the extinction of the frontier.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary next to notice that in the midst of all this national\r\nenergy, and contemporaneous with the tendency to turn to the national\r\ngovernment for protection to democracy, there is clear evidence of the\r\npersistence and the development of sectionalism.[321:1] Whether we\r\nobserve the grouping of votes in Congress and in general elections, or\r\nthe organization and utterances of business leaders, or the association\r\nof scholars, churches, or other representatives of the things of the\r\nspirit, we find that American life is not only increasing in its\r\nnational intensity but that it is integrating by sections. In part this\r\nis due to the factor of great spaces which make sectional rather than\r\nnational organization the line of least resistance; but, in part, it is\r\nalso the expression of the separate economic, political, and social\r\ninterests and the separate spiritual life of the various geographic\r\nprovinces or sections. The votes on the tariff, and in general the\r\nlocation of the strongholds of the Progressive Republican movement,\r\nillustrate this fact. The difficulty of a national adjustment of railway\r\nrates to the diverse interests of different sections is another\r\nexample. Without attempting to enter upon a more extensive discussion of\r\nsectionalism, I desire simply to point out that there are evidences that\r\nnow, as formerly, the separate geographical interests have their leaders\r\nand spokesmen, that much Congressional legislation is determined by the\r\ncontests, triumphs, or compromises between the rival sections, and that\r\nthe real federal relations of the United States are shaped by the\r\ninterplay of sectional with national forces rather than by the relation\r\nof State and Nation. As time goes on and the nation adjusts itself more\r\ndurably to the conditions of the differing geographic sections which\r\nmake it up, they are coming to a new self-consciousness and a revived\r\nself-assertion. Our national character is a composite of these\r\nsections.[322:1]\r\n\r\nObviously in attempting to indicate even a portion of the significant\r\nfeatures of our recent history we have been obliged to take note of a\r\ncomplex of forces. The times are so close at hand that the relations\r\nbetween events and tendencies force themselves upon our attention. We\r\nhave had to deal with the connections of geography, industrial growth,\r\npolitics, and government. With these we must take into consideration the\r\nchanging social composition, the inherited beliefs and habitual attitude\r\nof the masses of the people, the psychology of the nation and of the\r\nseparate sections, as well as of the leaders. We must see how these\r\nleaders are shaped partly by their time and section, and how they are in\r\npart original, creative, by virtue of their own genius and initiative.\r\nWe cannot neglect the moral tendencies and the ideals. All are related\r\nparts of the same subject and can no more be properly understood in\r\nisolation than the movement as a whole can be understood by neglecting\r\nsome of these important factors, or by the use of a single method of\r\ninvestigation. Whatever be the truth regarding European history,\r\nAmerican history is chiefly concerned with social forces, shaping and\r\nreshaping under the conditions of a nation changing as it adjusts to its\r\nenvironment. And this environment progressively reveals new aspects of\r\nitself, exerts new influences, and calls out new social organs and\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nI have undertaken this rapid survey of recent history for two purposes.\r\nFirst, because it has seemed fitting to emphasize the significance of\r\nAmerican development since the passing of the frontier, and, second,\r\nbecause in the observation of present conditions we may find assistance\r\nin our study of the past.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar doctrine that each age studies its history anew and\r\nwith interests determined by the spirit of the time. Each age finds it\r\nnecessary to reconsider at least some portion of the past, from points\r\nof view furnished by new conditions which reveal the influence and\r\nsignificance of forces not adequately known by the historians of the\r\nprevious generation. Unquestionably each investigator and writer is\r\ninfluenced by the times in which he lives and while this fact exposes\r\nthe historian to a bias, at the same time it affords him new instruments\r\nand new insight for dealing with his subject.\r\n\r\nIf recent history, then, gives new meaning to past events, if it has to\r\ndeal with the rise into a commanding position of forces, the origin and\r\ngrowth of which may have been inadequately described or even overlooked\r\nby historians of the previous generation, it is important to study the\r\npresent and the recent past, not only for themselves but also as the\r\nsource of new hypotheses, new lines of inquiry, new criteria of the\r\nperspective of the remoter past. And, moreover, a just public opinion\r\nand a statesmanlike treatment of present problems demand that they be\r\nseen in their historical relations in order that history may hold the\r\nlamp for conservative reform.\r\n\r\nSeen from the vantage-ground of present developments what new light\r\nfalls upon past events! When we consider what the Mississippi Valley has\r\ncome to be in American life, and when we consider what it is yet to be,\r\nthe young Washington, crossing the snows of the wilderness to summon the\r\nFrench to evacuate the portals of the great valley, becomes the herald\r\nof an empire. When we recall the huge industrial power that has centered\r\nat Pittsburgh, Braddock's advance to the forks of the Ohio takes on new\r\nmeaning. Even in defeat, he opened a road to what is now the center of\r\nthe world's industrial energy. The modifications which England proposed\r\nin 1794 to John Jay in the northwestern boundary of the United States\r\nfrom the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi, seemed to him, doubtless,\r\nsignificant chiefly as a matter of principle and as a question of the\r\nretention or loss of beaver grounds. The historians hardly notice the\r\nproposals. But they involved, in fact, the ownership of the richest and\r\nmost extensive deposits of iron ore in America, the all-important source\r\nof a fundamental industry of the United States, the occasion for the\r\nrise of some of the most influential forces of our time.\r\n\r\nWhat continuity and meaning are furnished by the outcome in present\r\ntimes of the movements of minor political parties and reform agitations!\r\nTo the historian they have often seemed to be mere curious side eddies,\r\nvexatious distractions to the course of his literary craft as it\r\nnavigated the stream of historical tendency. And yet, by the revelation\r\nof the present, what seemed to be side eddies have not seldom proven to\r\nbe the concealed entrances to the main current, and the course which\r\nseemed the central one has led to blind channels and stagnant waters,\r\nimportant in their day, but cut off like oxbow lakes from the mighty\r\nriver of historical progress by the mere permanent and compelling forces\r\nof the neglected currents.\r\n\r\nWe may trace the contest between the capitalist and the democratic\r\npioneer from the earliest colonial days. It is influential in colonial\r\nparties. It is seen in the vehement protests of Kentucky frontiersmen in\r\npetition after petition to the Congress of the Confederation against the\r\n\"nabobs\" and men of wealth who took out titles to the pioneers' farms\r\nwhile they themselves were too busy defending those farms from the\r\nIndians to perfect their claims. It is seen in the attitude of the Ohio\r\nValley in its backwoods days before the rise of the Whig party, as when\r\nin 1811 Henry Clay denounced the Bank of the United States as a\r\ncorporation which throve on special privileges--\"a special association\r\nof favored individuals taken from the mass of society, and invested with\r\nexemptions and surrounded by immunities and privileges.\" Benton voiced\r\nthe same contest twenty years later when he denounced the bank as\r\n\r\n     a company of private individuals, many of them foreigners, and\r\n     the mass of them residing in a remote and narrow corner of the\r\n     Union, unconnected by any sympathy with the fertile regions of\r\n     the Great Valley in which the natural power of this Union, the\r\n     power of numbers, will be found to reside long before the\r\n     renewed term of the second charter would expire.\r\n\r\n\"And where,\" he asked, \"would all this power and money center? In the\r\ngreat cities of the Northeast, which have been for forty years and that\r\nby force of federal legislation, the lion's den of Southern and Western\r\nmoney--that den into which all the tracks point inward; from which the\r\nreturning track of a solitary dollar has never yet been seen.\"\r\nDeclaring, in words that have a very modern sound, that the bank tended\r\nto multiply nabobs and paupers, and that \"a great moneyed power is\r\nfavorable to great capitalists, for it is the principle of capital to\r\nfavor capital,\" he appealed to the fact of the country's extent and its\r\nsectional divergences against the nationalizing of capital.\r\n\r\n     What a condition for a confederacy of states! What grounds for\r\n     alarm and terrible apprehension when in a confederacy of such\r\n     vast extent, so many rival commercial cities, so much\r\n     sectional jealousy, such violent political parties, such\r\n     fierce contests for power, there should be but one moneyed\r\n     tribunal before which all the rival and contending elements\r\n     must appear.\r\n\r\nEven more vehement were the words of Jackson in 1837. \"It is now plain,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"that the war is to be carried on by the monied aristocracy of\r\nthe few against the democracy of numbers; the [prosperous] to make the\r\nhonest laborers hewers of wood and drawers of water through the credit\r\nand paper system.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren's administration is usually passed hastily over with hardly\r\nmore than mention of his Independent Treasury plan, and with particular\r\nconsideration of the slavery discussion. But some of the most important\r\nmovements in American social and political history began in these years\r\nof Jackson and Van Buren. Read the demands of the obscure labor papers\r\nand the reports of labor's open-air meetings anew, and you will find in\r\nthe utterances of so-called labor visionaries and the Locofoco champions\r\nof \"equal rights for all and special privileges for none,\" like Evans\r\nand Jacques, Byrdsall and Leggett, the finger points to the currents\r\nthat now make the main channel of our history; you will find in them\r\nsome of the important planks of the platforms of the triumphant parties\r\nof our own day. As Professor Commons has shown by his papers and the\r\ndocuments which he has published on labor history, an idealistic but\r\nwidespread and influential humanitarian movement, strikingly similar to\r\nthat of the present, arose in the years between 1830 and 1850, dealing\r\nwith social forces in American life, animated by a desire to apply the\r\npublic lands to social amelioration, eager to find new forms of\r\ndemocratic development. But the flood of the slavery struggle swept all\r\nof these movements into its mighty inundation for the time. After the\r\nwar, other influences delayed the revival of the movement. The railroads\r\nopened the wide prairies after 1850 and made it easy to reach them; and\r\ndecade after decade new sections were reduced to the purposes of\r\ncivilization and to the advantages of the common man as well as the\r\npromotion of great individual fortunes. The nation centered its\r\ninterests in the development of the West. It is only in our own day that\r\nthis humanitarian democratic wave has reached the level of those earlier\r\nyears. But in the meantime there are clear evidences of the persistence\r\nof the forces, even though under strange guise. Read the platforms of\r\nthe Greenback-Labor, the Granger, and the Populist parties, and you will\r\nfind in those platforms, discredited and reprobated by the major parties\r\nof the time, the basic proposals of the Democratic party after its\r\nrevolution under the leadership of Mr. Bryan, and of the Republican\r\nparty after its revolution by Mr. Roosevelt. The Insurgent movement is\r\nso clearly related to the areas and elements that gave strength to this\r\nprogressive assertion of old democratic ideals with new weapons, that it\r\nmust be regarded as the organized refusal of these persistent\r\ntendencies to be checked by the advocates of more moderate measures.\r\n\r\nI have dealt with these fragments of party history, not, of course, with\r\nthe purpose of expressing any present judgment upon them, but to\r\nemphasize and give concreteness to the fact that there is disclosed by\r\npresent events a new significance to these contests of radical democracy\r\nand conservative interests; that they are rather a continuing expression\r\nof deep-seated forces than fragmentary and sporadic curios for the\r\nhistorical museum.\r\n\r\nIf we should survey the history of our lands from a similar point of\r\nview, considering the relations of legislation and administration of the\r\npublic domain to the structure of American democracy, it would yield a\r\nreturn far beyond that offered by the formal treatment of the subject in\r\nmost of our histories. We should find in the squatter doctrines and\r\npractices, the seizure of the best soils, the taking of public timber on\r\nthe theory of a right to it by the labor expended on it, fruitful\r\nmaterial for understanding the atmosphere and ideals under which the\r\ngreat corporations developed the West. Men like Senator Benton and\r\nDelegate Sibley in successive generations defended the trespasses of the\r\npioneer and the lumberman upon the public forest lands, and denounced\r\nthe paternal government that \"harassed\" these men, who were engaged in\r\nwhat we should call stealing government timber. It is evident that at\r\nsome time between the middle of the nineteenth century and the present\r\ntime, when we impose jail sentences upon Congressmen caught in such\r\nviolations of the land laws, a change came over the American conscience\r\nand the civic ideals were modified. That our great industrial\r\nenterprises developed in the midst of these changing ideals is important\r\nto recall when we write the history of their activity.\r\n\r\nWe should find also that we cannot understand the land question without\r\nseeing its relations to the struggle of sections and classes bidding\r\nagainst each other and finding in the public domain a most important\r\ntopic of political bargaining. We should find, too, that the settlement\r\nof unlike geographic areas in the course of the nation's progress\r\nresulted in changes in the effect of the land laws; that a system\r\nintended for the humid prairies was ill-adjusted to the grazing lands\r\nand coal fields and to the forests in the days of large-scale\r\nexploitation by corporations commanding great capital. Thus changing\r\ngeographic factors as well as the changing character of the forces which\r\noccupied the public domain must be considered, if we would understand\r\nthe bearing of legislation and policy in this field.[329:1] It is\r\nfortunate that suggestive studies of democracy and the land policy have\r\nalready begun to appear.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of American agriculture viewed in relation to the\r\neconomic, political, and social life of the nation has important\r\ncontributions to make. If, for example, we study the maps showing the\r\ntransition of the wheat belt from the East to the West, as the virgin\r\nsoils were conquered and made new bases for destructive competition with\r\nthe older wheat States, we shall see how deeply they affected not only\r\nland values, railroad building, the movement of population, and the\r\nsupply of cheap food, but also how the regions once devoted to single\r\ncropping of wheat were forced to turn to varied and intensive\r\nagriculture and to diversified industry, and we shall see also how these\r\ntransformations affected party politics and even the ideals of the\r\nAmericans of the regions thus changed. We shall find in the\r\nover-production of wheat in the provinces thus rapidly colonized, and in\r\nthe over-production of silver in the mountain provinces which were\r\ncontemporaneously exploited, important explanations of the peculiar\r\nform which American politics took in the period when Mr. Bryan mastered\r\nthe Democratic party, just as we shall find in the opening of the new\r\ngold fields in the years immediately following, and in the passing of\r\nthe era of almost free virgin wheat soils, explanations of the more\r\nrecent period when high prices are giving new energy and aggressiveness\r\nto the demands of the new American industrial democracy.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, it may be assumed, to make clear the point which I\r\nam trying to elucidate, namely that a comprehension of the United States\r\nof to-day, an understanding of the rise and progress of the forces which\r\nhave made it what it is, demands that we should rework our history from\r\nthe new points of view afforded by the present. If this is done, it will\r\nbe seen, for example, that the progress of the struggle between North\r\nand South over slavery and the freed negro, which held the principal\r\nplace in American interest in the two decades after 1850, was, after\r\nall, only one of the interests in the time. The pages of the\r\nCongressional debates, the contemporary newspapers, the public documents\r\nof those twenty years, remain a rich mine for those who will seek\r\ntherein the sources of movements dominant in the present day.\r\n\r\nThe final consideration to which I ask your attention in this discussion\r\nof social forces in American life, is with reference to the mode of\r\ninvestigating them and the bearing of these investigations upon the\r\nrelations and the goal of history. It has become a precedent, fairly\r\nwell established by the distinguished scholars who have held the office\r\nwhich I am about to lay down, to state a position with reference to the\r\nrelations of history and its sister-studies, and even to raise the\r\nquestion of the attitude of the historian toward the laws of\r\nthermodynamics and to seek to find the key of historical development or\r\nof historical degradation. It is not given to all to bend the bow of\r\nUlysses. I shall attempt a lesser task.\r\n\r\nWe may take some lessons from the scientist. He has enriched knowledge\r\nespecially in recent years by attacking the no-man's lands left\r\nunexplored by the too sharp delimitation of spheres of activity. These\r\nnew conquests have been especially achieved by the combination of old\r\nsciences. Physical chemistry, electro-chemistry, geo-physics,\r\nastro-physics, and a variety of other scientic unions have led to\r\naudacious hypotheses, veritable flashes of vision, which open new\r\nregions of activity for a generation of investigators. Moreover they\r\nhave promoted such investigations by furnishing new instruments of\r\nresearch. Now in some respects there is an analogy between geology and\r\nhistory. The new geologist aims to describe the inorganic earth\r\ndynamically in terms of natural law, using chemistry, physics,\r\nmathematics, and even botany and zoölogy so far as they relate to\r\npaleontology. But he does not insist that the relative importance of\r\nphysical or chemical factors shall be determined before he applies the\r\nmethods and data of these sciences to his problem. Indeed, he has\r\nlearned that a geological area is too complex a thing to be reduced to a\r\nsingle explanation. He has abandoned the single hypothesis for the\r\nmultiple hypothesis. He creates a whole family of possible explanations\r\nof a given problem and thus avoids the warping influence of partiality\r\nfor a simple theory.\r\n\r\nHave we not here an illustration of what is possible and necessary for\r\nthe historian? Is it not well, before attempting to decide whether\r\nhistory requires an economic interpretation, or a psychological, or any\r\nother ultimate interpretation, to recognize that the factors in human\r\nsociety are varied and complex; that the political historian handling\r\nhis subject in isolation is certain to miss fundamental facts and\r\nrelations in his treatment of a given age or nation; that the economic\r\nhistorian is exposed to the same danger; and so of all of the other\r\nspecial historians?\r\n\r\nThose who insist that history is simply the effort to tell the thing\r\nexactly as it was, to state the facts, are confronted with the\r\ndifficulty that the fact which they would represent is not planted on\r\nthe solid ground of fixed conditions; it is in the midst and is itself a\r\npart of the changing currents, the complex and interacting influences of\r\nthe time, deriving its significance as a fact from its relations to the\r\ndeeper-seated movements of the age, movements so gradual that often only\r\nthe passing years can reveal the truth about the fact and its right to a\r\nplace on the historian's page.\r\n\r\nThe economic historian is in danger of making his analysis and his\r\nstatement of a law on the basis of present conditions and then passing\r\nto history for justificatory appendixes to his conclusions. An American\r\neconomist of high rank has recently expressed his conception of \"the\r\nfull relation of economic theory, statistics, and history\" in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     A principle is formulated by _a priori_ reasoning concerning\r\n     facts of common experience; it is then tested by statistics\r\n     and promoted to the rank of a known and acknowledged truth;\r\n     illustrations of its action are then found in narrative\r\n     history and, on the other hand, the economic law becomes the\r\n     interpreter of records that would otherwise be confusing and\r\n     comparatively valueless; the law itself derives its final\r\n     confirmation from the illustrations of its working which the\r\n     records afford; but what is at least of equal importance is\r\n     the parallel fact that the law affords the decisive test of\r\n     the correctness of those assertions concerning the causes and\r\n     the effects of past events which it is second nature to make\r\n     and which historians almost invariably do make in connection\r\n     with their narrations.[333:1]\r\n\r\nThere is much in this statement by which the historian may profit, but\r\nhe may doubt also whether the past should serve merely as the\r\n\"illustration\" by which to confirm the law deduced from common\r\nexperience by _a priori_ reasoning tested by statistics. In fact the\r\npathway of history is strewn with the wrecks of the \"known and\r\nacknowledged truths\" of economic law, due not only to defective analysis\r\nand imperfect statistics, but also to the lack of critical historical\r\nmethods, of insufficient historical-mindedness on the part of the\r\neconomist, to failure to give due attention to the relativity and\r\ntransiency of the conditions from which his laws were deduced.\r\n\r\nBut the point on which I would lay stress is this. The economist, the\r\npolitical scientist, the psychologist, the sociologist, the geographer,\r\nthe student of literature, of art, of religion--all the allied laborers\r\nin the study of society--have contributions to make to the equipment of\r\nthe historian. These contributions are partly of material, partly of\r\ntools, partly of new points of view, new hypotheses, new suggestions of\r\nrelations, causes, and emphasis. Each of these special students is in\r\nsome danger of bias by his particular point of view, by his exposure to\r\nsee simply the thing in which he is primarily interested, and also by\r\nhis effort to deduce the universal laws of his separate science. The\r\nhistorian, on the other hand, is exposed to the danger of dealing with\r\nthe complex and interacting social forces of a period or of a country,\r\nfrom some single point of view to which his special training or interest\r\ninclines him. If the truth is to be made known, the historian must so\r\nfar familiarize himself with the work, and equip himself with the\r\ntraining of his sister-subjects that he can at least avail himself of\r\ntheir results and in some reasonable degree master the essential tools\r\nof their trade. And the followers of the sister-studies must likewise\r\nfamiliarize themselves and their students with the work and the methods\r\nof the historians, and coöperate in the difficult task.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the American historian shall aim at this equipment,\r\nnot so much that he may possess the key to history or satisfy himself in\r\nregard to its ultimate laws. At present a different duty is before him.\r\nHe must see in American society with its vast spaces, its sections equal\r\nto European nations, its geographic influences, its brief period of\r\ndevelopment, its variety of nationalities and races, its extraordinary\r\nindustrial growth under the conditions of freedom, its institutions,\r\nculture, ideals, social psychology, and even its religions forming and\r\nchanging almost under his eyes, one of the richest fields ever offered\r\nfor the preliminary recognition and study of the forces that operate and\r\ninterplay in the making of society.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[311:1] Annual address as the president of the American Historical\r\nAssociation, delivered at Indianapolis, December 28, 1910.

It is for historic ideals that we\r\nare fighting. If this nation is one for which we should pour out our\r\nsavings, postpone our differences, go hungry, and even give up life\r\nitself, it is not because it is a rich, extensive, well-fed and populous\r\nnation; it is because from its early days America has pressed onward\r\ntoward a goal of its own; that it has followed an ideal, the ideal of a\r\ndemocracy developing under conditions unlike those of any other age or\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting not for an Old World ideal, not for an abstraction, not\r\nfor a philosophical revolution. Broad and generous as are our\r\nsympathies, widely scattered in origin as are our people, keenly as we\r\nfeel the call of kinship, the thrill of sympathy with the stricken\r\nnations across the Atlantic, we are fighting for the historic ideals of\r\nthe United States, for the continued existence of the type of society in\r\nwhich we believe, because we have proved it good, for the things which\r\ndrew European exiles to our shores, and which inspired the hopes of the\r\npioneers.\r\n\r\nWe are at war that the history of the United States, rich with the\r\nrecord of high human purposes, and of faith in the destiny of the common\r\nman under freedom, filled with the promises of a better world, may not\r\nbecome the lost and tragic story of a futile dream.\r\n\r\nYes, it is an American ideal and an American example for which we fight;\r\nbut in that ideal and example lies medicine for the healing of the\r\nnations. It is the best we have to give to Europe, and it is a matter of\r\nvital import that we shall safeguard and preserve our power to serve the\r\nworld, and not be overwhelmed in the flood of imperialistic force that\r\nwills the death of democracy and would send the freeman under the yoke.\r\nEssential as are our contributions of wealth, the work of our\r\nscientists, the toil of our farmers and our workmen in factory and\r\nshipyard, priceless as is the stream of young American manhood which we\r\npour forth to stop the flood which flows like moulten lava across the\r\ngreen fields and peaceful hamlets of Europe toward the sea and turns to\r\nashes and death all that it covers, these contributions have their\r\ndeeper meaning in the American spirit. They are born of the love of\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nLong ago in prophetic words Walt Whitman voiced the meaning of our\r\npresent sacrifices:\r\n\r\n     \"Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,\r\n     Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,\r\n     The Past is also stored in thee,\r\n     Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western\r\n         Continent alone,\r\n     Earth's résumé entire floats on thy keel, O ship, is steadied by\r\n         thy spars,\r\n     With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or\r\n         swim with thee,\r\n     With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars,\r\n         thou bear'st the other continents,\r\n     Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant.\"\r\n\r\nShortly before the Civil War, a great German, exiled from his native\r\nland for his love of freedom, came from his new home among the pioneers\r\nof the Middle West to set forth in Faneuil Hall, the \"cradle of\r\nliberty,\" in Boston, his vision of the young America that was forming in\r\nthe West, \"the last depository of the hopes of all true friends of\r\nhumanity.\" Speaking of the contrast between the migrations to the\r\nMississippi Valley and those of the Old World in other centuries, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     It is now not a barbarous multitude pouncing upon old and\r\n     decrepit empires, not a violent concussion of tribes\r\n     accompanied by all the horrors of general destruction, but we\r\n     see the vigorous elements--peaceably congregating and mingling\r\n     together on virgin soil--; led together by the irresistible\r\n     attraction of free and broad principles; undertaking to\r\n     commence a new era in the history of the world, without first\r\n     destroying the results of the progress of past periods;\r\n     undertaking to found a cosmopolitan nation without marching\r\n     over the dead bodies of slain millions.\r\n\r\nIf Carl Schurz had lived to see the outcome of that Germany from which\r\nhe was sent as an exile, in the days when Prussian bayonets dispersed\r\nthe legislatures and stamped out the beginnings of democratic rule in\r\nhis former country, could he have better pictured the contrasts between\r\nthe Prussian and the American spirit? He went on to say:\r\n\r\n     Thus was founded the _great colony of free humanity_, which\r\n     has not old England alone, but the _world_ for its mother\r\n     country. And in the colony of free humanity, whose mother\r\n     country is the world, they established the Republic of equal\r\n     rights where the title of manhood is the title to citizenship.\r\n     My friends, if I had a thousand tongues, and a voice as strong\r\n     as the thunder of heaven, they would not be sufficient to\r\n     impress upon your minds forcibly enough the greatness of this\r\n     idea, the overshadowing glory of this result. This was the\r\n     dream of the truest friends of man from the beginning; for\r\n     this the noblest blood of martyrs has been shed; for this has\r\n     mankind waded through seas of blood and tears. There it is\r\n     now; there it stands, the noble fabric in all the splendor of\r\n     reality.\r\n\r\nIt is in a solemn and inspiring time, therefore, that we meet to\r\ndedicate this building, and the occasion is fitting to the time. We may\r\nnow see, as never before, the deeper significance, the larger meaning of\r\nthese pioneers, whose plain lives and homely annals are glorified as a\r\npart of the story of the building of a better system of social justice\r\nunder freedom, a broader, and as we fervently hope, a more enduring\r\nfoundation for the welfare and progress under individual liberty of the\r\ncommon man, an example of federation, of peaceful adjustments by\r\ncompromise and concession under a self-governing Republic, where\r\nsections replace nations over a Union as large as Europe, where party\r\ndiscussions take the place of warring countries, where the _Pax\r\nAmericana_ furnishes an example for a better world.\r\n\r\nAs our forefathers, the pioneers, gathered in their neighborhood to\r\nraise the log cabin, and sanctified it by the name of home, the dwelling\r\nplace of pioneer ideals, so we meet to celebrate the raising of this\r\nhome, this shrine of Minnesota's historic life. It symbolizes the\r\nconviction that the past and the future of this people are tied\r\ntogether; that this Historical Society is the keeper of the records of a\r\nnoteworthy movement in the progress of mankind; that these records are\r\nnot unmeaning and antiquarian, but even in their details are worthy of\r\npreservation for their revelation of the beginnings of society in the\r\nmidst of a nation caught by the vision of a better future for the world.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat the words of Harriet Martineau, who portrayed the American\r\nof the thirties:\r\n\r\n     I regard the American people as a great embryo poet, now\r\n     moody, now wild, but bringing out results of absolute good\r\n     sense; restless and wayward in action, but with deep peace at\r\n     his heart; exulting that he has caught the true aspect of\r\n     things past and the depth of futurity which lies before him,\r\n     wherein to create something so magnificent as the world has\r\n     scarcely begun to dream of. There is the strongest hope of a\r\n     nation that is capable of being possessed with an idea.\r\n\r\nAnd recall her appeal to the American people to \"cherish their high\r\ndemocratic hope, their faith in man. The older they grow the more they\r\nmust reverence the dreams of their youth.\"\r\n\r\nThe dreams of their youth! Here they shall be preserved, and the\r\nachievements as well as the aspirations of the men who made the State,\r\nthe men who built on their foundations, the men with large vision and\r\npower of action, the lesser men in the mass, the leaders who served the\r\nState and nation with devotion to the cause. Here shall be preserved the\r\nrecord of the men who failed to see the larger vision and worked\r\nimpatiently with narrow or selfish or class ends, as well as of those\r\nwho labored with patience and sympathy and mutual concession, with\r\nreadiness to make adjustments and to subordinate their immediate\r\ninterests to the larger good and the immediate safety of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the archives of such an old institution as that of the Historical\r\nSociety of Massachusetts, whose treasures run to the beginnings of the\r\nPuritan colonization, the students cannot fail to find the evidence that\r\na State Historical Society is a Book of Judgment wherein is made up the\r\nrecord of a people and its leaders. So, as time unfolds, shall be the\r\ncollections of this Society, the depository of the material that shall\r\npreserve the memory of this people. Each section of this widely extended\r\nand varied nation has its own peculiar past, its special form of\r\nsociety, its traits and its leaders. It were a pity if any section left\r\nits annals solely to the collectors of a remote region, and it were a\r\npity if its collections were not transformed into printed documents and\r\nmonographic studies which can go to the libraries of all the parts of\r\nthe Union and thus enable the student to see the nation as a whole in\r\nits past as well as in its present.\r\n\r\nThis Society finds its special field of activity in a great State of the\r\nMiddle West, so new, as history reckons time, that its annals are still\r\npredominantly those of the pioneers, but so rapidly growing that already\r\nthe era of the pioneers is a part of the history of the past, capable of\r\nbeing handled objectively, seen in a perspective that is not possible to\r\nthe observer of the present conditions.\r\n\r\nBecause of these facts I have taken as the special theme of this address\r\nthe Middle Western Pioneer Democracy, which I would sketch in some of\r\nits outstanding aspects, and chiefly in the generation before the Civil\r\nWar, for it was from those pioneers that the later colonization to the\r\nnewer parts of the Mississippi Valley derived much of their traits, and\r\nfrom whom large numbers of them came.\r\n\r\nThe North Central States as a whole is a region comparable to all of\r\nCentral Europe. Of these States, a large part of the old\r\nNorthwest,--Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin; and their\r\nsisters beyond the Mississippi--Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota--were\r\nstill, in the middle of the nineteenth century, the home of an\r\nessentially pioneer society. Within the lifetime of many living men,\r\nWisconsin was called the \"Far West,\" and Minnesota was a land of the\r\nIndian and the fur traders, a wilderness of forest and prairie beyond\r\nthe \"edge of cultivation.\" That portion of this great region which was\r\nstill in the pioneering period of settlement by 1850 was alone about as\r\nextensive as the old thirteen States, or Germany and Austria-Hungary\r\ncombined. The region was a huge geographic mold for a new society,\r\nmodeled by nature on the scale of the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the\r\nupper Mississippi and the Missouri. Simple and majestic in its vast\r\noutlines it was graven into a variety that in its detail also had a\r\nlargeness of design. From the Great Lakes extended the massive glacial\r\nsheet which covered that mighty basin and laid down treasures of soil.\r\nVast forests of pine shrouded its upper zone, breaking into hardwood and\r\nthe oak openings as they neared the ocean-like expanses of the prairies.\r\nForests again along the Ohio Valley, and beyond, to the west, lay the\r\nlevels of the Great Plains. Within the earth were unexploited treasures\r\nof coal and lead, copper and iron in such form and quantity as were to\r\nrevolutionize the industrial processes of the world. But nature's\r\nrevelations are progressive, and it was rather the marvelous adaptation\r\nof the soil to the raising of corn and wheat that drew the pioneers to\r\nthis land of promise, and made a new era of colonization. In the unity\r\nwith variety of this pioneer empire and in its broad levels we have a\r\npromise of its society.\r\n\r\nFirst had come the children of the interior of the South, and with ax\r\nand rifle in hand had cut their clearings in the forest, raised their\r\nlog cabins, fought the Indians and by 1830 had pushed their way to the\r\nvery edge of the prairies along the Ohio and Missouri Valleys, leaving\r\nunoccupied most of the Basin of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nThese slashers of the forest, these self-sufficing pioneers, raising the\r\ncorn and live stock for their own need, living scattered and apart, had\r\nat first small interest in town life or a share in markets. They were\r\npassionately devoted to the ideal of equality, but it was an ideal which\r\nassumed that under free conditions in the midst of unlimited resources,\r\nthe homogeneous society of the pioneers _must_ result in equality. What\r\nthey objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon\r\nthe freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his own\r\ncareer without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the\r\ncrystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and\r\nthe fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road\r\nmust be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must\r\nbe no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to\r\nthe able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end.\r\nMore than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real\r\nfeeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able\r\nto achieve preëminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down\r\nupon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter\r\nof pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the\r\nless successful.\r\n\r\nIf this democracy of Southern pioneers, this Jacksonian democracy, was,\r\nas its socialist critics have called it, in reality a democracy of\r\n\"expectant capitalists,\" it was not one which expected or acknowledged\r\non the part of the successful ones the right to harden their triumphs\r\ninto the rule of a privileged class. In short, if it is indeed true that\r\nthe backwoods democracy was based upon equality of opportunity, it is\r\nalso true that it resented the conception that opportunity under\r\ncompetition should result in the hopeless inequality, or rule of class.\r\nEver a new clearing must be possible. And because the wilderness seemed\r\nso unending, the menace to the enjoyment of this ideal seemed rather to\r\nbe feared from government, within or without, than from the operations\r\nof internal evolution.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, it became evident that these men had means of\r\nsupplementing their individual activity by informal combinations. One of\r\nthe things that impressed all early travelers in the United States was\r\nthe capacity for extra-legal, voluntary association.[343:1] This was\r\nnatural enough; in all America we can study the process by which in a\r\nnew land social customs form and crystallize into law. We can even see\r\nhow the personal leader becomes the governmental official. This power of\r\nthe newly arrived pioneers to join together for a common end without the\r\nintervention of governmental institutions was one of their marked\r\ncharacteristics. The log rolling, the house-raising, the husking bee,\r\nthe apple paring, and the squatters' associations whereby they protected\r\nthemselves against the speculators in securing title to their clearings\r\non the public domain, the camp meeting, the mining camp, the vigilantes,\r\nthe cattle-raisers' associations, the \"gentlemen's agreements,\" are a\r\nfew of the indications of this attitude. It is well to emphasize this\r\nAmerican trait, because in a modified way it has come to be one of the\r\nmost characteristic and important features of the United States of\r\nto-day. America does through informal association and understandings on\r\nthe part of the people many of the things which in the Old World are and\r\ncan be done only by governmental intervention and compulsion. These\r\nassociations were in America not due to immemorial custom of tribe or\r\nvillage community. They were extemporized by voluntary action.\r\n\r\nThe actions of these associations had an authority akin to that of law.\r\nThey were usually not so much evidences of a disrespect for law and\r\norder as the only means by which real law and order were possible in a\r\nregion where settlement and society had gone in advance of the\r\ninstitutions and instrumentalities of organized society.\r\n\r\nBecause of these elements of individualistic competition and the power\r\nof spontaneous association, pioneers were responsive to leadership. The\r\nbackwoodsmen knew that under the free opportunities of his life the\r\nabler man would reveal himself, and show them the way. By free choice\r\nand not by compulsion, by spontaneous impulse, and not by the domination\r\nof a caste, they rallied around a cause, they supported an issue. They\r\nyielded to the principle of government by agreement, and they hated the\r\ndoctrine of autocracy even before it gained a name.\r\n\r\nThey looked forward to the extension of their American principles to the\r\nOld World and their keenest apprehensions came from the possibility of\r\nthe extension of the Old World's system of arbitrary rule, its class\r\nwars and rivalries and interventions to the destruction of the free\r\nStates and democratic institutions which they were building in the\r\nforests of America.\r\n\r\nIf we add to these aspects of early backwoods democracy, its spiritual\r\nqualities, we shall more easily understand them. These men were\r\nemotional. As they wrested their clearing from the woods and from the\r\nsavages who surrounded them, as they expanded that clearing and saw the\r\nbeginnings of commonwealths, where only little communities had been, and\r\nas they saw these commonwealths touch hands with each other along the\r\ngreat course of the Mississippi River, they became enthusiastically\r\noptimistic and confident of the continued expansion of this democracy.\r\nThey had faith in themselves and their destiny. And that optimistic\r\nfaith was responsible both for their confidence in their own ability to\r\nrule and for the passion for expansion. They looked to the future.\r\n\"Others appeal to history: an American appeals to prophecy; and with\r\nMalthus in one hand and a map of the back country in the other, he\r\nboldly defies us to a comparison with America as she is to be,\" said a\r\nLondon periodical in 1821. Just because, perhaps, of the usual isolation\r\nof their lives, when they came together in associations whether of the\r\ncamp meeting or of the political gathering, they felt the influence of a\r\ncommon emotion and enthusiasm. Whether Scotch-Irish Presbyterian,\r\nBaptist, or Methodist, these people saturated their religion and their\r\npolitics with feeling. Both the stump and the pulpit were centers of\r\nenergy, electric cells capable of starting widespreading fires. They\r\n_felt_ both their religion and their democracy, and were ready to fight\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThis democracy was one that involved a real feeling of social\r\ncomradeship among its widespread members. Justice Catron, who came from\r\nArkansas to the Supreme Court in the presidency of Jackson, said: \"The\r\npeople of New Orleans and St. Louis are next neighbors--if we desire to\r\nknow a man in any quarter of the union we inquire of our next neighbor,\r\nwho but the other day lived by him.\" Exaggerated as this is, it\r\nnevertheless had a surprising measure of truth for the Middle West as\r\nwell. For the Mississippi River was the great highway down which groups\r\nof pioneers like Abraham Lincoln, on their rafts and flat boats, brought\r\nthe little neighborhood surplus. After the steamboat came to the western\r\nwaters the voyages up and down by merchants and by farmers shifting\r\ntheir homes, brought people into contact with each other over wide\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThis enlarged neighborhood democracy was determined not by a reluctant\r\nadmission that under the law one man is as good as another; it was based\r\nupon \"good fellowship,\" sympathy and understanding. They were of a\r\nstock, moreover, which sought new trails and were ready to follow where\r\nthe trail led, innovators in society as well as finders of new lands.\r\n\r\nBy 1830 the Southern inundation ebbed and a different tide flowed in\r\nfrom the northeast by way of the Erie Canal and steam navigation on the\r\nGreat Lakes to occupy the zone unreached by Southern settlement. This\r\nnew tide spread along the margins of the Great Lakes, found the oak\r\nopenings and small prairie islands of Southern Michigan and Wisconsin;\r\nfollowed the fertile forested ribbons along the river courses far into\r\nthe prairie lands; and by the end of the forties began to venture into\r\nthe margin of the open prairie.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the Middle West contained a little over a million and a half\r\npeople; in 1840, over three and a third millions; in 1850, nearly five\r\nand a half millions. Although in 1830 the North Atlantic States numbered\r\nbetween three and four times as many people as the Middle West, yet in\r\nthose two decades the Middle West made an actual gain of several hundred\r\nthousand more than did the old section. Counties in the newer states\r\nrose from a few hundred to ten or fifteen thousand people in the space\r\nof less than five years. Suddenly, with astonishing rapidity and volume,\r\na new people was forming with varied elements, ideals and institutions\r\ndrawn from all over this nation and from Europe. They were confronted\r\nwith the problem of adjusting different stocks, varied customs and\r\nhabits, to their new home.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the Ohio Valley, the peculiarity of the occupation of\r\nthe northern zone of the Middle West, lay in the fact that the native\r\nelement was predominantly from the older settlements of the Middle West\r\nitself and from New York and New England. But it was from the central\r\nand western counties of New York and from the western and northern parts\r\nof New England, the rural regions of declining agricultural prosperity,\r\nthat the bulk of this element came.\r\n\r\nThus the influence of the Middle West stretched into the Northeast, and\r\nattracted a farming population already suffering from western\r\ncompetition. The advantage of abundant, fertile, and cheap land, the\r\nricher agricultural returns, and especially the opportunities for youth\r\nto rise in all the trades and professions, gave strength to this\r\ncompetition. By it New England was profoundly and permanently modified.\r\n\r\nThis Yankee stock carried with it a habit of community life, in contrast\r\nwith the individualistic democracy of the Southern element. The\r\ncolonizing land companies, the town, the school, the church, the feeling\r\nof local unity, furnished the evidences of this instinct for\r\ncommunities. This instinct was accompanied by the creation of cities,\r\nthe production of a surplus for market, the reaching out to connections\r\nwith the trading centers of the East, the evolution of a more complex\r\nand at the same time a more integrated industrial society than that of\r\nthe Southern pioneer.\r\n\r\nBut they did not carry with them the unmodified New England institutions\r\nand traits. They came at a time and from a people less satisfied with\r\nthe old order than were their neighbors in the East. They were the young\r\nmen with initiative, with discontent; the New York element especially\r\nwas affected by the radicalism of Locofoco democracy which was in\r\nitself a protest against the established order.\r\n\r\nThe winds of the prairies swept away almost at once a mass of old habits\r\nand prepossessions. Said one of these pioneers in a letter to friends in\r\nthe East:\r\n\r\n     If you value ease more than money or prosperity, don't\r\n     come. . . . Hands are too few for the work, houses for the\r\n     inhabitants, and days for the day's work to be done. . . .\r\n     Next if you can't stand seeing your old New England ideas,\r\n     ways of doing, and living and in fact, all of the good old\r\n     Yankee fashions knocked out of shape and altered, or thrown by\r\n     as unsuited to the climate, don't be caught out here. But if\r\n     you can bear grief with a smile, can put up with a scale of\r\n     accommodations ranging from the soft side of a plank before\r\n     the fire (and perhaps three in a bed at that) down through the\r\n     middling and inferior grades; if you are never at a loss for\r\n     ways to do the most unpracticable things without tools; if you\r\n     can do all this and some more come on. . . . It is a universal\r\n     rule here to help one another, each one keeping an eye single\r\n     to his own business.\r\n\r\nThey knew that they were leaving many dear associations of the old home,\r\ngiving up many of the comforts of life, sacrificing things which those\r\nwho remained thought too vital to civilization to be left. But they were\r\nnot mere materialists ready to surrender all that life is worth for\r\nimmediate gain. They were idealists themselves, sacrificing the ease of\r\nthe immediate future for the welfare of their children, and convinced of\r\nthe possibility of helping to bring about a better social order and a\r\nfreer life. They were social idealists. But they based their ideals on\r\ntrust in the common man and the readiness to make adjustments, not on\r\nthe rule of a benevolent despot or a controlling class.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of this new home reached also into the Old World and gave\r\na new hope and new impulses to the people of Germany, of England, of\r\nIreland, and of Scandinavia. Both economic influences and revolutionary\r\ndiscontent promoted German migration at this time; economic causes\r\nbrought the larger volume, but the quest for liberty brought the\r\nleaders, many of whom were German political exiles. While the latter\r\nurged, with varying degrees of emphasis, that their own contribution\r\nshould be preserved in their new surroundings, and a few visionaries\r\neven talked of a German State in the federal system, what was noteworthy\r\nwas the adjustment of the emigrants of the thirties and forties to\r\nMiddle Western conditions; the response to the opportunity to create a\r\nnew type of society in which all gave and all received and no element\r\nremained isolated. Society was plastic. In the midst of more or less\r\nantagonism between \"bowie knife Southerners,\" \"cow-milking Yankee\r\nPuritans,\" \"beer-drinking Germans,\" \"wild Irishmen,\" a process of mutual\r\neducation, a giving and taking, was at work. In the outcome, in spite of\r\nslowness of assimilation where different groups were compact and\r\nisolated from the others, and a certain persistence of inherited\r\n_morale_, there was the creation of a new type, which was neither the\r\nsum of all its elements, nor a complete fusion in a melting pot. They\r\nwere American pioneers, not outlying fragments of New England, of\r\nGermany, or of Norway.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were most strongly represented in the Missouri Valley, in\r\nSt. Louis, in Illinois opposite that city, and in the Lake Shore\r\ncounties of eastern Wisconsin north from Milwaukee. In Cincinnati and\r\nCleveland there were many Germans, while in nearly half the counties of\r\nOhio, the German immigrants and the Pennsylvania Germans held nearly or\r\nquite the balance of political power. The Irish came primarily as\r\nworkers on turnpikes, canals and railroads, and tended to remain along\r\nsuch lines, or to gather in the growing cities. The Scandinavians, of\r\nwhom the largest proportion were Norwegians, founded their colonies in\r\nNorthern Illinois, and in Southern Wisconsin about the Fox and the head\r\nwaters of Rock River, whence in later years they spread into Iowa,\r\nMinnesota and North Dakota.\r\n\r\nBy 1850 about one-sixth of the people of the Middle West were of North\r\nAtlantic birth, about one-eighth of Southern birth, and a like fraction\r\nof foreign birth, of whom the Germans were twice as numerous as the\r\nIrish, and the Scandinavians only slightly more numerous than the Welsh,\r\nand fewer than the Scotch. There were only a dozen Scandinavians in\r\nMinnesota. The natives of the British Islands, together with the natives\r\nof British North America in the Middle West, numbered nearly as many as\r\nthe natives of German lands. But in 1850 almost three-fifths of the\r\npopulation were natives of the Middle West itself, and over a third of\r\nthe population lived in Ohio. The cities were especially a mixture of\r\npeoples. In the five larger cities of the section natives and foreigners\r\nwere nearly balanced. In Chicago the Irish, Germans and natives of the\r\nNorth Atlantic States about equaled each other. But in all the other\r\ncities, the Germans exceeded the Irish in varying proportions. There\r\nwere nearly three to one in Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that the section was growing rapidly and was made up of\r\nvarious stocks with many different cultures, sectional and European;\r\nwhat is more significant is that these elements did not remain as\r\nseparate strata underneath an established ruling order, as was the case\r\nparticularly in New England. All were accepted and intermingling\r\ncomponents of a forming society, plastic and absorptive. This\r\ncharacteristic of the section as \"a good mixer\" became fixed before the\r\nlarge immigrations of the eighties. The foundations of the section were\r\nlaid firmly in a period when the foreign elements were particularly free\r\nand eager to contribute to a new society and to receive an impress from\r\nthe country which offered them a liberty denied abroad. Significant as\r\nis this fact, and influential in the solution of America's present\r\nproblems, it is no more important than the fact that in the decade\r\nbefore the Civil War, the Southern element in the Middle West had also\r\nhad nearly two generations of direct association with the Northern, and\r\nhad finally been engulfed in a tide of Northeastern and Old World\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nIn this society of pioneers men learned to drop their old national\r\nanimosities. One of the Immigrant Guides of the fifties urged the\r\nnewcomers to abandon their racial animosities. \"The American laughs at\r\nthese steerage quarrels,\" said the author.\r\n\r\nThus the Middle West was teaching the lesson of national\r\ncross-fertilization instead of national enmities, the possibility of a\r\nnewer and richer civilization, not by preserving unmodified or isolated\r\nthe old component elements, but by breaking down the line-fences, by\r\nmerging the individual life in the common product--a new product, which\r\nheld the promise of world brotherhood. If the pioneers divided their\r\nallegiance between various parties, Whig, Democrat, Free Soil or\r\nRepublican, it does not follow that the western Whig was like the\r\neastern Whig. There was an infiltration of a western quality into all of\r\nthese. The western Whig supported Harrison more because he was a pioneer\r\nthan because he was a Whig. It saw in him a legitimate successor of\r\nAndrew Jackson. The campaign of 1840 was a Middle Western camp meeting\r\non a huge scale. The log cabins, the cider and the coonskins were the\r\nsymbols of the triumph of Middle Western ideas, and were carried with\r\nmisgivings by the merchants, the bankers and the manufacturers of the\r\nEast. In like fashion, the Middle Western wing of the Democratic party\r\nwas as different from the Southern wing wherein lay its strength, as\r\nDouglas was from Calhoun. It had little in common with the slaveholding\r\nclasses of the South, even while it felt the kinship of the pioneer with\r\nthe people of the Southern upland stock from which so many Westerners\r\nwere descended.\r\n\r\nIn the later forties and early fifties most of the Middle Western States\r\nmade constitutions. The debates in their conventions and the results\r\nembodied in the constitutions themselves tell the story of their\r\npolitical ideals. Of course, they based the franchise on the principle\r\nof manhood suffrage. But they also provided for an elective judiciary,\r\nfor restrictions on the borrowing power of the State, lest it fall under\r\nthe control of what they feared as the money power, and several of them\r\neither provided for the extinguishment of banks of issue, or rigidly\r\nrestrained them. Some of them exempted the homestead from forced sale\r\nfor debt; married women's legal rights were prominent topics in the\r\ndebates of the conventions, and Wisconsin led off by permitting the\r\nalien to vote after a year's residence. It welcomed the newcomer to the\r\nfreedom and to the obligations of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nAlthough this pioneer society was preponderantly an agricultural society\r\nit was rapidly learning that agriculture alone was not sufficient for\r\nits life. It was developing manufactures, trade, mining, the\r\nprofessions, and becoming conscious that in a progressive modern state\r\nit was possible to pass from one industry to another and that all were\r\nbound by common ties. But it is significant that in the census of 1850,\r\nOhio, out of a population of two millions, reported only a thousand\r\nservants, Iowa only ten in two hundred thousand and Minnesota fifteen\r\nin its six thousand.\r\n\r\nIn the intellectual life of this new democracy there was already the\r\npromise of original contributions even in the midst of the engrossing\r\ntoil and hard life of the pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe country editor was a leader of his people, not a patent-insides\r\nrecorder of social functions, but a vigorous and independent thinker and\r\nwriter. The subscribers to the newspaper published in the section were\r\nhigher in proportion to population than in the State of New York and not\r\ngreatly inferior to those of New England, although such eastern papers\r\nas the _New York Tribune_ had an extensive circulation throughout the\r\nMiddle West. The agricultural press presupposed in its articles and\r\ncontributions a level of general intelligence and interest above that of\r\nthe later farmers of the section, at least before the present day.\r\n\r\nFarmer boys walked behind the plow with their book in hand and sometimes\r\nforgot to turn at the end of the furrow; even rare boys, who, like the\r\nyoung Howells, \"limped barefoot by his father's side with his eyes on\r\nthe cow and his mind on Cervantes and Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nPeriodicals flourished and faded like the prairie flowers. Some of\r\nEmerson's best poems first appeared in one of these Ohio Valley\r\nmagazines. But for the most part the literature of the region and the\r\nperiod was imitative or reflective of the common things in a not\r\nuncommon way. It is to its children that the Middle West had to look for\r\nthe expression of its life and its ideals rather than to the busy\r\npioneer who was breaking a prairie farm or building up a new community.\r\nIlliteracy was least among the Yankee pioneers and highest among the\r\nSouthern element. When illiteracy is mapped for 1850 by percentages\r\nthere appears two distinct zones, the one extending from New England,\r\nthe other from the South.\r\n\r\nThe influence of New England men was strong in the Yankee regions of\r\nthe Middle West. Home missionaries, and representatives of societies for\r\nthe promotion of education in the West, both in the common school and\r\ndenominational colleges, scattered themselves throughout the region and\r\nleft a deep impress in all these States. The conception was firmly fixed\r\nin the thirties and forties that the West was the coming power in the\r\nUnion, that the fate of civilization was in its hands, and therefore\r\nrival sects and rival sections strove to influence it to their own\r\ntypes. But the Middle West shaped all these educational contributions\r\naccording to her own needs and ideals.\r\n\r\nThe State Universities were for the most part the result of agitation\r\nand proposals of men of New England origin; but they became\r\ncharacteristic products of Middle Western society, where the community\r\nas a whole, rather than wealthy benefactors, supported these\r\ninstitutions. In the end the community determined their directions in\r\naccord with popular ideals. They reached down more deeply into the ranks\r\nof the common people than did the New England or Middle State Colleges;\r\nthey laid more emphasis upon the obviously useful, and became\r\ncoëducational at an early date. This dominance of the community ideals\r\nhad dangers for the Universities, which were called to raise ideals and\r\nto point new ways, rather than to conform.\r\n\r\nChallenging the spaces of the West, struck by the rapidity with which a\r\nnew society was unfolding under their gaze, it is not strange that the\r\npioneers dealt in the superlative and saw their destiny with optimistic\r\neyes. The meadow lot of the small intervale had become the prairie,\r\nstretching farther than their gaze could reach.\r\n\r\nAll was motion and change. A restlessness was universal. Men moved, in\r\ntheir single life, from Vermont to New York, from New York to Ohio,\r\nfrom Ohio to Wisconsin, from Wisconsin to California, and longed for the\r\nHawaiian Islands. When the bark started from their fence rails, they\r\nfelt the call to change. They were conscious of the mobility of their\r\nsociety and gloried in it. They broke with the Past and thought to\r\ncreate something finer, more fitting for humanity, more beneficial for\r\nthe average man than the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"With the Past we have literally nothing to do,\" said B. Gratz Brown in\r\na Missouri Fourth of July oration in 1850, \"save to dream of it. Its\r\nlessons are lost and its tongue is silent. We are ourselves at the head\r\nand front of all political experience. Precedents have lost their virtue\r\nand all their authority is gone. . . . Experience can profit us only to\r\nguard from antequated delusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The yoke of opinion,\" wrote Channing to a Western friend, speaking of\r\nNew England, \"is a heavy one, often crushing individuality of judgment\r\nand action,\" and he added that the habits, rules, and criticisms under\r\nwhich he had grown up had not left him the freedom and courage which are\r\nneeded in the style of address best suited to the Western people.\r\nChanning no doubt unduly stressed the freedom of the West in this\r\nrespect. The frontier had its own conventions and prejudices, and New\r\nEngland was breaking its own cake of custom and proclaiming a new\r\nliberty at the very time he wrote. But there was truth in the Eastern\r\nthought of the West, as a land of intellectual toleration, one which\r\nquestioned the old order of things and made innovation its very creed.\r\n\r\nThe West laid emphasis upon the practical and demanded that ideals\r\nshould be put to work for useful ends; ideals were tested by their\r\ndirect contributions to the betterment of the average man, rather than\r\nby the production of the man of exceptional genius and distinction.\r\n\r\nFor, in fine this was the goal of the Middle West, the welfare of the\r\naverage man; not only the man of the South, or of the East, the Yankee,\r\nor the Irishman, or the German, but all men in one common fellowship.\r\nThis was the hope of their youth, of that youth when Abraham Lincoln\r\nrose from rail-splitter to country lawyer, from Illinois legislator to\r\ncongressman and from congressman to President.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that in all this flux and freedom and novelty and vast\r\nspaces, the pioneer did not sufficiently consider the need of\r\ndisciplined devotion to the government which he himself created and\r\noperated. But the name of Lincoln and the response of the pioneer to the\r\nduties of the Civil War,--to the sacrifices and the restraints on\r\nfreedom which it entailed under his presidency, reminds us that they\r\nknew how to take part in a common cause, even while they knew that war's\r\nconditions were destructive of many of the things for which they worked.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of governmental discipline: that which proceeds from\r\nfree choice, in the conviction that restraint of individual or class\r\ninterests is necessary for the common good; and that which is imposed by\r\na dominant class, upon a subjected and helpless people. The latter is\r\nPrussian discipline, the discipline of a harsh machine-like, logical\r\norganization, based on the rule of a military autocracy. It assumes that\r\nif you do not crush your opponent first, he will crush you. It is the\r\ndiscipline of a nation ruled by its General Staff, assuming war as the\r\nnormal condition of peoples, and attempting with remorseless logic to\r\nextend its operations to the destruction of freedom everywhere. It can\r\nonly be met by the discipline of a people who use their own government\r\nfor worthy ends, who preserve individuality and mobility in society and\r\nrespect the rights of others, who follow the dictates of humanity and\r\nfair play, the principles of give and take. The Prussian discipline is\r\nthe discipline of Thor, the War God, against the discipline of the White\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nPioneer democracy has had to learn lessons by experience: the lesson\r\nthat government on principles of free democracy can accomplish many\r\nthings which the men of the middle of the nineteenth century did not\r\nrealize were even possible. They have had to sacrifice something of\r\ntheir passion for individual unrestraint; they have had to learn that\r\nthe specially trained man, the man fitted for his calling by education\r\nand experience, whether in the field of science or of industry, has a\r\nplace in government; that the rule of the people is effective and\r\nenduring only as it incorporates the trained specialist into the\r\norganization of that government, whether as umpire between contending\r\ninterests or as the efficient instrument in the hands of democracy.\r\n\r\nOrganized democracy after the era of free land has learned that popular\r\ngovernment to be successful must not only be legitimately the choice of\r\nthe whole people; that the offices of that government must not only be\r\nopen to all, but that in the fierce struggle of nations in the field of\r\neconomic competition and in the field of war, the salvation and\r\nperpetuity of the republic depend upon recognition of the fact that\r\nspecialization of the organs of the government, the choice of the fit\r\nand the capable for office, is quite as important as the extension of\r\npopular control. When we lost our free lands and our isolation from the\r\nOld World, we lost our immunity from the results of mistakes, of waste,\r\nof inefficiency, and of inexperience in our government.\r\n\r\nBut in the present day we are also learning another lesson which was\r\nbetter known to the pioneers than to their immediate successors. We are\r\nlearning that the distinction arising from devotion to the interests of\r\nthe commonwealth is a higher distinction than mere success in economic\r\ncompetition. America is now awarding laurels to the men who sacrifice\r\ntheir triumphs in the rivalry of business in order to give their service\r\nto the cause of a liberty-loving nation, their wealth and their genius\r\nto the success of her ideals. That craving for distinction which once\r\ndrew men to pile up wealth and exhibit power over the industrial\r\nprocesses of the nation, is now finding a new outlet in the craving for\r\ndistinction that comes from service to the Union, in satisfaction in the\r\nuse of great talent for the good of the republic.\r\n\r\nAnd all over the nation, in voluntary organizations for aid to the\r\ngovernment, is being shown the pioneer principle of association that was\r\nexpressed in the \"house raising.\" It is shown in the Red Cross, the Y.\r\nM. C. A., the Knights of Columbus, the councils and boards of science,\r\ncommerce, labor, agriculture; and in all the countless other types, from\r\nthe association of women in their kitchen who carry out the\r\nrecommendations of the Food Director and revive the plain living of the\r\npioneer, to the Boy Scouts who are laying the foundations for a\r\nself-disciplined and virile generation worthy to follow the trail of the\r\nbackwoodsmen. It is an inspiring prophecy of the revival of the old\r\npioneer conception of the obligations and opportunities of\r\nneighborliness, broadening to a national and even to an international\r\nscope. The promise of what that wise and lamented philosopher, Josiah\r\nRoyce called, \"the beloved community.\" In the spirit of the pioneer's\r\n\"house raising\" lies the salvation of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThis then is the heritage of pioneer experience,--a passionate belief\r\nthat a democracy was possible which should leave the individual a part\r\nto play in free society and not make him a cog in a machine operated\r\nfrom above; which trusted in the common man, in his tolerance, his\r\nability to adjust differences with good humor, and to work out an\r\nAmerican type from the contributions of all nations--a type for which\r\nhe would fight against those who challenged it in arms, and for which in\r\ntime of war he would make sacrifices, even the temporary sacrifice of\r\nindividual freedom and his life, lest that freedom be lost forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[335:1] An address delivered at the dedication of the building of the\r\nState Historical Society of Minnesota, May 11, 1918.
