I have preceded it by the\r\nHistory of the Viola da Gamba, for the reason that this instrument must\r\nbe considered the precursor of the Violoncello. For my work I have\r\nmade use of the musical dictionaries extant, especially Gerber’s old\r\nand new musical Lexicon as well as Fétis’s “Biographie Universelle des\r\nMusiciens.” What has been borrowed from other works will be indicated\r\nin the course of the narrative. The great courtesy of Herr Friedrich\r\nGrützmacher, the Royal Concert-director of Saxony, in placing at my\r\ndisposal his extensive collection of old and new Violoncello Literature,\r\nhas been of especial value to me in my undertaking. By its means I\r\nhave been enabled to find my way through the historical development\r\nof Violoncello composition. I willingly seize this opportunity of\r\nexpressing my thanks to him for it.\r\n\r\n        V. WASIELEWSKI.\r\n\r\n    SONDERSHAUSEN,\r\n    _December, 1888_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be that we are not a musical people, but if so the encouragement\r\nand appreciation which the sister Art to painting has of late years\r\nreceived in England is not a proof of the truth of the assertion\r\nfrequently made. Our Concert-rooms are always crowded to overflowing;\r\nforeign artists think it worth while to come year by year to England;\r\nschools of music are multiplying, and eagerly attended by amateurs as\r\nwell as professionals; and I think it may now be taken for granted that\r\na musical education may be as thoroughly acquired here as abroad. Every\r\nkind of musical instrument is taken up, if not always with a really\r\nserious intention; but no instrument has more rapidly or more certainly\r\ncome into favour amongst all lovers of music, as well with those who\r\nstudy as with those who listen, than the Violoncello. It is therefore\r\nsomewhat surprising that up to the present time no book has been\r\npublished in English, either as regarding its History or its Literature.\r\nThis consideration, as well as the hope that not only those who devote\r\nthemselves to the Violoncello, either as professors or amateurs, may\r\nbe interested in its History, but also the general musical public who\r\ndelight in listening to its deeply pathetic tones as produced by the\r\ngreat masters of it, has induced me to attempt the translation of Mr.\r\nWasielewski’s interesting work. We love to know and often take pains to\r\nenquire into the history of any favourite picture, to learn something\r\nof the artist’s life, the circumstances under which he painted it, and\r\noften the origin of its conception. I therefore hope that the story of\r\nthe Violoncello will be acceptable to all who love it and give their\r\nlives to the development of its many beauties and capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Violoncello’s forerunner, the Viola da Gamba, cannot\r\nbut be especially interesting, this instrument having been formerly\r\ncultivated in England to so great an extent. The frequent allusions\r\nwhich Praetorius in his “Syntagma Musicum” makes to English Gamba\r\nplayers, with a decided preference to their manner of playing and\r\ntuning their instruments, is a proof of how high their reputation was\r\nabroad; and if any further evidence were wanting the dictum of Mersennus\r\nthat English Gambists excelled all other nations in Gamba playing, is\r\nsufficient to show that in the sixteenth and part of the seventeenth\r\ncenturies they held the first rank. If for a short period we have no\r\nvioloncellist of extraordinary merit to chronicle, more modern times\r\nhave produced artists who will bear comparison with any of the greatest\r\nplayers on the Continent. Concerning these and English Gamba players I\r\nhave ventured to add a few more particulars than Mr. Wasielewski has\r\ngiven, hoping they would prove interesting to English readers. These\r\ndetails have been gathered from Grove’s Dictionary, Leslie Stephen’s\r\nNat. Biography, and various other works. For the technical portion, Mr.\r\nNiecks’s Dictionary of Musical Terms has been consulted, as well as\r\nMendel and Dommer. I have supplemented the Violoncello Schools by others\r\ncollected from Mr. Heron Allen’s Bibliography, and various sources,\r\nintroducing some of the old Instruction books for the Gamba.\r\n\r\nI must here thank Mr. Wasielewski for his kind permission to translate\r\nhis valuable work, as well as Messrs. Breitkopf and Härtel for their\r\ncourteous assistance. I beg Mr. George Herbert to accept my grateful\r\nacknowledgment for his most kind help and encouragement, and Mr. Heron\r\nAllen for the interest he has taken in my work. To Mr. Arthur Hill I am\r\nindebted for much kind advice, and to Mr. Nosèda of the Strand for his\r\ncourteous permission to reproduce from his oil-painting the portrait of\r\nRobert Lindley as a Frontispiece.\r\n\r\n    THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Introduction.\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n    HISTORY OF THE VIOLA DA GAMBA (Basso di Viola)                 1\r\n\r\n    THE TRANSITION TO THE VIOLONCELLO                             36\r\n\r\n    The Art of Violoncello Playing in the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\n       I.

This\r\nlast-named instrument formed the bass in the string quartets of that\r\ntime, to which also belonged, according to the Italian designation,\r\nthe “Discant-Viola” or “Violetta,” as well as the “Viola d’Alta” and\r\n“di Tenore.” In Germany these instruments were called Diskant, Alto,\r\nTenor, and Bass viols. The terms Viola and Violin,[1] were at that time\r\nconsequently synonymous. From the foregoing remarks it will be perceived\r\nthat it is a question not of one kind, but of a whole family of stringed\r\ninstruments. Descriptions and illustrations of them are found in the\r\nfollowing music-authors of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN VIRDUNG: “Musica getutscht,” 1511; HANS JUDENKÜNIG: “Ain\r\nschöne kunstliche Vnderwaisung,” u.s.w., 1523; MARTIN AGRICOLA: “Musica\r\ninstrumentalis deutsch,” 1528; HANS GERLE: “Musica Teusch” (Teutsch),\r\n1532; OTTOMAR LUSCINIUS: (Nachtgall), “Musurgia seu praxis Musicæ,”\r\n1536; and GANASSI DEL FONTEGO: “Regola Rubertina,” 1542. Agricola’s and\r\nGerle’s works appeared in various editions. The work of the former, as\r\nwell as Luscinius’ “Musurgia,” are partly reproductions of Virdung’s\r\n“Musica getutscht.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAccording to the descriptions of the above-named authors, violas or\r\nviolins were of two kinds.[2] Some of them had no bridge, others, on\r\nthe contrary, were provided with one. For the object before us the last\r\nonly claim our consideration, of which, as well as of the bridgeless\r\nviolins, there were four different examples. The alto and the tenor\r\nwere the same size, but of different methods of tuning. The so-called\r\nviolas (fiddles) were provided with six strings which were called, like\r\nthe six lute chords, Great Bumhardt (Bombarte), middle ditto (tenor);\r\nsmall ditto (counter-tenor); middle string (great mean); vocal string\r\n(small mean); and quint string (treble). The “Great Bumhardt” was left\r\nout in those instruments provided with five strings only. In Italy the\r\nsix strings were called: Basso, Bordone, Tenore, Mezzanella or Mezzana,\r\nSottanella or Sotana, and Canto. In France, according to Mersennus:\r\nSixiesme, Cinquiesme, Quatriesme, Troisiesme, Seconde, and Chanterelle.\r\nThe same author gives for the violas the names: “Dessus,” “Haut Contre,”\r\n“Taille,” and “Basse Contre.”\r\n\r\nIn Judenkünig’s and Hans Gerle’s works are found the accompanying\r\nillustrations of stringed instruments provided with a bridge. Their\r\nidentity is unmistakable, though they differ from each other in many\r\npeculiarities of form. Both instruments represent the so-called “big\r\nfiddle”[3] or “Basso di Viola.” The tuning was that of the lute, which,\r\nas an older stringed instrument, served in this respect as its model.\r\nOnly in regard to the pitch did any difference exist. Judenkünig makes\r\nit thus:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHans Gerle, on the contrary, writes it thus:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere the pitch of the second is a fifth lower than the first.\r\nJudenkünig’s pitch represents the tenor and that of Gerle the bass.\r\nAgricola says in his “Musica instrumentalis,” regarding the height of\r\npitch for the lute:\r\n\r\n    “Zeuch die Quintsait so hoch du magst\r\n    Das sie nicht reist wenn du sie schlagst.”\r\n\r\n    (Draw up the fifth string as high as you may,\r\n    That it may not be broken when on it you play.)\r\n\r\nAnd in Hans Neusiedler’s Lute-book (1535) it is said: “He who wishes to\r\nlearn how to tune the lute, let him draw up the Quint string, not too\r\nhigh, and not too low, a medium height, as much as the strings will\r\nbear.” Similar instructions are to be found in Gerle’s “Musica Teutsch.”\r\n\r\nThe capability of tension of the Quint string was consequently the\r\nguide for the pitch in tuning the lute--beyond this there was as yet\r\nno normal pitch--and in stringed instruments it was in every case so\r\nmaintained. In playing with wind instruments the stringed instruments\r\nhad, therefore, to adapt the pitch to them.\r\n\r\nThe “great violins” were, in the first half of the sixteenth century at\r\nleast, according to all appearance played in two ways. From the drawing\r\nin Judenkünig’s treatise, a mode of handling is seen which requires no\r\nfurther explanation. That the handling of the “great violin” represented\r\nby Judenkünig without any explanation is treated of as not exceptional\r\nappears also from the accompanying vignette of another publication of\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bass viol performing with the two lutists represents the same\r\nposition and manner of playing as the woodcut in Judenkünig’s treatise,\r\nwith the sole difference that he is holding his instrument in the left\r\nhand, whereas the peg-box of the instrument, bent sharply backwards,\r\nof Judenkünig’s player rests on his shoulder. It is very evident that\r\nin both cases scarcely more could be executed than the simplest bass\r\naccompaniment. More, however, was eventually to be produced according\r\nto the treatment of the “great violin” prescribed by Gerle. He says\r\nregarding it: “When you have according to my instructions ‘beschriben’\r\n(noted),[4] tuned and drawn up the violin, and wish to begin playing,\r\nproceed thus: Take the neck of the instrument in the left hand and the\r\nbow in the right, sit down and press the viola between the legs, that\r\nyou may not strike it with the bow, and take care when you play that you\r\ndraw the bow directly and evenly over the strings neither too far from\r\nnor too near the bridge[5] on which the strings lie, and that you do\r\nnot draw the bow over two strings at once, but only over that which is\r\nplaced under the figuring in the Tablature, and this must be especially\r\nattended to.”\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to Gerle’s instructions, that the instrument\r\nof which he speaks was a so-called “Knee violin”--in Italian, “Viola\r\nda gamba.” It seems, however, that in the sixteenth century this\r\ndescription was not in common use. Hans Gerle, a native of Nuremberg,\r\nborn about 1500, had already received important consideration during\r\nthe first twenty years of the sixteenth century, not only as a skilful\r\nperformer, but also as a maker of lutes and viols. Yet the making of\r\nthese instruments, and especially of viols, had already been carried on\r\nat a much earlier period by others. The oldest fiddle or viola maker\r\nof whom we have any mention is a certain Kerlino, who, according to\r\nFétis’s account, lived and worked in Brescia. It is most probable that\r\nhe was a German, or at least of German extraction, for the name Kerl,\r\nin every kind of variation, both as a common and individual or family\r\nname, had been constantly in use among the German races. In the German\r\ndictionary[6] of the Brothers Grimm are indicated the various forms of\r\nthe name “Kerl”: Kerle, formerly Kärle; Kerls, Kerles, Kerlis, Kerli,\r\nKerlin, Kerel, Kaerl, Kerdel, and Kirl. They are of German origin,\r\nand are derived from middle or low German, whereas the Anglo-Saxon\r\nequivalents are “Carl,” or “Ceorl.”\r\n\r\nOriginally the word “Kerl” (kerle), according to Grimm, was synonymous\r\nwith “Mann” (man), and also with Ehemann (husband). But it was also used\r\nas a family or tribal name, as is proved from the names Jacob de Kerle\r\n(sixteenth century), Joh. Kaspar von Kerll (also written Kerl, Kherl,\r\nCherle), born 1628, and Vitus Kerle (in the eighteenth century).[7]\r\n\r\nAnother form of “Kerl,” Kerlin, was, according to Grimm, used in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Who can doubt then that the\r\nBrescian instrument maker Kerlino was of German origin?[8] He was,\r\nevidently, originally called Kerl or Kerlin, to which name was added by\r\nthe Italians either the diminutive syllable “ino” or the vowel “o.” It\r\ncannot be of Italian origin, for the Italian has no “k.”\r\n\r\nFétis informs us that Kerlino must be considered as the founder of the\r\nschool of Brescian viola makers which, as the oldest in Italy from the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, attained such a great reputation,\r\nthrough Gaspar da Salò and his reputed pupil, Giov. Paolo Maggini. If\r\nwhat appears so extremely probable has any real foundation, to a German,\r\nor, at least, to a man of German extraction, must be justly conceded the\r\nmerit of having, in a measure, been the originator of the art of Italian\r\nstringed instrument making which later on developed to the highest\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nFurther, we learn from Fétis that in the year 1804 a Parisian violin\r\nmaker, named Koliker, was in possession of a violin which had been\r\npreviously described by the French writer on music, de la Borde,\r\ncontaining the inscription\r\n\r\n    “JOAN. KERLINO, ANN. 1449,”\r\n\r\nand which originally had been a “Viola da braccio.” Doubtless this\r\nremarkable instrument exists at the present time. Fétis, who saw it\r\nhimself, describes its quality of tone as “agreeably soft and faintly\r\nsubdued.” Among the composers who wrote for the viola, we must mention\r\nGiov. Battista Bonometti, born at Bergamo about the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In 1615 he caused to be published in Vienna a collection of\r\ntrios for two violas and a bass.\r\n\r\nAfter Kerlino there appeared in North Italy as noted lute and viola\r\nmakers the monk Pietro Dardelli, in Mantua about 1500; Gaspard\r\nDuiffopruggar, in Bologna, 1510; Venturi Linarolli (Linelli), in Venice,\r\n1520; Peregrino Zanetto, in Brescia in 1530; and Morglato Morella, in\r\nVenice, 1550. Amongst these G. Duiffopruggar is evidently of German\r\nbirth,[9] and remarkable as having, as far as we can see, made the first\r\nviolins.\r\n\r\nThis artist was in 1515 summoned to France by King Francis I.; he at\r\nfirst lived in Paris and then at Lyons. He made some excellent Bass\r\nviols (Gambas), of which two fine specimens are extant in France. A\r\nsimilar bass viol was represented by Raphael in his painting of St.\r\nCecilia. This splendid picture, in the Pinacothek at Bologna, existed in\r\n1515.\r\n\r\nAfter Duiffopruggar, Andreas Amati (1520 to about 1580), the founder of\r\nthe Cremona school, distinguished himself in the making of violas (as\r\nwell as violins). His instruments obtained such a great reputation that\r\nCharles IX. of France, an enthusiastic amateur of music, had twenty-four\r\nviolins, six tenors, and eight basses made by him. Amongst the latter\r\nthere were several bass viols, like the viola da gamba. The instruments\r\nmade for Charles IX. by Andrea Amati were every one of them destroyed\r\nduring the French Revolution of 1792.[10]\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with Andreas Amati the manufacture of stringed\r\ninstruments was vigorously carried on by Gaspard da Salò, in Brescia.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, from the second half of the sixteenth century, LAUXMIN\r\nPOSSEN, in 1550, at Schongau, subsequently instrument maker for the\r\nHofkapelle at Munich; JOH. KOHL, who at the same time worked at Munich\r\nand in 1599 was appointed Court instrument maker there, and also JOACHIM\r\nTIELKE were successively celebrated. The latter lived, as Gerber informs\r\nus, at Hamburg from about 1660 to 1730, and even made lutes of real\r\nivory and ebony, the necks of which were inlaid with gold and silver and\r\nmother-of-pearl, but one especially with nine pegs of the most beautiful\r\ntortoiseshell. Tielke, however, made also violins and excellent gambas.\r\nOne of these, a costly instrument which was formerly in the possession\r\nof the Elector Joh. Wilhelm of the Palatinate,[11] was brought from\r\nMannheim to the Duke of Maxburg’s Museum at Munich, and thence into the\r\nRoyal Bavarian National Museum, where it is preserved as a treasure of\r\nrare value. The peg-box, the fingerboard, the tail-piece, the sides,\r\nand the back are all decorated with designs of flowers, foliage, and\r\ntendrils, as well as symbolical and allegorical representations taken\r\nfrom mythology, the subjects representing for the most part love and\r\nmusic. These decorations and designs are inlaid work in tortoiseshell,\r\nivory, ebony, mother-of-pearl and silver.[12]\r\n\r\nAnother valuable specimen of a gamba made by Tielke in the year 1701,\r\nwhich belonged to the famous cello virtuoso, F. Servais, has been\r\ndescribed and represented by A. J. Hipkins, of Edinburgh, in his lately\r\npublished work, “Musical Instruments: Historic, Rare and Unique.”[13]\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the sixteenth century there must have been a\r\nconsiderable multiplication of the different kinds of violas then in\r\nuse, and especially of the bass viol, for Michael Prätorius mentions\r\nin his “Syntagma musicum,” which appeared in 1614-1620, the following\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n1. Very large Bass Viol with four strings (corresponding to the modern\r\nContrabasso).\r\n\r\n2. Great Bass Viol de Gamba in three different tunings, with five and\r\nalso six strings (also like the Contrabasso).\r\n\r\n3. Small Bass Viol de Gamba, five different examples with six, four,\r\nand three strings (answering in tone, in some measure, to the modern\r\nVioloncello).\r\n\r\n4. Tenor and Alto Viol de Gamba, in two different pitches, with six,\r\nfive, four, and three strings (answering partly to the Violoncello and\r\npartly to the modern Tenor).\r\n\r\n5. Cant Viol de Gamba (Violetta piccola), four different kinds with six,\r\nfive, four, and three strings (the tone also partly answering to the\r\nTenor and partly to the Violin).\r\n\r\n6. Viol Bastarda, in five different pitches, with six strings (the tone\r\ncorresponding to that of the Cello).\r\n\r\n7. Viola de Braccio, four different examples, with five and four strings\r\n(corresponding in tone partly to the Violoncello and partly to that of\r\nthe Tenor).\r\n\r\nMoreover, Prätorius mentions, under the heading “Viole de Braccio\r\nViols,” the “Discant Viol” (our modern Violin), the small “Discant Viol”\r\n(tuned a fourth higher than our Violin), and two “very small Viols with\r\nthree strings,” of which the lowest string of the first is a ninth and\r\nof the second an octave higher than the G String of the Violin.\r\n\r\nOf the multitude of these different kinds of Viols then in use, which\r\nlater on by manifold improvements were gradually reduced to a smaller\r\nnumber, until they resulted in the modern Violin and Tenor, as well as\r\nthe Violoncello and Contrabasso, we must keep in view, for the object of\r\nthe present work, the “Viola da Gamba” only, which must be regarded as\r\nthe precursor of the violoncello. Prätorius gives a sketch (annexed) of\r\nthe so-named instrument.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these gambas with the sketches of viols by Judenkünig\r\nand Gerle shows what substantial alterations the stringed instrument in\r\nquestion underwent in the course of the second half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The neck had assumed a more modern and more convenient form\r\nfor the technique of the left hand and the sounding-board had acquired\r\nmore elegant and attractive outlines. At the same time the sound-holes,\r\ncorresponding to the curves of the belly, were turned round and placed\r\nin a position more agreeable to the eye.\r\n\r\nPrätorius expresses himself regarding the Viola da Gamba as follows:\r\n“Violas, viols, and violuntzes[14] are of two kinds--1. Viole de gamba;\r\n2. Viole de braccio (or de brazzio)--and the former is so called from\r\nhaving been held between the legs; for gamba is an Italian word and\r\nmeans a leg; le gambe, the legs. And since they have much larger bodies\r\nand, on account of the length of the neck, have strings of a much longer\r\ntension, they produce a mellower resonance than others, ‘di braccio,’\r\nwhich are held on the arm. The two kinds are distinguished by town\r\nmusicians: the viole de gamba by the name of violas: the viole ‘di\r\nbraccio’ (among which Prätorius includes violins) by the name of fiddles\r\nor pollish fiddles....\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The Violes de Gamba have six strings and are tuned in fourths and in\r\nthe middle a third, exactly like the six-stringed lute. Englishmen\r\nwhen they play them alone sometimes tune them a fourth, sometimes a\r\nfifth lower, so that the lowest strings are tuned--the bass to D, the\r\ntenor and alto to A, and the canto to E. On other occasions each one\r\n(reckoning by the chamber-pitch)[15] a fifth lower--as, for example,\r\nthe bass to G G, the tenor and alto to D, the canto to A; and tuning in\r\nthis manner produces much more agreeable, grander, and more majestic\r\nharmonies than when the instruments are at the usual pitch.”\r\n\r\nWhat Prätorius says regarding the mode and way of English viol-tuning\r\nis supplemented by Mersennus in his “Harmonie Universelle” (1636-37).\r\nThis author says: “Il faut remarquer que les Anglois ioüent\r\nordinairement leurs pièces un ton plus bas que les Français, afin\r\nd’entendre l’harmonie plus douce et plus charmante, et conséquemment que\r\nleur sixiesme chorde à vuide fait le C sol au lieu que la nostre fait le\r\nD re sol.”\r\n\r\nThe pitch then in England was a varying one, though the series of\r\nintervals borrowed from the lute, to which the gamba like the bass viol\r\nwas tuned, were those which commonly prevailed.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, Mersennus gives no more explicit directions for the\r\nhandling of the Viola da Gamba than Prätorius. He does not use this\r\nname for the instrument in question, but calls it “Basse de Viole.”\r\nThe French designation, “Viole de jambe,” corresponding to the Italian\r\nname, appears consequently to have been in vogue later and to have been\r\ngenerally little used.\r\n\r\nLike Gerle’s “great fiddle” (Basso di Viola), the Viola da Gamba had\r\nalso as a rule seven frets on the fingerboard like the lute, for fixing\r\nthe tones and semitones.\r\n\r\nThe gamba was played in various ways, and used for a variety of musical\r\npurposes, as a solo instrument, as well as in orchestral performances,\r\nand as an accompaniment to singing. The way in which it was valued\r\nduring the first half of the seventeenth century as an obbligato\r\naccompaniment to singing, may be seen from the preface to Heinrich\r\nSchütz’s “Historia of the joyful and victorious resurrection of our\r\nonly Saviour,” and so on, published in 1623. It is there said, after\r\nSchütz has named the instruments which are to accompany the parts of the\r\nEvangelists: “But when it can be done it is better that the organ and\r\neverything else should be left out and instead of these only four Viole\r\ndi Gamba (which must also be present), should be used to accompany the\r\nparts of the Evangelists.”\r\n\r\n“It will, however, be necessary that the four viols should be thoroughly\r\n‘_practised_’ with the part of the Evangelist in the following manner:\r\nThe Evangelist takes his part to himself, and recites it straight\r\nthrough without any fixed time, just as it seems correct to him, but\r\nnot holding longer on one syllable than is customary in ordinary slow\r\nand distinct speaking. The violas must not mark any particular time,\r\nbut only pay attention to the words recited by the Evangelist, and to\r\ntheir parts written below the ‘falso-bordone’ and so doing they cannot\r\ngo wrong. A viola may also ‘passegiren’ amongst the others, as is usual\r\nwith the falso-bordone,[16] and this gives a good effect.”\r\n\r\nIt appears from the explanation that the gambas were used to support the\r\nharmonies of recitatives. The “passegiren” suggested by Schütz of one\r\nof the accompanying violas was nothing else than the usual improvised\r\nornamental colorature or diminuendos used at that time and up to the\r\neighteenth century.[17]\r\n\r\nFor solo playing gambas were used not only for the execution of\r\nmonotone--viz., compositions of one part only; but also for several\r\nparts, and especially for double-stops and chords.\r\n\r\nThe oldest French gambist of whom we have any account is a certain\r\nGranier. Gerber says, concerning him, that he had been “in the service\r\nof Queen Margaret of France,” and died, about 1600, in Paris, and that\r\nhe was the greatest artist of his time on the gamba.\r\n\r\nConcerning the artistic use of violas, amongst which, as already said,\r\ngambas were included, Mersennus writes as follows: “Encore que les\r\nVioles soient capables de toutes sortes de musique, et que les exemples\r\nque j’ay donné (_sic_) pour le concert,[18] des violons leur puissent\r\nservir, néantmoins elles demandent des pièces, plus tristes et plus\r\ngraves, et dont la mesure soit plus longue et plus tardiue; de là vient\r\nqu’elles sont plus propres pour accompagner les voix. Or l’on peut jouer\r\ntoutes sortes de pièces non seulement à cinq parties, comme l’on fait\r\nordinairement sur les Violons, mais à six, à sept, à douze et à tout\r\nautant de parties que l’on veut.”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the above-quoted passage it is remarked, that\r\nviolas were used for every kind of music, but the use of these\r\ninstruments for solo playing is not expressly mentioned. In another\r\npassage of his work Mersennus says, however, with regard to gamba\r\nplaying and the French performers of his time:--\r\n\r\n“Personne en France n’égale Maugars et Hottman, hommes très habiles\r\ndans cet art: ils excellent dans les diminutions et par leurs traits\r\nd’archet incomparables de delicatesse et de suaveté. Il n’y a rien dans\r\nl’harmonie qu’ils ne savent exprimer avec perfection, surtout lorsqu’une\r\nautre personne les accompagne sur le clavicorde. Mais le premier exécute\r\nseul et à la fois deux, trois ou plusieurs parties sur la basse de viole\r\navec tant d’ornements et un prestesse de doigts dont il parait si peu se\r\npréoccuper, qu’on n’avait rien entendu de pareil auparavant par ceux qui\r\njouaient de la viole ou même de tout autre instrument.....”\r\n\r\nIt is here clearly expressed that solo playing on the gamba, and notably\r\nin several parts, was much cultivated and highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Maugars[19] here mentioned by Mersennus expresses himself regarding\r\nhis own performances as a gamba player in his “Réponse fait a un curieux\r\nsur le sentiment de la Musique d’Italie écrite à Rome le premier\r\nOctobre, 1639,” which was published either at the end of 1639 or the\r\nbeginning of 1640. After having spoken of his intercourse with the\r\nartistic family Baroni during his residence in Rome, he relates:--\r\n\r\n“In this worthy house, at the solicitation of these gifted people, I\r\nwas induced for the first time to exhibit in Rome the talent with\r\nwhich God had endowed me. It happened in the presence of ten or twelve\r\nof the most experienced people of Italy, who, after they had listened\r\nto me attentively, bestowed on me some eulogiums; not, however, quite\r\nungrudgingly.\r\n\r\n“In order to test me further the Signora Leonora (Baroni) induced me to\r\nleave my viola at her house, and begged me to return the following day.\r\nThis I did, and as it was reported to me by a friend that it was said I\r\nplayed studied things very well, on the second occasion I gave them so\r\nmany kinds of preludes and fantasias that they really granted me more\r\nappreciation than the first time. The respect, however, of these worthy\r\npeople did not succeed in winning over the experts, who were somewhat\r\nover-refined and reticent to concede applause to a foreigner. It was\r\ntold me they acknowledged that I played very well alone, and that they\r\nhad never heard such harmonised viola playing, but they doubted if I\r\nwere capable of extemporising a theme and playing variations on it. You\r\nknow, sir, that in this I am not a little successful. The same words\r\nhad been told me on the eve of St. Louis’ day in the French church,\r\nwhile I was listening to the fine music then being performed there. This\r\ndetermined me on the next day, excited thereto by the name of Saint\r\nLouis, as well as for the honour of the nation and the thirty-three\r\ncardinals who were present and taking part in the Mass, to ascend\r\ninto the gallery. When I had been greeted with applause, I was given\r\nfifteen to twenty notes, in order to make myself heard after the third\r\nKyrie with the accompaniment of a small organ. This subject I treated\r\nwith such infinite variety that great satisfaction was shown, and the\r\ncardinals caused me to be invited to play again after the Agnus Dei.\r\n\r\n“I considered myself very fortunate that I had been able to afford this\r\nlittle pleasure to so distinguished a company. I was given another\r\nsomewhat more cheerful theme than the first, which I treated with\r\nso many variations and such a diversity of movements that they were\r\nextremely astonished, and immediately came to me in order to requite me\r\nwith eulogiums. On account of the friendship which you cherish for me,\r\nmy dear sir, I am convinced you will not accuse me of vanity in this\r\ndigression. I have only made it in order that you may know that if a\r\nFrenchman desires to gain a reputation in Rome he must be well armed;\r\nand so much the more because it is thought here that we are not capable\r\nof improvising on a given theme. In fact, whoever plays an instrument\r\ndeserves no extraordinary consideration, unless he shows himself equal\r\nto such a demand, especially for the viola--to play on which, by reason\r\nof its few strings and the consequent difficulty of playing in parts,\r\nis always a thankless task--it is necessary to possess some individual\r\ntalent in order to be inspired by a subject and expand into beautiful\r\ninventions as well as agreeable variations. The capacity to do this\r\nrequires two real and innate qualifications--viz., a lively and strong\r\nimagination and skilful execution, in order promptly to carry out one’s\r\nideas.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe unlimited tribute of praise which Mersennus pays to the performances\r\nof Maugars, renders credible the remarkable account given by himself.\r\nMaugars’ gamba playing excited in Rome the greatest consideration,\r\nbecause at that time neither there nor anywhere else in Italy was there\r\nany prominent artist for that instrument. “As regards viola playing,\r\nMaugars declares there is no one in Italy who is distinguished for it,\r\nand in Rome it is very little cultivated. This has greatly astonished\r\nme, as formerly they had a certain Horace of Parma who performed\r\nwonderfully on this instrument, and left behind him some excellent\r\ncompositions, which some of our musicians cleverly made use of for other\r\ninstruments besides those for which they were composed. The father of\r\nthe great Italian, Ferabosco, was the first to make them known to the\r\nEnglish, who from that time have excelled all other nations.”\r\n\r\nFrom the last words it is to be inferred that gamba playing in\r\nEngland was much in vogue at the time of Maugars. The Ferabosco\r\n(Ferrabosco)--with the christian name of Alfonso--mentioned by him, who\r\nfirst made the English acquainted with this art, can be no other than\r\nthe composer of that name referred to by Fétis as born in Italy about\r\n1515. He settled in London about 1540, and about the year 1587 appears\r\nto have been in the service, as “gentilumo,” of the Duke of Savoy.[21]\r\n\r\nAmongst English gambists of distinction must be named Thomas Robinson,\r\nTobias Hume, William Brade, and John Jenkins. Probably they were all\r\npupils of the elder Ferabosco.\r\n\r\nConcerning THOMAS ROBINSON, who was born in the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century, and lived and worked in the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth in London, nothing further is known than that he published\r\na curious work under the title, “The Schoole of Musicke: the perfect\r\nmethod of true fingering the Lute, Pandora, Orpharion, and Viol da\r\ngamba. London, 1603.”\r\n\r\nHis contemporary, TOBIAS HUME, was an officer in the English army, and\r\nspent much of his time in Sweden. He was reputed one of the cleverest\r\ngambists of that period; he caused to be published, in 1605, a work\r\nwith the following title: “The first part of Ayres, French, Pollish,\r\nand others together, some in Tabliture and some in Pricke song. With\r\nPauines, Galliards, and Almaines for the Viole di gamba, and other\r\nMusicall Conceites for two Basse-viols, expressing five partes, with\r\npleasant Reportes one from the other; and also for two Leero-Viols, and\r\nalso for the Leero-Viole with two Treble Viols, or two with one Treble.\r\nLastly, for the Leero-Viole to play alone; and some Songes to bee sung\r\nto the Viole with the Lute, or better with the Viole alone. Also an\r\nInvention for two to play upon one Viole. Composed by Tobias Hume,\r\ngentleman. Printed by John Windet Loud, dwelling at the sign of the\r\nCross Keyes, at Powles Wharfe, 1605.” It is evident that the composition\r\nof arrangements for two instruments, which might also be played on one\r\nonly, was no invention of the Salzburg violinist, Joh. Hein. Biber.[22]\r\nIn 1607 he published another work, under the title “Captain Hume’s\r\nPoeticall Musicke, principally made for two basse viols yet so contrived\r\nthat it may be plaied eight severall waies upon sundry instruments\r\nwith much facilitie. London.” This work, of which the British Museum\r\npossesses a copy, was dedicated to Anne of Denmark. He was received into\r\nthe Charterhouse as a poor brother in 1629, and known as “Captain Hume.”\r\nHis mind seems to have given way, and he died there on April 16, 1645.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRADE flourished about 1615, and spent much of his life out of\r\nEngland. He was appointed violist to the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and\r\nof the city of Hamburg at the beginning of the seventeenth century. In\r\n1619 he seems to have been Capellmeister to the Margrave of Brandenburg\r\nand went subsequently to Berlin. He was esteemed a good performer on\r\nthe gamba, and published in 1609, 1614, and 1621 a number of Paduans or\r\nPavans, Gaillards, Canzonets, Volts, Courantes, in five and six parts\r\n(Berlin, 1621). A great confusion exists regarding the bibliography of\r\nhis works, authorities differ as to their titles. They are of unusual\r\ninterest, as containing many English airs, some of which are mentioned\r\nby Shakespeare. He is said to have died at Frankfort in 1647.\r\n\r\nJOHN JENKINS, born at Maidstone in 1592, was one of the most celebrated\r\ncomposers of music for viols. In early life he made choice of music as\r\na profession, and was appointed musician in ordinary to Charles I. He\r\nlived in the family of Sir Hamon l’Estrange and instructed his sons in\r\nmusic. In 1660 he gave lessons to the sons of Lord North at a salary of\r\n£1 a quarter! Roger North in his autobiography calls him, “that eminent\r\nmaster of his time, Mr. Jenkins, not conceited nor morose, but much a\r\ngentleman.” He was appointed musician to Charles II., and spent the last\r\nyears of his life with Sir Philip Wodehouse, at Kimberley, in Norfolk,\r\nwhere he died on October 27, 1678. He had for his time extraordinary\r\ncapacity on the lute, viol, and several bowed instruments, and wrote\r\na great number of compositions for viols, which were not printed; but\r\nin 1660 he published “Twelve Sonatas for two violins and a bass, with\r\na thorough-bass for the organ or theorbo” (London, 1660), the first of\r\nthe kind produced by an Englishman. Indeed he is credited with having\r\nbeen the earliest English composer of instrumental music. Most of\r\nhis compositions he called Rants or Fancies. He also wrote music for\r\n“Theophila, or Love’s Sacrifice; a Divine Poem, by Edward Benlowes,\r\nEsq., several parts thereof set to fit Aires by Mr. Jenkins” (London,\r\n1652). Many of his MSS. exist at Christchurch, Oxford. Hawkins reports\r\nthat it was said of him, “he was a little man, but had a great soul.”\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SIMPSON is another Englishman who stands out conspicuously as\r\na violist and gamba player; in 1615 he was appointed violist in the\r\nservice of the Prince of Holstein-Schaumberg. He published: Opusculum,\r\nNeuer Pavanen, Gaillards, Couranten und Volts (Frankfurt, 1610); besides\r\nPavanen, Volts und Gaillards (Frankfurt, 1611), and a “Tafel-Consort,”\r\ncontaining all kinds of cheerful songes for four Instruments and a\r\nThorough-Bass (Hamburg, 1621).\r\n\r\nJOHN COOPER, born about 1570, was a most distinguished performer on, and\r\ngood composer for the Viol da Gamba. In his youth he travelled in Italy,\r\nand returned with the Italianised name of Coperario. He was master to\r\nthe children of James I., who was himself not only very musical, but\r\nhad an excellent judgment on music. He is said to have played eight\r\ndifferent instruments, amongst them especially well the harp. Two of\r\nCooper’s pupils were the celebrated musicians, William and Henry Lawes.\r\nThe elder, William, besides his other numerous compositions, wrote his\r\n“Great Consort,” consisting of six Suites for two treble viols, two\r\ntheorbos, and two bass-viols. Charles I. was also Cooper’s pupil and\r\nplayed the gamba well, since he was able to perform the organ fantasias\r\nof his master on that instrument. Cooper published a great number of\r\ncompositions, and among them were many for the Gamba. He died during the\r\nProtectorate.\r\n\r\nBy far the most eminent English gamba player was CHRISTOPHER\r\nSYMPSON[23] (or Simpson), who was born at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and died in London between 1667 and 1670. He was a\r\nfollower of Charles I., and served as a soldier in the army commanded\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle against the Parliament. After the defeat of\r\nthe Royalists, Sir Rob. Bolles, an important adherent of this party,\r\ngranted him a refuge in his house and entrusted to him the education of\r\nhis son, John Bolles, who was noted as a very clever musical dilettante\r\nand player on the gamba; he died in Rome, 1676, where his mortal\r\nremains were laid in the Pantheon. Christopher Sympson is the author\r\nof several noteworthy instruction books on music, of which we shall\r\nmention only those relating to the viol da gamba. The first of them has\r\nthe title, “The Division-violist, or the Introduction to the playing\r\nupon a ground. Divided in two parts--the first, directing the hands,\r\nwith other preparative instructions; the second, laying open the manner\r\nand method of playing, or composing division to a ground. London: John\r\nPlayford. 1659.”[24] The title of the second of Sympson’s works referred\r\nto for the gamba is “A brief Introduction to the Skill of Music. In two\r\nbooks. The first contains the grounds and rules of music. The second,\r\ninstructions for the viol and also for the treble violin.[25] The third\r\nedition enlarged. To which is added a third book, entituled ‘The Art of\r\nDescant or Composing Music in Parts,’ by Dr. Thom. Campion,[26] with\r\nannotations thereon by Mr. Ch. Simpson. London, 1660.”\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BREWER was also a celebrated performer on the gamba, who was born\r\nin 1611. He was admitted to Christ’s Hospital at three years of age, and\r\nlearnt the viol from his music master. He composed various fantasias for\r\nhis favourite instrument, besides airs, catches, rounds, as well as\r\nPavins, Courantes, &c., for which kind of composition he seems to have\r\nbeen noted.\r\n\r\nThe English gambists of the first half of the seventeenth century must\r\nthen have had some considerable reputation abroad, for the Frenchman,\r\nAndré Maugars, already mentioned, went about 1620 to London, lived\r\nthere for nearly four years, and perfected himself after the models\r\nof the best gamba players. He does not seem to have had pupils. But\r\nhis compatriot and rival Hottmann[27] (or Hotteman) not only taught,\r\nbut distinguished himself especially by some charming compositions.\r\nOne of his most noted pupils was Marais (Marin), born in Paris on the\r\n31st of March, 1656. At first a choirboy in the Sainte Chapelle, he\r\neducated himself further under the direction of Hotteman, and then under\r\nSainte-Colombe, another excellent Parisian gamba player at that time.\r\nLully gave him instructions in composition. In 1685 Marais became solo\r\ngambist at the Court Chamber Music Concerts, which position he held\r\nuntil 1725. He died August 15, 1728.\r\n\r\nBesides Sainte-Colombe there were at that time two able French gamba\r\nplayers--namely, Desmarets and Baisson. Marais, however, excelled them\r\nin artistic execution. He added to the six strings of the instrument\r\ntuned in the accepted manner--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nalso a seventh, the A of the “contra octave.”[28] This enabled him to\r\nsurpass in harmonised playing all his predecessors and contemporaries.\r\nHe was the first who caused the lowest strings of the gamba to be\r\ncased in metal wire so as to give them greater tension and resonance,\r\na step in advance which was soon adopted for the two lower strings\r\nof the violoncello. Besides some operas, Marais was the author of a\r\nconsiderable number of gamba compositions which appeared in five parts.\r\nThe fifth of them, for one and two gambas with a bass, was printed in\r\n1705.\r\n\r\nOut of his nineteen children, three sons and a daughter devoted\r\nthemselves to the study of the gamba. Amongst them the most\r\ndistinguished for his performances was\r\n\r\nROLAND MARAIS. In the year 1725 he succeeded his father as solo\r\ngambist at the Royal Chamber Music Concerts, the prospect of which had\r\nbeen assured to him some years previously. Quantz, who heard him in\r\n1726, reported him as a very skilful player. He published, in 1711,\r\na “Nouvelle méthode de musique,” and in the years 1735 and 1738 two\r\nvolumes of gamba pieces with figured bass.\r\n\r\nThe Sainte-Colombe mentioned above had, besides Marais, two noteworthy\r\npupils, ROUSSEAU and HERVELOIS. Jean Rousseau perfected himself as a\r\ndistinguished gamba player, and was actively engaged in Paris during the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century. He also made himself more widely\r\nknown by the production of two “livres de pièces de viole,” as well as a\r\ngamba school, “Traité de la viole.” The latter work appeared in Paris in\r\n1687.\r\n\r\nCAIX DE HERVELOIS, born about 1670, became, under the direction of\r\nSainte-Colombe, an excellent player, and after further study entered\r\nthe service of the Duke of Orleans. In Amsterdam he had two books of\r\nhis compositions published: “Pièces pour la basse viole avec la basse\r\ncontinue.”\r\n\r\nAnother French gambist of distinction in the seventeenth century was\r\nAntoine Forqueray. He was born in 1671 in Paris, and was one of the\r\nperformers at the chamber music Concerts of Louis XIV. Forqueray\r\nreceived instruction from his father. At the age of five years he\r\nalready excited the astonishment of the king by his performances, who\r\ncalled him “his little wonder.” In the year 1745, on June 28, he died at\r\nNantes, whither he had retired upon his pension.\r\n\r\nHis son, Jean Baptiste Antoine, born on April 3, 1700, in Paris, was\r\nesteemed as the most able French gamba player of his time. He also at\r\nfive years of age was heard with such favourable result before Louis\r\nXIV. that he later on became a member of the royal music society. He\r\nagain had a son, whose christian name was Jean Baptiste, born about\r\n1728, who was also a gambist and published several books of compositions\r\nfor his instrument. He does not seem, however, to have made himself\r\nconspicuous as a performer.\r\n\r\nGerber mentions in his musical Lexicon a Parisian gambist of the\r\neighteenth century of the name of Forcroix, or Forcroy, “whose\r\ndelightful playing Quantz, who was in Paris in 1726, admired.” Possibly\r\nthis artist may be identified as the A. Forqueray mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe art of gamba playing was pursued in Germany with as great or perhaps\r\ngreater zeal than in England and France. While the pursuit of music by\r\nthe English and French was confined chiefly to London and Paris, there\r\nwere in Germany many courts who admired and cherished with fostering\r\ncare the art of music; and the result was, especially after the tumult\r\nof the thirty years’ war had subsided, a widely-spread musical life\r\nthroughout the whole of the German nation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the first German players to be mentioned is DAVID FUNK, born\r\nabout 1630, in the Saxon town of Reichenbach. Gerber says of him, he was\r\n“an excellent musician and master of the violin, the viola da gamba, the\r\nangelica,[29] the clavier, and guitar”; and then goes on: “Funk was in\r\nevery way a genius. His chief study, which he carried to no small degree\r\nof perfection, was that of the law. He was, besides, a wit and a poet,\r\nand was reckoned among the good German poets of that time. As a musician\r\nhe was not only a virtuoso on all the above-named instruments, but he\r\nwas also a composer, and won the applause of the public in a variety\r\nof styles, for the church as well as for the chamber.... How and where\r\nhe had gained all these distinctions there is no account. He was first\r\nknown as a composer in the year 1670, by the publication of his work on\r\nthe gamba.” This enthusiastic account emanated, according to Gerber’s\r\nreport, from the precentor Joh. Martin Steindorf, of Zwickau, who was\r\npersonally acquainted with Funk.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1682 Funk gave up his appointment in Reichenbach and\r\naccompanied the “East Friesland Princess” into Italy as secretary,\r\nwhere he remained with his mistress seven years. After her death there\r\nin 1689 he returned to his native land, and, driven by the necessity\r\nof beginning again to earn his livelihood, he had no other choice but\r\nto accept, at “Wohnsiedel (Wunsiedel?), the miserable post of organist\r\nand girls’ schoolmaster.” Funk’s dissolute character led him to misuse\r\nhis office as teacher to immoral purposes with the girls entrusted to\r\nhis care, so that he was compelled “by night and fog to fly in order to\r\nescape the rage of the parents.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time Funk led a vagabond life. He next betook himself to\r\nSchleitz, and remained three months at the Court there. Thence he\r\nwas obliged to decamp as he was rigorously pursued by the police of\r\nWohnsiedel. He made his way to Arnstadt, but did not reach that place.\r\nHe was found one day lying dead underneath a hedge.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as Funk, the virtuoso August Kühnel was at work--born\r\nAugust 5, 1645, in the little town of Delmenhorst, in Oldenburg. From\r\n1695 to 1700 he lived at Cassel, holding a position at the Court. During\r\nthis time he published “Sonatas or Parts for one or two Viole da gamba,\r\ntogether with a bass, 1698.” According to Gerber, several of his works\r\nshould be in the Museum at Cassel. In composition, Kühnel was a pupil\r\nof Agostino Steffani during his residence in Hanover. His successor in\r\noffice appears to have been a certain Tielke,[30] for he was from 1700\r\nto 1720 gambist in the Cassel chapel.\r\n\r\nAnother gambist of the name of Kühnel (Johann Michael) lived in the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century, and was engaged at the Berlin\r\nCourt. From here he went, in 1717, to Weimar, and later on to Dresden,\r\nin the service of Field-marshal Flemming. He seems to have ended his\r\nlife in Hamburg. Of his compositions there appeared at Rogers’s in\r\nAmsterdam, “Sonates à 1 et 2 Violes de gamba.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most important gamba players of Germany at the end of the\r\nseventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century was Johann Schenk.\r\nAs he appears to have had his second work, “Konst œffeningen,” printed\r\nat Amsterdam in 1688, consisting of fifteen sonatas for the gamba and\r\nbass, it may be concluded that he was born about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. Towards the end of it he was chamber musician in\r\nthe Elector Palatine’s service, which post however he must have given\r\nup at the beginning of the eighteenth century, for he is said to have\r\nsettled in Amsterdam about that time. Whether he remained there to the\r\nend of his life is doubtful, for on the title-page of his sixth work,\r\n“Scherzi musicali, per la viola di gamba con basso continuo ad libitum,”\r\nhe calls himself “Chamber Commissary and Chamberlain of the Elector\r\nPalatine.” On the other hand, Mattheson informs us that he (Schenk) was\r\nnamed inspector of the fish market, because he had played the gamba so\r\nwell! On the whole, he published eight works, chiefly pieces and sonatas\r\nfor the gamba, as well as for the violin with a bass; a copy of the\r\none, of which the title is mentioned above, is preserved in the Royal\r\nLibrary at Sondershausen. This comprehensive collection, consisting of\r\n101 musical pieces, is dedicated to the Elector Palatine Prince William,\r\nconsequently to the same art-devoted Prince to whom Corelli, in the year\r\n1712, dedicated his “Concerti Grossi.”[31]\r\n\r\nThe title-page of the “Scherzi musicali” bears no date, but it maybe\r\nassumed that they appeared between 1692 and 1693, for Schenk published\r\nhis Op. 3 in the first and his Op. 7 in the latter year, and the\r\ncollection in question, as already observed, bears 6 as the number of\r\nthe work. The compositions which it contains are grouped after the\r\nmanner of “Chamber Sonatas” or “Suite.” It is true that the author has\r\nmade use of neither of these terms, but the keys chosen by him leave\r\nno manner of doubt as to the description of instrumental compositions\r\nto which these “Scherzi musicali” belong. We know that it was usual\r\nfor all the subjects of a suite at that period to be in the same key.\r\nLooking from this point of view at Schenk’s work for the gamba, it is\r\napparent that it contains twelve suites or chamber sonatas, of which\r\nsome indeed are unusually long. For example, the second suite (F major)\r\nand the fourth (A minor) consist of fourteen pieces. Dances, such as\r\nAllemandes, Courantes, Sarabandes, Gigues, Gavottes, and Minuets, make\r\nup by far the greater portion of the volume. There are also a couple of\r\nBourrées; but then the composer gives also Chaconnes and Passacailles\r\nwith variations, which in some cases are of great length, as well as\r\nRondos and “Arias.” The fourth sonata contains moreover a Canzone and\r\nan “Allabreve”; the ninth, a Fugue; the eleventh, the same[32] and\r\nan Overture. The greater number of the suites begin with a Prelude,\r\nthough, on the contrary, the second begins with a Fantasia, the fourth\r\nwith a “Sonata con Basso obligato,” and the eighth with an “Overture,”\r\nthe ninth with a “Capriccio,” and the twelfth with a “Caprice.” The\r\nmode of writing alternates from one to several parts, and the chords,\r\nby frequently doubling the intervals, are extended to five notes\r\nstruck simultaneously. For the notation Schenk required four different\r\nkeys--viz., bass, alto, discant, and treble, by which means the compass\r\nextends from [Illustration] to [Illustration] We conclude from this\r\nthat Schenk, like the French gambist Marais, used a gamba with seven\r\nstrings, and, indeed, the highest of them must have been tuned up to\r\nthe one-lined G. Schenk must have gone considerably above the seventh\r\nfret of the fingerboard in order to reach the twice-lined B flat. With\r\nregard to the artistically musical quality of Schenk’s compositions for\r\nthe gamba, they are mediocre; they bear no comparison with the violin\r\ncompositions of Corelli of the same period. He succeeded best in the\r\ndances, compared with which the more elaborate productions appear poor\r\nand are in some measure incorrect. Especially is this true of the two\r\nso-called fugues, which do not rise above feeble attempts at fugues. It\r\nis, however, interesting to know what position Schenk took as one of the\r\nbest reputed gamba virtuosos at that time with regard to composition,\r\nfor his productions give an average idea of the executive capabilities\r\nof his contemporaries. At the same time, Schenk’s works prove very\r\nsurely what double-stoppings, chords, and figures were possible on the\r\ngamba, and in this respect reveal a remarkable richness in various\r\nstyles of playing.\r\n\r\nOpposed to this by its simplicity in a technical point of view is a\r\n“Sonata a Cembalo Obligato col Viol da Gamba,” by Handel. Double-stops\r\nand chords are altogether omitted. It is true that he has quite another\r\nobject in view, for Handel treated the gamba not like Schenk, as a\r\nsolo instrument, but as subsidiary only to carry out a musical idea,\r\nthus placing it on a level with the clavier. He chiefly uses also the\r\nmiddle positions of the gamba in the alto key throughout. Otherwise this\r\nSonata,[33] though solid in form, is of small importance, and gives the\r\nimpression of a composition quickly thrown off for some special\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nHandel’s great contemporary, Joh. Seb. Bach, treated this instrument,\r\nin his three sonatas composed for it and the clavier, in quite another\r\nmanner. It is true that with rare exceptions he makes no use of the\r\nscored and harmonised technique for the gamba; but the artistic and\r\ncomplete mode of working out by which all his instrumental works are\r\nmore or less distinguished is also peculiar to the gamba sonatas just\r\nmentioned, of which the most important are the first in G major and the\r\nthird in G minor.\r\n\r\nCharmingly and with characteristic effect did Bach employ the gamba in\r\nhis Passion Music from the Gospel of St. Matthew and St. John, as well\r\nas in some of his Cantatas. One has only to recall the splendid, deeply\r\ntouching alto aria “It is finished,” in the Passion Music of St. John.\r\nNow at the performance of this sublime work the gamba part in the aria\r\nreferred to is played by the violoncello, which does not quite express\r\nthe deeply melancholy, pathetic tone that Bach’s music was designed\r\nto express. But there is no more appropriate substitute in the modern\r\norchestra for the gamba than the violoncello.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of Joh. Seb. Bach is that, with a rare knowledge of art,\r\nhe made use for his purpose of all the instruments current in his time\r\nwhich adapted themselves in any way to the representation of a special\r\neffect. But he further conceived the idea of enriching the choir of\r\ninstruments by an invention of his own. During his work at Köthen he\r\nconstructed the “Viola Pomposa,” a stringed instrument of the cello\r\nkind, though, like the violin, for the hand, which had five strings\r\ntuned to C, G, d, a, ē--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGerber remarks concerning it: “The limited way in which the violoncello\r\nin Bach’s time was handled compelled him, for the quick basses in his\r\nworks, to the invention of the so-called viola pomposa, which, rather\r\nlonger and higher than a tenor, had a fifth string, e, in addition to\r\nthe four lower strings of the violoncello, and was placed on the arm.\r\nThis convenient instrument enabled the player to execute more easily the\r\nhigh and rapid passages which occurred.”\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from Bach’s Suites for Violoncello Solo, which were\r\noriginally written for the viola pomposa, the compass of this instrument\r\nextended from the great octave C [Illustration] to the thrice-accented\r\nG [Illustration] However, the “Viola pomposa” did not attain to general\r\nuse. It scarcely survived its inventor, and disappeared, as it seems,\r\neven before the gamba, out of the musical sphere.\r\n\r\nBach’s eldest son, Philipp Emmanuel, also wrote for the gamba. Amongst\r\nother things a sonata in three movements, with the clavier, in G\r\nminor,[34] which was apparently composed about 1759. The three-part\r\nmovement in this is solid, though somewhat meagre and dry.\r\n\r\nAmongst the gamba compositions of the previous century, which have\r\nlasted up to our time, there is also to be noted an unpublished Concerto\r\nby Joseph Tartini, the famous founder of the old Paduan violin school,\r\nwith accompaniment for four stringed instruments and two horns.[35]\r\nPossibly Tartini wrote it during his three years’ residence in Prague\r\n(1723-1726) for a German gambist, as about that time the gamba was\r\nstill cultivated in Germany with great enthusiasm, though it had been,\r\nin Italy, thrust into the background of music by the violoncello. The\r\nConcerto bears all the marks of the author’s manner of expression, but\r\nit is in the main quite as antiquated as all his violin concertos.\r\nThe introduction and _Finale_ are in G; the “Grave” between the two\r\nmovements is in D minor. The single part theme of the solo, with the\r\nexception of a few double-stoppings and chords, is throughout written\r\nin tenor and bass clef. It is worthy of remark that all the pieces are\r\nprovided before the full close with cadences, written at full length,\r\nfor the solo instrument, after Tartini’s usual manner in all his violin\r\nconcertos.\r\n\r\nAs a contemporary of Schenk, the War Minister of Hesse-Darmstadt, ERNST\r\nCHRISTIAN HESSE, who was born on the 14th April, 1676, in the Thuringian\r\ntown of Grossengottern, distinguished himself. Gerber says of him,\r\nthat he was the first and most famous gambist of his time in Germany.\r\nHaving spent his school years at Langensalza and Eisenach, he entered\r\nthe Darmstadt chancery service as supernumerary and followed the Court\r\nof his new master in 1694 to Giessen. At the Academy there he continued\r\nhis work and also his legal studies. In 1698 he had permission from the\r\nCourt to go to Paris in order to perfect himself there on the viol da\r\ngamba, which he had already begun to study in early life. He remained\r\nthere three years and had instruction at the same time from the two\r\nfamous masters, Marais and Forqueray. As privately they were at enmity\r\nwith each other he was compelled to give his name to one as Hesse and\r\nto the other as Sachs. Both were delighted with his skill and progress,\r\nand severally boasted of the excellent pupil whom he had taught. At last\r\nthey challenged each other to put to the test, in a concert arranged\r\nfor that object, the proficiency of their pupil. But what was their\r\nastonishment on Herr Hesse’s appearance to find he was the pupil of\r\nboth! He did his two masters, each in his own manner, special credit,\r\nbut immediately after the occurrence left Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to the Darmstadt Court, in the year 1702, Hesse was\r\nnamed Secretary of the War Department and Foreign Office. In the\r\nfollowing year he married.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1705 Hesse travelled through Holland and England, and\r\ntwo years later he betook himself to Italy, in order to increase his\r\nknowledge in the art of composition. Everywhere his gamba playing\r\nexcited the greatest admiration. On his return journey from Italy he\r\nvisited Vienna and was heard at Court, together with Hebenstreit,\r\nfamous in his time as the inventor of a dulcimer-like instrument,\r\ncalled Pantaleon. The Emperor was so charmed with his playing that he\r\npresented him with a gold chain and his portrait. In the year 1713 he\r\nlost his wife. About the same period the vacant post of Kapellmeister\r\nat the Darmstadt Court was given to him _ad interim_. He then married\r\nhis second wife, the famous singer, Johanna Eliz. Doebbrecht (Döbricht),\r\nand in 1715 he was promoted to the post of War Commissary and eleven\r\nyears later to the dignity of Minister of War. “In 1719,” says Gerber,\r\n“Hesse made another musical tour with his wife to Dresden, to the\r\nfamous festivals held in honour of the Elector’s marriage and where\r\nseveral operas by Lotti and Heinichen were represented. They both\r\ngained extraordinary honour and abundant appreciation. From this time\r\nhe devoted himself quietly to the Court until his eighty-sixth year,\r\nand died May 16, 1762, after he had participated in every kind of good\r\nfortune. Besides the airs which he arranged for the church during the\r\ntime that he filled the Kapellmeister’s vacancy, he left behind him many\r\nSonatas and Suites for the Viola da gamba, which fully bring out all\r\nthe possibilities of this instrument.”\r\n\r\nHesse had twenty children, only eight of whom, however, survived him.\r\nHis eldest son, Louis Christian, became, under his father’s tuition, a\r\nclever gambist, and entered as such into the service of the Prince of\r\nPrussia in 1768.\r\n\r\nBesides his son, Hesse formed the excellent gamba player, JOH. CHRIST.\r\nHEXTEL, born 1699, in the Swabian town of Oettingen. His father, who was\r\nKapellmeister to the Prince of Oettingen, and then worked in the same\r\ncapacity at the Ducal Court of Merseburg, wished that the boy should\r\nstudy, and entered him, in 1716, at the University of Halle. Here he\r\noccupied himself by preference with music, and when he returned home he\r\ngained his father’s permission to devote himself exclusively to the art.\r\nThe Duke of Merseburg announced his willingness to grant him the means\r\nof pursuing his studies either in Paris, under Marais and Forqueray, or\r\nat Darmstadt, under Hesse’s direction. The young Hextel himself decided\r\nfor Hesse, who took him as a pupil under exceptional conditions. After\r\ntwo years’ study he left Darmstadt, performed at concerts at the Courts\r\nof Eisenach, Merseburg, Weissenfels, Zerbst, and Köthen, and accepted a\r\npost in the Eisenach Kapelle. During the years 1723-27 he was travelling\r\nin Germany and Holland; played in 1732 before Frederick the Great at\r\nRuppin, while he was still Crown Prince; and then undertook the post\r\nof Concert Director at Eisenach. When, after the death of its prince\r\n(1742), the Eisenach band was dissolved, through the recommendation\r\nof Franz Benda he was appointed Concert Director at the Court of\r\nStrelitz. He filled this place until 1753, and died a year after. Of his\r\nnumberless compositions only six sonatas for violin “solo e continuo,”\r\n1727, were published at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nAs noteworthy German gambists belonging to the first half of the\r\neighteenth century must be mentioned--\r\n\r\nEMMERLING, HARD, and BELLERMAN. The former of these, born at Eisleben,\r\nwas in the year 1730 Chamber Musician and Viola da Gambist to the\r\nMargrave Louis of Brandenburg, and also, as Gerber says, instrumental\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\nJOH. DANIEL HARD, born May 8, 1696, in Frankfurt on the Main, remained\r\nat the outset of his musical career for five years in the service of\r\nKing Stanislaus during his residence at Zweibrücken, and then was\r\nChamber Musician to the Bishop of Würzburg and the Duke of Franken, Joh.\r\nPhil. Franz von Schönborn. After four years he gave up this service\r\nand took a post as Chamber Musician at the Wurtemburg Court. Later on\r\nhe again became Concertmeister and finally Capellmeister to the Duke\r\nCarl Eugene. He still filled this office at Stuttgard in 1757. Further\r\naccounts of him are wanting.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINE BELLERMAN, “Imperial Crowned Poet” (poet laureate), as\r\nGerber calls him, studied as amateur gamba player. He was born in 1696\r\nat Erfurt, there studied law, and also pursued music theoretically and\r\npractically, playing the lute, gamba, violin, and flute. He was called\r\nto Münden as Cantor, and then, in 1741, as Rector of the School there.\r\n\r\nOf his many unpublished compositions, there are amongst them Church\r\npieces, Cantatas, an Opera, Suites for the lute, Concertos for the Oboe\r\nd’Amour and the Flute, Clavier Concertos with violin, and Overtures;\r\nhere only six Sonatas for Flute, Gamba, and Clavier will be noticed. The\r\nyear of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nAmongst the German gambists of the first half of the eighteenth century\r\na lady held a prominent position, DOROTHEA V. RIED, one of the five\r\ndaughters of the Austrian musician, Fortunatus Ried. Johann Frauenlob\r\nsays of them, according to Gerber, in his Essay on Learned Women: “That\r\nalthough two of them were still very young--one was scarcely eight years\r\nold--their father had brought them on so well in music that with their\r\ntwo brothers they had given at Vienna, Prague, Leipsic, Wittenberg, and\r\nother places such evident proofs of their talent as to have excited\r\nuniversal admiration, for people thought they heard heavenly rather than\r\nearthly music.”\r\n\r\nHere also must be mentioned a royal personage--namely, the Elector\r\nMAXIMILIAN JOSEPH, born March 28, 1728; died December 30, 1777. He\r\nplayed the violin and the cello, but was especially an excellent\r\ngambist. Burney, who heard him in 1772, says that he needed not to\r\nbe a great prince in order to discover that his skill, his rendering\r\nof adagio, and his accuracy in time were perfect. Maximilian also\r\ncomposed. His teacher for composition was Bernasconi.\r\n\r\nFinally, CARL FRIEDRICH ABEL must also be mentioned as a gambist of\r\nthe first rank. He was born at Köthen, 1725, where his father held\r\nthe appointment of gamba player in the Hofkapelle. “The young Abel,”\r\nsays Gerber, “seems to have had instruction, as Thomas’ scholar, at\r\nLeipsic, from the great Seb. Bach; then came in 1748 to the Hofkapelle\r\nat Dresden, where, during the more flourishing period of Hasse’s life,\r\nand for nearly ten years, he found time enough to form his taste.[36]\r\nHis small salary and a split with the director Hasse caused him to leave\r\nthat Court, according to Burney, in 1758, with three thalers in his\r\npurse. In order to increase this capital, he went on foot to Leipsic,\r\nladen with the MS. of six symphonies, where, through the generosity of\r\nthe publisher of these symphonies, he became six ducats richer. He now\r\nwent from one German court to another, and, by repeated good receptions\r\nand applause, he regained not a little confidence. Finally he turned to\r\nLondon, in 1759, where he found a great patron in the lately deceased\r\nDuke of York, who supported him until the formation of the Queen’s Band,\r\nto which he was appointed in the capacity of chamber musician, receiving\r\nan annual payment of £300.\r\n\r\n“This salary was considerably increased by the music dealers giving him\r\na stipulated sum of £150 for six symphonies. His duty at the Queen’s\r\nConcerts was generally to play the tenor on his gamba, and now and\r\nthen, in the absence of Bach,[37] to accompany on the piano. For some\r\nyears he lived in Paris during the summer, where he found in the house\r\nof a _fermier-général_ not only a friendly reception, but also what he\r\nliked better than all, the best of wine. On his first appearance in\r\nLondon, his discretion, his taste, and his pathetic manner of expression\r\nin the rendering of his adagios so captivated the young virtuosi that\r\nthey very soon followed his school, with less expenditure of notes and\r\nwith more successful result. His taste and knowledge especially made\r\nhim the umpire on all contested points, so that he was looked upon in\r\nall difficult cases as an infallible oracle. With his dexterity on the\r\ngamba he also possessed the talent, like many other older virtuosi,\r\nof exciting the astonishment and admiration of his hearers by free\r\nfantasias and learned modulations. And although he had considerably less\r\npower on the harpsichord, yet he knew how to modulate in arpeggio with\r\nconsummate skill and in endless changes.”\r\n\r\n“Abel remained in London until 1782, in which year the desire of\r\nonce more seeing his brother and his country induced him to return\r\nto Germany. It was on this journey that he displayed, both at Berlin\r\nand Ludwigslust, the greatness of his talent, his wonderful power of\r\nexpression, the richness of his tones, and his stirring execution on the\r\ngamba. The present king, then Crown Prince of Prussia, before whom he\r\nperformed in Berlin, presented him with a costly casket and 100 louis\r\nd’or. A few years later he stayed some time in Paris on account of the\r\ndisordered condition of his finances. But he returned again to London\r\nand died there on June 22, 1787, after a three days’ lethargy, without\r\nthe least suffering. Shortly before his death he played a recently\r\nfinished solo which astonished his warmest admirers. His cadences\r\nespecially were excellent.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, amongst Abel’s numberless published works, which\r\nconsist partly of concertos and orchestral pieces and partly of chamber\r\nmusic, there are no compositions for the gamba. This must be explained\r\nby the fact that the zenith of gamba-playing had been reached, and the\r\nart was on its decline, at the beginning of the second half of the\r\neighteenth century. It went out of fashion, and with it also gamba\r\nmusic, and in its place only violoncello compositions were in request.\r\nIn many ways this change was as much lamented as was the case at the\r\nbanishment of the lute to cabinets of curiosities or the lumber room.\r\n\r\nAfter Abel there were no German gambists of conspicuous importance\r\nto mention. From the middle of the last century the gamba was more\r\nand more neglected, in consequence of the violoncello being brought\r\nforward, and the younger geniuses devoted themselves by preference to\r\nthis instrument, which approached more nearly to the violin, then at the\r\nsummit of all instrumental music.\r\n\r\nAmongst stringed instruments, which had shared the same fate as the\r\ngamba, belong the Viola bastarda and the Viola di Bordone (English,\r\nBarytone). The first instrument was in shape somewhat thicker than\r\nthe gamba and was provided with six or seven strings.[38] In order to\r\nincrease the resonance, as many steel strings were introduced under the\r\nfingerboard and bridge, which were tuned to the same pitch as those\r\nabove, like the Viola d’amore. Another variety of the gamba was the\r\nbarytone, which was cultivated in the last century.\r\n\r\nIn Leopold Mozart’s violin tutor is found the following description\r\nof it: “This instrument has from six to seven strings like the gamba.\r\nThe neck is very broad and the back part hollow and open, down which\r\nnine or ten brass or steel strings are run beneath, which are touched\r\nand pinched by the thumb; so that, at the same time as the principal\r\npart is played with the bow on the upper cat-gut strings, the thumb by\r\nstriking the strings stretched under the neck of the instrument can play\r\nthe bass; and therefore the music must be arranged specially for it.\r\nMoreover, it is a most agreeable instrument.” From this description it\r\nis evident that the barytone was a bass instrument resembling the Viola\r\nd’amore. The barytone in its time was much liked in Austria. Several\r\nAustrian composers, as Cybler, Weigl, and Pichl, and at their head\r\nJoseph Haydn, composed for this instrument. The latter was incited to\r\nit by his benefactor, the Prince Esterhazy, who looked with particular\r\nfavour on the barytone. Haydn wrote no less than 175 pieces for it.[39]\r\nThe tuning of the strings on the fingerboard of the barytone was on the\r\nsame principle as that of the gamba.\r\n\r\nThe Viennese, ANTON LIDL, who was born about 1740, was much esteemed\r\nas a most distinguished barytone virtuoso. Gerber says of him, “that\r\nhe rendered still more perfect his instrument, which had been invented\r\nabout the year 1700. It is in shape like the Viola da gamba, except\r\nthat it has brass strings at the back, which are played at the same\r\ntime with the thumb. These lower strings he increased to twenty-seven\r\nand the semitones were played with them.” He must have been an\r\nextraordinary artist on this instrument. The author of the _Almanack_\r\nof 1782 says: “His performance united the most charming sweetness to\r\nGerman vigour, the most surprising syncopations with the most harmonious\r\nmelody.” According to Burney, Lidl was no longer living in 1789. Up to\r\n1783 he had published, in Amsterdam and Paris, Duets, Quartets, and\r\nQuintets--altogether seven works. His compositions for the gamba were\r\nnot published.\r\n\r\nThe barytone disappeared with the gamba, in the course of the second\r\nhalf of the last century, from musical practice.\r\n\r\nThe same change took place in Italy about the same time or somewhat\r\nearlier, when a lively interest in the violoncello was aroused there\r\nby Franciscello, of whom we shall speak farther on. It appears,\r\nindeed, that in the land of the arts, as the quotations already given\r\nfrom Maugars’ papers inform us, no predilection had prevailed for the\r\nhigher study of the gamba, either for the reason that among stringed\r\ninstruments the cultivation of the violin--which from the seventeenth\r\ncentury had decidedly usurped the first place in the study of music--was\r\nchiefly pursued, or that the Italian composers did not specially concern\r\nthemselves with the gamba. As a matter of fact, so far as can be\r\nperceived, with the exception of Tartini, no noteworthy Italian composer\r\nconsidered it worth his while to bring it into the field of creative\r\nactivity. Besides Ferabosco, of whom mention has already been made,\r\nthere are amongst famous Italian bass violin players and gambists to be\r\nnamed: Allessandro Romano with the cognomen “della Viola,” and Teobaldi\r\nGatti. ROMANO was born about 1530 at Rome, and in 1560 was a singer in\r\nthe Papal (Sixtine) Chapel. He later became a monk of the monastery of\r\nMount Olivet, under the name of Giulio Cesare. But he did not find his\r\nsojourn there agreeable, for he was at strife and contention with one or\r\nother of the monks of his order through incompatibility of temper. His\r\ncompositions, published between the years 1572-1579, consist of “Canzone\r\nalla Napolitana” for five voices and a book of Motets in five parts.\r\n\r\nTEOBALDI GATTI, born at Florence about 1650, not only distinguished\r\nhimself as a gamba player, but also made himself known in his time as\r\nan operatic composer. In the latter respect he was influenced by Lully,\r\nwhose first opera-overtures so impressed him that he resolved to go to\r\nParis in order to do homage to his illustrious countryman. Lully, who\r\nwas flattered, showed his gratitude for this attention by making Gatti a\r\nmember of the Parisian Opera orchestra, which post he filled for nearly\r\nfifty years uninterruptedly.[40] He died in 1727, in Paris. There were\r\npublished in 1696 twelve “Airs Italiens” by him, two of which are duets.\r\n\r\nAs skilful Italian gambists are conspicuous also MARCO FRATICELLI and\r\nCARLO AMBROSIO LUNATI,[41] of Milan, with the cognomen “Il gobbo della\r\nRegina.” The latter came to England during the reign of James II.\r\nNothing further is known concerning either of these instrumentalists. It\r\nis worthy of remark in this place that the famous Italian singer, Lenora\r\nBaroni, born about 1610, was, according to Maugars’ testimony, a clever\r\ntheorbo and gamba player. As such she was in the habit of accompanying\r\nherself in singing.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the viola da gamba, which for\r\nnearly three hundred years (for the “Basso di viola,” or Gerle’s\r\n“great violin,” was, in fact, a gamba, although as yet of a somewhat\r\nprimitive form) had played an important part both as an orchestral and\r\nsolo instrument, was replaced by the violoncello in the course of the\r\neighteenth century. Subsequently when the violin as a leading instrument\r\nin melody usurped the place of the cornet (Zinken), and the discant\r\nviola (French par dessus de viole), it became necessary to provide an\r\nequivalent for the bass part of string quartets, as the tone of the\r\ngamba in _ensemble_ playing proved too weak and thin in proportion to\r\nthe violin.\r\n\r\nMattheson says of it, in his “Neu eröffneten Orchestre,” which appeared\r\nin 1713: “The plaintive Viola da gamba (Fr., Basse de Viole, properly\r\nso called) is a beautiful delicate instrument, and he who wishes to\r\nsignalise himself on it must not keep his hands long in his pockets....\r\nIts chief use in concerts is only for the strengthening of the basses,\r\nand some indeed pretend to execute a ‘Thorough Bass’ on it, of which, up\r\nto now, I have never seen a good attempt.”\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this last somewhat sarcastic remark of Mattheson\r\nis what Gerber states a hundred years later (Vol. I., p. 6, of his\r\n“New” Musicians’ Lexicon) concerning the gamba. He there says: “It is\r\nremarkable in the history of music that his (Abel’s) instrument was\r\nburied with him in the year 1787 in total oblivion: the indispensable\r\ngamba, without which for a hundred years neither church nor chamber\r\nmusic could be arranged, which in all public and private concerts had\r\nthe exclusive right to be heard before all other instruments from the\r\nbeginning to the end, and which therefore, like caskets, must not only\r\nbe exquisitely finished in every size, large and small, but was also\r\nordered, bought, and paid for adorned with the most costly artistic\r\ncarving--ivory, tortoiseshell, gold, and silver--then available. In the\r\ncourse of time there will be no vestige left in the whole of Europe of\r\nthis instrument, once so universal and admired; henceforth it will have\r\nto be sought for amongst the old woodcuts in Prätorius, or specimens\r\nof it, stringless and worm-eaten, in a royal music chamber. Another\r\nsad proof how greatly Apollo is overruled by the goddess Fashion. The\r\ntaste of our forefathers for these soft, modest, humming viola tones\r\nis also remarkable; they were a quiet, contented, peace-loving people!\r\nIn the present time the instruments for our musicians cannot be chosen\r\nsufficiently high and shrill.”[42] It is plain that although Gerber\r\nhimself played the cello, this instrument was also known to him, and he\r\nhad not only remarked the disproportion between the tone of the violins\r\nand those of the gambas in the orchestra with regard to strength,\r\nbut also the circumstance that, by the creative faculty of Haydn and\r\nMozart in the region of higher instrumental music, the gamba had become\r\nwholly superfluous. The superior qualities of the violoncello to the\r\ngamba as a solo instrument had escaped him, although the conspicuous\r\nsuccess of cello players in the second half of the last century could\r\nnot have remained unknown to him. It seems, therefore, as if Gerber had\r\na special predilection for the gamba--a taste which only a few of his\r\ncontemporaries shared with him.\r\n\r\nGerber’s[43] confident assertion that the French priest, Tardieu, of\r\nTarascon, had invented the violoncello “in the year 1708,” is simply\r\nto be relegated to the region of fable, for the instrument had already\r\nexisted long before in Italy.[44]\r\n\r\nFétis remarks (p. 47) in his article “Antoine Stradivari” (Paris, 1856):\r\nThe violoncello had already been mentioned by Prätorius in his “Syntagma\r\nMus.” (1614-1620), which is a mistake, for the work referred to contains\r\nneither the name nor the illustration of this instrument.[45] But the\r\nvioloncello must already have been in use about this time in Italy,\r\nfor (according to Rob. Eitner)[46] it is mentioned in a publication\r\nof the year 1641, and then in a work of Freschi’s, which appeared in\r\n1660 as “Violoncino.” In Arresti’s Sonatas in two and three parts, of\r\nthe year 1665, it is called “Violoncello.” It was of great importance\r\nfor the Italian instrument makers to produce a bass instrument of\r\nthe violin type which had already been in use from the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century, and this certainly happened towards the end of that\r\nperiod. This is proved by the Brescian Gaspard da Salò[47] (1550-1612).\r\nWhether Andreas Amati, the founder of the famous Cremona school (born\r\n1520, died 1580), constructed similar instruments appears doubtful.\r\nApparently the gamba as well as the violin served as guides for the\r\nproportions in the construction of the violoncello. From the violin were\r\nborrowed the outlines of the soundbox, the arched back, which the more\r\nancient gambas, whose backs were flat, did not have; also the F holes\r\nand the fingerboard without frets. From the gamba were taken the large\r\nproportions of the violoncello. It was at first constructed like the\r\ngamba, in smaller and larger dimensions, until Stradivarius established\r\na standard size. Whether the most famous German violin maker, Jacob\r\nStainer (born 1621, died 1683), made violoncellos is much doubted by\r\nexperts. It is, however, certain that he made gambas, which were often\r\nconverted into violoncellos.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eitner’s previously mentioned assertion, it appears that\r\nthe last-named instrument was at first called “Violoncino,” and a\r\nlittle while after “Violoncello.” The Italian affixes “ino” and “ello”\r\nhave a diminutive meaning, and therefore both names have an identical\r\nsignification. As violino is the diminutive of viola, violoncino and\r\nvioloncello are the diminutives of “violone.” The tenor of our day,\r\nwhich also at that time sprang from the alto or tenor viola, after the\r\npattern of the violin, received the name of Viola da braccio, which\r\nmeans “arm viola.” Besides the Viola da braccio there was also a “Viola\r\nda Spalla,” which was not placed beneath the chin, but rested on the\r\nleft shoulder. Concerning this bass instrument Mattheson remarks: “The\r\nViola da spalla, or shoulder-viola, has a particularly grand effect in\r\naccompaniment from its penetrating and pure tone. A bass can never be\r\nmore distinctly and clearly brought out than by this instrument. It is\r\nfastened by a ribbon to the chest and thrown over the right shoulder,\r\nbut has nothing which can stop or prevent in the smallest degree its\r\nresonance.”\r\n\r\nTo return to the violoncello. It offered the player two very important\r\nadvantages over the gamba. First, the finger technique was wholly\r\nunlimited because the fingerboard had no frets, which, in regard to runs\r\nand cadences, as well as change of positions, opposed a substantial\r\nhindrance to the gamba player. Then the player on the violoncello could\r\nobtain more tone than on the gamba, by drawing the bow more forcibly\r\nover a single string. The upper edge of the bridge of the gamba,\r\nover which the strings passed, was so flatly cut for harmonised or\r\npart-playing that it was necessary to avoid a strong tone, lest the\r\nneighbouring strings should be thereby sympathetically affected. But\r\nthe bridge of the cello, on the contrary, was of a more convex form,\r\nwhereby playing in parts was indeed precluded. As is known, on the cello\r\nas on the violin, only double stops and chords are possible, and the\r\nlast only broken up. In this manner the violoncello was used formerly\r\nat the performances of operas and oratorios as solo accompaniment of\r\nrecitatives, for which of course it was requisite that the player should\r\nhave a thorough knowledge of music theoretically, as he had to execute\r\nat sight figured basses.\r\n\r\nCorrette gives already in his violoncello tutor (1741) instructions for\r\naccompanying recitative. These directions are, however, by no means\r\nexhaustive; such are first found in the cello tutor compiled for the\r\nParis Conservatoire by De Baillot, Levasseur, Catel, and Baudiot, which\r\nappeared in print in 1804. Therein it is said:\r\n\r\n“In order to accompany well a recitative, a complete knowledge of\r\nharmony and of the violoncello is necessary; one must be intimate with\r\nfigured basses, and know how to execute them readily. He who can do\r\nthis has reached the summit of art; for it presupposes a great deal of\r\nnecessary information, and still more the power of judging how to turn\r\nit to account.\r\n\r\n“If the bass player is not certain of the resolutions of discords, if\r\nhe is unable positively to indicate to the singer when he is to make a\r\ncomplete or a broken cadence, if in his concords he does not know how\r\nto avoid forbidden fifths and octaves--he is in danger of confusing the\r\nsinger, and in any case he will produce a most disagreeable effect.\r\n\r\n“As in good compositions, a recitative always follows a well-defined\r\nprogression and adapts itself to the character of the part, to\r\nthe situation portrayed, and to the voice of the singer: in the\r\naccompaniment--1. The strength of the tone must be regulated according\r\nto the effect to be produced, for the accompaniment must sustain and\r\nembellish the singing and not spoil and drown it. 2. The chord must not\r\nbe repeated, except when the harmony changes. 3. The accompaniment must\r\nbe quite simple, without flourishes or runs. Good accompanying always\r\nhas in view the best rendering of the subject, and when the player\r\nallows himself to fill up certain gaps with a short interlude, this must\r\nonly consist of the notes of the chord. 4. The chord must be played\r\nwithout Arpeggio, ordinarily in the following manner”--[48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBaudiot in his violoncello tutor, which appeared later than the above,\r\nmakes the following remark concerning the accompaniment of recitative:\r\n“It sometimes happens that the actors linger on the scene without\r\nreciting (speaking), be it that they have forgotten the text of what\r\nthey have to recite, or that for some other reason they are silent.\r\nAt times their appearance on the boards is delayed. In such cases,\r\nthe accompanist (_i.e._, the cellist) can perform short preludes and\r\nembellishments at his pleasure. But he must be modest about it, and\r\nemploy his ornaments at the right moment, and always with taste.”[49]\r\n\r\nTo the art of violoncello making the same applies as to the violin. The\r\nproductions of the Italian makers surpass those of all other nations.\r\nAmongst them, those manufactured by Nicholas Amati, Stradivari, and\r\nGius. Guarneri del Gesù are most to be preferred and justly so.[50]\r\n\r\nStradivari and Amati made their cellos of two different sizes; the\r\nlarger one was formerly called “il Basso,” while the smaller was\r\ndistinguished as the Violoncello proper. The latter is the more\r\npreferable as being more manageable; in these days it is used as a\r\nvaluable model.\r\n\r\nAs to the violoncello bow, which had the following form in the first\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century,[51] its progress went hand in hand with\r\nthat of the violin bow. The improvements which were successively made on\r\nthe latter were effected on the former. The greatest perfection reached\r\nby the bow was the work of a Frenchman, François Tourte. To this day he\r\nhas never been excelled in this department. (See Appendix A.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fabrication, however, of good violin and cello bows has latterly\r\nbecome very general; and especially in Markneukirchen the manufacture of\r\nbows as well as instruments has received a great impulse.[52]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the name “Geige” violin,\r\nthen in ordinary use, must not be confounded with the violin of our\r\ntime. This term was not applied to the more modern instrument until\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[2] A more detailed account of the above stringed instruments and their\r\nprecursors is contained in my work, “The Violin and its Masters,” Second\r\nEdition (Leipsic: Breitkopf and Härtel), and “History of Instrumental\r\nMusic in the Sixteenth Century” (Berlin: Brachvogel and Ranft),\r\ntherefore a repetition of what is there said is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[3] The “big fiddle” of the sixteenth century must not be confounded\r\nwith the stringed instrument of that time, of which the pitch answered\r\nto our modern Contra-basso, and in Italy was already called “Violone,”\r\nas appears from Laufranco’s “Scintille,” 1533.\r\n\r\n[4] The word “beschriben” refers to the letters which, for the\r\nconvenience of the player, it was the custom to mark for the fingers on\r\nthe fingerboard.\r\n\r\n[5] The artist who drew the sketches of the instrument for Gerle’s\r\n“Musica Teutsch” has left out the bridge in the “great viola.” See page\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[6] See the article “Kerl.”\r\n\r\n[7] Also at the present time it is a family name. We need only mention\r\nG. H. Bruno Kerl, Professor of the Royal Berg Academy at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[8] Other authorities, however, say he was a Breton--Fétis, Casimir\r\nColomb &c.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[9] The name Duiffopruggar doubtless came from the same source as the\r\nsurname Tieffenbrucker, still existing in South Germany.\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. Heron Allen in his “Violin Making, &c.,” page 74, says that two\r\nwere recovered.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[11] The same Prince to whom Corelli dedicated his “Concerti Grossi,”\r\npublished in 1712.\r\n\r\n[12] Herr Obernetter, of Munich, has taken two beautiful photographs of\r\nthis richly decorated instrument, which reproduce with great accuracy\r\nall its peculiarities. As far as I know they can still be purchased.\r\n\r\n[13] Here may be mentioned also a third magnificent gamba, that of\r\nVincenzo Ruger, said to have been made in Cremona in 1702. It is\r\ndistinguished not only for its beautiful exterior in every respect, but\r\nalso by an extraordinarily sonorous and unusually fine quality of tone,\r\nwhich combines the resonant character of the gamba with that of the\r\nvioloncello. The latter circumstance is attributed to the fact that the\r\nback, which is usually flat in the ordinary gamba, is arched in this\r\none. This instrument, which has been lately purchased by the Prussian\r\nGovernment for the Berlin Museum, was formerly in the possession of Herr\r\nPaul de Wit, in Leipsic. The account of instrument making published by\r\nhim contains (Vol. VI., No. 21) a description and illustration of the\r\ngamba in question.\r\n\r\n[14] Violuntzes is synonymous with the old French instrument, violonsse.\r\n_Vide_ Grimm’s Dictionary of the German Language.\r\n\r\n[15] The Kammerthon or chamber-pitch, as distinguished from the obsolete\r\n“Chorton” or choir-pitch, which formerly prevailed in German churches,\r\nwas a tone, or even more, higher than the secular pitch.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[16] “Faburden,” according to Mr. Niecks.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[17] Concerning this, see my “History of Instrumental Music” in the\r\n_Century_, page 107.\r\n\r\n[18] By the word concert, Mersennus means concerted piece.\r\n\r\n[19] Maugars is called in the “Historiettes de Tellemant des Réaux,”\r\nas Fétis informs us, the “greatest fool that had ever lived.” His\r\n“Réponse faite à un curieux” (completely unprejudiced, although somewhat\r\nconceited) in no way agrees with this. It is easy to discover that\r\nMaugars was not liked by his countrymen, because he openly declared that\r\nFrench music was far behind the Italian. On that account he had incurred\r\nthe displeasure of French artists. The Parisian musician, Corrette, in\r\nthe eighteenth century, was guilty of the same offence. He had been\r\ncandid enough to say to the French that the standard of French violin\r\nplaying of the eighteenth century was, compared to the Italian, in a\r\ndisorganised condition. In retaliation they called his pupils scornfully\r\n“les anachorètes” (“les ânes à Corette”).\r\n\r\n[20] I give this and the following quotations from Maugars’ writings,\r\naccording to my translations in the monthly parts of the “History of\r\nMusic,” published in the year 1878.\r\n\r\n[21] The English writers on music affirm that the well-known composer,\r\nFerabosco, who was born at Greenwich in the second half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and who was also called Alfonso, was the son of the above\r\nFerabosco, with which the remarks of Maugars agree. Fétis doubts the\r\ntruth of the assertion made by the English writers on music. The younger\r\nFerabosco appears also to have been a gamba player, for he published, in\r\nthe year 1609, in London, “Lessons for one, two, and three viols.” He\r\ndied in 1665.\r\n\r\n[22] See my work “The Violin and its Masters,” Part ii., p. 203.\r\n\r\n[23] His name was usually written Sympson, but he sometimes himself\r\nspelled it Simpson.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[24] This seems to have been the title of the first edition, a copy of\r\nwhich is in the possession of Messrs. Hill, of New Bond Street.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[25] This work contains, besides the viola tutor, an introduction to\r\nviolin playing. It is the first attempt at a violin school.\r\n\r\n[26] Thomas Campion was a physician, poet, and musician in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and an authority on music. He published two books of\r\nAyres, and various other pieces, besides the above.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[27] He has already been mentioned, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[28] Michael Corrette ascribes this to Sainte-Colombe in his violoncello\r\nschool, which appeared in 1741, concerning which we shall speak farther\r\non.\r\n\r\n[29] Concerning this instrument, Mattheson says: “The Angelique,\r\nsomewhat resembling the lute, must have been far easier to play, and\r\nhas more cords or strings, which one can accurately touch by reason of\r\ntheir arrangement without moving the left hand much. There is nothing\r\nspecially besides to remember.” It was, therefore, an instrument of the\r\nlute kind.\r\n\r\n[30] He was perhaps a brother or relation of the instrument maker Tielke\r\nmentioned pp. 7 and 8 of this work.\r\n\r\n[31] Compare p. 8.\r\n\r\n[32]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation that this second fugue (D minor) has the\r\ntheme which Mozart, nearly 100 years later, made use of for the second\r\n_Finale_ of the “Magic Flute.” There is no doubt this was purely\r\naccidental, as Mozart could hardly have seen Schenk’s work.\r\n\r\n[33] A MS. copy exists in the Royal Library at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[34] The MS. is preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[35] It is to be found in the autograph collection of Count Wimpfen at\r\nhis estate near Gratz.\r\n\r\n[36] According to Fürstenau, Abel was engaged as violoncellist at\r\nDresden. See his “History of Music and of the Theatre at the Elector of\r\nSaxony’s Court,” Vol. II., p. 240.\r\n\r\n[37] Sebastian Bach’s youngest son, Joh. Christian, was born in 1735, in\r\nLeipsic, and died in London in 1782, whither he had gone in 1759 as Band\r\nConductor.\r\n\r\n[38] According to Pohl, the number of these metal strings was raised to\r\ntwenty-seven. (S. C. F. Pohl: “Haydn,” I., 250.) Information regarding\r\nthe barytone and barytone compositions are to be found there.\r\n\r\n[39] Pohl: “Haydn,” I., 257.\r\n\r\n[40] Gerber mentions him as a violoncellist, which must be a mistake,\r\nsince in the Parisian Opera orchestra, up to 1727, as far as is\r\nknown, only gambists were employed. He may, however, have played both\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n[41] See “The History of the Violin,” by W. Sandys and Simon Andrew\r\nForster. London, 1864.\r\n\r\n[42] What would Gerber have said had he lived to see the present demand\r\nfor instruments required to make up an orchestra?\r\n\r\n[43] Gerber’s “Old Musical Lexicon,” p. 617, and Note, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[44] In the preface to the violoncello tutor already mentioned, by\r\nCorrette, the untenable assertion is made that the violoncello was\r\ndiscovered by Bonocin (Buononcini), “preséntement Maître de Chapelle\r\ndu Roi de Portugal.” A Bononcini, with the Christian name of Domenico,\r\nactually lived in 1737 at the Lisbon Court. At that period, according to\r\nFétis, he must have been eighty-five years old. He must therefore have\r\nbeen born in 1652. He could not have invented the violoncello (if one\r\ncould call it an invention), as it evidently existed before his birth.\r\nIt is not even certain that Domenico Bononcini was a cellist. Possibly\r\nCorrette confounded him with Giov. Battista Bononcini mentioned later.\r\n\r\n[45] Another inaccuracy in Fétis’s “Stradivari,” p. 46, is that the name\r\nof violino “had already appeared in Lanfranco’s work ‘Scintille’ of\r\n1533.” This announcement has caused some confusion. Before Lanfranco’s\r\nwork was accessible to me, I also in _bonâ fide_ had made the same\r\nassertion in my “History of Instrumental Music of the Sixteenth Century”\r\n(p. 73), and I now correct it. The word “Violino” is not mentioned by\r\nLanfranco, but in every case only the termination “Violone,” which is\r\nbass viol.\r\n\r\n[46] See monthly _Magazine for the History of Music_, Year XVI., No. 3.\r\n\r\n[47] The well-known violin maker, Aug. Riechers, in Berlin, possesses a\r\nvioloncello by Gaspard da Salò (small size).\r\n\r\n[48] The French call this kind of recitative accompaniment “le recitatif\r\nitalien.”\r\n\r\n[49] Accompanying the recitative with the cello was customary far into\r\nour century. I heard it in Italy at the representation of the old operas\r\nup to the year 1873. I am unable to say if the practice is continued. It\r\nhas been abolished in Germany for the last ten years.\r\n\r\n[50] The widespread opinion that Gius. Guarneri of the Gesù did not make\r\nvioloncellos is unfounded. Aug. Riecher informs me that Major H----r, in\r\nBerlin, is in possession of a cello which is undoubtedly genuine. Yet it\r\nseems as if this member of the Guarneri family had only made a limited\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n[51] The above sketch is taken from Corrette’s Violoncello Tutor, which\r\nwas published in 1741.\r\n\r\n[52] In my paper “The Violin and its Masters,” second edition (Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel), I have given a more detailed account of it as well as of\r\nthe productions of the Italian, German, and French masters, which it\r\nis unnecessary to repeat here. See also the fabrication of musical\r\ninstruments in Saxon Voigtland, by Fürstenau and Berthold, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE\r\n    ART OF VIOLONCELLO PLAYING\r\n    IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVioloncello.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the violoncello still occupied a very\r\nsubordinate and modest position; during the period mentioned, with\r\nvery few exceptions, it was employed only as a bass instrument in the\r\norchestra. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, there\r\nwas already a great change; for Mattheson says in his “Neu eröffneten\r\nOrchestre,” which appeared in 1713:--\r\n\r\n“The PROMINENT Violoncello, the Bass Viol, and the Viola da Spalla are\r\nsmall bass fiddles (viols) similar to the larger ones, with five or six\r\nstrings, on which can be played all kinds of quick things, variations\r\nand movements much more easily than on the larger machines” (Mattheson\r\nmeans the contra-basso).[53]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, quite conceivable that some time was necessary, before\r\nthe players, who were unaccustomed to the undivided fingerboard of the\r\ncello, were sufficiently confident of a finger technique differing\r\nso completely from that of the gamba. They were at first limited to\r\nthe lower part of the fingerboard, as was the case primarily with the\r\nviolin.[54] The position of the thumb, by means of which the higher and\r\nhighest positions on the fingerboard could alone be fixed and maintained\r\nwith certainty, could hardly have been known before the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century. The violoncello at this time, as appears from\r\nMattheson’s account just mentioned, had sometimes a set of five or even\r\nsix strings like the gamba. On the five-stringed instruments the tuning\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Tardieu already referred to, who played the violoncello,\r\naccording to Gerber, had the same tuning on his instrument. About\r\nthe third decade of the last century, those who used five-stringed\r\ninstruments gave up the highest string--(the D). From that time the\r\nfour-stringed instrument with the tuning C, G, D, A came very generally\r\ninto use. The latter was not altogether a novelty. Prätorius mentions it\r\nin his “Syntagma Mus.” as the “Bass Viol de Braccio.”[55]\r\n\r\nIn Germany the use of the violoncello as an orchestral instrument\r\nensued later than in Italy, though much sooner than in France. For\r\nalthough it had been introduced into the Parisian Opera in 1727, by the\r\ncellist Batistin, to be mentioned later on, it had been already in use\r\nsince 1680 in the Vienna Hofkapelle. The Saxon Hofkapelle at Dresden\r\nnext followed by the installation of four violoncellists. Their names\r\nare Daniel Hennig, Agostino Antonio de Rossi, Jean Baptiste José du\r\nHoubondel, and Jean Prach de Tilloy.[56] As two of these players have\r\nFrench names, it is to be assumed that the violoncello had already found\r\nrepresentatives in France at the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe example set by Vienna and Dresden was soon imitated also by other\r\nGerman Courts. The band of Duke Charles Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp\r\naffords a case in point. As this prince, the future son-in-law of Peter\r\nthe Great, found himself obliged, in 1720, to reside at the Russian\r\nImperial Court, his private musicians followed him thither, amongst whom\r\nthere was a cellist.[57]\r\n\r\nAs the gamba enjoyed a great amount of favour[58] in Germany, the\r\nintroduction of the violoncello was not effected without difficulty,\r\nto which indeed the gambists, who thought their pretended rights were\r\nthereby infringed, not a little contributed. For in a paper which\r\nappeared in 1757 in the French language, “Observations sur la Musique,”\r\n&c., it is said: “La seule basse de viole a déclaré la guerre au\r\nvioloncelle qui a remporté la victoire et elle a été si complète que\r\nl’on craint maintenant que la fameuse viole, l’incomparable sicilienne\r\nne soit vendue à quelque inventaire à un prix médiocre et que quelque\r\nluthier profane ne s’avise d’en faire une enseigne.”[59]\r\n\r\nIt was not quite so bad as the last words of the announcement lead\r\none to suppose. Even if the violoncello caused the gamba to be quite\r\nsuperfluous in the orchestra, the latter was cultivated as a solo\r\ninstrument for some time longer, and many of the good old gambas were in\r\ncourse of time metamorphosed into violoncellos, and made available for\r\nfurther use; while the more insignificant specimens were destroyed, if\r\nthey were not required for completing instrumental collections and so\r\npreserved from destruction.\r\n\r\nThe art of violoncello playing in the first stages of its development\r\nwas, as regards the method of treatment, not so much favoured as violin\r\nplaying. To the latter a definite direction for imitation was early\r\ngiven, as soon indeed as the end of the seventeenth century, by the\r\nRoman school founded by Arcangelo Corelli, which was soon followed\r\nby the foundation of the Paduan and Piedmontese schools. Violoncello\r\nplaying lacked such classical parent schools. When a few prominent\r\nartists of this instrument had brought it into greater consideration,\r\ncentres were formed by distinguished masters for the study of the cello,\r\nwhich supplied the want of proper schools, about which we shall have\r\nmore to say farther on.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how it followed that the violoncello was first\r\nvalued in the land of its birth--that is, in Italy, not only as an\r\norchestral instrument but also for solo playing. How this important\r\nbranch of art was there developed we shall see in the next section.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] Mattheson expresses himself about this in his original manner as\r\nfollows: “The growling Violone (French, Basse de Violon; German, Grosse\r\nBass Geige) is quite twice the size of the former, sometimes even more,\r\nconsequently the strings, in thickness and length, are in proportion.\r\nThey are of sixteen-feet tone, and most useful on the stage as a solid\r\nfoundation for polyphonous pieces, such as choruses and similar things,\r\nas well as for airs and recitatives; its deep humming tone penetrates\r\nfarther than the clavier and other bass instruments. It must, however,\r\nbe heavy work if one has to practise this monster for three or four\r\nhours unceasingly.”\r\n\r\n[54] Concerning this, I refer to my work “The Violin and its Masters,”\r\nsecond edition, 1883. (Breitkopf and Härtel, Leipsic.)\r\n\r\n[55] Michael Corrette in the preface to his Violoncello Tutor refers\r\nto a stringed instrument in general use before the introduction of the\r\nvioloncello into France with the tuning B, F, C, G, which he calls Basse\r\nde Violon. The instrument must be identical with the one described by\r\nMattheson as Basse de Violon.\r\n\r\n[56] Fürstenau: “On the History of Music and the Theatre at the Court of\r\nthe Princes of Saxony.”\r\n\r\n[57] Hiller, _Weekly News_ of May 21, 1770.\r\n\r\n[58] Mattheson says, in his “Neu eröffneten Orchestre,” that this\r\ninstrument (Basse de Viole) was singularly prized and cultivated.\r\n\r\n[59] H. Leblanc published a “Défense de la Basse de Viole contre les\r\nentreprises du Violon et les prétentions du Violoncel.” Amsterdam,\r\n1740.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly has the claim of priority in violoncello as well as violin\r\nplaying. It was the birthplace of the violin and of the cello, and from\r\nthence emanated the artistic executive development of both instruments.\r\nThe first famous Italian cellist of whom we have any notice is--\r\n\r\nDOMENICO GABRIELI, with the surname of MENGHINO DEL VIOLONCELLO, born\r\nabout 1640 at Bologna, died in 1690. This artist found a sphere of\r\nwork in the church of San Petronio in his native town. Then he entered\r\nthe service of Cardinal Pamfili in Rome. Gabrieli was also a composer\r\nof some repute. Fétis mentions eight of his operas which were written\r\npartly for Bologna and partly for Venice. His other works consist of a\r\n“Cantata a voce sola,” in a collection of Motets, entitled “Vexillum\r\npacis,” for alto solo and instrumental accompaniments, as well as\r\n“Baletti, gighe, correnti, e sarabande a due violini e violoncello,\r\ncon basso continuo” (Op. 1). These three works, of which the last is a\r\nreprint, appeared successively in 1691, 1695, and 1703, consequently\r\nafter Gabrieli’s death. He appears to have composed nothing specially\r\nfor the cello.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable as a cellist must have been ATTILIO ARIOSTI, the\r\nDominican monk, born at Bologna in 1660. Gerber at least says of him\r\nthat he was one of the most excellent violoncellists of his time.\r\nBut he was also a distinguished performer on the Viola d’amore. He\r\noccupied himself chiefly, however, with opera compositions, for which\r\nthe Pope granted him a dispensation from the rule of his order, as\r\nwithout it, being a Dominican, he was forbidden to meddle with anything\r\nconnected with the theatre. In 1698 Ariosti was sent for to Berlin as\r\nKapellmeister to the Elector of Brandenberg. Thence he went in 1716\r\nto London, where, in the proximity of Handel, he could make no way,\r\nand therefore at last returned to his fatherland. He chose Bologna as\r\nhis place of residence. Like Gabrieli, he appears to have produced no\r\nindependent[60] violoncello compositions.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-country man, GIOVANNI BATTISTA BONONCINI (Buononcini),[61]\r\nfamous as an able cellist, also devoted his talent by preference to the\r\noperatic stage. He was the eldest son of the choirmaster, Giov. Maria\r\nBononcini, at the church S. Giovanni, in Monte, at Modena, and was born\r\nin 1672, or, according to Fétis, in 1667 or 1668. At first instructed in\r\nmusic by his father, and then perfected by Colonna at Bologna, he betook\r\nhimself, at twenty-two or twenty-three years of age, to Vienna, where\r\nhe found a post as cellist in the Imperial Kapelle. Here he turned to\r\nopera, which at that time was a favourite means of entertainment for the\r\nseeing and listening public, and promised more reputation and gain than\r\nall other kinds of composition.\r\n\r\nFétis mentions twenty operas by Bononcini, but he doubtless wrote more.\r\nEven in his eightieth year he was occupied for the theatre in Venice.\r\nBesides, he wrote an Oratorio, “Joshua,” several orchestral pieces,\r\nmasses, chamber duets, “Trattenimenti da Camera,” &c., some of which\r\nwere composed before his entrance into the Vienna Hofkapelle. He also\r\nwrote “Sinfonie” for violin and violoncello as well as cello solos. Of\r\nthe latter there appeared at J. Simpson’s (London) a sonata for two\r\nvioloncellos in a collection of sonatas by Pasqualini, San Martino,\r\nCaporale, Spourni, and Porta. As Caporale was born in 1750 and Porta\r\nin 1758, the publication of this collection must have taken place late\r\nin the second half of the eighteenth century. The Bononcini sonata\r\ncontained in it does not give a very favourable impression of this\r\ncomposer’s talent. The development is dry and in places very formal,\r\neven here and there somewhat incorrect. To the two figured parts are\r\ngiven accompanying basses, partly simple and partly contrapuntal. The\r\ninterest which attaches to this composition, consisting of an _Allegro_,\r\nwith introductory _Andante_, a movement marked “_Grazioso_,” and a\r\n“_Minuet_,” after which the “_Grazioso_” is to be repeated, rests\r\nchiefly on the light which it throws upon the technical condition of\r\ncello playing at the beginning of the eighteenth century (for doubtless\r\nthe composition belongs to that period). In reference to this is to be\r\nremarked: the principal part is confined chiefly to the middle tones;\r\nthe lower ones are only occasionally touched, and the compass of the\r\nhigher notes reaches to the one-lined A; the thumb position does not\r\ncome into use. Figure is little developed, and only modest attempts are\r\nmade at playing double stoppings and chords; the notation is in tenor\r\nand bass clefs.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that during Bononcini’s residence in Paris, between\r\n1735-1748, he composed a Motet with cello obbligato accompaniment, for\r\nthe royal band there, which last he himself played at the performance of\r\nhis work in the presence of the king.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti,[62] the founder of the Neapolitan opera school,\r\nhad given an example of this use of the violoncello about twenty-five\r\nyears before in one of his cantatas. Geminiani, Corelli’s pupil, related\r\nthat this cello part was performed during Scarlatti’s presence in Rome,\r\nand with his assistance on the clavier, by the famous violoncellist,\r\nFranciscello (Francischello); his playing was so beautiful that\r\nScarlatti described it as heavenly.\r\n\r\nThis event must have occurred in the year 1713, when Scarlatti was in\r\nRome the last time. Consequently, Franciscello’s birth must be placed\r\nwith all probability in the year 1692. He would have been twenty-one\r\nyears of age when he played with the Neapolitan master.\r\n\r\nGerber says that Franciscello went from Rome to Naples in 1725. That\r\nhe was actually there in the year mentioned is affirmed by Quantz,\r\nwho himself heard him play. Through Franciscello’s extraordinary\r\nperformances the violoncello was soon so generally accepted in Italy,\r\nthat the gamba had, in 1730, almost entirely disappeared from the\r\nItalian orchestras.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1730, Franciscello was summoned to Vienna as Imperial\r\nchamber musician, a proof that his name had already penetrated beyond\r\nhis country. Franz Benda, afterwards celebrated as a violinist, and\r\nfounder of the Berlin violin school, heard him in the Austrian capital.\r\nFranciscello’s manner of playing so impressed him that he took him from\r\nthat time as his model.\r\n\r\nFranciscello remained, it appears, ten years in Vienna. If a notice in\r\nthe “Musical Almanack for Germany, of the year 1782,” is to be credited,\r\nhe had already been a member of the Imperial Court and Chamber Music\r\nSociety in 1766, which is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility,\r\nthough not very probable. We hold then to the assumption that he was\r\nborn in 1692 so that, in 1766, he would be already seventy-four years\r\nold. It is not known where Franciscello closed his life. Tradition\r\nonly says that at an advanced age he resided in Genoa, to which the\r\nsupposition was attached that that city had been his birthplace. It is\r\nstated that the elder Duport, the cello virtuoso, who was born in 1741,\r\nwent from Paris to visit him there.\r\n\r\nDuring his long period of work at Vienna, Franciscello doubtless\r\ninstructed pupils in cello playing; who they were is however, as little\r\nknown as the question if or what he composed for his instrument. On both\r\npoints we are no better off than concerning his somewhat older\r\ncompatriot\r\n\r\nCERVETTO, called JACOPO BASSEVI, who was born in 1682. Until his\r\nforty-sixth year he remained in his fatherland. Then, like so many\r\nother Italian musicians of this time, he was seized with a desire to\r\ntravel, and betook himself to London. There he trafficked at first in\r\ninstruments which he had brought with him from Italy; this, however,\r\nwas so little remunerative that he very soon gave it up, and joined\r\nthe orchestra of Drury Lane Theatre. According to Burney’s judgment,\r\nCervetto was, for his time, a very clever violoncellist, who knew how\r\nto manipulate the fingerboard with much dexterity; but his tone must\r\nhave been rough and harsh. Of his eccentricity the following anecdote\r\nis an illustration: Once when the famous Garrick was representing a\r\ndrunkard and sank down senseless upon a seat, Cervetto broke upon the\r\nsudden stillness with an unseemly loud and long-drawn yawn. Garrick\r\nimmediately got up, severely censuring such behaviour, upon which\r\nCervetto pacifying him answered: “I beg your pardon, I always yawn when\r\nI am very pleased.” A few years later Cervetto became Director of Drury\r\nLane Theatre, and thus he laid the foundation of his fortune.\r\n\r\nCervetto must have had a very strong constitution, for he lived to the\r\nunusual age of 101 years. His death took place on January 14, 1783.\r\nHe left a fortune of £20,000 sterling, which he bequeathed to his son\r\nJames, who was also a cellist; but soon after inheriting from his father\r\nhe retired into private life. He, also, reached a respectable age, for\r\nas he came into the world (in London) in 1747, and died February 5,\r\n1837, he was ninety years old. In 1783 he was performing at the Court\r\nconcerts of the Queen, as well as taking part in the musical _réunions_\r\nin the house of Lord Abington as one of the best reputed cellists in\r\nLondon. Of cello compositions he published: 1. Twelve “Solos for a\r\nVioloncello, with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord”; this work,\r\ndedicated to the Elector Palatine of Bavaria and Jülich-Eleve-Berg,\r\nappeared at the author’s own expense, without date. 2. “Six Solos for\r\na Violoncello, with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord, Opera Terza.”\r\nLondon. 3. “Twelve Sonatinas for a Violoncello and a Bass, Op. 4^{ta}.”\r\nLondon. Fétis adds, besides, “Six solos pour la flûte” and “Six trios\r\npour deux violons, et violoncelle,” which must have been in existence\r\nnot long before the end of the last century. We shall have occasion to\r\nrefer again farther on to Cervetto’s violoncello compositions.\r\n\r\nTaking up again the chronological thread, after Cervetto the elder,\r\nthe cellist Batistin, whose real name was JOH. BAPTIST STRUCK, must\r\nbe mentioned. He was of German origin and was born in Florence in\r\nthe second half of the seventeenth century, from thence he went to\r\nParis at the beginning of the eighteenth century. He there entered\r\nthe band of the Duke of Orleans and the opera orchestra, in which he,\r\nconjointly with the brothers Abbé (properly Philippe Pierre and Pierre\r\nde Saint-Sévin), played the cello parts. He must have performed well,\r\nsince Louis XIV., in order to retain him in the French capital, gave him\r\na liberal allowance and, in addition, a sum of 500 francs for certain\r\ntheatrical compositions to be supplied by him. Besides this he wrote a\r\nlong list of ballets and operas specially for Court festivities. There\r\nappeared in print, by him, during the years 1706 and 1714, in Paris,\r\nfour books of “Cantatas” and a collection of airs. He does not appear to\r\nhave composed for the violoncello. He died on December 9, 1755, at the\r\nscene of his work. Among the masters of the Neapolitan school, LEONARDO\r\nLEO, at that time the famous opera composer, distinguished himself\r\nas a violoncellist, who was born, 1694, at S. Vito degli Schiavi, in\r\nthe province of Lecco, and died at Naples in 1746. He also composed\r\nsix cello concertos with quartet accompaniments, which belong to the\r\nyears 1737 and 1738. The MSS. of these are in the Library of the Royal\r\nConservatoire at Naples. It is supposed that these are the oldest of\r\nexisting cello concertos.\r\n\r\nAnother Italian cellist of that time was DOMENICO DELLA BELLA, of whom\r\nnothing further is known than that, in 1704, he published, in Venice,\r\nTwelve Sonatas “a due violini e violoncello.”\r\n\r\nThe information is equally meagre regarding the cellist PARASISI, of\r\nwhom Gerber says he was an extraordinary artist on his instrument and\r\nwas with the Italian Opera orchestra at Breslau in 1727.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Italian violoncellists JACCHINI, AMADIO, VANDINI, ABACO,\r\nDALL’OGLIO, and LANZETTI, born in the second half of the seventeenth and\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century, we know very little.\r\n\r\nJACCHINI, whose Christian name was Giuseppe, noted by Gerber as one\r\nof the first cellists of his time, was appointed to the church of S.\r\nPetronio in Bologna at the beginning of the eighteenth century. That he\r\nhad distinguished himself as an artist is proved by his nomination as\r\na member of the Bologna Philharmonic Society, a distinction which is\r\nonly conferred on men of great musical reputation. Of his compositions\r\nthere is a work entitled “Concerti per Camera a 3 e 4 stromenti, con\r\nvioloncello obligato (Op. 4). Bologna, 1701,” to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nPIPPO AMADIO, who flourished about the year 1720, was, according to\r\nGerber’s account, a violoncellist, “whose art surpassed all, that up to\r\nhis time had been produced on his instrument.”\r\n\r\nANTONIO VANDINI, first violoncellist at the church of S. Antonio,\r\nPadua, seems to have been no less remarkable. The Italians called his\r\nmanner of playing and his expression “parlare”--he understood how to\r\nmake his instrument speak. He was on terms of such close friendship with\r\nTartini, who as is known was engaged at the same church at Padua as solo\r\nviolinist, that he accompanied him in 1723 to Prague, and remained with\r\nhim for three years in the service of Count Kinski. Vandini was still\r\nliving in Padua in 1770. The year of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nABACO, born at Verona, according to information contained in the\r\nsecond year of the “Leipsic Musical Paper” (p. 345), was a prominent\r\nvioloncellist, who lived in the first half of the eighteenth century.\r\nGerber possessed a cello solo of his composition, of which he says that\r\nit appeared to have been written in the year 1748.\r\n\r\nGIUSEPPE DALL’OGLIO, the younger brother of the famous violin player,\r\nDomenico dall’Oglio, was born about 1700 at Padua,[63] and went to St.\r\nPetersburg in 1735. There he remained in the Russian imperial service\r\ntwenty-nine years, after which he returned to his native land. On his\r\njourney thither he stopped at Warsaw, on which occasion King August of\r\nPoland nominated him his agent for the Venetian Republic.\r\n\r\nSALVATORE LANZETTI, born at the beginning of the eighteenth century in\r\nNaples, was pupil of the Conservatorio there, Santa Maria di Loreto,\r\nand was during the greater part of his life in the service of the King\r\nof Sardinia. He died in Turin in 1780. In the year 1736 two volumes\r\nof violoncello sonatas appeared by him, and later also a book of\r\ninstruction, the title of which Fétis gives as: “Principes du doigter\r\npour le Violoncelle dans tous les tons.” It is somewhat differently\r\nnamed by Gerber: “Principes ou l’applicatur de Violoncel par tous les\r\ntons.” Lanzetti must have carried out with great skill the staccato\r\ntouch both up and down the instrument.\r\n\r\nWe are somewhat better informed regarding the violoncellist CAPORALE.\r\nNeither the place of his home nor the year of his birth nor that of\r\nhis death are, indeed, known to us, but of his life and work in England\r\nwe possess some information. In 1735 he came to London and worked under\r\nHandel, who wrote for him a cello solo in the third act of his opera\r\n“Deidamia” composed in 1739.\r\n\r\nHis musical education could not have been very thorough, but he must\r\nhave had certain qualifications which induced Handel to connect himself\r\nwith him. Simpson’s Collection (see p. 49), published in London,\r\ncontains a Cello Sonata by Caporale, which does not speak much for his\r\ntalent in composition. It consists of _Adagio_, _Allegro_, and a _Theme_\r\nwith three variations after the manner of studies. As a player Caporale\r\nwas remarkable for his tone, but as regards finish he could not rival\r\neither the elder CERVETTO or PASQUALINI.\r\n\r\nThis last-named artist, by whom a sonata, scarcely rising above the\r\nlevel of Caporale, was contained in the volume already mentioned\r\nas appearing at Simpson’s, was performing in London, in 1745, as a\r\nconcertist of great repute. Further information regarding him does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nGreater consideration must be yielded to CARLO FERRARI, brother of\r\nthe violinist Domenico Ferrari, so often referred to in the previous\r\ncentury. On account of an injured foot he was called “the lame.” Born\r\nat Piacenza about 1730 he betook himself to Paris in 1758 and appeared\r\nwith great success in the “Concert spirituel.” In 1765 he accepted an\r\nengagement offered to him by the Count of Parma.[64] He remained in\r\nthis position until his death, which took place in 1789. It is reported\r\nof Ferrari that he was the first Italian cellist who made use of the\r\nthumb position. If this be true, France must have been beforehand in\r\nthe difficult matter of the art of fingering; for the thumb position\r\nwas already known in Paris, as we have seen, before 1740, consequently\r\nat a time when Ferrari was only ten or twelve years old. But if it be\r\nacknowledged that violoncello playing was cultivated much earlier in\r\nItaly than in France, and had already advanced beyond the elemental\r\nstage before it had found representatives among the French, we must be\r\ninclined to concede to the Italians the discovery of the thumb position,\r\nand indeed to the predecessors of Ferrari. It is highly probable that\r\nFranciscello and Batistin already availed themselves of its assistance\r\nfor the use of the upper parts of the fingerboard. The trick must have\r\nbeen brought into France by the last-named artist who, as we know,\r\nsettled in Paris at the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe proof that the thumb position was known in Paris before 1740\r\nis established by the violoncello method of Michel Corrette in the\r\nyear 1741, and which, as far as one can see, was the first work of\r\ninstruction for the instrument in question. Considering the scarcity\r\nat that time of cello compositions this instruction book is the more\r\nimportant, as from it is to be determined with certainty the average\r\nstandard to which violoncello playing had attained towards the middle of\r\nthe previous century. This circumstance seems to justify our entering\r\nsomewhat more fully into Corrette’s school.\r\n\r\nThe title is: “Méthode, théoretique et pratique, pour apprendre en peu\r\nde temps, le violoncelle ... dans sa perfection composée par Michel\r\nCorette. XXIV^e Ouvrage à Paris, chez l’auteur, M^e Boivin et le S^r le\r\nClerc; à Lyon chez M. de Bretonne. Avec Privilège du Roy. MDCCXL1.”[65]\r\n\r\nAfter some introductory paragraphs regarding the use of the F and C\r\nclef, in notation for violoncello music, concerning the value of notes\r\nand pauses, the formation of sharps, flats, and naturals, as well as\r\nregarding the usual marks, the various measures and syncopes, Corrette\r\ntreats:\r\n\r\n1. Of the manner of holding the violoncello; 2. Of the holding and\r\naction of the bow; 3. Of its use in the up and down strokes; 4. Of the\r\ntuning of the violoncello; 5. Of the division of the fingerboard into\r\ndiatonic as well as chromatic tones; 6. Of the fingering in the lower\r\n(first) and following positions; 7. Of the way and manner of returning\r\nfrom the higher positions to the first; 8. Of trills and appogiaturas;\r\n9. Of the various kinds of bow action; 10. Of double-stops and\r\narpeggios; 11. And also of the thumb position. He also gives instruction\r\nfor those who wish to go from the gamba to the violoncello, and then\r\nin conclusion gives hints for the accompaniment of singing and for\r\ninstrumental solos.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the directions of Corrette have chiefly a mere\r\nhistorical importance, as the technique of the violoncello, after\r\nthe appearance of his method, underwent substantial changes. His\r\nexplanation concerning the finger positions of that period and the\r\nthumb position which in the higher parts of the fingerboard takes the\r\nplace of a moveable nut, concerning the manipulation of the bow, and\r\nthe considerations to be observed in exchanging the gamba for the\r\nvioloncello have a special interest for us.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these four points, we remark that the finger\r\nposition adopted by Corrette for the diatonic scale on all the strings\r\nwas, in the first two positions, 1, 2, and 4; in the “third position,”\r\n1, 2, 3, 4; and in the “fourth,” 1, 2, and 3; after the latter position\r\nthe fourth finger was as a rule no longer needed, for which Corrette\r\nadduces as a reason that it is too short to be made use of in the higher\r\npositions of the fingerboard; in case however it should be necessary to\r\nuse it, the use of the left arm would be impeded. In exceptional cases,\r\nsays Corrette in another part of his school, the fourth finger could\r\nbe used in the “fourth position,” without altering the thumb position,\r\nfor the B flat and B on the A string, for the E flat on the D string,\r\nfor the A flat on the G string, and for the D flat on the C string.\r\nThe finger positions were then, in the first half and about the middle\r\nof the last century, somewhat different in the diatonic scale of the\r\nvioloncello than they were later on. It is especially to be remarked\r\nthat the E and the B were touched with the second finger upon the two\r\nlower strings, though the notes marked were far more convenient for the\r\nthird finger, which very shortly took the place of the second.\r\n\r\nAs to the exclusion of the fourth finger, when playing with the thumb\r\nposition, no proof is needed to show the reason was that it gave an\r\nawkward manner of holding the left hand. The finger positions for the\r\nchromatic scale still more widely differed from the fingering employed\r\nlater, as the following scale shows--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt very nearly happened, that as early as the seventeenth century when\r\na stringed instrument was so much desired as a standard one for the\r\nvioloncello, that the violin mode of fingering was adopted for the\r\nformer, which according to the foregoing remarks really was the case,\r\nwith the exception of the use of the third finger. It had however been\r\noverlooked that the cello, on account of its much larger dimensions,\r\ndemanded an entirely different method of fingering. The regulation of\r\nthis important point, which offered peculiar difficulties, occupied\r\ncellists up to the beginning of our century. In some measure the\r\nfingering which Corrette teaches for descending intervals of a second\r\nfrom the higher to the lower tones is unavoidable. He gives the two\r\nfollowing examples--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe gave the preference to the second example.\r\n\r\nThe almost total exclusion of the fourth finger caused a very great\r\nrestriction in playing with the thumb position. But when Corrette wrote\r\nhis work this limitation would hardly have been felt, as the higher\r\nparts of the fingerboard were little, and, only in exceptional cases,\r\nused by cello players and composers. Corrette mentions, as the highest\r\ntone, the one-lined B. Caporale and Pasqualini do not go beyond this\r\nnote in their sonatas, already mentioned, excepting in one instance,\r\nwhen Caporale casually uses the two-lined C. It appears that, with many\r\ncellists, in place of the thumb the first finger was made use of in\r\nthe higher positions as a support, for Corrette remarks concerning his\r\nmethod: “If the first finger is used instead of the thumb the fourth\r\nfinger must necessarily be made use of; it is, however, on account of\r\nits shortness, really useless in the upper ‘positions.’” To beginners\r\nCorrette recommended the attempt then in vogue--but a little later\r\ncombated by Leopold Mozart in his violin school[66]--to introduce marks\r\non the fingerboard indicating the intervals in order to learn to play\r\nclearly in tune. For gamba players who, following the spirit of the\r\ntime, gave up their instrument and turned to the violoncello, which was\r\nrapidly coming into use, this means of assistance had a certain value,\r\naccustomed as they were to the frets of the gamba fingerboard, for\r\nthe finger positions of both instruments differ considerably from one\r\nanother, as appears from the comparison given below by Corrette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scale on the gamba.\r\n\r\n  7.

Thumb-position.]\r\n\r\nThe figures placed under the gamba scale relate to the frets which are\r\nto be attended to by the player, while those of the cello scale are the\r\nfinger positions to be used.\r\n\r\nThe lower C, which the string itself forms on the cello, had on the\r\ngamba to be touched at the third fret; the succeeding D on the gamba was\r\nthe open string, while on the cello it was to be touched with the first\r\nfinger, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe four highest tones, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_, fell in the gamba on the\r\n2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th frets, whereas, according to Corrette’s account,\r\nthose in the cello required the use of the thumb position. It is plain\r\nthat the gamba players who took up the violoncello had to adopt an\r\nentirely different system of fingering.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent the handling of the bow presented difficulties\r\nto those who exchanged the gamba for the violoncello. The former\r\ninstrument, on account of the flatness of the bridge, did not allow of\r\nan energetic use of the bow. From the violoncello, on the contrary,\r\na powerful tone must be brought out, which had to be learnt by gamba\r\nplayers. Besides, they had also to accustom themselves to other strokes\r\nof the bow for the cello. What was played by the latter instrument with\r\na down stroke, was played by an upward one on the gamba, and the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nThe holding of the bow was again rather different from the present\r\nmanner. Corrette gives three ways for this. According to Corrette’s\r\ntestimony, the most usual way in Italy consisted in placing the 2nd,\r\n3rd, 4th, and 5th fingers upon the rod and the thumb beneath it, so that\r\nthe bow was held not exactly at the nut, but about a hand’s breadth\r\nfrom it, as formerly and even at the beginning of our century was done\r\nby many players. The second way of holding the bow was, the other four\r\nfingers being placed as above, to lay the thumb upon the hair. Finally,\r\nthe bow was also held, so that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th fingers were\r\nlaid upon that part of the rod to which the nut is attached, while the\r\nthumb had its place beneath the nut.\r\n\r\nCorrette does not give the preference to either of these ways of holding\r\nthe bow, which in the course of the second half of the last century\r\nbecame more and more obsolete. He was of opinion that they were all\r\ngood, but left it to each one to choose the manner in which the most\r\npower could be attained. It seems, however, noteworthy that Corrette\r\nlaid it down as a rule that the middle of the bow should be used in\r\nplaying, whereby its use was limited to a third of its length.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his method Corrette speaks of several systems amongst\r\nvioloncellists, but adds, the best and most generally followed was that\r\nof Bononcini, of which also the most skilful masters in Europe made use.\r\nFrom this remark it follows, that in the composition of his school,\r\nhe took Bononcini’s manner of playing, which he was able to study,\r\nsoon after the latter’s arrival in Paris, as his guide. In surveying\r\nthe above principles, detailed by Corrette, regarding the technique\r\nof violoncello playing, it must be admitted that, needing improvement\r\nin almost every respect about the middle of the last century, it had\r\nnot progressed, with few exceptions, beyond the elementary stages. The\r\nchamber sonatas and suites of Joh. Seb. Bach for violoncello solo, the\r\nlast of which were originally composed for the Viola pomposa, cannot be\r\ncited as proofs to the contrary. In them Bach forestalled the technical\r\ncapacity of his time by a decade. Although they are composed for that\r\npart of the fingerboard on which there is no question of the thumb\r\nposition, yet they contain difficulties of an extraordinary kind which\r\nBach’s contemporaries had not been able to master.[67] And even in the\r\nsecond half of the last century there could have been no cellist who\r\nwould have been fully capable of playing them. Therefore it must be\r\nconsidered either, that these compositions, so remarkable of their kind,\r\nwere not absolutely composed for the cello; or that the violoncello\r\ntechnique took another direction, which was called out by these suites\r\nof Bach.\r\n\r\nThe violoncello, like the violin, is primarily an instrument for the\r\nvoice. As such it was chiefly used by the Italians, who, up to the\r\nsecond half of the last century, gave the impulse to stringed instrument\r\nplaying. This is to be gathered from the cello pieces by Italian\r\ncomposers belonging to this period. As instances, next to the sonatas\r\nalready mentioned, two musical pieces of the same kind may be cited,\r\nby San Martini (Giov. Battista Sammartini)[68] and Bernardo Porta.[69]\r\nNeither of these composers were violoncellists. Their sonatas are,\r\nhowever, adapted to the nature of the instrument for which they were\r\ncomposed. As compositions they are indeed of little importance, and as\r\nregards the technique, they do not rise above the measure of the modest\r\ndemands which were then required.\r\n\r\nWith regard to cello technique the younger Cervetto, whose compositions\r\nhave already been mentioned, p. 52, goes really farther. In them\r\nthere is a greater variety in the manner of playing, in the use of\r\ndouble-stops and different passages derived from the scale and the\r\nchord. Such ways of playing could naturally only at first be found out\r\nand perfected in a proper manner by those who were already experienced\r\npractised players on an instrument of extreme difficulty on account of\r\nits extensions.\r\n\r\nThe cello pieces of Cervetto formed after the manner of Tartini’s violin\r\nsonatas are, as to their contents, quite antiquated, and are only\r\ninteresting in a purely technical point of view. Like the compositions\r\nalready considered, they occupy mostly the parts of tenor and bass.\r\nOnly twice in the first _Allegro_ of the tenth Sonata of his Op. 4 does\r\nCervetto venture to the twice-lined E, and at the conclusion of the same\r\npiece to the twice-lined A. In both cases he has to use the treble clef,\r\nwhich does not appear elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBesides Cervetto the younger, amongst Italians who cultivated cello\r\nplaying must be mentioned Gasparini, Moria, Joannini di Violoncello,\r\nZappa, Cirri, Aliprandi, Graziani, Piarelli, Spotorni I. and II., Barni,\r\nBertoja I. and II., Lolli, Sandonati, and Shevioni. We give below the\r\nmeagre information which exists regarding them.\r\n\r\nQUIRINO GASPARINI, a distinguished cellist, was in 1749 Kapellmeister at\r\nthe Court of Turin. He remained there until 1770. As a composer, he was\r\nchiefly occupied with church music, no cello pieces are known by him.\r\n\r\nOf MORIA, the fact only is known that, in 1755, he was heard at the\r\n“Concert Spirtuel” in Paris.\r\n\r\nJOANNINI DI VIOLONCELLO, from the year 1759 Kapellmeister at St.\r\nPetersburg, had a great reputation in his own country as a player.\r\n\r\nZAPPA, called FRANCESCO, according to Gerber was making a concert\r\ntour in 1781, and “enchanted his hearers in Dantsic by his soft and\r\ndelightful execution.”\r\n\r\nGIAMBATTISTA CIRRI, born in the first half of the eighteenth century, at\r\nForli, lived and worked for a long time in England. On the title page\r\nof his first work, published at Verona in 1763, he called himself a\r\n“Professore di Violoncello.” Of his compositions there appeared in print\r\nseventeen different works in London, Paris, and Florence.\r\n\r\nAs a clever violoncellist, BERNARDO ALIPRANDI, son of the opera\r\ncomposer, Aliprandi, born in Tuscany, was distinguished. His father was\r\ncomposer and Court band-conductor in Munich during the first half of the\r\nprevious century; but he himself became a member of the orchestra there,\r\nwhere he still was in 1786. His cello pieces, of which several were\r\npublished, are as obsolete as those of Cirri.\r\n\r\nGerber, in his dictionary, says of GRAZIANI, that after the death of the\r\ngamba player, Louis Christian Hesse,[70] he was summoned to Potsdam to\r\ntake his place as tutor to the Crown Prince of Prussia. When the French\r\nvioloncellist, Duport (the elder), came to Berlin, in 1773, Graziani\r\nlost his post at Court. He died at Potsdam in 1787. The six violoncello\r\nsolos, Op. 1 (printed in Berlin about the year 1780), as well as the six\r\ncello pieces brought out in Paris (Op. 2), mentioned by Gerber in his\r\nold Musical Dictionary under the name of Graziani, must have appeared in\r\nthe latter years of the author’s life.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the last century there was a violoncello virtuoso,\r\nby name PIARELLI, who, about 1784, had printed in Paris six violoncello\r\nsolos. This is all that is known about him.\r\n\r\nOf the brothers SPOTORNI, Gerber only says that, in 1770, in Italy,\r\n“their native land, they were esteemed as violoncellists.”\r\n\r\nA very skilful player was CAMILLO BARNI, born on January 18, 1762, at\r\nComo. He received his first instructions in cello playing at the age of\r\nfourteen years from his grandfather, David Ronchetti. Later on, Giuseppe\r\nGadgi, Canon of the Cathedral at Como, taught him for a few months. At\r\nthe age of twenty Barni joined the opera orchestra of Milan, of which he\r\nbecame first violoncellist in 1791. In the year 1802 he went to reside\r\npermanently in Paris, where he appeared as solo player, and then, for\r\nseveral years, was an active member in the orchestra of the Italian\r\nOpera. Between 1804 and 1809 he published several duets for his own\r\ninstrument and the violin. He also wrote a cello concerto.\r\n\r\nConcerning the brothers BERTOJA, Gerber only says that both were\r\nemployed in Venice about 1800, as virtuosi on the violoncello, and were\r\nreputed in Italy the first masters of their instrument.\r\n\r\nFILIPPO LOLLI, son of the violin virtuoso, Antonio Lolli, was born\r\nat Stuttgard, in 1773; practised the cello from early youth, and at\r\neighteen years of age made a concert tour, which led him to Berlin. Here\r\nhe was heard by the King, who was so pleased with his performance that\r\nhe recognised it by an honorarium of 100 louis d’or. Lolli then went to\r\nCopenhagen, and in the year 1804 played at concerts in Vienna. There is\r\nno more information about him extant.\r\n\r\nOf SANDONATI, Gerber says that he lived in Verona in 1800, and was one\r\nof the most renowned violoncellists of those times. Gerber announces the\r\nsame of the Mantuan, SHEVIONI, who worked about the same time apparently\r\nin Verona.\r\n\r\nWhile all these men were endeavouring to make an advance in violoncello\r\nplaying, and especially in violoncello compositions, the Italian nation\r\npossessed in Boccherini an artist who surpassed in every direction his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nLUIGI BOCCHERINI, the son of a contra-basso player, was born on February\r\n19, 1743, at Lucca. He there received his first musical instruction\r\nfrom the archbishop’s choirmaster, Vanucci. Besides the cultivation of\r\ntheory, he devoted himself with peculiar zeal to cello playing, of which\r\nhe was to prove a master. The very promising progress which he made\r\ndecided his father to send him to Rome for the further prosecution of\r\nhis studies, and where his talents attained their full development.\r\n\r\nWhen Boccherini, after the course of a few years, returned to his\r\nnative town, he found there Tartini’s pupil, Filippo Manfredini, his\r\ncountryman, who was an excellent violinist. He soon formed an intimate\r\nfriendship with him, which led to an arrangement for making a concert\r\ntour. The two artists went to Spain, afterwards to Piedmont, to\r\nLombardy, and the South of France. The favourable reception which the\r\nfriends experienced encouraged them about 1768 to proceed to Paris.\r\nIn the French capital they had a splendid success. The compositions\r\nof Boccherini gained such great applause that the Parisian music\r\npublishers, La Chevardière and Venier, declared themselves ready\r\nto undertake the expense of printing all the works already heard.\r\nNotwithstanding, he received very little for his compositions, and later\r\non he was not more fortunate.\r\n\r\nAt the persuasion of the Spanish ambassador in Paris the artists\r\nproceeded, at the end of 1768, or the beginning of the next year, to\r\nMadrid. Here Boccherini roused the special interest of the Infanta Don\r\nLuis, who named him his “Compositore e virtuoso di camera.” When this\r\nprince died, on August 7, 1785, Boccherini became Court Kapellmeister\r\nof King Charles III. of Spain, a post which he also filled under the\r\nsucceeding king, Charles IV. He received a still further recognition\r\nfrom the King Frederick William II. of Prussia, who designated him his\r\nchamber-composer, when he, in the year 1787, dedicated a work to this\r\nart-loving monarch, who conferred on him a considerable honorarium.\r\nFrom that time Boccherini dedicated to him everything that he composed.\r\nWe may conclude that he was adequately remunerated, for when the king\r\ndied in November, 1797, and the allowance ceased, Boccherini fell into\r\ndifficulties, his compositions being badly paid by the publishers. At\r\nthe same time he seems to have lost his place as Kapellmeister to the\r\nKing of Spain. However it was, he spent the last years of his life with\r\nhis family in great need, from which death only released him on May 28,\r\n1805.\r\n\r\nHaving in view the great quantity of his compositions, Boccherini must\r\nbe distinguished as an extremely prolific composer. There are in\r\nexistence 400 instrumental works by him. They consist of 20 symphonies,\r\n125 string quintets--amongst them are 113 for two cellos, of which\r\nthe first cello is more or less an obbligato--91 string quartets, and\r\nnumberless trios, septets, quintets with flute or oboe, violin sonatas,\r\nas well as several vocal compositions for the church, &c. Very little\r\nhas proved capable of surviving, and this little only awakens a limited\r\ninterest. The cause of it seems to be in a certain simplicity which\r\nunderlies all Boccherini’s music. With great cleverness of form, added\r\nto an apt and easy flow, it is certainly not wanting in originality,\r\nwhich has even a humorous tendency; but the manner of expression is\r\ncharacterised by a certain formality which gives to Boccherini’s music\r\nan antiquated air. His ideas are wanting in power of thought and depth\r\nof feeling; they rarely rise above the pleasing and agreeable.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century the chamber compositions of Boccherini\r\nhad an extraordinary popularity, especially amongst the _dilettanti_.\r\nFrom that time, however, they have been little played, at least in\r\nGermany. The interest in them was maintained much longer in France,\r\nwhere they were unusually prized, according to Fétis’s “Biographie\r\nUniverselle des Musiciens.” There also they have been for some time laid\r\non one side.\r\n\r\nBoccherini composed six concerti specially for the violoncello. There\r\nare also extant several cello sonatas with bass by him. It is surprising\r\nthat there is no mention made of them in the list of Boccherini\r\ncompositions by Fétis. Six of these sonatas have been republished on the\r\none hand by Friedrich Grützmacher, and, on the other, by Alfred Piatti,\r\nwith piano accompaniment. The violoncello concerti of Boccherini, on\r\nthe contrary, have fallen almost entirely into oblivion. They are only\r\nso far interesting in that by them is shown to what degree of technique\r\ncello playing was developed by this master. We must here observe\r\nthat he was one of the first of the Italian school who gave decided\r\nexpression to the solo and virtuoso side of his instrument. He not\r\nonly made possible for cello music the higher and highest parts of the\r\nthumb position, with the exception of the complicated harmonics first\r\ndiscovered and made available after his time, but he also considerably\r\nextended beyond his predecessors the playing of double stops as well as\r\nthe execution of passages.[71]\r\n\r\nIf in form they were somewhat superficially elaborate and worked out\r\nafter the manner of studies, yet instructive material for practice of\r\nan extent and variety hitherto unknown was provided for cellists. For\r\nItaly it was a sensible loss that Boccherini spent the greater part of\r\nhis life abroad, his native land was in consequence deprived of the\r\nadvantage which the personal influence and example of his strikingly\r\nartistic proficiency might have gained. If he had remained there he\r\nwould, doubtless, have been to his countrymen as regards cello playing\r\nwhat Corelli and Tartini were to Italian violin playing. But under the\r\nprevailing conditions Italy lacked a recognised musician who might\r\nhave been the means of further successfully developing that branch of\r\nart. Moreover, the decided preference of the Italians for opera from\r\nthe end of the last century, which prevailed to the cost of all other\r\nmusical efforts, checked for a time further impulse to or demand for the\r\ncultivation of stringed instrument playing, which until then had been so\r\nsuccessfully pursued on the Apennine Peninsula. What, however, Italy’s\r\nsons attained in the art of violoncello playing was not lost, but was\r\nfurther perfected by German and French masters, concerning which the\r\nfollowing sections will give the necessary explanation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] Some pieces composed for the viola d’amore by Ariosti, consisting\r\nof Cantabile, Vivace, Adagio, and Minuet, have been arranged by Alfred\r\nPiatti for the violoncello, and brought out lately in London.\r\n\r\n[61] Concerning the diverse vicissitudes of Bononcini’s and Ariosti’s\r\nlives, which can find no particular mention here, see “Musical\r\nLexicons,” extant.\r\n\r\n[62] Born in 1649, at Trapani, in Sicily; died on October 24, 1725,\r\nat Naples. In Grove’s Dictionary, 1659 is given as the date of his\r\nbirth--other authorities as above.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[63] Gerber gives Venice as his birthplace; but in the _Weekly News_ of\r\nthe year 1770, Padua is mentioned, which is probably correct.\r\n\r\n[64] In Jahn’s biography of Mozart is found the notice that Ferrari\r\nhad been appointed to the Court of the Archbishop of Salzburg; at what\r\nperiod is not mentioned.\r\n\r\n[65] Fétis says in his “Biographie universelle des Musiciens” (Vol.\r\nII., 365): “The first edition of Corrette’s music tutor appeared in\r\n1761.” On the title page, however, is plainly printed MDCCXL1. Fétis has\r\ninadvertently put the number L before the X instead of after.\r\n\r\n[66] The first edition of this appeared under the title: “Versuch einer\r\nGründlichen Violinschule.”\r\n\r\n[67] These cello pieces by Bach existed in all probability during this\r\nmaster’s directorship at Köthen (1717-1723). Spitta: “Joh. Seb. Bach,”\r\nI., 678 and 707.\r\n\r\n[68] Born towards the end of the seventeenth or the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, in Milan; died after 1770, in which year Burney\r\nfound him still living.\r\n\r\n[69] Born, in 1758, in Rome; died, 1832, in Paris. The two sonatas by\r\nSan Martini and Porta have already been mentioned, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[70] P. 29.\r\n\r\n[71] “That which renders Boccherini’s compositions unlike all others of\r\nthe kind is that he commonly assigns the principal part to the first\r\nvioloncello.”--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Violoncello had already found its place as an orchestral instrument\r\nabout the year 1680 at Vienna, and in 1709, in the Dresden Royal\r\norchestra, as we saw. Towards 1720 it had penetrated also into Northern\r\nGermany, since the band of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp evidently\r\npossessed one. At the same period this stringed instrument must have\r\nbeen extensively used in other parts of Germany--otherwise Joh. Seb.\r\nBach would scarcely have conceived the idea of composing for it his solo\r\nsonatas, which were already extant between the years 1717-1724. There\r\nwere even at that time two German violoncellists who appeared to Gerber\r\nof sufficient importance for him to give them a place in his Dictionary\r\nof Music. Their names are: Triemer and Riedel.\r\n\r\nJOHANN SEBALD TRIEMER was born at the end of the seventeenth or the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century, in Weimar, where he was instructed\r\nin instrumental playing by the Ducal Chamberlain and Musician,\r\nEylenstein, and in the theory of music by Ehrbach, an old musician of\r\nWeimar. As soon as Triemer had made progress sufficient to figure as a\r\nsoloist, he undertook a concert tour which led him to Hamburg, for, in\r\n1725, he was a member of the theatre orchestra there. Two years after\r\nhe went to Paris, and remained until 1729. During this time he pursued\r\nthe study of composition under the direction of Boismortier.[72] He then\r\nwent to the Dutch city of Alkmaar, and, later on, to Amsterdam, where\r\nhe died in 1762. At Amsterdam he had six “Sonate a Violoncello solo e\r\ncontinuo” published.\r\n\r\nThe Silesian, RIEDEL, was not only a cellist, but also chief of the\r\nFencing School at Liegnitz. He must have been a very good player for\r\nhis time. About 1727 he went to St. Petersburg, and was there the\r\ninstructor of the EMPEROR PETER II. (who, as is known, only reigned\r\nthree years--1727-1730), both in cello playing and in fencing.\r\n\r\nRiedel was also member of the Russian Court band, where he still was in\r\n1740.\r\n\r\nThe number of German violoncello players very soon increased. Amongst\r\nthem, Werner must next be mentioned, born at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century in Bohemia, and died in Prague, 1768. He must have\r\nbeen a most excellent player, since, as Gerber says, in his time no\r\nforeign cellist ventured to play in Prague. Werner was for some time\r\nestablished at the Crusaders’ Church, in Prague. Of his numberless\r\nconcertos and solos for violoncello, none seem to have been printed.\r\n\r\nThe violoncellist, CASPAR CRISTELLI, born in Vienna at the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, was, in 1757, chief composer in the service of\r\nthe Archbishop of Salzburg. He specially distinguished himself as an\r\naccompanist, a talent at that time highly prized, for the cellists who\r\naccompanied the vocal recitatives played an important part. Cristelli\r\nalso wrote several compositions for his instrument.\r\n\r\nJOHANN BAPTIST BAUMGÄRTNER, born 1723, in Augsburg, died May 18, 1782,\r\nat Eichstädt, as chamber virtuoso of the Prince Bishop, was educated\r\nin Munich, and then made a concert tour through Germany, England,\r\nHolland, and Scandinavia. Besides some violoncello concertos he\r\nwrote: “Instruction de musique théoretique et pratique a l’usage de\r\nvioloncelle.” This instruction book appeared in 1774 or 1777, at the\r\nHague.\r\n\r\nWENZEL HIMMELBAUER, born 1725, in Bohemia, was in Prague in 1764; went,\r\nhowever, to Vienna, and had a good reputation as cellist. His playing\r\nwas chiefly famed for firmness of the bow stroke and quickness at\r\nsight reading. C. F. Daniel Schubart remarks of him in his “Ideen zu\r\neiner Aesthetik der Tonkunst”: “He was a sincere and a most agreeable\r\nvioloncellist, without any artistic pride; a man of the most upright and\r\namiable heart”; and he further remarks: “No one uses his bow so quietly\r\nand easily as this master. He executes the most difficult passages with\r\nthe most extraordinary ease, and especially pours out his heart in\r\nthe _Cantabile_. His sweet expression, his delightful phrasing, and,\r\nmoreover, his great power in the middle tints are the wonder of all\r\nconnoisseurs and hearers.” He composed little for his instrument, but\r\nthis little has all the more intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nOf Himmelbauer’s compositions there appeared at Lyons, 1776, as Op.\r\n1, duets for flute or violin and violoncello. A few duets for two\r\nvioloncellos remained unpublished. The MS. was, in 1795, in the\r\npossession of the Bohemian cellist, Emeric Patrzik, and later fell into\r\nthe hands of the author of “The Art Lexicon for Bohemia,” G. J. Dlabacz.\r\n\r\nPHILIPP SCHINDLÖKER must be mentioned as a noteworthy pupil of\r\nHimmelbauer’s. Born on October 25, 1753, at Mons, in Hennegau, he went\r\nvery young to Vienna, whither his parents betook themselves. There\r\nhe began the study of the violoncello. In 1795 he was appointed solo\r\nvioloncellist at the Royal Opera House, Vienna, and three years later\r\nto the orchestra of the Cathedral, S. Stephan. In the year 1806 he\r\nreceived the title of Imperial Chamber Virtuoso. He died April 16,\r\n1827. Sixteen years previously he had already retired into private\r\nlife. Of his compositions only a serenade for the Violoncello and\r\nGuitar was published. The rest, consisting of a Concerto, Sonatas with\r\nbass accompaniment, and a Rondo also with bass accompaniment, remained\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, WOLFGANG SCHINDLÖKER, born in 1789 at Vienna, was educated\r\nby him as a clever cellist. After he had been heard at fourteen years of\r\nage at a concert, he went in 1807 as chamber musician into the service\r\nof the Court at Würzburg. His compositions consisted of a “Grand duo”\r\nand three Duets, which were published.\r\n\r\nFRANZ JOSEPH WEIGL belonged to the best German cellists of the last\r\ncentury; he was the father of the opera composer, Joseph Weigl, formerly\r\nin much repute. He was born on March 19, 1740, in a Bavarian village,\r\nand through the special recommendation of Joseph Haydn was received on\r\nJune 1, 1761, into the orchestra of Count Esterhazy. In 1769 he left and\r\njoined the orchestra of the Italian opera in Vienna. After three years\r\nof active work there he was appointed to the Imperial band, and made\r\nCourt and Chamber musician; his death took place on January 25, 1820.\r\nWeigl composed, but if for his own instrument is unknown.\r\n\r\nANTON FILTZ, a member of the Electoral Chapel at Mannheim, was a gifted\r\ncellist and composer. He died in 1768 in early manhood, before his\r\ntalent had fully developed. He left in MS. several duets and solos, as\r\nwell as Concertos for the Violoncello.\r\n\r\nJOH. GEORG SCHETKY, born 1740, at Darmstadt, deserves special mention\r\nas a pupil of Filtz, whose instruction he enjoyed for one month, after\r\nhis father, who was Secretary to the Grand Duke of Darmstadt and tenor\r\nsinger at the Cathedral, had given him his first musical education.\r\nHe seems to have taken up cello playing by himself at first, but his\r\ntheoretical education was carried on by the Concertmaster Enderle.\r\nIn the year 1761 Schetky went for six months with his father and two\r\nsisters to Hamburg. There he had the opportunity of hearing great\r\nartists, which incited him to zealous study on his instrument. On his\r\nreturn to Darmstadt he found a post in the orchestra there. Now and then\r\nhe performed at concerts in the neighbouring towns. After the death of\r\nhis parents he finally quitted Darmstadt in 1768. He visited Hamburg and\r\nthen London, where the patronage of Joh. Christoph Bach was of service\r\nto him. Schetky did not however remain long in the English capital, as\r\nhe received a proposal to go to Edinburgh, which he accepted. He very\r\nsoon, in consequence of his marriage with a rich widow, retired into\r\nprivate life, being known to fame only through his compositions. These,\r\ntaking no account of an important collection of various orchestral\r\nand chamber music works, consist of numberless Violoncello Concertos,\r\nDuets for Violin and Violoncello, Sonatas for Violoncello and Bass, and\r\n“Twelve Duets for two Violoncellos, with some Observations and Rules for\r\nplaying that Instrument” (Op. 7). In these duets, as the title says:\r\n“Schetky had a scholastic aim in view.” Yet they can scarcely be called\r\na violoncello school.\r\n\r\nOne of the last of Schetky’s published works is his Op. 13, which\r\ncontains six Sonatas for Violoncello with unfigured bass. The\r\ncompositions therein contained give a distinct idea of his fluent though\r\nsuperficially mechanical manner of writing. It can readily be discerned\r\nthat Schetky had for the time in which he lived a remarkable technique\r\nin playing. He must have been able with ease to play at sight the first\r\nviolin part in Quartets, a talent which proves at once his skill and\r\nreadiness. His power and agility in bowing as well as his staccato\r\nplaying in up and down strokes were famous.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gerber’s account, Schetky died in Edinburgh in 1773. In\r\nForster’s “History of the Violin” it is said, on the contrary, that his\r\ndeath took place only in 1824.[73]\r\n\r\nAs a “clever and solid concert player and composer for his instrument,”\r\nMARKUS HEINRICH GRAUL, who was born in the first half of the last\r\ncentury, is mentioned by Gerber. In the year 1766 he belonged to the\r\nRoyal orchestra at Berlin. He also composed pieces for the cello, but\r\ndid not publish them.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, JOH. HEINRICH VIKTOR ROSE, born on December 7, 1743, at\r\nQuedlinburg, was early instructed to play on various instruments by his\r\nfather, who was town musician in the above-named place. The Princess\r\nAmalie, who then filled the office of Abbess in the Quedlinburg Convent,\r\nbecame interested in him, and took him with her to Berlin in 1756,\r\nwhere he studied cello playing for some years under Graul and Mara.\r\nIn 1763 he entered the service of the Prince of Anhalt-Bernberg. Four\r\nyears later he relinquished that in order to travel, and accepted a\r\nplace in the band of the Duke of Dessau. He did not long remain there,\r\nfor in the year 1772 he accepted an offer to be organist at the place\r\nof his birth. According to Gerber’s account he possessed not only an\r\nextraordinary readiness on the violoncello, but also a most expressive,\r\ngraceful rendering. Of his compositions, there were three solos with\r\nbass accompaniment published as Op. 1.\r\n\r\nHis best pupil was FRIEDRICH SCHRÖDEL, born on February 4, 1754, in\r\nBaruth; died January 10, 1800, at Ballenstedt. Gerber calls him one of\r\nthe greatest masters on the violoncello of that period, and adds that\r\nmany were of opinion that he surpassed the famous Mara in precision and\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nJOHANN JÄGER must be noticed with special distinction as belonging to\r\nthe German cellists of the last century. Schubart, who must have known\r\nhim personally, says in his eccentric manner: “Jäger is quite original;\r\nhis bowing new, unconstrained, and impetuously fiery. All masters apply\r\nthe thumb to the D string, and so bring out the high passages; but Jäger\r\ndeparts entirely from this method--a proof that his genius has more than\r\none way of attaining his aim. He goes with lightning dexterity up to the\r\nD and A strings in the highest parts and brings out the most delicate\r\nphrases with the greatest tenderness and sweetness.... Jäger is also\r\na great reader, _prima vista_--that is, he can play from the music at\r\nsight the most difficult pieces with wonderful art.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Jäger Violoncello compositions, which altogether\r\nremained unpublished, Schubart remarks: “He follows no rules in\r\ncomposition, but is guided solely by his ear. His Concertos and Sonatas\r\nconsist chiefly of original themes, which are grand, noble, adapted to\r\nthe instrument, and full of difficulties. Jäger caused his pieces to\r\nbe revised by good musicians, whereby they were put into correct form.\r\nAt the same time it must be confessed that the superfluous boughs, the\r\noffspring often of an unbridled fancy, have not all been pruned off.”\r\n\r\nAs Jäger’s compositions are not extant there is no possibility of\r\nputting to the proof the justice of Schubart’s judgment.\r\n\r\nWe can only gather that Jäger was self-taught. He appears to have\r\nbeen so even as a player. There is nowhere any intimation that he had\r\nany regular instruction on the violoncello. Gerber makes only the\r\nremark that Jäger became, under the influence of the Kapellmeister at\r\nWürtemburg, “the great man” whom the world admired.\r\n\r\nAs Fétis informs us, Jäger was born on August 17, 1748, in the little\r\ntown of Schlitz.[74] He was originally oboe player in the service of\r\nHolland. He cultivated at first as his favourite instrument the French\r\nhorn. After he had been actively engaged at the Court of Stuttgard,\r\nthe post of chamber virtuoso in the Anspach Bayreuth orchestra fell to\r\nhis lot. The position left him a great deal of spare time, so that he\r\nwas able to practise diligently the violoncello, and also to undertake\r\nconcert tours, which led him to London in 1781.\r\n\r\nJäger had two sons who were educated as violoncellists under his\r\ndirection. The elder, JOHANN ZACHARIAS LEONHARD, born 1777, at Anspach,\r\nshowed an early development and was able, even at nine years of age,\r\nto execute solos with rapidity, certainty, and accuracy. In 1787 he\r\nplayed at the Prussian Court, and on that occasion so greatly excited\r\nthe admiration of the Queen that she wished to acquire him for the Royal\r\nband in Berlin, to which, however, the father of the boy would not yield\r\non account of his youth. The Queen, therefore, proved her interest in\r\nhim by granting him a life-long pension of 100 thalers. On his return\r\nhome the Margrave of Anspach appointed him his chamber musician. He did\r\nnot, however, remain long in this position, and went with his father to\r\nBreslaw. There Jäger’s younger son was born, whose christian name was\r\nErnst. He possessed even more talent than his brother, for it was not\r\nlong before he overtook him in cello playing, to which the instructions\r\nhe received from Bernhard Romberg greatly contributed. Until the year\r\n1825 he lived at Breslaw, after having travelled through a great part of\r\nGermany and Hungary. Then he responded to a summons from the Bavarian\r\nCourt to go as solo cellist to Munich.\r\n\r\nBesides his two sons, Johann Jäger educated also ALEXANDER UBER, born\r\nat Breslaw, 1783, as a capable violoncellist. His father, by profession\r\na solicitor, was an enthusiastic lover of music, occupied his leisure\r\nhours with the composition of chamber music, and instituted weekly two\r\nconcerts in his house. At one of them symphonies were produced, at the\r\nother quartets and quintets. At the beginning of our century, Carl\r\nMaria v. Weber, who began his career at the Breslaw Theatre, took part\r\nin these musical entertainments, as did also the Director of music in\r\nthe University at Berne and the piano player Klingohr. The intercourse\r\nwith these men was not of less importance for the musical development\r\nof young Uber than his musical life in his father’s house. At first he\r\nenjoyed the violin instruction of Jannizeck, while Schnabel conducted\r\nhis theoretical studies. But he very soon took up the violoncello,\r\nfor which Jäger was his teacher. In the year 1804 he undertook his\r\nfirst tour, but returned soon to Breslaw. In the course of time Uber\r\nfilled many positions as Kapellmeister, until about 1820 he settled\r\nat Basle, where he was married. In 1823 he undertook the post of\r\nConductor with the Count of Schönaich and Prince von Karolath, but, in\r\nthe following year, death carried him off. Of his compositions for the\r\nvioloncello, Uber published a Concerto (Op. 12), Variations with Quartet\r\naccompaniment (Op. 14), Six Caprices (Op. 10), and Sixteen Variations\r\nupon a German air.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the last century the art of violoncello\r\nplaying had already very extensively spread throughout Germany and\r\nhad many more noteworthy representatives than in Italy and France. In\r\nthe latter country the higher pursuit of music was confined chiefly\r\nto Paris, and in Italy, as we have already remarked in a previous\r\nparagraph, the opera was most decidedly in the foreground, while there\r\nwas no great demand for instrumental music. On the contrary, Germany\r\ncalled out more instrumental vigour in order to satisfy the need\r\nof good musicians for the numberless Courts. According to Gottlieb\r\nFriedrich Krebel’s European genealogical handbook of the year 1770,\r\nthere were, including the Romaic-German Emperor and the King of Prussia,\r\nover two hundred secular and spiritual princes and sovereign counts,\r\nthe greater number of whom supported Kapelle (bands) or at least\r\nchamber music. These persons considered it of utmost importance to\r\nhave about them not only good violin and wind instrument players, but\r\nalso capable violoncellists, and consequently more talented young men\r\ndevoted themselves in Germany to instrumental music, and especially to\r\nvioloncello playing, than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the introduction of the Violoncello from Italy\r\nto Germany was by way of Vienna. At least, up to the present time, there\r\nare no proofs that the appreciation of this instrument and its reception\r\ninto the orchestra had taken place sooner in other German places than in\r\nthe Austrian capital. There was an eager demand for music from the reign\r\nof Maximilian I., to which the musical inclinations of the Imperial\r\nfamily contributed. Maximilian II., Ferdinand III., Leopold I., Charles\r\nVI., Francis I., and Joseph II., each in his own way, presented to the\r\ninhabitants of Vienna a good example as regarded the encouragement of\r\nmusic. Already several decades before the birth of the last-mentioned\r\nprince, who himself played the violoncello, this instrument had been\r\nnaturalised in Vienna as an orchestral instrument. Under his reign,\r\nafter the advent of Franciscello, whose performances gave an impulse\r\nto emulation, Vienna was already in possession of some remarkable solo\r\ncellists. To them belong the two SCHINDLÖKERS and JOSEPH WEIGL, who\r\nhave already been mentioned, as well as JOHANN HOFFMANN, member of the\r\nCourt band, MARTEAU, HAUER, and KÜFFEL;[75] somewhat later followed the\r\ncellists CAJETAN, GOTTLIEB, SCHEIDL, and HAUSCHKA.\r\n\r\nNothing is known concerning Scheidl. We have more information regarding\r\nVINCENZ HAUSCHKA, who was born on January 21, 1766, at Mies, in Bohemia,\r\nand died in Vienna, 1840. He received his first musical education as\r\nchoirboy in the Prague Cathedral. After six years’ study he devoted\r\nhimself to violoncello playing, in which the Bohemian, Christ,\r\ninstructed him for a short time. He eventually studied independently. At\r\nsixteen he had made such progress that he found a place in the Kapelle\r\nof Count Thun. Two years later he was released from this engagement\r\nby the death of his benefactor. Hauschka then undertook a tour in\r\nGermany. In 1792 he appeared in Vienna, where he gained everywhere\r\napplause by his performances. Later, a situation was offered to him in\r\nthe Imperial State service. From that time he made no professional use\r\nof his art. But he did not quite abandon it, as he took part in the\r\nfoundation of the “Society of the Friends of Music,” or “Gesellschaft\r\nder Musikfreunde,” as well as the “Concert Spirituel,” and was occupied\r\nalso in both these musical institutions which were of such importance to\r\nmusical life in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe Dresden Hofkapelle possessed, in the second half of the last\r\ncentury, two noteworthy cellists, HEINRICH MEGELIN and CALMUS. The\r\nfirst, according to Gerber’s testimony, was counted amongst the\r\ncleverest players of his instrument. Calmus belonged, in 1797, to the\r\norchestra of the Altona “National Orchestra,” and was then a highly\r\nreputed member of the Hofkapelle at Dresden, where he died January,\r\n1809.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin the violoncello first came to be appreciated at its due value\r\nthrough Frederick William II. It is true it had been already well\r\nrepresented under Frederick the Great, in the Court band, by GRAUL[76]\r\nand the two cellists MARA (father and son), to be mentioned elsewhere;\r\nbut that great monarch, whose favourite instrument was the flute, does\r\nnot appear to have thought much of the violoncello, which he feigned to\r\nallude to as the “nasal instrument,” an expression which might have been\r\nbestowed formerly on the gamba.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, Frederick William II., liked the violoncello, and well\r\nunderstood how to handle it. He appears to have played the gamba in\r\nhis younger days, for it is reported that the gambist Hesse[77] first\r\ntaught him, though this instruction might also have referred to the\r\nvioloncello, which many gambists took up at the same time. Later on the\r\ncellist GRAZIANI was master to the Prussian heir to the throne. But when\r\nDUPORT THE ELDER came to Berlin, in 1773, GRAZIANI was dismissed in\r\nfavour of him. The future king, Frederick William II., must have played\r\nwith taste and readiness. It is well known that Beethoven dedicated to\r\nhim his two Cello Sonatas (Op. 5).\r\n\r\nAmongst the cellists who belonged to the Berlin Chapel towards the end\r\nof the last century must be mentioned--\r\n\r\nJOHANN GEORGE FLEISCHMANN, a skilful player, who was at first in the\r\nservice of the Duke of Courland, but afterwards went to Berlin. In 1792\r\nhe followed the king, on his expedition against the French, as his\r\naccompanist.\r\n\r\nA second cellist, who worked at the same time in the Berlin Kapelle, was\r\nS. L. FRIEDEL.\r\n\r\nAs a pupil of Duport the younger, HEINRICH GROSSE, born at Berlin, is\r\ndistinguished. In 1798 he joined the Royal band.\r\n\r\nThe elder Duport[78] educated the cellist O. F. G. HANSMANN, who\r\nwas born at Potsdam on May 30, 1769, and was engaged at fifteen\r\nyears of age in the Berlin Kapelle. In 1790 he undertook the post of\r\nChoir-director at the opera. He appears to have quite given up his work\r\nas Kapellmeister when, in 1809, the place of Organist at the Church of\r\nSt. Peter, at Berlin, was given to him. He continued in the service of\r\nthe church until the year 1833, when he was appointed Royal Accountant.\r\nThree years later, on May 4, 1836, death called him away.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Berlin Kapelle possessed, in HERBIG, a pupil of the younger\r\nMara.\r\n\r\nAt the Court of Mecklenberg, in 1785, FRANZ XAVER HUBER, born in\r\nthe little Bavarian town of Öttingen, was working as a much esteemed\r\nvioloncellist.\r\n\r\nIn the Brunswick Kapelle was A. W. F. MATERN, after the middle of the\r\nlast century a player of some repute, who brought up his two sons as\r\ncellists.\r\n\r\nHanover was represented by the brothers FRIEDRICH ERNST and PHILIPP\r\nFRIEDRICH BENEKE. Both belonged to the Elector’s Court and Chamber Music\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nThe Hofkapelle at Dessau possessed, in JOH. CHRISTOPH BISCHOFF, born in\r\n1748 at Erfurt, a very fair violoncellist.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most creditable cellists of the second half of the last\r\ncentury, JOH. CONRAD SCHLICK must be mentioned. He is said to have\r\nbeen born at Münster in 1759, and died at Gotha in 1825, where he was\r\nestablished for more than forty years with the title of Concertmaster\r\nof the Ducal band, after he had, about 1776, belonged to the Episcopal\r\nChapel at Münster. In the year 1785 he married the very celebrated\r\nviolin virtuoso, Regina Strinasacchi, with whom he was engaged, in the\r\nwinter of 1799-1800, as solo player at the Leipsic Gewandhaus.\r\n\r\nSchlick had a gifted pupil in J. G. HEMMERLEIN, born at Bamberg, who\r\nheld the post of Concertmaster to the Elector Bishop of Fulda at the end\r\nof last century.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with Schlick, JOHANN DAVID SCHEIDLER, born in 1748,\r\ndied on October 20, 1802, was employed as a much-liked violoncellist in\r\nthe Gotha Kapelle.\r\n\r\nThe Ducal band of Meiningen also possessed a good violoncellist. It was\r\nJ. J. KRIEGCK, originally violinist and member of the Flemish Opera at\r\nAmsterdam. During his residence in Paris he took up the violoncello,\r\nand received there instruction from the younger Duport. After he had\r\nstudied for awhile under this artist he was engaged by Prince Laval\r\nMontmorency, in whose service he remained four years, when he was\r\nsummoned to Meiningen. There he worked and was still living in the year\r\n1810. Kriegck was born on June 25, 1750, at Bibra, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Eckertsberga, in the district of Merseburg. His cello compositions,\r\nconsisting of three Concertos and some Sonatas with bass, are among the\r\nbest of that period.\r\n\r\nThe violoncellist HIZELBERGER was, in 1786, in the service of the Bishop\r\nof Würzburg as chamber musician.\r\n\r\nAt the Court of Wallenstein, about 1790, PAUL WINNEBERGER was engaged\r\nas Director of the Royal Hunt and Table Music. In the year 1800 he\r\nexchanged this post for that of cellist and composer to the French\r\nTheatre at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nIn the Thurn-and-Taxis Kapelle at Regensburg were two cellists, GRETSCH\r\nand KARAUSCHEK. The first was there until his death, which occurred\r\nin 1784. Karauschek, on the contrary, who was famous as an excellent\r\ncellist, only belonged to it from 1750-1760. Religious fanaticism caused\r\nhim later to go into a Carmelite cloister. He died in 1789.\r\n\r\nTo the Munich Court music, in the second half of the last century,\r\nbelonged VIRGILI.[79] He is remarkable as having given his first\r\ninstruction to the violoncellist MORALT. This last artist, who was\r\nborn in the Bavarian capital in 1780, and died in 1829, finished his\r\ntraining under the violoncellist ANTON SCHWARZ, of Mannheim, and, having\r\ncompleted his studies, went into the Hofkapelle of his native city.\r\n\r\nAnother pupil of Anton Schwarz whose name is well known was MAX BOHRER,\r\nborn at Munich in 1785. He made such progress, that already as a boy\r\nof fourteen years of age he entered the Hofkapelle there. Soon after\r\nhe undertook a concert tour with his brother Anton, who was an able\r\nviolinist, and this led him to Vienna. There he heard Bernhard Romberg,\r\nwho henceforth became his model. Towards 1830, after he had for a time\r\nbeen a member of the Royal band at Berlin, he went to Paris, where\r\nhis fine tone and his ease in surmounting the most difficult passages\r\nexcited admiration. Then he travelled through Germany, in 1832 was\r\nappointed first cellist to the King of Wurtemburg with the title of\r\nConcertmeister, went in 1838 (for the second time) to St. Petersburg,\r\nand then proceeded to Italy. The years 1842-1843 he spent in America\r\ngiving concerts. He took his last journey, which led him to the\r\ncountries of Northern Europe, in 1847, but he was not able to obtain\r\nthe same amount of approbation, for he had lost a great deal of his\r\npower of execution. He died in 1867. He edited three Concertos, several\r\n“Airs variés,” a “Fantasia” on a Russian Volkslied, a Rondoletto with a\r\nquartet accompaniment, and some Duets with violin.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the above-named Moralt in the Bavarian Court Kapelle,\r\n“PETER THE GREAT,” so-called, according to Gerber, “on account of his\r\ntalent,” born at Zweibrücken, in 1778, was actively engaged, and in 1792\r\nwas promoted to be member of the Bavarian Hofkapelle.\r\n\r\nFor Stuttgard the violoncellists Zumpsteeg and Kaufmann deserve\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJOH. RUDOLPH ZUMPSTEEG was the more important. He was born on January\r\n10, 1760, at Sachsenflur, in the Odenwald, and died on January 27,\r\n1802, at Stuttgard. The royal Kapellmeister Poli (at Wurtemburg) was\r\nhis teacher. Under his direction Zumpsteeg became not only an excellent\r\nperformer, but also a creditable composer of music. He received a\r\nlearned education at the Karlschule, where he entered into friendly\r\nrelations with Schiller, and set to music many of his poems. He made\r\nhimself particularly known through ballad compositions, which were first\r\nattempted by him.\r\n\r\nAfter he had quitted the Karlschule, Zumpsteeg devoted himself entirely\r\nand actively to art. Up to the year 1792 he was simply member of the\r\nStuttgard Court band, of which he became the head after the decease of\r\nhis master, Poli. Zumpsteeg played the violoncello with “deep feeling,\r\nrare precision, and decisive power,” as Gerber remarks. He wrote for it\r\na Concerto, Sonatas, a Duet, and a Trio.\r\n\r\nJOHANN KAUFMANN, born in 1760, was likewise a pupil at the Karlschule,\r\nwhence also came--\r\n\r\nERNST HÄUSLER, born in 1761, in Stuttgard. He led a somewhat variable\r\nlife. In the year 1788 he went on an artistic tour, during which he\r\nplayed especially in Vienna and Berlin. Soon after he took an engagement\r\nin the band of the Prince of Donaueschingen. But in 1791 he relinquished\r\nthis position in order to obey a summons to Zurich. Thence, six years\r\nlater, he returned to his native town, and in 1801 went to Augsburg,\r\nand, in 1802, to Vienna, to hold concerts. Finally he assumed the\r\noffice of choir director at the Evangelical Church at Augsburg, in which\r\nplace he died on February 28, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Kapelle at Mannheim possessed in CARL LOCHNER, born about\r\n1760, died 1795, as well as in PETER RITTER, remarkable cellists.\r\nRitter, born at Mannheim in 1760, must have had higher claims to\r\ndistinction on account of his musical education than Lochner, for\r\nhe was promoted to the direction of the opera at the theatre of his\r\nbirthplace. With the exception of a journey to Berlin, undertaken in the\r\nyear 1785, where he played before the Court, he seems to have pursued\r\nuninterruptedly his official duties.\r\n\r\nTo the Mannheim orchestra belonged the violoncellists, JOHANN FÜRST,\r\nLUDWIG SIMON, and ANTON SCHWARZ, already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs an offspring of Mannheim, FRANZ DANZI must also be mentioned, the son\r\nof the first violoncellist in the orchestra there, Innocenz Danzi. His\r\nfather gave him instruction on the cello, and Abt Vogler in composition.\r\nHe soon made such rapid progress in playing that already, in 1778,\r\nhe was received into the Electoral Kapelle, which, as is known, was\r\ntransferred to Munich about this time in consequence of the union of\r\nBavaria with the Palatinate. He immediately began his work as a composer\r\nfor the opera. Meantime, in the year 1790, he was united in matrimony\r\nto the exquisite singer, Margaretha Marchand, daughter of the Opera\r\nDirector in Munich. The following year the young couple went to Leipsic\r\nand Prague, where Danzi conducted the opera of Guardassoni’s Italian\r\nOpera Company, while his wife took part as a singer. In 1794-1795 he\r\ntravelled with his wife in Italy, and in 1797 they both returned to\r\nMunich on account of the failing condition of the latter’s health.\r\nDanzi was immediately appointed Vice-Kapellmeister, and displayed most\r\npraiseworthy activity. He was, however, so overcome by the death,\r\nin 1799, of the partner of his life, that for many years he seemed\r\nunable to perform the duties of his vocation, and as it was repugnant\r\nto his feelings to take up work again in the place where his family\r\nhappiness had been wrecked, he obeyed a summons to Stuttgard as Court\r\nKapellmeister. He there remained a year, at the end of which he assumed\r\nthe direction of the opera at Carlsruhe. Danzi was born May 15, 1763,\r\nand died April 13, 1826.\r\n\r\nIn the chapel at Mainz, in the year 1783 to 1784, there were the clever\r\ncellist and lutist, JOH. CHRISTIAN GOTTLIEB SCHINDLER, the brothers\r\nJOSEPH and ANDREAS SCHWACHHOFER, and at the Court of Treves was also at\r\nthat time CARL CASPAR EDER, born 1751 in Bavaria, who made himself known\r\nas a cello player in several tours.\r\n\r\nTo the Electoral Kapelle at Bonn belonged JOSEPH REICHA and MAXIMILIAN\r\nWILLMAN.\r\n\r\nREICHA, uncle of the gifted composer, Anton Reicha, was born at Prague\r\nin 1746; found at first a position with Count Wallenstein, and a few\r\nyears later received the appointment of Concert leader at Bonn. He was\r\nworking there with some reputation until his death in 1795.\r\n\r\nWILLMAN, born in 1768, at Forchtenberg, a village between Würzburg and\r\nMergentheim, was member of the Bonn Hofkapelle in the last decade of\r\nthe past century, after he had been resident for a few years in Vienna.\r\nLater on he returned to Vienna and found a post there as solo player at\r\nthe theatre. Willman, who died in 1812, had two daughters, the elder\r\nof whom was a pupil of Mozart for the pianoforte, and the younger an\r\nexcellent singer. Louis von Beethoven solicited the hand of the latter,\r\nbut in vain.\r\n\r\nBesides Reicha and Willman, the celebrated violoncellist, BERNHARD\r\nROMBERG, belonged to the Kapelle at Bonn from 1790-1793. With regard to\r\nthis artist the necessary information will be given in the next section\r\non Germany, for the distinctive influence of his work belongs to the\r\nnineteenth century. To the above-mentioned German violoncellists are to\r\nbe added Immler, Schönebeck, Rauppe, Bauersachs, Alexander, and Arnold.\r\n\r\nIMMLER, born in 1750, at Weitramsdorf, near Coburg, found a sphere for\r\nwork in Göttingen. His playing was distinguished especially for its fine\r\ntone and agreeable manner of rendering. He was also a good violinist.\r\n\r\nKARL SIEGMUND SCHÖNEBECK, born on October 26, 1758, at Lübben, in Lower\r\nLusatia, was originally destined for the surgical profession, but felt\r\nhimself so irresistibly drawn towards music that all attempts to hold\r\nhim back from it failed through his opposition. In the fourteenth\r\nyear of his age he was made town musician in his native place. During\r\nhis fifteenth year he devoted himself, mostly alone, to the learning\r\nof various instruments. Then he went as assistant to the town band\r\nof the Silesian town of Grüneberg. There he had the opportunity of\r\nhearing a travelling violoncellist, whose performances so inspired him\r\nthat he forthwith resolved to devote himself to cello playing, with\r\nwhich until then he had never occupied himself. He was his own master.\r\nAfter two years of energetic work, Schönebeck went as cellist into the\r\nprivate band of a Count Dohna, though he only remained in it until\r\n1780, preferring to undertake a post which was offered to him as town\r\nmusician at Sorau. A journey to Berlin procured him the possibility of\r\nhearing the violoncello virtuoso Duport, at Potsdam, which incited him\r\nto renewed study. Soon after he made, at Dresden, the acquaintance of\r\nthe French cellist Tricklir,[80] whose playing gave him fresh impulse.\r\nFrom that time Schönebeck led a restless, wandering life, which\r\nprevented his attaining to the concentration of his powers. At short\r\nintervals he filled, one after the other, positions at the Court of the\r\nDuke of Courland, at Sagan; with Count Truchsez, at Waldenberg; and\r\nstill further at Königsberg. At length, wearied with a musical life,\r\nhe returned home and devoted himself to husbandry, but did not long\r\npersevere with this, and resumed again his artistic career. In the year\r\n1800 he performed at Leipsic, where his pleasing cello compositions,\r\nand his playing “with a fine intonation, and rare finish,” met with\r\napplause, as Gerber remarks.\r\n\r\nJOH. GEORG RAUPPE, born in July, 1762, at Stettin, devoted himself in\r\nearly youth to cello playing, and under the elder Duport attained to the\r\nrank of a master. His studies ended, he travelled through North Germany\r\nas well as Denmark and Sweden. In the year 1786 he betook himself to\r\nAmsterdam, and there fulfilled the duties of first cellist in the German\r\nOpera as well as at concerts. While in that position he died on June 15,\r\n1814. His playing was famed for the beauty and power of his tone, as\r\nwell as for readiness and purity of rendering.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN FRIEDRICH BAUERSACHS, born on June 4, 1767, at Pegnitz,\r\nin the principality of Anspach, was not only unusually clever on\r\nthe violoncello, but also played the basset-horn with great skill.\r\nHe travelled through Hungary and Italy, and then also in Germany,\r\ngiving concerts with good success. Yet he did not succeed in gaining a\r\npermanent post. He therefore gave up music as a means of livelihood, and\r\ndevoted himself to a miner’s career. On December 14, 1845, he died at\r\nSömmerda.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALEXANDER, who, in 1800, lived at Duisburg, and worked there, is\r\nworthy of mention on account of two books of Studies, which however are\r\nlong since obsolete. They consist of a violoncello school, published\r\nin 1801, and of an “Air avec xxxvi Variations progressives pour le\r\nVioloncelle avec le doigté en différentes clefs, accomp. d’un violon et\r\nd’une basse” (1802).\r\n\r\nJOHANN GOTTFRIED ARNOLD, born on February 1, 1773, in the Würtemburg\r\ntown of Niedernhall, died July 26, 1806, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, was\r\nthe son of a school teacher. He early applied himself to music, and\r\nchiefly to the violoncello, so that at eight years of age he attracted\r\nnotice by his performances. In 1785 his father placed him under the\r\ntuition of Lüngelsauer, the town musician, with whom he studied for\r\nfive years. At the expiration of that time Arnold found employment with\r\nhis uncle, who was Court and town musician at Wertheim. During this\r\nperiod he pursued, alone, with great zeal, his cello studies, but at\r\nthe same time did not neglect theoretical study. After some fruitless\r\nattempts to make himself known as a soloist beyond his native place,\r\nhe visited Regensburg, where just then the violoncellist Max Willman,\r\nmentioned above, was residing. He gave Arnold, during some few months,\r\ninstructions on the cello, the first which he had received on this\r\ninstrument. In the year 1796 he had the opportunity, in Hamburg, of\r\nhearing Bernhard Romberg and learning from him. Very soon after Arnold\r\nwas established in the theatre orchestra at Frankfort. At the same time\r\nhe gave private lessons. He was esteemed by his contemporaries as a\r\ngreat violoncello virtuoso, whose playing, on account of its “enchanting\r\ntone,” was excellent, not only in _Allegro_, but also in _Adagio_\r\npassages. Amongst the German violoncellists of the last century an\r\namateur deserves mention, who so distinguished himself, that he may\r\nproperly be counted among the artists of his instrument. It was the\r\nPRINCE CHRISTIAN VON WITTGENSTEIN-BERLEBERG. He was born on December 12,\r\n1753, and in his youth occupied himself eagerly with singing and clavier\r\nplaying. In more advanced years he learnt the violoncello and succeeded\r\nso well that he was heard with the greatest applause publicly at a\r\nconcert in Wetzlar. He maintained towards the end of his life a private\r\nband. This patron of art died October 4, 1800.\r\n\r\nThese distinguished men up to this period, with few exceptions,\r\nendeavoured, besides their practical work, to create by their\r\ncompositions a literature for their instrument. They wrote concertos,\r\nsonatas, and works with variations, in considerable numbers.[81] These\r\nproductions were substantially increased by other musicians who were not\r\ncello players.\r\n\r\nBefore all, the most prominent are PHIL. EMANUEL BACH and JOSEPH HAYDN.\r\n\r\nThe former composed a Violoncello Concerto, the latter several pieces\r\nof the same kind. What a lively interest Haydn, especially, took in\r\nthe violoncello is proved by the fact that he used it as an obbligato\r\nin two of his Symphonies. The first of them (B flat major) appears\r\nwith the title, “Symphonie Concertante à Violon, Violoncell, Flutte,\r\nHautbois et Basson obligés,” as Op. 81; the other, called “le Midi,”\r\nwas written in 1761.[82] Therein the violoncello is employed as a solo\r\ninstrument, chiefly in the _Adagio_, the close of which ends with an\r\nelaborate cadenza for violin and violoncello. The cello part in the\r\nabove-mentioned “Sinfonie Concertante” contains striking difficulties,\r\nespecially where it is employed in the higher tones.[83]\r\n\r\nAmongst other composers of that period who composed Concertos for the\r\nvioloncello, we will only mention PAUL WRANITZKY, IGNAZ PLEYEL, FRANZ\r\nANTON HOFMEISTER, FRANZ CHRISTIAN NEUBAUER, LEOPOLD HOFFMANN, and JOHANN\r\nLUDWIG WILLING. There were also amateurs who attempted compositions\r\nof this kind, such as ERNST LUDWIG GERBER, the author of “The\r\nHistorical-Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,” and CHRISTIAN FERD.\r\nDANIEL SCHUBART, who, though he had a musical education, was however\r\nreally by vocation an author. Further Joh. Geog. Albrechtsberger, Joseph\r\nEybler, F. A. Hoffmeister, C. G. Neubauer, Ignaz Pleyel produced Duets\r\nfor two violoncellos, violin and cello, or for viola and violoncello.\r\nThere is also in existence a Cello Sonata with unfigured Bass by the\r\ncontrabassist Christian Spurni (Spourni), who, born in Mannheim, was,\r\nduring the years 1763-1770, member of the orchestra of the Italian Opera\r\nin Paris, and then of Her Majesty’s in London.[84]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of these compositions, whether emanating from\r\nvioloncello players or not, are interesting only in so far as from\r\nthem may be gathered what position German violoncello playing held\r\nin the second half of the last century. We have now only to state\r\nthat the technique at the end of the period mentioned had made great\r\nprogress, and that Germany, as compared with Italy, even taking into\r\nconsideration certain cello pieces by Boccherini, was not behindhand. A\r\nuniversally current method for the manipulation of the fingerboard and\r\nalso for bowing had indeed not yet been attained in either of the two\r\ncountries. The testing in every way of the executive capabilities of\r\nthe violoncello naturally followed, as well as discovering the various\r\ncombinations for playing double stops, the formation of passages and\r\nornaments, and the endeavour to develop and present them in a manner\r\nsuitable to the nature of the instrument. This tedious work must on the\r\noutset have necessarily led to productions in which the question of\r\nimagination would not be taken into consideration. In fact, it is with\r\nfew exceptions of very little value, and as further the figures and\r\nruns are antiquated, the compositions in question can awaken no real\r\nsympathy. But these trial stages which cello composition had to pass\r\nthrough were necessary in order to arrive at a literature of artistic\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] Fétis mentions him as a mediocre composer. He was born at Perpignan\r\nin 1691, and died in Paris in 1765.\r\n\r\n[73] The sketch of Schetky contained in Forster’s “History of the\r\nViolin,” deviates substantially from Gerber’s information, which I have\r\nfollowed. Forster says that this artist studied jurisprudence at Jena\r\nand, under Frederick the Great, followed as a volunteer the forces\r\ncommanded by Blucher in the seven years’ war. Then he also mentions his\r\nbeing a pupil of Philip Em. Bach. Whether this statement have any real\r\nfoundation, and to what extent, must remain undetermined.\r\n\r\n[74] Gerber gives 1745 as the year of Jäger’s birth, and Lauterbach in\r\nUpper Hesse as the place.\r\n\r\n[75] Ed. Hanslick: “History of Concert Life in Vienna,” p. 115.\r\n\r\n[76] See p. 72.\r\n\r\n[77] See p. 28.\r\n\r\n[78] Concerning the brothers Duport, see the following section.\r\n\r\n[79] According to Fétis. Gerber says in his “Dictionary of Musicians”\r\nthat, about the year 1755, a cellist, by name VIRGIL MICHEL, belonged\r\nto the orchestra at Munich. Apparently he is identical with the one\r\nmentioned by Fétis.\r\n\r\n[80] See the next section.\r\n\r\n[81] Fétis has mentioned the greater number of these compositions in the\r\nrespective articles of his “Biographie Universelle des Musiciens.”\r\n\r\n[82] It is to be found in Carl Bank’s recently published Haydn\r\nSymphonies in score. Compare also Pohl’s “Haydn Biography,” I., 229 and\r\n285.\r\n\r\n[83] Recently has come out a Duet (D major) in three movements for\r\nviolin and violoncello, by J. Haydn, which he must have composed\r\nduring his residence in London for a certain William Forster. These\r\ncompositions recall, not only in respect of form, Tartini’s manner, so\r\nthat one is induced to look upon them as Haydn’s early work, which he\r\nwrote down from memory as a recollection.\r\n\r\n[84] This has already been mentioned. Page 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the first noteworthy French violoncellists the brothers ABBÉ\r\nmust be mentioned. They were music masters of the parish church of Agen\r\nunder their own names of Philipp Pierre and Pierre de Saint Sevin. As\r\nsuch, in conformity with the regulation of that time, they had to wear\r\nthe “collet” of the Catholic priests over their dress, on account of\r\nwhich they were called shortly Abbé, or l’Abbé. They retained this name,\r\nwith the addition of “l’Aîné” and “Cadet,” after they had given up their\r\nposts in Agen and had entered the Paris Opera Orchestra as cellists in\r\n1727.[85] This is all that is known about them.\r\n\r\nThere is more information extant concerning BERTEAU.[86] This artist,\r\nborn at the beginning of the eighteenth century at Valenciennes, was\r\nesteemed by his contemporaries as of eminent talent--indeed, as a\r\ngenius. In his youth he travelled through Germany, and during this time\r\nhe applied himself with vigour to gamba playing, under the direction\r\nof a Bohemian of the name of Kozecz, and acquired great proficiency.\r\nHowever, after he became acquainted with the superiority of the\r\nvioloncello, and had heard a solo piece for it by Franciscello,[87]\r\naccording to Fétis, he went over to that instrument. His progress was so\r\nremarkable that he was ever without a rival, and was looked upon as a\r\nwonder on his return to Paris, for he also performed unusually well on\r\nthe flageolet, the playing of which had been little developed. In the\r\nyear 1739 he was heard for the first time at the “Concert Spirituel”[88]\r\nin a solo of his own composition, and aroused great enthusiasm. The\r\nresult was a frequent appearance at these concerts. His chief strength\r\nlay in the production of an extraordinary richness of tone. He wrote\r\nfor the violoncello four Concertos as well as three Sonatas with bass\r\naccompaniment. His death took place in 1756. Berteau was looked upon as\r\nthe founder of the French school of violoncello playing. Fétis asserts\r\nas a proof of this that as pupils he educated CUPIS, JANSON, TILLIÈRE,\r\nand the elder of the brothers DUPORT, who were the propagators of his\r\nbeautiful tone as well as his melodious manner of rendering.\r\n\r\nJEAN BAPTIST CUPIS, born in 1741, in Paris, received his first lessons\r\nfrom his father, and in his eleventh year became Berteau’s pupil. Before\r\nhe had passed the second decade of his life he was already esteemed as\r\none of the cleverest cellists in France. He was soon received into the\r\nOpera Orchestra in Paris, and, indeed, with the distinction that he\r\nwas associated with those members of it who had to accompany the solo\r\nsingers.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1771 he gave up his connection with the opera in order\r\nto undertake some concert tours. He visited a great part of Germany,\r\nremained some time in Hamburg, and then went to Paris and Italy, where\r\nhe married the songstress Gasparini. In 1794 he was in Milan. From\r\nthat time nothing more is known about him. The requisite information\r\nconcerning his pupils, Jean Henri Levasseur and Bréval, will be given\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nCupis composed two Concertos and a couple of pieces with variations, of\r\nwhich the second, for two violoncellos, appeared only as a “Posthumous\r\nwork” after his death. Besides these, he wrote a violoncello school. It\r\nbears the title “Méthode nouvelle et raisonnée pour apprendre à jour du\r\nvioloncelle, où l’on traite de son accord, de la manière de tenir cet\r\ninstrument avec aisance, de celle de tenir l’archet, de la position de\r\nla main sur la touche, du tact, de l’étendue du manche, de la manière de\r\ndoigter dans tous les tons majeurs et mineurs, etc. Paris, Boyer.”\r\n\r\nBerteau’s second pupil, JEAN BAPTISTE AIMÉ JOSEPH JANSON, was born\r\nat Valenciennes in 1742. At twenty-four he was heard for the first\r\ntime as solo-player at the “Concert Spirituel.” In 1767 he went as\r\naccompanist to the heir-apparent of Brunswick to Italy, and remained\r\nthere till 1771. He then returned for a few years to Paris, after which\r\nhe travelled in Germany. From Hamburg, where he remained until 1783,\r\nhe visited Denmark, Sweden, and Poland. He everywhere reaped great\r\napplause for his performances, which were distinguished for their broad\r\nand fine tone. In the year 1789 he again found himself in Paris. The\r\nvalue that was set upon his playing there is proved by his being offered\r\nthe post of teacher of the violoncello at the Conservatoire, which was\r\nfounded in the year 1795. He died September 2, 1803. Of his violoncello\r\ncompositions, Fétis mentions three Concertos (Op. 3), three Concertos\r\n(Op. 7), both with a bass; six Concertos with orchestra (Op. 15), and\r\nsix Sonatas with bass (Op. 4).\r\n\r\nJanson had a younger brother, whose Christian names were LOUIS AUGUSTE\r\nJOSEPH, whom he instructed as a skilful cellist, after his father had\r\nprepared him for it. In 1789 he was given a place in the Parisian\r\nOrchestra, which he held till 1815. He died a few years later. He was\r\nborn on July 8, 1749. He only published six Sonatas for the violoncello\r\nwith bass.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BONAVENTURE TILLIÈRE, of whom neither the day of birth nor death\r\nis known, was about 1760 in the service of the Prince de Conti, after\r\nhe had finished his studies under Berteau. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing a clever player. His published works consist of six Sonatas for\r\nvioloncello and bass, nine Duets for two violoncellos, of which three\r\nappeared as Op. 8, and also of a violoncello school, published in 1764:\r\n“Méthode pour le Violoncelle, contenant les principes nécessaires pour\r\nbien jouer de cet instrument.” This work appeared in several editions.\r\n\r\nBerteau’s best pupil was JEAN PIERRE DUPORT, called the elder,[89] whose\r\nfather was a dancing master. He was born in Paris, November 27, 1741.\r\nHe was heard at twenty years of age, with unanimous applause, in the\r\n“Concert Spirituel.” At the same time (1761) he was appointed one of the\r\nprivate musicians of the Prince de Conti. He gave up the post in 1769 in\r\norder to travel. He first went to England, two years later he visited\r\nSpain, and in 1773 he went to Berlin, where he remained, as Frederick\r\nthe Great engaged him for his chamber musician as well as for the opera.\r\nHe was at the same time teacher to the future King Frederick William\r\nII., who named him in 1787 superintendent of chamber music. From that\r\ntime Duport no longer worked in the Opera, but only played at Court. On\r\nDecember 31, 1818, he died at Berlin. Duport published, in 1787,[90] at\r\nBerlin, six Sonatas for violoncello and bass, as well as three Duets for\r\ntwo violoncellos, known as Op. 1.\r\n\r\nGerber, who had the opportunity of hearing this artist in 1793, in\r\nBerlin, gives an enthusiastic account of his playing. He especially\r\ncommended his strong, full tone, and his powerful bowing. According to\r\nFétis, however, his younger brother, JEAN LOUIS, surpassed him, and he\r\nseems to have been remarkably gifted. He had at first chosen the violin\r\nas his instrument, but took up by preference the violoncello, when he\r\nsaw the artistic success of his brother, whose pupil he became. He very\r\nsoon acquired considerable reputation by his appearance at the “Concert\r\nSpirituel” and at the “Société Olympique,” formerly known under the name\r\nof “Concerts des Amateurs”; and also by his connection with the house\r\nof Baron Bagge, so much frequented at that time by native and foreign\r\nartists of note.\r\n\r\nWhen Viotti came to Paris, either at the end of 1781 or the beginning\r\nof 1782, and Duport heard him, he took his characteristic style of\r\nplaying as his model, and his performances gained considerably thereby.\r\nHe undertook his first concert tour to London in company with the\r\nEnglish cellist, Crosdill, who was connected with him, and he there\r\nmet with a most animated reception. This journey kept him six months\r\naway from Paris. But he did not remain then long at home. The ominous\r\nevents which, in 1789, preceded the Revolution caused him, like a\r\ngreat many others, to fly from Paris. He betook himself to his brother\r\nin Berlin, where he soon found employment in the Royal orchestra, to\r\nwhich he was attached for seventeen years. During this time he had many\r\npupils, whose names unfortunately are unknown. His pupils of French\r\nnationality--Rousseau, Levasseur, and Platel--will be noticed later.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1806, so unfortunate for Prussia, obliged Duport to leave\r\nBerlin. He returned again to Paris. But during his long absence he had\r\nbeen forgotten, and he had to gain for himself another public.\r\n\r\nA single public appearance in the year 1807, in which he was supported\r\nby the assistance of the singer, Colbran, Rossini’s future wife, was\r\nsufficient for this. He could not, however, attain to any certain or\r\ndecided position again by reason of the entire change of circumstances\r\nlittle favourable to Art in Paris. This obliged him to enter the service\r\nof Charles IV. of Spain, who had been dispossessed by Bonaparte, and who\r\nwas then at Marseilles. But this connection came to an end in 1812, when\r\nCharles IV. went to Rome, and Duport consequently was obliged to return\r\nto Paris. He took part in three concerts, and in spite of his advanced\r\nage of sixty-five years, had so great a success that he was named solo\r\ncellist to the Emperor and teacher at the Conservatoire. He lost the\r\nlatter post on the re-organization of the above-named Institution in\r\nthe year 1816. He remained, however, in his position at Court, which\r\nmeantime had been changed from an imperial to a monarchical one. But\r\nonly three years after he succumbed to a liver attack, on September 7,\r\n1819. He was born on October 4, 1749.\r\n\r\nLouis Duport was the author of a tolerable number of cello compositions.\r\nThey consist of four books of Sonatas with bass accompaniment, three\r\nDuets for two violoncellos, and eight “Airs Variés” with orchestra or\r\nquartet accompaniment. Besides these he composed, in connection with\r\nBochsa, nine Nocturnes for harp and violoncello, a “Fantasie” for piano\r\nand violoncello in conjunction with Rigel, and a Romance with piano\r\naccompaniment. As his _chef d’œuvre_ must be distinguished: “Essai\r\nsur le doigter du violoncelle et la conduite de l’archet, dédie aux\r\nprofesseurs de violoncelle.” This comprehensive instruction book, for\r\nwhich the materials were collected by degrees during a long period of\r\nyears, was published by Duport during his residences in Berlin and\r\nPotsdam. In the preface he says: “I have treated with minute detail\r\nthe subject of double-stops, and this I have done for two reasons: the\r\nfirst is that until now nothing concerning them has been written,[91]\r\nand they are so important for a good player; the second, because they\r\nhave so often served me as an argument, for without an established\r\nmode of fingering, double notes are impossible. In the course of this\r\nwork things will be met with of which the performance is difficult,\r\nbut nothing will be presented which is really impracticable. I am not\r\nwriting a useless theory. I have put down no scales, no figures, no\r\npassages, no exercises, without having repeatedly tried them myself. I\r\ncaused them to be repeatedly played by my brother, who was formerly my\r\nmaster, and will ever remain so, as well as by the best of my pupils\r\nin Berlin and Potsdam. I am therefore thoroughly convinced that the\r\nwork contains nothing that may not with ease be clearly and distinctly\r\ncarried out, and what at first appears impracticable will be practicable\r\nfor those who will give themselves continuous trouble, and make a point\r\nof practising a regular course of fingering.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Duport devoted himself with the greatest care to\r\nthe working out of his book of instruction (which must be accounted\r\na violoncello school) in order to bring about distinctness in the\r\nfinger technique, not until then fully settled. For that time it was\r\na meritorious undertaking. A new edition of it, brought out by the\r\nvioloncellist, A. Lindner, is a proof that the work, in spite of its\r\nage, is not quite without value. It is only to be regretted that the\r\noriginal text has not throughout been faithfully adhered to, and that in\r\nparts it has been suppressed. The editor should have reproduced the work\r\nin its original form, and have enunciated his own dissenting opinions in\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nOf more value for our present purpose than Duport’s work just mentioned\r\nare his Twenty-one “Exercices,” which contain much that is worthy of\r\nconsideration and of acquisition. Duport left a son who, for a long\r\ntime, belonged to the orchestra at Lyons, but then opened a piano\r\nmanufactory in Paris. The splendid Stradivari cello, which he inherited\r\nfrom his father, he disposed of to the violoncello virtuoso, Franchomme,\r\nfor 25,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAmongst Duport’s pupils, FREDERICK ROUSSEAU, born January 11, 1755,\r\nat Versailles, must be mentioned. He was member of the Parisian Opera\r\nOrchestra in 1787. In 1812 he retired from his position and established\r\na music school in his native town. He was of special importance in the\r\nmusical life of Paris as having been one of the founders of the Concert\r\nInstitute of the “Rue de Cléry,” formerly so popular. Amongst his\r\ncompositions he published six “Duos concertants” (Op. 3 and 4) as well\r\nas a “Potpourri” for two violoncellos.\r\n\r\nTaking up the chronological thread from Berteau, we have next to mention\r\nthe cellist CHARLES HENRI BLAINVILLE, who was born in a village near\r\nTours, in the year 1711, and died in Paris, in 1769. The intimate\r\ncircumstances relating to his life are unknown. Only so far is certain,\r\nthat he enjoyed the protection of the Marquise de Villeroy, who received\r\nmusical instruction from him, and that apparently through the influence\r\nof this lady he obtained the position of a creditable “Maître de\r\nMusique” in Paris. Blainville published several theoretical works and a\r\nfew compositions, amongst them two Symphonies, but nothing for his own\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe cellist NOCHEZ, born between 1720 and 1730, is known as a pupil\r\nof Cervetto and Abaco.[92] In his early years he travelled in Italy\r\nand was then member of the comic opera in Paris, from which he went\r\nto the orchestra of the grand Opéra in 1749. In 1763 he received\r\nthe appointment of royal chamber musician. He died in 1800 after a\r\nyear spent in retirement. Nochez is the author of an article on the\r\nvioloncello which appeared in print in de La Borde’s “Essai sur la\r\nmusique ancienne et moderne” (Paris, 1780).\r\n\r\nConcerning the violoncellist EDOUARD, only the following notice is\r\nfound in Gerber: “A violoncellist living in Paris, in 1737, was an\r\nextraordinary artist on his instrument, and was much commended by\r\nTelemann” (Ehrenpforte, 367).\r\n\r\nCLAUDE DOMERGUE, born at Beaucaire in 1734, seems to have been\r\nremarkable among French violoncellists, although he never left his home.\r\nThat Duport, when he was travelling in the South of France, stopped at\r\nBeaucaire solely in order to make Domergue’s acquaintance is sufficient\r\nproof of his unusual skill in execution. During the disturbances of\r\nthe Revolution he unhappily ended his days, with thirty of his fellow\r\ncitizens, on the scaffold, in 1794.\r\n\r\nTo the Paris Opera orchestra belonged FRANÇOIS JOSEPH GIRAUD, the\r\nvioloncellist, from 1752-1767. Besides this he was chamber musician.\r\nHe wrote a volume of Sonatas for his instrument. Further, he occupied\r\nhimself with vocal composition, and also wrote for the stage.\r\n\r\nThe next to be mentioned is JEAN TRICKLIR, already named, of German\r\nextraction, born at Dijon in 1750, who passed only his youth in France.\r\nDestined by his parents for the church, he went to the seminary of his\r\nbirthplace. In his leisure hours he occupied himself with cello playing.\r\nHis partiality for it increased by degrees as he advanced in skill, and\r\nin his fifteenth year he embraced the resolution of devoting himself to\r\nthe art. For this object Tricklir went to Mannheim, where he remained\r\nseveral years and reached a master-pitch by zealous study under the\r\ndirection of experienced teachers. After he had been several times to\r\nItaly, he was received in March of the year 1783 as a member of the\r\nCourt band at Dresden, to which he belonged as a highly appreciated\r\nartist until his death on November 29, 1813. His published compositions\r\nconsist of seven Concertos and six Sonatas for violoncello. It must also\r\nbe noticed that Tricklir thought to have discovered by a “Microcosme\r\nMusical” a sure means of keeping stringed instruments continually in\r\neven, pure tune. It was, however, an illusion, and this imaginary\r\ninvention disappeared as quickly as it had originated.\r\n\r\nA remarkable scholar of Tricklir’s was DOMINIQUE BIDEAU, or BIDAUX,\r\nas he called himself in his violoncello school. He belonged to the\r\norchestra of the “Théâtre Italien” in Paris. His compositions in\r\nrelation to the violoncello are “Six duos pour Violon et Violoncelle”\r\n(Op. 1 and 2), Paris, 1796; “Trois grands divertissements concertants\r\npour violon et violoncelle,” “Un air ecossais varié avec quatuor,” “Deux\r\nduos faciles pour deux violoncelles,” and some other things of the same\r\nkind. The title of his violoncello school runs thus: “Grande et Nouvelle\r\nMéthode raisonnée pour le Violoncelle, composée par Dominique Bidaux.\r\nParis, 1802.”\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Bidaux, PIERRE FRANÇOIS OLIVIER AUBERT, born 1763 at\r\nAmiens, also brought out a violoncello method.[93] He received his\r\nfirst musical instruction in the “maîtrise” of his native town, but he\r\nlearned cello playing by himself, without any other assistance. After\r\nhis arrival in Paris, he found a place in the orchestra of the “Opéra\r\nComique,” to which he belonged for twenty-five years. His cello method\r\nwas, as Fétis remarks, the first good instruction book which followed\r\nafter the insufficient preparatory works by Cupis and Tillière.\r\n\r\nAubert wrote for his instrument twelve Duets in four parts, as Op. 3, 5,\r\n6, and 7; some Studies, besides three Sonatas, Op. 8; and lastly, eight\r\nSonatas.\r\n\r\nA second violoncellist of the same name, who was commonly called\r\nAUBERTI, worked in the orchestra of the Paris Commédie Italienne. He\r\ndied in the year 1805. Of his compositions six Solos for the violoncello\r\n(Op. 1) appeared, and six Duets for two violoncellos.\r\n\r\nF. CARDON was a member of the Paris Opera orchestra in the middle of the\r\nlast century. He educated his nephew, PIERRE CARDON, born in 1751, who\r\nat the same time studied singing under Richer. The latter seems to have\r\nbeen his chief occupation, since he became a singer in the Royal Chapel\r\nin 1788, and gave singing lessons. He was, however, also engaged as a\r\nteacher of cello playing.\r\n\r\nESPRIT AIMON, born at Lisle (Vaucluse), in 1754, is also distinguished\r\nas a clever violoncellist. He conducted for a long time the music of the\r\nDanish Minister, Count Rantzau; he then settled down in Marseilles. In\r\nthe year 1828 he died in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe cellist, PIERRE FRANÇOIS LEVASSEUR, born at Abbeville, in 1753,\r\nwas intended for the church, and received for that end a liberal\r\neducation. He decided, however, in the eighteenth year of his life for\r\nart. A certain Belleval directed for three months his practice on the\r\nvioloncello. This instruction, however, does not seem to have satisfied\r\nhim, for he preferred to be his own master. When he came to Paris, in\r\n1782, he received a few lessons from Duport the younger,[94] whose tone\r\nand style he adopted. In 1789 he played at the “Concert Spirituel” some\r\nof his master’s solo pieces, and later he appeared at the concerts of\r\nthe “Théâtre Feydeau.” From 1785-1815 he was a member of the Opera\r\norchestra. Soon after his retirement from this he died. The compositions\r\nwhich he published were twelve Duets for two violoncellos in two\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThere was another cellist, LEVASSEUR, about ten years younger, who\r\nsprang from another family so-called, and whose Christian name was JEAN\r\nHENRI. He seems to have been more remarkable than his namesake mentioned\r\nabove. He was born in 1765 in Paris, was a pupil of Cupis, and belonged\r\nconsequently to Berteau’s school. After he had pursued his studies with\r\nthe former artist, he profited for some time by the instruction of the\r\nyounger Duport. He was then received into the Paris Opera orchestra,\r\nto which he belonged as first violoncellist until 1823, the year\r\nof his death. He was also for some time active as a teacher at the\r\nConservatoire. He likewise had a place at the Court Music of Napoleon,\r\nand from 1814 in the Royal band. That he was amongst the first in rank\r\nwho belonged to the violoncello school of the Conservatoire, under the\r\ndirection of Baillot, is a proof of the repute in which he was held in\r\nParis. Of his own compositions, he only left a set of Sonatas with bass,\r\ntwo sets of Duets, and a volume of “Exercices.”\r\n\r\nLevasseur’s most prominent pupils were LAMARE and NORBLIN.\r\n\r\nJAQUES MICHEL HUREL DE LAMARE, born on May 1, 1772, in Paris, died on\r\nMarch 27, 1823, in the town of Caen, where he possessed some property,\r\nwas the son of poor parents and got his scientific as well as his\r\nartistic education together with the Pages of the Court Music. In his\r\nfifteenth year he began, under the direction of the younger Duport,\r\nvioloncello playing, for which he developed an extraordinary talent.\r\nBefore he had reached seventeen years of age, he left the Pages’\r\nInstitute and returned to his parents. In 1794 he found a place in the\r\norchestra of the Théâtre Feydeau. The then famous concerts of this\r\ninstitution gave him the wished-for opportunity of making himself known\r\nas a solo player. His excellent performances procured for him very soon\r\nthe reputation of first French violoncellist of his time. The Committee\r\nof the Paris Conservatoire hastened to secure him as a teacher. But\r\nhe desired to go out into the world, and at the beginning of 1801 he\r\nwent to Germany. At Berlin he was brought into intimate relations with\r\nPrince Louis Ferdinand, and played a great deal with him; as a mark of\r\ndistinction he presented him with a ring on condition that he would\r\nexchange it with one that Lamare himself wore. From Germany Lamare went\r\nto Russia. He lived there alternately at St. Petersburg and Moscow until\r\n1808. During this period he was not only soloist at the Imperial Court,\r\nbut was also active in giving concerts. On his return to France he\r\ntook the route through Poland and Austria. In April, 1809, he returned\r\nto Paris and soon organised a concert in the Odéon without, however,\r\nexciting in any way his audience, which determined him not to play\r\npublicly again. He only allowed himself to be heard in private circles,\r\nwhere great admiration for his playing was conceded to him. He must have\r\nbeen an excellent performer in ensemble and also in quartet playing. In\r\n1815 he married a lady of fortune. From that time he only pursued his\r\nart for pleasure. On March 27, 1823, he succumbed to an affection of the\r\nlarynx.\r\n\r\nLamare wrote nothing for his instrument. He was destitute of any gift of\r\nform. The compositions published in Paris under his name, consisting of\r\nfour violoncello Concertos, Duets, and an “Air varié” for violoncello,\r\noriginated probably from the opera composer Auber, who was an intimate\r\nfriend of Lamare. Of the Concertos, the one in A minor is the best.\r\n\r\nLOUIS PIERRE MARTIN NORBLIN was the son of the French painter, Norblin\r\nde la Gourdaine, of some repute in his time, who, in 1772, selected\r\nWarsaw as his permanent residence and there married a Polish lady.\r\nThe artist just now mentioned, born on December 2, 1781, was the\r\noffspring of this union. In 1798 he went to Paris for the sake of the\r\nConservatoire and was first Baudiot’s and then Levasseur’s pupil. In the\r\nyear XI., according to the reckoning of the French Republic--that is,\r\n1803--he received the first prize at a competition of the directors of\r\nthe above-named Institution for his performances in solo playing. Six\r\nyears later, 1809, he was appointed to the orchestra of the “Théâtre\r\nItalien,” and, in 1811, solo violoncellist in the orchestra of the Grand\r\nOpéra. In this position he remained until 1841. Besides this, he gave\r\ninstructions at the Conservatoire from January 1, 1826, as successor\r\nof his master, Levasseur; on June 5, 1846, he gave this up, in order\r\nto withdraw into private life. He died on July 14, 1854, at Château\r\nConnautre, in the Department of the Marne.\r\n\r\nNorblin was highly estimated, not only as a soloist, but also as\r\na delicate, tasteful quartet player. For many years he took the\r\nvioloncello parts in the Baillot String Quartets. He gained special\r\ndistinction from the musical world of Paris, for having assisted in\r\nthe foundation of the Conservatoire Concerts, called into existence by\r\nHabeneck, in 1828.\r\n\r\nHis son and pupil, EMILE, born April 2, 1821, was a skilful\r\nvioloncellist, who received the Conservatoire prize. He, however,\r\ndevoted himself more to teaching than solo playing.\r\n\r\nCupis’s pupil, JEAN BAPTISTE BRÉVAL, already mentioned, born, in 1756,\r\nin the Department of the Aisne, so quickly developed his talent that he\r\nwas able very early to appear at the “Concert Spirituel” with brilliant\r\nsuccess. He was a member of the Paris Opera orchestra from 1781 to 1806.\r\nIn 1796 followed his nomination as teacher of violoncello playing at the\r\nConservatoire. From this he was released in 1802, as the number of the\r\npupils at the Institution was not large enough to keep him employed.\r\nTowards the end of his life Bréval retired to Chamouille, a village in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Laon. He shortly after died there, at the end of\r\nthe year 1825.\r\n\r\nBréval published for the violoncello seven Concertos, five sets of\r\nDuets, three Sonatas with bass, and twelve “Airs variés.” Besides these\r\nhe wrote two Concertantes, Quartets, Trios, and an instruction book\r\nunder the title “Méthode raisonnée de Violoncelle,” which appeared in\r\nParis in 1804. His cello pieces were formerly much in request, but have\r\nbeen long obsolete. As a player Bréval had a finished style, but in his\r\nrendering lacked force and energy.\r\n\r\nOf similar kind is the verdict regarding the pupil of the elder Janson,\r\nCHARLES NICOLAS BAUDIOT, who was born on March 29, 1773, at Nancy, and\r\ndied in Paris on September 26, 1849. Fétis, who had heard him, says that\r\nhis rendering, though of great neatness and purity of tone, was cold and\r\nwithout spirit. It appears that he possessed an extraordinary talent\r\nfor teaching, for he was, in 1802, the successor of his master at the\r\nConservatoire, and worked there until the year 1822 when he accepted a\r\npension. He had an official post in the Treasury as well as his artistic\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 he was unfortunate in exciting the ridicule of an audience,\r\nat a concert given by the famous Catalani, in which he took part. The\r\noccasion was of a very harmless nature. In the said concert a Symphony\r\nof Haydn was played, and Baudiot had a solo to perform immediately\r\nafter. It was a “Fantaisie” on the _Andante_ of the German master’s\r\nSymphony which had just been executed, and of the performance of which\r\nthe soloist had no suspicion, as he entered the hall when his turn\r\ncame. Scarcely had Baudiot begun Haydn’s Theme when the public, who\r\nthought he wanted to have a joke, burst out into hearty laughter. The\r\nartist, who was at a loss to explain the demeanour of his audience,\r\nand ignorant of the connection of affairs, became excited and played\r\nout of tune, whereupon the laughter was repeated with renewed vigour.\r\nHaving lost his self-control, and being on the point of fainting, he\r\nleft the platform, supported by a fellow artist. Baudiot wrote for the\r\nvioloncello two Concertos and two Concertinos, as well as a great number\r\nof other compositions, consisting of Duets, Potpourris, Fantaisies,\r\nNocturnes, Sonatas, with bass accompaniment, and transcribed besides\r\nviolin pieces by Lafont and Beriot. He was also the author of a method\r\nfor his instrument, and under the direction of Baillot, and with the\r\nco-operation of Levasseur, he took part also in the production of a\r\nvioloncello method for use in the Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nOf Baudiot’s pupils, SCIPION ROUSSELOT, born at the beginning of our\r\ncentury, deserves notice. During his attendance at the Conservatoire, he\r\nreceived also instruction in composition from Reicha. At the completion\r\nof his studies the first prize was allotted to him (1823). Rousselot\r\nwent later on to England. Besides several chamber music compositions\r\nand a Symphony, there appeared by him three Sonatinas, some books of\r\nVariations, and a “Morceau de Salon” for violoncello.\r\n\r\nA fellow student of Baudiot’s, under Janson the elder, was PIERRE\r\nLOUIS HUS-DESFORGES, grandson of the violin virtuoso, Jarnowick.\r\nHus-Desforges was born at Toulon in 1773, where his mother, Jarnowick’s\r\ndaughter, was performing as an actress. At the age of eight his parents\r\nconfided him to the boys’ choir of the Cathedral at La Rochelle. As he\r\nhad occupied his leisure hours with trumpet blowing, he accepted the\r\nduty of trumpeter (1792) to the 14th Regiment in order to join in the\r\ncampaigns of the Revolutionary Army. Four years after he lost a finger\r\nof his right hand by a musket ball and was consequently invalided. He\r\nnow tried his fortune as cellist, for during his sojourn at La Rochelle\r\nhe had acquired some facility on the violoncello. He succeeded in being\r\nappointed to the theatre orchestra. In the course of six months he\r\nrelinquished this and chose Paris as his residence. Here he was received\r\ninto the Conservatoire and assigned to the pupils of Janson. After his\r\nrelease from the Conservatoire, Hus-Desforges led, like his grandfather\r\nJarnowick, a perpetually changing life. In the year 1800 he went as head\r\nof the orchestra with a French opera troupe to St. Petersburg, in 1810\r\nhe returned and made some concert tours in France, in 1817 came back to\r\nParis and undertook the functions of first cellist at the Theatre “Porte\r\nSaint Martin,” in 1820 went to Metz and founded there a music school,\r\nmade fresh journeys, and in 1828 was the head of the orchestra at the\r\n“Théâtre du Gymnase,” but at the end of a year asked for his dismissal.\r\nHe did the same again when in 1831 he had succeeded in obtaining the\r\noffice of Director of the orchestra at the Theatre of the Palais\r\nRoyal. He spent the end of his chequered career in the little town of\r\nPont-le-Roi, near Blois, as teacher at the music school there, where he\r\ndied January 20, 1838.\r\n\r\nHus-Desforges was a clever, skilful violoncellist, but he did not belong\r\nto the number of prominent, practised artists of his time. His tone was\r\nweak and his performances lacked force and brilliancy, as Fétis remarks.\r\nHis violoncello compositions, which were formerly somewhat liked,\r\nconsisted of four Concertos and nine Airs with variations, entitled\r\n“Soirées Musicales,” four Duets, and two Sonatas with bass. Besides\r\nthese he wrote a violoncello method.\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance to the art of violoncello playing was Duport\r\nthe younger’s pupil, NICOLAS JOSEPH PLATEL, who was born in the year\r\n1777 at Versailles, and received his first musical instruction in the\r\nInstitution of royal pages. There was then no attempt at violoncello\r\nplaying, but about the tenth year of the boy’s age the inclination\r\nfor it was developed. Louis Duport, who discerned a disposition\r\nfavourable to it, devoted himself with special zeal to his training.\r\nThese relations were broken off, when Duport, at the end of 1789, left\r\nFrance in order to seek a position in Berlin. From that period Platel\r\nwas thrown for a long time upon his own resources. In the year 1793 he\r\nwas drawn into close relations with Lamare, who sought in every way to\r\nforward him. In 1796 Platel became a member of the orchestra of the\r\n“Théâtre Feydeau.” He was deprived of his post on account of a love\r\naffair with an actress of that institution, with whom he went to Lyons\r\nat the end of 1797. When he returned to Paris in 1801, he appeared\r\nseveral times at concerts with great success. He was then reputed the\r\nbest violoncellist in Paris, and the absence of Duport and Lamare abroad\r\nstood him in good stead.\r\n\r\nPlatel might now have made his fortune in the French capital. However,\r\non account of the carelessness of his disposition and his unpractical\r\nnature, he knew not how to turn his opportunities to advantage. In 1805\r\nhe left Paris in order to undertake a concert tour, but at Quimper,\r\nwhere he made the acquaintance of a cello playing dilettante, he\r\nremained quite two years. He then finally came to the resolution of\r\nagain beginning his wanderings. When he had appeared in concerts at\r\nBrest and Nantes with great success, he went North with the intention of\r\nvisiting Holland and thence Germany. This plan, however, was not carried\r\nout. Platel settled himself down, on the way to the former place, at\r\nGhent, remained there giving lessons several years, and then went to\r\nAntwerp. An opera troupe was there at the time who engaged him as first\r\nvioloncellist. About six years later he undertook the same function\r\nin the theatre at Brussels. This was the turning-point which decided\r\nPlatel’s destiny. The Prince of Chimay engaged him for the Royal Music\r\nSchool of the Belgian Court, which was opened in 1831. By accepting this\r\noffice, to which he devoted himself until his death on August 25, 1835,\r\nhe became the founder of the Belgium school of violoncello playing, from\r\nwhich emanated, under his direction, such artists as Batta, Demunck, and\r\nServais.\r\n\r\nPlatel’s compositions consist of five Concertos, of which the last is\r\nentitled “Le Quart d’heure,” also of three books of Sonatas with bass\r\naccompaniment, and eight “Airs Variés” of “Caprices ou Préludes,” and\r\nsix Romances with piano accompaniment. Besides these he wrote six Duets\r\nfor violoncello and violin, and three Trios for violin, viola, and\r\nvioloncello.\r\n\r\nWe must mention here three French cellists of the second half of last\r\ncentury, whose master is not known--namely, Chrétien, Haillot, and\r\nRaoul.\r\n\r\nGILLES LOUIS CHRÉTIEN, born in 1754 at Versailles, and died in Paris,\r\nMarch 4, 1811, at the age of twenty-two found a position as Royal band\r\nmusician. He possessed great readiness and a good tone, though he\r\nplayed without expression. He lost his place by the Revolution, but was\r\nindemnified in 1807 by being received into the Imperial orchestra. He\r\ndoes not seem to have occupied himself with composition, but as a writer\r\non music, though without much success.\r\n\r\nHAILLOT belonged to the orchestra of the “Comédie Italienne,” and was\r\nalso engaged in private teaching. By his arrangements of operas in the\r\nform of duets he supplied the wants of amateur cello players.\r\n\r\nFinally, JEAN MARIE RAOUL, an enthusiastic friend of art--who besides\r\nhis official position as crown lawyer and, later, as Justice at the\r\nParis Cour de Cassation, cultivated zealously the violoncello, on which\r\nhe distinguished himself--must be mentioned in this place as the author\r\nof a violoncello school. It appeared under the title of “Méthode de\r\nvioloncelle, contenant une nouvelle exposition des principes de cet\r\ninstrument.” Raoul composed also some Sonatas and “Airs variés” for\r\nhis favourite instrument. His efforts, supported by Vuillaume, the\r\nwell-known Parisian violin maker, to restore the gamba to practical use\r\nwere in vain. Raoul was born in Paris, in 1766, and died there in 1837.\r\n\r\nWhen we survey the progressive development of violoncello playing\r\nfrom its commencement to the close of the eighteenth century under\r\nall aspects, the following facts are presented to us: violoncello\r\nplaying was taken up, as we saw, in the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and even before, by the Italians. It was at first used only\r\nas an orchestral instrument and as a harmonised accompaniment of\r\nrecitative singing in the place of the gamba. But in the second half of\r\nthe seventeenth century there were some Italian artists, as GABRIELI,\r\nARIOSTI, and BONONCINI, who endeavoured to elevate the violoncello to\r\nthe rank of a solo instrument. Then appeared FRANCISCELLO, who worked\r\nwith uncommon success to the same end. By the last three named artists\r\nvioloncello playing was presented to the German nation with the idea of\r\nartistically treating it, while in France Giov. Battista Struck, called\r\nBaptistin, exercised an influence in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn both these countries this new branch of Art soon received a great\r\nimpulse by means of native talent. The Germans brought to it more\r\nthat was empiric, the French what was methodic--consequently at the\r\nbeginning, it must be acknowledged, the latter gained a certain\r\nadvantage. It is very noteworthy that they made great efforts to arrange\r\nsystematically and establish the technique of violoncello playing\r\nby instruction books and methods, and Corrette led the way with his\r\nvioloncello school, published in 1741, which was followed in the course\r\nof the second half of the last century by similar works by Tillière,\r\nCupis, and Müntzberger.[95] In Italy and Germany, as far as one can\r\nsee, the first attempts at instruction books for the violoncello were\r\ninitiated after Corrette and Tillière had published their Schools.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the laudable efforts which were made, especially in\r\nFrance, to establish the science of cello playing on a sure and suitable\r\nbasis, it made very slow progress. A substantial hindrance existed\r\nfrom the circumstance that the method of violin playing, which, at the\r\ntime, had already reached a high state of cultivation, had been in a\r\nmeasure used as a model without taking into consideration the important\r\ndifference in the dimensions of the fingerboard in the two instruments.\r\nNot only had the fingering of the diatonic and chromatic scales, but\r\nalso the principles of the so-called positions, been transferred from\r\nthe violin to the violoncello. With reference to the first point,\r\nthe necessary directions were given by description in the Method of\r\nCorrette. As to the latter point it must be observed that for the\r\nlower portion of the fingerboard four different positions were adopted\r\nanalogous to the technique of the violin. To this position-theory,\r\nwhich has come down to the present time and is treated of in some of\r\nthe old as well as the new violoncello schools, no special authority,\r\nstrictly speaking, should be attached.[96] For the violin it has to a\r\ncertain extent a meaning, as on that instrument it is possible to play a\r\ncomplete scale on all parts of the fingerboard without moving the hand.\r\nOn account of its wider dimensions the violoncello admits of this only\r\nby the help of the thumb position, with the exception of the C major\r\nscale by using the open strings. But even here, where an indication\r\nof position would be applicable, it is not usual. Evidently there is\r\nsomething inconsistent in this.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular conjuncture with regard to finger technique in the\r\nuse of the thumb, as we have already seen from Corrette’s violoncello\r\nschool. The fourth finger was excluded from co-operation as soon as the\r\nuse of the thumb was introduced, because it was thought that it was\r\ntoo short. This view of it prevailed up to the end of last century. In\r\nthe method published by the Belgian violoncellist, Müntzberger, it is\r\nliterally said: “When the fourth position has been passed over, only\r\nthree fingers are used.” Later indeed, where Müntzberger speaks of the\r\nuse of the thumb, he somewhat modifies this rule, since he remarks:\r\n“Many professors, when using the thumb, do not need the fourth finger.\r\nI am of opinion that its use should not be rejected, in that he, who by\r\nnature is endowed with a long finger, can make it available in certain\r\ncases.”\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases, therefore, Müntzberger advocated the use of the\r\nlittle finger when playing with the assistance of the thumb. But it is\r\nevident from his expression that the use of it was not usual at the\r\nend of the last century. This is undoubtedly to be gathered from the\r\n“Méthode de Violoncelle,” published conjointly by Baillot, Levasseur,\r\nCatel, and Baudiot. In it is the following observation: “The use of\r\nthe fourth finger in the different positions of the thumb was not\r\nknown to the older violoncello teachers of France. It has only been\r\nintroduced a few years, since the necessity for it has been felt.” As\r\nthis violoncello school was in 1804 accepted as an instruction book\r\nfor the Conservatoire by a resolution of the General Committee, it\r\nis clearly evident that in France at least the fourth finger had for\r\nthe most part remained unused until shortly before the close of the\r\nlast century. The cause of this was plainly an incorrect manipulation.\r\nConcerning the practice pursued in Germany during the second half of the\r\nlast century with regard to the fourth finger, Joh. Bap. Baumgartner’s\r\nTutor, mentioned page 69, would alone be able to give an explanation, if\r\nit were still extant. With some probability, however, it may be assumed\r\nthat the same opinion was held in reference to it as on the other side\r\nof the Rhine. The influence of France on German violoncello playing in\r\nthe second half of the last century made itself felt in other ways. This\r\nwas chiefly through the means of the brothers Duport. The succeeding\r\nsections will show in what way the further cultivation of this branch of\r\nthe art progressed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Compare with p. 52 of this book.\r\n\r\n[86] His name was written in various ways--viz., Bertaut, Bertault,\r\nBertaud, and Berthaud. The above is the right way.\r\n\r\n[87] Franciscello must accordingly have written for the cello.\r\n\r\n[88] The “Concert Spirituel,” which was the oldest concert institution\r\nof the French capital, was founded in the year 1725.\r\n\r\n[89] Compare pp. 77 and 83 of this book.\r\n\r\n[90] Fétis says 1788. The title-page, however, of this Sonata bears the\r\ndate 1787, by the engraver’s own hand.\r\n\r\n[91] This must not be taken word for word, for Corrette, in his\r\nvioloncello school, gives directions with regard to double stopping,\r\nthough very insufficient.\r\n\r\n[92] See pp. 51 and 54 this book.\r\n\r\n[93] Fétis says that Aubert published “deux méthodes de violoncelle,”\r\nbut immediately after speaks of one “livre élémentaire” of the same\r\nauthor, so that it may easily be concluded the first assertion was an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n[94] Fétis says from the elder Duport. This is, however, impossible as\r\nhe had already settled in Berlin, in 1773, from which place he did not\r\nagain absent himself.\r\n\r\n[95] Tillière’s violoncello school appeared in 1764, and those of Cupis\r\nand Müntzberger, to all appearance, came out before 1800.\r\n\r\n[96] Here is an example or two: Alexander in his cello school, which\r\nappeared in 1801, takes up quite arbitrarily an “ordinary,” a “half,”\r\nand a “whole,” as well as a “mixed” THEORY OF FINGERING, and Fr. Kummer\r\ndivides the fingerboard into “whole” and “half” positions. Müntzberger\r\nsays in his cello school, which appeared apparently in 1800, he wished\r\nthat people could accustom themselves to say to the pupil as for\r\nthe violin: “take this or that position.” Here is given a distinct\r\nindication of the application of the violin positions. In other cello\r\nschools, on the contrary, there is no reference to positions.\r\n\r\nDuport, however, makes use of positions 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, &c.,\r\nthroughout his volume.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE\r\n    ART OF VIOLONCELLO PLAYING\r\n    IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important epoch of Italian violoncello playing came to a close\r\nwith Boccherini. His early withdrawal from his native land caused a loss\r\nall the more sensibly felt because there was no one of equal importance\r\nto compensate for him in the further development of the art, from the\r\npoint to which he had attained both in its executive and productive\r\naspect. This task fell principally to Germans, French, and Belgians,\r\nwhilst Italy was deprived of the position of pre-eminence in regard to\r\nvioloncello playing which she is asserted to have held for a long time\r\nin the previous century. The same phenomenon consequently was repeated\r\nhere as in regard to violin playing.\r\n\r\nAlready towards the end of the eighteenth century Art, and especially\r\ninstrumental music, in which the Italians had accomplished so much that\r\nwas praiseworthy, fell into decline on the Apennine Peninsula--although\r\nItaly brought out some important productions, particularly in the\r\ndepartment of opera compositions. The Musical Almanack for Germany, of\r\n1783, contains the correspondence of an anonymous German artist who\r\ntravelled in Italy in the year 1782. It is there said: “At Naples I\r\nfound in the Conservatoire[97] a veritable horror. Caffaro[98] is here\r\nwith Milico, whose music gave me the most pleasure. As for the rest it\r\nis all miserable, heavy, modern Italian opera music, as well as in the\r\nchurches. I hoped to find a great deal at Venice, but it is no better\r\nthere. Above all, the execution in the whole of Italy is less good than\r\nformerly.... But what astonishes me most is the extraordinarily little\r\nappreciation of music in Italy now. It is almost a miracle to see people\r\nof position who have a love of music. It created a great sensation when\r\nwe gave concerts in Rome which were frequented by sincere admirers and\r\nfriends. Instrumental music is at such a low ebb that it is almost\r\nbeneath any criticism.”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century things were not changed in this\r\nrespect. Louis Spohr, who was in Italy in 1816, expresses himself in his\r\nautobiography concerning the condition of music there much in the same\r\nmanner as the anonymous writer cited above, and, a little later, Felix\r\nMendelssohn Bartholdy likewise.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions it cannot excite surprise if Italy in consequence\r\ndid not produce so many representatives of violoncello playing in the\r\nhighest sense of the word as hitherto.\r\n\r\nLUIGI VENZANO must be mentioned as one of the first distinguished\r\nItalian cellists of this century. He was born in Genoa about 1815, and\r\nwas solo cellist in the orchestra of the Theatre Carlo Felice, as well\r\nas teacher at the musical institute of his native town. He died on\r\nJanuary 27, 1878. As a composer he devoted himself to vocal and stage\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nAn incomparably more important player than the preceding artist, or his\r\ncountrymen to be subsequently mentioned, is ALFREDO PIATTI, born at\r\nBergamo on January 8, 1822, and not in 1823, as Fétis says. His father,\r\nwho died on February 27, 1878, and who early instructed him in music,\r\nwas not a singer but a violin player.[99] The boy soon decided for the\r\nvioloncello, on which he received his first lessons from his great\r\nuncle, Zanetti, who was engaged as music master at Bergamo.\r\n\r\nLater he was sent to Milan for the benefit of the Conservatoire. Here\r\nthe excellent violoncellist, Merighi, conducted his further education.\r\nPiatti attended the above-named Institution until September, 1837,\r\nafter having appeared previous to this date at one of the concerts with\r\ndecided success. In April, 1838, he gave a concert of his own in the\r\nTeatro della Scala, at Milan, with the profits of which he supplied\r\nhimself with the means of undertaking a concert tour. Soon after he\r\nwas heard very favourably at Venice and Vienna. In the latter town he\r\nremained some time; then he returned to Italy and gave concerts at\r\nMilan and Padua. In 1843 he went to Munich and joined in a concert\r\nwith Liszt there. In the following year he presented himself at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Maine, Berlin, Breslaw, and Dresden, when he afterwards\r\nvisited Paris. In 1845 he was in St. Petersburg, where his performances\r\nmet with unusual appreciation. Having returned to Milan, the post of\r\nteacher was offered to him, in 1846, at the Conservatoire. He did\r\nnot, however, accept the offer, but established himself in the same\r\nyear in the English capital, which from that time he has only left\r\noccasionally, either to undertake concerts or journeys to recruit his\r\nhealth. In London he soon became one of the most distinguished artistic\r\ncelebrities, and he still remains in full favour with the public. His\r\nperformances are proportionably marked by fine tone, the greatest\r\npurity, tasteful rendering, as well as by a perfect mastery of all\r\ntechnical difficulties. He is not only the most important cellist in\r\nEngland, but belongs altogether to the highest rank of artists of the\r\npresent time. He wrote for his instrument two Concertos (Op. 24 and 26),\r\na Concertino (Op. 18), a “Fantasia romantica,” Capriccios (Op. 22 and\r\n25), a “Sérénade Italienne” (Op. 17), “Airs Baskyrs” (Op. 8), as well\r\nas a long list of other works, consisting of Themes with variations and\r\ndrawing-room pieces of various kinds. Further he has brought out new\r\neditions of old cello compositions and six Sonatas by Boccherini. He has\r\nalso published original songs with violoncello obbligato.\r\n\r\nTwo other pupils of the Milan Conservatoire are GUGLIELMO QUARENGHI\r\nand ALESSANDRO PEZZE. The first, born on October 22, 1826, in Casal\r\nMaggiore, was pursuing his studies during the years 1839-1842. Arrived\r\nat maturity he was first violoncellist at the Teatro della Scala, at\r\nMilan, and from 1851 he gave instruction also at the Conservatoire to\r\nwhich he was indebted for his education. In February, 1879, he took the\r\nplace of Boucheron as Choirmaster at the Cathedral. He enjoyed this\r\nposition only a few years, for he died February 3 or 4, 1882. Amongst\r\nhis compositions the most noteworthy are--Six Capriccios, a “Chant\r\nelégiaque,” with piano accompaniment; two Romances, a Scherzo, “Un\r\npensiero al lago,” and some Fantasias on _Motifs_ from Italian operas.\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO PEZZE, born 1835, at Milan, received from his father, a\r\nclever dilettante, his first musical instruction, after which, in 1846,\r\nhe went to the Conservatoire of his native town. Merighi directed his\r\nvioloncello studies. After he had been for some time first cellist\r\nat the Teatro della Scala, he was engaged by the English impresario,\r\nLumley, for Her Majesty’s Theatre in London. Pezze belonged to it until\r\n1867, in which year the theatre was destroyed by fire. Later this artist\r\nwas employed in the orchestras of the Philharmonic Society and Covent\r\nGarden. He is still living in London.\r\n\r\nThe Naples Conservatoire produced GAETANO BRAGA, born on June 9, 1829,\r\nat Guilianuova in the Abruzzi. He was originally destined for the\r\nchurch, but the inclination for music came out so strongly that he\r\ncould not be kept back from it. His parents now wished that he should\r\nbe educated as a singer; he, however, decided for the violoncello, on\r\nwhich Gaetano Ciandelli directed his studies. He soon became a pupil of\r\nMercadante for composition. In the year 1852 he had finished his studies\r\nat the Conservatoire. Soon after he undertook a concert journey to the\r\nNorth of Italy, and from thence to Vienna, where he formed a connection\r\nwith Mayseder, and was a member of his String Quartet for a short time.\r\nIn 1855 he betook himself to Paris, where he was much in request as\r\na favourite solo player. He is at present living in Florence. As a\r\ncomposer Braga devoted himself by preference to stage compositions. For\r\nthe violoncello he only wrote a Concerto, and some smaller pieces with\r\npiano accompaniment, and a Serenade for voice with cello accompaniment.\r\n\r\nOther Italian violoncellists at the present time worthy of notice\r\nare--RONCHINI and G. MAGRINI in Milan, PINI in Venice, SERATO in\r\nBologna, TOSCANINI in Parma, SBOLCI and CASTAGNOLI in Florence, FURINO\r\nin Rome, CENTOLA in Naples, MONTECCHI (who lives at present at Rennes in\r\nBretagne as a music teacher), and MATTIOLI, now in Cincinnati.[100]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] In the last century there existed in Naples four Conservatoires.\r\nBut in 1806 they amalgamated into one musical Institute.\r\n\r\n[98] Caffaro, opera and church music composer, was Director of the\r\nNeapolitan Conservatoire della Pietá. Milico was then famous as a stage\r\nsinger.\r\n\r\n[99] See my work, “The Violin and its Masters.” 2nd Ed., 365.\r\n\r\n[100] In spite of every effort, I have not succeeded in gaining any more\r\ndetails concerning the above violoncellists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman violoncello playing had, during the second half of last century,\r\nfound unusual opportunities for expansion in consequence of the demand\r\nfor numberless competent artists for the various princely households,\r\nas well as for the larger towns. Amongst the cellists mentioned in the\r\nsecond part of this work, there were already some specially prominent\r\npersonages to distinguish. The branch of art, however, to which this\r\nbook is devoted first received a really important and sustained impulse\r\nthrough means of BERNHARD ROMBERG. This artist acquired for German\r\nvioloncello playing a significance similar to that which Louis Spohr\r\ngained for German violin playing, only with this difference--that the\r\nlatter master was far superior to the former as a composer. While\r\ncertain violin compositions of Spohr (not to speak of his other works),\r\non account of their intrinsic worth, are calculated to appear in concert\r\nprogrammes, and will presumably do so in the future, the cello pieces\r\nby Romberg have already for some time completely disappeared from them.\r\nYet they have, from a scholastic point of view, proved to be of value\r\neven to the present day. In regard to this, what Romberg did for the\r\ncultivation and perfecting, as well as the fine manipulation of his\r\ninstrument, merits for him the appellation of founder of the German\r\nschool of violoncello playing. His Concertos and concert pieces have\r\nbeen of more importance, however, for taking such a direction than his\r\nvioloncello school, which by no means belongs to the best instruction\r\nbooks of the kind, and is a proof that a man can be a distinguished\r\nteacher--and Romberg was in any case this--without having the capacity\r\nfor the production of a thoroughly satisfactory instruction book. The\r\nexamples and music pieces in Romberg’s violoncello school are indeed\r\nexcellent, but some of the maxims which he enunciates seem peculiar, and\r\nhe goes too much into extraneous matter, instead of bringing forward the\r\nmore substantial principles with the necessary precision and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Romberg advocated a simplified notation for\r\nvioloncello music. Primarily (besides the bass clef), in Italy and\r\nGermany, only the tenor clef was used, and the alto clef in France.\r\nBut as the compass of violoncello playing was more and more extended\r\nup to the high parts of the scale, by the use of the thumb positions,\r\nkeys used for the discant and violin were added. Boccherini, for the\r\nnotation of many of his compositions, made use altogether of five\r\nclefs, sometimes indeed in one and the same piece--as, for example,\r\nat the opening _Allegro_ of his Concerto (C major). There was nothing\r\narbitrary in this procedure. Boccherini had far more in view the object\r\nof giving to the player starting-points for the finger positions to be\r\nused in each case. In his later compositions, however, he abandoned\r\nthis, as the use of so many different clefs had its inconveniences; and\r\nhe restricted himself to the use of the bass, tenor, and violin clef.\r\nThis notation was subsequently generally accepted, particularly also by\r\nRomberg, and is still in use up to the present time. In opposition to\r\nthe earlier favourite manner of writing the notes--by the use of the\r\nviolin clef an octave too high for the violoncello, as is the case in\r\nMozart’s and Beethoven’s compositions--Boccherini, by the application of\r\nthe clefs mentioned, wrote everything as it would sound. By this means\r\nhe gained the advantage that he was not obliged to make so much use of\r\nledger lines in the writing of his passages--which were continually\r\nmoving in the soprano part--as he must have done if he had followed\r\nthe custom of his contemporaries and had adhered to the higher system\r\nof notation. It is readily understood why Romberg in his cello school\r\nshould declare himself in favour of the change introduced by Boccherini,\r\nfor he also, with special predilection, made use of the higher regions\r\nof the fingerboard for his playing; wherefore it was said of him that\r\nhis handling of the violoncello was often after the manner of the\r\nviolin. From this point of view it is thoroughly rational that Romberg,\r\nin regard to notation, should follow the example given by Boccherini. In\r\nlater times the too frequent and continuous use of the soprano clef--in\r\nwhich a broad, energetic volume of tone, full of expression, is nearly\r\nexcluded--has been abandoned without, however, being neglected entirely;\r\nwhile to the most beautiful and effective clef--namely, the tenor--has\r\nbeen accorded its right place.\r\n\r\nBERNHARD ROMBERG was the son of the bassoon player, Anton Romberg, of\r\nsome note in his time, and was born on November 11, 1767, in the village\r\nof Dinklage, near the little Prussian town of Quakenbrück. It is unknown\r\nwhom he had as teacher for the violoncello. It was probably an orchestra\r\nmusician in Münster, to which place his parents had removed their home.\r\nIn any case, Romberg’s talent caused him to make the most of it, for\r\nbefore he had passed his youth he was able to undertake with his cousin,\r\nAndreas Romberg,[101] who was about the same age, a concert tour which\r\nled them through Holland, and was extended to Paris, where they were\r\nboth heard with such success in the house of Baron Bagge[102] that they\r\nwere engaged in 1787 for the “Concert Spirituel.” After his return from\r\nParis Romberg devoted himself eagerly to progressive studies, and at the\r\nsame time worked in the orchestra at Münster.\r\n\r\nMünster belonged then, as is known, to the Electorate of Cologne. The\r\nElector Maximilian Franz, who on his accession to his dominions (April\r\n27, 1784) resided often in the Westphalian town, had his attention drawn\r\nto the two Romberg artists, and engaged them for his Royal band at Bonn.\r\nThe announcement of the appointment bears the date of December 19, 1790.\r\n\r\nWhen the Elector, in the autumn of the following year, went to reside\r\nat Mergentheim, then the seat of the German order--whose Grand Master\r\nhe was--he caused about twenty members of his band to follow him from\r\nBonn. Amongst them, besides Beethoven, who in addition to his office\r\nas organist was also tenor player at the Court, were also the two\r\nRombergs. In one of the musical entertainments which took place in the\r\napartments of the Elector, Bernhard Romberg was heard in a Concerto.\r\nBoszler’s Musical Correspondence of the year 1791 contains a notice\r\nof it in which is said[103]: “Romberg, the younger, combines in his\r\nvioloncello playing extraordinary rapidity with charming rendering;\r\nthis rendering is the more marked and decided when he is heard in\r\nconnection with the greater number of violoncellists. The tone which he\r\nproduces from his instrument is, moreover--especially in the expressive\r\nparts--extremely clear, firm, and penetrating. Taking into consideration\r\nthe difficulty of the instrument, a thoroughly marked purity of tone, in\r\nthe extraordinarily quick rendering of the _Allegro_, must be attributed\r\nto him in the highest degree. Yet this after all is mere mechanical\r\nreadiness; the connoisseur has another standard by which he measures the\r\ngreatness of artists; and this is, the manner of playing, the perfection\r\nof expression or the spiritual interpretation. Once on this point, the\r\nconnoisseur will pronounce in favour of the expressive _Adagio_. It\r\nis impossible more deeply to penetrate into the more delicate hues of\r\nfeeling--impossible to colour them with more variety--to enhance them,\r\nmoreover, by greater light and shade--impossible to hit more exactly\r\nthe very tones through which this feeling has utterance, tones which\r\nappeal more directly to the heart than Romberg succeeds in doing in his\r\n_Adagio_.”\r\n\r\n“How acquainted he is with all the beauties of detail, which lie in the\r\nnature of the piece in the peculiar kind of expression to be given, and\r\nfor which the composer has no signs for recognition? What effects he\r\nis able to produce by the _crescendo_ of his tone, swelling up to the\r\nstrongest _fortissimo_, and then again by its dying away to a scarcely\r\naudible _pianissimo_!!”\r\n\r\nFrom this enthusiastic announcement we must conclude that Romberg’s\r\nplaying at that time--he was in his twenty-fourth year--showed already\r\na high degree of perfection. It is therefore quite conceivable that he\r\ncherished the wish of obtaining a position in life adequate to the merit\r\nof his performances, for in Bonn he received only a yearly salary of 600\r\nflorins, and, moreover, the existence of the Cologne Electorate, the\r\ncomplete dissolution of which was accomplished in the autumn of the year\r\n1794, had fallen into a very doubtful condition from the time of the\r\nappearance of the revolutionary army on the Rhine (October, 1792).\r\n\r\nRomberg therefore accepted with his cousin, Andreas, at Easter, 1794,\r\nan engagement at the Schröder Theatre in Hamburg, but he did not long\r\nremain there. Three years later they undertook together a concert\r\njourney into Italy, gave concerts on their return at Vienna, supported\r\nby Beethoven, and again betook themselves to Hamburg, whence, after\r\na two years’ residence, Bernhard Romberg visited London. He next\r\ntravelled in Portugal and Spain, in 1800 returned again to Paris,\r\nand performed this time at the concerts of “La Rue de Cléry” and the\r\n“Théâtre des Victoires” with such great success that he became teacher\r\nat the Conservatoire. Romberg does not, however, appear to have felt\r\ncomfortable in this position, for after two years he withdrew from it\r\nand again turned to Hamburg. In 1805 he responded to an invitation\r\nto be solo cellist at the Berlin Hofcappelle. The calamities of war,\r\nwhich broke over Prussia in the following year, compelled him once more\r\nto become a wanderer. He next visited the Austrian States. After the\r\nconclusion of the peace of Tilsit, he found himself again in Berlin,\r\nremained there up to the year 1810, and then undertook a journey\r\nthrough Silesia, Poland, and Russia. At St. Petersburg he met with\r\nFerd. Ries, and in conjunction with him gave concerts in the Southern\r\nprovinces of the Czar’s dominions. The artists wished to arrange a\r\nvisit to Moscow, but were prevented by the memorable burning of the\r\nKremlin which compelled the French army to retreat. They then turned to\r\nStockholm, and from thence went to Copenhagen and Hamburg. Here they\r\nseparated--Ries went to London, which he reached in March, 1813, and\r\nRomberg took his way by Bremen to Holland and Belgium. From the latter\r\ncountry he again visited Paris for a short time. Returned to Germany,\r\nRomberg prepared for a second journey to Russia. On this occasion he\r\nlingered two years at Moscow. After he had been, from 1815-1819, in the\r\nservice of the Berlin Court, he chose Hamburg as his settled residence.\r\nWherever Romberg played his highly finished performances excited great\r\nenthusiasm. In this his violoncello compositions--which were entirely in\r\naccordance with the taste of that period in a virtuoso point of view,\r\nand which, moreover, were distinguished by their solid quality above all\r\nother cello compositions of the time--had a substantial share.\r\n\r\nDuring his many journeys through European countries, Romberg had\r\ncollected national airs, of which he availed himself in various ways\r\nfor his compositions under different names. Amongst them are to be\r\nfound Caprices on Swedish, Polish, Moldavian, Wallachian, and Spanish\r\nsongs, as well as a “Fantaisie” on Norwegian and a “Rondo brilliant”\r\non Polish melodies, besides four books of Variations on Russian\r\nnational airs. He further wrote ten Concertos, three Concertinos, a\r\nFantasia with orchestra, Polonaises, as well as Duets and Sonatas, with\r\nbass accompaniment for the cello. He was also very productive in the\r\nsphere of chamber music, and composed also for the stage. These last\r\ncompositions have, however, not survived him, while, on the other hand,\r\nhis cello pieces, as already noticed, maintain even at this time a\r\ncertain value for teaching.\r\n\r\nThere have been certain famous artists who in advanced age, in spite of\r\na considerable decay in their capacity for performance, have unwisely\r\nindulged the inclination of still endeavouring to attract admiration.\r\nBernhard Romberg was one of these. In his seventy-third year he again\r\nhad a desire to visit Paris in order--though not in public--to appear\r\nin artistic circles as a solo player. The failure which he experienced\r\nappears to have had a prejudicial effect on his health, for he died soon\r\nafter his return home, on August 13, 1841.\r\n\r\nRomberg promoted the advancement of German violoncello playing chiefly\r\nby his activity as a soloist, and also by his compositions, for, on\r\naccount of his many concert journeys, which led him sometimes in one\r\ndirection and sometimes in another, he had not sufficient leisure for\r\ncontinuous and regular teaching. A few young artists, however, enjoyed\r\nthe benefit of his instruction. Of these we will mention only here\r\nhis nephew, Cyprian, and Julius Schapler. Some others will be noticed\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nJULIUS SCHAPLER was born on August 21, 1812, in Graudenz.[104] He\r\nreceived his musical education in Berlin.\r\n\r\nCYPRIAN ROMBERG, born in 1807 (according to other accounts, 1810), in\r\nHamburg, made himself known, after he had finished his studies, by his\r\njourneys in Germany and Austria, and was then a member of the Imperial\r\nband at St. Petersburg. In Hamburg, where he spent the last years of\r\nhis life, he was, unfortunately, drowned while bathing in the Elbe\r\nin 1865. B. Romberg was at first his master for the violoncello, on\r\nwhich also he received instruction from the pensioned chamber musician,\r\nHansmann.[105] After his education was concluded Schapler was heard as\r\nsolo player in the Opera House at Berlin, as well as in the Gewandhaus\r\nat Leipsic, with great applause. He declined offers for engagements,\r\nwhich were in consequence proposed to him, as he wished to make himself\r\nknown by concerts. Soon after, however, when the position of solo player\r\nin the Court band of the Duke of Nassau was offered to him he accepted\r\nit. In Wiesbaden, besides his official duties, he was much occupied with\r\ncomposition. The fruits of it were not only several cello pieces, but\r\nalso three greater chamber music works--namely, a String Quartet, a Trio\r\nfor piano and violoncello, as well as a Quintet for piano, violin, tenor\r\nvioloncello, and contra-basso. These last compositions were all crowned\r\nwith success. A warm and appreciative critique of the String Quartet\r\nappeared in 1842 from the pen of Robert Schumann, in his musical paper.\r\n\r\nThe unquiet year, 1848, caused the Duke of Nassau to dismiss the members\r\nof his Kapelle (without pensions). Schapler returned to his home and\r\ncreated for himself a lucrative field of work as music teacher in Thorn,\r\nto which he devoted himself for many years. At the present time he is\r\nliving privately in Berlin.\r\n\r\nSchapler belonged in his prime to the best violoncellists of Germany.\r\nWith fine tone-rendering he had complete mastery over his instrument.\r\nUnfortunately, he did not succeed, after his departure from Wiesbaden,\r\nin obtaining a post worthy of his excellent performances.\r\n\r\nWhile Bernhard Romberg was raising to a position of high honour the\r\nart of violoncello playing in Germany, several important centres were\r\nforming for it in Dresden and Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe Dresden Court, which had always done a great deal for music, was\r\ncontinually taking into consideration the means of attracting into its\r\nneighbourhood distinguished instrumentalists; and if for some time a\r\nsuccession of foreign, but specially Italian artists found a place\r\nthere, a certain amount of gain was the result in connection with\r\nit--for the artist youth of Germany received thereby a progressive\r\nimpulse to their own endeavours. The Dresden Court orchestra had\r\nalready, in the last century, a distinguished reputation, and this was\r\nmore and more enhanced by the continual influx of talented and highly\r\ngifted musicians. As regarded the violoncello especially, it gained not\r\nlong after the beginning of our century an exemplary representative in\r\nDOTZAUER. From that time until the present day Dresden has remained an\r\nimportant centre for violoncello playing.\r\n\r\nJUSTUS JOHANN FRIEDRICH DOTZAUER, born on January 20, 1783, at\r\nHäselrieth, near Hildburghausen, was the son of a minister there.\r\nInstructed early in music, he devoted himself to the piano, violin, and\r\nvioloncello playing. The latter soon gained the ascendancy, and as the\r\ninclination for an artistic career showed itself decisively in him, his\r\nfather sent him, in the year 1799, to Kriegk,[106] at Meiningen, under\r\nwhose direction he studied two years. After the expiration of that\r\nperiod he found a post in the Meiningen Kapelle until 1805, when he went\r\nto Leipsic, and from 1805-1811 he was a member of the orchestra.\r\n\r\nFrom Leipsic he visited Berlin. Here he heard Romberg, with advantage\r\nfor the pursuit of his studies. In the year 1811 he accepted an\r\nhonourable position in the Dresden Court orchestra, to which he\r\nbelonged, from 1821-1850, as first solo cellist. He then lived in\r\nretirement, which he enjoyed for ten years. He died in the place where\r\nhe had successfully worked for so many years on March 6, 1860.\r\n\r\nDotzauer was also well-skilled in composition, and attempted it in\r\nvarious forms. He wrote an Opera, Overtures, Symphonies, a Mass, and\r\nseveral chamber pieces. All these productions have long been forgotten.\r\nNot so his violoncello works, which consist of nine Concertos, three\r\nConcertinos, two Sonatas with bass, Variations, Divertissements,\r\nPotpourris, and a great number of Duets, some of these at least are\r\nstill prized as objects of study. This is especially the case with\r\nregard to his books of instruction, to which belong two violoncello\r\nschools,[107] as well as a number of exercises of various kinds.[108]\r\nAmongst these the most commendable on account of their excellence\r\nare the eighteen “Exercices d’une difficulté progressive” (Op.\r\n120), for beginners (with the exception of the two last numbers),\r\nand the “Twenty-four Daily Studies for the acquiring and keeping of\r\nVirtuosität.” The latter work is in every respect by far the best of\r\nDotzauer’s many studies. He also published a School for Flageolet\r\nplaying (Op. 147). His performances combined the gifts of great solidity\r\nand fascinating sweetness. Of his two sons, the younger, Carl Ludwig,\r\ndevoted himself to the violoncello under the direction of his father. In\r\n1820 he was member of the Hofkapelle at Cassel. He was born on December\r\n7, 1811, at Dresden.\r\n\r\nDotzauer was distinguished not only as an executant artist but also as\r\na teacher. The most remarkable of his scholars are--Kummer, Schuberth,\r\nVoigt, and Drechsler.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH AUGUST KUMMER was born on August 15, 1797, at Meiningen. His\r\nfather, an accomplished oboist, belonged to the Ducal band there. At\r\nthe beginning of the century he entered the Hofkapelle at Dresden, and\r\nhere his son, who at first had taken up his father’s instrument, became\r\nDotzauer’s pupil. When his education was completed on the violoncello,\r\nKummer should have been admitted into the Dresden Hofkapelle; but as\r\nthere was just then no vacancy for his instrument he was obliged for\r\na while to content himself with being received as oboist. This was\r\nin 1814. Three years later he was enrolled among the cellists. By\r\ndiligently prosecuted studies, Kummer gradually reached such a high\r\ndegree of artistic cultivation that when Dotzauer was pensioned, he was\r\nappointed in his place as first violoncellist of the Royal band. In 1864\r\nhe celebrated his fiftieth Jubilee, and then gave himself up to his\r\nwell-deserved retirement. During his long tenure of office he displayed\r\na most extraordinary activity as soloist, quartet, and orchestra player,\r\nas well as teacher. In the latter capacity he worked both privately and\r\nat the Dresden Conservatoire, to which he belonged, until his death,\r\nwhich took place on May 22, 1879. At the same time he wrote a good deal\r\nfor his instrument, a Concerto, two Concertinos, instructive Duets (some\r\neasy and others more difficult), Variations, Etudes, Caprices, Studies\r\n(amongst them, daily ones), diverse musical “Divertissements,” which\r\nwere formerly much in request amongst dilletanti, some of which are\r\nstill used as subjects for the practice of youthful players. He also\r\nproduced a violoncello school. It is at present the most generally used\r\nwork of the kind, short and clear, though only extending to a moderate\r\ndegree of difficulty; finally, Kummer published a useful compendium:\r\n“Repertorium and Orchestral Studies,” containing important and difficult\r\ncello pieces from oratorios, symphonies, overtures, and operas. Kummer’s\r\nplaying bore the stamp of great precision and correctness, united\r\nto powerful and solid intonation. His technique “was in every point\r\nthoroughly cultivated, but to acquire the ‘finesses’ of a virtuoso he\r\nwas of too simple a nature, which was better calculated to occupy itself\r\nwith the sphere of music in its intellectual aspect than in brilliant\r\ndisplay. All that he produced on his instrument was most correct and\r\ndefined, in which he was greatly assisted by his quiet and cautious\r\ntemperament. He was unable indeed to raise himself to the height of\r\npoetical inspiration and unrestrained warmth of expression, though he\r\nnever did violence to a good composition. His manner of rendering was\r\nalways strictly objective and according to rule.” Amongst Kummer’s\r\npupils Cossmann and Julius Goltermann are prominent.\r\n\r\nBERNHARD COSSMANN, born on May 17, 1822, in Dessau, studied at first\r\nunder Theodore Müller, the cellist of the formerly famous Müller String\r\nQuartet, at Brunswick, and then under Kummer. During the years 1840-1841\r\nhe worked in the orchestra of the Grand Opéra in Paris, after which he\r\nwent to London. In 1848 he was engaged as solo player for the Leipsic\r\n(Gewandhaus) Concert, in 1852 taken to Weimar by Franz Liszt, and in\r\n1866 appointed teacher of cello playing to the Conservatoire at Moscow.\r\nFrom 1870 to 1878 Cossmann lived privately in Baden-Baden and only\r\nappeared to play at concerts. When the Conservatoire at Hoch was founded\r\nin 1878, the office of teacher of his instrument was entrusted to him,\r\nwhich post he now occupies. Cossmann belongs to the best cellists of the\r\npresent time. He has a fine, distinct tone, manages the fingerboard with\r\nease, and is not only a distinguished solo player but also an excellent\r\nquartet player. Amongst his compositions the most worthy of notice are\r\na Concert piece with piano accompaniment, three “Fantasias” on _Motifs_\r\nfrom the “Freischütz,” “Tell,” and “Euryanthe,” six Solos in two parts,\r\na Swiss Melody and a Neapolitan Canzonet, three Pieces (Op. 8), Etudes\r\nde Concert (Op. 10), and Violoncello Studies.\r\n\r\nJOHANN AUGUST GOLTERMANN, born on July 25, 1825, in Hamburg, after\r\nhe had perfected himself under Kummer, was appointed to the Prague\r\nConservatoire, to which he belonged from 1850 to 1862. In the latter\r\nyear he exchanged this employment for that of first solo cellist in the\r\nStuttgart orchestra. In 1870 he was pensioned, and on April 4, 1876, he\r\ndied. He was an able artist in his branch of it.\r\n\r\nThe next pupil of Dotzauer to be mentioned is CARL SCHUBERTH, born\r\non February 25, 1811, in Magdeburg. He received at first, from a\r\nmusician of his native town named Hesse, six years instruction, and\r\nthen repaired to Dresden to Dotzauer, with whom he remained two years.\r\nOn his return home he made his _début_ with success as a soloist at\r\na concert organised by Catalani, in Magdeburg. At the end of 1828 he\r\nundertook a concert tour to the North. The destination was Copenhagen,\r\nwhere, in the spring of 1829, he arrived and made a prolonged sojourn.\r\nLater on Schuberth occupied the position of first violoncellist at the\r\nMagdeburg Theatre, gave it up, however, in 1833, and undertook, in the\r\nautumn of the same year, a journey through Western Germany and Belgium.\r\nFrom the latter place he visited Paris. In the following year he went\r\nto Holland, and during the season of 1835 he was heard in London.\r\nSchuberth then went to St. Petersburg, where he found, as elsewhere, a\r\nbrilliant reception, and immediately a permanent position, for he was\r\nnot only named Director of the Imperial band, but also Inspector of\r\nthe Music School affiliated to the Court Theatre and Director of Music\r\nat the University. He filled these posts until 1863, in which year\r\ndeath overtook him during a journey for the benefit of his health, on\r\nJuly 22, at Zurich. Schuberth’s playing was exceedingly clever, but in\r\nexpression more elegant and ornamental than impressive. His cello pieces\r\ngive evidence of this, which, with the exception of a Concerto, belong\r\nto the description of so-called conversazione music; but they have not\r\nsurvived their author. Amongst his pupils the most remarkable is Carl\r\nDavidoff.[109]\r\n\r\nCARL LOUIS VOIGT, the third of Dotzauer’s pupils above-mentioned, was\r\nborn on November 8, 1792, at Zeitz; he was the son of the organist\r\nat St. Thomas’s Church, Leipsic, Joh. Georg Hermann Voigt. He played\r\nseveral instruments, and amongst others the violoncello also, on\r\nwhich his grandfather, Johann Heinr. Viktor Rose,[110] had given him\r\ninstruction at Quedlinburg. Besides his work as organist, he played\r\nthe violoncello with the orchestra of the theatre in the Gewandhaus\r\nat Leipsic. He imparted to his son what he knew and was able to do as\r\ncellist, who, in order to perfect himself, studied under Dotzauer’s\r\ndirection some time, and in 1811 took the latter’s place in the Leipsic\r\nOrchestra, to which he had belonged since the winter of 1809-1810. Voigt\r\nfilled this post until his death, which took place on February 21, 1831.\r\nHis violoncello compositions extant, consisting of Sonatas, Duets,\r\nExercises, and a diversity of Drawing-room Pieces, are feeble, but may\r\nbe used for instruction--as, for example, the three Sonatas (Op. 40).\r\n\r\nCARL DRECHSLER, finally, born on May 27, 1800, at Camenz, in the kingdom\r\nof Saxony, early studied violoncello playing. He began his career as a\r\nmilitary musician at Dessau. At the same time he assisted as cellist in\r\nthe orchestra there. Through the recommendation of Friedrich Schneider,\r\nwho discerned the young man’s talent, the Duke of Dessau granted him\r\nthe means, in 1824, of placing himself under Dotzauer’s direction for\r\nfurther cultivation. After this he undertook a long concert tour. The\r\ngreat success of this caused his name to be well known, with the result\r\nthat, in the year 1826, he was permanently established in the orchestra\r\nat Dessau, with the title of Concertmaster.\r\n\r\nDrechsler’s performances were characterised as much by faultless purity\r\nand refinement as by feeling and tasteful rendering. His playing was\r\nnot powerful, but pleasing by its grace and delicacy. He was everywhere\r\nreceived with welcome, and, as he responded to all that was demanded\r\nas an excellent leader of his instrument in the orchestra, he was an\r\neagerly sought guest at all musical festivals. After he was pensioned,\r\nin 1871, he chose Dresden as his residence. He did not, however, long\r\nenjoy the amenities of retirement, for he died in the year 1873.\r\n\r\nHis son, LOUIS, born on October 5, 1822, at Dessau, formed himself under\r\nthe direction of his father as a clever violoncellist. He lived and\r\nworked as such for a long time in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nDrechsler, the father, was an excellent teacher. Through him Dessau was\r\nfor a time affiliated to the Dresden school of cello playing, in which\r\nhe educated excellent artists, amongst whom the best known are Lindner\r\nand Grützmacher.\r\n\r\nAUGUST LINDNER,[111] born on October 29, 1820, at Dessau, after he\r\nhad completed his studies, was appointed, in the year 1837, to the\r\nHofkapelle at Hanover, to which he belonged until his death (June,\r\n1878). He enjoyed the reputation of a distinguished violoncellist. Of\r\nhis compositions we must mention a Concerto (Op. 34), Nine Drawing-room\r\nPieces (Op. 18), Six Fantasias (Op. 38), Divertissements for young\r\ncellists (two parts, Op. 32), Concert au Salon (two parts), Three\r\nParaphrases on _Motifs_ from Meyerbeer’s “Huguenots” and “Le Prophète,”\r\nas well as Verdi’s “Ernani” (Op. 12), and a long list of Opera\r\nPotpourris. Besides these, Lindner produced a new edition of L. Duport’s\r\n“Essai sur le doigter du Violoncelle.”[112]\r\n\r\nHis pupil, BERNHARD THIEME, born on June 11, 1854, in Altenburg, began\r\nhis musical career after he left school, under the town musician at\r\nPenig, in Saxony, and when at eighteen he returned home from there, he\r\nreceived cello instruction, for a short time, from the Kapellmeister,\r\nToller. He very soon found employment in the Berlin Orchestra. He then\r\nwent, as first cellist, with the Fliegen Orchestra, for a summer, to\r\nSt. Petersburg, in the same capacity; a few months later he entered the\r\nBückeburg Kapelle. He was subsequently occupied in the Hofkapelle at\r\nHanover for two years, and during this period he enjoyed the excellent\r\nteaching of Aug. Lindner. Since 1879 he has filled the place of solo\r\ncellist in the town orchestra at Baden-Baden.\r\n\r\nThe Dresden school of cello playing, founded by Dotzauer, and continued\r\nby Kummer, received a still greater forward impulse through FRIEDRICH\r\nWILHELM LUDWIG GRÜTZMACHER.\r\n\r\nThis far-famed artist, whose efficiency was a great ornament to the\r\nDresden “Kapellinstitute,” was born on March 1, 1832, in Dessau, and\r\nafter he had learned from his father, who was an esteemed member of\r\nthe Ducal band, the elements of music, benefited from the instruction\r\nof Carl Drechsler. Thus the teaching of Dotzauer, whose pupil Carl\r\nDrechsler was at the place whence it had emanated, was further\r\ndeveloped--a most valuable gain for the artistic life of the Court of\r\nSaxony.\r\n\r\nGrützmacher came to Leipsic in the year 1848, fundamentally well\r\nprepared for his vocation, and entered a private choral society in order\r\nto be thoroughly conversant with the necessary routine in orchestra\r\nplaying. He was soon invited to take part in the Gewandhaus and the\r\nEuterpe Concerts. In the latter he made his _début_ at the beginning\r\nof February, 1849, as solo player, with Variations by Franchomme. The\r\nfirst violoncellist of the Leipsic Gewandhaus was a certain Wittmann.\r\nAs, however, his performances did not fully satisfy, Bernhard Cossmann\r\nwas engaged in 1848 for the solo parts and for the cello teaching at the\r\nConservatoire. Then when Cossmann responded to the invitation to go to\r\nWeimar, Grützmacher took his place, although at the same time he was a\r\nregular member of the opera orchestra. From that period he was the chief\r\nrepresentative of his instrument in Leipsic. Not the less however did\r\nhe strive indefatigably to progress in his Art, keeping unceasingly in\r\nview the goal of perfection. How well he succeeded in reaching it is\r\nproved by the dominant position which he gained and maintained. Julius\r\nRietz, who was himself an able violoncellist, and had had during his\r\nDirectorship in Leipsic many opportunities of observing Grützmacher’s\r\nextraordinary executive capacity, rated him very highly, and was in the\r\nhabit of admiringly expressing himself with regard to the incomparable,\r\nexemplary and thorough training of his left hand. It is, therefore, the\r\nmore intelligible that he made him every offer possible in order to gain\r\nhim for the Dresden Hofkapelle, after he had undertaken its direction.\r\nThis happened in 1860, and in the same year Grützmacher was summoned\r\nto Dresden as Kummer’s successor. From this time he travelled through\r\nGermany, Holland, England, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Denmark, Sweden,\r\nand Russia, and was received everywhere with triumph; but he was also\r\ndistinguished in many ways at the place of his work. In course of time\r\nhe received from the King of Saxony the title of Chamber Virtuoso, later\r\nhe was appointed Royal Concert leader, and on his twenty-fifth jubilee\r\nof service he was honoured far and wide in manifold ways.\r\n\r\nIn Grützmacher’s playing were happily united the endowments of a\r\nfinished mastery of complex technical difficulties and delicate manner\r\nof expression, more especially in the rendering of _Cantilena_. He is\r\nnot only a virtuoso of the first rank, but also an excellent interpreter\r\nof classical chamber music. For this latter qualification the foundation\r\nhad already been laid by a careful musical education under his father’s\r\nroof, to which Friedrich Schneider had substantially contributed. He\r\npursued his theoretical studies under the direction of this master.\r\n\r\nGrützmacher published a great number of compositions. Those which have\r\nhad the widest circulation are the two Concertos, Op. 10 (A minor) and\r\nOp. 46 (E minor); the Hungarian Fantasia (Op. 7), the Nocturne (Op.\r\n32), the Scherzo (Op. 30), the Transcriptions of Classical Music (Op.\r\n60), the “Daily Studies,” the Twenty-four Studies (Op. 38), as well as\r\nthree Songs with Violoncello obbligato (Op. 50). He added considerably\r\nto the enrichment of violoncello literature by his transcriptions of\r\nHaydn’s, Mozart’s, Beethoven’s, and Schumann’s Sonatas, as well as of\r\ntwo of Beethoven’s Violin Romances, and of Schumann’s “Kinderscenen.”\r\nHe further arranged for the Violoncello the Thirty-six “Songs without\r\nWords” of Mendelssohn, about twelve selected Piano pieces by Schumann\r\nand Chopin, the Violin Sonata (Op. 19) and the Romance (Op. 44) by\r\nRubinstein, the “Pensées fugitives” by Steph. Heller and Ernst, and\r\nmany other pieces of music. Grützmacher also brought out new editions\r\nof classical and modern compositions, with the addition of careful\r\nannotations. We must here mention the two Gamba Sonatas of Joh. Seb.\r\nBach, as well as his six Violoncello Suites; a Gamba Sonata by Handel\r\nand by Phil. Em. Bach, six Boccherini Sonatas with the addition of a\r\npiano accompaniment, a Sonata by Bonifazio Asioli, some Violoncello\r\nCompositions of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Chopin; a “Thème\r\nRusse varié” by Ferd. Ries, the ten Concertos and six easy Instruction\r\nPieces for Violoncello by Bernhard Romberg, as well as twelve Exercises\r\nby Dotzauer (Op. 107), with the addition of a second violoncello part.\r\n\r\nIn a special manner Grützmacher is deserving of merit by his highly\r\nsuccessful method of instruction in violoncello playing. Even during his\r\nactive work in Leipsic he formed several excellent cellists, whose names\r\nare Leopold Grützmacher, Kahnt, Wilfert, Hilpert, and Hegar.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD GRÜTZMACHER, a younger brother of the cello master already\r\nmentioned, born on September 4, 1835, at Dessau, was taught cello\r\nplaying first by Drechsler and then by his brother, while Fr. Schneider\r\nconducted his theoretical education.\r\n\r\nLeopold Grützmacher belonged successively to the Theatre and Gewandhaus\r\norchestras in Leipsic, to the Court band at Schwerin, to the orchestra\r\nof the German National Theatre in Prague, and to the Meiningen Court\r\nband. From the latter he was called, in 1876, to Weimar, as solo cellist\r\nto the Grand Ducal Kapelle. Like his brother he was also distinguished\r\nby the title of “Chamber Virtuoso” and “Concertmaster.” He published\r\nfor the violoncello two Concertos (Op. 6 and 9) and several smaller,\r\npleasing, and well worked out compositions.\r\n\r\nLeopold Grützmacher educated his son, whose Christian name was\r\nFriedrich, as a cellist. He has already afforded agreeable proofs of his\r\nexecutive capacity in his public appearances, and is a member of the\r\nWeimar Royal orchestra.\r\n\r\nMORITZ KAHNT, born on April 27, 1836, in Löbnitz (near Leipsic),\r\nreceived instruction in his parents’ house from his seventh to his\r\nfourteenth year not only on the violin and the piano, but also on\r\nseveral wind instruments. Later he devoted himself by preference to\r\nvioloncello playing, in which he was Grützmacher’s pupil for three\r\nyears in the Leipsic Conservatoire. During the same time he received\r\ninstruction at the above-named Institution in composition and the organ.\r\nFrom the year 1855 he has been first cellist of the Concert Orchestra,\r\nas well as teacher in the school of music at Basle. Besides his post as\r\norganist he superintends the direction of a Musical Union there.\r\n\r\nBRUNO WILFERT, born on July 26, 1836, at Schmalzgrube, in Saxony, began\r\nhis education first as violinist under the town musical director at\r\nKirchberg (in the neighbourhood of Zwickau), then went with him to\r\nGlauchau, and there began cello playing. Twice a week he journeyed,\r\nwith his violoncello under his arm, to the town of Zwickau, three\r\nhours distant, in order to get instruction from the violoncellist,\r\nFr. Herrmann, a pupil of F. A. Kummer, who belonged to the town\r\norchestra. Later on he became Grützmacher’s pupil at Leipsic. By his\r\nunceasing industry Wilfert succeeded so well that in the year 1864 he\r\nwas appointed solo cellist to the German Theatre at Prague. Since the\r\nfoundation of the Prague Musical Union (1876) he has belonged as a\r\nco-operating member to the Quartet Society. The cello compositions of\r\nWilfert which have appeared are Two Pieces (Op. 1), Hungarisch (Op. 2),\r\nFantasia on Airs from the “Masked Ball” (Op. 3), Two Drawing-room Pieces\r\n(Op. 4), and a “Nocturne” for four Violoncellos (Op. 5).\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH HILPERT, born March 4, 1841, at Nuremburg, went to the Leipsic\r\nConservatoire, was there pupil of Grützmacher, and having finished his\r\nstudies found an appointment in the Karlsruhe orchestra. He then went to\r\nZurich, where he made the acquaintance of the distinguished violinist,\r\nJean Becker (who died on October 10, 1884); with him, in 1866, in\r\nconnection with the Italians Masi and Chiostri as second violin and\r\ntenor, he founded that artistic union which, as the “Florentine String\r\nQuartet,” attained to such great reputation on account of its excellent\r\nperformances. In 1875 Hilpert separated from his Quartet companions\r\nin order to take the place, hitherto filled by Röver, which had been\r\noffered to him in the Grand Opéra and the Conservatoire at Vienna.\r\nAfter the lapse of a year, he gave up this appointment again, and\r\nbecame, under the title of Chamber Virtuoso, a member of the Meiningen\r\nHofkapelle, and was employed as soloist in the concert tours under the\r\ndirection of Hans v. Bülow. When he relinquished this undertaking,\r\nhe entered the Royal orchestra at Munich, to which he still belongs.\r\nHilpert is reckoned one of the best German cellists of the present day.\r\nThe publication arranged by him of a collection of “classical studies”\r\nby Couperin, Rameau, Bach, and Martini are worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nEMIL HEGAR also, born on January 3, 1843, at Basle, received his\r\neducation, like the above-named cellists, from Grützmacher, at the\r\nLeipsic Conservatoire. In the year 1866 he was appointed, on account\r\nof his much esteemed performances, first Violoncellist of the Academy\r\nOrchestra, as well as teacher at the Conservatoire at Leipsic. Compelled\r\nby a nervous affection to abandon entirely, a few years later,\r\nVioloncello playing, he devoted himself to the study of singing, and\r\nbecame a singing master. He worked with success as such in the school of\r\nmusic in his native town. The loss which cello playing sustained in him\r\nis proved by his pupil,\r\n\r\nJULIUS KLENGEL, one of the most excellent and purest violoncello\r\nplayers of the younger generation. He was born on September 24, 1859,\r\nat Leipsic, and is now working in his native town as first cellist in\r\nthe Gewandhaus Concerts and as teacher at the Conservatoire. Klengel\r\nhas not only made himself known outside the sphere of his work by his\r\nremarkable playing, but also as a most attractive composer for his\r\ninstrument. Amongst his works we will mention only the compositions\r\npublished, as Op. 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 20. Of those of his\r\nworks not numbered must be named a collection of “Unsere Lieblinge,”\r\nwhich contains “the most charming melodies of ancient and modern times,”\r\ncleverly arranged with piano accompaniment.\r\n\r\nA second pupil of Hegar’s is HERMANN HEBERLEIN, who also had the\r\nadvantage of Carl Schröder’s and Bernhard Cossmann’s instruction.\r\nBorn on March 29, 1859, at Marckneukirchen, in the kingdom of Saxony,\r\nHeberlein went, from 1873-1877, to the Leipsic Conservatoire. In the\r\nlast years of that period he gave concerts in South Germany, and finally\r\nwas appointed to be solo cellist at the town theatre of Königsberg.\r\nIn 1883 he undertook the office of teacher of his instrument at the\r\nmusic school there. He wrote “Elementary Studies” for the Violoncello,\r\n“Practical Cello Studies” (2 books, Op. 5), Variations for the\r\nVioloncello, with piano accompaniment (Op. 2), Two Cello Pieces (Op. 3),\r\nfour Pièces de Salon (Op. 6), and also published a Violoncello school.\r\n\r\nThe favourable results which had been attained in Leipsic by Friedrich\r\nGrützmacher in the training of his pupils made him very soon the most\r\nattractive teacher in Germany. As already mentioned, after he had\r\naccepted the flattering invitations made to him to go to Dresden, pupils\r\ncame to him from all parts. Only the most famous amongst them are\r\nnoticed below.\r\n\r\nOSCAR EBERLE, born June 5, 1841, at Krossen, on the Oder, received from\r\nhis father, who was town music director, his first instruction on the\r\ncello. At fourteen he had already made such progress that he was taken\r\ninto the Bilse Orchestra, which at that time had its headquarters at\r\nLiegnitz. He belonged to it for five years, in the course of which he\r\nwas also employed as soloist in the concerts of the Society. He was\r\nthen for two years Grützmacher’s pupil in Dresden; advancing rapidly\r\nunder his direction, he attained to artistic maturity. In 1867 Eberle\r\nwas summoned to Rotterdam as teacher to the music school there, as well\r\nas solo cellist at the concerts given by the “Matchappy tot bevordering\r\nder Toonkunst.” He was immediately engaged as soloist for the German\r\nOpera at Rotterdam. He retired from the latter post in 1886. Eberle is\r\nan honorary member of the Concert Society, with which he worked, as well\r\nas of the Society of Students, “Sempre crescendo,” at Leyden, a proof of\r\nhow highly his talent is appreciated in Holland.\r\n\r\nRICHARD BELLMANN, born on June 8, 1844, at Freiburg, in the kingdom\r\nof Saxony, at first benefited by the instruction of F. A. Kummer, and\r\nthen went through a course under Grützmacher, after having for three\r\nyears frequented the Conservatoire at Dresden. He then went to Paris,\r\nin order to study composition under the direction of Franchomme. This\r\nconnection, however, did not last long, as Bellmann was soon summoned\r\nto the Grand Ducal Kapelle at Schwerin, as first solo cellist. His\r\nperformances met with such high appreciation that he was distinguished\r\nby the Grand Duke with the bestowal of the title of Chamber Virtuoso. In\r\n1878 Bellmann gave up his position at Schwerin, which he had occupied\r\nfor twelve years, took up his residence at Bonn, and was engaged chiefly\r\nas a concert player. A short time after was formed at Cologne the\r\nHeckmann String Quartet, which gained such reputation in recent years\r\nduring its tours in Germany, England, and Italy, which Bellmann joined,\r\nand to which he still belongs as a special ornament.\r\n\r\nBellmann must be considered one of the most accomplished violoncellists\r\nof the present time, not only as a soloist, but also as a quartet\r\nplayer. With complete technical training, his playing is distinguished\r\nby its exemplary purity, rarely fine tone, its elegance, and its noble\r\nand accurate musical rendering.\r\n\r\nEMIL BOERNGEN spent his youth in Emden, where his father was music\r\ndirector. He was born on February 2, 1845, at Verden. He received his\r\nfirst instruction in music from his father. He then began the study of\r\nvioloncello playing under the direction of the chamber virtuoso, C.\r\nMattys, in Hanover. He obtained, however, his higher education under\r\nthe direction of Grützmacher, and had the benefit of his tuition for\r\nthree years. In 1870 Boerngen went to Helsingfors. He there undertook\r\nthe post of cellist at the theatre. At the same time he was frequently\r\na much appreciated player both as soloist and in quartets. Two years\r\nafter he accepted the invitation to Strasburg Theatre as solo cellist.\r\nAfter several years of activity he relinquished his post and went to\r\nSalzburg, where he was engaged for the Mozarteum. Since 1875 he has been\r\nteacher of violoncello playing at the Royal Music School at Würzburg.\r\nIn consideration of his successful work at that Institute, in 1883 he\r\nreceived the title of Professor as a mark of distinction. During his\r\nofficial activity he was also occupied as solo and quartet player.\r\n\r\nRICHARD VOLLRATH was born on December 16, 1848, in the Thuringian town\r\nof Sonneberg, belonging to Saxe-Meiningen, where his father filled the\r\noffice of town musician. The boy early tried several instruments,\r\ntill he at length showed his preference for the violoncello. His first\r\nteacher was the royal chamber musician, Roda, at Rudolstadt. During\r\nthe years 1865-1867, he studied under the direction of Grützmacher.\r\nHaving fulfilled his military term at Coblenz, Vollrath belonged, from\r\n1871-1873, to the Royal orchestra at Ems as cellist. In the following\r\nwinter he joined the Mannsfeld first orchestra at Dresden. He made use\r\nof his residence there to renew his studies under Grützmacher. He then\r\nwent as first cellist for two years into the Wiesbaden orchestra. Since\r\nSeptember, 1876, he has belonged in the same capacity to the Municipal\r\norchestra at Mainz. Besides his official post he is also prominent as a\r\nsolo player and an appreciated teacher.\r\n\r\nCARL. FRIEDR. WILH. FITZENHAGEN was educated under the guidance\r\nof Grützmacher as a violoncello virtuoso of eminent rank. This\r\ndistinguished artist was born on September 15, 1848, in the little\r\ntown of Seesen, in Brunswick, where his father was music director. He\r\nearly began his practice--in his fifth year on the piano, in his eighth\r\non the violoncello, in his eleventh year on the violin. Besides these\r\ninstruments, he learned by degrees several wind instruments in order to\r\ntake part in his father’s musical entertainments when a vacancy occurred\r\nin his orchestra. By means of this many-sided capacity, Fitzenhagen\r\ngained, even in early youth, a certain routine in musical matters which,\r\nlater on, stood him in good stead.\r\n\r\nFitzenhagen received the first regular cello instruction, besides making\r\nprogress in piano and violin playing, from the Ducal chamber musician,\r\nPlock, in Brunswick. But he soon made his appearance there as soloist.\r\nHis really serious study, however, was in the beginning of October of\r\nthe year 1862, when he became Theodore Müller’s pupil. After a lapse\r\nof three years, Fitzenhagen was heard by the Duke of Brunswick in the\r\nTheatre Royal. The trial performance was so satisfactory that the Duke,\r\nin order to forward him in his artistic career, released him entirely\r\nfrom military service. Patrons of high standing immediately supplied\r\nhim with the means of prosecuting his cello studies under Grützmacher.\r\nThis occurred in May, 1867. A year later, notwithstanding his youth,\r\nhe was named a member of the Hofkapelle of Saxony. From that time he\r\nfrequently made his appearance as a solo player; took part, in 1869, in\r\nthe general musical gathering in Leipsic, and in 1870 at the Beethoven\r\nFestival. Franz Liszt wished to gain him for the orchestra at Weimar,\r\nbut Fitzenhagen preferred to accept an offer made to him to be Professor\r\nat the Imperial Conservatoire in Moscow. From that time he has developed\r\nan uncommonly active and successful artistic capability as a concert\r\nplayer as well as chamber music performer. He gained striking results\r\nin his professorial relations, for he is at present looked upon as the\r\ncello master of greatest repute in Russia. The best of his pupils will\r\nbe mentioned in the last section of this book.\r\n\r\nAfter Fitzenhagen had been appointed Concertmaster to the Russian\r\nImperial Musical Society, the direction of the Moscow Music and\r\nOrchestral Union, which organises annually some concerts, was made over\r\nto him some three years ago.\r\n\r\nFitzenhagen was very industrious as a composer. Besides a String\r\nQuartet, which gained the prize of the St. Petersburg Chamber Musical\r\nUnion, he wrote four Cello Concertos, a Suite for Violoncello and\r\norchestra, a “Fantasia” on _Motifs_ from Rubinstein’s “Dämon,” with\r\norchestra; a long list of drawing-room pieces, amongst them twelve\r\nlittle pieces which embraced a Quarto, a Ballade with orchestra, and a\r\nbook containing technical Cello Studies.\r\n\r\nALBERT PETERSEN, born on October 23, 1856, in Lübeck, after he had\r\nstudied under Grützmacher, was first cellist in the private bands at\r\nDresden, Kreuznach, and Cassel; accepted engagements for America and\r\nPawlowsk, near St. Petersburg, and has since filled for ten years the\r\nposition of solo cellist in Magdeburg, as well as that of cello master\r\nat the Musical Institute there.\r\n\r\nCARL MONHAUPT, born on March 9, 1856, in Hamburg, began his musical\r\nstudies with piano playing. In his fifteenth year he decided for the\r\nvioloncello, of which he learnt the elements from the cellist named\r\nKaterbaum, of the Central Hall orchestra of his native town. In 1872 he\r\nbetook himself to Sondershausen, in order to pursue his studies under\r\nthe direction of his brother Fritz,[113] who at that time belonged\r\nto the Royal orchestra of Sondershausen as first cellist. Here he\r\nremained three years, when he went to Dresden in order to perfect his\r\neducation under Grützmacher’s guidance. At the present time he is first\r\nvioloncellist of the Musical Society and of the Orchestral Union at\r\nBerne, as well as teacher at the music school there.\r\n\r\nOSCAR BRÜCKNER, born on January 2, 1857, at Erfurt, received his first\r\ncello instruction from the Concertmaster, Herlitz, in Ballenstedt,\r\nafter he had been prepared by his father for the musical career. But he\r\ncompleted the most important part of his studies under Fr. Grützmacher,\r\nin Dresden, where he also received instruction in the theoretical\r\nportion from Felix Dräseke.\r\n\r\nAfter he had finished his course of study, Brückner undertook concert\r\ntours in Russia, Poland, and Holland. Wherever he was heard he was\r\nmarked by well-merited success. Besides his clever “technique” he\r\nmade a great impression by his broad and full tone. From 1882-1884\r\nhe was engaged as violoncellist at the Grand Ducal Court Theatre in\r\nNeustrelitz. On retiring from this post he received the title of Chamber\r\nVirtuoso. Since 1886 he has been solo cellist at the Theatre Royal,\r\nWiesbaden. At the same time he takes part in the Violoncello teaching at\r\nthe Wiesbaden Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nBrückner’s official successor in Neustrelitz, OTTO KÖHLER, was born\r\nDecember 21, 1861, at Neuhaldensleben (in the district of Merseburg). He\r\nwent to school at Chemnitz and having performed his military service,\r\nhe entered the Regiment of Life Grenadiers at Dresden. He there\r\nremained until 1882, in order to perfect himself, under Grützmacher,\r\nin Violoncello playing, which he had already pursued by himself. In\r\nJanuary, 1883, Köhler was engaged for the Kapelle of the Duke of Coburg\r\nGotha. He remained two years at this post, during which he went through\r\na theoretical course under the direction of the Court Kapellmeister,\r\nLangert. In 1885 he was offered the post of solo cellist at Neustrelitz.\r\nIn this position he is at present.\r\n\r\nA German-American is also amongst Grützmacher’s pupils. EMIL SCHENK,\r\nborn at the beginning of the sixties at Rochester, North America. In\r\n1879 his father, a native of Baden, who had settled as music teacher\r\nin the above-mentioned American town, sent him to Dresden to complete\r\nhis studies under Grützmacher’s direction. He made rapid progress,\r\nand soon attracted the attention of the Dresden musical circle to so\r\ngreat a degree that at the end of the same year he was appointed to the\r\nHofkapelle there. His engagement, however, was only temporary, for as\r\nsoon as Schenk had completed his studies under Grützmacher, he returned\r\nto America. On his frequent public appearances in New York he has had\r\nbrilliant success. The well-known Director of the Philharmonic Concerts,\r\nTheod. Thomas, did not let the favourable opportunity escape of gaining\r\nover the highly gifted young artist as solo cellist for his orchestra.\r\nHe attained to ever-increasing appreciation and popularity. But as\r\nThomas so frequently undertook tours with his orchestra in the States\r\nof the Union, this occupation became at length too irksome to him; he\r\nreleased himself from the contract, and from that time, encouraged by\r\nthe sympathy of the public, he lives in New York as an independent\r\nartist, and works not only as a concert player, but also as a teacher of\r\ngreat repute.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent pupil of Grützmacher is HUGO BECKER, son of the famous\r\nViolinist who founded the Florentine Quartet, but who unhappily died\r\nin the flower of his age, in 1884. Hugo Becker was born on February\r\n13, 1863, at Strasburg, in Alsace, and at the beginning of the sixth\r\nyear of his life received instruction from his father on the piano and\r\nthe violin. When he was nine years old, he heard a Violoncello played\r\nin church, and this made such an impression on him, that he decided in\r\nfavour of that instrument. A pupil of Menter’s, the cellist Kündinger,\r\nof Mannheim, whither Becker’s parents had gone in 1869, undertook his\r\neducation. At fifteen he had made such progress, that the place of\r\nsecond cellist was offered to him in the orchestra of the Mannheim Court\r\nTheatre, which he accepted. At the end of nine months he gave this up in\r\norder to go through a course under Grützmacher, from whose instruction\r\nhe benefited for five months. Having returned home, his father undertook\r\nhis further tuition, and used to play to him studies and concert pieces\r\non the Violin which greatly assisted his progress in regard to their\r\ncomprehension and rendering. The circumstance that he was constantly\r\nhearing in the parental home a great deal of chamber music in the best\r\nmanner and himself took part in it, was of great value for the young\r\nman’s musical education. In the year 1880 Jean Becker resolved to\r\nundertake concert tours with his son Hugo and his brother and sister\r\nJEANNE (a pianist) and Hans (tenor), during which the young Cello\r\nvirtuoso, then seventeen years of age, gained his first laurels. While\r\nthe Becker family quartet was performing in London, Hugo Becker had the\r\nopportunity of being brought a good deal in contact with Piatti, which\r\nwas not without producing some influence on his playing. The practices\r\nat the De Swert Violoncello Concerts, under the direction of their\r\nfounder, also contributed to his progress.\r\n\r\nFor two years, from October, 1884, till the autumn of 1886, Becker\r\nfilled the office of solo cellist at the Frankfort Opera. From that\r\ntime he accepted no other post, in order to leave his time quite free\r\nfor concert engagements. Frankfort-on-the-Main has continued to be his\r\nplace of residence. We must mention that he has the title of Grand Ducal\r\nChamber Virtuoso of Baden.\r\n\r\nKARL LÜBBE, born on February 11, 1839, in Halberstadt, began his musical\r\ncareer as a member of the regimental band at Magdeburg, was appointed to\r\nthe Grand Ducal Berneburg orchestra at Ballenstedt, and came to Dessau\r\non the union of the Anhalt Duchies. As he showed himself very assiduous\r\nthe Duke of Dessau granted him the means of perfecting himself still\r\nmore under the guidance of Grützmacher. He gained great dexterity and\r\nskill, but was inclined to the various experiments of a virtuoso, which\r\nhe carried out also in his compositions. His cello pieces have not been\r\npublished. After Drechsler was pensioned Lübbe became his successor as\r\nfirst Violoncellist in the Court Chapel at Dessau. He died in his prime\r\non January 7, 1888.\r\n\r\nHUGO JÄGER took his place, born on May 17, in Warmbrunn. He profited\r\nby the instruction of Popper and Grützmacher, became then a member of\r\nthe Hofcapelle of the Prince of Hohenzollern, in Löwenberg, and after\r\nrelinquishing this was employed in Ems, Altenburg, and Brunswick. Since\r\n1874 he has belonged to the Ducal band in Dessau.\r\n\r\nAUREL V. CZERWENKA, born on December 31, 1860, at Karánsebes, in\r\nthe Hungarian state, Szöreny, was first a pupil of the Steiermark\r\nMusical Union at Gratz. In 1882 he came to Dresden and frequented\r\nthe Conservatoire as a pupil of Grützmacher, under whose direction\r\nhe afterwards studied privately. On the completion of his education\r\nhe worked for a time as first cellist in the Mannsfeld orchestra in\r\nDresden, and then he undertook the office of solo cellist at the Land\r\nTheatre, as well as that of teacher at the Steiermark Musical Union at\r\nGratz. His performances show genuine artistic talent and training.\r\n\r\nTwo other pupils of Grützmacher’s must be here mentioned concerning\r\nwhom there is very defective information. The first to be considered\r\nis THEODOR KRUMBHOLZ, who unfortunately died while still young. He was\r\nfirst Violoncellist at the Stuttgard Court Kapelle, with the title of\r\nRoyal Wurtemburg Chamber Virtuoso.\r\n\r\nH. RUHOFF became, after he had finished his studies, first cellist at\r\nthe Theatre Royal at Pesth, but was obliged to give up his place on\r\naccount of a nervous affection, and still lives as a music master at\r\nZurich, where he teaches chiefly at his brother’s Musical Institute.\r\n\r\nA. HEYN, born in Dresden, is exclusively a pupil of Grützmacher. After\r\nhis training he was first occupied in the orchestra of German Opera at\r\nRotterdam. He is now working as first Violoncellist in the Grand Ducal\r\nband in Darmstadt. As regards the Violoncellists, Smith and Rüdinger,\r\nwho were likewise Grützmacher’s pupils, information will be given among\r\nthe Dutch and Danish cellists. As a third pupil of Drechsler--\r\n\r\nKARL SCHRÖDER, born on December 18, 1848, in Quedlinburg, must be\r\nhere noticed with distinction. He had already made such progress\r\nin cello studies at fourteen years of age that he was able to be\r\nreceived into the Hofkapelle at Sondershausen. After he had joined\r\nhis brothers in forming a string quartet, which was distinguished\r\nby his performances, he accepted, in 1873, the place offered to\r\nhim as first cellist in the Brunswick Kapelle. Only a year later,\r\nhowever, he consented to go as first representative of his instrument\r\nto Leipsic, and he also superintended at the same time the cello\r\ninstruction in the Conservatoire there. From Leipsic Schröder went, in\r\n1881, as Hof-Capellmeister to Sondershausen. He worked at this post\r\nfor five years; he then undertook the direction of German Opera in\r\nRotterdam. Thence he went, in 1887, as Hof-Capellmeister to Berlin.\r\nSince the autumn of 1888 he has been occupied as Capellmeister at the\r\nStadt-Theatre at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nSchröder published the following Cello compositions: Three Concertos\r\n(Op. 32, 36, and 55), three concerted pieces (Op. 38, 51, and 56),\r\nan Allegro di Sonatina (Op. 13), Pieces of National Airs (Op. 14), a\r\nSong without Words (Op. 15), and a Nocturne (Op. 42). Besides these\r\nhe produced a Violoncello school (Op. 16), a school of scales and\r\nchords (Op. 29), a school of shakes and staccatos (Op. 39), a practical\r\ncourse for Violoncello playing, as well as a long series of Etudes and\r\nExercises. The latter bear the Nos. 22, 25, 35, 40, 44, 45, 46, 48,\r\nand 57. He also edited orchestral and concert studies as well as five\r\nclassical pieces.\r\n\r\nThe same continuity of Violoncello playing as that of the Dresden school\r\ncannot be traced in Vienna because, though at the beginning of our\r\ncentury several cello masters were actively working at the same time,\r\na similar connection did not exist amongst them as in Dresden. But the\r\nAustrian capital had the advantage of a richly endowed musical life\r\nby means of the heroes of instrumental music, which had a quickening\r\nand progressive effect on all branches of executive art, and specially\r\non Violoncello playing. Although this influence was not confined to\r\nVienna alone--since the works of these highly-gifted men, after their\r\npublication, spread over an ever-widening circle--still the musical\r\nworld of Vienna was the chief gainer thereby.\r\n\r\nIt was at the source and therefore had the opportunity of knowing and\r\nstudying the creations of these master composers at first hand. We need\r\nonly recall the Schuppanzigh Art Society, which practised and produced\r\nBeethoven’s Quartets before they were published. The Violoncello was\r\nrepresented at the end of last century and the beginning of the present\r\none by Anton Kraft and, later, by Joseph Linke. For the first Beethoven\r\ncomposed the Cello part of the Triple Concerto (Op. 56). The Sonatas\r\n(Op. 5, 69, and 102) of the great master may be here mentioned as\r\nimportant works of Violoncello Literature.\r\n\r\nANTON KRAFT was born on December 30, 1752, in the little Bohemian town\r\nof Rokitzan. After his school education was finished he entered the\r\nUniversity of Vienna, in order to study law. There he soon began his\r\nmusical career, and, as he had already diligently practised Violoncello\r\nplaying in his father’s house, and had acquired remarkable proficiency,\r\nhe did not find it difficult to procure a position in the Imperial\r\nHofkapelle. Joseph Haydn, to whom he was introduced as clever, appointed\r\nhim, in 1778, to the orchestra of the Prince Esterhazy. As, however,\r\nthis artist-patron died at the end of September, 1790, the band was\r\ndone away with, and Kraft returned again to Vienna, where, in the year\r\n1793, by his conjunction with it, the Schuppanzigh String Quartet was\r\nfounded, which used to play every Friday morning in the house of Prince\r\nLichnowsky. Kraft was himself occupied, however, until 1795, in the band\r\nof Prince Grassalkowitz, and later on in that of the Prince Lobkowitz.\r\nHe died at Vienna on August 20, 1820.\r\n\r\nOf Kraft’s compositions were published--six Sonatas for Violoncello,\r\nwith Bass (Op. 1 and 2); three concerted Duets for Violin and\r\nVioloncello (Op. 3); a Violoncello Concerto, with orchestra (Op. 4); two\r\nDuets for two Violoncellos (Op. 5 and 6), and a Divertissement with\r\nBass.\r\n\r\nAmongst Kraft’s pupils his son, Nicolas, and Birnbach must be mentioned.\r\n\r\nHENRICH AUGUST BIRNBACH, born 1782 at Breslaw, went in 1792 to Berlin,\r\nand there learnt Piano and Violoncello playing. The year 1802 found him\r\nat Vienna, where he enjoyed the instructions of Kraft and was employed\r\nin the opera orchestra. Two years later Count Lubomirski engaged him\r\nfor his private band in Galicia. But in 1806 he returned to Vienna, and\r\nin 1812 he accepted an engagement as first Violoncellist at the Theatre\r\nof Pesth. From 1822 to 1824 he remained at Vienna, occupied himself\r\nzealously with the “Chitarra coll’arco,” invented by a certain Stauffer,\r\nwrote a Concerto for it, and played it in a public assembly. In the\r\nyear 1825 he at length received an appointment in the Hofkapelle at\r\nBerlin. He seems to have belonged to it until his death.\r\n\r\nNICOLAS KRAFT, born at Esterhazy, in Hungary, on December 14, 1778,\r\nbegan his musical practice in his fourth year, on a large tenor which\r\nhe possessed, something like a Violoncello. Two years later he played a\r\nsolo before the Prince Esterhazy, which his father had written specially\r\nfor him with this object in view. At eight years of age he made a tour,\r\naccompanied by his father, and performed at concerts favourably in\r\nVienna, Presburg, Dresden, and Berlin. On his return, the young Kraft\r\nsought to fill up the gaps in his general education, which, until then,\r\nhad been neglected, and this took up five years. During the time he\r\nonly occupied himself with his instrument as a recreation. In 1796 he\r\nentered with his father into the Lobkowitz band. The prince, who took\r\na great interest in the youth, and cherished the wish that he should\r\ncultivate still further his art, granted him the means of going through\r\na course with Louis Duport at Berlin. This happened in the year 1801. He\r\nafterwards went to Holland, in order to be heard there. Prince Esterhazy\r\nmeantime desired his speedy return, so that he could not pursue farther\r\nthe journey he had begun. On his way home, he went to Leipsic, Dresden,\r\nand Prague, exciting great enthusiasm everywhere by his performances.\r\n\r\nNicolas Kraft was engaged in the year 1809 as solo cellist for the\r\nImperial Opera, but retained also his connection with Prince Lobkowitz,\r\nwho offered him a permanent salary, under the condition that he should\r\nnever play anywhere without his permission, except in his Palace. This,\r\nhowever, did not continue, because the Prince fell into serious money\r\ndifficulties from the year 1811, and was no longer free to dispose of\r\nhis ruined fortune. But Kraft was indemnified in another manner. At the\r\nCongress of Princes in 1814, he played before an assemblage of crowned\r\nheads in Vienna, and the King of Wurtemburg experienced such great\r\npleasure at his performances, that he named him his Chamber Virtuoso.\r\nHe now settled at Stuttgard, and thence took a journey, in 1818, to the\r\nRhine, which he extended as far as Hamburg. Here he became acquainted\r\nwith Bernard Romberg, who gave him every encouragement, and showed it\r\nby giving with him two concerts publicly, when he went to Stuttgard in\r\n1820. In the year 1824 Kraft wounded the first finger of his right hand,\r\non account of which, after futile attempts at curing it, he was obliged\r\nto retire. He spent his pension in Stuttgard, where he died on May 18,\r\n1853. Kraft composed for his instrument four Concertos, nine Duets\r\n(three of which are marked as “Divertissements”), a Polonaise, a Bolero,\r\na “Scène pastorale,” a “Rondo à la chasse,” and two Fantasias, of which\r\none is an arrangement of airs from the “Freischütz.” Nicolas Kraft had\r\na son whose Christian name was FRIEDRICH, whom he likewise educated\r\nas a clever cellist. He was born on February 12, 1807, in Vienna, and\r\nbelonged to the Stuttgard band as chamber musician. Nothing further is\r\nknown of him.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time as Anton Kraft, Friedrich’s grandfather, JOSEPH\r\nLINKE, the violoncellist already mentioned, was at work in Vienna for\r\nsome years as a distinguished quartet player. He was born on June\r\n8, 1783, in the Silesian town of Trachenberg, received his first\r\ninstruction from his father, and after his death pursued his studies\r\nunder a certain Oswald. In his twelfth year he went to the Dominicans\r\nat Breslaw. There his teachers in cello playing were Lose and Flemming;\r\nfor theory he studied under the organist Hanish. Lose was a member of\r\nthe theatre orchestra, and when he relinquished the post Linke took\r\nhis place. He remained there, however, only until 1808, when he went\r\nto Vienna. He was engaged immediately by Schuppanzigh for the house\r\nquartet of Count Rasoumowski, which existed until the year 1816. After\r\nthe dissolution of this Society, Linke was attracted to Croatia by the\r\nfamily of Count Erdödisch. Two years later he again appeared in Vienna,\r\nin order to work at the theatre there as soloist. Thirteen years later\r\nhe received an appointment in the same capacity at the Imperial Grand\r\nOpera. His death took place on March 20, 1837.\r\n\r\nLinke’s published cello compositions consist of a Concerto, three books\r\nof Variations, a Polonaise, a “Rondoletto,” and a “Caprice” on Rossini\r\nairs. Whilst the elder Kraft and Linke, whom Beethoven likewise held in\r\ngreat esteem, represented in Vienna violoncello playing from a purely\r\nartistic point of view,\r\n\r\nJOSEPH MERK did so more especially on the virtuoso side. This artist,\r\nborn on January 18, 1795, at Vienna, who was originally to have been a\r\nviolinist, and had already in his younger years made great progress,\r\nhad the misfortune to be bitten so severely by a dog that, even after\r\nthe wound was healed, he was never able again to bring his left arm\r\ninto the requisite position for violin playing. He therefore took\r\nup the Violoncello, on which he received instruction from Philippe\r\nSchindlocker.[114] Under his direction, Merk made such rapid progress\r\nthat already after the lapse of a year he was engaged as quartet player\r\nby a Hungarian magnate. He remained at this post two years, when he\r\nmade a tour through the Austrian dominions in order to make himself\r\nknown in a wider circle. In 1816 he was appointed first Violoncellist\r\nto the Grand Opera at Vienna. Three years later he entered the\r\nImperial Kapelle, and, in 1821, the Professorship for the Violoncello\r\nwas entrusted to him at the Vienna Conservatoire, which institution\r\nlater on acquired such importance in regard to instrumental music.\r\nHe retained the latter office until 1848. In 1834 the Emperor named\r\nhim his chamber virtuoso. Soon after he undertook a prolonged tour,\r\nvisited Prague, Dresden, Leipsic, Brunswick, Hanover, Hamburg, and from\r\nthe last-mentioned town went to London. In Vienna, Merk enjoyed great\r\nfavour. “He was,” C. Hanslick says, in his “History of Vienna Concerted\r\nMusic” (p. 245), “indefatigable as an industrious concert-giver, and\r\ncontinually encouraged by public sympathy. He frequently performed at\r\nConcerts with Mayseder, whose compositions he played by preference, and\r\nmight properly be called the Mayseder of the Violoncello.... Merk also\r\nperformed, as cellist, in Böhm’s quartet productions. As virtuoso he\r\nsoon surpassed Linke as well as Friedrich Wranitzky. The latter, who\r\nwas a son of the violinist and Kapellmeister, Anton Wranitzky, held a\r\nrespectable position among the Viennese cellists of that period, and,\r\nabout his twentieth year, frequently played Duets with his brother, the\r\nviolinist, Anton Wranitzky, at concerts.”\r\n\r\nMerk died in Vienna on July 16, 1852. Of his Violoncello compositions\r\nwere published--one Concerto, one Concertino, one Adagio and Rondo, one\r\nPolonaise, four books of Variations, “Vingt Exercices” (Op. 11), and Six\r\nEtudes (Op. 20). Formerly these compositions were much played, but, in\r\ncourse of time, they have gradually gone out of fashion, like most of\r\nthe Cello productions of that period.\r\n\r\nAmongst Merk’s numerous pupils, the most remarkable are--Böhm, Träg,\r\nMarx, and the Dutchman, Franco-Mendez.\r\n\r\nKARL LEOPOLD BÖHM, born November 4, 1806, at Vienna, profited by Merk’s\r\ninstruction in the Conservatoire there. He was successively member of\r\nthe orchestras of Josephstadt Theatre and of the Vienna Theatre. In\r\nSeptember of the year 1824 he went to Donaueschingen, where he was\r\nappointed musician to the Prince of Fürstenburg. Thence he undertook\r\na successful concert tour to Switzerland and Germany. When in August,\r\n1849, he was released from his engagement in the Donaueschingen Kapelle,\r\nhe went to Strasburg and entered the theatre orchestra, and also\r\nundertook a series of concerts at Vichy. At the beginning of 1851 the\r\namateur Prince of Fürstenburg recalled some of the members of his former\r\nband, in order to organize some chamber music. Amongst them was Böhm,\r\nwho now concluded his artistic career at Donaueschingen. Of his Cello\r\ncompositions he published a Concerto, Duets, Fantasias, Variations,\r\nPolonaises, and some smaller pieces.\r\n\r\nANTON TRÄG, son of a Viennese composer, Andreas Träg, was born in 1818,\r\nat Schwechat, near Vienna; began his musical education at six years of\r\nage, and went to the Conservatoire at Vienna as a pupil of Merk’s. On\r\nFebruary 28, 1845, he was engaged as teacher of Cello playing for the\r\nConservatoire at Prague. Ten years later however he gave up the post and\r\nreturned to Vienna, where he died on July 7, 1860. Träg devoted himself\r\nby special preference to classical music. He had abundant opportunity of\r\noccupying himself with it in the Palace at Clam. Of his pupils,\r\n\r\nHEINRICH RÖVER distinguished himself, who was born May 27, 1827.\r\nRöver belongs to the number of those violoncellists who were at first\r\nviolinists. As early as eight years of age he decided in favour of the\r\nvioloncello. Fétis says of him: “He was about 1863 the cleverest player\r\nof his instrument in Vienna.” Of his compositions may be cited--Idyll\r\n(Op. 1), Mazurka (Op. 8), and “Sérénade du Savoyard” (Op. 11). Röver\r\ndied in 1876.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH M. MARX, born in 1792 at Würzburg, where he also received his\r\nmusical education, began his artistic career as member of the Theatre\r\norchestra at Frankfort-on-the-Main, whence he went to Vienna, in order\r\nto study under Merk. Later on he worked in the Stuttgard orchestra,\r\nuntil he was appointed first Violoncellist at Carlsruhe. He finally\r\nwas musical director there, and died while working in this capacity on\r\nNovember 11, 1836. His daughter, Pauline, made her appearance on the\r\nstage as a singer during the years 1830-40. Concerning FRANCO-MENDEZ,\r\nsee the Cello players of Holland.\r\n\r\nTo the best Viennese violoncellists about the middle of our century\r\nbelongs CARL SCHLESINGER, born on August 19, 1813. The violin was\r\noriginally his instrument. After the lapse of three years he devoted\r\nhimself to the Violoncello. Who his master was is unknown. In 1838 he\r\nwas appointed solo cellist to the Pesth National Theatre. He gave up\r\nthis place in 1846, as the opportunity presented itself of entering the\r\nImperial Opera orchestra in the same capacity at Vienna. In 1862 the\r\noffice of cello teacher at the Conservatoire there was committed to him.\r\nSchlesinger’s most noted pupils are: Udel, Sulzer, Hummer, and Hegyesi.\r\n\r\nCARL UDEL, born on February 6, 1844, at Warasdin, in Croatia, was early\r\ndirected to the study of music by his father, who was Kapellmeister,\r\nand went in September, 1859, to the Conservatoire at Vienna. He next\r\noccupied himself there with violin playing under the guidance of\r\nProfessor Carl Heissler. Twelve months after he took up the Violoncello,\r\nand for five years received instruction from Schlesinger. In 1867 he\r\nwas first Cellist at the opera in Pesth; a year later, however, he\r\nreturned to Vienna and was engaged there, in 1869, for the orchestra\r\nof the new opera house. By degrees he rose in his profession, and in\r\nMay, 1876, he entered the Conservatoire as substitute for Röver, whose\r\nduties were then performed by Hilpert for a year. After the resignation\r\nof the former, Udel was again elected in his place. In 1878 Cello\r\ninstruction at the Conservatoire was divided between him and Hummer, who\r\nin the interval had been nominated first Cello player of the Imperial\r\nHofkapelle. Hummer received the three upper and Udel the three lower\r\nclasses. After three years of work the latter obtained the title of\r\nProfessor. On account of an injured hand, Udel was obliged to give up\r\nhis place as member of the opera house, since when he has not played in\r\npublic. He now devotes himself entirely to teaching.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH SULZER, born on February 11, 1850, at Vienna, emerged in 1869\r\nfrom the Conservatoire as one of Schlesinger’s best pupils, and was\r\nengaged for the Italian Opera, and as master for the Conservatoire\r\nat Bucharest. He remained there four years. In 1875 Sulzer received\r\nan appointment in the Vienna Opera orchestra. Illness, brought on\r\nby over-exertion, compelled him for three years to withdraw from\r\nhis employment in the orchestra. On his recovery he still further\r\nendeavoured to perfect himself, in which the friendly advice of Popper\r\nwas of service to him, and in 1880 he was appointed solo player at\r\nthe Imperial Opera. At the same time he gave concerts and taught. He\r\nbelonged to the Helmsberg Quartet from 1882 to 1885. Sulzer published\r\nvarious compositions and productions for the Violoncello at Breitkopf &\r\nHärtel’s, and D. Rahter’s, and Cranz’.\r\n\r\nREINHOLD HUMMER, born on October 7, 1855, at Linz, on the Danube, began\r\nhis career with violin playing very early at Vienna, where he was\r\nbrought up, and pursued it with great eagerness for six years. Then an\r\nardent desire was awakened in him to learn the Violoncello. He forthwith\r\nbegan the study of that instrument at the Vienna Conservatoire under\r\nSchlesinger’s guidance. At his death, H. Röver became his master. On\r\nthe whole he was four years at the Conservatoire. His progress was so\r\nrapid that he carried off the first prize against his fellow students by\r\nunanimous consent. After he had left the establishment to which he was\r\nindebted for his education, he immediately received an appointment in\r\nthe opera orchestra to which he has belonged since the year 1873. Four\r\nyears later he was appointed teacher at the Conservatoire, and in 1878\r\nsolo Cellist in the Imperial Court band; he was also given the title of\r\nProfessor. Besides his official employments, this much-favoured artist\r\nworked at Vienna and elsewhere as concert and quartet player.\r\n\r\nHegyesi will be mentioned among the Hungarian violoncellists.\r\n\r\nAs an older pupil of the Vienna Conservatoire (1835 to 1839), JOSEPH\r\nHUBER must be mentioned, who was born about 1816 at Vienna. According to\r\nFétis, he was heard during the years 1836 and 1837 at the Conservatoire\r\nConcerts. Several of his Violoncello compositions appeared at Vienna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA succession of excellent German cellists emanated from the Prague\r\nConservatoire, opened in the year 1811. At this Institution JOHANN\r\nNEPOMUK HÜTTNER, born on January 1, 1793, was actively engaged as\r\nVioloncello teacher from 1822. He pursued his studies under J.\r\nZimmermann. After they were concluded Hüttner joined the orchestra\r\nat the Pesth Theatre. Two years later he went to Lemberg. Thence he\r\nundertook, in 1820, a concert tour in Poland and Russia, after which\r\nhe was appointed to the Prague Conservatoire, and the place of first\r\ncellist was immediately given to him at the theatre. His playing was\r\ndistinguished by remarkable skill and delicate tone. In the _Adagio_ his\r\nrendering was full of feeling. Hüttner was specially appreciated as a\r\nquartet player.\r\n\r\nHüttner formed an excellent cellist in his pupil, FRANZ HEGENBARTH, born\r\non May 10, 1818, at Gersdorf, in Bohemia. On May 1, 1831, he entered the\r\nPrague Conservatoire, and remained there as student until May 16, 1837.\r\nCount Kinsky provided him with the means for his artistic education.\r\nIn May, 1865, the Professorship at the Prague Conservatoire was given\r\nto Hegenbarth; it had until then been in the hands of Moritz Wagner,\r\nGoltermann’s successor. He devoted himself to this until his death,\r\nwhich occurred on December 20, 1887.\r\n\r\nBesides several other compositions, Hegenbarth wrote a Violoncello\r\nschool, though nothing at all of his has been published. Amongst his\r\npupils the following are distinguished: Lang, Grünfeld, and Wihan.\r\n\r\nANTON LANG, born on November 10, 1850, at Carlsbad, from his tenth year\r\nplayed both the Piano and Violin, but decided at thirteen in favour of\r\nthe Violoncello. In 1865 he became Hegenbarth’s pupil in the Prague\r\nConservatoire. When his training was ended Lang was employed as solo\r\nplayer in several concert orchestras. Since 1877 he has been attached to\r\nthe Grand Ducal Kapelle in Schwerin as first cellist, with the title of\r\n“Kammer Virtuoso.”\r\n\r\nHEINRICH GRÜNFELD, born on April 21, 1855, at Prague, went to the\r\nConservatoire there, and profited by the instructions of Hegenbarth.\r\nIn 1873 he became solo cellist at the comic opera at Vienna and filled\r\nthis place for two years. In 1876 he went to Berlin, where he worked\r\nas teacher of his instrument. From time to time he undertook some\r\nsuccessful concert tours in Germany, Russia, and Austria, with his\r\nbrother Alfred. Everywhere his beautiful tone and his tasteful rendering\r\nwere appreciated.\r\n\r\nHANS WIHAN, born on June 5, 1855, at Politz, in Bohemia, is likewise\r\na pupil of the Prague Conservatoire, which he frequented from 1868\r\nuntil 1873. At the end of this period he studied for awhile under the\r\ndirection of Davidoff. His excellent performances procured for him the\r\nposition of first Violoncellist in the Hofkapelle at Munich, which\r\nhe filled for eight years with honour. In the spring of 1888 he was\r\nnominated to the Professorship of the Prague Conservatoire as successor\r\nto his master, Hegenbarth.\r\n\r\nAnother of Hüttner’s pupils, SELMAR BAGGE, must be cited, born on June\r\n30, 1823, at Coburg.[115] He received his musical education from the\r\nyear 1837 at the Prague Conservatoire, and after he had pursued a course\r\nof composition under Simon Sechter, became a teacher of the theory at\r\nthe Vienna Conservatoire. He relinquished this post in the year 1855,\r\nand from that time was chiefly engaged in composition, until in 1868 he\r\nwas summoned to Basle as Director of the music school.\r\n\r\nAmongst Hüttner’s pupils there is also a gifted dilettante, Joseph\r\nEdler von Portheim, born on January 6, 1817, at Prague. For many years\r\nhe has deserved the thanks of the musical world in his native town by\r\nhis zealous encouragement of chamber music, not only in his hospitable\r\nhouse, frequented by native and foreign artists, but also abroad. Since\r\nthe foundation of the Prague Chamber Music Society (1876), he has been\r\nat the head of the undertaking, to which he devotes his indefatigable\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThree other pupils of the Prague Conservatoire must be noticed in this\r\nplace. EBERT, CABISIUS, and POPPER. They all had the benefit of Joh.\r\nAugust Jul. Goltermann’s[116] instruction, who from 1850-1862, as\r\nsuccessor to Träg, was teacher at the above-named establishment. (See\r\npage 123.)\r\n\r\nLUDWIG EBERT, born on April 13, 1834, at Schloss Kladrau, in Bohemia,\r\nbegan early his musical training in the home of his father, who was\r\nroyal treasurer of Windischgratz, and was sent in 1846 to Prague in\r\norder to study at the Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nAt first he received instruction from Träg. But when he went to Vienna,\r\nEbert studied two years more under Goltermann’s direction. From the\r\nautumn of 1852 until Easter, 1854, he was cellist at the opera in\r\nTemesvar, and was then engaged as first performer of his instrument\r\nfor the Oldenburg Hofkapelle, where he worked up to the year 1874.\r\nInvested with the title of Concertmaster by the Grand Duke, as a mark\r\nof distinction, Ebert, in the same year, accepted the offer of being\r\nfirst cellist of the Gürzenich orchestra in Cologne, and teacher at the\r\nConservatoire of the Rhenish metropolis. In this place he remained until\r\nApril 1, 1888. At present Ebert is living at Wiesbaden, where he devotes\r\nhimself to teaching. He has published “Four pieces” for Violoncello and\r\nPiano in the form of a Sonata (Op. 3), and three “Charakterstücke” (Op.\r\n7).\r\n\r\nJULIUS CABISIUS, born October 15, 1841, at Halle-on-the-Saal, received\r\nhis first instruction from his father. During the years 1855-1861, he\r\nstudied under Goltermann at the Prague Conservatoire. He then became a\r\nmember of the Court Kapelle at Löwenberg and Meiningen. From the latter\r\nplace he was summoned, in 1877, to be first Cellist in the royal band at\r\nStuttgard.\r\n\r\nDAVID POPPER, born on June 18, 1845 or 1846, in Prague, soon gained\r\nfor himself, after leaving the Conservatoire of his native town, a\r\nremarkable reputation during the concert tours, which he began in the\r\nyear 1863 as an excellent and cultivated solo player. He received\r\nspecial honour, in 1865, at the Carlsruhe Musical Festival, and in 1867,\r\nin Vienna, where, from 1868, he was engaged as first cellist at the\r\nImperial Opera. In 1873 he gave up this post, in order to undertake, in\r\ncompany with his wife, the famous pianist, Sophie Menter, some concert\r\ntours, which led him into Germany, France, England, and Russia. He is\r\nat present teacher at the Pesth Conservatoire. Popper’s playing is\r\ndistinguished by its very pure and extremely clever technique, as well\r\nas by a refined, graceful manner of rendering. He published for the\r\nVioloncello two Concertos (Op. 8 and 24), two Suites (Op. 16 and 50), as\r\nwell as a considerable number of smaller drawing-room pieces, which are\r\nin much favour among cellists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, as we saw, a great influence was exercised by France through\r\nthe brothers Duport,[117] but in consequence of the political events\r\nof the years 1806-1807, which were the cause of so much suffering in\r\nPrussia, it was almost paralysed, for Louis Duport returned to France\r\non the outbreak of the war declared by Napoleon Buonaparte; and his\r\nelder brother, who on account of his advanced age could no longer occupy\r\nhimself with Violoncello playing, went at the same time into retirement.\r\nIt is, however, possible and even probable that the Violoncellist,\r\n\r\nJOHANN FRIEDRICH KELZ, born on April 11, 1786, at Berlin, if he did\r\nnot actually take regular lessons from him, was able to profit by his\r\noccasional advice.[118]\r\n\r\nHis first years of study were spent by Kelz chiefly with the town\r\nmusician, Fuchs, under whose direction he occupied himself with\r\nwell-nigh every kind of musical instrument, amongst which the\r\nVioloncello attracted him most. His uncle, Ad. Friedrich Milke, who was\r\nhimself not a bad cellist, assisted his progress on that instrument.\r\nHe also provided for his reception into the band of Prince Frederick\r\nAugust of Brunswick-Öls, to which he belonged, from the year 1801, for\r\nfour years. When this prince died, in 1805, Kelz returned to Berlin, and\r\nwas nominated, in 1811, Royal Chamber Musician. In 1857 he went into\r\nretirement, and died in January, 1862. He must have been much in request\r\nas teacher of his instrument. His compositions, the number of which it\r\nis pretended extend to about three hundred, are of a very superficial\r\ndescription, and have long fallen into oblivion.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable than Kelz in Violoncello playing was MORITZ GANZ,\r\nwho was born at Mayence in the year 1804, and learnt the elements of\r\nmusic from his father. In Violoncello playing he made further progress\r\nunder the Bohemian Cellist, Stiastny, who at that time was residing\r\nat Frankfort-on-the-Maine. Ganz then joined the orchestra at Mayence\r\nuntil, in 1826, he was appointed first Violoncellist in the Berlin\r\nKapelle. During this engagement he undertook, in the years 1833-1837,\r\nconcert tours to Paris and London. In appreciation of his performances\r\nhe received from the King of Prussia the title of Concertmaster. His\r\nplaying, which gave proof of solid cultivation, was artistic and in\r\nevery respect made an advantageous impression, without, however,\r\nelectrifying. His compositions are unpretending, and consist of\r\nConcertos, Duets, and Variations.\r\n\r\nAmong the pupils educated by Ganz the most remarkable are--Rietz, Lotze,\r\nGiese, and Klietz.\r\n\r\nJULIUS RIETZ, born on December 28, 1812, at Berlin, had, besides Ganz,\r\nalso Bernhard Romberg for a short time as master, and developed so\r\nrapidly that, as early as sixteen years of age, he was received into the\r\norchestra of the Royal Stadt-Theatre of his native town.\r\n\r\nSix years later he went to Düsseldorf, and worked as assistant-director\r\nat the theatre managed by Immermann, with Mendelssohn at its head;\r\nwhen the latter retired he undertook the sole conduct of the opera,\r\nand became also, when Mendelssohn was summoned to Leipsic, town Music\r\nDirector. He filled this place until 1847, in which year he went to\r\nsettle at Leipsic, in order to work as “Capellmeister” at the theatre.\r\nHis work so greatly increased at Leipsic--for he not only undertook the\r\ndirection of the Academy of Singing, but also, in 1848, the conducting\r\nof the Gewandhaus Concerts--that he was obliged more and more to\r\nneglect cello playing. In Dresden, whither Rietz went in 1860 as Court\r\nKapellmeister, he almost entirely discontinued performing. In private\r\ncircles only he now and then caused his instrument to be heard, as his\r\ntime was wholly taken up by his official occupations, as well as by the\r\ndirection of the Dresden Conservatoire, which was given over to him, and\r\nby the editorial labours connected with the publication of the collected\r\nworks of the great classical composers, set on foot by Breitkopf and\r\nHärtel. In the midst of this varied artistic activity he died on\r\nSeptember 17, 1877.\r\n\r\nRietz’s Violoncello playing was of an able but simply deserving kind\r\nand was limited entirely to the more classical sphere of music. His\r\ncompositions consist of two Concertos and a Fantasia with orchestral\r\naccompaniment. He produced the latter on February 15, 1844, in the\r\nGewandhaus, at Leipsic.\r\n\r\nWILHELM LOTZE, born on January 17, 1817, at Berlin, acquired the first\r\nelements of cello playing under the royal chamber musician, Töpfer\r\n(1865), and then Ganz was his master. In 1837 he received an appointment\r\nin the Royal Kapelle of his native town, and from 1838-1852 belonged to\r\nthe excellent Zimmermann String Quartet. Lotze was pensioned in 1872.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH GIESE, born on November 24, 1821, at Coblenz on the Rhine,\r\nundertook concert journeys through France and Switzerland after he had\r\nfor some time profited by the instruction of Ganz; he then went to the\r\nHague, where he became teacher at the Royal School of Music and first\r\nVioloncellist at the French Theatre. He educated a large number of\r\npupils. Amongst them we shall mention only his son,\r\n\r\nFRITZ GIESE, who was born on January 2, 1859, at the Hague. At ten years\r\nof age he was so forward that he was able publicly to perform Romberg’s\r\nsecond Concerto. He completed his studies under Grützmacher in Dresden\r\nand under Jacquard in Paris. After he had made a journey through Sweden\r\nand Denmark, he was for a year soloist in the Amsterdam Park orchestra,\r\nand then entered, as a member, into the Mendelssohn Quintet Club of\r\nBoston. As one of the chief supporters he took part for a long time in\r\nthe annual concert journeys of the Society, which extended to North\r\nAmerica and Australia. At present he is living as a soloist at Boston.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the above-mentioned pupils of Ganz, MAGNUS KLIETZ, born\r\non April 29, 1828, at Altenkirchen, on the Island of Rügen, began his\r\nmusical career at fourteen as a pupil of the Greifswalder town music\r\ndirector, Abel. After a year’s instruction on the violin and various\r\nwood-wind instruments, he decided on learning the Violoncello, which\r\nhe chose as his principal instrument. In 1848 he went to Berlin to the\r\nConcertmaster Ganz, pursued his studies under him for a year, and then\r\nselected Hamburg as his settled place of residence. In 1850 he was\r\nappointed first cellist at the Stadt-Theatre as successor to Joh. Aug.\r\nJul. Goltermann. In this position he remained seventeen years, giving\r\nlessons as well. He then joined the Philharmonic orchestra and was one\r\nof the founders of the Quartet Union now existing in Hamburg.\r\n\r\nAfter him, as a remarkable Berlin violoncellist, must be mentioned\r\nJULIUS STAHLKNECHT, born on March 17, 1817, in Posen. Both Drews and\r\nWranitzki were his masters. Their method of instruction must have\r\nbeen good, for as early as twenty-one years of age (1838) Stahlknecht\r\nwas so far educated that he was admitted into the Berlin Hofkapelle.\r\nHe undertook later, in company with his brother Adolf, who was a\r\nrespectable violin player, a concert tour; and with him and the addition\r\nof the pianist Carl Albert Löschhorn, from 1844 or 1846, he gave for\r\nsome years, Trio Soirées, which were very popular with the Berlin\r\npublic. After the death of Ganz he stepped into his place with the title\r\nof “Concertmeister.” In 1881 he was pensioned. He had as his successor\r\nthe Cello virtuoso, Louis Lübeck. Of Cello compositions he published\r\ntwo Concertos and several smaller pieces besides--as, for example,\r\nDivertissements (Op. 3), a Fantasia (Op. 6), Three Pieces with Piano\r\n(Op. 8) and a “Serénade Espagnole” (Op. 11).\r\n\r\nStahlknecht formed an excellent cellist in ALBERT RÜDEL, who was born\r\non February 29, 1840, at Wittstock in East Priegnitz, where his father\r\nwas musical Director. During the years 1859-1867 he pursued his studies\r\nat Berlin, under Stahlknecht. On June 1, 1867, he was appointed Royal\r\nChamber Musician, and in the year 1880 solo Cellist of the Hofkapelle.\r\nRüdel often had the honour from that time of being admitted to take\r\npart in the Royal Concerts. Kaiser William I. liked his playing,\r\nand repeatedly expressed to him his approbation. Amongst Rüdel’s\r\ncompositions for the Violoncello must be mentioned: Romance (B major),\r\nElegie (D minor), Introduction, Andante e Tempo di Valse, four Fantasias\r\nfor Concert-room, and many little Drawing-room pieces for pupils. All\r\nthese productions have a piano accompaniment.\r\n\r\nVioloncello playing received a fresh impulse in Berlin by the opening,\r\nunder the direction of Joachim, of a section of the Royal High School,\r\non October 1, 1869, for executive music. The Belgian cellist, JULES DE\r\nSWERT, was one of the first to give the necessary instruction at the\r\nabove-named Institute. WILHELM MÜLLER succeeded him from 1873-1876 in\r\nthis office. Both masters were, however, at the establishment too short\r\na time to pave the way for any important results. These were first\r\nattained by means of Hausmann’s appointment, who since the year 1876 has\r\nbeen working as teacher of Violoncello playing at the Berlin High\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nROBERT HAUSMANN, born on August 23, 1852, at Rottleberode, in the\r\nHarz, frequented the Gymnasium at Brunswick, and benefited there,\r\nfrom 1861-1867, by the Violoncello instruction of Theodor Müller, who\r\nadvanced him considerably. He was then _Elève_ of the Berlin High\r\nSchool for Music, and there prosecuted his studies for three years,\r\nunder the direction of Wilhelm Müller, nephew of the Brunswick master\r\njust mentioned. Finally, he went to Piatti, and under him pursued a\r\ncourse in London, and later on at his property at Caddenabia, on Lake\r\nComo. Shortly after Hausmann took an engagement with Count Hochberg,\r\nin Silesia, as Cellist of the string quartet formed by him, and after\r\nthis was dissolved, in 1876, he was named second master of Cello playing\r\nat the Berlin High School for Music; three years later he rose to the\r\nposition of regular teacher, and from that time he fulfilled the duties\r\nalone in his own department. In 1884 he received the title of Professor\r\nin acknowledgment of his deserving work.\r\n\r\nHausmann at the present time belongs to the most eminent masters of his\r\ninstrument. He is not only a distinguished solo player, but also an\r\nexcellent quartet player, which is evident from the fact that Joachim\r\nhas chosen him as his usual quartet associate. Of the pupils formed\r\nby Hausmann, until now the following have specially distinguished\r\nthemselves: Roth, Dechert, Prill, Koch, and Lüdemann.\r\n\r\nPHILIPP ROTH, born on October 25, 1853, at Tarnowitz, in Upper Silesia,\r\noccupied himself in his father’s house from his eighth to his twelfth\r\nyear with violin playing, and then went over to the Violoncello. After\r\nhe had for some time applied himself to quartet playing with his\r\nbrothers, he became the pupil of Wilhelm Müller, and later on of Robert\r\nHausmann, at the Berlin High School for Music. He soon took part in\r\nthe lessons, conducted by Joachim, in quartet and orchestra playing,\r\nand also pursued the study of composition under Wilh. Taubert and\r\nWoldemar Bargiel. Settled in Berlin for eighteen years, he only left\r\nthe capital in order to make concert tours, of which he undertook one\r\nthree years ago into Russia. He, however, has devoted his powers chiefly\r\nto teaching. Roth has also been zealous in the publication of Cello\r\nliterature. Besides his original compositions, he has published a long\r\nlist of various kinds of attractive music pieces as arrangements for\r\nVioloncello and Piano, as well as a Violoncello school and a “Guide\r\nto Violoncello Literature,” which latter has also been published\r\nseparately.[119] This list, which ought to be recommended, will, it is\r\nhoped, be continued and completed in later editions without delay.\r\n\r\nHUGO DECHERT, born September 16, 1860, in Potschappel, near Dresden,\r\nreceived from his father, who is a musician, instructions in violin\r\nplaying at six years of age, and from his twelfth year in Cello playing.\r\nUntil 1875 he profited by the instruction of the chamber musician,\r\nHeinrich Tietz, in Dresden. Then began Dechert’s practical work. At\r\nfirst he was for a year first Cellist in the orchestra of the Belvedere,\r\non the Brühl Terrace, at Dresden, and then, after some concert tours in\r\nSaxony and Silesia, he was engaged at a Concert Orchestra in Warsaw.\r\nIn 1887 he went to Berlin. There he had the good fortune, by the\r\nacquisition of a scholarship as well as by getting free instruction in\r\nthe High School for Music, to pursue and complete his studies under the\r\ndirection of Rob. Hausmann. Since 1881 he has belonged to the Royal\r\nKapelle at Berlin, and he is also occupied as a much-appreciated concert\r\nand quartet player as well as teacher.\r\n\r\nPAUL PRILL, born October 1, 1860, at Berlin, received from his father,\r\na royal Prussian military bandmaster, his first lessons both in piano\r\nand violin playing. Later on the musical director, W. Handwerg,\r\nundertook his instruction on the piano, and the chamber musician, W.\r\nSturm, the theoretical part. At the same time Paul Prill occupied\r\nhimself in learning the “Cornet à piston” with his father. Only in his\r\nseventeenth year, after he had been performing at concerts with his\r\nbrother and sister under the conduct of his father in Germany, was\r\nfulfilled his cherished wish to devote himself to Violoncello playing.\r\nIn this the chamber musician, Mahnecke, assisted him by giving him\r\ngratuitous instruction. After a lapse of nine months he had made such\r\nrapid progress on the Violoncello that, having undergone a previous\r\nexamination, he was received as a free pupil into the High School for\r\nMusic. He frequented it for four years, and then entered the so-called\r\nmaster class, conducted by Bargiel, in order to perfect himself in the\r\ntheoretical department; but at the same time he also benefited further\r\nby Hausmann’s tuition. He soon found an appointment as solo cellist\r\nin the Berlin Symphony Kapelle, as well as in the orchestra of the\r\nItalian Opera. From the beginning of September, 1882, until the end of\r\nApril, 1885, he worked as solo cellist in the “Bilse Orchestra.” Such\r\noccupation did not suit him for a continuance; he aimed higher, and\r\ndesired to devote himself to the conducting branch of music. After Bilse\r\nhad dissolved his orchestra, he found an engagement as Director at the\r\nBelle Alliance Theatre, in Berlin. Occasionally also he performed the\r\noffice of Conductor at the Wallner Theatre. This work, however, did\r\nnot have the hoped-for result, as there seemed no prospect of a more\r\nremunerative sphere of conducting. Paul Prill then determined to accept\r\nthe place of solo cellist at the German Opera at Rotterdam. With this\r\nthe advantageous offer was made to him of performing at concerts in and\r\naround Rotterdam, yet he did not lose sight of his ambition in regard to\r\nthe career of Conductor. His wish was fulfilled, for during some time he\r\nhas been second Kapellmeister of the Rotterdam Opera.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH KOCH, descended from a well-known Berlin family of painters,\r\nwas born on July 3, 1862, and began his musical studies in his eleventh,\r\nbut Violoncello playing only in his fourteenth year. From 1879-1882\r\nhe was pupil of the Royal High School of Music, and specially under\r\nHausmann, as well as Succo and Bargiel for theory and composition. In\r\nthe summer of 1883 he was named Royal Chamber Musician, after he had\r\nbeen submitted to a trial performance. In 1886 he founded, with three\r\nof his colleagues, a string quartet, which within a short period has\r\ngained a respected position in the Berlin musical world. Of Koch’s Cello\r\ncompositions only two, Op. 1 and 2, up to the present time have\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nOTTO LÜDEMANN, born on September 7, 1864, at Bernkastel, on the Mosel,\r\nafter his father had prepared him, was from 1876-1880 Ebert’s pupil in\r\nthe Cologne Conservatoire, to whom he is indebted for part of his other\r\nartistic education. At the beginning of 1880 he went to the Berlin High\r\nSchool of Music, and benefited by Hausmann’s instruction, not only in\r\ncompulsory piano playing but in the theory of music until 1883. In\r\nthis year he took part in the playing competition for the possession\r\nof a vacant cello place in the Royal Prussian Kapelle, in which he\r\nsucceeded so well that in the autumn of the year 1884 he was nominated\r\nRoyal Chamber Musician. Besides his official duty he was selected by\r\nhis master, Hausmann, to be his assistant in the High School of Music,\r\nand also commissioned to prepare his advanced Cello pupils for the\r\nupper classes--a proof of how highly his performances were appreciated.\r\nAmongst others belonging to the older and more modern of Berlin\r\nvioloncellists are Griebel and Espenhahn.\r\n\r\nJULIUS GRIEBEL, born on October 25, 1809, at Berlin, learnt cello\r\nplaying of his father, who was bassoon player in the Hofkapelle there.\r\nAs Max Bohrer belonged to it, he also received instruction from him.\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1827 Griebel was taken into the orchestra\r\nand rose to be solo cellist next to Ganz. During the years 1835-1841 he\r\nundertook successful journeys to Holland, and later on he visited also\r\nDenmark. As chamber music player he found opportunity of distinguishing\r\nhimself in the Zimmermann Quartet, of which he had been permanent\r\ncellist for many years since 1835. He died in 1865.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, HERMANN JACOBOWSKY, born on October 19, 1846, in Neustrelitz,\r\nreceived instruction in piano playing during his school years from\r\nhis father, who was clarinetist of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz Court\r\nband. At sixteen years of age he decided for the musical profession,\r\nchose the Violoncello as his instrument, and went to Berlin in order\r\nto take lessons from Griebel; at the same time Rich. Wuerst was his\r\nmaster in theory. In 1864 Jacobowsky entered as solo cellist into the\r\nLiebig “Symphonie Kapelle.” Six years later he was summoned to Jassy as\r\nteacher of cello playing at the music school, but when the Franco-German\r\nWar broke out he had to hasten to the standard, and took part in the\r\ncampaign. When it was over, he received a place as Chamber Musician in\r\nthe Royal orchestra, which had already been promised to him in 1868,\r\nconsequent on a successful competition.\r\n\r\nJacobowsky has not only made himself known to advantage as solo player,\r\nbut also in connection with the Soirées in which he takes part with\r\nHans Bishoff and Waldemar Meyer. Besides some Drawing-room Pieces\r\nfor Violoncello, he published “Tonleiterübungen in fünf Stufen” and\r\ntwenty-two Elementary Exercises in the first position.\r\n\r\nL. ESPENHAHN, born at Sandersleben, was at first member of the Dessau\r\nCourt band, but entered as assistant into the Prussian Hofkapelle, after\r\nhe had appeared in Berlin as a solo player. He did not, however, remain\r\nin this place, but accepted an invitation to join the private band of\r\nthe Russian Prince Narischkin. After the death of the latter, he was\r\nagain received into the Berlin Kapelle. Since 1852 he has belonged to\r\nthe Zimmermann String Quartet, as successor to Griebel. He was also\r\noccupied as teacher in Berlin. Espenhahn died in the year 1879.\r\n\r\nFor Munich during the first quarter of our century the chief\r\nrepresentative of Violoncello playing was PHILIPP MORALT.[120] He\r\nbelonged to a gifted Bavarian musical family, whose members were\r\nemployed in the Munich Court Kapelle. This family possessed in JOSEPH\r\nMORALT a second younger Cellist. Nothing further is known about him\r\nexcept the fact of his performing so well that he was admitted into the\r\nLeipsic Gewandhaus Concert on January 21, 1847, for solo playing.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH MENTER, however, who received his education from the elder of\r\nthe two Moralts just named, had a greater artistic importance. Born\r\non January 17, 1808, in the Bavarian village of Daudenkofen, near\r\nLandshut, he began as so many of his colleagues did, with the violin,\r\nbut soon abandoned it to take up the Violoncello. He had scarcely\r\ncompleted his twenty-first year before he found a position in the\r\nHohenzollern-Hechingen band. In 1833 his vocation took him to Munich. He\r\nbelonged to the Kapelle there until his death, which occurred on April\r\n18, 1856. Menter--he is the father of the well-known Piano virtuosa of\r\nthat name--made himself known outside his sphere of work by concert\r\ntours in Germany, Austria, Holland, Belgium, and England, as well as\r\nby several Cello compositions, of which a few were published after his\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\nMenter formed several good Cellists, amongst them the best is--\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTE MÜLLER. He was born on May 16, 1834, at Hilburghausen, and\r\nreceived his first instruction from his father. His development was so\r\nrapid that, at eleven years of age, he already appeared as soloist. He\r\nwas assigned to Menter for further cultivation, by whose assistance he\r\nbecame a master of his art. In 1854 Müller joined the Munich Court Band\r\nas first Cellist. He also undertook the tuition at the Conservatoire.\r\nOn August 23, 1876, he died at Munich. His pupil,\r\n\r\nGEBHARD GRAF, for fourteen years first Violoncellist in the Grand Ducal\r\nKapelle at Brunswick, was born on February 4, 1843, at Waal, near\r\nBuchloe, in Bavaria, and attended, from his fifteenth year, the Royal\r\nConservatoire at Munich. He was dismissed from it at the end of four\r\nyears with a certificate of merit, and then held concerts in Hamburg,\r\nWarsaw, Amsterdam, Frankfort, and Munich. Later, he was six years as\r\nsolo Cellist in the Princes’ Kapelle at Sondershausen, worked with the\r\nBilse Orchestra for one year as first Cellist, and after that time had\r\nelapsed he took an engagement in the Grand Ducal Kapelle at Strelitz.\r\nThence he was summoned to Brunswick.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND BÜCHLER is also an excellent pupil of Menter’s, born on\r\nMarch 17, 1817, at Darmstadt, where his father was Grand Ducal chamber\r\nmusician. As his first instructor he had the Darmstadt Concertmaster,\r\nAUGUST DANIEL MANGOLD, born in July, 1775, at Darmstadt. He was a very\r\ndistinguished artist on his instrument, of the Romberg school, and\r\nbelonged to the Darmstadt orchestra from 1814 until his death, which\r\nhappened in 1842. Büchler got on well under Mangold’s training, but\r\nwent, in order to perfect himself, to Jos. Menter, whom he had met\r\nduring the winter of 1838-1839, at the Munich Quartet Soirées, when he\r\nhad undertaken a concert tour to Vienna. Having returned to Darmstadt he\r\nagain found an appointment in the band there to which he had belonged\r\nprevious to his absence in Munich, and was named first Cellist. An\r\ninjured arm, which was never entirely cured, compelled Büchler to\r\nwithdraw from playing in public as a soloist, though he still continued\r\nas a chamber music player. In 1881, after forty-six years’ service, he\r\nwas pensioned.\r\n\r\nBüchler pursued his theoretical studies under the guidance of the\r\nDarmstadt Cantor, Rinck. They enabled him to compose a few cello pieces\r\nwhich may be favourably distinguished from amongst others. This is\r\nespecially the case with regard to his five Studies; they are of value\r\nparticularly for the purposes of teaching, and consequently are admitted\r\ninto many music schools. Besides these, he wrote two pieces for\r\nfour Violoncellos, and transcribed also three pieces from Alessandro\r\nStradella’s Cantatas. At present there are now in the press arrangements\r\nof twenty-five pieces of ancient and modern masters with the title\r\n“Bunte Reihe.”\r\n\r\nVALENTIN MÜLLER, born on February 14, 1830, at Münster, in Westphalia,\r\nstudied with Menter, and continued under Servais, in Brussels, in 1848.\r\nDuring his many years’ residence in the Belgian capital, he performed\r\nfor some time the functions of Deputy-Professor at the Conservatoire. In\r\n1858 he betook himself to Paris and filled the place of Chevillard[121]\r\nin the Maurin Quartet. Ten years later he accepted a post at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Maine, where he worked as member of the Quartet of the\r\nMuseum Society, and as master at the Hoch Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH WERNER, born on June 25, 1837, at Würzburg, was, in 1852, _Elève_\r\nof the Munich Conservatoire, and educated himself there as Violoncellist\r\nunder Menter’s direction. In the year 1867 he went to Dresden to Fr.\r\nGrützmacher in order to become better acquainted with his method of\r\ninstruction. After he had been solo cellist in the Court Kapelle at\r\nMunich, he became teacher at the music school, and later on he received\r\nthe title of Royal Chamber Musician and Professor, which proves that he\r\nwas particularly esteemed in the music world of Munich.\r\n\r\nIn compositions Werner published a Quartet for four Violoncellos,\r\nStudies, Etudes, Caprices, Solos, a book of Songs, as well as an\r\ninstruction book, with Piano accompaniment, under the title of\r\n“Practical Violoncello School.” With regard to this the Munich\r\n_Allgemeine Zeitung_, of September 12, 1886, remarks: “Concerning\r\nthis School, which is entirely devoid of theory--_i.e._, thoroughly\r\npractical--there exist a whole list of witnesses from celebrated\r\nauthorities of that branch of Art, such as C. Davidoff, in St.\r\nPetersburg, Jos. Rheinberger, Louis Abel, and so forth, as well as\r\nmany recommendations (from the Bavarian Ministry of Instruction) and\r\nacknowledgments in the musical periodicals of the time on the subject.\r\nAll are unanimous that the above-named work must be considered in every\r\nway the best instruction book amongst those of the highest rank.” The\r\nCello School of Werner has gone through five editions already since its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAmongst Werner’s numberless pupils we can only here cite HEINRICH\r\nSCHÜBEL, at Carlsruhe; H. SCHÖNCHEN, in Munich; EMIL HERBECK, at St.\r\nPetersburg; FRL. MARIE GEIST and CARL EBNER, in Munich. The last-named\r\nartist, born on November 6, 1857, in Deggendorf, near Munich, is Royal\r\nBavarian Chamber Musician, and takes part in the Trio Soirées, which are\r\nheld annually with the co-operation of Bussmayer and Walter, in Munich.\r\nHis Violoncello compositions, published as Op. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 14,\r\nbelong to the Salon _genre_.\r\n\r\nMeiningen possessed a very distinguished Violoncellist in GUSTAVE KNOOP,\r\nwho was born at Göttingen in 1805, and was member of the Meiningen Court\r\norchestra. He must have been, in regard to beauty of tone, a successful\r\nrival of Romberg. It is related of him that he only married in order\r\nto get into his possession a valuable Violoncello which belonged to\r\nhis wife; that soon after the wedding he set out on a journey with the\r\ninstrument, and did not return home again. It is a fact that Knoop went\r\nto North America in 1843, and on December 25, 1849, he ended his life at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nOf Knoop’s pupils two are worth mentioning: Grabau and Mollenhauer.\r\n\r\nJOHAN ANDREAS GRABAU, born October 19, 1809, had, after benefiting by\r\nKnoop’s instruction, Fr. Kummer as his master for a time. He chose\r\nLeipsic as his settled residence, but only worked at his vocation until\r\nhis marriage, which made it possible for him to pursue music for his\r\npleasure only. He remained, however, until his death, which occurred\r\nin August, 1886, a member of the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Grabau was less\r\noccupied with solo than with quartet playing, in which he was a much\r\nesteemed performer.\r\n\r\nHEINRICH MOLLENHAUER, born on September 10, 1825, at Erfurt, was from\r\nhis fourth year taught piano and violin playing, and when only a\r\nhalf-grown boy he made, with his brothers, under his father’s guidance,\r\na concert tour through Germany. He later devoted himself, under Knoop’s\r\ndirection, to Violoncello playing with great success. Mollenhauer\r\nbelonged for three years, from 1853, to the Royal band at Stockholm,\r\nand then turned to New York. After he had travelled through the North\r\nAmerican States as a Concert-giver, he settled down, in 1867, at\r\nBrooklyn, and founded there a music school.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of chamber music the best performer was the Cellist of\r\nthe formerly famous MÜLLER STRING QUARTET, whose name was THEODORE. He\r\nwas born on September 27, 1802, in Brunswick, and died there on May 22,\r\n1875. He is described as the very soul of the Quartet Band, which with\r\nhis brothers Carl (1st Violin), Georg (2nd Violin), and Gustave (Tenor),\r\nhe so carefully kept together for so many years, the most brilliant\r\nperiod of which was from 1831-1855. During this time the brothers Müller\r\nundertook journeys into Germany, Holland, Denmark, and Russia, which\r\nwere crowned with fame. They were also heard in Paris.\r\n\r\nAs is known, the Müller String Quartet was continued by the sons of\r\nCharles, the eldest of the brothers, who belonged as Concert Master to\r\nthe Ducal Kapelle of Brunswick. The Violoncellist of the junior Quartet\r\nBand was--\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MÜLLER, born on June 1, 1834, in Brunswick. He had his uncle,\r\nTheodore, as his master. After he had been working with his brothers in\r\nthe Meiningen orchestra, as well as in Wiesbaden and Rostock, he entered\r\nthe Berlin Court Kapelle as solo cellist, and also undertook the Cello\r\ninstruction in the Royal High School for Music. In this position he\r\nremained three years, when he went to America. From that time there is\r\nno more account of him.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, EUGEN SANDOW, born on September 11, 1856, in Berlin, occupied\r\nhimself from his sixth to his eighth year, under the direction of\r\nhis father, with violin playing; gave it up however in favour of the\r\nVioloncello, and had as his next teacher the royal chamber musician,\r\nA. Rohne. In 1870 he was taken into the High School for Music, and was\r\nthere, from 1873 to 1876, Müller’s pupil. In April of the year 1879\r\nensued his appointment as Chamber Musician in the Royal band.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the present century Hamburg has been\r\ndistinguished by excellent cellists. Foremost must be brought forward\r\nhere--\r\n\r\nJOHANN NIKOLAUS PRELL. He was born on November 6, 1773, in Hamburg,\r\nand earned the thanks of the musical world there especially by the\r\ninstitution of regular Quartet Academies. He died on March 18, 1849. His\r\nson--\r\n\r\nAUGUST CHRISTIAN PRELL, under Romberg’s direction, whose last pupil\r\nhe was, reached a high degree of art. An extremely beautiful and\r\ngrand style of playing lent his performance a classic stamp. Already\r\nat twelve years old he could perform in public. Four years later the\r\npost of Chamber Musician in Meiningen was offered to him, and in 1824\r\nhe received a summons to Hanover as first Cellist of the Hofkapelle\r\nthere, to which he belonged until February 1, 1869, when he went into\r\nretirement. He was born on August 1, 1805, and died on September 3,\r\n1885, in Hanau. His fine Amati Violoncello passed into the possession of\r\nGrützmacher.\r\n\r\nIn GEORG EDUARD GOLTERMANN, born on August 19, 1824, at Hanover, A. Ch.\r\nPrell formed a distinguished Cellist. He received the last touch from\r\nJoseph Menter during his two years’ residence in Munich (1847-1849).\r\nHe there also had instruction in composition from Lachner. After he\r\nhad made some journeys from 1850-1852, he became music director in\r\nWürzburg, but remained there only a year, for he was summoned, in 1853,\r\nto be second Kapellmeister at the Frankfort Theatre, and became in 1854\r\nfirst Director. Goltermann has also made himself eminent as a composer\r\nfor his instrument. For the Violoncello, besides seven Concertos, he\r\nwrote a tolerable list of Drawing-room Pieces, which have received a\r\nconsiderable degree of favour.\r\n\r\nTwo other famous Hamburg Cellists are the BROTHERS LEE. The elder,\r\nwhose Christian name was Sebastian, was born on December 24, 1805, in\r\nHamburg, and was educated by Prell, the father. At twenty-five years\r\nof age he made his first _début_ as solo player in his native town,\r\nas well as in Leipsic, and then undertook a journey, by Cassel and\r\nFrankfort, to Paris, where he arrived in April, 1832. He was heard then\r\nwith approbation in the Théâtre Italien. In 1836 he went to London, and\r\nagain returned to Paris, in order to join, as solo cellist, in the\r\norchestra of the “Grand Opéra.” He devoted himself to this work from\r\n1837-1868, when he returned to Hamburg, and died there on January 4,\r\n1887. Seb. Lee published a considerable number of compositions for his\r\ninstrument. Amongst them are Divertissements, Fantasias, Variations,\r\nEtudes, as well as a great number of easy and more difficult Duets, of\r\nwhich three books, under the title of “Ecole du Violoncelliste à l’usage\r\ndu Conservatoire de Paris,” have been published.\r\n\r\nTwo scholars of Seb. Lee worthy of mention are BÖCKMANN and BIELER.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND BÖCKMANN, born January 28, 1843, at Hamburg, enjoyed Lee’s\r\ninstruction; and then Magnus Klitz,[122] who was at the time first\r\nCellist at the Hamburg Stadt-Theatre, was his master. In the autumn of\r\n1861 he found an appointment in the Dresden Court band, and was then,\r\nfor a time, Kummer’s pupil. Böckmann is a clever Violoncellist, who made\r\nhimself known extensively by the editing of old Violoncello music.\r\n\r\nAUGUST BIELER, born on May 9, 1863, at Hamburg, began his Cello studies\r\nunder Lee, in his fourteenth year, and continued them in Leipsic, where\r\nhe went in January, 1879, to be under Karl Schröder[123]; at Easter, in\r\n1881, he was received into the Sondershausen band, of which he has been\r\nfirst Cellist since 1885. He is at the same time giving instruction on\r\nhis instrument at the Conservatoire of Sondershausen. Bieler, who is\r\npossessed of a remarkable technique, has distinguished himself both as a\r\nsolo and quartet player. His tone is powerful and full of energy, but,\r\nat the same time, flexible and melodious, his manner of rendering full\r\nof expression and extremely musical.\r\n\r\nLee’s younger brother, LOUIS, who is reputed to have had great skill in\r\nbowing, was born in Hamburg in 1819. He also undertook several journeys,\r\nduring which he appeared at Leipsic, Cassel, Frankfort, Paris, and\r\nCopenhagen. He published and wrote but very few cello compositions;\r\namongst them, “Trois Pièces gracieuses,” with piano accompaniment, must\r\nhave a prominent place.\r\n\r\nFinally, another much valued Violoncellist of Hamburg, ALBERT GOWA,\r\nmust be mentioned, who obtained his education in the Leipsic Music\r\nSchool, but on the Violoncello especially shared the instruction of F.\r\nGrützmacher and Davidoff. He made himself advantageously known by his\r\npublic appearances, not only in German towns, but also in Copenhagen\r\nand London; accepted an engagement from 1867-1868 at the Philharmonic\r\nSociety in his native town, and at the expiration of this he was\r\nappointed solo cellist at the Bückeburg Court; he then returned to\r\nHamburg, where he is still living and working. He was born on April 14,\r\n1843.\r\n\r\nSome other German distinguished Violoncellists of modern times are\r\nRipfel, Gross, Bockmühl, Néruda, and Alwin Schröder.\r\n\r\nKARL RIPFEL was a character, and moreover in his youth was a so-called\r\npiano phenomenon, until the Minister of Baden, de Touche, persuaded him\r\nto devote himself to Cello playing, and himself gave him instruction.\r\nIn regard to the technical branch of his art he made great progress,\r\nbut he was so nervous that he could never make up his mind, except\r\nduring his youth, to appear in public. His manner of rendering must\r\nhave been _bizarre_. Nevertheless he was a distinguished orchestra\r\nplayer; assisted by an extraordinary memory he was able to play the\r\ncello part in the opera without music on an occasion when his colleague\r\nwould not turn over the page at the right moment. He belonged to the\r\nFrankfort Theatre orchestra for forty-five years. His grave has the\r\ninscription: “Carl Ripfel, of Mannheim, died March 8, 1876, at the age\r\nof seventy-seven years.” He must accordingly have been born in the year\r\n1799. In the “Signalen für die Musikalische Welt,” of March 19, 1876,\r\nthe following is asserted of him: “Although not known in an extensive\r\ncircle, he was esteemed by Bernhard Romberg to be the greatest master\r\nof technique on his instrument, which he was at last able to manipulate\r\nalmost as well as Paganini.”\r\n\r\nRipfel was also a composer, but never published any of his compositions.\r\nWhen the Violin virtuoso, Jean Becker, asked him to let him have one of\r\nhis string trios, he was roughly refused.\r\n\r\nJOHANN BENJAMIN GROSS, born at Elbing, on September 12, 1809, went in\r\nhis youth to Berlin in order to devote himself there to the study of\r\nthe Cello. It was not long before he found a position in the orchestra\r\nof the Königstadt Theatre, which he gave up in 1831. He now turned to\r\nLeipsic, was often heard there, even in the Gewandhaus, and in 1833\r\njoined the Liphart String Quartet, at Dorpat, at the head of which was\r\nFerdinand David. In 1835 he was engaged for the Imperial Theatre in St.\r\nPetersburg as first Cellist, where he continued until 1847. He then\r\nreturned with a pension to Germany, but soon appeared in St. Petersburg\r\nagain, the Grand Duke Michael having summoned him to his neighbourhood.\r\nHe did not long enjoy the pleasures of this intercourse, for on\r\nSeptember 1, 1848, he died of cholera. Of his compositions, the number\r\nof which extend to about forty, there appeared for the Violoncello a\r\nConcerto, Etudes, Duets, Variations, and a variety of Drawing-room\r\nPieces. He wrote also a Concerto for Piano and Violoncello, as well as a\r\nSonata for these two instruments.\r\n\r\nROBERT EMIL BOCKMÜHL, born 1820, in Frankfort-on-the-Maine, died on\r\nNovember 3, 1881, was a clever Violoncellist, and an industrious\r\ncomposer for his instrument. He published about seventy works,\r\nconsisting of “Fantasias,” Variations, Divertissements, and Rondos on\r\nopera themes or national songs. Also an extensive book of studies under\r\nthe title: “Études pour le développement du mécanisme du violoncelle;\r\nadoptées pour l’étude élémentaire de cet instrument au Conservatoire\r\nroyal de musique de Bruxelles, et au Conservatoire de musique de Bavière\r\nà Munich” (Op. 17), in five parts. At the beginning of his fiftieth\r\nyear, Bockmühl settled in Düsseldorf. At that time Robert Schumann was\r\ncomposing his Violoncello Concerto, for which he solicited Bockmühl’s\r\nadvice in regard to the technical questions.\r\n\r\nFRANZ NÉRUDA, born on December 3, 1843, at Brünn, occupied himself from\r\nhis fifth year with Violin, and from his twelfth year with Violoncello\r\nplaying, to which latter he eventually devoted himself exclusively. In\r\nthe year 1855 he appeared publicly for the first time at Ischl. He then\r\nmade concert journeys in Germany and Russia, during which he attained\r\nhis twentieth year. In 1864 he was appointed to the Copenhagen Court\r\nKapelle, to which he belonged for twelve years. During this time he was\r\nfrequently heard as soloist in Copenhagen, as well as in London, where\r\nhe often took Piatti’s place at the Popular Concerts. He also performed\r\nat Concerts in Manchester and Liverpool. Latterly he appeared at Vienna.\r\nNéruda studied under his father, although he was indebted to Servais\r\nfor many good hints. He published about thirty of his Violoncello\r\ncompositions, amongst them a Violoncello Concerto, and some little\r\npieces for Cello with Piano accompaniment. It may be further remarked\r\nthat he is brother to the famous Violinist, Wilma Néruda.\r\n\r\nALWIN SCHRÖDER, brother to Karl Schröder,[124] was born at\r\nNeuhaldensleben in 1855, where his father was music director. He\r\ndevoted himself to Violoncello playing only, after he had pursued from\r\nthe seventh year of his age piano, violin, and tenor playing, and\r\nhad attained to remarkable proficiency in them. In his youth he was\r\nengaged in several orchestras in Berlin as tenor performer. During a\r\nvisit to his father’s house he conceived a great desire to take up the\r\nVioloncello, and practised on his own account the Cello solo in the\r\nIntroduction to Rossini’s “Tell” Overture. He succeeded so well that\r\nhis brother Karl, to whom he played it, urged him to occupy himself\r\nfurther with the Violoncello, which he did. In 1875 he had reached\r\nsuch a degree of proficiency that he was engaged in the autumn of the\r\nsame year as first Cellist for the Liebig Orchestra. This position he\r\nexchanged for one in the Fliegen Band. After he had been a member of the\r\nLaube Kapelle, he chose Leipsic as his place of residence in 1880, and\r\noccasionally took his brother Karl’s work in the orchestra. When the\r\nlatter accepted the post of Royal Kapellmeister in Sondershausen, he was\r\nappointed in his brother’s stead, together with Klengel,[125] as first\r\nCellist of the Gewandhaus and Theatre Orchestra, as well as teacher in\r\nthe Conservatoire. Besides this, he is permanent member of the Peter\r\nString Quartet. He received the title of Chamber Virtuoso from the\r\nreigning Prince of Sondershausen. His playing is famous for its clever\r\ntechnique, fine tone, perfect accuracy, and most expressive rendering.\r\nHe has been heard in the capitals of Germany, Belgium, and Russia with\r\nremarkable success.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] This artist was a violinist, and was born on April 27,\r\n1767, at Vechta, in Oldenburg, and died on November 21, 1821, as\r\nHofkapellmeister, in Gotha.\r\n\r\n[102] Bagge was a Prussian Chamberlain, who then lived in Paris, built a\r\nhouse there, and acted the part of an art patron.

They exercised, however, with few\r\nexceptions, no real influence in Germany after the period signalised\r\nby Romberg’s appearance. On the contrary, this master influenced\r\nin a certain way French Cello playing, as appears from a remark in\r\nBaudiot’s school, mentioned on page 104, that Romberg had introduced\r\nthe use of the fourth finger in the thumb position. The sign Ϙ, by\r\nwhich Romberg denoted the thumb position, also was adopted in France,\r\nwhere, as in other places, it had been necessary until then to use a\r\nvariety of indications for it. In other respects the aim of the French\r\nVioloncellists greatly inclined in the virtuoso direction, as was the\r\ncase with regard to violin playing, whereas in Germany greater stress\r\nwas laid on the more solidly musical aspect, without neglecting the\r\nvirtuoso side.\r\n\r\nTaking up the thread again from the preceding section with France, the\r\nfirst to be mentioned is\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE FRANCHOMME. This artist, who belongs to the most important\r\nmasters of his department, was born at Lille on April 10, 1808, and\r\nlearnt the first elements of his instrument from a mediocre teacher\r\nof his native town, whose name was Mas. In 1825 he went to the Paris\r\nConservatoire as pupil of Levasseur, and, after the latter retired\r\nfrom his professorship, Norblin undertook his further instruction.\r\nFranchomme’s great talent developed so rapidly, under the guidance\r\nof these two masters, that immediately, during the first year of his\r\nattendance at the Conservatoire, he gained the first prize at the\r\nmusical competition of the pupils of the establishment. He understood\r\nhow to extract from the instrument a full, sympathetic tone, and\r\npossessed with an extraordinary intonation the rare gift of an\r\nexpressive and tasteful reading. He specially distinguished himself\r\nby a charming _Cantilena_. It is easily understood that on his public\r\nappearances he always aroused the greatest enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFranchomme filled various places successively in Paris. He at first\r\nbelonged, during the years 1825 and 1826, to the orchestra of the\r\nTheatre “Ambigüe-Comique.” He then went over, in 1827, to the “Grand\r\nOpéra,” but remained there only one year. He belonged for a longer\r\nperiod to the Italian Opera, but he relinquished this position after a\r\nfew years. Instead, he established regular quartet evenings with the\r\nfamous violinist, Delphin Alard; and in 1846 he undertook the Cello\r\ninstruction at the Paris Conservatoire. He died on January 21 or 22,\r\n1884. His compositions, consisting of a Concerto, Nocturnes, Etudes,\r\nVariations, and a variety of smaller Drawing-room pieces, have still\r\nsome value for cello players. His best productions are the Twelve\r\nCaprices (Op. 7), which for pieces of that kind have every claim to\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe best known pupils of Franchomme are VIDAL (the younger), JACQUARD,\r\nand BARBOT.\r\n\r\nLOUIS ANTOINE VIDAL, born at Rouen on July 10, 1820, devoted himself by\r\npreference to the literary branch of music after he had finished his\r\nCello studies. By his valuable work, “Les instruments à archet,” he\r\nattained to a prominent position among the French writers on music of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nThe younger JACQUARD, whose Christian name was Louis Auguste, born on\r\nDecember 26, 1832, at Pont-le-Roy, so distinguished himself as a scholar\r\nof the Paris Conservatoire, that he gained in 1850 the second, and in\r\n1852 the first prize. He is a permanent member of the Orchestra of the\r\nConservatoire Concerts.\r\n\r\nJEAN FRANÇOIS BARBOT, born in 1847 at Toulouse, settled down in\r\nhis native town after he had completed his studies at the Paris\r\nConservatoire, and is still at the present time working there at his\r\nprofession as an artist. Other modern French cellists are--BATTANCHON,\r\nSELIGMANN, DANCLA, LEBOUC, and JACQUARD THE ELDER. They were all\r\nNorblin’s pupils.[126]\r\n\r\nFELIX BATTANCHON, born on April 9, 1814, in Paris, frequented the\r\nConservatoire of his native town, and studied there under Vaslin and\r\nNorblin, who turned him out as a clever Cellist. After he had worked in\r\nvarious ways as a solo player, he was appointed in 1840 to the orchestra\r\nat the Grand Opéra. His compositions consist of Etudes, which are fully\r\nadapted to the object in view and of which several books have been\r\npublished; Caprices, Duets, Trios (for three Violoncellos), and light\r\npieces of various kinds. His Op. 4, which contains twenty-four Studies,\r\nhas been introduced into the Paris Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTE PROSPER SELIGMANN, whose name suggests a German origin, was\r\nborn on July 28, 1817, in Paris, entered the Conservatoire there on\r\nDecember 2, 1829, and had Norblin as his master for the Violoncello,\r\nand Halévy for Composition. In 1834 he received the second prize and,\r\ntwo years later, the first prize. After he left the Conservatoire, in\r\nthe middle of 1838, he played a great deal in public, and in course of\r\ntime made concert tours through Southern France, Italy, Spain, Belgium,\r\nand Germany. For the beauty of his tone he is indebted to a valuable\r\nAmati Cello of large size. As a composer, Seligmann only cultivated the\r\nlighter kind of music. His Violoncello pieces are no longer used in solo\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nARNAUD DANCLA, born January 1, 1820, at Bagnères-de-Bigorre, was\r\nlikewise Norblin’s pupil at the Paris Conservatoire. He was dismissed,\r\nin 1840, with the first prize. Dancla distinguished himself especially\r\nas a quartet player. In Cello compositions, he published Etudes (Op.\r\n2), two books of Duets, a “Fantasia” on Themes from Auber’s “Sirène,”\r\n“Melodies,” and a Cello School, “Le Violoncelliste moderne.”\r\n\r\nCHARLES JOSEPH LEBOUC, born on December 22, 1822, at Besançon, attended\r\nthe Conservatoire in Paris, and at first had Vaslin as his teacher for\r\na short time, but subsequently Norblin. He also distinguished himself\r\nin playing chamber music. Besides some pieces for Violoncello, with\r\npiano accompaniment, he composed a “Methode complète et pratique de\r\nVioloncelle.”\r\n\r\nLEON JEAN JACQUARD, the elder, born on November 3, 1826, in Paris,\r\npassed his youth at Pont-le-Roy, near Blois. Hus-Desforges had retired\r\nthither, and from him Jacquard received his first cello instruction.\r\nWhen Hus-Desforges died, at the beginning of 1838, a certain Levacq\r\nundertook the further direction of Jacquard, until he went to Paris\r\nto attend the Conservatoire. Here he was in Norblin’s classes. He so\r\ndistinguished himself amongst his fellow scholars that he received, in\r\n1842, the second prize, and, in 1844, the first.\r\n\r\nJacquard enjoyed the reputation of a virtuoso-trained player. He\r\nwas, however, much appreciated as a member of the orchestra of the\r\nConservatoire Concerts, as well as of the chamber music concerts\r\ninstituted by the violinist, Armingaud, in which also the violinist,\r\nMas, and the tenor, Sabatier, took part. It is a proof of his\r\nextraordinary ability, that in 1877 he was appointed teacher in that\r\ninstitution as Chevillard’s successor, whose pupil he had been. Nine\r\nyears later (March 27, 1886) death summoned him away.\r\n\r\nJACQUES OFFENBACH, the creator of the Stage productions which are known\r\nby the name of “Bouffes Parisiens,” was born on June 21, 1819, at\r\nCologne, and occupied himself zealously with Violoncello playing in his\r\nyounger years. Partly to make himself more widely known, and partly to\r\nperfect himself on his instrument, he went to Paris in 1842, and shared\r\nfor a time the instruction of the Vaslin Classes in the Conservatoire.\r\nHis efforts, however, to succeed as a Cellist were in vain; according\r\nto the opinion of Fétis, because his bowing was inefficient. In\r\nfact, he only succeeded in assisting in the orchestra of the Comic\r\nOpera. This occupation did not please him for any length of time; he\r\nwithdrew and undertook the office, in 1847, of _Chef d’Orchestre_ at\r\nthe Théâtre Français. But Offenbach cherished more extensive plans,\r\nwhich aimed at becoming a composer for the theatre. It is known that he\r\nsuccessfully attained to this, though not in the way of gaining a very\r\nhigh reputation. Here, however, we are considering Offenbach solely\r\nas a Violoncellist. Although he did not perform as such in any very\r\nextraordinary manner, yet he possesses claims to be noticed in this\r\nplace, because he wrote a number of Cello compositions which gained\r\na certain amount of favour. Besides some light pieces he composed a\r\nconsiderable list of Duets.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE TOLBECQUE, whose father was a distinguished pupil of Rudolphe\r\nKreutzer in violin playing, was born on March 30, 1830, in Paris, and\r\nwent in his eleventh year to the Conservatoire as a pupil of Vaslin.\r\nIn 1849 he obtained the first prize. Since 1858 he has been living and\r\nworking at Niort, the chief town of the Department Deux-Sèvres.\r\n\r\nTwo other French cellists are Lasserre and Boubée.\r\n\r\nJULES LASSERRE, born on July 29, 1838, at Tarbes, went from 1852-1855\r\nto the Paris Conservatoire, and was dismissed from there with the first\r\nprize. He then successfully undertook journeys in France and Spain. In\r\n1869 he settled down in London as his permanent residence, and became\r\nfirst Cellist in the “Musical Union” as well as in Costa’s Orchestra. He\r\nwrote several things for his instrument.\r\n\r\nALBERT BOUBÉE, born in 1850, at Naples, was originally destined for\r\ncommerce, and failing to persevere in this, it was intended he should\r\ndevote himself to teaching. But neither in this could he succeed, and\r\nBoubée finally decided for the musical profession. The enthusiasm\r\nexcited in him by his cello teacher, Gaetano Ciandelli, and later on by\r\nServais and Piatti’s playing, really induced him to pursue the study of\r\nmusic. In 1867 Boubée chose London as his residence, where since then\r\nhe has become completely naturalised, though from time to time he has\r\naccepted engagements abroad. He worked on several occasions with the\r\norchestras at Spa and Scarborough, and travelled in Sweden, Norway,\r\nand Denmark as a concert player, but he devotes himself chiefly to the\r\nsphere of work which he has made for himself in the English capital. Of\r\nhis Cello compositions, which consist of several solo pieces, the best\r\nknown in England is “La Gymnastique du Violoncelliste.”\r\n\r\nFrance possessed also a Violoncello virtuosa of reputation about the\r\nmiddle of the century in LISA B. CRISTIANI, whose name really points\r\nto an Italian descent. She played with delicate intonation charming\r\nlittle pieces, pleasantly and gracefully, and performed them on her\r\njourneys through Germany and Denmark to Russia, and also on October 18,\r\n1845, at Leipsic. The general approbation which was everywhere lavished\r\nupon her was substantially increased by her beautiful and imposing\r\nappearance. Felix Mendelssohn considered it worth while to accompany her\r\nperformances on the piano at her Leipsic Concert, and to compose a “Song\r\nwithout Words” for her. She was appointed Chamber Virtuosa by the King\r\nof Denmark. In 1853 she died at Tobolsk, of cholera. She was born at\r\nParis, on December 24, 1827.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the best French cellists are: JULES DELSART, RABAUD\r\n(both teachers at the Paris Conservatoire), LIÈGEOIS, LOEB, and BECKER.\r\nInformation regarding them is lacking up to the present time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Belgium and Holland the Violoncello was introduced about the same\r\ntime as in France, though it made, indeed, but slow progress in both\r\nthese countries. This may be concluded by the very modest number of\r\nBelgian and Dutch Cellists worthy of mention in the last century, of\r\nwhich there are only four to notice. The oldest of these,\r\n\r\nWILHELM DE FESCH, born in the Netherlands towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, was not only cellist, but organist. In the latter\r\ncapacity he worked at the Antwerp Cathedral until 1725, when he\r\nundertook, as d’Eve’s[127] successor, the office of Choirmaster. But\r\nas he treated somewhat roughly the boys of the church choir entrusted\r\nto his direction, he was dismissed in 1731, when he betook himself to\r\nLondon. He was still living there in 1757, as appears from the portrait\r\nof him in that year by Lacave. Amongst his published compositions\r\nmentioned by Burney as dry and uninteresting, there are also six\r\nVioloncello solos printed at Amsterdam (Op. 8). After Fesch,\r\n\r\nPETER WILHELM WINKIS must be mentioned. Born in 1735 at Liège, he did\r\nnot remain at home, but travelled to Germany, where for a few years he\r\nwas in the service of the Cassel Court, and then (at the beginning of\r\n1788), as Gerber notices, became Chamber Musician and Violoncellist to\r\nthe “Kapellinstitut” of the Queen of Prussia. He well understood how to\r\naccompany with “much taste and observation.”\r\n\r\nThe third Violoncellist of consideration is\r\n\r\nJEAN ARNOLD DAMMEN (Fétis calls him Jean André Dahmen), who belonged\r\nto a large Dutch musical family, was born in 1760, at the Hague, and\r\nhad the reputation of being a clever player. About 1769 he was living\r\nin London. Of his compositions, several books of Duets and Sonatas\r\nappeared. In 1794 he was appointed to Drury Lane, and in the years 1796\r\nand 1797 he travelled in South Germany.\r\n\r\nFinally we must here mention JOSEPH MÜNTZBERGER. He was of German\r\nextraction, and was born in Brussels in 1769, where his father,\r\nWenzeslaus Müntzberger, was chamber musician in the service of Prince\r\nCharles of Lorraine, Governor of the Netherlands. Fétis informs us that\r\nthe young Müntzberger at six years of age played a Concerto before the\r\nPrince, on a tenor viol, handled somewhat like the Violoncello. On\r\naccount of this performance he was induced to have the boy instructed\r\nby the violinist, Van Maldere. This account must be erroneous, for Van\r\nMaldere died on November 3, 1768, a year before Müntzberger’s birth. In\r\nhis fourteenth year he went to Paris. He there advanced himself--with\r\nthe sole assistance of Tillière’s Violoncello School--so far that he\r\nwas able to play the most difficult pieces of the Cello literature\r\nof that period. In 1790 he accepted a place in the orchestra of the\r\n“Théâtre Lyrique et Comique,” but after a time gave it up and entered\r\nthe orchestra of the “Théâtre Feydeau,”[128] of which he became first\r\ncellist after Cardon’s resignation. Besides this, he was a member of\r\nNapoleon the First’s band, as well as, later, of the King’s. During his\r\nofficial occupation he often assisted at concerts, and specially at\r\nthose of the “Rue de Cléry,” which at the beginning of this century were\r\nin great favour with the Parisians. In 1830 he retired on a pension, and\r\ndied in January, 1844.\r\n\r\nMüntzberger, who, during his long residence in Paris, had not only\r\nGallicised himself as an artist, but also in regard to the pronunciation\r\nof his name, composed a good deal for the Violoncello--namely, five\r\nConcertos, a “Symphonie Concertante,” Trios, in which, besides the\r\nCello obbligato, the violin and bass take part; a great number of\r\nDuets, Fantasias, and Variations; two books of Sonatas, with bass;\r\nthree of Etudes and Caprices, as well as a “Nouvelle Méthode pour le\r\nVioloncelle.” The latter work in all probability appeared before 1800,\r\nas in it, as in Boccherini’s compositions, besides the bass and tenor\r\nand violin clefs, the alto and soprano clefs are used, which do not\r\noccur in French books of instruction after this date.\r\n\r\nVioloncello playing received a remarkable impulse in Belgium towards\r\nthe middle of our century. Platel (mentioned already on p. 101) greatly\r\ncontributed to this by founding the school of Violoncello playing which\r\nsubsequently gained such reputation. From it came out prominently,\r\n\r\nADRIEN FRANÇOIS SERVAIS, born on June 6, 1807, at Hal, near Brussels. He\r\nbegan his career, like so many of his colleagues, with violin playing,\r\nin which his father, who was a musician in the church at Hal, first gave\r\nhim instruction, and under whom he became acquainted with the elements\r\nof theory. The child’s rare talent inspired the art-loving Marquis de\r\nSayve, who possessed an estate in the neighbourhood of Hal, with so\r\ngreat an interest that he granted him the means of beginning to study in\r\nearnest under the direction of the first violinist of that time in the\r\nBrussels Theatre, of the name of Van der Planken. In Brussels, Servais\r\nsoon found an opportunity of hearing Platel, whose playing made a deep\r\nimpression on him, and excited in him the desire of devoting himself\r\nto Violoncello playing. In order to become Platel’s pupil, he applied\r\nfor admission to the Brussels Conservatoire. His development was so\r\nrapid that he surpassed all his fellow-students, and gained, before\r\nthe year was over, the first prize in the competition. Platel made him\r\nhis assistant in the Conservatoire, and at the same time he was placed\r\nin the opera orchestra, to which he belonged for three years. During\r\nthis period, however, he did not succeed in gaining from his fellow\r\ncountrymen the appreciation which he soon after gained in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834 Servais went to London. He acquired there also\r\nremarkable success; but the applause of the public did not excite in\r\nhim self-satisfied content, for when he returned home he gave himself\r\nup to renewed study, by means of which he attained to the highest\r\ndegree of masterly performance. In the beginning of 1836 he went to\r\nParis--the following year he travelled in Holland, and in 1839 visited\r\nSt. Petersburg, where he met with a brilliant reception. Such was the\r\ncase also when he re-appeared in his native land, and performed at\r\nBrussels and Antwerp, after his return from Russia. In the beginning\r\nof 1841 he undertook a second journey to the East, in which he aroused\r\ngreat applause at St. Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, and Vienna\r\nby his performances. In 1843 he gave concerts again in Holland, and\r\nthe following year in Germany, after which he again went to Russia.\r\nIn the winter of 1847 he was in Paris and later on he travelled into\r\nScandinavia. Now a quieter time was in store for him, for in 1848, after\r\nhe had been nominated solo violinist to the King of the Belgians, he\r\nundertook the Professorship at the Brussels Conservatoire, which for a\r\ntime attached him to the place. At the beginning of 1866 he made another\r\njourney to Russia, which he extended to Siberia. It is supposed that by\r\nthese unceasing efforts Servais laid the seeds of his death, which took\r\nplace on November 26 of the same year, at his birthplace, whither he had\r\nresorted to recruit his health.\r\n\r\nServais was not only a virtuoso of the first rank, but also a thoroughly\r\noriginal artist who was the means of effecting an important advance in\r\nCello playing, by opening out for it new lines. His performance was\r\ndistinguished by broad, energetic, and rich intonation, as well as by\r\nthe most careful finish and effective manipulation, for he understood\r\nhow to bring out into the clearest light all the advantages of his\r\ninstrument. Many connoisseurs consider him the first cellist of his\r\ntime; in any case, he competed successfully with his French colleagues,\r\nand raised the Belgian school of Violoncello playing to extraordinary\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nServais as a composer for his instrument is well-deserving of notice.\r\nBesides three Concertos, he wrote ten Fantasias, with orchestral\r\naccompaniment. He united with J. Grégoire in composing fourteen Duets\r\nfor Piano and Violoncello, and with the violinist Léonard three Duets\r\nfor Violin and Violoncello, upon opera themes. In conjunction also\r\nwith Henri Vieuxtemps, a Duet of the same kind was produced. Finally,\r\nhe composed six Caprices in the Etude form, which, however, are not\r\nso attractive as many of his other Cello pieces. Amongst these the\r\n“Souvenir de Spa” and Variations on Schubert’s Sehnsucht Valses have had\r\nthe widest circulation.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous pupils whom Servais formed, the best known are--Meerens,\r\nDeswert, Fischer, and Bekker.\r\n\r\nCHARLES MEERENS, born at Bruges on December 26, 1831, is the son\r\nof a clever flutist, who in 1845 settled in Antwerp, where young\r\nMeerens received his first Cello instruction from Joseph Bessems.\r\nLater, a certain Dumon, in Ghent, was his teacher. Having returned to\r\nhis birthplace, Bruges, he founded an amateur musical society, “Les\r\nFrancs-Amis,” and superintended a music warehouse established by his\r\nfather. In 1855 he went to Brussels in order to study music under\r\nServais’s direction, but subsequently devoted his chief attention to\r\nwriting on music, especially in relation to acoustics.\r\n\r\nJULES DESWERT, the most prominent pupil of Servais, and altogether one\r\nof the best of Belgian cellists, was born on August 1, 1843, at Louvain,\r\nand made himself a name, after having completed his studies under\r\nServais, by several concert journeys. In 1865 he stopped at Düsseldorf,\r\nand was for a time engaged there. Three years later he entered the\r\nWeimar Hofkapelle as first Cellist, whence he was summoned to Berlin,\r\nin 1869, with the title of Concertmaster, as solo cellist of the Royal\r\nband and teacher in the High School of Music. He gave up this in 1873\r\nin order to devote himself to composition. After he had remained a few\r\nyears in Wiesbaden, he chose Leipsic as his residence in 1881. Besides\r\ntwo operas, of which the one called “The Albigenses” was brought out\r\nin 1878 at Wiesbaden, and the other, “Graf Hammerstein,” in 1884 in\r\nMayence, he wrote three Cello Concertos, as well as an important number\r\nof Drawing-room Pieces, re-edited a collection of old Violoncello music\r\nand arrangements of classical compositions, and published three books\r\nof Etudes under the title of “Le Mecanisme du Violoncelle.” He also\r\nproduced a Cello school, which was brought out by Novello, in London.\r\nServais also formed a very distinguished artist in the Cellist,\r\n\r\nADOLPHE FISCHER, born November 22, 1850, in Brussels, whose name\r\nimplies a German origin. His father, who worked in the Belgian capital\r\nas conductor, and founded the first Society for men-singers, prepared\r\nhim for attending the Brussels Conservatoire. His education, under the\r\nguidance of Servais, went rapidly forward. At sixteen years of age the\r\nfirst prize was conferred on him. After his studies were completed,\r\nFischer chose Paris as his residence, and soon met with general\r\nappreciation. Since then he has undertaken several concert tours in the\r\nlarger towns of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe violoncellist, P. R. BEKKER, born on May 23, 1839, in the Dutch town\r\nof Winschoten, was pupil of the Brussels School of Music from 1852-1855.\r\nHe progressed so far under Servais that he soon received the first\r\nprize at the playing competition. Bekker sought and found a sphere of\r\nwork as music teacher at Utrecht. A testimony to the excellence of his\r\nperformances is the circumstance that, in 1861, he was granted the title\r\nof solo Violoncellist by the King of Holland. He did not, however, long\r\nenjoy the fruits of his industry, for he died in 1875.\r\n\r\nServais educated also the elder of his two sons, whose Christian name\r\nwas JOSEPH, as a very good cellist. From 1869-1870 he belonged to the\r\nWeimar orchestra. In the year 1872 he was nominated professor of his\r\ninstrument at the Brussels Conservatoire. He was born November 23, 1850,\r\nat Hal, the home of his father, where he died August 28 or 29, of the\r\nyear 1885.\r\n\r\nReturning to Platel’s pupils, we have, after the elder Servais,\r\nFRANÇOIS DEMUNCK (De Munck) to mention, who was born on October 6,\r\n1815, in Brussels, where his father was teacher of music. Instructed\r\nby him in the first elements of the art, he entered the Conservatoire\r\nof his birthplace as a boy of ten years of age, and soon had Platel\r\nas his master. In 1834 he left the Institution with the first prize,\r\nand in the following year he was nominated as his master’s assistant.\r\nWhen the latter died a few months after, Demunck was appointed his\r\nsuccessor. His star was gradually in the ascendant. Fétis says of him\r\nthat, about 1840, the hope was cherished that he was destined to be\r\nat the head of the Violoncellists of his time, for his playing was\r\ndistinguished not only by the opposite fine qualities of energetic and\r\ndelicate intonation, but also by an expression full of feeling, and ease\r\nin surmounting all difficulties. This hope was not, however, to be\r\nfulfilled. Demunck fell into relations which had a paralysing effect on\r\nthe work of his profession. He neglected more and more the study of the\r\nCello; consequently his performances were deprived of their precision\r\nand brilliancy; and, further, he ruined his health. Notwithstanding this\r\nhe still excited some consideration in London. Soon after, in the year\r\n1845, he resigned his official work, in order to perform at concerts, in\r\ncompany with a singer, in Germany. His performances, however, no longer\r\ncame up to the cherished expectations. In the year 1848 Servais stepped\r\ninto Demunck’s place as teacher at the Brussels Conservatoire, which\r\ninduced him to go to London, and labour for a time in the orchestra of\r\n“Her Majesty’s” Theatre. But only too soon the results of his dissolute\r\nlife became apparent. He fell into doubtful circumstances, and, broken\r\nin body and mind, he returned, in the spring of 1853, to Brussels,\r\nwhere, on February 28 of the following year, he died.\r\n\r\nDemunck published only a “Fantasia” with variations on a Russian theme\r\n(Op. 1).\r\n\r\nOf his two sons he brought up the younger, by name ERNEST, as cellist,\r\nwho was born in Brussels on December 21, 1840. As early as eight years\r\nof age he was able to appear as a solo player in his native place, and\r\nat ten in London. He then became, for a time, Servais’s pupil in the\r\nBrussels Conservatoire. Later, in company with Julien, he travelled\r\nall over Great Britain, then settled in London, but in 1868 went to\r\nParis, was there for two years member of the Maurin String Quartet, and\r\naccepted, in 1871, the invitation made to him to be first Cellist of the\r\nWeimar orchestra. His work for many years suffered impediment from an\r\ninjury to his left hand. Since his marriage with Carlotta Patti he has\r\nresided in America.\r\n\r\nAs one of the elder Demunck’s pupils deserving notice,\r\n\r\nGUILLAUME PAQUE must be mentioned, born at Brussels on July 24, 1825. At\r\nten years of age he became a pupil of the Conservatoire, where, during a\r\ncourse of six years, he received his entire artistic training. Dismissed\r\nfrom the institution with the first prize, he entered the orchestra\r\nof the Royal Theatre in his native town. After he had belonged to it\r\nfor some years, he took up his abode in Paris, with the intention of\r\npermanently settling there. But an offer which he received in 1840, of\r\nentering, as solo cellist, the Italian Opera at Barcelona, induced him\r\nto leave the French capital. Scarcely had he arrived at Barcelona, when\r\nthe Professorship of the Musical School was committed to him. In 1849\r\nhe played before the Queen of Spain in Madrid, and in 1850 he travelled\r\nin the South of France giving concerts. In the same year he fixed his\r\nresidence in London, where he gained popularity as a chamber music\r\nplayer. He found his particular sphere of work as solo cellist at the\r\nRoyal Italian Opera, as well as teacher at the London Academy of Music,\r\nuntil his death on March 3, 1876. Amongst his compositions he published\r\nseveral “Fantasias,” Variations, and Drawing-room pieces.\r\n\r\nThe elder Demunck had a second famous pupil in\r\n\r\nISIDORE DESWERT, not to be confounded with the Violoncellist of the\r\nsame name already mentioned. Isidore Deswert, the son of a musician\r\nestablished at Louvain, was born there on January 6, 1830, and, after\r\nhe had completed his studies at the Brussels Conservatoire, he received\r\nthe first prize at the playing competition. In 1850 he found a position\r\nas teacher at the music school of his native town, and six years later\r\nhe was invested with the office of solo cellist at the “Théâtre de la\r\nMonnaie,” in Brussels. Since December 3, 1866, he has been occupied as\r\nDirector of the Violoncello Class at the Conservatoire there.\r\n\r\nOf Platel’s pupils we have still to mention Batta and Van Volxem.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER BATTA, born on July 9, 1816, at Maestricht, received from\r\nhis father, a singing master, his first instruction in music, and\r\nat first practised violin playing. After some time his father was\r\nappointed “professeur de solfège” at the Brussels Conservatoire, and\r\nin consequence the family Batta took up their abode in the Belgian\r\ncapital. There the talented boy heard the Cello master, Platel, play,\r\nand the desire of emulating him was awakened. He succeeded in inducing\r\nhis father to let him share Platel’s instruction at the Conservatoire.\r\nBy persevering industry he succeeded in gaining the first prize with\r\nDemunck at the competition of his class in 1834. In 1835 he went to\r\nParis, where he found a good reception. This decided him to make it his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAt this time the tenor, Rubini, was flourishing in Paris. All vied\r\nin doing him homage, and Batta became such an unbounded admirer\r\nof him, that he copied his manner of rendering. It is known that\r\ninstrumentalists can learn a great deal from good singers. Rubini,\r\nhowever, with all the advantages of his manner of singing, had the\r\nfailing of making excessive contrasts of _forte_ and _piano_ without\r\nthe use of intermediate gradations, in order to produce startling\r\neffects upon the public. Batta appropriated this merely for the sake of\r\nattaining an easy effect, and therefore became for a time the recognized\r\ndarling of the Parisian public, and especially of the ladies, whom he\r\nknew how to captivate by his sweetly coquettish style of playing. He\r\nnaturally possessed also valuable artistic qualities, but an apparently\r\nvirtuoso tendency ever after clung to him.\r\n\r\nBatta published a respectable list of Drawing-room pieces and\r\ntranscriptions, as well as a Concerto and a couple of Concert Etudes\r\nfor his instrument. These productions were for a time made use of by\r\nvioloncellists: now they have ceased to excite any interest.\r\n\r\nJ. B. VAN VOLXEM, born on November 30, 1817, at Ucclelès-Bruxelles,\r\nbecame, in 1833, a student of the Brussels Conservatoire as a pupil of\r\nPlatel. At the competition he gained the second prize for Cello playing\r\nand composition. Later on he was Chorus Director in the Brussels Royal\r\nTheatre. Since then he has by preference devoted himself to chorus\r\nsinging, and has deserved considerable merit for its diffusion in\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nThree other Belgian violoncellists must be added to those artists\r\nalready mentioned, namely: Chevillard, Warot, and Vieuxtemps, of whom\r\nthe first-named is distinguished as by far the most important and most\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nPIERRE ALEXANDRE FRANÇOIS CHEVILLARD, born on January 15, 1811, at\r\nAntwerp, received--after he had been prepared for the musical profession\r\nin the parental home--his higher education, as a pupil of Norblin, in\r\nthe Paris Conservatoire, to which he belonged from March 15, 1820, until\r\nthe year 1827. Dismissed from thence with the first prize, he undertook\r\nthe duties of solo cellist in the orchestra of the “Théâtre Gymnase.”\r\nIn this position, which afforded him abundant leisure for pursuing the\r\nstudy of composition under Fétis’s direction, he remained until 1831.\r\nHe then became member of the orchestra of the Italian Opera. In the\r\nyear 1859 he undertook the Professoriate at the Paris Conservatoire in\r\nVaslin’s place.\r\n\r\nChevillard distinguished himself not only as a trained virtuoso player,\r\nbut also as a musician animated by a high artistic aim, which he proved\r\nby his efforts to introduce the last String Quartets of Beethoven\r\ninto Parisian musical circles, for whom these magnificent “tone\r\npoems” had until then been an unknown world. After repeated fruitless\r\nattempts, which failed on account of the insufficient intelligence of\r\nhis associate players, he at length succeeded by means of the artists\r\nMaurin, Sabattier, and Mas, who had the same aim in view, in gaining\r\nthe requisite force by which he was able to carry out his ideas. At\r\nfirst the quartet confederates established private performances before a\r\nfew connoisseurs only. By degrees, however, the number of the audience\r\nincreased, so that they ventured on a public hearing, which took place\r\nin the Pleyel Saloon. During the years 1855 and 1856 the four players\r\nundertook tours in Germany in order to perform the last Beethoven\r\nQuartet at Cologne, Frankfort, Darmstadt, Leipsic, Berlin, and Hanover.\r\nEverywhere they found the appreciation which they deserved. In the year\r\n1868 Demunck the younger joined the Quartet in the place of Chevillard,\r\nwho died at the end of 1877.\r\n\r\nChevillard’s cello compositions were a “Concerto, Quinze Mélodies,\r\nMorceaux developpés pour Violoncelle et Orchestre ou Piano,” a\r\n“Fantasia” on Themes from Marino Falliero “Lamenti, Adagio and Finale,”\r\nand “Andante et Barcarolle.” Besides these he published a Cello school\r\nwhich bears the title: “Méthode complète de Violoncelle, contenant la\r\nthéorie de l’instrument, des gammes, leçons progressives, études, airs\r\nvariés et leçons pour chacune des positions.”\r\n\r\nCONSTANT NOËL ADOLPHE WAROT, born on November 28, 1812, at Antwerp,\r\nbegan early the practice of music on the violin, but gave up this\r\ninstrument in favour of the violoncello. In 1852 he was appointed\r\nteacher at the Brussels Conservatoire. Besides a Violoncello School,\r\nwhich was introduced as a work of instruction to the Art Institute\r\nmentioned, he wrote Duets for two Violoncellos, and an “Air Varié” with\r\npiano accompaniment. He died on April 10, 1875, at the place of his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nConcerning JULES JOSEPH ERNEST VIEUXTEMPS, the younger brother of the\r\ncelebrated Violin virtuoso of the same name, nothing more is known than\r\nthe fact that he was for a long time solo cellist at the Italian Opera\r\nin London, and that he is at present solo player in Hallé’s Orchestra at\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmongst the Dutch Violoncellists we have--\r\n\r\nANDREAS TEN CATE, born in 1796, at Amsterdam. He was originally destined\r\nfor a commercial calling, but at the age of fourteen he decided for the\r\nmusical career, and became Jan Georg. Bertelmann’s pupil. In his riper\r\nyears he devoted himself chiefly to composition for the stage. He wrote,\r\nhowever, some instrumental pieces; amongst them a couple of Violoncello\r\nConcertos. He died on July 27, 1858.\r\n\r\nJACQUES FRANCO-MENDÈS, who descends from a Portuguese family settled for\r\na long time in Amsterdam, has exercised a great, indeed the greatest\r\ninfluence on Dutch cello playing. He was born in 1816[129] in the said\r\ntown, and in his earliest years began the practice of music. He received\r\ninstruction from Präger on the Violoncello, from Bertelmann in theory,\r\nand, in order to educate himself still further in cello playing, he went\r\nto Merk, at Vienna, in 1829.\r\n\r\nUntil then Franco-Mendès was undecided as to whether he should pursue\r\nmusic for his pleasure or as his career. He soon decided for the latter,\r\nand undertook with his brother Joseph, who was a gifted violin player,\r\na journey to London and Paris in the year 1831. He made his _début_ in\r\nthe former city at a concert given by Nepomuk Hummel and on his return\r\nto Amsterdam he received from the King of Holland the title of Chamber\r\nVioloncellist. In 1833 the brothers Franco-Mendès undertook together\r\na concert tour in Germany, and were heard with success in Frankfort,\r\nLeipsic, and Dresden. In the following year Jacques was nominated\r\nfirst solo Cellist of the King of Holland. In 1836 he again went\r\nwith his brother to Paris. The latter died in 1841, and this loss so\r\nheavily affected Jacques that for a long time he could not resolve to\r\nundertake any more art journeys but played only at a few concerts in\r\nthe chief towns of Holland. In 1845 the desire was again aroused in him\r\nof making further efforts. He took part, in that year, in the musical\r\nfestival which was held at Bonn to celebrate the unveiling of the\r\nBeethoven memorial, but on account of the overwhelming number of musical\r\nproductions he gained no success. In 1860 he took up his permanent abode\r\nin Paris. As a composer, Franco-Mendès proved that to a certain extent\r\nhis aim was worthy of respect, for he occupied himself with chamber\r\nmusic in its more serious aspect. He wrote two Quintets and a String\r\nQuartet, one of which was distinguished by receiving a prize from the\r\nNetherlands “Society for the advancement of Music.” He has also composed\r\na long list of Drawing-room pieces for his instrument, amongst them a\r\ngrand Duo for two Violoncellos, an Elégie, “Fantasias,” “Caprices,” and\r\nmore pieces of the same kind; some of them are still performed, as, for\r\nexample, the Adagio (Op. 48).\r\n\r\nAmong Franco-Mendès’ pupils,\r\n\r\nCHARLES ERNEST APPY must be cited, who, springing from French parentage,\r\nwas born on October 25, 1834, at the Hague. His father was a tenor\r\nplayer in the Royal band, but went away with his family to Amsterdam,\r\nwhere his son at fourteen years of age began with piano playing under\r\nRichard Hol. A year after he gave it up for the Violoncello, on which\r\nthe Belgian, Charles Montigny, and later, Merlen, the first cellist\r\nat Amsterdam, gave him instruction. He received the final finish from\r\nFranco-Mendès, under whom he also studied composition.\r\n\r\nAppy began his work as a musician in 1851, as member of the Concert\r\norchestra at Zaandam. He soon received invitations to the provincial\r\ntowns of his Fatherland to assist as a solo player at concerts, and in\r\n1854 he was engaged for six months by Joseph Gungl, as solo cellist for\r\nScotland. Two years later he was member of the Amsterdam Park orchestra,\r\nas well as of the orchestra of the “Felix Meritis” Society. In 1857 he\r\nworked for six months at the concerts of the London Crystal Palace,\r\nand after his return he joined the orchestra of the “Cäcelia” Society\r\nin Amsterdam. From 1862 he has belonged to the String Quartet of the\r\nexcellent violinist, Franz Coenen, for nine years, by which means he has\r\nenjoyed the opportunity of playing with distinguished artists, such as\r\nErnst Lübeck, Alfred Jaël, and Madame Clara Schumann.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1864 Appy was appointed Cello teacher to the “Maatschappij\r\ntot Bevordering van Toonkunst,” in which office he remained till 1883.\r\nDuring this time, in 1871, he went for six months to New York, in order\r\nto join in the Thomas Concerts as soloist. His substitute as teacher at\r\nthe Amsterdam Maatschappij was, meantime, Daniel de Lange.\r\n\r\nReturned to Holland, Appy took up his residence in Haarlem, where he\r\ngave lessons on the Cello and Piano. Thence he again went to Amsterdam\r\nand opened there a prosperous music school, which he continues to\r\nsuperintend at the present time. His cello compositions consist of\r\n“Fantasias” on _Motifs_ from the “Freischütz” and “Robert le Diable,” as\r\nwell as some smaller light pieces.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned DANIEL DE LANGE, born about 1840, at Rotterdam, was\r\neducated as a cellist by Simon Ganz and Servais, while Verhulst was his\r\nmaster in theory. On the completion of his studies he travelled with\r\nhis brother, the pianist and organist, Samuel de Lange, through Austria\r\nand went to the music school at Lemberg, to which he belonged for three\r\nyears. In 1863 he returned home and undertook the Cello instruction at\r\nthe Rotterdam Music School, which his master Ganz had until then carried\r\non. There is no further information regarding him.\r\n\r\nJACQUES RENSBURG, born May 22, 1846, at Rotterdam, also began his\r\ncello studies under Ganz in his ninth year, and continued them under\r\nGiese, Daniel de Lange, and Emil Hegar.[130] Rensburg was destined\r\nfor a commercial and not an artistic career, but his inclination for\r\nmusic so increased with time, that in 1867 he received permission from\r\nhis father to devote himself to Art. He now went about the middle\r\nof the year named to Cologne, in order to pursue a course under the\r\ntalented Violoncellist, Schmitt. The latter, however, was already,\r\nin consequence of a chest malady which, later, carried him off, so\r\nsuffering that Rensburg’s wish was not fulfilled of learning from him.\r\nInstead of becoming Schmitt’s pupil he was his temporary assistant,\r\nas first Cellist in the orchestra of the Gürzenich Concerts, as well\r\nas teacher in the Rhenish School of Music at Cologne. Both offices\r\nwere given over to him definitely on April 1, 1868, on account of his\r\nvaluable services, for, in the meantime, Schmitt had died. Besides his\r\nofficial duty, Rensburg frequently performed with favourable success\r\nin the tours of the Rhenish Provinces, as well as in North Germany,\r\nand in 1872, also, in the Leipsic Gewandhaus as a soloist; but the\r\nceaseless application with which he practised his profession brought on\r\na nervous affection, which compelled him to retire into private life.\r\nIn the autumn of 1874 he went to his native town, and since the spring\r\nof 1880 he has been living at Bonn, where he is partner in a mercantile\r\nundertaking. Of his compositions have appeared: “Recitative, Adagio, and\r\nAllegro, in the form of a Concerto.”\r\n\r\nAn excellent Dutch Violoncellist is LOUIS LÜBECK, born on February\r\n14, 1838, at the Hague. His father, the “Hof-Kapellmeister,” Johann\r\nHeinr. Lübeck, so highly esteemed by the Dutch musical world (died on\r\nFebruary 7, 1865, at the Hague), gave him his first regular instruction,\r\nafter he had up to his seventeenth year occupied himself with music\r\nas a dilettante. In order still further to perfect himself he studied\r\nfrom 1857-1859 under Léon Jacquard’s direction in Paris. He then made\r\nsuccessful journeys through France and Holland, took up his residence\r\nin Colmar, where he often joined in concerts with Clara Schumann and\r\nJul. Stockhausen; in 1866 he was summoned to Leipsic as first cellist at\r\nthe Gewandhaus Concerts and teacher at the Conservatoire. He fulfilled\r\nthese duties until 1868, in which year he occupied a similar position\r\nin Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and he also undertook fresh concert journeys\r\nthrough Germany, Holland, and England. In the year 1871 Lübeck was a\r\nmember of the Carlsruhe “Capelle.” He did not, however, remain long in\r\nthis position, but he next went, in 1873, to Berlin and St. Petersburg.\r\nFrom the latter place he went to Sondershausen, where he belonged to\r\nthe Ducal Band as soloist, and afterwards to North America. In the\r\nyear 1881 he returned to Europe, and was engaged as successor to the\r\nConcertmaster, Jul. Stahlknecht, for the Berlin Royal Band, to which he\r\nstill belongs as solo cellist. Besides a collection of small pieces,\r\namongst which are some transcriptions, Lübeck has written two Concertos,\r\nof which, however, only one has until now been published.\r\n\r\nBouman and Maaré belong to the younger Dutch Violoncellists who have\r\nbecome prominent by their performances.\r\n\r\nANTOON BOUMAN, born in Amsterdam, in the year 1855, received his first\r\ninstruction from one of his brothers, with whom he later for some time\r\nestablished regular Quartet Conversaziones. As a boy of twelve years\r\nhe was able to appear before the King, William III., as well as at the\r\npublic Concerts of his native city. In order to make further progress\r\nhe attended the Rotterdam Conservatoire and enjoyed there the cello\r\ninstruction of O. Eberle.[131] Returning home he again played before the\r\nKing, who granted him the means of continuing his studies. He thus was\r\nable to work for some years in order to perfect himself, and had the\r\nadvantage of the advice of Aug. Lindner, in Hanover; Fr. Grützmacher, in\r\nDresden; Joseph Servais, in Brussels; and Léon Jacquard, in Paris. He\r\nthen travelled in Southern France and England, where, during a residence\r\nof four years, he gave concerts with success. Since then he has\r\nacquired for himself a lucrative sphere of work in Utrecht as Director\r\nof the municipal concerts, as solo player and cello teacher. Besides\r\nseveral smaller compositions, Bouman has written two Concertos for his\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nFrom Eberle, who, as we have just seen, was for a time Bouman’s\r\nmaster, TH. C. DE MAARÉ, born on January 14, 1863, also received his\r\neducation as a Violoncellist. In his twenty-second year he received the\r\nappointment at the “Amsterdamsche Orkestvereenigung” of solo cellist,\r\nwhen the place of first solo player at the Royal “Fransche Opera” was\r\nalso given to him, which position he still holds.\r\n\r\nThe two youngest cellists of Holland, of talent worth mentioning, are\r\nSnoer and Smith.\r\n\r\nJOHAN SNOER was born on June 28, 1868, in Amsterdam, and received his\r\nfirst instruction from Alexander Pohle, a pupil of Fr. Grützmacher.\r\nAfter Pohle’s death the younger Giese[132] was his master, and, when\r\nthe latter went out to America, Henry Bosman undertook his training.\r\nLater on he learned the harp from Edm. Schuëcker, now teacher at the\r\nLeipsic Conservatoire. Snoer began his active career as a volunteer in\r\nthe Amsterdam Park Orchestra. When he was dismissed from this he was\r\nappointed Violoncellist and Harpist at the newly-erected Park Theatre at\r\nAmsterdam. Since 1885 he has been first solo cellist and harpist at the\r\nAmsterdam Orchestra Union.\r\n\r\nJOHANNES SMITH, born on January 27, 1869, at Arnheim, received his first\r\nCello instruction from Heyn,[133] in Maestricht, where his father had\r\nbeen placed in the Dutch service. Later on the Smith family resided\r\nin Amsterdam and there Ernest Appy was the teacher of the artist boy,\r\nwho went to Dresden in 1883 in order to complete his training on the\r\nVioloncello under Fr. Grützmacher and, in theory, under Felix Draeseke.\r\nSince then Smith has appeared with great success in Leipsic, Dresden,\r\nBerlin, and the Hague, as concert player.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] See p. 97.\r\n\r\n[127] Alphonse d’Eve received the appointment of Choirmaster at the\r\nAntwerp Cathedral on November 5, 1718, having previously directed during\r\na long period the choir of the church of St. Martin in Courtrai. The\r\nannouncement of Fétis that d’Eve composed a solemn Mass in the year\r\n1719, for two choirs, with accompaniment for instruments, amongst which\r\nthere was an obbligato for Violoncello, is a matter of interest to us.\r\n\r\n[128] Fétis points out that he was at the Favart Theatre. Müntzberger,\r\nhowever, calls himself on the title-page of the Cello School:\r\n“Professeur de Violoncelle au Théâtre Feydeau.”\r\n\r\n[129] Fétis gives the year of his birth 1812. His brother, Joseph, was\r\nborn 1816.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[130] For the Cellists, Hegar and Giese, see pp. 130 and 152.\r\n\r\n[131] See p. 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--ENGLAND AND SCANDINAVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special attention which had been devoted to the Viola da Gamba\r\nin England during the seventeenth century[134] was not paid, in\r\nsimilar measure, to the Violoncello. This instrument, like the Gamba,\r\nwas introduced into musical circles in London by Italians. Ariosti,\r\nBononcini, Cervetto, and Caporale--all contributed to make it familiar\r\nin the English capital and other places. But it does not appear that\r\nVioloncello playing was taken up by English artists at first with the\r\nsame alacrity as it was abroad--at all events, as a profession--and\r\nthis left the field open chiefly to foreign Violoncellists, who came to\r\nEngland with the hope of a rich harvest, in which, says M. Wasielewski,\r\nthey were too often disappointed. The number of professional English\r\ncellists is small as compared with those of other countries, though\r\nthere are a few to be mentioned who, in talent and proficiency, will\r\nbear comparison with any of the great players of their time.\r\n\r\nOne of the first is\r\n\r\nBARTHOL. JOHNSON, probably born in 1710, as he is said to have\r\ncelebrated his hundredth birthday at Scarborough, October 3, 1810,\r\nwhen Lord Mulgrave and many distinguished persons were present in the\r\nFreemasons’ Hall. During the evening the centenarian played the Bass of\r\na Minuet on the cello, which he had composed sixty years before. (See\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\nJOHN HEBDEN, who is supposed to have played the Violoncello, was\r\nprobably born at the beginning of the eighteenth century, since his\r\nportrait was engraved by Faber in 1741. He is represented in this\r\nplaying the Gamba. Gerber, at least, seems to have thought it worth\r\nwhile to mention him as a cellist, though Burney writes of a certain\r\nHebden as playing the Bassoon at a concert in London where the best\r\nperformers of the Italian opera were employed.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PAXTON also was a violoncellist, the composer of the well-known\r\nglee “Breathe soft, ye winds,” besides other pieces. Burney praises his\r\n“full and sweet tone, as well as his judicious manner of accompanying\r\nthe voice.” He published amongst his other compositions also six Duos\r\nfor two Violoncellos (Op. 1), eight Duos for Violin and Violoncello (Op.\r\n2), six solos for Violin (Op. 3), four solos for Violin and two for the\r\nVioloncello (Op. 4), twelve easy lessons for Violoncello (Op. 6), and\r\nsix solos for Violoncello (Op. 8). His brother Stephen also composed for\r\nthe Cello.\r\n\r\nJOHN CROSDILL, born in London in 1755,[135] whom Gerber mentions as\r\nan extraordinarily clever Violoncellist, and Fétis as distinguished,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of Mara in England, had a high reputation\r\nin his time. He was educated in the choir of Westminster Abbey under\r\nRobinson and Cooke; on leaving the choir he studied the violoncello\r\nunder his father, and is said to have had instruction from Jean Duport.\r\nHe soon acquired a considerable proficiency, and in 1768 he was elected\r\na member of the Royal Society of Musicians. In the following year he\r\nplayed at the Gloucester Festival, and was appointed first cellist, an\r\nappointment which he held until his retirement. In 1776 he was engaged\r\nas first Violoncellist at the Concerts of Ancient Music, and in 1778\r\nas Violist of the Chapel Royal. He probably went to Paris 1778-9, and\r\nremained nine months, studying under the elder Janson. In 1782 he was\r\nappointed chamber musician to Queen Charlotte, and he also gave lessons\r\nto the Prince of Wales. About 1788 he married a lady of fortune, and\r\nretired from the practice of his profession, appearing publicly for one\r\nday only, in 1821, at the coronation of George IV. He died at Escrick,\r\nin Yorkshire, leaving a considerable fortune to his son, who, by his\r\nfather’s desire, presented a donation of £1,000 to the Society of\r\nMusicians.\r\n\r\nFour other English Cellists of the second half of last century\r\nare--Hardy, Reinagle I. and II., and Gunn.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of HARDY, Henry (of Oxford), beyond the fact that about\r\n1800 he published an instruction book with the title, “The Violoncello\r\nPreceptor, with a compleat set of Scales for fingering in the various\r\nkeys,” &c.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH REINAGLE, born in 1762, at Portsmouth, was the son of a German\r\nmusic teacher who emigrated to England. He was originally intended for\r\nthe navy, but gave it up after his first voyage. He was apprenticed\r\nthen to a goldsmith in Edinburgh, but neither in this did he persevere,\r\nand his father resolved to let him be a musician. He at first chose the\r\ntrumpet as his instrument, on which he acquired some skill, and entered\r\nthe service of the king as trumpeter. He was obliged to give up the\r\nwind instrument on account of his health, and was then Violoncellist,\r\nViolinist, and finally Violoncellist again. For a while he was Concert\r\nDirector in Edinburgh. In 1789 he went to Dublin, and in 1791 to London,\r\nwhere, besides obtaining a good position in the best orchestras, he was\r\nprincipal cello at Salomon’s concerts. He finally settled at Oxford,\r\nwhere he died in 1836. He published, for the Violoncello, thirty Duos\r\nin four books, as Op. 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as a School “Concise\r\nIntroduction to the Art of playing the Violoncello,” which went through\r\nfour editions.\r\n\r\nReinagle’s younger brother, named HUGH, born at Portsmouth in 1766,\r\nreceived his education from Crosdill, and was distinguished for his\r\nunwonted skill. He died while still young, at Lisbon, whither he had\r\ngone for the restoration of his failing health. Of his compositions\r\nappeared three works: two of them, Op. 1 and 2, consist of six Cello\r\nsolos, and Op. 3 contains six Duets for two Violoncellos.\r\n\r\nJOHN GUNN, said to have been born in Edinburgh about 1765, was not\r\nonly a clever cellist, but also a remarkable writer on music. In the\r\nyear 1790 he went to London as a cello teacher. He there published, in\r\n1793, an instruction book for his instrument, under the title of “The\r\nTheory and practice of fingering the Violoncello, containing rules and\r\nprogressive lessons for attaining the knowledge and command of the whole\r\ncompass of the instrument.” Fétis observes, with regard to the preface\r\nof this work, consisting of two parts, that it contains a remarkable\r\naccount of the origin of the Violoncello, as well as of old and modern\r\nstringed instruments.\r\n\r\nGunn wrote another work, published in London in 1801, which has\r\nreference to the Violoncello. The title of it is, “Essay theoretical and\r\npractical on the application of Harmony, Thorough-bass, and Modulation\r\nto the Violoncello.” Besides this he published, in 1794, a “School\r\nof the German flute,” and in 1807 he brought out his most important\r\nwork--viz., “An Historical Inquiry respecting the performance on the\r\nHarp in the Highlands of Scotland from the earliest times until it was\r\ndiscontinued about the year 1734.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1795 Gunn returned to Edinburgh to take up an advantageous\r\npost that was offered to him, and which he apparently held until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe English possessed in ROBERT LINDLEY a Violoncellist of extraordinary\r\ncapacity, who up to the present time has not been equalled, far less\r\nexcelled, by his countrymen. He was born on March 4, 1775,[136] at\r\nRotherham, and began his musical studies when he was about five years\r\nof age, with his father, an amateur performer, who began by teaching\r\nhim the violin, and, at nine years of age, the violoncello. At sixteen\r\nhe had made considerable progress, and the younger Cervetto, hearing\r\nhim play, undertook his gratuitous instruction, and brought him to the\r\nSouth of England. Even at this age he had commenced to compose for\r\nhimself, and was sent for to take the place of the professor who was to\r\nhave played the violoncello solo at one of the Brighton concerts, and\r\nwho had been taken suddenly ill. Lindley’s performance was rapturously\r\napplauded; he played Concertos at several subsequent concerts with the\r\nsame result, and was then engaged for the Theatre, frequently playing\r\nbefore the Prince Regent.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 he succeeded Sperati at the Opera and was principal\r\nVioloncellist at all the concerts of any importance in London. In the\r\nfollowing year began the intimacy with Dragonetti, the celebrated\r\ndouble-bass player, which lasted for fifty-two years. Forster quotes\r\nChorley’s remark that “Nothing could be compared with the intimacy of\r\ntheir mutual musical sympathy.” They played together at the same desk at\r\nthe Opera and every orchestral concert of any importance, and Lindley’s\r\nperformance of the accompaniment to Recitative from figured bass was\r\nmost “elaborate and ingenious.”\r\n\r\nConcerning Lindley’s playing, he was probably the greatest violoncellist\r\nof his time; he was distinguished for the beauty, richness, and extreme\r\npurity of his tone, and his great technical skill was remarkable, though\r\nprobably in this and his manner of rendering he did not equal Romberg.\r\n\r\nThe story is well-known how, when Romberg, during his residence in\r\nEngland, heard him play, and was asked by Salomon what he thought of his\r\nperformance, replied: “He is the devil.” He retired in 1851, and died\r\nJune 13, 1855.\r\n\r\nHis son, William, born in 1802, was also a violoncellist, and gave\r\npromise of future excellence, but nervousness and delicate health\r\nprevented his attaining to any great distinction, and he was compelled\r\nto withdraw from public appearances.\r\n\r\nLindley is less remarkable as a composer. He wrote four Concertos, Duets\r\nfor Violin and Violoncello (Op. 5), Duos for two Violoncellos (Op. 6, 8,\r\n10, and 27), Solos for Violoncello (Op. 9), and several Variations on\r\nAirs, as well as Potpourris.\r\n\r\nAmongst Lindley’s pupils, CHARLES LUCAS, born 1808, in Salisbury, was\r\nthe most remarkable. He received his first musical instruction as\r\nchorister of the Cathedral, under Arthur Thomas Corfe, after which he\r\nattended the Royal Academy of Music in London. In 1830 he was named\r\nComposer and Violoncellist to Queen Adelaide, and performed the duties\r\nof Organist at St. George’s Chapel. Two years later he was entrusted\r\nwith the duties of Orchestra Conductor at the Royal Academy of Music,\r\nand succeeded Cipriani Potter as Principal in 1859. He had already taken\r\nthe place of his master, Lindley, as first Violoncellist of the Italian\r\nOpera. He died on March 23, 1869, in London. His successor in the Opera\r\nwas the cellist, Collins.\r\n\r\nTo Lindley’s contemporaries must be added Cudmore, Crouch, and Powell.\r\n\r\nRICHARD CUDMORE, born in 1787, at Chichester, in Sussex, practised not\r\nonly as cellist, but also as a violin player and pianist. The organist,\r\nForgett, of Chichester, was his first instructor, and from him he\r\nlearned the violin, acquiring such proficiency that at nine years of age\r\nhe played a solo at a concert in his native town. At ten years the elder\r\nReinagle was his master for the Cello, and a year after he appeared\r\nagain at a concert and played his own compositions. He then for two\r\nyears pursued his studies under Salomon’s guidance, in London, when he\r\nreturned to his native town, and remained there for the next nine years.\r\nThe desire of giving himself up anew to the study of the Piano drove\r\nhim again to London, where he subsequently appeared frequently as a\r\nPianist. He accomplished an artistic feat of a remarkable description in\r\nLiverpool by appearing there at a concert, which he himself organised,\r\nsuccessively as Piano, Violin, and Violoncello performer. The solos\r\nwhich he executed were by Kalkbrenner, Rode, and Cervetto. He was also\r\nengaged as Director of the orchestra of the “Gentlemen’s Concerts,” in\r\nManchester, for some years. His diversity of talent was naturally an\r\nimpediment to his distinguishing himself specially in one department.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK WILLIAM NICHOLLS CROUCH, best known as the author of the\r\npopular air “Kathleen Mavourneen,” was born on July 31, 1808, at\r\nDevizes. He studied under Bochsa and W. Hawes and at the Royal Academy,\r\nunder Lindley. He played the cello at Her Majesty’s Theatre, and was\r\nappointed principal cellist at Drury Lane, as well as member of Queen\r\nAdelaide’s band. He went to America with Maretzek, the German composer,\r\nand has fallen into indigent circumstances “through all appearance by\r\nunavoidable misfortune.” Besides numerous other compositions, “Songs of\r\nErin,” “Echoes of the Lakes,” &c., he produced a “Complete Treatise on\r\nthe Violoncello,” Lond., 1827.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS POWELL, born in 1776, in London, early devoted himself to music,\r\nand studied, besides Violoncello playing, the piano and the harp. In\r\n1805 he appeared with success in his native town as solo cellist,\r\nin a Concerto which he had composed. He then established himself in\r\nDublin as a teacher of music. He devoted his leisure to composition\r\nand earnest study of his instrument. His contemporaries considered him\r\nequal to Romberg, though this was probably going somewhat too far, as\r\nPowell’s name was scarcely known out of England, while Romberg, by his\r\nperformances, acquired a world-wide renown.\r\n\r\nAfter several years’ residence in Dublin, Powell took up his permanent\r\nabode in Edinburgh. His published compositions--amongst which is a\r\n“Grand Duo” for Violin and Violoncello--belong for the most part to the\r\nsphere of chamber music.\r\n\r\nWith regard to national English Violoncello playing, modern times have\r\nnot been more productive than the past. Three names come before us for\r\nconsideration--namely, Howell, Whitehouse, and Ould.\r\n\r\nEDWARD HOWELL, born on February 5, 1846, in London, is a pupil of the\r\nRoyal Academy, and specially a pupil of Piatti’s. He belongs to the\r\nItalian Opera as cellist, and since 1872 to Covent Garden Theatre.\r\nBesides this he is Musician in Ordinary to the Queen, Member of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Music, and of the Philharmonic Society. He works as a\r\nteacher at the Royal College of Music and at the Guildhall School. He\r\nis for the most part at all the musical Festivals in London and in the\r\nprovinces, taking an active part.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM EDWARD WHITEHOUSE was born on May 20, 1859, in London, and\r\nreceived instruction at eleven years of age on the violin from\r\nAdolphe Griesbach. At thirteen he showed a decided preference for\r\nthe violoncello and was placed for four years under Walter Pettit. In\r\n1877 he was received into the Royal Academy of Music and studied under\r\nPiatti and Pezze for the violoncello and Banister for harmony. He\r\nhas on various occasions gained prizes and medals, and, in 1882, was\r\nappointed Assistant-Professor, and, in the following year, Professor\r\nof the Royal Academy of Music. In 1883 he was elected Associate of the\r\nsame Institution and, in 1884, member of the Royal Society of Musicians.\r\nHe is also Professor of Cambridge University, of the Royal College of\r\nMusic, of King’s College, London, and Manchester New College of Music\r\nunder Sir Charles Hallé. During Piatti’s absence Mr. Whitehouse has\r\nfrequently taken his place at the Saturday and Monday Popular Concerts\r\nand has for some years been connected with Josef Ludwig’s annual series\r\nof chamber concerts. The instrument on which Whitehouse plays is one of\r\nthe finest specimens of Francisco Ruggierius.\r\n\r\nCHARLES OULD, born at Romford, in Essex, came as quite a child to\r\nLondon, where he has remained ever since. Until he was sixteen years of\r\nage he practised flute playing and singing; but the wind instrument was\r\nabandoned for the Violoncello. He received his first instruction from\r\na member of the orchestra of the Italian Opera in London. A few years\r\nlater the Belgian cellist, Paque, was his master. Ould is Musician in\r\nOrdinary to Her Majesty, and also works as first Cellist at the Richter\r\nConcerts, as well as at all concerts of any importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSCANDINAVIA has, up to the present, only produced a very modest number\r\nof noteworthy Violoncellists, and these belong exclusively to modern\r\ntimes. It must, indeed, not be overlooked that the serious encouragement\r\nof instrumental music was taken up much later in the North than in\r\nItaly, Germany, and France. Denmark set a good example to her Northern\r\nneighbours, Sweden and Norway. The middle of the last century produced a\r\nnoteworthy Violin player, who belonged to the Royal band in Copenhagen.\r\nAbout the same period there was no lack of able Cellists. But their\r\nnames did not attain to any great publicity. This was the case with\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN KELLERMAN. He is a native of Randers, in Jutland, and was born\r\non January 27, 1815. It was his father’s wish that he should devote\r\nhimself to commerce, but in this he was disappointed. Young Kellerman\r\nhad inclinations for Art and, in order to gratify them, he went, in his\r\nfifteenth year, to Merk, in Vienna, whose pupil he was from 1830-1835.\r\nAfter having finished his studies he was heard with success in Vienna\r\nand visited with good result the other large cities of Austria and\r\nHungary. In the year 1837 he gave concerts at St. Petersburg. Further\r\ntours increased his reputation and, after his return, he was summoned\r\nto be first Violoncellist in the Royal Danish orchestra. During the\r\nyear 1861 he made a journey which led him into Upper Italy and then to\r\nGermany, where he remained until 1864. In Mayence he was, unfortunately,\r\nstricken with paralysis. He was, indeed, able to return again in a\r\nhelpless condition to Copenhagen, but he died there two years after, on\r\nDecember 3, 1866. Kellerman composed a few things for his instrument,\r\nbut nothing of much importance. His successor was F. RAUCH, whose pupil,\r\nRÜDINGER, filled the place of first Violoncellist in the Copenhagen\r\nBand.\r\n\r\nFRITZ ALBERT CHRISTIAN RÜDINGER was born in 1838 at Copenhagen. After\r\nhe had gone through a preparatory course under Rauch, he received an\r\nappointment in the Royal Orchestra, but two years later he went to\r\nDresden, to F. Grützmacher, whose pupil he was for some time. Having\r\nreturned home, he again filled his former place as chamber musician,\r\nfrom which he was transferred, in 1874, to be first Cellist. He at the\r\nsame time accepted the Professorship at the Copenhagen Conservatoire and\r\nhe also takes part in the regular concerts and chamber music soirées of\r\nhis birthplace.\r\n\r\nNext to Rüdinger, SIEGFRIED NEBELONG must be mentioned as a Scandinavian\r\nartist. He went as a boy of five to Copenhagen, and later received his\r\ntraining as Cellist from Friedrich Grützmacher, in Dresden.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[132] See p. 153.\r\n\r\n[133] Alfred Heyn, a pupil of Fr. Grützmacher, was then solo cellist in\r\nthe municipal orchestra at Aix and now lives at Darmstadt. Compare p.\r\n138.\r\n\r\n[134] See p. 15.\r\n\r\n[135] Grove’s Dictionary gives the date of birth as 1751. Leslie\r\nStephen, 1751 or 1755.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n[136] Grove gives 1776 as the date of his birth.--(_Tr._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE SLAV STATES AND HUNGARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Violoncello was brought to Russia, as already pointed out (p. 67),\r\nby means of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp’s private band. Joh. Adam\r\nHiller’s _Wöchentliche Nachrichten die Musikbetreffend_ of May 21, 1770,\r\ncontains the following: “When the Duke Carl Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp\r\n(Peter the Great’s future son-in-law) fled to the Russian Imperial\r\nCourt, during the distressed condition of his country, in the year\r\n1720, he conveyed with him the members of his small private band. It\r\nconsisted of about a dozen German well-trained musicians, of whom the\r\nmost famous were two brothers, Hübner--the one was Kapellmeister and\r\nthe other Concertmeister. The selection of music, until then unheard in\r\nRussia, consisted of Sonatas, Solos, Trios, and Concertos, by Telemann,\r\nKeiser, Heinichen, Schulz, Fuchs, and other famous Germans of the time,\r\nas well as by Corelli, Tartini, Porpora, and various Italian composers;\r\nbut the instruments were a Piano, some Violins, besides a Viol d’Amore,\r\nan Alto, a Violoncello or Bassetto, a Contra-Basso, or great Bass\r\nViolin, a couple of Hautboys, a couple of German Flutes, two French\r\nHorns, two Trumpets, and Kettle Drums. Peter the Great was not only very\r\noften present at these ducal chamber concerts, but almost every week\r\nhad them to play once at his Court. This music, therefore, met with\r\ngeneral approbation, as it appeared to distinguished Russians more novel\r\nand more agreeable, when compared with other music, than any they had\r\nhitherto heard.... From that time many Russians offered themselves to\r\nbe taught by these German musicians, in order to study music on various\r\ninstruments. The Emperor Peter II. also took lessons on the Violoncello,\r\nfrom the clever master of that instrument, Riedel, a Silesian, who was\r\nalso a good fencing master, and instructed the young Emperor likewise in\r\nthat knightly art.”\r\n\r\nDuring the life of the Empress Anna, the chamber music once introduced\r\ninto the Russian Court was retained there, and in the absence of\r\nnational artists was strengthened by drawing into it foreign talent.\r\nKing August II. of Poland also contributed to this by giving up\r\n“some Italian virtuosi from his superfluity.” Amongst these was the\r\nVioloncellist, GASPARO. Later on GIUSEPPE DALL’OGLIO, from Padua, was\r\nattracted to the Russian Court. In the place of this artist--who, in\r\n1763, after a twenty years’ service took his leave in order to return\r\nhome--came the Italian, CICIO POLLIARI. To this period belongs the first\r\nRussian Violoncellist, named CHORSCHEVSKY, who received a place in the\r\nImperial band. Up to the present, however, in regard to the Violoncello,\r\nand especially with respect to orchestral instruments, Russia has\r\nremained mainly dependent for supply from abroad. Nevertheless, since\r\nthe middle of last century, the Cello has been cultivated with success\r\nby some Russian amateurs. Their names are--Prince TRUBETZKOI, Baron\r\nSTROGANOW, and more recently Count MATTHEW WIELHORSKI. The latter,\r\na pupil of Bernhard Romberg, specially distinguished himself by his\r\nperformances. One of his nephews also, Count JOSEPH WIELHORSKI, who,\r\nwith his talented brother MICHAEL, a pupil of Kieseweter and Romberg,\r\nlived in Moscow, played uncommonly well both the Violoncello and the\r\nPiano. Robert Schumann, who in 1844, during his residence in the\r\nKremlin, had intercourse with both Counts, expressed himself most\r\nenthusiastically in a letter to Fr. Wieck concerning Michael Wielhorski,\r\ndeclaring he was the most highly gifted dilettante he had ever met\r\nwith.[137] MICHAEL WIELHORSKI was born in Volhynia in 1787, and died in\r\n1856. The Wielhorski family was of Polish descent, and took up their\r\nresidence in Russia after the third division of Poland.\r\n\r\nAt the present time amongst Russian amateurs who play the Violoncello,\r\nPrince TENISCHEFF and the Senator MARKEWITSCH are distinguished; the\r\nGrand Duke CONSTANTINE NIKOLAJEWITSCH also, a pupil of J. Seifert\r\nalready mentioned, is a zealous Violoncello player.\r\n\r\nThe first really remarkable cellist whom Russia can call her own is\r\n\r\nKARL DAVIDOFF. He may be reckoned amongst the most famous\r\nrepresentatives of his instrument at the present time. He was born on\r\nMarch 15, 1838, in the little Courland town, Goldingen, where he only\r\nspent, however, the two first years of his life, as his parents went\r\nto Moscow in 1840. He there began his studies with H. SCHMIDT, who was\r\nfirst Cellist at the Moscow Theatre. He carried on his further studies\r\nunder H. Schuberth, in St. Petersburg. He received his theoretical\r\ntraining from Moritz Hauptmann, in Leipsic, where he appeared at the\r\nGewandhaus Concert towards the end of 1859. This was such a brilliant\r\n_début_ that, when Fried. Grützmacher was called away from Leipsic to\r\nDresden in 1860, Davidoff was offered his place, which he accepted.\r\nHe did not, however, long fill it, having conceived the desire of\r\nundertaking a tour, which led him into Holland. He then travelled\r\nthrough Russia, when he returned to St. Petersburg. Not long after he\r\nwas appointed Imperial solo cellist, and somewhat later (1862) teacher\r\nat the Imperial Conservatoire. In 1874 he took part in the concerts of\r\nthe Paris Conservatoire. Two years after he was named Director of the\r\nRussian Imperial Musical Society in St. Petersburg, as well as Director\r\nof the Conservatoire there. He gave up the latter about two years ago.\r\n\r\nDavidoff’s playing is especially distinguished for its perfect accuracy,\r\nas well as by a clever and easy mastery of the greatest difficulties.\r\nHis Cello compositions consist of several Concertos and a collection of\r\nagreeable Drawing-room Pieces.\r\n\r\nAmongst his pupils are ALBRECHT, KOUSNETZOFF, GLEEN, and WERGBILOWITSCH.\r\nThe latter is famous for a fine, full tone. He played the Violoncello in\r\nthe Auer String Quartet at St. Petersburg, and is also appreciated as a\r\nsolo player.\r\n\r\nTo the most noteworthy cellists of St. Petersburg belongs also ARVED\r\nPOORTEN, born at Riga in 1835. He was Kummer’s pupil in Dresden, and\r\nattended the Brussels Conservatoire afterwards. When he had played\r\nduring tours in Russia, Belgium, and Holland, he became a member of the\r\nRussian Imperial band and teacher at the St. Petersburg Conservatoire.\r\nSix “Morceaux caractéristiques” for his instrument appeared in print by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmongst the younger Russian Cello players of importance must be\r\nmentioned: BRANDOUKOFF, DANIELSCHENKO, and SARADSCHEFF. These owe their\r\ntraining to William Fitzenhagen,[138] in Moscow.\r\n\r\nANATOLE BRANDOUKOFF, born in 1859 at Moscow, was Fitzenhagen’s pupil\r\nin the Imperial Conservatoire of his birthplace, from September, 1870,\r\nto May, 1878, and received as an acknowledgment on his departure\r\nfrom the said institution for the distinction he had gained, a gold\r\nmedal together with an honourable diploma. His first journey was to\r\nSwitzerland, where he gave concerts in Berne and Geneva with success.\r\nHe afterwards went to Paris in 1879, appeared there and in other\r\nFrench towns, and then proceeded to London. He everywhere experienced\r\nfavourable receptions. He gave concerts with extraordinary success\r\nduring the winter of 1887-1888 at Moscow and St. Petersburg. He chose\r\nParis as his permanent residence, where he is greatly appreciated not\r\nonly as a solo player, but also as a quartet player. Until now only a\r\nConcerto of his Cello compositions has appeared and a few small pieces.\r\n\r\nPETER DANIELSCHENKO, born at Kiev in 1860, pursued his studies under\r\nFitzenhagen, in the Moscow Conservatoire, from 1873-1880. He was\r\ndismissed from there with the small gold medal as well as an honourable\r\ndiploma, and, besides, received a special prize for composition. For a\r\nyear he was then teacher of Cello playing and theory at the Imperial\r\nMusic School in Charkow. During that time he appeared at concerts\r\nsuccessfully in South Russia, and had a brilliant success in 1881\r\nat the Great Exhibition in Moscow. He now entered the Imperial Band\r\nand undertook the Cello instruction at the Institute of Music of the\r\nPhilharmonic Society. He remained in that position until 1887. Since\r\nthen he has travelled in Switzerland, France, and South Russia.\r\n\r\nIVAN SARADSCHEFF, born at Tiflis, in the Caucasus, in 1863, received his\r\ntraining as cellist from Fitzenhagen at the Imperial Conservatoire in\r\nMoscow, during the years 1879-1886. Distinguished by the grant of the\r\ngreat silver medal together with a diploma, after his departure from the\r\nConservatoire he undertook the direction of the Imperial Music School at\r\nTambov, but soon exchanged this place, in 1887, for that offered to him\r\nof teacher to the Imperial Music School of his birthplace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmongst the Slavonian people, the Bohemians take the most prominent\r\nplace, having ever distinguished themselves above others of their race\r\nin all that relates to music. The Bohemian Violoncellists of German\r\nextraction have already been noticed in the fifth section of this work.\r\nWe shall now consider those of distinctly Slavonic descent.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Bohemian Cellist of whom we have any information, is\r\n\r\nIGNAZ MARA, born about 1721 in Deutschbrod. He united to a fine\r\nintonation an execution full of expression. In 1742 he went to\r\nBerlin, was there married, and was received, apparently through the\r\nrecommendation of his countryman, the Concertmaster, Franz Benda,\r\ninto the Royal band, to which he belonged for more than thirty years.\r\nMara died in Berlin in 1783. Of his Cello compositions, consisting of\r\nConcertos, several solo pieces and Duets, nothing has been printed.\r\n\r\nHis son, JOHANN BAPTIST, was more widely known. This was not due to his\r\nartistic endowments only, but to the dissipated wild life into which\r\nhe fell from middle age in consequence of intemperate habits. Endowed\r\nwith extraordinary musical talent, under the guidance of his father, he\r\ndeveloped, during a proportionately short time, into such an excellent\r\nCellist that Prince Henry of Prussia named him Chamber Musician. As\r\nhe possessed a talent for mimicry, he had also to assist on the stage\r\nat the theatrical representations which took place in the Castle of\r\nRheinsberg, inhabited by the Prince.\r\n\r\nMara was born on July 20, 1744. In the year 1773 he married the\r\ncelebrated singer, Elizabeth Schmeling, who, at that time, belonged to\r\nthe Berlin Opera. He made use of the large sums paid to his wife to\r\ngratify his passions, which led to many disasters and to matrimonial\r\ndisturbances. Besides this he contracted debts. These irregularities\r\nincreased to such an extent that his creditors were called together\r\nagainst him by the supreme court. As he had otherwise incurred the\r\nking’s displeasure, he resolved, in agreement with his wife, to get\r\naway secretly by night, but the attempted flight of the married couple\r\nwas stopped, and Mara condemned to imprisonment. After he had again\r\nbeen set at liberty by the intercession of his wife, he succeeded once\r\nmore, in 1780, in escaping with her, to avoid the tyranny of the King.\r\nThey took the road by Vienna and Paris to London, where they arrived\r\nin 1784. During the year 1788-1789, they travelled in Italy, returned\r\nto London in 1790, went from thence to Venice, and then lived in London\r\nuntil 1792, where Frau Mara, wearied with the restless, wandering life\r\nof her husband, finally separated from him in 1799. Mara now returned\r\nto Berlin, but fell into straitened circumstances from having become\r\nunaccustomed to work and having neglected his art. He appeared, however,\r\nat one concert and then went to Sondershausen, where Gerber heard him,\r\nthe author of the well-known Musical Lexicon, who said of him that he\r\nso finely rendered his Adagio, no orchestra need be ashamed of his\r\nplaying; “and if, so continues Gerber, any one of his tones was out of\r\ntune, it was not the fault of his handling, but the bad and unequal\r\nstringing of his instrument. Perhaps his show pieces deserved less\r\ncredit, which, however, appeared to be entirely in accordance with the\r\ntaste of forty years ago. In other ways he conducted himself, while he\r\nwas there, as a serious, accomplished, and thoroughly educated man, and\r\ngave not the slightest sign of inclination to intemperance. But he was\r\nin needy circumstances, and although his noble-minded wife had been\r\nfrightfully disgusted at what she had suffered from him, yet in spite\r\nof this he was, from time to time, supplied by her with considerable\r\nsums of money.” Mara’s end was a sad one. He went, as Gerber further\r\nsays, to Holland, where “his unhappy inclination for drink so gained\r\nthe upper hand, that after having lost all sense of honour, he used\r\nto play for dancing, day and night, in sailors’ inns and miserable\r\nbeer-houses, until at last, in the summer of 1808, at Schiedam, near\r\nRotterdam, death set him free from this wretched life.” The Violoncello\r\ncompositions of Mara, which consist of two Concertos, twelve Solos with\r\nBass accompaniment, a Duet with Violin, and a Sonata with Bass, remained\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, JOSEPH ZYKA,[139] was about twenty years older than Jos.\r\nBaptist Mara. He received his education as Violoncellist at Prague, and\r\nbelonged, from 1743-1764, to the Electoral band in Dresden. He then went\r\nwith his son FREIDERICH, who was likewise a good cellist, as chamber\r\nmusician to Berlin, where, according to Fétis, in 1791, he died; but,\r\naccording to Fürstenau, at the beginning of our century. He is said to\r\nhave left behind him, in manuscript, several Concertos.\r\n\r\nJOHANN HETTISCH is distinguished as a remarkable Violoncellist. Born\r\nin 1748, in the Bohemian town Liblin, he was educated at the Piaristi\r\nCollege at Schlan, and then went to Prague in order to train as a\r\nmusician. There he still was in the year 1772. Later, and indeed in\r\n1788, he was, as Gerber asserts, employed at Lemberg in the Imperial\r\ncivil service, from which it appears that in the flower of his age he\r\nhad abandoned the practice of Art as a vocation. His playing seems to\r\nhave been distinguished especially for its rich tone. According to\r\nFétis, he left several Concertos and Cello Solos in manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic priest, FRANZ MENSI, born on March 27, 1753, at Bistra,\r\nwhere his father was tutor to Count Hohenems, early occupied himself\r\nwith music, and when his parents went to Prague he became Joseph\r\nReicha’s pupil for Violoncello playing while Cajetan Vogel instructed\r\nhim in theory. Mensi also played the Violin. On both instruments he was\r\nconsidered clever, and not less so in composition. Some of his works,\r\nwhich consist of church music, Symphonies, and Quartets, are said to be\r\npreserved in the convent at Strahow. In the year 1808, Mensi was still\r\nliving and working as curé at Pher. He also had some pupils, amongst\r\nthese were JOH. BRODECZKY, WENZEL CZIŽEK, and Count SPORK.\r\n\r\nJ. STIASTNY (Stiasny) should be mentioned as one of the most\r\ndistinguished Bohemian Cellists. He was born in Bohemia (according\r\nto Fétis at Prague) in 1774. The information regarding his education\r\nand his life are very limited. He is said to have been in the Prague\r\nOrchestra in 1800. On the title-page of his Op. 3, consisting of a\r\nDivertimento for Violoncello, he describes himself as Violoncellist\r\nto the Grand Duke at Frankfort. As the brief existence of the Grand\r\nDuchy of Frankfort, of which the Regent was Prince Primate of Dalberg,\r\noccurred within the years 1810-1814, there can scarcely be a doubt\r\nthat Stiastny resided at Frankfort during that time. Later, about\r\n1820, he bore the title of “Musical Director of Nuremberg,” and in\r\nthat year lived at Mannheim. He appears to have gone from there to\r\nGreat Britain, for many of his later works--as, for example, the “Trois\r\nDuos Concertans” (Op. 8) and the “Six pièces faciles” (Op. 9)--are\r\ndedicated to Englishmen. Amongst these compositions the Concertino\r\n(Op. 7), dedicated to Robert Lindley, may be favourably distinguished\r\nfrom similar productions among the Cello compositions at that period.\r\nThe remaining Cello pieces of J. Stiastny, which consist of Variations\r\n(Op. 10), Rondo and Variations (Op. 12), two Sonatas with Bass (Op.\r\n2), twelve light pieces for two Cellos (Op. 4), six similar ones (Op.\r\n5), three Concerted Duos (Op. 6), and Six Solos with Bass (Op. 11)\r\nare qualified to be placed amongst the best productions of the older\r\nCello literature, as they contained effects which for that period were\r\nentirely novel.\r\n\r\nAmongst Stiastny’s pupils, JOSEPH VALENTIN DONT was remarkable for his\r\nperformances as quartet and orchestra player. Born on April 15, 1776, at\r\nNieder-Georgenthal, in Bohemia, he received instructions from Stiastny\r\nin Prague, where he attended the school. In the year 1804 he was\r\nenrolled into the opera orchestra of the Vienna Kärnthnerthor Theatre,\r\nfrom which he was transferred to the Burg Theatre orchestra in 1828.\r\nOn December 14, 1833, he died. His son, named Jacob, is the Viennese\r\nviolinist, who died on November 18, 1888, and who was well known by the\r\npublication of his excellent practical works for the Violin.\r\n\r\nStiastny’s elder brother, BERNHARD WENCESLAUS, born at Prague, 1770,\r\nwas also a Violoncellist, and was employed as first performer of his\r\ninstrument in the orchestra of the Prague Theatre. Six Sonatas for\r\ntwo Violoncellos, and two instruction works were published by him.\r\nThe first, entitled “Il maëstro e lo scolare, 8 imitazioni e 6 pezzi\r\ncon fughe per due violoncelli”; the other is a cello school, entitled\r\n“Méthode de Violoncelle,” in two parts. This school is carefully worked\r\nout, though somewhat too elaborately, and yet not exhaustively; for the\r\ncomplicated technique of cello playing, especially as regards the thumb\r\nposition, has not received adequate consideration.\r\n\r\nAmong the younger Bohemian cellists, WLADISLAW ALOIS is distinguished,\r\nwho was born June 15, 1860, at Prague, and received his artistic\r\neducation at the Conservatoire there. At the end of 1878 he went to\r\nKiev, where he gave instruction in the Institute of Music of the Musical\r\nSociety on the Violoncello and Piano. In this place he remained for\r\nseven years. Since September, 1887, he has been occupied as Solo Cellist\r\nat the Imperial Theatre, as well as at the Conservatoire in Warsaw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Poles have produced a longer list of violoncellists. They began with\r\nFRANZ XAVER WOCZITKA, a most distinguished artist in his department,\r\nwho was born in Vienna about 1730. In 1756 he entered the service\r\nof the Court of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was subsequently member of\r\nthe Electoral band at Munich, where he died. He left behind him in\r\nmanuscript Concertos and Sonatas for Violoncello, which were highly\r\nprized in their time.\r\n\r\nNICOL ZYGMANTOWSKI, born in 1770, in Poland. Gerber asserts that\r\nalready, as a child of six years and nine months, he attracted the\r\nadmiration of all who were witnesses of his artistic proficiency; he\r\ndied young. The Polish Count Oginski,[140] who was formerly much noted\r\nas a composer of Polonaises, says in his “Lettres sur la Musique,” that\r\nhe had heard Zygmantowski when he was twelve years old, and adds that he\r\npossessed a wonderful talent.\r\n\r\nANTON HEINRICH RADZIWILL, Count of Otyka and Nieswicz, born on June\r\n13, 1775, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, had a great musical talent,\r\nand was not only an agreeable Violoncellist but also a Composer. In\r\nthe latter capacity he was extensively known through his music to\r\nGoethe’s “Faust.” For the Violoncello he published only one work,\r\n“Complainte de Marie Stuart,” with Piano accompaniment. The remainder\r\nof his published compositions consist of vocal pieces, of which one is\r\narranged with guitar and cello accompaniment. He was appointed by the\r\nKing of Prussia, in 1815, Governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen, and\r\ndied in this prominent position on April 7, 1833. He spent a part of\r\nthe year generally at Berlin. His house there was the centre of artist\r\ncelebrities.\r\n\r\nKORCZMIET, properly KALTSCHMIDT, of German descent, an accomplished\r\nvirtuoso player, lived and worked, from 1811 to 1817, at Wilna. He had\r\nin his possession a magnificent Stradivarius Cello, which had formerly\r\nbelonged to Count Michael Wielhorsky. This instrument is now in the\r\npossession of Davidoff. There are no more particulars extant concerning\r\nKorczmiet.\r\n\r\nADAM HERMANN, born in 1800, at Warsaw, likewise of German descent, was\r\nmember of the Imperial Opera orchestra, and teacher at the Conservatoire\r\nat Warsaw, where, about 1875, he died. During the years 1830-1875 he\r\nformed a great number of pupils, of whom, besides his son ADAM, only\r\nKOMOROWSKI, THALGRÜN, MONIUSZKO, and KONTSKI will be mentioned.\r\n\r\nADAM HERMANN, the son, who changed his name into the Polish form of\r\nHERMANOWSKI, was born at Warsaw in 1836, received the first Cello\r\ninstruction from his father, and in 1852 attended the Brussels\r\nConservatoire for further training as a pupil of Servais. Dismissed\r\nfrom there after two years with the first prize, he returned home and\r\nundertook successful tours in Poland and Russia. He is at present living\r\nin the most absolute retirement at Warsaw.\r\n\r\nIGNAZ KOMOROWSKI, born on February 24, 1824, at Warsaw, belonged for\r\nmany years to the theatre orchestra there, after which he benefited by\r\nthe instruction of Adam Hermann, the father. As a composer he attained\r\ngreat popularity in his native land by his charming songs, full of\r\npoetical sentiment. He died on October 14, 1857.\r\n\r\nSTANISLAUS THALGRÜN, of German descent, was born on August 16, 1843, at\r\nWarsaw, and is member of the theatre orchestra in his own country.\r\n\r\nBOLESLAW MONIUSZKO, born on October 25, 1845, son of the well-known\r\nPolish composer Moniuszko, belongs at the present time to the Warsaw\r\nTheatre orchestra.\r\n\r\nFinally, SIGISMUND KONTSKI settled in St. Petersburg, after having\r\nfinished his training under Hermann.\r\n\r\nIn chronological order, after Hermann (senior), follows SAMUEL\r\nKOSSOWSKI, born in Galicia in 1805. He was almost entirely self-taught\r\nand, notwithstanding, reached a high degree as a virtuoso on the\r\nVioloncello. During the years 1842-1852 he performed at concerts, with\r\nsuccess, in Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw, Kiev, &c. He died in 1851 at Kobryn,\r\nin the province of Grodno.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH SZABLINSKI, born on June 18, 1809, at Warsaw, was employed as\r\nfirst Cellist at the Imperial Theatre for more than forty years. He\r\nwas distinguished for his fine tone and pure musical rendering. He was\r\nespecially famous as a quartet player.\r\n\r\nSTANISLAUS SZCZEPANOWSKI, born, 1814, at Cracow, was so accomplished\r\nas a Violoncello and Guitar player that during the year 1839 he was\r\nable to present himself as a Concert-giver with unusual success on both\r\ninstruments in France and England. He was also favourably heard in\r\nBerlin. He died in 1875.\r\n\r\nMORITZ KARASOWSKI, born on September 22,[141] 1823, at Warsaw, was a\r\npupil of Valentin Kratzer, at that time director of music there, for\r\nVioloncello and Piano playing, and was, in 1852, member of the Warsaw\r\nTheatre orchestra. In the years 1858 and 1860 he travelled for the sake\r\nof study and visited Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, Munich, Cologne, and\r\nParis. Since 1864 he has belonged to the Dresden band as Royal Chamber\r\nMusician. Besides some compositions for the voice and Violoncello with\r\npiano accompaniment, of which “Rêverie du soir,” a Nocturne, and an\r\nElegy are the most important, he published several books in the Polish\r\nlanguage--as, for example: “A History of the Polish Opera” (1859),\r\n“Haydn’s and Mozart’s Life” (1860 and 1868), “Chopin’s Youth” (Part\r\nI. in 1862, Part II. in 1869), and Biographical Sketches of Robert\r\nSchumann, Franz Liszt, and Edmund Kretschmer. His most important work\r\nin musical literature is “Friedrich Chopin: his Life, his Works, and his\r\nLetters.” A German translation of the latter appeared in 1877 which went\r\nthrough two revised and enlarged editions.\r\n\r\nJOHANN KARLOWICZ, born on May 28, 1836, in Lithuania, received his\r\ntraining as Cellist from Julius Lyko in Wilna, Göbella in Moscow,\r\nSebastian Lee, finally from Servais also in Brussels. For some years he\r\nassisted in the instruction at Warsaw Conservatoire. In his native land\r\nKarlowicz enjoys the reputation of a learned linguist.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADAMOWSKI, born in 1862 in Warsaw, perfected his studies--after\r\nhe had attended the music school in his native city for some time--under\r\nFitzenhagen, at the Moscow Conservatoire, in the years 1877-1883. On his\r\nleaving he was distinguished by the presentation of a diploma and of the\r\ngreat silver medal. After he had made some Concert journeys in Poland\r\nand Galicia, he was appointed teacher at the Cracow Conservatoire, to\r\nwhich he belonged until 1887. Since then he has been without a post and\r\nis only engaged as a Concert player. Adamowski has the reputation of\r\nbeing a clever Violoncellist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Hungarian Violoncellists, only Kletzer and Hegyesi have made\r\nthemselves known beyond their own country.\r\n\r\nFERY KLETZER, born in 1830 in Hungary, travelled during his sixteenth\r\nyear giving concerts. His performances showed more than ordinary\r\ntalent, but were wanting in the higher artistic training. He attained,\r\nhowever, to a certain reputation, as his name was at the time frequently\r\nmentioned in the newspapers. Since then he has disappeared from public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLOUIS HEGYESI holds a much higher position. He was born on November\r\n3, 1853, at Arpas; at eight years of age he went to Vienna, and there\r\nreceived his first instruction from the Violoncellist, Denis. Later\r\non, he was received into the Vienna Conservatoire and thus became\r\nSchlesinger’s pupil. In order still further to prosecute his training he\r\nwent, in 1865, to Franchomme in Paris. The outbreak of the Franco-German\r\nwar obliged him, in the summer of 1870, to return to Vienna, where he\r\nfound a post in the orchestra of the Grand Opera. Five years later he\r\ntook Hilpert’s place in the Florentine Quartet, to which he belonged\r\nuntil it was dissolved. From that time Hegyesi has travelled as a\r\nsoloist. In 1887 he responded to an invitation to Cologne as first\r\nCellist of the Gürzenich Concerts and teacher at the Rhenish School of\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137] See Rob. Schumann’s biography, by the author of this book (Auf.\r\nIII., p. 195). Leipsic: Breitkopf and Härtel.\r\n\r\n[138] See p. 133.\r\n\r\n[139] Fétis says that Zyka was born about 1730. But his birth must have\r\nbeen earlier, for according to Fürstenau’s account (History of Music and\r\nthe Theatre at the Electoral Court of Saxony), he had been already, in\r\n1743, appointed to the Dresden band, though Fétis erroneously makes him\r\na member only in 1756.\r\n\r\n[140] Michael Kleophas, Count Oginski, was born at Gurow, near Warsaw,\r\non September 25, 1765, and died in Florence on October 31, 1833. He was\r\nHigh Treasurer of Lithuania.\r\n\r\n[141] Not on September 2, as occasionally given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn taking a retrospective glance at the progressive development which\r\nVioloncello playing has displayed from the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, it is evident that this branch of Art has reached so great a\r\ndegree of perfection that it seems scarcely possible it can rise much\r\nhigher. This result is not only to be ascribed to the deserving work of\r\nthe leading Violoncellists--and here must be called to mind, besides\r\nRomberg and Dotzauer, pre-eminently Friedrich Kummer, Aug. Franchomme,\r\nand François Servais--but also to those famous German composers who\r\nbrought the Violoncello within the sphere of their productions.\r\n\r\nAlready had Haydn and Mozart appropriated to this noble instrument, in\r\ntheir String Quartets, passages which contributed to the furtherance of\r\nthe technique and the possibility of expression. Beethoven went much\r\nfarther even than this. Not only in his String and Pianoforte Trios, as\r\nwell as in his Quartets, but also in his Sonatas (Op. 5,[142] 69, and\r\n102) and in the so-called Triple Concerto (Op. 56), he increased the\r\ndemands on the Violoncello to such an extent that in certain respects a\r\nreal impulse was given to the artistic manipulation of the instrument.\r\nAt the same time, the works referred to had a stimulating effect on\r\nthe productive work of the future in the field of Cello compositions,\r\nwhich received a considerable accession in regard to Sonatas especially.\r\nWe will note here only the names of the best known composers, who\r\nused their genius in this direction. They follow in alphabetical\r\norder: W. STERNDALE BENNETT, JOH. BRAHMS, FR. CHOPIN, FR. GERNSHEIM,\r\nEDV. GRIEG, FERD. HILLER, FRIEDRICH KIEL, FRANZ LACHNER, FELIX\r\nMENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY, IGNAZ MOSCHELES, GEORG ONSLOW, JOACHIM RAFF, KARL\r\nREINECKE, JOS. RHEINBERGER, ANT. RUBINSTEIN, CHARLES SAINT-SAËNS, XAVER\r\nSCHARWENKA, BERNHARD SCHOLZ, and W. TAUBERT.\r\n\r\nThe following have written Concertos for the Violoncello: ALBERT\r\nDIETRICH, E. ECKERT, BERNH. MOLIQUE, JOACH. RAFF, KARL REINECKE, ANTON\r\nRUBINSTEIN, SAINT-SAËNS, ROBERT SCHUMANN, W. TAUBERT, and ROB. VOLKMANN.\r\nThe Concerto which has lately appeared by JOH. BRAHMS, for Violin and\r\nVioloncello, must also be mentioned.\r\n\r\nBesides these there exist a number, by no means small, of greater and\r\nlesser Cello compositions, which deserve to be prominently brought\r\nforward--as, for example: MAX BRUCH’S “Kol Nidrei,” Op. 47; CHOPIN’S\r\nIntroduction and Polonaise Brilliant, Op. 3, and Duo Concertant\r\non Themes from “Robert le Diable” (the Cello part is Franchomme’s\r\nproduction); FR. GERNSHEIM’S Hebrew song, “Elohenu”; FERD. HILLER’S\r\nConcertstück, Op. 104; Duo for Pianoforte and Violoncello, Op. 22, and\r\ntwo Serenades, Op. 109; FR. LACHNER’S Serenade for four Violoncellos,\r\nOp. 29, and Elegy for five Violoncellos, Op. 160; LIMMER’S Trio for\r\nthree Violoncellos and Quartet for four Violoncellos; M. MARX’S three\r\nQuartets for four Violoncellos; MAURER’S Nocturne for four Violoncellos;\r\nFELIX MENDELSSOHN’S Variations for Pianoforte and Violoncello, Op. 17;\r\nIGN. MOSCHELES’S Duo Concertant, Op. 34; L. PAPE’S six Serenades for\r\nfour Violoncellos; F. E. REINECKE’S “Three Pieces,” Op. 146; FERD.\r\nRIES’S “Air russe varié,” as well as Introduction and Rondo “Sur une\r\ndanse russe”; ROB. SCHUMANN’S five “Stücke im Volkston,” Op. 102; and\r\nlikewise L. SPOHR’S Potpourri for Violin and Violoncello on Themes from\r\n“Jessonda.”[143]\r\n\r\nIf to these be added the numberless compositions which Violoncellists\r\nof our century have produced in Concertos, Concert pieces, Variations,\r\nFantasias, and Duets for their instrument, it must be admitted that\r\nVioloncello literature in the course of time has increased very\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\nThe “Etudes” compositions for the Violoncello left much to be desired\r\nduring the first decade of the present century. On this account the\r\ntheorist Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn, of some consideration in his time, and\r\nwho occupied himself in his younger years with Cello playing, may have\r\nbeen induced to arrange a portion--twenty-two in number--of the Kreutzer\r\nViolin studies for the Violoncello. This work, however, published\r\nby him in June, 1831, cannot be accounted a particularly successful\r\naccomplishment. The finger and bow technique of the Violoncello require\r\nan entirely different manner of treatment from that of the Violin. And\r\nas these Studies were written according to the capacities of the latter\r\ninstrument it is evident they can only be made available in a limited\r\ndegree for the Violoncello. It is not then to be wondered at that the\r\nKreutzer “Etudes,” transcribed by Dehn with the best intention, should\r\nhave fallen into oblivion, since Violoncellists have more and more\r\nsought after a thoroughly suitable system of “Etudes” literature, which\r\nhas now grown to be a very rich field. During the last ten years the\r\nsolo manipulation of the Violoncello has, in certain respects, undergone\r\na change to its advantage in a very remarkable manner. The higher and\r\nhighest tones of the instrument are no longer unduly preferred, as in\r\nRomberg’s time; but the tenor positions, more in accordance with its\r\ncharacter, are chiefly used, without, however, neglecting altogether\r\nthe lower and the higher parts. The execution of passages has greatly\r\ngained thereby. In this respect, it is true, the Violoncello cannot\r\nrival the Violin in brilliancy and agility. The strings of the former\r\nbeing so much longer and thicker, of which the two lower ones are made\r\nof correspondingly stout wire, form a natural impediment to the rapid\r\nemission of tones in quick runs and groups. In addition the somewhat\r\nmuffled, though at the same time powerful and full tone of the deeper\r\nstrings renders difficult a brilliant execution. This is felt more\r\nespecially in Violoncello Concertos with full orchestral accompaniment.\r\nThe Violoncello has, however, this advantage: that it lends itself far\r\nless to virtuoso exaggerations and confusions than does the easily\r\nportable violin, so favourably disposed for every variety of unworthy\r\ntrifling. The masculine character of the Violoncello, better adapted for\r\nsubjects of a serious nature, precludes this. But then this instrument\r\ndoes not offer the same wealth in means of execution which the Violin is\r\ncapable of developing as a solo instrument. In harmonics and _pizzicato_\r\nindeed it is at least equal to it, but in the speed and flexibility of\r\npassages, as well as in double-stopped playing, its limits are defined.\r\nIt follows that on account of the larger dimensions of the Violoncello,\r\nand the character of the instrument, double-stopped combinations are far\r\nless suitable for the deeper than for the higher strings, a circumstance\r\nof which there is no question at all on the Violin.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest points which the Violoncello possesses in its\r\nfavour is its suitability as a solo instrument in _Cantilena_ playing,\r\nin which it is not surpassed by any other. If the Violin, with melting\r\nsoprano and tenor-like voice, speaks to us now with maidenly tenderness,\r\nnow in clear jubilant tones, the Violoncello, grandly moving for the\r\nmost part in the tenor and bass positions, stirs the soul by its\r\nfascinating sonority and its imposing power of intonation, not less than\r\nby the pathos of its expression, which by virtue of its peculiar quality\r\nof tone more specially belongs to it than to the Violin.\r\n\r\nThere is no rivalry between the two instruments, but rather do they\r\nmutually enhance each other’s power. Even so is it with the themes which\r\ndevolve on each in the sphere of chamber and orchestral music. It is\r\ngreatly to be desired that future generations may foster and maintain\r\nwhat has been done for the art of Violoncello playing in so meritorious\r\na manner by unwearied, self-sacrificing labour; but it is to be hoped,\r\nat the same time, that the technique of the instrument, so carefully and\r\nfinely formed, to the subject of which this book is dedicated, may be\r\never applied in the service of true and noble Art only.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY.\r\n\r\nAt p. 107, I said that only Johann Baptist Baumgärtner’s tutor (p. 76)\r\ncould give an explanation concerning the method practised in Germany,\r\nwith regard to the fourth finger in the thumb position, during the\r\nsecond half of the last century. It was only after this was in the\r\npress that the title of a second German Violoncello School of that time\r\nbecame known to me. It is that of Kauer, who was formerly distinguished\r\nas an operetta composer in Vienna--“Concise explanation how to play the\r\nVioloncello”--which appeared in 1788. It may probably be seen from this\r\nwork of instruction what the opinion was at that time regarding the\r\nfourth finger in the case referred to.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[142] In all probability Beethoven’s Cello Sonatas (Op. 5), composed at\r\nlatest in 1796, were the first of their kind. The Sonatas for Piano and\r\nVioloncello, written by Bonifazio Asioli, of which F. Grützmacher has\r\nbrought out a new edition, appeared, as may be concluded from the dates\r\ngiven by Fétis in his “Biographie Universelle,” Vol. I, p. 155, first at\r\nthe beginning of our century.\r\n\r\n[143] I have only mentioned above the most noteworthy portion of the\r\nnewer and newest Violoncello compositions. For the remainder I refer to\r\nPhilippe Roth’s “Guide to Violoncello Literature” (Breitkopf and Härtel,\r\nLeipsic, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nIn England, the best violoncello as well as violin bow-maker was John\r\nDodd, who lived and died at Kew; indeed, his cello bows are considered\r\nsuperior to his violin bows. _See_ Ed. Heron Allen “On Violin-making,\r\n&c.”\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nThe _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of 1814 records his death thus in the\r\nObituary, February 14: “At Scarborough, in his 104th year, Mr. Barth.\r\nJohnson, a celebrated musical character. He possessed to the last a\r\nvigorous mind and strong retentive memory.”\r\n\r\nIn the “History of Scarborough from the earliest date,” by Joseph\r\nBrogden Baker, among the biographical notices, is the following:--\r\n\r\n    “JOHNSON, BARTHOLOMEW.\r\n\r\n    “Johnson, Barth., was born at Wykeham, near Scarborough,\r\n    October 3rd, 1710. He resided at Scarborough from the time of his\r\n    apprenticeship to the time of his death. He was for seventy years\r\n    one of the ‘town waits.’ As a musician, and for the many excellent\r\n    traits in his character, he universally preserved the esteem of a\r\n    highly respectable circle of friends. His constitution naturally\r\n    was vigorous, and he lived to a great age. In 1810 he completed\r\n    his hundredth year, which was celebrated by a jubilee dinner and\r\n    musical performance at the Freemasons’ Lodge, Scarborough, and a\r\n    medal was struck as a memorial of this event; about ten o’clock at\r\n    night the good old man bore a part in a quartette, performing on\r\n    the violoncello the bass to a Minuet which he himself had composed\r\n    upwards of sixty years before. Lord Mulgrave, the Honourable Henry\r\n    Phipps, the Bailiffs, and about seventy gentlemen, visitors and\r\n    residents of Scarborough and the neighbourhood, honoured the meeting\r\n    with their company. Congratulatory letters from the borough members\r\n    were read, whilst several poetical compositions, suitable to the\r\n    occasion, from the classic pens of Archdeacon Wrangham and Thomas\r\n    Hinderwell, Esq., were recited and sung. Lord Mulgrave afterwards\r\n    commissioned the late J. Jackson, R.A., to paint the portrait of the\r\n    venerable old man, which was presented to the Corporation by his\r\n    lordship and now adorns the council chamber of the Town Hall. In\r\n    1814 he departed this life in the 104th year of his age.”\r\n\r\nA similar account, from which, perhaps, the above facts were taken, is\r\nto be found in “The History and Antiquities of Scarborough,” by Thomas\r\nHinderwell, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nREINAGLE.\r\n\r\nA whimsical circumstance, which I cannot forbear mentioning, happened to\r\nReinagle:--\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Mr. Curran introduced himself to Reinagle and invited\r\nhim to dine with some musical friends at his country house, five miles\r\nfrom Dublin. Reinagle, anxious to embrace the opportunity of enjoying\r\nthat great man’s society, most willingly assented, upon which Curran,\r\nbeing in great haste, would not permit our musician to seek for any\r\nconveyance, but requested him to ride double on his horse. In this\r\nludicrous way, sitting behind Mr. Curran, they reached his house, to the\r\namusement of many friends they met on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLA DA GAMBA, &C.\r\n\r\nGERLE, HANS.--Musica Teusch, auf die Instrument der grossen vnnd kleinen\r\nGeygen, auch Lautten, &c.
