Tyler\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Press\r\nCambridge · Massachusetts\r\nPrinted in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book I have tried to embody the chief results derived from a\r\nstudy of all the materials known to me, in print and in manuscript,\r\nrelating to Patrick Henry,--many of these materials being now used for\r\nthe first time in any formal presentation of his life.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great popular interest attaching to the name of\r\nPatrick Henry, he has hitherto been the subject of but one memoir\r\nfounded on original investigation, and that, of course, is the Life\r\nby William Wirt. When it is considered, however, that Wirt's book was\r\nfinished as long ago as the year 1817,--before the time had fairly\r\ncome for the publication of the correspondence, diaries, personal\r\nmemoranda, and official records of every sort, illustrating the great\r\nperiod covered by Patrick Henry's career,--it will be easy to infer\r\nsomething as to the quantity and the value of those printed materials\r\nbearing upon the subject, which are now to be had by us, but which\r\nwere not within the reach of Wirt. Accordingly, in his lack of much\r\nof the detailed testimony that then lay buried in inaccessible\r\ndocuments, Wirt had to trust largely to the somewhat imaginative\r\ntraditions concerning Patrick Henry which he found floating in the\r\nair of Virginia; and especially to the supposed recollections of old\r\npeople,--recollections which, in this case, were nearly always vague,\r\nnot always disinterested, often inaccurate, and generally made up of\r\nemotional impressions rather than of facts. Any one who will take the\r\ntrouble to ascertain the enormous disadvantages under which Wirt\r\nwrote, and which, as we now know, gave him great discouragement, will\r\nbe inclined to applaud him for making so good a book, rather than to\r\nblame him for not making a better one.\r\n\r\nIt is proper for me to state that, besides the copious printed\r\nmaterials now within reach, I have been able to make use of a large\r\nnumber of manuscripts relating to my subject. Of these may be\r\nspecified a document, belonging to Cornell University, written by a\r\ngreat-grandson of Patrick Henry, the late Rev. Edward Fontaine, and\r\ngiving, among other things, several new anecdotes of the great orator,\r\nas told to the writer by his own father, Colonel Patrick Henry\r\nFontaine, who was much with Patrick Henry during the later years of\r\nhis life. I may add that, through the kindness of the Hon. William\r\nWirt Henry of Richmond, I have had access to the manuscripts which\r\nwere collected by Wirt for the purposes of his book, but were only in\r\npart used by him. With unstinted generosity, Mr. Henry likewise placed\r\nin my hands all the papers relating to his illustrious grandfather,\r\nwhich, during the past thirty years or more, he has succeeded in\r\nbringing together, either from different branches of the family, or\r\nfrom other sources. A portion of the manuscripts thus accumulated by\r\nhim consists of copies of the letters, now preserved in the Department\r\nof State, written by Patrick Henry, chiefly while governor of\r\nVirginia, to General Washington, to the president of Congress, to\r\nVirginia's delegation in Congress, and to the Board of War.\r\n\r\nIn the very front of this book, therefore, I record my grateful\r\nacknowledgments to Mr. William Wirt Henry; acknowledgments not alone\r\nfor the sort of generosity of which I have just spoken, but for\r\nanother sort, also, which is still more rare, and which I cannot so\r\neasily describe,--his perfect delicacy, while promoting my more\r\ndifficult researches by his invaluable help, in never once encumbering\r\nthat help with the least effort to hamper my judgment, or to sway it\r\nfrom the natural conclusions to which my studies might lead.\r\n\r\nFinally, it gives me pleasure to mention that, in the preparation of\r\nthis book, I have received courteous assistance from Mr. Theodore F.\r\nDwight and Mr. S. M. Hamilton of the library of the Department of\r\nState; from the Rev. Professor W. M. Hughes, of Hobart College; and\r\nfrom the Rev. Stephen H. Synnott, rector of St. John's, Ithaca.\r\n\r\n                                                     M. C.

Joseph Blount Cheshire, Jr., D. D., Bishop of North\r\nCarolina, and Mr. William Wirt Henry.\r\n\r\n                                                     M. C.

This lady, at first supposing her guest\r\nto be some new suitor for her lately disengaged affections, \"put on a\r\nGravity that becomes a Weed;\" but so soon as she learned her mistake\r\nand the name of her distinguished visitor, she \"brighten'd up into an\r\nunusual cheerfulness and Serenity. She was a portly, handsome Dame, of\r\nthe Family of Esau, and seem'd not to pine too much for the Death of\r\nher Husband, who was of the Family of the Saracens.... This widow is a\r\nperson of a lively & cheerful Conversation, with much less Reserve than\r\nmost of her Countrywomen. It becomes her very well, and sets off her\r\nother agreeable Qualities to Advantage. We tost off a Bottle of honest\r\nPort, which we relisht with a broil'd Chicken. At Nine I retir'd to my\r\nDevotions, And then Slept so Sound that Fancy itself was Stupify'd,\r\nelse I shou'd have dreamt of my most obliging Landlady.\" The next day\r\nbeing Sunday, \"the courteous Widow invited me to rest myself there that\r\ngood day, and go to Church with Her, but I excus'd myself by telling\r\nher she wou'd certainly spoil my Devotion. Then she civilly entreated\r\nme to make her House my Home whenever I visited my Plantations, which\r\nmade me bow low, and thank her very kindly.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNot very long after that notable visit, the sprightly widow gave her\r\nhand in marriage to a young Scotchman of good family, John Henry, of\r\nAberdeen, a protégé and probably a kinsman of her former husband; and\r\ncontinuing to reside on her estate of Studley, in the county of\r\nHanover, she became, on May 29, 1736, the mother of Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\nThrough the lineage of both his parents, this child had some claim to\r\nan inheritance of brains. The father, a man of firm and sound\r\nintellect, had been liberally educated in Scotland; among the country\r\ngentlemen of his neighborhood in Virginia, he was held in high esteem\r\nfor superior intelligence and character, as is shown by the positions\r\nhe long held of county surveyor, colonel of his regiment, and\r\npresiding judge of the county court; while he could number among his\r\nnear kinsmen at home several persons of eminence as divines, orators,\r\nor men of letters,--such as his uncle, William Robertson, minister of\r\nBorthwick in Mid Lothian and afterward of the Old Greyfriars' Church\r\nin Edinburgh; his cousin, David Henry, the successor of Edward Cave in\r\nthe management of the \"Gentleman's Magazine;\" and especially his\r\ncousin, William Robertson, principal of the University of Edinburgh,\r\nand author of the \"History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V.\"\r\nMoreover, among the later paternal relatives of Patrick Henry may be\r\nmentioned one person of oratorical and forensic genius very brilliant\r\nand in quality not unlike his own. Patrick Henry's father was second\r\ncousin to that beautiful Eleanor Syme of Edinburgh, who, in 1777,\r\nbecame the wife of Henry Brougham of Brougham Hall, Westmoreland.\r\nTheir eldest son was Lord Brougham, who was thus the third cousin of\r\nPatrick Henry. To some it will perhaps seem not a mere caprice of\r\ningenuity to discover in the fiery, eccentric, and truculent eloquence\r\nof the great English advocate and parliamentary orator a family\r\nlikeness to that of his renowned American kinsman; or to find in the\r\nfierceness of the champion of Queen Caroline against George IV., and\r\nof English anti-slavery reform and of English parliamentary reform\r\nagainst aristocratic and commercial selfishness, the same bitter and\r\neager radicalism that burned in the blood of him who, on this side of\r\nthe Atlantic, was, in popular oratory, the great champion of the\r\ncolonies against George III., and afterward of the political autonomy\r\nof the State of Virginia against the all-dominating centralization\r\nwhich he saw coiled up in the projected Constitution of the United\r\nStates.[2]\r\n\r\nThose, however, who knew the mother of Patrick Henry, and her family,\r\nthe Winstons, were accustomed to think that it was from her side of\r\nthe house that he derived the most characteristic traits not only of\r\nhis genius, but of his disposition. The Winstons of Virginia were of\r\nWelsh stock; a family marked by vivacity of spirit, conversational\r\ntalent, a lyric and dramatic turn, a gift for music and for eloquent\r\nspeech, at the same time by a fondness for country life, for\r\ninartificial pleasures, for fishing and hunting, for the solitude and\r\nthe unkempt charms of nature. It was said, too, of the Winstons that\r\ntheir talents were in excess of their ambition or of their energy, and\r\nwere not brought into use except in a fitful way, and under the\r\nstimulus of some outward and passing occasion. They seem to have\r\nbelonged to that very considerable class of persons in this world of\r\nwhom more might have been made. Especially much talk used to be heard,\r\namong old men in Virginia, of Patrick Henry's uncle, his mother's own\r\nbrother, William Winston, as having a gift of eloquence dazzling and\r\nwondrous like Patrick's, nay, as himself unsurpassed in oratory among\r\nall the great speakers of Virginia except by Patrick himself.[3]\r\n\r\nThe system of education prevailing in Virginia during Patrick Henry's\r\nearly years was extremely simple. It consisted of an almost entire\r\nlack of public schools, mitigated by the sporadic and irregular\r\nexercise of domestic tuition. Those who could afford to import\r\ninstruction into their homes got it, if they desired; those who could\r\nnot, generally went without. As to the youthful Patrick, he and\r\neducation never took kindly to each other. From nearly all quarters\r\nthe testimony is to this effect,--that he was an indolent, dreamy,\r\nfrolicsome creature, with a mortal enmity to books, supplemented by a\r\npassionate regard for fishing-rods and shot-guns; disorderly in dress,\r\nslouching, vagrant, unambitious; a roamer in woods, a loiterer on\r\nriver-banks; having more tastes and aspirations in common with\r\ntrappers and frontiersmen than with the toilers of civilized life;\r\ngiving no hint nor token, by word or act, of the possession of any\r\nintellectual gift that could raise him above mediocrity, or even up to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring the first ten years of his life, he seems to have made, at a\r\nsmall school in the neighborhood, some small and reluctant progress\r\ninto the mysteries of reading, writing, and arithmetic; whereupon his\r\nfather took personal charge of the matter, and conducted his further\r\neducation at home, along with that of other children, being aided in\r\nthe task by the very competent help of a brother, the Rev. Patrick\r\nHenry, rector of St. Paul's parish, in Hanover, and apparently a good\r\nScotch classicist. In this way our Patrick acquired some knowledge of\r\nLatin and Greek, and rather more knowledge of mathematics,--the latter\r\nbeing the only branch of book-learning for which, in those days, he\r\nshowed the least liking. However, under such circumstances, with\r\nlittle real discipline, doubtless, and amid plentiful interruptions,\r\nthe process of ostensible education went forward with the young man;\r\nand even this came to an end by the time that he was fifteen years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nAt that age, he was duly graduated from the domestic schoolroom into\r\nthe shop of a country tradesman hard by. After an apprenticeship there\r\nof a single year, his father set him up in trade, joining with him in\r\nthe conduct of a country store his elder brother, William, a youth\r\nmore indolent, if possible, as well as more disorderly and\r\nuncommercial, than Patrick himself. One year of this odd partnership\r\nbrought the petty concern to its inevitable fate. Just one year after\r\nthat, having attained the ripe age of eighteen, and being then\r\nentirely out of employment, and equally out of money, Patrick rounded\r\nout his embarrassments, and gave symmetry to them, as it were, by\r\ngetting married,--and that to a young woman quite as impecunious as\r\nhimself. The name of this damsel was Sarah Shelton; her father being a\r\nsmall farmer, and afterward a small tavern-keeper in the neighborhood.\r\nIn the very rashness and absurdity of this proceeding on the part of\r\nthese two interesting young paupers, irresistibly smitten with each\r\nother's charms, and mutually resolved to defy their own helplessness\r\nby doubling it, there seems to have been a sort of semi-ludicrous\r\npathos which constituted an irresistible call for help.\r\n\r\nThe parents on both sides heard the call, and by their joint efforts\r\nsoon established the young couple on a little farm near at hand, from\r\nwhich, by their own toil, reënforced by that of half a dozen slaves,\r\nthey were expected to extort a living. This experiment, the success of\r\nwhich depended on exactly those qualities which Patrick did not then\r\npossess,--industry, order, sharp calculation, persistence,--turned out\r\nas might have been predicted. At the end of two years he made a forced\r\nsale of some of his slaves, and invested the proceeds in the stock of\r\na country store once more. But as he had now proved himself to be a\r\nbad farmer, and a still worse merchant, it is not easy to divine by\r\nwhat subtle process of reasoning he had been able to conclude that\r\nthere would be any improvement in his circumstances by getting out of\r\nagriculture and back into merchandise.\r\n\r\nWhen he undertook this last venture he was still but a youth of\r\ntwenty. By the time that he was twenty-three, that is, by the autumn\r\nof 1759, he had become convinced that his little store was to prove\r\nfor him merely a consumer of capital and a producer of bad debts; and\r\nin view of the necessity of soon closing it, he had ample excuse for\r\ntaking into consideration what he should do next. Already was he the\r\nhappy father of sundry small children, with the most trustworthy\r\nprospect of a steady enlargement and multiplication of his paternal\r\nhonors. Surely, to a man of twenty-three, a husband and a father, who,\r\nfrom the age of fifteen, had been engaged in a series of enterprises\r\nto gain his livelihood, and had perfectly failed in every one of them,\r\nthe question of his future means of subsistence must have presented\r\nitself as a subject of no little pertinence, not to say urgency.\r\nHowever, at that time Patrick seems to have been a young fellow of\r\nsuperabounding health and of inextinguishable spirits, and even in\r\nthat crisis of his life he was able to deal gayly with its problems.\r\nIn that very year, 1759, Thomas Jefferson, then a lad of sixteen, and\r\non his way to the College of William and Mary, happened to spend the\r\nChristmas holidays at the house of Colonel Nathan Dandridge, in\r\nHanover, and there first met Patrick Henry. Long afterward, recalling\r\nthese days, Jefferson furnished this picture of him:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Henry had, a little before, broken up his store, or\r\n     rather it had broken him up; but his misfortunes were not to\r\n     be traced either in his countenance or conduct.\" \"During the\r\n     festivity of the season I met him in society every day, and\r\n     we became well acquainted, although I was much his\r\n     junior.... His manners had something of coarseness in them.\r\n     His passion was music, dancing, and pleasantry. He excelled\r\n     in the last, and it attached every one to him.\"[4]\r\n\r\nShortly after Jefferson left those hilarious scenes for the somewhat\r\nmore restrained festivities of the little college at Williamsburg,\r\nPatrick succeeded in settling in his own mind what he was going to do\r\nnext. He could not dig, so it seemed, neither could he traffic, but\r\nperhaps he could talk. Why not get a living by his tongue? Why not be\r\na lawyer?\r\n\r\nBut before we follow him through the gates of that superb\r\nprofession,--gates which, after some preliminary creaking of the\r\nhinges, threw open to him the broad pathway to wealth, renown,\r\nunbounded influence,--let us stop a moment longer on the outside, and\r\nget a more distinct idea, if we can, of his real intellectual outfit\r\nfor the career on which he was about to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Byrd Manuscripts_, ii. 79, 80.\r\n\r\n[2] I have from private sources information that Brougham was aware of\r\nhis relationship to Patrick Henry, and that in recognition of it he\r\nshowed marked attentions to a grand-nephew of Patrick Henry, the late\r\nW. C. Preston, of South Carolina, when the latter was in England.\r\nMoreover, in his _Life and Times_, i. 17, 18, Brougham declares that\r\nhe derived from his maternal ancestors the qualities which lifted him\r\nabove the mediocrity that had always attached to his ancestors on the\r\npaternal side.\r\n\r\n[3] Wirt, 3.\r\n\r\n[4] In a letter to Wirt, in 1815, _Life of Henry_, 14, 15; also\r\n_Writings of Jefferson_, vi. 487, 488, where the letter is given,\r\napparently, from the first draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWAS HE ILLITERATE?\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the quality and extent of Patrick Henry's early education,\r\nit is perhaps impossible now to speak with entire confidence. On the\r\none hand there seems to have been a tendency, in his own time and\r\nsince, to overstate his lack of education, and this partly, it may be,\r\nfrom a certain instinctive fascination which one finds in pointing to\r\nso dramatic a contrast as that between the sway which the great orator\r\nwielded over the minds of other men and the untrained vigor and\r\nilliterate spontaneity of his own mind. Then, too, it must be admitted\r\nthat, whatever early education Patrick Henry may have received, he\r\ndid, in certain companies and at certain periods of his life, rather\r\ntoo perfectly conceal it under an uncouth garb and manner, and under a\r\npronunciation which, to say the least, was archaic and provincial.\r\nJefferson told Daniel Webster that Patrick Henry's \"pronunciation was\r\nvulgar and vicious,\" although, as Jefferson adds, this \"was forgotten\r\nwhile he was speaking.\"[5] Governor John Page \"used to relate, on the\r\ntestimony of his own ears,\" that Patrick Henry would speak of \"the\r\nyearth,\" and of \"men's naiteral parts being improved by larnin';\"[6]\r\nwhile Spencer Roane mentions his pronunciation of China as\r\n\"Cheena.\"[7] All this, however, it should be noted, does not prove\r\nilliteracy. If, indeed, such was his ordinary speech, and not, as some\r\nhave suggested, a manner adopted on particular occasions for the\r\npurpose of identifying himself with the mass of his hearers, the fact\r\nis evidence merely that he retained through his mature life, on the\r\none hand, some relics of an old-fashioned good usage, and, on the\r\nother, some traces of the brogue of the district in which he was born,\r\njust as Edmund Pendleton used to say \"scaicely\" for scarcely, and as\r\nJohn Taylor, of Caroline, would say \"bare\" for bar; just as Thomas\r\nChalmers always retained the brogue of Fifeshire, and Thomas Carlyle\r\nthat of Ecclefechan. Certainly a brogue can never be elegant, but as\r\nit has many times coexisted with very high intellectual cultivation,\r\nits existence in Patrick Henry does not prove him to have been\r\nuncultivated.\r\n\r\nThen, too, it must be remembered that he himself had a habit of\r\ndepreciating his own acquaintance with books, and his own dependence\r\non them. He did this, it would seem, partly from a consciousness that\r\nit would only increase his hold on the sympathy and support of the\r\nmass of the people of Virginia if they should regard him as absolutely\r\none of themselves, and in no sense raised above them by artificial\r\nadvantages. Moreover, this habit of self-depreciation would be brought\r\ninto play when he was in conversation with such professed devourers of\r\nbooks as John Adams and Jefferson, compared with whom he might very\r\nproperly feel an unfeigned conviction that he was no reader at all,--a\r\nconviction in which they would be quite likely to agree with him, and\r\nwhich they would be very likely to express. Thus, John Adams mentions\r\nthat, in the first intimacy of their friendship begun at the Congress\r\nof 1774, the Virginian orator, at his lodgings, confessed one night\r\nthat, for himself, he had \"had no public education;\" that at fifteen\r\nhe had \"read Virgil and Livy,\" but that he had \"not looked into a\r\nLatin book since.\"[8] Upon Jefferson, who of course knew Henry far\r\nlonger and far more closely, the impression of his disconnection from\r\nbooks seems to have been even more decided, especially if we may\r\naccept the testimony of Jefferson's old age, when his memory had taken\r\nto much stumbling, and his imagination even more to extravagance than\r\nin his earlier life. Said Jefferson, in 1824, of his ancient friend:\r\n\"He was a man of very little knowledge of any sort. He read nothing,\r\nand had no books.\"[9]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are certain facts concerning Henry's early\r\neducation and intellectual habits which may be regarded as pretty\r\nwell established. Before the age of ten, at a petty neighborhood\r\nschool, he had got started upon the three primary steps of knowledge.\r\nThen, from ten to fifteen, whatever may have been his own irregularity\r\nand disinclination, he was member of a home school, under the\r\nimmediate training of his father and his uncle, both of them good\r\nScotch classical scholars, and one of them at least a proficient in\r\nmathematics. No doubt the human mind, especially in its best estate of\r\njuvenile vigor and frivolity, has remarkable aptitude for the\r\nrepulsion of unwelcome knowledge; but it can hardly be said that even\r\nPatrick Henry's gift in that direction could have prevented his\r\nbecoming, under two such masters, tolerably well grounded in Latin, if\r\nnot in Greek, or that the person who at fifteen is able to read Virgil\r\nand Livy, no matter what may be his subsequent neglect of Latin\r\nauthors, is not already imbued with the essential and indestructible\r\nrudiments of the best intellectual culture.\r\n\r\nIt is this early initiation, on the basis of a drill in Latin, into\r\nthe art and mystery of expression, which Patrick Henry received from\r\nmasters so competent and so deeply interested in him, which helps us\r\nto understand a certain trait of his, which puzzled Jefferson, and\r\nwhich, without this clue, would certainly be inexplicable. From his\r\nfirst appearance as a speaker to the end of his days, he showed\r\nhimself to be something more than a declaimer,--indeed, an adept in\r\nlanguage. \"I have been often astonished,\" said Jefferson, \"at his\r\ncommand of proper language; how he obtained the knowledge of it I\r\nnever could find out, as he read little, and conversed little with\r\neducated men.\"[10] It is true, probably, that we have no perfect\r\nreport of any speech he ever made; but even through the obvious\r\nimperfections of his reporters there always gleams a certain\r\nsuperiority in diction,--a mastery of the logic and potency of fitting\r\nwords; such a mastery as genius alone, without special training,\r\ncannot account for. Furthermore, we have in the letters of his which\r\nsurvive, and which of course were generally spontaneous and quite\r\nunstudied effusions, absolutely authentic and literal examples of his\r\nordinary use of words. Some of these letters will be found in the\r\nfollowing pages. Even as manuscripts, I should insist that the letters\r\nof Patrick Henry are witnesses to the fact and quality of real\r\nintellectual cultivation: these are not the manuscripts of an\r\nuneducated person. In penmanship, punctuation, spelling, syntax, they\r\nare, upon the whole, rather better than the letters of most of the\r\ngreat actors in our Revolution. But, aside from the mere mechanics of\r\nwritten speech, there is in the diction of Patrick Henry's letters the\r\nnameless felicity which, even with great natural endowments, is only\r\ncommunicable by genuine literary culture in some form. Where did\r\nPatrick Henry get such literary culture? The question can be answered\r\nonly by pointing to that painful drill in Latin which the book-hating\r\nboy suffered under his uncle and his father, when, to his anguish,\r\nVirgil and Livy detained him anon from the true joys of existence.\r\n\r\nWirt seems to have satisfied himself, on evidence carefully gathered\r\nfrom persons who were contemporaries of Patrick Henry, that the latter\r\nhad received in his youth no mean classical education; but, in the\r\nfinal revision of his book for publication, Wirt abated his statements\r\non that subject, in deference to the somewhat vehement assertions of\r\nJefferson. It may be that, in its present lessened form, Wirt's\r\naccount of the matter is the more correct one; but this is the proper\r\nplace in which to mention one bit of direct testimony upon the\r\nsubject, which, probably, was not known to Wirt. Patrick Henry is said\r\nto have told his eldest grandson, Colonel Patrick Henry Fontaine, that\r\nhe was instructed by his uncle \"not only in the catechism, but in the\r\nGreek and Latin classics.\"[11] It may help us to realize something of\r\nthe moral stamina entering into the training which the unfledged\r\norator thus got that, as he related, his uncle taught him these maxims\r\nof conduct: \"To be true and just in all my dealings. To bear no malice\r\nnor hatred in my heart. To keep my hands from picking and stealing.\r\nNot to covet other men's goods; but to learn and labor truly to get my\r\nown living, and to do my duty in that state of life unto which it\r\nshall please God to call me.\"[12]\r\n\r\nUnder such a teacher Patrick Henry was so thoroughly grounded, at\r\nleast in Latin and Greek grammar, that when, long afterward, his\r\neldest grandson was a student in Hampden-Sidney College, the latter\r\nfound \"his grandfather's examinations of his progress in Greek and\r\nLatin\" so rigorous that he dreaded them \"much more than he did his\r\nrecitations to his professors.\"[13] Colonel Fontaine also states that\r\nhe was present when a certain French visitor, who did not speak\r\nEnglish, was introduced to Governor Henry, who did not speak French.\r\nDuring the war of the Revolution and just afterwards a similar\r\nembarrassment was not infrequent here in the case of our public men,\r\namong whom the study of French had been very uncommon; and for many of\r\nthem the old colonial habit of fitting boys for college by training\r\nthem to the colloquial use of Latin proved to be a great convenience.\r\nColonel Fontaine's anecdote implies, what is altogether probable, that\r\nPatrick Henry's early drill in Latin had included the ordinary\r\ncolloquial use of it; for he says that in the case of the visitor in\r\nquestion his grandfather was able, by means of his early stock of\r\nLatin words, to carry on the conversation in that language.[14]\r\n\r\nThis anecdote, implying Patrick Henry's ability to express himself\r\nin Latin, I give for what it may be worth. Some will think it\r\nincredible, and that impression will be further increased by the\r\nfact that Colonel Fontaine names Albert Gallatin as the visitor\r\nwith whom, on account of his ignorance of English, the conversation\r\nwas thus carried on in Latin. This, of course, must be a mistake;\r\nfor, at the time of his first visit to Virginia, Gallatin could\r\nspeak English very well, so well, in fact, that he went to Virginia\r\nexpressly as English interpreter to a French gentleman who could not\r\nspeak our language.[15] However, as, during all that period,\r\nGovernor Henry had many foreign visitors, Colonel Fontaine, in his\r\nsubsequent account of that particular visitor, might easily have\r\nmisplaced the name without thereby discrediting the substance of his\r\nnarrative. Indeed, the substance of his narrative, namely, that he,\r\nColonel Fontaine, did actually witness, in the case of some foreign\r\nvisitor, such an exhibition of his grandfather's good early training\r\nin Latin, cannot be rejected without an impeachment of the veracity\r\nof the narrator, or at least of that of his son, who has recorded\r\nthe alleged incident. Of course, if that narrative be accepted as\r\nsubstantially true, it will be necessary to conclude that the\r\nJeffersonian tradition of Patrick Henry's illiteracy is, at any\r\nrate, far too highly tinted.\r\n\r\nThus far we have been dealing with the question of Patrick Henry's\r\neducation down to the time of his leaving school, at the age of\r\nfifteen. It was not until nine years afterward that he began the study\r\nof the law. What is the intellectual record of these nine years? It is\r\nobvious that they were years unfavorable to systematic training of\r\nany sort, or to any regulated acquisition of knowledge. During all\r\nthat time in his life, as we now look back upon it, he has for us the\r\naspect of some lawless, unkempt genius, in untoward circumstances,\r\ngroping in the dark, not without wild joy, towards his inconceivable,\r\ntrue vocation; set to tasks for which he was grotesquely unfit;\r\nblundering on from misfortune to misfortune, with an overflow of\r\nunemployed energy and vivacity that swept him often into rough fun,\r\ninto great gusts of innocent riot and horseplay; withal borne along,\r\nfor many days together, by the mysterious undercurrents of his nature,\r\ninto that realm of reverie where the soul feeds on immortal fruit and\r\ncommunes with unseen associates, the body meanwhile being left to the\r\nsemblance of idleness; of all which the man himself might have given\r\nthis valid justification:--\r\n\r\n      \"I loafe and invite my soul,\r\n  I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these nine years of groping, blundering, and seeming\r\nidleness were not without their influence on his intellectual\r\nimprovement even through direct contact with books. While still a boy\r\nin his teens, and put prematurely to uncongenial attempts at\r\nshopkeeping and farmkeeping, he at any rate made the great discovery\r\nthat in books and in the gathering of knowledge from books could be\r\nfound solace and entertainment; in short, he then acquired a taste for\r\nreading. No one pretends that Patrick Henry ever became a bookish\r\nperson. From the first and always the habit of his mind was that of\r\ndirect action upon every subject that he had to deal with, through his\r\nown reflection, and along the broad primary lines of common sense.\r\nThere is never in his thought anything subtle or recondite,--no mental\r\nmovement through the media of books; but there is good evidence for\r\nsaying that this bewildered and undeveloped youth, drifting about in\r\nchaos, did in those days actually get a taste for reading, and that he\r\nnever lost it. The books which he first read are vaguely described as\r\n\"a few light and elegant authors,\"[16] probably in English essays and\r\nfiction. As the years passed and the boy's mind matured, he rose to\r\nmore serious books. He became fond of geography and of history, and he\r\npushed his readings, especially, into the history of Greece and of\r\nRome. He was particularly fascinated by Livy, which he read in the\r\nEnglish translation; and then it was, as he himself related it to\r\nJudge Hugh Nelson, that he made the rule to read Livy through \"once at\r\nleast in every year during the early part of his life.\"[17] He read\r\nalso, it is apparent, the history of England and of the English\r\ncolonies in America, and especially of his own colony; for the latter\r\nfinding, no doubt, in Beverley and in the grave and noble pages of\r\nStith, and especially in the colonial charters given by Stith, much\r\nmaterial for those incisive opinions which he so early formed as to\r\nthe rights of the colonies, and as to the barriers to be thrown up\r\nagainst the encroaching authority of the mother country.\r\n\r\nThere is much contemporaneous evidence to show that Patrick Henry was\r\nthroughout life a deeply religious person. It certainly speaks well\r\nfor his intellectual fibre, as well as for his spiritual tendencies,\r\nthat his favorite book, during the larger part of his life, was\r\n\"Butler's Analogy,\" which was first published in the very year in\r\nwhich he was born. It is possible that even during these years of his\r\nearly manhood he had begun his enduring intimacy with that robust\r\nbook. Moreover, we can hardly err in saying that he had then also\r\nbecome a steady reader of the English Bible, the diction of which is\r\nstamped upon his style as unmistakably as it is upon that of the elder\r\nPitt.\r\n\r\nSuch, I think it may fairly be said, was Patrick Henry when, at the\r\nage of twenty-four, having failed in every other pursuit, he turned\r\nfor bread to the profession of the law. There is no evidence that\r\neither he or any other mortal man was aware of the extraordinary gifts\r\nthat lay within him for success in that career. Not a scholar surely,\r\nnot even a considerable miscellaneous reader, he yet had the basis of\r\na good education; he had the habit of reading over and over again a\r\nfew of the best books; he had a good memory; he had an intellect\r\nstrong to grasp the great commanding features of any subject; he had a\r\nfondness for the study of human nature, and singular proficiency in\r\nthat branch of science; he had quick and warm sympathies, particularly\r\nwith persons in trouble,--an invincible propensity to take sides with\r\nthe under-dog in any fight. Through a long experience in offhand talk\r\nwith the men whom he had thus far chiefly known in his little\r\nprovincial world,--with an occasional clergyman, pedagogue, or\r\nlegislator, small planters and small traders, sportsmen, loafers,\r\nslaves and the drivers of slaves, and, more than all, those bucolic\r\nSolons of old Virginia, the good-humored, illiterate, thriftless\r\nCaucasian consumers of tobacco and whiskey, who, cordially consenting\r\nthat all the hard work of the world should be done by the children of\r\nHam, were thus left free to commune together in endless debate on the\r\ntavern porch or on the shady side of the country store,--young Patrick\r\nhad learned somewhat of the lawyer's art of putting things; he could\r\nmake men laugh, could make them serious, could set fire to their\r\nenthusiasms. What more he might do with such gifts nobody seems to\r\nhave guessed; very likely few gave it any thought at all. In that\r\nrugged but munificent profession at whose outward gates he then\r\nproceeded to knock, it was altogether improbable that he would burden\r\nhimself with much more of its erudition than was really necessary for\r\na successful general practice in Virginia in his time, or that he\r\nwould permanently content himself with less.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Curtis, _Life of Webster_, i. 585.\r\n\r\n[6] Randall, _Life of Jefferson_, i. 20.\r\n\r\n[7] MS.\r\n\r\n[8] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 396.\r\n\r\n[9] Curtis, _Life of Webster_, i. 585.\r\n\r\n[10] Curtis, _Life of Webster_, i. 585.\r\n\r\n[11] MS.\r\n\r\n[12] MS.\r\n\r\n[13] MS.\r\n\r\n[14] MS.\r\n\r\n[15] Henry Adams, _Life of Gallatin_, 59, 60.\r\n\r\n[16] Wirt, 9.\r\n\r\n[17] Wirt, 13.

Henry himself told a friend that his original study\r\nof the law lasted only one month, and consisted in the reading of Coke\r\nupon Littleton and of the Virginia laws.[18]\r\n\r\nConcerning the encounter of this obscure and raw country youth with\r\nthe accomplished men who examined him as to his fitness to receive a\r\nlicense to practice law, there are three primary narratives,--two by\r\nJefferson, and a third by Judge John Tyler. In his famous talk with\r\nDaniel Webster and the Ticknors at Monticello, in 1824, Jefferson\r\nsaid: \"There were four examiners,--Wythe, Pendleton, Peyton Randolph,\r\nand John Randolph. Wythe and Pendleton at once rejected his\r\napplication; the two Randolphs were, by his importunity, prevailed\r\nupon to sign the license; and, having obtained their signatures, he\r\nagain applied to Pendleton, and after much entreaty, and many promises\r\nof future study, succeeded also in obtaining his. He then turned out\r\nfor a practicing lawyer.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum[20] prepared nearly ten years before the conversation\r\njust mentioned, Jefferson described somewhat differently the incidents\r\nof Henry's examination:--\r\n\r\n     \"Two of the examiners, however, Peyton and John Randolph,\r\n     men of great facility of temper, signed his license with as\r\n     much reluctance as their dispositions would permit them to\r\n     show. Mr. Wythe absolutely refused. Rob. C. Nicholas refused\r\n     also at first; but on repeated importunities, and promises\r\n     of future reading, he signed. These facts I had afterwards\r\n     from the gentlemen themselves; the two Randolphs\r\n     acknowledging he was very ignorant of law, but that they\r\n     perceived him to be a young man of genius, and did not doubt\r\n     he would soon qualify himself.\"[21]\r\n\r\nLong afterward, and when all this anxious affair had become for\r\nPatrick Henry an amusing thing of the past, he himself, in the\r\nconfidence of an affectionate friendship, seems to have related one\r\nremarkable phase of his experience to Judge John Tyler, by whom it was\r\ngiven to Wirt. One of the examiners was \"Mr. John Randolph, who was\r\nafterwards the king's attorney-general for the colony,--a gentleman of\r\nthe most courtly elegance of person and manners, a polished wit, and a\r\nprofound lawyer. At first, he was so much shocked by Mr. Henry's very\r\nungainly figure and address, that he refused to examine him.\r\nUnderstanding, however, that he had already obtained two signatures,\r\nhe entered with manifest reluctance on the business. A very short time\r\nwas sufficient to satisfy him of the erroneous conclusion which he had\r\ndrawn from the exterior of the candidate. With evident marks of\r\nincreasing surprise (produced, no doubt, by the peculiar texture and\r\nstrength of Mr. Henry's style, and the boldness and originality of his\r\ncombinations), he continued the examination for several hours;\r\ninterrogating the candidate, not on the principles of municipal law,\r\nin which he no doubt soon discovered his deficiency, but on the laws\r\nof nature and of nations, on the policy of the feudal system, and on\r\ngeneral history, which last he found to be his stronghold. During the\r\nvery short portion of the examination which was devoted to the common\r\nlaw, Mr. Randolph dissented, or affected to dissent, from one of Mr.\r\nHenry's answers, and called upon him to assign the reasons of his\r\nopinion. This produced an argument, and Mr. Randolph now played off on\r\nhim the same arts which he himself had so often practiced on his\r\ncountry customers; drawing him out by questions, endeavoring to puzzle\r\nhim by subtleties, assailing him with declamation, and watching\r\ncontinually the defensive operations of his mind. After a considerable\r\ndiscussion, he said, 'You defend your opinions well, sir; but now to\r\nthe law and to the testimony.' Hereupon he carried him to his office,\r\nand, opening the authorities, said to him: 'Behold the force of\r\nnatural reason! You have never seen these books, nor this principle of\r\nthe law; yet you are right and I am wrong. And from the lesson which\r\nyou have given me (you must excuse me for saying it) I will never\r\ntrust to appearances again. Mr. Henry, if your industry be only half\r\nequal to your genius, I augur that you will do well, and become an\r\nornament and an honor to your profession.'\"[22]\r\n\r\nAfter such an ordeal at Williamsburg, the young man must have ridden\r\nback to Hanover with some natural elation over his success, but that\r\nelation not a little tempered by serious reflection upon his own\r\ndeficiencies as a lawyer, and by an honest purpose to correct them.\r\nCertainly nearly everything that was dear to him in life must then\r\nhave risen before his eyes, and have incited him to industry in the\r\nfurther study of his profession.\r\n\r\nAt that time, his father-in-law had become the keeper of a tavern in\r\nHanover; and for the next two or three years, while he was rapidly\r\nmaking his way as a general practitioner of the law in that\r\nneighborhood, Patrick seems occasionally to have been a visitor at\r\nthis tavern. It was in this way, undoubtedly, that he sometimes acted\r\nas host, especially in the absence of his father-in-law,--receiving\r\nall comers, and providing for their entertainment; and it was from\r\nthis circumstance that the tradition arose, as Jefferson bluntly\r\nexpressed it, that Patrick Henry \"was originally a barkeeper,\"[23] or,\r\nas it is more vivaciously expressed by a recent writer, that \"for\r\nthree years\" after getting his license to practice law, he \"tended\r\ntravelers and drew corks.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThese statements, however, are but an exaggeration of the fact that,\r\nwhenever visiting at the tavern of his father-in-law, he had the good\r\nsense and the good feeling to lend a hand, in case of need, in the\r\nbusiness of the house; and that no more than this is true may be\r\nproved, not only from the written testimony of survivors,[25] who knew\r\nhim in those days, but from the contemporary records, carefully kept\r\nby himself, of his own earliest business as a lawyer. These records\r\nshow that, almost at once after receiving his license to practice\r\nlaw, he must have been fully occupied with the appropriate business of\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent, also, from the evidence just referred to, that\r\nthe common history of his life has, in another particular, done great\r\ninjustice to this period of it. According to the recollection of one\r\nold man who outlived him, \"he was not distinguished at the bar for\r\nnear four years.\"[26] Wirt himself, relying upon the statements of\r\nseveral survivors of Patrick Henry, speaks of his lingering \"in the\r\nbackground for three years,\" and of \"the profits of his practice\" as\r\nbeing so inadequate for the supply of even \"the necessaries of life,\"\r\nthat \"for the first two or three years\" he was living with his family\r\nin dependence upon his father-in-law.[27] Fortunately, however, we are\r\nnot left in this case to grope our way toward the truth amid the ruins\r\nof the confused and decaying memories of old men. Since Wirt's time,\r\nthere have come to light the fee-books of Patrick Henry, carefully and\r\nneatly kept by him from the beginning of his practice, and covering\r\nnearly his entire professional life down to old age.[28] The first\r\nentry in these books is for September, 1760; and from that date onward\r\nto the end of the year 1763,--by which time he had suddenly sprung\r\ninto great professional prominence by his speech in \"the Parsons'\r\nCause,\"--he is found to have charged fees in 1185 suits, besides many\r\nother fees for the preparation of legal papers out of court. From\r\nabout the time of his speech in \"the Parsons' Cause,\" as his fee-books\r\nshow, his practice became enormous, and so continued to the end of his\r\ndays, excepting when public duties or broken health compelled him to\r\nturn away clients. Thus it is apparent that, while the young lawyer\r\ndid not attain anything more than local professional reputation until\r\nhis speech against the parsons, he did acquire a very considerable\r\npractice almost immediately after his admission to the bar. Moreover,\r\nso far from his being a needy dependent on his father-in-law for the\r\nfirst two or three years, the same quiet records show that his\r\npractice enabled him, even during that early period, to assist his\r\nfather-in-law by an important advance of money.\r\n\r\nThe fiction that Patrick Henry, during the first three or four years\r\nof his nominal career as a lawyer, was a briefless barrister,--earning\r\nhis living at the bar of a tavern rather than at the bar of\r\njustice,--is the very least of those disparaging myths, which, through\r\nthe frailty of human memory and the bitterness of partisan ill-will,\r\nhave been permitted to settle upon his reputation. Certainly, no one\r\nwould think it discreditable, or even surprising, if Patrick Henry,\r\nwhile still a very young lawyer, should have had little or no\r\npractice, provided only that, when the practice did come, the young\r\nlawyer had shown himself to have been a good one. It is precisely\r\nthis honor which, during the past seventy years, has been denied him.\r\nUpon the evidence thus far most prominently before the public, one is\r\ncompelled to conceive of him as having been destitute of nearly all\r\nthe qualifications of a good lawyer, excepting those which give\r\nsuccess with juries, particularly in criminal practice: he is\r\nrepresented as ignorant of the law, indolent, and grossly negligent of\r\nbusiness,--with nothing, in fact, to give him the least success in the\r\nprofession but an abnormal and quite unaccountable gift of persuasion\r\nthrough speech.\r\n\r\nReferring to this period of his life, Wirt says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Of the science of law he knew almost nothing; of the\r\n     practical part he was so wholly ignorant that he was not\r\n     only unable to draw a declaration or a plea, but incapable,\r\n     it is said, of the most common or simple business of his\r\n     profession, even of the mode of ordering a suit, giving a\r\n     notice, or making a motion in court.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThis conception of Henry's professional character, to which Wirt seems\r\nto have come reluctantly, was founded, as is now evident, on the\r\nlong-suppressed memorandum of Jefferson, who therein states that,\r\nafter failing in merchandise, Patrick \"turned his views to the law,\r\nfor the acquisition or practice of which however, he was too lazy.\r\nWhenever the courts were closed for the winter session, he would make\r\nup a party of poor hunters of his neighborhood, would go off with\r\nthem to the piny woods of Fluvanna, and pass weeks in hunting deer, of\r\nwhich he was passionately fond, sleeping under a tent before a fire,\r\nwearing the same shirt the whole time, and covering all the dirt of\r\nhis dress with a hunting-shirt. He never undertook to draw pleadings,\r\nif he could avoid it, or to manage that part of a cause, and very\r\nunwillingly engaged but as an assistant to speak in the cause. And the\r\nfee was an indispensable preliminary, observing to the applicant that\r\nhe kept no accounts, never putting pen to paper, which was true.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of this passage, in which Jefferson declares that it\r\nwas true that Henry \"kept no accounts, never putting pen to paper,\"\r\nis, of course, now utterly set aside by the discovery of the precious\r\nfee-books; and these orderly and circumstantial records almost as\r\ncompletely annihilate the trustworthiness of all the rest of the\r\npassage. Let us consider, for example, Jefferson's statement that for\r\nthe acquisition of the law, or for the practice of it, Henry was too\r\nlazy, and that much of the time between the sessions of the courts was\r\npassed by him in deer-hunting in the woods. Confining ourselves to the\r\nfirst three and a half years of his actual practice, in which, by the\r\nrecord, his practice was the smallest that he ever had, it is not easy\r\nfor one to understand how a mere novice in the profession, and one so\r\nperfectly ignorant of its most rudimental forms, could have earned,\r\nduring that brief period, the fees which he charged in 1185 suits, and\r\nin the preparation of many legal papers out of court, and still have\r\nbeen seriously addicted to laziness. Indeed, if so much legal business\r\ncould have been transacted within three years and a half, by a lawyer\r\nwho, besides being young and incompetent, was also extremely lazy, and\r\ngreatly preferred to go off to the woods and hunt for deer while his\r\nclients were left to hunt in vain for him, it becomes an interesting\r\nquestion just how much legal business we ought to expect to be done by\r\na young lawyer who was not incompetent, was not lazy, and had no\r\ninordinate fondness for deer-hunting. It happens that young Thomas\r\nJefferson himself was just such a lawyer. He began practice exactly\r\nseven years after Patrick Henry, and at precisely the same time of\r\nlife, though under external circumstances far more favorable. As a\r\nproof of his uncommon zeal and success in the profession, his\r\nbiographer, Randall, cites from Jefferson's fee-books the number of\r\ncases in which he was employed until he was finally drawn off from the\r\nlaw into political life. Oddly enough, for the first four years of his\r\npractice, the cases registered by Jefferson[31] number, in all, but\r\n504. It should be mentioned that this number, as it includes only\r\nJefferson's cases in the General Court, does not indicate all the\r\nbusiness done by him during those first four years; and yet, even with\r\nthis allowance, we are left standing rather helpless before the\r\nproblem presented by the fact that this competent and diligent young\r\nlawyer--whom, forsooth, the rustling leaves of the forest could never\r\nfor once entice from the rustle of the leaves of his law-books--did\r\nnevertheless transact, during his own first four years of practice,\r\nprobably less than one half as much business as seems to have been\r\ndone during a somewhat shorter space of time by our poor, ignorant,\r\nindolent, slovenly, client-shunning and forest-haunting Patrick.\r\n\r\nBut, if Jefferson's charge of professional indolence and neglect on\r\nthe part of his early friend fares rather ill when tested by those\r\nminute and plodding records of his professional employments which were\r\nkept by Patrick Henry, a fate not much more prosperous overtakes\r\nJefferson's other charge,--that of professional incompetence. It is\r\nmore than intimated by Jefferson that, even had Patrick been disposed\r\nto engage in a general law practice, he did not know enough to do so\r\nsuccessfully by reason of his ignorance of the most ordinary legal\r\nprinciples and legal forms. But the intellectual embarrassment which\r\none experiences in trying to accept this view of Patrick Henry arises\r\nfrom the simple fact that these incorrigible fee-books show that it\r\nwas precisely this general law practice that he did engage in, both in\r\ncourt and out of court; a practice only a small portion of which was\r\ncriminal, the larger part of it consisting of the ordinary suits in\r\ncountry litigation; a practice which certainly involved the drawing\r\nof pleadings, and the preparation of many sorts of legal papers; a\r\npractice, moreover, which he seems to have acquired with extraordinary\r\nrapidity, and to have maintained with increasing success as long as he\r\ncared for it. These are items of history which are likely to burden\r\nthe ordinary reader with no little perplexity,--a perplexity the\r\nelements of which are thus modestly stated by a living grandson of\r\nPatrick Henry: \"How he acquired or retained a practice so large and\r\ncontinually increasing, so perfectly unfit for it as Mr. Jefferson\r\nrepresents him, I am at a loss to understand.\"[32]\r\n\r\nAs we go further in the study of this man's life, we shall have before\r\nus ample materials for dealing still further and still more definitely\r\nwith the subject of his professional character, as that character\r\nitself became developed and matured. Meantime, however, the evidence\r\nalready in view seems quite enough to enable us to form a tolerably\r\nclear notion of the sort of lawyer he was down to the end of 1763,\r\nwhich may be regarded as the period of his novitiate at the bar. It is\r\nperfectly evident that, at the time of his admission to the bar, he\r\nknew very little of the law, either in its principles or in its forms:\r\nhe knew no more than could have been learned by a young man of genius\r\nin the course of four weeks in the study of Coke upon Littleton, and\r\nof the laws of Virginia. If, now, we are at liberty to suppose that\r\nhis study of the law then ceased, we may accept the view of his\r\nprofessional incompetence held up by Jefferson; but precisely that is\r\nwhat we are not at liberty to suppose. All the evidence, fairly\r\nsifted, warrants the belief that, on his return to Hanover with his\r\nlicense to practice law, he used the next few months in the further\r\nstudy of it; and that thenceforward, just so fast as professional\r\nbusiness came to his hands, he tried to qualify himself to do that\r\nbusiness, and to do it so well that his clients should be inclined to\r\ncome to him again in case of need. Patrick Henry's is not the first\r\ncase, neither is it the last one, of a man coming to the bar miserably\r\nunqualified for its duties, but afterward becoming well qualified. We\r\nneed not imagine, we do not imagine, that he ever became a man of\r\ngreat learning in the law; but we do find it impossible to believe\r\nthat he continued to be a man of great ignorance in it. The law,\r\nindeed, is the one profession on earth in which such success as he is\r\nproved to have had, is impossible to such incompetence as he is said\r\nto have had. Moreover, in trying to form a just idea of Patrick Henry,\r\nit is never safe to forget that we have to do with a man of genius,\r\nand that the ways by which a man of genius reaches his results are\r\nnecessarily his own,--are often invisible, are always somewhat\r\nmysterious, to the rest of us. The genius of Patrick Henry was\r\npowerful, intuitive, swift; by a glance of the eye he could take in\r\nwhat an ordinary man might spend hours in toiling for; his memory\r\nheld whatever was once committed to it; all his resources were at\r\ninstant command; his faculty for debate, his imagination, humor, tact,\r\ndiction, elocution, were rich and exquisite; he was also a man of\r\nhuman and friendly ways, whom all men loved, and whom all men wanted\r\nto help; and it would not have been strange if he actually fitted\r\nhimself for the successful practice of such law business as was then\r\nto be had in Virginia, and actually entered upon its successful\r\npractice with a quickness the exact processes of which were\r\nunperceived even by his nearest neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Wirt, 16.\r\n\r\n[19] Curtis, _Life of Webster_, i. 584.\r\n\r\n[20] First printed in the Philadelphia _Age_, in 1867; and again\r\nprinted, from the original manuscript, in _The Historical Magazine_,\r\nAugust, 1867, 90-93.

It only needed an advocate skilful enough to play\r\neffectively upon these passions, and a storm would be raised before\r\nwhich mere considerations of law and of equity would be swept out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the real issue presented by \"the Parsons'\r\nCause,\" and consequently the essential weakness of the side to the\r\nservice of which our young lawyer was now summoned, we shall need to\r\nturn about and take a brief tour into the earlier history of Virginia.\r\nIn that colony, from the beginning, the Church of England was\r\nestablished by law, and was supported, like any other institution of\r\nthe government, by revenues derived from taxation,--taxation levied in\r\nthis case upon nearly all persons in the colony above the age of\r\nsixteen years. Moreover, those local subdivisions which, in the\r\nNorthern colonies, were called towns, in Virginia were called\r\nparishes; and accordingly, in the latter, the usual local officers who\r\nmanage the public business for each civil neighborhood were called,\r\nnot selectmen or supervisors, as at the North, but vestrymen. Among\r\nthe functions conferred by the law upon these local officers in\r\nVirginia was that of hiring the rector or minister, and of paying him\r\nhis salary; and the same authority which gave to the vestry this power\r\nfixed likewise the precise amount of salary which they were to pay.\r\nEver since the early days of the colony, this amount had been stated,\r\nnot in money, which hardly existed there, but in tobacco, which was\r\nthe staple of the colony. Sometimes the market value of tobacco would\r\nbe very low,--so low that the portion paid to the minister would yield\r\na sum quite insufficient for his support; and on such occasions, prior\r\nto 1692, the parishes had often kindly made up for such depreciation\r\nby voluntarily paying an extra quantity of tobacco.[33] After 1692,\r\nhowever, for reasons which need not now be detailed, this generous\r\ncustom seems to have disappeared. For example, from 1709 to 1714, the\r\nprice of tobacco was so low as to make its shipment to England, in\r\nmany instances, a positive loss to its owner; while the sale of it on\r\nthe spot was so disadvantageous as to reduce the minister's salary to\r\nabout £25 a year, as reckoned in the depreciated paper currency of the\r\ncolony. Of course, during those years, the distress of the clergy was\r\nvery great; but, whatever it may have been, they were permitted to\r\nbear it, without any suggestion, either from the legislature or from\r\nthe vestries, looking toward the least addition to the quantity of\r\ntobacco then to be paid them. On the other hand, from 1714 to 1720,\r\nthe price of tobacco rose considerably above the average, and did\r\nsomething towards making up to the clergy the losses which they had\r\nrecently incurred. Then, again, from 1720 to 1724, tobacco fell to the\r\nlow price of the former period, and of course with the same results of\r\nunrelieved loss to the clergy.[34] Thus, however, in the process of\r\ntime, there had become established, in the fiscal relations of each\r\nvestry to its minister, a rough but obvious system of fair play. When\r\nthe price of tobacco was down, the parson was expected to suffer the\r\nloss; when the price of tobacco was up, he was allowed to enjoy the\r\ngain. Probably it did not then occur to any one that a majority of\r\nthe good people of Virginia could ever be brought to demand such a\r\nmutilation of justice as would be involved in depriving the parson of\r\nthe occasional advantage of a very good market, and of making up for\r\nthis by always leaving to him the undisturbed enjoyment of every\r\noccasional bad one. Yet it was just this mutilation of justice which,\r\nonly a few years later, a majority of the good people of Virginia were\r\nactually brought to demand, and which, by the youthful genius of\r\nPatrick Henry, they were too well aided in effecting.\r\n\r\nReturning now from our brief tour into a period of Virginian history\r\njust prior to that upon which we are at present engaged, we find\r\nourselves arrived at the year 1748, in which year the legislature of\r\nVirginia, revising all previous regulations respecting the hiring\r\nand paying of the clergy, passed an act, directing that every parish\r\nminister should \"receive an annual salary of 16,000 pounds of\r\ntobacco, ... to be levied, assessed, collected, and paid\" by the\r\nvestry. \"And if the vestry of any parish\" should \"neglect or refuse\r\nto levy the tobacco due to the minister,\" they should \"be liable to\r\nthe action of the party grieved ... for all damages which he ...\r\nshall sustain by such refusal or neglect.\"[35] This act of the\r\ncolonial legislature, having been duly approved by the king, became\r\na law, and consequently was not liable to repeal or even to\r\nsuspension except by the king's approval. Thus, at the period now\r\nreached, there was between every vestry and its minister a valid\r\ncontract for the annual payment, by the former to the latter, of\r\nthat particular quantity of tobacco,--the clergy to take their\r\nchances as to the market value of the product from year to year.\r\n\r\nThus matters ran on until 1755, when, by reason of a diminished crop\r\nof tobacco, the legislature passed an option law,[36] virtually\r\nsuspending for the next ten months the Act of 1748, and requiring the\r\nclergy, at the option of the vestries, to receive their salaries for\r\nthat year, not in tobacco, but in the depreciated paper currency of\r\nthe colony, at the rate of two pence for each pound of tobacco due,--a\r\nprice somewhat below the market value of the article for that year.\r\nMost clearly this act, which struck an arbitrary blow at the validity\r\nof all contracts in Virginia, was one which exceeded the\r\nconstitutional authority of the legislature; since it suspended,\r\nwithout the royal approval, a law which had been regularly ratified by\r\nthe king. However, the operation of this act was shrewdly limited to\r\nten months,--a period just long enough to accomplish its object, but\r\ntoo short for the royal intervention against it to be of any direct\r\navail. Under these circumstances, the clergy bore their losses for\r\nthat year with some murmuring indeed, but without any formal\r\nprotest.[37]\r\n\r\nJust three years afterward, in 1758, the legislature, with even less\r\nexcuse than before, passed an act[38] similar to that of 1755,--its\r\nforce, however, being limited to twelve months. The operation of this\r\nact, as affecting each parish minister, may be conveyed in very few\r\nwords. In lieu of what was due him under the law for his year's\r\nservices, namely, 16,000 pounds of tobacco, the market value of which\r\nfor the year in question proved to be about £400 sterling, it\r\ncompelled him to take, in the paper money of the colony, the sum of\r\nabout £133. To make matters still worse, while the tobacco which was\r\ndue him was an instant and an advantageous medium of exchange\r\neverywhere, and especially in England whence nearly all his merchant\r\nsupplies were obtained, this paper money that was forced upon him was\r\na depreciated currency even within the colony, and absolutely\r\nworthless outside of it; so that the poor parson, who could never\r\ndemand his salary for any year until six full months after its close,\r\nwould have proffered to him, at the end, perhaps, of another six\r\nmonths, just one third of the nominal sum due him, and that in a\r\nspecies of money of no value at all except in Virginia, and even in\r\nVirginia of a purchasing value not exceeding that of £20 sterling in\r\nEngland.[39]\r\n\r\nNor, in justification of such a measure, could it be truthfully said\r\nthat there was at that time in the colony any general \"dearth and\r\nscarcity,\"[40] or any such public distress of any sort as might\r\noverrule the ordinary maxims of justice, and excuse, in the name of\r\nhumanity, a merely technical violation of law. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe only \"dearth and scarcity\" in Virginia that year was \"confined to\r\none or two counties on James River, and that entirely owing to their\r\nown fault;\"[41] wherever there was any failure of the tobacco crop, it\r\nwas due to the killing of the plants so early in the spring, that such\r\nland did not need to lie uncultivated, and in most cases was planted\r\n\"in corn and pease, which always turned to good account;\"[42] and\r\nalthough, for the whole colony, the crop of tobacco \"was short in\r\nquantity,\" yet \"in cash value it proved to be the best crop that\r\nVirginia had ever had\" since the settlement of the colony.[43]\r\nFinally, it was by no means the welfare of the poor that \"was the\r\nobject, or the effect, of the law;\" but it was \"the rich planters\"\r\nwho, first selling their tobacco at about fifty shillings the hundred,\r\nand then paying to the clergy and others their tobacco debts at the\r\nrate of sixteen shillings the hundred, were \"the chief gainers\" by the\r\nact.[44]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, in all its fresh and unadorned rascality, was the famous\r\n\"option law,\" or \"two-penny act,\" of 1758: an act firmly opposed, on\r\nits first appearance in the legislature, by a noble minority of\r\nhonorable men; an act clearly indicating among a portion of the people\r\nof Virginia a survival of the old robber instincts of our Norse\r\nancestors; an act having there the sort of frantic popularity that all\r\nlaws are likely to have which give a dishonest advantage to the debtor\r\nclass,--and in Virginia, unfortunately, on the subject of salaries due\r\nto the clergy, nearly all persons above sixteen years of age belonged\r\nto that class.[45]\r\n\r\nAt the time when this act was before the legislature for\r\nconsideration, the clergy applied for a hearing, but were refused.\r\nUpon its passage by the two houses, the clergy applied to the acting\r\ngovernor, hoping to obtain his disapproval of the act; but his reply\r\nwas an unblushing avowal of his determination to pursue any course,\r\nright or wrong, which would bring him popular favor. They then sent\r\none of their own number to England, for the purpose of soliciting the\r\nroyal disallowance of the act. After a full hearing of both sides, the\r\nprivy council gave it as their opinion that the clergy of Virginia had\r\ntheir \"certain remedy at law;\" Lord Hardwicke, in particular,\r\ndeclaring that \"there was no occasion to dispute about the authority\r\nby which the act was passed; for that no court in the judicature\r\nwhatever could look upon it to be law, by reason of its manifest\r\ninjustice alone.\"[46] Accordingly, the royal disallowance was granted.\r\nUpon the arrival in Virginia of these tidings, several of the clergy\r\nbegan suits against their respective vestries, for the purpose of\r\ncompelling them to pay the amounts then legally due upon their\r\nsalaries for the year 1758.\r\n\r\nOf these suits, the first to come to trial was that of the Rev. Thomas\r\nWarrington, in the County Court of Elizabeth City. In that case, \"a\r\njury of his own parishioners found for him considerable damages,\r\nallowing on their oaths that there was above twice as much justly due\r\nto him as the act had granted;\"[47] but \"the court hindered him from\r\nimmediately coming at the damages, by judging the act to be law, in\r\nwhich it is thought they were influenced more by the fear of giving\r\noffense to their superiors, than by their own opinion of the\r\nreasonableness of the act,--they privately professing that they\r\nthought the parson ought to have his right.\"[48]\r\n\r\nSoon afterward came to trial, in the court of King William County, the\r\nsuit of the Rev. Alexander White, rector of St. David's parish. In\r\nthis case, the court, instead of either sustaining or rejecting the\r\ndisallowed act, simply shirked their responsibility, \"refused to\r\nmeddle in the matter, and insisted on leaving the whole affair to the\r\njury;\" who being thus freed from all judicial control, straightway\r\nrendered a verdict of neat and comprehensive lawlessness: \"We bring in\r\nfor the defendant.\"[49]\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage of affairs that the court of Hanover County\r\nreached the case of the Rev. James Maury, rector of Fredericksville\r\nparish, Louisa; and the court, having before it the evidence of the\r\nroyal disallowance of the Act of 1758, squarely \"adjudged the act to\r\nbe no law.\" Of course, under this decision, but one result seemed\r\npossible. As the court had thus rejected the validity of the act\r\nwhereby the vestry had withheld from their parson two thirds of his\r\nsalary for the year 1758, it only remained to summon a special jury on\r\na writ of inquiry to determine the damages thus sustained by the\r\nparson; and as this was a very simple question of arithmetic, the\r\ncounsel for the defendants expressed his desire to withdraw from the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation, when these defendants, having been assured by\r\ntheir counsel that all further struggle would be hopeless, turned for\r\nhelp to the enterprising young lawyer who, in that very place, had\r\nbeen for the previous three and a half years pushing his way to notice\r\nin his profession. To him, accordingly, they brought their cause,--a\r\ndesperate cause, truly,--a cause already lost and abandoned by veteran\r\nand eminent counsel. Undoubtedly, by the ethics of his profession,\r\nPatrick Henry was bound to accept the retainer that was thus tendered\r\nhim; and, undoubtedly, by the organization of his own mind, having\r\nonce accepted that retainer, he was likely to devote to the cause no\r\ntepid or half-hearted service.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the court, which has been referred to, was rendered at\r\nits November session. On the first day of the session in December, the\r\norder was executed for summoning a select jury \"to examine whether the\r\nplaintiff had sustained any damages, and what.\"[50] Obviously, in the\r\ndetermination of these two questions, much would depend on the\r\npersonal composition of the jury; and it is apparent that this matter\r\nwas diligently attended to by the sheriff. His plan seems to have been\r\nto secure a good, honest jury of twelve adult male persons, but\r\nwithout having among them a single one of those over-scrupulous and\r\nintractable people who, in Virginia, at that time, were still\r\ntechnically described as gentlemen. With what delicacy and efficiency\r\nhe managed this part of the business was thus described shortly\r\nafterward by the plaintiff, of course a deeply interested\r\neye-witness:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sheriff went into a public room full of gentlemen, and\r\n     told his errand. One excused himself ... as having already\r\n     given his opinion in a similar case. On this, ... he\r\n     immediately left the room, without summoning any one person\r\n     there. He afterwards met another gentleman ... on the green,\r\n     and, on saying he was not fit to serve, being a church\r\n     warden, he took upon himself to excuse him, too, and, as far\r\n     as I can learn made no further attempts to summon\r\n     gentlemen.... Hence he went among the vulgar herd. After he\r\n     had selected and set down upon his list about eight or ten\r\n     of these, I met him with it in his hand, and on looking over\r\n     it, observed to him that they were not such jurors as the\r\n     court had directed him to get,--being people of whom I had\r\n     never heard before, except one whom, I told him, he knew to\r\n     be a party in the cause.... Yet this man's name was not\r\n     erased. He was even called in court, and had he not excused\r\n     himself, would probably have been admitted. For I cannot\r\n     recollect that the court expressed either surprise or\r\n     dislike that a more proper jury had not been summoned. Nay,\r\n     though I objected against them, yet, as Patrick Henry, one\r\n     of the defendants' lawyers, insisted they were honest men,\r\n     and, therefore, unexceptionable, they were immediately\r\n     called to the book and sworn.\"[51]\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured a jury that must have been reasonably\r\nsatisfactory to the defendants, the hearing began. Two gentlemen,\r\nbeing the largest purchasers of tobacco in the county, were then sworn\r\nas witnesses to prove the market price of the article in 1759. By\r\ntheir testimony it was established that the price was then more than\r\nthree times as much as had been estimated in the payment of paper\r\nmoney actually made to the plaintiff in that year. Upon this state of\r\nfacts, \"the lawyers on both sides\" proceeded to display \"the force and\r\nweight of the evidence;\" after which the case was given to the jury.\r\n\"In less than five minutes,\" they \"brought in a verdict for the\r\nplaintiff,--one penny damages.\"[52]\r\n\r\nJust how the jury were induced, in the face of the previous judgment\r\nof that very court, to render this astounding verdict, has been\r\ndescribed in two narratives: one by William Wirt, written about fifty\r\nyears after the event; the other by the injured plaintiff himself, the\r\nRev. James Maury, written exactly twelve days after the event. Few\r\nthings touching the life of Patrick Henry can be more notable or more\r\ninstructive than the contrast presented by these two narratives.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the scene of action, on the 1st of December, Patrick Henry\r\n\"found,\" says Wirt,--\r\n\r\n     \"on the courtyard such a concourse as would have appalled\r\n     any other man in his situation. They were not people of the\r\n     county merely who were there, but visitors from all the\r\n     counties to a considerable distance around. The decision\r\n     upon the demurrer had produced a violent ferment among the\r\n     people, and equal exultation on the part of the clergy, who\r\n     attended the court in a large body, either to look down\r\n     opposition, or to enjoy the final triumph of this hard\r\n     fought contest, which they now considered as perfectly\r\n     secure.... Soon after the opening of the court the cause was\r\n     called.... The array before Mr. Henry's eyes was now most\r\n     fearful. On the bench sat more than twenty clergymen, the\r\n     most learned men in the colony.... The courthouse was\r\n     crowded with an overwhelming multitude, and surrounded with\r\n     an immense and anxious throng, who, not finding room to\r\n     enter, were endeavoring to listen without in the deepest\r\n     attention. But there was something still more awfully\r\n     disconcerting than all this; for in the chair of the\r\n     presiding magistrate sat no other person than his own\r\n     father. Mr. Lyons opened the cause very briefly.... And now\r\n     came on the first trial of Patrick Henry's strength. No one\r\n     had ever heard him speak,[53] and curiosity was on tiptoe.\r\n     He rose very awkwardly, and faltered much in his exordium.\r\n     The people hung their heads at so unpromising a\r\n     commencement; the clergy were observed to exchange sly looks\r\n     with each other; and his father is described as having\r\n     almost sunk with confusion, from his seat. But these\r\n     feelings were of short duration, and soon gave place to\r\n     others of a very different character. For now were those\r\n     wonderful faculties which he possessed, for the first time\r\n     developed; and now was first witnessed that mysterious and\r\n     almost supernatural transformation of appearance, which the\r\n     fire of his own eloquence never failed to work in him. For\r\n     as his mind rolled along, and began to glow from its own\r\n     action, all the exuviæ of the clown seemed to shed\r\n     themselves spontaneously. His attitude, by degrees, became\r\n     erect and lofty. The spirit of his genius awakened all his\r\n     features. His countenance shone with a nobleness and\r\n     grandeur which it had never before exhibited. There was a\r\n     lightning in his eyes which seemed to rive the spectator.\r\n     His action became graceful, bold, and commanding; and in the\r\n     tones of his voice, but more especially in his emphasis,\r\n     there was a peculiar charm, a magic, of which any one who\r\n     ever heard him will speak as soon as he is named, but of\r\n     which no one can give any adequate description. They can\r\n     only say that it struck upon the ear and upon the heart, in\r\n     a manner which language cannot tell. Add to all these, his\r\n     wonder-working fancy, and the peculiar phraseology in which\r\n     he clothed its images: for he painted to the heart with a\r\n     force that almost petrified it. In the language of those who\r\n     heard him on this occasion, 'he made their blood run cold,\r\n     and their hair to rise on end.'\r\n\r\n     \"It will not be difficult for any one who ever heard this\r\n     most extraordinary man, to believe the whole account of this\r\n     transaction which is given by his surviving hearers; and\r\n     from their account, the court house of Hanover County must\r\n     have exhibited, on this occasion, a scene as picturesque as\r\n     has been ever witnessed in real life. They say that the\r\n     people, whose countenance had fallen as he arose, had heard\r\n     but a very few sentences before they began to look up; then\r\n     to look at each other with surprise, as if doubting the\r\n     evidence of their own senses; then, attracted by some strong\r\n     gesture, struck by some majestic attitude, fascinated by the\r\n     spell of his eye, the charm of his emphasis, and the varied\r\n     and commanding expression of his countenance, they could\r\n     look away no more. In less than twenty minutes, they might\r\n     be seen in every part of the house, on every bench, in every\r\n     window, stooping forward from their stands, in death-like\r\n     silence; their features fixed in amazement and awe; all\r\n     their senses listening and riveted upon the speaker, as if\r\n     to catch the least strain of some heavenly visitant. The\r\n     mockery of the clergy was soon turned into alarm; their\r\n     triumph into confusion and despair; and at one burst of his\r\n     rapid and overwhelming invective, they fled from the house\r\n     in precipitation and terror. As for the father, such was his\r\n     surprise, such his amazement, such his rapture, that,\r\n     forgetting where he was, and the character which he was\r\n     filling, tears of ecstasy streamed down his cheeks, without\r\n     the power or inclination to repress them.\r\n\r\n     \"The jury seem to have been so completely bewildered, that\r\n     they lost sight not only of the Act of 1748, but that of\r\n     1758 also; for, thoughtless even of the admitted right of\r\n     the plaintiff, they had scarcely left the bar, when they\r\n     returned with a verdict of one penny damages. A motion was\r\n     made for a new trial; but the court, too, had now lost the\r\n     equipoise of their judgment, and overruled the motion by an\r\n     unanimous vote. The verdict and judgment overruling the\r\n     motion were followed by redoubled acclamations, from within\r\n     and without the house. The people, who had with difficulty\r\n     kept their hands off their champion from the moment of\r\n     closing his harangue, no sooner saw the fate of the cause\r\n     finally sealed, than they seized him at the bar; and in\r\n     spite of his own exertions, and the continued cry of order\r\n     from the sheriffs and the court, they bore him out of the\r\n     courthouse, and raising him on their shoulders, carried him\r\n     about the yard, in a kind of electioneering triumph.\"[54]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Wirt wrote this rhapsody, he was unable, as he tells\r\nus, to procure from any quarter a rational account of the line of\r\nargument taken by Patrick Henry, or even of any other than a single\r\ntopic alluded to by him in the course of his speech,--they who heard\r\nthe speech saying \"that when it was over, they felt as if they had\r\njust awaked from some ecstatic dream, of which they were unable to\r\nrecall or connect the particulars.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThere was present in that assemblage, however, at least one person who\r\nlistened to the young orator without falling into an ecstatic dream,\r\nand whose senses were so well preserved to him through it all that he\r\nwas able, a few days afterward, while the whole occasion was fresh in\r\nhis memory, to place upon record a clear and connected version of the\r\nwonder-working speech. This version is to be found in a letter written\r\nby the plaintiff on the 12th of December, 1763, and has been brought\r\nto light only within recent years.\r\n\r\nAfter giving, for the benefit of the learned counsel by whom the cause\r\nwas to be managed, on appeal, in the general court, a lucid and rather\r\ncritical account of the whole proceeding, Maury adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"One occurrence more, though not essential to the cause, I\r\n     can't help mentioning.... Mr. Henry, mentioned above (who\r\n     had been called in by the defendants, as we suspected, to do\r\n     what I some time ago told you of), after Mr. Lyons had\r\n     opened the cause, rose and harangued the jury for near an\r\n     hour. This harangue turned upon points as much out of his\r\n     own depth, and that of the jury, as they were foreign from\r\n     the purpose,--which it would be impertinent to mention here.\r\n     However, after he had discussed those points, he labored to\r\n     prove 'that the Act of 1758 had every characteristic of a\r\n     good law; that it was a law of general utility, and could\r\n     not, consistently with what he called the original compact\r\n     between the king and people ... be annulled.' Hence he\r\n     inferred, 'that a king, by disallowing acts of this salutary\r\n     nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated\r\n     into a tyrant, and forfeits all right to his subjects'\r\n     obedience.' He further urged 'that the only use of an\r\n     established church and clergy in society, is to enforce\r\n     obedience to civil sanctions, and the observance of those\r\n     which are called duties of imperfect obligation; that when a\r\n     clergy ceases to answer these ends, the community have no\r\n     further need of their ministry, and may justly strip them of\r\n     their appointments; that the clergy of Virginia, in this\r\n     particular instance of their refusing to acquiesce in the\r\n     law in question, had been so far from answering, that they\r\n     had most notoriously counteracted, those great ends of their\r\n     institution; that, therefore, instead of useful members of\r\n     the state, they ought to be considered as enemies of the\r\n     community; and that, in the case now before them, Mr. Maury,\r\n     instead of countenance, and protection, and damages, very\r\n     justly deserved to be punished with signal severity.' And\r\n     then he perorates to the following purpose, 'that excepting\r\n     they (the jury) were disposed to rivet the chains of bondage\r\n     on their own necks, he hoped they would not let slip the\r\n     opportunity which now offered, of making such an example of\r\n     him as might, hereafter, be a warning to himself and his\r\n     brethren, not to have the temerity, for the future, to\r\n     dispute the validity of such laws, authenticated by the only\r\n     authority which, in his conception, could give force to laws\r\n     for the government of this colony,--the authority of a legal\r\n     representative of a council, and of a kind and benevolent\r\n     and patriot governor.' You'll observe I do not pretend to\r\n     remember his words, but take this to have been the sum and\r\n     substance of this part of his labored oration. When he came\r\n     to that part of it where he undertook to assert 'that a\r\n     king, by annulling or disallowing acts of so salutary a\r\n     nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated\r\n     into a tyrant, and forfeits all right to his subjects'\r\n     obedience,' the more sober part of the audience were struck\r\n     with horror. Mr. Lyons called out aloud, and with an honest\r\n     warmth, to the Bench, 'that the gentleman had spoken\r\n     treason,' and expressed his astonishment, 'that their\r\n     worships could hear it without emotion, or any mark of\r\n     dissatisfaction.' At the same instant, too, amongst some\r\n     gentlemen in the crowd behind me, was a confused murmur of\r\n     'treason, treason!' Yet Mr. Henry went on in the same\r\n     treasonable and licentious strain, without interruption from\r\n     the Bench, nay, even without receiving the least exterior\r\n     notice of their disapprobation. One of the jury, too, was so\r\n     highly pleased with these doctrines, that, as I was\r\n     afterwards told, he every now and then gave the traitorous\r\n     declaimer a nod of approbation. After the court was\r\n     adjourned, he apologized to me for what he had said,\r\n     alleging that his sole view in engaging in the cause, and in\r\n     saying what he had, was to render himself popular. You see,\r\n     then, it is so clear a point in this person's opinion that\r\n     the ready road to popularity here is to trample under foot\r\n     the interests of religion, the rights of the church, and the\r\n     prerogatives of the crown.\"[56]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] Perry, _Hist.

For\r\ninstance, among the motives to be mentioned for the popularity of laws\r\nwhose chief effects were to diminish the pay of the established\r\nclergy, should be considered those connected with a growing dissent\r\nfrom the established church in Virginia, and particularly with the\r\nvery human dislike which even churchmen might have to paying in the\r\nform of a compulsory tax what they would have cheerfully paid in the\r\nform of a voluntary contribution.

Yet it could only be in a\r\nmoment of anger that any one who knew him could ever have said of\r\nPatrick Henry that he was disposed \"to trample under foot the\r\ninterests of religion,\" or that he had any ill-will toward the church\r\nor its ministers. It is very likely that, in the many irritations\r\ngrowing out of a civil establishment of the church in his native\r\ncolony, he may have shared in feelings that were not uncommon even\r\namong devout churchmen there; but in spite of this, then and always,\r\nto the very end of his life, his most sacred convictions and his\r\ntenderest affections seem to have been on the side of the institutions\r\nand ministers of Christianity, and even of Christianity in its\r\nhistoric form. Accordingly, both before and after his great speech, he\r\ntried to indicate to the good men whose legal claims it had become\r\nhis professional duty to resist, that such resistance must not be\r\ntaken by them as implying on his part any personal unkindness. To his\r\nuncle and namesake, the Reverend Patrick Henry, who was even then a\r\nplaintiff in a similar suit, and whom he had affectionately persuaded\r\nnot to remain at the courthouse to hear the coming speech against the\r\npecuniary demands of himself and his order, he said \"that the clergy\r\nhad not thought him worthy of being retained on their side,\" and that\r\n\"he knew of no moral principle by which he was bound to refuse a fee\r\nfrom their adversaries.\"[57] So, too, the conciliatory words, which,\r\nafter the trial, he tried to speak to the indignant plaintiff, and\r\nwhich the latter has reported in the blunt form corresponding to his\r\nown angry interpretation of them, after all may have borne the better\r\nmeaning given to them by Bishop Meade, who says that Patrick Henry, in\r\nhis apology to Maury, \"pleaded as an excuse for his course, that he\r\nwas a young lawyer, a candidate for practice and reputation, and\r\ntherefore must make the best of his cause.\"[58]\r\n\r\nThese genial efforts at pacification are of rather more than casual\r\nsignificance: they are indications of character. They mark a distinct\r\nquality of the man's nature, of which he continued to give evidence\r\nduring the rest of his life,--a certain sweetness of spirit, which\r\nnever deserted him through all the stern conflicts of his career. He\r\nwas always a good fighter: never a good hater. He had the brain and\r\nthe temperament of an advocate; his imagination and his heart always\r\nkindled hotly to the side that he had espoused, and with his\r\nimagination and his heart always went all the rest of the man; in his\r\nadvocacy of any cause that he had thus made his own, he hesitated at\r\nno weapon either of offence or of defence; he struck hard blows--he\r\nspoke hard words--and he usually triumphed; and yet, even in the\r\nparoxysms of the combat, and still more so when the combat was over,\r\nhe showed how possible it is to be a redoubtable antagonist without\r\nhaving a particle of malice.\r\n\r\nThen, too, from this first great scene in his public life, there comes\r\ndown to us another incident that has its own story to tell. In all the\r\nroar of talk within and about the courthouse, after the trial was\r\nover, one \"Mr. Cootes, merchant of James River,\" was heard to say that\r\n\"he would have given a considerable sum out of his own pocket rather\r\nthan his friend Patrick should have been guilty of a crime but little,\r\nif any thing, inferior to that which brought Simon Lord Lovat to the\r\nblock,\"--adding that Patrick's speech had \"exceeded the most seditious\r\nand inflammatory harangues of the Tribunes of Old Rome.\"[59] Here,\r\nthen, thus early in his career, even in this sorrowful and alarmed\r\ncriticism on the supposed error of his speech, we find a token of that\r\nloving interest in him and in his personal fate, which even in those\r\ndays began to possess the heartstrings of many a Virginian all about\r\nthe land, and which thenceforward steadily broadened and deepened into\r\na sort of popular idolization of him. The mysterious hold which\r\nPatrick Henry came to have upon the people of Virginia is an historic\r\nfact, to be recognized, even if not accounted for. He was to make\r\nenemies in abundance, as will appear; he was to stir up against\r\nhimself the alarm of many thoughtful and conservative minds, the\r\ndeadly hatred of many an old leader in colonial politics, the deadly\r\nenvy of many a younger aspirant to public influence; he was to go on\r\nruffling the plumage and upsetting the combinations of all sorts of\r\ngood citizens, who, from time to time, in making their reckonings\r\nwithout him, kept finding that they had reckoned without their host.\r\nBut for all that, the willingness of this worthy Mr. Cootes of James\r\nRiver to part with his money, if need be, rather than his friend\r\nPatrick should go far wrong, seems to be one token of the beginning of\r\nthat deep and swelling passion of love for him that never abated among\r\nthe mass of the people of Virginia so long as Patrick lived, and\r\nperhaps has never abated since.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to imagine the impulse which so astonishing a forensic\r\nsuccess must have given to the professional and political career of\r\nthe young advocate. Not only was he immediately retained by the\r\ndefendants in all the other suits of the same kind then instituted in\r\nthe courts of the colony, but, as his fee-books show, from that hour\r\nhis legal practice of every sort received an enormous increase.\r\nMoreover, the people of Virginia, always a warm-hearted people, were\r\nthen, to a degree almost inconceivable at the North, sensitive to\r\noratory, and admirers of eloquent men. The first test by which they\r\ncommonly ascertained the fitness of a man for public office, concerned\r\nhis ability to make a speech; and it cannot be doubted that from the\r\nmoment of Patrick Henry's amazing harangue in the \"Parsons' Cause,\"--a\r\npiece of oratory altogether surpassing anything ever before heard in\r\nVirginia,--the eyes of men began to fasten upon him as destined to\r\nsome splendid and great part in political life.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years of his career, Williamsburg was the capital\r\nof the colony,--the official residence of its governor, the place of\r\nassemblage for its legislature and its highest courts, and, at certain\r\nseasons of the year, the scene of no little vice-regal and provincial\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nThither our Patrick had gone in 1760 to get permission to be a lawyer.\r\nThither he now goes once more, in 1764, to give some proof of his\r\nquality in the profession to which he had been reluctantly admitted,\r\nand to win for himself the first of a long series of triumphs at the\r\ncolonial capital,--triumphs which gave food for wondering talk to all\r\nhis contemporaries, and long lingered in the memories of old men. Soon\r\nafter the assembling of the legislature, in the fall of 1764, the\r\ncommittee on privileges and elections had before them the case of\r\nJames Littlepage, who had taken his seat as member for the county of\r\nHanover, but whose right to the seat was contested, on a charge of\r\nbribery and corruption, by Nathaniel West Dandridge. For a day or two\r\nbefore the hearing of the case, the members of the house had \"observed\r\nan ill-dressed young man sauntering in the lobby,\" apparently a\r\nstranger to everybody, moving \"awkwardly about ... with a countenance\r\nof abstraction and total unconcern as to what was passing around him;\"\r\nbut who, when the committee convened to consider the case of Dandridge\r\nagainst Littlepage, at once took his place as counsel for the former.\r\nThe members of the committee, either not catching his name or not\r\nrecalling the association attaching to it from the scene at Hanover\r\nCourt House nearly a twelvemonth before, were so affected by his\r\nrustic and ungainly appearance that they treated him with neglect and\r\neven with discourtesy; until, when his turn came to argue the cause of\r\nhis client, he poured forth such a torrent of eloquence, and exhibited\r\nwith so much force and splendor the sacredness of the suffrage and the\r\nimportance of protecting it, that the incivility and contempt of the\r\ncommittee were turned into admiration.[60] Nevertheless, it appears\r\nfrom the journals of the House that, whatever may have been the\r\nadmiration of the committee for the eloquence of Mr. Dandridge's\r\nadvocate, they did not award the seat to Mr. Dandridge.\r\n\r\nSuch was Patrick Henry's first contact with the legislature of\r\nVirginia,--a body of which he was soon to become a member, and over\r\nwhich, in spite of the social prestige, the talents, and the envious\r\nopposition of its old leaders, he was promptly to gain an ascendancy\r\nthat constituted him, almost literally, the dictator of its\r\nproceedings, so long as he chose to hold a place in it. On the present\r\noccasion, having finished the somewhat obscure business that had\r\nbrought him before the committee, it is probable that he instantly\r\ndisappeared from the scene, not to return to it until the following\r\nspring, when he came back to transact business with the House itself.\r\nFor, early in May, 1765, a vacancy having occurred in the\r\nrepresentation for the county of Louisa, Patrick Henry, though not\r\nthen a resident in that county, was elected as its member. The first\r\nentry to be met with in the journals, indicating his presence in the\r\nHouse, is that of his appointment, on the 20th of May, as an\r\nadditional member of the committee for courts of justice. Between that\r\ndate and the 1st of June, when the House was angrily dissolved by the\r\ngovernor, this young and very rural member contrived to do two or\r\nthree quite notable things--things, in fact, so notable that they\r\nconveyed to the people of Virginia the tidings of the advent among\r\nthem of a great political leader, gave an historic impulse to the\r\nseries of measures which ended in the disruption of the British\r\nEmpire, and set his own name a ringing through the world,--not without\r\nlively imputations of treason, and comforting assurances that he was\r\ndestined to be hanged.\r\n\r\nThe first of these notable things is one which incidentally throws a\r\nrather painful glare on the corruptions of political life in our old\r\nand belauded colonial days. The speaker of the House of Burgesses at\r\nthat time was John Robinson, a man of great estate, foremost among all\r\nthe landed aristocracy of Virginia. He had then been speaker for about\r\ntwenty-five years; for a long time, also, he had been treasurer of the\r\ncolony; and in the latter capacity he had been accustomed for many\r\nyears to lend the public money, on his own private account, to his\r\npersonal and political friends, and particularly to those of them who\r\nwere members of the House. This profligate business had continued so\r\nlong that Robinson had finally become a defaulter to an enormous\r\namount; and in order to avert the shame and ruin of an exposure, he\r\nand his particular friends, just before the arrival of Patrick Henry,\r\nhad invented a very pretty device, to be called a \"public loan\r\noffice,\"--\"from which monies might be lent on public account, and on\r\ngood landed security, to individuals,\" and by which, as was expected,\r\nthe debts due to Robinson on the loans which he had been granting\r\nmight be \"transferred to the public, and his deficit thus completely\r\ncovered.\"[61] Accordingly, the scheme was brought forward under nearly\r\nevery possible advantage of influential support. It was presented to\r\nthe House and to the public as a measure eminently wise and\r\nbeneficial. It was supported in the House by many powerful and\r\nhonorable members who had not the remotest suspicion of the corrupt\r\npurpose lying at the bottom of it. Apparently it was on the point of\r\nadoption when, from among the members belonging to the upper counties,\r\nthere arose this raw youth, who had only just taken his seat, and who,\r\nwithout any information respecting the secret intent of the measure,\r\nand equally without any disposition to let the older and statelier\r\nmembers do his thinking for him, simply attacked it, as a scheme to be\r\ncondemned on general principles. From the door of the lobby that day\r\nthere stood peering into the Assembly Thomas Jefferson, then a law\r\nstudent at Williamsburg, who thus had the good luck to witness the\r\ndébut of his old comrade. \"He laid open with so much energy the spirit\r\nof favoritism on which the proposition was founded, and the abuses to\r\nwhich it would lead, that it was crushed in its birth.\"[62] He\r\n\"attacked the scheme ... in that style of bold, grand, and\r\noverwhelming eloquence for which he became so justly celebrated\r\nafterwards. He carried with him all the members of the upper\r\ncounties, and left a minority composed merely of the aristocracy of\r\nthe country. From this time his popularity swelled apace; and Robinson\r\ndying four years after, his deficit was brought to light, and\r\ndiscovered the true object of the proposition.\"[63]\r\n\r\nBut a subject far greater than John Robinson's project for a loan\r\noffice was then beginning to weigh on men's minds. Already were\r\nvisible far off on the edge of the sky, the first filmy threads of a\r\nstorm-cloud that was to grow big and angry as the years went by, and\r\nwas to accompany a political tempest under which the British Empire\r\nwould be torn asunder, and the whole structure of American colonial\r\nsociety wrenched from its foundations. Just one year before the time\r\nnow reached, news had been received in Virginia that the British\r\nministry had announced in parliament their purpose to introduce, at\r\nthe next session, an act for laying certain stamp duties on the\r\nAmerican colonies. Accordingly, in response to these tidings, the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, in the autumn of 1764, had taken the earliest\r\nopportunity to send a respectful message to the government of England,\r\ndeclaring that the proposed act would be deemed by the loyal and\r\naffectionate people of Virginia as an alarming violation of their\r\nancient constitutional rights. This message had been elaborately drawn\r\nup, in the form of an address to the king, a memorial to the House of\r\nLords, and a remonstrance to the Commons;[64] the writers being a\r\ncommittee composed of gentlemen prominent in the legislature, and of\r\nhigh social standing in the colony, including Landon Carter, Richard\r\nHenry Lee, George Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, Benjamin Harrison, Richard\r\nBland, and even Peyton Randolph, the king's attorney-general.\r\n\r\nMeantime, to this appeal no direct answer had been returned; instead\r\nof which, however, was received by the House of Burgesses, in May,\r\n1765, about the time of Patrick Henry's accession to that body, a copy\r\nof the Stamp Act itself. What was to be done about it? What was to be\r\ndone by Virginia? What was to be done by her sister colonies? Of\r\ncourse, by the passage of the Stamp Act, the whole question of\r\ncolonial procedure on the subject had been changed. While the act was,\r\neven in England, merely a theme for consideration, and while the\r\ncolonies were virtually under invitation to send thither their views\r\nupon the subject, it was perfectly proper for colonial pamphleteers\r\nand for colonial legislatures to express, in every civilized form,\r\ntheir objections to it. But all this was now over. The Stamp Act had\r\nbeen discussed; the discussion was ended; the act had been decided on;\r\nit had become a law. Criticism upon it now, especially by a\r\nlegislative body, was a very different matter from what criticism upon\r\nit had been, even by the same body, a few months before. Then, the\r\nloyal legislature of Virginia had fittingly spoken out, concerning the\r\ncontemplated act, its manly words of disapproval and of protest; but\r\nnow that the contemplated act had become an adopted act--had become\r\nthe law of the land--could that same legislature again speak even\r\nthose same words, without thereby becoming disloyal,--without\r\nventuring a little too near the verge of sedition,--without putting\r\nitself into an attitude, at least, of incipient nullification\r\nrespecting a law of the general government?\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly evident that by all the old leaders of the House at\r\nthat moment,--by Peyton Randolph, and Pendleton, and Wythe, and Bland,\r\nand the rest of them,--this question was answered in the negative.\r\nIndeed, it could be answered in no other way. Such being the case, it\r\nfollowed that, for Virginia and for all her sister colonies, an\r\nentirely new state of things had arisen. A most serious problem\r\nconfronted them,--a problem involving, in fact, incalculable\r\ninterests. On the subject of immediate concern, they had endeavored,\r\nfreely and rightfully, to influence legislation, while that\r\nlegislation was in process; but now that this legislation was\r\naccomplished, what were they to do? Were they to submit to it quietly,\r\ntrusting to further negotiations for ultimate relief, or were they to\r\nreject it outright, and try to obstruct its execution? Clearly, here\r\nwas a very great problem, a problem for statesmanship,--the best\r\nstatesmanship anywhere to be had. Clearly this was a time, at any\r\nrate, for wise and experienced men to come to the front; a time, not\r\nfor rash counsels, nor for spasmodic and isolated action on the part\r\nof any one colony, but for deliberate and united action on the part of\r\nall the colonies; a time in which all must move forward, or none. But,\r\nthus far, no colony had been heard from: there had not been time. Let\r\nVirginia wait a little. Let her make no mistake; let her not push\r\nforward into any ill-considered and dangerous measure; let her wait,\r\nat least, for some signal of thought or of purpose from her sister\r\ncolonies. In the meanwhile, let her old and tried leaders continue to\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nSuch, apparently, was the state of opinion in the House of Burgesses\r\nwhen, on the 29th of May, a motion was made and carried, \"that the\r\nHouse resolve itself into a committee of the whole House, immediately\r\nto consider the steps necessary to be taken in consequence of the\r\nresolutions of the House of Commons of Great Britain, relative to the\r\ncharging certain stamp duties in the colonies and plantations in\r\nAmerica.\"[65] On thus going into committee of the whole, to deliberate\r\non the most difficult and appalling question that, up to that time,\r\nhad ever come before an American legislature, the members may very\r\nnaturally have turned in expectation to those veteran politicians and\r\nto those able constitutional lawyers who, for many years, had been\r\naccustomed to guide their deliberations, and who, especially in the\r\nlast session, had taken charge of this very question of the Stamp\r\nAct. It will not be hard for us to imagine the disgust, the anger,\r\npossibly even the alarm, with which many may have beheld the floor now\r\ntaken, not by Peyton Randolph, nor Richard Bland, nor George Wythe,\r\nnor Edmund Pendleton, but by this new and very unabashed member for\r\nthe county of Louisa,--this rustic and clownish youth of the terrible\r\ntongue,--this eloquent but presumptuous stripling, who was absolutely\r\nwithout training or experience in statesmanship, and was the merest\r\nnovice even in the forms of the House.\r\n\r\nFor what precise purpose the new member had thus ventured to take the\r\nfloor, was known at the moment of his rising by only two other\r\nmembers,--George Johnston, the member for Fairfax, and John Fleming,\r\nthe member for Cumberland. But the measureless audacity of his\r\npurpose, as being nothing less than that of assuming the leadership of\r\nthe House, and of dictating the policy of Virginia in this stupendous\r\ncrisis of its fate, was instantly revealed to all, as he moved a\r\nseries of resolutions, which he proceeded to read from the blank leaf\r\nof an old law book, and which, probably, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Whereas_, the honorable House of Commons in England have\r\n     of late drawn into question how far the General Assembly of\r\n     this colony hath power to enact laws for laying of taxes and\r\n     imposing duties, payable by the people of this, his\r\n     majesty's most ancient colony: for settling and ascertaining\r\n     the same to all future times, the House of Burgesses of this\r\n     present General Assembly have come to the following\r\n     resolves:--\r\n\r\n     \"1. _Resolved_, That the first adventurers and settlers of\r\n     this, his majesty's colony and dominion, brought with them\r\n     and transmitted to their posterity, and all other his\r\n     majesty's subjects, since inhabiting in this, his majesty's\r\n     said colony, all the privileges, franchises, and immunities\r\n     that have at any time been held, enjoyed, and possessed, by\r\n     the people of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"2. _Resolved_, That by two royal charters, granted by king\r\n     James the First, the colonists aforesaid are declared\r\n     entitled to all the privileges, liberties, and immunities of\r\n     denizens and natural born subjects, to all intents and\r\n     purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within the\r\n     realm of England.\r\n\r\n     \"3. _Resolved_, That the taxation of the people by\r\n     themselves or by persons chosen by themselves to represent\r\n     them, who can only know what taxes the people are able to\r\n     bear, and the easiest mode of raising them, and are equally\r\n     affected by such taxes themselves, is the distinguishing\r\n     characteristic of British freedom, and without which the\r\n     ancient constitution cannot subsist.\r\n\r\n     \"4. _Resolved_, That his majesty's liege people of this most\r\n     ancient colony have uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of\r\n     being thus governed by their own Assembly in the article of\r\n     their taxes and internal police, and that the same hath\r\n     never been forfeited, or any other way given up, but hath\r\n     been constantly recognized by the kings and people of Great\r\n     Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"5. _Resolved_, therefore, That the General Assembly of this\r\n     colony have the only and sole exclusive right and power to\r\n     lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of this\r\n     colony; and that every attempt to vest such power in any\r\n     person or persons whatsoever, other than the General\r\n     Assembly aforesaid, has a manifest tendency to destroy\r\n     British as well as American freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"6. _Resolved_, That his majesty's liege people, the\r\n     inhabitants of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience\r\n     to any law or ordinance whatever, designed to impose any\r\n     taxation whatsoever upon them, other than the laws or\r\n     ordinances of the General Assembly aforesaid.\r\n\r\n     \"7. _Resolved_, That any person who shall, by speaking or\r\n     writing, assert or maintain that any person or persons,\r\n     other than the General Assembly of this colony, have any\r\n     right or power to impose or lay any taxation on the people\r\n     here, shall be deemed an enemy to his majesty's colony.\"[66]\r\n\r\nNo reader will find it hard to accept Jefferson's statement that the\r\ndebate on these resolutions was \"most bloody.\" \"They were opposed by\r\nRandolph, Bland, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe, and all the old members,\r\nwhose influence in the House had till then been unbroken.\"[67] There\r\nwas every reason, whether of public policy or of private feeling, why\r\nthe old party leaders in the House should now bestir themselves, and\r\ncombine, and put forth all their powers in debate, to check, and if\r\npossible to rout and extinguish, this self-conceited but most\r\ndangerous young man. \"Many threats were uttered, and much abuse cast\r\non me,\" said Patrick himself, long afterward. Logic, learning,\r\neloquence, denunciation, derision, intimidation, were poured from all\r\nsides of the House upon the head of the presumptuous intruder; but\r\nalone, or almost alone, he confronted and defeated all his assailants.\r\n\"Torrents of sublime eloquence from Mr. Henry, backed by the solid\r\nreasoning of Johnston, prevailed.\"[68]\r\n\r\nIt was sometime in the course of this tremendous fight, extending\r\nthrough the 29th and 30th of May, that the incident occurred which has\r\nlong been familiar among the anecdotes of the Revolution, and which\r\nmay be here recalled as a reminiscence not only of his own consummate\r\nmastery of the situation, but of a most dramatic scene in an\r\nepoch-making debate. Reaching the climax of a passage of fearful\r\ninvective, on the injustice and the impolicy of the Stamp Act, he said\r\nin tones of thrilling solemnity, \"Cæsar had his Brutus; Charles the\r\nFirst, his Cromwell; and George the Third ['Treason,' shouted the\r\nspeaker. 'Treason,' 'treason,' rose from all sides of the room. The\r\norator paused in stately defiance till these rude exclamations were\r\nended, and then, rearing himself with a look and bearing of still\r\nprouder and fiercer determination, he so closed the sentence as to\r\nbaffle his accusers, without in the least flinching from his own\r\nposition,]--and George the Third may profit by their example. If this\r\nbe treason, make the most of it.\"[69]\r\n\r\nOf this memorable struggle nearly all other details have perished with\r\nthe men who took part in it. After the House, in committee of the\r\nwhole, had, on the 29th of May, spent sufficient time in the\r\ndiscussion, \"Mr. Speaker resumed the chair,\" says the Journal, \"and\r\nMr. Attorney reported that the said committee had had the said matter\r\nunder consideration, and had come to several resolutions thereon,\r\nwhich he was ready to deliver in at the table. Ordered that the said\r\nreport be received to-morrow.\" It is probable that on the morrow the\r\nbattle was renewed with even greater fierceness than before. The\r\nJournal proceeds: \"May 30. Mr. Attorney, from the committee of the\r\nwhole House, reported according to order, that the committee had\r\nconsidered the steps necessary to be taken in consequence of the\r\nresolutions of the House of Commons of Great Britain, relative to the\r\ncharging certain stamp duties in the colonies and plantations in\r\nAmerica, and that they had come to several resolutions thereon, which\r\nhe read in his place and then delivered at the table; when they were\r\nagain twice read, and agreed to by the House, with some amendments.\"\r\nThen were passed by the House, probably, the first five resolutions as\r\noffered by Henry in the committee, but \"passed,\" as he himself\r\nafterward wrote, \"by a very small majority, perhaps of one or two\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this final discomfiture of the old leaders, one of their number,\r\nPeyton Randolph, swept angrily out of the house, and brushing past\r\nyoung Thomas Jefferson, who was standing in the door of the lobby, he\r\nswore, with a great oath, that he \"would have given five hundred\r\nguineas for a single vote.\"[70] On the afternoon of that day, Patrick\r\nHenry, knowing that the session was practically ended, and that his\r\nown work in it was done, started for his home. He was seen \"passing\r\nalong Duke of Gloucester Street, ... wearing buckskin breeches, his\r\nsaddle bags on his arm, leading a lean horse, and chatting with Paul\r\nCarrington, who walked by his side.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThat was on the 30th of May. The next morning, the terrible Patrick\r\nbeing at last quite out of the way, those veteran lawyers and\r\npoliticians of the House, who had found this young protagonist alone\r\ntoo much for them all put together, made bold to undo the worst part\r\nof the work he had done the day before; they expunged the fifth\r\nresolution. In that mutilated form, without the preamble, and with the\r\nlast three of the original resolutions omitted, the first four then\r\nremained on the journal of the House as the final expression of its\r\nofficial opinion. Meantime, on the wings of the wind, and on the eager\r\ntongues of men, had been borne, past recall, far northward and far\r\nsouthward, the fiery unchastised words of nearly the entire series, to\r\nkindle in all the colonies a great flame of dauntless purpose;[72]\r\nwhile Patrick himself, perhaps then only half conscious of the fateful\r\nwork he had just been doing, travelled homeward along the dusty\r\nhighway, at once the jolliest, the most popular, and the least\r\npretentious man in all Virginia, certainly its greatest orator,\r\npossibly even its greatest statesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Wirt, 24.\r\n\r\n[58] Meade, _Old Families and Churches of Va._ i. 220.\r\n\r\n[59] Maury, _Mem. of a Huguenot Fam._ 423.\r\n\r\n[60] Wirt, 39-41.\r\n\r\n[61] Mem. by Jefferson, in _Hist.

Edmund Randolph, in his _History\r\nof Virginia_, still in manuscript, has a somewhat different version of\r\nthe language of the orator, as follows: \"'Cæsar had his Brutus,\r\nCharles the First, his Cromwell, and George the Third'--'Treason,\r\nSir,' exclaimed the Speaker; to which Mr. Henry instantly replied,\r\n'and George the Third, may he never have either.'\" The version\r\nfurnished by John Tyler is, of course, the more effective and\r\ncharacteristic; and as Tyler actually heard the speech, and as,\r\nmoreover, his account is confirmed by Jefferson who also heard it, his\r\naccount can hardly be set aside by that of Randolph who did not hear\r\nit, and was indeed but a boy of twelve at the time it was made.

In brief, my conclusion is this: That\r\nthe series as given above, consisting of a preamble and seven\r\nresolutions, is the series as originally prepared by Patrick Henry,\r\nand introduced by him on Wednesday, May 29, in the committee of the\r\nwhole, and probably passed by the committee on that day; that at once,\r\nwithout waiting for the action of the House upon the subject, copies\r\nof the series got abroad, and were soon published in the newspapers of\r\nthe several colonies, as though actually adopted by the House; that on\r\nThursday, May 30, the series was cut down in the House by rejection of\r\nthe preamble and the resolutions 6 and 7, and by the adoption of only\r\nthe first five as given above; that on the day after that, when\r\nPatrick Henry had gone home, the House still further cut down the\r\nseries by expunging the resolution which is above numbered as 5: and\r\nthat, many years afterwards, when Patrick Henry came to prepare a copy\r\nfor transmission to posterity, he gave the resolutions just as they\r\nstood when adopted by the House on May 30, and not as they stood when\r\noriginally introduced by him in committee of the whole on the day\r\nbefore, nor as they stood when mutilated by the cowardly act of the\r\nHouse on the day after. It will be noticed, therefore, that the\r\nso-called resolutions of Virginia, which were actually published and\r\nknown to the colonies in 1765, and which did so much to fire their\r\nhearts, were not the resolutions as adopted by the House, but were the\r\nresolutions as first introduced, and probably passed, in committee of\r\nthe whole; and that even this copy of them was inaccurately given,\r\nsince it lacked the resolution numbered above as 3, probably owing to\r\nan error in the first hurried transcription of them. Those who care to\r\nstudy the subject further will find the materials in _Prior\r\nDocuments_, 6, 7; Marshall, _Life of Washington_, i. note iv.;\r\nFrothingham, _Rise of the Republic_, 180 note; Gordon, _Hist. Am.\r\nRev._, i. 129-139; _Works of Jefferson_, vi. 366, 367; Wirt, _Life of\r\nHenry_, 56-63; Everett, _Life of Henry_, 265-273, with important note\r\nby Jared Sparks in Appendix, 391-398. It may be mentioned that the\r\nnarrative given in Burk, _Hist. Va._, iii. 305-310, is untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nSeldom has a celebrated man shown more indifference to the\r\npreservation of the records and credentials of his career than did\r\nPatrick Henry. While some of his famous associates in the Revolution\r\ndiligently kept both the letters they received, and copies of the\r\nletters they wrote, and made, for the benefit of posterity, careful\r\nmemoranda concerning the events of their lives, Patrick Henry did none\r\nof these things. Whatever letters he wrote, he wrote at a dash, and\r\nthen parted with them utterly; whatever letters were written to him,\r\nwere invariably handed over by him to the comfortable custody of luck;\r\nand as to the correct historic perpetuation of his doings, he seems\r\nalmost to have exhausted his interest in each one of them so soon as\r\nhe had accomplished it, and to have been quite content to leave to\r\nother people all responsibility for its being remembered correctly, or\r\neven remembered at all.\r\n\r\nTo this statement, however, a single exception has to be made. It\r\nrelates to the great affair described in the latter part of the\r\nprevious chapter.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was perceived at the time that the passing of the\r\nVirginia resolutions against the Stamp Act was a great affair; but\r\njust how great an affair it was, neither Patrick Henry nor any other\r\nmortal man could tell until years had gone by, and had unfolded the\r\nvast sequence of world-resounding events, in which that affair was\r\nproved to be a necessary factor. It deserves to be particularly\r\nmentioned that, of all the achievements of his life, the only one\r\nwhich he has taken the pains to give any account of is his authorship\r\nof the Virginia resolutions, and his successful championship of them.\r\nWith reference to this achievement, the account he gave of it was\r\nrendered with so much solemnity and impressiveness as to indicate\r\nthat, in the final survey of his career, he regarded this as the one\r\nmost important thing he ever did. But before we cite the words in\r\nwhich he thus indicated this judgment, it will be well for us to\r\nglance briefly at the train of historic incidents which now set forth\r\nthe striking connection between that act of Patrick Henry and the\r\nearly development of that intrepid policy which culminated in American\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 29th of May, 1765, as will be remembered, that Patrick\r\nHenry moved in the committee of the whole the adoption of his series\r\nof resolutions against the Stamp Act; and before the sun went down\r\nthat day, the entire series, as is probable, was adopted by the\r\ncommittee. On the following day, the essential portion of the series\r\nwas adopted, likewise, by the House. But what was the contemporary\r\nsignificance of these resolutions? As the news of them swept from\r\ncolony to colony, why did they so stir men's hearts to excitement, and\r\neven to alarm? It was not that the language of those resolutions was\r\nmore radical or more trenchant than had been the language already used\r\non the same subject, over and over again, in the discussions of the\r\npreceding twelve months. It was that, in the recent change of the\r\npolitical situation, the significance of that language had changed.\r\nPrior to the time referred to, whatever had been said on the subject,\r\nin any of the colonies, had been said for the purpose of dissuading\r\nthe government from passing the Stamp Act. But the government had now\r\npassed the Stamp Act; and, accordingly, these resolutions must have\r\nbeen meant for a very different purpose. They were a virtual\r\ndeclaration of resistance to the Stamp Act; a declaration of\r\nresistance made, not by an individual writer, nor by a newspaper, but\r\nby the legislature of a great colony; and, moreover, they were the\r\nvery first declaration of resistance which was so made.[73]\r\n\r\nThis it is which gives us the contemporary key to their significance,\r\nand to the vast excitement produced by them, and to the enormous\r\ninfluence they had upon the trembling purposes of the colonists at\r\nthat precise moment. Hence it was, as a sagacious writer of that\r\nperiod has told us, that merely upon the adoption of these resolves by\r\nthe committee of the whole, men recognized their momentous bearing,\r\nand could not be restrained from giving publicity to them, without\r\nwaiting for their final adoption by the House. \"A manuscript of the\r\nunrevised resolves,\" says William Gordon, \"soon reached Philadelphia,\r\nhaving been sent off immediately upon their passing, that the earliest\r\ninformation of what had been done might be obtained by the Sons of\r\nLiberty.... At New York the resolves were handed about with great\r\nprivacy: they were accounted so treasonable, that the possessors of\r\nthem declined printing them in that city.\" But a copy of them having\r\nbeen procured with much difficulty by an Irish gentleman resident in\r\nConnecticut, \"he carried them to New England, where they were\r\npublished and circulated far and wide in the newspapers, without any\r\nreserve, and proved eventually the occasion of those disorders which\r\nafterward broke out in the colonies.... The Virginia resolutions gave\r\na spring to all the disgusted; and they began to adopt different\r\nmeasures.\"[74]\r\n\r\nBut while the tidings of these resolutions were thus moving toward New\r\nEngland, and before they had arrived there, the assembly of the great\r\ncolony of Massachusetts had begun to take action. Indeed, it had first\r\nmet on the very day on which Patrick Henry had introduced his\r\nresolutions into the committee of the whole at Williamsburg. On the\r\n8th of June, it had resolved upon a circular letter concerning the\r\nStamp Act, addressed to all the sister colonies, and proposing that\r\nall should send delegates to a congress to be held at New York, on the\r\nfirst Tuesday of the following October, to deal with the perils and\r\nduties of the situation. This circular letter at once started upon its\r\ntour.\r\n\r\nThe first reception of it, however, was discouraging. From the speaker\r\nof the New Jersey assembly came the reply that the members of that\r\nbody were \"unanimously against uniting on the present occasion;\" and\r\nfor several weeks thereafter, \"no movement appeared in favor of the\r\ngreat and wise measure of convening a congress.\" At last, however, the\r\nproject of Massachusetts began to feel the accelerating force of a\r\nmighty impetus. The Virginia resolutions, being at last divulged\r\nthroughout the land, \"had a marked effect on public opinion.\" They\r\nwere \"heralded as the voice of a colony.... The fame of the resolves\r\nspread as they were circulated in the journals.... The Virginia\r\naction, like an alarum, roused the patriots to pass similar\r\nresolves.[75] \"On the 8th of July, \"The Boston Gazette\" uttered this\r\nmost significant sentence: \"The people of Virginia have spoken very\r\nsensibly, and the frozen politicians of a more northern government say\r\nthey have spoken treason.\"[76] On the same day, in that same town of\r\nBoston, an aged lawyer and patriot[77] lay upon his death bed; and in\r\nhis admiration for the Virginians on account of these resolves, he\r\nexclaimed, \"They are men; they are noble spirits.\"[78] On the 13th of\r\nAugust, the people of Providence instructed their representatives in\r\nthe legislature to vote in favor of the congress, and to procure the\r\npassage of a series of resolutions in which were incorporated those of\r\nVirginia.[79] On the 15th of August, from Boston, Governor Bernard\r\nwrote home to the ministry: \"Two or three months ago, I thought that\r\nthis people would submit to the Stamp Act. Murmurs were indeed\r\ncontinually heard; but they seemed to be such as would die away. But\r\nthe publishing of the Virginia resolves proved an alarm bell to the\r\ndisaffected.\"[80] On the 23d of September, General Gage, the commander\r\nof the British forces in America, wrote from New York to Secretary\r\nConway that the Virginia resolves had given \"the signal for a general\r\noutcry over the continent.\"[81] And finally, in the autumn of 1774, an\r\nable loyalist writer, looking back over the political history of the\r\ncolonies from the year of the Stamp Act, singled out the Virginia\r\nresolves as the baleful cause of all the troubles that had then come\r\nupon the land. \"After it was known,\" said he, \"that the Stamp Act was\r\npassed, some resolves of the House of Burgesses in Virginia, denying\r\nthe right of Parliament to tax the colonies, made their appearance. We\r\nread them with wonder; they savored of independence; they flattered\r\nthe human passions; the reasoning was specious; we wished it\r\nconclusive. The transition to believing it so was easy; and we, and\r\nalmost all America, followed their example, in resolving that\r\nParliament had no such right.\"[82]\r\n\r\nAll these facts, and many more that might be produced, seem to point\r\nto the Virginia resolutions of 1765 as having come at a great primary\r\ncrisis of the Revolution,--a crisis of mental confusion and\r\nhesitation,--and as having then uttered, with trumpet voice, the very\r\nword that was fitted to the hour, and that gave to men's minds\r\nclearness of vision, and to their hearts a settled purpose. It must\r\nhave been in the light of such facts as these that Patrick Henry, in\r\nhis old age, reviewing his own wonderful career, determined to make a\r\nsort of testamentary statement concerning his relation to that single\r\ntransaction,--so vitally connected with the greatest epoch in American\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers left by him at his death was one significantly placed\r\nby the side of his will, carefully sealed, and bearing this\r\nsuperscription: \"Inclosed are the resolutions of the Virginia Assembly\r\nin 1765, concerning the Stamp Act. Let my executors open this paper.\"\r\nOn opening the document, his executors found on one side of the sheet\r\nthe first five resolutions in the famous series introduced by him; and\r\non the other side, these weighty words:--\r\n\r\n     The within resolutions passed the House of Burgesses in May,\r\n     1765. They formed the first opposition to the Stamp Act, and\r\n     the scheme of taxing America by the British parliament. All\r\n     the colonies, either through fear, or want of opportunity to\r\n     form an opposition, or from influence of some kind or other,\r\n     had remained silent. I had been for the first time elected a\r\n     Burgess a few days before; was young, inexperienced,\r\n     unacquainted with the forms of the House, and the members\r\n     that composed it. Finding the men of weight averse to\r\n     opposition, and the commencement of the tax at hand, and\r\n     that no person was likely to step forth, I determined to\r\n     venture; and alone, unadvised, and unassisted, on a blank\r\n     leaf of an old law book, wrote the within.[83] Upon\r\n     offering them to the House, violent debates ensued. Many\r\n     threats were uttered, and much abuse cast on me by the party\r\n     for submission. After a long and warm contest, the\r\n     resolutions passed by a very small majority, perhaps of one\r\n     or two only. The alarm spread throughout America with\r\n     astonishing quickness, and the ministerial party were\r\n     overwhelmed. The great point of resistance to British\r\n     taxation was universally established in the colonies. This\r\n     brought on the war, which finally separated the two\r\n     countries, and gave independence to ours.\r\n\r\n     Whether this will prove a blessing or a curse, will depend\r\n     upon the use our people make of the blessings which a\r\n     gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise, they\r\n     will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary\r\n     character, they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can\r\n     exalt them as a nation.\r\n\r\n     Reader! whoever thou art, remember this; and in thy sphere\r\n     practice virtue thyself, and encourage it in others.\r\n\r\n                                                  P. HENRY.[84]\r\n\r\nBut while this renowned act in Patrick Henry's life had consequences\r\nso notable in their bearing on great national and international\r\nmovements, it is interesting to observe, also, its immediate effects\r\non his own personal position in the world, and on the development of\r\nhis career. We can hardly be surprised to find, on the one hand, that\r\nhis act gave deep offence to one very considerable class of persons in\r\nVirginia,--the official representatives of the English government, and\r\ntheir natural allies, those thoughtful and conscientious colonists\r\nwho, by temperament and conviction, were inclined to lay a heavy\r\naccent on the principle of civil authority and order. Of course, as\r\nthe official head of this not ignoble class, stood Francis Fauquier,\r\nthe lieutenant-governor of the colony; and his letter to the lords of\r\ntrade, written from Williamsburg a few days after the close of the\r\nsession, contains a striking narrative of this stormy proceeding, and\r\nan almost amusing touch of official undervaluation of Patrick Henry:\r\n\"In the course of the debate, I have heard that very indecent language\r\nwas used by a Mr. Henry, a young lawyer, who had not been above a\r\nmonth a member of the House, and who carried all the young members\r\nwith him.\"[85] But a far more specific and intense expression of\r\nantipathy came, a few weeks later, from the Reverend William Robinson,\r\nthe colonial commissary of the Bishop of London. Writing, on the 12th\r\nof August, to his metropolitan, he gave an account of Patrick Henry's\r\nvery offensive management of the cause against the parsons, before\r\nbecoming a member of the House of Burgesses; and then added:--\r\n\r\n     \"He has since been chosen a representative for one of the\r\n     counties, in which character he has lately distinguished\r\n     himself in the House of Burgesses on occasion of the arrival\r\n     of an act of Parliament for stamp duties, while the Assembly\r\n     was sitting. He blazed out in a violent speech against the\r\n     authority of Parliament and the king, comparing his majesty\r\n     to a Tarquin, a Cæsar, and a Charles the First, and not\r\n     sparing insinuations that he wished another Cromwell would\r\n     arise. He made a motion for several outrageous resolves,\r\n     some of which passed and were again erased as soon as his\r\n     back was turned.... Mr. Henry, the hero of whom I have been\r\n     writing, is gone quietly into the upper parts of the country\r\n     to recommend himself to his constituents by spreading\r\n     treason and enforcing firm resolutions against the authority\r\n     of the British Parliament.\"[86]\r\n\r\nSuch was Patrick Henry's introduction to the upper spheres of English\r\nsociety,--spheres in which his name was to become still better known\r\nas time rolled on, and for conduct not likely to efface the impression\r\nof this bitter beginning.\r\n\r\nAs to his reputation in the colonies outside of Virginia, doubtless\r\nthe progress of it, during this period, was slow and dim; for the\r\ncelebrity acquired by the resolutions of 1765 attached to the colony\r\nrather than to the person. Moreover, the boundaries of each colony, in\r\nthose days, were in most cases the boundaries likewise of the personal\r\nreputations it cherished. It was not until Patrick Henry came\r\nforward, in the Congress of 1774, upon an arena that may be called\r\nnational, that his name gathered about it the splendor of a national\r\nfame. Yet, even before 1774, in the rather dull and ungossiping\r\nnewspapers of that time, and in the letters and diaries of its public\r\nmen, may be discovered an occasional allusion showing that already his\r\nname had broken over the borders of Virginia, had traveled even so far\r\nas to New England, and that in Boston itself he was a person whom\r\npeople were beginning to talk about. For example, in his Diary for the\r\n22d of July, 1770, John Adams speaks of meeting some gentlemen from\r\nVirginia, and of going out to Cambridge with them. One of them is\r\nmentioned by name as having this distinction,--that he \"is an intimate\r\nfriend of Mr. Patrick Henry, the first mover of the Virginia resolves\r\nin 1765.\"[87] Thus, even so early, the incipient revolutionist in New\r\nEngland had got his thoughts on his brilliant political kinsman in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nBut it was chiefly within the limits of his own splendid and gallant\r\ncolony, and among an eager and impressionable people whose habitual\r\nhatred of all restraints turned into undying love for this dashing\r\nchampion of natural liberty, that Patrick Henry was now instantly\r\ncrowned with his crown of sovereignty. By his resolutions against the\r\nStamp Act, as Jefferson testifies, \"Mr. Henry took the lead out of the\r\nhands of those who had heretofore guided the proceedings of the\r\nHouse, that is to say, of Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, Randolph, and\r\nNicholas.\"[88] Wirt does not put the case too strongly when he\r\ndeclares, that \"after this debate there was no longer a question among\r\nthe body of the people, as to Mr. Henry's being the first statesman\r\nand orator in Virginia. Those, indeed, whose ranks he had scattered,\r\nand whom he had thrown into the shade, still tried to brand him with\r\nthe names of declaimer and demagogue. But this was obviously the\r\neffect of envy and mortified pride.... From the period of which we\r\nhave been speaking, Mr. Henry became the idol of the people of\r\nVirginia.\"[89]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] See this view supported by Wirt, in his life by Kennedy, ii. 73.\r\n\r\n[74] Gordon, _Hist. of Am.

As early as 1790,\r\nMadison, between whom and Henry there was nearly always a sharp\r\nhostility, significantly asked Edmund Pendleton to tell him \"where the\r\nresolutions proposed by Mr. Henry really originated.\" _Letters and\r\nOther Writings of Madison_, i. 515. Edmund Randolph is said to have\r\nasserted that they were written by William Fleming; a statement of\r\nwhich Jefferson remarked, \"It is to me incomprehensible.\" _Works_, vi.\r\n484. But to Jefferson's own testimony on the same subject, I would\r\napply the same remark. In his Memorandum, he says without hesitation\r\nthat the resolutions \"were drawn up by George Johnston, a lawyer of\r\nthe Northern Neck, a very able, logical, and correct speaker.\" _Hist.\r\nMag._ for 1867, 91. But in another paper, written at about the same\r\ntime, Jefferson said: \"I can readily enough believe these resolutions\r\nwere written by Mr. Henry himself. They bear the stamp of his mind,\r\nstrong, without precision. That they were written by Johnston, who\r\nseconded them, was only the rumor of the day, and very possibly\r\nunfounded.\" _Works_, vi. 484. In the face of all this tissue of rumor,\r\nguesswork, and self-contradiction, the deliberate statement of Patrick\r\nHenry himself that he wrote the five resolutions referred to by him,\r\nand that he wrote them \"alone, unadvised, and unassisted,\" must close\r\nthe discussion.\r\n\r\n[84] Verified from the original manuscript, now in possession of Mr.\r\nW.

The\r\nfirst five years of his professional life had witnessed his advance,\r\nas we have seen, by strides which only genius can make, from great\r\nobscurity to great distinction; his advance from a condition of\r\nuniversal failure to one of success so universal that his career may\r\nbe said to have become within that brief period solidly established.\r\nAt the bar, upon the hustings, in the legislature, as a master of\r\npolicies, as a leader of men, he had already proved himself to be, of\r\nhis kind, without a peer in all the colony of Virginia,--a colony\r\nwhich was then the prolific mother of great men. With him, therefore,\r\nthe period of training and of tentative struggle had passed: the\r\nperiod now entered upon was one of recognized mastership and of\r\nassured performance, along lines certified by victories that came\r\ngayly, and apparently at his slightest call.\r\n\r\nWe note, at the beginning of this period, an event indicating\r\nsubstantial prosperity in his life: he acquires the visible dignity of\r\na country-seat. Down to the end of 1763, and probably even to the\r\nsummer of 1765, he had continued to live in the neighborhood of\r\nHanover Court House. After coming back from his first term of service\r\nin the House of Burgesses, where he had sat as member for the county\r\nof Louisa, he removed his residence into that county, and established\r\nhimself there upon an estate called Roundabout, purchased by him of\r\nhis father. In 1768 he returned to Hanover, and in 1771 he bought a\r\nplace in that county called Scotch Town, which continued to be his\r\nseat until shortly after the Declaration of Independence, when, having\r\nbecome governor of the new State of Virginia, he took up his residence\r\nat Williamsburg, in the palace long occupied by the official\r\nrepresentatives of royalty.\r\n\r\nFor the practice of his profession, the earlier portion of this period\r\nwas perhaps not altogether unfavorable. The political questions then\r\nin debate were, indeed, exciting, but they had not quite reached the\r\nultimate issue, and did not yet demand from him the complete surrender\r\nof his life. Those years seem to have been marked by great\r\nprofessional activity on his part, and by considerable growth in his\r\nreputation, even for the higher and more difficult work of the law. Of\r\ncourse, as the vast controversy between the colonists and Great\r\nBritain grew in violence, all controversies between one colonist and\r\nanother began to seem petty, and to be postponed; even the courts\r\nceased to meet with much regularity, and finally ceased to meet at\r\nall; while Patrick Henry himself, forsaking his private concerns,\r\nbecame entirely absorbed in the concerns of the public.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations in his engagements as a lawyer, during all these\r\nyears, may be traced with some certainty by the entries in his\r\nfee-books. For the year 1765, he charges fees in 547 cases; for 1766,\r\nin 114 cases; for 1767, in 554 cases; for 1768, in 354 cases. With the\r\nnext year there begins a great falling off in the number of his cases;\r\nand the decline continues till 1774, when, in the convulsions of the\r\ntime, his practice stops altogether. Thus, for 1769, there are\r\nregistered 132 cases; for 1770, 94 cases; for 1771, 102 cases; for\r\n1772, 43 cases; for 1773, 7 cases; and for 1774, none.[90]\r\n\r\nThe character of the professional work done by him during this period\r\ndeserves a moment's consideration. Prior to 1769, he had limited\r\nhimself to practice in the courts of the several counties. In that\r\nyear he began to practice in the general court,--the highest court in\r\nthe colony,--where of course were tried the most important and\r\ndifficult causes, and where thenceforward he had constantly to\r\nencounter the most learned and acute lawyers at the bar, including\r\nsuch men as Pendleton, Wythe, Blair, Mercer, John Randolph, Thompson\r\nMason, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert C. Nicholas.[91]\r\n\r\nThere could never have been any doubt of his supreme competency to\r\ndeal with such criminal causes as he had to manage in that court or in\r\nany other; and with respect to the conduct of other than criminal\r\ncauses, all purely contemporaneous evidence, now to be had, implies\r\nthat he had not ventured to present himself before the higher\r\ntribunals of the land until he had qualified himself to bear his part\r\nthere with success and honor. Thus, the instance may be mentioned of\r\nhis appearing in the Court of Admiralty, \"in behalf of a Spanish\r\ncaptain, whose vessel and cargo had been libeled. A gentleman who was\r\npresent, and who was very well qualified to judge, was heard to\r\ndeclare, after the trial was over, that he never heard a more eloquent\r\nor argumentative speech in his life; that Mr. Henry was on that\r\noccasion greatly superior to Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Mason, or any other\r\ncounsel who spoke to the subject; and that he was astonished how Mr.\r\nHenry could have acquired such a knowledge of the maritime law, to\r\nwhich it was believed he had never before turned his attention.\"[92]\r\nMoreover, in 1771, just two years from the time when Patrick Henry\r\nbegan practice in the General Court, Robert C. Nicholas, then a\r\nveteran member of the profession, \"who had enjoyed the first practice\r\nat the bar,\" had occasion to retire, and began looking about among the\r\nyounger men for some competent lawyer to whom he might safely intrust\r\nthe unfinished business of his clients. He first offered his practice\r\nto Thomas Jefferson, who, however, was compelled to decline it.\r\nAfterward, he offered it to Patrick Henry, who accepted it; and\r\naccordingly, by public advertisement, Nicholas informed his clients\r\nthat he had committed to Patrick Henry the further protection of their\r\ninterests,[93]--a perfectly conclusive proof, it should seem, of the\r\nreal respect in which Patrick Henry's qualifications as a lawyer were\r\nthen held, not only by the public but by the profession. Certainly\r\nsuch evidence as this can hardly be set aside by the supposed\r\nrecollections of one old gentleman, of broken memory and unbroken\r\nresentment, who long afterward tried to convince Wirt that, even at\r\nthe period now in question, Patrick Henry was \"wofully deficient as a\r\nlawyer,\" was unable to contend with his associates \"on a mere question\r\nof law,\" and was \"so little acquainted with the fundamental principles\r\nof his profession ... as not to be able to see the remote bearings of\r\nthe reported cases.\"[94] The expressions here quoted are, apparently,\r\nWirt's own paraphrase of the statements which were made to him by\r\nJefferson, and which, in many of their details, can now be proved, on\r\ndocumentary evidence, to be the work of a hand that had forgot, not\r\nindeed its cunning, but at any rate its accuracy.\r\n\r\nAs to the political history of Patrick Henry during this period, it\r\nmay be easily described. The doctrine on which he had planted himself\r\nby his resolutions in 1765, namely, that the parliamentary taxation of\r\nunrepresented colonies is unconstitutional, became the avowed doctrine\r\nof Virginia, and of all her sister colonies; and nearly all the men\r\nwho, in the House of Burgesses, had, for reasons of propriety, or of\r\nexpediency, or of personal feeling, opposed the passage of his\r\nresolutions, soon took pains to make it known to their constituents\r\nthat their opposition had not been to the principle which those\r\nresolutions expressed. Thenceforward, among the leaders in Virginian\r\npolitics, there was no real disagreement on the fundamental question;\r\nonly such disagreement touching methods as must always occur between\r\nspirits who are cautious and spirits who are bold. Chief among the\r\nformer were Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, Peyton Randolph, and Nicholas. In\r\nthe van of the latter always stood Patrick Henry, and with him\r\nJefferson, Richard Henry Lee, the Pages, and George Mason. But between\r\nthe two groups, after all, was surprising harmony, which is thus\r\nexplained by one who in all that business had a great part and who\r\nnever was a laggard:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sensible, however, of the importance of unanimity among\r\n     our constituents, although we often wished to have gone\r\n     faster, we slackened our pace, that our less ardent\r\n     colleagues might keep up with us; and they, on their part,\r\n     differing nothing from us in principle, quickened their gait\r\n     somewhat beyond that which their prudence might of itself\r\n     have advised, and thus consolidated the phalanx which\r\n     breasted the power of Britain. By this harmony of the bold\r\n     with the cautious, we advanced with our constituents in\r\n     undivided mass, and with fewer examples of separation than,\r\n     perhaps, existed in any other part of the union.\"[95]\r\n\r\nAll deprecated a quarrel with Great Britain; all deprecated as a\r\nboundless calamity the possible issue of independence; all desired to\r\nremain in loyal, free, and honorable connection with the British\r\nempire; and against the impending danger of an assault upon the\r\nfreedom, and consequently the honor, of this connection, all stood on\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nOne result, however, of this practical unanimity among the leaders in\r\nVirginia was the absence, during all this period, of those impassioned\r\nand dramatic conflicts in debate, which would have called forth\r\nhistoric exhibitions of Patrick Henry's eloquence and of his gifts for\r\nconduct and command. He had a leading part in all the counsels of the\r\ntime; he was sent to every session of the House of Burgesses; he was\r\nat the front in all local committees and conventions; he was made a\r\nmember of the first Committee of Correspondence; and all these\r\nincidents in this portion of his life culminated in his mission as one\r\nof the deputies from Virginia to the first Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nWithout here going into the familiar story of the occasion and\r\npurposes of the Congress of 1774, we may briefly indicate Patrick\r\nHenry's relation to the events in Virginia which immediately preceded\r\nhis appointment to that renowned assemblage. On the 24th of May, 1774,\r\nthe House of Burgesses, having received the alarming news of the\r\npassage of the Boston Port Bill, designated the day on which that bill\r\nwas to take effect--the first day of June--\"as a day of fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer, devoutly to implore the Divine interposition\r\nfor averting the heavy calamity which threatens destruction to our\r\ncivil rights, and the evils of civil war; to give us one heart and one\r\nmind firmly to oppose, by all just and proper means, every injury to\r\nAmerican rights; and that the minds of his majesty and his parliament\r\nmay be inspired from above with wisdom, moderation, and justice, to\r\nremove from the loyal people of America all cause of danger, from a\r\ncontinued pursuit of measures pregnant with their ruin.\"[96] Two days\r\nafterward, the governor, Lord Dunmore, having summoned the House to\r\nthe council chamber, made to them this little speech:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, I have\r\n     in my hand a paper published by order of your House,\r\n     conceived in such terms as reflect highly upon his majesty\r\n     and the Parliament of Great Britain, which makes it\r\n     necessary for me to dissolve you, and you are dissolved\r\n     accordingly.\"[97]\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock on the following day, May 27, the members of the late\r\nHouse met by agreement at the Raleigh Tavern, and there promptly\r\npassed a nobly-worded resolution, deploring the policy pursued by\r\nParliament and suggesting the establishment of an annual congress of\r\nall the colonies, \"to deliberate on those general measures which the\r\nunited interests of America may from time to time require.\"[98]\r\n\r\nDuring the anxious days and nights immediately preceding the\r\ndissolution of the House, its prominent members held many private\r\nconferences with respect to the course to be pursued by Virginia. In\r\nall these conferences, as we are told, \"Patrick Henry was the\r\nleader;\"[99] and a very able man, George Mason, who was just then a\r\nvisitor at Williamsburg, and was admitted to the consultations of the\r\nchiefs, wrote at the time concerning him: \"He is by far the most\r\npowerful speaker I ever heard.... But his eloquence is the smallest\r\npart of his merit. He is, in my opinion, the first man upon this\r\ncontinent, as well in abilities as public virtues.\"[100]\r\n\r\nIn response to a recommendation made by leading members of the recent\r\nHouse of Burgesses, a convention of delegates from the several\r\ncounties of Virginia assembled at Williamsburg, on August 1, 1774, to\r\ndeal with the needs of the hour, and especially to appoint deputies to\r\nthe proposed congress at Philadelphia. The spirit in which this\r\nconvention transacted its business is sufficiently shown in the\r\nopening paragraphs of the letter of instructions which it gave to the\r\ndeputies whom it sent to the congress:--\r\n\r\n     \"The unhappy disputes between Great Britain and her American\r\n     colonies, which began about the third year of the reign of\r\n     his present majesty, and since, continually increasing, have\r\n     proceeded to lengths so dangerous and alarming as to excite\r\n     just apprehensions in the minds of his majesty's faithful\r\n     subjects of this colony that they are in danger of being\r\n     deprived of their natural, ancient, constitutional, and\r\n     chartered rights, have compelled them to take the same into\r\n     their most serious consideration; and being deprived of\r\n     their usual and accustomed mode of making known their\r\n     grievances, have appointed us their representatives, to\r\n     consider what is proper to be done in this dangerous crisis\r\n     of American affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"It being our opinion that the united wisdom of North\r\n     America should be collected in a general congress of all the\r\n     colonies, we have appointed the honorable Peyton Randolph,\r\n     Esquire, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Patrick\r\n     Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison, and Edmund\r\n     Pendleton, Esquires, deputies to represent this colony in\r\n     the said congress, to be held at Philadelphia on the first\r\n     Monday in September next. And that they may be the better\r\n     informed of our sentiments touching the conduct we wish them\r\n     to observe on this important occasion, we desire that they\r\n     will express, in the first place, our faith and true\r\n     allegiance to his majesty King George the Third, our lawful\r\n     and rightful sovereign; and that we are determined, with our\r\n     lives and fortunes, to support him in the legal exercise of\r\n     all his just rights and prerogatives; and however\r\n     misrepresented, we sincerely approve of a constitutional\r\n     connection with Great Britain, and wish most ardently a\r\n     return of that intercourse of affection and commercial\r\n     connection that formerly united both countries; which can\r\n     only be effected by a removal of those causes of discontent\r\n     which have of late unhappily divided us.... The power\r\n     assumed by the British Parliament to bind America by their\r\n     statutes, in all cases whatsoever, is unconstitutional, and\r\n     the source of these unhappy differences.\"[101]\r\n\r\nThe convention at Williamsburg, of which, of course, Patrick Henry was\r\na member, seems to have adjourned on Saturday, the 6th of August.\r\nBetween that date and the time for his departure to attend the\r\ncongress at Philadelphia, we may imagine him as busily engaged in\r\narranging his affairs for a long absence from home, and even then as\r\nnot getting ready to begin the long journey until many of his\r\nassociates had nearly reached the end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] MS.\r\n\r\n[91] Wirt, 70, 71.\r\n\r\n[92] Wirt, 71, 72.\r\n\r\n[93] Randall, _Life of Jefferson_, i. 49; Wirt, 77.\r\n\r\n[94] Wirt, 71.\r\n\r\n[95] Jefferson's _Works_, vi. 368.\r\n\r\n[96] 4 _Am.

Vernon, the home of his friend and colleague,\r\nGeorge Washington; and having remained there that day and night, he\r\nset out for Philadelphia on the following morning, in the company of\r\nWashington and of Edmund Pendleton. From the jottings in Washington's\r\ndiary,[102] we can so far trace the progress of this trio of\r\nillustrious horsemen, as to ascertain that on Sunday, the 4th of\r\nSeptember, they \"breakfasted at Christiana Ferry; dined at Chester;\"\r\nand reached Philadelphia for supper--thus arriving in town barely in\r\ntime to be present at the first meeting of the Congress on the morning\r\nof the 5th.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams had taken pains to get upon the ground nearly a week\r\nearlier; and carefully gathering all possible information concerning\r\nhis future associates, few of whom he had then ever seen, he wrote in\r\nhis diary that the Virginians were said to \"speak in raptures about\r\nRichard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry, one the Cicero, and the other the\r\nDemosthenes, of the age.\"[103]\r\n\r\nNot far from the same time, also, a keen-witted Virginian, Roger\r\nAtkinson, at his home near Petersburg, was writing to a friend about\r\nthe men who had gone to represent Virginia in the great Congress; and\r\nthis letter of his, though not meant for posterity, has some neat,\r\noff-hand portraits which posterity may, nevertheless, be glad to look\r\nat. Peyton Randolph is \"a venerable man ... an honest man; has\r\nknowledge, temper, experience, judgment,--above all, integrity; a true\r\nRoman spirit.\" Richard Bland is \"a wary, old, experienced veteran at\r\nthe bar and in the senate; has something of the look of old musty\r\nparchments, which he handleth and studieth much. He formerly wrote a\r\ntreatise against the Quakers on water-baptism.\" Washington \"is a\r\nsoldier,--a warrior; he is a modest man; sensible; speaks little; in\r\naction cool, like a bishop at his prayers.\" Pendleton \"is an humble\r\nand religious man, and must be exalted. He is a smooth-tongued\r\nspeaker, and, though not so old, may be compared to old Nestor,--\r\n\r\n  'Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skilled,\r\n  Words sweet as honey from his lips distilled.'\"\r\n\r\nBut Patrick Henry \"is a real half-Quaker,--your brother's\r\nman,--moderate and mild, and in religious matters a saint; but the\r\nvery devil in politics; a son of thunder. He will shake the Senate.\r\nSome years ago he had liked to have talked treason into the\r\nHouse.\"[104]\r\n\r\nFew of the members of this Congress had ever met before; and if all\r\nhad arrived upon the scene as late as did these three members from\r\nVirginia, there might have been some difficulty, through a lack of\r\nprevious consultation and acquaintance, in organizing the Congress on\r\nthe day appointed, and in entering at once upon its business. In fact,\r\nhowever, more than a week before the time for the first meeting, the\r\ndelegates had begun to make their appearance in Philadelphia;\r\nthenceforward with each day the arrivals continued; by Thursday, the\r\n1st of September, twenty-five delegates, nearly one half of the entire\r\nbody elected, were in town;[105] and probably, during all that week,\r\nno day and no night had passed without many an informal conference\r\nrespecting the business before them, and the best way of doing it.\r\n\r\nConcerning these memorable men of the first Continental Congress, it\r\nmust be confessed that as the mists of a hundred years of glorifying\r\noratory and of semi-poetic history have settled down upon them, they\r\nare now enveloped in a light which seems to distend their forms to\r\nproportions almost superhuman, and to cast upon their faces a gravity\r\nthat hardly belongs to this world; and it may, perhaps, help us to\r\nbring them and their work somewhat nearer to the plane of natural\r\nhuman life and motive, and into a light that is as the light of\r\nreality, if, turning to the daily memoranda made at the time by one of\r\ntheir number, we can see how merrily, after all, nay, with what\r\nflowing feasts, with what convivial communings, passed those days and\r\nnights of preparation for the difficult business they were about to\r\ntake in hand.\r\n\r\nFor example, on Monday, the 29th of August, when the four members of\r\nthe Massachusetts delegation had arrived within five miles of the\r\ncity, they were met by an escort of gentlemen, partly residents of\r\nPhiladelphia, and partly delegates from other colonies, who had come\r\nout in carriages to greet them.\r\n\r\n     \"We were introduced,\" writes John Adams, \"to all these\r\n     gentlemen, and most cordially welcomed to Philadelphia. We\r\n     then rode into town, and dirty, dusty, and fatigued as we\r\n     were, we could not resist the importunity to go to the\r\n     tavern, the most genteel one in America. There we were\r\n     introduced to a number of other gentlemen of the city, ...\r\n     and to Mr. Lynch and Mr. Gadsden, of South Carolina. Here we\r\n     had a fresh welcome to the city of Philadelphia; and after\r\n     some time spent in conversation, a curtain was drawn, and in\r\n     the other half of the chamber a supper appeared as elegant\r\n     as ever was laid upon a table. About eleven o'clock we\r\n     retired.\r\n\r\n     \"30, Tuesday. Walked a little about town; visited the\r\n     market, the State House, the Carpenters' Hall, where the\r\n     Congress is to sit, etc.; then called at Mr. Mifflin's, a\r\n     grand, spacious, and elegant house. Here we had much\r\n     conversation with Mr. Charles Thomson, who is ... the Sam\r\n     Adams of Philadelphia, the life of the cause of liberty,\r\n     they say. A Friend, Collins, came to see us, and invited us\r\n     to dine on Thursday. We returned to our lodgings, and Mr.\r\n     Lynch, Mr. Gadsden, Mr. Middleton, and young Mr. Rutledge\r\n     came to visit us.\r\n\r\n     \"31, Wednesday. Breakfasted at Mr. Bayard's, of\r\n     Philadelphia, with Mr. Sprout, a Presbyterian minister. Made\r\n     a visit to Governor Ward of Rhode Island, at his lodgings.\r\n     There we were introduced to several gentlemen. Mr.\r\n     Dickinson, the Farmer of Pennsylvania, came in his coach\r\n     with four beautiful horses to Mr. Ward's lodgings, to see\r\n     us.... We dined with Mr. Lynch, his lady and daughter, at\r\n     their lodgings, ... and a very agreeable dinner and\r\n     afternoon we had, notwithstanding the violent heat. We were\r\n     all vastly pleased with Mr. Lynch. He is a solid, firm,\r\n     judicious man.\r\n\r\n     \"September 1, Thursday. This day we breakfasted at Mr.\r\n     Mifflin's. Mr. C. Thomson came in, and soon after Dr. Smith,\r\n     the famous Dr. Smith, the provost of the college.... We then\r\n     went to return visits to the gentlemen who had visited us.\r\n     We visited a Mr. Cadwallader, a gentleman of large fortune,\r\n     a grand and elegant house and furniture. We then visited Mr.\r\n     Powell, another splendid seat. We then visited the gentlemen\r\n     from South Carolina, and, about twelve, were introduced to\r\n     Mr. Galloway, the speaker of the House in Pennsylvania. We\r\n     dined at Friend Collins' ... with Governor Hopkins, Governor\r\n     Ward, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Rhoades, etc. In the evening all the\r\n     gentlemen of the Congress who were arrived in town, met at\r\n     Smith's, the new city tavern, and spent the evening\r\n     together. Twenty-five members were come. Virginia, North\r\n     Carolina, Maryland, and the city of New York were not\r\n     arrived.\r\n\r\n     \"2, Friday. Dined at Mr. Thomas Mifflin's with Mr. Lynch,\r\n     Mr. Middleton, and the two Rutledges with their ladies....\r\n     We were very sociable and happy. After coffee we went to the\r\n     tavern, where we were introduced to Peyton Randolph,\r\n     Esquire, speaker of Virginia, Colonel Harrison, Richard\r\n     Henry Lee, Esquire, and Colonel Bland.... These gentlemen\r\n     from Virginia appear to be the most spirited and consistent\r\n     of any. Harrison said he would have come on foot rather than\r\n     not come. Bland said he would have gone, upon this occasion,\r\n     if it had been to Jericho.\r\n\r\n     \"3, Saturday. Breakfasted at Dr. Shippen's; Dr. Witherspoon\r\n     was there. Col. R. H. Lee lodges there; he is a masterly\r\n     man.... We went with Mr. William Barrell to his store, and\r\n     drank punch, and ate dried smoked sprats with him; read the\r\n     papers and our letters from Boston; dined with Mr. Joseph\r\n     Reed, the lawyer; ... spent the evening at Mr. Mifflin's,\r\n     with Lee and Harrison from Virginia, the two Rutledges, Dr.\r\n     Witherspoon, Dr. Shippen, Dr. Steptoe, and another\r\n     gentleman; an elegant supper, and we drank sentiments till\r\n     eleven o'clock. Lee and Harrison were very high. Lee had\r\n     dined with Mr. Dickinson, and drank Burgundy the whole\r\n     afternoon.\"[106]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at 10 o'clock on Monday morning, the 5th of September,\r\nwhen the delegates assembled at their rendezvous, the city tavern, and\r\nmarched together through the streets to Carpenters' Hall, for most of\r\nthem the stiffness of a first introduction was already broken, and\r\nthey could greet one another that morning with something of the\r\nfreedom and good fellowship of boon companions. Moreover, they were\r\nthen ready to proceed to business under the advantage of having\r\narranged beforehand an outline of what was first to be done. It had\r\nbeen discovered, apparently, that the first serious question which\r\nwould meet them after their formal organization, was one relating to\r\nthe method of voting in the Congress, namely, whether each deputy\r\nshould have a vote, or only each colony; and if the latter, whether\r\nthe vote of each colony should be proportioned to its population and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the hall, and inspected it, and agreed that it would\r\nserve the purpose, the delegates helped themselves to seats. Then Mr.\r\nLynch of South Carolina arose, and nominated Mr. Peyton Randolph of\r\nVirginia for president. This nomination having been unanimously\r\nadopted, Mr. Lynch likewise proposed Mr. Charles Thomson for\r\nsecretary, which was carried without opposition; but as Mr. Thomson\r\nwas not a delegate, and of course was not then present, the doorkeeper\r\nwas instructed to go out and find him, and say to him that his\r\nimmediate attendance was desired by the Congress.\r\n\r\nNext came the production and inspection of credentials. The roll\r\nindicated that of the fifty-two delegates appointed, forty-four were\r\nalready upon the ground,--constituting an assemblage of representative\r\nAmericans, which, for dignity of character and for intellectual\r\neminence, was undoubtedly the most imposing that the colonies had ever\r\nseen. In that room that day were such men as John Sullivan, John and\r\nSamuel Adams, Stephen Hopkins, Roger Sherman, James Duane, John Jay,\r\nPhilip and William Livingston, Joseph Galloway, Thomas Mifflin, Cæsar\r\nRodney, Thomas McKean, George Read, Samuel Chase, John and Edward\r\nRutledge, Christopher Gadsden, Henry Middleton, Edmund Pendleton,\r\nGeorge Washington, and Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\nHaving thus got through with the mere routine of organization, which\r\nmust have taken a considerable time, James Duane, of New York, moved\r\nthe appointment of a committee \"to prepare regulations for this\r\nCongress.\" To this several gentlemen objected; whereupon John Adams,\r\nthinking that Duane's purpose might have been misunderstood, \"asked\r\nleave of the president to request of the gentleman from New York an\r\nexplanation, and that he would point out some particular regulations\r\nwhich he had in his mind.\" In reply to this request, Duane \"mentioned\r\nparticularly the method of voting, whether it should be by colonies,\r\nor by the poll, or by interests.\"[107] Thus Duane laid his finger on\r\nperhaps the most sensitive nerve in that assemblage; but as he sat\r\ndown, the discussion of the subject which he had mentioned was\r\ninterrupted by a rather curious incident. This was the return of the\r\ndoorkeeper, having under his escort Mr. Charles Thomson. The latter\r\nwalked up the aisle, and standing opposite to the president, said,\r\nwith a bow, that he awaited his pleasure. The president replied:\r\n\"Congress desire the favor of you, sir, to take their minutes.\"\r\nWithout a word, only bowing his acquiescence, the secretary took his\r\nseat at his desk, and began those modest but invaluable services from\r\nwhich he did not cease until the Congress of the Confederation was\r\nmerged into that of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe discussion, into which this incident had fallen as a momentary\r\nepisode, was then resumed. \"After a short silence,\" says the man who\r\nwas thus inducted into office, \"Patrick Henry arose to speak. I did\r\nnot then know him. He was dressed in a suit of parson's gray, and from\r\nhis appearance I took him for a Presbyterian clergyman, used to\r\nharanguing the people. He observed that we were here met in a time and\r\non an occasion of great difficulty and distress; that our public\r\ncircumstances were like those of a man in deep embarrassment and\r\ntrouble, who had called his friends together to devise what was best\r\nto be done for his relief;--one would propose one thing, and another a\r\ndifferent one, whilst perhaps a third would think of something better\r\nsuited to his unhappy circumstances, which he would embrace, and think\r\nno more of the rejected schemes with which he would have nothing to\r\ndo.\"[108]\r\n\r\nSuch is the rather meagre account, as given by one ear-witness, of\r\nPatrick Henry's first speech in the Congress of 1774. From another\r\near-witness we have another account, likewise very meagre, but giving,\r\nprobably, a somewhat more adequate idea of the drift and point of what\r\nhe said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Henry then arose, and said this was the first general\r\n     congress which had ever happened; that no former congress\r\n     could be a precedent; that we should have occasion for more\r\n     general congresses, and therefore that a precedent ought to\r\n     be established now; that it would be a great injustice if a\r\n     little colony should have the same weight in the councils of\r\n     America as a great one; and therefore he was for a\r\n     committee.\"[109]\r\n\r\nThe notable thing about both these accounts is that they agree in\r\nshowing Patrick Henry's first speech in Congress to have been not, as\r\nhas been represented, an impassioned portrayal of \"general\r\ngrievances,\" but a plain and quiet handling of a mere \"detail of\r\nbusiness.\" In the discussion he was followed by John Sullivan, who\r\nmerely observed that \"a little colony had its all at stake as well as\r\na great one.\" The floor was then taken by John Adams, who seems to\r\nhave made a searching and vigorous argument,--exhibiting the great\r\ndifficulties attending any possible conclusion to which they might\r\ncome respecting the method of voting. At the end of his speech,\r\napparently, the House adjourned, to resume the consideration of the\r\nsubject on the following day.[110]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on Tuesday morning the discussion was continued, and at\r\nfar greater length than on the previous day; the first speaker being\r\nPatrick Henry himself, who seems now to have gone into the subject far\r\nmore broadly, and with much greater intensity of thought, than in his\r\nfirst speech.\r\n\r\n     \"'Government,' said he, 'is dissolved. Fleets and armies and\r\n     the present state of things show that government is\r\n     dissolved. Where are your landmarks, your boundaries of\r\n     colonies? We are in a state of nature, sir. I did propose\r\n     that a scale should be laid down; that part of North America\r\n     which was once Massachusetts Bay, and that part which was\r\n     once Virginia, ought to be considered as having a weight.\r\n     Will not people complain,--\"Ten thousand Virginians have not\r\n     outweighed one thousand others?\"\r\n\r\n     \"'I will submit, however; I am determined to submit, if I am\r\n     overruled.\r\n\r\n     \"'A worthy gentleman near me [John Adams] seemed to admit\r\n     the necessity of obtaining a more adequate representation.\r\n\r\n     \"'I hope future ages will quote our proceedings with\r\n     applause. It is one of the great duties of the democratical\r\n     part of the constitution to keep itself pure. It is known in\r\n     my province that some other colonies are not so numerous or\r\n     rich as they are. I am for giving all the satisfaction in my\r\n     power.\r\n\r\n     \"'The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New\r\n     Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a\r\n     Virginian, but an American.\r\n\r\n     \"'Slaves are to be thrown out of the question; and if the\r\n     freemen can be represented according to their numbers, I am\r\n     satisfied.'\r\n\r\n     \"The subject was then debated at length by Lynch, Rutledge,\r\n     Ward, Richard Henry Lee, Gadsden, Bland, and Pendleton, when\r\n     Patrick Henry again rose:--\r\n\r\n     \"'I agree that authentic accounts cannot be had, if by\r\n     authenticity is meant attestations of officers of the crown.\r\n     I go upon the supposition that government is at an end. All\r\n     distinctions are thrown down. All America is thrown into one\r\n     mass. We must aim at the minutiæ of rectitude.'\"\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry was then followed by John Jay, who seems to have closed\r\nthe debate, and whose allusion to what his immediate predecessor had\r\nsaid gives us some hint of the variations in Revolutionary opinion\r\nthen prevailing among the members, as well as of the advanced position\r\nalways taken by Patrick Henry:--\r\n\r\n     \"'Could I suppose that we came to frame an American\r\n     constitution, instead of endeavoring to correct the faults\r\n     in an old one, I can't yet think that all government is at\r\n     an end. The measure of arbitrary power is not full; and I\r\n     think it must run over, before we undertake to frame a new\r\n     constitution. To the virtue, spirit, and abilities of\r\n     Virginia we owe much. I should always, therefore, from\r\n     inclination as well as justice, be for giving Virginia its\r\n     full weight. I am not clear that we ought not to be bound by\r\n     a majority, though ever so small; but I only mentioned it as\r\n     a matter of danger worthy of consideration.'\"[111]\r\n\r\nOf this entire debate, the most significant issue is indicated by the\r\nfollowing passage from the journal for Tuesday, the 6th of\r\nSeptember:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, that in determining questions in this Congress,\r\n     each colony or province shall have one vote; the Congress\r\n     not being possessed of, or at present able to procure,\r\n     proper materials for ascertaining the importance of each\r\n     colony.\"[112]\r\n\r\nSo far as it is now possible to ascertain it, such was Patrick Henry's\r\npart in the first discussion held by the first Continental\r\nCongress,--a discussion occupying parts of two days, and relating\r\npurely to methods of procedure by that body, and not to the matters of\r\ngrievance between the colonies and Great Britain. We have a right to\r\ninfer something as to the quality of the first impression made upon\r\nhis associates by Patrick Henry in consequence of his three speeches\r\nin this discussion, from the fact that when, at the close of it, an\r\norder was taken for the appointment of two grand committees, one \"to\r\nstate the rights of the colonies,\" the other \"to examine and report\r\nthe several statutes which affect the trade and manufactures of the\r\ncolonies,\" Patrick Henry was chosen to represent Virginia on the\r\nlatter committee,[113]--a position not likely to have been selected\r\nfor a man who, however eloquent he may have seemed, had not also shown\r\nbusiness-like and lawyer-like qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Congress kept steadily at work from Monday, the 5th of September,\r\nto Wednesday, the 26th of October,--just seven weeks and two days.\r\nThough not a legislative body, it resembled all legislative bodies\r\nthen in existence, in the fact that it sat with closed doors, and that\r\nit gave to the public only such results as it chose to give. Upon the\r\ndifficult and exciting subjects which came before it, there were, very\r\nlikely, many splendid passages of debate; and we cannot doubt that in\r\nall these discussions Patrick Henry took his usually conspicuous and\r\npowerful share. Yet no official record was kept of what was said by\r\nany member; and it is only from the hurried private memoranda of two\r\nof his colleagues that we are able to learn anything more respecting\r\nPatrick Henry's participation in the debates of those seven weeks.\r\n\r\nFor example, just two weeks after the opening of this Congress, one of\r\nits most critical members, Silas Deane of Connecticut, in a letter to\r\nhis wife, gave some capital sketches of his more prominent associates\r\nthere, especially those from the South,--as Randolph, Harrison,\r\nWashington, Pendleton, Richard Henry Lee, and Patrick Henry. The\r\nlatter he describes as \"a lawyer, and the completest speaker I ever\r\nheard. If his future speeches are equal to the small samples he has\r\nhitherto given us, they will be worth preserving; but in a letter I\r\ncan give you no idea of the music of his voice, or the high-wrought\r\nyet natural elegance of his style and manner.\"[114]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 28th of September that Joseph Galloway brought forward\r\nhis celebrated plan for a permanent reconciliation between Great\r\nBritain and her colonies. This was simply a scheme for what we should\r\nnow call home rule, on a basis of colonial confederation, with an\r\nAmerican parliament to be elected every three years by the\r\nlegislatures of the several colonies, and with a governor-general to\r\nbe appointed by the crown. The plan came very near to adoption.[115]\r\nThe member who introduced it was a man of great ability and great\r\ninfluence; it was supported by James Duane and John Jay; it was\r\npronounced by Edward Rutledge to be \"almost a perfect plan;\" and in\r\nthe final trial it was lost only by a vote of six colonies to five.\r\nCould it have been adopted, the disruption of the British empire would\r\ncertainly have been averted for that epoch, and, as an act of\r\nviolence and of unkindness, would perhaps have been averted forever;\r\nwhile the thirteen English colonies would have remained English\r\ncolonies, without ceasing to be free.\r\n\r\nThe plan, however, was distrusted and resisted, with stern and\r\nimplacable hostility, by the more radical members of the Congress,\r\nparticularly by those from Massachusetts and Virginia; and an outline\r\nof what Patrick Henry said in his assault upon it, delivered on the\r\nvery day on which it was introduced, is thus given by John Adams:--\r\n\r\n     \"The original constitution of the colonies was founded on\r\n     the broadest and most generous base. The regulation of our\r\n     trade was compensation enough for all the protection we ever\r\n     experienced from her.\r\n\r\n     \"We shall liberate our constituents from a corrupt House of\r\n     Commons, but throw them into the arms of an American\r\n     legislature, that may be bribed by that nation which avows,\r\n     in the face of the world, that bribery is a part of her\r\n     system of government.\r\n\r\n     \"Before we are obliged to pay taxes as they do, let us be as\r\n     free as they; let us have our trade open with all the world.\r\n\r\n     \"We are not to consent by the representatives of\r\n     representatives.\r\n\r\n     \"I am inclined to think the present measures lead to\r\n     war.\"[116]\r\n\r\nThe only other trace to be discovered of Patrick Henry's activity in\r\nthe debates of this Congress belongs to the day just before the one\r\non which Galloway's plan was introduced. The subject then under\r\ndiscussion was the measure for non-importation and non-exportation. On\r\nconsiderations of forbearance, Henry tried to have the date for the\r\napplication of this measure postponed from November to December,\r\nsaying, characteristically, \"We don't mean to hurt even our rascals,\r\nif we have any.\"[117]\r\n\r\nProbably the most notable work done by this Congress was its\r\npreparation of those masterly state papers in which it interpreted and\r\naffirmed the constitutional attitude of the colonies, and which, when\r\nlaid upon the table of the House of Lords, drew forth the splendid\r\nencomium of Chatham.[118] In many respects the most important, and\r\ncertainly the most difficult, of these state papers, was the address\r\nto the king. The motion for such an address was made on the 1st of\r\nOctober. On the same day the preparation of it was entrusted to a very\r\nable committee, consisting of Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, Thomas\r\nJohnson, Patrick Henry, and John Rutledge; and on the 21st of October\r\nthe committee was strengthened by the accession of John Dickinson, who\r\nhad entered the Congress but four days before.[119] Precisely what\r\npart Patrick Henry took in the preparation of this address is not now\r\nknown; but there is no evidence whatever for the assertion[120] that\r\nthe first draft, which, when submitted to Congress, proved to be\r\nunsatisfactory, was the work of Patrick Henry. That draft, as is now\r\nabundantly proved, was prepared by the chairman of the committee,\r\nRichard Henry Lee, but after full instructions from Congress and from\r\nthe committee itself.[121] In its final form, the address was largely\r\nmoulded by the expert and gentle hand of John Dickinson.[122] No one\r\ncan doubt, however, that even though Patrick Henry may have\r\ncontributed nothing to the literary execution of this fine address, he\r\nwas not inactive in its construction,[123] and that he was not likely\r\nto have suggested any abatement from its free and manly spirit.\r\n\r\nThe only other committee on which he is known to have served during\r\nthis Congress was one to which his name was added on the 19th of\r\nSeptember,--\"the committee appointed to state the rights of the\r\ncolonies,\"[124] an object, certainly, far better suited to the\r\npeculiarities of his talents and of his temper than that of the\r\ncommittee for the conciliation of a king.\r\n\r\nOf course, the one gift in which Patrick Henry excelled all other men\r\nof his time and neighborhood was the gift of eloquence; and it is not\r\nto be doubted that in many other forms of effort, involving, for\r\nexample, plain sense, practical experience, and knowledge of details,\r\nhe was often equaled, and perhaps even surpassed, by men who had not a\r\nparticle of his genius for oratory. This fact, the analogue of which\r\nis common in the history of all men of genius, seems to be the basis\r\nof an anecdote which, possibly, is authentic, and which, at any rate,\r\nhas been handed down by one who was always a devoted friend[125] of\r\nthe great orator. It is said that, after Henry and Lee had made their\r\nfirst speeches, Samuel Chase of Maryland was so impressed by their\r\nsuperiority that he walked over to the seat of one of his colleagues\r\nand said: \"We might as well go home; we are not able to legislate with\r\nthese men.\" But some days afterward, perhaps in the midst of the work\r\nof the committee on the statutes affecting trade and commerce, the\r\nsame member was able to relieve himself by the remark: \"Well, after\r\nall, I find these are but men, and, in mere matters of business, but\r\nvery common men.\"[126]\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly right to pass from these studies upon the first\r\nContinental Congress, and upon Patrick Henry's part in it, without\r\nsome reference to Wirt's treatment of the subject in a book which has\r\nnow been, for nearly three quarters of a century, the chief source of\r\npublic information concerning Patrick Henry. There is perhaps no other\r\nportion of this book which is less worthy of respect.[127] It is not\r\nonly unhistoric in nearly all the very few alleged facts of the\r\nnarrative, but it does great injustice to Patrick Henry by\r\nrepresenting him virtually as a mere declaimer, as an ill-instructed\r\nthough most impressive rhapsodist in debate, and as without any claim\r\nto the character of a serious statesman, or even of a man of affairs;\r\nwhile, by the somewhat grandiose and melodramatic tone of some portion\r\nof the narrative, it is singularly out of harmony with the real tone\r\nof that famous assemblage,--an assemblage of Anglo-Saxon lawyers,\r\npoliticians, and men of business, who were probably about as practical\r\nand sober-minded a company as had been got together for any manly\r\nundertaking since that of Runnymede.\r\n\r\nWirt begins by convening his Congress one day too soon, namely, on the\r\n4th of September, which was Sunday; and he represents the members as\r\n\"personally strangers\" to one another, and as sitting, after their\r\npreliminary organization, in a \"long and deep silence,\" the members\r\nmeanwhile looking around upon each other with a sort of helpless\r\nanxiety, \"every individual\" being reluctant \"to open a business so\r\nfearfully momentous.\" But\r\n\r\n     \"in the midst of this deep and death-like silence, and just\r\n     when it was beginning to become painfully embarrassing, Mr.\r\n     Henry arose slowly, as if borne down by the weight of the\r\n     subject. After faltering, according to his habit, through a\r\n     most impressive exordium, in which he merely echoed back the\r\n     consciousness of every other heart in deploring his\r\n     inability to do justice to the occasion, he launched\r\n     gradually into a recital of the colonial wrongs. Rising, as\r\n     he advanced, with the grandeur of his subject, and glowing\r\n     at length with all the majesty and expectation of the\r\n     occasion, his speech seemed more than that of mortal man.\r\n     Even those who had heard him in all his glory in the House\r\n     of Burgesses of Virginia were astonished at the manner in\r\n     which his talents seemed to swell and expand themselves to\r\n     fill the vaster theatre in which he was now placed. There\r\n     was no rant, no rhapsody, no labor of the understanding, no\r\n     straining of the voice, no confusion of the utterance. His\r\n     countenance was erect, his eye steady, his action noble, his\r\n     enunciation clear and firm, his mind poised on its centre,\r\n     his views of his subject comprehensive and great, and his\r\n     imagination coruscating with a magnificence and a variety\r\n     which struck even that assembly with amazement and awe. He\r\n     sat down amidst murmurs of astonishment and applause; and,\r\n     as he had been before proclaimed the greatest orator of\r\n     Virginia, he was now on every hand admitted to be the first\r\n     orator of America.\"[128]\r\n\r\nThis great speech from Patrick Henry, which certainly was not made on\r\nthat occasion, and probably was never made at all, Wirt causes to be\r\nfollowed by a great speech from Richard Henry Lee, although the\r\njournal could have informed him that Lee was not even in the House on\r\nthat day. Moreover, he makes Patrick Henry to be the author of the\r\nunfortunate first draft of the address to the king,--a document which\r\nwas written by another man; and on this fiction he founds two or three\r\npages of lamentation and of homily with reference to Patrick Henry's\r\ninability to express himself in writing, in consequence of \"his early\r\nneglect of literature.\" Finally, he thinks it due \"to historic truth\r\nto record that the superior powers\" of Patrick Henry \"were manifested\r\nonly in debate;\" and that, although he and Richard Henry Lee \"took the\r\nundisputed lead in the Assembly,\" \"during the first days of the\r\nsession, while general grievances were the topic,\" yet they were both\r\n\"completely thrown into the shade\" \"when called down from the heights\r\nof declamation to that severer test of intellectual excellence, the\r\ndetails of business,\"--the writer here seeming to forget that \"general\r\ngrievances\" were not the topic \"during the first days of the session,\"\r\nand that the very speeches by which these two men are said to have\r\nmade their mark there, were speeches on mere rules of the House\r\nrelating to methods of procedure.[129]\r\n\r\nSince the death of Wirt, and the publication of the biography of him\r\nby Kennedy, it has been possible for us to ascertain just how the\r\ngenial author of \"The Life and Character of Patrick Henry\" came to be\r\nso gravely misled in this part of his book. \"The whole passage\r\nrelative to the first Congress\" appears to have been composed from\r\ndata furnished by Jefferson, who, however, was not a member of that\r\nCongress; and in the original manuscript the very words of Jefferson\r\nwere surrounded with quotation marks, and were attributed to him by\r\nname. When, however, that great man, who loved not to send out\r\ncalumnies into the world with his own name attached to them, came to\r\ninspect this portion of Wirt's manuscript, he was moved by his usual\r\nprudence to write such a letter as drew from Wirt the following\r\nconsolatory assurance:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your repose shall never be endangered by any act of mine,\r\n     if I can help it. Immediately on the receipt of your last\r\n     letter, and before the manuscript had met any other eye, I\r\n     wrote over again the whole passage relative to the first\r\n     Congress, omitting the marks of quotation, and removing your\r\n     name altogether from the communication.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe final adjournment of the first Continental Congress, it will be\r\nremembered, did not occur until its members had spent together more\r\nthan seven weeks of the closest intellectual intimacy. Surely, no mere\r\ndeclaimer however enchanting, no sublime babbler on the rights of man,\r\nno political charlatan strutting about for the display of his\r\npreternatural gift of articulate wind, could have grappled in keen\r\ndebate, for all those weeks, on the greatest of earthly subjects, with\r\nfifty of the ablest men in America, without exposing to their view all\r\nhis own intellectual poverty, and without losing the very last shred\r\nof their intellectual respect for him. Whatever may have been the\r\nimpression formed of Patrick Henry as a mere orator by his associates\r\nin that Congress, nothing can be plainer than that those men carried\r\nwith them to their homes that report of him as a man of extraordinary\r\nintelligence, integrity, and power, which was the basis of his\r\nsubsequent fame for many years among the American people. Long\r\nafterward, John Adams, who formed his estimate of Patrick Henry\r\nchiefly from what he saw of him in that Congress, and who was never\r\nmuch addicted to bestowing eulogiums on any man but John Adams, wrote\r\nto Jefferson that \"in the Congress of 1774 there was not one member,\r\nexcept Patrick Henry, who appeared ... sensible of the precipice, or\r\nrather the pinnacle, on which we stood, and had candor and courage\r\nenough to acknowledge it.\"[131] To Wirt likewise, a few years later,\r\nthe same hard critic of men testified that Patrick Henry always\r\nimpressed him as a person \"of deep reflection, keen sagacity, clear\r\nforesight, daring enterprise, inflexible intrepidity, and untainted\r\nintegrity, with an ardent zeal for the liberties, the honor, and\r\nfelicity of his country and his species.\"[132]\r\n\r\nOf the parting interview between these two men, at the close of that\r\nfirst period of thorough personal acquaintance, there remains from the\r\nhand of one of them a graphic account that reveals to us something of\r\nthe conscious kinship which seems ever afterward to have bound\r\ntogether their robust and impetuous natures.\r\n\r\n     \"When Congress,\" says John Adams, \"had finished their\r\n     business, as they thought, in the autumn of 1774, I had with\r\n     Mr. Henry, before we took leave of each other, some familiar\r\n     conversation, in which I expressed a full conviction that\r\n     our resolves, declarations of rights, enumeration of wrongs,\r\n     petitions, remonstrances, and addresses, associations, and\r\n     non-importation agreements, however they might be expected\r\n     by the people in America, and however necessary to cement\r\n     the union of the colonies, would be but waste paper in\r\n     England. Mr. Henry said they might make some impression\r\n     among the people of England, but agreed with me that they\r\n     would be totally lost upon the government. I had but just\r\n     received a short and hasty letter, written to me by Major\r\n     Hawley, of Northampton, containing 'a few broken hints,' as\r\n     he called them, of what he thought was proper to be done,\r\n     and concluding[133] with these words: 'After all, we must\r\n     fight.' This letter I read to Mr. Henry, who listened with\r\n     great attention; and as soon as I had pronounced the words,\r\n     'After all, we must fight,' he raised his head, and with an\r\n     energy and vehemence that I can never forget, broke out\r\n     with: 'By God, I am of that man's mind!'\"[134]\r\n\r\nThis anecdote, it may be mentioned, contains the only instance on\r\nrecord, for any period of Patrick Henry's life, implying his use of\r\nwhat at first may seem a profane oath. John Adams, upon whose very\r\nfallible memory in old age the story rests, declares that he did not\r\nat the time regard Patrick Henry's words as an oath, but rather as a\r\nsolemn asseveration, affirmed religiously, upon a very great occasion.\r\nAt any rate, that asseveration proved to be a prophecy; for from it\r\nthere then leaped a flame that lighted up for an instant the next\r\ninevitable stage in the evolution of events,--the tragic and bloody\r\noutcome of all these wary lucubrations and devices of the assembled\r\npolitical wizards of America.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, at the very time when the Congress at\r\nPhiladelphia was busy with its stern work, the people of Virginia were\r\ngrappling with the peril of an Indian war assailing them from beyond\r\ntheir western mountains. There has recently been brought to light a\r\nletter written at Hanover, on the 15th of October, 1774, by the aged\r\nmother of Patrick Henry, to a friend living far out towards the\r\nexposed district; and this letter is a touching memorial both of the\r\ngeneral anxiety over the two concurrent events, and of the motherly\r\npride and piety of the writer:--\r\n\r\n     \"My son Patrick has been gone to Philadelphia near seven\r\n     weeks. The affairs of Congress are kept with great secrecy,\r\n     nobody being allowed to be present. I assure you we have our\r\n     lowland troubles and fears with respect to Great Britain.\r\n     Perhaps our good God may bring good to us out of these many\r\n     evils which threaten us, not only from the mountains but\r\n     from the seas.\"[135]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[102] _Washington's Writings_, ii. 503.\r\n\r\n[103] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 357.\r\n\r\n[104] Meade, _Old Churches and Families of Va._ i. 220, 221.\r\n\r\n[105] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 361.\r\n\r\n[106] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 357-364.\r\n\r\n[107] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 365.\r\n\r\n[108] _Am.

The old church at Richmond, in which he made this\r\nmarvelous speech, is in our time visited every year, as a patriotic\r\nshrine, by thousands of pilgrims, who seek curiously the very spot\r\nupon the floor where the orator is believed to have stood when he\r\nuttered those words of flame. It is chiefly the tradition of that one\r\nspeech which to-day keeps alive, in millions of American homes, the\r\nname of Patrick Henry, and which lifts him, in the popular faith,\r\nalmost to the rank of some mythical hero of romance.\r\n\r\nIn reality, that speech, and the resolutions in support of which that\r\nspeech was made, constituted Patrick Henry's individual declaration of\r\nwar against Great Britain. But the question is: To what extent, if\r\nany, was he therein original, or even in advance of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, and particularly of his associates in the Virginia\r\nconvention?\r\n\r\nIt is essential to a just understanding of the history of that crisis\r\nin revolutionary thought, and it is of very high importance, likewise,\r\nto the historic position of Patrick Henry, that no mistake be\r\ncommitted here; especially that he be not made the victim of a\r\ndisastrous reaction from any overstatement[136] respecting the precise\r\nnature and extent of the service then rendered by him to the cause of\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nWe need, therefore, to glance for a moment at the period between\r\nOctober, 1774, and March, 1775, with the purpose of tracing therein\r\nthe more important tokens of the growth of the popular conviction that\r\na war with Great Britain had become inevitable, and was to be\r\nimmediately prepared for by the several colonies,--two propositions\r\nwhich form the substance of all that Patrick Henry said on the great\r\noccasion now before us.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 21st of October, 1774, the first Continental\r\nCongress, after having suggested all possible methods for averting\r\nwar, made this solemn declaration to the people of the colonies: \"We\r\nthink ourselves bound in duty to observe to you that the schemes\r\nagitated against these colonies have been so conducted as to render it\r\nprudent that you should extend your views to mournful events, and be\r\nin all respects prepared for every emergency.\"[137] Just six days\r\nlater, John Dickinson, a most conservative and peace-loving member of\r\nthat Congress, wrote to an American friend in England: \"I wish for\r\npeace ardently; but must say, delightful as it is, it will come more\r\ngrateful by being unexpected. The first act of violence on the part of\r\nadministration in America, or the attempt to reinforce General Gage\r\nthis winter or next year, will put the whole continent in arms, from\r\nNova Scotia to Georgia.\"[138] On the following day, the same prudent\r\nstatesman wrote to another American friend, also in England: \"The most\r\npeaceful provinces are now animated; and a civil war is unavoidable,\r\nunless there be a quick change of British measures.\"[139] On the 29th\r\nof October, the eccentric Charles Lee, who was keenly watching the\r\nsymptoms of colonial discontent and resistance, wrote from\r\nPhiladelphia to an English nobleman: \"Virginia, Rhode Island, and\r\nCarolina are forming corps. Massachusetts Bay has long had a\r\nsufficient number instructed to become instructive of the rest. Even\r\nthis Quakering province is following the example.... In short, unless\r\nthe banditti at Westminster speedily undo everything they have done,\r\ntheir royal paymaster will hear of reviews and manoeuvres not quite so\r\nentertaining as those he is presented with in Hyde Park and Wimbledon\r\nCommon.\"[140] On the 1st of November, a gentleman in Maryland wrote to\r\na kinsman in Glasgow: \"The province of Virginia is raising one company\r\nin every county.... This province has taken the hint, and has begun to\r\nraise men in every county also; and to the northward they have large\r\nbodies, capable of acquitting themselves with honor in the\r\nfield.\"[141] At about the same time, the General Assembly of\r\nConnecticut ordered that every town should at once supply itself with\r\n\"double the quantity of powder, balls, and flints\" that had been\r\nhitherto required by law.[142] On the 5th of November, the officers of\r\nthe Virginia troops accompanying Lord Dunmore on his campaign against\r\nthe Indians held a meeting at Fort Gower, on the Ohio River, and\r\npassed this resolution: \"That we will exert every power within us for\r\nthe defence of American liberty, and for the support of her just\r\nrights and privileges, not in any precipitate, riotous, or tumultuous\r\nmanner, but when regularly called forth by the unanimous voice of our\r\ncountrymen.\"[143] Not far from the same time, the people of Rhode\r\nIsland carried off to Providence from the batteries at Newport\r\nforty-four pieces of cannon; and the governor frankly told the\r\ncommander of a British naval force near at hand that they had done\r\nthis in order to prevent these cannon from falling into his hands, and\r\nwith the purpose of using them against \"any power that might offer to\r\nmolest the colony.\"[144] Early in December, the Provincial Convention\r\nof Maryland recommended that all persons between sixteen and fifty\r\nyears of age should form themselves into military companies, and \"be\r\nin readiness to act on any emergency,\"--with a sort of grim humor\r\nprefacing their recommendation by this exquisite morsel of\r\nargumentative irony:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_ unanimously, that a well-regulated militia,\r\n     composed of the gentlemen freeholders and other freemen, is\r\n     the natural strength and only stable security of a free\r\n     government; and that such militia will relieve our mother\r\n     country from any expense in our protection and defence, will\r\n     obviate the pretence of a necessity for taxing us on that\r\n     account, and render it unnecessary to keep any standing\r\n     army--ever dangerous to liberty--in this province.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThe shrewdness of this courteous political thrust on the part of the\r\nconvention of Maryland seems to have been so heartily relished by\r\nothers that it was thenceforward used again and again by similar\r\nconventions elsewhere; and in fact, for the next few months, these\r\nsentences became almost the stereotyped formula by which revolutionary\r\nassemblages justified the arming and drilling of the militia,--as,\r\nfor example, that of Newcastle County, Delaware,[146] on the 21st of\r\nDecember; that of Fairfax County, Virginia,[147] on the 17th of\r\nJanuary, 1775; and that of Augusta County, Virginia,[148] on the 22d\r\nof February.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Lord Dunmore was not blind to all these military\r\npreparations in Virginia; and so early as the 24th of December, 1774,\r\nhe had written to the Earl of Dartmouth: \"Every county, besides, is\r\nnow arming a company of men, whom they call an independent company,\r\nfor the avowed purpose of protecting their committees, and to be\r\nemployed against government, if occasion require.\"[149] Moreover, this\r\nalarming fact of military preparation, which Lord Dunmore had thus\r\nreported concerning Virginia, could have been reported with equal\r\ntruth concerning nearly every other colony. In the early part of\r\nJanuary, 1775, the Assembly of Connecticut gave order that the entire\r\nmilitia of that colony should be mustered every week.[150] In the\r\nlatter part of January, the provincial convention of Pennsylvania,\r\nthough representing a colony of Quakers, boldly proclaimed that, if\r\nthe administration \"should determine by force to effect a submission\r\nto the late arbitrary acts of the British Parliament,\" it would\r\n\"resist such force, and at every hazard ... defend the rights and\r\nliberties of America.\"[151] On the 15th of February, the Provincial\r\nCongress of Massachusetts urged the people to \"spare neither time,\r\npains, nor expense, at so critical a juncture, in perfecting\r\nthemselves forthwith in military discipline.\"[152]\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, so late as Monday, the 20th of March, 1775, the\r\nsecond revolutionary convention of Virginia assembled at Richmond, its\r\nmembers were well aware that one of the chief measures to come before\r\nthem for consideration must be that of recognizing the local military\r\npreparations among their own constituents, and of placing them all\r\nunder some common organization and control. Accordingly, on Thursday,\r\nthe 23d of March, after three days had been given to necessary\r\npreliminary subjects, the inevitable subject of military preparations\r\nwas reached. Then it was that Patrick Henry took the floor and moved\r\nthe adoption of the following resolutions, supporting his motion,\r\nundoubtedly, with a speech:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That a well-regulated militia, composed of\r\n     gentlemen and yeomen, is the natural strength and only\r\n     security of a free government; that such a militia in this\r\n     colony would forever render it unnecessary for the mother\r\n     country to keep among us for the purpose of our defence any\r\n     standing army of mercenary forces, always subversive of the\r\n     quiet and dangerous to the liberties of the people, and\r\n     would obviate the pretext of taxing us for their support.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the establishment of such a militia is at\r\n     this time peculiarly necessary, by the state of our laws for\r\n     the protection and defence of the country, some of which\r\n     have already expired, and others will shortly do so; and\r\n     that the known remissness of government in calling us\r\n     together in a legislative capacity, renders it too insecure,\r\n     in this time of danger and distress, to rely that\r\n     opportunity will be given of renewing them in general\r\n     assembly, or making any provision to secure our inestimable\r\n     rights and liberties from those further violations with\r\n     which they are threatened.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved, therefore_, That this colony be immediately put\r\n     into a posture of defence; and that ... be a committee to\r\n     prepare a plan for the embodying, arming, and disciplining\r\n     such a number of men as may be sufficient for that\r\n     purpose.\"[153]\r\n\r\nNo one who reads these resolutions in the light of the facts just\r\ngiven, can find in them anything by which to account for the\r\nopposition which they are known to have met with in that assemblage.\r\nFor that assemblage, it must be remembered, was not the Virginia\r\nlegislature: it was a mere convention, and a revolutionary convention\r\nat that, gathered in spite of the objections of Lord Dunmore,\r\nrepresenting simply the deliberate purpose of those Virginians who\r\nmeant not finally to submit to unjust laws; some of its members,\r\nlikewise, being under express instructions from their constituents to\r\ntake measures for the immediate and adequate military organization of\r\nthe colony. Not a man, probably, was sent to that convention, not a\r\nman surely would have gone to it, who was not in substantial sympathy\r\nwith the prevailing revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nOf course, even they who were in sympathy with that spirit might have\r\nobjected to Patrick Henry's resolutions, had those resolutions been\r\nmarked by any startling novelty in doctrine, or by anything extreme or\r\nviolent in expression. But, plainly, they were neither extreme nor\r\nviolent; they were not even novel. They contained nothing essential\r\nwhich had not been approved, in almost the same words, more than three\r\nmonths before, by similar conventions in Maryland and in Delaware;\r\nwhich had not been approved, in almost the same words, many weeks\r\nbefore, by county conventions in Virginia,--in one instance, by a\r\ncounty convention presided over by Washington himself; which had not\r\nbeen approved, in other language, either weeks or months before, by\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and other\r\ncolonies; which was not sanctioned by the plainest prudence on the\r\npart of all persons who intended to make any further stand whatsoever\r\nagainst the encroachments of Parliament. It is safe to say that no man\r\nwho had within him enough of the revolutionary spirit to have prompted\r\nhis attendance at a revolutionary convention could have objected to\r\nany essential item in Patrick Henry's resolutions.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, were they objected to? Why was their immediate passage\r\nresisted? The official journal of the convention throws no light upon\r\nthe question: it records merely the adoption of the resolutions, and\r\nis entirely silent respecting any discussion that they may have\r\nprovoked. Thirty years afterward, however, St. George Tucker, who,\r\nthough not a member of this convention, had yet as a visitor watched\r\nits proceedings that day, gave from memory some account of them; and\r\nto him we are indebted for the names of the principal men who stood\r\nout against Patrick Henry's motion. \"This produced,\" he says, \"an\r\nanimated debate, in which Colonel Richard Bland, Mr. Nicholas, the\r\ntreasurer, and I think Colonel Harrison, of Berkeley, and Mr.\r\nPendleton, were opposed to the resolution, as conceiving it to be\r\npremature;\"[154] all these men being prudent politicians, indeed, but\r\nall fully committed to the cause of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAt first, this testimony may seem to leave us as much in the dark as\r\nbefore; and yet all who are familiar with the politics of Virginia at\r\nthat period will see in this cluster of names some clew to the secret\r\nof their opposition. It was an opposition to Patrick Henry himself,\r\nand as far as possible to any measure of which he should be the\r\nleading champion. Yet even this is not enough. Whatever may have been\r\ntheir private motives in resisting a measure advocated by Patrick\r\nHenry, they must still have had some reason which they would be\r\nwilling to assign. St. George Tucker tells us that they conceived his\r\nresolutions to be \"premature.\" But in themselves his resolutions, so\r\nfar from being premature, were rather tardy; they lagged weeks and\r\neven months behind many of the best counties in Virginia itself, as\r\nwell as behind those other colonies to which in political feeling\r\nVirginia was always most nearly akin.\r\n\r\nThe only possible explanation of the case seems to be found, not in\r\nthe resolutions themselves, but in the special interpretation put upon\r\nthem by Patrick Henry in the speech which, according to parliamentary\r\nusage, he seems to have made in moving their adoption. What was that\r\ninterpretation? In the true answer to that question, no doubt, lies\r\nthe secret of the resistance which his motion encountered. For, down\r\nto that day, no public body in America, and no public man, had openly\r\nspoken of a war with Great Britain in any more decisive way than as a\r\nthing highly probable, indeed, but still not inevitable. At last\r\nPatrick Henry spoke of it, and he wanted to induce the convention of\r\nVirginia to speak of it, as a thing inevitable. Others had said, \"The\r\nwar must come, and will come,--unless certain things are done.\"\r\nPatrick Henry, brushing away every prefix or suffix of uncertainty,\r\nevery half-despairing \"if,\" every fragile and pathetic \"unless,\"\r\nexclaimed, in the hearing of all men: \"Why talk of things being now\r\ndone which can avert the war? Such things will not be done. The war is\r\ncoming: it has come already.\" Accordingly, other conventions in the\r\ncolonies, in adopting similar resolutions, had merely announced the\r\nprobability of war. Patrick Henry would have this convention, by\r\nadopting his resolutions, virtually declare war itself.\r\n\r\nIn this alone, it is apparent, consisted the real priority and\r\noffensiveness of Patrick Henry's position as a revolutionary statesman\r\non the 23d of March, 1775. In this alone were his resolutions\r\n\"premature.\" The very men who opposed them because they were to be\r\nunderstood as closing the door against the possibility of peace, would\r\nhave favored them had they only left that door open, or even ajar. But\r\nPatrick Henry demanded of the people of Virginia that they should\r\ntreat all further talk of peace as mere prattle; that they should\r\nseize the actual situation by a bold grasp of it in front; that,\r\nlooking upon the war as a fact, they should instantly proceed to get\r\nready for it. And therein, once more, in revolutionary ideas, was\r\nPatrick Henry one full step in advance of his contemporaries. Therein,\r\nonce more, did he justify the reluctant praise of Jefferson, who was a\r\nmember of that convention, and who, nearly fifty years afterward, said\r\nconcerning Patrick Henry to a great statesman from Massachusetts:\r\n\"After all, it must be allowed that he was our leader in the measures\r\nof the Revolution in Virginia, and in that respect more is due to him\r\nthan to any other person.... He left all of us far behind.\"[155]\r\n\r\nSuch, at any rate, we have a right to suppose, was the substantial\r\nissue presented by the resolutions of Patrick Henry, and by his\r\nintroductory speech in support of them; and upon this issue the little\r\ngroup of politicians--able and patriotic men, who always opposed his\r\nleadership--then arrayed themselves against him, making the most,\r\ndoubtless, of everything favoring the possibility and the\r\ndesirableness of a peaceful adjustment of the great dispute. But their\r\nopposition to him only produced the usual result,--of arousing him to\r\nan effort which simply overpowered and scattered all further\r\nresistance. It was in review of their whole quivering platoon of hopes\r\nand fears, of doubts, cautions, and delays, that he then made the\r\nspeech which seems to have wrought astonishing effects upon those who\r\nheard it, and which, though preserved in a most inadequate report, now\r\nfills so great a space in the traditions of revolutionary eloquence:--\r\n\r\n     \"'No man, Mr. President, thinks more highly than I do of the\r\n     patriotism, as well as the abilities, of the very honorable\r\n     gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different\r\n     men often see the same subject in different lights; and,\r\n     therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to\r\n     those gentlemen if, entertaining, as I do, opinions of a\r\n     character very opposite to theirs, I should speak forth my\r\n     sentiments freely, and without reserve. This is no time for\r\n     ceremony. The question before the house is one of awful\r\n     moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as\r\n     nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery. And in\r\n     proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the\r\n     freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can\r\n     hope to arrive at truth, and fulfil the great responsibility\r\n     which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my\r\n     opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence, I\r\n     should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my\r\n     country, and of an act of disloyalty towards the majesty of\r\n     Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\r\n\r\n     \"'Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the\r\n     illusions of Hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a\r\n     painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\r\n     transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men,\r\n     engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we\r\n     disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see\r\n     not, and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly\r\n     concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever\r\n     anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the\r\n     whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\r\n\r\n     \"'I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that\r\n     is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of\r\n     the future but by the past. And, judging by the past, I wish\r\n     to know what there has been in the conduct of the British\r\n     ministry, for the last ten years, to justify those hopes\r\n     with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves\r\n     and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our\r\n     petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it\r\n     will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be\r\n     betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious\r\n     reception of our petition comports with those warlike\r\n     preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are\r\n     fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\r\n     reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be\r\n     reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our\r\n     love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the\r\n     implements of war and subjugation,--the last arguments to\r\n     which kings resort.\r\n\r\n     \"'I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\r\n     its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen\r\n     assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain\r\n     any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for all this\r\n     accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none.\r\n     They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They\r\n     are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which\r\n     the British ministry have been so long forging.\r\n\r\n     \"'And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?\r\n     Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have\r\n     we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have\r\n     held the subject up in every light of which it is capable;\r\n     but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty,\r\n     and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have\r\n     not been already exhausted?\r\n\r\n     \"'Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer.\r\n     Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the\r\n     storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have\r\n     remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated\r\n     ourselves before the throne, and have implored its\r\n     interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry\r\n     and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our\r\n     remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult;\r\n     our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been\r\n     spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne.\r\n\r\n     \"'In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope\r\n     of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for\r\n     hope. If we wish to be free; if we mean to preserve\r\n     inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have\r\n     been so long contending; if we mean not basely to abandon\r\n     the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged,\r\n     and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until\r\n     the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained,--we\r\n     must fight! I repeat it, sir,--we must fight! An appeal to\r\n     arms, and to the God of hosts, is all that is left us.'\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point in his address, the orator seems to have spoken with\r\ngreat deliberation and self-restraint. St. George Tucker, who was\r\npresent, and who has left a written statement of his recollections\r\nboth of the speech and of the scene, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was on that occasion that I first felt a full impression\r\n     of Mr. Henry's powers. In vain should I attempt to give any\r\n     idea of his speech. He was calm and collected; touched upon\r\n     the origin and progress of the dispute between Great Britain\r\n     and the colonies, the various conciliatory measures adopted\r\n     by the latter, and the uniformly increasing tone of violence\r\n     and arrogance on the part of the former.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows, in Tucker's narrative, the passage included in the last\r\ntwo paragraphs of the speech as given above, after which he adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"Imagine to yourself this speech delivered with all the calm\r\n     dignity of Cato of Utica; imagine to yourself the Roman\r\n     senate assembled in the capitol when it was entered by the\r\n     profane Gauls, who at first were awed by their presence as\r\n     if they had entered an assembly of the gods; imagine that\r\n     you heard that Cato addressing such a senate; imagine that\r\n     you saw the handwriting on the wall of Belshazzar's palace;\r\n     imagine you heard a voice as from heaven uttering the words,\r\n     'We must fight!' as the doom of fate,--and you may have some\r\n     idea of the speaker, the assembly to whom he addressed\r\n     himself, and the auditory of which I was one.\"[156]\r\n\r\nBut, by a comparison of this testimony of St. George Tucker with that\r\nof others who heard the speech, it is made evident that, as the orator\r\nthen advanced toward the conclusion and real climax of his argument,\r\nhe no longer maintained \"the calm dignity of Cato of Utica,\" but that\r\nhis manner gradually deepened into an intensity of passion and a\r\ndramatic power which were overwhelming. He thus continued:--\r\n\r\n     \"'They tell us, sir, that we are weak,--unable to cope with\r\n     so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger?\r\n     Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when\r\n     we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be\r\n     stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by\r\n     irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of\r\n     effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and\r\n     hugging the delusive phantom of Hope, until our enemies\r\n     shall have bound us hand and foot?\r\n\r\n     \"'Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those\r\n     means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\r\n     Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of\r\n     liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are\r\n     invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.\r\n\r\n     \"'Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There\r\n     is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations,\r\n     and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.\r\n     The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone: it is to the\r\n     vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no\r\n     election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too\r\n     late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in\r\n     submission and slavery. Our chains are forged. Their\r\n     clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston. The war is\r\n     inevitable. And let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come!\r\n\r\n     \"'It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may\r\n     cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually\r\n     begun. The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring\r\n     to our ears the clash of resounding arms. Our brethren are\r\n     already in the field. Why stand we here idle? What is it\r\n     that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear,\r\n     or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains\r\n     and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course\r\n     others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\r\n     death!'\"\r\n\r\nOf this tremendous speech there are in existence two traditional\r\ndescriptions, neither of which is inconsistent with the testimony\r\ngiven by St. George Tucker. He, as a lawyer and a judge, seems to have\r\nretained the impression of that portion of the speech which was the\r\nmore argumentative and unimpassioned: the two other reporters seem to\r\nhave remembered especially its later and more emotional passages. Our\r\nfirst traditional description was obtained by Henry Stephens Randall\r\nfrom a clergyman, who had it from an aged friend, also a clergyman,\r\nwho heard the speech itself:--\r\n\r\n     \"Henry rose with an unearthly fire burning in his eye. He\r\n     commenced somewhat calmly, but the smothered excitement\r\n     began more and more to play upon his features and thrill in\r\n     the tones of his voice. The tendons of his neck stood out\r\n     white and rigid like whip-cords. His voice rose louder and\r\n     louder, until the walls of the building, and all within\r\n     them, seemed to shake and rock in its tremendous vibrations.\r\n     Finally, his pale face and glaring eye became terrible to\r\n     look upon. Men leaned forward in their seats, with their\r\n     heads strained forward, their faces pale, and their eyes\r\n     glaring like the speaker's. His last exclamation, 'Give me\r\n     liberty, or give me death!' was like the shout of the leader\r\n     which turns back the rout of battle. The old man from whom\r\n     this tradition was derived added that, 'when the orator sat\r\n     down, he himself felt sick with excitement. Every eye yet\r\n     gazed entranced on Henry. It seemed as if a word from him\r\n     would have led to any wild explosion of violence. Men looked\r\n     beside themselves.'\"[157]\r\n\r\nThe second traditional description of the speech is here given from a\r\nmanuscript[158] of Edward Fontaine, who obtained it in 1834 from John\r\nRoane, who himself heard the speech. Roane told Fontaine that the\r\norator's \"voice, countenance, and gestures gave an irresistible force\r\nto his words, which no description could make intelligible to one who\r\nhad never seen him, nor heard him speak;\" but, in order to convey some\r\nnotion of the orator's manner, Roane described the delivery of the\r\nclosing sentences of the speech:--\r\n\r\n     \"You remember, sir, the conclusion of the speech, so often\r\n     declaimed in various ways by school-boys,--'Is life so dear,\r\n     or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains\r\n     and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course\r\n     others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\r\n     death!' He gave each of these words a meaning which is not\r\n     conveyed by the reading or delivery of them in the ordinary\r\n     way. When he said, 'Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as\r\n     to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?' he\r\n     stood in the attitude of a condemned galley slave, loaded\r\n     with fetters, awaiting his doom. His form was bowed; his\r\n     wrists were crossed; his manacles were almost visible as he\r\n     stood like an embodiment of helplessness and agony. After a\r\n     solemn pause, he raised his eyes and chained hands towards\r\n     heaven, and prayed, in words and tones which thrilled every\r\n     heart, 'Forbid it, Almighty God!' He then turned towards the\r\n     timid loyalists of the House, who were quaking with terror\r\n     at the idea of the consequences of participating in\r\n     proceedings which would be visited with the penalties of\r\n     treason by the British crown; and he slowly bent his form\r\n     yet nearer to the earth, and said, 'I know not what course\r\n     others may take,' and he accompanied the words with his\r\n     hands still crossed, while he seemed to be weighed down with\r\n     additional chains. The man appeared transformed into an\r\n     oppressed, heart-broken, and hopeless felon. After\r\n     remaining in this posture of humiliation long enough to\r\n     impress the imagination with the condition of the colony\r\n     under the iron heel of military despotism, he arose proudly,\r\n     and exclaimed, 'but as for me,'--and the words hissed\r\n     through his clenched teeth, while his body was thrown back,\r\n     and every muscle and tendon was strained against the fetters\r\n     which bound him, and, with his countenance distorted by\r\n     agony and rage, he looked for a moment like Laocoön in a\r\n     death struggle with coiling serpents; then the loud, clear,\r\n     triumphant notes, 'Give me liberty,' electrified the\r\n     assembly. It was not a prayer, but a stern demand, which\r\n     would submit to no refusal or delay. The sound of his voice,\r\n     as he spoke these memorable words, was like that of a\r\n     Spartan pæan on the field of Platæa; and, as each syllable\r\n     of the word 'liberty' echoed through the building, his\r\n     fetters were shivered; his arms were hurled apart; and the\r\n     links of his chains were scattered to the winds. When he\r\n     spoke the word 'liberty' with an emphasis never given it\r\n     before, his hands were open, and his arms elevated and\r\n     extended; his countenance was radiant; he stood erect and\r\n     defiant; while the sound of his voice and the sublimity of\r\n     his attitude made him appear a magnificent incarnation of\r\n     Freedom, and expressed all that can be acquired or enjoyed\r\n     by nations and individuals invincible and free. After a\r\n     momentary pause, only long enough to permit the echo of the\r\n     word 'liberty' to cease, he let his left hand fall powerless\r\n     to his side, and clenched his right hand firmly, as if\r\n     holding a dagger with the point aimed at his breast. He\r\n     stood like a Roman senator defying Cæsar, while the\r\n     unconquerable spirit of Cato of Utica flashed from every\r\n     feature; and he closed the grand appeal with the solemn\r\n     words, 'or give me death!' which sounded with the awful\r\n     cadence of a hero's dirge, fearless of death, and victorious\r\n     in death; and he suited the action to the word by a blow\r\n     upon the left breast with the right hand, which seemed to\r\n     drive the dagger to the patriot's heart.\"[159]\r\n\r\nBefore passing from this celebrated speech, it is proper to say\r\nsomething respecting the authenticity of the version of it which has\r\ncome down to us, and which is now so universally known in America. The\r\nspeech is given in these pages substantially as it was given by Wirt\r\nin his \"Life of Henry.\" Wirt himself does not mention whence he\r\nobtained his version; and all efforts to discover that version as a\r\nwhole, in any writing prior to Wirt's book, have thus far been\r\nunsuccessful. These facts have led even so genial a critic as Grigsby\r\nto incline to the opinion that \"much of the speech published by Wirt\r\nis apocryphal.\"[160] It would, indeed, be an odd thing, and a source\r\nof no little disturbance to many minds, if such should turn out to be\r\nthe case, and if we should have to conclude that an apocryphal speech\r\nwritten by Wirt, and attributed by him to Patrick Henry fifteen years\r\nafter the great orator's death, had done more to perpetuate the renown\r\nof Patrick Henry's oratory than had been done by any and all the words\r\nactually spoken by the orator himself during his lifetime. On the\r\nother hand, it should be said that Grigsby himself admits that \"the\r\noutline of the argument\" and \"some of its expressions\" are undoubtedly\r\n\"authentic.\" That this is so is apparent, likewise, from the written\r\nrecollections of St. George Tucker, wherein the substance of the\r\nspeech is given, besides one entire passage in almost the exact\r\nlanguage of the version by Wirt. Finally, John Roane, in 1834, in his\r\nconversation with Edward Fontaine, is said to have \"verified the\r\ncorrectness of the speech as it was written by Judge Tyler for Mr.\r\nWirt.\"[161] This, unfortunately, is the only intimation that has\r\nanywhere been found attributing Wirt's version to the excellent\r\nauthority of Judge John Tyler. If the statement could be confirmed, it\r\nwould dispel every difficulty at once. But, even though the statement\r\nshould be set aside, enough would still remain to justify us in\r\nthinking that Wirt's version of the famous speech by no means deserves\r\nto be called \"apocryphal,\" in any such sense as that word has when\r\napplied, for example, to the speeches in Livy and in Thucydides, or in\r\nBotta. In the first place, Wirt's version certainly gives the\r\nsubstance of the speech as actually made by Patrick Henry on the\r\noccasion named; and, for the form of it, Wirt seems to have gathered\r\ntestimony from all available living witnesses, and then, from such\r\nsentences or snatches of sentences as these witnesses could remember,\r\nas well as from his own conception of the orator's method of\r\nexpression, to have constructed the version which he has handed down\r\nto us. Even in that case, it is probably far more accurate and\r\nauthentic than are most of the famous speeches attributed to public\r\ncharacters before reporters' galleries were opened, and before the art\r\nof reporting was brought to its present perfection.\r\n\r\nReturning, now, from this long account of Patrick Henry's most\r\ncelebrated speech, to the assemblage in which it was made, it remains\r\nto be mentioned that the resolutions, as offered by Patrick Henry,\r\nwere carried; and that the committee, called for by those resolutions,\r\nto prepare a plan for \"embodying, arming, and disciplining\" the\r\nmilitia,[162] was at once appointed. Of this committee Patrick Henry\r\nwas chairman; and with him were associated Richard Henry Lee,\r\nNicholas, Harrison, Riddick, Washington, Stephen, Lewis, Christian,\r\nPendleton, Jefferson, and Zane. On the following day, Friday, the 24th\r\nof March, the committee brought in its report, which was laid over for\r\none day, and then, after some amendment, was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nThe convention did not close its labors until Monday, the 27th of\r\nMarch. The contemporaneous estimate of Patrick Henry, not merely as a\r\nleader in debate, but as a constitutional lawyer, and as a man of\r\naffairs, may be partly gathered from the fact of his connection with\r\neach of the two other important committees of this convention,--the\r\ncommittee \"to inquire whether his majesty may of right advance the\r\nterms of granting lands in this colony,\"[163] on which his associates\r\nwere the great lawyers, Bland, Jefferson, Nicholas, and Pendleton; and\r\nthe committee \"to prepare a plan for the encouragement of arts and\r\nmanufactures in this colony,\"[164] on which his associates were\r\nNicholas, Bland, Mercer, Pendleton, Cary, Carter of Stafford,\r\nHarrison, Richard Henry Lee, Clapham, Washington, Holt, and Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] For an example of such overstatement, see Wirt, 114-123.

A notable example of this class of Revolutionary\r\ncivilians with abortive military desires, is John Hancock. In June,\r\n1775, when Congress had before it the task of selecting one who should\r\nbe the military leader of the uprisen colonists, John Hancock, seated\r\nin the president's chair, gave unmistakable signs of thinking that the\r\nchoice ought to fall upon himself. While John Adams was speaking in\r\ngeneral terms of the military situation, involving, of course, the\r\nneed of a commander-in-chief, Hancock heard him \"with visible\r\npleasure;\" but when the orator came to point out Washington as the man\r\nbest fitted for the leadership, \"a sudden and striking change\" came\r\nover the countenance of the president. \"Mortification and resentment\r\nwere expressed as forcibly as his face could exhibit them;\"[165] and\r\nit is probable that, to the end of his days, he was never able\r\nentirely to forgive Washington for having carried off the martial\r\nglory that he had really believed to be within his own reach. But even\r\nJohn Adams, who so pitilessly unveiled the baffled military desires of\r\nHancock, was perhaps not altogether unacquainted with similar emotions\r\nin his own soul. Fully three weeks prior to that notable scene in\r\nCongress, in a letter to his wife in which he was speaking of the\r\namazing military spirit then running through the continent, and of the\r\nmilitary appointments then held by several of his Philadelphia\r\nfriends, he exclaimed in his impulsive way, \"Oh that I were a soldier!\r\nI will be.\"[166] And on the very day on which he joined in the escort\r\nof the new generals, Washington, Lee, and Schuyler, on their first\r\ndeparture from Philadelphia for the American camp, he sent off to his\r\nwife a characteristic letter revealing something of the anguish with\r\nwhich he, a civilian, viewed the possibility of his being at a\r\ndisadvantage with these military men in the race for glory:--\r\n\r\n     \"The three generals were all mounted on horseback,\r\n     accompanied by Major Mifflin, who is gone in the character\r\n     of aide-de-camp. All the delegates from the Massachusetts,\r\n     with their servants and carriages, attended. Many others of\r\n     the delegates from the Congress; a large troop of light\r\n     horse in their uniforms; many officers of militia, besides,\r\n     in theirs; music playing, etc., etc. Such is the pride and\r\n     pomp of war. I, poor creature, worn out with scribbling for\r\n     my bread and my liberty, low in spirits and weak in health,\r\n     must leave to others to wear the laurels which I have sown;\r\n     others to eat the bread which I have earned.\"[167]\r\n\r\nOf Patrick Henry, however, it may be said that his permanent fame as\r\nan orator and a statesman has almost effaced the memory of the fact\r\nthat, in the first year of the war, he had considerable prominence as\r\na soldier; that it was then believed by many, and very likely by\r\nhimself, that, having done as much as any man to bring on the war, he\r\nwas next to do as much as any man in the actual conduct of it, and was\r\nthus destined to add to a civil renown of almost unapproached\r\nbrilliance, a similar renown for splendid talents in the field. At any\r\nrate, the \"first overt act of war\" in Virginia, as Jefferson\r\ntestifies,[168] was committed by Patrick Henry. The first physical\r\nresistance to a royal governor, which in Massachusetts was made by the\r\nembattled farmers at Lexington and Concord, was made in Virginia\r\nalmost as early, under the direction and inspiration of Patrick\r\nHenry's leadership. In the first organization of the Revolutionary\r\narmy in Virginia, the chief command was given to Patrick Henry.\r\nFinally, that he never had the opportunity of proving in battle\r\nwhether or not he had military talents, and that, after some months of\r\nnominal command, he was driven by a series of official slights into an\r\nabandonment of his military career, may have been occasioned solely by\r\na proper distrust of his military capacity on the part of the Virginia\r\nCommittee of Safety, or it may have been due in some measure to the\r\nunslumbering jealousy of him which was at the time attributed to the\r\nleading members of that committee. The purpose of this chapter, and of\r\nthe next, will be to present a rapid grouping of these incidents in\r\nhis life,--incidents which now have the appearance of a mere episode,\r\nbut which once seemed the possible beginnings of a deliberate and\r\nconspicuous military career.\r\n\r\nWithin the city of Williamsburg, at the period now spoken of, had long\r\nbeen kept the public storehouse for gunpowder and arms. In the dead of\r\nthe night[169] preceding the 21st of April, 1775,--a little less than\r\na month, therefore, after the convention of Virginia had proclaimed\r\nthe inevitable approach of a war with Great Britain,--a detachment of\r\nmarines from the armed schooner Magdalen, then lying in the James\r\nRiver, stealthily visited this storehouse, and, taking thence fifteen\r\nhalf-barrels of gunpowder,[170] carried them off in Lord Dunmore's\r\nwagon to Burwell's Ferry, and put them on board their vessel. Of\r\ncourse, the news of this exploit flew fast through the colony, and\r\neverywhere awoke alarm and exasperation. Soon some thousands of armed\r\nmen made ready to march to the capital to demand the restoration of\r\nthe gunpowder. On Tuesday, the 25th of April, the independent company\r\nof Fredericksburg notified their colonel, George Washington, that,\r\nwith his approbation, they would be prepared to start for Williamsburg\r\non the following Saturday, \"properly accoutred as light-horsemen,\" and\r\nin conjunction with \"any other bodies of armed men who\" might be\r\n\"willing to appear in support of the honor of Virginia.\"[171]\r\n\r\nSimilar messages were promptly sent to Washington from the independent\r\ncompanies of Prince William[172] and Albemarle counties.[173] On\r\nWednesday, the 26th of April, the men in arms who had already arrived\r\nat Fredericksburg sent to the capital a swift messenger \"to inquire\r\nwhether the gunpowder had been replaced in the public magazine.\"[174]\r\nOn Saturday, the 29th,--being the day already fixed for the march upon\r\nWilliamsburg,--one hundred and two gentlemen, representing fourteen\r\ncompanies of light-horse, met in council at Fredericksburg, and, after\r\nconsidering a letter from the venerable Peyton Randolph which their\r\nmessenger had brought back with him, particularly Randolph's assurance\r\nthat the affair of the gunpowder was to be satisfactorily arranged,\r\ncame to the resolution that they would proceed no further at that\r\ntime; adding, however, this solemn declaration: \"We do now pledge\r\nourselves to each other to be in readiness, at a moment's warning, to\r\nreassemble, and by force of arms to defend the law, the liberty, and\r\nrights of this or any sister colony from unjust and wicked\r\ninvasion.\"[175]\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that Patrick Henry comes upon the scene. Thus far,\r\nduring the trouble, he appears to have been watching events from his\r\nhome in Hanover County. As soon, however, as word was brought to him\r\nof the tame conclusion thus reached by the assembled warriors at\r\nFredericksburg, his soul took fire at the lamentable mistake which he\r\nthought they had made. To him it seemed on every account the part of\r\nwisdom that the blow, which would have to be \"struck sooner or later,\r\nshould be struck at once, before an overwhelming force should enter\r\nthe colony;\" that the spell by which the people were held in a sort of\r\nsuperstitious awe of the governor should be broken; \"that the military\r\nresources of the country should be developed;\" that the people should\r\nbe made to \"see and feel their strength by being brought out together;\r\nthat the revolution should be set in actual motion in the colony; that\r\nthe martial prowess of the country should be awakened, and the\r\nsoldiery animated by that proud and resolute confidence which a\r\nsuccessful enterprise in the commencement of a contest never fails to\r\ninspire.\"[176]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he resolved that, as the troops lately rendezvoused at\r\nFredericksburg had forborne to strike this needful blow, he would\r\nendeavor to repair the mistake by striking it himself. At once,\r\ntherefore, he despatched expresses to the officers and men of the\r\nindependent company of his own county, \"requesting them to meet him in\r\narms at New Castle on the second of May, on business of the highest\r\nimportance to American liberty.\"[177] He also summoned the county\r\ncommittee to meet him at the same time and place.\r\n\r\nAt the place and time appointed his neighbors were duly assembled; and\r\nwhen he had laid before them, in a speech of wonderful eloquence, his\r\nview of the situation, they instantly resolved to put themselves under\r\nhis command, and to march at once to the capital, either to recover\r\nthe gunpowder itself, or to make reprisals on the king's property\r\nsufficient to replace it. Without delay the march began, Captain\r\nPatrick Henry leading. By sunset of the following day, they had got as\r\nfar as to Doncastle's Ordinary, about sixteen miles from Williamsburg,\r\nand there rested for the night. Meantime, the news that Patrick Henry\r\nwas marching with armed men straight against Lord Dunmore, to demand\r\nthe restoration of the gunpowder or payment for it, carried\r\nexhilaration or terror in all directions. On the one hand, many\r\nprudent and conservative gentlemen were horrified at his rashness,\r\nand sent messenger after messenger to beg him to stay his fearful\r\nproceeding, to turn about, and to go home.[178] On the other hand, as\r\nthe word flew from county to county that Patrick Henry had taken up\r\nthe people's cause in this vigorous fashion, five thousand men sprang\r\nto arms, and started across the country to join the ranks of his\r\nfollowers, and to lend a hand in case of need. At Williamsburg, the\r\nrumor of his approach brought on a scene of consternation. The wife\r\nand family of Lord Dunmore were hurried away to a place of safety.\r\nFurther down the river, the commander of his majesty's ship Fowey was\r\nnotified that \"his excellency the Lord Dunmore, governor of Virginia,\"\r\nwas \"threatened with an attack at daybreak, ... at his palace at\r\nWilliamsburg;\" and for his defence was speedily sent off a detachment\r\nof marines.[179] Before daybreak, however, the governor seems to have\r\ncome to the prudent decision to avert, by a timely settlement with\r\nPatrick Henry, the impending attack; and accordingly, soon after\r\ndaybreak, a messenger arrived at Doncastle's Ordinary, there to tender\r\nimmediate satisfaction in money for the gunpowder that had been\r\nravished away.[180] The troops, having already resumed their march,\r\nwere halted; and soon a settlement of the trouble was effected,\r\naccording to the terms of the following singular document:--\r\n\r\n                    DONCASTLE'S ORDINARY, NEW KENT, May 4, 1775.\r\n\r\n     Received from the Honorable Richard Corbin, Esq., his\r\n     majesty's receiver-general, £330, as a compensation for the\r\n     gunpowder lately taken out of the public magazine by the\r\n     governor's order; which money I promise to convey to the\r\n     Virginia delegates at the General Congress, to be under\r\n     their direction laid out in gunpowder for the colony's use,\r\n     and to be stored as they shall direct, until the next colony\r\n     convention or General Assembly; unless it shall be\r\n     necessary, in the mean time, to use the same in defence of\r\n     this colony. It is agreed, that in case the next convention\r\n     shall determine that any part of the said money ought to be\r\n     returned to his majesty's receiver-general, that the same\r\n     shall be done accordingly.\r\n\r\n                                     PATRICK HENRY, JUNIOR.[181]\r\n\r\nThe chief object for which Patrick Henry and his soldiers had taken\r\nthe trouble to come to that place having been thus suddenly\r\naccomplished, there was but one thing left for them to do before they\r\nshould return to their homes. Robert Carter Nicholas, the treasurer of\r\nthe colony, was at Williamsburg; and to him Patrick Henry at once\r\ndespatched a letter informing him of the arrangement that had been\r\nmade, and offering to him any protection that he might in consequence\r\nrequire:--\r\n\r\n                                                   May 4, 1775.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--The affair of the powder is now settled, so as to\r\n     produce satisfaction in me, and I earnestly wish to the\r\n     colony in general. The people here have it in charge from\r\n     the Hanover committee, to tender their services to you as a\r\n     public officer, for the purpose of escorting the public\r\n     treasury to any place in this colony where the money would\r\n     be judged more safe than in the city of Williamsburg. The\r\n     reprisal now made by the Hanover volunteers, though\r\n     accomplished in a manner least liable to the imputation of\r\n     violent extremity, may possibly be the cause of future\r\n     injury to the treasury. If, therefore, you apprehend the\r\n     least danger, a sufficient guard is at your service. I beg\r\n     the return of the bearer may be instant, because the men\r\n     wish to know their destination.\r\n\r\n                                With great regard, I am, sir,\r\n                                     Your most humble servant,\r\n                                          PATRICK HENRY, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n     TO ROBERT CARTER NICHOLAS, Esq., Treasurer.[182]\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry's desire for an immediate answer from the respectable\r\nMr. Nicholas was gratified, although it came in the form of a\r\ndignified rebuff: Mr. Nicholas \"had no apprehension of the necessity\r\nor propriety of the proffered service.\"[183]\r\n\r\nNo direct communication seems to have been had at that time with Lord\r\nDunmore; but two days afterward his lordship, having given to Patrick\r\nHenry ample time to withdraw to a more agreeable distance, sent\r\nthundering after him this portentous proclamation:--\r\n\r\n     Whereas I have been informed from undoubted authority that a\r\n     certain Patrick Henry, of the county of Hanover, and a\r\n     number of deluded followers, have taken up arms, chosen\r\n     their officers, and styling themselves an independent\r\n     company, have marched out of their county, encamped, and put\r\n     themselves in a posture of war, and have written and\r\n     dispatched letters to divers parts of the country, exciting\r\n     the people to join in these outrageous and rebellious\r\n     practices, to the great terror of all his majesty's faithful\r\n     subjects, and in open defiance of law and government; and\r\n     have committed other acts of violence, particularly in\r\n     extorting from his majesty's receiver-general the sum of\r\n     three hundred and thirty pounds, under pretence of replacing\r\n     the powder I thought proper to order from the magazine;\r\n     whence it undeniably appears that there is no longer the\r\n     least security for the life or property of any man:\r\n     wherefore, I have thought proper, with the advice of his\r\n     majesty's council, and in his majesty's name, to issue this\r\n     my proclamation, strictly charging all persons, upon their\r\n     allegiance, not to aid, abet, or give countenance to the\r\n     said Patrick Henry, or any other persons concerned in such\r\n     unwarrantable combinations, but on the contrary to oppose\r\n     them and their designs by every means; which designs must,\r\n     otherwise, inevitably involve the whole country in the most\r\n     direful calamity, as they will call for the vengeance of\r\n     offended majesty and the insulted laws to be exerted here,\r\n     to vindicate the constitutional authority of government.\r\n\r\n     Given under my hand and the seal of the colony, at\r\n     Williamsburg, this 6th day of May, 1775, and in the\r\n     fifteenth year of his majesty's reign.\r\n\r\n                                                     DUNMORE.\r\n\r\n     God save the king.[184]\r\n\r\nBeyond question, there were in Virginia at that time many excellent\r\ngentlemen who still trusted that the dispute with Great Britain might\r\nbe composed without bloodshed, and to whom Patrick Henry's conduct in\r\nthis affair must have appeared foolhardy, presumptuous, and even\r\ncriminal. The mass of the people of Virginia, however, did not incline\r\nto take that view of the subject. They had no faith any longer in\r\ntimid counsels, in hesitating measures. They believed that their most\r\nimportant earthly rights were in danger. They longed for a leader with\r\nvigor, promptitude, courage, caring less for technical propriety than\r\nfor justice, and not afraid to say so, by word or deed, to Lord\r\nDunmore and to Lord Dunmore's master. Such a leader they thought they\r\nsaw in Patrick Henry. Accordingly, even on his march homeward from\r\nDoncastle's Ordinary, the heart of Virginia began to go forth to him\r\nin expressions of love, of gratitude, and of homage, such as no\r\nAmerican colonist perhaps had ever before received. Upon his return\r\nhome, his own county greeted him with its official approval.[185] On\r\nthe 8th of May, the county of Louisa sent him her thanks;[186] and on\r\nthe following day, messages to the same effect were sent from the\r\ncounties of Orange and Spottsylvania.[187] On the 19th of May, an\r\naddress \"to the inhabitants of Virginia,\" under the signature of\r\n\"Brutus,\" saluted Patrick Henry as \"his country's and America's\r\nunalterable and unappalled great advocate and friend.\"[188] On the 22d\r\nof May, Prince William County declared its thanks to be \"justly due to\r\nCaptain Patrick Henry, and the gentlemen volunteers who attended him,\r\nfor their proper and spirited conduct.\"[189] On the 26th of May,\r\nLoudoun County declared its cordial approval.[190] On the 9th of June,\r\nthe volunteer company of Lancaster County resolved \"that every member\r\nof this company do return thanks to the worthy Captain Patrick Henry\r\nand the volunteer company of Hanover, for their spirited conduct on a\r\nlate expedition, and they are determined to protect him from any\r\ninsult that may be offered him, on that account, at the risk of life\r\nand fortune.\"[191] On the 19th of June, resolutions of gratitude and\r\nconfidence were voted by the counties of Prince Edward and of\r\nFrederick, the latter saying:--\r\n\r\n     \"We should blush to be thus late in our commendations of,\r\n     and thanks to, Patrick Henry, Esquire, for his patriotic and\r\n     spirited behavior in making reprisals for the powder so\r\n     unconstitutionally ... taken from the public magazine, could\r\n     we have entertained a thought that any part of the colony\r\n     would have condemned a measure calculated for the benefit of\r\n     the whole; but as we are informed this is the case, we beg\r\n     leave ... to assure that gentleman that we did from the\r\n     first, and still do, most cordially approve and commend his\r\n     conduct in that affair. The good people of this county will\r\n     never fail to approve and support him to the utmost of their\r\n     powers in every action derived from so rich a source as the\r\n     love of his country. We heartily thank him for stepping\r\n     forth to convince the tools of despotism that freeborn men\r\n     are not to be intimidated, by any form of danger, to submit\r\n     to the arbitrary acts of their rulers.\"[192]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, the county of Fincastle prolonged the strain of\r\npublic affection and applause by assuring Patrick Henry that it would\r\nsupport and justify him at the risk of life and fortune.[193]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the second Continental Congress had already convened\r\nat Philadelphia, beginning its work on the 10th of May. The journal\r\nmentions the presence, on that day, of all the delegates from\r\nVirginia, excepting Patrick Henry, who, of course, had been delayed in\r\nhis preparations for the journey by the events which we have just\r\ndescribed. Not until the 11th of May was he able to set out from his\r\nhome; and he was then accompanied upon his journey, to a point beyond\r\nthe borders of the colony, by a spontaneous escort of armed men,--a\r\ntoken, not only of the popular love for him, but of the popular\r\nanxiety lest Dunmore should take the occasion of an unprotected\r\njourney to put him under arrest. \"Yesterday,\" says a document dated\r\nat Hanover, May the 12th, 1775, \"Patrick Henry, one of the delegates\r\nfor this colony, escorted by a number of respectable young gentlemen,\r\nvolunteers from this and King William and Caroline counties, set out\r\nto attend the General Congress. They proceeded with him as far as Mrs.\r\nHooe's ferry, on the Potomac, by whom they were most kindly and\r\nhospitably entertained, and also provided with boats and hands to\r\ncross the river; and after partaking of this lady's beneficence, the\r\nbulk of the company took their leave of Mr. Henry, saluting him with\r\ntwo platoons and repeated huzzas. A guard accompanied that worthy\r\ngentleman to the Maryland side, who saw him safely landed; and\r\ncommitting him to the gracious and wise Disposer of all human events,\r\nto guide and protect him whilst contending for a restitution of our\r\ndearest rights and liberties, they wished him a safe journey, and\r\nhappy return to his family and friends.\"[194]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[165] _Works of John Adams_, ii. 415-417.\r\n\r\n[166] _Letters of John Adams to his Wife_, i. 40.\r\n\r\n[167] _Letters of John Adams to his Wife_, i. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n[168] _Works of Jefferson_, i. 116.\r\n\r\n[169] 4 _Am.

From the official journal of this\r\nCongress, it is impossible to ascertain the full extent of any\r\nmember's participation in its work. Its proceedings were transacted in\r\nsecret; and only such results were announced to the public as, in the\r\nopinion of Congress, it was desirable that the public should know.\r\nThen, too, from the private correspondence and the diaries of its\r\nmembers but little help can be got. As affecting Patrick Henry, almost\r\nthe only non-official testimony that has been found is that of\r\nJefferson, who, however, did not enter this Congress until its session\r\nwas half gone, and who, forty years afterward, wrote what he probably\r\nsupposed to be his recollections concerning his old friend's\r\ndeportment and influence in that body:--\r\n\r\n     \"I found Mr. Henry to be a silent and almost unmeddling\r\n     member in Congress. On the original opening of that body,\r\n     while general grievances were the topic, he was in his\r\n     element, and captivated all by his bold and splendid\r\n     eloquence. But as soon as they came to specific matters, to\r\n     sober reasoning and solid argumentation, he had the good\r\n     sense to perceive that his declamation, however excellent in\r\n     its proper place, had no weight at all in such an assembly\r\n     as that, of cool-headed, reflecting, judicious men. He\r\n     ceased, therefore, in a great measure, to take any part in\r\n     the business. He seemed, indeed, very tired of the place,\r\n     and wonderfully relieved when, by appointment of the\r\n     Virginia convention to be colonel of their first regiment,\r\n     he was permitted to leave Congress about the last of\r\n     July.\"[195]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the principal value of this testimony is to serve as an\r\nillustration of the extreme fragility of any man's memory respecting\r\nevents long passed, even in his own experience. Thus, Jefferson here\r\nremembers how \"wonderfully relieved\" Patrick Henry was at being\r\n\"permitted to leave Congress\" on account of his appointment by the\r\nVirginia convention \"to be colonel of their first regiment.\" But, from\r\nthe official records of the time, it can now be shown that neither of\r\nthe things which Jefferson thus remembers, ever had any existence in\r\nfact. In the first place, the journal of the Virginia convention[196]\r\nindicates that Patrick Henry's appointment as colonel could not have\r\nbeen the occasion of any such relief from congressional duties as\r\nJefferson speaks of; for that appointment was not made until five\r\ndays after Congress itself had adjourned, when, of course, Patrick\r\nHenry and his fellow delegates, including Jefferson, were already far\r\nadvanced on their journey back to Virginia. In the second place, the\r\njournal of Congress[197] indicates that Patrick Henry had no such\r\nrelief from congressional duties, on any account, but was bearing his\r\nfull share in its business, even in the plainest and most practical\r\ndetails, down to the very end of the session.\r\n\r\nAny one who now recalls the tremendous events that were taking place\r\nin the land while the second Continental Congress was in session, and\r\nthe immense questions of policy and of administration with which it\r\nhad to deal, will find it hard to believe that its deliberations were\r\nout of the range of Patrick Henry's sympathies or capacities, or that\r\nhe could have been the listless, speechless, and ineffective member\r\ndepicted by the later pen of Jefferson. When that Congress first came\r\ntogether, the blood was as yet hardly dry on the grass in Lexington\r\nCommon; on the very morning on which its session opened, the colonial\r\ntroops burst into the stronghold at Ticonderoga; and when the session\r\nhad lasted but six weeks, its members were conferring together over\r\nthe ghastly news from Bunker Hill. The organization of some kind of\r\nnational government for thirteen colonies precipitated into a state of\r\nwar; the creation of a national army; the selection of a\r\ncommander-in-chief, and of the officers to serve under him; the\r\nhurried fortification of coasts, harbors, cities; the supply of the\r\ntroops with clothes, tents, weapons, ammunition, food, medicine;\r\nprotection against the Indian tribes along the frontier of nearly\r\nevery colony; the goodwill of the people of Canada, and of Jamaica; a\r\nsolemn, final appeal to the king and to the people of England; an\r\nappeal to the people of Ireland; finally, a grave statement to all\r\nmankind of \"the causes and necessity of their taking up arms,\"--these\r\nwere among the weighty and soul-stirring matters which the second\r\nContinental Congress had to consider and to decide upon. For any man\r\nto say, forty years afterward, even though he say it with all the\r\nauthority of the renown of Thomas Jefferson, that, in the presence of\r\nsuch questions, the spirit of Patrick Henry was dull or unconcerned,\r\nand that, in a Congress which had to deal with such questions, he was\r\n\"a silent and almost unmeddling member,\" is to put a strain upon human\r\nconfidence which it is unable to bear.\r\n\r\nThe formula by which the daily labors of this Congress are frequently\r\ndescribed in its own journal is, that \"Congress met according to\r\nadjournment, and, agreeable to the order of the day, again resolved\r\nitself into a committee of the whole to take into consideration the\r\nstate of America; and after some time spent therein, the president\r\nresumed the chair, and Mr. Ward, from the committee, reported that\r\nthey had proceeded in the business, but, not having completed it,\r\ndesired him to move for leave to sit again.\"[198] And although, from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the session, no mention is made of any\r\nword spoken in debate by any member, we can yet glean, even from that\r\nmeagre record, enough to prove that upon Patrick Henry was laid about\r\nas much labor in the form of committee-work as upon any other member\r\nof the House,--a fair test, it is believed, of any man's zeal,\r\nindustry, and influence in any legislative body.\r\n\r\nFurther, it will be noted that the committee-work to which he was thus\r\nassigned was often of the homeliest and most prosaic kind, calling not\r\nfor declamatory gifts, but for common sense, discrimination,\r\nexperience, and knowledge of men and things. He seems, also, to have\r\nhad special interest and authority in the several anxious phases of\r\nthe Indian question as presented by the exigencies of that awful\r\ncrisis, and to have been placed on every committee that was appointed\r\nto deal with any branch of the subject. Thus, on the 16th of June, he\r\nwas placed with General Schuyler, James Duane, James Wilson, and\r\nPhilip Livingston, on a committee \"to take into consideration the\r\npapers transmitted from the convention of New York, relative to Indian\r\naffairs, and report what steps, in their opinion, are necessary to be\r\ntaken for securing and preserving the friendship of the Indian\r\nnations.\"[199] On the 19th of June, he served with John Adams and\r\nThomas Lynch on a committee to inform Charles Lee of his appointment\r\nas second major-general; and when Lee's answer imported that his\r\nsituation and circumstances as a British officer required some further\r\nand very careful negotiations with Congress, Patrick Henry was placed\r\nupon the special committee to which this delicate business was\r\nintrusted.[200] On the 21st of June, the very day on which, according\r\nto the journal, \"Mr. Thomas Jefferson appeared as a delegate for the\r\ncolony of Virginia, and produced his credentials,\" his colleague,\r\nPatrick Henry, rose in his place and stated that Washington \"had put\r\ninto his hand sundry queries, to which he desired the Congress would\r\ngive an answer.\" These queries necessarily involved subjects of\r\nserious concern to the cause for which they were about to plunge into\r\nwar, and would certainly require for their consideration \"cool-headed,\r\nreflecting, and judicious men.\" The committee appointed for the\r\npurpose consisted of Silas Deane, Patrick Henry, John Rutledge, Samuel\r\nAdams, and Richard Henry Lee.[201] On the 10th of July, \"Mr. Alsop\r\ninformed the Congress that he had an invoice of Indian goods, which a\r\ngentleman in this town had delivered to him, and which the said\r\ngentleman was willing to dispose of to the Congress.\" The committee\r\n\"to examine the said invoice and report to the Congress\" was composed\r\nof Philip Livingston, Patrick Henry, and John Alsop.[202] On the 12th\r\nof July, it was resolved to organize three departments for the\r\nmanagement of Indian affairs, the commissioners to \"have power to\r\ntreat with the Indians in their respective departments, in the name\r\nand on behalf of the United Colonies, in order to preserve peace and\r\nfriendship with the said Indians, and to prevent their taking any part\r\nin the present commotions.\" On the following day the commissioners for\r\nthe middle department were elected, namely, Franklin, Patrick Henry,\r\nand James Wilson.[203] On the 17th of July, a committee was appointed\r\nto negotiate with the Indian missionary, the Rev. Samuel Kirkland,\r\nrespecting his past and future services among the Six Nations, \"in\r\norder to secure their friendship, and to continue them in a state of\r\nneutrality with respect to the present controversy between Great\r\nBritain and these colonies.\" This committee consisted of Thomas\r\nCushing, Patrick Henry, and Silas Deane.[204] Finally, on the 31st of\r\nJuly, next to the last day of the session, a committee consisting of\r\none member for each colony was appointed to serve in the recess of\r\nCongress, for the very practical and urgent purpose of inquiring \"in\r\nall the colonies after virgin lead and leaden ore, and the best\r\nmethods of collecting, smelting, and refining it;\" also, after \"the\r\ncheapest and easiest methods of making salt in these colonies.\" This\r\nwas not a committee on which any man could be useful who had only\r\n\"declamation\" to contribute to its work; and the several colonies\r\nwere represented upon it by their most sagacious and their weightiest\r\nmen,--as New Hampshire by Langdon, Massachusetts by John Adams, Rhode\r\nIsland by Stephen Hopkins, Pennsylvania by Franklin, Delaware by\r\nRodney, South Carolina by Gadsden, Virginia by Patrick Henry.[205]\r\n\r\nOn the day on which this committee was appointed, Patrick Henry wrote\r\nto Washington, then at the headquarters of the army near Boston, a\r\nletter which denoted on the part of the writer a perception, unusual\r\nat that time, of the gravity and duration of the struggle on which the\r\ncolonies were just entering:--\r\n\r\n                                 PHILADELPHIA, July 31st, 1775.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--Give me leave to recommend the bearer, Mr. Frazer,\r\n     to your notice and regard. He means to enter the American\r\n     camp, and there to gain that experience, of which the\r\n     general cause may be avail'd. It is my earnest wish that\r\n     many Virginians might see service. It is not unlikely that\r\n     in the fluctuation of things our country may have occasion\r\n     for great military exertions. For this reason I have taken\r\n     the liberty to trouble you with this and a few others of the\r\n     same tendency. The public good which you, sir, have so\r\n     eminently promoted, is my only motive. That you may enjoy\r\n     the protection of Heaven and live long and happy is the\r\n     ardent wish of,\r\n\r\n                               Sir,\r\n                                    Yr. mo. obt. hbl. serv.,\r\n                                                P. HENRY, JR.[206]\r\n\r\n     His Excellency, GENL. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Congress adjourned. As soon as possible after its\r\nadjournment, the Virginia delegates seem to have departed for home, to\r\ntake their places in the convention then in session at Richmond; for\r\nthe journal of that convention mentions that on Wednesday, August the\r\n9th, \"Patrick Henry, Edmund Pendleton, Benjamin Harrison, and Thomas\r\nJefferson, Esquires, appeared in convention, and took their\r\nseats.\"[207] On the next day an incident occurred in the convention\r\nimplying that Patrick Henry, during his absence in Congress, had been\r\nable to serve his colony by other gifts as well as by those of \"bold\r\nand splendid eloquence:\" it was resolved that \"the powder purchased by\r\nPatrick Henry, Esquire, for the use of this colony, be immediately\r\nsent for.\"[208] On the day following that, the convention resolved\r\nunanimously that \"the thanks of this convention are justly due to his\r\nexcellency, George Washington, Esquire, Patrick Henry, and Edmund\r\nPendleton, Esquires, three of the worthy delegates who represented\r\nthis colony in the late Continental Congress, for their faithful\r\ndischarge of that important trust; and this body are only induced to\r\ndispense with their future services of the like kind, by the\r\nappointment of the two former to other offices in the public service,\r\nincompatible with their attendance on this, and the infirm state of\r\nhealth of the latter.\"[209]\r\n\r\nOf course, the two appointments here referred to are of Washington as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the forces of the United Colonies, and of\r\nPatrick Henry as commander-in-chief of the forces of Virginia,--the\r\nlatter appointment having been made by the Virginia convention on the\r\n5th of August. The commission, which passed the convention on the 28th\r\nof that month, constituted Patrick Henry \"colonel of the first\r\nregiment of regulars, and commander-in-chief of all the forces to be\r\nraised for the protection and defence of this colony;\" and while it\r\nrequired \"all officers and soldiers, and every person whatsoever, in\r\nany way concerned, to be obedient\" to him, \"in all things touching the\r\ndue execution of this commission,\" it also required him to be obedient\r\nto \"all orders and instructions which, from time to time,\" he might\r\n\"receive from the convention or Committee of Safety.\"[210]\r\nAccordingly, Patrick Henry's control of military proceedings in\r\nVirginia was, as it proved, nothing more than nominal: it was a\r\nsupreme command on paper, tempered in actual experience by the\r\nincessant and distrustful interference of an ever-present body of\r\ncivilians, who had all power over him.\r\n\r\nA newspaper of Williamsburg for the 23d of September announces the\r\narrival there, two days before, of \"Patrick Henry, Esquire,\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Virginia forces. He was met and escorted to\r\ntown by the whole body of volunteers, who paid him every mark of\r\nrespect and distinction in their power.\"[211] Thereupon he inspected\r\nthe grounds about the city; and as a place suitable for the\r\nencampment, he fixed upon a site in the rear of the College of William\r\nand Mary. Soon troops began to arrive in considerable numbers, and to\r\nprepare themselves for whatever service might be required of\r\nthem.[212] There was, however, a sad lack of arms and ammunition. On\r\nthe 15th of October, Pendleton, who was at the head of the Committee\r\nof Safety, gave this account of the situation in a letter to Richard\r\nHenry Lee, then in Congress at Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n     \"Had we arms and ammunition, it would give vigor to our\r\n     measures.... Nine companies of regulars are here, and seem\r\n     very clever men; others, we hear, are ready, and only wait\r\n     to collect arms. Lord Dunmore's forces are only one hundred\r\n     and sixty as yet, intrenched at Gosport, and supported by\r\n     the ships drawn up before that and Norfolk.\"[213]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, Lord Dunmore, who had been compelled by the\r\nsmallness of his land force to take refuge upon his armed vessels off\r\nthe coast, thus described the situation, in a letter to General Sir\r\nWilliam Howe, then in command at Boston:--\r\n\r\n     \"I must inform you that with our little corps, I think we\r\n     have done wonders. We have taken and destroyed above four\r\n     score pieces of ordnance, and, by landing in different parts\r\n     of the country, we keep them in continual hot water....\r\n     Having heard that a thousand chosen men belonging to the\r\n     rebels, great part of whom were riflemen, were on their\r\n     march to attack us here, or to cut off our provisions, I\r\n     determined to take possession of the pass at the Great\r\n     Bridge, which secures us the greatest part of two counties\r\n     to supply us with provisions. I accordingly ordered a\r\n     stockade fort to be erected there, which was done in a few\r\n     days; and I put an officer and twenty-five men to garrison\r\n     it, with some volunteers and negroes, who have defended it\r\n     against all the efforts of the rebels for these eight days.\r\n     We have killed several of their men; and I make no doubt we\r\n     shall now be able to maintain our ground there; but should\r\n     we be obliged to abandon it, we have thrown up an\r\n     intrenchment on the land side of Norfolk, which I hope they\r\n     will never be able to force. Here we are, with only the\r\n     small part of a regiment contending against the extensive\r\n     colony of Virginia.\"[214]\r\n\r\nBut who were these \"thousand chosen men belonging to the rebels,\" who,\r\non their march to attack Lord Dunmore at Norfolk, had thus been held\r\nin check by his little fort at the Great Bridge? We are told by\r\nDunmore himself that they were Virginia troops. But why was not\r\nPatrick Henry in immediate command of them? Why was Patrick Henry held\r\nback from this service,--the only active service then to be had in the\r\nfield? And why was the direction of this important enterprise given to\r\nhis subordinate, Colonel William Woodford, of the second regiment?\r\nThere is abundant evidence that Patrick Henry had eagerly desired to\r\nconduct this expedition; that he had even solicited the Committee of\r\nSafety to permit him to do so; but that they, distrusting his military\r\ncapacity, overruled his wishes, and gave this fine opportunity for\r\nmilitary distinction to the officer next below him in command.\r\nMoreover, no sooner had Colonel Woodford departed upon the service,\r\nthan he began to ignore altogether the commander-in-chief, and to make\r\nhis communications directly to the Committee of Safety,--a course in\r\nwhich he was virtually sustained by that body, on appeal being made to\r\nthem. Furthermore, on the 9th of December, Colonel Woodford won a\r\nbrilliant victory over the enemy at the Great Bridge,[215] thus\r\napparently justifying to the public the wisdom of the committee in\r\nassigning the work to him, and also throwing still more into the\r\nbackground the commander-in-chief, who was then chafing in camp over\r\nhis enforced retirement from this duty. But this was not the only cup\r\nof humiliation which was pressed to his lips. Not long afterward,\r\nthere arrived at the seat of war a few hundred North Carolina troops,\r\nunder command of Colonel Robert Howe; and the latter, with the full\r\nconsent of Woodford, at once took command of their united forces, and\r\nthenceforward addressed his official letters solely to the convention\r\nof Virginia, or to the Committee of Safety, paying not the slightest\r\nattention to the commander-in-chief.[216] Finally, on the 28th of\r\nDecember, Congress decided to raise in Virginia six battalions to be\r\ntaken into continental pay;[217] and, by a subsequent vote, it\r\nlikewise resolved to include within these six battalions the first and\r\nthe second Virginia regiments already raised.[218] A commission was\r\naccordingly sent to Patrick Henry as colonel of the first Virginia\r\nbattalion,[219]--an official intimation that the expected commission\r\nof a brigadier-general for Virginia was to be given to some one else.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this last affront, Patrick Henry determined to lay down\r\nhis military appointments, which he did on the 28th of February, 1776,\r\nand at once prepared to leave the camp. As soon as this news got\r\nabroad among the troops, they all, according to a contemporary\r\naccount,[220] \"went into mourning, and, under arms, waited on him at\r\nhis lodgings,\" when his officers presented to him an affectionate\r\naddress:--\r\n\r\n     TO PATRICK HENRY, JUNIOR, ESQUIRE:\r\n\r\n     Deeply impressed with a grateful sense of the obligations we\r\n     lie under to you for the polite, humane, and tender\r\n     treatment manifested to us throughout the whole of your\r\n     conduct, while we have had the honor of being under your\r\n     command, permit us to offer to you our sincere thanks, as\r\n     the only tribute we have in our power to pay to your real\r\n     merits. Notwithstanding your withdrawing yourself from\r\n     service fills us with the most poignant sorrow, as it at\r\n     once deprives us of our father and general, yet, as\r\n     gentlemen, we are compelled to applaud your spirited\r\n     resentment to the most glaring indignity. May your merit\r\n     shine as conspicuous to the world in general as it hath done\r\n     to us, and may Heaven shower its choicest blessings upon\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAMSBURG, February 29, 1776.\r\n\r\nHis reply to this warm-hearted message was in the following words:--\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--I am extremely obliged to you for your\r\n     approbation of my conduct. Your address does me the highest\r\n     honor. This kind testimony of your regard to me would have\r\n     been an ample reward for services much greater than I have\r\n     had the power to perform. I return you, and each of you,\r\n     gentlemen, my best acknowledgments for the spirit, alacrity,\r\n     and zeal you have constantly shown in your several stations.\r\n     I am unhappy to part with you. I leave the service, but I\r\n     leave my heart with you. May God bless you, and give you\r\n     success and safety, and make you the glorious instruments of\r\n     saving our country.[221]\r\n\r\nThe grief and indignation thus exhibited by the officers who had\r\nserved under Patrick Henry soon showed itself in a somewhat violent\r\nmanner among the men. The \"Virginia Gazette\" for that time states\r\nthat, \"after the officers had received Colonel Henry's kind answer to\r\ntheir address, they insisted upon his dining with them at the Raleigh\r\nTavern, before his departure; and after the dinner, a number of them\r\nproposed escorting him out of town, but were prevented by some\r\nuneasiness getting among the soldiery, who assembled in a tumultuous\r\nmanner and demanded their discharge, and declared their unwillingness\r\nto serve under any other commander. Upon which Colonel Henry found it\r\nnecessary to stay a night longer in town, which he spent in visiting\r\nthe several barracks; and used every argument in his power with the\r\nsoldiery to lay aside their imprudent resolution, and to continue in\r\nthe service, which he had quitted from motives in which his honor\r\nalone was concerned.\"[222] Moreover, several days after he had left\r\nthe camp altogether and had returned to his home, he was followed by\r\nan address signed by ninety officers belonging not only to his own\r\nregiment, but to that of Colonel Woodford,--a document which has no\r\nlittle value as presenting strongly one side of contemporary military\r\nopinion respecting Patrick Henry's career as a soldier, and the\r\ntreatment to which he had been subjected.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--Deeply concerned for the good of our country, we\r\n     sincerely lament the unhappy necessity of your resignation,\r\n     and with all the warmth of affection assure you that,\r\n     whatever may have given rise to the indignity lately offered\r\n     to you, we join with the general voice of the people, and\r\n     think it our duty to make this public declaration of our\r\n     high respect for your distinguished merit. To your vigilance\r\n     and judgment, as a senator, this United Continent bears\r\n     ample testimony, while she prosecutes her steady opposition\r\n     to those destructive ministerial measures which your\r\n     eloquence first pointed out and taught to resent, and your\r\n     resolution led forward to resist. To your extensive\r\n     popularity the service, also, is greatly indebted for the\r\n     expedition with which the troops were raised; and while they\r\n     were continued under your command, the firmness, candor, and\r\n     politeness, which formed the complexion of your conduct\r\n     towards them, obtained the signal approbation of the wise\r\n     and virtuous, and will leave upon our minds the most\r\n     grateful impression.\r\n\r\n     Although retired from the immediate concerns of war, we\r\n     solicit the continuance of your kindly attention. We know\r\n     your attachment to the best of causes; we have the fullest\r\n     confidence in your abilities, and in the rectitude of your\r\n     views; and, however willing the envious may be to undermine\r\n     an established reputation, we trust the day will come when\r\n     justice shall prevail, and thereby secure you an honorable\r\n     and happy return to the glorious employment of conducting\r\n     our councils and hazarding your life in the defence of your\r\n     country.[223]\r\n\r\nThe public agitation over the alleged wrong which had thus been done\r\nto Patrick Henry during his brief military career, and which had\r\nbrought that career to its abrupt and painful close, seems to have\r\ncontinued for a considerable time. Throughout the colony the blame was\r\nopenly and bluntly laid upon the Committee of Safety, who, on account\r\nof envy, it was said, had tried \"to bury in obscurity his martial\r\ntalents.\"[224] On the other hand, the course pursued by that\r\ncommittee was ably defended by many, on the ground that Patrick Henry,\r\nwith all his great gifts for civil life, really had no fitness for a\r\nleading military position. One writer asserted that even in the\r\nconvention which had elected Patrick Henry as commander-in-chief, it\r\nwas objected that \"his studies had been directed to civil and not to\r\nmilitary pursuits; that he was totally unacquainted with the art of\r\nwar, and had no knowledge of military discipline; and that such a\r\nperson was very unfit to be at the head of troops who were likely to\r\nbe engaged with a well-disciplined army, commanded by experienced and\r\nable generals.\"[225] In the very middle of the period of his nominal\r\nmilitary service, this opinion of his unfitness was still more\r\nstrongly urged by the chairman of the Committee of Safety, who, on the\r\n24th of December, 1775, said in a letter to Colonel Woodford:--\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, sir, the unlucky step of calling that gentleman\r\n     from our councils, where he was useful, into the field, in\r\n     an important station, the duties of which he must, in the\r\n     nature of things, be an entire stranger to, has given me\r\n     many an anxious and uneasy moment. In consequence of this\r\n     mistaken step, which can't now be retracted or\r\n     remedied,--for he has done nothing worthy of degradation,\r\n     and must keep his rank,--we must be deprived of the service\r\n     of some able officers, whose honor and former ranks will not\r\n     suffer them to act under him in this juncture, when we so\r\n     much need their services.\"[226]\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been, in substance, the impression concerning\r\nPatrick Henry held at that time by at least two friendly and most\r\ncompetent observers, who were then looking on from a distance, and\r\nwho, of course, were beyond the range of any personal or partisan\r\nprejudice upon the subject. Writing from Cambridge, on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1776, before he had received the news of Henry's resignation,\r\nWashington said to Joseph Reed, then at Philadelphia: \"I think my\r\ncountrymen made a capital mistake when they took Henry out of the\r\nsenate to place him in the field; and pity it is that he does not see\r\nthis, and remove every difficulty by a voluntary resignation.\"[227] On\r\nthe 15th of that month, Reed, in reply, gave to Washington this bit of\r\nnews: \"We have some accounts from Virginia that Colonel Henry has\r\nresigned in disgust at not being made a general officer; but it rather\r\ngives satisfaction than otherwise, as his abilities seem better\r\ncalculated for the senate than the field.\"[228]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in all these contemporary judgments upon the alleged\r\nmilitary defects of Patrick Henry, no reader can now fail to note an\r\nembarrassing lack of definiteness, and a tendency to infer that,\r\nbecause that great man was so great in civil life, as a matter of\r\ncourse, he could not be great, also, in military life,--a proposition\r\nthat could be overthrown by numberless historical examples to the\r\ncontrary. It would greatly aid us if we could know precisely what, in\r\nactual experience, were the defects found in Patrick Henry as a\r\nmilitary man, and precisely how these defects were exhibited by him in\r\nthe camp at Williamsburg. In the writings of that period, no\r\nsatisfaction upon this point seems thus far to have been obtained.\r\nThere is, however, a piece of later testimony, derived by authentic\r\ntradition from a prominent member of the Virginia Committee of Safety,\r\nwhich really helps one to understand what may have been the exact\r\ndifficulty with the military character of Patrick Henry, and just why,\r\nalso, it could not be more plainly stated at the time. Clement\r\nCarrington, a son of Paul Carrington, told Hugh Blair Grigsby that the\r\nreal ground of the action of the Committee of Safety \"was the want of\r\ndiscipline in the regiment under the command of Colonel Henry. None\r\ndoubted his courage, or his alacrity to hasten to the field; but it\r\nwas plain that he did not seem to be conscious of the importance of\r\nstrict discipline in the army, but regarded his soldiers as so many\r\ngentlemen who had met to defend their country, and exacted from them\r\nlittle more than the courtesy that was proper among equals. To have\r\nmarched to the sea-board at that time with a regiment of such men,\r\nwould have been to insure their destruction; and it was a thorough\r\nconviction of this truth that prompted the decision of the\r\ncommittee.\"[229]\r\n\r\nYet, even with this explanation, the truth remains that Patrick\r\nHenry, as commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces, never was\r\npermitted to take command, or to see any real service in the field, or\r\nto look upon the face of an armed enemy, or to show, in the only way\r\nin which it could be shown, whether or not he had the gifts of a\r\nmilitary leader in action. As an accomplished and noble-minded\r\nVirginian of our own time has said:--\r\n\r\n     \"It may be doubted whether he possessed those qualities\r\n     which make a wary partisan, and which are so often possessed\r\n     in an eminent degree by uneducated men. Regular fighting\r\n     there was none in the colony, until near the close of the\r\n     war.... The most skilful partisan in the Virginia of that\r\n     day, covered as it was with forests, cut up by streams, and\r\n     beset by predatory bands, would have been the Indian\r\n     warrior; and as a soldier approached that model, would he\r\n     have possessed the proper tactics for the time. That Henry\r\n     would not have made a better Indian fighter than Jay, or\r\n     Livingston, or the Adamses, that he might not have made as\r\n     dashing a partisan as Tarleton or Simcoe, his friends might\r\n     readily afford to concede; but that he evinced, what neither\r\n     Jay, nor Livingston, nor the Adamses did evince, a\r\n     determined resolution to stake his reputation and his life\r\n     on the issue of arms, and that he resigned his commission\r\n     when the post of imminent danger was refused him, exhibit a\r\n     lucid proof that, whatever may have been his ultimate\r\n     fortune, he was not deficient in two grand elements of\r\n     military success,--personal enterprise, and unquestioned\r\n     courage.\"[230]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195] _Hist.

In the midst of the public\r\nengagements and excitements which absorbed him during the previous\r\nyear, his wife, Sarah, the wife of his youth, the mother of his six\r\nchildren, had passed away. His own subsequent release from public\r\nlabor, however bitter in its occasion, must have brought to him a\r\ngreat solace in the few weeks of repose which he then had under his\r\nown roof, with the privilege of ministering to the happiness of his\r\nmotherless children, and of enjoying once more their loving\r\ncompanionship and sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut in such a crisis of his country's fate, such a man as Patrick\r\nHenry could not be permitted long to remain in seclusion; and the\r\npromptness and the heartiness with which he was now summoned back into\r\nthe service of the public as a civilian, after the recent\r\nhumiliations of his military career, were accented, perhaps, on the\r\npart of his neighbors, by something of the fervor of intended\r\ncompensation, if not of intended revenge. For, in the mean time, the\r\nAmerican colonies had been swiftly advancing, along a path strewn with\r\ncorpses and wet with blood, towards the doctrine that a total\r\nseparation from the mother-country,--a thing hitherto contemplated by\r\nthem only as a disaster and a crime,--might after all be neither, but\r\non the contrary, the only resource left to them in their desperate\r\nstruggle for political existence. This supreme question, it was plain,\r\nwas to confront the very next Virginia convention, which was under\r\nappointment to meet early in the coming May. Almost at once,\r\ntherefore, after his return home, Patrick Henry was elected by his\r\nnative county to represent it in that convention.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the 6th of May, the convention gathered at\r\nWilliamsburg for its first meeting. On its roll of members we see many\r\nof those names which have become familiar to us in the progress of\r\nthis history,--the names of those sturdy and well-trained leaders who\r\nguided Virginia during all that stormy period,--Pendleton, Cary,\r\nMason, Nicholas, Bland, the Lees, Mann Page, Dudley Digges, Wythe,\r\nEdmund Randolph, and a few others. For the first time also, on such a\r\nroll, we meet the name of James Madison, an accomplished young\r\npolitical philosopher, then but four years from the inspiring\r\ninstruction of President Witherspoon at Princeton. But while a few\r\nvery able men had places in that convention, it was, at the time, by\r\nsome observers thought to contain an unusually large number of\r\nincompetent persons. Three days after the opening of the session\r\nLandon Carter wrote to Washington:--\r\n\r\n     \"I could have wished that ambition had not so visibly seized\r\n     so much ignorance all over the colony, as it seems to have\r\n     done; for this present convention abounds with too many of\r\n     the inexperienced creatures to navigate our bark on this\r\n     dangerous coast; so that I fear the few skilful pilots who\r\n     have hitherto done tolerably well to keep her clear from\r\n     destruction, will not be able to conduct her with common\r\n     safety any longer.\"[231]\r\n\r\nThe earliest organization of the House was, on the part of the friends\r\nof Patrick Henry, made the occasion for a momentary flash of\r\nresentment against Edmund Pendleton, as the man who was believed by\r\nthem to have been the guiding mind of the Committee of Safety in its\r\nlong series of restraints upon the military activity of their chief.\r\nAt the opening of the convention Pendleton was nominated for its\r\npresident,--a most suitable nomination, and one which under ordinary\r\ncircumstances would have been carried by acclamation. Thomas Johnson,\r\nhowever, a stanch follower of Patrick Henry, at once presented an\r\nopposing candidate; and although Pendleton was elected, he was not\r\nelected without a contest, or without this significant hint that the\r\nfires of indignation against him were still burning in the hearts of a\r\nstrong party in that house and throughout the colony.\r\n\r\nThe convention lasted just two months lacking a day; and in all the\r\ndetail and drudgery of its business, as the journal indicates, Patrick\r\nHenry bore a very large part. In the course of the session, he seems\r\nto have served on perhaps a majority of all its committees. On the 6th\r\nof May, he was made a member of the committee of privileges and\r\nelections; on the 7th, of a committee \"to bring in an ordinance to\r\nencourage the making of salt, saltpetre, and gunpowder;\" on the 8th,\r\nof the committee on \"propositions and grievances;\" on the 21st, of a\r\ncommittee \"to inquire for a proper hospital for the reception and\r\naccommodation of the sick and wounded soldiers;\" on the 22d, of a\r\ncommittee to inquire into the truth of a complaint made by the Indians\r\nrespecting encroachments on their lands; on the 23d, of a committee to\r\nbring in an ordinance for augmenting the ninth regiment, for enlisting\r\nfour troops of horse, and for raising men for the defence of the\r\nfrontier counties; on the 4th of June, of a committee to inquire into\r\nthe causes for the depreciation of paper money in the colony, and into\r\nthe rates at which goods are sold at the public store; on the 14th of\r\nJune, of a committee to prepare an address to be sent by Virginia to\r\nthe Shawanese Indians; on the 15th of June, of a committee to bring in\r\namendments to the ordinance for prescribing a mode of punishment for\r\nthe enemies of America in this colony; and on the 22d of June, of a\r\ncommittee to prepare an ordinance \"for enabling the present\r\nmagistrates to continue the administration of justice, and for\r\nsettling the general mode of proceedings in criminal and other cases.\"\r\nThe journal also mentions his frequent activity in the House in the\r\npresentation of reports from some of these committees: for example,\r\nfrom the committee on propositions and grievances, on the 16th of May,\r\non the 22d of May, and on the 15th of June. On the latter occasion, he\r\nmade to the House three detailed reports on as many different\r\ntopics.[232]\r\n\r\nOf course, the question overshadowing all others in that convention\r\nwas the question of independence. General Charles Lee, whose military\r\nduties just then detained him at Williamsburg, and who was intently\r\nwatching the currents of political thought in all the colonies,\r\nassured Washington, in a letter written on the 10th of May, that \"a\r\nnoble spirit\" possessed the convention; and that the members were\r\n\"almost unanimous for independence,\" the only disagreement being \"in\r\ntheir sentiments about the mode.\"[233] That Patrick Henry was in favor\r\nof independence hardly needs to be mentioned; yet it does need to be\r\nmentioned that he was among those who disagreed with some of his\r\nassociates \"about the mode.\" While he was as eager and as resolute\r\nfor independence as any man, he doubted whether the time had then\r\nfully come for declaring independence. He thought that the declaration\r\nshould be so timed as to secure, beyond all doubt, two great\r\nconditions of success,--first, the firm union of the colonies\r\nthemselves, and secondly, the friendship of foreign powers,\r\nparticularly of France and Spain. For these reasons, he would have had\r\nindependence delayed until a confederation of the colonies could be\r\nestablished by written articles, which, he probably supposed, would\r\ntake but a few weeks; and also until American agents could have time\r\nto negotiate with the French and Spanish courts.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the session, General Charles Lee, who was hot for\r\nan immediate declaration of independence, seems to have had a\r\nconversation upon the subject with Patrick Henry, during which the\r\nlatter stated his reasons for some postponement of the measure. This\r\nled General Lee, on the following day, to write to Henry a letter\r\nwhich is really remarkable, some passages from which will help us the\r\nbetter to understand the public situation, as well as Patrick Henry's\r\nattitude towards it:--\r\n\r\n                                       WILLIAMSBURG, May 7, 1776.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--If I had not the highest opinion of your\r\n     character and liberal way of thinking, I should not venture\r\n     to address myself to you. And if I were not equally\r\n     persuaded of the great weight and influence which the\r\n     transcendent abilities you possess must naturally confer, I\r\n     should not give myself the trouble of writing, nor you the\r\n     trouble of reading this long letter. Since our conversation\r\n     yesterday, my thoughts have been solely employed on the\r\n     great question, whether independence ought or ought not to\r\n     be immediately declared. Having weighed the argument on both\r\n     sides, I am clearly of the opinion that we must, as we value\r\n     the liberties of America, or even her existence, without a\r\n     moment's delay declare for independence.... The objection\r\n     you made yesterday, if I understood you rightly, to an\r\n     immediate declaration, was by many degrees the most\r\n     specious, indeed, it is the only tolerable, one that I have\r\n     yet heard. You say, and with great justice, that we ought\r\n     previously to have felt the pulse of France and Spain. I\r\n     more than believe, I am almost confident, that it has been\r\n     done.... But admitting that we are utter strangers to their\r\n     sentiments on the subject, and that we run some risk of this\r\n     declaration being coldly received by these powers, such is\r\n     our situation that the risk must be ventured.\r\n\r\n     On one side there are the most probable chances of our\r\n     success, founded on the certain advantages which must\r\n     manifest themselves to French understandings by a treaty of\r\n     alliance with America.... The superior commerce and marine\r\n     force of England were evidently established on the monopoly\r\n     of her American trade. The inferiority of France, in these\r\n     two capital points, consequently had its source in the same\r\n     origin. Any deduction from this monopoly must bring down her\r\n     rival in proportion to this deduction. The French are and\r\n     always have been sensible of these great truths.... But\r\n     allowing that there can be no certainty, but mere chances,\r\n     in our favor, I do insist upon it that these chances render\r\n     it our duty to adopt the measure, as, by procrastination,\r\n     our ruin is inevitable. Should it now be determined to wait\r\n     the result of a previous formal negotiation with France, a\r\n     whole year must pass over our heads before we can be\r\n     acquainted with the result. In the mean time, we are to\r\n     struggle through a campaign, without arms, ammunition, or\r\n     any one necessary of war. Disgrace and defeat will\r\n     infallibly ensue; the soldiers and officers will become so\r\n     disappointed that they will abandon their colors, and\r\n     probably never be persuaded to make another effort.\r\n\r\n     But there is another consideration still more cogent. I can\r\n     assure you that the spirit of the people cries out for this\r\n     declaration; the military, in particular, men and officers,\r\n     are outrageous on the subject; and a man of your excellent\r\n     discernment need not be told how dangerous it would be, in\r\n     our present circumstances, to dally with the spirit, or\r\n     disappoint the expectations, of the bulk of the people. May\r\n     not despair, anarchy, and final submission be the bitter\r\n     fruits? I am firmly persuaded that they will; and, in this\r\n     persuasion, I most devoutly pray that you may not merely\r\n     recommend, but positively lay injunctions on, your servants\r\n     in Congress to embrace a measure so necessary to our\r\n     salvation.\r\n\r\n                                     Yours, most sincerely,\r\n                                               CHARLES LEE.[234]\r\n\r\nJust eight days after that letter was written, the Virginia convention\r\ntook what may, at first glance, seem to be the precise action therein\r\ndescribed as necessary; and moreover, they did so under the\r\ninfluence, in part, of Patrick Henry's powerful advocacy of it. On the\r\n15th of May, after considerable debate, one hundred and twelve members\r\nbeing present, the convention unanimously resolved,\r\n\r\n     \"That the delegates appointed to represent this colony in\r\n     General Congress be instructed to propose to that\r\n     respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and\r\n     independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or\r\n     dependence upon, the crown or Parliament of Great Britain;\r\n     and that they give the assent of this colony to such\r\n     declaration, and to whatever measures may be thought proper\r\n     and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign alliances\r\n     and a confederation of the colonies, at such time, and in\r\n     the manner, as to them shall seem best: provided, that the\r\n     power of forming government for, and the regulations of the\r\n     internal concerns of, each colony, be left to the respective\r\n     colonial legislatures.\"[235]\r\n\r\nOn the testimony of Edmund Randolph, who was a member of the\r\nconvention, it is now known that this momentous resolution \"was drawn\r\nby Pendleton, was offered in convention by Nelson, and was advocated\r\non the floor by Henry.\"[236] Any one who will carefully study it,\r\nhowever, will discover that this resolution was the result of a\r\ncompromise; and especially, that it is so framed as to meet Patrick\r\nHenry's views, at least to the extent of avoiding the demand for an\r\nimmediate declaration, and of leaving it to Congress to determine the\r\ntime and manner of making it. Accordingly, in letters of his, written\r\nfive days afterward to his most intimate friends in Congress, we see\r\nthat his mind was still full of anxiety about the two great\r\nprerequisites,--a certified union among the colonies, and a friendly\r\narrangement with France. \"Ere this reaches you,\" he wrote to Richard\r\nHenry Lee, \"our resolution for separating from Britain will be handed\r\nyou by Colonel Nelson. Your sentiments as to the necessary progress of\r\nthis great affair correspond with mine. For may not France, ignorant\r\nof the great advantages to her commerce we intend to offer, and of the\r\npermanency of that separation which is to take place, be allured by\r\nthe partition you mention? To anticipate, therefore, the efforts of\r\nthe enemy by sending instantly American ambassadors to France, seems\r\nto me absolutely necessary. Delay may bring on us total ruin. But is\r\nnot a confederacy of our States previously necessary?\"[237]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, he wrote, also, a letter to John Adams, in which he\r\ndeveloped still more vigorously his views as to the true order in\r\nwhich the three great measures,--confederation, foreign alliances, and\r\nindependence,--should be dealt with:--\r\n\r\n     \"Before this reaches you, the resolution for finally\r\n     separating from Britain will be handed to Congress by\r\n     Colonel Nelson. I put up with it in the present form for the\r\n     sake of unanimity. 'T is not quite so pointed as I could\r\n     wish. Excuse me for telling you of what I think of immense\r\n     importance; 't is to anticipate the enemy at the French\r\n     court. The half of our continent offered to France, may\r\n     induce her to aid our destruction, which she certainly has\r\n     the power to accomplish. I know the free trade with all the\r\n     States would be more beneficial to her than any territorial\r\n     possessions she might acquire. But pressed, allured, as she\r\n     will be,--but, above all, ignorant of the great thing we\r\n     mean to offer,--may we not lose her? The consequence is\r\n     dreadful. Excuse me again. The confederacy:--that must\r\n     precede an open declaration of independency and foreign\r\n     alliances. Would it not be sufficient to confine it, for the\r\n     present, to the objects of offensive and defensive nature,\r\n     and a guaranty of the respective colonial rights? If a\r\n     minute arrangement of things is attempted, such as equal\r\n     representation, etc., etc., you may split and divide;\r\n     certainly will delay the French alliance, which with me is\r\n     everything.\"[238]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, many of the people of Virginia had received\r\nwith enthusiastic approval the news of the great step taken by their\r\nconvention on the 15th of May. Thus \"on the day following,\" says the\r\n\"Virginia Gazette,\" published at Williamsburg, \"the troops in this\r\ncity, with the train of artillery, were drawn up and went through\r\ntheir firings and various other military manoeuvres, with the greatest\r\nexactness; a continental union flag was displayed upon the capitol;\r\nand in the evening many of the inhabitants illuminated their\r\nhouses.\"[239] Moreover, the great step taken by the Virginia\r\nconvention, on the day just mentioned, committed that body to the duty\r\nof taking at once certain other steps of supreme importance. They were\r\nabout to cast off the government of Great Britain: it was necessary\r\nfor them, therefore, to provide some government to be put in the place\r\nof it. Accordingly, in the very same hour in which they instructed\r\ntheir delegates in Congress to propose a declaration of independence,\r\nthey likewise resolved, \"That a committee be appointed to prepare a\r\ndeclaration of rights, and such a plan of government as will be most\r\nlikely to maintain peace and order in this colony, and secure\r\nsubstantial and equal liberty to the people.\"[240]\r\n\r\nOf this committee, Patrick Henry was a member; and with him were\r\nassociated Archibald Cary, Henry Lee, Nicholas, Edmund Randolph,\r\nBland, Dudley Digges, Paul Carrington, Mann Page, Madison, George\r\nMason, and others. The two tasks before the committee--that of\r\ndrafting a statement of rights, and that of drafting a constitution\r\nfor the new State of Virginia--must have pressed heavily upon its\r\nleading members. In the work of creating a new state government,\r\nVirginia was somewhat in advance of the other colonies; and for this\r\nreason, as well as on account of its general preëminence among the\r\ncolonies, the course which it should take in this crisis was watched\r\nwith extraordinary attention. John Adams said, at the time, \"We all\r\nlook up to Virginia for examples.\"[241] Besides, in Virginia itself,\r\nas well as in the other colonies, there was an unsettled question as\r\nto the nature of the state governments which were then to be\r\ninstituted. Should they be strongly aristocratic and conservative,\r\nwith a possible place left for the monarchical feature; or should the\r\npopular elements in each colony be more largely recognized, and a\r\ndecidedly democratic character given to these new constitutions? On\r\nthis question, two strong parties existed in Virginia. In the first\r\nplace, there were the old aristocratic families, and those who\r\nsympathized with them. These people, numerous, rich, cultivated,\r\ninfluential, in objecting to the unfair encroachments of British\r\nauthority, had by no means intended to object to the nature of the\r\nBritish constitution, and would have been pleased to see that\r\nconstitution, in all its essential features, retained in Virginia.\r\nThis party was led by such men as Robert Carter Nicholas, Carter\r\nBraxton, and Edmund Pendleton. In the second place, there were the\r\ndemocrats, the reformers, the radicals,--who were inclined to take the\r\nopportunity furnished by Virginia's rejection of British authority as\r\nthe occasion for rejecting, within the new State of Virginia, all the\r\naristocratic and monarchical features of the British Constitution\r\nitself. This party was led by such men as Patrick Henry, Richard\r\nHenry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, and George Mason. Which party was to\r\nsucceed in stamping its impress the more strongly on the new plan for\r\ngovernment in Virginia?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is important to observe that, on this very question\r\nthen at issue in Virginia, two pamphlets, taking opposite sides, were,\r\njust at that moment, attracting the notice of Virginians,--both\r\npamphlets being noble in tone, of considerable learning, very\r\nsuggestive, and very well expressed. The first, entitled \"Thoughts on\r\nGovernment,\" though issued anonymously, was soon known to be by John\r\nAdams. It advocated the formation of state constitutions on the\r\ndemocratic model; a lower house elected for a single year by the\r\npeople; this house to elect an upper house of twenty or thirty\r\nmembers, who were to have a negative on the lower house, and to serve,\r\nlikewise, for a single year; these two houses to elect a governor, who\r\nwas to have a negative on them both, and whose term of office should\r\nalso end with the year; while the judges, and all other officers,\r\ncivil or military, were either to be appointed by the governor with\r\nthe advice of the upper house, or to be chosen directly by the two\r\nhouses themselves.[242] The second pamphlet, which was in part a reply\r\nto the first, was entitled \"Address to the Convention of the Colony\r\nand Ancient Dominion of Virginia, on the subject of Government in\r\ngeneral, and recommending a particular form to their consideration.\"\r\nIt purported to be by \"A native of the Colony.\" Although the pamphlet\r\nwas sent into Virginia under strong recommendations from Carter\r\nBraxton, one of the Virginian delegates in Congress, the authorship\r\nwas then unknown to the public. It advocated the formation of state\r\nconstitutions on a model far less democratic: first, a lower house,\r\nthe members of which were to be elected for three years by the people;\r\nsecondly, an upper house of twenty-four members, to be elected for\r\nlife by the lower house; thirdly, a governor, to be elected for life\r\nby the lower house; fourthly, all judges, all military officers, and\r\nall inferior civil ones, to be appointed by the governor.[243]\r\n\r\nSuch was the question over which the members of the committee,\r\nappointed on the 15th of May, must soon have come into sharp conflict.\r\nAt its earliest meetings, apparently, Henry found the aristocratic\r\ntendencies of some of his associates so strong as to give him\r\nconsiderable uneasiness; and by his letter to John Adams, written on\r\nthe 20th of the month, we may see that he was then complaining of the\r\nlack of any associate of adequate ability on his own side of the\r\nquestion. When we remember, however, that both James Madison and\r\nGeorge Mason were members of that committee, we can but read Patrick\r\nHenry's words with some astonishment.[244] The explanation is\r\nprobably to be found in the fact that Madison was not placed on the\r\ncommittee until the 16th, and, being very young and very unobtrusive,\r\ndid not at first make his true weight felt; while Mason was not placed\r\non the committee until the working day just before Henry's letter was\r\nwritten, and very likely had not then met with it, and may not, at the\r\nmoment, have been remembered by Henry as a member of it. At any rate,\r\nthis is the way in which our eager Virginia democrat, in that moment\r\nof anxious conflict over the form of the future government of his\r\nState, poured out his anxieties to his two most congenial political\r\nfriends in Congress. To Richard Henry Lee he wrote:--\r\n\r\n     \"The grand work of forming a constitution for Virginia is\r\n     now before the convention, where your love of equal liberty\r\n     and your skill in public counsels might so eminently serve\r\n     the cause of your country. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I fear\r\n     too great a bias to aristocracy prevails among the opulent.\r\n     I own myself a democratic on the plan of our admired friend,\r\n     J. Adams, whose pamphlet I read with great pleasure. A\r\n     performance from Philadelphia is just come here, ushered in,\r\n     I'm told, by a colleague of yours, B----, and greatly\r\n     recommended by him. I don't like it. Is the author a Whig?\r\n     One or two expressions in the book make me ask. I wish to\r\n     divide you, and have you here to animate, by your manly\r\n     eloquence, the sometimes drooping spirits of our country,\r\n     and in Congress to be the ornament of your native country,\r\n     and the vigilant, determined foe of tyranny. To give you\r\n     colleagues of kindred sentiments, is my wish. I doubt you\r\n     have them not at present. A confidential account of the\r\n     matter to Colonel Tom,[245] desiring him to use it according\r\n     to his discretion, might greatly serve the public and\r\n     vindicate Virginia from suspicions. Vigor, animation, and\r\n     all the powers of mind and body must now be summoned and\r\n     collected together into one grand effort. Moderation,\r\n     falsely so called, hath nearly brought on us final ruin. And\r\n     to see those, who have so fatally advised us, still guiding,\r\n     or at least sharing, our public counsels, alarms me.\"[246]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, he wrote as follows to John Adams:--\r\n\r\n                                     WILLIAMSBURG, May 20, 1776.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,--Your favor, with the pamphlet, came safe to\r\n     hand. I am exceedingly obliged to you for it; and I am not\r\n     without hopes it may produce good here, where there is among\r\n     most of our opulent families a strong bias to aristocracy. I\r\n     tell my friends you are the author. Upon that supposition, I\r\n     have two reasons for liking the book. The sentiments are\r\n     precisely the same I have long since taken up, and they come\r\n     recommended by you. Go on, my dear friend, to assail the\r\n     strongholds of tyranny; and in whatever form oppression may\r\n     be found, may those talents and that firmness, which have\r\n     achieved so much for America, be pointed against it....\r\n\r\n     Our convention is now employed in the great work of forming\r\n     a constitution. My most esteemed republican form has many\r\n     and powerful enemies. A silly thing, published in\r\n     Philadelphia, by a native of Virginia, has just made its\r\n     appearance here, strongly recommended, 't is said, by one of\r\n     our delegates now with you,--Braxton. His reasonings upon\r\n     and distinction between private and public virtue, are weak,\r\n     shallow, evasive, and the whole performance an affront and\r\n     disgrace to this country; and, by one expression, I suspect\r\n     his whiggism.\r\n\r\n     Our session will be very long, during which I cannot count\r\n     upon one coadjutor of talents equal to the task. Would to\r\n     God you and your Sam Adams were here! It shall be my\r\n     incessant study so to form our portrait of government that a\r\n     kindred with New England may be discerned in it; and if all\r\n     your excellences cannot be preserved, yet I hope to retain\r\n     so much of the likeness, that posterity shall pronounce us\r\n     descended from the same stock. I shall think perfection is\r\n     obtained, if we have your approbation.\r\n\r\n     I am forced to conclude; but first, let me beg to be\r\n     presented to my ever-esteemed S. Adams. Adieu, my dear sir;\r\n     may God preserve you, and give you every good thing.\r\n\r\n                                                  P. HENRY, JR.\r\n\r\n     P. S. Will you and S. A. now and then write?[247]\r\n\r\nTo this hearty and even brotherly letter John Adams wrote from\r\nPhiladelphia, on the 3d of June, a fitting reply, in the course of\r\nwhich he said, with respect to Henry's labors in making a constitution\r\nfor Virginia: \"The subject is of infinite moment, and perhaps more\r\nthan adequate to the abilities of any man in America. I know of none\r\nso competent to the task as the author of the first Virginia\r\nresolutions against the Stamp Act, who will have the glory with\r\nposterity of beginning and concluding this great revolution. Happy\r\nVirginia, whose constitution is to be framed by so masterly a\r\nbuilder!\" Then, with respect to the aristocratic features in the\r\nConstitution, as proposed by \"A Native of the Colony,\" John Adams\r\nexclaims:--\r\n\r\n     \"The dons, the bashaws, the grandees, the patricians, the\r\n     sachems, the nabobs, call them by what name you please,\r\n     sigh, and groan, and fret, and sometimes stamp, and foam,\r\n     and curse, but all in vain. The decree is gone forth, and it\r\n     cannot be recalled, that a more equal liberty than has\r\n     prevailed in other parts of the earth, must be established\r\n     in America. That exuberance of pride which has produced an\r\n     insolent domination in a few, a very few, opulent,\r\n     monopolizing families, will be brought down nearer to the\r\n     confines of reason and moderation than they have been used\r\n     to.... I shall ever be happy in receiving your advice by\r\n     letter, until I can be more completely so in seeing you here\r\n     in person, which I hope will be soon.\"[248]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June, the convention adopted without a dissenting voice\r\nits celebrated \"declaration of rights,\" a compact, luminous, and\r\npowerful statement, in sixteen articles, of those great fundamental\r\nrights that were henceforth to be \"the basis and foundation of\r\ngovernment\" in Virginia, and were to stamp their character upon that\r\nconstitution on which the committee were even then engaged. Perhaps\r\nno political document of that time is more worthy of study in\r\nconnection with the genesis, not only of our state constitutions, but\r\nof that of the nation likewise. That the first fourteen articles of\r\nthe declaration were written by George Mason has never been disputed:\r\nthat he also wrote the fifteenth and the sixteenth articles is now\r\nclaimed by his latest and ablest biographer,[249] but in opposition to\r\nthe testimony of Edmund Randolph, who was a member both of the\r\nconvention itself and of the particular committee in charge of the\r\ndeclaration, and who has left on record the statement that those\r\narticles were the work of Patrick Henry.[250] The fifteenth article\r\nwas in these words: \"That no free government, or the blessings of\r\nliberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to\r\njustice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by\r\nfrequent recurrence to fundamental principles.\" The sixteenth article\r\nis an assertion of the doctrine of religious liberty,--the first time\r\nthat it was ever asserted by authority in Virginia. The original\r\ndraft, in which the writer followed very closely the language used on\r\nthat subject by the Independents in the Assembly of Westminster, stood\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"That religion, or the duty we owe our Creator, and the\r\n     manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason\r\n     and conviction, and not by force or violence; and,\r\n     therefore, that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration\r\n     in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of\r\n     conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate,\r\n     unless, under color of religion, any man disturb the peace,\r\n     the happiness, or the safety of society; and that it is the\r\n     mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance, love,\r\n     and charity towards each other.\"[251]\r\n\r\nThe historic significance of this stately assertion of religious\r\nliberty in Virginia can be felt only by those who remember that, at\r\nthat time, the Church of England was the established church of\r\nVirginia, and that the laws of Virginia then restrained the exercise\r\nthere of every form of religious dissent, unless compliance had been\r\nmade with the conditions of the toleration act of the first year of\r\nWilliam and Mary. At the very moment, probably, when the committee\r\nwere engaged in considering the tremendous innovation contained in\r\nthis article, \"sundry persons of the Baptist church in the county of\r\nPrince William\" were putting their names to a petition earnestly\r\nimploring the convention, \"That they be allowed to worship God in\r\ntheir own way, without interruption; that they be permitted to\r\nmaintain their own ministers and none others; that they may be\r\nmarried, buried, and the like, without paying the clergy of other\r\ndenominations;\" and that, by the concession to them of such religious\r\nfreedom, they be enabled to \"unite with their brethren, and to the\r\nutmost of their ability promote the common cause\" of political\r\nfreedom.[252] Of course the adoption of the sixteenth article\r\nvirtually carried with it every privilege which these people asked\r\nfor. The author of that article, whether it was George Mason or\r\nPatrick Henry, was a devout communicant of the established church of\r\nVirginia; and thus, the first great legislative act for the reform of\r\nthe civil constitution of that church, and for its deliverance from\r\nthe traditional duty and curse of persecution, was an act which came\r\nfrom within the church itself.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 24th of June, the committee, through Archibald Cary,\r\nsubmitted to the convention their plan of a constitution for the new\r\nState of Virginia; and on Saturday, the 29th of June, this plan passed\r\nits third reading, and was unanimously adopted. A glance at the\r\ndocument will show that in the sharp struggle between the aristocratic\r\nand the democratic forces in the convention, the latter had signally\r\ntriumphed. It provided for a lower House of Assembly, whose members\r\nwere to be elected annually by the people, in the proportion of two\r\nmembers from each county; for an upper House of Assembly to consist of\r\ntwenty-four members, who were to be elected annually by the people, in\r\nthe proportion of one member from each of the senatorial districts\r\ninto which the several counties should be grouped; for a governor, to\r\nbe elected annually by joint ballot of both houses, and not to\r\n\"continue in that office longer than three years successively,\" nor\r\nthen to be eligible again for the office until after the lapse of four\r\nyears from the close of his previous term; for a privy council of\r\neight members, for delegates in Congress, and for judges in the\r\nseveral courts, all to be elected by joint ballot of the two Houses;\r\nfor justices of the peace to be appointed by the governor and the\r\nprivy council; and, finally, for an immediate election, by the\r\nconvention itself, of a governor, and a privy council, and such other\r\nofficers as might be necessary for the introduction of the new\r\ngovernment.[253]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the last provision of this Constitution, the\r\nconvention at once proceeded to cast their ballots for governor, with\r\nthe following result:--\r\n\r\n  For Patrick Henry     60\r\n  For Thomas Nelson     45\r\n  For John Page          1\r\n\r\nBy resolution, Patrick Henry was then formally declared to be the\r\ngovernor of the commonwealth of Virginia, to continue in office until\r\nthe close of that session of the Assembly which should be held after\r\nthe end of the following March.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which this action was taken, he wrote, in reply to\r\nthe official notice of his election, the following letter of\r\nacceptance,--a graceful, manly, and touching composition:--\r\n\r\n     TO THE HONORABLE THE PRESIDENT AND HOUSE OF CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--The vote of this day, appointing me governor of\r\n     this commonwealth, has been notified to me, in the most\r\n     polite and obliging manner, by George Mason, Henry Lee,\r\n     Dudley Digges, John Blair, and Bartholomew Dandridge,\r\n     Esquires.\r\n\r\n     A sense of the high and unmerited honor conferred upon me by\r\n     the convention fills my heart with gratitude, which I trust\r\n     my whole life will manifest. I take this earliest\r\n     opportunity to express my thanks, which I wish to convey to\r\n     you, gentlemen, in the strongest terms of acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n     When I reflect that the tyranny of the British king and\r\n     parliament hath kindled a formidable war, now raging\r\n     throughout the wide-extended continent, and in the\r\n     operations of which this commonwealth must bear so great a\r\n     part, and that from the events of this war the lasting\r\n     happiness or misery of a great proportion of the human\r\n     species will finally result; that, in order to preserve this\r\n     commonwealth from anarchy, and its attendant ruin, and to\r\n     give vigor to our councils and effect to all our measures,\r\n     government hath been necessarily assumed and new modelled;\r\n     that it is exposed to numberless hazards and perils in its\r\n     infantine state; that it can never attain to maturity or\r\n     ripen into firmness, unless it is guarded by affectionate\r\n     assiduity, and managed by great abilities,--I lament my want\r\n     of talents; I feel my mind filled with anxiety and\r\n     uneasiness to find myself so unequal to the duties of that\r\n     important station to which I am called by favor of my fellow\r\n     citizens at this truly critical conjuncture. The errors of\r\n     my conduct shall be atoned for, so far as I am able, by\r\n     unwearied endeavors to secure the freedom and happiness of\r\n     our common country.\r\n\r\n     I shall enter upon the duties of my office whenever you,\r\n     gentlemen, shall be pleased to direct, relying upon the\r\n     known wisdom and virtue of your honorable house to supply my\r\n     defects, and to give permanency and success to that system\r\n     of government which you have formed, and which is so wisely\r\n     calculated to secure equal liberty, and advance human\r\n     happiness.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, gentlemen, your most obedient and\r\n     very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                 P.

The salary attached to the position was\r\nfixed at one thousand pounds sterling for the year; and the governor\r\nwas invited to take up his residence in the palace at Williamsburg. No\r\none had resided in the palace since Lord Dunmore had fled from it; and\r\nthe people of Virginia could hardly fail to note the poetic\r\nretribution whereby the very man whom, fourteen months before, Lord\r\nDunmore had contemptuously denounced as \"a certain Patrick Henry of\r\nHanover County,\" should now become Lord Dunmore's immediate successor\r\nin that mansion of state, and should be able, if he chose, to write\r\nproclamations against Lord Dunmore upon the same desk on which Lord\r\nDunmore had so recently written the proclamation against himself.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to bring their congratulations to the new governor,\r\nwere his devoted friends, the first and second regiments of Virginia,\r\nwho told him that they viewed \"with the sincerest sentiments of\r\nrespect and joy\" his accession to the highest office in the State, and\r\nwho gave to him likewise this affectionate assurance: \"our hearts are\r\nwilling, and arms ready, to maintain your authority as chief\r\nmagistrate.\"[256] On the 29th of July, the erratic General Charles\r\nLee, who was then in Charleston, sent on his congratulations in a\r\nletter amusing for its tart cordiality and its peppery playfulness:--\r\n\r\n     \"I most sincerely congratulate you on the noble conduct of\r\n     your countrymen; and I congratulate your country on having\r\n     citizens deserving of the high honor to which you are\r\n     exalted. For the being elected to the first magistracy of a\r\n     free people is certainly the pinnacle of human glory; and I\r\n     am persuaded that they could not have made a happier choice.\r\n     Will you excuse me,--but I am myself so extremely\r\n     democratical, that I think it a fault in your constitution\r\n     that the governor should be eligible for three years\r\n     successively. It appears to me that a government of three\r\n     years may furnish an opportunity of acquiring a very\r\n     dangerous influence. But this is not the worst.... A man who\r\n     is fond of office, and has his eye upon reëlection, will be\r\n     courting favor and popularity at the expense of his duty....\r\n     There is a barbarism crept in among us that extremely shocks\r\n     me: I mean those tinsel epithets with which (I come in for\r\n     my share) we are so beplastered,--'his excellency,' and 'his\r\n     honor,' 'the honorable president of the honorable congress,'\r\n     or 'the honorable convention.' This fulsome, nauseating\r\n     cant may be well enough adapted to barbarous monarchies, or\r\n     to gratify the adulterated pride of the 'magnifici' in\r\n     pompous aristocracies; but in a great, free, manly, equal\r\n     commonwealth, it is quite abominable. For my own part, I\r\n     would as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as the\r\n     'excellency' with which I am daily crammed. How much more\r\n     true dignity was there in the simplicity of address amongst\r\n     the Romans,--'Marcus Tullius Cicero,' 'Decimo Bruto\r\n     Imperatori,' or 'Caio Marcello Consuli,'--than to 'his\r\n     excellency Major-General Noodle,' or to 'the honorable John\r\n     Doodle.' ... If, therefore, I should sometimes address a\r\n     letter to you without the 'excellency' tacked, you must not\r\n     esteem it a mark of personal or official disrespect, but the\r\n     reverse.\"[257]\r\n\r\nOf all the words of congratulation which poured in upon the new\r\ngovernor, probably none came so straight from the heart, and none\r\ncould have been quite so sweet to him, as those which, on the 12th of\r\nAugust, were uttered by some of the persecuted dissenters in Virginia,\r\nwho, in many an hour of need, had learned to look up to Patrick Henry\r\nas their strong and splendid champion, in the legislature and in the\r\ncourts. On the date just mentioned, \"the ministers and delegates of\r\nthe Baptist churches\" of the State, being met in convention at Louisa,\r\nsent to him this address:--\r\n\r\n     MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,--As your advancement to the\r\n     honorable and important station as governor of this\r\n     commonwealth affords us unspeakable pleasure, we beg leave\r\n     to present your excellency with our most cordial\r\n     congratulations.\r\n\r\n     Your public virtues are such that we are under no temptation\r\n     to flatter you. Virginia has done honor to her judgment in\r\n     appointing your excellency to hold the reins of government\r\n     at this truly critical conjuncture, as you have always\r\n     distinguished yourself by your zeal and activity for her\r\n     welfare, in whatever department has been assigned you.\r\n\r\n     As a religious community, we have nothing to request of you.\r\n     Your constant attachment to the glorious cause of liberty\r\n     and the rights of conscience, leaves us no room to doubt of\r\n     your excellency's favorable regards while we worthily demean\r\n     ourselves.\r\n\r\n     May God Almighty continue you long, very long, a public\r\n     blessing to this your native country, and, after a life of\r\n     usefulness here, crown you with immortal felicity in the\r\n     world to come.\r\n\r\n                    Signed by order: JEREMIAH WALKER, _Moderator_.\r\n                                     JOHN WILLIAMS, _Clerk_.\r\n\r\nTo these loving and jubilant words, the governor replied in an\r\noff-hand letter, the deep feeling of which is not the less evident\r\nbecause it is restrained,--a letter which is as choice and noble in\r\ndiction as it is in thought:--\r\n\r\n     TO THE MINISTERS AND DELEGATES OF THE BAPTIST CHURCHES, AND\r\n     THE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNION.\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--I am exceedingly obliged to you for your very\r\n     kind address, and the favorable sentiments you are pleased\r\n     to entertain respecting my conduct and the principles which\r\n     have directed it. My constant endeavor shall be to guard the\r\n     rights of all my fellow-citizens from every encroachment.\r\n\r\n     I am happy to find a catholic spirit prevailing in our\r\n     country, and that those religious distinctions, which\r\n     formerly produced some heats, are now forgotten. Happy must\r\n     every friend to virtue and America feel himself, to perceive\r\n     that the only contest among us, at this most critical and\r\n     important period, is, who shall be foremost to preserve our\r\n     religious and civil liberties.\r\n\r\n     My most earnest wish is, that Christian charity,\r\n     forbearance, and love, may unite all our different\r\n     persuasions, as brethren who must perish or triumph\r\n     together; and I trust that the time is not far distant when\r\n     we shall greet each other as the peaceable possessors of\r\n     that just and equal system of liberty adopted by the last\r\n     convention, and in support of which may God crown our arms\r\n     with success.\r\n\r\n     I am, gentlemen, your most obedient and very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                              P. HENRY, JUN.[258]\r\n\r\n     August 13, 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which Governor Henry was sworn into office, the\r\nconvention finally adjourned, having made provision for the meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly on the first Monday of the following October. In\r\nthe mean time, therefore, all the interests of the State were to be in\r\nthe immediate keeping of the governor and privy council; and, for a\r\npart of that time, as it turned out, the governor himself was disabled\r\nfor service. For we now encounter in the history of Patrick Henry, the\r\nfirst mention of that infirm health from which he seems to have\r\nsuffered, in some degree, during the remaining twenty-three years of\r\nhis life. Before taking full possession of the governor's palace,\r\nwhich had to be made ready for his use, he had likewise to prepare for\r\nthis great change in his life by returning to his home in the county\r\nof Hanover. There he lay ill for some time;[259] and upon his recovery\r\nhe removed with his family to Williamsburg, which continued to be\r\ntheir home for the next three years.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia had been accustomed, for more than a century,\r\nto look upon their governors as personages of very great dignity.\r\nSeveral of those governors had been connected with the English\r\npeerage; all had served in Virginia in a vice-regal capacity; many had\r\nlived there in a sort of vice-regal pomp and magnificence. It is not\r\nto be supposed that Governor Henry would be able or willing to assume\r\nso much state and grandeur as his predecessors had done; and yet he\r\nfelt, and the people of Virginia felt, that in the transition from\r\nroyal to republican forms the dignity of that office should not be\r\nallowed to decline in any important particular. Moreover, as a\r\ncontemporary observer mentions, Patrick Henry had been \"accused by the\r\nbig-wigs of former times as being a coarse and common man, and utterly\r\ndestitute of dignity; and perhaps he wished to show them that they\r\nwere mistaken.\"[260] At any rate, by the testimony of all, he seems to\r\nhave displayed his usual judgment and skill in adapting himself to\r\nthe requirements of his position; and, while never losing his\r\ngentleness and his simplicity of manner, to have borne himself as the\r\nimpersonation, for the time being, of the executive authority of a\r\ngreat and proud commonwealth. He ceased to appear frequently upon the\r\nstreets; and whenever he did appear, he was carefully arrayed in a\r\ndressed wig, in black small-clothes, and in a scarlet cloak; and his\r\npresence and demeanor were such as to sustain, in the popular mind,\r\nthe traditional respect for his high office.\r\n\r\nHe had so far recovered from the illness which had prostrated him\r\nduring the summer, as to be at his post of duty when the General\r\nAssembly of the State began its first session, on Monday, the 7th of\r\nOctober, 1776. His health, however, was still extremely frail; for on\r\nthe 30th of that month he was obliged to notify the House \"that the\r\nlow state of his health rendered him unable to attend to the duties of\r\nhis office, and that his physicians had recommended to him to retire\r\ntherefrom into the country, till he should recover his strength.\"[261]\r\nHis absence seems not to have been very long. By the 16th of November,\r\nas one may infer from entries in the journal of the House,[262] he was\r\nable to resume his official duties.\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn of that year proved to be a dismal period for\r\nthe American cause. Before our eyes, as we now look back over those\r\ndays, there marches this grim procession of dates: August 27, the\r\nbattle of Long Island; August 29, Washington's retreat across East\r\nRiver; September 15, the panic among the American troops at Kip's Bay,\r\nand the American retreat from New York; September 16, the battle of\r\nHarlem Plains; September 20, the burning of New York; October 28, the\r\nbattle of White Plains; November 16, the surrender of Fort Washington;\r\nNovember 20, the abandonment of Fort Lee, followed by Washington's\r\nretreat across the Jerseys. In the midst of these disasters,\r\nWashington found time to write, from the Heights of Harlem, on the 5th\r\nof October, to his old friend, Patrick Henry, congratulating him on\r\nhis election as governor of Virginia and on his recovery from\r\nsickness; explaining the military situation at headquarters; advising\r\nhim about military appointments in Virginia; and especially giving to\r\nhim important suggestions concerning the immediate military defence of\r\nVirginia \"against the enemy's ships and tenders, which,\" as Washington\r\nsays to the governor, \"may go up your rivers in quest of provisions,\r\nor for the purpose of destroying your towns.\"[263] Indeed, Virginia\r\nwas just then exposed to hostile attacks on all sides;[264] and it was\r\nso plain that any attack by water would have found an easy approach to\r\nWilliamsburg, that, in the course of the next few months, the public\r\nrecords and the public stores were removed to Richmond, as being, on\r\nevery account, a \"more secure site.\"[265] Apparently, however, the\r\nprompt recognition of this danger by Governor Henry, early in the\r\nautumn of 1776, and his vigorous military preparations against it,\r\nwere interpreted by some of his political enemies as a sign both of\r\npersonal cowardice and of official self-glorification,--as is\r\nindicated by a letter written by the aged Landon Carter to General\r\nWashington, on the 31st of October, and filled with all manner of\r\ncaustic garrulity and insinuation,--a letter from which it may be\r\nprofitable for us to quote a few sentences, as qualifying somewhat\r\nthat stream of honeyed testimony respecting Patrick Henry which\r\ncommonly flows down upon us so copiously from all that period.\r\n\r\n     \"If I don't err in conjecture,\" says Carter, \"I can't help\r\n     thinking that the head of our Commonwealth has as great a\r\n     palace of fear and apprehension as can possess the heart of\r\n     any being; and if we compare rumor with actual movements, I\r\n     believe it will prove itself to every sensible man. As soon\r\n     as the Congress sent for our first, third, fourth, fifth,\r\n     and sixth regiments to assist you in contest against the\r\n     enemy where they really were ... there got a report among\r\n     the soldiery that Dignity had declared it would not reside\r\n     in Williamsburg without two thousand men under arms to guard\r\n     him. This had like to have occasioned a mutiny. A desertion\r\n     of many from the several companies did follow; boisterous\r\n     fellows resisting, and swearing they would not leave their\r\n     county.... What a finesse of popularity was this?... As soon\r\n     as the regiments were gone, this great man found an interest\r\n     with the council of state, perhaps timorous as himself, to\r\n     issue orders for the militia of twenty-six counties, and\r\n     five companies of a minute battalion, to march to\r\n     Williamsburg, to protect him only against his own fears; and\r\n     to make this the more popular, it was endeavored that the\r\n     House of Delegates should give it a countenance, but, as\r\n     good luck would have it, it was with difficulty\r\n     refused.[266] ... Immediately then, ... a bill is brought in\r\n     to remove the seat of government,--some say, up to Hanover,\r\n     to be called Henry-Town.\"[267]\r\n\r\nThis gossip of a disappointed Virginian aristocrat, in vituperation of\r\nthe public character of Governor Henry, naturally leads us forward in\r\nour story to that more stupendous eruption of gossip which relates, in\r\nthe first instance, to the latter part of December, 1776, and which\r\nalleges that a conspiracy was then formed among certain members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to make Patrick Henry the dictator of Virginia. The\r\nfirst intimation ever given to the public concerning it, was given by\r\nJefferson several years afterward, in his \"Notes on Virginia,\" a\r\nfascinating brochure which was written by him in 1781 and 1782, was\r\nfirst printed privately in Paris in 1784, and was first published in\r\nEngland in 1787, in America in 1788.[268] The essential portions of\r\nhis statement are as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"In December, 1776, our circumstances being much distressed,\r\n     it was proposed in the House of Delegates to create a\r\n     dictator, invested with every power legislative, executive,\r\n     and judiciary, civil and military, of life and death, over\r\n     our persons and over our properties.... One who entered into\r\n     this contest from a pure love of liberty, and a sense of\r\n     injured rights, who determined to make every sacrifice and\r\n     to meet every danger, for the reëstablishment of those\r\n     rights on a firm basis, ... must stand confounded and\r\n     dismayed when he is told that a considerable portion of\" the\r\n     House \"had meditated the surrender of them into a single\r\n     hand, and in lieu of a limited monarchy, to deliver him over\r\n     to a despotic one.... The very thought alone was treason\r\n     against the people; was treason against man in general; as\r\n     riveting forever the chains which bow down their necks, by\r\n     giving to their oppressors a proof, which they would have\r\n     trumpeted through the universe, of the imbecility of\r\n     republican government, in times of pressing danger, to\r\n     shield them from harm.... Those who meant well, of the\r\n     advocates of this measure (and most of them meant well, for\r\n     I know them personally, had been their fellow-laborer in the\r\n     common cause, and had often proved the purity of their\r\n     principles), had been seduced in their judgment by the\r\n     example of an ancient republic, whose constitution and\r\n     circumstances were fundamentally different.\"[269]\r\n\r\nWith that artistic tact and that excellent prudence which seem never\r\nto have failed Jefferson in any of his enterprises for the\r\ndisparagement of his associates, he here avoids, as will be observed,\r\nall mention of the name of the person for whose fatal promotion this\r\nclassic conspiracy was formed,--leaving that interesting item to come\r\nout, as it did many years afterward, when the most of those who could\r\nhave borne testimony upon the subject were in their graves, and when\r\nthe damning stigma could be comfortably fastened to the name of\r\nPatrick Henry without the direct intervention of Jefferson's own\r\nhands. Accordingly, in 1816, a French gentleman, Girardin, a near\r\nneighbor of Jefferson's, who enjoyed \"the incalculable benefit of a\r\nfree access to Mr. Jefferson's library,\"[270] and who wrote the\r\ncontinuation of Burk's \"History of Virginia\" under Jefferson's very\r\neye,[271] gave in that work a highly wrought account of the alleged\r\nconspiracy of December, 1776, as involving \"nothing less than the\r\nsubstitution of a despotic in lieu of a limited monarch;\" and then\r\nproceeded to bring the accusation down from those lurid generalities\r\nof condemnation in which Jefferson himself had cautiously left it, by\r\nadding this sentence: \"That Mr. Henry was the person in view for the\r\ndictatorship, is well ascertained.\"[272]\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1817, William Wirt, whose \"Life of Henry\" was likewise\r\ncomposed under nearly the same inestimable advantages as regards\r\ninstruction and oversight furnished by Jefferson, repeated the fearful\r\ntale, and added some particulars; but, in doing so, Wirt could not\r\nfail--good lawyer and just man, as he was--to direct attention to the\r\nabsence of all evidence of any collusion on the part of Patrick Henry\r\nwith the projected folly and crime.\r\n\r\n     \"Even the heroism of the Virginia legislature,\" says Wirt,\r\n     \"gave way; and, in a season of despair, the mad project of a\r\n     dictator was seriously meditated. That Mr. Henry was thought\r\n     of for this office, has been alleged, and is highly\r\n     probable; but that the project was suggested by him, or even\r\n     received his countenance, I have met with no one who will\r\n     venture to affirm. There is a tradition that Colonel\r\n     Archibald Cary, the speaker of the Senate, was principally\r\n     instrumental in crushing this project; that meeting Colonel\r\n     Syme, the step-brother of Colonel Henry, in the lobby of the\r\n     House, he accosted him very fiercely in terms like these: 'I\r\n     am told that your brother wishes to be dictator. Tell him\r\n     from me, that the day of his appointment shall be the day of\r\n     his death;--for he shall feel my dagger in his heart before\r\n     the sunset of that day.' And the tradition adds that Colonel\r\n     Syme, in great agitation, declared that 'if such a project\r\n     existed, his brother had no hand in it; for that nothing\r\n     could be more foreign to him, than to countenance any office\r\n     which could endanger, in the most distant manner, the\r\n     liberties of his country.' The intrepidity and violence of\r\n     Colonel Cary's character renders the tradition probable; but\r\n     it furnishes no proof of Mr. Henry's implication in the\r\n     scheme.\"[273]\r\n\r\nA disinterested study of this subject, in the light of all the\r\nevidence now attainable, will be likely to convince any one that this\r\nenormous scandal must have been very largely a result of the extreme\r\nlooseness at that time prevailing in the use of the word \"dictator,\"\r\nand of its being employed, on the one side, in an innocent sense, and,\r\non the other side, in a guilty one. In strict propriety, of course,\r\nthe word designates a magistrate created in an emergency of public\r\nperil, and clothed for a time with unlimited power. It is an extreme\r\nremedy, and in itself a remedy extremely dangerous, and can never be\r\ninnocently resorted to except when the necessity for it is\r\nindubitable; and it may well be questioned whether, among people and\r\ninstitutions like our own, a necessity can ever arise which would\r\njustify the temporary grant of unlimited power to any man. If this be\r\ntrue, it follows that no man among us can, without dire political\r\nguilt, ever consent to bestow such power; and that no man can, without\r\nthe same guilt, ever consent to receive it.\r\n\r\nYet it is plain that even among us, between the years 1776 and 1783,\r\nemergencies of terrific public peril did arise, sufficient to justify,\r\nnay, even to compel, the bestowment either upon the governor of some\r\nState, or upon the general of the armies, not of unlimited power,\r\ncertainly, but of extraordinary power,--such extraordinary power, for\r\nexample, as was actually conferred by the Continental Congress, more\r\nthan once, on Washington; as was conferred by the legislature of South\r\nCarolina on Governor John Rutledge; as was repeatedly conferred by the\r\nlegislature of Virginia upon Governor Patrick Henry; and afterward, in\r\nstill higher degree, by the same legislature, on Governor Thomas\r\nJefferson himself. Nevertheless, so loose was the meaning then\r\nattached to the word \"dictator,\" that it was not uncommon for men to\r\nspeak of these very cases as examples of the bestowment of a\r\ndictatorship, and of the exercise of dictatorial power; although, in\r\nevery one of the cases mentioned, there was lacking the essential\r\nfeature of a true dictatorship, namely, the grant of unlimited power\r\nto one man. It is perfectly obvious, likewise, that when, in those\r\ndays, men spoke thus of a dictatorship, and of dictatorial power, they\r\nattached no suggestion of political guilt either to the persons who\r\nbestowed such power, or to the persons who severally accepted it,--the\r\ntacit understanding being that, in every instance, the public danger\r\nrequired and justified some grant of extraordinary power; that no more\r\npower was granted than was necessary; and that the man to whom, in any\r\ncase, the grant was made, was a man to whom, there was good reason to\r\nbelieve, the grant could be made with safety. Obviously, it was upon\r\nthis tacit understanding of its meaning that the word was used, for\r\ninstance, by Edmund Randolph, in 1788, in the Virginia Constitutional\r\nConvention, when, alluding to the extraordinary power bestowed by\r\nCongress on Washington, he said: \"We had an American dictator in\r\n1781.\" Surely, Randolph did not mean to impute political crime, either\r\nto the Congress which made Washington a dictator, or to Washington\r\nhimself who consented to be made one. It was upon the same tacit\r\nunderstanding, also, that Patrick Henry, in reply to Randolph, took up\r\nthe word, and extolled the grant of dictatorial power to Washington on\r\nthe occasion referred to: \"In making a dictator,\" said Henry, \"we\r\nfollowed the example of the most glorious, magnanimous, and skilful\r\nnations. In great dangers, this power has been given. Rome has\r\nfurnished us with an illustrious example. America found a person for\r\nthat trust: she looked to Virginia for him. We gave a dictatorial\r\npower to hands that used it gloriously, and which were rendered more\r\nglorious by surrendering it up.\"[274]\r\n\r\nThus it is apparent that the word \"dictator\" was frequently used in\r\nthose times in a sense perfectly innocent. As all men know, however,\r\nthe word is one capable of suggesting the possibilities of dreadful\r\npolitical crime; and it is not hard to see how, when employed by one\r\nperson to describe the bestowment and acceptance of extraordinary\r\npower,--implying a perfectly innocent proposition, it could be easily\r\ntaken by another person as describing the bestowment and acceptance of\r\nunlimited power,--implying a proposition which among us, probably,\r\nwould always be a criminal one.\r\n\r\nWith the help which this discussion may give us, let us now return to\r\nthe General Assembly of Virginia, at Williamsburg, approaching the\r\nclose of its first session, in the latter part of December, 1776. It\r\nwas on the point of adjourning, not to meet again until the latter\r\npart of March, 1777. At that moment, by the arrival of most alarming\r\nnews from the seat of war, it was forced to make special provision for\r\nthe public safety during the interval which must elapse before its\r\nnext session. Its journal indicates that, prior to the 20th of\r\nDecember, it had been proceeding with its business in a quiet way,\r\nunder no apparent consciousness of imminent peril. On that day,\r\nhowever, there are traces of a panic; for, on that day, \"The Virginia\r\nGazette\" announced to them the appalling news of \"the crossing of the\r\nDelaware by the British forces, from twelve to fifteen thousand\r\nstrong; the position of General Washington, at Bristol, on the south\r\nside of the river, with only six thousand men;\" and the virtual flight\r\nof Congress from Philadelphia.[275] At this rate, how long would it be\r\nbefore the Continental army would be dispersed or captured, and the\r\ntroops of the enemy sweeping in vengeance across the borders of\r\nVirginia? Accordingly, the House of Delegates immediately resolved\r\nitself into \"a committee to take into their consideration the state of\r\nAmerica;\" but not being able to reach any decision that day, it voted\r\nto resume the subject on the day following, and for that purpose to\r\nmeet an hour earlier than usual. So, on Saturday, the 21st of\r\nDecember, the House passed a series of resolutions intended to provide\r\nfor the crisis into which the country was plunged, and, among the\r\nother resolutions, this:--\r\n\r\n     \"And whereas the present imminent danger of America, and the\r\n     ruin and misery which threatens the good people of this\r\n     Commonwealth, and their posterity, calls for the utmost\r\n     exertion of our strength, and it is become necessary for the\r\n     preservation of the State that the usual forms of government\r\n     be suspended during a limited time, for the more speedy\r\n     execution of the most vigorous and effectual measures to\r\n     repel the invasion of the enemy;\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved, therefore_, That the governor be, and he is\r\n     hereby fully authorized and empowered, by and with the\r\n     advice and consent of the privy council, from henceforward,\r\n     until ten days next after the first meeting of the General\r\n     Assembly, to carry into execution such requisitions as may\r\n     be made to this Commonwealth by the American Congress for\r\n     the purpose of encountering or repelling the enemy; to order\r\n     the three battalions on the pay of this Commonwealth to\r\n     march, if necessary, to join the Continental army, or to the\r\n     assistance of any of our sister States; to call forth any\r\n     and such greater military force as they shall judge\r\n     requisite, either by embodying and arraying companies or\r\n     regiments of volunteers, or by raising additional\r\n     battalions, appointing and commissioning the proper\r\n     officers, and to direct their operations within this\r\n     Commonwealth, under the command of the Continental generals\r\n     or other officers according to their respective ranks, or\r\n     order them to march to join and act in concert with the\r\n     Continental army, or the troops of any of the American\r\n     States; and to provide for their pay, supply of provisions,\r\n     arms, and other necessaries, at the charge of this\r\n     Commonwealth, by drawing on the treasurer for the money\r\n     which may be necessary from time to time; and the said\r\n     treasurer is authorized to pay such warrants out of any\r\n     public money which may be in his hands, and the General\r\n     Assembly will, at their next session, make ample provision\r\n     for any deficiency which may happen. But that this departure\r\n     from the constitution of government, being in this instance\r\n     founded only on the most evident and urgent necessity, ought\r\n     not hereafter to be drawn into precedent.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions, having been pressed rapidly through the forms of\r\nthe House, were at once carried up to the Senate for its concurrence.\r\nThe answer of the Senate was promptly returned, agreeing to all the\r\nresolutions of the lower House, but proposing an important amendment\r\nin the phraseology of the particular resolution which we have just\r\nquoted. Instead of this clause--\"the usual forms of government should\r\nbe suspended,\" it suggested the far more accurate and far more prudent\r\nexpression which here follows,--\"additional powers be given to the\r\ngovernor and council.\" This amendment was assented to by the House;\r\nand almost immediately thereafter it adjourned until the last Thursday\r\nin March, 1777, \"then to meet in the city of Williamsburg, or at such\r\nother place as the governor and council, for good reasons, may\r\nappoint.\"[276]\r\n\r\nSuch, undoubtedly, was the occasion on which, if at any time during\r\nthat session, the project for a dictatorship in Virginia was under\r\nconsideration by the House of Delegates. The only evidence for the\r\nreality of such a project is derived from the testimony of Jefferson;\r\nand Jefferson, though a member of the House, was not then in\r\nattendance, having procured, on the 29th of the previous month,\r\npermission to be absent during the remainder of the session.[277] Is\r\nit not probable that the whole terrible plot, as it afterward lay in\r\nthe mind of Jefferson, may have originated in reports which reached\r\nhim elsewhere, to the effect that, in the excitement of the House over\r\nthe public danger and over the need of energetic measures against that\r\ndanger, some members had demanded that the governor should be invested\r\nwith what they perhaps called dictatorial power, meaning thereby no\r\nmore than extraordinary power; and that all the criminal accretions to\r\nthat meaning, which Jefferson attributed to the project, were simply\r\nthe work of his own imagination, always sensitive and quick to take\r\nalarm on behalf of human liberty, and, on such a subject as this,\r\neasily set on fire by examples of awful political crime which would\r\noccur to him from Roman history? This suggestion, moreover, is not out\r\nof harmony with one which has been made by a thorough and most candid\r\nstudent of the subject, who says: \"I am very much inclined to think\r\nthat some sneering remark of Colonel Cary, on that occasion, has given\r\nrise to the whole story about a proposed dictator at that time.\"[278]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this must not be forgotten: if the project of a\r\ndictatorship, in the execrable sense affirmed by Jefferson, was,\r\nduring that session, advocated by any man or by any cabal in the\r\nAssembly, history must absolve Patrick Henry of all knowledge of it,\r\nand of all responsibility for it. Not only has no tittle of evidence\r\nbeen produced, involving his connivance at such a scheme, but the\r\nAssembly itself, a few months later, unwittingly furnished to\r\nposterity the most conclusive proof that no man in that body could\r\nhave believed him to be smirched with even the suggestion of so horrid\r\na crime. Had Patrick Henry been suspected, during the autumn and early\r\nwinter of 1776, of any participation in the foul plot to create a\r\ndespotism in Virginia, is it to be conceived that, at its very next\r\nsession, in the spring of 1777, that Assembly, composed of nearly the\r\nsame members as before, would have reëlected to the governorship so\r\nprofligate and dangerous a man, and that too without any visible\r\nopposition in either House? Yet that is precisely what the Virginia\r\nAssembly did in May, 1777. Moreover, one year later, this same\r\nAssembly reëlected this same profligate and dangerous politician for\r\nhis third and last permissible year in the governorship, and it did so\r\nwith the same unbroken unanimity. Moreover, during all that time,\r\nThomas Jefferson was a member, and a most conspicuous and influential\r\nmember, of the Virginia Assembly. If, indeed, he then believed that\r\nhis old friend, Patrick Henry, had stood ready in 1776, to commit\r\n\"treason against the people\" of America, and \"treason against mankind\r\nin general,\" why did he permit the traitor to be twice reëlected to\r\nthe chief magistracy, without the record of even one brave effort\r\nagainst him on either occasion?\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, 1776, in accordance with the special\r\nauthority thus conferred upon him by the General Assembly, Governor\r\nHenry issued a vigorous proclamation, declaring that the \"critical\r\nsituation of American affairs\" called for \"the utmost exertion of\r\nevery sister State to put a speedy end to the cruel ravages of a\r\nhaughty and inveterate enemy, and secure our invaluable rights,\" and\r\n\"earnestly exhorting and requiring\" all the good people of Virginia to\r\nassist in the formation of volunteer companies for such service as\r\nmight be required.[279] The date of that proclamation was also the\r\ndate of Washington's famous matutinal surprise of the Hessians at\r\nTrenton,--a bit of much-needed good luck, which was followed by his\r\nfortunate engagement with the enemy near Princeton, on the 3d of\r\nJanuary, 1777. On these and a very few other extremely small crumbs of\r\ncomfort, the struggling revolutionists had to nourish their burdened\r\nhearts for many a month thereafter; Washington himself, during all\r\nthat time, with his little army of tattered and barefoot warriors,\r\nmajestically predominating over the scene from the heights of\r\nMorristown; while the good-humored British commander, Sir William\r\nHowe, considerately abstained from any serious military disturbance\r\nuntil the middle of the following summer. Thus the chief duty of the\r\ngovernor of Virginia, during the winter and spring of 1777, as it had\r\nbeen in the previous autumn, was that of trying to keep in the field\r\nVirginia's quota of troops, and of trying to furnish Virginia's share\r\nof military supplies,--no easy task, it should seem, in those times of\r\npoverty, confusion, and patriotic languor. The official correspondence\r\nof the governor indicates the unslumbering anxiety, the energy, the\r\nfertility of device with which, in spite of defective health, he\r\ndevoted himself to these hard tasks.[280]\r\n\r\nIn his great desire for exact information as to the real situation at\r\nheadquarters, Governor Henry had sent to Washington a secret messenger\r\nby the name of Walker, who was to make his observations at Morristown\r\nand to report the results to himself. Washington at once perceived the\r\nembarrassments to which such a plan might lead; and accordingly, on\r\nthe 24th of February, 1777, he wrote to the governor, gently\r\nexplaining why he could not receive Mr. Walker as a mere visiting\r\nobserver:--\r\n\r\n     \"To avoid the precedent, therefore, and from your character\r\n     of Mr. Walker, and the high opinion I myself entertain of\r\n     his abilities, honor, and prudence, I have taken him into my\r\n     family as an extra aide-de-camp, and shall be happy if, in\r\n     this character, he can answer your expectations. I sincerely\r\n     thank you, sir, for your kind congratulations on the late\r\n     success of the Continental arms (would to God it may\r\n     continue), and for your polite mention of me. Let me\r\n     earnestly entreat that the troops raised in Virginia for\r\n     this army be forwarded on by companies, or otherwise,\r\n     without delay, and as well equipped as possible for the\r\n     field, or we shall be in no condition to open the\r\n     campaign.\"[281]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of the following month, the governor wrote to Washington\r\nof the overwhelming difficulty attending all his efforts to comply\r\nwith the request mentioned in the letter just cited:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am very sorry to inform you that the recruiting business\r\n     of late goes on so badly, that there remains but little\r\n     prospect of filling the six new battalions from this State,\r\n     voted by the Assembly. The Board of Council see this with\r\n     great concern, and, after much reflection on the subject,\r\n     are of opinion that the deficiency in our regulars can no\r\n     way be supplied so properly as by enlisting volunteers.\r\n     There is reason to believe a considerable number of these\r\n     may be got to serve six or eight months.... I believe you\r\n     can receive no assistance by drafts from the militia. From\r\n     the battalions of the Commonwealth none can be drawn as yet,\r\n     because they are not half full.... Virginia will find some\r\n     apology with you for this deficiency in her quota of\r\n     regulars, when the difficulties lately thrown in our way are\r\n     considered. The Georgians and Carolinians have enlisted [in\r\n     Virginia] probably two battalions at least. A regiment of\r\n     artillery is in great forwardness. Besides these, Colonels\r\n     Baylor and Grayson are collecting regiments; and three\r\n     others are forming for this State. Add to all this our\r\n     Indian wars and marine service, almost total want of\r\n     necessaries, the false accounts of deserters,--many of whom\r\n     lurk here,--the terrors of the smallpox and the many deaths\r\n     occasioned by it, and the deficient enlistments are\r\n     accounted for in the best manner I can. As no time can be\r\n     spared, I wish to be honored with your answer as soon as\r\n     possible, in order to promote the volunteer scheme, if it\r\n     meets your approbation. I should be glad of any improvements\r\n     on it that may occur to you. I believe about four of the six\r\n     battalions may be enlisted, but have seen no regular\r\n     [return] of their state. Their scattered situation, and\r\n     being many of them in broken quotas, is a reason for their\r\n     slow movement. I have issued repeated orders for their march\r\n     long since.\"[282]\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Virginia, at its session in the spring of\r\n1777, was required to elect a governor, to serve for one year from the\r\nday on which that session should end. As no candidate was named in\r\nopposition to Patrick Henry, the Senate proposed to the House of\r\nDelegates that he should be reappointed without ballot. This,\r\naccordingly, was done, by resolution of the latter body on the 29th of\r\nMay, and by that of the Senate on the 1st of June. On the 5th of June,\r\nthe committee appointed to inform the governor of this action laid\r\nbefore the House his answer:--\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--The signal honor conferred on me by the General\r\n     Assembly, in their choice of me to be governor of this\r\n     Commonwealth, demands my best acknowledgments, which I beg\r\n     the favor of you to convey to them in the most acceptable\r\n     manner.\r\n\r\n     I shall execute the duties of that high station to which I\r\n     am again called by the favor of my fellow-citizens,\r\n     according to the best of my abilities, and I shall rely upon\r\n     the candor and wisdom of the Assembly to excuse and supply\r\n     my defects. The good of the Commonwealth shall be the only\r\n     object of my pursuit, and I shall measure my happiness\r\n     according to the success which shall attend my endeavors to\r\n     establish the public liberty. I beg to be presented to the\r\n     Assembly, and that they and you will be assured that I am,\r\n     with every sentiment of the highest regard, their and your\r\n     most obedient and very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                P. HENRY.[283]\r\n\r\nAfter a perusal of this nobly written letter, the gentle reader will\r\nhave no difficulty in concluding that, if indeed the author of it was\r\nthen lying in wait for an opportunity to set up a despotism in\r\nVirginia, he had already become an adept in the hypocrisy which\r\nenabled him, not only to conceal the fact, but to convey an impression\r\nquite the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[255] Burk, _Hist.

The General Assembly was in session\r\nfrom the 20th of October, 1777, until the 24th of January, 1778, and\r\nfrom the 4th of May to the 1st of June, 1778,--involving, of course, a\r\nlong strain of attention by the governor to the work of the two\r\nhouses. Moreover, the prominence of Virginia among the States, and, at\r\nthe same time, her exemption from the most formidable assaults of the\r\nenemy, led to great demands being made upon her both for men and for\r\nsupplies. To meet these demands, either by satisfying them or by\r\nexplaining his failure to do so, involved a copious and laborious\r\ncorrespondence on the part of Governor Henry, not only with his own\r\nofficial subordinates in the State, but with the president of\r\nCongress, with the board of war, and with the general of the army.\r\nThe official letters which he thus wrote are a monument of his ardor\r\nand energy as a war governor, his attention to details, his broad\r\npractical sense, his hopefulness and patience under galling\r\ndisappointments and defeats.[284]\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing in the life of Governor Henry during his second term\r\nof office has so touching an interest for us now, as has the course\r\nwhich he took respecting the famous intrigue, which was developed into\r\nalarming proportions during the winter of 1777 and 1778, for the\r\ndisplacement of Washington, and for the elevation of the shallow and\r\nill-balanced Gates to the supreme command of the armies. It is\r\nprobable that several men of prominence in the army, in Congress, and\r\nin the several state governments, were drawn into this cabal, although\r\nmost of them had too much caution to commit themselves to it by any\r\ndocumentary evidence which could rise up and destroy them in case of\r\nits failure. The leaders in the plot very naturally felt the great\r\nimportance of securing the secret support of men of high influence in\r\nWashington's own State; and by many it was then believed that they\r\nhad actually won over no less a man than Richard Henry Lee. Of course,\r\nif also the sanction of Governor Patrick Henry could be secured, a\r\nprodigious advantage would be gained. Accordingly, from the town of\r\nYork, in Pennsylvania, whither Congress had fled on the advance of the\r\nenemy towards Philadelphia, the following letter was sent to him,--a\r\nletter written in a disguised hand, without signature, but evidently\r\nby a personal friend, a man of position, and a master of the art of\r\nplausible statement:--\r\n\r\n                                      YORKTOWN, 12 January, 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--The common danger of our country first brought\r\n     you and me together. I recollect with pleasure the influence\r\n     of your conversation and eloquence upon the opinions of this\r\n     country in the beginning of the present controversy. You\r\n     first taught us to shake off our idolatrous attachment to\r\n     royalty, and to oppose its encroachments upon our liberties\r\n     with our very lives. By these means you saved us from ruin.\r\n     The independence of America is the offspring of that liberal\r\n     spirit of thinking and acting, which followed the\r\n     destruction of the sceptres of kings, and the mighty power\r\n     of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     But, Sir, we have only passed the Red Sea. A dreary\r\n     wilderness is still before us; and unless a Moses or a\r\n     Joshua are raised up in our behalf, we must perish before we\r\n     reach the promised land. We have nothing to fear from our\r\n     enemies on the way. General Howe, it is true, has taken\r\n     Philadelphia, but he has only changed his prison. His\r\n     dominions are bounded on all sides by his out-sentries.\r\n     America can only be undone by herself. She looks up to her\r\n     councils and arms for protection; but, alas! what are they?\r\n     Her representation in Congress dwindled to only twenty-one\r\n     members; her Adams, her Wilson, her Henry are no more among\r\n     them. Her councils weak, and partial remedies applied\r\n     constantly for universal diseases. Her army, what is it? A\r\n     major-general belonging to it called it a few days ago, in\r\n     my hearing, a mob. Discipline unknown or wholly neglected.\r\n     The quartermaster's and commissary's departments filled with\r\n     idleness, ignorance, and peculation; our hospitals crowded\r\n     with six thousand sick, but half provided with necessaries\r\n     or accommodations, and more dying in them in one month than\r\n     perished in the field during the whole of the last campaign.\r\n     The money depreciating, without any effectual measures being\r\n     taken to raise it; the country distracted with the Don\r\n     Quixote attempts to regulate the price of provisions; an\r\n     artificial famine created by it, and a real one dreaded from\r\n     it; the spirit of the people failing through a more intimate\r\n     acquaintance with the causes of our misfortunes; many\r\n     submitting daily to General Howe; and more wishing to do it,\r\n     only to avoid the calamities which threaten our country. But\r\n     is our case desperate? By no means. We have wisdom, virtue\r\n     and strength enough to save us, if they could be called into\r\n     action. The northern army has shown us what Americans are\r\n     capable of doing with a General at their head. The spirit of\r\n     the southern army is no way inferior to the spirit of the\r\n     northern. A Gates, a Lee, or a Conway, would in a few weeks\r\n     render them an irresistible body of men. The last of the\r\n     above officers has accepted of the new office of\r\n     inspector-general of our army, in order to reform abuses;\r\n     but the remedy is only a palliative one. In one of his\r\n     letters to a friend he says, 'A great and good God hath\r\n     decreed America to be free, or the [General] and weak\r\n     counsellors would have ruined her long ago.' You may rest\r\n     assured of each of the facts related in this letter. The\r\n     author of it is one of your Philadelphia friends. A hint of\r\n     his name, if found out by the handwriting, must not be\r\n     mentioned to your most intimate friend. Even the letter must\r\n     be thrown into the fire. But some of its contents ought to\r\n     be made public, in order to awaken, enlighten, and alarm our\r\n     country. I rely upon your prudence, and am, dear Sir, with\r\n     my usual attachment to you, and to our beloved independence,\r\n\r\n                                                 Yours sincerely.\r\n\r\nHow was Patrick Henry to deal with such a letter as this? Even though\r\nhe should reject its reasoning, and spurn the temptation with which it\r\nassailed him, should he merely burn it, and be silent? The incident\r\nfurnished a fair test of his loyalty in friendship, his faith in\r\nprinciple, his soundness of judgment, his clear and cool grasp of the\r\npublic situation,--in a word, of his manliness and his statesmanship.\r\nThis is the way in which he stood the test:--\r\n\r\n     PATRICK HENRY TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                 WILLIAMSBURG, 20 February, 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--You will, no doubt, be surprised at seeing the\r\n     enclosed letter, in which the encomiums bestowed on me are\r\n     as undeserved, as the censures aimed at you are unjust. I am\r\n     sorry there should be one man who counts himself my friend,\r\n     who is not yours.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps I give you needless trouble in handing you this\r\n     paper. The writer of it may be too insignificant to deserve\r\n     any notice. If I knew this to be the case, I should not have\r\n     intruded on your time, which is so precious. But there may\r\n     possibly be some scheme or party forming to your prejudice.\r\n     The enclosed leads to such a suspicion. Believe, me, Sir, I\r\n     have too high a sense of the obligations America has to you,\r\n     to abet or countenance so unworthy a proceeding. The most\r\n     exalted merit has ever been found to attract envy. But I\r\n     please myself with the hope that the same fortitude and\r\n     greatness of mind, which have hitherto braved all the\r\n     difficulties and dangers inseparable from your station, will\r\n     rise superior to every attempt of the envious partisan. I\r\n     really cannot tell who is the writer of this letter, which\r\n     not a little perplexes me. The handwriting is altogether\r\n     strange to me.\r\n\r\n     To give you the trouble of this gives me pain. It would suit\r\n     my inclination better to give you some assistance in the\r\n     great business of the war. But I will not conceal anything\r\n     from you, by which you may be affected; for I really think\r\n     your personal welfare and the happiness of America are\r\n     intimately connected. I beg you will be assured of that high\r\n     regard and esteem with which I ever am, dear sir, your\r\n     affectionate friend and very humble servant.\r\n\r\nFifteen days passed after the dispatch of that letter, when, having as\r\nyet no answer, but with a heart still full of anxiety respecting this\r\nmysterious and ill-boding cabal against his old friend, Governor\r\nHenry wrote again:--\r\n\r\n     PATRICK HENRY TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                     WILLIAMSBURG, 5 March, 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--By an express, which Colonel Finnie sent to camp,\r\n     I enclosed to you an anonymous letter which I hope got safe\r\n     to hand. I am anxious to hear something that will serve to\r\n     explain the strange affair, which I am now informed is taken\r\n     up respecting you. Mr. Custis has just paid us a visit, and\r\n     by him I learn sundry particulars concerning General\r\n     Mifflin, that much surprised me. It is very hard to trace\r\n     the schemes and windings of the enemies to America. I really\r\n     thought that man its friend; however, I am too far from him\r\n     to judge of his present temper.\r\n\r\n     While you face the armed enemies of our liberty in the\r\n     field, and by the favor of God have been kept unhurt, I\r\n     trust your country will never harbor in her bosom the\r\n     miscreant, who would ruin her best supporter. I wish not to\r\n     flatter; but when arts, unworthy honest men, are used to\r\n     defame and traduce you, I think it not amiss, but a duty, to\r\n     assure you of that estimation in which the public hold you.\r\n     Not that I think any testimony I can bear is necessary for\r\n     your support, or private satisfaction; for a bare\r\n     recollection of what is past must give you sufficient\r\n     pleasure in every circumstance of life. But I cannot help\r\n     assuring you, on this occasion, of the high sense of\r\n     gratitude which all ranks of men in this our native country\r\n     bear to you. It will give me sincere pleasure to manifest my\r\n     regards, and render my best services to you or yours. I do\r\n     not like to make a parade of these things, and I know you\r\n     are not fond of it; however, I hope the occasion will plead\r\n     my excuse. Wishing you all possible felicity, I am, my dear\r\n     Sir, your ever affectionate friend and very humble servant.\r\n\r\nBefore Washington received this second letter, he had already begun to\r\nwrite the following reply to the first:--\r\n\r\n     GEORGE WASHINGTON TO PATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\n                                   VALLEY FORGE, 27 March, 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--About eight days ago I was honored with your\r\n     favor of the 20th ultimo. Your friendship, sir, in\r\n     transmitting to me the anonymous letter you had received,\r\n     lays me under the most grateful obligations, and if my\r\n     acknowledgments can be due for anything more, it is for the\r\n     polite and delicate terms in which you have been pleased to\r\n     communicate the matter.\r\n\r\n     I have ever been happy in supposing that I had a place in\r\n     your esteem, and the proof you have afforded on this\r\n     occasion makes me peculiarly so. The favorable light in\r\n     which you hold me is truly flattering; but I should feel\r\n     much regret, if I thought the happiness of America so\r\n     intimately connected with my personal welfare, as you so\r\n     obligingly seem to consider it. All I can say is, that she\r\n     has ever had, and I trust she ever will have, my honest\r\n     exertions to promote her interest. I cannot hope that my\r\n     services have been the best; but my heart tells me they have\r\n     been the best that I could render.\r\n\r\n     That I may have erred in using the means in my power for\r\n     accomplishing the objects of the arduous, exalted station\r\n     with which I am honored, I cannot doubt; nor do I wish my\r\n     conduct to be exempted from reprehension farther than it may\r\n     deserve. Error is the portion of humanity, and to censure\r\n     it, whether committed by this or that public character, is\r\n     the prerogative of freemen. However, being intimately\r\n     acquainted with the man I conceive to be the author of the\r\n     letter transmitted, and having always received from him the\r\n     strongest professions of attachment and regard, I am\r\n     constrained to consider him as not possessing, at least, a\r\n     great degree of candor and sincerity, though his views in\r\n     addressing you should have been the result of conviction,\r\n     and founded in motives of public good. This is not the only\r\n     secret, insidious attempt that has been made to wound my\r\n     reputation. There have been others equally base, cruel, and\r\n     ungenerous, because conducted with as little frankness, and\r\n     proceeding from views, perhaps, as personally interested. I\r\n     am, dear sir, with great esteem and regard, your much\r\n     obliged friend, etc.\r\n\r\nThe writing of the foregoing letter was not finished, when Governor\r\nHenry's second letter reached him; and this additional proof of\r\nfriendship so touched the heart of Washington that, on the next day,\r\nhe wrote again, this time with far less self-restraint than before:--\r\n\r\n     GEORGE WASHINGTON TO PATRICK HENRY\r\n\r\n                                           CAMP, 28 March, 1778.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--Just as I was about to close my letter of\r\n     yesterday, your favor of the 5th instant came to hand. I can\r\n     only thank you again, in the language of the most\r\n     undissembled gratitude, for your friendship; and assure you,\r\n     that the indulgent disposition, which Virginia in\r\n     particular, and the States in general, entertain towards me,\r\n     gives me the most sensible pleasure. The approbation of my\r\n     country is what I wish; and as far as my abilities and\r\n     opportunities will permit, I hope I shall endeavor to\r\n     deserve it. It is the highest reward to a feeling mind; and\r\n     happy are they, who so conduct themselves as to merit it.\r\n\r\n     The anonymous letter with which you were pleased to favor\r\n     me, was written by Dr. Rush, so far as I can judge from a\r\n     similitude of hands. This man has been elaborate and studied\r\n     in his professions of regard for me; and long since the\r\n     letter to you. My caution to avoid anything which could\r\n     injure the service, prevented me from communicating, but to\r\n     a very few of my friends, the intrigues of a faction which I\r\n     know was formed against me, since it might serve to publish\r\n     our internal dissensions; but their own restless zeal to\r\n     advance their views has too clearly betrayed them, and made\r\n     concealment on my part fruitless. I cannot precisely mark\r\n     the extent of their views, but it appeared, in general, that\r\n     General Gates was to be exalted on the ruin of my reputation\r\n     and influence. This I am authorized to say, from undeniable\r\n     facts in my own possession, from publications, the evident\r\n     scope of which could not be mistaken, and from private\r\n     detractions industriously circulated. General Mifflin, it is\r\n     commonly supposed, bore the second part in the cabal; and\r\n     General Conway, I know, was a very active and malignant\r\n     partisan; but I have good reason to believe that their\r\n     machinations have recoiled most sensibly upon themselves.\r\n     With sentiments of great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir,\r\n     your affectionate humble servant.[285]\r\n\r\nThis incident in the lives of Washington and Patrick Henry is to be\r\nnoted by us, not only for its own exquisite delicacy and nobility, but\r\nlikewise as the culminating fact in the growth of a very deep and true\r\nfriendship between the two men,--a friendship which seems to have\r\nbegun many years before, probably in the House of Burgesses, and which\r\nlasted with increasing strength and tenderness, and with but a single\r\nepisode of estrangement, during the rest of their lives. Moreover, he\r\nwho tries to interpret the later career of Patrick Henry, especially\r\nafter the establishment of the government under the Constitution, and\r\nwho leaves out of the account Henry's profound friendship for\r\nWashington, and the basis of moral and intellectual congeniality on\r\nwhich that friendship rested, will lose an important clew to the\r\nperfect naturalness and consistency of Henry's political course during\r\nhis last years. A fierce partisan outcry was then raised against him\r\nin Virginia, and he was bitterly denounced as a political apostate,\r\nsimply because, in the parting of the ways of Washington and of\r\nJefferson, Patrick Henry no longer walked with Jefferson. In truth,\r\nPatrick Henry was never Washington's follower nor Jefferson's: he was\r\nno man's follower. From the beginning, he had always done for himself\r\nhis own thinking, whether right or wrong. At the same time, a careful\r\nstudent of the three men may see that, in his thinking, Patrick Henry\r\nhad a closer and a truer moral kinship with Washington than with\r\nJefferson. At present, however, we pause before the touching incident\r\nthat has just been narrated in the relations between Washington and\r\nHenry, in order to mark its bearing on their subsequent intercourse.\r\nWashington, in whose nature confidence was a plant of slow growth, and\r\nwho was quick neither to love nor to cease from loving, never forgot\r\nthat proof of his friend's friendship. Thenceforward, until that one\r\nyear in which they both died, the letters which passed between them,\r\nwhile never effusive, were evidently the letters of two strong men who\r\nloved and trusted each other without reserve.\r\n\r\nNot long before the close of the governor's second term in office, he\r\nhad occasion to write to Richard Henry Lee two letters, which are of\r\nconsiderable interest, not only as indicating the cordial intimacy\r\nbetween these two great rivals in oratory, but also for the light they\r\nthrow both on the under-currents of bitterness then ruffling the\r\npolitics of Virginia, and on Patrick Henry's attitude towards the one\r\ngreat question at that time uppermost in the politics of the nation.\r\nDuring the previous autumn, it seems, also, Lee had fallen into great\r\ndisfavor in Virginia, from which he had so far emerged by the 23d of\r\nJanuary, 1778, as to be then reëlected to Congress, to fill out an\r\nunexpired term.[286] Shortly afterward, however, harsh speech against\r\nhim was to be heard in Virginia once more, of which his friend, the\r\ngovernor, thus informed him, in a letter dated April 4, 1778:--\r\n\r\n     \"You are again traduced by a certain set who have drawn in\r\n     others, who say that you are engaged in a scheme to discard\r\n     General Washington. I know you too well to suppose that you\r\n     would engage in anything not evidently calculated to serve\r\n     the cause of whiggism.... But it is your fate to suffer the\r\n     constant attacks of disguised Tories who take this measure\r\n     to lessen you. Farewell, my dear friend. In praying for your\r\n     welfare, I pray for that of my country, to which your life\r\n     and service are of the last moment.\"[287]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on the 30th of May, the General Assembly made choice of\r\ntheir delegates in Congress for the following year. Lee was again\r\nelected, but by so small a vote that his name stood next to the lowest\r\non the list.[288] Concerning this stinging slight, he appears to have\r\nspoken in his next letters to the governor; for, on the 18th of June,\r\nthe latter addressed to him, from Williamsburg, this reply:--\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,--Both your last letters came to hand to-day. I\r\n     felt for you, on seeing the order in which the balloting\r\n     placed the delegates in Congress. It is an effect of that\r\n     rancorous malice that has so long followed you, through that\r\n     arduous path of duty which you have invariably travelled,\r\n     since America resolved to resist her oppressors.\r\n\r\n     Is it any pleasure to you to remark, that at the same era in\r\n     which these men figure against you, public spirit seems to\r\n     have taken its flight from Virginia? It is too much the\r\n     case; for the quota of our troops is not half made up, and\r\n     no chance seems to remain for completing it. The Assembly\r\n     voted three hundred and fifty horse, and two thousand men,\r\n     to be forthwith raised, and to join the grand army. Great\r\n     bounties are offered; but, I fear, the only effect will be\r\n     to expose our state to contempt,--for I believe no soldiers\r\n     will enlist, especially in the infantry.\r\n\r\n     Can you credit it?--no effort was made for supporting or\r\n     restoring public credit. I pressed it warmly on some, but in\r\n     vain. This is the reason we get no soldiers.\r\n\r\n     We shall issue fifty or sixty thousand dollars in cash to\r\n     equip the cavalry, and their time is to expire at Christmas.\r\n     I believe they will not be in the field before that time.\r\n\r\n     Let not Congress rely on Virginia for soldiers. I tell you\r\n     my opinion: they will not be got here, until a different\r\n     spirit prevails.\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph of his letter, the governor passes from these\r\nlocal matters to what was then the one commanding topic in national\r\naffairs. Lord North's peace commissioners had already arrived, and\r\nwere seeking to win back the Americans into free colonial relations\r\nwith the mother country, and away from their new-formed friendship\r\nwith perfidious France. With what energy Patrick Henry was prepared to\r\nreject all these British blandishments, may be read in the passionate\r\nsentences which conclude his letter:--\r\n\r\n     I look at the past condition of America, as at a dreadful\r\n     precipice, from which we have escaped by means of the\r\n     generous French, to whom I will be ever-lastingly bound by\r\n     the most heartfelt gratitude. But I must mistake matters, if\r\n     some of those men who traduce you, do not prefer the offers\r\n     of Britain. You will have a different game to play now with\r\n     the commissioners. How comes Governor Johnstone there? I do\r\n     not see how it comports with his past life.\r\n\r\n     Surely Congress will never recede from our French friends.\r\n     Salvation to America depends upon our holding fast our\r\n     attachment to them. I shall date our ruin from the moment\r\n     that it is exchanged for anything Great Britain can say, or\r\n     do. She can never be cordial with us. Baffled, defeated,\r\n     disgraced by her colonies, she will ever meditate revenge.\r\n     We can find no safety but in her ruin, or, at least, in her\r\n     extreme humiliation; which has not happened, and cannot\r\n     happen, until she is deluged with blood, or thoroughly\r\n     purged by a revolution, which shall wipe from existence the\r\n     present king with his connections, and the present system\r\n     with those who aid and abet it.\r\n\r\n     For God's sake, my dear sir, quit not the councils of your\r\n     country, until you see us forever disjoined from Great\r\n     Britain. The old leaven still works. The fleshpots of Egypt\r\n     are still savory to degenerate palates. Again we are undone,\r\n     if the French alliance is not religiously observed. Excuse\r\n     my freedom. I know your love to our country,--and this is my\r\n     motive. May Heaven give you health and prosperity.\r\n\r\n                                     I am yours affectionately,\r\n                                               PATRICK HENRY.[289]\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the end of our story of Governor Henry's second\r\nterm, it should be mentioned that twice during this period did the\r\nGeneral Assembly confide to him those extraordinary powers which by\r\nmany were spoken of as dictatorial; first, on the 22d of January,\r\n1778,[290] and again, on the 28th of May, of the same year.[291]\r\nFinally, so safe had been this great trust in his hands, and so\r\nefficiently had he borne himself, in all the labors and\r\nresponsibilities of his high office, that, on the 29th of May, the\r\nHouse of Delegates, by resolution, unanimously elected him as governor\r\nfor a third term,--an act in which, on the same day, the Senate voted\r\nits concurrence. On the 30th of May, Thomas Jefferson, from the\r\ncommittee appointed to notify the governor of his reëlection, reported\r\nto the House the following answer:--\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--The General Assembly, in again electing me\r\n     governor of this commonwealth, have done me very signal\r\n     honor. I trust that their confidence, thus continued in me,\r\n     will not be misplaced. I beg you will be pleased, gentlemen,\r\n     to present me to the General Assembly in terms of grateful\r\n     acknowledgment for this fresh instance of their favor\r\n     towards me; and to assure them, that my best endeavors shall\r\n     be used to promote the public good, in that station to which\r\n     they have once more been pleased to call me.[292]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[284] Of the official letters of Governor Henry, doubtless many have\r\nperished; a few have been printed in Sparks, Force, Wirt, and\r\nelsewhere; a considerable number, also, are preserved in manuscript in\r\nthe archives of the Department of State at Washington. Copies of the\r\nlatter are before me as I write. As justifying the statement made in\r\nthe text, I would refer to his letters of August 30, 1777; of October\r\n29, 1777; of October 30, 1777; of December 6, 1777; of December 9,\r\n1777; of January 20, 1778; of January 28, 1778; and of June 18, 1778.\r\n\r\n[285] _Writings of Washington_, v. 495-497; 512-515.\r\n\r\n[286] _Jour.

In the month just\r\nmentioned, likewise, the enemy, under command of General Matthews and\r\nof Sir George Collier, suddenly swooped down on Virginia, first\r\nseizing Portsmouth and Norfolk, and then, after a glorious military\r\ndebauch of robbery, ruin, rape, and murder, and after spreading terror\r\nand anguish among the undefended populations of Suffolk, Kemp's\r\nLanding, Tanner's Creek, and Gosport, as suddenly gathered up their\r\nbooty, and went back in great glee to New York.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1778, the governor had the happiness to hear of the\r\nreally brilliant success of the expedition which, with statesmanlike\r\nsagacity, he had sent out under George Rogers Clark, into the Illinois\r\ncountry, in the early part of the year.[293] Some of the more\r\nimportant facts connected with this expedition, he thus announced to\r\nthe Virginia delegates in Congress:--\r\n\r\n                              WILLIAMSBURG, November 14, 1778.\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--The executive power of this State having been\r\n     impressed with a strong apprehension of incursions on the\r\n     frontier settlements from the savages situated about the\r\n     Illinois, and supposing the danger would be greatly obviated\r\n     by an enterprise against the English forts and possessions\r\n     in that country, which were well known to inspire the\r\n     savages with their bloody purposes against us, sent a\r\n     detachment of militia, consisting of one hundred and seventy\r\n     or eighty men commanded by Colonel George Rogers Clark, on\r\n     that service some time last spring. By despatches which I\r\n     have just received from Colonel Clark, it appears that his\r\n     success has equalled the most sanguine expectations. He has\r\n     not only reduced Fort Chartres and its dependencies, but has\r\n     struck such a terror into the Indian tribes between that\r\n     settlement and the lakes that no less than five of them,\r\n     viz., the Puans, Sacks, Renards, Powtowantanies, and Miamis,\r\n     who had received the hatchet from the English emissaries,\r\n     have submitted to our arms all their English presents, and\r\n     bound themselves by treaties and promises to be peaceful in\r\n     the future.\r\n\r\n     The great Blackbird, the Chappowow chief, has also sent a\r\n     belt of peace to Colonel Clark, influenced, he supposes, by\r\n     the dread of Detroit's being reduced by American arms. This\r\n     latter place, according to Colonel Clark's representation,\r\n     is at present defended by so inconsiderable a garrison and\r\n     so scantily furnished with provisions, for which they must\r\n     be still more distressed by the loss of supplies from the\r\n     Illinois, that it might be reduced by any number of men\r\n     above five hundred. The governor of that place, Mr.\r\n     Hamilton, was exerting himself to engage the savages to\r\n     assist him in retaking the places that had fallen into our\r\n     hands; but the favorable impression made on the Indians in\r\n     general in that quarter, the influence of the French on\r\n     them, and the reënforcement of their militia Colonel Clark\r\n     expected, flattered him that there was little danger to be\r\n     apprehended.... If the party under Colonel Clark can\r\n     coöperate in any respect with the measures Congress are\r\n     pursuing or have in view, I shall with pleasure give him the\r\n     necessary orders. In order to improve and secure the\r\n     advantages gained by Colonel Clark, I propose to support him\r\n     with a reënforcement of militia. But this will depend on the\r\n     pleasure of the Assembly, to whose consideration the measure\r\n     is submitted.\r\n\r\n     The French inhabitants have manifested great zeal and\r\n     attachment to our cause, and insist on garrisons remaining\r\n     with them under Colonel Clark. This I am induced to agree\r\n     to, because the safety of our own frontiers as well as that\r\n     of these people demands a compliance with this request. Were\r\n     it possible to secure the St. Lawrence and prevent the\r\n     English attempts up that river by seizing some post on it,\r\n     peace with the Indians would seem to me to be secured.\r\n\r\n                With great regard I have the honor to be, Gentn,\r\n                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                                    P. HENRY.[294]\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn session of the General Assembly, that body showed\r\nits continued confidence in the governor by passing several acts\r\nconferring on him extraordinary powers, in addition to those already\r\nbestowed.[295]\r\n\r\nA letter which the governor wrote at this period to the president of\r\nCongress, respecting military aid from Virginia to States further\r\nsouth, may give us some idea, not only of his own practical\r\ndiscernment in the matters involved, but of the confusion which, in\r\nthose days, often attended military plans issuing from a many-headed\r\nexecutive:--\r\n\r\n                                 WILLIAMSBURG, November 28, 1778.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--Your favor of the 16th instant is come to hand,\r\n     together with the acts of Congress of the 26th of August for\r\n     establishing provision for soldiers and sailors maimed or\r\n     disabled in the public service,--of the 26th of September\r\n     for organizing the treasury, a proclamation for a general\r\n     thanksgiving, and three copies of the alliance between his\r\n     most Christian Majesty and these United States.\r\n\r\n     I lost no time in laying your letter before the privy\r\n     council, and in deliberating with them on the subject of\r\n     sending 1000 militia to Charlestown, South Carolina. I beg\r\n     to assure Congress of the great zeal of every member of the\r\n     executive here to give full efficacy to their designs on\r\n     every occasion. But on the present, I am very sorry to\r\n     observe, that obstacles great and I fear unsurmountable are\r\n     opposed to the immediate march of the men. Upon requisition\r\n     to the deputy quartermaster-general in this department for\r\n     tents, kettles, blankets, and wagons, he informs they cannot\r\n     be had. The season when the march must begin will be severe\r\n     and inclement, and, without the forementioned necessaries,\r\n     impracticable to men indifferently clad and equipped as they\r\n     are in the present general scarcity of clothes.\r\n\r\n     The council, as well as myself, are not a little perplexed\r\n     on comparing this requisition to defend South Carolina and\r\n     Georgia from the assaults of the enemy, with that made a few\r\n     days past for galleys to conquer East Florida. The galleys\r\n     have orders to rendezvous at Charlestown, which I was taught\r\n     to consider as a place of acknowledged safety; and I beg\r\n     leave to observe, that there seems some degree of\r\n     inconsistency in marching militia such a distance in the\r\n     depth of winter, under the want of necessaries, to defend a\r\n     place which the former measures seemed to declare safe.\r\n\r\n     The act of Assembly whereby it is made lawful to order their\r\n     march, confines the operations to measures merely defensive\r\n     to a sister State, and of whose danger there is certain\r\n     information received.\r\n\r\n     However, as Congress have not been pleased to explain the\r\n     matters herein alluded to, and altho' a good deal of\r\n     perplexity remains with me on the subject, I have by advice\r\n     of the privy council given orders for 1000 men to be\r\n     instantly got into readiness to march to Charlestown, and\r\n     they will march as soon as they are furnished with tents,\r\n     kettles, and wagons. In the mean time, if intelligence is\r\n     received that their march is essential to the preservation\r\n     of either of the States of South Carolina or Georgia the men\r\n     will encounter every difficulty, and have orders to proceed\r\n     in the best way they can without waiting to be supplied with\r\n     those necessaries commonly afforded to troops even on a\r\n     summer's march.\r\n\r\n     I have to beg that Congress will please to remember the\r\n     state of embarrassment in which I must necessarily remain\r\n     with respect to the ordering galleys to Charlestown, in\r\n     their way to invade Florida, while the militia are getting\r\n     ready to defend the States bordering on it, and that they\r\n     will please to favor me with the earliest intelligence of\r\n     every circumstance that is to influence the measures either\r\n     offensive or defensive.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and very\r\n     humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                  P. HENRY.[296]\r\n\r\nBy the early spring of 1779, it became still more apparent that the\r\npurpose of the enemy was to shift the scene of their activity from the\r\nmiddle States to the South, and that Virginia, whose soil had never\r\nthus far been bruised by the tread of a hostile army, must soon\r\nexperience that dire calamity. Perhaps no one saw this more clearly\r\nthan did Governor Henry. At the same time, he also saw that Virginia\r\nmust in part defend herself by helping to defend her sister States at\r\nthe South, across whose territories the advance of the enemy into\r\nVirginia was likely to be attempted. His clear grasp of the military\r\nsituation, in all the broad relations of his own State to it, is thus\r\nrevealed in a letter to Washington, dated at Williamsburg, 13th of\r\nMarch, 1779:--\r\n\r\n     \"My last accounts from the South are unfavorable. Georgia is\r\n     said to be in full possession of the enemy, and South\r\n     Carolina in great danger. The number of disaffected there is\r\n     said to be formidable, and the Creek Indians inclining\r\n     against us. One thousand militia are ordered thither from\r\n     our southern counties; but a doubt is started whether they\r\n     are by law obliged to march. I have also proposed a scheme\r\n     to embody volunteers for this service; but I fear the length\r\n     of the march, and a general scarcity of bread, which\r\n     prevails in some parts of North Carolina and this State, may\r\n     impede this service. About five hundred militia are ordered\r\n     down the Tennessee River, to chastise some new settlements\r\n     of renegade Cherokees that infest our southwestern frontier,\r\n     and prevent our navigation on that river, from which we\r\n     began to hope for great advantages. Our militia have full\r\n     possession of the Illinois and the posts on the Wabash; and\r\n     I am not without hopes that the same party may overawe the\r\n     Indians as far as Detroit. They are independent of General\r\n     McIntosh, whose numbers, although upwards of two thousand, I\r\n     think could not make any great progress, on account, it is\r\n     said, of the route they took, and the lateness of the\r\n     season.\r\n\r\n     \"The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected with less\r\n     than two hundred men, who will soon be reënforced; and, by\r\n     holding posts on the back of the Indians, it is hoped may\r\n     intimidate them. Forts Natchez and Morishac are again in the\r\n     enemy's hands; and from thence they infest and ruin our\r\n     trade on the Mississippi, on which river the Spaniards wish\r\n     to open a very interesting commerce with us. I have\r\n     requested Congress to authorize the conquest of those two\r\n     posts, as the possession of them will give a colorable\r\n     pretence to retain all West Florida, when a treaty may be\r\n     opened.\"[297]\r\n\r\nWithin two months after that letter was written, the dreaded warships\r\nof the enemy were ploughing the waters of Virginia: it was the\r\nsorrow-bringing expedition of Matthews and Sir George Collier. The\r\nnews of their arrival was thus conveyed by Governor Henry to the\r\npresident of Congress:--\r\n\r\n                                   WILLIAMSBURG, 11 May, 1779.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--On Saturday last, in the evening, a British fleet\r\n     amounting to about thirty sail ... came into the Bay of\r\n     Chesapeake, and the next day proceeded to Hampton Road,\r\n     where they anchored and remained quiet until yesterday about\r\n     noon, when several of the ships got under way, and proceeded\r\n     towards Portsmouth, which place I have no doubt they intend\r\n     to attack by water or by land or by both, as they have many\r\n     flat-bottomed boats with them for the purpose of landing\r\n     their troops. As I too well know the weakness of that\r\n     garrison, I am in great pain for the consequences, there\r\n     being great quantities of merchandise, the property of\r\n     French merchants and others in this State, at that place, as\r\n     well as considerable quantities of military stores, which,\r\n     tho' measures some time since were taken to remove, may\r\n     nevertheless fall into the enemy's hands. Whether they may\r\n     hereafter intend to fortify and maintain this post is at\r\n     present unknown to me, but the consequences which will\r\n     result to this State and to the United States finally if\r\n     such a measure should be adopted must be obvious. Whether it\r\n     may be in the power of Congress to adopt any measures which\r\n     can in any manner counteract the design of the enemy is\r\n     submitted to their wisdom. At present, I cannot avoid\r\n     intimating that I have the greatest reason to think that\r\n     many vessels from France with public and private merchandise\r\n     may unfortunately arrive while the enemy remain in perfect\r\n     possession of the Bay of Chesapeake, and fall victims\r\n     unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n     Every precaution will be taken to order lookout boats on the\r\n     seacoasts to furnish proper intelligence; but the success\r\n     attending this necessary measure will be precarious in the\r\n     present situation of things.[298]\r\n\r\nOn the next day the governor had still heavier tidings for the same\r\ncorrespondent:--\r\n\r\n                                      WILLIAMSBURG, May 12, 1779.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--I addressed you yesterday upon a subject of the\r\n     greatest consequence. The last night brought me the fatal\r\n     account of Portsmouth being in possession of the enemy.\r\n     Their force was too great to be resisted, and therefore the\r\n     fort was evacuated after destroying one capital ship\r\n     belonging to the State and one or two private ones loaded\r\n     with tobacco. Goods and merchandise, however, of very great\r\n     value fall into the enemy's hands. If Congress could by\r\n     solicitations procure a fleet superior to the enemy's force\r\n     to enter Chesapeake at this critical period, the prospect of\r\n     gain and advantage would be great indeed. I have the honor\r\n     to be, with the greatest regard, Sir,\r\n\r\n     Your most humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                P. HENRY.[299]\r\n\r\nTo meet this dreadful invasion, the governor attempted to arouse and\r\ndirect vigorous measures, in part by a proclamation, on the 14th of\r\nMay, announcing to the people of Virginia the facts of the case, \"and\r\nrequiring the county lieutenants and other military officers in the\r\nCommonwealth, and especially those on the navigable waters, to hold\r\ntheir respective militias in readiness to oppose the attempts of the\r\nenemy wherever they might be made.\"[300]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of the month, in a letter to the president of Congress, he\r\nreported the havoc then wrought by the enemy:--\r\n\r\n                                     WILLIAMSBURG, May 21, 1779.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--Being in the greatest haste to dispatch your express,\r\n     I have not time to give you any very particular information\r\n     concerning the present invasion. Let it suffice therefore to\r\n     inform Congress that the number of the enemy's ships are\r\n     nearly the same as was mentioned in my former letter; with\r\n     regard to the number of the troops which landed and took\r\n     Portsmouth, and afterwards proceeded and burnt, plundered,\r\n     and destroyed Suffolk, committing various barbarities, etc.,\r\n     we are still ignorant, as the accounts from the deserters\r\n     differ widely; perhaps, however, it may not exceed 2000 or\r\n     2500 men.\r\n\r\n     I trust that a sufficient number of troops are embodied and\r\n     stationed in certain proportions at this place, York,\r\n     Hampton, and on the south side of James River.... When any\r\n     further particulars come to my knowledge they shall be\r\n     communicated to Congress without delay.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, Sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                     P. HENRY.\r\n\r\n     P. S. I am pretty certain that the land forces are commanded\r\n     by Gen'l Matthews and the fleet by Sir George Collier.[301]\r\n\r\nIn the very midst of this ugly storm, it was required that the ship of\r\nstate should undergo a change of commanders. The third year for which\r\nGovernor Henry had been elected was nearly at an end. There were some\r\nmembers of the Assembly who thought him eligible as governor for still\r\nanother year, on the ground that his first election was by the\r\nconvention, and that the year of office which that body gave to him\r\n\"was merely provisory,\" and formed no proper part of his\r\nconstitutional term.[302] Governor Henry himself, however, could not\r\nfail to perceive the unfitness of any struggle upon such a question at\r\nsuch a time, as well as the futility which would attach to that high\r\noffice, if held, amid such perils, under a clouded title. Accordingly,\r\non the 28th of May, he cut short all discussion by sending to the\r\nspeaker of the House of Delegates the following letter:--\r\n\r\n                                                  May 28, 1779.\r\n\r\n     SIR,--The term for which I had the honor to be elected\r\n     governor by the late Assembly being just about to expire,\r\n     and the Constitution, as I think, making me ineligible to\r\n     that office, I take the liberty to communicate to the\r\n     Assembly through you, Sir, my intention to retire in four or\r\n     five days.\r\n\r\n     I have thought it necessary to give this notification of my\r\n     design, in order that the Assembly may have the earliest\r\n     opportunity of deliberating upon the choice of a successor\r\n     to me in office.\r\n\r\n     With great regard, I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\n     obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                P. HENRY.[303]\r\n\r\nOn the first of June, Thomas Jefferson was elected to succeed him in\r\noffice, but by a majority of only six votes out of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight.[304] On the following day Patrick Henry, having received\r\ncertain resolutions from the General Assembly[305] commending him for\r\nhis conduct while governor, graciously closed this chapter of his\r\nofficial life by the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--The House of Delegates have done me very great\r\n     honor in the vote expressive of their approbation of my\r\n     public conduct. I beg the favor of you, gentlemen, to convey\r\n     to that honorable house my most cordial acknowledgments, and\r\n     to assure them that I shall ever retain a grateful\r\n     remembrance of the high honor they have now conferred on\r\n     me.[306]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these frank voices of public appreciation over the\r\nfidelity and efficiency of his service as governor, there were\r\ndoubtless the usual murmurs of partisan criticism or of personal\r\nill-will. For example, a few days after Jefferson had taken his seat\r\nin the stately chair which Patrick Henry had just vacated, St. George\r\nTucker, in a letter to Theophilus Bland, gave expression to this\r\nsneer: \"_Sub rosa_, I wish his excellency's activity may be equal to\r\nthe abilities he possesses in so eminent a degree.... But if he should\r\ntread in the steps of his predecessor, there is not much to be\r\nexpected from the brightest talents.\"[307] Over against a taunt like\r\nthis, one can scarcely help placing the fact that the general of the\r\narmies who, for three stern years, had been accustomed to lean heavily\r\nfor help on this governor of Virginia, and who never paid idle\r\ncompliments, nevertheless paid many a tribute to the intelligence,\r\nzeal, and vigorous activity of Governor Henry's administration. Thus,\r\non the 27th of December, 1777, Washington writes to him: \"In several\r\nof my late letters I addressed you on the distress of the troops for\r\nwant of clothing. Your ready exertions to relieve them have given me\r\nthe highest satisfaction.\"[308] On the 19th of February, 1778,\r\nWashington again writes to him: \"I address myself to you, convinced\r\nthat our alarming distresses will engage your most serious\r\nconsideration, and that the full force of that zeal and vigor you\r\nhave manifested upon every other occasion, will now operate for our\r\nrelief, in a matter that so nearly affects the very existence of our\r\ncontest.\"[309] On the 19th of April, 1778, Washington once more writes\r\nto him: \"I hold myself infinitely obliged to the legislature for the\r\nready attention which they have paid to my representation of the wants\r\nof the army, and to you for the strenuous manner in which you have\r\nrecommended to the people an observance of my request.\"[310] Finally,\r\nif any men had even better opportunities than Washington for\r\nestimating correctly Governor Henry's efficiency in his great office,\r\nsurely those men were his intimate associates, the members of the\r\nVirginia legislature. It is quite possible that their first election\r\nof him as governor may have been in ignorance of his real qualities as\r\nan executive officer; but this cannot be said of their second and of\r\ntheir third elections of him, each one of which was made, as we have\r\nseen, without one audible lisp of opposition. Is it to be believed\r\nthat, if he had really shown that lack of executive efficiency which\r\nSt. George Tucker's sneer implies, such a body of men, in such a\r\ncrisis of public danger, would have twice and thrice elected him to\r\nthe highest executive office in the State, and that, too, without one\r\ndissenting vote? To say so, indeed, is to fix a far more damning\r\ncensure upon them than upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[293] Clark's _Campaign in the Illinois_, 95-97, where Governor\r\nHenry's public and private instructions are given in full.\r\n\r\n[294] MS.\r\n\r\n[295] _Jour.

In the course of that time, also, he had sold his\r\nestate of Scotchtown, in Hanover County, and had purchased a large\r\ntract of land in the new county of Henry,--a county situated about two\r\nhundred miles southwest from Richmond, along the North Carolina\r\nboundary, and named, of course, in honor of himself. To his new estate\r\nthere, called Leatherwood, consisting of about ten thousand acres, he\r\nremoved early in the summer of 1779. This continued to be his home\r\nuntil he resumed the office of governor in November, 1784.[314]\r\n\r\nAfter the storm and stress of so many years of public life, and of\r\npublic life in an epoch of revolution, the invalid body, the\r\ncare-burdened spirit, of Patrick Henry must have found great\r\nrefreshment in this removal to a distant, wild, and mountainous\r\nsolitude. In undisturbed seclusion, he there remained during the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1779, and even the succeeding winter and\r\nspring,--scarcely able to hear the far-off noises of the great\r\nstruggle in which he had hitherto borne so rugged a part, and of which\r\nthe victorious issue was then to be seen by him, though dimly, through\r\nmany a murky rack of selfishness, cowardice, and crime.\r\n\r\nHis successor in the office of governor was Thomas Jefferson, the\r\njovial friend of his own jovial youth, bound to him still by that\r\nhearty friendship which was founded on congeniality of political\r\nsentiment, but was afterward to die away, at least on Jefferson's\r\nside, into alienation and hate. To this dear friend Patrick Henry\r\nwrote late in that winter, from his hermitage among the eastward\r\nfastnesses of the Blue Ridge, a remarkable letter, which has never\r\nbefore been in print, and which is full of interest for us on account\r\nof its impulsive and self-revealing words. Its tone of despondency,\r\nalmost of misanthropy,--so unnatural to Patrick Henry,--is perhaps a\r\ntoken of that sickness of body which had made the soul sick too, and\r\nhad then driven the writer into the wilderness, and still kept him\r\nthere:--\r\n\r\n     TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                   LEATHERWOOD, 15th Feby., 1780.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--I return you many thanks for your favor by Mr.\r\n     Sanders. The kind notice you were pleased to take of me was\r\n     particularly obliging, as I have scarcely heard a word of\r\n     public matters since I moved up in the retirement where I\r\n     live.\r\n\r\n     I have had many anxieties for our commonwealth, principally\r\n     occasioned by the depreciation of our money. To judge by\r\n     this, which somebody has called the pulse of the state, I\r\n     have feared that our body politic was dangerously sick. God\r\n     grant it may not be unto death. But I cannot forbear\r\n     thinking, the present increase of prices is in great part\r\n     owing to a kind of habit, which is now of four or five\r\n     years' growth, which is fostered by a mistaken avarice, and\r\n     like other habits hard to part with. For there is really\r\n     very little money hereabouts.\r\n\r\n     What you say of the practice of our distinguished Tories\r\n     perfectly agrees with my own observation, and the attempts\r\n     to raise prejudices against the French, I know, were begun\r\n     when I lived below. What gave me the utmost pain was to see\r\n     some men, indeed very many, who were thought good Whigs,\r\n     keep company with the miscreants,--wretches who, I am\r\n     satisfied, were laboring our destruction. This countenance\r\n     shown them is of fatal tendency. They should be shunned and\r\n     execrated, and this is the only way to supply the place of\r\n     legal conviction and punishment. But this is an effort of\r\n     virtue, small as it seems, of which our countrymen are not\r\n     capable.\r\n\r\n     Indeed, I will own to you, my dear Sir, that observing this\r\n     impunity and even respect, which some wicked individuals\r\n     have met with while their guilt was clear as the sun, has\r\n     sickened me, and made me sometimes wish to be in retirement\r\n     for the rest of my life. I will, however, be down, on the\r\n     next Assembly, if I am chosen. My health, I am satisfied,\r\n     will never again permit a close application to sedentary\r\n     business, and I even doubt whether I can remain below long\r\n     enough to serve in the Assembly. I will, however, make the\r\n     trial.\r\n\r\n     But tell me, do you remember any instance where tyranny was\r\n     destroyed and freedom established on its ruins, among a\r\n     people possessing so small a share of virtue and public\r\n     spirit? I recollect none, and this, more than the British\r\n     arms, makes me fearful of final success without a reform.\r\n     But when or how this is to be effected, I have not the means\r\n     of judging. I most sincerely wish you health and prosperity.\r\n     If you can spare time to drop me a line now and then, it\r\n     will be highly obliging to, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\n     friend and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                              P. HENRY.[315]\r\n\r\nThe next General Assembly, which he thus promised to attend in case he\r\nshould be chosen, met at Richmond on the 1st of May, 1780. It hardly\r\nneeds to be mentioned that the people of Henry County were proud to\r\nchoose him as one of their members in that body; but he seems not to\r\nhave taken his seat there until about the 19th of May.[316] From the\r\nmoment of his arrival in the House of Delegates, every kind of\r\nresponsibility and honor was laid upon him. This was his first\r\nappearance in such an assembly since the proclamation of independence;\r\nand the prestige attaching to his name, as well as his own undimmed\r\ngenius for leadership, made him not only the most conspicuous person\r\nin the house, but the nearly absolute director of its business in\r\nevery detail of opinion and of procedure on which he should choose to\r\nexpress himself,--his only rival, in any particular, being Richard\r\nHenry Lee. It helps one now to understand the real reputation he had\r\namong his contemporaries for practical ability, and for a habit of\r\nshrinking from none of the commonplace drudgeries of legislative work,\r\nthat during the first few days after his accession to the House he\r\nwas placed on the committee of ways and means; on a committee \"to\r\ninquire into the present state of the account of the commonwealth\r\nagainst the United States, and the most speedy and effectual method of\r\nfinally settling the same;\" on a committee to prepare a bill for the\r\nrepeal of a part of the act \"for sequestering British property,\r\nenabling those indebted to British subjects to pay off such debts, and\r\ndirecting the proceedings in suits where such subjects are parties;\"\r\non three several committees respecting the powers and duties of high\r\nsheriffs and of grand juries; and, finally, on a committee to notify\r\nJefferson of his reëlection as governor, and to report his answer to\r\nthe House. On the 7th of June, however, after a service of little more\r\nthan two weeks, his own sad apprehensions respecting his health seem\r\nto have been realized, and he was obliged to ask leave to withdraw\r\nfrom the House for the remainder of the session.[317]\r\n\r\nAt the autumn session of the legislature he was once more in his\r\nplace. On the 6th of November, the day on which the House was\r\norganized, he was made chairman of the committee on privileges and\r\nelections, and also of a committee \"for the better defence of the\r\nsouthern frontier,\" and was likewise placed on the committee on\r\npropositions and grievances, as well as on the committee on courts of\r\njustice. On the following day he was made a member of a committee for\r\nthe defence of the eastern frontier. On the 10th of November he was\r\nplaced on a committee to bring in a bill relating to the enlistment of\r\nVirginia troops, and to the redemption of the state bills of credit\r\nthen in circulation, and the emission of new bills. On the 22d of\r\nNovember he was made a member of a committee to which was again\r\nreferred the account between the State and the United States. On the\r\n9th of December he was made a member of a committee to draw up bills\r\nfor the organization and maintenance of a navy for the State, and the\r\nprotection of navigation and commerce upon its waters. On the 14th of\r\nDecember he was made chairman of a committee to draw up a bill for the\r\nbetter regulation and discipline of the militia, and of still another\r\ncommittee to prepare a bill \"for supplying the army with clothes and\r\nprovisions.\"[318] On the 28th of December, the House having knowledge\r\nof the arrival in town of poor General Gates, then drooping under the\r\nburden of those Southern willows which he had so plentifully gathered\r\nat Camden, Patrick Henry introduced the following magnanimous\r\nresolution:--\r\n\r\n     \"That a committee of four be appointed to wait on Major\r\n     General Gates, and to assure him of the high regard and\r\n     esteem of this House; that the remembrance of his former\r\n     glorious services cannot be obliterated by any reverse of\r\n     fortune; but that this House, ever mindful of his great\r\n     merit, will omit no opportunity of testifying to the world\r\n     the gratitude which, as a member of the American Union, this\r\n     country owes to him in his military character.\"[319]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of January, 1781, the last day of the session, the House\r\nadopted, on Patrick Henry's motion, a resolution authorizing the\r\ngovernor to convene the next meeting of the legislature at some other\r\nplace than Richmond, in case its assembling in that city should \"be\r\nrendered inconvenient by the operations of an invading enemy,\"[320] a\r\nresolution reflecting their sense of the peril then hanging over the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBefore the legislature could again meet, events proved that it was no\r\nimaginary danger against which Patrick Henry's resolution had been\r\nintended to provide. On the 2d of January, 1781, the very day on which\r\nthe legislature had adjourned, a hostile fleet conveyed into the James\r\nRiver a force of about eight hundred men under command of Benedict\r\nArnold, whose eagerness to ravage Virginia was still further\r\nfacilitated by the arrival, on the 26th of March, of two thousand men\r\nunder General Phillips. Moreover, Lord Cornwallis, having beaten\r\nGeneral Greene at Guilford, in North Carolina, on the 15th of March,\r\nseemed to be gathering force for a speedy advance into Virginia. That\r\nthe roar of his guns would soon be heard in the outskirts of their\r\ncapital, was what all Virginians then felt to be inevitable.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, it is not strange that a session of the\r\nlegislature, which is said to have been held on the 1st of March,[321]\r\nshould have been a very brief one, or that when the 7th of May\r\narrived--the day for its reassembling at Richmond--no quorum should\r\nhave been present; or that, on the 10th of May, the few members who\r\nhad arrived in Richmond should have voted, in deference to \"the\r\napproach of an hostile army,\"[322] to adjourn to Charlottesville,--a\r\nplace of far greater security, ninety-seven miles to the northwest,\r\namong the mountains of Albemarle. By the 20th of May, Cornwallis\r\nreached Petersburg, twenty-three miles south of Richmond; and shortly\r\nafterward, pushing across the James and the Chickahominy, he encamped\r\non the North Anna, in the county of Hanover. Thus, at last, the single\r\ncounty of Louisa then separated him from that county in which was the\r\nhome of the governor of the State, and where was then convened its\r\nlegislature,--Patrick Henry himself being present and in obvious\r\ndirection of all its business. The opportunity to bag such game, Lord\r\nCornwallis was not the man to let slip. Accordingly, on Sunday, the 3d\r\nof June, he dispatched a swift expedition under Tarleton, to surprise\r\nand capture the members of the legislature, \"to seize on the person of\r\nthe governor,\" and \"to spread on his route devastation and\r\nterror.\"[323] In this entire scheme, doubtless, Tarleton would have\r\nsucceeded, had it not been that as he and his troopers, on that fair\r\nSabbath day, were hurrying past the Cuckoo tavern in Louisa, one\r\nCaptain John Jouette, watching from behind the windows, espied them,\r\ndivined their object, and mounting a fleet horse, and taking a shorter\r\nroute, got into Charlottesville a few hours in advance of them, just\r\nin time to give the alarm, and to set the imperiled legislators\r\na-flying to the mountains for safety.\r\n\r\nThen, by all accounts, was witnessed a display of the locomotive\r\nenergies of grave and potent senators, such as this world has not\r\noften exhibited. Of this tragically comical incident, of course, the\r\njournal of the House of Delegates makes only the most placid and\r\nforbearing mention. For Monday, June 4, its chief entry is as follows:\r\n\"There being reason to apprehend an immediate incursion of the enemy's\r\ncavalry to this place, which renders it indispensable that the General\r\nAssembly should forthwith adjourn to a place of greater security;\r\nresolved, that this House be adjourned until Thursday next, then to\r\nmeet at the town of Staunton, in the county of Augusta,\"--a town\r\nthirty-nine miles farther west, beyond a chain of mountains, and only\r\nto be reached by them or their pursuers through difficult passes in\r\nthe Blue Ridge. The next entry in the journal is dated at Staunton, on\r\nthe 7th of June, and, very properly, is merely a prosaic and\r\nbusiness-like record of the reassembling of the House according to the\r\nadjournment aforesaid.[324]\r\n\r\nBut as to some of the things that happened in that interval of panic\r\nand of scrambling flight, popular tradition has not been equally\r\nforbearing; and while the anecdotes upon that subject, which have\r\ndescended to our time, are very likely decorated by many tassels of\r\nexaggeration and of myth, they yet have, doubtless, some slight\r\nframework of truth, and do really portray for us the actual beliefs of\r\nmany people in Virginia respecting a number of their celebrated men,\r\nand especially respecting some of the less celebrated traits of those\r\nmen. For example, it is related that on the sudden adjournment of the\r\nHouse, caused by this dusty and breathless apparition of the speedful\r\nJouette, and his laconic intimation that Tarleton was coming, the\r\nmembers, though somewhat accustomed to ceremony, stood not upon the\r\norder of their going, but went at once,--taking first to their horses,\r\nand then to the woods; and that, breaking up into small parties of\r\nfugitives, they thus made their several ways, as best they could,\r\nthrough the passes of the mountains leading to the much-desired\r\nseclusion of Staunton. One of these parties consisted of Benjamin\r\nHarrison, Colonel William Christian, John Tyler, and Patrick Henry.\r\nLate in the day, tired and hungry, they stopped their horses at the\r\ndoor of a small hut, in a gorge of the hills, and asked for food. An\r\nold woman, who came to the door, and who was alone in the house,\r\ndemanded of them who they were, and where they were from. Patrick\r\nHenry, who acted as spokesman of the party, answered: \"We are members\r\nof the legislature, and have just been compelled to leave\r\nCharlottesville on account of the approach of the enemy.\" \"Ride on,\r\nthen, ye cowardly knaves,\" replied she, in great wrath; \"here have my\r\nhusband and sons just gone to Charlottesville to fight for ye, and you\r\nrunning away with all your might. Clear out--ye shall have nothing\r\nhere.\" \"But,\" rejoined Mr. Henry, in an expostulating tone, \"we were\r\nobliged to fly. It would not do for the legislature to be broken up by\r\nthe enemy. Here is Mr. Speaker Harrison; you don't think he would have\r\nfled had it not been necessary?\" \"I always thought a great deal of Mr.\r\nHarrison till now,\" answered the old woman; \"but he'd no business to\r\nrun from the enemy,\" and she was about to shut the door in their\r\nfaces. \"Wait a moment, my good woman,\" urged Mr. Henry; \"you would\r\nhardly believe that Mr. Tyler or Colonel Christian would take to\r\nflight if there were not good cause for so doing?\" \"No, indeed, that I\r\nwouldn't,\" she replied. \"But,\" exclaimed he, \"Mr. Tyler and Colonel\r\nChristian are here.\" \"They here? Well, I never would have thought it;\"\r\nand she stood for a moment in doubt, but at once added, \"No matter. We\r\nlove these gentlemen, and I didn't suppose they would ever run away\r\nfrom the British; but since they have, they shall have nothing to eat\r\nin my house. You may ride along.\" In this desperate situation Mr.\r\nTyler then stepped forward and said, \"What would you say, my good\r\nwoman, if I were to tell you that Patrick Henry fled with the rest of\r\nus?\" \"Patrick Henry! I should tell you there wasn't a word of truth in\r\nit,\" she answered angrily; \"Patrick Henry would never do such a\r\ncowardly thing.\" \"But this is Patrick Henry,\" said Mr. Tyler, pointing\r\nto him. The old woman was amazed; but after some reflection, and with\r\na convulsive twitch or two at her apron string, she said, \"Well, then,\r\nif that's Patrick Henry, it must be all right. Come in, and ye shall\r\nhave the best I have in the house.\"[325]\r\n\r\nThe pitiless tongue of tradition does not stop here, but proceeds to\r\nnarrate other alleged experiences of this our noble, though somewhat\r\ndisconcerted, Patrick. Arrived at last in Staunton, and walking\r\nthrough its reassuring streets, he is said to have met one Colonel\r\nWilliam Lewis, to whom the face of the orator was then unknown; and to\r\nhave told to this stranger the story of the flight of the legislature\r\nfrom Albemarle. \"If Patrick Henry had been in Albemarle,\" was the\r\nstranger's comment, \"the British dragoons never would have passed over\r\nthe Rivanna River.\"[326]\r\n\r\nThe tongue of tradition, at last grown quite reckless, perhaps, of\r\nits own credit, still further relates that even at Staunton these\r\nillustrious fugitives did not feel entirely sure that they were beyond\r\nthe reach of Tarleton's men. A few nights after their arrival there,\r\nas the story runs, upon some sudden alarm, several of them sprang from\r\ntheir beds, and, imperfectly clapping on their clothes, fled out of\r\nthe town, and took refuge at the plantation of one Colonel George\r\nMoffett, near which, they had been told, was a cave in which they\r\nmight the more effectually conceal themselves. Mrs. Moffett, though\r\nnot knowing the names of these flitting Solons, yet received them with\r\ntrue Virginian hospitality: but the next morning, at breakfast, she\r\nmade the unlucky remark that there was one member of the legislature\r\nwho certainly would not have run from the enemy. \"Who is he?\" was then\r\nasked. Her reply was, \"Patrick Henry.\" At that moment a gentleman of\r\nthe party, himself possessed of but one boot, was observed to blush\r\nconsiderably. Furthermore, as soon as possible after breakfast, these\r\nimperiled legislators departed in search of the cave; shortly after\r\nwhich a negro from Staunton rode up, carrying in his hand a solitary\r\nboot, and inquiring earnestly for Patrick Henry. In that way, as the\r\nmodern reporter of this very debatable tradition unkindly adds, the\r\nadmiring Mrs. Moffett ascertained who it was that the boot fitted; and\r\nhe further suggests that, whatever Mrs. Moffett's emotions were at\r\nthat time, those of Patrick must have been, \"Give me liberty, but not\r\ndeath.\"[327]\r\n\r\nPassing by these whimsical tales, we have now to add that the\r\nlegislature, having on the 7th of June entered upon its work at\r\nStaunton, steadily continued it there until the 23d of the month, when\r\nit adjourned in orderly fashion, to meet again in the following\r\nOctober. Governor Jefferson, whose second year of office had expired\r\ntwo days before the flight of himself and the legislature from\r\nCharlottesville, did not accompany that body to Staunton, but pursued\r\nhis own way to Poplar Forest and to Bedford, where, \"remote from the\r\nlegislature,\"[328] he remained during the remainder of its session. On\r\nthe 12th of June, Thomas Nelson was elected as his successor in\r\noffice.[329]\r\n\r\nIt was during this period of confusion and terror that, as Jefferson\r\nalleges, the legislature once more had before it the project of a\r\ndictator, in the criminal sense of that word; and, upon Jefferson's\r\nprivate authority, both Wirt and Girardin long afterward named Patrick\r\nHenry as the man who was intended for this profligate honor.[330] We\r\nneed not here repeat what was said, in our narrative of the closing\r\nweeks of 1776, concerning this terrible posthumous imputation upon the\r\npublic and private character of Patrick Henry. Nearly everything which\r\nthen appeared to the discredit of this charge in connection with the\r\nearlier date, is equally applicable to it in connection with the later\r\ndate also. Moreover, as regards this later date, there has recently\r\nbeen discovered a piece of contemporaneous testimony which shows that,\r\nwhatever may have been the scheme for a dictatorship in Virginia in\r\n1781, it was a great military chieftain who was wanted for the\r\nposition; and, apparently, that Patrick Henry was not then even\r\nmentioned in the affair. On the 9th of June, 1781, Captain H. Young,\r\nthough not a member of the House of Delegates, writes from Staunton to\r\nColonel William Davies as follows: \"Two days ago, Mr. Nicholas gave\r\nnotice that he should this day move to have a dictator appointed.\r\nGeneral Washington and General Greene are talked of. I dare say your\r\nknowledge of these worthy gentlemen will be sufficient to convince you\r\nthat neither of them will, or ought to, accept of such an\r\nappointment.... We have but a thin House of Delegates; but they are\r\nzealous, I think, in the cause of virtue.\"[331] Furthermore, the\r\njournal of that House contains no record of any such motion having\r\nbeen made; and it is probable that it never was made, and that the\r\nsubject never came before the legislature in any such form as to call\r\nfor its notice.\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to both the dates mentioned by Jefferson for the\r\nappearance of the scheme, Edmund Randolph has left explicit testimony\r\nto the effect that such a scheme never had any substantial existence\r\nat all: \"Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, speaks with great\r\nbitterness against those members of the Assembly in the years 1776 and\r\n1781, who espoused the erection of a dictator. Coming from such\r\nauthority, the invective infects the character of the legislature,\r\nnotwithstanding he has restricted the charge to less than a majority,\r\nand acknowledged the spotlessness of most of them.... The subject was\r\nnever before them, except as an article of newspaper intelligence, and\r\neven then not in a form which called for their attention. Against this\r\nunfettered monster, which deserved all the impassioned reprobation of\r\nMr. Jefferson, their tones, it may be affirmed, would have been loud\r\nand tremendous.\"[332]\r\n\r\nFor its autumn session, in 1781, the legislature did not reach an\r\norganization until the 19th of November,--just one month after the\r\nsurrender of Cornwallis. Eight days after the organization of the\r\nHouse, Patrick Henry took his seat;[333] and after a service of less\r\nthan four weeks, he obtained leave of absence for the remainder of the\r\nsession.[334] During 1782 his attendance upon the House seems to have\r\nbeen limited to the spring session. At the organization of the House,\r\non the 12th of May, 1783, he was in his place again, and during that\r\nsession, as well as the autumnal one, his attendance was close and\r\nlaborious. At both sessions of the House in 1784 he was present and\r\nin full force; but in the very midst of these employments he was\r\ninterrupted by his election as governor, on the 17th of\r\nNovember,--shortly after which, he withdrew to his country-seat in\r\norder to remove his family thence to the capital.\r\n\r\nIn the course of all these labors in the legislature, and amid a\r\nmultitude of topics merely local and temporary, Patrick Henry had\r\noccasion to deal publicly, and under the peculiar responsibilities of\r\nleadership, with nearly all the most important and difficult questions\r\nthat came before the American people during the later years of the war\r\nand the earlier years of the peace. The journal of the House for that\r\nperiod omits all mention of words spoken in debate; and although it\r\ndoes occasionally enable us to ascertain on which side of certain\r\nquestions Patrick Henry stood, it leaves us in total ignorance of his\r\nreasons for any position which he chose to take. In trying, therefore,\r\nto estimate the quality of his statesmanship when dealing with these\r\nquestions, we lack a part of the evidence which is essential to any\r\njust conclusion; and we are left peculiarly at the mercy of those\r\nsweeping censures which have been occasionally applied to his\r\npolitical conduct during that period.[335]\r\n\r\nOn the assurance of peace, in the spring of 1783, perhaps the earliest\r\nand the knottiest problem which had to be taken up was the one\r\nrelating to that vast body of Americans who then bore the\r\ncontumelious name of Tories,--those Americans who, against all loss\r\nand ignominy, had steadily remained loyal to the unity of the British\r\nempire, unflinching in their rejection of the constitutional heresy of\r\nAmerican secession. How should these execrable beings--the defeated\r\nparty in a long and most rancorous civil war--be treated by the party\r\nwhich was at last victorious? Many of them were already in exile:\r\nshould they be kept there? Many were still in this country: should\r\nthey be banished from it? As a matter of fact, the exasperation of\r\npublic feeling against the Tories was, at that time, so universal and\r\nso fierce that no statesman could then lift up his voice in their\r\nfavor without dashing himself against the angriest currents of popular\r\nopinion and passion, and risking the loss of the public favor toward\r\nhimself. Nevertheless, precisely this is what Patrick Henry had the\r\ncourage to do. While the war lasted, no man spoke against the Tories\r\nmore sternly than did he. The war being ended, and its great purpose\r\nsecured, no man, excepting perhaps Alexander Hamilton, was so prompt\r\nand so energetic in urging that all animosities of the war should be\r\nlaid aside, and that a policy of magnanimous forbearance should be\r\npursued respecting these baffled opponents of American independence.\r\nIt was in this spirit that, as soon as possible after the cessation of\r\nhostilities, he introduced a bill for the repeal of an act \"to\r\nprohibit intercourse with, and the admission of British subjects\r\ninto\" Virginia,[336]--language well understood to refer to the Tories.\r\nThis measure, we are told, not only excited surprise, but \"was, at\r\nfirst, received with a repugnance apparently insuperable.\" Even his\r\nintimate friend John Tyler, the speaker of the House, hotly resisted\r\nit in the committee of the whole, and in the course of his argument,\r\nturning to Patrick Henry, asked \"how he, above all other men, could\r\nthink of inviting into his family an enemy from whose insults and\r\ninjuries he had suffered so severely?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this appeal, Patrick Henry declared that the question\r\nbefore them was not one of personal feeling; that it was a national\r\nquestion; and that in discussing it they should be willing to\r\nsacrifice all personal resentments, all private wrongs. He then\r\nproceeded to unfold the proposition that America had everything out of\r\nwhich to make a great nation--except people.\r\n\r\n     \"Your great want, sir, is the want of men; and these you\r\n     must have, and will have speedily, if you are wise. Do you\r\n     ask how you are to get them? Open your doors, sir, and they\r\n     will come in. The population of the Old World is full to\r\n     overflowing; that population is ground, too, by the\r\n     oppressions of the governments under which they live. Sir,\r\n     they are already standing on tiptoe upon their native\r\n     shores, and looking to your coasts with a wishful and\r\n     longing eye.... But gentlemen object to any accession from\r\n     Great Britain, and particularly to the return of the British\r\n     refugees. Sir, I feel no objection to the return of those\r\n     deluded people. They have, to be sure, mistaken their own\r\n     interests most wofully, and most wofully have they suffered\r\n     the punishment due to their offences. But the relations\r\n     which we bear to them and to their native country are now\r\n     changed. Their king hath acknowledged our independence. The\r\n     quarrel is over. Peace hath returned, and found us a free\r\n     people. Let us have the magnanimity, sir, to lay aside our\r\n     antipathies and prejudices, and consider the subject in a\r\n     political light. Those are an enterprising, moneyed people.\r\n     They will be serviceable in taking off the surplus produce\r\n     of our lands, and supplying us with necessaries during the\r\n     infant state of our manufactures. Even if they be inimical\r\n     to us in point of feeling and principle, I can see no\r\n     objection, in a political view, in making them tributary to\r\n     our advantage. And, as I have no prejudices to prevent my\r\n     making this use of them, so, sir, I have no fear of any\r\n     mischief that they can do us. Afraid of them? What, sir\r\n     [said he, rising to one of his loftiest attitudes, and\r\n     assuming a look of the most indignant and sovereign\r\n     contempt], shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at\r\n     our feet, now be afraid of his whelps?\"[337]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit he dealt with the restraints on British commerce\r\nimposed during the war,--a question similar to the one just mentioned,\r\nat least in this particular, that it was enveloped in the angry\r\nprejudices born of the conflict just ended. The journal for the 13th\r\nof May, 1783, has this entry: \"Mr. Henry presented, according to\r\norder, a bill 'to repeal the several Acts of Assembly for seizure and\r\ncondemnation of British goods found on land;' and the same was\r\nreceived and read the first time, and ordered to be read a second\r\ntime.\" In advocating this measure, he seems to have lifted the\r\ndiscussion clear above all petty considerations to the plane of high\r\nand permanent principle, and, according to one of his chief\r\nantagonists in that debate, to have met all objections by arguments\r\nthat were \"beyond all expression eloquent and sublime.\" After\r\ndescribing the embarrassments and distresses of the situation and\r\ntheir causes, he took the ground that perfect freedom was as necessary\r\nto the health and vigor of commerce as it was to the health and vigor\r\nof citizenship. \"Why should we fetter commerce? If a man is in chains,\r\nhe droops and bows to the earth, for his spirits are broken; but let\r\nhim twist the fetters from his legs, and he will stand erect. Fetter\r\nnot commerce, sir. Let her be as free as air; she will range the whole\r\ncreation, and return on the wings of the four winds of heaven, to\r\nbless the land with plenty.\"[338]\r\n\r\nBesides these and other problems in the foreign relations of the\r\ncountry, there remained, of course, at the end of the war, several\r\nvast domestic problems for American statesmanship to grapple\r\nwith,--one of these being the relations of the white race to their\r\nperpetual neighbors, the Indians. In the autumn session of 1784, in a\r\nseries of efforts said to have been marked by \"irresistible\r\nearnestness and eloquence,\" he secured the favorable attention of the\r\nHouse to this ancient problem, and even to his own daring and\r\nstatesmanlike solution of it. The whole subject, as he thought, had\r\nbeen commonly treated by the superior race in a spirit not only mean\r\nand hard, but superficial also; the result being nearly two centuries\r\nof mutual suspicion, hatred, and slaughter. At last the time had come\r\nfor the superior race to put an end to this traditional disaster and\r\ndisgrace. Instead of tampering with the difficulty by remedies applied\r\nmerely to the surface, he was for striking at the root of it, namely,\r\nat the deep divergence in sympathy and in interest between the two\r\nraces. There was but one way in which to do this: it was for the white\r\nrace to treat the Indians, consistently, as human beings, and as fast\r\nas possible to identify their interests with our own along the entire\r\nrange of personal concerns,--in property, government, society, and,\r\nespecially, in domestic life. In short, he proposed to encourage, by a\r\nsystem of pecuniary bounties, the practice of marriage between members\r\nof the two races, believing that such ties, once formed, would be an\r\ninviolable pledge of mutual friendship, fidelity, and forbearance, and\r\nwould gradually lead to the transformation of the Indians into a\r\ncivilized and Christian people. His bill for this purpose, elaborately\r\ndrawn up, was carried through its second reading and \"engrossed for\r\nits final passage,\" when, by his sudden removal from the floor of the\r\nHouse to the governor's chair, the measure was deprived of its\r\nall-conquering champion, and, on the third reading, it fell a\r\nsacrifice to the Caucasian rage and scorn of the members.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to note, also, that during this period of service in the\r\nlegislature Patrick Henry marched straight against public opinion, and\r\njeoparded his popularity, on two or three other subjects. For example,\r\nthe mass of the people of Virginia were then so angrily opposed to the\r\nold connection between church and state that they occasionally saw\r\ndanger even in projects which in no way involved such a connection.\r\nThis was the case with Patrick Henry's necessary and most innocent\r\nmeasure \"for the incorporation of all societies of the Christian\r\nreligion which may apply for the same;\" likewise, his bill for the\r\nincorporation of the clergy of the Episcopal Church; and, finally, his\r\nmore questionable and more offensive resolution for requiring all\r\ncitizens of the State to contribute to the expense of supporting some\r\nform of religious worship according to their own preference.\r\n\r\nWhether, in these several measures, Patrick Henry was right or wrong,\r\none thing, at least, is obvious: no politician who could thus beard in\r\nhis very den the lion of public opinion can be accurately described as\r\na demagogue.\r\n\r\nWith respect to those amazing gifts of speech by which, in the House\r\nof Delegates, he thus repeatedly swept all opposition out of his way,\r\nand made people think as he wished them to do, often in the very\r\nteeth of their own immediate interests or prepossessions, an amusing\r\ninstance was mentioned, many years afterward, by President James\r\nMadison. During the war Virginia had paid her soldiers in certificates\r\nfor the amounts due them, to be redeemed in cash at some future time.\r\nIn many cases, the poverty of the soldiers had induced them to sell\r\nthese certificates, for trifling sums in ready money, to certain\r\nspeculators, who were thus making a traffic out of the public\r\ndistress. For the purpose of checking this cruel and harmful business,\r\nMadison brought forward a suitable bill, which, as he told the story,\r\nPatrick Henry supported with an eloquence so irresistible that it was\r\ncarried through the House without an opposing vote; while a notorious\r\nspeculator in these very certificates, having listened from the\r\ngallery to Patrick Henry's speech, at its conclusion so far forgot his\r\nown interest in the question as to exclaim, \"That bill ought to\r\npass.\"[339]\r\n\r\nConcerning his appearance and his manner of speech in those days, a\r\nbit of testimony comes down to us from Spencer Roane, who, as he tells\r\nus, first \"met with Patrick Henry in the Assembly of 1783.\" He adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"I also then met with R. H. Lee.... I lodged with Lee one or\r\n     two sessions, and was perfectly acquainted with him, while I\r\n     was yet a stranger to Mr. H. These two gentlemen were the\r\n     great leaders in the House of Delegates, and were almost\r\n     constantly opposed. Notwithstanding my habits of intimacy\r\n     with Mr. Lee, I found myself obliged to vote with P. H.\r\n     against him in '83, and against Madison in '84, ... but with\r\n     several important exceptions. I voted against him (P. H.), I\r\n     recollect, on the subject of the refugees,--he was for\r\n     permitting their return; on the subject of a general\r\n     assessment; and the act incorporating the Episcopal Church.\r\n     I voted with him, in general, because he was, I thought, a\r\n     more practical statesman than Madison (time has made Madison\r\n     more practical), and a less selfish one than Lee. As an\r\n     orator, Mr. Henry demolished Madison with as much ease as\r\n     Samson did the cords that bound him before he was shorn. Mr.\r\n     Lee held a greater competition.... Mr. Lee was a polished\r\n     gentleman. His person was not very good; and he had lost the\r\n     use of one of his hands; but his manner was perfectly\r\n     graceful. His language was always chaste, and, although\r\n     somewhat too monotonous, his speeches were always pleasing;\r\n     yet he did not ravish your senses, nor carry away your\r\n     judgment by storm.... Henry was almost always victorious. He\r\n     was as much superior to Lee in temper as in eloquence....\r\n     Mr. Henry was inferior to Lee in the gracefulness of his\r\n     action, and perhaps also in the chasteness of his language;\r\n     yet his language was seldom incorrect, and his address\r\n     always striking. He had a fine blue eye; and an earnest\r\n     manner which made it impossible not to attend to him. His\r\n     speaking was unequal, and always rose with the subject and\r\n     the exigency. In this respect, he entirely differed from Mr.\r\n     Lee, who always was equal. At some times, Mr. Henry would\r\n     seem to hobble, especially in the beginning of his speeches;\r\n     and, at others, his tones would be almost disagreeable; yet\r\n     it was by means of his tones, and the happy modulation of\r\n     his voice, that his speaking perhaps had its greatest\r\n     effect. He had a happy articulation, and a clear, distinct,\r\n     strong voice; and every syllable was distinctly uttered. He\r\n     was very unassuming as to himself, amounting almost to\r\n     humility, and very respectful towards his competitor; the\r\n     consequence was that no feeling of disgust or animosity was\r\n     arrayed against him. His exordiums in particular were often\r\n     hobbling and always unassuming. He knew mankind too well to\r\n     promise much.... He was great at a reply, and greater in\r\n     proportion to the pressure which was bearing upon him. The\r\n     resources of his mind and of his eloquence were equal to any\r\n     drafts which could be made upon them. He took but short\r\n     notes of what fell from his adversaries, and disliked the\r\n     drudgery of composition; yet it is a mistake to say that he\r\n     could not write well.\"[340]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[311] Rives, _Life of Madison_, i. 189, note.\r\n\r\n[312] _Jour.

For\r\nthe four or five years immediately following that date, the salient\r\nfacts in his career seem to group themselves around the story of his\r\nrelation to that vast national movement which ended in an entire\r\nreorganization of the American Republic under a new Constitution.\r\nWhoever will take the trouble to examine the evidence now at hand\r\nbearing upon the case, can hardly fail to convince himself that the\r\ntrue story of Patrick Henry's opposition to that great movement has\r\nnever yet been told. Men have usually misconceived, when they have not\r\naltogether overlooked, the motives for his opposition, the spirit in\r\nwhich he conducted it, and the beneficent effects which were\r\naccomplished by it; while his ultimate and firm approval of the new\r\nConstitution, after it had received the chief amendments called for by\r\nhis criticisms, has been passionately described as an example of gross\r\npolitical fickleness and inconsistency, instead of being, as it really\r\nwas, a most logical proceeding on his part, and in perfect harmony\r\nwith the principles underlying his whole public career.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on a story so fascinating for the light it throws on\r\nthe man and on the epoch, it is well that we should stay long enough\r\nto glance at what we may call the incidental facts in his life, for\r\nthese four or five years now to be looked into.\r\n\r\nNot far from the time of his thus entering once more upon the office\r\nof governor, occurred the death of his aged mother, at the home of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Colonel Samuel Meredith of Winton, who, in a letter to\r\nthe governor, dated November 22, 1784, speaks tenderly of the long\r\nillness which had preceded the death of the venerable lady, and\r\nespecially of the strength and beauty of her character:--\r\n\r\n     \"She has been in my family upwards of eleven years; and from\r\n     the beginning of that time to the end, her life appeared to\r\n     me most evidently to be a continued manifestation of piety\r\n     and devotion, guided by such a great share of good sense as\r\n     rendered her amiable and agreeable to all who were so happy\r\n     as to be acquainted with her. Never have I known a Christian\r\n     character equal to hers.\"[341]\r\n\r\nOn bringing his family to the capital, in November, 1784, from the\r\nfar-away solitude of Leatherwood, the governor established them, not\r\nwithin the city itself, but across the James River, at a place called\r\nSalisbury. What with children and with grandchildren, his family had\r\nnow become a patriarchal one; and some slight glimpse of himself and\r\nof his manner of life at that time is given us in the memorandum of\r\nSpencer Roane. In deference to \"the ideas attached to the office of\r\ngovernor, as handed down from the royal government,\" he is said to\r\nhave paid careful attention to his costume and personal bearing before\r\nthe public, never going abroad except in black coat, waistcoat, and\r\nknee-breeches, in scarlet cloak, and in dressed wig. Moreover, his\r\nfamily \"were furnished with an excellent coach, at a time when these\r\nvehicles were not so common as at present. They lived as genteelly,\r\nand associated with as polished society, as that of any governor\r\nbefore or since has ever done. He entertained as much company as\r\nothers, and in as genteel a style; and when, at the end of two years,\r\nhe resigned the office, he had greatly exceeded the salary, and [was]\r\nin debt, which was one cause that induced him to resume the practice\r\nof the law.\"[342]\r\n\r\nDuring his two years in the governorship, his duties concerned matters\r\nof much local importance, indeed, but of no particular interest at\r\npresent. To this remark one exception may be found in some passages of\r\nfriendly correspondence between the governor and Washington,--the\r\nlatter then enjoying the long-coveted repose of Mt. Vernon. In\r\nJanuary, 1785, the Assembly of Virginia vested in Washington certain\r\nshares in two companies, just then formed, for opening and extending\r\nthe navigation of the James and Potomac rivers.[343] In response to\r\nGovernor Henry's letter communicating this act, Washington wrote on\r\nthe 27th of February, stating his doubts about accepting such a\r\ngratuity, but at the same time asking the governor as a friend to\r\nassist him in the matter by his advice. Governor Henry's reply is of\r\ninterest to us, not only for its allusion to his own domestic\r\nanxieties at the time, but for its revelation of the frank and cordial\r\nrelations between the two men:--\r\n\r\n                                       RICHMOND, March 12th, 1785.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--The honor you are pleased to do me, in your favor\r\n     of the 27th ultimo, in which you desire my opinion in a\r\n     friendly way concerning the act enclosed you lately, is very\r\n     flattering to me. I did not receive the letter till\r\n     Thursday, and since that my family has been very sickly. My\r\n     oldest grandson, a fine boy indeed, about nine years old,\r\n     lays at the point of death. Under this state of uneasiness\r\n     and perturbation, I feel some unfitness to consider a\r\n     subject of so delicate a nature as that you have desired my\r\n     thoughts on. Besides, I have some expectation of a\r\n     conveyance more proper, it may be, than the present, when I\r\n     would wish to send you some packets received from Ireland,\r\n     which I fear the post cannot carry at once. If he does not\r\n     take them free, I shan't send them, for they are heavy.\r\n     Captain Boyle, who had them from Sir Edward Newenham, wishes\r\n     for the honor of a line from you, which I have promised to\r\n     forward to him.\r\n\r\n     I will give you the trouble of hearing from me next post,\r\n     if no opportunity presents sooner, and, in the mean time, I\r\n     beg you to be persuaded that, with the most sincere\r\n     attachment, I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                  P. HENRY.[344]\r\n\r\n     GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe promise contained in this letter was fulfilled on the 19th of the\r\nsame month, when the governor wrote to Washington a long and careful\r\nstatement of the whole case, urging him to accept the shares, and\r\nclosing his letter with an assurance of his \"unalterable affection\"\r\nand \"most sincere attachment,\"[345]--a subscription not common among\r\npublic men at that time.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, 1786, having declined to be put in nomination\r\nfor a third year, as permitted by the Constitution, he finally retired\r\nfrom the office of governor. The House of Delegates, about the same\r\ntime, by unanimous vote, crowned him with the public thanks, \"for his\r\nwise, prudent, and upright administration, during his last appointment\r\nof chief magistrate of this Commonwealth; assuring him that they\r\nretain a perfect sense of his abilities in the discharge of the duties\r\nof that high and important office, and wish him all domestic happiness\r\non his return to private life.\"[346]\r\n\r\nThis return to private life meant, among other things, his return,\r\nafter an interruption of more than twelve years, to the practice of\r\nthe law. For this purpose he deemed it best to give up his remote home\r\nat Leatherwood, and to establish himself in Prince Edward County,--a\r\nplace about midway between his former residence and the capital, and\r\nmuch better suited to his convenience, as an active practitioner in\r\nthe courts. Accordingly, in Prince Edward County he continued to\r\nreside from the latter part of 1786 until 1795. Furthermore, by that\r\ncounty he was soon elected as one of its delegates in the Assembly;\r\nand, resuming there his old position as leader, he continued to serve\r\nin every session until the end of 1790, at which time he finally\r\nwithdrew from all official connection with public life. Thus it\r\nhappened that, by his retirement from the governorship in 1786, and by\r\nhis almost immediate restoration to the House of Delegates, he was put\r\ninto a situation to act most aggressively and most powerfully on\r\npublic opinion in Virginia during the whole period of the struggle\r\nover the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nAs regards his attitude toward that great business, we need, first of\r\nall, to clear away some obscurity which has gathered about the\r\nquestion of his habitual views respecting the relations of the several\r\nStates to the general government. It has been common to suppose that,\r\neven prior to the movement for the new Constitution, Patrick Henry had\r\nalways been an extreme advocate of the rights of the States as\r\nopposed to the central authority of the Union; and that the tremendous\r\nresistance which he made to the new Constitution in all stages of the\r\naffair prior to the adoption of the first group of amendments is to be\r\naccounted for as the effect of an original and habitual tendency of\r\nhis mind.[347] Such, however, seems not to have been the case.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that, at the very outset of the Revolution,\r\nPatrick Henry was one of the first of our statesmen to recognize the\r\nexistence and the imperial character of a certain cohesive central\r\nauthority, arising from the very nature of the revolutionary act which\r\nthe several colonies were then taking. As early as 1774, in the first\r\nContinental Congress, it was he who exclaimed: \"All distinctions are\r\nthrown down. All America is thrown into one mass.\" \"The distinctions\r\nbetween Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders\r\nare no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.\" In the spring of\r\n1776, at the approach of the question of independence, it was he who\r\neven incurred reproach by his anxiety to defer independence until\r\nafter the basis for a general government should have been established,\r\nlest the several States, in separating from England, should lapse into\r\na separation from one another also. As governor of Virginia from 1776\r\nto 1779, his official correspondence with the president of Congress,\r\nwith the board of war, and with the general of the army is pervaded\r\nby proofs of his respect for the supreme authority of the general\r\ngovernment within its proper sphere. Finally, as a leader in the\r\nVirginia House of Delegates from 1780 to 1784, he was in the main a\r\nsupporter of the policy of giving more strength and dignity to the\r\ngeneral government. During all that period, according to the admission\r\nof his most unfriendly modern critic, Patrick Henry showed himself\r\n\"much more disposed to sustain and strengthen the federal authority\"\r\nthan did, for example, his great rival in the House, Richard Henry\r\nLee; and for the time those two great men became \"the living and\r\nactive exponents of two adverse political systems in both state and\r\nnational questions.\"[348] In 1784, by which time the weakness of the\r\ngeneral government had become alarming, Patrick Henry was among the\r\nforemost in Virginia to express alarm, and to propose the only\r\nappropriate remedy. For example, on the assembling of the legislature,\r\nin May of that year, he took pains to seek an early interview with two\r\nof his prominent associates in the House of Delegates, Madison and\r\nJones, for the express purpose of devising with them some method of\r\ngiving greater strength to the Confederation. \"I find him,\" wrote\r\nMadison to Jefferson immediately after the interview, \"strenuous for\r\ninvigorating the federal government, though without any precise\r\nplan.\"[349] A more detailed account of the same interview was sent to\r\nJefferson by another correspondent. According to the latter, Patrick\r\nHenry then declared that \"he saw ruin inevitable, unless something was\r\ndone to give Congress a compulsory process on delinquent States;\" that\r\n\"a bold example set by Virginia\" in that direction \"would have\r\ninfluence on the other States;\" and that \"this conviction was his only\r\ninducement for coming into the present Assembly.\" Whereupon, it was\r\nthen agreed between them that \"Jones and Madison should sketch some\r\nplan for giving greater power to the federal government; and Henry\r\npromised to sustain it on the floor.\"[350] Finally, such was the\r\nimpression produced by Patrick Henry's political conduct during all\r\nthose years that, as late as in December, 1786, Madison could speak of\r\nhim as having \"been hitherto the champion of the federal cause.\"[351]\r\n\r\nNot far, however, from the date last mentioned Patrick Henry ceased to\r\nbe \"the champion of the federal cause,\" and became its chief\r\nantagonist, and so remained until some time during Washington's first\r\nterm in the presidency. What brought about this sudden and total\r\nrevolution? It can be explained only by the discovery of some new\r\ninfluence which came into his life between 1784 and 1786, and which\r\nwas powerful enough to reverse entirely the habitual direction of his\r\npolitical thought and conduct. Just what that influence was can now\r\nbe easily shown.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of August, 1786, John Jay, as secretary for foreign affairs,\r\npresented to Congress some results of his negotiations with the\r\nSpanish envoy, Gardoqui, respecting a treaty with Spain; and he then\r\nurged that Congress, in view of certain vast advantages to our foreign\r\ncommerce, should consent to surrender the navigation of the\r\nMississippi for twenty-five or thirty years,[352]--a proposal which,\r\nvery naturally, seemed to the six Southern States as nothing less than\r\na cool invitation to them to sacrifice their own most important\r\ninterests for the next quarter of a century, in order to build up\r\nduring that period the interests of the seven States of the North. The\r\nrevelation of this project, and of the ability of the Northern States\r\nto force it through, sent a shock of alarm and of distrust into every\r\nSouthern community. Moreover, full details of these transactions in\r\nCongress were promptly conveyed to Governor Henry by James Monroe, who\r\nadded this pungent item,--that a secret project was then under the\r\nserious consideration of \"committees\" of Northern men, for a\r\ndismemberment of the Union, and for setting the Southern States\r\nadrift, after having thus bartered away from them the use of the\r\nMississippi.[353]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Monroe was writing from New York that letter to\r\nGovernor Henry, Madison was writing from Philadelphia a letter to\r\nJefferson. Having mentioned a plan for strengthening the\r\nConfederation, Madison says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Though my wishes are in favor of such an event, yet I\r\n     despair so much of its accomplishment at the present crisis,\r\n     that I do not extend my views beyond a commercial reform. To\r\n     speak the truth, I almost despair even of this. You will\r\n     find the cause in a measure now before Congress, ... a\r\n     proposed treaty with Spain, one article of which shuts the\r\n     Mississippi for twenty or thirty years. Passing by the other\r\n     Southern States, figure to yourself the effect of such a\r\n     stipulation on the Assembly of Virginia, already jealous of\r\n     Northern politics, and which will be composed of thirty\r\n     members from the Western waters,--of a majority of others\r\n     attached to the Western country from interests of their own,\r\n     of their friends, or their constituents.... Figure to\r\n     yourself its effect on the people at large on the Western\r\n     waters, who are impatiently waiting for a favorable result\r\n     to the negotiation with Gardoqui, and who will consider\r\n     themselves sold by their Atlantic brethren. Will it be an\r\n     unnatural consequence if they consider themselves absolved\r\n     from every federal tie, and court some protection for their\r\n     betrayed rights?\"[354]\r\n\r\nHow truly Madison predicted the fatal construction which in the South,\r\nand particularly in Virginia, would be put upon the proposed surrender\r\nof the Mississippi, may be seen by a glance at some of the resolutions\r\nwhich passed the Virginia House of Delegates on the 29th of the\r\nfollowing November:--\r\n\r\n     \"That the common right of navigating the river Mississippi,\r\n     and of communicating with other nations through that\r\n     channel, ought to be considered as the bountiful gift of\r\n     nature to the United States, as proprietors of the\r\n     territories watered by the said river and its eastern\r\n     branches, and as moreover secured to them by the late\r\n     revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"That the Confederacy, having been formed on the broad basis\r\n     of equal rights, in every part thereof, to the protection\r\n     and guardianship of the whole, a sacrifice of the rights of\r\n     any one part, to the supposed or real interest of another\r\n     part, would be a flagrant violation of justice, a direct\r\n     contravention of the end for which the federal government\r\n     was instituted, and an alarming innovation in the system of\r\n     the Union.\"[355]\r\n\r\nOne day after the passage of those resolutions, Patrick Henry ceased\r\nto be the governor of Virginia; and five days afterward he was chosen\r\nby Virginia as one of its seven delegates to a convention to be held\r\nat Philadelphia in the following May for the purpose of revising the\r\nfederal Constitution. But amid the widespread excitement, amid the\r\nanger and the suspicion then prevailing as to the liability of the\r\nSouthern States, even under a weak confederation, to be slaughtered,\r\nin all their most important concerns, by the superior weight and\r\nnumber of the Northern States, it is easy to see how little inclined\r\nmany Southern statesmen would be to increase that liability by making\r\nthis weak confederation a strong one. In the list of such Southern\r\nstatesmen Patrick Henry must henceforth be reckoned; and, as it was\r\nnever his nature to do anything tepidly or by halves, his hostility\r\nto the project for strengthening the Confederation soon became as hot\r\nas it was comprehensive. On the 7th of December, only three days after\r\nhe was chosen as a delegate to the Philadelphia convention, Madison,\r\nthen at Richmond, wrote concerning him thus anxiously to Washington:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am entirely convinced from what I observe here, that\r\n     unless the project of Congress can be reversed, the hopes of\r\n     carrying this State into a proper federal system will be\r\n     demolished. Many of our most federal leading men are\r\n     extremely soured with what has already passed. Mr. Henry,\r\n     who has been hitherto the champion of the federal cause, has\r\n     become a cold advocate, and, in the event of an actual\r\n     sacrifice of the Mississippi by Congress, will\r\n     unquestionably go over to the opposite side.\"[356]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this change in his attitude toward the federal cause,\r\nperhaps he would still go to the great convention. On that subject he\r\nappears to have kept his own counsel for several weeks; but by the 1st\r\nof March, 1787, Edmund Randolph, at Richmond, was able to send this\r\nword to Madison, who was back in his place in Congress: \"Mr. Henry\r\nperemptorily refuses to go;\" and Randolph mentions as Henry's reasons\r\nfor this refusal, not only his urgent professional duties, but his\r\nrepugnance to the proceedings of Congress in the matter of the\r\nMississippi.[357] Five days later, from the same city, John Marshall\r\nwrote to Arthur Lee: \"Mr. Henry, whose opinions have their usual\r\ninfluence, has been heard to say that he would rather part with the\r\nConfederation than relinquish the navigation of the Mississippi.\"[358]\r\nOn the 18th of the same month, in a letter to Washington, Madison\r\npoured out his solicitude respecting the course which Henry was going\r\nto take: \"I hear from Richmond, with much concern, that Mr. Henry has\r\npositively declined his mission to Philadelphia. Besides the loss of\r\nhis services on that theatre, there is danger, I fear, that this step\r\nhas proceeded from a wish to leave his conduct unfettered on another\r\ntheatre, where the result of the convention will receive its destiny\r\nfrom his omnipotence.\"[359] On the next day, Madison sent off to\r\nJefferson, who was then in Paris, an account of the situation: \"But\r\nalthough it appears that the intended sacrifice of the Mississippi\r\nwill not be made, the consequences of the intention and the attempt\r\nare likely to be very serious. I have already made known to you the\r\nlight in which the subject was taken up by Virginia. Mr. Henry's\r\ndisgust exceeds all measure, and I am not singular in ascribing his\r\nrefusal to attend the convention, to the policy of keeping himself\r\nfree to combat or espouse the result of it according to the result of\r\nthe Mississippi business, among other circumstances.\"[360]\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 25th of March Madison wrote to Randolph, evidently in\r\nreply to the information given by the latter on the 1st of the month:\r\n\"The refusal of Mr. Henry to join in the task of revising the\r\nConfederation is ominous; and the more so, I fear, if he means to be\r\ngoverned by the event which you conjecture.\"[361]\r\n\r\nThat Patrick Henry did not attend the great convention, everybody\r\nknows; but the whole meaning of his refusal to do so, everybody may\r\nnow understand somewhat more clearly, perhaps, than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[341] MS.\r\n\r\n[342] MS.\r\n\r\n[343] Hening, xi. 525-526.\r\n\r\n[344] MS.\r\n\r\n[345] Sparks, _Corr.

Vernon, and, in his great\r\nanxiety to win over to the new Constitution the support of his old\r\nfriend Patrick Henry, he immediately dispatched to him a copy of that\r\ninstrument, accompanied by a very impressive and conciliatory\r\nletter,[362] to which, about three weeks afterwards, was returned the\r\nfollowing reply:--\r\n\r\n                                      RICHMOND, October 19, 1787.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--I was honored by the receipt of your favor,\r\n     together with a copy of the proposed federal Constitution, a\r\n     few days ago, for which I beg you to accept my thanks. They\r\n     are also due to you from me as a citizen, on account of the\r\n     great fatigue necessarily attending the arduous business of\r\n     the late convention.\r\n\r\n     I have to lament that I cannot bring my mind to accord with\r\n     the proposed Constitution. The concern I feel on this\r\n     account is really greater than I am able to express. Perhaps\r\n     mature reflections may furnish me with reasons to change my\r\n     present sentiments into a conformity with the opinions of\r\n     those personages for whom I have the highest reverence. Be\r\n     that as it may, I beg you will be persuaded of the\r\n     unalterable regard and attachment with which I shall be,\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir, your obliged and very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   P. HENRY.[363]\r\n\r\nFour days before the date of this letter the legislature of Virginia\r\nhad convened at Richmond for its autumn session, and Patrick Henry had\r\nthere taken his usual place on the most important committees, and as\r\nthe virtual director of the thought and work of the House. Much\r\nsolicitude was felt concerning the course which he might advise the\r\nlegislature to adopt on the supreme question then before the\r\ncountry,--some persons even fearing that he might try to defeat the\r\nnew Constitution in Virginia by simply preventing the call of a state\r\nconvention. Great was Washington's satisfaction on receiving from one\r\nof his correspondents in the Assembly, shortly after the session\r\nbegan, this cheerful report:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have not met with one in all my inquiries (and I have\r\n     made them with great diligence) opposed to it, except Mr.\r\n     Henry, who I have heard is so, but could only conjecture it\r\n     from a conversation with him on the subject.... The\r\n     transmissory note of Congress was before us to-day, when\r\n     Mr. Henry declared that it transcended our powers to decide\r\n     on the Constitution, and that it must go before a\r\n     convention. As it was insinuated he would aim at preventing\r\n     this, much pleasure was discovered at the declaration.\"[364]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October, from his place in Congress, Madison sent over\r\nto Jefferson, in Paris, a full account of the results of the\r\nPhiladelphia convention, and of the public feeling with reference to\r\nits work: \"My information from Virginia is as yet extremely\r\nimperfect.... The part which Mr. Henry will take is unknown here. Much\r\nwill depend on it. I had taken it for granted, from a variety of\r\ncircumstances, that he would be in the opposition, and still think\r\nthat will be the case. There are reports, however, which favor a\r\ncontrary supposition.\"[365] But, by the 9th of December, Madison was\r\nable to send to Jefferson a further report, which indicated that all\r\ndoubt respecting the hostile attitude of Patrick Henry was then\r\nremoved. After mentioning that a majority of the people of Virginia\r\nseemed to be in favor of the Constitution, he added: \"What change may\r\nbe produced by the united influence and exertions of Mr. Henry, Mr.\r\nMason, and the governor, with some pretty able auxiliaries, is\r\nuncertain.... Mr. Henry is the great adversary who will render the\r\nevent precarious. He is, I find, with his usual address, working up\r\nevery possible interest into a spirit of opposition.\"[366]\r\n\r\nLong before the date last mentioned, the legislature had regularly\r\ndeclared for a state convention, to be held at Richmond on the first\r\nMonday in June, 1788, then and there to determine whether or not\r\nVirginia would accept the new Constitution. In view of that event,\r\ndelegates were in the mean time to be chosen by the people; and thus,\r\nfor the intervening months, the fight was to be transferred to the\r\narena of popular debate. In such a contest Patrick Henry, being once\r\naroused, was not likely to take a languid or a hesitating part; and of\r\nthe importance then attached to the part which he did take, we catch\r\nfrequent glimpses in the correspondence of the period. Thus, on the\r\n19th of February, 1788, Madison, still at New York, sent this word to\r\nJefferson: \"The temper of Virginia, as far as I can learn, has\r\nundergone but little change of late. At first, there was an enthusiasm\r\nfor the Constitution. The tide next took a sudden and strong turn in\r\nthe opposite direction. The influence and exertions of Mr. Henry,\r\nColonel Mason, and some others, will account for this.... I am told\r\nthat a very bold language is held by Mr. Henry and some of his\r\npartisans.\"[367] On the 10th of April, Madison, then returned to his\r\nhome in Virginia, wrote to Edmund Randolph: \"The declaration of Henry,\r\nmentioned in your letter, is a proof to me that desperate measures\r\nwill be his game.\"[368] On the 22d of the same month Madison wrote to\r\nJefferson: \"The adversaries take very different grounds of opposition.\r\nSome are opposed to the substance of the plan; others, to particular\r\nmodifications only. Mr. Henry is supposed to aim at disunion.\"[369] On\r\nthe 24th of April, Edward Carrington, writing from New York, told\r\nJefferson: \"Mr. H. does not openly declare for a dismemberment of the\r\nUnion, but his arguments in support of his opposition to the\r\nConstitution go directly to that issue. He says that three\r\nconfederacies would be practicable, and better suited to the good of\r\ncommerce than one.\"[370] On the 28th of April, Washington wrote to\r\nLafayette on account of the struggle then going forward; and after\r\nnaming some of the leading champions of the Constitution, he adds\r\nsorrowfully: \"Henry and Mason are its great adversaries.\"[371]\r\nFinally, as late as on the 12th of June, the Rev. John Blair Smith, at\r\nthat time president of Hampden-Sidney College, conveyed to Madison, an\r\nold college friend, his own deep disapproval of the course which had\r\nbeen pursued by Patrick Henry in the management of the canvass against\r\nthe Constitution:--\r\n\r\n     \"Before the Constitution appeared, the minds of the people\r\n     were artfully prepared against it; so that all opposition\r\n     [to Mr. Henry] at the election of delegates to consider it,\r\n     was in vain. That gentleman has descended to lower artifices\r\n     and management on the occasion than I thought him capable\r\n     of.... If Mr. Innes has shown you a speech of Mr. Henry to\r\n     his constituents, which I sent him, you will see something\r\n     of the method he has taken to diffuse his poison.... It\r\n     grieves me to see such great natural talents abused to such\r\n     purposes.\"[372]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 2d of June, 1788, the long-expected convention\r\nassembled at Richmond. So great was the public interest in the event\r\nthat a full delegation was present, even on the first day; and in\r\norder to make room for the throngs of citizens from all parts of\r\nVirginia and from other States, who had flocked thither to witness the\r\nimpending battle, it was decided that the convention should hold its\r\nmeetings in the New Academy, on Shockoe Hill, the largest\r\nassembly-room in the city.\r\n\r\nEight States had already adopted the Constitution. The five States\r\nwhich had yet to act upon the question were New Hampshire, Rhode\r\nIsland, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia. For every reason, the\r\ncourse then to be taken by Virginia would have great consequences.\r\nMoreover, since the days of the struggle over independence, no\r\nquestion had so profoundly moved the people of Virginia; none had\r\naroused such hopes and such fears; none had so absorbed the thoughts,\r\nor so embittered the relations of men. It is not strange, therefore,\r\nthat this convention, consisting of one hundred and seventy members,\r\nshould have been thought to represent, to an unusual degree, the\r\nintelligence, the character, the experience, the reputation of the\r\nState. Perhaps it would be true to say that, excepting Washington,\r\nJefferson, and Richard Henry Lee, no Virginian of eminence was absent\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the line of division, which from the outset parted into\r\ntwo hostile sections these one hundred and seventy Virginians, was\r\nsomething quite unparalleled. In other States it had been noted that\r\nthe conservative classes, the men of education and of property, of\r\nhigh office, of high social and professional standing, were nearly all\r\non the side of the new Constitution. Such was not the case in\r\nVirginia. Of the conservative classes throughout that State, quite as\r\nmany were against the new Constitution as were in favor of it. Of the\r\nfour distinguished citizens who had been its governors, since Virginia\r\nhad assumed the right to elect governors,--Patrick Henry, Jefferson,\r\nNelson, and Harrison,--each in turn had denounced the measure as\r\nunsatisfactory and dangerous; while Edmund Randolph, the governor then\r\nin office, having attended the great convention at Philadelphia, and\r\nhaving there refused to sign the Constitution, had published an\r\nimpressive statement of his objections to it, and, for several months\r\nthereafter, had been counted among its most formidable opponents.\r\nConcerning the attitude of the legal profession,--a profession always\r\ninclined to conservatism,--Madison had written to Jefferson: \"The\r\ngeneral and admiralty courts, with most of the bar, oppose the\r\nConstitution.\"[373] Finally, among Virginians who were at that time\r\nparticularly honored and trusted for patriotic services during the\r\nRevolution, such men as these, Theodoric Bland, William Grayson, John\r\nTyler, Meriwether Smith, James Monroe, George Mason, and Richard Henry\r\nLee, had declared their disapproval of the document.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, within the convention itself, at the opening of the\r\nsession, it was claimed by the friends of the new government that they\r\nthen outnumbered their opponents by at least fifty votes.[374] Their\r\ngreat champion in debate was James Madison, who was powerfully\r\nassisted, first or last, by Edmund Pendleton, John Marshall, George\r\nNicholas, Francis Corbin, George Wythe, James Innes, General Henry\r\nLee, and especially by that same Governor Randolph who, after\r\ndenouncing the Constitution for \"features so odious\" that he could not\r\n\"agree to it,\"[375] had finally swung completely around to its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAgainst all this array of genius, learning, character, logical acumen,\r\nand eloquence, Patrick Henry held the field as protagonist for\r\ntwenty-three days,--his chief lieutenants in the fight being Mason,\r\nGrayson, and John Dawson, with occasional help from Harrison, Monroe,\r\nand Tyler. Upon him alone fell the brunt of the battle. Out of the\r\ntwenty-three days of that splendid tourney, there were but five days\r\nin which he did not take the floor. On each of several days he made\r\nthree speeches; on one day he made five speeches; on another day\r\neight. In one speech alone, he was on his legs for seven hours. The\r\nwords of all who had any share in that debate were taken down,\r\naccording to the imperfect art of the time, by the stenographer, David\r\nRobertson, whose reports, however, are said to be little more than a\r\npretty full outline of the speeches actually made: but in the volume\r\nwhich contains these abstracts, one of Patrick Henry's speeches fills\r\neight pages, another ten pages, another sixteen, another twenty-one,\r\nanother forty; while, in the aggregate, his speeches constitute nearly\r\none quarter of the entire book,--a book of six hundred and sixty-three\r\npages.[376]\r\n\r\nAny one who has fallen under the impression, so industriously\r\npropagated by the ingenious enmity of Jefferson's old age, that\r\nPatrick Henry was a man of but meagre information and of extremely\r\nslender intellectual resources, ignorant especially of law, of\r\npolitical science, and of history, totally lacking in logical power\r\nand in precision of statement, with nothing to offset these\r\ndeficiencies excepting a strange gift of overpowering, dithyrambic\r\neloquence, will find it hard, as he turns over the leaves on which are\r\nrecorded the debates of the Virginia convention, to understand just\r\nhow such a person could have made the speeches which are there\r\nattributed to Patrick Henry, or how a mere rhapsodist could have thus\r\nheld his ground, in close hand-to-hand combat, for twenty-three days,\r\nagainst such antagonists, on all the difficult subjects of law,\r\npolitical science, and history involved in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States,--while showing at the same time every quality of good\r\ngeneralship as a tactician and as a party leader. \"There has been, I\r\nam aware,\" says an eminent historian of the Constitution, \"a modern\r\nscepticism concerning Patrick Henry's abilities; but I cannot share\r\nit.... The manner in which he carried on the opposition to the\r\nConstitution in the convention of Virginia, for nearly a whole month,\r\nshows that he possessed other powers besides those of great natural\r\neloquence.\"[377]\r\n\r\nBut, now, what were Patrick Henry's objections to the new\r\nConstitution?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let it be noted that his objections did not spring from\r\nany hostility to the union of the thirteen States, or from any\r\npreference for a separate union of the Southern States. Undoubtedly\r\nthere had been a time, especially under the provocations connected\r\nwith the Mississippi business, when he and many other Southern\r\nstatesmen sincerely thought that there might be no security for their\r\ninterests even under the Confederation, and that this lack of security\r\nwould be even more glaring and disastrous under the new Constitution.\r\nSuch, for example, seems to have been the opinion of Governor Benjamin\r\nHarrison, as late as October the 4th, 1787, on which date he thus\r\nwrote to Washington: \"I cannot divest myself of an opinion that ... if\r\nthe Constitution is carried into effect, the States south of the\r\nPotomac will be little more than appendages to those to the northward\r\nof it.\"[378] It is very probable that this sentence accurately\r\nreflects, likewise, Patrick Henry's mood of thought at that time.\r\nNevertheless, whatever may have been his thought under the sectional\r\nsuspicions and alarms of the preceding months, it is certain that, at\r\nthe date of the Virginia convention, he had come to see that the\r\nthirteen States must, by all means, try to keep together. \"I am\r\npersuaded,\" said he, in reply to Randolph, \"of what the honorable\r\ngentleman says, 'that separate confederacies will ruin us.'\" \"Sir,\" he\r\nexclaimed on another occasion, \"the dissolution of the Union is most\r\nabhorrent to my mind. The first thing I have at heart is American\r\nliberty; the second thing is American union.\" Again he protested: \"I\r\nmean not to breathe the spirit, nor utter the language, of\r\nsecession.\"[379]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, he admitted that there were great defects in the\r\nold Confederation, and that those defects ought to be cured by proper\r\namendments, particularly in the direction of greater strength to the\r\nfederal government. But did the proposed Constitution embody such\r\namendments? On the contrary, that Constitution, instead of properly\r\namending the old Confederation, simply annihilated it, and replaced\r\nit by something radically different and radically dangerous.\r\n\r\n     \"The federal convention ought to have amended the old\r\n     system; for this purpose they were solely delegated; the\r\n     object of their mission extended to no other consideration.\"\r\n     \"The distinction between a national government and a\r\n     confederacy is not sufficiently discerned. Had the delegates\r\n     who were sent to Philadelphia a power to propose a\r\n     consolidated government, instead of a confederacy?\" \"Here is\r\n     a resolution as radical as that which separated us from\r\n     Great Britain. It is radical in this transition; our rights\r\n     and privileges are endangered, and the sovereignty of the\r\n     States will be relinquished: and cannot we plainly see that\r\n     this is actually the case? The rights of conscience, trial\r\n     by jury, liberty of the press, all your immunities and\r\n     franchises, all pretensions to human rights and privileges,\r\n     are rendered insecure, if not lost, by this change, so\r\n     loudly talked of by some, so inconsiderately by others.\" \"A\r\n     number of characters, of the greatest eminence in this\r\n     country, object to this government for its consolidating\r\n     tendency. This is not imaginary. It is a formidable reality.\r\n     If consolidation proves to be as mischievous to this country\r\n     as it has been to other countries, what will the poor\r\n     inhabitants of this country do? This government will operate\r\n     like an ambuscade. It will destroy the state governments,\r\n     and swallow the liberties of the people, without giving\r\n     previous notice. If gentlemen are willing to run the hazard,\r\n     let them run it; but I shall exculpate myself by my\r\n     opposition and monitory warnings within these walls.\"[380]\r\n\r\nBut, in the third place, besides transforming the old confederacy into\r\na centralized and densely consolidated government, and clothing that\r\ngovernment with enormous powers over States and over individuals, what\r\nhad this new Constitution provided for the protection of States and of\r\nindividuals? Almost nothing. It had created a new and a tremendous\r\npower over us; it had failed to cover us with any shield, or to\r\ninterpose any barrier, by which, in case of need, we might save\r\nourselves from the wanton and fatal exercise of that power. In short,\r\nthe new Constitution had no bill of rights. But \"a bill of rights,\" he\r\ndeclared, is \"indispensably necessary.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A general positive provision should be inserted in the new\r\n     system, securing to the States and the people every right\r\n     which was not conceded to the general government.\" \"I trust\r\n     that gentlemen, on this occasion, will see the great objects\r\n     of religion, liberty of the press, trial by jury,\r\n     interdiction of cruel punishments, and every other sacred\r\n     right, secured, before they agree to that paper.\" \"Mr.\r\n     Chairman, the necessity of a bill of rights appears to me to\r\n     be greater in this government than ever it was in any\r\n     government before. I have observed already that the sense of\r\n     European nations, and particularly Great Britain, is against\r\n     the construction of rights being retained which are not\r\n     expressly relinquished. I repeat, that all nations have\r\n     adopted the construction, that all rights not expressly and\r\n     unequivocally reserved to the people are impliedly and\r\n     incidentally relinquished to rulers, as necessarily\r\n     inseparable from delegated powers.... Let us consider the\r\n     sentiments which have been entertained by the people of\r\n     America on this subject. At the Revolution, it must be\r\n     admitted that it was their sense to set down those great\r\n     rights which ought, in all countries, to be held inviolable\r\n     and sacred. Virginia did so, we all remember. She made a\r\n     compact to reserve, expressly, certain rights.... She most\r\n     cautiously and guardedly reserved and secured those\r\n     invaluable, inestimable rights and privileges which no\r\n     people, inspired with the least glow of patriotic liberty,\r\n     ever did, or ever can, abandon. She is called upon now to\r\n     abandon them, and dissolve that compact which secured them\r\n     to her.... Will she do it? This is the question. If you\r\n     intend to reserve your unalienable rights, you must have the\r\n     most express stipulation; for, if implication be allowed,\r\n     you are ousted of those rights. If the people do not think\r\n     it necessary to reserve them, they will be supposed to be\r\n     given up.... If you give up these powers, without a bill of\r\n     rights, you will exhibit the most absurd thing to mankind\r\n     that ever the world saw,--a government that has abandoned\r\n     all its powers,--the powers of direct taxation, the sword,\r\n     and the purse. You have disposed of them to Congress,\r\n     without a bill of rights, without check, limitation, or\r\n     control. And still you have checks and guards; still you\r\n     keep barriers--pointed where? Pointed against your weakened,\r\n     prostrated, enervated, state government! You have a bill of\r\n     rights to defend you against the state government--which is\r\n     bereaved of all power, and yet you have none against\r\n     Congress--though in full and exclusive possession of all\r\n     power. You arm yourselves against the weak and defenceless,\r\n     and expose yourselves naked to the armed and powerful. Is\r\n     not this a conduct of unexampled absurdity?\"[381]\r\n\r\nAgain and again, in response to his demand for an express assertion,\r\nin the instrument itself, of the rights of individuals and of States,\r\nhe was told that every one of those rights was secured, since it was\r\nnaturally and fairly implied. \"Even say,\" he rejoined, \"it is a\r\nnatural implication,--why not give us a right ... in express terms, in\r\nlanguage that could not admit of evasions or subterfuges? If they can\r\nuse implication for us, they can also use implication against us. We\r\nare giving power; they are getting power; judge, then, on which side\r\nthe implication will be used.\" \"Implication is dangerous, because it\r\nis unbounded; if it be admitted at all, and no limits prescribed, it\r\nadmits of the utmost extension.\" \"The existence of powers is\r\nsufficiently established. If we trust our dearest rights to\r\nimplication, we shall be in a very unhappy situation.\"[382]\r\n\r\nThen, in addition to his objections to the general character of the\r\nConstitution, namely, as a consolidated government, unrestrained by an\r\nexpress guarantee of rights, he applied his criticisms in great\r\ndetail, and with merciless rigor, to each department of the proposed\r\ngovernment,--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial; and\r\nwith respect to each one of these he insisted that its intended\r\nfunctions were such as to inspire distrust and alarm. Of course, we\r\ncannot here follow this fierce critic of the Constitution into all the\r\ndetail of his criticisms; but, as a single example, we may cite a\r\nportion of his assault upon the executive department,--an assault, as\r\nwill be seen, far better suited to the political apprehensions of his\r\nown time than of ours:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Constitution is said to have beautiful features; but\r\n     when I come to examine these features, sir, they appear to\r\n     me horribly frightful. Among other deformities, it has an\r\n     awful squinting; it squints towards monarchy. And does not\r\n     this raise indignation in the breast of every true American?\r\n     Your president may easily become king.... Where are your\r\n     checks in this government? Your strongholds will be in the\r\n     hands of your enemies. It is on a supposition that your\r\n     American governors shall be honest, that all the good\r\n     qualities of this government are founded; but its defective\r\n     and imperfect construction puts it in their power to\r\n     perpetrate the worst of mischiefs, should they be bad men.\r\n     And, sir, would not all the world, from the eastern to the\r\n     western hemispheres, blame our distracted folly in resting\r\n     our rights upon the contingency of our rulers being good or\r\n     bad? Show me that age and country where the rights and\r\n     liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of\r\n     their rulers being good men, without a consequent loss of\r\n     liberty.... If your American chief be a man of ambition and\r\n     abilities, how easy is it for him to render himself\r\n     absolute! The army is in his hands; and if he be a man of\r\n     address, it will be attached to him, and it will be the\r\n     subject of long meditation with him to seize the first\r\n     auspicious moment to accomplish his design. And, sir, will\r\n     the American spirit solely relieve you when this happens? I\r\n     would rather infinitely--and I am sure most of this\r\n     convention are of the same opinion--have a king, lords, and\r\n     commons, than a government so replete with such\r\n     insupportable evils. If we make a king, we may prescribe the\r\n     rules by which he shall rule his people, and interpose such\r\n     checks as shall prevent him from infringing them; but the\r\n     president, in the field, at the head of his army, can\r\n     prescribe the terms on which he shall reign master, so far\r\n     that it will puzzle any American ever to get his neck from\r\n     under the galling yoke.... Will not the recollection of his\r\n     crimes teach him to make one bold push for the American\r\n     throne? Will not the immense difference between being master\r\n     of everything, and being ignominiously tried and punished,\r\n     powerfully excite him to make this bold push? But, sir,\r\n     where is the existing force to punish him? Can he not, at\r\n     the head of his army, beat down every opposition? Away with\r\n     your president! we shall have a king. The army will salute\r\n     him monarch. Your militia will leave you, and assist in\r\n     making him king, and fight against you. And what have you to\r\n     oppose this force? What will then become of you and your\r\n     rights? Will not absolute despotism ensue?\"[383]\r\n\r\nWithout reproducing here, in further detail, Patrick Henry's\r\nobjections to the new Constitution, it may now be stated that they all\r\nsprang from a single idea, and all revolved about that idea, namely,\r\nthat the new plan of government, as it then stood, seriously\r\nendangered the rights and liberties of the people of the several\r\nStates. And in holding this opinion he was not at all peculiar. Very\r\nmany of the ablest and noblest statesmen of the time shared it with\r\nhim. Not to name again his chief associates in Virginia, nor to cite\r\nthe language of such men as Burke and Rawlins Lowndes, of South\r\nCarolina; as Timothy Bloodworth, of North Carolina; as Samuel Chase\r\nand Luther Martin, of Maryland; as George Clinton, of New York; as\r\nSamuel Adams, John Hancock, and Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts; as\r\nJoshua Atherton, of New Hampshire, it may sufficiently put us into the\r\ntone of contemporary opinion upon the subject, to recall certain grave\r\nwords of Jefferson, who, watching the whole scene from the calm\r\ndistance of Paris, thus wrote on the 2d of February, 1788, to an\r\nAmerican friend:--\r\n\r\n     \"I own it astonishes me to find such a change wrought in the\r\n     opinions of our countrymen since I left them, as that three\r\n     fourths of them should be contented to live under a system\r\n     which leaves to their governors the power of taking from\r\n     them the trial by jury in civil cases, freedom of religion,\r\n     freedom of the press, freedom of commerce, the habeas corpus\r\n     laws, and of yoking them with a standing army. That is a\r\n     degeneracy in the principles of liberty, to which I had\r\n     given four centuries, instead of four years.\"[384]\r\n\r\nHolding such objections to the proposed Constitution, what were\r\nPatrick Henry and his associates in the Virginia convention to do?\r\nWere they to reject the measure outright? Admitting that it had some\r\ngood features, they yet thought that the best course to be taken by\r\nVirginia would be to remit the whole subject to a new convention of\r\nthe States,--a convention which, being summoned after a year or more\r\nof intense and universal discussion, would thus represent the later,\r\nthe more definite, and the more enlightened desires of the American\r\npeople. But despairing of this, Patrick Henry and his friends\r\nconcentrated all their forces upon this single and clear line of\r\npolicy: so to press their objections to the Constitution as to induce\r\nthe convention, not to reject it, but to postpone its adoption until\r\nthey could refer to the other States in the American confederacy the\r\nfollowing momentous proposition, namely, \"a declaration of rights,\r\nasserting, and securing from encroachment, the great principles of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, and the undeniable rights of the people,\r\ntogether with amendments to the most exceptionable parts of the said\r\nconstitution of government.\"[385]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the real question over which in that assemblage, from\r\nthe first day to the last, the battle raged. The result of the battle\r\nwas reached on Wednesday, the 25th of June; and that result was a\r\nvictory for immediate adoption, but by a majority of only ten votes,\r\ninstead of the fifty votes that were claimed for it at the beginning\r\nof the session. Moreover, even that small majority for immediate\r\nadoption was obtained only by the help, first, of a preamble solemnly\r\naffirming it to be the understanding of Virginia in this act that it\r\nretained every power not expressly granted to the general government;\r\nand, secondly, of a subsidiary resolution promising to recommend to\r\nCongress \"whatsoever amendments may be deemed necessary.\"\r\n\r\nJust before the decisive question was put, Patrick Henry, knowing that\r\nthe result would be against him, and knowing, also, from the angry\r\nthings uttered within that House and outside of it, that much\r\nsolicitude was abroad respecting the course likely to be taken by the\r\ndefeated party, then and there spoke these noble words:--\r\n\r\n     \"I beg pardon of this House for having taken up more time\r\n     than came to my share, and I thank them for the patience and\r\n     polite attention with which I have been heard. If I shall be\r\n     in the minority, I shall have those painful sensations which\r\n     arise from a conviction of being overpowered in a good\r\n     cause. Yet I will be a peaceable citizen. My head, my hand,\r\n     and my heart shall be at liberty to retrieve the loss of\r\n     liberty, and remove the defects of that system in a\r\n     constitutional way. I wish not to go to violence, but will\r\n     wait, with hopes that the spirit which predominated in the\r\n     Revolution is not yet gone, nor the cause of those who are\r\n     attached to the Revolution yet lost. I shall therefore\r\n     patiently wait in expectation of seeing that government\r\n     changed, so as to be compatible with the safety, liberty,\r\n     and happiness of the people.\"[386]\r\n\r\nThose words of the great Virginian leader proved to be a message of\r\nreassurance to many an anxious citizen, in many a State,--not least\r\nso to that great citizen who, from the slopes of Mount Vernon, was\r\nthen watching, night and day, for signs of some abatement in the storm\r\nof civil discord. Those words, too, have, in our time, won for the\r\norator who spoke them the deliberate, and the almost lyrical, applause\r\nof the greatest historian who has yet laid hand on the story of the\r\nConstitution: \"Henry showed his genial nature, free from all\r\nmalignity. He was like a billow of the ocean on the first bright day\r\nafter the storm, dashing itself against the rocky cliff, and then,\r\nsparkling with light, retreating to its home.\"[387]\r\n\r\nLong after the practical effects of the Virginia convention of 1788\r\nhad been merged in the general political life of the country, that\r\nconvention was still proudly remembered for the magnificent exertions\r\nof intellectual power, and particularly of eloquence, which it had\r\ncalled forth. So lately as the year 1857, there was still living a man\r\nwho, in his youth, had often looked in upon that famous convention,\r\nand whose enthusiasm, in recalling its great scenes, was not to be\r\nchilled even by the frosts of his ninety winters:--\r\n\r\n     \"The impressions made by the powerful arguments of Madison\r\n     and the overwhelming eloquence of Henry can never fade from\r\n     my mind. I thought them almost supernatural. They seemed\r\n     raised up by Providence, each in his way, to produce great\r\n     results: the one by his grave, dignified, and irresistible\r\n     arguments to convince and enlighten mankind; the other, by\r\n     his brilliant and enrapturing eloquence to lead\r\n     whithersoever he would.\"[388]\r\n\r\nThose who had heard Patrick Henry on the other great occasions of his\r\ncareer were ready to say that his eloquence in the convention of 1788\r\nwas, upon the whole, fully equal to anything ever exhibited by him in\r\nany other place. The official reports of his speeches in that\r\nassemblage were always declared to be inferior in \"strength and\r\nbeauty\" to those actually made by him there.[389] \"In forming an\r\nestimate of his eloquence,\" says one gentleman who there heard him,\r\n\"no reliance can be placed on the printed speeches. No reporter\r\nwhatever could take down what he actually said; and if he could, it\r\nwould fall far short of the original.\"[390]\r\n\r\nIn his arguments against the Constitution Patrick Henry confined\r\nhimself to no systematic order. The convention had indeed resolved\r\nthat the document should be discussed, clause by clause, in a regular\r\nmanner; but in spite of the complaints and reproaches of his\r\nantagonists, he continually broke over all barriers, and delivered his\r\n\"multiform and protean attacks\" in such order as suited the workings\r\nof his own mind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that long and eager controversy, he had several\r\npassages of sharp personal collision with his opponents, particularly\r\nwith Governor Randolph, whose vacillating course respecting the\r\nConstitution had left him exposed to the most galling comments, and\r\nwho on one occasion, in his anguish, turned upon Patrick Henry with\r\nthe exclamation: \"I find myself attacked in the most illiberal manner\r\nby the honorable gentleman. I disdain his aspersions and his\r\ninsinuations. His asperity is warranted by no principle of\r\nparliamentary decency, nor compatible with the least shadow of\r\nfriendship; and if our friendship must fall, let it fall, like\r\nLucifer, never to rise again.\"[391] Like all very eloquent men, he was\r\ntaunted, of course, for having more eloquence than logic; for \"his\r\ndeclamatory talents;\" for his \"vague discourses and mere sports of\r\nfancy;\" for discarding \"solid argument;\" and for \"throwing those\r\nbolts\" which he had \"so peculiar a dexterity at discharging.\"[392] On\r\none occasion, old General Adam Stephen tried to burlesque the orator's\r\nmanner of speech;[393] on another occasion, that same petulant warrior\r\nbluntly told Patrick that if he did \"not like this government,\" he\r\nmight \"go and live among the Indians,\" and even offered to facilitate\r\nthe orator's self-expatriation among the savages: \"I know of several\r\nnations that live very happily; and I can furnish him with a\r\nvocabulary of their language.\"[394]\r\n\r\nKnowing, as he did, every passion and prejudice of his audience, he\r\nadopted, it appears, almost every conceivable method of appeal. \"The\r\nvariety of arguments,\" writes one witness, \"which Mr. Henry generally\r\npresented in his speeches, addressed to the capacities, prejudices,\r\nand individual interests of his hearers, made his speeches very\r\nunequal. He rarely made in that convention a speech which Quintilian\r\nwould have approved. If he soared at times, like the eagle, and seemed\r\nlike the bird of Jove to be armed with thunder, he did not disdain to\r\nstoop like the hawk to seize his prey,--but the instant that he had\r\ndone it, rose in pursuit of another quarry.\"[395]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most wonderful example of his eloquence, if we may judge\r\nby contemporary descriptions, was that connected with the famous scene\r\nof the thunder-storm, on Tuesday, the 24th of June, only one day\r\nbefore the decisive vote was taken. The orator, it seems, had gathered\r\nup all his forces for what might prove to be his last appeal against\r\nimmediate adoption, and was portraying the disasters which the new\r\nsystem of government, unless amended, was to bring upon his\r\ncountrymen, and upon all mankind: \"I see the awful immensity of the\r\ndangers with which it is pregnant. I see it. I feel it. I see beings\r\nof a higher order anxious concerning our decision. When I see beyond\r\nthe horizon that bounds human eyes, and look at the final consummation\r\nof all human things, and see those intelligent beings which inhabit\r\nthe ethereal mansions reviewing the political decisions and\r\nrevolutions which, in the progress of time, will happen in America,\r\nand the consequent happiness or misery of mankind, I am led to believe\r\nthat much of the account, on one side or the other, will depend on\r\nwhat we now decide. Our own happiness alone is not affected by the\r\nevent. All nations are interested in the determination. We have it in\r\nour power to secure the happiness of one half of the human race. Its\r\nadoption may involve the misery of the other hemisphere.\" Thus far the\r\nstenographer had proceeded, when he suddenly stopped, and placed\r\nwithin brackets the following note: \"[Here a violent storm arose,\r\nwhich put the House in such disorder, that Mr. Henry was obliged to\r\nconclude.]\"[396] But the scene which is thus quietly despatched by the\r\nofficial reporter of the convention was again and again described, by\r\nmany who were witnesses of it, as something most sublime and even\r\nappalling. After having delineated with overpowering vividness the\r\ncalamities which were likely to befall mankind from their adoption of\r\nthe proposed frame of government, the orator, it is said, as if\r\nwielding an enchanter's wand, suddenly enlarged the arena of the\r\ndebate and the number of his auditors; for, peering beyond the veil\r\nwhich shuts in mortal sight, and pointing \"to those celestial beings\r\nwho were hovering over the scene,\" he addressed to them \"an invocation\r\nthat made every nerve shudder with supernatural horror, when, lo! a\r\nstorm at that instant rose, which shook the whole building, and the\r\nspirits whom he had called seemed to have come at his bidding. Nor did\r\nhis eloquence, or the storm, immediately cease; but availing himself\r\nof the incident, with a master's art, he seemed to mix in the fight of\r\nhis ethereal auxiliaries, and, 'rising on the wings of the tempest, to\r\nseize upon the artillery of heaven, and direct its fiercest thunders\r\nagainst the heads of his adversaries.' The scene became insupportable;\r\nand the House rose without the formality of adjournment, the members\r\nrushing from their seats with precipitation and confusion.\"[397]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[362] _Writings of Washington_, ix. 265-266.\r\n\r\n[363] MS.\r\n\r\n[364] _Writings of Washington_, ix. 273.\r\n\r\n[365] Madison, _Letters_, etc. i. 356.\r\n\r\n[366] _Ibid._ i. 364-365.\r\n\r\n[367] Madison, _Letters_, etc. i. 378.\r\n\r\n[368] _Ibid._ i. 387.\r\n\r\n[369] Madison, _Letters_, i. 388.\r\n\r\n[370] Bancroft, _Hist.

A way was\r\nprovided,--but an extremely strait and narrow way. No amendment\r\nwhatsoever could become valid until it had been accepted by three\r\nfourths of the States; and no amendment could be submitted to the\r\nStates for their consideration until it had first been approved,\r\neither by two thirds of both houses of Congress, or else by a majority\r\nof a convention specially called by Congress at the request of two\r\nthirds of the States.\r\n\r\nClearly, the framers of the Constitution intended that the supreme law\r\nof the land, when once agreed to, should have within it a principle of\r\nfixedness almost invincible. At any rate, the process by which alone\r\nalterations can be made, involves so wide an area of territory, so\r\nmany distinct groups of population, and is withal, in itself, so\r\nmanifold and complex, so slow, and so liable to entire stoppage, that\r\nany proposition looking toward change must inevitably perish long\r\nbefore reaching the far-away goal of final endorsement, unless that\r\nproposition be really impelled by a public demand not only very\r\nenergetic and persistent, but well-nigh universal. Indeed, the\r\nconstitutional provision for amendments seemed, at that time, to many,\r\nto be almost a constitutional prohibition of amendments.\r\n\r\nIt was, in part, for this very reason that Patrick Henry had urged\r\nthat those amendments of the Constitution which, in his opinion, were\r\nabsolutely necessary, should be secured before its adoption, and not\r\nbe left to the doubtful chance of their being obtained afterward, as\r\nthe result of a process ingeniously contrived, as it were, to prevent\r\ntheir being obtained at all. But at the close of that June day on\r\nwhich he and his seventy-eight associates walked away from the\r\nconvention wherein, on this very proposition, they had just been voted\r\ndown, how did the case stand? The Constitution, now become the supreme\r\nlaw of the land, was a Constitution which, unless amended, would, as\r\nthey sincerely believed, effect the political ruin of the American\r\npeople. As good citizens, as good men, what was left for them to do?\r\nThey had fought hard to get the Constitution amended before adoption.\r\nThey had failed. They must now fight hard to get it amended after\r\nadoption. Disastrous would it be, to assume that the needed amendments\r\nwould now be carried at any rate. True, the Virginia convention, like\r\nthe conventions of several other States, had voted to recommend\r\namendments. But the hostility to amendments, as Patrick Henry\r\nbelieved, was too deeply rooted to yield to mere recommendations. The\r\nnecessary amendments would not find their way through all the hoppers\r\nand tubes and valves of the enormous mill erected within the\r\nConstitution, unless forced onward by popular agitation,--and by\r\npopular agitation widespread, determined, vehement, even alarming. The\r\npowerful enemies of amendments must be convinced that, until\r\namendments were carried through that mill, there would be no true\r\npeace or content among the surrounding inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis gives us the clew to the policy steadily and firmly pursued by\r\nPatrick Henry as a party leader, from June, 1788, until after the\r\nratification of the first ten amendments, on the 15th of December,\r\n1791. It was simply a strategic policy dictated by his honest view of\r\nthe situation; a bold, manly, patriotic policy; a policy, however,\r\nwhich was greatly misunderstood, and grossly misrepresented, at the\r\ntime; a policy, too, which grieved the heart of Washington, and for\r\nseveral years raised between him and his ancient friend the one cloud\r\nof distrust that ever cast a shadow upon their intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at the very opening of the Virginia convention, and in view\r\nof the possible defeat of his demand for amendments, Patrick Henry had\r\nformed a clear outline of this policy, even to the extent of\r\norganizing throughout the State local societies for stirring up, and\r\nfor keeping up, the needed agitation. All this is made evident by an\r\nimportant letter written by him to General John Lamb of New York, and\r\ndated at Richmond, June 9, 1788,--when the convention had been in\r\nsession just one week. In this letter, after some preliminary words,\r\nhe says:--\r\n\r\n     It is matter of great consolation to find that the\r\n     sentiments of a vast majority of Virginians are in unison\r\n     with those of our Northern friends. I am satisfied four\r\n     fifths of our inhabitants are opposed to the new scheme of\r\n     government. Indeed, in the part of this country lying south\r\n     of James River, I am confident, nine tenths are opposed to\r\n     it. And yet, strange as it may seem, the numbers in\r\n     convention appear equal on both sides: so that the majority,\r\n     which way soever it goes, will be small. The friends and\r\n     seekers of power have, with their usual subtilty, wriggled\r\n     themselves into the choice of the people, by assuming shapes\r\n     as various as the faces of the men they address on such\r\n     occasions.\r\n\r\n     If they shall carry their point, and preclude previous\r\n     amendments, which we have ready to offer, it will become\r\n     highly necessary to form the society you mention. Indeed, it\r\n     appears the only chance for securing a remnant of those\r\n     invaluable rights which are yielded by the new plan. Colonel\r\n     George Mason has agreed to act as chairman of our republican\r\n     society. His character I need not describe. He is every way\r\n     fit; and we have concluded to send you by Colonel Oswald a\r\n     copy of the Bill of Rights, and of the particular amendments\r\n     we intend to propose in our convention. The fate of them is\r\n     altogether uncertain; but of that you will be informed. To\r\n     assimilate our views on this great subject is of the last\r\n     moment; and our opponents expect much from our dissension.\r\n     As we see the danger, I think it is easily avoided.\r\n\r\n     I can assure you that North Carolina is more decidedly\r\n     opposed to the new government than Virginia. The people\r\n     there seem rife for hazarding all, before they submit.\r\n     Perhaps the organization of our system may be so contrived\r\n     as to include lesser associations dispersed throughout the\r\n     State. This will remedy in some degree the inconvenience\r\n     arising from our dispersed situation. Colonel Oswald's short\r\n     stay here prevents my saying as much on the subject as I\r\n     could otherwise have done. And after assuring you of my\r\n     ardent wishes for the happiness of our common country, and\r\n     the best interests of humanity, I beg leave to subscribe\r\n     myself, with great respect and regard,\r\n\r\n                         Sir, your obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                            P. HENRY.[398]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June, within a few hours, very likely, after the final\r\nadjournment of the convention, Madison hastened to report to\r\nWashington the great and exhilarating result, but with this anxious\r\nand really unjust surmise respecting the course then to be pursued by\r\nPatrick Henry:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. H----y declared, previous to the final question, that\r\n     although he should submit as a quiet citizen, he should\r\n     seize the first moment that offered for shaking off the yoke\r\n     in a constitutional way. I suspect the plan will be to\r\n     encourage two thirds of the legislatures in the task of\r\n     undoing the work; or to get a Congress appointed in the\r\n     first instance that will commit suicide on their own\r\n     authority.\"[399]\r\n\r\nAt the same sitting, probably, Madison sent off to Hamilton, at New\r\nYork, another report, in which his conjecture as to Patrick Henry's\r\nintended policy is thus stated:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am so uncharitable as to suspect that the ill-will to the\r\n     Constitution will produce every peaceable effort to disgrace\r\n     and destroy it. Mr. Henry declared ... that he should wait\r\n     with impatience for the favorable moment of regaining, in a\r\n     constitutional way, the lost liberties of his country.\"[400]\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward, by which time, doubtless, Madison's letter had\r\nreached Mount Vernon, Washington wrote to Benjamin Lincoln of\r\nMassachusetts, respecting the result of the convention:--\r\n\r\n     \"Our accounts from Richmond are that ... the final decision\r\n     exhibited a solemn scene, and that there is every reason to\r\n     expect a perfect acquiescence therein by the minority. Mr.\r\n     Henry, the great leader of it, has signified that, though he\r\n     can never be reconciled to the Constitution in its present\r\n     form, and shall give it every constitutional opposition in\r\n     his power, yet he will submit to it peaceably.\"[401]\r\n\r\nThus, about the end of June, 1788, there came down upon the fierce\r\npolitical strife in Virginia a lull, which lasted until the 20th of\r\nOctober, at which time the legislature assembled for its autumnal\r\nsession. Meantime, however, the convention of New York had adopted the\r\nConstitution, but after a most bitter fight, and by a majority of only\r\nthree votes, and only in consequence of the pledge that every possible\r\neffort should be made to obtain speedily those great amendments that\r\nwere at last called for by a determined public demand. One of the\r\nefforts contemplated by the New York convention took the form of a\r\ncircular letter to the governors of the several States, urging almost\r\npathetically that \"effectual measures be immediately taken for calling\r\na convention\" to propose those amendments which are necessary for\r\nallaying \"the apprehensions and discontents\" then so prevalent.[402]\r\n\r\nThis circular letter \"rekindled,\" as Madison then wrote to Jefferson,\r\n\"an ardor among the opponents of the federal Constitution for an\r\nimmediate revision of it by another general convention, ... Mr. Henry\r\nand his friends in Virginia enter with great zeal into the\r\nscheme.\"[403] In a letter written by Washington, nearly a month before\r\nthe meeting of the legislature, it is plainly indicated that his mind\r\nwas then grievously burdened by the anxieties of the situation, and\r\nthat he was disposed to put the very worst construction upon the\r\nexpected conduct of Patrick Henry and his party in the approaching\r\nsession:--\r\n\r\n     \"Their expedient will now probably be an attempt to procure\r\n     the election of so many of their own junto under the new\r\n     government, as, by the introduction of local and\r\n     embarrassing disputes, to impede or frustrate its\r\n     operation.... I assure you I am under painful apprehensions\r\n     from the single circumstance of Mr. H. having the whole game\r\n     to play in the Assembly of this State; and the effect it may\r\n     have in others should be counteracted if possible.\"[404]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Assembly met, than Patrick Henry's ascendency became\r\napparent. His sway over that body was such that it was described as\r\n\"omnipotent.\" And by the time the session had been in progress not\r\nquite a month, Washington informed Madison that \"the accounts from\r\nRichmond\" were \"very unpropitious to federal measures.\" \"In one word,\"\r\nhe added, \"it is said that the edicts of Mr. H. are enregistered with\r\nless opposition in the Virginia Assembly than those of the grand\r\nmonarch by his parliaments. He has only to say, Let this be law, and\r\nit is law.\"[405] Within ten days from the opening of the session, the\r\nHouse showed its sensitive response to Patrick Henry's leadership by\r\nadopting a series of resolutions, the chief purpose of which was to\r\nask Congress to call immediately a national convention for proposing\r\nto the States the required amendments. In the debate on the subject,\r\nhe is said to have declared \"that he should oppose every measure\r\ntending to the organization of the government, unless accompanied with\r\nmeasures for the amendment of the Constitution.\"[406]\r\n\r\nSome phrases in one of his resolutions were most offensive to those\r\nmembers of the House who had \"befriended the new Constitution,\" and\r\nwho, by implication at least, were held forth as \"betrayers of the\r\ndearest rights of the people.\" \"If Mr. Henry pleases,\" so wrote a\r\ncorrespondent of Washington, \"he will carry the resolution in its\r\npresent terms, than which none, in my opinion, can be more\r\nexceptionable or inflammatory; though, as he is sometimes kind and\r\ncondescending, he may perhaps be induced to alter it.\"[407]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these resolutions, a formal application to Congress\r\nfor a national convention was prepared by Patrick Henry, and adopted\r\nby the House on the 14th of November. Every word of that document\r\ndeserves now to be read, as his own account of the spirit and purpose\r\nof a measure then and since then so profoundly and so cruelly\r\nmisinterpreted:--\r\n\r\n     \"The good people of this commonwealth, in convention\r\n     assembled, having ratified the Constitution submitted to\r\n     their consideration, this legislature has, in conformity to\r\n     that act, and the resolutions of the United States in\r\n     Congress assembled to them transmitted, thought proper to\r\n     make the arrangements that were _necessary_ for carrying it\r\n     into effect. Having thus shown themselves obedient to the\r\n     voice of their constituents, all America will find that, so\r\n     far as it depends on them, that plan of government will be\r\n     carried into immediate operation.\r\n\r\n     \"But the sense of the people of Virginia would be but in\r\n     part complied with, and but little regarded, if we went no\r\n     further. In the very moment of adoption, and coeval with the\r\n     ratification of the new plan of government, the general\r\n     voice of the convention of this State pointed to objects no\r\n     less interesting to the people we represent, and equally\r\n     entitled to your attention. At the same time that, from\r\n     motives of affection for our sister States, the convention\r\n     yielded their assent to the ratification, they gave the most\r\n     unequivocal proofs that they dreaded its operation under the\r\n     present form.\r\n\r\n     \"In acceding to a government under this impression, painful\r\n     must have been the prospect, had they not derived\r\n     consolation from a full expectation of its imperfections\r\n     being speedily amended. In this resource, therefore, they\r\n     placed their confidence,--a confidence that will continue to\r\n     support them whilst they have reason to believe they have\r\n     not calculated upon it in vain.\r\n\r\n     \"In making known to you the objections of the people of this\r\n     Commonwealth to the new plan of government, we deem it\r\n     unnecessary to enter into a particular detail of its\r\n     defects, which they consider as involving all the great and\r\n     unalienable rights of freemen: for their sense on this\r\n     subject, we refer you to the proceedings of their late\r\n     convention, and the sense of this General Assembly, as\r\n     expressed in their resolutions of the     day of     .\r\n\r\n     \"We think proper, however, to declare that in our opinion,\r\n     as those objections were not founded in speculative theory,\r\n     but deduced from principles which have been established by\r\n     the melancholy example of other nations, in different ages,\r\n     so they will never be removed until the cause itself shall\r\n     cease to exist. The sooner, therefore, the public\r\n     apprehensions are quieted, and the government is possessed\r\n     of the confidence of the people, the more salutary will be\r\n     its operations, and the longer its duration.\r\n\r\n     \"The cause of amendments we consider as a common cause; and\r\n     since concessions have been made from political motives,\r\n     which we conceive may endanger the republic, we trust that a\r\n     commendable zeal will be shown for obtaining those\r\n     provisions which, experience has taught us, are necessary to\r\n     secure from danger the unalienable rights of human nature.\r\n\r\n     \"The anxiety with which our countrymen press for the\r\n     accomplishment of this important end, will ill admit of\r\n     delay. The slow forms of congressional discussion and\r\n     recommendation, if indeed they should ever agree to any\r\n     change, would, we fear, be less certain of success. Happily\r\n     for their wishes, the Constitution hath presented an\r\n     alternative, by admitting the submission to a convention of\r\n     the States. To this, therefore, we resort, as the source\r\n     from whence they are to derive relief from their present\r\n     apprehensions. We do, therefore, in behalf of our\r\n     constituents, in the most earnest and solemn manner, make\r\n     this application to Congress, that a convention be\r\n     immediately called, of deputies from the several States,\r\n     with full power to take into their consideration the defects\r\n     of this Constitution, that have been suggested by the state\r\n     conventions, and report such amendments thereto, as they\r\n     shall find best suited to promote our common interests, and\r\n     secure to ourselves and our latest posterity the great and\r\n     unalienable rights of mankind.\"[408]\r\n\r\nSuch was the purpose, such was the temper, of Virginia's appeal,\r\naddressed to Congress, and written by Patrick Henry, on behalf of\r\nimmediate measures for curing the supposed defects of the\r\nConstitution. Was it not likely that this appeal would be granted? One\r\ngrave doubt haunted the mind of Patrick Henry. If, in the elections\r\nfor senators and representatives then about to occur in the several\r\nStates, very great care was not taken, it might easily happen that a\r\nmajority of the members of Congress would be composed of men who would\r\nobstruct, and perhaps entirely defeat, the desired amendments. With\r\nthe view of doing his part towards the prevention of such a result, he\r\ndetermined that both the senators from Virginia, and as many as\r\npossible of its representatives, should be persons who could be\r\ntrusted to help, and not to hinder, the great project.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the day came for the election of senators by the\r\nAssembly of Virginia, he just stood up in his place and named \"Richard\r\nHenry Lee and William Grayson, Esquires,\" as the two men who ought to\r\nbe elected as senators; and, furthermore, he named James Madison as\r\nthe one man who ought not to be elected as senator. Whereupon the vote\r\nwas taken; \"and after some time,\" as the journal expresses it, the\r\ncommittee to examine the ballot-boxes \"returned into the House, and\r\nreported that they had ... found a majority of votes in favor of\r\nRichard Henry Lee and William Grayson, Esquires.\"[409] On the 8th of\r\nDecember, 1788, just one month afterward, Madison himself, in a letter\r\nto Jefferson, thus alluded to the incident: \"They made me a candidate\r\nfor the Senate, for which I had not allotted my pretensions. The\r\nattempt was defeated by Mr. Henry, who is omnipotent in the present\r\nlegislature, and who added to the expedients common on such occasions\r\na public philippic against my federal principles.\"[410]\r\n\r\nVirginia's delegation in the Senate was thus made secure. How about\r\nher delegation in the lower house? That, also, was an affair to be\r\nsharply looked to. Above all things, James Madison, as the supposed\r\nfoe of amendments, was to be prevented, if possible, from winning an\r\nelection. Therefore the committee of the House of Delegates, which was\r\nappointed for the very purpose, among other things, of dividing the\r\nState into its ten congressional districts, so carved out those\r\ndistricts as to promote the election of the friends of the good cause,\r\nand especially to secure, as was hoped, the defeat of its great enemy.\r\nOf this committee Patrick Henry was not a member; but as a majority of\r\nits members were known to be his devoted followers, very naturally\r\nupon him, at the time, was laid the burden of the blame for\r\npractising this ignoble device in politics,--a device which, when\r\nintroduced into Massachusetts several years afterward, also by a\r\nRevolutionary father, came to be christened with the satiric name of\r\n\"gerrymandering.\" Surely it was a rare bit of luck, in the case of\r\nPatrick Henry, that the wits of Virginia did not anticipate the wits\r\nof Massachusetts by describing this trick as \"henrymandering;\" and\r\nthat he thus narrowly escaped the ugly immortality of having his name\r\nhanded down from age to age in the coinage of a base word which should\r\ndesignate a base thing,--one of the favorite, shabby manoeuvres of\r\nless scrupulous American politicians.[411]\r\n\r\nThus, however, within four weeks from the opening of the session, he\r\nhad succeeded in pressing through the legislature, in the exact form\r\nhe wished, all these measures for giving effect to Virginia's demand\r\nupon Congress for amendments. This being accomplished, he withdrew\r\nfrom the service of the House for the remainder of the session,\r\nprobably on account of the great urgency of his professional\r\nengagements at that time. The journal of the House affords us no trace\r\nof his presence there after the 18th of November; and although the\r\nlegislature continued in session until the 13th of December, its\r\nbusiness did not digress beyond local topics. To all these facts,\r\nrather bitter allusion is made in a letter to the governor of New\r\nHampshire, written from Mount Vernon, on the 31st of January, 1789, by\r\nthe private secretary of Washington, Tobias Lear, who thus reflected,\r\nno doubt, the mood of his chief:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Henry, the leader of the opposition in this State,\r\n     finding himself beaten off the ground by fair argument in\r\n     the state convention, and outnumbered upon the important\r\n     question, collected his whole strength, and pointed his\r\n     whole force against the government, in the Assembly. He here\r\n     met with but a feeble opposition.... He led on his almost\r\n     unresisted phalanx, and planted the standard of hostility\r\n     upon the very battlements of federalism. In plain English,\r\n     he ruled a majority of the Assembly; and his edicts were\r\n     registered by that body with less opposition than those of\r\n     the Grand Monarque have met with from his parliaments. He\r\n     chose the two senators.... He divided the State into\r\n     districts, ... taking care to arrange matters so as to have\r\n     the county, of which Mr. Madison is an inhabitant, thrown\r\n     into a district of which a majority were supposed to be\r\n     unfriendly to the government, and by that means exclude him\r\n     from the representative body in Congress. He wrote the\r\n     answer to Governor Clinton's letter, and likewise the\r\n     circular letter to the executives of the several States....\r\n     And after he had settled everything relative to the\r\n     government wholly, I suppose, to his satisfaction, he\r\n     mounted his horse and rode home, leaving the little business\r\n     of the State to be done by anybody who chose to give\r\n     themselves the trouble of attending to it.\"[412]\r\n\r\nHow great was the effect of these strategic measures, forced by\r\nPatrick Henry through the legislature of Virginia in the autumn of\r\n1788, was not apparent, of course, until after the organization of the\r\nfirst Congress of the United States, in the spring of 1789. Not until\r\nthe 5th of May could time be found by that body for paying the least\r\nattention to the subject of amendments. On that day Theodoric Bland,\r\nfrom Virginia, presented to the House of Representatives the solemn\r\napplication of his State for a new convention; and, after some\r\ndiscussion, this document was entered on the journals of the\r\nHouse.[413] The subject was then dropped until the 8th of June, when\r\nMadison, who had been elected to Congress in spite of Patrick Henry,\r\nand who had good reason to know how dangerous it would be for Congress\r\nto trifle with the popular demand for amendments, succeeded, against\r\nmuch opposition, in getting the House to devote that day to a\r\npreliminary discussion of the business. It was again laid aside for\r\nnearly six weeks, and again got a slight hearing on the 21st of July.\r\nOn the 13th of August it was once more brought to the reluctant\r\nattention of the House, and then proved the occasion of a debate which\r\nlasted until the 24th of that month, when the House finished its work\r\non the subject, and sent up to the Senate seventeen articles of\r\namendment. Only twelve of these articles succeeded in passing the\r\nSenate; and of these twelve, only ten received from the States that\r\napproval which was necessary to their ratification. This was obtained\r\non the 15th of December, 1791.\r\n\r\nThe course thus taken by Congress, in itself proposing amendments, was\r\nnot at the time pleasing to the chiefs of that party which, in the\r\nseveral States, had been clamorous for amendments.[414] These men,\r\ndesiring more radical changes in the Constitution than could be expected\r\nfrom Congress, had set their hearts on a new convention,--which,\r\nundoubtedly, had it been called, would have reconstructed, from top to\r\nbottom, the work done by the convention of 1787. Yet it should be\r\nnoticed that the ten amendments, thus obtained under the initiative of\r\nCongress, embodied \"nearly every material change suggested by\r\nVirginia;\"[415] and that it was distinctly due, in no small degree, to\r\nthe bitter and implacable urgency of the popular feeling in Virginia,\r\nunder the stimulus of Patrick Henry's leadership, that Congress was\r\ninduced by Madison to pay any attention to the subject. In the matter of\r\namendments, therefore, Patrick Henry and his party did not get all that\r\nthey demanded, nor in the way that they demanded; but even so much as\r\nthey did get, they would not then have got at all, had they not demanded\r\nmore, and demanded more, also, through the channel of a new convention,\r\nthe dread of which, it is evident, drove Madison and his brethren in\r\nCongress into the prompt concession of amendments which they themselves\r\ndid not care for. Those amendments were really a tub to the whale; but\r\nthen that tub would not have been thrown overboard at all, had not the\r\nwhale been there, and very angry, and altogether too troublesome with\r\nhis foam-compelling tail, and with that huge head of his which could\r\nbatter as well as spout.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[398] Leake, _Life of Gen.

One of his kinsmen has left on record a pleasant anecdote to\r\nthe effect that the orator happened to mention at that time to a\r\nfriend how anxious he was under the great burden of his debts. \"Go\r\nback to the bar,\" said his friend; \"your tongue will soon pay your\r\ndebts. If you will promise to go, I will give you a retaining fee on\r\nthe spot.\"[416] This course, in fact, he had already determined to\r\ntake; and thus at the age of fifty, at no time robust in health, and\r\nat that time grown prematurely old under the storm and stress of all\r\nthose unquiet years, he again buckled on his professional armor, rusty\r\nfrom long disuse, and pluckily began his life over again, in the hope\r\nof making some provision for his own declining days, as well as for\r\nthe honor and welfare of his great brood of children and\r\ngrandchildren. To this task, accordingly, he then bent himself, with a\r\ngrim wilfulness that would not yield either to bodily weakness, or to\r\nthe attractions or the distractions of politics. It is delightful to\r\nbe permitted to add, that his energy was abundantly rewarded; and that\r\nin exactly eight years thereafter, namely in 1794, he was able to\r\nretire, in comfort and wealth, from all public and professional\r\nemployments of every sort.\r\n\r\nOf course the mere announcement, in 1786, that Patrick Henry was then\r\nready once more to receive clients, was enough to excite the attention\r\nof all persons in Virginia who might have important interests in\r\nlitigation. His great renown throughout the country, his high personal\r\ncharacter, his overwhelming gifts in argument, his incomparable gifts\r\nin persuasion, were such as to ensure an almost dominant advantage to\r\nany cause which he should espouse before any tribunal. Confining\r\nhimself, therefore, to his function as an advocate, and taking only\r\nsuch cases as were worth his attention, he was immediately called to\r\nappear in the courts in all parts of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for us to try to follow this veteran and brilliant\r\nadvocate in his triumphal progress from one court-house to another, or\r\nto give the detail of the innumerable causes in which he was engaged\r\nduring these last eight years of his practice at the bar. Of all the\r\ncauses, however, in which he ever took part as a lawyer, in any period\r\nof his career, probably the most difficult and important, in a legal\r\naspect, was the one commonly referred to as that of the British debts,\r\nargued by him in the Circuit Court of the United States at Richmond,\r\nfirst in 1791, and again, in the same place, in 1793.[417]\r\n\r\nA glance at the origin of this famous cause will help us the better to\r\nunderstand the significance of his relation to it. By the treaty with\r\nGreat Britain in 1783, British subjects were empowered \"to recover\r\ndebts previously contracted to them by our citizens, notwithstanding a\r\npayment of the debt into a state treasury had been made during the\r\nwar, under the authority of a state law of sequestration.\" According\r\nto this provision a British subject, one William Jones, brought an\r\naction of debt in the federal court at Richmond, against a citizen of\r\nVirginia, Thomas Walker, on a bond dated May, 1772. The real question\r\nwas \"whether payment of a debt due before the war of the Revolution,\r\nfrom a citizen of Virginia to British subjects, into the loan office\r\nof Virginia, pursuant to a law of that State, discharged the debtor.\"\r\n\r\nThe case, as will readily be seen, involved many subtle and difficult\r\npoints of law, municipal, national, and international; and the defence\r\nwas contained in the following five pleas: (1.) That of payment,\r\ngenerally; (2.) That of the Virginia act of sequestration, October 20,\r\n1777; (3.) That of the Virginia act of forfeiture, May 3, 1779; (4.)\r\nThat of British violations of the treaty of 1783; (5.) That of the\r\nnecessary annulment of the debt, in consequence of the dissolution of\r\nthe co-allegiance of the two parties, on the declaration of\r\nindependence.[418]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the importance attached to the case may be inferred from\r\nthe assertion of Wirt, that \"the whole power of the bar of Virginia\r\nwas embarked\" in it; and that the \"learning, argument, and eloquence\"\r\nexhibited in the discussion were such \"as to have placed that bar, in\r\nthe estimation of the federal judges, ... above all others in the\r\nUnited States.\"[419] Associated with Patrick Henry, for the defendant,\r\nwere John Marshall, Alexander Campbell, and James Innes.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks before the trial of this cause in 1791, Patrick\r\nHenry secluded himself from all other engagements, and settled down to\r\nintense study in the retirement of his home in the country. A grandson\r\nof the orator, Patrick Henry Fontaine, who was there as a student of\r\nthe law, relates that he himself was sent off on a journey of sixty\r\nmiles to procure a copy of Vattel's Law of Nations. From this and\r\nother works of international law, the old lawyer \"made many\r\nquotations; and with the whole syllabus of notes and heads of\r\narguments, he filled a manuscript volume more than an inch thick, and\r\nclosely written; a book ... bound with leather, and convenient for\r\ncarrying in his pocket. He had in his yard ... an office, built at\r\nsome distance from his dwelling, and an avenue of fine black locusts\r\nshaded a walk in front of it.... He usually walked and meditated, when\r\nthe weather permitted, in this shaded avenue.... For several days in\r\nsuccession, before his departure to Richmond to attend the court,\" the\r\norator was seen \"walking frequently in this avenue, with his note-book\r\nin his hand, which he often opened and read; and from his gestures,\r\nwhile promenading alone in the shade of the locusts,\" it was supposed\r\nthat he was committing his speech to memory.[420] According to another\r\naccount, so eager was his application to this labor that, in one stage\r\nof it, \"he shut himself up in his office for three days, during which\r\nhe did not see his family; his food was handed by a servant through\r\nthe office door.\"[421] Of all this preparation, not unworthy to be\r\ncalled Demosthenic, the result was, if we may accept the opinion of\r\none eminent lawyer, that Patrick Henry \"came forth, on this occasion,\r\na perfect master of every law, national and municipal, which touched\r\nthe subject of investigation in the most distant point.\"[422]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 14th of November, 1791, that the cause came on to be\r\nargued in the court-house at Richmond, before Judges Johnson and Blair\r\nof the Supreme Court, and Judge Griffin of that district. The case of\r\nthe plaintiff was opened by Mr. Counsellor Baker, whose argument\r\nlasted till the evening of that day. Patrick Henry was to begin his\r\nargument in reply the next morning.\r\n\r\n     \"The legislature was then in session; but when eleven\r\n     o'clock, the hour for the meeting of the court, arrived, the\r\n     speaker found himself without a house to do business. All\r\n     his authority and that of his sergeant at arms were\r\n     unavailing to keep the members in their seats: every\r\n     consideration of public duty yielded to the anxiety which\r\n     they felt, in common with the rest of their fellow citizens,\r\n     to hear this great man on this truly great and extensively\r\n     interesting question. Accordingly, when the court was ready\r\n     to proceed to business, the court-room of the capitol, large\r\n     as it is, was insufficient to contain the vast concourse\r\n     that was pressing to enter it. The portico, and the area in\r\n     which the statue of Washington stands, were filled with a\r\n     disappointed crowd, who nevertheless maintained their stand\r\n     without. In the court-room itself, the judges, through\r\n     condescension to the public anxiety, relaxed the rigor of\r\n     respect which they were in the habit of exacting, and\r\n     permitted the vacant seats of the bench, and even the\r\n     windows behind it, to be occupied by the impatient\r\n     multitude. The noise and tumult occasioned by seeking a more\r\n     favorable station was at length hushed, and the profound\r\n     silence which reigned within the room gave notice to those\r\n     without that the orator had risen, or was on the point of\r\n     rising. Every eye in front of the bar was riveted upon him\r\n     with the most eager attention; and so still and deep was the\r\n     silence that every one might hear the throbbing of his own\r\n     heart. Mr. Henry, however, appeared wholly unconscious that\r\n     all this preparation was on his account, and rose with as\r\n     much simplicity and composure as if the occasion had been\r\n     one of ordinary occurrence.... It may give the reader some\r\n     idea of the amplitude of the argument, when he is told that\r\n     Mr. Henry was engaged three days successively in its\r\n     delivery; and some faint conception of the enchantment which\r\n     he threw over it, when he learns that although it turned\r\n     entirely on questions of law, yet the audience, mixed as it\r\n     was, seemed so far from being wearied, that they followed\r\n     him throughout with increased enjoyment. The room continued\r\n     full to the last; and such was 'the listening silence' with\r\n     which he was heard, that not a syllable that he uttered is\r\n     believed to have been lost. When he finally sat down, the\r\n     concourse rose, with a general murmur of admiration; the\r\n     scene resembled the breaking up and dispersion of a great\r\n     theatrical assembly, which had been enjoying, for the first\r\n     time, the exhibition of some new and splendid drama; the\r\n     speaker of the House of Delegates was at length able to\r\n     command a quorum for business; and every quarter of the\r\n     city, and at length every part of the State, was filled with\r\n     the echoes of Mr. Henry's eloquent speech.\"[423]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1793 this cause was argued a second time, before the\r\nsame district judge, and, in addition, before Mr. Chief Justice Jay,\r\nand Mr. Justice Iredell of the Supreme Court. On this occasion,\r\napparently, there was the same eagerness to hear Patrick Henry as\r\nbefore,--an eagerness which was shared in by the two visiting judges,\r\nas is indicated in part by a letter from Judge Iredell, who, on the\r\n27th of May, thus wrote to his wife: \"We began on the great British\r\ncauses the second day of the court, and are now in the midst of them.\r\nThe great Patrick Henry is to speak to-day.\"[424] Among the throng of\r\npeople who then poured into the court-room was John Randolph of\r\nRoanoke, then a stripling of twenty years, who, having got a position\r\nvery close to the judges, was made aware of their conversation with\r\none another as the case proceeded. He describes the orator as not\r\nexpecting to speak at that time; \"as old, very much wrapped up, and\r\nresting his head on the bar.\" Meanwhile the chief justice, who, in\r\nearlier days, had often heard Henry in the Continental Congress, told\r\nIredell that that feeble old gentleman in mufflers, with his head\r\nbowed wearily down upon the bar, was \"the greatest of orators.\"\r\n\"Iredell doubted it; and, becoming impatient to hear him, they\r\nrequested him to proceed with his argument, before he had intended to\r\nspeak.... As he arose, he began to complain that it was a hardship,\r\ntoo great, to put the laboring oar into the hands of a decrepit old\r\nman, trembling, with one foot in the grave, weak in his best days, and\r\nfar inferior to the able associate by him.\" Randolph then gives an\r\noutline of his progress through the earlier and somewhat tentative\r\nstages of his speech, comparing his movement to the exercise \"of a\r\nfirst-rate, four-mile race-horse, sometimes displaying his whole power\r\nand speed for a few leaps, and then taking up again.\" \"At last,\"\r\naccording to Randolph, the orator \"got up to full speed; and took a\r\nrapid view of what England had done, when she had been successful in\r\narms; and what would have been our fate, had we been unsuccessful. The\r\ncolor began to come and go in the face of the chief justice; while\r\nIredell sat with his mouth and eyes stretched open, in perfect wonder.\r\nFinally, Henry arrived at his utmost height and grandeur. He raised\r\nhis hands in one of his grand and solemn pauses.... There was a\r\ntumultuous burst of applause; and Judge Iredell exclaimed, 'Gracious\r\nGod! he is an orator indeed!'\"[425] It is said, also, by another\r\nwitness, that Henry happened that day to wear on his finger a diamond\r\nring; and that in the midst of the supreme splendor of his eloquence,\r\na distinguished English visitor who had been given a seat on the\r\nbench, said with significant emphasis to one of the judges, \"The\r\ndiamond is blazing!\"[426]\r\n\r\nAs examples of forensic eloquence, on a great subject, before a great\r\nand a fit assemblage, his several speeches in the case of the British\r\ndebts were, according to all the testimony, of the highest order of\r\nmerit. What they were as examples of legal learning and of legal\r\nargumentation, may be left for every lawyer to judge for himself, by\r\nreading, if he so pleases, the copious extracts which have been\r\npreserved from the stenographic reports of these speeches, as taken by\r\nRobertson. Even from that point of view, they appear not to have\r\nsuffered by comparison with the efforts made, in that cause, on the\r\nsame side, by John Marshall himself. No inconsiderable portion of his\r\nauditors were members of the bar; and those keen and competent critics\r\nare said to have acknowledged themselves as impressed \"not less by the\r\nmatter than the manner\" of his speeches.[427] Moreover, though not\r\nexpressly mentioned, Patrick Henry's argument is pointedly referred to\r\nin the high compliment pronounced by Judge Iredell, when giving his\r\nopinion in this case:--\r\n\r\n     \"The cause has been spoken to, at the bar, with a degree of\r\n     ability equal to any occasion.... I shall, as long as I\r\n     live, remember with pleasure and respect the arguments which\r\n     I have heard in this case. They have discovered an\r\n     ingenuity, a depth of investigation, and a power of\r\n     reasoning fully equal to anything I have ever witnessed; and\r\n     some of them have been adorned with a splendor of eloquence\r\n     surpassing what I have ever felt before. Fatigue has given\r\n     way under its influence, and the heart has been warmed,\r\n     while the understanding has been instructed.\"[428]\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood, however, that while Patrick Henry's\r\npractice included important causes turning, like the one just\r\ndescribed, on propositions of law, and argued by him before the\r\nhighest tribunals, the larger part of the practice to be had in\r\nVirginia at that time must have been in actions tried before juries,\r\nin which his success was chiefly due to his amazing endowments of\r\nsympathy, imagination, tact, and eloquence. The testimony of\r\ncontemporary witnesses respecting his power in this direction is most\r\nabundant, and also most interesting; and, for obvious reasons, such\r\nportions of it as are now to be reproduced should be given in the very\r\nlanguage of the persons who thus heard him, criticised him, and made\r\ndeliberate report concerning him.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in the way of preliminary analysis of Henry's genius and\r\nmethods as an advocate before juries, may be cited a few sentences of\r\nWirt, who, indeed, never heard him, but who, being himself a very\r\ngifted and a very ambitious advocate, eagerly collected and keenly\r\nscanned the accounts of many who had heard him:--\r\n\r\n     \"He adapted himself, without effort, to the character of the\r\n     cause; seized with the quickness of intuition its defensible\r\n     point, and never permitted the jury to lose sight of it. Sir\r\n     Joshua Reynolds has said of Titian, that, by a few strokes\r\n     of his pencil, he knew how to mark the image and character\r\n     of whatever object he attempted; and produced by this means\r\n     a truer representation than any of his predecessors, who\r\n     finished every hair. In like manner Mr. Henry, by a few\r\n     master-strokes upon the evidence, could in general stamp\r\n     upon the cause whatever image or character he pleased; and\r\n     convert it into tragedy or comedy, at his sovereign will,\r\n     and with a power which no efforts of his adversary could\r\n     counteract. He never wearied the jury by a dry and minute\r\n     analysis of the evidence; he did not expend his strength in\r\n     finishing the hairs; he produced all his high effect by\r\n     those rare master-touches, and by the resistless skill with\r\n     which, in a very few words, he could mould and color the\r\n     prominent facts of a cause to his purpose. He had wonderful\r\n     address, too, in leading off the minds of his hearers from\r\n     the contemplation of unfavorable points, if at any time they\r\n     were too stubborn to yield to his power of\r\n     transformation.... It required a mind of uncommon vigilance,\r\n     and most intractable temper, to resist this charm with which\r\n     he decoyed away his hearers; it demanded a rapidity of\r\n     penetration, which is rarely, if ever, to be found in the\r\n     jury-box, to detect the intellectual juggle by which he\r\n     spread his nets around them; it called for a stubbornness\r\n     and obduracy of soul which does not exist, to sit unmoved\r\n     under the pictures of horror or of pity which started from\r\n     his canvas. They might resolve, if they pleased, to decide\r\n     the cause against him, and to disregard everything which he\r\n     could urge in the defence of his client. But it was all in\r\n     vain. Some feint in an unexpected direction threw them off\r\n     their guard, and they were gone; some happy phrase, burning\r\n     from the soul; some image fresh from nature's mint, and\r\n     bearing her own beautiful and genuine impress, struck them\r\n     with delightful surprise, and melted them into conciliation;\r\n     and conciliation towards Mr. Henry was victory inevitable.\r\n     In short, he understood the human character so perfectly;\r\n     knew so well all its strength and all its weaknesses,\r\n     together with every path and by-way which winds around the\r\n     citadel of the best fortified heart and mind, that he never\r\n     failed to take them, either by stratagem or storm.\"[429]\r\n\r\nStill further, in the way of critical analysis, should be cited the\r\nopinion of a distinguished student and master of eloquence, the Rev.\r\nArchibald Alexander of Princeton, who, having more than once heard\r\nPatrick Henry, wrote out, with a scholar's precision, the results of\r\nhis own keen study into the great advocate's success in subduing men,\r\nand especially jurymen:--\r\n\r\n     \"The power of Henry's eloquence was due, first, to the\r\n     greatness of his emotion and passion, accompanied with a\r\n     versatility which enabled him to assume at once any emotion\r\n     or passion which was suited to his ends. Not less\r\n     indispensable, secondly, was a matchless perfection of the\r\n     organs of expression, including the entire apparatus of\r\n     voice, intonation, pause, gesture, attitude, and\r\n     indescribable play of countenance. In no instance did he\r\n     ever indulge in an expression that was not instantly\r\n     recognized as nature itself; yet some of his penetrating and\r\n     subduing tones were absolutely peculiar, and as inimitable\r\n     as they were indescribable. These were felt by every hearer,\r\n     in all their force. His mightiest feelings were sometimes\r\n     indicated and communicated by a long pause, aided by an\r\n     eloquent aspect, and some significant use of his finger. The\r\n     sympathy between mind and mind is inexplicable. Where the\r\n     channels of communication are open, the faculty of revealing\r\n     inward passion great, and the expression of it sudden and\r\n     visible, the effects are extraordinary. Let these shocks of\r\n     influence be repeated again and again, and all other\r\n     opinions and ideas are for the moment absorbed or excluded;\r\n     the whole mind is brought into unison with that of the\r\n     speaker; and the spell-bound listener, till the cause\r\n     ceases, is under an entire fascination. Then perhaps the\r\n     charm ceases, upon reflection, and the infatuated hearer\r\n     resumes his ordinary state.\r\n\r\n     \"Patrick Henry, of course, owed much to his singular insight\r\n     into the feelings of the common mind. In great cases he\r\n     scanned his jury, and formed his mental estimate; on this\r\n     basis he founded his appeals to their predilections and\r\n     character. It is what other advocates do, in a lesser\r\n     degree. When he knew that there were conscientious or\r\n     religious men among the jury, he would most solemnly address\r\n     himself to their sense of right, and would adroitly bring in\r\n     scriptural citations. If this handle was not offered, he\r\n     would lay bare the sensibility of patriotism. Thus it was,\r\n     when he succeeded in rescuing the man who had deliberately\r\n     shot down a neighbor; who moreover lay under the odious\r\n     suspicion of being a Tory, and who was proved to have\r\n     refused supplies to a brigade of the American army.\"[430]\r\n\r\nPassing now from these general descriptions to particular instances,\r\nwe may properly request Dr. Alexander to remain somewhat longer in the\r\nwitness-stand, and to give us, in detail, some of his own\r\nrecollections of Patrick Henry. His testimony, accordingly, is in\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n     \"From my earliest childhood I had been accustomed to hear of\r\n     the eloquence of Patrick Henry. On this subject there\r\n     existed but one opinion in the country. The power of his\r\n     eloquence was felt equally by the learned and the unlearned.\r\n     No man who ever heard him speak, on any important occasion,\r\n     could fail to admit his uncommon power over the minds of his\r\n     hearers.... Being then a young man, just entering on a\r\n     profession in which good speaking was very important, it was\r\n     natural for me to observe the oratory of celebrated men. I\r\n     was anxious to ascertain the true secret of their power; or\r\n     what it was which enabled them to sway the minds of hearers,\r\n     almost at their will.\r\n\r\n     \"In executing a mission from the synod of Virginia, in the\r\n     year 1794, I had to pass through the county of Prince\r\n     Edward, where Mr. Henry then resided. Understanding that he\r\n     was to appear before the circuit court, which met in that\r\n     county, in defence of three men charged with murder, I\r\n     determined to seize the opportunity of observing for myself\r\n     the eloquence of this extraordinary orator. It was with\r\n     some difficulty I obtained a seat in front of the bar, where\r\n     I could have a full view of the speaker, as well as hear him\r\n     distinctly. But I had to submit to a severe penance in\r\n     gratifying my curiosity; for the whole day was occupied with\r\n     the examination of witnesses, in which Mr. Henry was aided\r\n     by two other lawyers. In person, Mr. Henry was lean rather\r\n     than fleshy. He was rather above than below the common\r\n     height, but had a stoop in the shoulders which prevented him\r\n     from appearing as tall as he really was. In his moments of\r\n     animation, he had the habit of straightening his frame, and\r\n     adding to his apparent stature. He wore a brown wig, which\r\n     exhibited no indication of any great care in the dressing.\r\n     Over his shoulders he wore a brown camlet cloak. Under this\r\n     his clothing was black, something the worse for wear. The\r\n     expression of his countenance was that of solemnity and deep\r\n     earnestness. His mind appeared to be always absorbed in\r\n     what, for the time, occupied his attention. His forehead was\r\n     high and spacious, and the skin of his face more than\r\n     usually wrinkled for a man of fifty. His eyes were small and\r\n     deeply set in his head, but were of a bright blue color, and\r\n     twinkled much in their sockets. In short, Mr. Henry's\r\n     appearance had nothing very remarkable, as he sat at rest.\r\n     You might readily have taken him for a common planter, who\r\n     cared very little about his personal appearance. In his\r\n     manners he was uniformly respectful and courteous. Candles\r\n     were brought into the court-house, when the examination of\r\n     the witnesses closed; and the judges put it to the option of\r\n     the bar whether they would go on with the argument that\r\n     night or adjourn until the next day. Paul Carrington,\r\n     Junior, the attorney for the State, a man of large size,\r\n     and uncommon dignity of person and manner, and also an\r\n     accomplished lawyer, professed his willingness to proceed\r\n     immediately, while the testimony was fresh in the minds of\r\n     all. Now for the first time I heard Mr. Henry make anything\r\n     of a speech; and though it was short, it satisfied me of one\r\n     thing, which I had particularly desired to have decided:\r\n     namely, whether like a player he merely assumed the\r\n     appearance of feeling. His manner of addressing the court\r\n     was profoundly respectful. He would be willing to proceed\r\n     with the trial, 'but,' said he, 'my heart is so oppressed\r\n     with the weight of responsibility which rests upon me,\r\n     having the lives of three fellow citizens depending,\r\n     probably, on the exertions which I may be able to make in\r\n     their behalf (here he turned to the prisoners behind him),\r\n     that I do not feel able to proceed to-night. I hope the\r\n     court will indulge me, and postpone the trial till the\r\n     morning.' The impression made by these few words was such as\r\n     I assure myself no one can ever conceive by seeing them in\r\n     print. In the countenance, action, and intonation of the\r\n     speaker, there was expressed such an intensity of feeling,\r\n     that all my doubts were dispelled; never again did I\r\n     question whether Henry felt, or only acted a feeling.\r\n     Indeed, I experienced an instantaneous sympathy with him in\r\n     the emotions which he expressed; and I have no doubt the\r\n     same sympathy was felt by every hearer.\r\n\r\n     \"As a matter of course, the proceedings were deferred till\r\n     the next morning. I was early at my post; the judges were\r\n     soon on the bench, and the prisoners at the bar. Mr.\r\n     Carrington ... opened with a clear and dignified speech, and\r\n     presented the evidence to the jury. Everything seemed\r\n     perfectly plain. Two brothers and a brother-in-law met two\r\n     other persons in pursuit of a slave, supposed to be harbored\r\n     by the brothers. After some altercation and mutual abuse,\r\n     one of the brothers, whose name was John Ford, raised a\r\n     loaded gun which he was carrying, and presenting it at the\r\n     breast of one of the other pair, shot him dead, in open day.\r\n     There was no doubt about the fact. Indeed, it was not\r\n     denied. There had been no other provocation than opprobrious\r\n     words. It is presumed that the opinion of every juror was\r\n     made up from merely hearing the testimony; as Tom Harvey,\r\n     the principal witness, who was acting as constable on the\r\n     occasion, appeared to be a respectable man. For the clearer\r\n     understanding of what follows, it must be observed that said\r\n     constable, in order to distinguish him from another of the\r\n     name, was commonly called Butterwood Harvey, as he lived on\r\n     Butterwood Creek. Mr. Henry, it is believed, understanding\r\n     that the people were on their guard against his faculty of\r\n     moving the passions and through them influencing the\r\n     judgment, did not resort to the pathetic as much as was his\r\n     usual practice in criminal cases. His main object appeared\r\n     to be, throughout, to cast discredit on the testimony of Tom\r\n     Harvey. This he attempted by causing the law respecting\r\n     riots to be read by one of his assistants. It appeared in\r\n     evidence that Tom Harvey had taken upon him to act as\r\n     constable, without being in commission; and that with a\r\n     posse of men he had entered the house of one of the Fords in\r\n     search of the negro, and had put Mrs. Ford, in her husband's\r\n     absence, into a great terror, while she was in a very\r\n     delicate condition, near the time of her confinement. As he\r\n     descanted on the evidence, he would often turn to Tom\r\n     Harvey--a large, bold-looking man--and with the most\r\n     sarcastic look would call him by some name of contempt;\r\n     'this Butterwood Tom Harvey,' 'this would-be constable,'\r\n     etc. By such expressions, his contempt for the man was\r\n     communicated to the hearers. I own I felt it gaining on me,\r\n     in spite of my better judgment; so that before he was done,\r\n     the impression was strong on my mind that Butterwood Harvey\r\n     was undeserving of the smallest credit. This impression,\r\n     however, I found I could counteract the moment I had time\r\n     for reflection. The only part of the speech in which he\r\n     manifested his power of touching the feelings strongly, was\r\n     where he dwelt on the irruption of the company into Ford's\r\n     house, in circumstances so perilous to the solitary wife.\r\n     This appeal to the sensibility of husbands--and he knew that\r\n     all the jury stood in this relation--was overwhelming. If\r\n     the verdict could have been rendered immediately after this\r\n     burst of the pathetic, every man, at least every husband, in\r\n     the house, would have been for rejecting Harvey's testimony,\r\n     if not for hanging him forthwith.\"[431]\r\n\r\nA very critical and cool-headed witness respecting Patrick Henry's\r\npowers as an advocate was Judge Spencer Roane, who presided in one of\r\nthe courts in which the orator was much engaged after his return to\r\nthe bar in 1786:--\r\n\r\n     \"When I saw him there,\" writes Judge Roane, \"he must\r\n     necessarily have been very rusty; yet I considered him as a\r\n     good lawyer.... It was as a criminal lawyer that his\r\n     eloquence had the finest scope.... He was a perfect master\r\n     of the passions of his auditory, whether in the tragic or\r\n     the comic line. The tones of his voice, to say nothing of\r\n     his matter and gesture, were insinuated into the feelings of\r\n     his hearers, in a manner that baffled all description. It\r\n     seemed to operate by mere sympathy, and by his tones alone\r\n     it seemed to me that he could make you cry or laugh at\r\n     pleasure. Yet his gesture came powerfully in aid, and, if\r\n     necessary, would approach almost to the ridiculous.... I\r\n     will try to give some account of his tragic and comic effect\r\n     in two instances that came before me. About the year 1792,\r\n     one Holland killed a young man in Botetourt.... Holland had\r\n     gone up from Louisa as a schoolmaster, but had turned out\r\n     badly, and was very unpopular. The killing was in the night,\r\n     and was generally believed to be murder.... At the instance\r\n     of the father and for a reasonable fee, Mr. H. undertook to\r\n     go to Greenbrier court to defend Holland. Mr. Winston and\r\n     myself were the judges. Such were the prejudices there, as I\r\n     was afterwards informed by Thomas Madison, that the people\r\n     there declared that even Patrick Henry need not come to\r\n     defend Holland, unless he brought a jury with him. On the\r\n     day of the trial the court-house was crowded, and I did not\r\n     move from my seat for fourteen hours, and had no wish to do\r\n     so. The examination took up a great part of the time, and\r\n     the lawyers were probably exhausted. Breckenridge was\r\n     eloquent, but Henry left no dry eye in the court-house. The\r\n     case, I believe, was murder, though, possibly, manslaughter\r\n     only; and Henry laid hold of this possibility with such\r\n     effect as to make all forget that Holland had killed the\r\n     storekeeper, and presented the deplorable case of the jury's\r\n     killing Holland, an innocent man. He also presented, as it\r\n     were, at the clerk's table, old Holland and his wife, who\r\n     were then in Louisa, and asked what must be the feeling of\r\n     this venerable pair at this awful moment, and what the\r\n     consequences to them of a mistaken verdict affecting the\r\n     life of their son. He caused the jury to lose sight of the\r\n     murder they were then trying, and weep with old Holland and\r\n     his wife, whom he painted, and perhaps proved to be, very\r\n     respectable. All this was done in a manner so solemn and\r\n     touching, and a tone so irresistible, that it was impossible\r\n     for the stoutest heart not to take sides with the\r\n     criminal.... The result of the trial was, that, after a\r\n     retirement of an half or quarter of an hour, the jury\r\n     brought in a verdict of not guilty! But on being reminded by\r\n     the court that they might find an inferior degree of\r\n     homicide, they brought in a verdict of manslaughter.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Henry was equally successful in the comic line.... The\r\n     case was that a wagoner and the plaintiff were travelling to\r\n     Richmond, and the wagoner knocked down a turkey and put it\r\n     into his wagon. Complaint was made to the defendant, a\r\n     justice; both the parties were taken up; and the wagoner\r\n     agreed to take a whipping rather than be sent to jail. But\r\n     the plaintiff refused. The justice, however, gave him, also,\r\n     a small whipping; and for this the suit was brought. The\r\n     plaintiff's plea was that he was wholly innocent of the act\r\n     committed. Mr. H., on the contrary, contended that he was a\r\n     party aiding and assisting. In the course of his remarks he\r\n     thus expressed himself: 'But, gentlemen of the jury, this\r\n     plaintiff tells you that he had nothing to do with the\r\n     turkey. I dare say, gentlemen,--not until it was roasted!'\r\n     and he pronounced the word--'roasted'--with such rotundity\r\n     of voice, and comicalness of manner and gesture, that it\r\n     threw every one into a fit of laughter at the plaintiff,\r\n     who stood up in the place usually allotted to the criminals;\r\n     and the defendant was let off with little or no\r\n     damages.\"[432]\r\n\r\nFinally, we must recall, in illustration of our present subject, an\r\nanecdote left on record in 1813, by the Rev. Conrad Speece, highly\r\ndistinguished during his lifetime, in the Presbyterian communion:--\r\n\r\n     \"Many years ago,\" he then wrote, \"I was at the trial, in one\r\n     of our district courts, of a man charged with murder. The\r\n     case was briefly this: the prisoner had gone, in execution\r\n     of his office as a constable, to arrest a slave who had been\r\n     guilty of some misconduct, and bring him to justice.\r\n     Expecting opposition in the business, the constable took\r\n     several men with him, some of them armed. They found the\r\n     slave on the plantation of his master, within view of the\r\n     house, and proceeded to seize and bind him. His mistress,\r\n     seeing the arrest, came down and remonstrated vehemently\r\n     against it. Finding her efforts unavailing, she went off to\r\n     a barn where her husband was, who was presently perceived\r\n     running briskly to the house. It was known he always kept a\r\n     loaded rifle over his door. The constable now desired his\r\n     company to remain where they were, taking care to keep the\r\n     slave in custody, while he himself would go to the house to\r\n     prevent mischief. He accordingly ran towards the house. When\r\n     he arrived within a short distance of it, the master\r\n     appeared coming out of the door with his rifle in his hand.\r\n     Some witnesses said that as he came to the door he drew the\r\n     cock of the piece, and was seen in the act of raising it to\r\n     the position of firing. But upon these points there was\r\n     not an entire agreement in the evidence. The constable,\r\n     standing near a small building in the yard, at this instant\r\n     fired, and the fire had a fatal effect. No previous malice\r\n     was proved against him; and his plea upon the trial was,\r\n     that he had taken the life of his assailant in necessary\r\n     self-defence.\r\n\r\n     \"A great mass of testimony was delivered. This was commented\r\n     upon with considerable ability by the lawyer for the\r\n     commonwealth, and by another lawyer engaged by the friends\r\n     of the deceased for the prosecution. The prisoner was also\r\n     defended, in elaborate speeches, by two respectable\r\n     advocates. These proceedings brought the day to a close. The\r\n     general whisper through a crowded house was, that the man\r\n     was guilty and could not be saved.\r\n\r\n     \"About dusk, candles were brought, and Henry arose. His\r\n     manner was ... plain, simple, and entirely unassuming.\r\n     'Gentlemen of the jury,' said he, 'I dare say we are all\r\n     very much fatigued with this tedious trial. The prisoner at\r\n     the bar has been well defended already; but it is my duty to\r\n     offer you some further observations in behalf of this\r\n     unfortunate man. I shall aim at brevity. But should I take\r\n     up more of your time than you expect, I hope you will hear\r\n     me with patience, when you consider that blood is\r\n     concerned.'\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot admit the possibility that any one, who never\r\n     heard Henry speak, should be made fully to conceive the\r\n     force of impression which he gave to these few words, 'blood\r\n     is concerned.' I had been on my feet through the day, pushed\r\n     about in the crowd, and was excessively weary. I was\r\n     strongly of opinion, too, notwithstanding all the previous\r\n     defensive pleadings, that the prisoner was guilty of\r\n     murder; and I felt anxious to know how the matter would\r\n     terminate. Yet when Henry had uttered these words, my\r\n     feelings underwent an instantaneous change. I found\r\n     everything within me answering,--'Yes, since blood is\r\n     concerned, in the name of all that is righteous, go on; we\r\n     will hear you with patience until the rising of to-morrow's\r\n     sun!' This bowing of the soul must have been universal; for\r\n     the profoundest silence reigned, as if our very breath had\r\n     been suspended. The spell of the magician was upon us, and\r\n     we stood like statues around him. Under the touch of his\r\n     genius, every particular of the story assumed a new aspect,\r\n     and his cause became continually more bright and promising.\r\n     At length he arrived at the fatal act itself: 'You have been\r\n     told, gentlemen, that the prisoner was bound by every\r\n     obligation to avoid the supposed necessity of firing, by\r\n     leaping behind a house near which he stood at that moment.\r\n     Had he been attacked with a club, or with stones, the\r\n     argument would have been unanswerable, and I should feel\r\n     myself compelled to give up the defence in despair. But\r\n     surely I need not tell you, gentlemen, how wide is the\r\n     difference between sticks or stones, and double-triggered,\r\n     loaded rifles cocked at your breast!' The effect of this\r\n     terrific image, exhibited in this great orator's peerless\r\n     manner, cannot be described. I dare not attempt to delineate\r\n     the paroxysm of emotion which it excited in every heart. The\r\n     result of the whole was, that the prisoner was acquitted;\r\n     with the perfect approbation, I believe, of the numerous\r\n     assembly who attended the trial. What was it that gave such\r\n     transcendent force to the eloquence of Henry? His reasoning\r\n     powers were good; but they have been equalled, and more than\r\n     equalled, by those of many other men. His imagination was\r\n     exceedingly quick, and commanded all the stores of nature,\r\n     as materials for illustrating his subject. His voice and\r\n     delivery were inexpressibly happy. But his most irresistible\r\n     charm was the vivid feeling of his cause, with which he\r\n     spoke. Such feeling infallibly communicates itself to the\r\n     breast of the hearer.\"[433]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[416] Winston, in Wirt, 260.\r\n\r\n[417] Ware, Administrator of Jones, Plaintiff in Error, _v._ Hylton\r\n_et al._, Curtis, _Decisions_, i. 164-229.\r\n\r\n[418] Wirt, 316-318.\r\n\r\n[419] _Ibid._ 312.\r\n\r\n[420] Edward Fontaine, MS.\r\n\r\n[421] Howe, _Hist.

Removing from Prince Edward County, he lived\r\nfor a short time at Long Island, in Campbell County; but in 1795 he\r\nfinally established himself in the county of Charlotte, on an estate\r\ncalled Red Hill,--an estate which continued to be his home during the\r\nrest of his life, which gave to him his burial place, and which still\r\nremains in the possession of his descendants.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which he had thus risen out of pecuniary\r\nembarrassments was not due alone to the earnings of his profession\r\nduring those few years; for while his eminence as an advocate\r\ncommanded the highest fees, probably, that were then paid in Virginia,\r\nit is apparent from his account-books that those fees were not at all\r\nexorbitant, and for a lawyer of his standing would not now be regarded\r\nas even considerable. The truth is that, subsequently to his youthful\r\nand futile attempts at business, he had so profited by the experiences\r\nof his life as to have become a sagacious and an expert man of\r\nbusiness. \"He could buy or sell a horse, or a negro, as well as\r\nanybody, and was peculiarly a judge of the value and quality of\r\nlands.\"[434] It seems to have been chiefly from his investments in\r\nlands, made by him with foresight and judgment, and from which, for a\r\nlong time, he had reaped only burdens and anxieties, that he derived\r\nthe wealth that secured for him the repose of his last years. The\r\ncharge long afterward made by Jefferson, that Patrick Henry's fortune\r\ncame either from a mean use of his right to pay his land debts in a\r\ndepreciated currency \"not worth oak-leaves,\" or from any connection on\r\nhis part with the profligate and infamous Yazoo speculation, has been\r\nshown, by ample evidence, to be untrue.[435]\r\n\r\nThe descriptions which have come down to us of the life led by the old\r\nstatesman in those last five years of retirement make a picture\r\npleasant to look upon. The house at Red Hill, which then became his\r\nhome, \"is beautifully situated on an elevated ridge, the dividing line\r\nof Campbell and Charlotte, within a quarter of a mile of the junction\r\nof Falling River with the Staunton. From it the valley of the Staunton\r\nstretches southward about three miles, varying from a quarter to\r\nnearly a mile in width, and of an oval-like form. Through most fertile\r\nmeadows waving in their golden luxuriance, slowly winds the river,\r\noverhung by mossy foliage, while on all sides gently sloping hills,\r\nrich in verdure, enclose the whole, and impart to it an air of\r\nseclusion and repose. From the brow of the hill, west of the house, is\r\na scene of an entirely different character: the Blue Ridge, with the\r\nlofty peaks of Otter, appears in the horizon at a distance of nearly\r\nsixty miles.\" Under the trees which shaded his lawn, and \"in full view\r\nof the beautiful valley beneath, the orator was accustomed, in\r\npleasant weather, to sit mornings and evenings, with his chair leaning\r\nagainst one of their trunks, and a can of cool spring-water by his\r\nside, from which he took frequent draughts. Occasionally, he walked to\r\nand fro in the yard from one clump of trees to the other, buried in\r\nrevery, at which times he was never interrupted.\"[436] \"His great\r\ndelight,\" says one of his sons-in-law, \"was in conversation, in the\r\nsociety of his friends and family, and in the resources of his own\r\nmind.\"[437] Thus beneath his own roof, or under the shadow of his own\r\ntrees, he loved to sit, like a patriarch, with his family and his\r\nguests gathered affectionately around him, and there, free from\r\nceremony as from care, to give himself up to the interchange of\r\ncongenial thought whether grave or playful, and even to the sports of\r\nthe children. \"His visitors,\" writes one of them, \"have not\r\nunfrequently caught him lying on the floor, with a group of these\r\nlittle ones climbing over him in every direction, or dancing around\r\nhim with obstreperous mirth, to the tune of his violin, while the only\r\ncontest seemed to be who should make the most noise.\"[438]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of contemporaries respecting the sweetness of his spirit\r\nand his great lovableness in private life is most abundant. One who\r\nknew him well in his family, and who was also quite willing to be\r\ncritical upon occasion, has said:--\r\n\r\n     \"With respect to the domestic character of Mr. Henry,\r\n     nothing could be more amiable. In every relation, as a\r\n     husband, father, master, and neighbor, he was entirely\r\n     exemplary. As to the disposition of Mr. Henry, it was the\r\n     best imaginable. I am positive that I never saw him in a\r\n     passion, nor apparently even out of temper. Circumstances\r\n     which would have highly irritated other men had no such\r\n     visible effect on him. He was always calm and collected; and\r\n     the rude attacks of his adversaries in debate only whetted\r\n     the poignancy of his satire.... Shortly after the\r\n     Constitution was adopted, a series of the most abusive and\r\n     scurrilous pieces came out against him, under the signature\r\n     of Decius. They were supposed to be written by John\r\n     Nicholas, ... with the assistance of other more important\r\n     men. They assailed Mr. Henry's conduct in the Convention,\r\n     and slandered his character by various stories hatched up\r\n     against him. These pieces were extremely hateful to all Mr.\r\n     Henry's friends, and, indeed, to a great portion of the\r\n     community. I was at his house in Prince Edward during the\r\n     thickest of them.... He evinced no feeling on the occasion,\r\n     and far less condescended to parry the effects on the public\r\n     mind. It was too puny a contest for him, and he reposed upon\r\n     the consciousness of his own integrity.... With many sublime\r\n     virtues, he had no vice that I knew or ever heard of, and\r\n     scarcely a foible. I have thought, indeed, that he was too\r\n     much attached to property,--a defect, however, which might\r\n     be excused when we reflect on the largeness of a beloved\r\n     family, and the straitened circumstances in which he had\r\n     been confined during a great part of his life.\"[439]\r\n\r\nConcerning his personal habits, we have, through his grandson, Patrick\r\nHenry Fontaine, some testimony which has the merit of placing the\r\ngreat man somewhat more familiarly before us. \"He was,\" we are told,\r\n\"very abstemious in his diet, and used no wine or alcoholic\r\nstimulants. Distressed and alarmed at the increase of drunkenness\r\nafter the Revolutionary war, he did everything in his power to arrest\r\nthe vice. He thought that the introduction of a harmless beverage, as\r\na substitute for distilled spirits, would be beneficial. To effect\r\nthis object, he ordered from his merchant in Scotland a consignment of\r\nbarley, and a Scotch brewer and his wife to cultivate the grain, and\r\nmake small beer. To render the beverage fashionable and popular, he\r\nalways had it upon his table while he was governor during his last\r\nterm of office; and he continued its use, but drank nothing stronger,\r\nwhile he lived.\"[440]\r\n\r\nThough he was always a most loyal Virginian, he became, particularly\r\nin his later years, very unfriendly to that renowned and consolatory\r\nherb so long associated with the fame and fortune of his native State.\r\n\r\n     \"In his old age, the condition of his nervous system made\r\n     the scent of a tobacco-pipe very disagreeable to him. The\r\n     old colored house-servants were compelled to hide their\r\n     pipes, and rid themselves of the scent of tobacco, before\r\n     they ventured to approach him.... They protested that they\r\n     had not smoked, or seen a pipe; and he invariably proved the\r\n     culprit guilty by following the scent, and leading them to\r\n     the corn-cob pipes hid in some crack or cranny, which he\r\n     made them take and throw instantly into the kitchen fire,\r\n     without reforming their habits, or correcting the evil,\r\n     which is likely to continue as long as tobacco will\r\n     grow.\"[441]\r\n\r\nConcerning another of his personal habits, during the years thus\r\npassed in retirement at Red Hill, there is a charming description,\r\nalso derived from the grandson to whom we are indebted for the facts\r\njust mentioned:--\r\n\r\n     \"His residence overlooked a large field in the bottom of\r\n     Staunton River, the most of which could be seen from his\r\n     yard. He rose early; and in the mornings of the spring,\r\n     summer, and fall, before sunrise, while the air was cool and\r\n     calm, reflecting clearly and distinctly the sounds of the\r\n     lowing herds and singing birds, he stood upon an eminence,\r\n     and gave orders and directions to his servants at work a\r\n     half mile distant from him. The strong, musical voices of\r\n     the negroes responded to him. During this elocutionary\r\n     morning exercise, his enunciation was clear and distinct\r\n     enough to be heard over an area which ten thousand people\r\n     could not have filled; and the tones of his voice were as\r\n     melodious as the notes of an Alpine horn.\"[442]\r\n\r\nOf course the house-servants and the field-servants just mentioned\r\nwere slaves; and, from the beginning to the end of his life, Patrick\r\nHenry was a slaveholder. He bought slaves, he sold slaves, and, along\r\nwith the other property--the lands, the houses, the cattle--bequeathed\r\nby him to his heirs, were numerous human beings of the African race.\r\nWhat, then, was the opinion respecting slavery held by this great\r\nchampion of the rights of man? \"Is it not amazing\"--thus he wrote in\r\n1773--\"that, at a time when the rights of humanity are defined and\r\nunderstood with precision, in a country above all others fond of\r\nliberty, in such an age, we find men, professing a religion the most\r\nhumane, mild, meek, gentle, and generous, adopting a principle as\r\nrepugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent with the Bible and\r\ndestructive to liberty?... Would any one believe that I am master of\r\nslaves of my own purchase? I am drawn along by the general\r\ninconvenience of living without them. I will not, I cannot, justify\r\nit; however culpable my conduct, I will so far pay my 'devoir' to\r\nvirtue as to own the excellence and rectitude of her precepts, and to\r\nlament my want of conformity to them. I believe a time will come when\r\nan opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil:\r\neverything we can do is to improve it, if it happens in our day; if\r\nnot, let us transmit to our descendants, together with our slaves, a\r\npity for their unhappy lot, and an abhorrence of slavery. We owe to\r\nthe purity of our religion, to show that it is at variance with that\r\nlaw which warrants slavery.\"[443] After the Revolution, and before the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, he earnestly advocated, in the Virginia\r\nHouse of Delegates, some method of emancipation; and even in the\r\nConvention of 1788, where he argued against the Constitution on the\r\nground that it obviously conferred upon the general government, in an\r\nemergency, that power of emancipation which, in his opinion, should be\r\nretained by the States, he still avowed his hostility to slavery, and\r\nat the same time his inability to see any practicable means of ending\r\nit: \"Slavery is detested: we feel its fatal effects,--we deplore it\r\nwith all the pity of humanity.... As we ought with gratitude to admire\r\nthat decree of Heaven which has numbered us among the free, we ought\r\nto lament and deplore the necessity of holding our fellow-men in\r\nbondage. But is it practicable, by any human means, to liberate them\r\nwithout producing the most dreadful and ruinous consequences?\"[444]\r\n\r\nDuring all the years of his retirement, his great fame drew to him\r\nmany strangers, who came to pay their homage to him, to look upon his\r\nface, to listen to his words. Such guests were always received by him\r\nwith a cordiality that was unmistakable, and so modest and simple as\r\nto put them at once at their ease. Of course they desired most of all\r\nto hear him talk of his own past life, and of the great events in\r\nwhich he had borne so brilliant a part; but whenever he was persuaded\r\nto do so, it was always with the most quiet references to himself. \"No\r\nman,\" says one who knew him well, \"ever vaunted less of his\r\nachievements than Mr. H. I hardly ever heard him speak of those great\r\nachievements which form the prominent part of his biography. As for\r\nboasting, he was entirely a stranger to it, unless it be that, in his\r\nlatter days, he seemed proud of the goodness of his lands, and, I\r\nbelieve, wished to be thought wealthy. It is my opinion that he was\r\nbetter pleased to be flattered as to his wealth than as to his great\r\ntalents. This I have accounted for by recollecting that he had long\r\nbeen under narrow and difficult circumstances as to property, from\r\nwhich he was at length happily relieved; whereas there never was a\r\ntime when his talents had not always been conspicuous, though he\r\nalways seemed unconscious of them.\"[445]\r\n\r\nIt should not be supposed that, in his final withdrawal from public\r\nand professional labors, he surrendered himself to the enjoyment of\r\ndomestic happiness, without any positive occupation of the mind. From\r\none of his grandsons, who was much with him in those days, the\r\ntradition is derived that, besides \"setting a good example of honesty,\r\nbenevolence, hospitality, and every social virtue,\" he assisted \"in\r\nthe education of his younger children,\" and especially devoted much\r\ntime \"to earnest efforts to establish true Christianity in our\r\ncountry.\"[446] He gave himself more than ever to the study of the\r\nBible, as well as of two or three of the great English divines,\r\nparticularly Tillotson, Butler, and Sherlock. The sermons of the\r\nlatter, he declared, had removed \"all his doubts of the truth of\r\nChristianity;\" and from a volume which contained them, and which was\r\nfull of his pencilled notes, he was accustomed to read \"every Sunday\r\nevening to his family; after which they all joined in sacred music,\r\nwhile he accompanied them on the violin.\"[447]\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no time in his life, after his arrival at\r\nmanhood, when Patrick Henry was not regarded by his private\r\nacquaintances as a positively religious person. Moreover, while he was\r\nmost tolerant of all forms of religion, and was on peculiarly friendly\r\nterms with their ministers, to whose preaching he often listened, it\r\nis inaccurate to say, as Wirt has done, that, though he was a\r\nChristian, he was so \"after a form of his own;\" that \"he was never\r\nattached to any particular religious society, and never ... communed\r\nwith any church.\"[448] On the contrary, from a grandson who spent\r\nmany years in his household comes the tradition that \"his parents were\r\nmembers of the Protestant Episcopal Church, of which his uncle,\r\nPatrick Henry, was a minister;\" that \"he was baptized and made a\r\nmember of it in early life;\" and that \"he lived and died an exemplary\r\nmember of it.\"[449] Furthermore, in 1830, the Rev. Charles Dresser,\r\nrector of Antrim Parish, Halifax County, Virginia, wrote that the\r\nwidow of Patrick Henry told him that her husband used to receive \"the\r\ncommunion as often as an opportunity was offered, and on such\r\noccasions always fasted until after he had communicated, and spent the\r\nday in the greatest retirement. This he did both while governor and\r\nafterward.\"[450] In a letter to one of his daughters, written in 1796,\r\nhe makes this touching confession:--\r\n\r\n     \"Amongst other strange things said of me, I hear it is said\r\n     by the deists that I am one of the number; and, indeed, that\r\n     some good people think I am no Christian. This thought gives\r\n     me much more pain than the appellation of Tory; because I\r\n     think religion of infinitely higher importance than\r\n     politics; and I find much cause to reproach myself that I\r\n     have lived so long, and have given no decided and public\r\n     proofs of my being a Christian. But, indeed, my dear child,\r\n     this is a character which I prize far above all this world\r\n     has, or can boast.\"[451]\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, humbly and sorrowfully, of his religious position\r\nas a thing so little known to the public that it could be entirely\r\nmisunderstood by a portion of them, it is plain that no one who had\r\nseen him in the privacy of his life at home could have had any\r\nmisunderstanding upon that subject. For years before his retirement\r\nfrom the law, it had been his custom, we are told, to spend \"one hour\r\nevery day ... in private devotion. His hour of prayer was the close of\r\nthe day, including sunset; ... and during that sacred hour, none of\r\nhis family intruded upon his privacy.\"[452]\r\n\r\nAs regards his religious faith, Patrick Henry, while never\r\nostentatious of it, was always ready to avow it, and to defend it. The\r\nFrench alliance during our Revolution, and our close intercourse with\r\nFrance immediately afterward, hastened among us the introduction of\r\ncertain French writers who were assailants of Christianity, and who\r\nsoon set up among the younger and perhaps brighter men of the country\r\nthe fashion of casting off, as parts of an outworn and pitiful\r\nsuperstition, the religious ideas of their childhood, and even the\r\nmorality which had found its strongest sanctions in those ideas. Upon\r\nall this, Patrick Henry looked with grief and alarm. In his opinion, a\r\nfar deeper, a far wiser and nobler handling of all the immense\r\nquestions involved in the problem of the truth of Christianity was\r\nfurnished by such English writers as Sherlock and Bishop Butler, and,\r\nfor popular use, even Soame Jenyns. Therefore, as French scepticism\r\nthen had among the Virginia lawyers and politicians its diligent\r\nmissionaries, so, with the energy and directness that always\r\ncharacterized him, he determined to confront it, if possible, with an\r\nequal diligence; and he then deliberately made himself, while still a\r\nVirginia lawyer and politician, a missionary also,--a missionary on\r\nbehalf of rational and enlightened Christian faith. Thus during his\r\nsecond term as governor he caused to be printed, on his own account,\r\nan edition of Soame Jenyns's \"View of the Internal Evidence of\r\nChristianity;\" likewise, an edition of Butler's \"Analogy;\" and\r\nthenceforward, particularly among the young men of Virginia, assailed\r\nas they were by the fashionable scepticism, this illustrious\r\ncolporteur was active in the defence of Christianity, not only by his\r\nown sublime and persuasive arguments, but by the distribution, as the\r\nfit occasion offered, of one or the other of these two books.\r\n\r\nAccordingly when, during the first two years of his retirement, Thomas\r\nPaine's \"Age of Reason\" made its appearance, the old statesman was\r\nmoved to write out a somewhat elaborate treatise in defence of the\r\ntruth of Christianity. This treatise it was his purpose to have\r\npublished. \"He read the manuscript to his family as he progressed with\r\nit, and completed it a short time before his death.\" When it was\r\nfinished, however, being \"diffident about his own work,\" and\r\nimpressed, also, by the great ability of the replies to Paine which\r\nwere then appearing in England, \"he directed his wife to destroy\" what\r\nhe had written. She \"complied literally with his directions,\" and thus\r\nput beyond the chance of publication a work which seemed, to some who\r\nheard it, to be \"the most eloquent and unanswerable argument in the\r\ndefence of the Bible which was ever written.\"[453]\r\n\r\nFinally, in his last will and testament, bearing the date of November\r\n20, 1798, and written throughout, as he says, \"with my own hand,\" he\r\nchose to insert a touching affirmation of his own deep faith in\r\nChristianity. After distributing his estate among his descendants, he\r\nthus concludes: \"This is all the inheritance I can give to my dear\r\nfamily. The religion of Christ can give them one which will make them\r\nrich indeed.\"[454]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined that this deep seclusion and these eager\r\nreligious studies implied in Patrick Henry any forgetfulness of the\r\npolitical concerns of his own country, or any indifference to those\r\nmighty events which, during those years, were taking place in Europe,\r\nand were reacting with tremendous effect upon the thought, the\r\nemotion, and even the material interests of America. Neither did he\r\nsucceed in thus preserving the retirement which he had resolved upon,\r\nwithout having to resist the attempts of both political parties to\r\ndraw him forth again into official life. All these matters, indeed,\r\nare involved in the story of his political attitude from the close of\r\nhis struggle for amending the Constitution down to the very close of\r\nhis life,--a story which used to be told with angry vituperation on\r\none side, perhaps with some meek apologies on the other. Certainly,\r\nthe day for such comment is long past. In the disinterestedness which\r\nthe lapse of time has now made an easy virtue for us, we may see,\r\nplainly enough, that such ungentle words as \"apostate\" and \"turncoat,\"\r\nwith which his name used to be plentifully assaulted, were but the\r\nmissiles of partisan excitement; and that by his act of intellectual\r\nreadjustment with respect to the new conditions forced upon human\r\nsociety, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the French Revolution, he\r\ndeveloped no occasion for apologies, since he therein did nothing that\r\nwas unusual at that time among honest and thoughtful men everywhere,\r\nand nothing that was inconsistent with the professions or the\r\ntendencies of his own previous life. It becomes our duty, however, to\r\ntrace this story over again, as concisely as possible, but in the\r\nlight of much historical evidence that has never hitherto been\r\npresented in connection with it.\r\n\r\nUpon the adoption, in 1791, of the first ten amendments to the\r\nConstitution, every essential objection which he had formerly urged\r\nagainst that instrument was satisfied; and there then remained no\r\ngood reason why he should any longer hold himself aloof from the\r\ncordial support of the new government, especially as directed, first\r\nby Washington, and afterward by John Adams,--two men with whom, both\r\npersonally and politically, he had always been in great harmony,\r\nexcepting only upon this single matter of the Constitution in its\r\noriginal form. Undoubtedly, the contest which he had waged on that\r\nquestion had been so hot and so bitter that, even after it was ended,\r\nsome time would be required for his recovery from the soreness of\r\nspirit, from the tone of suspicion and even of enmity, which it had\r\noccasioned. Accordingly, in the correspondence and other records of\r\nthe time, we catch some glimpses of him, which show that even after\r\nCongress had passed the great amendments, and after their approval by\r\nthe States had become a thing assured, he still looked askance at the\r\nadministration, and particularly at some of the financial measures\r\nproposed by Hamilton.[455] Nevertheless, as year by year went on, and\r\nas Washington and his associates continued to deal fairly, wisely,\r\nand, on the whole, successfully, with the enormous problems which they\r\nencountered; moreover, as Jefferson and Madison gradually drew off\r\nfrom Washington, and formed a party in opposition, which seemed to\r\nconnive at the proceedings of Genet, and to encourage the formation\r\namong us of political clubs in apparent sympathy with the wildest and\r\nmost anarchic doctrines which were then flung into words and into\r\ndeeds in the streets of Paris, it happened that Patrick Henry found\r\nhimself, like Richard Henry Lee, and many another of his companions in\r\nthe old struggle against the Constitution, drawn more and more into\r\nsupport of the new government.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind, probably, was he in the spring of 1793, when,\r\nduring the session of the federal court at Richmond, he had frequent\r\nconversations with Chief Justice Jay and with Judge Iredell. The\r\nlatter, having never before met Henry, had felt great dislike of him\r\non account of the alleged violence of his opinions against the\r\nConstitution; but after making his acquaintance, Iredell thus wrote\r\nconcerning him: \"I never was more agreeably disappointed than in my\r\nacquaintance with him. I have been much in his company; and his\r\nmanners are very pleasing, and his mind, I am persuaded, highly\r\nliberal. It is a strong additional reason I have, added to many\r\nothers, to hold in high detestation violent party prejudice.\"[456]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, General Henry Lee, then governor of Virginia,\r\nappointed Patrick Henry as a senator of the United States, to fill out\r\nan unexpired term. This honor he felt compelled to decline.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the same year, General Lee, finding that Patrick\r\nHenry, though in virtual sympathy with the administration, was yet\r\nunder the impression that Washington had cast off their old\r\nfriendship, determined to act the part of a peacemaker between them,\r\nand, if possible, bring together once more two old friends who had\r\nbeen parted by political differences that no longer existed. On the\r\n17th of August, 1794, Lee, at Richmond, thus wrote to the President:--\r\n\r\n     \"When I saw you in Philadelphia, I had many conversations\r\n     with you respecting Mr. Henry, and since my return I have\r\n     talked very freely and confidentially with that gentleman. I\r\n     plainly perceive that he has credited some information,\r\n     which he has received (from whom I know not), which induces\r\n     him to believe that you consider him a factious, seditious\r\n     character.... Assured in my own mind that his opinions are\r\n     groundless, I have uniformly combated them, and lament that\r\n     my endeavors have been unavailing. He seems to be deeply and\r\n     sorely affected. It is very much to be regretted; for he is\r\n     a man of positive virtue as well as of transcendent talents;\r\n     and were it not for his feelings above expressed, I verily\r\n     believe, he would be found among the most active supporters\r\n     of your administration. Excuse me for mentioning this matter\r\n     to you. I have long wished to do it, in the hope that it\r\n     would lead to a refutation of the sentiments entertained by\r\n     Mr. Henry.\"[457]\r\n\r\nTo this letter Washington sent a reply which expressed unabated regard\r\nfor his old friend; and this reply, having been shown by Lee to Henry,\r\ndrew from him this noble-minded answer:--\r\n\r\n     TO GENERAL HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n                                   RED HILL, 27 June, 1795.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,--Your very friendly communication of so much of\r\n     the President's letter as relates to me, demands my sincere\r\n     thanks. Retired as I am from the busy world, it is still\r\n     grateful to me to know that some portion of regard remains\r\n     for me amongst my countrymen; especially those of them whose\r\n     opinions I most value. But the esteem of that personage, who\r\n     is contemplated in this correspondence, is highly flattering\r\n     indeed.\r\n\r\n     The American Revolution was the grand operation, which\r\n     seemed to be assigned by the Deity to the men of this age in\r\n     our country, over and above the common duties of life. I\r\n     ever prized at a high rate the superior privilege of being\r\n     one in that chosen age, to which Providence intrusted its\r\n     favorite work. With this impression, it was impossible for\r\n     me to resist the impulse I felt to contribute my mite\r\n     towards accomplishing that event, which in future will give\r\n     a superior aspect to the men of these times. To the man,\r\n     especially, who led our armies, will that aspect belong; and\r\n     it is not in nature for one with my feelings to revere the\r\n     Revolution, without including him who stood foremost in its\r\n     establishment.\r\n\r\n     Every insinuation that taught me to believe I had forfeited\r\n     the good-will of that personage, to whom the world had\r\n     agreed to ascribe the appellation of good and great, must\r\n     needs give me pain; particularly as he had opportunities of\r\n     knowing my character both in public and in private life. The\r\n     intimation now given me, that there was no ground to believe\r\n     I had incurred his censure, gives very great pleasure.\r\n\r\n     Since the adoption of the present Constitution, I have\r\n     generally moved in a narrow circle. But in that I have never\r\n     omitted to inculcate a strict adherence to the principles of\r\n     it. And I have the satisfaction to think, that in no part of\r\n     the Union have the laws been more pointedly obeyed, than in\r\n     that where I have resided and spent my time. Projects,\r\n     indeed, of a contrary tendency have been hinted to me; but\r\n     the treatment of the projectors has been such as to prevent\r\n     all intercourse with them for a long time. Although a\r\n     democrat myself, I like not the late democratic societies.\r\n     As little do I like their suppression by law. Silly things\r\n     may amuse for awhile, but in a little time men will perceive\r\n     their delusions. The way to preserve in men's minds a value\r\n     for them, is to enact laws against them.\r\n\r\n     My present views are to spend my days in privacy. If,\r\n     however, it shall please God, during my life, so to order\r\n     the course of events as to render my feeble efforts\r\n     necessary for the safety of the country, in any, even the\r\n     smallest degree, that little which I can do shall be done.\r\n     Whenever you may have an opportunity, I shall be much\r\n     obliged by your presenting my best respects and duty to the\r\n     President, assuring him of my gratitude for his favorable\r\n     sentiments towards me.\r\n\r\n     Be assured, my dear sir, of the esteem and regard with which\r\n     I am yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                          PATRICK HENRY.[458]\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this letter, Washington took an opportunity to convey to\r\nPatrick Henry a strong practical proof of his confidence in him, and\r\nof his cordial friendship. The office of secretary of state having\r\nbecome vacant, Washington thus tendered the place to Patrick Henry:--\r\n\r\n                                  MOUNT VERNON, 9 October, 1795.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--Whatever may be the reception of this letter,\r\n     truth and candor shall mark its steps. You doubtless know\r\n     that the office of state is vacant; and no one can be more\r\n     sensible than yourself of the importance of filling it with\r\n     a person of abilities, and one in whom the public would have\r\n     confidence.\r\n\r\n     It would be uncandid not to inform you that this office has\r\n     been offered to others; but it is as true, that it was from\r\n     a conviction in my own mind that you would not accept it\r\n     (until Tuesday last, in a conversation with General Lee, he\r\n     dropped sentiments which made it less doubtful), that it was\r\n     not offered first to you.\r\n\r\n     I need scarcely add, that if this appointment could be made\r\n     to comport with your own inclination, it would be as\r\n     pleasing to me, as I believe it would be acceptable to the\r\n     public. With this assurance, and with this belief, I make\r\n     you the offer of it. My first wish is that you would accept\r\n     it; the next is that you would be so good as to give me an\r\n     answer as soon as you conveniently can, as the public\r\n     business in that department is now suffering for want of a\r\n     secretary.[459]\r\n\r\nThough Patrick Henry declined this proposal, he declined it for\r\nreasons that did not shut the door against further overtures of a\r\nsimilar kind; for, within the next three months, a vacancy having\r\noccurred in another great office,--that of chief justice of the\r\nUnited States,--Washington again employed the friendly services of\r\nGeneral Lee, whom he authorized to offer the place to Patrick Henry.\r\nThis was done by Lee in a letter dated December 26, 1795:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Senate have disagreed to the President's nomination of\r\n     Mr. Rutledge, and a vacancy in that important office has\r\n     taken place. For your country's sake, for your friends'\r\n     sake, for your family's sake, tell me you will obey a call\r\n     to it. You know my friendship for you; you know my\r\n     circumspection; and, I trust, you know, too, I would not\r\n     address you on such a subject without good grounds. Surely\r\n     no situation better suits you. You continue at home, only\r\n     [except] when on duty. Change of air and exercise will add\r\n     to your days. The salary excellent, and the honor very\r\n     great. Be explicit in your reply.\"[460]\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which Lee thus wrote to Henry he likewise wrote to\r\nWashington, informing him that he had done so; but, for some cause now\r\nunknown, Washington received no further word from Lee for more than\r\ntwo weeks. Accordingly, on the 11th of January, 1796, in his anxiety\r\nto know what might be Patrick Henry's decision concerning the office\r\nof chief justice, Washington wrote to Lee as follows:--\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 26th ult. has been\r\n     received, but nothing from you since,--which is embarrassing\r\n     in the extreme; for not only the nomination of chief\r\n     justice, but an associate judge, and secretary of war, is\r\n     suspended on the answer you were to receive from Mr. Henry;\r\n     and what renders the want of it more to be regretted is,\r\n     that the first Monday of next month (which happens on the\r\n     first day of it) is the term appointed by law for the\r\n     meeting of the Superior Court of the United States, in this\r\n     city; at which, for particular reasons, the bench ought to\r\n     be full. I will add no more at present than that I am your\r\n     affectionate,\r\n\r\n                                         GEO. WASHINGTON.[461]\r\n\r\nAlthough Patrick Henry declined this great compliment also, his\r\nfriendliness to the administration had become so well understood that,\r\namong the Federal leaders, who in the spring of 1796 were planning for\r\nthe succession to Washington and Adams, there was a strong inclination\r\nto nominate Patrick Henry for the vice-presidency,--their chief doubt\r\nbeing with reference to his willingness to take the nomination.[462]\r\n\r\nAll these overtures to Patrick Henry were somewhat jealously watched\r\nby Jefferson, who, indeed, in a letter to Monroe, on the 10th of July,\r\n1796, interpreted them with that easy recklessness of statement which\r\nso frequently embellished his private correspondence and his private\r\ntalk. \"Most assiduous court,\" he says of the Federalists, \"is paid to\r\nPatrick Henry. He has been offered everything which they knew he would\r\nnot accept.\"[463]\r\n\r\nA few weeks after Jefferson penned those sneering words, the person\r\nthus alluded to wrote to his daughter, Mrs. Aylett, concerning certain\r\ntroublesome reports which had reached her:--\r\n\r\n     \"As to the reports you have heard, of my changing sides in\r\n     politics, I can only say they are not true. I am too old to\r\n     exchange my former opinions, which have grown up into fixed\r\n     habits of thinking. True it is, I have condemned the conduct\r\n     of our members in Congress, because, in refusing to raise\r\n     money for the purposes of the British treaty, they, in\r\n     effect, would have surrendered our country bound, hand and\r\n     foot, to the power of the British nation.... The treaty is,\r\n     in my opinion, a very bad one indeed. But what must I think\r\n     of those men, whom I myself warned of the danger of giving\r\n     the power of making laws by means of treaty to the President\r\n     and Senate, when I see these same men denying the existence\r\n     of that power, which, they insisted in our convention, ought\r\n     properly to be exercised by the President and Senate, and by\r\n     none other? The policy of these men, both then and now,\r\n     appears to me quite void of wisdom and foresight. These\r\n     sentiments I did mention in conversation in Richmond, and\r\n     perhaps others which I don't remember.... It seems that\r\n     every word was watched which I casually dropped, and wrested\r\n     to answer party views. Who can have been so meanly employed,\r\n     I know not, neither do I care; for I no longer consider\r\n     myself as an actor on the stage of public life. It is time\r\n     for me to retire; and I shall never more appear in a public\r\n     character, unless some unlooked-for circumstance shall\r\n     demand from me a transient effort, not inconsistent with\r\n     private life--in which I have determined to continue.\"[464]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1796 the Assembly of Virginia, then under the\r\npolitical control of Jefferson, and apparently eager to compete with\r\nthe Federalists for the possession of a great name, elected Patrick\r\nHenry to the governorship of the State. But the man whose purpose to\r\nrefuse office had been proof against the attractions of the United\r\nStates Senate, and of the highest place in Washington's cabinet, and\r\nof the highest judicial position in the country, was not likely to\r\nsuccumb to the opportunity of being governor of Virginia for the\r\nsixth time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[434] Spencer Roane, MS.\r\n\r\n[435] _Hist.

In the same manner,\r\nalso, must we pass by the year 1798,--which saw the popular uprising\r\nagainst France, the mounting of the black cockade against her, the\r\nsuspension of commercial intercourse with her, the summons to\r\nWashington to come forth once more and lead the armies of America\r\nagainst the enemy; then the moonstruck madness of the Federalists,\r\nforcing upon the country the naturalization act, the alien acts, the\r\nsedition act; then the Kentucky resolutions, as written by Jefferson,\r\ndeclaring the acts just named to be \"not law, but utterly void and of\r\nno force,\" and liable, \"unless arrested on the threshold,\" \"to drive\r\nthese States into revolution and blood;\" then the Virginia\r\nresolutions, as written by Madison, denouncing the same acts as\r\n\"palpable and alarming infractions of the Constitution;\" finally, the\r\npreparations secretly making by the government of Virginia[465] for\r\narmed resistance to the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nJust seven days after the passage of the Virginia resolutions, an\r\neminent citizen of that State appealed by letter to Patrick Henry for\r\nsome written expression of his views upon the troubled situation, with\r\nthe immediate object of aiding in the election of John Marshall, who,\r\nhaving just before returned from his baffled embassy to Paris, was\r\nthen in nomination for Congress, and was encountering assaults\r\ndirected by every energy and art of the opposition. In response to\r\nthis appeal, Patrick Henry wrote, in the early part of the year 1799,\r\nthe following remarkable letter, which is of deep interest still, not\r\nonly as showing his discernment of the true nature of that crisis, but\r\nas furnishing a complete answer to the taunt that his mental\r\nfaculties were then fallen into decay:--\r\n\r\n     TO ARCHIBALD BLAIR.\r\n\r\n                               RED HILL, CHARLOTTE, 8 January, 1799.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 28th of last month I have\r\n     received. Its contents are a fresh proof that there is cause\r\n     for much lamentation over the present state of things in\r\n     Virginia. It is possible that most of the individuals who\r\n     compose the contending factions are sincere, and act from\r\n     honest motives. But it is more than probable, that certain\r\n     leaders meditate a change in government. To effect this, I\r\n     see no way so practicable as dissolving the confederacy. And\r\n     I am free to own, that, in my judgment, most of the measures\r\n     lately pursued by the opposition party, directly and\r\n     certainly lead to that end. If this is not the system of the\r\n     party, they have none, and act 'ex tempore.'\r\n\r\n     I do acknowledge that I am not capable to form a correct\r\n     judgment on the present politics of the world. The wide\r\n     extent to which the present contentions have gone will\r\n     scarcely permit any observer to see enough in detail to\r\n     enable him to form anything like a tolerable judgment on the\r\n     final result, as it may respect the nations in general. But,\r\n     as to France, I have no doubt in saying that to her it will\r\n     be calamitous. Her conduct has made it the interest of the\r\n     great family of mankind to wish the downfall of her present\r\n     government; because its existence is incompatible with that\r\n     of all others within its reach. And, whilst I see the\r\n     dangers that threaten ours from her intrigues and her arms,\r\n     I am not so much alarmed as at the apprehension of her\r\n     destroying the great pillars of all government and of social\r\n     life,--I mean virtue, morality, and religion. This is the\r\n     armor, my friend, and this alone, that renders us\r\n     invincible. These are the tactics we should study. If we\r\n     lose these, we are conquered, fallen indeed. In vain may\r\n     France show and vaunt her diplomatic skill, and brave\r\n     troops: so long as our manners and principles remain sound,\r\n     there is no danger. But believing, as I do, that these are\r\n     in danger, that infidelity in its broadest sense, under the\r\n     name of philosophy, is fast spreading, and that, under the\r\n     patronage of French manners and principles, everything that\r\n     ought to be dear to man is covertly but successfully\r\n     assailed, I feel the value of those men amongst us, who hold\r\n     out to the world the idea, that our continent is to exhibit\r\n     an originality of character; and that, instead of that\r\n     imitation and inferiority which the countries of the old\r\n     world have been in the habit of exacting from the new, we\r\n     shall maintain that high ground upon which nature has placed\r\n     us, and that Europe will alike cease to rule us and give us\r\n     modes of thinking.\r\n\r\n     But I must stop short, or else this letter will be all\r\n     preface. These prefatory remarks, however, I thought proper\r\n     to make, as they point out the kind of character amongst our\r\n     countrymen most estimable in my eyes. General Marshall and\r\n     his colleagues exhibited the American character as\r\n     respectable. France, in the period of her most triumphant\r\n     fortune, beheld them as unappalled. Her threats left them,\r\n     as she found them, mild, temperate, firm. Can it be thought\r\n     that, with these sentiments, I should utter anything tending\r\n     to prejudice General Marshall's election? Very far from it\r\n     indeed. Independently of the high gratification I felt from\r\n     his public ministry, he ever stood high in my esteem as a\r\n     private citizen. His temper and disposition were always\r\n     pleasant, his talents and integrity unquestioned. These\r\n     things are sufficient to place that gentleman far above any\r\n     competitor in the district for Congress. But, when you add\r\n     the particular information and insight which he has gained,\r\n     and is able to communicate to our public councils, it is\r\n     really astonishing that even blindness itself should\r\n     hesitate in the choice.... Tell Marshall I love him, because\r\n     he felt and acted as a republican, as an American.... I am\r\n     too old and infirm ever again to undertake public concerns.\r\n     I live much retired, amidst a multiplicity of blessings from\r\n     that Gracious Ruler of all things, to whom I owe unceasing\r\n     acknowledgments for his unmerited goodness to me; and if I\r\n     was permitted to add to the catalogue one other blessing, it\r\n     should be, that my countrymen should learn wisdom and\r\n     virtue, and in this their day to know the things that\r\n     pertain to their peace. Farewell.\r\n\r\n                         I am, dear Sir, yours,\r\n                                          PATRICK HENRY.[466]\r\n\r\nThe appeal from Archibald Blair, which evoked this impressive letter,\r\nhad suggested to the old statesman no effort which could not be made\r\nin his retirement. Before, however, he was to pass beyond the reach of\r\nall human appeals, two others were to be addressed to him, the one by\r\nJohn Adams, the other by Washington, both asking him to come forth\r\ninto the world again; the former calling for his help in averting war\r\nwith France, the latter for his help in averting the triumph of\r\nviolent and dangerous counsels at home.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of February, 1799, John Adams, shaking himself free of\r\nhis partisan counsellors,--all hot for war with France,--suddenly\r\nchanged the course of history by sending to the Senate the names of\r\nthese three citizens, Oliver Ellsworth, Patrick Henry, and William\r\nVans Murray, \"to be envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary\r\nto the French republic, with full powers to discuss and settle, by a\r\ntreaty, all controversies between the United States and France.\" In\r\nhis letter of the 16th of April declining the appointment, Patrick\r\nHenry spoke of himself as having been \"confined for several weeks by a\r\nsevere indisposition,\" and as being \"still so sick as to be scarcely\r\nable to write this.\" \"My advanced age,\" he added, \"and increasing\r\ndebility compel me to abandon every idea of serving my country, where\r\nthe scene of operation is far distant, and her interests call for\r\nincessant and long continued exertion.... I cannot, however, forbear\r\nexpressing, on this occasion, the high sense I entertain of the honor\r\ndone me by the President and Senate in the appointment. And I beg you,\r\nsir, to present me to them in terms of the most dutiful regard,\r\nassuring them that this mark of their confidence in me, at a crisis so\r\neventful, is an agreeable and flattering proof of their consideration\r\ntowards me, and that nothing short of an absolute necessity could\r\ninduce me to withhold my little aid from an administration whose\r\nability, patriotism, and virtue deserve the gratitude and reverence of\r\nall their fellow citizens.\"[467]\r\n\r\nSuch was John Adams's appeal to Patrick Henry and its result. The\r\nappeal to him from Washington--an appeal which he could not resist,\r\nand which induced him, even in his extreme feebleness of body, to make\r\none last and noble exertion of his genius--happened in this wise. On\r\nthe 15th of January, 1799, from Mount Vernon, Washington wrote to his\r\nfriend a long letter, marked \"confidential,\" in which he stated with\r\ngreat frankness his own anxieties respecting the dangers then\r\nthreatening the country:--\r\n\r\n     \"It would be a waste of time to attempt to bring to the view\r\n     of a person of your observation and discernment, the\r\n     endeavors of a certain party among us to disquiet the public\r\n     mind with unfounded alarms; to arraign every act of the\r\n     administration; to set the people at variance with their\r\n     government; and to embarrass all its measures. Equally\r\n     useless would it be to predict what must be the inevitable\r\n     consequences of such a policy, if it cannot be arrested.\r\n\r\n     \"Unfortunately,--and extremely do I regret it,--the State of\r\n     Virginia has taken the lead in this opposition.... It has\r\n     been said that the great mass of the citizens of this State\r\n     are well-affected, notwithstanding, to the general\r\n     government and the Union; and I am willing to believe it,\r\n     nay, do believe it. But how is this to be reconciled with\r\n     their suffrages at the elections of representatives, ... who\r\n     are men opposed to the former, and by the tendency of their\r\n     measures would destroy the latter?... One of the reasons\r\n     assigned is, that the most respectable and best qualified\r\n     characters among us will not come forward.... But, at such a\r\n     crisis as this, when everything dear and valuable to us is\r\n     assailed; when this party hangs upon the wheels of\r\n     government as a dead weight, opposing every measure that is\r\n     calculated for defence and self-preservation, abetting the\r\n     nefarious views of another nation upon our rights; ... when\r\n     measures are systematically and pertinaciously pursued,\r\n     which must eventually dissolve the Union, or produce\r\n     coercion; I say, when these things have become so obvious,\r\n     ought characters who are best able to rescue their country\r\n     from the pending evil, to remain at home? Rather ought they\r\n     not to come forward, and by their talents and influence\r\n     stand in the breach which such conduct has made on the peace\r\n     and happiness of this country, and oppose the widening of\r\n     it?...\r\n\r\n     \"I come, now, my good Sir, to the object of my letter, which\r\n     is to express a hope and an earnest wish, that you will come\r\n     forward at the ensuing elections (if not for Congress, which\r\n     you may think would take you too long from home), as a\r\n     candidate for representative in the General Assembly of this\r\n     Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     \"There are, I have no doubt, very many sensible men who\r\n     oppose themselves to the torrent that carries away others\r\n     who had rather swim with, than stem it without an able pilot\r\n     to conduct them; but these are neither old in legislation,\r\n     nor well known in the community. Your weight of character\r\n     and influence in the House of Representatives would be a\r\n     bulwark against such dangerous sentiments as are delivered\r\n     there at present. It would be a rallying point for the\r\n     timid, and an attraction of the wavering. In a word, I\r\n     conceive it to be of immense importance at this crisis, that\r\n     you should be there; and I would fain hope that all minor\r\n     considerations will be made to yield to the measure.\"[468]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that it was this solemn invocation on the\r\npart of Washington which induced the old statesman, on whom Death had\r\nalready begun to lay his icy hands, to come forth from the solitude in\r\nwhich he had been so long buried, and offer himself for the suffrages\r\nof his neighbors, as their representative in the next House of\r\nDelegates, there to give check, if possible, to the men who seemed to\r\nbe hurrying Virginia upon violent courses, and the republic into civil\r\nwar. Accordingly, before the day for the usual March[469] court in\r\nCharlotte, the word went out through all that country that old Patrick\r\nHenry, whose wondrous voice in public no man had heard for those many\r\nyears, who had indeed been almost numbered among the dead ones of\r\ntheir heroic days foregone, was to appear before all the people once\r\nmore, and speak to them as in the former time, and give to them his\r\ncounsel amid those thickening dangers which alone could have drawn him\r\nforth from the very borders of the grave.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning of that day came, from all the region thereabout the\r\npeople began to stream toward the place where the orator was to speak.\r\nSo widespread was the desire to hear him that even the college in the\r\nnext county--the college of Hampden-Sidney--suspended its work for\r\nthat day, and thus enabled all its members, the president himself, the\r\nprofessors, and the students, to hurry over to Charlotte court-house.\r\nOne of those students, John Miller, of South Carolina, according to an\r\naccount said to have been given by him in conversation forty years\r\nafterward, having with his companions reached the town,--\r\n\r\n     \"and having learned that the great orator would speak in the\r\n     porch of a tavern fronting the large court-green, ... pushed\r\n     his way through the gathering crowd, and secured the\r\n     pedestal of a pillar, where he stood within eight feet of\r\n     him. He was very infirm, and seated in a chair conversing\r\n     with some old friends, waiting for the assembling of the\r\n     immense multitudes who were pouring in from all the\r\n     surrounding country to hear him. At length he arose with\r\n     difficulty, and stood somewhat bowed with age and weakness.\r\n     His face was almost colorless. His countenance was careworn;\r\n     and when he commenced his exordium, his voice was slightly\r\n     cracked and tremulous. But in a few moments a wonderful\r\n     transformation of the whole man occurred, as he warmed with\r\n     his theme. He stood erect; his eye beamed with a light that\r\n     was almost supernatural; his features glowed with the hue\r\n     and fire of youth; and his voice rang clear and melodious\r\n     with the intonations of some grand musical instrument whose\r\n     notes filled the area, and fell distinctly and delightfully\r\n     upon the ears of the most distant of the thousands gathered\r\n     before him.\"[470]\r\n\r\nAs regards the substance of the speech then made, it will not be safe\r\nfor us to confide very much in the supposed recollections of old men\r\nwho heard it when they were young. Upon the whole, probably, the most\r\ntrustworthy outline of it now to be had is that of a gentleman who\r\ndeclares that he wrote down his recollections of the speech not long\r\nafter its delivery. According to this account, Patrick Henry--\r\n\r\n     \"told them that the late proceedings of the Virginian\r\n     Assembly had filled him with apprehensions and alarm; that\r\n     they had planted thorns upon his pillow; that they had drawn\r\n     him from that happy retirement which it had pleased a\r\n     bountiful Providence to bestow, and in which he had hoped to\r\n     pass, in quiet, the remainder of his days; that the State\r\n     had quitted the sphere in which she had been placed by the\r\n     Constitution, and, in daring to pronounce upon the validity\r\n     of federal laws, had gone out of her jurisdiction in a\r\n     manner not warranted by any authority, and in the highest\r\n     degree alarming to every considerate man; that such\r\n     opposition, on the part of Virginia, to the acts of the\r\n     general government, must beget their enforcement by military\r\n     power; that this would probably produce civil war, civil war\r\n     foreign alliances, and that foreign alliances must\r\n     necessarily end in subjugation to the powers called in. He\r\n     conjured the people to pause and consider well, before they\r\n     rushed into such a desperate condition, from which there\r\n     could be no retreat. He painted to their imaginations\r\n     Washington, at the head of a numerous and well-appointed\r\n     army, inflicting upon them military execution. 'And where,'\r\n     he asked, 'are our resources to meet such a conflict? Where\r\n     is the citizen of America who will dare to lift his hand\r\n     against the father of his country?' A drunken man in the\r\n     crowd threw up his arm, and exclaimed that he dared to do\r\n     it. 'No,' answered Mr. Henry, rising aloft in all his\r\n     majesty, 'you dare not do it: in such a parricidal attempt,\r\n     the steel would drop from your nerveless arm!' ... Mr.\r\n     Henry, proceeding in his address to the people, asked\r\n     whether the county of Charlotte would have any authority to\r\n     dispute an obedience to the laws of Virginia; and he\r\n     pronounced Virginia to be to the Union what the county of\r\n     Charlotte was to her. Having denied the right of a State to\r\n     decide upon the constitutionality of federal laws, he added,\r\n     that perhaps it might be necessary to say something of the\r\n     merits of the laws in question.[471] His private opinion was\r\n     that they were good and proper. But whatever might be their\r\n     merits, it belonged to the people, who held the reins over\r\n     the head of Congress, and to them alone, to say whether they\r\n     were acceptable or otherwise to Virginians; and that this\r\n     must be done by way of petition; that Congress were as much\r\n     our representatives as the Assembly, and had as good a right\r\n     to our confidence. He had seen with regret the unlimited\r\n     power over the purse and sword consigned to the general\r\n     government; but ... he had been overruled, and it was now\r\n     necessary to submit to the constitutional exercise of that\r\n     power. 'If,' said he, 'I am asked what is to be done, when a\r\n     people feel themselves intolerably oppressed, my answer is\r\n     ready,--Overturn the government. But do not, I beseech you,\r\n     carry matters to this length without provocation. Wait at\r\n     least until some infringement is made upon your rights, and\r\n     which cannot otherwise be redressed; for if ever you recur\r\n     to another change, you may bid adieu forever to\r\n     representative government. You can never exchange the\r\n     present government but for a monarchy.... Let us preserve\r\n     our strength for the French, the English, the Germans, or\r\n     whoever else shall dare to invade our territory, and not\r\n     exhaust it in civil commotions and intestine wars.' He\r\n     concluded by declaring his design to exert himself in the\r\n     endeavor to allay the heart-burnings and jealousies which\r\n     had been fomented in the state legislature; and he fervently\r\n     prayed, if he was deemed unworthy to effect it, that it\r\n     might be reserved to some other and abler hand to extend\r\n     this blessing over the community.\"[472]\r\n\r\nThe outline thus given may be inaccurate in several particulars: it is\r\nknown to be so in one. Respecting the alien and sedition acts, the\r\norator expressed no opinion at all;[473] but accepting them as the law\r\nof the land, he counselled moderation, forbearance, and the use of\r\nconstitutional means of redress. Than that whole effort, as has been\r\nsaid by a recent and a sagacious historian, \"nothing in his life was\r\nnobler.\"[474]\r\n\r\nUpon the conclusion of the old man's speech the stand was taken by a\r\nvery young man, John Randolph of Roanoke, who undertook to address the\r\ncrowd, offering himself to them as a candidate for Congress, but on\r\nbehalf of the party then opposed to Patrick Henry. By reason of\r\nweariness, no doubt, the latter did not remain upon the platform; but\r\nhaving \"requested a friend to report to him anything which might\r\nrequire an answer,\" he stepped back into the tavern. \"Randolph began\r\nby saying that he had admired that man more than any on whom the sun\r\nhad shone, but that now he was constrained to differ from him '_toto\r\ncoelo_.'\" Whatever else Randolph may have said in his speech, whether\r\nimportant or otherwise, was spoken under the disadvantage of a cold\r\nand a hoarseness so severe as to render him scarcely able to \"utter an\r\naudible sentence.\" Furthermore, Patrick Henry \"made no reply, nor did\r\nhe again present himself to the people.\"[475] There is, however, a\r\ntradition, not improbable, that when Randolph had finished his speech,\r\nand had come back into the room where the aged statesman was resting,\r\nthe latter, taking him gently by the hand, said to him, with great\r\nkindness: \"Young man, you call me father. Then, my son, I have\r\nsomething to say unto thee: keep justice, keep truth,--and you will\r\nlive to think differently.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of the poll, Patrick Henry was, by a great majority,\r\nelected to the House of Delegates. But his political enemies, who, for\r\nsufficient reasons, greatly dreaded his appearance upon that scene of\r\nhis ancient domination, were never any more to be embarrassed by his\r\npresence there. For, truly, they who, on that March day, at Charlotte\r\ncourt-house, had heard Patrick Henry, \"had heard an immortal orator\r\nwho would never speak again.\"[476] He seems to have gone thence to his\r\nhome, and never to have left it. About the middle of the next month,\r\nbeing too sick to write many words, he lifted himself up in bed long\r\nenough to tell the secretary of state that he could not go on the\r\nmission to France, and to send his dying blessing to his old friend,\r\nthe President. Early in June, his eldest daughter, Martha Fontaine,\r\nliving at a distance of two days' travel from Red Hill, received from\r\nhim a letter beginning with these words: \"Dear Patsy, I am very\r\nunwell, and have Dr. Cabell with me.\"[477] Upon this alarming news,\r\nshe and others of his kindred in that neighborhood made all haste to\r\ngo to him. On arriving at Red Hill \"they found him sitting in a large,\r\nold-fashioned armchair, in which he was easier than upon a bed.\" The\r\ndisease of which he was dying was intussusception. On the 6th of June,\r\nall other remedies having failed, Dr. Cabell proceeded to administer\r\nto him a dose of liquid mercury. Taking the vial in his hand, and\r\nlooking at it for a moment, the dying man said: \"I suppose, doctor,\r\nthis is your last resort?\" The doctor replied: \"I am sorry to say,\r\ngovernor, that it is. Acute inflammation of the intestine has already\r\ntaken place; and unless it is removed, mortification will ensue, if it\r\nhas not already commenced, which I fear.\" \"What will be the effect of\r\nthis medicine?\" said the old man. \"It will give you immediate relief,\r\nor\"--the kind-hearted doctor could not finish the sentence. His\r\npatient took up the word: \"You mean, doctor, that it will give relief,\r\nor will prove fatal immediately?\" The doctor answered: \"You can only\r\nlive a very short time without it, and it may possibly relieve you.\"\r\nThen Patrick Henry said, \"Excuse me, doctor, for a few minutes;\" and\r\ndrawing down over his eyes a silken cap which he usually wore, and\r\nstill holding the vial in his hand, he prayed, in clear words, a\r\nsimple childlike prayer, for his family, for his country, and for his\r\nown soul then in the presence of death. Afterward, in perfect\r\ncalmness, he swallowed the medicine. Meanwhile, Dr. Cabell, who\r\ngreatly loved him, went out upon the lawn, and in his grief threw\r\nhimself down upon the earth under one of the trees, weeping bitterly.\r\nSoon, when he had sufficiently mastered himself, the doctor came back\r\nto his patient, whom he found calmly watching the congealing of the\r\nblood under his finger-nails, and speaking words of love and peace to\r\nhis family, who were weeping around his chair. Among other things, he\r\ntold them that he was thankful for that goodness of God, which, having\r\nblessed him through all his life, was then permitting him to die\r\nwithout any pain. Finally, fixing his eyes with much tenderness on his\r\ndear friend, Dr. Cabell, with whom he had formerly held many arguments\r\nrespecting the Christian religion, he asked the doctor to observe how\r\ngreat a reality and benefit that religion was to a man about to die.\r\nAnd after Patrick Henry had spoken to his beloved physician these few\r\nwords in praise of something which, having never failed him in all his\r\nlife before, did not then fail him in his very last need of it, he\r\ncontinued to breathe very softly for some moments; after which they\r\nwho were looking upon him saw that his life had departed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[465] Henry Adams, _Life of J.
