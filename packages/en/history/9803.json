It was, and still is, very commonly believed that in\r\nhis youth Louis Napoleon had been affiliated to one or other of the secret\r\nsocieties of Italy, that he was still pledged to this, was bound to obey\r\nits orders, and that Orsini was an agent to remind him that the attainment\r\nof high rank, far from releasing him from the bond, rendered it more\r\nstringent, as giving him greater power and facility for carrying out the\r\norders he received. The independence of Italy was aimed at; and it had\r\nbeen intimated to the Emperor that Orsini's was only the first of similar\r\nmessages which, if action was not taken, would be followed by a second,\r\nwith greater care to ensure its delivery.\r\n\r\nAll this may or may not have been mere gossip. What is certain is that,\r\nduring the latter months of 1858, secret negotiations had been going on\r\nbetween the Emperor and Victor Emanuel, the King of Sardinia, or rather his\r\nminister, Cavour; and that an agreement had been come to that Austria was\r\nto be attacked and driven out of Italy. Accordingly, on January 1st, 1859,\r\nat his New Year's reception of the foreign ministers, Louis Napoleon took\r\nthe opportunity of addressing some remarks to the Austrian Ambassador\r\nwhich, to France and to all Europe, appeared threatening.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at Turin, it was allowed to appear that war was intended; and on\r\nboth sides preparations were hurried on. In France, as in Austria, these\r\nwere on a very extensive scale. A large fleet of transports was collected\r\nat Marseilles; troops were massed on the frontier of Savoy; and, on the\r\npart of the Austrians, 200,000 men were assembled in readiness for action.\r\nOn April 23rd Francis Joseph, without--it was said--the knowledge of his\r\nresponsible ministers, sent an ultimatum to Turin, requiring an answer\r\nwithin three days: at the expiration of that time the Austrians would cross\r\nthe frontier. The allies utilised the delay to complete their preparations;\r\nand before the three days had ended the advance of the Franco-Sardinian\r\narmy had begun.\r\n\r\nThe campaign proved disastrous to the Austrians, whose half-drilled and\r\nbadly-fed troops and obsolete artillery were commanded by an utterly\r\nincompetent general. They were defeated at Palestro on May 31st; at Magenta\r\non June 4th; and again at Solferino on June 24th. Nothing, it appeared to\r\nthe Italians and the lookers-on, could prevent the successful and decisive\r\nissue; the Austrians would be compelled to quit Italy. Suddenly Louis\r\nNapoleon announced that he had come to an agreement with the Emperor of\r\nAustria and that peace was agreed on. The disappointment and rage of the\r\nItalians were very great; but, as Louis Napoleon was resolved, and as\r\nVictor Emanuel could not continue the war without his assistance, he was\r\nobliged to consent, and peace was concluded at Villafranca on July 11th.\r\n\r\nFor the next eighteen months much of the correspondence refers to the\r\ninception and result of this short war, mixed, of course, with more\r\npersonal matters, and at the beginning, with news as to the state of\r\nTocqueville's health, which was giving his friends the liveliest anxiety.\r\nThe Journal for the year opens with:--\r\n\r\n_January 6th_.--We went to Bowood. It was the first time Christine went\r\nthere. The party consisted of the Flahaults, Cheneys, Strzelecki, the\r\nClarendons, Twisletons,[Footnote: The Hon. Edward Twisleton, chief\r\ncommissioner of the poor laws in Ireland. He married, in 1852, Ellen,\r\ndaughter of the Hon. Edward Dwight, of Massachusetts, U.S.A.; and died, at\r\nthe age of sixty-five, in 1874.] and Leslies. What agreeable people! For a\r\nwonder we shot there on the 10th, and killed 140 head.\r\n\r\n_January 12th_.--We had a dinner at home--Trevelyan, just appointed\r\ngovernor of Madras, Phinn, Baron Martin, Huddleston, W. Harcourt, Merivale,\r\nand Henry Brougham.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, January 3rd_.--I grieve to say Tocqueville has been worse. His\r\ndoctor dined here t'other day and T.'s brother came for him at ten o'clock.\r\nI have as bad an opinion of the case as possible.\r\n\r\n_Cannes, January 9th_. The Italian affair is very naturally cause of\r\nanxiety, but I feel assured this, for the present, will pass away. I find\r\nthere is a strong feeling getting up of the Austrian army being as good as\r\nthe finances are bad, but the French finances are not likely to be very\r\nmuch better. However, though the present alarm will pass away, what a sad\r\nthing for the peace of the world to depend, not on the general opinion\r\nand feeling, but on the caprice, or the jobbing, or the blunders of a\r\nfew individuals! Who can be quite sure that Morny's stockjobbing has had\r\nnothing to do with the late most silly conversation? [Footnote: Presumably,\r\nthe sinister remark addressed to the Austrian Ambassador on New Year's\r\nDay.] L. N. himself is quite clear of all such blame. He tries all he can\r\nto prevent M. and others from their pillaging, but he never can succeed.\r\nHowever, it is to the risk of more blunders that I look as placing peace in\r\ngreatest jeopardy. I don't believe L. N. or any one of them would, _if they\r\nknew it_, run the risk of a general war (and the least war means a general\r\nwar); but they may any day get into a scrape without intending it, for they\r\nhave not the security of free discussion to warn them.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Hatherton_\r\n\r\n_Teddesley, January 12th_.--Do me the kindness to write me one line to tell\r\nme what you know of the state of M. de Tocqueville. Is it dangerous? There\r\nis no man out of this kingdom who possesses so much of my admiration and\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nThis general lull after the late Reform agitation is very natural. There\r\nare four parties waiting each other's moves; three, at least, exclusive of\r\nBright's, which is the least. There are the present Government, the late\r\nGovernment, and the country--which, as I read it, has little in common with\r\nany of them, but is at present without a leader. Any very powerful man, who\r\nhad been living by, would now have had a great field before him.\r\n\r\nI attended the day before yesterday a very remarkable meeting of the\r\nBirmingham and Midland Institute at Birmingham. Lord Ward [Footnote:\r\nCreated Earl of Dudley in 1860.] in the chair. The report, and all the\r\nofficials and speakers, especially those from the town, complained of the\r\nindifference of the artisans, mechanics, and labourers of that town to\r\ninstruction and education generally. It seems, on the showing of Bright's\r\nfriends, that these fellows, the noisiest of their class about Reform, are\r\nthe most ignorant and the least desirous of improving themselves. Such is\r\nthe report of Bright's own friends. Mr. Ryland, the vice-president and\r\nreal manager of the institution, who is also Bright's friend there, is the\r\nloudest in his complaints of this body. Ryland further told me that\r\nhe believed there was not a workman in the town who, if consulted\r\nindividually, would express his approval of all Bright's principles. Mr.\r\nRyland is a solicitor.\r\n\r\nI am all anxiety to see your January number.\r\n\r\n_To the Marquis of Lansdowne_\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate, January 25th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lord Lansdowne,--I have omitted, but not from forgetfulness, to\r\nexpress to you the very high gratification Mrs. Reeve and myself derived\r\nfrom your most kind reception of us at Bowood, and I am sure we shall\r\nalways retain the liveliest recollection of this most agreeable visit. But,\r\nin truth, I waited till something should occur which might have the good\r\nfortune to interest you, and I think the accounts I continue to receive\r\nfrom France, on the present threatening aspect of affairs, may be of that\r\nnature. M. Guizot says to me, in a letter of the 23rd inst.:--\r\n\r\n'Jusqu'à ces jours derniers je n'y voulais pas croire. J'essaye encore d'en\r\ndouter; mais c'est difficile. Ce sera un exemple de plus des guerres faites\r\npar embarras de ne pas les faire bien plus que par volonté de les faire.\r\nJe suis porté à croire que l'Empereur Napoléon serait charmé de ne plus\r\nentendre parler de l'Italie; mais pour cela il faudrait qu'il n'y eût plus\r\nd'assassins italiens, plus de Roi de Sardaigne, plus de cousins à marier,\r\nplus de brouillons révolutionnaires à contenter. Aujourd'hui, et malgré\r\ntoutes les paroles contraires, il me paraît probable que ces causes de\r\nguerre prévaudront sur la modération naturelle, sur le goût du repos\r\nvoluptueux, sur l'avis des conseillers officiels, et sur le sentiment\r\névident du public. Que fera l'Allemagne? Le tiendra-t-elle unie? Là est la\r\nquestion. L'Angleterre y peut certainement beaucoup. Je ne vois plus que là\r\nune chance pour le maintien de la paix.'\r\n\r\nThese words are so remarkable, coming from a man whose disposition is ever\r\nso much more sanguine than desponding, that I have quoted them at length.\r\n\r\nWe have all been greatly touched by the close of Mr. Hallam's most\r\nhonourable, useful, and I may say illustrious life. [Footnote: He died on\r\nJanuary 21st, 1859.] It so chanced that my sister-in-law, Helen Richardson,\r\nwho has been to him a second daughter for the last few years, came up from\r\nScotland on Thursday [January 20th]. On Friday she went down with Mrs.\r\nCator to see him. He perfectly knew her, and seemed charmed to see her\r\nagain; but before she left his bed-side the light flickered in the socket,\r\nand he expired a short time afterwards in their presence, conscious and\r\nwithout pain to the last. I thought the notice of him in the 'Times' of\r\nMonday very pleasing, and was inclined to attribute it to David Dundas, but\r\nI know not whether I am right....\r\n\r\nI remain always\r\n\r\nYour obliged and faithful\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 26th_.--I am much obliged to you for M. Guizot's\r\nletter, [Footnote: Apparently that of January 23rd, quoted in the previous\r\nletter to Lord Lansdowne.] which Miladi and I have read with interest, as\r\none always does everything he writes. I showed it to G. Lewis and C. C. G.,\r\nfeeling sure you would have no objection. It is impossible not to agree in\r\nhis gloomy view of things. It must be owned that the position the Emperor\r\nhas made for himself is one of extreme difficulty. His _idée dominante_\r\nhas been how to pacify Italian conspirators by bringing away his army\r\nfrom Rome, without having the Pope's throat cut or letting in an Austrian\r\ngarrison there; and he determined that driving the Austrians out of Italy\r\nwas the indispensable preliminary step. He was urged to do this and to\r\nthink it easy both by Russia and Sardinia; and we may be sure that the\r\nSardinians would not have committed themselves as they have done, and\r\nincurred such inconvenient expense, if they had not received promises of\r\nactive support. How would it be possible then for L. N. to recede? Cavour\r\nwould show him up, and fresh daggers and grenades would be prepared for\r\nhim. I look upon war, therefore, as certain. We have only to hope that\r\nAustria may continue to act prudently, and not furnish the cause of quarrel\r\nwhich her enemies are looking for, and which might turn against her those\r\nwho, for decency's sake, wish to remain neutral; and next, that Germany may\r\nbe united by a sense of common danger. This may tend to limit the area of\r\nthe war; but altogether it is a deplorable _gâchis_, out of which L. N. can\r\nno more see his way than anyone else.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, January 26th_.--I must throw myself and the cause of law amendment\r\non your kindness, under a great evil which has befallen us. The 'Quarterly\r\nReview,' under Mr. Elwin, was so favourably disposed to law reform as to\r\nresolve upon inserting a full discussion of the subject on the occasion\r\nof Sir E. Wilmot's volume on my 'Acts and Bills;' and Bellenden Ker had\r\nundertaken it, and was, as a law reformer and as, under Cranworth, in\r\noffice as consolidation commissioner, certainly well qualified to do\r\nthe article. But he made such a mess of it; in fact, treating Eldon,\r\nEllenborough, &c., and other obstacles to law reform not introductory, but,\r\nas I understand, making a whole article upon that. The consequence has been\r\nthat the whole has failed, and this most valuable opportunity been lost of\r\nhaving the Tory journal's adhesion to law reform now. It is barely possible\r\nthey may take it up hereafter. But surely the natural place for this\r\nstatement is the 'Edinburgh Review,' and I should feel great comfort for\r\nthe good cause if I thought you would thus help us. The matter in Sir E.'s\r\nbook renders it very easy to show what has been done of late years.\r\n\r\nPoor Tocqueville is one day a little better, another a little worse; but I\r\nhave little or no hope of his getting through it.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Lord Brougham made a flying visit to London. A note in\r\nthe Journal is:--\r\n\r\n_February 26th_.--I dined at Lord Brougham's, and met Dr. Lushington, Lord\r\nGlenelg, Lord Broughton; all--with our host--over 80.\r\n\r\nBut the state of Tocqueville's health continued, for Reeve, the most\r\nengrossing personal consideration, and just at this time the deadly malady\r\ntook a favourable though delusive turn. Tocqueville--says M. de Beaumont\r\n[Footnote: Gustave de Beaumont: _Oeuvres et Correspondance inédites\r\nd'Alexis de Tocqueville_ (1861), tome i. p. 116.]--hoped for the best.\r\n'How could he do otherwise when all around him was bursting into life? and\r\nso he kept on his regular habits, his schemes, his work. He read, and\r\nwas read to; he wrote a great many letters, and devoured those which he\r\nreceived in great numbers. There was not one of his friends who did not\r\nreceive at least one letter from him during the last month of his life.'\r\nThe following is his last letter to Reeve. The writing is painfully bad,\r\nthe letters often half formed, or crowded one on top of another; even the\r\northography is imperfect; but the words and ideas flow in full volume.\r\n\r\nCannes. le 25 février.\r\n\r\nCher Reeve,--Il y a un siècle que je ne vous ai écrit. Je n'étais pas libre\r\nde le faire. Le mois de janvier tout entier s'est passé au milieu de la\r\ncrise la plus douloureuse. Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait aucun mois de ma\r\nvie qui mérite mieux que celui-là d'être marqué d'une croix noire dans\r\nl'histoire de mon existence privée. Jetons dans l'oubli, s'il est possible,\r\ndes jours et surtout des nuits si cruels, et bornons-nous à demander à Dieu\r\nde n'envoyer rien de semblable désormais, soit à moi, soit à mes amis.\r\nDepuis trois semaines j'occupe février à réparer les méfaits de janvier. Je\r\nvais aussi bien que possible: mes forces sont en grande partie revenues.\r\nLes bronches semblent en voie de guérison rapide. Ainsi n'en parlons plus.\r\n\r\nI have just been reading an excellent article on the Catacombs, in the\r\n'Edinburgh Review.' It is a subject which has always interested me, but\r\nvery likely I should not have begun with this particular article if I had\r\nnot known it was by you. Circourt wrote to me about it, and so deprived me\r\nof the pleasure of finding it out for myself, which I think I could have\r\ndone. But, in any case, the article is exceedingly interesting ... Though I\r\nhave been enjoying myself in following you underground, what is now going\r\non on the earth's surface calls for close attention. I am here hard by one\r\nof the old military roads which have led into Italy from time immemorial,\r\nas at this day. I hear that great preparations are being made all along\r\nthe valley of the Rhone and the neighbouring country. What I am sure of,\r\nbecause it is taking place under my very eyes, is, that the railway from\r\nMarseilles to Toulon is being pushed forward at an unheard of rate. It is\r\nthe only link wanting to complete the chain of communication between Brest,\r\nCherbourg, Paris, and Toulon. There was no expectation of this railway\r\nbeing finished before the middle of summer; but now it is understood that\r\nit will be ready within a few days--an instance of doing the impossible.\r\nSuch efforts presuppose some great object which it is desired to accomplish\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nI am told, perhaps incorrectly, that Prussia has decided to remain\r\nneutral--at first, at any rate; and, by the same authority, that Russia\r\nwill be neutral, but in a spirit friendly to France. This would be very\r\nserious; for Russia gives nothing for nothing. If it is so, the Emperor's\r\nproject would appear less silly. It would explain how an ambitious prince,\r\nwhose throne is tottering, who is bound to excite the admiration of France\r\nand to gratify the national vanity, [Footnote: Fleury, one of the most\r\nfaithful and attached of the Emperor's followers wrote in words almost\r\nidentical (_Souvenirs_, tom. i. p. 330): 'C'était par une série de faits\r\ngrandioses par des spectacles flattant l'orgueil et les instincts du pays,\r\nque Napoleon III allait, pendant de longues années, non seulement occuper,\r\nréjouir la France, mais encore fixer l'attention, l'étonnement et bien\r\nsouvent l'admiration du monde.'] who is stopped by no scruples, might find\r\nit an excellent opportunity for bringing on a personal war--if I may say\r\nso; for driving the Germans across the Alps and naming himself the Dictator\r\nof Italy. It is true that no great material advantage can result from it;\r\nbut L. N. is sufficiently well acquainted with France to know that the\r\nglitter of such a course would probably content her. All this would be easy\r\nto understand if Maria Theresa reigned at Vienna, Frederic at Berlin, and\r\nMme. de Pompadour at Versailles; in a word, if we were in the eighteenth\r\ninstead of the nineteenth century. But being, as we are, in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the designs which are ascribed to the Emperor are to be condemned\r\nas in the highest degree treasonable to humanity and to France. Kings can\r\nno longer claim to be guided only by their personal interests and passions;\r\nand now--when it is agreed that England cannot remain neutral in a war\r\nbetween France and a great Continental Power; when it is admitted that\r\na Continental war, however short, would surely awaken the hatred of all\r\nprinces and all neighbouring people, and would end in a coalition against\r\nFrance--now, I say, to plunge into such an adventure would be not only the\r\nmost silly, but the most wicked thing which a Frenchman could do.\r\n\r\nLa longueur un peu désordonnée de cette lettre, mon cher ami, vous prouvera\r\nmieux que tout ce que je pourrais dire les progrès de ma santé. Je vais\r\nécrire à Mme Grote. Rappelez-nous, je vous prie, tout particulièrement au\r\nsouvenir de Lady Theresa et de Sir C. Lewis. J'espère que Lord Hatherton\r\nne m'a pas oublié. Mille et mille amitiés à tous les Senior. Je n'ai pas\r\nbesoin d'en dire autant pour Mme et Mile Reeve. Tout à vous de coeur, A. T.\r\n\r\nReeve replied immediately:--\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, 1 mars_.--Votre lettre me fait le plus sensible plaisir.\r\nLes nouvelles indirectes de votre santé qui me sont parvenues de temps en\r\ntemps m'avaient excessivement préoccupé. J'ai su que le mois de janvier\r\navait été mauvais, et quoique j'eusse bien des fois l'envie de prendre la\r\nplume, elle m'est tombée des mains lorsque j'ai réfléchi que j'ignorais\r\nmalheureusement dans quel état de corps et d'esprit ma lettre pourrait\r\nvous trouver. Pendant tout l'hiver j'ai reçu par lettre et de bouche une\r\ninfinité de demandes sur votre état. Vous ne sauriez croire à quel point\r\ntous vos amis d'Angleterre, qui sont encore plus nombreux que ceux dont\r\nvous avez une connaissance personnelle, m'ont témoigné pour vous d'intérêt,\r\nde considération et d'affection. Aussi votre convalescence est une bonne\r\nnouvelle pour nous tous--les Lewis, les Hatherton, les Grote, Knight-Bruce\r\net tant d'autres. Je me permets cependant de dire que le sentiment que j'ai\r\neu toutes les fois que je me suis transporté par la pensée à votre chambre\r\nde malade est bien autrement profond. Mon amitié pour vous est une des\r\naffections les plus vives qu'il m'ait été donné de conserver. Je n'ai rien\r\nde plus cher. Et l'idée que vous souffriez tant de mal, sans qu'il me\r\nfût possible de vous offrir le moindre soulagement, m'à été extremement\r\npénible. Pour un malade la lecture de mes 'Catacombes' ne me paraît pas\r\nexcessivement gai, mais je reconnais là votre aimable souvenir de l'auteur.\r\nBref, vous êtes en convalescence. Le soleil printanier, même dans nos\r\nclimats, luit d'un éclat extraordinaire. Déjà au mois de février les\r\narbustes poussaient des feuilles. Dieu veuille que cette douce chaleur de\r\nl'année vous rende bientôt à la santé et à la Normandie.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the state of public affairs is more serious than it\r\nhas been since 1851. [Footnote: _Sc._ in France, before the _Coup d'état_.]\r\nThe meaning of what has lately been going on in public, and of the secret\r\nplots which have been hatching for a long time, is very clear. As to\r\nFrance, I say nothing; for, after all, she has the chances of success,\r\nwhich will smooth away many apparent difficulties. But the peace of Europe\r\ndepends on Germany and on England. Shall we succeed in maintaining it? The\r\nattitude of England is, I think, good. Without any hostile demonstration,\r\nshe has shown very clearly that she will be no party to any breach of the\r\ntreaties. Lord Cowley's mission to Vienna has been arranged between him\r\nand the Emperor, but I have no faith in it. It is merely a device to make\r\npeople think he is acting in agreement with the English Cabinet, and so\r\nconceal a scheme to which the English Cabinet is totally opposed. Opinion\r\nhere is unanimous against French intervention in Italy. Unfortunately, we\r\nare in a very bad position at home. The Cabinet is deplorably weak, and it\r\nhas just lost two of its principal members. The Reform Bill, brought in\r\nyesterday, raises more questions than it answers; but it will probably\r\nserve to give prominence to the dissensions in the Liberal party. 'Tis\r\na real misfortune; for a disunited party cannot assert any influence in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham is returning to Cannes, though with little inclination to\r\nstay among such grave causes of anxiety. So long as France is free to act\r\nby sea, the road to Italy does not lie through Var, but in the ports of\r\nToulon and Marseilles. Shall you soon be hearing the guns of the second\r\nMarengo?\r\n\r\nThe action of England at this important crisis was curious, but\r\ncharacteristic. The destinies of Europe were shaking in the balance; the\r\nfortunes of France, of Italy, of Austria, probably also of Prussia, and\r\nvery possibly of Russia, were at stake; so the English Government thought\r\nit a suitable opportunity to tinker the constitution and introduce a Reform\r\nBill--which nobody seems to have wanted--mainly, it would seem, to 'dish'\r\nthe Whigs. It was, however, they themselves who were dished. Mr. Henley,\r\nthe President of the Board of Trade, resigned on January 27th. So also did\r\nMr. S. H. Walpole, [Footnote: Mr. Walpole died, at the age of 92, on May\r\n22nd, 1898.] the Home Secretary, who wrote to Lord Derby: 'I cannot help\r\nsaying that the measure which the Cabinet are prepared to recommend is one\r\nwhich we should all of us have stoutly opposed if either Lord Palmerston\r\nor Lord John Russell had ventured to bring it forward.' None the less,\r\nthe Bill was introduced on February 28th. On the second reading it was\r\nnegatived; a dissolution and a general election followed; and on the\r\nmeeting of Parliament, in June the Ministry were defeated on an amendment\r\nto the Address, and resigned.\r\n\r\nBut though the want of confidence appeared to be based on the question of\r\nthe Reform Bill, there is no doubt that there was a widespread mistrust of\r\nthe foreign policy of the Government. For some years past, perhaps ever\r\nsince Mr. Gladstone's celebrated Neapolitan letters in 1851, successive\r\nwaves of sentiment in favour of Italian independence and unity had passed\r\nover the country; and Lord Derby, or Lord Malmesbury, had perhaps fancied\r\nthat this sentiment might be invoked in their defence. They had not,\r\nindeed, taken any overt action, but there was a general idea that they were\r\ninclined to favour the designs of Italy and of France. Now, to favour the\r\ncause of Italian independence was one thing; to favour the ambitious and\r\ngrasping schemes of France was another; and the leaders of the Liberal\r\nparty were not slow to denounce the Government, which--as they alleged--was\r\nready to plunge the country into war for the sake of currying favour with\r\nthe master of the insolent colonels of 1858.\r\n\r\nReeve's own view of the questions at issue may be gathered from the letters\r\nwhich he wrote to the 'Times,' [Footnote: January 19th, _The Policy of\r\nFrance in Italy_; April 28th, _The Policy of France_, both under the\r\nsignature of 'Senex.'] and more fully, more carefully expressed in the\r\narticle 'Austria, France, and Italy' in the 'Edinburgh Review' of April.\r\nIn this he distinctly combats 'what is termed the principle of\r\n\"nationalities\"' as unhistorical. The theory is, he says, 'of modern growth\r\nand uncertain application;' and he goes on to show in detail that it is not\r\napplicable to any one of the Great Powers of Europe.\r\n\r\n'Of all the sovereigns now filling a throne, Queen Victoria is undoubtedly\r\nthe ruler of the largest number of subject races, alien populations, and\r\ndiscordant tongues. In the vast circumference of her dominions every form\r\nof religion is professed, every code of law is administered, and her empire\r\nis tesselated with every variety of the human species.... But above and\r\naround them all stands that majestic edifice, raised by the valour and\r\nauthority of England, which connects these scattered dependencies with one\r\ngreat Whole infinitely more powerful, more civilised, and more free than\r\nany separate fragment could be; and it is to the subordination of national\r\nor provincial independence that the true citizenship of these realms owes\r\nits existence.... It is the glory of England to have constituted such an\r\nempire, and to govern it, in the main, on just and tolerant principles, as\r\nlong as her imperial rights are not assailed; when they are assailed, the\r\npeople of England have never shown much forbearance in the defence of them.\r\nSuch being the fact, it is utterly repugnant to the first principles of our\r\nown policy, and to every page in our history, to lend encouragement to that\r\nseparation of nationalities from other empires which we fiercely resist\r\nwhen it threatens to dismember our own.'\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to speak of the administration of such nationalities, and\r\ncontinues:--'The spirit of the Austrian Government in the Italian provinces\r\nwe heartily deplore. All things considered, it would have been better for\r\nAustria herself if England and the other Powers had not insisted in 1815\r\non her resuming the government of Lombardy, or if the Lombardo-Venetian\r\nkingdom had been erected into a distinct State; but that consideration is\r\nutterly insufficient to justify a deliberate breach of the public law of\r\nEurope.'\r\n\r\nAnd he adds a note:--'We believe that we are strictly correct in stating\r\nthat the Emperor Francis, foreseeing the difficulties his Government would\r\nhave to encounter in Lombardy, and anxious to avoid causes of future\r\ndissension with France, expressed his strong disinclination to resume that\r\nprovince; but it was pressed upon him by the other Powers, and especially\r\nby the Prince Regent of England, as the only effectual mode of excluding\r\nthe influence of France from Northern Italy.'\r\n\r\nThe argument, throughout, is that the attack on Austria about to be made by\r\nFrance and Sardinia was an unprovoked aggression, a violation of European\r\ntreaties; on the part of Sardinia, for lust of territory, and on the part\r\nof France, for a desire to remodel the map of Europe, to annex Savoy--\r\nwhich was to be the price of her assistance--and to carry out the ideas\r\n'conceived at the time of his early connexion with the Italian patriots in\r\nthe movement of 1831.'\r\n\r\n_From Lord Hatherton_\r\n\r\n_Teddesley, March 5th._--I have been from home two days....Pray excuse my\r\nnot having thanked you before for your kind announcement of Tocqueville's\r\nconvalescence. But the same day brought me a letter from a friend of\r\nTocqueville's brother, ... telling me the accounts were very unpromising. I\r\nhope and believe yours is the more reliable account.\r\n\r\nI have not a doubt that L. Napoleon means war, and will not be baulked of\r\nit. It is a disagreeable thing for England to know that, if he succeed,\r\nhe will have acquired some valuable experience in the embarkation and\r\ndisembarkation of an armament of 45,000 men, with as many more to follow\r\nit; and that if they are not wanted in the Mediterranean, they may be\r\nused elsewhere, while we are totally unprepared; and I fear, through the\r\nweakness of our Government, from the nature of our institutions, for\r\npurposes of defence in times of peace, are likely to remain so.\r\n\r\n_From Count Zamoyski_\r\n\r\nParis, March 29th.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I am not surprised at your regret; my own is very keen.\r\nThroughout his whole life Sigismond Krasinski was obliged to conceal his\r\ntrue self. Out of regard for his father, who was always a pitiful courtier\r\nof success, he denied himself the liberty of saying what he thought,\r\nacknowledging what he wrote, or showing to whom he was attached. I was one\r\nof those whom he supported by his zealous co-operation. You knew him as a\r\npoet; he had become a politician, and seemed destined to exercise a\r\ngreat influence. His loss is irreparable. To me he was a friend and a\r\nbrother-in-arms.\r\n\r\nHis widow, his two sons--of twelve and thirteen, and his daughter, of\r\nseven, are here. She is occupied in collecting all her husband's writings,\r\nwith the intention of publishing all that is of value. She thinks, and\r\nrightly, that a judicious selection of his letters would be especially\r\ninteresting as containing the secret of his life--a secret which he guarded\r\nso carefully. If, therefore, you will send me what you have, or bring them\r\nwhen you come here in a month's time, you will oblige both his widow and\r\nfriends. His sons had never been separated from him--which will assure you\r\nthat their early education has been well cared for. Their mother proposes\r\nthat they should continue their studies here, attending a college, and\r\nhaving lessons in Polish history and literature, which can be had here\r\nbetter than in Poland.\r\n\r\nSo it is settled that we are to have a congress! But what will it do? What\r\ncan be done in such a matter in so short a time? The 'Moniteur' has rightly\r\npointed out that it is necessary to 'study the questions.' For that, time\r\nis especially wanted. It would need something like a council sitting\r\nthrough years, reigns, wars, to bring about salutary and lasting results.\r\nI am told that nowadays everything must go by steam--this, as well as the\r\nrest. To which, I answer that the result will be nothing but water mixed\r\nwith blood....\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see the English Press more and more unjust to the Emperor\r\nNapoleon. It is really silly to keep on schooling France--not the\r\nEmperor--for preferring an imperial to a parliamentary government. If\r\nthe English had the institutions which in France seem to be but the\r\nconcomitants of despotism, they would educe from them a large amount of\r\npolitical liberty. But if the French--like the woman in Molière prefer\r\nbeing governed, it would be wise for the English peers to accept the fact;\r\nand instead of sneering at and irritating France whenever she wishes to\r\ndo some good, to get out of the beaten track, to conquer hearts, not\r\nterritories, it would be better honestly to co-operate with her, and thus\r\nattain valuable results--a profitable success, and the deliverance\r\nof France from the fatal support of Russia, which she accepts as a\r\n_pis-aller_, but which in the long run can only be to her hurt. More than\r\nall others, the English Press, which is so proud--which has good reason to\r\nbe proud--should assist in the 'study of the questions;' should anticipate\r\nthe negotiations; should elevate and elucidate them by judicious\r\nsuggestions, basing everything on a firm alliance of the Western Powers.\r\n\r\nBut alas! where is the English statesman, where is even the great writer or\r\nthe newspaper capable of inaugurating such a policy? For lack of these, we\r\nsee England vying with France in courtesy to Russia--in anxiety to please\r\nher. But to this the Emperor Napoleon does at least add his theory of\r\nnationalities, which is sufficient to reassure us on the score of his\r\nflirtation with Russia; does the English Government or the English press do\r\nanything of a similar nature? Alas! Alas! England is certainly great,\r\nbut it is selfishly for herself. Will she never be able to offer other\r\nnations--whatever the circumstances may be--anything but insults, or her\r\nown institutions as patterns.\r\n\r\nPardon de ce bavardage et mille amitiés--avec tous mes compliments pour\r\nMesdames Reeve.\r\n\r\nL. ZAMOYSKI.\r\n\r\nJe joins un mot de la Ctsse. K. pour vous, reçu à l'instant.\r\n\r\n_From the Countess Krasinska_\r\n\r\n_Paris, 29 mars._--Le Comte Zamoyski a bien voulu me communiquer votre\r\nlettre, monsieur, et j'ai été bien sincèrement touchée du souvenir\r\nd'affection que vous conservez à un ami qui n'a cessé non plus, je puis\r\nvous le garantir, de vous porter un sentiment inaltérable et sincère. Bien\r\nsouvent, en me parlant des jours de sa jeunesse, mon mari me parlait de\r\ncette amitié qui vous unissait et qui en a été un des meilleurs rayons. Il\r\nm'avait aussi parlé des manuscrits que vous aurez, et je vous avoue que\r\nvous allez au-devant de mes désirs et de ma prière en voulant bien les\r\ncommuniquer. Je tiens infiniment à recueillir tout ce qui a échappé à ce\r\ngrand coeur et à cette vaillante plume, et je commence un travail qui ne\r\nsera sans doute complet que dans quelques années. Je vous serai donc on ne\r\npeut plus reconnaissante si vous vouliez bien confier entre mes mains ce\r\nque vous possédez, soit en copie, soit original, comme vous le voudrez,\r\nm'engageant à vous remettre ce précieux dépôt dès que nous en aurons fait\r\nusage, et dès que vous le réclamerez.\r\n\r\nJ'espère lorsque vous viendrez à Paris que je pourrai vous présenter,\r\nmonsieur, les deux fils de Sigismond et sa petite fille, et vous demander\r\npour les enfants un peu de ce coeur que vous aviez pour le père.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 9th_.--I fear I have but a bad account to give of poor\r\nTocqueville; he has been worse again, and to-day he received the Communion.\r\nDr. Maure has just told me he hardly thought he could live over the month,\r\nbut he (Dr. M.) has always been much more desponding than the other\r\nphysician. One great evil has befallen him. Beaumont, who had really been\r\na nurse to him these three weeks, is suddenly called away to Paris by\r\nthe telegraph, owing to some illness in his own family, and this is an\r\nirreparable loss to Tocqueville.\r\n\r\nWe are all here in great anxiety about peace and war. Cavour, whose\r\nconduct--and that of his master--is as bad as possible, has no doubt\r\nreceived strong assurances of support from L. N. and his vile cousin; and\r\nthe war party at Turin are exulting, considering that the Congress can do\r\nnothing to prevent the outbreak with Austria, upon which they reckon for\r\ncertain, and, I fear, with some reason. The utter want of good faith in L.\r\nN. becomes daily more manifest.... Yet, though even the military men are\r\ncrying out against the war, and all other parties, without any exception,\r\nare against him, one sees nothing that can effectually shake him, unless he\r\nwere to be defeated in the war he has been endeavouring to bring about. The\r\nwhole prospects are as gloomy as possible for the friends of freedom and of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 10th_.--Many thanks for your letter, which gives me\r\ninformation much beyond what my other letters give, but far from agreeable\r\neither as to home or foreign affairs. This destruction (I fear I must call\r\nit) of the Liberal party by the personal vanity, which they call by the\r\nhigher name of ambition, of two persons is truly deplorable; and the\r\nconduct of the Government in dissolving is such as can hardly be exceeded\r\nin folly. We shall have an increased split, I fear, of the Liberals, and a\r\nweaker Government than ever. I grieve to say that matters look as ill\r\nfor peace in this country and Italy as ever. The conduct of Cavour is\r\nabominable.\r\n\r\nI grieve to give you a worse account than ever of Tocqueville. Dr. Maure\r\nhad condemned him from the first, but Dr. Sève had sanguine hopes, at\r\nleast, of a long time being given. But I have just seen him, and he now\r\nsays it is an affair of days. So all is nearly over. Mme. T. is also very\r\nill, and Beaumont being forced to leave them is most vexatious.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G. C., April 10th_.--Do you chance to have a proof-sheet of that part of\r\nyour article which treats of the rights of Austria to Lombardy and Venice\r\nand her reversionary rights to the other States, and, if so, will you lend\r\nit to me? You have made the whole case so clear that I should like to read\r\nit over again, as it may be necessary to say something on the subject in\r\nthe House of Lords when Malmesbury makes his statement, and I see that\r\nthe 'Edinburgh Review' will not be out till Friday, otherwise I would not\r\ntrouble you.\r\n\r\n_G. C., April 13th_.--Many thanks for the proof-sheets, and Schwarzenberg's\r\ndespatch and Duvergier's letter, which I enclose. I was kept at home by a\r\nslight attack of gout yesterday, and did not see Malmesbury, but on Monday\r\nhe told me that he had hopes of being able to announce a disarming of the\r\nthree would-be belligerent Powers. Until he makes that statement I shall\r\nnot believe in its probability. Palmerston and Lord John seem well aware\r\nthat any encouragement to war would be most unpopular at home, and I don't\r\nexpect that there will be much discussion on Friday.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\nOrleans House, April 11th.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Claremont I find your letter. With my brothers I had just\r\nbeen deploring the great loss sustained by the Liberal party. [Footnote:\r\nThe death of Tocqueville was prematurely announced a week before it\r\nactually took place.] Of all the men of mark in our deliberative\r\nassemblies, M. de Tocqueville was certainly the most stainless. He had the\r\nrare advantage of not being obnoxious to any of the parties existing in\r\nFrance, by which I mean all self-respecting parties, such as will be taken\r\ninto account on the day when France shall become herself again. He would\r\ncertainly have been one of the most important members of the first free\r\ngovernment in our country. Even as things are, he was one of our public\r\ncharacters whose voice carried most weight, and who was best fitted to\r\nenlighten the minds of others. God has taken him from us before his time.\r\nForgive me for retaining so much selfishness and party spirit before the\r\ncoffin of so good and amiable a man; for regretting his public more than\r\nhis private virtues.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 15th_.--... France does not understand, approve, or wish\r\nfor an Italian war now any more than she did six months ago. I persist in\r\nthinking that in his inmost soul, and of his own judgement, the Emperor\r\nNapoleon would also be glad to be rid of it, provided it should be quite\r\nclear that it is not of his free will that he backs out of his promise, and\r\nthat, in remaining at peace, he is yielding to imperious necessity, to the\r\ninterest, will, and influence of Europe. On Europe, therefore, the matter\r\ndepends; and, in this, Europe is England, for Prussia will follow England.\r\nIt is, therefore, towards you that all of us who are friends of peace and\r\ngood sense now turn our eyes. Do not fall a prey to the disease which has\r\nmastered all the politicians of the time. Do not be afraid to take the\r\ninitiative, to incur the responsibility; decide and act according to your\r\nown opinion, instead of waiting for circumstances to decide and act for\r\nyou. On this condition alone the peace of Europe will be saved; without\r\nit, it will not. And of this be sure: that if war does break out, we shall\r\nfeel, no doubt, that you have been wanting in the foresight and resolution\r\nwhich would have prevented it....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n[_Cannes_] _April 17th_.--Poor Tocqueville died this morning, not at\r\nHyères, as the papers which announced his death a week ago say, but at a\r\nhouse a mile from Cannes. His two brothers were with him; and his poor wife\r\nis so ill that she will not long survive him.\r\n\r\nPeople in high quarters in England seem bent on believing that the Congress\r\nwill do wonders. I don't expect it. There is such bad faith in the man\r\non whom it really all turns, and he is in such a state, by the universal\r\nopinion of France and of Europe being against him, that I should not be\r\nsurprised at any desperate act to regain the place he has lost. You may\r\nnaturally suppose the preparations which, chiefly naval, are going on must\r\nmean something, and he seems resolved that no restraint on them shall be\r\nimposed when others agree to disarm. Why should he not agree to stop, and\r\nnot to add to his means--as everyone that comes from Marseilles tells us he\r\nis doing, though gradually? The reason he will suffer no restriction to be\r\nimposed is that the army would regard this as a concession, and he won't\r\nrisk any offence in that quarter. The worst of it is that they--the\r\nofficers--though just as averse to an Austrian war as the country at large,\r\nwould by no means dislike a dash at England, and I cannot get out of my\r\nmind the risk there is of his making that attempt when we are unprepared.\r\nThe perfidy would be overlooked in the success, though temporary. And in\r\nthe midst of all this we have Malmesbury at the F. O. and Derby premier!\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G.G., April 19th_. I am delighted you approved of what I said last\r\nnight,[Footnote: In the House of Lords.] and much obliged to you for\r\nletting me know it. I thought Derby's speech excellent, though perhaps a\r\ntrifle too bellicose in the latter part for John Bull, who always wants a\r\nlittle preparation before he is taken over rough ground. He is under the\r\nstrict neutrality delusion just now, and has not yet thought of realising\r\nhis rôle in a European war.\r\n\r\nYour article is attracting great attention, and seems to be working a great\r\ndeal of good. Where did you get the information contained in the note to p.\r\n566? [Footnote: See _ante_, p. 13.] I meant to have used it, and to have\r\nappealed to Aberdeen to confirm the statement, but thought it prudent to\r\nask him beforehand whether he agreed.\r\n\r\nThe article on 'Austria, France, and Italy,' in the April number of the\r\nReview brought Reeve the following letter from Mr. Edward Cheney, till then\r\na mere acquaintance, though between the two a friendship quickly sprang up\r\nwhich was broken only by death. Mr. Cheney had lived for several years in\r\nItaly, and his letters--always interesting, frequently amusing--commonly\r\nrelate to Italian affairs; but he was a well-read, accomplished, and\r\nlarge-minded man, and in his judgement on literary questions Reeve had\r\ngreat confidence.\r\n\r\nAudley Square, April 20th.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir,--At the risk of appearing intrusive, and perhaps impertinent,\r\nI cannot resist my strong inclination to express the great satisfaction\r\nwith which I have read the article in the last number of the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview' on the Italian question. I do not presume to attribute the\r\nauthorship to yourself, though the clearness of the style, the closeness of\r\nthe reasoning, and the candour of the deductions would naturally lead me\r\nto that conclusion; but, in truth, its merits are far beyond its technical\r\nexcellencies, and I rejoice peculiarly on its appearance at a moment when\r\npublic attention is concentrated on the affairs of the Italian peninsula,\r\nand when the public, too, has so much need of enlightenment. A man who\r\nwrites as the author of that article has done confers an incalculable\r\nbenefit on his countrymen; and, as one not altogether incompetent to form a\r\njudgement on the subject, I beg to offer him my congratulations.\r\n\r\nI have lived many years in Italy, am minutely acquainted with every part\r\nof it. I have many friends and intimates amongst its natives. I admire the\r\ncountry, and like its people; and, while doing justice to many of their\r\nexcellent and amiable qualities, I cannot be blind to the fact that most of\r\nthe misfortunes which have befallen them are attributable mainly to\r\ntheir want of constancy, their want of ambition, and--the word must be\r\nspoken--their want of courage. They are now on the eve of another and more\r\nserious revolution; they are rushing with reckless indifference upon a\r\ndanger the extent of which they cannot realise to themselves, but which\r\nmust inevitably overwhelm them. A European war must be the consequence, a\r\nwar in which England must ultimately take a part; and the man who calmly\r\nand dispassionately endeavours to open the eyes of his countrymen to the\r\ntruth, and who, regardless of passing obloquy, dares to assert it, is their\r\nreal benefactor; and though, at the first moment, he may share the fate\r\nof those who tell unwelcome truths, justice will ultimately be done him,\r\nthough not, perhaps, till the cry of regret is raised that his warning and\r\nadvice were both neglected. I would conclude my letter with another apology\r\nfor having thus far intruded on your valuable time; but you yourself will\r\nbe able to suggest my best excuse in the deep interest which we both take\r\nin the subject.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nEDWARD CHENEY.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 21st_.--J'ai reçu et lu votre article il y a déjà plusieurs\r\njours, et je l'ai trouvé excellent. Il est impossible de mieux résumer les\r\nfaits, de mieux établir les droits et de faire mieux pressentir la bonne\r\npolitique. Lord Derby et Lord Clarendon vous ont donné pleinement raison.\r\nIls ont gardé, l'un et l'autre, chacun dans sa position, une juste mesure,\r\ntout en parlant avec une grande franchise. L'effet est grand ici.\r\n\r\nThe question is how to get clear of this imbroglio, the handiwork of a\r\nlot of mischief-makers, who are at once timid and rash, obstinate and\r\nunenterprising, conscious of their weakness, yet persisting in their folly.\r\nWe are waiting impatiently for the decisive answers from Turin and Vienna;\r\nand then the congress; and then your elections; and then--what? I have\r\npassed the best part of my life in doing, and am not yet accustomed to\r\nwaiting without knowing what for....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n[_Cannes_] _April 21st_.--I am extremely obliged to you for sending the\r\narticle, which I have read with the greatest satisfaction. There are one or\r\ntwo things of minor importance on which I differ. The matter of Genoa as\r\nconnected with Piedmont, I need not say, is not one of these. Indeed, it\r\nmight have been put stronger, and without reference to Lord W. Bentinck;\r\nfor, if I rightly recollect, when I, in 1817, attacked Castlereagh on the\r\nmisdeeds of the congress in 1815, I put the surrender of Genoa to Piedmont\r\nin the very front of the charges against the congress--independent of Lord\r\nW. B.'s proclamation, and on the ground of the Genoese hatred of Piedmont.\r\nI again referred to this the first night of the session.\r\n\r\nI broke through my rule of never attending funerals yesterday. The last\r\ntime I broke it was my dear friend Follett; this time it was Tocqueville. I\r\nshould have been the only member of the Institute, but Ampere had set out\r\nfrom Rome on receiving T.'s letter, and arrived the day after his death. He\r\nis carried to Tocqueville--near Cherbourg, as you know; one of his brothers\r\nand a nephew accompany it. Mme. T. is not nearly so ill as was believed. It\r\nis bronchitis, not lungs; so she expects to go by slow journeys in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_April 22nd_.--Since I wrote yesterday I have received an account which,\r\nwhether true or not, shows the opinion they have in Italy of our great\r\nally. A man who had stood his friend and prevented the King of Holland from\r\ndisinheriting him, has lately been at Paris, and was kindly received by\r\nhim. So far is certain, and his kindness to those who befriended him\r\nformerly is a good quality he really possesses. But it is added that he\r\ntold him to tell his nation not to be disheartened by the congress, because\r\ncare would be taken to make proposals which must be rejected, and that he\r\nwas as ready as ever. I really believe there is nothing too base in the\r\nway of perfidy he would scruple to do, if his resolution was fixed and it\r\nappeared clearly to be his interest. There has, however, been a change in\r\nhim of late, as to determination. He is more easily swayed by others than\r\nhe was, and he falters more when left alone. Altogether, it is a cruel\r\ncalamity for the world to have such a person to depend upon. I wish someone\r\nwould show how much he appeals to the multitude--the mere _mob_. He is\r\nstill a socialist in practice; and if anyone will read the Robespierre\r\npapers, he will see that there is a deliberate design to make the poor--the\r\npersons without property--rule. One man whom I afterwards knew (Julien de\r\nParis), and who had been a philanthropist _exalté_, states, in one of his\r\nreports to the Committee of Public Safety, that those who have no property\r\nare the great majority, and therefore must govern. There could be no\r\ngreater service to France than a full exposition of these principles--the\r\nones which L. N. adopts; and at the same time a full account of the\r\nabominable character of the first Napoleon, of which the materials are\r\nabundant in the correspondence with Joseph, [Footnote: _Mémoires et\r\nCorrespondance politique et militaire du roi Joseph_ (6 tom. 8vo.\r\n1854).] and also in the printed, but unpublished, vols. of his whole\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n[_Cannes_] _May 4th_--I suppose some folks will now have discovered what\r\nreliance there is to be placed on a capricious and absolute man. It was\r\nclear from the first that he had resolved upon this Italian speculation,\r\nand that as soon as he could mitigate the universal feeling and opinion\r\nagainst him, he would have his way. The congress, whether suggested by him\r\nthrough Russia or not, was only one means of delay till all was ready, and\r\none way of putting Austria in the wrong, or making an outcry against her\r\nas if she was--for really, except in the clumsy way of doing it, I can see\r\nnothing to blame in her refusal. She is treated as the aggressor. Now all\r\nshe has done, or could do, was in her own defence, and nothing in the world\r\ncan be more absurd than pretending that she is the cause of the war. If\r\nshe beat the allies ever so much, she does not gain one inch of territory,\r\nwhile their real object is to strip her. As for L. N. considering himself\r\naggrieved by her breaking off the negotiation and beginning to defend\r\nherself, it can only be on the supposition that he has a right to interfere\r\non behalf of the Italians. Indeed, the same thing may be said of Sardinia.\r\nIt is considered that she is aggrieved if the other Italian States are\r\naggrieved; and now comes this rising in Tuscany and the smaller duchies to\r\nembarrass one party and so far help the other. But there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that any rising in Lombardy will take place.\r\n\r\nThe unaccountable part of it is the Austrians delaying their attack. It\r\nseemed clear that their plan would be to march upon Turin before the French\r\ncould get up, and yet they have suffered 40,000 men to be landed at Genoa,\r\nand a considerable force to cross by Mont Cenis, without doing anything.\r\nCan it be that the sudden notice to Piedmont was an act of the Emperor\r\nwithout his ministers being consulted, and that they are less prepared than\r\nwas supposed? Bunsen's son, who is in the Prussian mission at Turin, wrote\r\nten days ago that the Government was ready to remove to Genoa, expecting\r\nthe Austrians to come before the French arrived, and knowing Turin to be\r\nindefensible. It now seems that there must be a battle before Turin can\r\nbe taken. All the road from Paris to Marseilles has been encumbered with\r\ntroops, and all the steamers have been taken by the Government, and\r\nmore men will be sent if wanted. The usual effect of a war has\r\nbeen perceived--namely, making the multitude rally round the\r\nGovernment--consequently there is less outcry against the war than there\r\nwas, except amongst thinking people and those who are suffering from the\r\nsuspension of all trade. The Emperor himself will probably join the army\r\nwhen they are prepared for an advantageous movement. He is playing a game\r\nthat may be desperate. This Russian alliance is denied, but substantially\r\nit is true, and I have little doubt that some undertaking is effected to\r\ngive leave to Russia in Turkey, on condition that she does something for\r\nPoland (one of L. N.'s hobbies) and helps some Italian arrangement for the\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nThe next letter is endorsed by Reeve--'An affectionate record of a long\r\nfriendship. I have inserted it in the copy of his Journals.'\r\n\r\n_From Mr. C. C. Greville_\r\n\r\n_May 6th_.--I will not delay to thank you warmly for your kind note. Your\r\naccession to the P. C. office gave me a friendship which I need not say\r\nhow much I have valued through so many years of happy intercourse, which I\r\nrejoice at knowing has never been for an instant clouded or interrupted,\r\nand which will, I hope, last the same as long as I last myself. It is\r\nalways painful to do anything for the last time, and I cannot without\r\nemotion take leave of an office where I have experienced for so many years\r\nso much kindness, consideration, and goodwill. I have told Hamilton that\r\nI hope still to be considered as _amicus curiae_, and to be applied to on\r\nevery occasion when I can be of use to the office, or my personal services\r\ncan be employed to promote the interest of any member of it. Between you\r\nand me there has been, I think, as much as possible between any two\r\npeople, the 'idem velle, idem nolle et idem sentire de republicâ,' and in\r\nconsequence the 'firma amicitia.' God bless you, and believe me always,\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely and faithfully, C. C. G.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n[_Cannes_] _May 18th_.--I really begin to feel anxious about the peace of\r\nEurope, and not without some alarm as to our own position. There can be\r\nno doubt that for the present (if not more permanently) this man [the\r\nEmperor], working on the French feeling, has got the mob, military and\r\ncivil, with him. The war has ceased to be unpopular, and all reckon upon\r\nvictory. If they succeed, he will, for a while, be satisfied with the\r\ngratification of his vanity and the strengthening of his power; but soon\r\nafter he will be pushed by his unruly supporters, and will try a deeper\r\ngame. Of this they are as much convinced in Germany as of his existence,\r\nand even Prussia will not persist holding back. If she does, and if the\r\nRussian alliance continues, she will be destroyed as soon as Austria is\r\nweakened. I, therefore, expect to see Prussia take timely precautions. They\r\nare prepared at Frankfort to split with her if she does not.\r\n\r\nI am now satisfied that the Austrians intended only a _razzia_ to\r\nTurin, and then to carry on only a defensive contest; and having been\r\nprevented--partly by the floods, and partly by our untimely intermeddling,\r\nand partly by their old error of having one head at Vienna, and another\r\nwith the army--they have now given up the _razzia_, and will act on the\r\ndefensive. This will not prevent them taking advantage of any opportunity\r\nof attacking, should they be able to do so with a certainty of success; but\r\nfor any such dash I look rather to the French than to them. Certainly the\r\nMan is in a great difficulty if the Austrians steadily pursue this plan;\r\nfor the expectations are wound up to a high pitch in France--especially in\r\nParis and the great towns--of his doing something speedily, and the French\r\nnature is not to wait with calmness and patience. Even in this remote\r\nquarter, the thousands of fine troops passing raises a great feeling for\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham\r\n\r\nC. O., May 21st_.--To the very best of my belief, the Queen's Speech will\r\nnot be delivered till June 7th, but I speak without authority.... I have\r\nthe greatest doubt whether it will be possible to unite all those sections\r\nof the H. of C. which are not to be regarded as Lord Derby's supporters, in\r\na direct adverse vote--on the address or otherwise; and if the attempt is\r\nmade--as it probably will be I think it will fail. [Footnote: The attempt\r\nwas made, and did not fail. The Ministry was defeated on the amendment to\r\nthe address by 323 to 310.] The Government say they have 307 men on whom\r\nthey can rely, and a fair chance that fifteen or twenty more men will not\r\nconsent to take part in an active, offensive campaign. Indeed the country\r\ngentlemen say pretty generally that they will not attempt to turn the\r\nGovernment out, until they are satisfied that a more stable Government can\r\nbe formed. But how is this possible when the numbers are--on one side a\r\ncompact body of more than 300, and--on the other side, a divided body of\r\n350? What we hope, therefore, is this: that John Russell and the Radicals\r\nwill take a course on the subject of Reform which will be resisted by\r\nthe moderate Liberals; and that the result will be a fusion between the\r\nmoderate Liberals and the large Conservative phalanx. For it is clear that\r\nwithout some degree of support from the Conservatives, no other government\r\ncan be carried on. As for any lasting or sincere union between Lord\r\nPalmerston and Lord John, it is quite hopeless, [Footnote: The event\r\nfalsified this forecast. In the Ministry which Palmerston now formed Lord\r\nJohn was Foreign Secretary, and continued so till Palmerston's death in\r\n1865.] and the desire to keep the latter out of office is so general and\r\nintense, that it is probable he would fail to make a Cabinet, even if\r\nthe Queen sent for him--which she will certainly not do until the last\r\nextremity. On the other hand, there is the great objection to Palmerston\r\nthat he holds language about the Italians and the French--to whom he is\r\nentirely devoted--which is quite at variance with the convictions of every\r\nman of sense in the country. There can be very little doubt that the\r\nwar will spread. The whole of Germany is burning with ardour to support\r\nAustria; and if the French gain a battle on the Po, nothing will prevent\r\nthe whole strength of Germany from coming to the rescue. [Footnote: Louis\r\nNapoleon's fear of this is a sufficient explanation of his ambiguous policy\r\nafter Solferino.] The position of France is, in reality, most critical, for\r\nall her best troops are in Italy, and she would have great difficulty in\r\nplacing 100,000 men on the Rhine, where she may have to confront half a\r\nmillion of combatants.\r\n\r\nHortensius' [Footnote: William Forsyth, Q.C., for many years standing\r\ncounsel to the India Office. As the author, among other works, of\r\n_Hortensius_, and residing, as he still resides, at 61 Rutland Gate,\r\nLord Brougham, in writing to Reeve, invariably refers to him as either\r\n'Hortensius' or 'your neighbour.' In 1872 he published _Letters from\r\nLord Brougham to William Forsyth_, with some facsimiles to show his\r\n'extraordinary hand.' 'I think,' wrote Mr. Forsyth, 'the hieroglyphics will\r\npuzzle most readers;' but the samples he has given are as copper-plate\r\ncompared with some of the letters to Reeve of about the same date.]\r\nappointment was, I believe, purely an act of Lord Stanley's, and I dare say\r\nyour kindness in mentioning his name had due effect. Hortensius applied, by\r\nletter, for the appointment, and about three weeks after came a letter to\r\nsay he was appointed.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n[_Cannes_] _May 24th_. I have been reading over again your excellent\r\narticle on the subject of the day, and I may say of the place; and the more\r\nI reflect on it, I come the nearer to your view in all respects. Really the\r\nmore we consider this abominable man's conduct (and his accomplice Cavour\r\nis quite as bad, though not so foolish), the greater indignation we feel\r\nat the unprovoked breach of the peace. The audacity of the pretence from a\r\ndespot and usurper exceeds precedent. What can be said too of Russia, which\r\nkeeps her hold of Poland only ten years longer than the settlement of\r\n1815! It really would be important, now that the attempt has been made to\r\nrepresent [the first] Napoleon as the friend of oppressed nationalities,\r\nthat we should direct men's attention a little more to the enormities\r\nin that man's whole history. Party motives arising out of our English\r\ndivisions to a certain degree prevented the real truth from being generally\r\nfelt respecting him. There was the usual exaggeration on both sides. One\r\nparty painted the devil blacker than he was, crediting to him crimes which\r\nhe never committed. The other, because their adversaries thus painted him,\r\nwould allow nothing against him, and exaggerated his merits--though it were\r\ndifficult to overrate his capacity, and his military genius especially. But\r\nthe more his moral guilt is examined the blacker it will appear, and the\r\nlate publication, which you call candid, I believe has been true and full\r\nowing to careless superintendence. When I say publication I mean printing,\r\nfor it is not really published, though copies are freely given. The\r\npublication of Joseph's memoirs is also full of important matter.\r\n\r\nNow from these and the existing materials, a full and plain account of the\r\nman ought to be prepared, [Footnote: This is what M. Lanfrey began to do,\r\nand was going on with at the time of his lamented death, at the age of\r\nforty-nine, in 1877.] and you may rely on it that great effect against the\r\npresent man would be produced; for he ostentatiously connects his policy\r\nwith the former one's, and there is the greatest care taken to suppress\r\nattacks on Napoleon I. in the periodical publications--at least in the\r\nnewspapers. But if the English and German and Belgian press are full of the\r\nfacts, and repeatedly lay them before the world, no policy of the French\r\npress can long keep the truth from reaching the public. However, I am drawn\r\naway from what I had intended to mention--the present state of the public\r\nmind on the war question in this country. The giddy and warlike nature of\r\nthe people, and his going to the army, has produced an effect not only in\r\nremoving the unpopularity of the war, but in raising a warlike spirit--at\r\nleast for the present. If victory comes, this will be increased. It is\r\nprobable he may for the present be satisfied with the strength which he\r\nwill derive from it; but the army will probably join with the mob in\r\nwishing for further proceedings, and then we shall find that Germany will\r\nbe attacked, and I must even say that we shall do well to be prepared in\r\nEngland. I believe, however, that the Austrians in Italy will make it a\r\nlingering affair by defensive operations, and this will exhaust the French\r\npatience. The lies of the Sardinian press, and indeed official accounts,\r\nmake it impossible to tell how far they have at the beginning suffered a\r\ncheck. But I plainly perceive that, if something brilliant is not done, L.\r\nN. will be shaken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From Count Zamoyski_\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 28th_. May is passing and your plans are not yet realised; we\r\nstill await your arrival. Mme. Krasinska is leaving Paris for Warsaw, and\r\nhas charged me to forward you the enclosed, in which she gives you the\r\naddress of the person here who is ready to receive the papers you have\r\npromised her, which both she and the friends of the deceased await with\r\nlively interest.\r\n\r\nHaving written thus much on the matter in hand, Zamoyski turned again to\r\npolitics and the discussion at some length of the situation in Italy, out\r\nof which many of the Poles fondly hoped their freedom was to come. The\r\nEnglish mistrust of Napoleon, he argued, was as injudicious as unfounded,\r\nand could do nothing but harm by forcing France into the arms of Russia.\r\nOne of the many wild suggestions afloat at the time amounted to little less\r\nthan a complete remodelling of the map of Europe. Austria, deprived of her\r\nItalian provinces, was to be compensated on the lower Danube; as a balance\r\nto which, Russia was to occupy Constantinople, and, to mark her friendship\r\nto France--who was entering on the war for an _idée_--would restore\r\nfreedom to Poland. And there were some who believed it. Zamoyski was\r\nclearer-headed; but his mind also was warped by sense of wrong, and his\r\nfancy was as wild as the other. If England, he urged, will not act in\r\nconcert with France, let her at least emulate the noble example France is\r\nsetting. She is preparing to free Italy; let England, as her part in the\r\ngenerous rivalry, free Poland. Russia is still England's enemy. This is\r\nEngland's opportunity. And he seems to have persuaded himself that, if\r\nshe did not avail herself of it, she would be a recreant to the cause of\r\nliberty and humanity. It is very curious.\r\n\r\n_From the Countess Krasinska_\r\n\r\n_Paris, 26 mai_.--Je vous remercie infiniment, Monsieur, de votre bonne\r\nlettre et de tout ce que vous voulez bien me dire de celui que nous ne\r\ncesserons pas de regretter, et qui m'a bien et bien souvent parlé de vous\r\net des années de jeunesse passées avec vous dans une étroite et sincère\r\namitié. Ce souvenir a été constant dans son coeur! Je regrette infiniment\r\naussi que les évènements politiques vous aient empêché de venir à Paris,\r\ncomme vous vous le proposiez. Je suis obligée de partir pour Varsovie, et\r\ncrains de vous manquer si vous venez bientôt ici. Dans tous les cas, si\r\nvous vouliez bien confier vos précieux manuscrits [Footnote: If sent to\r\nM. Okrynski, the letters were returned; for they were afterwards given to\r\nSigismond's grandson, the present Count Adam Krasinski (_see post_. p.\r\n389).] à M. Victor Okrynski, Rue de la Pépinière 66, je vous en serai bien\r\nreconnaissante. C'est chez lui que je laisse en dépôt ce que nous avons\r\nrassemblé jusqu'ici.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the following note that Lord Macaulay had spoken to\r\nReeve of Dr. Thomas Campbell's \"Diary of a Visit to England in 1775; by\r\nan Irishman;\" a small book--little more than a pamphlet--which had been\r\npublished at Sydney in 1854. It had struck Reeve that such a \"Diary\"\r\nmight be the text for an interesting article in the \"Review;\" and the\r\ncorrespondence respecting it derives a peculiar value from its near\r\napproach to the close of Macaulay's labours.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Macaulay_\r\n\r\nHolly Lodge, Kensington, June 1st.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--Before you determine anything about Dr. T. Campbell's Diary,\r\nyou had better read it. I have lent my copy, which is probably the only\r\ncopy in England, and do not expect to get it back till next week. When it\r\ncomes, I will send it to you, and we will then talk further. Ever yours\r\ntruly, MACAULAY.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, June 11th_.--... On the Continent, it seems to me, there is\r\nnow only one question--Will Austria remain obstinate? If she does, if she\r\nis determined to fight on, although beaten; not to give up her Italian\r\npossessions, although she has lost them in Italy, and to impose on\r\nthe conquerors of Milan the necessity of being also the conquerors of\r\nVienna--in that case the actual beginning of the war is a trifle; we are\r\nadvancing towards a general war and European chaos. The mere continuance of\r\nthe struggle will be quite sufficient to make it impossible for anyone--for\r\nLord Derby as much as for Lord Palmerston--to stop it or to foresee\r\nwhere it will lead. Has Austria the will and the strength to prolong the\r\nstruggle? Or will she be alarmed and intimidated by her first defeats, and\r\nbe persuaded to make such concessions as will give, if not Italy herself,\r\nat least her patrons for the time being, a decent pretext to declare\r\nthemselves satisfied, and to retreat in triumph? I repeat this seems to me\r\nthe only question. If I were to judge by the reports that reach me from\r\nGermany, no doubt is there felt. Austria, both emperor and country, are\r\nsaid to be perfectly determined to fight to the last extremity, being\r\nconvinced that in their extreme peril, and when, in their persons, European\r\norder is endangered, they will find allies and a chance of safety. But I\r\ndo not put much faith in rumours which promise a somewhat heroic firmness.\r\nGreat things are apt to come to nothing nowadays, and it may well be that\r\nthe Italian question will fall through, and all this noise end in some\r\ntransaction which will be neither a true nor lasting solution. Italy has\r\nlong been the scene of events that end thus....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G.C., June 13th_.--You have always taken such a kind and friendly concern\r\nin my affairs that I think you will like to know how I stand. Palmerston,\r\nby the Queen's desire, insisted on my returning to the F.O., and I felt\r\nthat, though most unwilling to accept the offer, I had no sufficient plea\r\nfor declining it. But when Palmerston very properly placed any office at\r\nthe disposal of Lord John, he claimed the F.O. as his right. I gladly\r\nrecognised that right and the superiority of his claims to my own.\r\n\r\nI was most warmly pressed by Palmerston and my former colleagues to take\r\nany other office; but for that I saw no necessity, and I was sure I should\r\nbest consult the public taste by making way for some one who had not been\r\nin Palmerston's former Government. The Queen sent for me, and very kindly\r\ntried to shake my determination; but it had not been lightly taken, and she\r\ndid not succeed. So I am still free, and great is my happiness thereat.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Macaulay_\r\n\r\n_June 27th_.--If I were to renew my connexion with the \"Edinburgh Review\"\r\nafter an interval of fifteen years, I should wish my first article to be\r\nrather more striking than an article on Campbell's Diary can easily be. You\r\nwill, no doubt, do the thing as well as it can be done.\r\n\r\nSome other hand, therefore, supplied the article on \"A Visit to England in\r\n1775\" which appeared in the October number of the \"Review.\"\r\n\r\n_To Madame de Tocqueville_ 62 Rutland Gate, June 30th.\r\n\r\nDear Madame de Tocqueville, [Footnote: Mme. de Tocqueville was an\r\nEnglishwoman, and the correspondence was naturally in English.] I reproach\r\nmyself exceedingly for having delayed so long to express to you, or,\r\nrather, to endeavour to express to you, how strongly Mrs. Reeve and myself\r\nparticipate in that sympathy and sorrow which your irreparable loss\r\nhas inspired to the whole world, but most of all to those to whom the\r\nfriendship of your husband was one of the blessings of life. I cannot\r\naccustom myself to the thought that the intercourse I had the happiness to\r\nmaintain with him for twenty-five years is really at an end; and that\r\nthe events of the world in which he took so constant and enlightened an\r\ninterest are still rolling onwards, while his pure intelligence has passed\r\nto some higher and nobler sphere. We now look back, indeed, with a pleasure\r\nthat heightens our regret, to those delightful days we spent at Tocqueville\r\nin 1856, and to his visit to England in 1857. Nothing, indeed, was wanting,\r\neither to his fame or to the love he inspired those who knew him; and to\r\nboth these sacred recollections our thoughts will be directed as long as we\r\nsurvive. What, then, must be the loss and the void to you, who lived, as\r\nit were, _in_ that light? I dare not think of it, were it not that your\r\nthoughts will rise to that source which has consolation for all earthly\r\nsorrows. I have heard of you, and seen your admirable letters to Mrs. Grote\r\nand Mrs. Merivale, which assure me of the resignation and piety that still\r\nsupport you. Mrs. Reeve and Hopie desire to join in the cordial expression\r\nof their affectionate regard; and I remain Your most faithful servant,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\nIn August I left town for Ambleside and Abington, to shoot. Thence I went\r\nto the George R. Smiths', at Relugas; near Forres. Shot there, and then\r\ncrossed the Moray Firth to Skibo and Uppat. Then I went on to Langwell, in\r\nCaithness, which the Duke of Portland had lent the Speaker (E. Denison),\r\nand spent some days with him. Returned to town by sea from Aberdeen.\r\nShooting in September at Chorleywood and Stetchworth--the latter\r\nfirst-rate; then to Roxburghshire; afterwards to Raith.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Relugas, near Forres, August 26th._--Your very kind note of the 23rd has\r\nfollowed me here, where I am spending a few days on my way to Sutherland.\r\nTowards the latter end of October I shall be returning to England, with\r\nMrs. Reeve and my daughter, and if you are still at Brougham at that time,\r\nand disposed to receive us for a day or two in this patriarchal fashion, it\r\nwill give us the greatest pleasure to come.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon's amnesty appears to me to be the most judicious act of his\r\nreign, and, if he would only follow it up by giving a more legal character\r\nto his administration, I think he would soon rally many persons to himself.\r\nAll that the French seem at this time to require is that the Government\r\nshould observe the laws it enforces on other people--a very moderate\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nI will endeavour to find out about the Chancery Evidence Commission. It\r\nis a monstrous absurdity that your name should not appear in a commission\r\ndestined, if anything, to give effect to the principles you have so long\r\nand constantly advocated.\r\n\r\n_C.O., September 26th_.--I sincerely hope that, whatever day the Edinburgh\r\nbanquet takes place, I may have the honour of attending it. I shall\r\nprobably be at Raith at the time. Considering what you have been, for more\r\nthan half a century, to the \"Edinburgh Review,\" and the connexion which was\r\nthus so long maintained between yourself and Edinburgh, I am most anxious,\r\nas the humble representative of that journal at the present time, to\r\ndo anything in my power to contribute to a mark of respect paid you in\r\nEdinburgh; and I should have gladly attended the dinner, even if I had not\r\nbeen, as I probably shall be, within easy reach of it.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Brougham, September 27th_.--Many thanks for your great kindness about\r\nthe Edinburgh dinner, which I look forward to with some dismay; for the\r\nrequisition, which was signed by the heads of all parties, and in very\r\nkind terms, makes it impossible not to attend, and, beside the plagues\r\nincidental to all such proceedings, I have the excessive suffering from\r\nthe blanks by which I shall be surrounded. To go no further than what you\r\nallude to, it may possibly be October 25th, and certainly not later than\r\n26th; and that is the anniversary of the \"Edinburgh Review\" fifty-seven\r\nyears ago. Then Jeffrey, Horner, Smith, Allen, Murray, Playfair,\r\nThomson--all gone; and of later years, Cockburn, your father, Eyre. It\r\nis really a sad thing. And then, beside our set, there were A. Thomson,\r\nMoncreiff, T. Campbell, Cranstoun, Clerk, D. Stewart, W. Scott--all, except\r\nHorner, Playfair, and Scott, D. Stewart and A. Thomson, T. Campbell, alive\r\nin 1834, when I was last in Edinburgh. I must struggle the best I can, but\r\nthis feeling nearly overpowers me.\r\n\r\nI send you by this post a Paris paper I have just received, evidently sent\r\non account of the article marked, which is so far gratifying that it is by\r\na very eminent man, who signs it; but I chiefly value it on account of\r\nthe attack upon England for not having raised a monument, [footnote: Lord\r\nBrougham was at this time greatly interested, and indeed excited, about a\r\nproposed monument to Sir Isaac Newton. His letters frequently allude to\r\nit.] and on account, also, of the statement that he was the greatest of all\r\nmen--which will not be very agreeable to our friends of the Institute.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\nLord Brougham was elected Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh. I\r\nattended a banquet given him there on October 26th. I then went from Raith\r\nto Brougham and Appleby, High Legh, and Teddesley, shooting at all\r\nthese places, and at Crewe likewise, where I began to shoot with a new\r\nbreech-loading gun. I must have shot thirty-five or forty days this year,\r\nand paid a great number of visits in country houses. We did not go abroad.\r\n\r\nLord Macaulay had meantime received some further particulars as to the MS.\r\nof the 'Visit to England,' and sent them to Reeve with the following:--\r\n\r\nHolly Lodge, November 11th.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir,--I have just received the enclosed letter, which may, perhaps,\r\ninterest you. It might be worth while to put a short note at the end of the\r\nnext number of the 'Edinburgh Review.'\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nMACAULAY.\r\n\r\n_Endorsed_--Lord Macaulay. His last note to me. He died December 27th\r\n[really 28th].\r\n\r\nThe note referred to appeared in the number for January 1860, with the\r\nsympathetic remark: 'This very note was, in fact, his last contribution to\r\nthese pages, made within a short time of his death.'\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n62 _Rutland Gate, December 29th._--I communicated to Mrs. Austin your very\r\nkind intention of writing some notice of Mr. Austin in the 'Law Review,'\r\nand she has sent me the enclosed paper--very striking, I think it,\r\nespecially considering the state of physical exhaustion and mental grief in\r\nwhich she lies. Nothing can equal her devotion to his memory. She has, I\r\nthink, omitted to state that one portion of the lectures delivered by Mr.\r\nAustin at the London University were published by Murray in 1832, under the\r\ntitle of 'The Province of Jurisprudence Determined' You are aware that\r\nthis book retains a very high position, and, as John Austin never would\r\nrepublish it in his lifetime, copies of the volume fetch seven or eight\r\nguineas. I hope now it will appear again, with additions, as all the drafts\r\nof his lectures are in existence, most carefully elaborated by himself.\r\nHortensius has written a very nice article for the 'Edinburgh' on the\r\nprogress of legal reform and on your bills. I hope you will like it. The\r\nReview will be out on January 14th.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say just now that, as Mrs. Austin and I have no copy of the\r\nenclosed paper about her husband, we should be much obliged to you to\r\npreserve and return it to us.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet 'Le Pape et le Congrès' has certainly astonished the world. My\r\nCatholic friends call it the pamphlet of the Emperor Julian; and certainly,\r\nconsidering what the Pope has done for him, and he has done for the Pope,\r\nit is an act of apostasy. To engage in a contest with Rome is, however,\r\nstill no small enterprise, and I question if the Emperor has strength of\r\npurpose to carry it through. The Popes protested, in their day, against the\r\nTreaty of Westphalia and the Treaty of Vienna; _multo magis_, will they\r\nprotest against the decisions of the Congress of Paris? It must be\r\nacknowledged that matters look more favourably than they did for our own\r\npolicy and influence in the Congress.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham\r\n\r\nCannes, January 1st_, 1860.--First of all accept for yourself and Mrs.\r\nR. all the good wishes of the season from all here. Next, let me say how\r\ngratified I am with the very interesting, and, in the circumstances,\r\nextraordinary communication of Mrs. A. It is of the utmost importance, and\r\nconfirms me in the design I had newly formed, of making my account follow\r\nthis. It could be made for the next number of the 'Law Review;' in the\r\npresent number giving a short notice, lamenting the great loss, and\r\nannouncing a full article for next number. I had intimated the probability\r\nof this to Francis--the editor--and what I have received this morning\r\nfrom you strongly confirms me. There will, therefore, be only a general\r\nstatement this time. Really I feel the deepest interest in the subject,\r\nwhen I regard the strong and stern virtues of the man, beside his great\r\ntalents and learning.\r\n\r\nPoor Macaulay, I would give as a foil--of course, only to yourself,\r\nprivately. He had great abilities; and though I widely differed with him in\r\nhis views of history--which I, being of the science school, thought should\r\nbe different from an anecdote book, yet I admit the great merits of his\r\nwork, and especially of his essays. But I much objected to his running away\r\nfrom our death-struggle in 1834, though his defence was that his sisters\r\nwould have to go out in the world as milliners if he stayed to fight with\r\nus. I had myself made such sacrifices that I felt entitled to complain.\r\nHowever, I pass over that on the ground he gave. But, then, what is to be\r\nsaid of two sessions in the House of Lords without one word of help to the\r\nLiberal cause, or indeed to any cause? What but that it was owing to the\r\nfear of making a speech which would be thought a failure--that is, would\r\nbe injurious to his former speeches. Now, such a consideration as this J.\r\nAustin was wholly incapable of allowing even to cross his mind. He acted on\r\nwhat he conceived were just principles, and sacrificed to them all regard\r\nfor himself. How differently did those men act of whose set Macaulay\r\nwas!--his father, Stephen, H. Thornton, &c. However, his loss is a very\r\nmelancholy one, because he goes out of the world in full possession of his\r\nfaculties, and in more than just appreciation of his merits.\r\n\r\nThe Journal for 1860 begins:--\r\n\r\nThe new year opened at Chevening on a visit to Lord Stanhope. The party\r\nconsisted of the Morleys, Hayward, Goldwin Smith, and afterwards the\r\nGrotes.\r\n\r\nI went to Chevening again in 1862; and for a third time, with Christine, in\r\n1885; the host changed, but the same hospitality.\r\n\r\nWe sent a round-robin to the Dean of Westminster, begging that Macaulay\r\nmight be buried in the Abbey. He was buried there on January 9th. I was\r\nthere. The same day we started for Paris by Southampton. Saw the Circourts,\r\nRauzans, Guizots, &c.\r\n\r\nCharles Greville had introduced me to Fould, then minister of finance. On\r\nSunday, January 15th, Fould told me of the conclusion of the treaty of\r\ncommerce with England, and the same evening we all dined at M. Chevalier's,\r\nwith Cobden, Lavergne, Passy, Parieu, and Wolowski--the promoters and\r\nauthors of the treaty. The next day (16th) I dined with Fould at a state\r\ndinner; Metternichs, Bassanos, Auber, Ste.-Beuve, Bourqueney. I took down\r\nMrs. Baring. Lord Brougham was also in Paris.\r\n\r\nAlbert Pourtalès, my old fellow-pupil at Geneva, was now Prussian\r\nambassador; saw a good deal of him. This was a very interesting visit to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIn some very rough notes, Reeve jotted down the particulars he learned at\r\nthis time. They amount to this: That between January 16th and 21st, 1859,\r\na treaty was signed between France and Sardinia, by the 5th, 6th, and 7th\r\narticles of which Savoy was to be ceded to France when Lombardy and Venetia\r\nwere conquered and given to Piedmont. Nice was to be ceded when Piedmont\r\ngot the rest--of what, is not stated--presumably, of Italy. This treaty\r\nwas known only to the Emperor, Niel, and Pietri, in France, and in Sardinia\r\nto the King and Cavour. It was afterwards made known to Villa-Marina, on\r\ncondition that he should seem to know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nOn July 8th, 1859, when the Emperor returned to Valeggio from Villafranca,\r\nhe told the King of Sardinia that peace was made. The King said he would\r\nnot accept it, and would continue the war on his own account. The Emperor\r\nshrugged his shoulders and said 'Vous êtes fou.' Afterwards, however, in\r\ntelling the story to the Queen of Holland, he declared that he only said\r\n'Vous êtes absurde.'\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been in conversation with Pourtalès, on January 17th,\r\nthat Reeve picked up this curious story. During the past few years many\r\nState papers at Berlin had been stolen: amongst others, a letter from the\r\nTsar to the King of Prussia, written in the summer of 1855, to the effect\r\nthat Sebastopol could not hold out another month. This was sent to Paris\r\nby Moustier just in time to revive the drooping spirits of the French\r\nGovernment, after the repulse of June 18th.\r\n\r\nSupposing this to be true--as Reeve certainly believed it to be--it was\r\nonly paying off Prussia in her own coin; for at least under Frederick\r\nII.--the Prussian agents had shown a remarkable skill in obtaining secret\r\nintelligence, either by purchase or by theft. In one case, in 1755, ten\r\nimportant papers and the key of the cipher were stolen from the Count de\r\nBroglie, the French ambassador, by his colleague and intimate friend, Count\r\nMaltzahn, the Prussian ambassador, who obtained access to his rooms in his\r\nabsence. 'There is no doubt,' wrote De Broglie, 'that we are indebted for\r\nthis to the King of Prussia. I am quite sure that Maltzahn would not have\r\ndone it without an express order.' [Footnote: Le Secret du Roi, par le Duc\r\nde Broglie, tom. i., p. 131]\r\n\r\n_From Mr. C. C. Greville\r\n\r\nJanuary 15._--I am very glad to hear that Fould has responded with such\r\nalacrity, and I shall be most anxious to hear from you again after your\r\ninterview and dinner with him. I told him in my letter that you had been\r\nacquainted with the Emperor when he resided in England, and I hope he will\r\nreport your arrival to H.M., and that you will be summoned to the imperial\r\npresence; it would be very interesting to have a conversation with the\r\ngreat man himself, and you might enlighten his mind, and correct some\r\nof the erroneous impressions he is likely to have formed from Cobden's\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nSo far as I understand the line taken by our Cabinet, they are acting\r\nproperly enough. I suppose France will want our support for the annexation\r\nof Savoy, and Palmerston will be for giving that, or doing anything else to\r\nobtain the transference of the revolted states and provinces to Piedmont;\r\nthe aggrandisement of Sardinia and the humiliation of Austria being his\r\ndarling objects, for which he will sacrifice every other consideration,\r\nunless he is kept in check, and baffled by the majority of the Cabinet. In\r\nthe beginning of this week there was very near being a split amongst them,\r\nwhich might have broken up the Government; but I conclude matters were\r\nadjusted, though I do not know exactly how. P., J. R., and Gladstone go\r\ntogether, and are for going much further in Italian affairs than the\r\nmajority of the Cabinet will consent to; and, as the latter know very well\r\nthat their views will be supported by public opinion, I trust they will get\r\nthe better of this triple alliance. As Austria appears to have admitted her\r\ninability to draw the sword again, the Pope seems to be left without any\r\nresource; but it does not follow that Austria will consent to such an\r\naggrandisement of the King of Sardinia as France may be willing to consent\r\nto, and, as we shall, I suppose, earnestly advocate. She would probably\r\nmore easily consent to the promotion of a new North Italian kingdom; and I\r\nmuch doubt if Tuscany really wishes for annexation to Piedmont. She would\r\nprobably much prefer the promotion of a fresh state, of which Florence\r\nwould be the capital, and Tuscany the most influential member. How\r\nimpossible it is to form any opinion as to the tortuous, ever-shifting\r\npolicy of L. N.! The only thing we ought never to lose sight of is to keep\r\nquite clear of him, and to be always on our guard. If the natural limits\r\nof France are to be extended again to the Alps, how long will it be before\r\nthey are extended to the Rhine also?\r\n\r\nI went to see Mrs. Austin yesterday, and found her very well and in very\r\nfair spirits; very anxious to talk about him, and much gratified at the\r\nletters she has received from various friends, bearing testimony to his\r\ngreat merits and high qualities, particularly one from Sir William Erle.\r\nBrougham is writing a notice of him for the 'Law Magazine.' She seems very\r\nunsettled in her plans, and says she changes her mind continually. Lady\r\nGordon is better, and Mrs. Austin is going to Ventnor, to her, in a short\r\ntime. She means to be much occupied with the papers he has left, which\r\nappear to be all about law, and it is very doubtful whether they will, if\r\npublished, be very interesting to the world in general.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nWe returned to London on January 23rd. Parliament opened next day. London\r\ndinners began. Dined at Thackeray's, Milman's, Galton's, Lansdowne House.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, February 2nd._--I am much obliged to you for De la Rive's\r\n_brochure_ [Footnote: Le Droit de la Suisse, by William de la Rive, son of\r\nthe celebrated physicist, Auguste] which is written with great force and\r\nspirit; he makes out an excellent European case for the slice of Savoy he\r\nclaims for Switzerland, and he manages to gives an agreeable impression of\r\nthose unpleasant people, the Swiss. It is a valuable work at this moment;\r\nfor the annexation of Savoy to France is a serious affair, not only because\r\nit makes Italy French, but because it is the first step towards the\r\n_remaniement de la carte_.\r\n\r\nWhen we made our first convention with France, on going to war together\r\nwith Russia, I thought it would be prudent to put in a clause that neither\r\nPower should get any benefit for itself from the war. The Emperor accepted\r\nthe proposal cheerfully; said it was a grand precedent, &c. &c.; but when I\r\nread over the convention with Walewski, prior to signature, the clause was\r\nomitted, and I had it restored. In the case of Savoy, we must admit that\r\nour policy makes objection on our part not only difficult but absurd. We\r\nhave been telling the Italians that they were justified in expelling their\r\nrulers and electing a new sovereign, and that treaties could not be\r\npleaded against accomplished facts; and how can we remonstrate against the\r\nannexation of Savoy to France, if V. Emanuel releases the Savoyards from\r\ntheir allegiance, and they elect L. Nap. for their sovereign?\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n62 _Rutland Gate, March 5th._ Since my visit to Paris I have never had a\r\ndoubt that Louis Napoleon was pursuing, and pursuing actively, a scheme for\r\nthe annexation of Savoy, and that nothing which this country can say--for\r\ndoing is out of the question--will have any effect in preventing it. The\r\nKing of Sardinia is the dog and the shadow. He drops his bone to clutch a\r\nphantom of Italian empire, which will dissolve as he approaches it. The\r\nmost amusing part of it is that the policy of his imprudent friends here\r\n(J. R. and so on) has urged him on to pursue the shadow without remembering\r\nwhat it would cost in substance.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Bill is considered so very mild a production that I begin, for\r\nthe first time, to think it will pass. Even the Tories could conceive\r\nnothing so moderate, and they had better close with the bargain. I have\r\nno doubt it will be rather favourable to the Conservatives than to the\r\nRadicals. For example, where there are to be three seats, in the large\r\ntowns, the Conservative minority will probably carry one out of the three.\r\n\r\n_March 14th._--Your volume of scientific tracts arrived just after I had\r\nsent off my last letter. I am very much indebted to you for it, and I shall\r\nprobably have occasion to refer to your learned paper on the cells of bees\r\nin the review I am going to publish of Mr. Darwin's book. As for Newton, I\r\nshould be glad to give my vote in favour of a monument whenever a suitable\r\nopportunity occurs. It is very embarrassing to know where to place\r\nmonuments to men illustrious in letters and science. Westminster Abbey\r\nis crowded, and can take no more statues. We are going to put up a mural\r\nmonument to Hallam there; and, by the way, if you had been in England, you\r\nwere invited to be on the committee; I still hope you will give your name.\r\n\r\nEvents have taken a prodigiously lucky turn for the Government, and I think\r\nit is long since we had any administration so strong as Lord Palmerston now\r\nis. Gladstone's triumph is complete on all points, and people are so weary\r\nof J. R. and his Reform Bill that I think all parties are ready to swallow\r\nthis last dose, _de guerre lasse_. Then will follow the dissolution in the\r\nautumn, and we may expect a strong Liberal majority.\r\n\r\nThe affair of Savoy will pass off quietly enough if he leaves the\r\nneutralised territories to Switzerland; but if not, it will become serious\r\nenough, for it is expressly provided by the final act of the Congress of\r\nVienna that, if Sardinia evacuates those districts, no other Power\r\nbut Switzerland shall move troops into them, and this arrangement was\r\nsubsequently confirmed by a very formal declaration of all the Powers....\r\n\r\nMrs. Austin is making arrangements for a new edition of her husband's\r\nlectures, with considerable additions.\r\n\r\nThe Journal has here:--\r\n\r\n_March 15th._--Dinner at home. The Due d'Aumale, Lavradio, Lady Stanhope,\r\nLady Molesworth, Lady William and Arthur Russell, Lord Kingsdown, the Lord\r\nAdvocate, Professor Owen, Colonel Hamilton, and Colonel Greathed.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_[Sunday] March 18th._--If you happen to be passing Grosvenor Crescent way\r\non Tuesday or Wednesday, about twelve o'clock, will you look in upon me,\r\nand we will have a talk about the awful fix in which Europe in general and\r\nEngland in particular are now placed?\r\n\r\nBy reason of his connexion with Geneva, Reeve had all along necessarily\r\nfelt the keenest interest in the negotiations between France and Sardinia,\r\nwhich he had discussed in an article on 'France, Savoy, and Switzerland'\r\nfor the April number of the 'Edinburgh Review.' He had possibly already\r\nintended to visit the 'debateable land' as soon as the Review was sent to\r\npress, or very possibly the advisability of doing so was suggested in this\r\ninterview with Lord Clarendon. At any rate, on April 4th he started for\r\nParis, and, after seeing his friend Pourtales, went on to Geneva in company\r\nwith Sir Robert and Lady Emily Peel. By the 12th he was back in Paris,\r\nwhere, on the 15th, he had long interviews with Fould and Thouvenel,\r\nthe minister of foreign affairs, the minutes of which he wrote out at\r\nconsiderable length, and two days afterwards read them to Lord Palmerston.\r\nHe reported to Palmerston that Thouvenel was willing to make 'a reasonable\r\nadjustment of the Swiss frontier,' which he believed meant 'an extension\r\nof the Swiss territory to the Fort de l'Ecluse and Saleve.' Palmerston,\r\nhowever, refused the overture, saying, 'We shall shame them out of it.'\r\n'So,' added Reeve, in relating the affair, 'neither he nor the Swiss got\r\nanything at all.'\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 20th._--I hope my account of J. Austin will appear in the\r\n'Law Magazine and Review.' It is written _con amore_, though very far from\r\nsuch an article as I could have wished to make it. The letter of Mrs.\r\nAustin was invaluable, and I inserted her very words in more instances than\r\none; but your mention of the effect produced by the publication now out\r\nof print was still more valuable. I only trust that it may all be printed\r\ncorrectly, for it must be too late for me to have proofs.\r\n\r\nThe roguery of L. N. and Cavour exceeds all belief; but they have cheated\r\none another, and have probably overreached themselves. The _lies_ they\r\ntell about the Nice vote are unheard of even in the time of Napoleon I. We\r\nbelieve here that thousands of Piedmontese having no residence were sent to\r\nvote. However, there is a real majority, though nothing like the unanimity\r\npretended. In Savoy there is entire unanimity. I suppose Normanby believes\r\nthe Tuscans have not voted for their annexation; but he believes whatever\r\nanybody writes to him from Florence.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_C. O., May 16th._--I cannot remember any passage in Macaulay's writings\r\nwhich can be called an attack on Henry V. In the Introduction to the\r\n'History of England' there is a passage in which he speaks of the French\r\nwars of the English kings, and speculates on the results which might have\r\nensued if the conquests of Henry V. had not been lost by Henry VI. Perhaps\r\nthis is what Lord Glenelg meant; but I am writing from the office, where I\r\nhave not the books to refer to.\r\n\r\nI don't know what sort of monument the Lord Chief Baron proposes to erect.\r\nTo put Macaulay on a level with Newton and Bacon would be absurd. His mind\r\nwas essentially what the geologists would call 'a tertiary formation;'\r\ntheirs were 'protogenic.' But I think some monument to Macaulay may very\r\nfitly be placed in Trinity Chapel. We meet on Tuesday to consider what is\r\nto be done for Hallam in Westminster Abbey; but there will certainly be no\r\nstatue, probably a slab and bust only.\r\n\r\nI hope you are coming up for the debate in the Lords on Monday,[Footnote:\r\nOn the repeal of the paper duty, a Government measure, which was rejected\r\nby the Lords.] which will be one of great interest. I cannot think there is\r\nanything solid in the so-called constitutional objection--which is to be\r\nurged on behalf of the Government--to the interference of the House of\r\nLords with a bill of this nature.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_Grosvenor Crescent, May 16th._--Many thanks for your letter and opinion of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle waters, which seem exactly to fit my case, but I should be\r\nvery reluctant to go there just now, as the inconvenience of it would be\r\ngreat. I shall try change of air next week, and, if that won't do, why\r\n_alors, comme alors,_ as the life I am now leading is intolerable. The gout\r\ncame again very sharply last night, but not, I am sure, owing to your most\r\nagreeable dinner, which could only do good. I have not passed three such\r\npleasant hours for a long while.\r\n\r\nI have seen one or two peers to-day sorely puzzled as to the vote they\r\nshall give on Monday. My only doubt is about the damage it may do the House\r\nof Lords; and I can't quite go Lyndhurst's [Footnote: In a closely reasoned\r\nspeech, rightly considered remarkable from a man of eighty-eight, Lord\r\nLyndhurst maintained that it was no unusual thing for the Lords to veto\r\nbills for repealing taxes as well as bills for inflicting them, and quoted\r\nnumerous precedents. The bill was thrown out by 193 to 104.] length,\r\nwho says that if there is no precedent it is high time, and the proper\r\nopportunity, to make one.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here records:--\r\n\r\nMr. Greville resigned the clerkship of the council in May; as Mr. Bathurst\r\ncould not carry on the business, he had to resign too [Footnote: This is\r\nwritten on the blank page of the 'Chronology,' apparently from memory, and\r\nthe dates are somewhat confused. Greville resigned in May 1859. It was then\r\nsettled that there should be but one clerk; Bathurst acted by himself for a\r\ntwelvemonth, and resigned in May 1860.]. It was settled that there should\r\nbe but one clerk of the council. Lord Granville, I believe, wished to\r\nappoint me, but some obstacle stood in the way. I never exactly knew what;\r\nbut if it was the Court, it is singular that I should have been so well\r\nreceived at Balmoral. What I desired was that the registrarship of the P.\r\nC. should become the second clerkship of the council, I offering to do my\r\nshare of the general business; but this they declined. On June 9th Arthur\r\nHelps was appointed clerk of the council. I felt great irritation at the\r\nmanner in which I had been treated; but it certainly turned out very well\r\nfor me in the end, as I continued to hold an easier office, and eventually\r\nobtained the same income, without the annoyance of attending the Court at\r\nBalmoral, or Osborne, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn May 15th we had to dinner Lord Clarendon, Prince Dolgoroukow (the\r\none who wrote the book [Footnote: _La Verité sur la Russie_, 1860. Cf.\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, July 1860, p. 175.] on Russia), Lord Stanley, Sir R.\r\nand Lady E. Peel, Hodgson, and Cornewall Legh.\r\n\r\nOn August 4th we made an expedition from Farnborough, with the Longmans, to\r\nSelborne. Lunch with T. Bell. [Footnote: The editor of White's _Selborne_]\r\nWalked to the Lithe and the Hanger. A charming day.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Brougham, August 5th._--I have been reading the last 'E. R.,' which is a\r\nmost excellent number. The ballot article [Footnote: 'Secret Voting and\r\nParliamentary Reform.'] is admirable, and will prove useful. I may send\r\nyou a few remarks on the G. Rose article. [Footnote: 'Diaries and\r\nCorrespondence of George Rose.'] But I am delighted with the showing up\r\nof Miss Assing, [Footnote: 'Correspondence of Humboldt and Varnhagen von\r\nEnse.' In editing this, Miss Assing had shown--according to the _Review_--a\r\nsingular want of taste and discretion.] only I don't think it is as much as\r\nshe deserves.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_C. O., August 7th._--I have been making short country visits at several\r\nplaces near London since the termination of my Judicial Committee labours,\r\nor I should certainly have called to see you before you left Grafton\r\nStreet. Now I am starting on Saturday next for Aix-la-Chapelle, where I\r\npropose to take a few baths. I return on the 25th, and shall proceed to\r\nAberdeenshire at the end of the month....\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Government last night was very decisive;[Footnote: On\r\nthe motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the reduction of the duty\r\non paper.] and I am heartily glad of it, for the protectionist cry of the\r\npaper-makers took one back before the Deluge.\r\n\r\nI saw Mrs. Austin yesterday at Weybridge, and was glad to find her so well.\r\nShe desired to be remembered to you. She is very busy with J. Austin's\r\nMSS.; but, in fact, they are in perfect order, and might be sent at once to\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Journal--\r\n\r\nLater in August went to Aix. I went over to Bonn to see Bunsen, who was\r\ndying, but full of enthusiasm for Italy. Came home on August 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in August Mrs. Henry Reeve had gone on a visit into Dorsetshire, and\r\nat the time of her husband's return from Aix was in Cornwall--at Pencarrow,\r\nnear Bodmin--on a visit to her old friend, Lady Molesworth. Reeve, thus\r\nleft to himself, started almost immediately for Scotland on a visit to Sir\r\nJames Clark, who, with Lady Clark and his son--the present baronet--was\r\nthen living up Dee-side at Birk Hall, lent him by the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Journal's scanty notices of a very interesting visit can be happily\r\nreplaced by extracts from the letters which he wrote almost daily to his\r\nwife at Pencarrow.\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Henry Reeve_\r\n\r\nBirk Hall, Ballater, September 1st.\r\n\r\nMy dearest wife,--Matters have turned out here very pleasantly. I proceeded\r\nto Aboyne by rail, and then posted along the Dee-side to this place--the\r\nStrath most beautiful; a lovely mixture of wood, water, and heather, with\r\nmountains beyond. I got here just before six, and found the Clarks and Van\r\nde Weyers sitting down to an early dinner in order to go to the Gillies'\r\nBall at Balmoral, in honour of the Prince's birthday, to which I found\r\nmyself also invited. We drove up to the Castle, which is eight miles off,\r\nthrough a fine wooded glen, in the moonlight. The old house of Balmoral has\r\nquite disappeared, and the Castle is now a very fine edifice, decorated in\r\nexcellent taste. On arriving, we waited in the library, where arrived Lady\r\nJohn Russell and her boys, the Farquharsons of Invercauld, young Peel\r\n[Footnote: Robert Kennedy Peel; son of Lady Alice and Colonel Peel, who had\r\nbeen Secretary of State for War in the Derby Ministry of 1858-9.] (Lady\r\nA.'s son), the William Russells, the Duke of Argyll--and then the Court.\r\nNobody was in mourning, as it was a birthday; the Queen in white, with a\r\nfloating sash of Royal Stuart tartan from her shoulders: about half the men\r\nin kilts. The Queen made a circle, and then we went into the ball-room,\r\nwhere about a hundred and fifty of the tenants, servants, &c., with their\r\nwives and daughters, were assembled. Reels then began, which were danced\r\nwith great energy, and also jigs--very droll. Prince Arthur danced like\r\nmad; and Princess Alice was 'weel ta'en out' by the gamekeeper. I stood\r\nin a corner talking with the Duke of Argyll, &c. At last the Prince came\r\nround, and conversed very courteously for ten minutes. He had heard I\r\nhad been in Germany lately, so we soon got into the heart of German and\r\nAustrian questions. All this lasted two hours, and then the Queen withdrew\r\ninto the supper-room, where there were sandwiches and champagne. She went\r\nround again, and talked to Lord Melville, behind whom I was standing, and\r\nthen made me a very gracious bow, but without saying anything to myself.\r\nSoon afterwards we drove home, and got back here at half-past one. To-day\r\nwe are going up to Balmoral again to write our names and see the Castle;\r\nand to-morrow the Queen is coming here to call on Mme. Van de Weyer. I am\r\nrather amused, after divers recent occurrences, to find myself in so much\r\nroyalty, and I had not anticipated any civility from them. But I see\r\nthe Clarks are very kind about it, having had Helps here last week, and\r\nprobably are desirous to remove any misconception which may have existed.\r\nSo that, in fact, nothing can turn out better, and I have certainly no\r\nreason to be dissatisfied with my reception.\r\n\r\nEver yours most affectionately,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\n_Birk Hall, September 4th_.--At last we have got a beautiful day, quite\r\nwarm and bright. Nothing can be more lovely than this Strath of the\r\nDee, with its birch woods and pine-covered mountains. We went up a hill\r\nyesterday--the Coyle--and looked across the glen to the broad snow fields\r\nwhich still encircle the black cliffs of Lochnagar. To-day we are going up\r\nto Alt na Ghuissac, and shall lunch at the Queen's hut. H. M. called here\r\non Sunday, and was remarkably pleasant and jolly. P. Albert drove, with P.\r\nLeiningen on the box; the Queen, Princess Alice, and Princess Leiningen in\r\nthe carriage, and one man on a seat behind. Nothing can be more simple,\r\ncourteous, and even droll, than she is, seen in this way, eating Scotch\r\ncakes, and asking for the 'prescription' to make them, and making Leiningen\r\ntaste the birch wine--which is not bad. To-day they are gone on a wild\r\nexpedition over the hills, and are to sleep in some little inn on the\r\nbrae-side, where the people are supposed not to know who they are. The\r\nQueen will be seven hours on her pony. She rides through all weathers and\r\nover all places, and chaffs everybody for not taking exercise enough.\r\n\r\nI shall leave this on Friday for Braemar--else I should have to appear\r\nat another Balmoral ball--and on Saturday proceed to Keir, where I spend\r\nSunday with Stirling, who is very sorry you are not of the party. On Monday\r\nI go on to the Moncreiffs, at Alva (near Stirling), and on Thursday to\r\nKirklands, making some calls in Edinburgh as I go through.\r\n\r\n_Birk Hall, September 5th_.--The day kept its promise, and was fair to\r\nthe end. We drove up this glen, which is Glen Muich, to the loch which\r\nterminates it, about six miles off. There stands the Queen's hut, with a\r\nfew fir-trees about it. It deserves its name--a small Highland cottage,\r\nwith a room on each side the door and two rooms behind; a little plain\r\nwooden furniture and a Kidderminster carpet. There are two or three other\r\nwooden cottages about for the attendants. Here we lunched--for everybody\r\nlunches in this royal region; and then mountain ponies to go up to the Dhu\r\nLoch, about 1,200 feet higher--very wild, grand scenery, and a very rough,\r\nboggy path, on which Van de Weyer's contortions were very droll. Madame\r\nstayed under the royal honeysuckles below.\r\n\r\nI suppose Hopie and I shall go to Raith on the 15th, if they can take us\r\nin. At any rate, we shall leave Kirklands on that day; but our movements\r\ncannot be quite fixed till we hear.\r\n\r\n_Braemar, September 7th_.--Very fortunately I have had magnificent weather\r\njust when I wanted it. Clark gave me two good days of shooting on the hill\r\non Wednesday and yesterday; we got about ten brace each day, and I had a\r\nfamous hard walk. This morning I came on here by the Queen's private road\r\nthrough Balmoral and Invercauld. The scenery is wonderfully beautiful; and,\r\nif it were not for my love of the sea, I should admit that Braemar is the\r\nfinest thing in Scotland. I have been up the glen this afternoon, past Mar\r\nLodge, to the Linn of Dee--a fine cascade through rocks; the water is so\r\nclear that you can see the rocks under it, and wild blasted pines growing\r\nall round. I was sorry to leave Birk Hall. The Clarks are admirable hosts,\r\nand made their house most agreeable.... You will have lamented, as I do,\r\nthe untimely cutting off of our poor friend, the late Lord High--I mean\r\nWard. [Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. p. 314.] There seems to be a fatality\r\nabout Madras. _Somme toute_, the more I see of the chances of life, the\r\nmore I am persuaded that, as my lot has been cast on such small but easy\r\ncushions, I ought to be perfectly content.\r\n\r\nThe Queen came back on Wednesday night in high glee with her lark over the\r\nhills to Grantown. [Footnote: The Queen's account of this 'lark over the\r\nhills' is in _Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands_ (8vo.\r\n1868), pp. 189-203.] They slept at a very little Highland inn, and were\r\nwaited on by the maid only. The beds were awful, for they could not stand\r\nthe feather bed, and, that being thrown aside, nothing soft remained\r\nbeneath. General Grey found it so hard that he got up and put on his\r\nclothes to lie in. However, they were in high glee, and were not found out\r\ntill they went away in the morning, when the man of the house said, 'Gin\r\nI'd known it was the Queen, I'd hae put on my Sunday claiths and waited on\r\nher mysel'.' They gave the Highland lassie a 5 £. note, at which she nearly\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nI hope by this time to-morrow I shall be at Keir. I am here at a little\r\nHighland inn for to-night, but not so ill off as H. M. I shall have to post\r\nto Blairgowrie to-morrow to get there in time for the train.\r\n\r\n_Keir, near Dunblane, September 9th_.--I left Braemar yesterday morning\r\nat 6 A.M.; posted across the Grampians by a very wild pass; reached the\r\nrailroad at Blairgowrie, and came on here in the afternoon. The first\r\nperson I found in the hall was Motley. His wife and Lily arrived in the\r\nevening. Mrs. Norton, the Wyses, and Sir James Campbell also here. A most\r\npleasant party to fall into, and your absence very much regretted. Keir is\r\nmore beautiful than ever, and glorious in this fine weather which floods\r\nthe Carse of Stirling with light. It really does seem as if the harvest\r\nwould pick itself up after all.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed to Alva to-morrow, and to Kirklands on Wednesday. I don't\r\nyet know whether the Fergusons can receive us on the 15th. If they can,\r\nwe shall go to Raith on that day, and return to London from Edinburgh by\r\nsea.... At any rate, I expect to be in London either on Friday, 21st, or\r\nMonday, 24th--I'm not quite sure which. I suppose, if you don't go to\r\nSaltram, you will come up about the same time. There will be a good many\r\nthings to look after and think of for the Spanish expedition. I am up to my\r\nneck here in Stirling's Spanish books.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am a year older to-day than I was yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records that he returned to London on September 22nd.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_Wiesbaden, September 14th._--I have been idle and absent at Baden, or I\r\nshould sooner have answered your letter and told you with what pleasure we\r\nwill execute your commission. [Footnote: See _post_, p. 54.] I was very\r\nsorry to have missed you here, though it would have been but a glimpse, as\r\nyou were going next morning. I shall hope to see you before you start on\r\nyour enviable Spanish tour, as I mean to go home as soon as my cure\r\nis complete, for Lady C. feels Alice's absence, [Footnote: Lady Alice\r\nVilliers, married on August 16th, 1860, to Lord Skelmersdale, created Earl\r\nof Lathom in 1880. She was accidentally killed by the overturning of her\r\ncarriage on November 23rd, 1897.] and is lonely with only two children out\r\nof six.\r\n\r\nI passed two very pleasant days at Baden with the Aug. Loftuses and the\r\nPrincess of Prussia, who is domiciled there, and we returned last night.\r\n\r\n_The Grove, September 30th_.--I returned here last night without touching\r\nat Grosvenor Crescent. If I had gone there, I should have been at home ten\r\nminutes within the twenty hours from Paris, which is a fair rate of speed\r\nwhen one remembers that in pre-railway days one travelled hard and got\r\nshaken much to arrive at Paris in three days; and in pre-steamer times I\r\nwas once eighteen hours in getting from Calais to Dover. Yet people are not\r\nsatisfied; and Rothschild told me he was bullied by everybody about the\r\nslowness of the Ligne du Nord.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you, as I cannot go to\r\nLondon to-morrow, and from Tuesday till Friday we are engaged to the\r\nJohn Thynnes. In the improbable event of your charming expedition being\r\npostponed, we should be quite delighted if you and Mrs. and Miss Reeve\r\nwould come here on Saturday.\r\n\r\nAs it is now nearly twenty-two years since I left Spain (how time flies!),\r\nnew generations have sprung up of whom I know nothing. There are two\r\npersons--Mme. de Montijo and Olozaga [Footnote: Reeve had known him as the\r\nSpanish ambassador in Paris fifteen years.]--who I should have liked you\r\nto see as social and political _ciceroni_; but the former is at Paris, in\r\nthe deepest affliction at the death of her daughter, and the latter is just\r\ngone to Italy, as I heard two days ago from Howden. Of course you know that\r\nclever, agreeable little fellow Comyn, who was _chargé d'affaires_ here,\r\nand is now under-secretary at the F.O. in Madrid? If not, I will send you a\r\nletter to him.\r\n\r\nI wound up at Wiesbaden by a severe attack of gout, which seemed to please\r\nmy Esculapius more than it did me; for when I showed him my misshapen\r\nscarlet claw of a foot, he rubbed his hands and said, 'Oh dat is a\r\nbeautiful manifest podagra.' It came just at the same time as the\r\nSkelmersdales, and prevented my going about with them. Wasn't that just\r\nlike the gout?\r\n\r\nI never doubted that as soon as the guerillero business was over and civil\r\norganisation began, Garibaldi would prove a mischievous, spoiled child....\r\nThe French Government and their friends want the Pope to remain at Rome,\r\nthinking that _la France Catholique_ would resent his evasion, as a proof\r\nof mistrust of the Emperor; but the Emperor wants him to go; as he would\r\nthen withdraw his garrison and let Rome take its chance, which he thinks\r\nwould close his accounts with the followers of Orsini; and he dislikes\r\nhaving to reinforce his garrison, which he must do if the Pope decides on\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\nI have brought the amethyst beads you desired to have for Mme. Van de\r\nWeyer, and I dare say somebody will be going up to-morrow or next day by\r\nwhom I can send them to you. The man wanted rather more than 5 £ for them,\r\nbut on my walking away from his shop, he, of course, gave them for that\r\nsum.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Brougham, October 1st_.--We have all here been greatly disappointed at not\r\nhaving seen you and our kinswoman,[Footnote: Miss Reeve, Brougham's second\r\ncousin twice removed. Through the Robertsons, Brougham and John Richardson\r\nwere second cousins.] and I believe we have little chance now, as you\r\ntalked of going abroad as soon as your quarterly labours were over. We\r\nshall be here the whole month; then take our southward flight....\r\n\r\nIf you can find an opportunity of noticing my volume on the Constitution\r\nwhich is to appear in November, it would be very serviceable to the\r\npublisher. It is only a reprint of that part of the 'Political Philosophy,'\r\nand lays down true and sound principles--at this time necessary to be well\r\nlearnt.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, October 2nd_.--I am extremely obliged to you for the copy\r\nof your Glasgow address, which in some degree consoles me for not having\r\nheard it, and for having lost the pleasure of seeing you this year at\r\nBrougham. Nothing can be more felicitous than some of the illustrations you\r\nhave introduced, and the occasion of a mere scientific meeting has been\r\nturned to the best political purpose. No doubt in that region the absence\r\nof party gives a broader and a nobler aim to the exertions of your society,\r\nand it is gratifying to see how heartily men meet to combine, in these\r\ndays, without party badges. But if this opinion were to be expressed by the\r\n'Edinburgh Review,' we should be told by John Russell & Co. that we have\r\nno business to wear blue and buff, which is the final cause of reviews and\r\neditors.\r\n\r\nThe political article which I have just sent to the press is on the United\r\nStates under Mr. Buchanan--a great show-up of that scandalous scene of\r\ncorruption, slave-trading, and anarchy. I am afraid it is now too late to\r\nintroduce an allusion to your discourse. As to home politics, there is\r\nlittle to be said; as to Continental affairs, there is too much. The\r\nmountebanks in Southern Italy have now very nearly upset the coach, and the\r\nquestion is whether the Sardinians or the French are to march to Naples. I\r\nhope it will be the former, but it is quite clear Louis Napoleon means to\r\nsupport the Pope in Rome.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon is just come back from Wiesbaden. We start on Saturday for\r\nMadrid, _via_ Valencia, and shall be about six weeks in Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nAnd so they started--Reeve, his wife, and daughter--Reeve, as usual,\r\nnoting merely the stages of the tour, trusting to his wife to fill in\r\nthe details. Extracts from Mrs. Reeve's Journal are here given in square\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\n_Journal_\r\n\r\n_October 8th_.--We started for Spain by Paris, Lyons, and Marseilles.\r\nSailed in the 'Céphise' for Valencia on the 10th.\r\n\r\n_11th_.--[Hopie and I came on deck soon after eight. We spent the day lying\r\ndown, and only caught glimpses of the coast of Spain when a roll of the\r\n'Céphise' brought land and sea above the line of her sides.]\r\n\r\n_12th_.--[About 4 A.M. the wind changed, and we were able to use sail,\r\nwhich steadied the vessel, besides assisting her progress. I went on deck\r\nat nine, found the Mediterranean more like my 'Caire' experience, and was\r\ntold that we should probably be at Grao by twelve.... Henry has set up an\r\nacquaintance with a Mexican who knows a little of England and English, and\r\nis going to pass the winter at Valencia. About one o'clock we were in the\r\nharbour of Grao. We landed in boats, and found ourselves surrounded by\r\na crowd of clamorous porters and _tartana_ drivers--one of the scenes\r\ncharacteristic of landing in a country where police regulations do not\r\nexist ensued. However, Henry's Mexican acquaintance came to his rescue, and\r\ntwo courteous Gauls to mine. They were taking the French despatches into\r\nValencia, and offered Hopie and me seats in their _tartana_--a covered cart\r\nnot on springs, which is the cab of the country. We joyfully accepted,\r\nleaving Henry to struggle through custom-house and other difficulties as\r\nbest he could. The drive (into Valencia) is about two miles, part shaded by\r\nan avenue and carefully watered by men stationed at intervals, who ladled\r\nthe water in buckets out of the runlets on each side of the road. We took\r\nup our quarters at the Fonda de Paris, and congratulated each other on\r\nhaving arrived in Spain.]\r\n\r\n_13th_.--[We went out at eight o'clock. Our first point was the market,\r\nwhich we found in full activity. Such supplies of fruit and vegetables can\r\nonly be found in a city surrounded by leagues of _huerta_.... We went to\r\nthe _plateria_, but found the shops poor, and the articles displayed were\r\ncoarse and ill-wrought. We visited the churches of St. Martin, St. John,\r\nand the cathedral, and ascended the tower _del Miguelete_. The churches are\r\nso dark that it is quite impossible to distinguish the pictures, much less\r\nto judge of their beauty. The panorama from the tower is most beautiful:\r\nthe city and plain of Valencia, the Mediterranean and the encircling\r\nmountains, the fertile _huerta_, and the glorious sky of deepest blue\r\nabove....\r\n\r\nPlacards of a bull-fight on the morrow caught our eyes; and Hopie and I,\r\ntaking the bull by the horns, declared our intention of going to it, and\r\nsuggested that places should be taken. After a very feeble resistance,\r\nHenry consented, and our _valet-de-place_ was directed to ascertain the\r\nprice of a box.]\r\n\r\n_14th_.--[The price asked for a box being too high, we took reserved seats,\r\nand at two o'clock started on foot.... The Plaza de Toros at Valencia is a\r\nnew building, only completed this year; it holds twenty thousand persons,\r\nand is the largest in Spain.... 'El Tato' is the second _matador_ of Spain:\r\nhe is a well-looking and remarkably well-grown young man, and a well-grown\r\nfigure is set off to great advantage by the dress. The horses used are only\r\nfit for the knacker's yard; they are contracted for at about six pounds\r\neach; on this occasion thirteen or fourteen were killed. As regards the\r\nhorses, it is a cruel and disgusting sight; but as between the bull and the\r\n_matador_, the display of courage, eye and presence of mind, as well as of\r\nskill and agility, is most interesting and exciting.] We saw 'El Tato' kill\r\nsix bulls.... [At dinner our conversation turned on the sight of the day.\r\n'Tableau de moeurs espagnoles,' said a Frenchman, raising his shoulders.\r\n'In Peru, where I have seen many bull-fights,' he went on, 'they use\r\nhigh-spirited and valuable horses, and the _picador_ would be for ever\r\ndisgraced if he allowed the bull to touch his horse.']\r\n\r\n_15th_. [From Valencia to Madrid is 308 miles; the time from 4 P.M. to 6.20\r\nA.M., and our train was pretty punctual.]\r\n\r\n_16th_.--Saw Isabella and her Court enter Madrid. She was shot at [by a\r\nfoolish, half-witted lad, who did not know how to load his pistol, and had\r\nno motive for the crime, or rather attempt]. Delighted with the gallery.\r\n[There are a few seats and no visitors; and the wisest thing travellers can\r\ndo, and by far the pleasantest, is to spend all the hours of all the\r\ndays they are in Madrid that the gallery is open in contemplating its\r\ntreasures.]\r\n\r\n_17th_.--[Immediately after breakfast, Hopie and I went to the Museum.\r\nHenry joined us presently, and we remained till four o'clock.]\r\n\r\n_18th, Thursday_.--[We had intended to make the Toledo excursion to-day,\r\nbut an undoubted attack of gout confines Henry to the sofa. Hopie and I\r\nwalked before breakfast to the Church of the Atocha, where we were shown\r\n... in a wardrobe in the vestry, the crimson velvet robe which Isabella had\r\non when the Curé Merino stabbed her. [Footnote: On her way to the church,\r\nFebruary 2nd, 1852. The priest, a Franciscan, was garotted in due course.]\r\nIt has the stain of blood on the lining; the massive embroidery in gold\r\nsaved her life by turning aside the knife.... After breakfast we took a\r\nwalk through the unfashionable parts of the town: narrow streets, noisy\r\nand crowded, where open stores with bright-coloured scarfs and petticoats\r\ncollected round them men in the peasant dress--short jackets, breeches, and\r\ngaiters partly open. These were picturesque, but the streets and houses\r\nwere uninteresting enough.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Madrid is the least interesting capital in\r\nEurope, and that it is only worth the traveller's while to go there for the\r\nsake of the pictures.... It is settled that we leave Madrid on Saturday\r\nevening, and Henry has therefore consented to our going to Toledo tomorrow\r\nwithout him.]\r\n\r\n_19th_,--[Excursion to Toledo, fifty-six miles by rail.]\r\n\r\n_20th, Saturday_.--[After dinner started for Granada, where, after\r\nthirty-six hours (rail and diligence), we arrived on Monday morning.]\r\n\r\n_27th, Saturday_.--[At 6 P.M. we stow ourselves in the interior of the\r\ndiligence, and pound along the dusty road towards Santa Fé. It is dusk\r\nbefore we get there, and dark after.]\r\n\r\n_28th, Sunday_.--[From Granada to Malaga is seventy-six miles. Guards\r\nare not only stationed along the road, but two or three are taken on the\r\ndiligence. The roads were not good; we seemed to be crossing a series of\r\nsierras, and when day dawned, after a fresh, almost cold night, we found\r\nourselves amid ghaut-like hills, and wondered when the topmost point would\r\nbe gained and the descent to Malaga begun. I think it is at Fuente de la\r\nReina that the magnificent view of the Mediterranean, the port and city\r\nof Malaga, and the long perspective of zigzags down spurs of mountains is\r\nseen. Neither the French nor English Handbook speaks of this view with\r\nthe enthusiasm it deserves. It is far finer than the view on the heights\r\nlooking down on Trieste and the Adriatic.... We entered Malaga about 10\r\nA.M.; the descent had taken about two hours.]\r\n\r\n_29th_.--[Very early it was announced that an unexpected boat had come in,\r\nand was going on to Cadiz.... At 2 P.M. we went on board... but she did not\r\nsteam till six. We should have been very irate at the delay but for the\r\nremarkably good dinner they gave us.... We made a détour and went very slow\r\nat starting, to avoid a vessel sunk in the harbour, on which a provisional\r\npharo is placed. This vessel, the 'Genova,' had on board shells and powder\r\nfor the Morocco war, when it was discovered that spontaneous combustion had\r\nbroken out in the coal--a defect of Spanish coal--and, fearing she would\r\nnot only blow up herself but also the city of Malaga, they determined to\r\nsink her; and, after a deal of bad practice by the guns of fort and fleet,\r\nshe went under water, and there she has been eight months.]\r\n\r\n_30th_.--[Cadiz. On the 31st crossed over to Puerto Santa Maria; and on\r\nNovember 1st to Seville by rail.]\r\n\r\n_November 2nd_.--[Henry has again a threatening of gout, and must have\r\nrecourse to rest and remedial measures. He sent us out to buy the works of\r\n'Fernan Caballero;' but only one volume was to be had, and no explanation\r\nwas given us of the strange fact that the writings of the most popular\r\nnovelist in Spain are not to be obtained in the capital of Andalusia,\r\nwhere she lives, and whence all her characters and scenery are taken.\r\nNo satisfactory map or guide-book of Seville could be found. I took a\r\ncatalogue of the books that the shop contained back to Henry. They were\r\nchiefly of a religious character. Hopie and I took an exploring walk as far\r\nas the Plaza and Church of San Lorenzo, stopping now and then to peep into\r\nthe cool _patios_ filled with flowers, and a murmuring fountain often in\r\nthe middle, which you see through the corridor, sometimes with a door of\r\niron trellis, sometimes open. All the windows of the basement have iron\r\ngratings and wooden shutters; and the courting and sweethearting is carried\r\non with the lady inside and the lover outside the railing. Not that we saw\r\nanything of the kind as it takes place of an evening; but the construction\r\nof the houses explains the descriptions as given in these charming tales of\r\n'Fernan Caballero.']\r\n\r\n_3rd_.--[Hopie and I set out to 'do churches'... After breakfast to the\r\nMuseum.... We then joined Henry, who was better, and had been to call at\r\nthe Palace, and drove to Alfarache, about four miles' distance.]\r\n\r\n_4th_.--[In the afternoon to Cordova (eighty-one miles), returning to\r\nSeville on the evening of the 5th.]\r\n\r\n_6th_.--[A decidedly grey day, unfortunately for our plans of\r\npicture-seeing. We did a little shopping... and then went to the Museum;\r\nbut, alas! there was not more light than you would have in Trafalgar\r\nSquare; and those Murillos at a distance from the window were scarcely\r\nvisible. We were so vexed on Henry's account. We spent the afternoon in\r\nwriting letters, bathing our faces with milk, and hoping the mosquito\r\nbites, which have driven us well-nigh distracted, will be less conspicuous\r\nto-morrow, when we are to spend the morning at the Palace, and be presented\r\nto the Infanta.]\r\n\r\n_7th_.--[Nine o'clock was the hour named by the Duke, and a few minutes\r\nafter we were at the Palace of San Telmo (in bonnets and our tidiest\r\ndresses). We were shown into a room on the ground floor, and in a few\r\nseconds the Duc de Montpensier [Footnote: For the circumstances of the Duc\r\nde Montpensier's marriage, see _ante_, vol. i. p. 181.] came in attended by\r\nan A.D.C. He received us very graciously, asked if we would drive or walk\r\nround the grounds, and said he thought we had better see the gardens first,\r\nand then the house and pictures.... Our promenade, with an occasional rest,\r\ntook nearly two hours; and then, returning to the Palace, H.R.H. showed us\r\nthe state rooms and the pictures, many of great beauty and merit, all very\r\ninteresting; and then, suggesting we should like to take off our bonnets,\r\ndesired the A.D.C. to show us rooms.... A servant waiting outside the door\r\nshowed us into a drawing-room upstairs, where we found two ladies of the\r\nInfanta's suite, and an old marquis, whose gold key showed he was the\r\nchamberlain. In a few minutes the double doors of a larger room were thrown\r\nopen, and 'los Duques' and the four Infantas, their daughters, came in....\r\nWhen the _dejeuner dinatoire_ was announced, the Duke told Henry to offer\r\nhis arm to the Duchess, then he advanced towards me, the chamberlain took\r\nHopie, the children and the suite followed. We were eighteen at table. ...\r\nServants stood behind us with paper flappers, whisking away the flies, who\r\nswarmed round the sweet dishes on the table; and H.R.H. complaining of _les\r\nmouches_, I ventured to complain of _les moustiques_. He smiled, and said,\r\n'I noticed that you had been victimised.' Breakfast was very gay and\r\nagreeable; the Duke has the family talent for conversation, and the Duchess\r\nis very amiable, and of course speaks French. She wore a high, plain silk\r\ndress of the prevailing colour, and a black chenille net. The Infantas had\r\nblack silk skirts with a broad piece of black velvet at the bottom, and\r\nwhite piqué shirts. We left the table in the same order as before, and,\r\nafter a few minutes in the salon, the Duke took Henry into his private\r\nroom. The Duchess requested us to be seated, and asked us questions about\r\nour tour, &c.... and then, rising, she said Adieu, and left the room. The\r\nDuke took us to the large library on the ground floor, to show us the\r\nalbums and other things of interest.... There was an interesting portrait\r\nof an elderly lady in a black dress and mantilla, which H.R.H. pointed out\r\nas being that of the lady who writes under the name of 'Fernan Caballero;'\r\nand on Henry's mentioning that we had tried in vain to purchase her novels,\r\nhe desired the librarian to see whether there were duplicate copies, and,\r\non hearing there were, gave us a set, as well as a coloured lithograph of\r\nthe Palace and photographs of the Duchess, himself, and the princesses....\r\nIt was altogether a most interesting and agreeable morning, and we came\r\naway charmed with the courtesy and kindness of 'los Duques.']\r\n\r\n_9th_.--Back to Cadiz; very stormy voyage to Lisbon. Home to Southampton,\r\nNovember 22nd.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, December 6th_.--I was glad to get your letter, as I thought you\r\nmust be due about this time, and I had not heard of your arrival. I can\r\nimagine no change for the worse equal to that of coming from the blue sky\r\nand thermometer of Andalusia to the fogs and hydrometer of London, and your\r\nimpaired respiratory organs must make that change peculiarly pleasant.\r\n\r\nI am very glad your impressions of Spain are the same as Granville's.\r\nHe raves of the things he has seen, and of the good hotels and general\r\ncivility; and says he tasted no garlic since he dined at the Maison Dorée\r\nat Paris. Spain must indeed be changed since my time!\r\n\r\nWe returned from Ashridge [Footnote: The seat of Lord Brownlow.] this\r\nafternoon, and are off again next week. Paterfamilias is obliged to drink\r\nthe cup of gaiety to the dregs, which is almost worse than being in office.\r\n\r\nPray remember us very kindly to Mrs. Reeve. As soon as we are free agents,\r\nwe shall hope for the pleasure of seeing you here.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_C. O., December 10th_. I have not the slightest intention of plunging at\r\npresent into the turbid waters of Indian finance, still less of engaging in\r\nthe personal controversy of Trevelyan's merits or grievances.... I am not\r\nsure that his view of extensive reduction is not, in reality, more rational\r\nand possible than Wilson's view of extensive taxation. Probably, however,\r\nboth will be needed before we have done. But I suspend my judgement on the\r\nquestion, and I shall not venture to discuss it in the 'Review' at present.\r\n\r\nWe returned from Spain and Portugal a few days after you had the kindness\r\nto call in Rutland Gate. I proceeded immediately to call on you in Grafton\r\nStreet, but you had already gone north. Since then I have been unceasingly\r\noccupied at the Judicial Committee. Our journey was very successful and\r\nagreeable. We coasted round the whole peninsula, and went up to Madrid,\r\nGrenada, Seville, Cordova, &c.\r\n\r\nThe changes taking place in France are (if sincere) most remarkable. My\r\nfriends think that one of L. N.'s objects is to have a debate on his\r\nforeign policy and his relations with Italy, which--as he well knows--will\r\nbe extremely adverse to the Italian cause, and afford him a pretext for\r\nabandoning Victor Emanuel. There is some idea that when Francis II.\r\nevacuates Gaëta, he will surrender it, not to Victor Emanuel, but to\r\nFrance. I expect this affair in Southern Italy to end by a Muratist\r\ndemonstration; in other words, the Neapolitans will place themselves under\r\nthe protection of France to escape from the Piedmontese.... Thank God, your\r\nnamesake and my friend, Henry Brougham Loch,[Footnote: Now Lord Loch,\r\nthen secretary to Lord Elgin, in China. He and Harry Parkes had been\r\ntreacherously seized by the Chinese on September 18th, and kept in vilest\r\ndurance and imminent danger of being put to death till October 8th, when,\r\nafter the capture of the Summer Palace, both the prisoners were released.]\r\nis safe. We have been very uneasy about him, and not without cause. The\r\nChina war is a slough of despond: the further we advance the more we shall\r\nflounder, until we are half ruined by our successes.\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, December 24th_.--I have shut myself up for some days, to\r\ntry to get rid of an irritation in the larynx, which has troubled me for\r\nsome time past; but in this weather one's library is the most secure\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, January 3rd_.--I see the Court of Queen's Bench in Canada\r\nhas decided in favour of the extradition of the fugitive slave who turned\r\nand slew his pursuer. This surprises me; for surely, by our law, such an\r\nact is not murder. What, however, interests me most is to know whether the\r\ncase can be brought up to the Privy Council by way of appeal. I do not\r\nknow what form the proceedings in Canada have taken; but I apprehend the\r\nproceedings are civil, not criminal, and therefore appealable. If it does\r\ncome here, it will be a matter of great interest.\r\n\r\nThe reference is to the celebrated case of John Anderson--or Jack--a negro\r\nof Missouri, who, in 1853, had been met by one Diggs, a white man, thirty\r\nmiles away from his home. In accordance with the laws of the State, Diggs\r\nattempted to seize him. Anderson killed Diggs, and--by 'the underground\r\nrailway'--made good his escape to Canada, where he had lived ever since.\r\nIn 1860 he had been recognised, and, on formal application for his\r\nextradition, he had been arrested. The Court of Queen's Bench in Canada\r\naccepted the argument that they had to decide only as to the evidence of\r\nthe commission of the crime, not as to the nature of it, and remanded the\r\nprisoner. In England the excitement was very great. The Secretary of State\r\nsent out an order that Anderson was not to be given up without instructions\r\nfrom him; and the Court of Queen's Bench sent out a writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, directing the man to be brought before it. But meanwhile an\r\napplication for a writ of _habeas corpus_ had been made to the Court\r\nof Common Pleas in Canada, and the prisoner had been discharged on the\r\ntechnical ground that he was not charged with any crime included in the\r\nExtradition Treaty, as, for instance, murder; for the indictment was that\r\nhe did 'wilfully, maliciously and feloniously stab and kill, &c.,' words\r\nwhich meant, inferentially, manslaughter; and manslaughter was not\r\nrecognised by the treaty.[Footnote: See _Annual Register_, 1831, part ii.\r\np. 520.]\r\n\r\nThe Journal here mentions the awfully sudden death of a friend of many\r\nyears' standing:--\r\n\r\n_January 8th_.--The Frederick Elliots and Marochettis dined with us. There\r\nwas a frost, and torches on the Serpentine. Mrs. F. Elliot drove round to\r\nsee it, and went home and died in the night [of a spasm of the heart. The\r\nnews reached Reeve by a note from Mr. Elliot, dated seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning].\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Twisleton_\r\n\r\nBonchurch, January 24th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 18th\r\ninstant, which has been forwarded to me here. I am sorry to say that I\r\nhave so much on my hands at present that I could not undertake to write an\r\narticle on American affairs; though I am equally obliged to you for the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nI lament what has taken place in the United States. Although, in a narrow\r\npolitical sense, a disruption may be useful to England, in another point of\r\nview it is a misfortune, inasmuch as the maintenance of one confederation\r\nduring seventy-two years, over such a vast extent of territory, with no\r\ncivil war, and only two foreign wars, is the greatest thing which the\r\nEnglish race has done out of England, and its dissolution is sure to be\r\nviewed with pleasure by all who in their hearts hate free institutions and\r\nthe English race.\r\n\r\nSince Brown's attempt to excite an insurrection of the slaves in Virginia,\r\nI have thought it impossible to avoid a civil war, if the anti-slavery\r\nfeeling in the North went on increasing in intensity, as I have known it\r\nto increase during the last ten years; but I had not the most distant idea\r\nthat Lincoln's election would lead to immediate secession on the part of\r\neven a single state. In the north of the Union they have been absolutely\r\ntaken by surprise, and have hardly yet made up their minds as to the course\r\nthey will pursue. If Congress had merely to deal with South Carolina, it\r\ncould easily checkmate that one state; but the difficulty arises from the\r\n_number_ of states, which either side with South Carolina or will not act\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\nI have the highest respect for Tocqueville's opinion; but I do not happen\r\nto remember what he has written respecting secession. I well understand the\r\ndifficulty for a confederation if any one state has a settled permanent\r\ndetermination to secede from it. But, under the constitution, Congress has\r\nample powers to levy the federal revenue and maintain the laws of the\r\nUnion in South Carolina--and to pass all laws necessary for this purpose.\r\nMoreover, everyone in the Union who levies war against the United States\r\nGovernment is guilty of treason, and there is no recognition in the\r\nconstitution of any right in any state to secede from the Union. Under\r\nthese circumstances, everyone in South Carolina caught in arms against the\r\nfederal Government is liable to be hanged. With such laws and powers, an\r\nunited Congress and a resolute president, like General Jackson, would soon\r\nreduce South Carolina to submission; and my belief is that the same might\r\nbe the case if there were a league against the Union of the cotton states\r\nalone. For a time Congress would baffle such a league quite as effectually\r\nas the Swiss Confederation put down the Sonderbund.\r\n\r\nPray give my kind regards to Mrs. Reeve. I expect to be in London at the\r\nend of next week, and I shall be happy to communicate and receive ideas on\r\nAmerican politics. The critical point at present is the course which will\r\nbe pursued by Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nEDWARD TWISLETON.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_February 26th_.--Dined with the Apponyis, now Austrian ambassador; Duchess\r\nof Wellington, Clarendon, Lewis, Lady Westmorland, and Mme. de Bury, who\r\nwas in great favour at Vienna.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, March 1st_.--Never was a session opened with so little\r\ninterest. I believe it is quite true that the Tories are resolved to\r\n_ménager_ Palmerston as much as possible, and to enter into no hostile\r\ncombinations against him with the Radicals. In fact, Palmerston is gaining\r\nground with the Conservatives, and losing it with some sections of the\r\nLiberals. He has exasperated the Irish Catholics to the last degree; and\r\nfor my own part, I think his language and conduct about Mr. Turnbull's\r\nresignation highly discreditable. It is another specimen of the unhappy\r\ninfluence of Shaftesbury's ignorance and bigotry. However, the practical\r\nresult is that the Government have lost Cork by a large majority, and that\r\nat the next election there will hardly be a ministerial candidate returned\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to see that the general tendency of the public mind in\r\nthis country is rather towards conservatism than reform. Even the reformers\r\nare compelled to haul down their bill; and if the Tories had better men to\r\nfill the offices, I think they would, in two or three years, have a fair\r\nchance of regaining power and keeping it.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, the bishops seem to be the most eager combatants; in\r\nFrance they are denouncing the Emperor [Footnote: In January 1860 Reeve was\r\ntold in Paris that the Pope spoke of him as the beast of the Apocalypse.]\r\nas Pontius Pilate; in England they are thirsting for the blood of a few\r\nheterodox parsons. Nothing is talked of here but 'Essays and Reviews.' In\r\nmy humble opinion they by no means deserve the importance attached to them,\r\neither in point of style or in point of substance.\r\n\r\nKeep my secret, but I have in preparation a regular mine under Eton\r\nCollege. There has been of late a good deal of discussion about it, with\r\nvery little knowledge. Fortunately, I have lighted upon the evidence taken\r\nby you before your celebrated committee in 1818, all which is still quite\r\napplicable. Eton is very little improved, and the depredations of the\r\nFellows go on with shameless audacity. I mention this to you because your\r\ncommittee has been of so much use to us; but I wish to keep the thing very\r\nquiet till the next number of the 'Review' makes its appearance.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, March 4th_.--It is very odd that for two or three days I had been\r\nreading and discussing with one or two Eton men here the subject on which\r\nyou propose to do infinite service, but of course I shall not even drop\r\nthe most remote allusion to your plan. The conduct at Eton is perfectly\r\nscandalous; our two boys never cost less than 200 £. a year while they were\r\nthere; and I believe the case is understated, and not overstated, in the\r\n'Cornhill Magazine,' and other places. One of the men who spoke to me about\r\nit said it was no fault of mine, but of Eldon, that it had not all been set\r\nright forty years ago--alluding to the Education Commission to which you\r\nrefer. I recollect being reluctantly forced to insert the exemption in the\r\nAct and in the commission of inquiry. He had opposed the whole bill, and\r\nwe defeated him in the Lords when he attempted to throw it out--a very\r\nextraordinary event in those days. But Rosslyn, Holland, and others who had\r\ncharge of the bill, were apprehensive of being beaten on a further stage if\r\nwe held out on the exemptions. In 1819 (the year after) I endeavoured to\r\nremove the exemptions in the Extensions Act to all charities, and this gave\r\nrise to Peel's very shabby attack on the whole inquiry when I was very\r\nunwell, and wholly unprepared, and to my defence in the speech which I have\r\noften said I could not now make if I would, and would not if I could. I\r\nventure to refer to it, however, as the most remarkable I ever made in all\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nWhen you have sprung your mine, I hope and trust the 'Quarterly' will\r\nfollow your example. If Elwin was still in command I feel confident he\r\nwould, for he has always joined against Eldon & Co. I highly approve your\r\nkeeping it quite secret on every account.\r\n\r\nHere the Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_April 9th_.--I was elected a member of 'The Club,' in place of Lord\r\nAberdeen--proposed by Lord Stanhope; the greatest social distinction I ever\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThis was the literary club founded in 1764 by Reynolds and Johnson, which,\r\nin the course of years, had dropped all extraneous title, and become simply\r\nThe Club. 'It still continues the most famous of the dining societies of\r\nLondon, and in the 133 years of its existence has perhaps seen at its\r\ntables more men of note than any other society.'[Footnote: _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, April 1897, p. 291.] Gibbon, who became a member of it in 1774,\r\nhad suggested the form in which a new member was to be apprised of the\r\ndistinction conferred on him. This has continued in use to the present\r\nday, and on April 9th, 1861, a copy of it was sent to Reeve, signed by the\r\npresident of the evening:--\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the pleasure to inform you that you have this evening had the\r\nhonour of being elected a member of The Club.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nThis was followed, a week later, by another letter from the same writer:--\r\n\r\n10 York Street, Portman Square, April 16th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I have just returned to town and found your note of the\r\n10th inst., and I lose not a minute in writing to say that the election\r\nwhich I had so much pleasure in announcing to you, I announced as president\r\nfor the night, and in the form of words prescribed by Gibbon. The moment I\r\nhad written it I began a note to you in my own proper person, but I did not\r\nknow whether it would be quite regular to send it, and I had to leave town\r\non the following morning. The 'Sir,' and 'I am, Sir,' which anything but\r\nexpress what I feel, I most gladly exchange now, if you will allow it, for\r\na very different greeting, and I beg to remain, my dear Mr. Reeve,\r\n\r\nVery faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nGEORGE RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of London was elected on the same night with you, and it may\r\ninterest you to know that the members present were:--\r\n\r\n    Lord Lansdowne.\r\n    Lord Clarendon.\r\n    Sir H. Holland.\r\n    Sir David Dundas.\r\n    The Dean of St. Paul's.\r\n    Sir Charles Eastlake.\r\n    Lord Stanley.\r\n    Lord Cranworth.\r\n    Lord Stanhope.\r\n    Duke of Argyll.\r\n\r\n_To Madame de Tocqueville_\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate, April 17th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Madame de Tocqueville,--I have just published, in the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' a short notice of that book and that life which are to you the\r\ndearest things in the world, and to all of us, his friends, among the\r\ndearest. A few separate copies have been struck off, and I send one to you\r\nby this post, which will, I hope, reach you with this letter. It was a\r\nmatter of sincere regret to me that I found it impossible to execute\r\nmy intention of translating the two volumes, [Footnote: Oeuvres et\r\nCorrespondance inédites d'Alexis de Tocqueville, publiées et précédées\r\nd'une notice par Gustave de Beaumont.] partly because I found that I was\r\ntoo prominently noticed in them, and partly because our friends, the\r\nSeniors, were much bent on the undertaking. I therefore relinquished it in\r\ntheir favour. But I always intended to express in my own manner my deep\r\naffection for the memory of your husband, and my estimate of his genius\r\nas a man of letters and a statesman. This I have attempted to do in this\r\narticle, and though I am sensible that it falls far short of the subject of\r\nit, yet you will discover in it traces and reminiscences of that which\r\nwas one of the greatest happinesses and honours of my life--our mutual\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 24th_.--I have read the Eton article with great\r\nsatisfaction, and I really think it must have the best effect. But Ker, to\r\nwhom I lent my copy of the number, is not quite satisfied; but he takes\r\nextreme views. He also thinks you have not ascribed enough to the Education\r\nCommittee of 1818, or rather to the effect of our being thwarted by Eldon,\r\nPeel, &c. But he was very deep in that controversy at the time, having\r\ndefended the committee in a pamphlet, and I believe also in the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' and may be apt, therefore, to take an exaggerated view of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI am still cruelly hurt at the Newton monument being for ever cushioned. If\r\nElwin had remained editor of the 'Quarterly' it would have been taken up,\r\nand on right grounds. Indeed, a learned professor had actually prepared a\r\nscientific and popular article on the subject; but Elwin retired, and the\r\n'Quarterly Review' will now do nothing. Altogether I believe there never\r\nwill be a monument to the greatest man that England ever had, or will have.\r\n\r\nI am anxious to read the rest of the number, but have only just got it, and\r\nI sent it to Ker after I had read the Eton; and I am unwilling to delay\r\nthanking you for that.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nWent down to Weymouth alone for a few days in May, Read Buckle's second\r\nvolume on the way.\r\n\r\n_June 17th_.--Dinner at Lansdowne House to the Comte de Paris and the Due\r\nde Chartres; Elgins, Holfords, Bishop of Oxford, Grotes, &c.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G. G., June 28th_.--I did not expect that any answer to the Eton article\r\nwould be attempted, for it was unanswerable; the facts were real facts, and\r\nthe moderation with which they were stated made them all the more telling.\r\nThe commission is the proper corollary to it; and so many parents of\r\nill-educated boys appear to think.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. G. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, August 5th_.--In spite of Sir H. Holland's drugs, I see\r\nmy fate is sealed; and as I cannot even now put on a shoe, it is vain to\r\nhope that I shall be able to walk for some time; and, indeed, to avoid\r\nrelapses, I must undergo a regular cure of Vichy water. Therefore, with\r\nextreme regret, I make up my mind to turn my face south, instead of north,\r\nas soon as I can move.... I fear that, having lost the present month, there\r\nis little hope of our reaching Scotland at all this year.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Journal has:--\r\n\r\nBad fit of gout in July and August. Went to Vichy on August 10th. The heat\r\nwas extreme, and the waters made me worse. Thence to Clermont, Pontgibaud,\r\nGergovia. Home on the 31st.\r\n\r\n_September 1st_.--To Torry Hill [Lord Kingsdown's]--first time; shot there.\r\nFarnborough; Atherstone; Torry Hill again on the 21st. Stetchworth-good\r\nshooting.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_Harpton Court, September 22nd_.--I would have gladly escaped the Prussian\r\nmission,[Footnote: For the coronation of the King.] which is not much to\r\nmy taste, but the Queen insisted, and the Viscount [Footnote: Lord\r\nPalmerston.] and the Earl [Footnote: Lord John, created Earl Russell on\r\nJuly 30th, 1861.] attached political importance to it, so I yielded, and\r\nLady C. and Constance and Emily are, also on royal recommendation, to\r\naccompany me. The two latter are of an age to like a lark, which is more\r\nthan their respected parents do. I need not say that my hope of doing any\r\ngood by a flying visit in the midst of a carousal is exceedingly small; but\r\nI know the King well, and shall have no difficulty in telling him what I\r\nbelieve to be the truth concerning his interests.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear that you have been worried by gout, and that Vichy did\r\nyou no good. I am inclined to speak well of Wiesbaden, for the glorious\r\nweather I had there (94° in the shade always) made the waters effective,\r\nand somehow I felt younger; but that pleasant sensation is now rather on\r\nthe decline.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\nVal Richer, 7 Octobre.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--Votre tante, Madame Austin, qui est ici depuis quinze jours,\r\na fait hier, en se promenant dans une petite voiture traînée par un âne, et\r\nqu'elle menait elle-même, une chute dans laquelle elle s'est fait, au coude\r\ndu bras droit, une luxation qui nous a fait craindre d'abord une fracture\r\ngrave. Mon médecin de Lisieux, que j'ai envoyé chercher sur le champ,\r\na réduit la luxation, c'est-à-dire ramené les os du coude dans leur\r\nemboîtement naturel. Petite opération fort douloureuse, mais simple et sans\r\ngravité au fond. Madame Austin en sera quitte pour deux ou trois semaines\r\nde repos et d'immobilité absolue de son bras, qui est contenu dans des\r\néclisses. Au premier moment, elle a été fort ébranlée par cet accident.\r\nMon médecin une fois arrivé, elle s'est remise; elle a eu un peu de fièvre\r\ncette nuit; mais elle a dormi, et elle est assez bien ce matin, presque\r\nsans souffrance de son bras. J'espère qu'elle se remettra promptement; mais\r\nje n'ai pas voulu que vous ignorassiez la cause de la prolongation de son\r\nabsence. Ma fille Henriette écrit à Sir Alexander Gordon. Avec la santé de\r\nMadame Austin, tout accident peut être grave; mais je crois que vous pouvez\r\nêtre sans inquiétude sur les conséquences de celui-ci. Mon médecin est\r\nun homme habile qui soignera très bien votre tante, et mes filles lui\r\népargneront un mal très pénible, l'ennui de l'immobilité.\r\n\r\nJe ne vous parle pas aujourd'hui d'autre chose. Si vous étiez là, nous\r\ncauserions. De loin, il n'y a rien qui vaille la peine d'être écrit. Tout à\r\nvous, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\nThe gout was still threatening; so, according to the Journal:--\r\n\r\nTo Aix in October; back by Paris. Went to stay with Lord and Lady Cowley at\r\nChantilly; they had hired the _chasse_ and the _château_. Shooting there,\r\nNovember 11th. Home on the 16th.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lord Brougham was preparing the autobiography which was\r\npublished shortly after his death. Early in November his brother, Mr.\r\nBrougham, wrote to Reeve, begging him to bring his influence to bear, and\r\ninduce Lord Brougham to make this biography interesting and amusing. He\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n_From Mr. W. Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Paris, November 14th_.--Mind you dwell on books of biography which have\r\nfailed for lack of personal matter and anecdotes, and use this argument,\r\nwhich (for reasons I need not trouble you with) will, I know, have more\r\nweight than anything you can urge--that, irrespective of any question\r\nof his own fame or reputation, if he wishes the book to be eminently\r\nsuccessful in a commercial point of view, he must give as much as possible\r\nevery detail, no matter how minute, and tell everything connected with his\r\nown history and doings. That circumstances he may consider trivial all have\r\nthe greatest interest with the general public, who are the buyers he must\r\nlook to; that people don't want to read history in such a book as his\r\nautobiography; what they want is his life, and not a history of his\r\ntimes--anecdotes or peculiarities of his Bar and Bench friends; how he\r\nworked as a boy to make himself mathematician and orator; how he worked\r\nfor the English Bar; his early associates in Edinburgh, both at school and\r\ncollege, and all connected with the beginnings of the 'Edinburgh Review;'\r\nhis early associates in London before he came into Parliament in 1809, and\r\nfor years afterwards; all he did at Birmingham in '90, '91, and '92, when\r\nhe lived there with his tutor; all he can recollect of his mother and\r\ngrandmother-paternal, but more especially maternal. In short, every\r\npersonal thing, no matter how trifling, will be the making, as the omission\r\nwill be the marring, of the book.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that a good strong letter from you will have immense effect;\r\nand don't be afraid of making it too long; the more topics like those I\r\nhave hastily put down above you can give him to think over, now he is\r\nquietly at Cannes, the more chance we have of his digging into his mind and\r\nearly recollections, and producing what we want.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to quote Guizot; also tell him that Lord Malmesbury's heavy\r\nbook was saved solely by the gossip in the third and fourth volumes. The\r\nfirst two are heavy historical matter that would have sunk a 74.\r\n\r\nThe letter which Reeve wrote in consequence of this has unfortunately\r\nnot been preserved, but it is evident from Lord Brougham's reply that it\r\nclosely followed the lines suggested by his brother.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, November 17th_.--I have not words to express how grateful I feel\r\nfor your most kind letter, which arrived this morning. I fear I must admit\r\nall you say on the necessity of much personal matter. However, I really\r\nfeel certain that, with the political and general, there will be a number\r\nof personal anecdotes interspersed. Thus in the Queen's trial, numberless\r\nsingular anecdotes, professional and other; and on the changes of\r\ngovernment and the unity of our administration, strange things of\r\nindividuals: e.g. Lord Grey having, six months before taking office in\r\n1830, positively declared to Lansdowne that he had resolved never to take\r\noffice; and in 1822, to me, that unless I would consent to take office, and\r\nbe leader in the Commons, nothing should induce him to take part in any\r\nadministration--there being then an expectation of an offer to us; in\r\nanswer to which I positively refused leaving the progressives. I give these\r\nas examples of what the correspondence contains. I quite feel, however,\r\nthat something personal and in early life will be desiderated. If you look\r\nat my 'Life of Robertson' you will see all you refer to about his being at\r\nBrougham, and about the translation of 'Florus,' and other anecdotes, and\r\na good deal about my grandmother. Indeed, in that Life, and in my\r\ncontributions to the 'Law Review,' there are numberless anecdotes of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude on this subject without expressing how grieved I am to\r\nsee what you say of my old and dear friend Richardson. He wrote in very\r\ngood spirits last spring, and I fear he has had some severe illness since.\r\nPray let me know how this is.\r\n\r\nThe mention of him reminds me of an instance that matters which derive\r\ntheir whole interest from connexion with myself are thus very hateful to\r\nset down. He had given me a sermon and a hymn, written by the Principal's\r\nfather--my great-grandfather. When I attended the Glasgow congress last\r\nyear, the hymn was by mere accident sung in the church where we were on the\r\nmorning after our arrival:\r\n\r\n  Let not your hearts with anxious thoughts\r\n  Be troubled and dismayed, &c.\r\n\r\nI believe I was the only person in Glasgow who knew that the old minister\r\nwas the author, or who knew of his existence. [Footnote: Cf. _Life and\r\nTimes of Lord Brougham_, i. 30.] Now such things would make the narrative\r\na tissue of mere egotism. However, I feel the force of your remarks\r\nexceedingly. Certainly when Guizot's book came out, and I was asked my\r\nopinion of it, and some defects were pointed out, I could not avoid saying\r\nthere was a worse defect than all they mentioned; there would be a defect\r\nof readers. And so it has proved; I have, with all my respect for him, and\r\ndesire to read, been unable to get through a volume.\r\n\r\nI must set about digging in my published works for anecdotes; and, as in\r\nthe case of Robertson's Life, I may find a great number which, apart from\r\npersonality, may be interesting in their connexion with events. Again\r\nrepeating my gratitude, believe me, most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nH. BROUGHAM.\r\n\r\n_To Madame de Tocqueville_\r\n\r\nParis, November 15th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Madame De Tocqueville,--Although on the point of leaving Paris,\r\nI must write two lines to express to you my gratitude for allowing M. de\r\nBeaumont to return to me some of my own letters, which derive some value in\r\nmy eyes from their connexion with my ever-lamented and illustrious friend.\r\nI have had a melancholy satisfaction here in seeing the bust which M.\r\nSalaman has made. It surpasses my expectations, especially as regards\r\nthe mouth and forehead, and I trust that even you will not be entirely\r\ndisappointed in it.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, November 19th_.--I have only a minute for writing, as we have\r\nhad Princess Alice here all day, and I, of course, could do nothing but the\r\nvery easy task of entertaining her.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your letter, as I thought you were still abroad, and\r\nI only hope you are as glad to find yourself at home again as I am, though\r\nI am not sorry to have been to Berlin. I rather envy you being at Paris\r\nduring the late crisis, and getting the first impressions upon it.... I\r\nhave no doubt the deficit is about what Senex [Footnote: Reeve was at this\r\ntime writing occasional letters in the _Times_ under the signature of\r\n'Senex.' Lord Clarendon seems to have known this. Other correspondents did\r\nnot; notably Lord Kingsdown, some of whose letters innocently comment on\r\nthe opinions expressed by Senex.] puts it at. I read your admirable letter\r\nwith great pleasure, and thought it must be yours, though I did not\r\nunderstand whence it was written.\r\n\r\nI should very much like to have a talk with you. If you are not engaged,\r\nwhy shouldn't you and Mrs. and Miss Reeve come here on Saturday? We have\r\nasked Granville and C. C. G.; and I believe Lewis is coming. Miladi would\r\nwrite to propose this to Mrs. Reeve, but thinks she will consider two\r\nletters unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, December 8th_. There is a new complication of the American case,\r\nand I fear, though I don't join in what I find the universal feeling in\r\nEngland, that the Government of Washington will hold out. But even if they\r\ngive in, this hesitation, and their manifest fear of the mob, is the most\r\ncomplete confirmation of all I have been so long and so often preaching,\r\nof the extreme mischief of mob-government. They are in the hands of the\r\nmob--and one of the worst mobs in the world. You see they even are under\r\nthis dominion as to their military operations; for their disaster at Bull's\r\nRun was owing to the clamour forcing their comrades to advance and do\r\nsomething; and now no one can have the least doubt that, if Lincoln and\r\nSeward were left to themselves, a war with England would be the thing they\r\nmost dreaded; yet it is very possible they may feel unable to resist the\r\nmob-clamour, and may bring on that calamity. The mob of Paris threw France\r\ninto all the horrors of the reign of terror (1793-4), which have left such\r\nindelible disgrace on the French, and which stopped all improvement both in\r\nFrance and in Europe for a quarter of a century, and which even now create\r\nsuch a force in favour of despotism--as they did in the first Napoleon's\r\ntime. But I don't think the evils of mob-government--that is, of the\r\nsupreme power being in persons not individually responsible--can be more\r\nclearly manifested, though they may not lead to such atrocious crimes, than\r\nin the States of America--and the southern as well as the northern--for\r\nthe mob governs in both. My opinion will be the same, even if, contrary to\r\nprobability, the Washington men are stout enough to resist the mob; for\r\nthis hesitation and this struggle against the insanity of war could only be\r\noccasioned by the mob tyranny.\r\n\r\nPrince Albert died on December 14th. It was impossible to allow an event so\r\nimportant in the political as well as in the social history of the reign to\r\npass without a notice in the 'Edinburgh Review,' and that on the earliest\r\noccasion; though, in the middle of December, some special arrangement had\r\nto be made for it. It was, in fact, brought into the concluding pages of\r\nthe article on 'May's Constitutional History of England.' But the subject\r\nwas one which called for exceeding care and delicacy in the handling. The\r\nservices of Prince Albert to the Crown had been many and great; but by the\r\ncountry at large they were still looked on with jealousy and suspicion. A\r\nprofound sympathy was everywhere felt for the death of the Queen's husband;\r\nthe death of a man regarded by an ignorant prejudice as the embodiment of\r\nGerman influence in the Cabinet might easily be considered as no great\r\nloss. Reeve seems to have consulted Lord Clarendon as to how much or how\r\nlittle it was prudent to say; in answer to which Lord Clarendon wrote:--\r\n\r\n_The Grove, December 31st_.--I feel, as you do, that the events of the last\r\nmonth are too vast in themselves and in their consequences for discussion\r\nby letter, though I should much like to have a day's talk over them with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you mean to undertake the task--a labour of love--of\r\ndoing honour to the Prince, as I am sure it will be admirably performed;\r\nbut I would suggest to you not to be too precise as to the manner in which\r\nhe exercised his political influence.... There is a vague belief that his\r\ninfluence was great and useful; but there is a very dim perception of the\r\n_modus operandi_.... Peel certainly took the Prince into council much more\r\nthan Melbourne, who had his own established position with the Queen before\r\nthe Prince came to this country; but I cannot tell you whether it was Peel\r\nwho first gave him a cabinet key. My impression is that Lord Duncannon,\r\nduring the short time he was Home Secretary, sent the Prince a key when the\r\nQueen was confined, and the contents of the boxes had to be read or signed\r\nby her.\r\n\r\nThe concluding sentence in the next letter from Lord Clarendon refers to\r\nthe feeling which had been roused in Canada by the threat of war between\r\nEngland and the United States. The Canadians showed an exemplary loyalty;\r\nand great numbers of Irish--many of whom (like O'Reilly) had been known at\r\nhome as turbulent characters--now not only pressed forward to be enrolled\r\nin the militia, but formed themselves into special regiments.\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 21st_.--I cannot help telling you how excellent I think\r\nyour article on the Prince. You have said the right thing in the right way,\r\nand have so hit the happy medium between justice to him and no flattery\r\nor exaggeration, that I am sure the article will be read with pleasure by\r\neverybody, because it exactly reflects the public feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Belligerent and Neutral article is also very good, and I expect\r\nthat the temperate and sensible way in which the author recommends the\r\nabandonment of rights we can never again exercise will have some useful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of Canada is far greater than I expected; but that the French\r\nand Irish there should come out so strong for the Crown against Democracy\r\nis indeed a surprise. That Captain Eugene O'Reilly was a tremendous patriot\r\nin '48; and if I had not put him in prison for a little time to cool, he\r\nwould have made a greater donkey of himself than he did.\r\n\r\nThe next letter from Lord Clarendon relates to a point on which widely\r\ndifferent opinions have been and will be held, till it is decided in the\r\nonly practical way. It would be foreign to our present purpose to argue\r\nit here; but it is interesting to see the opinion of the man who,\r\nmore distinctly than any other, was responsible for the great change\r\ntheoretically introduced into our maritime code by the Declaration of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 28th_.--With respect to alterations in our maritime law\r\nand usages, I don't know what Russell's opinion may be, but I know that\r\nPalmerston does, or did, think the time come for relinquishing rights that\r\nwe can no longer exercise. He readily assented to the doctrines laid down\r\nat Paris in '56, and was so entirely of my opinion about going further that\r\nhe tried it on at Liverpool some time afterwards; but that part of his\r\nspeech was so ill received, and he received so many remonstrances against\r\ngiving up the _palladium_, &c. &c., that he told me when he returned to\r\nLondon that the pear was not ripe, and that we must give public opinion a\r\nlittle more time to become reasonable.\r\n\r\nOn January 9th Charles Sumner had spoken at great length in the United\r\nStates Senate, proving, very much to his own satisfaction and that of his\r\nfellow-citizens, that the surrender of Mason and Slidell was a great moral\r\nvictory, confirming the principles of maritime law for which they had\r\nalways contended, and which the English now admitted. A short telegraphic\r\nsummary of this had caught the mail at Halifax, and been published in the\r\n'Times' of the 20th; but it was not till the 27th that the United States\r\npapers, with the full report, reached England. Of this the 'Times'--on its\r\nown part--took no further notice; but on February 1st it published a long\r\nand most scathing criticism of it by 'Historicus' (Mr., now Sir, William\r\nHarcourt).\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 30th_.--When you can spare it, I shall be very glad to\r\nsee Sumner's speech....\r\n\r\nRussell was, of course, guided in his despatches by the law officers, and\r\nit is no wonder, therefore, that they should resemble the papers that had\r\npreviously appeared--many of which were written by lawyers--or that they\r\nshould be a reproduction of them; as a government could not, without risk\r\nof failure in its peaceful object, express itself with the vigour of Senex\r\nor the 'Edinburgh Review.' The most important despatch of all, however, and\r\nthe one upon which everything hung--viz. the demand for reparation--was\r\nwell conceived and executed, and did its work effectually.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, February 16th_.--I yesterday met Miss Courtenay, who gave me the\r\nvery pleasing information that Mrs. Austin had excellent accounts of Lady\r\nDuff Gordon, and was quite easy about her. I trust you will confirm this\r\naccount, and also add to it a general good account of Mrs. Austin herself.\r\n\r\nI hope there is a good article on the Amendment Cases in the 'E. R.' They\r\nhave stupidly omitted to send it from Grafton Street. The 'Quarterly' came,\r\nand a better article than our friend your neighbour's never was written. I\r\nadmired it so much that I wrote to him about it. Pray tell him my opinion\r\nof it, in case my letter should have miscarried, and that I admired it far\r\nmore than I did the very spiteful article of someone inspired by a personal\r\nenmity against myself, and who has not the common sense and fairness, when\r\nrelying on the wholly immaterial circumstance of my mis-stating the day of\r\nthe Westminster election (the night of Princess Charlotte's running away),\r\nto see that Dundonald [Footnote: _Autobiography of a Seaman_, ii. 892. It\r\nhas, however, been recently shown (Atlay's _Trial of Lord Cochrane_, pp.\r\n330 _et seq._) that Lord Dundonald had very little to do with it.] makes\r\nthe Duke of Sussex fall into the very same mistake.\r\n\r\n_Cannes_ [_February_].--I am much obliged to you for your kind letter, and\r\nrejoice to hear of the good intelligence [Footnote: As to the health of\r\nLady Duff Gordon.] from the Cape which will be such a relief to my valued\r\nfriend, her mother.\r\n\r\nThe American news is a good deal more favourable, but still they are\r\nnot out of the wood, or anything like it; and, even if they beat the\r\nSoutherners in the field, the re-union is as far off as ever. Their only\r\nsafe course is to regard the whole campaign as a kind of drawn battle, and\r\nboth sides to negotiate as to terms of separation.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that a certain most intriguing ambassadress is at the\r\nbottom of the spiteful attack in the 'Quarterly,' and she will find her own\r\nletters rise up in judgement against her. She never will forgive my having\r\nbeen at the dancing school with her, because that makes her near eighty,\r\nand she pretends only to be seventy-four.\r\n\r\nI am in constant expectation of a paper from a great mathematician, to\r\nwhich will be added, by B. Ker, artistic matter on monuments. It will be\r\nall sent to you, in the hope that it may assist whoever you have put on the\r\nmonument question.\r\n\r\n_Cannes, March 17th._--I am extremely sorry to find that, after all, I\r\ncannot finish you the Cambridge article on Newton, to be used at your\r\ndiscretion, or that of your contributor; for Mr. Routh has no less than\r\nfive wranglers, including the senior, as his pupils, and this has entirely\r\noccupied him, to the exclusion of all other work. I trust it will not\r\nprevent the article. In truth, my discourse at Grantham contains all the\r\nlearning on the subject, and it may be used without any acknowledgement\r\nwhatever, and I shall never complain of the plagiarism.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_April 4th._--Breakfast to the Philobiblon at home. There came the Due\r\nd'Aumale, Van de Weyer, Milman, Lord Taunton.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_Exeter, April 25th_.--If that providence which shapes our ends will but\r\nfinish those I rough-hew, I trust that the second week in October, or\r\nperhaps a few days earlier, will see us at Skibo. We hope to start straight\r\nfor the far North as soon as ever my autumnal egg is laid....\r\n\r\nWe have hit on an Easter ramble, original and agreeable. I sent down my\r\nhorses to my father's-in-law, in Dorset, and for the last week Christine\r\nand I have been riding gently along the coast of South Devon. Yesterday we\r\nwent to see Sir John Coleridge's place at Ottery St. Mary, and he drove\r\nus also round the neighbourhood. To-day we have been at Lady Rolle's, at\r\nBicton, on our way from Sidmouth, to see her gardens and arboretum, which\r\nare really marvels of beauty and growth. To-morrow we shall saunter on to\r\nDawlish, and so at last reach Plymouth, I believe. I want to get out of the\r\nway of the Exhibition opening, which bores me. At Torquay we expect to find\r\nthe Fergusons of Raith and the Scotts of Ancrum.\r\n\r\nI hear that other literary entrepreneurs have been as much struck as I am\r\nby the power and judgement there is in all that is written by a certain\r\nyoung author of our acquaintance.[Footnote: See ante, vol. i. p. 374.]\r\nTo write as well as that is a gift; but it is more for it cannot be done\r\nwithout infinite practice, labour, and good sense.\r\n\r\nAt Devonport they saw Mount Edgcumbe and the ironclad frigate 'Warrior'\r\nthen still a novelty, and unquestionably the most powerful ship of war\r\nafloat. The Journal adds: 'Back to town on May 3rd.'\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 22nd_.--I have just got the new number, and hasten to say\r\nhow much I am pleased with the only article I have had time to read with\r\ncare, the Alison.[Footnote: 'Alison's Lives of Lord Castlereagh and Sir C.\r\nStewart,' April 1862.]Nothing can be more able or more triumphant, and\r\nit is quite fair and candid towards Castlereagh, and much more than fair\r\ntowards Ch. Stewart, Indeed, if the letter to me deserves half what is said\r\nin its praise,[Footnote: _Sc_.' one of the most caustic and successful\r\npamphlets that have appeared in defence of an unpopular cause.'] he never\r\ncould have written it himself; and his gross stupidity in construing what\r\nI have said of his brother, and affixing a meaning which none but himself\r\never did, or could, was at the time admitted by his friends, whom he had\r\nconsulted, and in spite of whom he had published--among others, Strangford,\r\nfrom whom I heard what had passed. I have a copy of my own, which I should\r\nlike the author of the article to see, and shall send it through you when I\r\nreturn, for it is out of print. One of the blockhead's follies was the not\r\nperceiving how great a panegyric I had bestowed on his brother's speaking\r\nin the H. of Commons, after fully stating its defects. In fact, he had much\r\ngreater weight as leader than Canning, who, by the way, is too much praised\r\nin the article. Such a book as Alison's is almost incredible for its\r\nbadness of all kinds; but the author (on p. 521, line six from foot) gives\r\nhim a pull or two as to style by 'ineligible for election'--though that is\r\na trifle. The care with which the whole subject is treated, and the gross\r\nerrors--partly from ignorance, partly from adulation--exposed is quite\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nI have naturally been attracted to the Monument article, but have not had\r\ntime fully to profit by it; only I am greatly indebted to the learned\r\nauthor for what he says of my Grantham address.[Footnote: 'Public\r\nMonuments,' April 1862, p. 550.] However, I should have been far better\r\npleased had he left me out altogether, and dwelt at more length on the\r\ndisgrace of the country never having erected a monument to the greatest man\r\nshe ever produced--indeed, the greatest [that has] ever been. He seems\r\nnot to be aware of the one in Westminster Abbey having been raised by his\r\nniece's family, and not by the public.\r\n\r\n_Cannes, April 27th_.--I have a complaint to make of the 'E. R.' last\r\nnumber. In the learned and able article on 'Jesse's Richard III.,' at p.\r\n307, Lingard is referred to as having quoted the commission of the High\r\nConstable. I have scanned every line and every word of Lingard and find no\r\nsuch commission. But in a note to the third volume of Hume, note R, the\r\ncommission is given verbatim from Rymer. Jock Campbell used to hold that a\r\nfalse reference was an offence that ought to be made penal. I don't go\r\nso far, but the evil is very great. I have lost three or four hours in\r\nconsequence. Therefore, pray have inquiry made of your contributor whether\r\nor not I am right; and if not, where in Lingard the quotation is.\r\n\r\nReeve referred the 'complaint' to Hayward, the writer of the article, who\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\nI believe B. is right, for when I corrected the proof I looked in vain in\r\nLingard, although I was firmly convinced that he had quoted the document.\r\nBut pray remind his lordship that, when Campbell spoke of a false\r\nreference, he meant one with volume and page.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham's answer to this defence is not given, but it is impossible\r\nto allow it to pass without protest; for, whatever Campbell may have meant,\r\nit is very certain that a false reference, with volume and page cited,\r\nby which the falsehood is at once made manifest, is a venial offence in\r\ncomparison with a false reference given vaguely, which may keep the victim\r\nhunting for it for hours, as this one actually did keep Lord Brougham.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, May 7th_.--I wish to suggest to you the positive duty of taking\r\ncare that justice is done upon the trumpery, and one-sided, and altogether\r\ninsignificant Life of Pitt by Stanhope. Murray having published it, of\r\ncourse the 'Quarterly' has puffed it, and done so with an entire ignorance\r\nof the subject which is hardly conceivable. Therefore take great care\r\nbefore you commit the subject to any unsafe hands.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_62 Rutland Gate, May 11th_.--As I have lived for many years on terms\r\nof personal friendship, and indeed intimacy, with Lord Stanhope, and am\r\nindebted to him for many acts of kindness, it would be quite impossible for\r\nme to attack his book, even if I thought as ill of it as you do. I shall,\r\ntherefore, content myself with recording the very different view which I\r\nentertain of the success of Mr. Pitt's administration. I think it may be\r\nshown that both in peace and in war he was one of the most unsuccessful\r\nministers who ever exercised great power.\r\n\r\nOn these lines Reeve himself wrote the article, which was published in the\r\n'Review' of July, and brought him the following:--\r\n\r\n_From Lord Stanhope_\r\n\r\nGrosvenor Place, July 17th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--Allow me to say how very much I have been gratified\r\nin reading the article on my 'Life of Pitt' in the new number of the\r\n'Edinburgh.' Had the criticism been hostile I assure you that I should not\r\nhave felt that I had the smallest reason to complain; nor should I have\r\ninquired or even wished to know the writer's name. But as the matter\r\nstands, I would ask to convey to him through you my acknowledgement for his\r\nvery indulgent appreciation of myself, as well as for the perfect fairness\r\nand honourable candour with which the public questions at issue between us\r\nare discussed. It would be a pleasure to me if either now or at some time\r\nhereafter he would permit me to become acquainted with the name of a critic\r\nwho is evidently so accomplished as to render the praise of no slight or\r\nmean account. Believe me,\r\n\r\nVery faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nSTANHOPE.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Lord Stanhope ever knew who the writer was.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nThis was the year of the second Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\n_May 15th_.--The Binets came to see us. On the 21st the Duc d'Aumale's\r\n_fête_ to the Fine Arts Club; took Binet there. Went to the Derby with\r\nBinet and Stewart Hodgson. Xavier Raymond came.\r\n\r\n_July 22nd_.--Dined at the Clarendon with the Comtes de Paris and Chartres,\r\non their return from the American war. Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar and the\r\nDue d'Aumale were there.\r\n\r\n_July 31st_.--Left London for Germany. By Ostend and Cologne to Wiesbaden,\r\nwhere the Boothbys and Hathertons were. Then to Nuremberg, Munich,\r\nSalzburg, and through the Tyrol to Venice. Stayed there till the 24th.\r\n\r\n_August 25th_.--Went to Arquà to see Petrarch's house and tomb. Milan;\r\nItalian lakes. Back over the St. Gothard, Lucerne, Paris. Home, September\r\n9th.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_C. O., September 11th_.--Your very kind letter of last month would\r\ncertainly not have remained so long unanswered if I had been in England.\r\nBut we have been travelling for the last five weeks in the Tyrol and the\r\nnorth of Italy; my letters were not forwarded, and I only received that\r\nwhich you had been good enough to address to me on my return to London\r\nyesterday. There is probably no living opinion upon the character and\r\nadministration of Mr. Pitt so enlightened and valuable as your own, and I\r\nam gratified in the highest degree to find that my attempt to place the\r\nleading acts of his administration in a somewhat new light meets with your\r\napproval. The chief defect in Lord Stanhope's book is, in my opinion, that\r\nit does not present any connected view of Mr. Pitt as a statesman at all;\r\nand this the reader of the article may infer from every page of it. I began\r\nto write with a disposition to place Mr. Pitt rather higher than he had\r\nbeen placed before in the 'Review;' but upon a careful survey of his\r\nconduct on each of these questions, I found the ground crumble away under\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAs to the state of the army from 1783 to 1803, it was deplorable. Did you\r\never see Sir Frederick Adam's notes on what the army was when, at the age\r\nof 14, he entered it.[Footnote: In 1795. These notes do not seem to have\r\nbeen published.] When the Duke of Wellington first went to the Peninsula,\r\nhe gives a wretched account of the forces--ignorant officers and rascally\r\nmen. One of the grandest services the Duke rendered to his country was\r\nthat he raised the character of the army and made it a most admirable\r\ninstrument. But that was long after the days of Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe present Duke of Wellington tells me he is very well pleased with the\r\narticle on his father's supplementary despatches in the last number of\r\nthe 'Review,' and I think it is fairly done. They are a mass of most\r\ninteresting and instructive materials, but very few persons will master\r\nthem, whilst the trash that Thiers calls history circulates broadcast in\r\nEurope. I heard in Paris on Sunday that 65,000 copies of his 20th volume\r\nare already sold.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_C. O., September 12th_.--We returned to England on Tuesday, after a\r\npleasant tour, but the weather drove us from the mountains to the plains,\r\nand instead of preparing ourselves to graduate in the Alpine Club, we\r\nloitered in the galleries of Munich, Venice, and Milan, or amongst the\r\nremains of Padua and Verona. On the Lago Maggiore we met the Speaker\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Denison, afterwards Lord Ossington.] and Lady Charlotte, and\r\nwith them crossed the St. Gothard to Lucerne.... We still hope, if it suits\r\nyou, to come down to you when I have got quit of the 'Review.' I shall be\r\nengaged in London till October 7th, and then we are going for a few days to\r\nRaith... but I hope about the 12th or 13th we may reach the far North.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Brougham, September 14th_.--I can well believe that Wellington is\r\nsatisfied with the review [Footnote: \"Wellington's Supplementary\r\nDespatches,\" July 1862.] of his father's correspondence. It is very ably\r\nand very fairly done. But I wish it had reprimanded the Duke for making\r\nthe publication nearly useless by giving no table of contents. When I\r\ncomplained of this, he said it had been considered, and that an index would\r\nhave been hardly possible. My answer was that I did not want an index, but\r\nonly a dozen of pages giving the dates and the titles of the letters in\r\nsuccession. As it is, one can find no letter without turning over the whole\r\nof a volume.\r\n\r\nWell, what shall we now say of the Disunited States? My last letter from\r\nJ. Parkes,[Footnote: Probably Joseph Parkes, the well-known agent of the\r\nLiberal party. He died August 11th, 1865, but none of the obituary notices\r\nmention his wife.] who is married to a Yankee, and in correspondence with\r\nmany men of note in the North, represents the feeling to be growing for\r\nmediation, but mediation on the ground of a re-uniting of the South,\r\nwhich means no mediation at all. But he says that the real feeling of the\r\nAmericans, both N. and S., is of great respect for England, and pride in\r\ntheir descent from and connexion with us. The tone of the press, however,\r\nshows that this feeling dares not be shown, and that the popular\r\nclamour--that is, the mob-cry--is t'other way.\r\n\r\nThe Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_September 12th_.--To Torry Hill; shooting for ten days.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Rode over to Leeds Castle with Lord Kingsdown. Farnborough,\r\nStetchworth, Chorleywood (W. Longman's).\r\n\r\n_October 8th_.--To Raith, with Christine and Hopie. Mrs. Norton there.\r\nThen by Elgin and Burgh Head to Skibo. Shooting there. To Novar; back to\r\nEdinburgh and Kirklands, October 26th. Then to Abington on the 29th, and\r\nto Brougham--amusing visit. I was asked to read Lord B.'s Memoirs, and\r\ndissuade him from publishing them. To Ambleside to see Harriet Martineau.\r\nThence to Badger Hall [Cheney's], November 8th. Went over Old Park iron\r\nworks. Home on November 11th.\r\n\r\n_December 17th_.--We went to Chevening, and met there the Grotes, Milman,\r\nLord Stanley, Scharf, and Hayward. Lewis came on the 19th. Most agreeable\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Shooting at Stetchworth.\r\n\r\n_31st_.--To the Duke of Newcastle's at Clumber. Sir F. Rogers [afterwards\r\nLord Blachford] there.\r\n\r\n_1863_.--The year opened at Clumber. The Webbes of Newstead, the\r\nManners-Suttons, Venables, and Herbert came there. Shooting good; caught\r\nthree pike; rode with the Duke to Thoresby and Welbeck, through Sherwood\r\nForest.\r\n\r\n_January 6th_.--To the Speaker's at Ossington.\r\n\r\n_12th_.--I was made treasurer of the Literary Club [Footnote: This must not\r\nbe confused with The Club (see _post_, 133), which had long since dropped\r\nthe 'Literary.'] (Walpole's) on Adolphus' death.\r\n\r\n_February 25th_.--Prince of Wales' first levee.\r\n\r\n_March 7th_.--The Princess of Wales entered London on her marriage. I saw\r\nit from the Board of Trade rooms on London Bridge. Took the Dempsters\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_27th_.--The Duke of Newcastle, Baron Gros (French ambassador), Lord\r\nStanley, Mr. Adam, Lady Molesworth, Lord Kingsdown, and the Heads dined\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the next letter, from Lord Clarendon, that Reeve had asked\r\nhim to review the first two volumes of Kinglake's 'Invasion of the Crimea,'\r\nthen on the point of publication.\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 11th_. Some time ago I desired my booksellers to send\r\nme the first copy they could procure of Kinglake's book, and I shall read\r\nit most carefully.... There are many reasons why I should not like to\r\nreview the work; but I am equally obliged to you for the offer, and I\r\nshall, of course, communicate to you unreservedly my opinions upon it.\r\n\r\nWith this promise of help at first hand, Reeve undertook the review\r\nhimself; but the letters which follow show that, though the hand was the\r\nhand of Reeve, the voice was the voice of Clarendon--a collaboration that\r\ngives the article a very singular interest.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, January 23rd_.--Although I'm sure it is unnecessary, yet it\r\noccurs to me to ask you not to quote my opinion of Kinglake's book; as, for\r\nthe present, and for a variety of reasons, I should prefer its not reaching\r\nhim in an indirect manner. I long for a quiet talk with you, and am sorry\r\nthat it must be postponed for a few days; but in the meanwhile I\r\nmay perhaps be able to refresh my memory by referring to my private\r\ncorrespondence, which is in London. Let me have a line to say what\r\nimpression the book makes in the world, as far as you have yet been able\r\nto observe. I shall look with curiosity and some anxiety for the effect it\r\nproduces at Paris.\r\n\r\n_January 25th_.--Hayward has written to ask my opinion of the book. He is\r\nat Broadlands, and says that Palmerston is, on the whole, well pleased with\r\nthe portrait of himself, and that Lady P. is enchanted.\r\n\r\nI think as you do of the second volume; there is nothing finer, that I know\r\nof, in the English language than those successive battle pictures. He beats\r\nNapier out of the field. The 'Times' does not seem to like the portrait of\r\nitself. I thought the article yesterday ingenious. I shall hear shortly\r\nwhat effect the book produces at Paris. Persigny will, of course, prohibit\r\nits entrance, but he will not be able to shut out all the papers that\r\ncontain extracts.\r\n\r\n_The Grove, February 8th_.--I fear that my notes would not be legible or\r\nintelligible to anyone but myself, and I should much like to have a little\r\ntalk with you on the book. Could you come here on Saturday next and stay\r\ntill Monday? or if you should chance to be engaged on Saturday, would you\r\ncome down by the ten o'clock train on Sunday morning? I do not propose\r\nSaturday morning, as I must myself be in London at the Schools Commission\r\non that day.\r\n\r\n_G. C., February 25th_.--I shall be very glad to see the article in print.\r\nI am sure it will make a great sensation. Kinglake would induce people to\r\nbelieve that the Emperor was under an urgent necessity to turn away the\r\nattention of his subjects from his action at home, and that he therefore\r\ndragged us into the war fourteen or fifteen months after the _coup d'état_.\r\nIt would, I think, be worth while to get some facts respecting his status\r\nin France at that time. If I am not mistaken, he was in no trouble or\r\ndanger at all; for the nation had accepted him as a sort of deliverer from\r\nthe _rouges_, the fear of whom had been terrifying people out of their\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n_G. C., March 4th_.--The article quite comes up to my expectations, and I\r\nlike it very much. I cannot think it obnoxious to the charge of dulness;\r\nbut on that point I may not be an impartial judge, as the diplomatic\r\ndetails are to me intensely interesting.\r\n\r\nI have hardly any observations to make that would be worth your attending\r\nto, but I will mention one or two things that have occurred to me.\r\n\r\nAnd this he did at considerable length, suggesting several confirmations,\r\nmodifications, or additions.\r\n\r\nSo long as this article was to be considered as an ordinary contribution\r\nto the 'Edinburgh Review,' it bore merely the authority of the 'Review,'\r\nwhich, however great, was in no sense official; but now that the share\r\nof Lord Clarendon in its authorship is revealed, it assumes an extreme\r\nimportance, as an original, though necessarily partial, account of what\r\ntook place, and may be held as definitely settling the fate of some of the\r\nextraordinary misstatements which--foisted on the credulity of the public\r\nby the literary skill, the brilliant language, and the unblushing audacity\r\nof Mr. Kinglake--have been accepted as history, and have passed into\r\ncurrent belief. Perhaps nothing concerning the Russian war is more commonly\r\nrepeated than the statement that we were tricked into it by the Emperor of\r\nthe French for his own selfish ends, and in his desire to be received into\r\nthe brotherhood of sovereigns; that our ministers were blindly following\r\nthe lead of Louis Napoleon, and were guilty of a very gross blunder. It is\r\nunnecessary and would be out of place to enter here on the examination and\r\ndemolition of all this, as given in the pages of the 'Edinburgh Review;'\r\nand equally would it be out of place to discuss the question--as unknown to\r\nKinglake or to Reeve in 1863 as it was to Palmerston or Clarendon ten years\r\nearlier--whether we were not then, whether we have not been ever since,\r\n'putting our money on the wrong horse.' If we were, if we have been--a\r\nthing which many among us are still unwilling to believe--it is at least\r\ncertain that in 1853, as in 1840, it was all but universally held in this\r\ncountry that it would be prejudicial and dangerous to our most important\r\ninterests for either Russia or France to obtain sovereign control over the\r\nOttoman dominions, and that all the resources of diplomacy or of war ought\r\nto be exerted to prevent it. In the joint article before us, the condition\r\nof affairs in 1853 is thus stated in a few words:--'Russia had formed the\r\ndesign to extort from Turkey, in one form or another, a right of protection\r\nover the Christians. She never abandoned that design. She thought she could\r\nenforce it. The Western Powers interposed and the strife began.... England\r\nhas no call to throw off the responsibility of the measures taken on any\r\nother Power. Those measures were taken because they were demanded by her\r\nown conception of the duty she had to perform; and by far the largest share\r\nof that responsibility rests with this country. We see no reason to deny\r\nit; and if the case occurred again, we should see no reason to act with\r\nless determination.' And again as to the prosecution of the war after\r\nthe raising of the siege of Silistria--which, according to Kinglake, was\r\nunnecessary; or the invasion of the Crimea--which was unjustifiable, to be\r\naccounted for, not by any large views of politics or of war, but by paltry\r\npersonal passions and influences of the most contemptible kind:--England\r\nand France declared by their despatches of July 22nd, that the sacrifices\r\nalready imposed on them were too great, and the cause they had taken in\r\nhand too important, for them to desist, unless they obtained from Russia\r\nadequate securities against the renewal of hostilities. They therefore\r\ndemanded:--l. That the protectorate claimed by Russia over the\r\nPrincipalities by virtue of former treaties now abrogated, should cease. 2.\r\nThat the navigation of the mouths of the Danube should be free. 3. That the\r\ntreaty of July 13th, 1841, should be revised in the sense of a restriction\r\nof the naval power of Russia in the Black Sea. 4. That no Power should\r\nclaim an official protectorate over the Christian subjects of the Porte. On\r\nAugust 8th, Austria entirely adopted these principles, and on the 10th she\r\nurged Russia to accede to these demands. On the 26th Russia positively\r\nrejected these terms. Had they been accepted, it is needless to add that\r\nthe Crimean expedition would not have taken place. Here, then, is the clear\r\nand precise ground on which the war assumed an offensive character against\r\nRussia--viz. to compel her to submit to terms of peace, which England and\r\nFrance held to be necessary to the future safety of Turkey, and which\r\nAustria had fully adopted. This is the political explanation of the war,\r\nand it was fully justified, as each preceding step of the allies had been\r\njustified, by a fresh refusal on the part of Russia to agree to the terms\r\nproposed by the allies. It is unnecessary to carry this examination\r\nfurther. It has been introduced here merely as an illustration and a proof\r\nof the historical importance of the article now that Lord Clarendon's\r\nshare in it is understood, and we are made acquainted with the peculiar\r\nopportunities which Reeve possessed--not only as Clarendon's friend, but as\r\nin actual, confidential conversation with Lord Stratford when he ordered up\r\nthe fleets. [Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. p. 312.]\r\n\r\nThe fine old motto of the 'Edinburgh Review,' _Judex damnatur cum nocens\r\nabsolvitur_, is, when reduced to practice, apt to strain the relations\r\nbetween the 'judex' and the 'nocens;' and in this case the very outspoken\r\nreview, published under Reeve's sanction, caused a coolness between the two\r\nmen, the editor and the author, who had previously been on friendly terms.\r\nIt is, in fact, easily conceivable that, in earlier years or in other\r\nlands, powder would have burnt or small swords flashed. Being when and\r\nwhere they were, they dropped out of each other's circle. And this\r\ncontinued for upwards of three years, when a chance meeting opened the door\r\nto reconciliation.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Kinglake_\r\n\r\n9 St. George's Terrace, Marble Arch,\r\n\r\nNovember 14th, 1866.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--I think I perceived yesterday that my malice--malice founded,\r\nI believe, on a couple of words, and now of some three years' standing--had\r\nnot engendered any corresponding anger in you; and if my impression was a\r\nright one, I trust we may meet for the future upon our old terms. Shall it\r\nbe so?\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nA. W. KINGLAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLAW AND LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what must seem a curious coincidence, in 1863 and the two years\r\nimmediately following, death carried off all who had been mainly\r\ninstrumental in forming Reeve's career. Greville, who introduced him to the\r\n'Times,' died in 1865; his mother died in 1864; in 1863, his early patron\r\nand assured friend, the Marquis of Lansdowne, died on January 31st, at the\r\nripe age of 82; his uncle, John Taylor, the head of the Taylor family, a\r\nman of singular ability as a mining engineer, died on April 5th; and Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis, whose retirement from the editorship of the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview' had paved the way for Reeve's succession, died on April 13th.\r\nMuch of Reeve's correspondence with Lord Clarendon--Lewis's\r\nbrother-in-law--refers to the wish of the widow, the Lady Theresa Lewis,\r\nthat a collected edition of her husband's contributions to the 'Review'\r\nshould be published. The wish was only partially carried into effect; seven\r\nof the articles were collected in a volume published in 1864 under the\r\ntitle of 'Essays on the Administrations of Great Britain from 1783 to\r\n1830;' and Lewis's brother, Sir Gilbert Lewis, who succeeded to the\r\nbaronetcy, published his letters in 1870. The following letter from\r\nLord Clarendon refers to the death (on January 31st) of Lewis's\r\nstepdaughter--Lady Theresa's daughter by a former marriage--and wife of\r\nMr., now Sir, William Harcourt:--\r\n\r\n_G. C., February 3rd_.--I came up early yesterday morning, and only\r\nreceived this evening your most kind letter directed to The Grove, or I\r\nshould have thanked you for it sooner.\r\n\r\nA great misfortune has befallen us, and we are all very sad, but derive\r\nsome comfort from the calmness and resignation with which my sister is\r\nbearing up against her grief. To William Harcourt it is, indeed, as you\r\nsay, a wreck of all happiness and hope; but no man under such trying\r\ncircumstances could have displayed more fortitude, or more tender concern\r\nfor others. I meet him to-morrow at Nuneham for the last sad office.\r\n\r\nI grieve for Lord Lansdowne, and yet it is impossible not to feel that,\r\nat his age, and with rapidly increasing infirmities, a prolongation\r\nof existence was not to be desired. He was a rare combination of high\r\nqualities, and we shall not look upon his like again.\r\n\r\nThe next letter, also from Lord Clarendon, refers to the 'Albert\r\nMemorial':--\r\n\r\n_The Grove, March 29th_.--I knew you would approve of the Cross. I myself\r\nshould prefer it to any other form of memorial, if it was in the centre of\r\nconverging roads, or of a great place surrounded by buildings more or less\r\nharmonising with it; but placed in Hyde Park, with no local assistance\r\nbeyond its imaginary connexion with the Exhibitions of '51 and '62, I have\r\nmy fears that it will be thought unmeaning.\r\n\r\nI forget at this moment the exact height of the design, but I do not think\r\nit is to be 300 feet; and Mr. Scott is to consider whether the proportions\r\nmay not generally be reduced. He may wish to build the largest cross in the\r\nworld, but neither the Queen nor her committee have any such desire....\r\nI don't think that a grant by the representatives of the people, as a\r\nsupplement to their voluntary contributions, and aided by the subscription\r\nof the Queen, would destroy the feeling of the monument. There might\r\nperhaps be less sentiment, but the whole would be more national.\r\n\r\nFrom the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_May 4th_.--Lord Hatherton died at Teddesley. His illness had been long.\r\nWhen we parted at Wiesbaden in August last, I knew we should not meet\r\nagain. Never was there a kinder and more active friend. The confidence he\r\nshowed me was unbounded; insomuch that in November he placed in my hands\r\nthe original correspondence of the ministers with himself in June and July,\r\n1834, on the Irish Coercion Bill, which led to the breaking up of Earl\r\nGrey's Cabinet. These I have power to publish; but, if not published, I\r\nmean eventually to return them to the Littleton family.\r\n\r\nThis I did in July 1864. The volume was published in 1872.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_C. O., July 10th_.--I am rather like a boy to whom some benevolent genius\r\noffers a basket of peaches, and who feels rather shy of taking the biggest\r\nof them; but, on the other hand, it would be a shabby return for great\r\nkindness to keep you in suspense. I, therefore, answer that, _sauf cause\r\nmajeure_, we hope to be with you on the evening of Tuesday, August 11th. We\r\nshall probably go down to Aberdeen by sea, starting on Saturday, the 8th,\r\nif decent berths can be obtained, and I have sent to take them. If this\r\nfails we should start on Sunday evening by rail. I cannot express to you\r\nhow delightful to me is the thought of the kind welcome of Skibo, and the\r\nfresh air of your hills, after a very long and laborious season. But I have\r\nstill a month in the mill, and a huge list of causes to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe 'Edinburgh' will be out on Thursday. You will find it very Scotch.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nWe went to Chichester, on a visit to Dr. McCarogher; and from there to\r\nGoodwood races.\r\n\r\n_August 8th_.--To Scotland by sea. Beached Skibo on the 11th. Shooting on\r\nthe 12th with Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Seaforth, and Dempster.\r\n\r\n_25th_.--To Brahan. Little old General Kmety there; very good fun; but he\r\ndoes not look a hero.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_Brahan Castle, August 26th_.--We performed our pleasant but slow journey\r\nvery well, and arrived at five P.M. The weather yesterday was the worst I\r\nhave seen this year in Scotland. I declined to face the woods, but we got\r\na walk by the Conan in a gleam of sunshine. However, the house and its\r\ncollections, and their most amusing and hospitable owner, afforded us ample\r\namusement. I am sorry, for my own sake, that this country is constantly\r\ngaining stronger claims on my affection and regard; for am I not born a\r\ndweller by our inglorious southern streams and downs? If, however, there be\r\nsuch a thing as transmigration hereafter, let me hope that I shall come out\r\nat last as a Highland laird.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_August 28th_.--To Invergarry, where we lunched with Mr. Peabody; and to\r\nGlenquoich--Ed. Ellice's. The Elchos, Sir F. and Lady Grey, and Lowe there.\r\n\r\n_31st_.--Excursion from Glenquoich to Loch Hourn. Then by Oban to Glasgow.\r\nVisit to the Belhavens at Wishaw, September 4th, and to Abington. Home on\r\nthe 10th.\r\n\r\n_September 15th_.--Torry Hill. Shooting there for some days.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Mr. Ellice died suddenly [Footnote: Of heart disease and\r\neighty-two years. He was found dead in his bed.] at Ardochy, only a\r\nfortnight after we left his house. That excursion to Loch Hourn was his\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_Torry Hill, September 21st_.--What a sudden and painful loss is this\r\nabrupt termination of the life of our kind friend at Glenquoich! It is\r\nscarcely three weeks since we left him in his usual health and spirits,\r\nand now--as Evelyn says--all is in the dust.... I have had an unpleasant\r\naccident, though--thank God!--not a serious one. Turning round very\r\nsuddenly to shoot a partridge behind me, without seeing that Lord Kingsdown\r\nwas on his pony about fifty yards off, a pellet of shot from my gun hit\r\nhim in the cheek, and another hit his pony in the eye. Conceive my horror!\r\nFortunately, the wound was very slight, and, indeed, was well in half an\r\nhour; but if it had hit him in the eye I never should have forgiven myself.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, October 4th_.--I was very glad to hear from you this morning,\r\nbut very sorry to learn that you have cause for deep anxiety respecting\r\nyour mother, and I fear, from what you say, that she is hopelessly ill and\r\nsuffering much. I sympathise with you sincerely. I joined my people at\r\nLathom a month ago, and we returned last week from our peregrinations,\r\nall well, except myself, who can't shake off the gout, which is a\r\ndisappointment after having taken the trouble of a Wiesbaden cure.\r\n\r\nOn the day of my last bath there I received an urgent request from our\r\nForeign Secretary that I should proceed to Frankfort and observe the\r\nconference. I did so, and was interested and amused. It was an opportunity\r\nthat may never occur again of meeting the sovereigns of Germany, great and\r\nsmall....\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon me by the E. of Austria was very agreeable. He had\r\nnone of the proud manner of which at one time we heard so much, but, on the\r\ncontrary, he was frank and gentlemanlike, and told me the difficulties in\r\nwhich Germany was placed by such an effete institution as the Diet, and the\r\nadvances making by Democracy, which, for the first time, were dangerous,\r\nbecause the people had reason and justice on their side. He told me, also,\r\nall the steps he had taken to secure the co-operation of the K. of Prussia,\r\nwhich were straightforward and deferential; and he complained, though\r\nwithout bitterness, of the manner in which they had been misrepresented....\r\nIt may be that some good will come, perhaps before the close of the present\r\ncentury, from a public avowal by congregated sovereigns that their subjects\r\nhad grievances of magnitude, and that delay in redressing them was full of\r\ndynastic danger.\r\n\r\nOne can conceive no more complete diplomatic fiasco than the three great\r\nPowers of Europe giving a triumph to Gortschakoff. The mistake originally\r\nmade was thinking that Russia was weak and in trouble, and would therefore\r\nyield to menace. Several months ago I took the liberty of suggesting that,\r\nalthough Russia was powerless for an aggressive war, she would be found as\r\nstrong and formidable as ever in resisting any attack from without, and\r\nthat foreign dictation would probably have the effect of uniting all the\r\nparties into which Russia was divided. I don't mean to deny, however, that\r\nintervention of some kind was inevitable; but the difficulties attending it\r\nwere either overlooked or not foreseen, and the mode of dealing with them\r\nhas consequently been unskilful.\r\n\r\nContinuing the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_October 5th_.--To Aiupthill. On the 17th to the Grove; Odo Russell there.\r\n24th, to Torry Hill, with Christine and Hopie. Met the Roger Leighs there;\r\nalso the Heads and Sir Lawrence Peel. High jinks on Hopie's twenty-first\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\n_November 19th_.--To Shoeburyness, to see the trial of Sir William\r\nArmstrong's 600-pounder gun.\r\n\r\nMy mother was exceedingly ill during the autumn, and it became apparent\r\nthat her illness was mortal. She was attended with great assiduity by Dr.\r\nFyfe. For this reason we remained within reach of London.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_ [Footnote: At this time Lord Chancellor.]\r\n\r\n_Basingstoke, November 28th_.--I shall be much obliged to you if, by the\r\napplication of the whip to the printer, you can get him to strike off a\r\nfew copies of the notes of my opinion on the appeals in the matter of the\r\n'Essays and Reviews' by Tuesday afternoon, so that a copy may, on the\r\nevening of Tuesday, be sent to Lords Cranworth, Chelmsford, and Kingsdown.\r\nThe notes are not long, but I am anxious that they should be, as soon as\r\npossible, in the hands of the three noble lords I have named. I hope we\r\nshall be able to give judgement about December 15th.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham's next letter refers to one of the few unpleasant passages in\r\nReeve's life. In October 1863 the 'Edinburgh Review' had an article on J.\r\nG. Phillimore's 'Reign of George III.,' in which the book was somewhat\r\nroughly handled. That the comment was honest is quite certain; that it was\r\njust would probably be the opinion of most historical students; but Mr.\r\nPhillimore thought that it was neither one nor the other, and being--as the\r\n'Saturday Review' described him--one whose 'normal position was that of\r\na belligerent,' he replied to the review by a studiously offensive and\r\npersonal pamphlet, [Footnote: This sensitiveness to literary criticism was,\r\nperhaps, a family failing. Some forty years before, Phillimore's uncle, Sir\r\nJohn Phillimore, was fined 100£. for bludgeoning James, the author of the\r\n_Naval History_, for some unflattering remarks on the discipline of the\r\n'Eurotas' whilst under his command.] bearing the title 'Reply to the\r\nMisrepresentations of the \"Edinburgh Review.\"' According to this, the\r\narticle was a spiteful attack made by 'Mr. Reeve' himself; it was mainly\r\nnoticeable for its ignorance, its malice, its time-serving toadyism of Lord\r\nStanhope, and should be contrasted with another article in the same number\r\nof the 'Review' on 'Austin on Jurisprudence,' which was outrageously\r\nbelauded because Austin was 'Mr. Reeve's' uncle. In point of fact, the\r\narticle on Phillimore was written by the present Judge O'Connor Morris, and\r\nthat on Austin by John Stuart Mill, neither of whom was an intimate friend\r\nof the editor's. Phillimore did not notice, or was not sufficiently\r\nacquainted with Reeve's family history to appraise yet another article on\r\n'Tara: a Mahratta Tale,' by Captain Meadows Taylor--Reeve's cousin. If he\r\nhad, he would certainly have made it the subject of some more scurrilities.\r\n\r\n_Cannes, January 7th_.--I have only a moment before the post goes to write,\r\nand it may be too late another day. Pray allude to Phillimore's pamphlet,\r\nand give some explanation on certain parts of it. I have not read the whole\r\nof it, but friends here who borrowed it of me have, and they tell me that\r\nsome explanation is required. They are a good deal prejudiced, however,\r\nowing to your having praised Stanhope's book, of which they have a very\r\nbad opinion. I myself rather agree with them, though not going to the same\r\nlength. Of Phillimore, I only know that he did good service in the Commons\r\nfor a public prosecutor, and was very shabbily supported by the friends of\r\nLaw Amendment. But I had a very poor opinion of the book, though he is a\r\nvery clever man, and the Yankees considered him the first man in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nReeve's letters for several months had been leading up to the next sad\r\nentry in the Journal. For a woman of seventy-five, a serious and prolonged\r\nillness could scarcely have any other issue.\r\n\r\nMy mother's illness was approaching its melancholy end. On January 8th I\r\nsat up all night at Brompton. On the 9th she was speechless. On Sunday,\r\nthe 10th, at 3 P.M., she died. On the 16th she was buried in the Brompton\r\nCemetery. Edward James Reeve read the service. Arthur Taylor, John,\r\nRichard, John Edward, and Fairfax Taylor, Sir A, Gordon, P. Worsley, W.\r\nWallace, J. P. Simpson, R. Lane, Dr. Fyfe, and John Cox attended.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I went to Essex Street Chapel, where Madge preached her funeral\r\nsermon. He had preached my father's funeral sermon just fifty years before.\r\nMy mother survived my father nearly fifty years. This is not the place to\r\ncomment on her singular virtues!\r\n\r\nWe went to Boulogne on the 18th for the first period of mourning, and\r\nvisited Amiens and Abbéville. Home on the 25th.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n62 _Rutland Gate, January 11th_.--Your long kindness and friendship tell\r\nme how much I may rely on your sympathy. My dear mother expired yesterday\r\nafternoon, in perfect serenity. However long one may have anticipated such\r\na stroke and, as I told you in July, I knew it was impending--one cannot\r\nrealise it till it falls. As Gray said to Mason, 'A man has but one\r\nmother;' it is a blank that cannot be filled up. But I have the consolatory\r\nthought that my dear mother's life was complete in its usefulness, its\r\nenergy, its unquenchable zeal for the good of others, its Christian\r\nendurance of sorrow and of pain; and no one ever lived in this world more\r\nfitted to enter upon another. Christine was with her to the last.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Orleans House_, 11 _Janvier_.--Hélas! cher Monsieur; je n'ai pas de\r\nconsolation à vous offrir; je ne puis que vous assurer de ma profonde\r\nsympathie. Je juge de ce que vous devez souffrir par ce que je ressentirais\r\nà votre place. Mon coeur est avec le vôtre. H. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\nJanuary 11th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Reeve,--I heard to my great regret a little while ago that the\r\nday of your affliction was fast approaching, and I knew at once by your\r\nenvelope this afternoon that the hour had come. I thank you for your kind\r\nthought of not allowing me to hear by public report an event that so deeply\r\naffects your happiness; and I know from my own sad experience how to feel\r\nfor you in this trial--the loss of a mother's never-failing love and\r\nsympathy, and of one's own daily occupation, that real labour of love, in\r\nministering to her comfort and soothing the ills of declining years. You\r\nhave the consolation, and it is one to be grateful for, my dear Reeve, that\r\nyour last impressions are of a calm and painless passage from this life,\r\nsuch as you would have most desired for her whom you have so loved and can\r\nnever forget. Lady Clarendon and my daughters desire me to send you their\r\nkind regards and the expression of their sincerest sympathy.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Reeve,\r\n\r\nEver yours truly,\r\n\r\nCLARENDON.\r\n\r\n_To Madame de Tocqueville_\r\n\r\nBoulogne-sur-mer, January 20th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Madame de Tocqueville,--One's own sorrows bring back with increased\r\nvivacity the sorrows of others and the melancholy recollections of other\r\nyears, for at each successive blow a great gap is made in life, and one\r\nfeels that another record of the past is closed. We have come to this place\r\nfor a few days to regain a little health and spirits after the long and\r\nanxious year we have passed by my dear mother's sick bed. All our cares\r\nhave unhappily been vain, and about ten days ago she breathed her last. I\r\ncannot express how great a loss this is to me, or how deeply I feel it.\r\nYour dear and ever-lamented husband was one of those who appreciated the\r\nexquisite simplicity and energy of my mother's character, and the words he\r\nlet fall from time to time about her are very precious to me.\r\n\r\nTo any one who now reads the book, [Footnote: See _ante_, vol. ii. p. 66.]\r\nand considers the later course of the lives of its authors, it is difficult\r\nto conceive the excitement which was raised about the case referred to in\r\nthe next note from the Journal. The remembrance of it seems to throw a\r\ndoubt on the reality or immutability of 'first principles.'\r\n\r\n_February 8th_.--Judgement was given by the Judicial Committee on the great\r\necclesiastical cause of 'Essays and Reviews.' It was drawn with great care\r\nby Lord Westbury, who read it all over with me before it was submitted to\r\nthe committee.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Cannes, February 13th_.--I received your melancholy letter [Footnote:\r\nAnnouncing the death of his mother.] some time ago, but I did not answer\r\nit because I felt that your excuse for not taking notice of Phillimore's\r\nattack was too good, and I had no comfort to offer you. I suffered most\r\nseverely myself by the same loss, and I have not, after above twenty\r\nyears, learnt to forget it. Your letter brought it back strongly to my\r\nmind, as it also did the memory of my excellent friend your father.\r\n\r\nI find my opinion, and those I cited in support of it, is confirmed by\r\nthe articles in the journals--such as the 'Saturday Review' [Footnote:\r\nFebruary 6th, 1864.]--which, though attacking Phillimore in some\r\nparticulars, yet show that some answer to him, or explanation of matters\r\nwhich he represents, was wanted. But I dare say his attacks will be\r\nforgotten, and you may be right in doing nothing that can help to keep\r\nthem in people's recollection. [Footnote: Reeve, who was always averse\r\nfrom any controversy of this nature, took no public notice of the\r\npamphlet, and Phillimore died early the next year.]\r\n\r\nI have just got your new number and not read a page of it, as the\r\n'Quarterly' came with it, and I was anxious to read the review of our\r\nfriend your neighbour's book, [Footnote: _The Life of Marcus Tullius\r\nCicero_.] which is learnedly and most justly praised, and the value of\r\nthe praise not impaired, like that of the 'Saturday Review,' [Footnote:\r\nFebruary 6th, 1864.] by praising Houghton's (Dick Milnes') poems in\r\nanother article.\r\n\r\nThe Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_February 20th_.--Went to Farnborough. The Longmans just installed in their\r\nnew house.\r\n\r\nTo Ampthill at Easter. On April 1st to Paris, with Christine and the\r\nDempsters. I had the gout all the time.\r\n\r\n_April 3rd_.--Races at Vincennes. Embassy ball on the 5th. Persignys and\r\nMorny there. Breakfast at Vaux with Marochettis on the 6th. Met Sigismond\r\nKrasinski's son Ladislas at his mother's.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G. C., April 6th_.--As five years of freedom had augmented my inveterate\r\ndislike of office, you may suppose that I made a gallant resistance--quite\r\n_à la Danoise_; but at last I could not help taking an oar with old friends\r\nin a boat which they believed to be sinking, and in which they fancied I\r\nmight be of some use. If the Government had been as clear of some of the\r\nworst shoals a fortnight ago as it is now, nothing would have induced me to\r\nsay 'Yes.'\r\n\r\nI hope that Stansfeld's exit and Palmerston's speech, and, more important\r\nstill, the feeling throughout the country upon the Mazzini affair, will\r\nmend our relations with France by showing Frenchmen of all classes and\r\ncolours that the alliance is here estimated at its real value; indeed,\r\nnothing will go well in Europe if England and France are supposed to be\r\npulling different ways; and if they had been acting together, instead of\r\nbeing _en froid_ six months ago, the Dano-German difficulty would never\r\nhave attained its present developement. Some soreness was natural at our\r\nnot agreeing to the congress; but too much has been made of the tone of J.\r\nR.'s answer, and offence ought not to be taken where none was intended, but\r\nquite the reverse, as I can certify from the conversations I had at the\r\ntime with the writer....\r\n\r\nIt was this letter which suggested to Reeve to propose to Lord Clarendon\r\nthe advisability of coming over to Paris himself 'to see the Emperor and\r\nendeavour to settle joint action on the Danish question.' He wrote also to\r\nthe same effect to Lord Granville.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Granville_\r\n\r\nLondon, April 9th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--Many thanks for your note, and for the suggestion it\r\ncontains. I [had] already had some talk with Clarendon and Russell on the\r\nsubject. The first thought that it was too late now, and urged some minor\r\nobjections, but in my opinion he is wrong, and I hope the matter will be\r\narranged. Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_London, April 9th._--Your letter is very important. It has been settled at\r\nthe Cabinet that I shall go over on Tuesday. It is particularly troublesome\r\nand inconvenient to me; but I shan't mind that, if any good is to be done\r\nand that the friendly motive of my going is appreciated.\r\n\r\n_From M. Fould_\r\n\r\nDimanche [April 10th].\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieuer,--Je me suis empressé de transmettre à l'empereur la\r\nnouvelle que vous voulez bien me donner et qui me fait grand plaisir.\r\n\r\nMille compliments bien désirés,\r\n\r\nACHILLE FOULD.\r\n\r\nThe visit led to no result, as the French refused to act. The Journal\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n_April 20th_.--Interesting day at Versailles with Feuillet de Conches and\r\nSoulié; took the Dempsters and Hamiltons of Dalziel.\r\n\r\nMy father's old friend Dr. de Roches died at Geneva on April 18th. On the\r\n23rd, Christine and I went to Geneva on a visit to the Binets. Saw Mme.\r\nde Roches, who also died a few days afterwards. Returned by Lausanne and\r\nNeufchatel to Paris, and home on May 1st.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Brougham_\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 15th_.--I have been reading the new number of the 'E. R.,' and\r\nhave been greatly interested in it. The review [Footnote: Sc. of Renan's\r\n_Life of Jesus_.] is most ably and learnedly done, though in one or two\r\nplaces a little obscure. But the subject was most difficult to handle, and\r\nI think no one can complain of Renan being unfairly treated; indeed he is\r\nlavishly praised, though he is rejected--but rejected most candidly.\r\n\r\nI have also read the first article, [Footnote: _Diaries of a Lady of\r\nQuality._] on Miss Wynn's book. I am convinced that the facts must be taken\r\nwith large allowance; some of them are to my personal knowledge erroneously\r\ngiven--from no intention to deceive, but from hasty belief. But there is\r\none story which on the face of it is not only untrue, but impossible; which\r\nshe appears to have had from a Mrs. Kemble, and to have swallowed whole.\r\nHow could any being believe in Lord Loughborough's telling such a tale?\r\nMrs. K. may have, from ignorance, supposed that a prisoner on trial for his\r\nlife can be examined by the prosecutor's counsel; but can anyone suppose\r\nthat such a story as Davison's murder of his old companion could have\r\nhappened, and no one even heard of it, or of his being hanged, as he must\r\nhave been, on his own confession? I knew intimately those friends of Miss\r\nBaillie who are said to have been present, and I never heard a word of it\r\nfrom them--probably because they regarded the story as ridiculous.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nClaremont, le 23 mai.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--N'ayant pas eu le plaisir de vous rencontrer\r\ndepuis mon retour d'Espagne, j'ai passé samedi chez vous pour vous parler\r\nd'une affaire que j'aurais préféré traiter de vive voix. Ne vous ayant\r\npas trouvé, il me faut aujourd'hui avoir recours à la plume, car le temps\r\npresse. Je voulais vous dire que mon mariage avec ma cousine Isabelle\r\nsera décidément célébré lundi prochain, le 30 mai. Je n'ai pas _issued_\r\nd'invitations pour assister à cette cérémonie, mais il y a certaines\r\npersonnes dont la présence serait pour moi une grande satisfaction à cause\r\ndes anciennes relations qui ont existé entre elles et ma famille. Je n'ai\r\npas besoin de vous dire que vous êtes de ce nombre, mon cher Monsieur\r\nReeve, et surtout après la lettre si aimable que vous m'avez écrite à\r\npropos de mon mariage je ne puis me refuser le plaisir de vous avertir de\r\nsa célébration, afin que, si vous le pouvez, vous veniez y assister. Si\r\nj'avais pu vous en parler de vive voix, je vous aurais mieux dit que je\r\nn'ai adressé à personne d'invitation formelle, qu'en vous faisant cette\r\nproposition je ne veux vous imposer aucune gêne, mais que par cela même\r\nvotre présence n'aurait que plus de prix à mes yeux.\r\n\r\nVous m'excuserez de n'avoir cherché ce matin qu'à vous expliquer ma pensée\r\naussi brièvement que possible. En ce temps-ci tous mes moments sont\r\ncomptés.\r\n\r\nLa cérémonie aura lieu à la chapelle catholique de Kingston à 10-1/2h. a.m.\r\nLe train qui part de Waterloo Station à 9h.40 pour Surbiton arrive à temps.\r\n\r\nVotre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nAs to which the Journal says:--\r\n\r\n_May 23rd_--The Raymonds and Mlle. Lebreton came.\r\n\r\n_24th_.--Dined with Raymond at Claremont. Great royal dinner; fifty-two\r\npersons; was presented to the Infanta Isabella.\r\n\r\n_30th_.--Marriage of the Comte de Paris. Banquet at Claremont. Ball at the\r\nDuc de Chartres'--Ham House. I drove Chartres from Claremont to the ball.\r\n\r\n_June 7th_.--The centenary dinner of The Club; twenty-five members present;\r\nMilman in the chair. Lord Brougham was there. I sat between the Bishop of\r\nLondon (Tait) and Eastlake.\r\n\r\nThere was at this time much sentimental sympathy with Denmark in her\r\nunequal struggle against the combined forces of Prussia and Austria; but as\r\nFrance, Russia, and Sweden, which, equally with England, were parties\r\nto the treaty of 1852, refused to give Denmark any active support, the\r\npractical feeling was that English interests were not involved to such an\r\nextent as to render it advisable to assert them by force of arms.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_G. C., June 24th_.--As far as I can make out there is no real war feeling\r\nin the country, though a great disposition in the H. of C. to turn out\r\nthe Government, whether it decides upon being pacific or bellicose; and I\r\nexpect that a vote of censure, or want of confidence, will be successful.\r\nIf you hear anything reliable on the subject, pray let me know.\r\n\r\n_June 26th_.--The island-occupation plan is very well devised, and if our\r\ncat was jumping that way, it would be worthy of very serious consideration;\r\nbut it won't do to embark single-handed in such operations.... The peace\r\nfeeling at home becomes stronger every day, except for mere party purposes,\r\nand I don't believe that sending the fleet to the Baltic even would meet\r\nwith support, as we are under no obligation to do so; though if German\r\noperations were to extend beyond the peninsula, and Copenhagen was menaced,\r\na different policy must, of course, be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Journal goes on:--\r\n\r\n_July 20th_.--The Duc d'Aumale's ball to the Prince of Wales; beautiful\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--To Ongar, to see my uncle, Edward Reeve.\r\n\r\n_24th_.--Went to Aix by Rotterdam, with W. Wallace; met the James Watneys\r\nat Aix. Back by Ostend, August 3rd.\r\n\r\n_August 9th_.--Joined Christine and Hopie at Perth, and proceeded to Skibo.\r\nMarochetti and Seaforth there. Shot with Marochetti. On the 25th left\r\nSkibo. Thence to Brahan. On the 31st, pic-nic to the Falls of Rogie, with\r\nLord Blandford playing on the bugle.\r\n\r\n_September 1st_.--To Raith. 7th, to Arniston. 10th, to Ancrum, Kirklands.\r\n16th, to see Harriet Martineau at Ambleside. 18th.--Home.\r\n\r\n_September 22nd_.--Torry Hill. 23rd, excursion to Margate races, with Lord\r\nKingsdown. Shooting at Torry Hill.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson died at Kirklands on October 4th. Attended the funeral at\r\nAncrum on the 10th. Mr. Liddell read the English service at the grave. To\r\nBrougham on my way back.\r\n\r\n_October 13th_.--Left London on a visit to the Marochettis at Vaux.\r\n\r\n_23rd_.--Visit to the Guizots at Val Richer. 27th, to Caen. 28th, to\r\nAngers. 30th, to Saumur.\r\n\r\n_November 1st_.--Amboise. 2nd, Loches. 4th, Paris.\r\n\r\n_7th_.--Home.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--Dinner at Lord Granville's.\r\n\r\n_23rd_.--Munro of Novar died very suddenly. He was buried at Kensal Green\r\non December 1st.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 24th_. You may conceive with how much surprise and concern\r\nI received this morning a telegram from the factor at Novar, to announce\r\nthe sudden death last night of my old and much-valued friend, the Laird\r\nof Novar, for whom, in spite of his singularities, I had a most sincere\r\nregard. I have telegraphed to Butler Johnstone, in Dumfriesshire, and\r\nto his son at Rokeby, and urged them to go down immediately; but it has\r\noccurred to me that perhaps you would take the train and go over yourself,\r\nas there is no one there to give any directions, and the factor is a new\r\nman. I have also telegraphed to Raith at Cannes.... Let me know if you hear\r\nany particulars. I wonder whether he left a will; very probably none.\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 28th_.--We felt so much alike in our regard for Novar,\r\nthat I was confident that we should feel exactly alike in this most sudden\r\nand terrible catastrophe. I could well have spared many a better man, and,\r\nin spite of his peculiarities, there are few persons for whom I could feel\r\na more sincere and painful regret. For more than twenty years I have shared\r\nwith Novar many of the pleasantest hours of life; and although we were in\r\nmany respects very dissimilar, there are few persons for whom I felt a\r\ngreater sympathy. I have no doubt you decided rightly as to not going to\r\nNovar. My telegram, fortunately, reached Butler Johnstone and his son, both\r\nof whom were in the country, and they speedily got down to Novar. I am told\r\nthey have decided to inter our poor friend in London--a decision I should\r\nnot have taken myself, but which I bow to, as it is their wish.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler Johnstone was so much agitated by this event--for she was\r\npassionately attached to her brother--and so entirely solitary--for there\r\nwas no one with her but young Theobald Butler--that my wife thought it her\r\nduty to go down to Brighton with her on Saturday, to endeavour to calm and\r\ncomfort her until Harry can come back to his mother, which I hope will be\r\nto-morrow....\r\n\r\nI have heard from Ferguson, who little expected to survive his cousin and\r\ninherit Novar.\r\n\r\n_C. O., December 1st_.--I am just returned from the funeral of our poor\r\nfriend at Kensal Green. It was as quiet as possible.... There is no will\r\nat all; but every paper and letter of Novar's is carefully preserved, and\r\naccurately docketed, so that the whole state of his affairs and accounts\r\nmay be seen in a moment. The personal property is enormous; he cannot\r\nhave had much less than 24,000 £ a year. Ferguson's share of the entailed\r\nestates is about 5,000 £ gross rental; everything else goes to the B. J.'s.\r\nI am very much pleased with the spirit in which B. J. takes all this--a\r\ngreat desire to do whatever is right to those who may have any claim on\r\nNovar, and no brag or ostentation. He and Harry immediately determined, as\r\nmoney is no object to them, they would allow nothing to be sold, but would\r\nkeep together the gallery of pictures and everything else Novar collected.\r\nThe quantities of things are incalculable.... I thought these details would\r\ninterest you. For my part, I feel that I have lost one of the persons in\r\nthe world with whom I had spent the most pleasant hours, and for whom I had\r\nan extreme regard.\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions:--\r\n\r\nShooting at Haslemere and Farnborough to the end of the year.\r\n\r\n_January 2nd_, 1865.--Went to Strawberry Hill. A large party in the house;\r\nClarendon, Duc d'Aumale, Lady Hislop, Perrys, &c. On the 5th to Torry Hill.\r\n12th, to Ampthill. 13th, down to Woburn with Lord Wensleydale and Froude.\r\n14th, to the Grove.\r\n\r\nWhen at Torry Hill I got a note from Charles Greville asking me to come up\r\nto see him. I did so on the 10th. It was then he asked me to take charge of\r\nhis journals. Some further conversation took place between us. On the\r\n17th I was with him till half-past seven, and in the same night he died.\r\n[Footnote: See _post_, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\nParis, 1 février.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir,--Je regrette Charles Greville. C'etait l'un des spectateurs\r\npolitiques les plus clairvoyants, les plus fins et les plus équitables que\r\nj'aie rencontrés en ma vie; et un ami fidèle sans se donner tout entier à\r\npersonne. Vous devez regretter beaucoup son amitié et sa société. Ses\r\nmémoires seront bien curieux. Je suis charmé qu'il vous les ait légués.\r\nPersonne ne saura mieux choisir ce qu'il en faut publier, et le moment\r\nopportun pour les publier. Quand vous prendrez une résolution à cet égard,\r\nje vous prie de m'en avertir; vous en désirerez, ce me semble, une édition\r\nfrançaise....\r\n\r\nThe Journal here gives a remarkable contribution to the history of the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1830, the substance of which Reeve afterwards\r\npublished in the 'Edinburgh Review,' in an article on 'Circourt' (October\r\n1881).\r\n\r\n_March 14th_.--The Club elected the Duc d'Aumale and Tennyson.\r\n\r\n_19th_.--Mrs. Gollop [Mrs. Reeve's mother] died. I joined Christine at\r\nStrode, and attended the funeral at Lillington.\r\n\r\n_April 5th_.--M. de Circourt has been staying with us for three weeks;\r\ninexhaustible in memory, anecdote, and conversation. I first knew him at\r\nGeneva in 1830, where he took refuge after the storm of the Revolution, and\r\nwhere he soon afterwards married Anastasia de Klustine.\r\n\r\nI asked him the other day what he knew of the 'Ordonnances' of July. He\r\nwas at that time, with Bois-le-Comte and Vieil-Castel, one of the chief\r\nemployés of Prince Polignac, in the Office of Foreign Affairs; and from his\r\nwonderful memory and facility, Polignac used often to send him to Charles\r\nX., to relate the substance of the despatches from foreign Courts. But,\r\nalthough he was thus versed in foreign affairs, he knew very little of what\r\nwas passing in the interior of France, though from the violence of the\r\nconflict between the Court and the Chamber he foreboded a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nPolignac told him nothing of the Ordinances, nor had he told the Princess,\r\nhis wife; for Circourt dined with them on the day they were signed--it was\r\nSunday, July 25th, 1830. The minister was _distrait_. The Princess got C.\r\naside to the piano after dinner, and said to him: 'Il se passe quelque\r\nchose;--do you know what it is?' Neither of them knew. C. thinks, however,\r\nthat Bois-le-Comte was in Polignac's confidence.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the absence of Marshal Bourmont on the Algerian\r\nexpedition, Polignac was minister of war _ad interim_ [as well as\r\nminister of foreign affairs]; but he had not made the smallest military\r\npreparations, or even inquiries, as to the possibility of putting down\r\na popular tumult. On that Sunday, for the first time, he sent for the\r\nofficers in command of the troops. A dispute arose between them, which\r\nPolignac had to settle. It then turned out that in the whole of the first\r\nmilitary division, which included not only Paris, but Orleans and Rouen and\r\nall the intermediate places, there were not 12,000 men. In Paris itself\r\nabout 3,400 at that moment, including the _gendarmerie_.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this was a political and military combination which the\r\nGovernment had formed, but which I never before heard mentioned by anyone.\r\nPolignac had for some time been intriguing to detach Belgium from the\r\nKing of Holland's dominions--chiefly from a fanatical desire to release a\r\nCatholic population from their Protestant connexion, but in part, also,\r\nfrom a notion that a military demonstration on the side of Belgium would be\r\npopular in France, and would disarm the Opposition. So that the movement\r\nwhich took place at Brussels shortly after the Revolution of July, and was\r\nattributed to the example of that democratic explosion, had, in fact, been\r\nprepared by Polignac himself. This is strange enough; but what is still\r\nmore strange is that the very means taken to promote this lawless object\r\nproved to be the ruin of Charles X. and his minister.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the occupation of Belgium, or at least of a demonstration on\r\nthe frontier, they had assembled two large camps at Luneville and St.-Omer;\r\nand in these camps the bulk of the available forces of the kingdom\r\nwere collected, especially as Bourmont had with him a considerable and\r\nwell-appointed army in Africa. So that at the very moment when troops were\r\nmost needed in Paris, one portion of the King's army was beyond the seas,\r\nand another out of reach on the Belgian frontier.\r\n\r\nBourmont was perfectly aware that some such scheme as that of the\r\nOrdinances was hatching, and the King had given him special orders to\r\nterminate the campaign in Algeria, to carry off the treasure from the\r\nKasbah, and bring the troops back to France, as soon as possible. About\r\na month before the Revolution, a ciphered despatch came from Bourmont\r\n--which, I think, Circourt said he was told to transcribe--in which the\r\nmarshal earnestly entreated the King to take no important step till his\r\nreturn; adding that he hoped in a few weeks to terminate the African\r\nexpedition, and to prove to the King what he was capable of in his\r\nMajesty's service. He had calculated that by the month of September he\r\ncould bring the greater part of the army hack to Paris, and that the\r\nsuccess they had recently had in Africa had attached the troops to himself,\r\nas their commander, so that he would be in a condition to crush all\r\nresistance; and had this plan been pursued, it is by no means impossible\r\nthat the _coup d'état_ might have succeeded, as we have seen on some\r\nsubsequent occasions.\r\n\r\nBut Bourmont's despatch in cipher had exactly the opposite effect from that\r\ncontemplated by the marshal. It produced in the mind of Polignac a violent\r\njealousy of his military colleague, and the determination to act in\r\nBourmont's absence, so as to have all the credit to himself, and remain at\r\nthe head of the King's Government. On the day the Ordinances were signed,\r\nPolignac said to Circourt: 'From this day the King begins to reign, which\r\nhe has not done before.' These were the motives which precipitated the\r\nblow, and caused it to overwhelm its authors with ruin and confusion.\r\n\r\n_April 8th_.--I was elected a corresponding member of the Académie des\r\nSciences Morales et Politiques, in France.\r\n\r\n_14th_.--Went to Paris, and on the 22nd took my seat at the Institute.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, April 23rd_.--Fould is not reasonable about Mexico; for he well\r\nknows that it is we who had to complain of France, and not France of us, in\r\nthe original convention, and that ever since we got out of it, so far from\r\nthwarting French designs, we have done what was in our power to support\r\nthem; our Government can't help to float a bad loan, but I am sure we have\r\ndone the French no harm at Washington. It will be good policy on the part\r\nof Maximilian to encourage Confederate soldiers, provided they don't come\r\nand squat in too great numbers. I understand that the French army is not to\r\nbe withdrawn until it is no longer wanted by Maximilian, but that will not\r\nbe till the day of judgement--if then.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Algeria is an inscrutable business. McMahon, I am told, has\r\ninsisted strongly upon it, and says that the Imperial presence is\r\nindispensable to _relever_ the tone of the colony; but that is hardly\r\nreason enough for such a _grosse affaire_ as absenting himself from Paris\r\nfor six weeks; but if he wishes to create alarm and make people feel how\r\nmuch he and social order are bound up together, and that they want him\r\nmore than he them, then the expedition has a motive, and may have a great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nPalmerston had the gout all last week, and was unable to attend the Cabinet\r\nyesterday, but he is expected in town tomorrow, so I hope it is a slight\r\nattack. The uneasiness on one side and excitement on the other, whenever he\r\nis ailing, are curious to observe; for it is pretty generally understood\r\nthat until he dies there will be no real shuffle of cards. Last autumn the\r\nTories talked tall about the majority that the general election was to give\r\nthem, but of late they have come down very much, and the best informed\r\namong them now say that things will remain pretty much as they are.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_April 27th_.--Excursion to Port Royal and Dampierre, where we were\r\nreceived by order of the Duc de Luynes. Circourt was with us. 28th, to\r\nFontainebleau. Met William Stirling and Lady Anna there; they were just\r\nmarried. 30th, races in Bois de Boulogne. Took Mrs. Henry Baring there.\r\nDined at the Embassy.\r\n\r\n_May 3rd_.--Excursion to Reims with Circourt and Belvèze.[Footnote: The\r\nComte de Belvèze, an intimate friend of the Circourts, a man, Reeve wrote,\r\n'of great wit and discernment.' In 1873 he had printed, for private\r\ncirculation, a small volume of _Pensées, Maximes et Reflèxions_, a copy of\r\nwhich he gave Reeve, who 'highly valued it for its intrinsic merit and its\r\nrarity.'] Back to London by Lille and Laon.\r\n\r\n_13th_.--My uncle, Tom Reeve, the rector, died. I attended the funeral, and\r\nwent on to Thorpe Abbotts.\r\n\r\n_June 10th_.--Party given by the Hudson's Bay Company to see their ships at\r\nGravesend. Dined there.\r\n\r\nWent to Bracknell and Ascot.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, June 11th_. I make you my sincere compliment upon the article,\r\n[Footnote: 'Dissolution of Parliament,' by Reeve. It appeared in the July\r\nnumber of the _Review_.] and thank you for giving me an early read of it.\r\nIt is by far the ablest defence I have yet seen for the donothingness of\r\nthe Government about Reform; and you have most skilfully brought all the\r\ndifferent schemes face to face, in order to knock their heads together, at\r\nthe same time that you show yourself, as the organ of the Whig party, to be\r\nliberal and progressive, and not only ready, but anxious, to adopt any\r\nplan of Reform that will really effect that which reasonable men unite in\r\ndesiring. I think the article will do great good; and I only wish that it\r\ncould be circulated among classes rather lower than the ordinary readers of\r\nthe 'Edinburgh Review.'\r\n\r\nMight you not in the last page enlarge a little more upon the opposition\r\nwhich the Tories, for party purposes, or from shortsightedness, have always\r\nmade to Liberal measures? For that in reality is the strong case against\r\nthem; and in judging of their fitness for power, the electors should\r\nconsider how the country would have stood if their persistent opposition\r\nhad been successful; how we should have passed through the political crisis\r\nof '48 if the Corn Laws had been unrepealed; or the cotton famine, if\r\nFree-trade had not been established. The electors should also well consider\r\nwhether they will accept, as governors and guides, men who predicted evils\r\nof the worst kind from measures which have produced the happiest results.\r\n\r\nAll these points are well alluded to in the last page, but they seem to me\r\nto want a few grains of salt; and we may be sure that Lord Robert Cecil\r\n[Footnote: The present Marquis of Salisbury. His elder brother, Viscount\r\nCranborne, died three days after the date of this letter, June 14th.] in\r\nthe 'Quarterly' will pepper the Whigs abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe Journal at this time has:--\r\n\r\nGout in July. Went to Aix on the 25th. The Aumales, Alcocks, and Lord St.\r\nGermans there. Home on August 17th.\r\n\r\n_August 9th_.--To Scotland. We went again to Skibo. Harry Butler Johnstone\r\nthere. Stayed at Skibo till the 30th. Then to Brahan. Found the Fergusons\r\nat Novar. Lord Kingsdown had taken Holme House, near Nairn. Went to see him\r\nthere. Cawdor Castle. Then to Pitcorthie [James Moncreiff's] [Footnote: At\r\nthis time Lord Advocate. Created a baronet in 1871, and a peer, as Lord\r\nMoncreiff, in 1874.] and Raith and Abington.\r\n\r\n_September 23rd_.--Dined with Lord Granville to meet Castalia Campbell and\r\nLady Acton. Lord G. was married on the 26th [to Miss Campbell].\r\n\r\nTo Torry Hill in October; also to Badger Hall and High Legh, and Loseley\r\n(then rented by Thomson Hankey).\r\n\r\n_November 15th_.--Went down to Woodnorton [near Evesham], to see the\r\nAumales at their farm. Shot there.\r\n\r\nBut the great topic of the latter part of the year, the subject which was\r\nin everyone's mind, was the cattle plague--the rinderpest--which threatened\r\nto become a matter of extreme national importance. When, at the time that\r\nnow is, people are inclined to grumble at the precautionary measures\r\nadopted by Government, they should look back to the records of 1865 and\r\nread of the very serious alarm then felt. Writing to Dempster, himself a\r\nhigh authority on agricultural questions, Reeve naturally spoke of this,\r\nand the correspondence is largely filled with such sentences as:--\r\n\r\n_September 22nd_.--A nearer acquaintance with the cattle disease is a very\r\ndisagreeable addition to one's knowledge. They are afraid it will last for\r\nmany years, and sweep off a great portion of the cattle in the kingdom....\r\nYou'll think I have got the rinderpest myself to write about nothing but\r\nthese brutes.\r\n\r\n_September 28th_.--The disease has now spread to sheep, and I verily\r\nbelieve we shall have a meat famine.\r\n\r\n_October 12th_.--The ravages of the disease increase. We were to have gone\r\nto pay two visits in Essex this week, but our hosts are so distracted by\r\nthe loss of their kine and the absence of dairy produce that they broke up\r\ntheir party and put us off.\r\n\r\n_October 18th_.--The opinion of the Cattle Commission is that nothing can\r\nbe done to stay the plague without putting a stop to all transport or\r\nmovement of live cattle; and I expect this will be done. But how are we to\r\nbe fed?\r\n\r\n_November 23rd_.--The Lords of the Council have at last resolved to give\r\nall local authorities in Britain the power of stopping the entry of cattle\r\ninto their own district, and all beasts brought to the Metropolitan Market\r\nare to be killed there.\r\n\r\nAnd thus this plague, the illness and death of Lord Palmerston, and--more\r\npersonal--the alarming illness and slow, lingering convalescence of Miss\r\nCharlotte Dempster--'my fair contributor,' as Reeve used to call her--fill\r\nthe correspondence of the year. One note only, an account of Reeve's visit\r\nto Woodnorton, has a more particular interest.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 23rd_.--My last campaign has been in Worcestershire, where\r\nI went to see a barnful of princes and princesses in a house much more like\r\na very wild Highland shooting quarter than an Englishman's hunting-box.\r\nHowever, this only made the whole party more jolly; and as the stables are\r\nvery superior to the house, I shall entreat them, the next time I go, to\r\ngive me a loose box instead of a bedroom. Cutbush is supposed to have slept\r\non a dresser in the servants' hall; and a stray Frenchman who arrived one\r\nevening was laid up in the smoking-room, on a sofa.\r\n\r\nAnd, according to the Journal, the year closed with--\r\n\r\nVisits to Farnborough, Denbigh (Haslemere), and Timsbury [Ralph Dutton's,\r\nnear Romsey].\r\n\r\nBetween Reeve and the Duttons there was a friendship of many years'\r\nstanding, and they were there, wrote Mrs. Reeve, 'a pleasant little party\r\nof ten, only Henry has had a very bad fit of gout and could not join the\r\nshooters, or even the dinner-table some days: too provoking!' They remained\r\nat Timsbury for a week, and then:--\r\n\r\n_January 10th_.--A pleasant party at Torry Hill, with Sir E. Head and Kit.\r\nPemberton. Shooting in the snow, which was heavy.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--Sir C. Eastlake was buried.\r\n\r\nOne day at a dinner party of Royal Academicians at Eastlake's, they were\r\ndiscussing the merits of Solomon the painter and praising him. 'Yes,' said\r\nValentine Prinsep, 'but Solomon in all his glory is not R.A.ed like one of\r\nthese.'\r\n\r\n_24th_. We were invited rather late in the morning to the christening\r\nof Sir Robert and Lady Emily Peel's infant daughter, and to a banquet\r\nafterwards. Christine came down to my office at two o'clock, and we went\r\nacross to Whitehall Chapel. Sir Robert stood _rayonnant_ at the door; Lady\r\nEmily looked the picture of maternal beauty; and in the chapel we found a\r\nsmall but remarkable party--Duke and Duchess of Wellington, Lord and Lady\r\nRussell, the Gladstones, Lady Ely, the Dufferins, &c., about fifty in all.\r\nLord Russell said he had never been inside that building [Footnote: Now the\r\nMuseum of the Royal United Service Institution.] before. Gladstone was very\r\ncordial, and we joined our enthusiasm about the roof of the building and\r\nthe Rubenses. The Queen stood Godmother.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony we all adjourned to Whitehall Gardens. I was unluckily\r\nobliged to go away, but Christine stayed for the luncheon, which was\r\nsuperb. Gladstone proposed the health of the infant.\r\n\r\n_25th_.--Dinner at Orleans House, on Condé's departure for his journey to\r\nthe East; Murchison and Trevelyan there. The Prince de Condé [Footnote: The\r\neldest son of the Duc d'Aumale, born in 1845, died at Sydney on May 24th,\r\n1866. The Duke's second and third sons lived only a few weeks; the fourth,\r\nthe Duc de Guise, born in 1854, died in 1872.] reached Sydney, but caught a\r\nfever there and died. His poor mother never recovered the shock.\r\n\r\n_27th_.--John Edward Taylor, my oldest friend,[Footnote: A first cousin,\r\nelder son of Edward Taylor; see _ante_, vol. i. p. 167.] died.\r\n\r\nA couple of months later Mr. Taylor's daughter, Lucy, was married to\r\nWilliam Markby, going out to Calcutta as a judge on a salary of 4,000 £\r\na year. 'She is a very lucky girl' wrote Mrs. Reeve, 'her face her sole\r\nfortune, to win the love of a man so clear-headed and warm-hearted.'\r\n\r\nCircourt came on a visit to us in March. We went together to Lincoln. I\r\nspent Easter at Lord Wharncliffe's at Wortley, with the Samuel Bakers (the\r\nAfrican traveller) and the Tankervilles, and rejoined Circourt at Frystone\r\n(R. M. Milnes'). Thence to Ampthill, also with Circourt.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_March 1st_.--I send you the proof of the judgement in Edwards _v_.\r\nMoss, corrected and purged of some of its colloquial pleonastic forms of\r\nexpression. It is very difficult to reduce a speech to the accuracy of a\r\nwritten composition. In doing so, the merit of the speech is lost, and the\r\n'redacted' elements form a very bad paper. Old Tommy Townshend, when he\r\nheard of a good speech being printed, used to ask 'How does it read?--for\r\nif it reads well, it was not a good speech.' A judgement orally delivered\r\nextempore may be satisfactory to the ear, but when reduced to paper, the\r\nsentences become involved and jejune.\r\n\r\nThe diction of a good composition is [Greek: lexis katestrammeon],\r\nthe diction of a speech is [Greek: lexis eiromeon]. I cannot understand\r\nhow the senators or the Roman plebs could follow or endure the elaborate\r\nperiods of Cicero, if they were delivered as written. I am sure with the\r\nfuneral oration of Pericles, a common audience would have sat with mouths\r\nopen, incapable of following a single sentence. So also with the orations\r\nof Livy. In fact, if the speeches delivered in the Roman Senate or the\r\nAthenian Forum were anything like the speeches reported, to listen to them\r\nmust have been a great strain upon the mind and attention of the hearer.\r\n\r\nI am writing to you whilst a learned counsel is arguing, but whose words\r\nand meaning are so obscure and involved that I am much in the condition of\r\nmy supposed [Greek: aplous hakroataes] of the funeral oration.\r\n\r\nThe Journal goes on to speak of a subject of peculiar literary and\r\nhistorical interest.\r\n\r\n_April 11th_.--Started with Christine and Circourt for Paris _viâ_ Havre,\r\nand at Rouen paid a visit to the Cardinal-Archbishop (Bonnechose).\r\n\r\nThe publication in 1864 of three volumes of the letters of Marie\r\nAntoinette, under the title 'Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette et Madame\r\nElisabeth. Lettres et Documents inédits;' publiés par F. Feuillet de\r\nConches, and of another volume--' Correspondance inédite de Marie\r\nAntoinette. Publiée sur les Documents originaux;' par le Comte Paul Vogt\r\nd'Hunolstein--had excited a keen controversy, in which one party, led by\r\nProfessor von Sybel, the historian of the Revolution, maintained that the\r\nletters were forgeries. On the other hand, Reeve wrote an article for\r\nthe 'Edinburgh Review' of April 1866, on the 'Correspondence of Marie\r\nAntoinette' in which he argued that the letters edited by M. d'Hunolstein\r\nwere of very doubtful authenticity, but that those of the larger work of\r\nM. Feuillet de Conches were genuine. His visit to Paris gave him the\r\nopportunity to make a further examination, of which, and his interview with\r\nSybel, he wrote a curious account.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, April 15th_.--I called on M. Feuillet de Conches, the editor\r\nof the Marie Antoinette letters, whose authenticity is impugned, and on\r\nleaving his house I called on Lavergne, where I met M. de Sybel, the German\r\nprofessor, by whom these charges have been most actively brought and\r\ndisseminated. I found that M. de Sybel, though in Paris, had not seen\r\nanything of Feuillet's collection, though he had publicly stated that he\r\nwas going to Paris to clear up the whole story. Upon this I assured him\r\n(as was the fact) that I knew Feuillet would receive him with the utmost\r\ncourtesy, if he would call upon him, and would show him anything and\r\neverything in his collections bearing on this matter; and as he appeared\r\nto hesitate, I offered myself to conduct and introduce him. Upon this he\r\nhesitated still more, and at last said that the fact was that his mind was\r\nso fully made up on the subject, and his conviction that these documents\r\nare forged is so complete, that no amount of ocular evidence would shake\r\nit, and he should only conclude that the author of these fabrications was a\r\nvery skilful fellow.\r\n\r\nUpon this I desisted from any further attempt to bring M. de Sybel\r\nacquainted with M. Feuillet's collection, but I made this note of the\r\nconversation (which took place in the presence of M. de Lavergne) to show\r\nhow strong M. de Sybel's prepossessions are. I have myself again examined\r\nthe documents, and though I have doubts as to one or two of them, said to\r\nproceed from the Abbé Vermond's papers, I see no reason to disbelieve the\r\ngenuineness of the vast majority of the letters of the Queen which Feuillet\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nHome on April 26th.\r\n\r\n_May_.--Dr. Watson said, dining at the Literary Club, that he had been\r\npresent at the death of Lord Palmerston. He retained his usual courtesy and\r\ncheerfulness in his last illness, and when Lady Palmerston came into the\r\nroom he kissed his hand to her. The immediate cause of his death was his\r\ntaking a walk on the terrace at Brocket without his hat. The apothecary\r\nremonstrated--upon which he said: 'Oh! it's only what the bathers call\r\ntaking a \"header.\"' As the hour of dissolution approached he lost\r\nhis consciousness, but still spoke occasionally. His last words were\r\n(apparently as if his mind was at work on a treaty) 'That's article\r\nninety-eight; now go on to the next.' Very characteristic end.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, June 9th_.--I had little doubt of the war, and I now consider\r\nit as begun. With the exception of the Italians and M. de Bismarck,\r\neveryone is entering on it with regret and uneasiness. I have never known\r\nFrance so unanimous in the desire for peace; but notwithstanding the\r\ninjury to our interests and the shock to our opinions, the country has no\r\nconfidence in its right to resist, and has lost the habit of it. There\r\nwill be grumblings and prophecies of misfortune, but there will be no\r\nopposition; and if there should be any military success, followed by\r\nterritorial aggrandisement, people will forget their ill humour, and will\r\neven applaud a little, but always without confidence. It is impossible to\r\nstray with impunity from the path of sound policy; as soon as we leave it,\r\nwe enter on the wrong path and advance by that. In this life it is not\r\npossible to remain stationary.\r\n\r\nI understand your political attitude. There is no reason why you should\r\ntake part in the struggle; but what I do not understand, what I regret, is\r\nthe manifest uncertainty of your opinions. Not only do you do nothing, but\r\nyou seem as if you did not know what to believe. As lookers-on you are\r\nundecided, as actors you are inert. In the state of trouble and weakness\r\nin which the intelligence of Europe is now plunged, you, simply by letting\r\nyour opinions be clearly seen, by the directness of your language, might\r\nhave an enormous influence on the course of events. But in England, as\r\neverywhere else, the idea of moral force seems lost. It is true that such\r\nidea requires a knowledge of what one thinks, and of what one desires. It\r\nis possible not to give material support to a cause, but it is necessary to\r\nhave one.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I am extremely glad that Lord Clarendon remains at the Foreign\r\nOffice. He will, perhaps, see more clearly, will act with less want of\r\nforesight than others. Is it true that, on account of the state of affairs\r\non the Continent, there is in England a tacit suspension of hostilities\r\nbetween the two parties, and that the Cabinet is no longer seriously\r\nattacked?...\r\n\r\nJe suis charmé que le second volume de mes 'Meditations' vous ait\r\nintéressé. Je ne sais pas le nom de la personne qui fait, dans 'l'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' un article sur le premier volume. Dites-moi si elle aurait quelque\r\nenvie de parler du second, et si vous voulez que je vous en fasse envoyer,\r\npour elle, un exemplaire. Most cordially yours,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\nWar broke out between Prussia and Austria in June.\r\n\r\n_June 9th_.--Party down to Gravesend by water to see the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany's ships. Dinner at Gravesend.\r\n\r\n_July 13th_.--To Aix-la-Chapelle by way of Paris. Heard Mignet read his\r\nnotice of Tocqueville at the Institute. Spent a fortnight at Aix, and\r\nvisited Bruges in our way home.\r\n\r\n_August 11th_.--Went to Novar, by Perth. Thence to Braban, to Ardross, and\r\nto Foss, where Lord Kingsdown had taken a moor. Then to Dunnichen; called\r\nat Glamis and Kinnaird Castle. Then to Eaith, and to Lord Belhaven's at\r\nWishaw; the Warwicks and Sir A. Alison there. Home on September 17th.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_Dunnichen, September 10th_.--Your kind letter from Paris reached me at\r\nNovar, at the precise moment when I was about to take the field with the\r\nnew laird on August 13th. It gave me real pleasure to have something of\r\nyour company on that day; and when we had reached the back of Fyrish, and\r\ncould command the Dornoch Firth and the hills beyond it, even to Dunrobin,\r\nI looked with affectionate eyes to the woods of Skibo.\r\n\r\nThe season has been favourable. Raith and I--neither of us a first-class\r\nwalker--killed seventy brace on the Monday, and I got thirty brace alone on\r\nseveral succeeding days. From Novar we went to Brahan, where everything\r\nis as lively as usual, and Seaforth in great force,... I then joined Lord\r\nKingsdown at Foss, on Loch Tummel, a delightful place in the centre of the\r\nPerthshire Highlands, where you see all Scotland at your feet, from Ben\r\nNevis to Lochnagar. By this time the grouse were becoming wild, and we had\r\ndescended to fifteen or sixteen brace a day, but we had a splendid drive of\r\nblue hares, and slew 367 of them. I then came on here, where I find a\r\nmost comfortable house, a most kind reception, and a most sociable\r\nneighbourhood.... All in short is extremely pleasant, and it is most\r\nagreeable to see George so perfectly in his place, and at the head of a\r\nwell-managed estate....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_September 5th_.--I am anxious, before I leave for the Continent, to know\r\nif I can be of any service at the sittings of the Judicial Committee. My\r\npresent purpose is to go to Biarritz, and thence to Italy. But if I can be\r\nof utility, and am really wanted, I would return from Biarritz by November\r\n1st, and could devote the whole of November to diligent attendance on\r\nthe Judicial Committee. I am sorry that I cannot offer to attend during\r\nDecember, as matters of a pressing nature will then require my presence in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, very desirable that the sittings of the Judicial Committee\r\nshould be certain and continuous at and during a considerable portion of\r\nthe year; and I should be glad to see the practice adopted of its beginning\r\nto sit on November 1st in every year, and continuing its sittings until\r\nChristmas if required. You will know whether the state of business at\r\npresent renders this desirable....\r\n\r\nLord Justice Knight Bruce is a great invalid, and it is hardly fair to\r\nexpect that, after a laborious term, the Lords Justices should at once\r\ncommence sitting at the Privy Council. These considerations induce me to\r\nwrite to you. But you will fully understand that, if it is possible to do\r\nwithout further aid, I shall be much obliged to you not to accept my offer.\r\nI shall not write to the President or the Lord Chancellor until I have\r\nheard from you.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_C. O., September 28th_.--Under the peculiar circumstances of the present\r\nyear and the state of business in the Court, the Lord Chancellor thinks\r\nit right to acquiesce in your lordship's suggestion that the Judicial\r\nCommittee should sit one month earlier than usual in order to dispose of\r\nthe existing arrear of causes. The Lord Chancellor is, however, of opinion\r\nthat this sitting in Michaelmas term should be regarded as exceptional and\r\nnot to be drawn into a precedent, and that it will be expedient hereafter\r\nto adhere to the established practice and to the order in Council which\r\ndirects the sittings to be held after each term. For many years the\r\nsittings have been invariably so held in December, February, and June and\r\nJuly; and at each sitting the whole of the business ready for hearing has\r\nbeen disposed of. The only exception to this order occurred last summer in\r\nconsequence of the illness of Sir James Colvile; and the consequence is\r\nthat (for the first time for many years) there is now an arrear to be\r\ndisposed of. Your lordship's timely assistance will, however, enable the\r\ncourt to clear off this arrear by this extraordinary sitting; and it is not\r\nto be anticipated that the same necessity will occur again, although it\r\nundoubtedly exists at the present time. When November 1st approaches, I\r\nshall have the honour to send the printed cases and the usual summons to\r\nyour lordship's residence in London, and I shall give ample notice to the\r\nparties that the Judicial Committee will meet for the despatch of business\r\non that day.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Chelmsford_[Footnote: At this time Lord Chancellor.]\r\n\r\n7 Eaton Square, October 3rd.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--Lord Westbury's letter is satisfactory. Your communication to\r\nhim, which was highly judicious, has contributed mainly to put things on\r\nthe right footing.\r\n\r\nKnight Bruce's state of health, following upon what I should think must\r\nhave been for some time his felt incapacity for work, ought to be a warning\r\nto him to terminate a life of useful labour by an honourable retirement. If\r\nthe hint is lost upon him, he will be a great impediment to the efficiency\r\nof the Judicial Committee.\r\n\r\nI suppose the temporary assistance of Lord Westbury will not dispense with\r\nthe necessity of providing some permanent addition to the strength of the\r\ntribunal. Your suggestion as to Vice-Chancellor Kindersley quite met my\r\nviews, and I suppose might still be carried out with advantage. Of course I\r\ncan do nothing of this sort without Lord Derby's sanction, and therefore I\r\nshould like to have your confirmation of my opinion that this is the best\r\nplan that can be resorted to for the present, before I communicate with him\r\non the subject. A letter sent to my house will be forwarded in my box which\r\nI receive daily. Yours sincerely, CHELMSFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nVisits to Sparrow's Herne and to Shendish (Charles Longman's), Parnborough\r\nand Torry Hill. The Judicial Committee sat early-November 1st.\r\n\r\n_November 8th_.--Lord Westbury, Froude, Lecky, Mrs. Norton, Bayleys,\r\nSimpson, and Longman dined with us. It was very amusing. [Mrs. Reeve wrote\r\nof it as 'brilliant;' and of Lord Westbury as resembling Falstaff and Lord\r\nBacon rolled into one.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest critical notice of the battle of Lissa, fought on July 20th,\r\nappeared in the 'Revue des deux Mondes' of November 15th. It was at the\r\ntime, and has been ever since, generally attributed to the Prince de\r\nJoinville; an error which gives the following letter a more especial\r\ninterest, though it may be thought doubtful whether the suggestion offered\r\nby the Prince was correct:--\r\n\r\n_From the Prince de Joinville_\r\n\r\nWoodnorton, 22 novembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Mon frère Aumale vient de me communiquer votre\r\naimable lettre, à laquelle je m'empresse de répondre. Les éloges que vous\r\ndonnez à l'auteur de l'article sur Lissa sont très-mérités, car le\r\ntravail est très-intéressant; mais ils ne sont pas pour moi, car je suis\r\n_complètement_ étranger à la paternité de ce remarquable morceau, auquel je\r\nne reproche qu'une chose--la sevérité de ses jugements sur un homme dans la\r\nposition de Persano.\r\n\r\nJ'ignore absolument le nom de l'auteur; mais le style élégant, la précision\r\ndes informations et quelques détails d'opinion que je ne partage pas\r\nm'avaient fait supposer que nous devions attribuer à Jurien de la Gravière\r\nle travail en question. En tous cas, quelque soit l'auteur, je demande\r\nà tous mes amis de lui renvoyer le mérite et la responsabilité qui lui\r\nappartiennent.\r\n\r\nCroyez toujours, Monsieur, à mes sentiments d'amitié.\r\n\r\nFR. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_G. O., November 28th_.--I received the revised judgements yesterday, and\r\nhave sent them to the printers for correction. I will take care that your\r\nemendations are carefully made, and I will again look them all carefully\r\nover. Unless I hear again from you to the contrary, I do not understand\r\nthat you wish to see another revise of them (as it is termed) before they\r\nare issued.\r\n\r\nIn spite of your own preference for the 'wild freshness of morning' and all\r\nthe dewdrops hanging on the roses, I must be allowed to assure you that, in\r\nmy poor judgement, they are improved by this severe revision, and that the\r\njudicial style is, like Musidora, when 'unadorned adorned the most.' Of\r\nthat style I think these judgements will be quoted hereafter as masterly\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Kingsdown_\r\n\r\nTorry Hill, Sittingbourne: January 7th, 1867.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I have read your paper, and have no hesitation in saying\r\nthat I think the smallness of your salary quite a scandal and a disgrace\r\nto the Court of which you are so important an officer. Knowing as I do the\r\npast services which, during a period of more than twenty years, you have\r\nrendered to the board, whilst its position has been gradually settling,\r\nI should say that 2,000 £. a year would be not at all more than a fair\r\nremuneration to you during the remainder of your term of office. If the\r\ncountry could be certain, by the same salary, of securing an equally\r\nefficient successor, I should think it money well laid out. Your duties\r\nare of a very peculiar character; and often require, in addition to the\r\nqualities required for the discharge of the ordinary routine duties of a\r\nregistrar, others of a much rarer description. The correspondence with the\r\ndifferent tribunals whose decisions are reviewed, and with the different\r\ndepartments of the Government, which are sometimes disposed to shift to the\r\nJudicial Committee the determination of matters not properly belonging to\r\nit, demand not unfrequently the exercise of great tact, discretion, and\r\ndelicacy. But unfortunately a large salary does not always secure services\r\nof corresponding value, and sometimes, I am afraid, rather has an opposite\r\ntendency, and operates as a temptation to jobbery. On the whole, I should\r\nsay that 1,500 £. a year would be a fair offer to a new man; but I think\r\nthat the Treasury should have the power to increase it to any amount\r\nnot exceeding 2,000 £. after ten or fifteen years' service, on the\r\nrecommendation of the committee.\r\n\r\nThe next letter, from Lord Wensleydale, is interesting as a piece of verbal\r\ncriticism; showing, also, how a pilot in avoiding Scylla may easily run\r\nhis bark into Charybdis, or how a writer, whilst objecting to a harmless\r\n'firstly,' may perpetrate an atrocious 'differ with.'\r\n\r\nAmpthill Park, January 31st.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I was much pleased to hear that 'firstly' was an error. I\r\nhope you will take some course to indicate your judgement--'a very best\r\nauthority'--and to prevent the 'Edinburgh Review' giving the word its high\r\nauthority. I have taken every opportunity to amend Acts of Parliament when\r\nI find the error in Dom. Proc. I have a sort of mania on the subject.\r\n\r\nI have not had an opportunity of looking at the Bishop of Oxford's case.\r\nI differ with him entirely about the Banns case, and, between ourselves,\r\nthink he is oily and saponaceous.--Yours ever sincerely,\r\n\r\nWENSLEYDALE.\r\n\r\nThe following, from Professor--afterwards Sir Richard--Owen, seems to refer\r\nto a proposed review of the Duke of Argyll's 'Reign of Law,' and possibly,\r\nalso, of the Rev. Edwin Sidney's 'Conversations on the Bible and Science.'\r\nWhether Owen was too drastic in his methods or not does not certainly\r\nappear; but, for some reason, the article was either not written or not\r\npublished, though the friendly relations between Owen and Reeve remained\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nSheen Lodge, Richmond Park, March 9th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--The end and aim of the 'Reign of Law' is to exalt our\r\nconceptions of its head, and to destroy pretenders to the throne. The Duke\r\nhas shown, as you observe, caution in avoiding the latter application. But\r\nthe old 'Edinburgh' was once eminently iconoclastic, and its reputation\r\nstill floats on the brave work of its youth. I fear, too we should have\r\nlost some best bits and hits of dear old Sydney had his editor been too\r\nprecise in defining a personality. As to the other old Sidney, I, too, know\r\nhim well; his libellus _is_ small game, but it is the type of a class doing\r\nmuch mischief. You think I have been too outspoken. Believe me, it is only\r\na question of time; and _you_ will speak out quite as plainly when the\r\n'Forlorn' has made the breach safe. But one would wish to see the 'Blue and\r\nYellow' in the post of honour.\r\n\r\nI had misgivings at the first that I might be unfit for your want. My time\r\ndraws on, and, under a sense of responsibility for its use, I cannot write\r\nplatitudes.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nRICHD. OWEN.\r\n\r\nThe Journal for 1867 begins with--\r\n\r\nUsual engagements in the early part of the year. Circourt came in April,\r\nand we went together to Norwich.\r\n\r\nTo Paris in April. Met Mrs. Grote and Hayward on the road. Morny gave me a\r\ncard to see the Great Exhibition before it opened. A great banquet at the\r\nEmbassy on the 25th. On the 30th with Chevalier to Lemaire's fabrique. He\r\ngave me my aluminium binocle. Ball at the Marine. Dined at Julian Fane's.\r\n[Footnote: The secretary of the embassy.] Binet came to Paris from Geneva.\r\nMay 6th, went to see Thiers on the last evening. May 7th, dined with Mon,\r\nthe Spanish ambassador. Home on the 8th.\r\n\r\n_May 11th_.--Some of the Novar pictures were sold. I bought my Cuyp, small\r\nClaude, P. Veronese, Watts, Rubens' drawing, Palma Vecchio, and some small\r\nones.\r\n\r\nVisit to Torry Hill in June, but Lord Kingsdown was dying. [Footnote: He\r\ndied on October 7th.] I took De Mussy down to see him. I went there again\r\nin July.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Kingsdown_\r\n\r\n_Torry Hill, June 26th_.--It is most kind in you to write to me as often as\r\nyou do, and always whenever you have anything agreeable to tell me. Both\r\nyour last letters are full of such matter. It is inexpressibly pleasing to\r\nme to receive so many marks as I do of the kindness and affection of my\r\nfriends; and if any or all of those who professed a disposition to come and\r\nsee me would do so, I should be delighted to receive them, collectively\r\nor individually. I have a letter from Cranworth this morning, most kindly\r\noffering to come down here on Saturday next. If you could look up and send\r\ndown anybody as a companion to him, it would be more agreeable to him and\r\nto me. Possibly Peel [Footnote: Sir Lawrence Peel.] might be induced to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nI have not, of course, the face to ask you to come down on Saturday, but I\r\nhold you to your promise to see me again here before you go to the North.\r\n\r\nI am, truly and gratefully yours,\r\n\r\nKINGSDOWN.\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions some of the functions of the season.\r\n\r\n_June 27th_.--Dinner at home to the F. Stanleys, [Footnote: The present\r\nEarl and Countess of Derby.] Mme. Mohl, Seaforth, Lecky, Blumenthal, T.\r\nBruces, Fords remarkably pleasant.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--Dinner at the Duc de Chartres', at Ham. The Russells, Clarendons,\r\nSaxe-Weimars, Waldegraves, A. Kinnaird.\r\n\r\n_July 10th_.--Holland House garden party. Lady Derby's party to the Pasha\r\nof Egypt. On the 19th, grand ball, at the India Office, to the Sultan.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Cairns_\r\n\r\n5 Cromwell Houses, South Kensington, July 17th.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--I enclose the Indian judgement, revised, and also the 'Agra'\r\njudgement [Footnote: A case of collision in the Channel between the ship\r\n'Agra' and a bark, 'Elizabeth Jenkins.' The judgement was delivered on the\r\n20th by Sir William Erle.] with a few verbal alterations. I am sorry I\r\ncannot deliver the latter; but the state of our work in Chancery is such\r\nthat the sittings cannot be well curtailed, even for an hour. I trust some\r\nmember of the board, with a strong nautical twang, will be so good as to\r\ndeliver it; and if the speaker could but adopt that hitch of the trouser\r\nwhich made Lord Clarence Paget so effective in the House of Commons, it\r\nwould, I have no doubt, add much to the effect of a composition otherwise\r\nso tame.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CAIRNS.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Kingsdown_\r\n\r\n_Torry Hill, July 30th_.--I hear you are starting for Scotland the end of\r\nthis week, and I cannot let you go without repeating to you once more my\r\nearnest and most cordial thanks for the great kindness which you have shown\r\nto me during my long sickness, both in constantly writing to me and in many\r\nother ways. I wish I had a letter from you this morning, for the upshot of\r\nwhat passed last night in the House of Lords far passes my comprehension.\r\nIf you should find occasionally a leisure half-hour, and will employ it in\r\ninforming me of your proceedings on the moors, I shall be very grateful.\r\n\r\nI think it not impossible that in the course of your wanderings you may\r\nfall in with Jowett. If you do, pray explain to him how very sensible I was\r\nof his friendship in offering to come down here to see me, and how very\r\nmuch I was mortified at being obliged to decline his offer. In my present\r\ncondition, it is absurd even to suppose plans for the future; but I do not\r\n_quite_ despair of seeing you here during this next partridge or pheasant\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions that--\r\n\r\nGladstone agreed to write the political article for the 'Edinburgh' in\r\nOctober. It was called 'Sequel to the Session.' Curious conversation with\r\nhim about the Irish Church.\r\n\r\n_August 3rd_.--Went down to Weybridge to see Mrs. Austin. It was the last\r\ntime, for she died on the 8th, when I was at sea, on my way to Scotland. We\r\narrived at Aberdeen on the 9th, and learned it there. To Novar and Ardross,\r\nwhere good shooting. Then to Uppat, boating and fishing with the Duke of\r\nSutherland, George Loch, and Forsyth.\r\n\r\nWe went from Uppat to Brahan; then to Dunnichen and Springfield, a place\r\nnear Roslyn the Dempsters had taken. Then to Abington and home.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\nVal Richer, 15 Août.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--Sir Alexander Gordon m'avait annoncé la perte que nous\r\nvenons de faire. Je dis nous, car Madame Austin était pour moi une vraie\r\net intime amie. Je l'ai connue dans mes joies et mes tristesses, dans mes\r\nsuccès et mes revers. Je l'ai trouvée toujours la même, la même élévation\r\nd'esprit, le même coeur sympathique et dévoué. Je n'espérais plus la\r\nrevoir; je le lui disais dans la dernière lettre que je lui ai écrite, et\r\nen me répondant il y a un mois, elle me disait presque adieu. Mais la\r\ndistance est grande entre l'adieu annoncé et l'adieu réel. Sa mort est\r\npour moi un vrai chagrin. Et pour mes filles aussi, à qui elle a temoigné\r\ntant d'affection et de bonté.\r\n\r\nJ'ai prié Sir Alexander de m'envoyer la meilleure gravure en photographie\r\nqui existe d'elle. Envoyez moi aussi, je vous prie, ce qui sera publié sur\r\nson compte, et ajoutez y tous les détails que vous recueillerez.\r\n\r\nSadly and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHURCH POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in October, Reeve, with his wife--Miss Reeve--was staying in\r\nScotland--set out for Geneva, and, travelling by easy stages through\r\nAntwerp, Luxembourg, Metz--'a very pretty, attractive town,' not yet\r\nbrought into vulgar repute by its siege and surrender in the Franco-German\r\nwar--Nancy, Strasbourg, and Bale, arrived on the 12th. The weather was\r\ncold and wintry; and, after a short stay at Geneva, they went on to\r\nMarseilles, where Reeve's uncle, Philip Taylor, the founder of the 'Forges\r\net Chantiers,' was still living, a hale old man of eighty, with his wife,\r\n'some seven years younger, and not at all old in figure, look, and voice.'\r\nThen to Cannes, which was coming fast into note--'building going on with\r\ngreat activity, and ground fetching higher prices every year'; and, after\r\nan excursion to Nice and Mentone, they turned northwards, were at Paris on\r\nNovember 6th, and reached home on the 10th. The Journal adds:--\r\n\r\n_January 6th, 1868_.--Went on a visit to Loseley Park, then occupied by the\r\nThomson Hankeys--the old seat of Sir Thomas More. Mlle. Ernestine declaimed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_January 14th_.--Pray, if you can, give us a paper with some variety, and\r\nnot wholly composed of dreary Indian appeals, the hearing of which always\r\nreminded me of the toil of Pharaoh's charioteers, when they drave heavily\r\ntheir wheelless chariots in the deep sands of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nWho is it that has dug so deep into the Talmud, and written that remarkable\r\npaper, [Footnote: 'The Talmud,' _Quarterly Review,_ October 1867.] for\r\nwhich, a century ago, he would have been the subject of a writ _De\r\nhaeretico comburendo_?\r\n\r\n_Hinton St. George, January 16th_.--Your arrangement is a very good one,\r\nbut, for fear of accident, I will certainly leave this place on Monday,\r\nFebruary 3rd, so that you may count on me for Tuesday if required. The\r\ngorge rises at the thought of being fed on curry, rice, and chutnee sauce\r\nfor three weeks; I shall certainly contract a disease of the liver. If you\r\ncan send us occasionally to sea on an Admiralty case, it will be a little\r\nrelief. I have observed that petitions for prolongation of patents\r\nfrequently occupy an (apparently) undue time. If there are any such, I\r\nthink we may despatch them. I hope Lord Justice Cairns will use the days he\r\ngains for reducing the arrears in Chancery. I am much obliged to him for\r\nhis kind expressions.\r\n\r\nThe best advice that his friends can give Rolt [Footnote: Sir John Rolt\r\nresigned in February 1868, and died in June 1871.] is to resign. It is the\r\nonly chance of long life. Let him not be afraid of ennui from idleness.\r\nHe has a great love of the country and country pursuits, and that is\r\nall-sufficient. Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale its infinite\r\nvariety. And it is so much better to be a looker-on than an actor in life.\r\nAristotle, in the last chapter of his 'Nicomachean Ethics,' sets himself\r\nto consider what can be the happiness of the gods; and he finds nothing in\r\nwhich he can put it but in contemplation. And it might be so, if it were\r\nstill true. 'And God saw (contemplated) all that He had made, and behold it\r\nwas very good.'\r\n\r\nI thought it was an 'Ebrew Jew' that wrote the article entitled 'Talmud.' I\r\nhave only read a few extracts. It is quite in keeping with the times that\r\nit should be in a Tory journal. The Conservatives have begun by being\r\navowed reformers, and next they will be declared free-thinkers. This is the\r\nfirst step to their confession. Their great schoolmaster, Dizzy, gets his\r\ncompatriot to publish this article. I am glad to hear from you that it is\r\nshallow; but novelty and originality now are nothing but the reproduction\r\nof forgotten things; and, to speak seriously, I thought it seemed a thing\r\nlikely to lead many to some form or other of Arian opinions.\r\n\r\nThe following refers to a work recently published by Longmans. Mr. Longman\r\nhad apparently suggested it as a fit subject for an article in the 'Review\r\n':--\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_C. O., January 31st_.--I have read Rudd's translation of Aristophanes with\r\na good deal of interest. It is as good as it can possibly be without the\r\nslightest gleam of fun or genius. Frere's translations are blazing with\r\nboth, and that constitutes their charm. Rudd is evidently a worthy, dull\r\nman, who administers the Aristophanic champagne as if it were mere brown\r\nstout. It is for this reason that I have felt a difficulty about reviewing\r\nhim, and the more so as I am overladen with all kinds of articles. But if a\r\nfavourable opportunity occurs, I will not forget it.\r\n\r\nI am deeply grieved at the loss of poor Head. [Footnote: Sir Edmund Head\r\ndied suddenly on January 28th.] He was one of the best and pleasantest\r\ncompanions I have ever known, and latterly we have lived very much indeed\r\ntogether. It is frightful to think how very many are already gone of those\r\nwho made life agreeable; and gone, most of them, suddenly and prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_February 11th_--I was elected to be treasurer of The Club in place of\r\nSir Edmund Head [deceased]. I proposed Lord Cranborne, afterwards Lord\r\nSalisbury, at The Club.\r\n\r\nFor many years from this time The Club was such an important factor in\r\nReeve's social life, and enters so largely into both his Journal and his\r\ncorrespondence, that a list of its members, as it stood in 1867, has a\r\nstrong personal interest.\r\n\r\n_The Club_\r\n\r\n  March, 1867                        Date of Election\r\n\r\n  1 Lord Brougham                    March 9th, 1830.\r\n\r\n  2 Earl Stanhope                    May 14th, 1833.\r\n\r\n  3 The Dean of St. Paul's           February 23rd, 1836.\r\n\r\n  4 Sir Henry Holland                February 18th, 1840.\r\n\r\n  5 Mr. Charles Austin               March 7th, 1843.\r\n\r\n  6 Lord Kingsdown                   February 25th, 1845.\r\n\r\n  7 Earl of Clarendon                May 20th, 1845.\r\n\r\n  8 Professor Owen                   May 20th, 1845.\r\n\r\n  9 Monsieur Van de Weyer            February 9th, 1847.\r\n\r\n  10 Sir David Dundas                February 23rd, 1847.\r\n\r\n  11 The Duke of Cleveland           June 5th, 1849.\r\n\r\n  12 The Bishop of Oxford            June 5th, 1849.\r\n\r\n  13 Lord Overstone                  June 25th, 1850.\r\n\r\n  14 The Duke of Argyll              June 17th, 1851.\r\n\r\n  15 Lord Cranworth                  June 17th, 1851.\r\n\r\n  16 Sir Wm.

Emily [Footnote: Lord Clarendon's\r\nyoungest daughter. The marriage took place on May 5th.] is to marry Odo\r\nRussell. [Footnote: Afterwards Lord Ampthill.] It has been an attachment of\r\nsome standing on his part, and as she has become very certain of its depth\r\nand sincerity, they came to an understanding two days ago. His worldly\r\ngoods are not superabundant, but he is very rich in all the qualities\r\nlikely to make a woman happy; he is very clever and accomplished, and I\r\nspeak with a knowledge of him for many years when I say that he is one of\r\nthe best-tempered and kindest-hearted men I ever was acquainted with. Such\r\na son as he has always been must make a good husband. In short, we are all\r\nvery happy....\r\n\r\nHow I should like to have a talk with you upon home and foreign affairs,\r\nand how I should like to think that you viewed them less gloomily than I\r\ndo! There is great expectation at Rome that Italy will break up, and that\r\nthe Holy Father will recover his provinces. Italy, mishandled as she has\r\nbeen by quacks, is doubtless very sick; but she is still proud of the\r\nunion, and will fight for it against all comers. Things look black, and\r\nare, to my mind, getting blacker, every day in France. That _paries\r\nproximus_ concerns us, in our present uneasy condition, more than one likes\r\nto think of.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Chelmsford_\r\n\r\n_7 Eaton Square, February 10th, 11 P.M._--Your letter, just received, has\r\ncaused me the greatest perplexity. To provide you help on the sudden is\r\nimpossible; and, agreeing with you that it is desirable to supply Lord\r\nKingsdown's place with a strong man, I ask, Where is the judicial Samson\r\nto be found? I think it highly improbable that Mellish would abandon his\r\nprofessional profits for the barren honour of a right honourable title and\r\na seat at the board. Besides, there is no knowing what the Commission,\r\nwhich is inquiring into all the superior Courts, both original and\r\nappellate, may recommend; and I hear of very sweeping suggestions being\r\nmade. I therefore feel that, at present, I am fettered in my attempts to\r\nadd strength to the Judicial Committee. In your difficulties, I hardly know\r\nwhat to advise; but could you not take the Admiralty cases and postpone the\r\nothers, getting Phillimore to join you till Kindersley can return? This is\r\nthe only possible escape from the necessity of closing your sittings that\r\noccurs to me at the present moment.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_February 12th_--The Duc d'Aumale dined with us, to meet Lady Minto, G.\r\nLefevre, and E. Cheney. A spy got hold of this little dinner, and it\r\nwas reported to the French Government as a conspiracy. Mon [the Spanish\r\nAmbassador in Paris] told Raymond of it afterwards.\r\n\r\n_14th_--I dined with the Joinvilles; and on the 16th with the Duc de\r\nNemours at Bushey. Xavier Raymond was staying with us.\r\n\r\n_February 23rd_--I walked back from the Temple Church with Lord Chancellor\r\nChelmsford. Two days afterwards he was turned out of office by Disraeli.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Robert Lytton_ [Footnote: At this time secretary of legation at\r\nLisbon, and known in the world of letters as 'Owen Meredith.' Afterwards\r\nEarl Lytton.]\r\n\r\nLisbon, February 22nd.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I am ashamed of having left so long unanswered your\r\nlast very kind letter. But for the last three weeks I have had little\r\nleisure, and less health to enjoy it. Indeed, this is really my first free\r\nmoment since your letter reached me. Your excellent and welcome news of\r\nEmily's engagement [Footnote: Lady Emily Villiers. See _ante_.] to Odo\r\nRussell was confirmed by the same post in a line from Emily to Edith,\r\n[Footnote: Mrs. Lytton, the Lady Emily's first cousin.] and has given us\r\nthe greatest pleasure--me especially; for I have a great regard for Odo,\r\nand any other settlement of this particular Roman question [Footnote: Odo\r\nRussell was at this time, and had been for the last ten years, living at\r\nRome, practically--though not formally--ambassador to the Vatican.] would\r\nhave much disappointed my hopes. Emily, in her letter to my wife, spoke of\r\nremaining at Rome for another month or more (the marriage not being fixed\r\nto take place before May, at the Grove); but I see by the papers that Lord\r\nClarendon is already on his way homeward, and I am much _intrigué_ by that\r\narticle in the 'Times,' which has, I see, been re-echoed by other papers,\r\nsuggesting some modification in the present Cabinet on account of Lord\r\nDerby's health.\r\n\r\nThe present Portuguese Government does not seem to be at all favourably\r\ndisposed towards Mr. Flores, or to think more highly of him than you do.\r\nBut in this country one can never be quite sure what the pressure of\r\npolitical opposition or support may wring from a weak Government in the way\r\nof concession to any _intriguant;_ and, if Flores can command votes, he may\r\nbe listened to; otherwise not, I fancy.\r\n\r\nThe monthly F. O. bag has just brought me the January 'Edinburgh,' for\r\nwhich a thousand thanks. I have not yet had time to cut the leaves of it.\r\nPray accept my best thanks for the cheque mentioned in your letter. I am\r\nall the more grateful to you for the good will on behalf of 'Chronicles and\r\nCharacters,' to which you so kindly and generously give renewed expression,\r\nbecause I have just seen what I cannot but think a very unjust notice of\r\nthe book in the 'Athenaeum.' In endeavouring to illustrate a continuous\r\nstrain of thought passing over a wide range of subject, one of my chief\r\naims was diversity of form and variety of style; but there can be no doubt\r\nthat versatility is always in danger of running into imitation. Play always\r\non the Jew's harp, and no one will accuse you of imitating the tone of any\r\nother instrument. I do not pretend that my own instrument is an organ: but\r\nI would rather it should be the smallest harmonicum than the strongest and\r\nshrillest Jew's harp.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. S. H. Walpole_\r\n\r\nEaling, March 29th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I am quite ashamed of myself for not having thanked you\r\nbefore for your valuable hints about the effect and ultimate consequences\r\nof Gladstone's motion. [Footnote: March 30th, for the Disestablishment of\r\nthe Irish Church, of which notice was given on March 23rd.] I have long\r\nthought that his aim and object has been for years to separate the Church\r\nfrom the State, and so set up an episcopal and sacerdotal power, which\r\nwould endeavour to exercise an unbounded control over the consciences,\r\nactions, and private judgement of men. The only check upon this is the\r\nsupremacy of the civil power in the external government of the Church, and\r\nthe obligation of the clergy to submit and subscribe to the doctrine\r\nand liturgy which, once for all, the Church and State have concurred in\r\nprescribing. All ritualism, all tractarianism, and much high-churchism is\r\nin secret, if not in avowed, rebellion against such a supremacy; and if it\r\n[Footnote: _Sc_. the supremacy of the civil power.] could only be struck\r\ndown in Ireland, it would not be long before an attack on it was made in\r\nEngland. What may happen to-morrow I cannot regard with much satisfaction.\r\nGladstone's motion is the most impudent assault on the Crown which any\r\nex-minister ever made; and Stanley's amendment is an illogical surrender\r\nof our best defence. He ought to have ended in plain words, by saying that\r\n'the House is of opinion that the disestablishment and disendowment of the\r\nChurch in Ireland would be contrary to, and in direct violation of, the\r\nfundamental and essential articles of the Treaty of Union.' The country\r\nwould have then understood what we were about; it can hardly understand it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI am out of heart and have many misgivings when ex-ministers of the Crown,\r\nand the actual minister of the Crown, assail or abandon the Crown's\r\nprerogative for the value of place and power.\r\n\r\nYours always very sincerely,\r\n\r\nS. H. WALPOLE.\r\n\r\nWalpole's interpretation of Gladstone's 'aim and object' may now appear\r\nstrained. It was, however, certainly held, at the time, by many who argued\r\nthat Gladstone's character was itself a direct contradiction to the charge\r\nof his proposed measure being one of spoliation and robbery. [Footnote: See\r\n_post_.] It is, perhaps, more probable that he was greatly influenced by\r\nthe Utopian sentimentalism which so powerfully influenced his later career,\r\nand led him to the extreme courses so bitterly condemned by many of his old\r\ncolleagues and adherents. At the same time it must be remembered that when,\r\nnearly thirty years later, a Radical measure was brought forward for the\r\ndisestablishment of the Church in Wales, with the avowed intention of\r\nadvancing by it to the disestablishment of the Church of England, although\r\nthe great body of the Church, clergy and laity, vehemently denounced it as\r\nantagonistic to the best interests of the Church and the country, there\r\nwere many of the extreme ritualistic section who openly favoured and\r\nsupported it, with freedom on their tongues and sacerdotalism in their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here has:--\r\n\r\nWent to St. Leonard's with the Watneys for Good Friday (April 10th). On\r\nEaster Sunday to Holland, with Circourt. Dined with Baudin, [Footnote:\r\nThe son of Charles Baudin, the distinguished admiral. Cf. _Les Gloires\r\nMaritimes de France_, par Jurien de la Gravière.] the French minister at\r\nthe Hague.\r\n\r\n_April 13th_.--Spent the evening with the Queen of Holland at the Old\r\nPalace. 14th, evening with the Queen. 16th, went on, by Utrecht, to Aix,\r\nwhere Circourt and I remained ten days. Came home by Antwerp.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Robert Lytton_\r\n\r\nMadrid, April 29th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I must apologise for not having sooner thanked you for\r\nyour very kind letter of the 8th, which reached me just as I was starting\r\n(paperless and penless) for Madrid. The cares of this world (in the shape\r\nof house-hunting), quite unaccompanied by the deceitfulness of riches,\r\nhave, I am sorry to say, eaten up every hour of my time not otherwise\r\nabsorbed by official visits and presentations, &c., since we reached--a\r\nweek ago--this pretty, busy, but horribly hot and dear, town.\r\n\r\nI am really pained to think that your kind intention on behalf of my book\r\nshould already have been the occasion of so much trouble to you, dear Mr.\r\nReeve; and I can only say that I am all the more grateful to you for not\r\nhaving altogether abandoned it. A notice in the 'Edinburgh' will at all\r\ntimes be most valuable; and the more touches there may be in it from your\r\npen, the more valuable it will be. The notice in the 'Times' was indeed\r\nvery kindly written, and very kindly inserted, and I doubt not that it will\r\nbe very advantageous to the book in many ways.\r\n\r\nI am greatly and agreeably struck by the animation and showiness of\r\nMadrid--after Lisbon, which is one of the dullest towns I ever saw. Life\r\nat Lisbon is _en robe de chambre_; here it is all _en toilette_. Madrid is\r\nlike a pretty provincial who has been to Paris, and come back _mise à la\r\nmode_, and with a decided taste for spending more money than she has at\r\nher bankers'. The beauty of the women's faces, too, as you see them in the\r\nstreets, the Prado, and at the opera (for I have not yet seen the _beau\r\nmonde_ at home), is very agreeable. Pretty faces seem to be as plentiful\r\nhere as gold nuggets in the streets of Eldorado, when Candide saw them.\r\n\r\nThe day after we got to Madrid, Narvaes died, and till yesterday he has\r\nbeen lying in state and receiving the visits of a grateful public at all\r\nhours of the day. Yesterday his body, _empaillé_, was removed with due\r\nhonours to be buried in Andalusia. The story goes about the town that on\r\nhis deathbed his confessor, having told him to forgive his enemies, he\r\nreplied: 'I have none.' 'Impossible! A man who has been governing Spain so\r\nlong must have many.' 'But I assure you there is no man alive whom I even\r\nsuspect to be my enemy.' 'No enemies?' 'None; I have shot them all!'\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you will be able to visit Spain in the autumn. About\r\nthat time, if still here, I shall try to see Seville and the South. But my\r\nplans are entirely dependent on Crampton's [Footnote: Sir John Crampton,\r\nminister plenipotentiary at Madrid, retired from the public service on\r\nJuly 1st, 1869.] movements; and I fear we shall have to pass the summer at\r\nMadrid, which I rather dread on account of the children, who have already\r\ncaught feverish colds. With my wife's affectionate greetings, and my own\r\nrespects, to Mrs. Reeve, pray believe me to be yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nR. LYTTON.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_May 6th_.--Disraeli was in the chair at the Literary Fund dinner. [He\r\nspoke--wrote Mrs. Reeve--with grace, and had a brilliant reception. I never\r\nheard such cheering at any previous dinner. He has stormy nights in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and how it will end is still uncertain; but his\r\nwonderful tact and control of feature, voice, and language give him marked\r\nadvantage.]\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nYork House, Twickenham, le 20 mai.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je ne puis résister au désir d'appeler votre\r\nbienveillante attention sur le dernier numéro de la 'Revue des deux\r\nMondes,' que je ne vous envoie pas, sachant que vous la recevez, où notre\r\nexcellent ami X. Raymond a traité la question de l'église d'Irlande.\r\n\r\nJe veux en même temps réclamer votre indulgence pour son travail, et vous\r\ndemander de ne pas vous étonner si vous n'y retrouvez ni la clarté de\r\nstyle ni la variété de connaissances qui distinguent votre ami. Ne le lui\r\nreprochez pas trop sévèrement, car, s'il est coupable, ce n'est pas de\r\ncela.\r\n\r\nÉlevé dans le respect de la loi, je ne puis vous en dire davantage, et je\r\nme bornerai à vous rappeler qu'il y a actuellement dans la loi française\r\ndeux articles, l'un interdisant aux exilés d'écrire dans les journaux,\r\nqui ne me permet pas de me présenter comme collaborateur de la 'Revue;'\r\nl'autre, punissant les journaux qui publient des articles sous des\r\nsignatures autres que celle de l'auteur, qui ne me permet pas de vous en\r\ndire davantage.\r\n\r\nJe termine en vous priant de me croire toujours\r\n\r\nVotre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_From the Dean of St. Paul's_\r\n\r\nDeanery, St. Paul's, June 19th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Reeve,--Your article [Footnote: 'The National Church,' which\r\nappeared in the _Edinburgh Review_ of July.] I think admirable. I have\r\nventured to make one or two verbal suggestions, but on the main of your\r\nargument I am fully with you. There are only two points which I should\r\npropose for your reconsideration. I do not quite see the bearing of your\r\nargument about the Cardross case, and do not quite understand the decision\r\nof the Scotch judges. [Footnote: The Free Church minister of Cardross had\r\nbeen deposed by the Church Courts for drunkenness. He applied to the civil\r\ncourt for redress, and was thereupon summarily ejected from the Free\r\nChurch. The Court of Session decided that the defenders--the Church\r\nCourts--'are invested with no jurisdiction whatever, ecclesiastical or\r\ncivil.'] Surely every corporation, or, indeed, every club, has, and must\r\nhave, the power of excluding--excommunicating is only the theologian's term\r\nfor the same thing--any member who flagrantly violates its rules and first\r\nprinciples. If a member of the Athenaeum were to get roaring drunk and\r\ndisturb the place, and endanger the character of the club, the committee or\r\na general meeting might eject him, though he would have some plea in his\r\nvested right in the property of the club--the house, library, &c. If the\r\nmistake in the Cardross case was that the culprit was ejected without\r\ntrial, that, I think, should be distinctly stated. If the flaw is that it\r\nwas done by the Church officers, without the general consent or sanction of\r\nthe Kirk, this also should be made clear. I rather demur to the division\r\nof the ecclesiastical property now held by the Irish Church, according\r\nstrictly to the proportion of its members to the rest of the population.\r\nPossession, and possession for three centuries, ought, I think, to be taken\r\ninto account. But this is a question rather of detail than of principle.\r\nBut the real difficulty you have stated fairly and clearly: On what terms,\r\nand under what character, is the Protestant Church, when disestablished,\r\nto hold the property--the churches, parsonages, &c.--which is to remain to\r\nher? The Church must have a constitution--I do not see why not ratified by\r\nAct of Parliament--by which the trustees which represent her will legally\r\nhold that property. She must not be exposed in a few years to a Lady\r\nHewley's charity case. [Footnote: Sarah, Lady Hewley, at her death, in\r\n1710, left landed property in trust for the support of 'poor and godly\r\npreachers of Christ's holy Gospel.' The original trustees were all\r\nPresbyterians; but in the course of a hundred years the trust had got into\r\nthe hands of Unitarians, and the case was brought to the notice of the\r\nCharity Commissioners. After a prolonged litigation, it was finally decided\r\nby the House of Lords (August 5th, 1842) that, by the terms of the bequest,\r\nUnitarians were excluded from participating in the charity.] I suggested\r\nto the Archbishop of Armagh--a good-natured, but not a very powerful,\r\nman--that the Irish Church, when in one sense free, should yet retain, of\r\nits own will, the advantages of the supremacy of the Crown and of the law.\r\nShe should take, as the fundamental tenet of her constitution, conformity\r\nto the Articles and Formularies of the Church of England, which the\r\nmajority of the English hold, in their meaning and interpretation. On\r\nthis principle she might retain a jurisdiction, amenable to law, over her\r\nmembers; her members be protected against episcopal tyranny, against that\r\nwhich is now the great danger, parsonocracy, which I rejoice to find that\r\nyou repudiate as strongly as I or Stanley. Ever very truly yours,\r\n\r\nH. H. MILMAN.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Cairns_\r\n\r\n_July 23rd_.--Many thanks for the copy of your article on the National\r\nChurch. I had begun to read it with great interest in the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' not knowing that it was directly from your pen, and I shall now\r\ncontinue the perusal with increased pleasure.... I will enclose with this,\r\nin exchange for your paper, a copy of my speech on the Irish Church--a\r\nDiomedean exchange; the value of ten oxen for a hundred.\r\n\r\nDuring all this spring Reeve had suffered a great deal from gout, so, by\r\nthe advice of Sir Henry Holland, who spoke strongly of the necessity of\r\nchange of air and of rest from all work and effort, he and his wife started\r\nfor the Continent on July 24th. Passing through Paris, and staying a few\r\ndays at Fontainebleau, they went on to Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne, and\r\nto Royat, then newly come into vogue as a health resort. After about three\r\nweeks of the baths and the mountain air, Reeve was so far recovered as to\r\nbe able to walk a little; and on August 18th they passed on to Geneva,\r\nwhere they were joined by their friends the Watneys, with whom they went\r\non to Evian, and thence by the Valais to the Bel Alp, an hotel 7,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, commanding magnificent views. 'Christine,' wrote Reeve\r\nin his Journal, 'went up the Sparrenhorn with Binet,' whilst, according\r\nto Mrs. Reeve, 'Henry and Mrs. Watney, not being moveable bodies, sat at\r\nwindows and pooh-poohed the energetic use of legs.' From the Bel Alp,\r\nReeve, still very much of a cripple, 'was carried'--the expression is his\r\nown--to Brieg. Thence, by the Furca, to Hospenthal and to Zurich, the falls\r\nof the Rhine, Bâle, and Paris, where they stayed a few days, and returned\r\nto London on September 10th.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\n_York House, July 26th_.--I had already seen the remarkable article which\r\nyou have just published in the 'Edinburgh Review,' when I received the copy\r\nyou so kindly thought of sending me, and which I shall keep as a souvenir\r\nof the author. I hasten to thank you, and to tell you with what interest\r\nI have read this study, so full of curious facts and remarkable\r\nappreciations. If I was called on to decide the question in its entirety,\r\nI should decline, in the first place as a Catholic. Indeed I cannot place\r\nmyself at the Protestant point of view so as to judge what services the\r\nunion of Church and State has rendered to the religious principles which\r\nare the basis of the Protestant faith. And the lay system of the official\r\nChurch of England is so foreign to our ideas of religious authority that it\r\nis difficult for us to be impartial towards it. Those who do not belong to\r\nthe Anglican Church are naturally tempted to attribute to this subjection\r\neverything in her which, in their eyes, is error or change. I should also\r\ndecline as a Frenchman, for I confess that what troubles me most at the\r\npresent time is the relation between the Catholic Church and the State,\r\na relation which has been equally prejudicial to both, when founded on a\r\npolitical union.\r\n\r\nBut without trying to judge such a delicate question, which will be a\r\nsubject of controversy as long as the world is given up to the disputes of\r\nman, I have found a real pleasure in seeing this clear explanation of the\r\nprinciples which form the basis of a system whose adherents are so many and\r\nso distinguished....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\n_The Grove, August 2nd._--Lord Russell does not much like some parts of the\r\narticle on the Irish Church, and wishes to write five or six pages on the\r\nsubject for the November [Footnote: _Sic_ for October.] number; but\r\nnot feeling sure whether you would accept them, he has asked me to\r\ninquire--which I hereby do. If you have not set out for Russia, [Footnote:\r\n_Sc._ or other out-of-the-way place. It has been seen that, at the time,\r\nReeve was at Royal.] perhaps you will write him a line yourself, as I start\r\nfor Wiesbaden on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nAs no note from Lord Russell appeared in the October number, it would seem\r\nprobable that Reeve did not encourage the idea. His own relations to Lord\r\nRussell were not such as to prompt him to any undue complacence, and he was\r\nat all times extremely averse from anything like a controversy either in\r\nor about the 'Review.' It has happened to the present writer to have\r\nstatements or opinions put forward in his contributions to the 'Review'\r\ncalled in question in the daily or weekly papers, and to have been\r\npointedly requested by the editor to take no notice of the hostile letters\r\nor criticisms. As the articles were strictly anonymous, the responsibility,\r\nof course, rested with the editor, who, probably for that very reason, was\r\nstrongly opposed to an early revelation of a writer's personality.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes visits to Farnborough and Denbigh, and some shooting at\r\nTorry Hill; but the gout was still troublesome, and in October Reeve and\r\nhis wife went into Cornwall, where, after a week's visit to Lady Molesworth\r\nat Pencarrow, they went to Penzance, to the Land's End and the Logan\r\nStone--on to which Mrs. Reeve clambered--and thence to Falmouth and\r\nTorquay, where they met the Queen of Holland and Prince Napoleon, with whom\r\nthey spent two evenings. 'Her Majesty,' wrote Mrs. Reeve on November\r\n4th, 'is a clever, original woman, speaking four tongues perfectly well,\r\nconversant with literature and politics, and finding in them consolation\r\nfor an uncongenial family.' The sittings of the Judicial Committee, which\r\nbegan on November 10th, called Reeve back to town, where, on the 27th, he\r\nhad the sad news of the death of his old friend Colonel Ferguson of Raith,\r\nand, for the last three years, of Novar.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Clarendon_\r\n\r\nGrosvenor Crescent, November 13th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--The Queen of Holland has proposed to dine here in the\r\nunfurnished cupboard where we have our frugal repasts, on Monday next at\r\neight. We have no servants, plate, or usual appurtenances, and only six can\r\nbe crammed into the locale. Will you be one of them? and will Mrs. Reeve\r\nexcuse us for asking you alone on account of our no room? Please let me\r\nhave an answer as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nEver yours truly,\r\n\r\nCLARENDON.\r\n\r\n_Endorsed_--The dinner consisted of the Queen, Cockburn, Seymour, and self.\r\n\r\nFrom the Bishop of Lincoln [Footnote: Christopher Wordsworth. Cf. _ante,_\r\nvol. i. pp. 31, 68. VOL. II.]\r\n\r\nNovember 21st.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--It is very good of you to write as you do concerning my\r\npromotion. I should indeed have been well content to remain in the peaceful\r\nharbour of Westminster for the remainder of my days, instead of putting out\r\nto sea in a rather weather-beaten bark in stormy weather. But such kind\r\nwords as yours encourage me to hope that, if I am wrecked in the storm, I\r\nmay be picked up by some friendly vessel and brought to land again. I have,\r\nmy dear friend, your congratulations, and let me have also your prayers. I\r\nam, my dear Reeve,\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHR. WORDSWORTH. [Footnote: He had not yet adopted the episcopal\r\nsignature.]\r\n\r\nI send you three pamphlets. Do not think me troublesome, but you ought\r\nreally to take up (pardon me for saying so) the question of the approaching\r\ngreat Roman Council, which will probably affirm the personal infallibility\r\nof the Pope, and be fraught with the most important results to Europe,\r\npolitical as well as ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Cairns_\r\n\r\nWindsor Castle, November 29th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I send you in a separate cover my notes of a judgement in\r\nRugg _v._ Bishop of W. for printing and circulation; and I enclose in this\r\na letter which I have had from Lord Westbury, which is in accordance with\r\nthe judgement as it stands, but which it would perhaps be best to put in\r\nprint and circulate along with the judgement. I hope in a week or ten days\r\nto have Mackonochie ready--that is, if I am not smothered in the meantime\r\nby the books and pamphlets which the Ritualists daily shower upon me.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CAIRNS.\r\n\r\nAs the general election had left his party in a minority of about 130,\r\nDisraeli resigned on December 4th, and Mr. Gladstone, who had put the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church prominently before the electors,\r\nformed a ministry which was from the beginning pledged to the measure. It\r\nwas known that this would meet with no support from Lord Westbury, so that\r\nhe was necessarily 'left out in the cold,' not without some misgivings as\r\nto what a man so cunning in fence might say or write when his opinions were\r\nsharpened by a sense of personal injury. To Lord Westbury, however,\r\nthe slight was lost in his wrath at the barefaced avowal of a plan of\r\nspoliation; and, without taking the trouble to date his letter, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n[_December_].--These written judgements are a great bore. I imagine\r\n(no doubt from vanity) that, at the end of the argument, I could have\r\npronounced _viva voce_ a much more effective and convincing judgement than\r\nthat which I have written. The _vis animi_ evaporates during the slow\r\nprocess of writing; the conception fades and the expression becomes feeble.\r\nWhat we shall do with the other case of Mackonochie I dread to think. I\r\nwish we had knocked it off while the iron was hot, as we used to do\r\nthe running down cases. There is no chance of a decision this side of\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nI have come up to town on some private matters, and have not the least\r\nnotion of mingling in any political matters. In fact, I gave my people to\r\nunderstand so clearly last session that I would reject with abhorrence\r\nany measure that embodied these two wicked things--l. Stripping the Irish\r\nChurch of its property to convert it to secular uses, which is robbery; 2.\r\nDestroying episcopacy in, and the Queen's supremacy over, the Established\r\nChurch in Ireland, which is a wanton, unnecessary, and most mischievous\r\nact--that of course I could not expect any communication from them.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the Government in its legal staff in the House of Commons\r\nwill be very great, but the opposition will be weaker. It cannot be\r\nexpected that Palmer [Footnote: Sir Roundell Palmer, afterwards Earl of\r\nSelborne, had been successively Solicitor--and Attorney-General during the\r\nwhole of the Liberal Administration 1859-66; but on the formation of Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government declined the Great Seal with a peerage, on account\r\nof his disapproval of the proposed disestablishment and disendowment of the\r\nIrish Church. Notwithstanding Lord Westbury's forecast, he did speak very\r\nstrongly against the Bill on the second reading (March 22nd, 1869), voted\r\nwith the minority against it, and took an active part against it in the\r\nCommittee.] will take a very active part in opposition. Then what lawyer\r\nhave they? But in the House of Lords I hope the principles of English law\r\nand of political expediency will be abundantly illustrated and explained,\r\nand shown to be in direct opposition to the Government's destructive and\r\nrevolutionary measure; and if this be done, as the people of England are a\r\nlaw-loving and law-abiding people, there may be a great reaction in public\r\nfeeling. And what will Wood be able to do against those opposed to him?\r\n\r\nWhat a Cabinet! 'Misery,' says Trinculo, 'makes one acquainted with strange\r\nbedfellows'--so, it seems, does unlooked-for prosperity. Only fancy\r\nGranville, Clarendon, and the rest, pigging heads and tails with John\r\nBright in the same truckle bed! I am very thankful that I have an\r\nopportunity of conversing in quiet with philosophers and poets at Hinton.\r\n\r\nThe following, written in a feminine hand on a half-sheet of note-paper,\r\nbelongs to this time. It is endorsed by Reeve--'Lord Derby's acrostic on\r\nGladstone;' but it does not appear whether the attributing it to Lord Derby\r\nwas on positive knowledge or on mere current gossip. The name of the author\r\nwas certainly not generally known.\r\n\r\n  G was a Genius and mountain of mind;\r\n  L a Logician expert and refined;\r\n  A an Adept at rhetorical art;\r\n  D was the Dark spot that lurked in his heart;\r\n  S was the Subtlety that led him astray;\r\n  T was the Truth that he bartered away;\r\n  O was the Cypher his conscience became;\r\n  N was the New-light that lit up the same;\r\n  E was the Evil-One shouting for joy,--\r\n  'Down with it! down with it! Gladstone, my boy!\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Another, slightly different, edition of this acrostic, with the\r\nanswer to it from the Radical point of view, is given in Sir M. E. Grant\r\nDuff's _Notes from a Diary,_ 1873-81, vol. i. p. 126.]\r\n\r\n_From Lord Cairns_\r\n\r\n_December 7th_--Putting aside the well-regulated party feeling which we\r\nought all to endeavour to cultivate, the sensation of a period of repose\r\nafter twenty-five years of hardish work is, to me, so novel and agreeable\r\nthat I fear I do not look on my exit from office [Footnote: On the fall of\r\nDisraeli's ministry.] with the solicitude that I ought. But I do not the\r\nless appreciate the kind sentiments in your note, and I can safely say that\r\nupon the Judicial Committee, whether as Chancellor or as Lord Justice,\r\nit has been a very great pleasure to me to co-operate with anyone whose\r\nanxiety and efforts for the efficiency of the tribunal, and whose ability\r\nto contribute to that end, are as great as yours.\r\n\r\nI am most desirous that the two ecclesiastical judgements should be given\r\nbefore Christmas, as I may be absent for some weeks after that day. I hope\r\nto send you my draft in Mackonochie on Wednesday, and I will beg you to\r\nprint and circulate it as soon as possible. I wish I could have done it\r\nsooner; but it is _magnum opus et difficile_, and I have had judgements in\r\nchancery and other work on hand, and in this I felt obliged to trust to no\r\namanuensis.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is from the widow of Sir James Smith, the botanist\r\n(_d_. 1828), and at this time in her ninety-sixth year. By her maiden name\r\nshe was Pleasance Reeve, an old family friend, but not a relation of\r\nher namesake. Her letters are not less remarkable for the clearness and\r\nstrength of the writing, than they are for the vigour of the thought and\r\nthe lucidity of the expression. Five years later, just as she had completed\r\nher one hundredth year, Reeve and his daughter paid her a visit at\r\nLowestoft, which is recorded on a later page. [Footnote: See _post_, p.\r\n215.]\r\n\r\n_Lowestoft, December 16th_--Surely, dear Mr. Reeve, this is not the first\r\ntime you have inquired of me concerning Lowestoft china? Either you, or Dr.\r\nHooker it might be; whichever it was, I sent him all that I knew about it,\r\nand that all is very little, for I am one of the sceptics, and have been\r\nfilled with doubt and surprise at the reports I have heard. But I am told\r\nI am quite mistaken, and that it surely had arrived at a great state of\r\nperfection; that foreign artists had been employed; and that, if what is\r\nshown is not Lowestoft china, what other is it? For there is a peculiarity\r\nin it which those acquainted with [it] know at first sight, and which\r\nis totally different from Chelsea, or Derby, or Worcestershire, or\r\nStaffordshire. This I admit. One peculiarity Mr. S. Martin observed. The\r\nbottoms of the saucers have very slight undulations, looking, as he said,\r\nlike a ribbon that requires ironing to be perfectly flat and smooth. This,\r\nwhen he showed me, I also noticed; and, I must add, I have seen the same in\r\nreal Chinese china; but he told me he could distinguish better, and that it\r\nwas not the same. Also, there is a uniformity in certain little flowers\r\nand roses which is seen in no others. The shapes are good, and as the\r\nmanufacture advanced the painting was improved; armorial bearings were\r\nrepresented, and gilding.\r\n\r\nS. Martin, who could send you a much more perfect account than I can,\r\nalways calls on an old woman--the widow of Rose, a painter--who recollects\r\ntheir melting guineas for gold to gild with. She, perhaps, is dead now, for\r\nwhen he last called she was bedrid, and nearly insensible. I recommend you\r\nto ask of Mr. S. Martin, Liverpool, who, I am sure, would give you much\r\ninformation I cannot.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know I will tell as well as I can--That in my early youth there\r\nwas a manufactory; that I often went and _saw_ Mr. Allen dab a piece of\r\nwhite clay on a wheel, and, with his foot turning the wheel, with his\r\nright hand he formed a handsome basin or cup in a minute or two. The china\r\nbasins, cups, saucers, pots, jugs--everything was made here, painted here,\r\nby poor sickly looking boys and girls, for it was a very unwholesome\r\ntrade--baked here; and they had a shop in London, which, I suppose,\r\ntook off the bulk of their manufactured articles. I remember the great\r\nwater-wheel which ground the clay--a fearful monster, sublime, I must say,\r\nfor it 'hid its limits in its greatness;' but the beautiful lake that\r\nsupplied it with water, and was covered with water-lilies, was one of my\r\nfavourite resorts.\r\n\r\nGillingwater [Footnote: _Historical Account of the Ancient Town of\r\nLowestoft_ (1790).] tells us that Mr. Hewling Luson found the clay on his\r\nestate in 1756, made experiments, was defeated; other persons took it up,\r\nand were also hindered through jealousy; another trial proved unsuccessful,\r\nbut repeated efforts succeeded, and the manufacture began, and went on till\r\nabout the end of the century, or early in 1800, when my brother bought a\r\nfew articles at the final sale by way of remembrance, but these, though\r\npretty, are by no means the choicest specimens. A man in the town has a\r\nwhole dinner service, with, I think, ducal bearings; and only last summer\r\nMr. Bohn [Footnote: Henry George Bohn, the well-known publisher, and almost\r\nequally well-known collector of articles of vertu.] gave 5 £ to an old\r\nman for one little cup, which the poor fellow intended as a legacy to his\r\ndaughter, and he unwillingly sold it; but 5 £ bribed him--or it might be\r\nmore; the original price was probably 4_d_. or 6_d_. at most.\r\n\r\nPray, dear Mr. Reeve, take no trouble to correct the name in Mrs.\r\nPalliser's book of pottery. I never was a patroness of the Lowestoft china,\r\nknow but little about it, and do not wish my name to appear as being in\r\nany other way connected with it than as being an inhabitant of the same\r\ntown.--I am, dear Mr. Reeve, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nP. SMITH.\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal winds up the year with--\r\n\r\n_December 31st_--To Hinton St. George, on a visit to Lord Westbury.\r\n\r\n1869. The year opened at Hinton, shooting with Lord Westbury. Montague\r\nSmith was there. Nothing ever amused me more than Lord Westbury's society,\r\nand I became intimate with him. He was a strange mixture of intellectual\r\npower and moral weakness, and his peculiar mode of speaking was at once\r\nprecise, pertinent, and comical. He had hired Hinton from Lord Paulet, and\r\nlived there with a host of children and grandchildren. On Sundays all dined\r\ntogether--I think, thirty-two of them.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Woodnorton_, 16 _janvier_.--... Nous aurons une passable chasse à tir le\r\njour sacramental du lr février. Voulez-vous en être? L'ennui est que\r\nc'est un lundi, et que le train du dimanche est d'une lenteur fabuleuse.\r\nVoulez-vous venir dîner et coucher ici samedi 30, ou dimanche 31?\r\n\r\nH. D'O.\r\n\r\nFrom a later note of the Duke's, it appears that Reeve was unable to accept\r\nthe invitation to the _passable chasse,_ which he would have enjoyed,\r\nespecially as after four years there was no longer a question of the 'loose\r\nbox' or the 'kitchen dresser.'\r\n\r\nThe next letter, from Lord Westbury, is in evident answer to one from\r\nReeve about Lord Campbell's 'Lives of Lyndhurst and Brougham,' then newly\r\npublished, of which a very severe--not, it was thought, too severe--article\r\nappeared in the 'Review' for April. The article was not by Reeve; but we\r\nmay fairly suppose that he--to some extent, at least--inspired it; and\r\nthat--also to some extent--the inspiration was supplied by Lord Westbury.\r\n\r\n_Hinton St. George, January 24th_--I wish you were here for two or three\r\ndays' shooting before the season closes, as the weather is so mild and\r\nbeautiful, and I hear that in London it is miserably cold. So tell Mrs.\r\nReeve that her Zomerzet is a favoured county after all.\r\n\r\nAs to what you say about the book, I remember a celebrated dinner at the\r\nTemple, to which I invited Lyndhurst, Brougham, Campbell, and Charlie\r\nWetherell, when the latter warned Lyndhurst and Brougham of Campbell's\r\ndesign, in terms almost prophetic of what has occurred. 'My biographical\r\nfriend will excel in exhibiting every little foible; _Hunc tu Romane\r\ncaveto_.' I cannot describe the whole scene to you, but will some day _vivâ\r\nvoce_.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\nWoodnorton, January 31st.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--An absence at Badminton, where I struggled for a few\r\nhours' sport, first with the frost and then with hurricanes, has prevented\r\nme from sooner answering your letter of the 26th.\r\n\r\nI have searched the archives at Monte Cassino very minutely; I do not know\r\nthose of La Cava, which have the reputation of being very curious, but\r\nmore local and of less general interest than those of Monte Cassino.\r\nThe Cassinesi had a printing press, to which we owe many beautiful\r\npublications, some unpublished sermons of St. Augustine's, several works by\r\nthe eloquent and learned Father Tosti, &c. They had prepared an edition of\r\nan unpublished Commentary on Dante, and also of the valuable correspondence\r\nof Mabillon, Montfaucon, and other clerics of the Congregation of St. Maur,\r\nwhen, in consequence of the events of 1848, their printing presses were\r\nsequestrated. At that time they were suspected of Liberalism. Now, when\r\nsecularisation has replaced sequestration, it seems to me that the Italian\r\nGovernment ought to continue the literary and archaeological work of the\r\nmonks, as it has substituted itself in their proprietary rights; just as,\r\nafter the French Revolution, the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres\r\ncarried on the immense work of the clerics of the Congrégation de St.-Maur.\r\n\r\nThis is my first impulse on reading M. de Circourt's letter. However, we\r\nwill speak of it further when I have the pleasure of seeing you again,\r\nwhich I hope will be soon. _Mille amitiés._\r\n\r\nH. D'ORLÉANS\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nIn London the usual dinners. Dined at Mr. Gladstone's on February 1st. This\r\nwas the first dinner he gave after becoming Prime Minister. There were\r\npresent Lord Lansdowne, Clarendon, Hammond, Northbrook, Helps, Kinnaird,\r\nDoyle, Hamilton, and Salomons [Footnote: Created a baronet on October 26th\r\nof the same year.]--an odd party. He received us in the hall.\r\n\r\n_April 9th_--To Paris. 10th, at the Institute; saw Guizot, Mignet,\r\nSt.-Hilaire, Wolowski, Chevalier, &c., there. 18th, Chapel at the\r\nTuileries; saw the Emperor there--I think for the last time. 20th, went to\r\nLa Celle, [Footnote: La Celle St.-Cloud, about four miles from Versailles,\r\nwhere M. de Circourt lived throughout the evening of his life.] and spent\r\nsome days there with Circourt. ['Henry,' wrote Mrs. Reeve, 'enjoyed his\r\ndays in the country with M. de Circourt vastly. We thought it unreasonable\r\nto go all three, and a maid, to his small house; so Hopie and I careered\r\nabout the streets, went to a play, and to a dance at the Chinese\r\nEmbassy!--not very Chinese, as the minister is American, so also is his\r\nwife, and the guests were mostly his country-folk.']\r\n\r\n_23rd--Dined at M. Guizot's. 25th_--Dined with Thiers, and met Mignet,\r\nSt.-Hilaire, Duvergier, and Rémusat.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Academy Exhibition took place for the first time in Burlington\r\nHouse. I dined with the R.A.s at Pender's.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, May 13th_--I took up my summer quarters here a week ago,\r\nleaving the fifth volume of my 'Mémoires' in Paris, ready printed and on\r\nthe eve of publication. You will receive it next week. It deals entirely\r\nwith my embassy to England in 1840. I am anxious to know what will be\r\nsaid of it in England; it will be very kind of you to supply me with the\r\ninformation. You know that I love and honour England sufficiently always\r\nto say what I think of her; and what she thinks of me concerns me closely,\r\nwhether our opinions are or are not the same.\r\n\r\nI have found many letters and conversations of yours for 1840. But it was\r\nmore especially after this, and during the first year of my ministry,\r\nthat you helped me so effectively in preserving peace and re-establishing\r\nfriendly relations between our two countries. I hope you will not object to\r\nmy saying so....\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions:--\r\n\r\n_May 22nd._--Visit to Tom Baring's, at Norman Court. [Mr. Baring--wrote\r\nMrs. Reeve--is the head of the house of Baring Brothers; an elderly\r\ngentleman and a bachelor, very simple, but very kindly. The house is not\r\nlarge for the park and property, which is, all together, about 7,000 acres;\r\nbut pictures and china are renowned; so is the cooking; and, with such\r\nwealth as is at our host's command, all the details are in perfection.\r\nIn the park there are many fine beech and other trees, and the yew grows\r\nwonderfully, contrasting its dark tint with the soft, white may. On the\r\nslope of the hill, about three miles off, grow service-trees and juniper;\r\nand, from the ridge, one sees across the New Forest to the Solent and the\r\nIsle of Wight.]\r\n\r\n_June 4th_--Went to Windsor to see Mr. Woodward and the Queen's library.\r\nThen to Farnborough for the Ascot week.\r\n\r\n_July 2nd._--Watney's water-party to Medmenham Abbey, where we were all\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\n_13th_--Lucy Duff Gordon died at Cairo. Alexander asked me to write an\r\nepitaph, which was put up there.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, July 14th_--When your letter of the 8th arrived I was on the\r\npoint of writing to ask you to tell me what is the best History of England\r\nfrom the accession of Queen Anne to that of Queen Victoria. I have the\r\n'Pictorial History of England,' Lord Stanhope's 'Eighteenth Century,' and\r\nMr. Alison's big volumes on the recent revolutionary times. These do not\r\nsatisfy me; I do not want political or moral appreciations. What I should\r\nlike would be a book in which all the events of any importance are related\r\nin chronological order. I particularly hold to knowing the correct dates.\r\nIt is only on this condition that history can be materially known and\r\nmorally understood. It will be very kind of you to give me the information\r\nI want. I amuse myself by relating to my grandchildren, at one time, the\r\nhistory of France, at another, the history of England. They take great\r\ninterest in it. I want them to know both correctly, and understand them\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_July 16th_.--Met the Duke of Leinster at Robartes' at dinner. He had made\r\na capital speech in the House of Lords a few days before, which I heard. It\r\nlasted only three minutes; but it stated these facts:--That he had given\r\nland and houses, with complete success, to priests, Presbyterians, and\r\nEpiscopalians; that all were grateful, and they lived happily together.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards told me, at this dinner, that he had not given the houses and\r\nglebes to any ecclesiastical persons, but to certain lay members of each\r\ncongregation, in trust for their respective ministers. This was exactly\r\nwhat I had suggested some little time before. The Duke said that, having\r\ncalled one day to inquire for a very old Catholic priest living in one\r\nof these houses, while he was sitting by his bedside, the Episcopalian\r\nclergyman came into the room for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 18th_.--Dinner at Lord Granville's. I had not dined with him for\r\nsome years--since his marriage. The room was rather dark when I went in.\r\nLord Granville said something, as I understood, about a foreign countess to\r\nwhom he presented me, but I did not catch her name, and concluded she was\r\nsome Italian relative of the Marochettis. Lady Granville did not appear,\r\nbeing unwell; and Lady Ailesbury, the only other lady present, did the\r\nhonours. The party consisted of the Duc de Richelieu (whom I had met the\r\nnight before at the Clarendons'), the Duca di Ripalta, Lord Clanwilliam,\r\nLord Tankerville, Baron Brunnow, Count Strogonoff, Chief Justice Cockburn,\r\nand myself.\r\n\r\nUpon sitting down at table I found myself between the Duc de Richelieu and\r\nLord Clanwilliam, and one removed from the foreign lady, who turned out\r\nto be H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia. Strogonoff is the man she\r\nmarried three years after her first husband's death--but she had to wait\r\ntill Nicholas died too. When Nicholas first observed his daughter's\r\npreference for the young officer, he took him by the arm and pointed out\r\nfrom the window the view of Fort George. Strogonoff thought the Emperor's\r\nmanner strange, but did not take the hint till his brother officers\r\nreminded him that Fort George is a State prison; so there was no more\r\nlove-making till after the Tsar's death.\r\n\r\nThe Princess is at this time fifty, still extremely handsome, with a long\r\nstring of enormous pearls round her neck. Nothing could be more lively and\r\nagreeable. She first carried on a contest with my neighbour, the Duc, about\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon; said he was only _trop bon_, and lauded him to the\r\nskies. The Duc came out as the pure Legitimist, though he said his own\r\nparty had not a shadow of a chance; that the Emperor had been going down\r\never since the fatal Italian campaign; that there were no Orleanists in\r\nFrance, and that the Duc d'Aumale was conspiring against the Comte de\r\nParis, &c. &c.--a tissue of absurdity. Then, _sotto voce_ to me, 'Je\r\nvoudrais bien jouir davantage de votre société, mais vous voyez comme\r\nje suis placé' (i.e. next the Princess). 'Très conservative dans mes\r\nprincipes, je n'aime pas les princes. Il faut vivre avec ses égaux.' He\r\nsaid this twice. The second time I replied, 'Monsieur, cela est bon pour\r\nles ducs--mais nous autres?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! sous ce rapport je ne fais aucune distinction. Hors des princes, tout\r\nest égal.'\r\n\r\nA good deal of conversation about the Irish Church Bill which is just now\r\nin the crisis of the Lords' amendments. H.I.H. asked me my opinion. I\r\nreplied that they were now disputing about nothing at all--i.e. the\r\napplication of a surplus which will not exist for many years. Brunnow said\r\nhe was of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nLord Clanwilliam and I had a great deal of talk. He had been with Lord\r\nCastlereagh at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. Spoke a good deal\r\nof Metternich, justly. When M. met Guizot in London after 1848, he\r\nwas struck by the motto G. had adopted--_via recta brevissima_. Lord\r\nClanwilliam said that the shortest way was also the best. 'Yes,' added\r\nMetternich, 'and it has also the advantage that on that path you don't meet\r\nanybody'--'auf diesen Weg wird niemand begegnet.'\r\n\r\nSitting upstairs after this dinner I had a curious conversation with\r\nBrunnow and Lord Granville on the causes of the Crimean War. They agreed\r\nthat had either Aberdeen or Palmerston been in power alone, the war would\r\nhave been prevented; but that the combination of the two rendered it\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nBrunnow said that there was, at one moment, a period of about ten days\r\nduring which the war might have been prevented, if Lord Granville had been\r\nsent off on a special mission to St. Petersburg, but the Cabinet refused;\r\nand then came Sinope. He declared that he had always told the Emperor that\r\nAberdeen, though averse to war, had not the power to prevent it; and in\r\nproof of his own sincerity he caused a million of Russian money which was\r\nin the Bank of England to be removed, as early as September 1853, though\r\nthis was against the opinion of Nesselrode.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to England on the peace, Lord Aberdeen said to him,\r\nwith great emotion, 'I never deceived you, my dear Brunnow.' To which B.\r\nreplied: 'No; my dear lord, you never did.' He said that at Paris in 1856\r\nWalewski had at once told him that the Emperor Napoleon was resolved to\r\nhave peace.\r\n\r\nIt was a most pleasant and curious evening, and everyone went away in good\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n_25th_--Went to Aix with Helen Richardson. Over to Cologne and Kreuznach\r\nwith the Watneys and Boothbys. Dined with Goldsmid at Bonn. Saw Professor\r\nSybel there.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, on a subject in which Mrs. Oliphant took much\r\ninterest, was addressed to Reeve rather in his editorial than his personal\r\ncapacity. The two were very well acquainted, but do not seem to have\r\ncorresponded in ordinary course.\r\n\r\nDunkerque, August 14th.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--You will, I have no doubt, think it extremely womanish and\r\nunreasonable on my part to have proposed writing a paper on such a\r\nmuch-discussed subject as Mr. Mill's book, without indicating the manner in\r\nwhich I should treat it; but my object was, first, to know whether it was\r\nopen, and if you would be disposed, other things harmonising, to entrust it\r\nto me. I will not say, as was my first impulse, that your own intention of\r\ntaking up the subject is quite sufficient answer for me; for, of course,\r\nyou are the best judge in that respect, and I am really anxious to have\r\nan opportunity of saying my say, with gravity and pains, on a matter so\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with you in your opinion of Mr. Mill's theory of marriage\r\nand the relations between men and women. I think it is not only fallacious,\r\nbut a strangely superficial way of regarding a question which is made\r\nonly the more serious by the fact that a great deal of suffering and much\r\ninjustice result, not from arbitrary and removable causes, but from nature\r\nherself, and those fundamental laws which no agitation can abrogate.\r\n\r\nMy own idea is that woman is neither lesser man, nor the rival of man, but\r\na creature with her share of work so well defined and so untransferable, as\r\nto make it impossible for her, whatsoever might be her gifts and training,\r\nto compete with him on perfectly fair terms. There may or may not be\r\ngeneral inferiority of intellect--I have no theory on the subject; but\r\nintellect, in my opinion, is not the matter in question. Could the burdens\r\nof maternity be transferred, or could a class of female celibates be\r\ninstituted, legislation might be able to do everything for them. But beyond\r\nthis, I do not see how we can go, except in the case of such measures as\r\nthose you refer to for the protection of the property of married women,\r\nwhich has already been anticipated by ordinary good sense and prudence, and\r\nthus been proved as practicable as it is evidently needful.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to accept gratefully such safeguards of practical justice,\r\nand also every possibility of improved education, though I put no great\r\nfaith in the results of the latter; the great difficulty in the case of\r\nevery female student being, in my opinion, not the want of power, or\r\nperseverance, or energy, but the simple yet much more inexorable fact that\r\nshe is a woman, and liable, the moment she marries, to interruptions\r\nand breaks in her life, which must infallibly weaken all her chances of\r\nsuccess. This is the line I should take in any paper on the subject; and\r\nas few people could speak more fully from experience, I think perhaps my\r\ncontribution to the discussion--from within, as it were, and not from\r\nwithout--might be worth having. Believe me, truly yours,\r\n\r\nM. O. W. OLIPHANT.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the lines here indicated, Mrs. Oliphant wrote the article on 'Mill\r\nand the Subjection of Women' in the October number of the 'Review.'\r\n\r\nOn August 24th, Reeve with his wife started for Scotland; but the grouse\r\nhad been nearly exterminated by the disease, the shooting was everywhere\r\nvery indifferent, and a month was passed in a number of friendly visits, of\r\nwhich little trace is left beyond the bare names. On September 21st they\r\nreturned to London, where, in preparing for a contemplated journey to\r\nPortugal, he had to arrange for the sittings of the Judicial Committee\r\nimmediately after his return. The following shows the kind of difficulty he\r\nhad to contend with:--\r\n\r\n_From Lord Cairns_\r\n\r\n_September 27th_--I am very sorry that I shall be unable to take part in\r\nyour sittings after Michaelmas Term. I have arranged to give up November to\r\nthat dreadful arbitration of the London, Chatham, and Dover, which, in a\r\nweak moment, Salisbury and I undertook; and, after that, I go to Mentone,\r\nwhere I have taken a house for the winter.... I should regret very much to\r\ndissever myself from the sittings of the Judicial Committee, which I\r\nhave always found agreeable, both from the interesting character of the\r\nbusiness, and from the pleasant composition of the tribunal; and I hope in\r\nnext year to be able to afford more service than I have in this; but for\r\nthe next sitting I must not be reckoned on. I hope you will enjoy your run\r\nto Portugal.\r\n\r\nThis contemplated tour was, no doubt, mainly for the pleasure and interest\r\nof visiting a country still unknown to him, but with a slight pretext of\r\nbusiness, as chairman of the Lusitanian Mining Company. A few days before\r\nhis departure he received the following from Lord Clarendon:--\r\n\r\n_The Grove, October 3rd_--You will not find Murray at Lisbon, as he is\r\non leave; but a letter shall be written, and to Doria, the _chargé\r\nd'affaires_, to render you any service in his power. Do you want one to the\r\nconsul at Oporto?\r\n\r\nI am glad you approved what I said at Watford. I never dreamt of the speech\r\nmaking a sensation, but it has; and as there was nothing remarkable in it,\r\nit is a proof that people were looking for an assurance from somebody that\r\na policy of spoliation was not meditated.\r\n\r\nI can't say I got much good from Wiesbaden, where mental torpor, and not a\r\ndozen red boxes per day, is required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so, accompanied by his wife and daughter, and armed with these letters\r\nof introduction and 'a Foreign Office bag, more,' wrote Mrs. Reeve, 'to\r\ngive us importance, I suspect, than to convey despatches,' Reeve started as\r\nsoon as his work was cleared off and the October number of the 'Review' was\r\nfairly out of his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason best known to himself, Portugal is not a favourite\r\nhunting-ground of the tourist; and the country--though almost at our door,\r\nthough bound to us by alliance in war and friendship in peace for more than\r\ntwo hundred years, though possessing beautiful scenery and the grandest of\r\nhistorical associations--remains comparatively unknown. So far as he was\r\nconcerned, Reeve had long wished to dispel this darkness, and the fact of\r\nhis being Chairman of the Lusitanian Mining Company gave him the desired\r\nopportunity. His Journal of the tour is here, as on former occasions,\r\nelaborated by extracts (in square brackets) from Mrs. Reeve's.\r\n\r\n_October 9th_--Started for Portugal on board the 'Douro' from Southampton.\r\nFine passage. Landed at Lisbon on October 13th. Hôtel Bragança. Kindly\r\nreceived by Pinto Basto. Excursion to Cintra on the 14th.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--Dined with Pinto Basto and met Fonseca. 16th, to Caldas. 17th,\r\nto Alcobaça; then drove on to Batalha, and slept at Leiria. These great\r\nmonasteries, now deserted, with their architecture and their tombs, are of\r\nthe highest interest.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--From Leiria to Pombal, and thence by rail to Coimbra [armed with\r\nletters of introduction from Count Lavradio, including one to the 'Rector\r\nMagnificus,' described as 'homme aimable et fort instruit, surtout dans les\r\nsciences physiques.']\r\n\r\n[The buildings of the University are not remarkable either way. The Rector\r\nreceived us very courteously; showed us himself the splendid view from the\r\ntower, the Salle where degrees are conferred, and allowed us to peep into\r\na gallery and through a window to see the lecture-rooms; then, making his\r\nbow, sent us with an attendant to the chapel, where we were joined by the\r\nProfessor of German, Herr Dürzen, clad in the ample cape or cloak and with\r\nthe black jelly-bag cap which is the academic costume. He took us to the\r\nlibrary, a large and striking saloon with carved and gilt pilasters and\r\ngalleries.... There are about 900 students, of whom a large proportion\r\ncomes from the Brazils. They look very picturesque in their floating\r\ndrapery and hanging headgear; but the cape must be always impeding the free\r\nuse of arms and legs, and the cap--now that its original use as a begging\r\npurse has ceased--might well be exchanged for a 'sombrero.' Herr Dürzen\r\naccompanied us to the Botanic Gardens, where his friend and countryman,\r\nGötze, showed us a splendid magnolia, Australian pines, and a great variety\r\nof eucalypti.... We then drove to the entrance of the footway leading to\r\nthe Penedo da Saudade, a walk much affected by the Coimbrese. Then to the\r\nQuinta da Santa Cruz, the summer residence of the monks. Truly they had\r\nmade them lordly pleasure-grounds, orange groves, hedges like tall walls\r\nof arbor-vitae, terraces leading to fountains and cascades, azulejo-lined\r\nbenches surrounding marble floors, shaded by grand old laurels.... The\r\nQuinta now belongs to a rich butter factor, who lets everything ornamental\r\ngo to wreck and ruin, or just clears it off for farm purposes.... The\r\nbutter factor's dogs came out barking and biting as we left the garden.\r\nHenry made a timely retreat; the professor showed fight, and came off\r\nsecond best, with his mantle torn. Then to the Church of Santa Cruz and to\r\nthe monastic buildings attached....]\r\n\r\n_20th_.--Coimbra to Mealhada, then to Luso, and walked to Busaco. Convent\r\nof Busaco. Scene of battle. Rail to Estarreja [which we reached at 6 P.M.\r\nA splendid full moon lighted our drive to Palhal. Mr. Cruikshank met us at\r\nthe station, and drove Henry in his dog-cart; Hopie and I, with our bags,\r\nwent in the _char-à-banc_ which had been procured from Aveiro. The distance\r\nis about eight miles, seven of which are a gentle ascent, and then a steep\r\npitch down of one mile. Flags were flying in honour of the arrival of\r\nthe chairman of the 'Lusitanian Company,' and after dinner a display of\r\nfireworks. Mr. and Mrs. Cruikshank are a pleasing and intelligent young\r\nScotch couple. Three of their children are at Granja, a little bathing\r\nvillage two or three stations further, and Mrs. Cruikshank and her eldest\r\nlittle girl came back to receive us.]\r\n\r\n_21st_.--[The mine at Palhal yields copper ore; that of Carvalhal lead ore.\r\nThe Pinto Basto family have the concession of the mines, and own much\r\nof the surface. From five to eight hundred persons are employed--all\r\nPortuguese, except the three mining captains, the dresser of the ores, a\r\ncarpenter, and a blacksmith. The English colony consists of about thirty\r\nsouls; there is a school for the children, and on Sundays they meet for\r\nDivine worship after the manner of Wesleyans. The wages of these Cornishmen\r\nare eight, ten, twelve pounds a month, and there are very tidy houses\r\non the property, with a large cottage, or house, for the agent--Mr.\r\nCruikshank. The works are in the ravine below the house, and the Caima\r\nfurnishes ample water power.... Many women and girls are employed preparing\r\nthe ores, some of them remarkably good-looking.... Their wages are from two\r\nto three shillings a week. The scenery--pine-clad hills, streams on the\r\nhill-side, ravines, and burns--reminded one of Scotland; but oranges and\r\ncamellias in the gardens, arbutus, myrtle, laurustinus, cistus, all wild,\r\ntell of a different climate.... We explored Palhal on Thursday, and\r\nCarvalhal on Friday; Henry and Mr. Cruikshank going into details at the\r\nworks, whilst we went, with Mrs. Cruikshank, to call on the wives, visit\r\nthe school, &c.... On Friday evening we took the train at Estarreja, and so\r\nto Oporto.]\r\n\r\n_25th_.--Adolph Pinto Basto [a nephew of our Lisbon friends] gave us an\r\nentertainment in a boat on the Douro, and a collation at Avintes. Dinner at\r\nthe Crystal Palace, Oporto.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--Drove to Carvalho with Elles.\r\n\r\n_27th_.--Drove to Leça do Balio with Oswald Crawford, the consul.\r\nInteresting Templars' church.\r\n\r\n_28th-30th_.--By rail from Oporto to Madrid, thirty-six hours by Badajos,\r\nMerida, Alcazar.\r\n\r\n_31st_.--Madrid. Gallery. Bull-fight for the benefit of 'El Tato.' [We\r\nhad seen him at Valencia, nine years ago, in the pride and bloom of his\r\ncareer--a career cut short not so much by the fury of the bull as by\r\nthe ignorance of the surgeon. Presently the chief door of the arena was\r\nunbarred, and an open carriage, with three men in the dress of matadors and\r\n'El Tato' in the 'plain clothes' of a peasant drove round. Great was the\r\nsensation. The men shouted, the women wept, the old lady at my elbow shed\r\nfloods of tears; cigars and hats were flung to him; he bowed, kissed his\r\nhand, wiped his eyes. Then the regular work of the day commenced.] Very\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n_November 2nd_.--Left Madrid for Avila, passing the Escorial.\r\n\r\n_3rd_.--Avila and then on to Burgos.\r\n\r\n_4th_.--Burgos. Cathedral. Monuments.\r\n\r\n_5th_.--Reached Biarritz at 10 P.M., and so to Paris.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--Paris. Saw Désclès in 'Frou-frou.' Great actress.\r\n\r\nHome on the 9th. A well-spent month.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nYork House, le 11 novembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Mon oncle Aumale et moi nous vous remercions des\r\npaquets que vous nous avez envoyés ce matin; mon oncle me charge de vous\r\ndire qu'il n'a pu vous écrire aujourd'hui, étant fort occupé des soins à\r\ndonner à la Duchesse d'Aumale, qui est toujours dans un état assez grave,\r\nmais que vous lui ferez grand plaisir si vous voulez venir passer au\r\nWoodnorton la semaine du 22 au 29 novembre; il y aura quelques chasses à\r\ntir.\r\n\r\nJe viens de mon côté vous demander de nous faire le plaisir de venir, avec\r\nMadame et Mademoiselle Reeve, déjeuner ici dimanche prochain à midi et\r\ndemie; c'est le seul jour où je puisse vous voir, car je pars lundi matin\r\npour le Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nVeuillez me croire votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nAs to which the Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_November 14th_.--Breakfasted at York House. The Duc d'Aumale came, but the\r\nDuchesse was ill, and on December 6th she died.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Paris telegraphed the news to Reeve the same evening, and\r\nwrote the next day asking him to charge himself with sending a little\r\nnotice of it to the principal newspapers--a thing Reeve readily undertook\r\nto do. Before receiving the request, he had already written expressing\r\nhis wish to attend the funeral, and the Comte de Paris acknowledged both\r\nletters at the same time.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nYork House, le 7 décembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je m'empresse de vous remercier de vos deux\r\nlettres et de la manière dont vous avez répondu à ma demande.\r\n\r\nMon oncle Aumale est bien touché de l'intention que vous exprimez de venir\r\nvous associer à sa douleur le jour des funérailles de ma tante. Elles son\r\nfixées à vendredi prochain. La première cérémonie aura lieu à Orléans House\r\nà 9-1/2h du matin, après quoi nous conduirons le corps à Weybridge, pour le\r\ndéposer dans le caveau de famille. Nous y serons vers midi, ou peut-être un\r\npeu plus tard, car il est difficile de calculer très exactement l'arrivée\r\nde ce triste convoi. Ce ne sera en tous cas pas avant midi.\r\n\r\nJe termine en vous priant de me croire\r\n\r\nVotre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS\r\n\r\n'I attended her funeral on the 10th'--Reeve noted in his Journal--'and went\r\nin an immense procession from Twickenham to Weybridge.'\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, November 21st_.--I never had any taste for travelling. I would\r\nwillingly go a hundred miles for an hour's conversation with such or such a\r\nperson; but the miles themselves have little interest for me. However,\r\nyour tour in Portugal, as you describe it, would have tempted me. I like a\r\ncountry which is different from all others. Still, I am quite sure that,\r\nafter having amused yourself in Portugal, you are very glad to be back in\r\nEngland....\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon may be quite easy; no difficulty affecting his department\r\nwill come from here. Country and Government are equally inclined to peace.\r\nAs to our home affairs, which alone have any interest just now, I am a\r\nlittle sad, but not uneasy. We are returning--quietly, ignorantly, and with\r\ntottering steps--into the right path, the parliamentary system. The country\r\nis coming back to it. The Emperor does not, and will not, offer any serious\r\nresistance to it. We shall make blunders, both in our procedure and\r\ndebates, but shall, nevertheless, make sensible progress. What we are in\r\nwant of is the men.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_Hinton St. George, November 25th._--Mrs. Reeve, when I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing her at Hinton, gave me an assurance that I should not be troubled\r\nthis year with any request to attend the Privy Council. Your letter,\r\ntherefore, is an act of _gross domestic insubordination_--a kind of petty\r\ntreason. Formerly it was the act of the husband that bound the wife; _mais\r\nnous avons changé tout cela_; the act of the wife binds the husband. I\r\nappeal unto Caesar. It is very easy for Lord Chelmsford and yourself, who\r\nhave your town houses in order, your servants, horses, carriages, and whole\r\nestablishments, not omitting the _placens uxor_, to talk of the 'patriotic\r\nduty' of attending the Privy Council--having nothing else to do, and\r\nwanting amusement; but my house is thoroughly dismantled, having been under\r\nrepair; I have not a room to sit down in with comfort, nor servants to\r\nattend to me, nor a cook to cook my dinner, nor any of those _solatia_ or\r\n_solamina_ which you have in profusion. Yet you, with great unconcern,\r\ndesire me to quit my family, and all my amusements and enjoyments, that I\r\nmay come to town to endure complete wretchedness, and have a bad dinner\r\nand an indigestion everyday, _ut plebi placeam et declamatio fiam_. If\r\nyou think this reasonable and right, I am sure you have left all sense of\r\nreasonableness in Lusitania. Besides, have you not a plethora of judicial\r\nwealth and power? Have you not the Lord Justice, who has little else to do;\r\nand the Admiralty Judge; and that great Adminiculum, the learned and pious\r\nman whom, _honoris causâ_, I call Holy Joe? [Footnote: Probably sir Joseph\r\nNapier, nominated to a place on the Judicial Committee by Disraeli in March\r\n1868.] But to speak more gravely. Had I had the least conception that I\r\nshould have been wanted--that is, _really_ wanted--I would have made other\r\narrangements than I have done.... We shall now have a house full of people\r\nuntil December 20th, and I cannot, without much offence, relieve myself\r\nfrom these deferred engagements. A little while ago I was thrown out of my\r\nshooting-cart; I injured my arm, which has brought on rheumatism, and I am\r\nnot in a condition to come up to a solitary and dismantled house in London\r\nwithout anything requisite for the comfort of an old man. On January 20th,\r\nuntil the beginning of appeals in the Lords, I will, if you need it, sit\r\nand dispose of all the colonial and admiralty appeals. When will you come\r\ndown and shoot?\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate, December 19th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lord Derby, [Footnote: For some years Reeve had known him as Lord\r\nStanley. He had succeeded to the title on October 23rd.]--I cannot without\r\nemotion address you by your present name. Although I never had the honour\r\nof much personal acquaintance with your father, he has been, for the last\r\nthirty years, an object of familiar interest even to those with whom he was\r\nnot familiar. His high spirit, his splendid eloquence, his public services,\r\nhave endeared him to thousands whom he hardly knew, and caused them to\r\nshare the feelings with which you, in a far higher degree, must regard this\r\ngreat loss. I have no doubt, however, that you will support and increase\r\nthe honour of a name so illustrious, and I know no one more fit to bear\r\nit.... Mrs. Reeve begs to join with me in again presenting to you our very\r\nsincere regards, and I remain,\r\n\r\nVery faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nHENRY REEVE.\r\n\r\nOf social engagements, the Journal mentions--\r\n\r\nTo Farnborough for Christmas, and thence to Timsbury till the end of the\r\nyear. I called at Broadlands, now occupied by the Cowper Temples.\r\n\r\n_January 5th_, 1870.--To Hinton. Vice-Chancellor Stuart there. Lord\r\nWestbury very amusing. Shooting every day. In Cudworth covers killed 192\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from M. Guizot refers to an incident which caused a\r\ntremendous sensation at the time, and--judged by the later events--may\r\nbe considered as a portent of the downfall of the Empire. Prince Pierre\r\nBonaparte had challenged M. Henri Rochefort, the editor of a violent\r\nRepublican journal which had published a scurrilous and abusive article.\r\nM. Grousset, the writer of the article, took the responsibility, and, on\r\nJanuary 10th, sent his friends, Victor Noir and Ulric Fonvielle, to wait on\r\nthe Prince at his house in the Rue d'Auteuil. The Prince said his challenge\r\nwas to M. Rochefort; to M. Grousset he had nothing to say. A quarrel and a\r\nfree fight followed. Each man drew his revolver, and Victor Noir, mortally\r\nwounded, broke out of the room, staggered into the street, and fell dead.\r\nFonvielle escaped uninjured. He and the Prince were the only witnesses of\r\nwhat took place, and their stories directly contradicted each other. The\r\nPrince was tried on a charge of murder, but was acquitted. On a civil trial\r\nhe was sentenced to pay 1,000 £ damages to the father of Victor Noir, as\r\ncompensation for the loss of his son's services.\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, January 12th_.--I do not yet rightly understand the tragic\r\nincident at Auteuil. I am inclined to think that Prince Pierre Bonaparte\r\nwas threatened and assaulted before using his revolver; the probabilities\r\nare that he acted in self-defence. The trial will be curious. In any case,\r\nit is a great misfortune for the Imperial Government, more so than for the\r\nnew Cabinet, which will certainly not be wanting in courage, and will be\r\nsupported by whoever is anxious to practise 'economy of revolution,' as a\r\nfriend of mine says.\r\n\r\nI have friends in this Cabinet, honourable, liberal-minded, and sensible\r\nmen. Will a leader be found among them? We shall see. Hitherto organisation\r\nhas been everywhere wanting; in the Legislative Body, as in the Cabinet. I\r\nsee no reason to change the opinion I formed some time since, and perhaps\r\nalready mentioned to you; I am sad, rather than uneasy, for the future of\r\nmy country. She will not fall into the abyss; but, for want of political\r\nforesight and firmness, will allow herself to be dragged along the edge of\r\nit. Men's minds and characters are narrowed rather than corrupted.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with which the Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_January 16th_.--Dined at Lord Granville's, with Lavalette, the new French\r\nambassador. The Emperor had just formed a more liberal ministry, with Daru\r\nand Ollivier, which soon broke down owing to Buffet's _entêtement_.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--Dinner at Clarendon's, to meet the Queen of Holland.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 31st_.--I have just read the article on Calvin with a real\r\nand lively satisfaction, complete, so far as I am concerned; I am very\r\ngrateful to Mr. Cunningham (I think that is the author's name) for his kind\r\nwords, and for his sympathy with my description of Calvin and his time. Be\r\nso good as to thank him for me; it is a pleasure to be so well understood\r\nand set forth. As to Calvin, Mr. Cunningham does full justice to his\r\nmerits; I ask a little more indulgence for his faults, which belonged to\r\nthe time quite as much as to the man. Very few, even among superior men,\r\nadmitted the rights of conscience and liberty. Marnix de Ste.-Aldegonde\r\nbitterly reproached the hero of the Reformation, William the Silent, with\r\ntolerating Catholics in Holland. Melanchthon unreservedly approved of\r\nthe burning of Servetus. Catholic Europe was covered with stakes for the\r\nProtestants, and, if Servetus had had the upper hand, I doubt if Calvin\r\nwould have received from him any better treatment than he received from\r\nCalvin. I do not on that account detest the burning of Servetus any the\r\nless; but I do not count it as a fault personal and peculiar to Calvin. In\r\nevery-day life and in systematic theology he ignored the rights of freedom.\r\nThe twofold error was enormous; but his policy and philosophy were equally\r\nsincere, and, of all the eminent despots of history, he was, I think, one\r\nof the least ambitious and most disinterested. He was almost forced into\r\npower against his will, and he wielded it harshly, tyrannically, but\r\nwithout seeking any personal gain, and he was still more severe to himself\r\nthan to those whom he treated so severely....\r\n\r\nThe Journal goes on:--\r\n\r\n_March 5th_.--Visit to the Watneys, at Leamington, and to\r\nStratford-upon-Avon. Beautiful effect in the church, the organ playing\r\n'Rest in the Lord.'\r\n\r\n_12th_.--Evening at Lady Cowley's, for Queen of Holland.\r\n\r\nWent to Isle of Wight with W. Wallace at Easter. The Bishop of Winchester\r\npreached in Ventnor Church on April 24th (first Sunday after Easter).\r\n\r\n_From M. Gulzot_\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 7th_.--... It is curious to watch France, and I am also\r\ncurious as to the possible consequences of what is happening in England.\r\nFrance has never been so liberal and so anti-revolutionary at the same\r\ntime. England is making a thoroughly liberal reform in Ireland, and at the\r\nsame time a severe law of repression for the defence of order. I wish and\r\nhope for your success in both. I also hope that our attempt at quiet and\r\nliberal reform will not fall through. But both for you and for us there\r\nare rugged paths yet to traverse; the future is still darkly clouded. Even\r\nafter the success of our respective undertakings, Ireland will not be\r\npacified, and political liberty will not be established in France. There\r\nis no need to be discouraged, the best of human works are incomplete and\r\ninsufficient; but there is need to beware of illusions, to be prepared for\r\ndisappointments, to be always ready to begin again. I moralise on politics.\r\nGood sense is the law of politics, and what I have learnt from history,\r\nabove all, is that good sense is essentially moral. You will, therefore,\r\nnot be surprised that I mix morals and politics....\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_April 13th_.--How shall I thank you for your inspiriting letter, which was\r\nas the sound of the trumpet to the aged war-horse! I fear my contemporaries\r\nhave taken a more accurate measurement of my power, and that I shall never\r\nfulfil any such glorious destiny as you hold before my eyes. It is true of\r\nmany men that _possunt quia posse videntur_; and that they accomplish many\r\nthings simply because they are not fastidious. I should never do anything,\r\nsimply because I should tear up one day what I had written the preceding.\r\nIt would be Penelope's web. Our education is too aesthetical. Unless a\r\ncultivated taste be overpowered by personal vanity, it is very difficult\r\nto complete any composition. I can most truly say that I have never done\r\nanything, speaking or writing, of which I could say, on the review, _mihi\r\nplaudo_.\r\n\r\nWe have a great difference of opinion in the members of the Digest\r\nCommission. Many think that the work should be handed over to two or three\r\nvery able men (not judges or Emeriti Chancellors), who should be well paid;\r\nand that to them, with a staff of subordinates, all the work should be\r\ncommitted. Others think that there should be added to this establishment\r\nsome presiding power, consisting of one, two, or three distinguished\r\njudges, to whom all questions should be referred, and whose duty it\r\nshould be to give an _imprimatur_ to the work. So we cannot agree on a\r\nrecommendation to the Government; and when we shall do so, but little\r\nweight will attach to it.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_May 6th_.--Mansfield came back from India.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Russian war, Reeve and Mansfield had been on terms of\r\nintimacy, and, in fact, it was largely through Reeve's interest with Lord\r\nClarendon that Mansfield had been sent to Constantinople in 1855, as\r\nmilitary adviser to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. Since then the intimacy\r\nhad been interrupted by Mansfield's absence in India, where he had served\r\nwith distinction during the Mutiny, and afterwards in command of the Bombay\r\narmy and as commander-in-chief since 1865. In the following year he was\r\nraised to the peerage as Lord Sandhurst. The Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_May 26th_.--The King of Portugal made me a Commander of the Order of\r\nChrist; but this was solely as chairman of the Lusitanian Mining Company.\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale, Mansfield, Lord Dunsany, Lord Northbrook, Stirling\r\nMaxwell, Lady Molesworth dined with us.\r\n\r\n_From the Marquis of Salisbury_\r\n\r\n40 Dover Street, June 1st.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--It is my pleasing duty to inform you that the University\r\nof Oxford wish to express their sense of your literary services and\r\nattainments by conferring on you an honorary degree at the approaching\r\ncommemoration. I trust that it will not be disagreeable to you to accede\r\nto their wishes in this matter, and that you will be able without\r\ninconvenience to attend at Oxford to receive the degree. The day on which\r\nthey will be conferred will be on Tuesday, the 21st inst.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very truly,\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_June 3rd_.--Excursion to Malvern, Hereford, and Worcester. Xavier Raymond\r\ncame to Bushey [Duc de Nemours']. I breakfasted there on the 10th. [On the\r\n11th the Duke wrote]:--\r\n\r\nCher Monsieur Reeve,--Je lis ce matin en tête des colonnes du journal le\r\n'Times,' un charmant premier article sur mon fils aîné, et portant même son\r\nnom pour titre. Cet article inspiré par un bienveillant sentiment envers\r\nlui et ma famille en général, met dans un brillant relief les services que\r\nmon fils vient de rendre à son pays d'adoption. Cela a donc été pour moi\r\nune extrême satisfaction que de le voir placé en première ligne dans le\r\njournal le plus répandu du monde.\r\n\r\nJe sais qu'il n'est pas permis de s'enquérir du nom de ceux qui écrivent\r\ndans la presse anglaise. Mais si à vous le nom de l'auteur était connu,\r\ndans ce cas-ci, cher Monsieur Reeve, et si vous appreniez aussi à qui est\r\ndue l'insertion de cet article, je vous serais très reconnaissant (dans le\r\ncas toutefois où vous le jugerez convenable) de faire connaître à l'une et\r\nà l'autre de ces personnes combien j'en ai été heureux et touché.\r\n\r\nPlein du bon souvenir de votre visite d'hier, je vous renouvelle ici, cher\r\nMonsieur Reeve, l'assurance de mes bien affectueux sentiments.\r\n\r\nLOUIS D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Delane_\r\n\r\n_June 13th_.--I return the Duke's letter with many thanks. The story of\r\nthe Brazilian article is curious enough to be worth telling. At the\r\nRothschilds' ball on Wednesday last I was by an inadvertence placed at\r\nsupper next but one to the Duc de Nemours, and next to a beautiful young\r\nlady. I had long been honoured by the Duc d'Aumale's acquaintance, but had\r\nnever before met his brother, and I only slowly became aware who were my\r\nneighbours. Then, actually at the supper, among ortolans and peaches, it\r\noccurred to me that the Comte d'Eu, of whose exploits I had been reading\r\nthat morning, and whom I had stupidly regarded as merely a Brazilian\r\ngeneral, must be the brother of the beautiful young lady next me, and\r\ntherefore a personage in whom the European public would take a very\r\ndifferent sort of interest from any that Marshal Coxios could command,\r\nthat, in short, as an Orleans prince, he would be worth an article, though\r\nno one would have cared for a mere Brazilian general.\r\n\r\n_From the Due de Nemours_\r\n\r\n_Bushey Park, 15 juin_.--J'ai à la fois des remercîments et des\r\nfélicitations à vous adresser pour avoir pris la peine de chercher de qui\r\némanait l'aimable article du 'Times' sur mon fils aîné, et pour l'avoir si\r\nbien découvert. Le compliment est assurément de très bon goût, et j'y suis\r\ntrès sensible. Il augmente seulement encore mon regret de n'avoir pu, moi\r\naussi, faire à ce même bal la connaissance de l'auteur de cette aimable\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_June 17th_.--I read with 'perfect horror' last night the return of\r\nbusiness before the Judicial Committee which you were so good as to send\r\nme. There are 350 appeals in all, of which 248 are from India. I do not\r\nthink less than two days can be allotted to each of these Indian appeals,\r\ntaking the average; that will require 496 days of sitting, being more than\r\ntwo years; for you cannot, if the committee sat every day the Court of\r\nChancery does, exceed more than 210 days in the year. Now if to this amount\r\nof duty for the Indian appeals be added the time required for the remaining\r\n102 appeals, you cannot attribute to them less than 102 days, making in all\r\n598 days, being at least three years' work for a committee sitting every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhilst these arrears are being disposed of, a new crop of appeals to at\r\nleast the same amount, will be mature. What shall we do? 'Hills over hills\r\nand Alps on Alps arise.' I shall mention the subject to-night. Pray, send\r\nme this morning any suggestions that occur to you.\r\n\r\n_June 18th_.--I am engaged to leave town for a short cruise at sea,\r\nto-morrow early. I shall remain until Sunday evening. But it is for the\r\nbest that I cannot see you to-morrow, because I hope to 'interview' you on\r\nWednesday, after your return, with that renovation of genius and accretion\r\nof knowledge which will accompany you on your return from Parnassus, after\r\nhaving bathed in the fountain of the Muses. You must bring Mrs. Reeve a\r\nfaithful copy of the eulogistic speech of the public orator, and I will\r\ntranslate it to her.\r\n\r\nMy notice is for Thursday. I shall propose the immediate creation of three\r\njudges, the giving Colvile and Peel fitting remuneration--2,000 £. a year\r\neach--and a large addition to the salary of the registrar.\r\n\r\nThe Journal then has:--\r\n\r\n_June 20th_.--To Oxford, to stay with the Dean of Christchurch, on the\r\naccession of Lord Salisbury. Went down with Sir E. Landseer.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--Received the degree of D.C.L. from the University, in the\r\nSheldonian Theatre. Lord Salisbury greeted me as 'Vir potentissime in\r\nrepublicâ literarum,' at which I looked up and laughed. Dined afterwards in\r\nAll Souls' library with the Vice-Chancellor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the other distinguished persons who received the honorary D.C.L. at\r\nthe same time were Admirals Sir Henry Keppel and Sir John Hay, Sir William\r\nMansfield, and Sir Francis Grant, the President of the Royal Academy.\r\nMansfield gave the 'Gallery' some amusement by wearing a cocked hat and\r\nfeathers with his red doctor's gown, instead of the regulation academic\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_June 22nd_.--O vir doctissime et in republicâ literarum potentissime! So\r\nsaid or sung the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, in violation of\r\nall the traditions of the place; for Oxford never used before the phrase\r\n'respublica literarum' which words and the thing signified she has ever\r\nrepudiated and abhorred; and to be _potentissimus in republicâ_ are jarring\r\nand incoherent things. But let this hypercriticism pass, and when I see\r\nMrs. Reeve I shall tell her that the words were chosen with singular\r\nfelicity, and that they are not more remarkable for their truth and justice\r\nthan they are for their elegant latinity; but I will not say that you are a\r\ndoctor only _honoris causâ_, which are most emphatic words, and are cruelly\r\nmade to accompany the dignity; for, when translated, they mean: 'Oh,\r\ndoctor, do not presume to teach by virtue of this _semiplena graduatio_,\r\nfor it is only _honoris causâ_, or merely complimentary; and do not boast\r\nthis title as evidence of skill or erudition in laws, for they are\r\nsounding words that signify nothing. How easy it is for envy and malice to\r\ndepreciate!\r\n\r\nI hope Mrs. Reeve and your daughter were there, because it is something fit\r\nand able to give genuine pleasure; and if I had been there I would have\r\nanswered with stentorian voice to the well-known question: 'Placetne vobis,\r\nDomini Doctores? placetne vobis, Magistri?' 'Placet, imo valde placet.'...\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to tell the Government what ought to be done; for, first,\r\nthere should be great alteration in the Courts in the East Indies, and,\r\nsecondly, it is clear that the colonists and Indians will not be satisfied\r\nunless the Privy Council is presided over by a first-chop man; and I am\r\nassured that transferring three puisne judges from the Common Law Courts\r\nwould not be satisfactory. Can you call at my room in the House of Lords\r\nto-morrow, at a few minutes after four?\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, and with deeper respect than ever,\r\n\r\nWESTBURY.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose you will now miss a single bird.\r\n\r\n_From Senhor D. Jose Ferreira Pinto Basto_\r\n\r\n_Lisbon, June 18th_.--The Portuguese Government do not present those on\r\nwhom the orders of knighthood are conferred with the decorations they are\r\nentitled to wear. These consist, for a commander, in a placard, which is\r\nworn on the coat over the left side of the breast; a large cross hanging\r\nfrom a wide ribbon fastened round the neck; and a small cross, fastened by\r\na narrow ribbon to the upper button-hole, on the left side of the coat.\r\n\r\nThe crosses corresponding to the degree of commander are, for the Order of\r\nChrist, the same as those allowed to simple chevaliers, but having a heart\r\nover them for distinction, and the ribbons are red. The large pendant cross\r\nis scarcely ever worn, unless it be on a very solemn Court day, and even\r\nthen not generally; and the small cross, which was formerly in constant\r\nuse, when the pendant one was not worn, is now out of fashion, and either\r\nentirely left off or, at the most, substituted by a small ribbon on the\r\ncoat buttonhole, when no other decoration is worn. What is generally worn\r\non ceremonial occasions is simply the placard, such as I now send you; if,\r\nhowever, you should wish to have the other insignia, please to let me know\r\nit, that I may send them. These insignia are, of course, made more costly\r\nwith diamonds and rubies, to be worn on great festivities; but even then,\r\nand for general use, they are usually in silver and enamel, as the placard\r\nnow forwarded.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any need of your directly expressing to anyone here\r\nyour thanks for the distinction conferred upon you; the more so since you\r\nhave already expressed them through the Portuguese Minister in London.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the Journal mentions the death of the friend whose letters\r\nhave occupied such a prominent place in these pages:--\r\n\r\n_June 22nd_.--Fête at Strawberry Hill. Lord Clarendon was there, looking\r\nvery ill, and on the 27th he died--'Multis ille flebilis occidit, nulli\r\nflebilior quam mihi.'\r\n\r\nTo 'Fraser's Magazine' for August Reeve contributed a graceful article, 'In\r\nMemory of George Villiers, Earl of Clarendon,' in which, recording his many\r\npublic services, he especially dwelt on the very important service he had\r\nrendered to his country during the period of his being Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland, and on the fact that this service had had the singular honour of\r\nbeing directly referred to in the Queen's Speech on proroguing Parliament\r\non September 5th, 1848, which concluded, 'The energy and decision shown by\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland deserve my warmest approbation.' Reeve was\r\ntold by Lady Clarendon that her husband 'regarded these emphatic words as\r\nthe most enviable distinction of his life.'\r\n\r\nAt the same time another article, 'In Memoriam,' appeared in 'Macmillan's\r\nMagazine.' This was by Reeve's colleague at the Privy Council Office, Mr.\r\nArthur Helps, whose acquaintance with Lord Clarendon had been by no means\r\nso intimate. His appreciation was thus written from general repute rather\r\nthan from personal knowledge, but it contains one remarkable passage that\r\nmay be repeated in order to emphasise it:--\r\n\r\n'He--Lord Clarendon--was a man who indulged, notwithstanding his public\r\nlabours, in an immense private correspondence. There were some persons to\r\nwhom, I believe, he wrote daily; and perhaps in after years we shall be\r\nfavoured--those of us who live to see it--with a correspondence which will\r\nenlighten us as to many of the principal topics of our own period.'\r\n\r\nWhether Reeve was one of the persons Helps alluded to must remain doubtful.\r\nIn the strict sense of the words, Lord Clarendon did not write to him\r\ndaily; but at times he wrote not only daily, but three times a day,\r\n[Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. pp. 296-7.] and the letters, or extracts of\r\nletters, now printed, form but a very small portion of the great number\r\nwhich Reeve preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Journal then mentions:--\r\n\r\n_July 3rd_.--Breakfasted at Orleans House with Prince Philip of Würtemberg.\r\nMatters looked threatening abroad, and on the 14th the rupture took place\r\nbetween Franco and Prussia. On the 18th war was declared. On the 25th we\r\ndined at York House. I said to the Comte de Paris, 'How is the Emperor to\r\nattack Germany?' Nobody thought at first that the war would be in France;\r\nbut we were soon undeceived, and I speedily discovered the danger. The\r\nDuc d'Aumale wrote to me, 'Vous avez deviné ma pensée de Français et de\r\nsoldat.'\r\n\r\nI had hired a small moor at Ballachulish from Cameron, the innkeeper there.\r\nMaclean of Ardgour, to whom it belonged, lent me a keeper and some dogs.\r\nThe hills were steep, the shooting bad; but the life there most agreeable.\r\nI went down on August 3rd. W. Wallace was with us; and on the 5th we were\r\ninstalled at Ballachulish for six weeks. They were spent in shooting,\r\nsea-fishing, boating, &c. Fairfax Taylor [Footnote: Son of John Edward\r\nTaylor; see _ante_, p. 117.] came, and Longman. The Trevelyans Fyfes, and\r\nForsters were at the hotel on the other side of the ferry. We were there\r\nforty-five days. I went back to town by Greenock on September 21st.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the course of the war was most eventful. On August 6th the battle\r\nof Wörth was won by the Prussians, followed by a series of French defeats.\r\nOn September 2nd Macmahon and the Emperor capitulated at Sedan. William\r\nForster was at Ballachulish, and, as despatches were sent from the F. O. to\r\ncabinet ministers, we learnt the fact from him at 8.30 P.M. on September\r\n3rd. Gladstone, though prime minister, volunteered to write an article in\r\nthe 'Review' on the war, which he did. I kept the secret, but it leaked\r\nout through the 'Daily News' on November 3rd, and made a great noise. The\r\n'silver streak' was in that article.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, July 29th_.--Among the many bad actions described in history,\r\nthere is one which is very rare; it is the artifice of a tempter who throws\r\nthe blame of his attempt at seduction upon the person who rejected it,\r\nperhaps after listening to it. But this is what Bismarck has done. You have\r\nprobably not forgotten what happened in 1868, and what I wrote about it at\r\nthe time, in the 'Revue des deux Mondes' of September 15th. I take pleasure\r\nin here quoting my own words:--\r\n\r\n'It is said that M. de Bismarck attempted to engage France on the side of\r\nPrussia; and, in order to tempt the Imperial Government, offered to remodel\r\nEurope as well as Germany, and to give France a large share in this\r\nredistribution of nations. I do not know how much truth there was in these\r\nrumours, which so deeply moved Belgium and Holland, amongst others; I will\r\nnot stop to discuss reports and suppositions. However this may be, if such\r\noffers were really made, Napoleon III. did wisely in refusing them; he did\r\nnot raise himself to the throne as a victorious warrior, and France has no\r\nlonger a passion for conquest. But did he, in refusing, do all he could to\r\nstop or restrain Prussia in the ambitious course into which M. de Bismarck\r\nwas forcing her, and to influence the reorganisation of Germany according\r\nto the legitimate interests of France? I do not think so; but I put this\r\nquestion also on one side,' &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I did not lightly credit the rumours of the overtures\r\nmade by Bismarck to the French Government; they were not only widespread\r\nand believed by those who had the best information, but my friends in\r\nHolland sent me precise details, and I immediately got the 'Journal des\r\nDébats' to publish an article which treated this attempted temptation as it\r\ndeserved, and pointed out the honourable and pacific policy which France\r\nought to follow on this occasion. I have reason to think that men of good\r\nsense in the French Government, who were trying to make the policy of law\r\nand peace prevail, congratulated themselves on being thus loudly upheld and\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\nNever forget, 'my dear sir,' what the position of the friends of law and\r\npeace is in our general policy. You must some time have read Bürger's\r\nballad of the 'Wild Huntsman,' founded on the legend of a certain nobleman,\r\non the banks of the Rhine, a great hunter, who, if I mistake not, could\r\nnever mount his horse for the chase without being accompanied, on either\r\nside, by a good and a bad angel, one urging him to follow the beaten track,\r\nand respect the rights of property, the other urging him to rush across the\r\nfields, trampling down harvest, gardens, and passers-by, careless of what\r\ninjury he inflicted.\r\n\r\nFor a long time France, both as to her Government and her people, has been\r\nin the position of this hunter, always accompanied by the two angels; all\r\nthat has happened in France and in Europe during the last eighty years has\r\nput us in that position, and it is sometimes the good angel, sometimes the\r\nbad, which has made itself heard, and has seemed on the point of becoming\r\nthe hunter's master. There is not a right-minded and sensible man in Europe\r\nwho has not endeavoured to help the good angel and defeat the efforts of\r\nthe wicked tempter.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the Imperial Government was wrong in not accepting the\r\nwithdrawal of the candidateship of the Prince of Hohenzollern; a withdrawal\r\nannounced by the Prince himself, accepted by the King of Prussia, and\r\naccepted and officially communicated to France by the Spanish Government.\r\nThis was held to be insufficient satisfaction for France, though I think\r\nneither necessity nor prudence called for a second demand, which offended\r\nthe pride of all parties; and the manner in which it was rejected has\r\ndestroyed the last chance of peace. Till that moment, the good angel had\r\nprevailed; but now the bad angel is speaking. But if there is one man in\r\nEurope who cannot avail himself of this blunder to rid himself of the\r\nresponsibility of war, that man is surely the tempter of 1868....\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_Ballachulish, August 14th_.--As it is entirely to you that we owe our\r\nresidence in this enchanting place, it would be very ungrateful not to tell\r\nyou how much we are enjoying it. I think it is by far the most picturesque\r\nspot in all Scotland; and ever since we arrived, ten days ago, the sea has\r\nbeen as blue as the Aegean, and the hills as clear as the isles of Greece.\r\nNot one cloud or shower in ten days, but the heat so great that we find\r\nshooting arduous work. There is not much game, but I am better off than\r\nmost of my neighbours, who complain loudly. I think I can insure any day\r\nfive or six brace. It certainly is not a good year, nor is this a grouse\r\ncountry.... I think, whatever else this war may bring about, it has\r\nfinished the Empire and the Emperor, and so far I rejoice; but I confess I\r\nhave no sympathy at all with the Prussians.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, September 10th_.--I am just up, my dear Sir, having been in\r\nbed for a fortnight. Grief and indignation are unhealthy at eighty-three. I\r\nam better, and only wish I was as sure of the convalescence of France as of\r\nmy own. It is true that France has before her more time for recovery than I\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nI will say nothing of the fallen Empire. I should say more than is seemly\r\nand less than is true. Never was fall more deserved, more necessary, and\r\nmore absolute.\r\n\r\nNeither will I say anything of the new Government. It is what it professes\r\nto be, a power pledged to defend the country. A national constituent\r\nAssembly has just been convoked, and meanwhile everything will be done to\r\npreserve the honour and integrity of France. This, for the present, is the\r\none idea and the one passion of the whole country, especially of Paris. I\r\nhope that the deeds will correspond to the passion.\r\n\r\nThere are two points on which, in spite of my present weakness, I wish\r\nto give you my opinion at once, so as to awaken your interest, and the\r\ninterest of all the friends of European order and of France now in England.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be regretted in the general policy of Europe since 1815.\r\nMany faults have been committed which might have been avoided, many\r\nimprovements which might have been made have been miscalculated or have\r\npassed as dreams. But throughout this age, and for more than half a\r\ncentury, rising above all faults and blunders, royal or popular,\r\ndiplomatic or parliamentary, one great and novel fact has dominated the\r\npolicy of Europe--there has been no question of a war of ambition and of\r\nconquest; no State has attempted to aggrandise itself by force at the\r\nexpense of other States; [Footnote: Guizot's enthusiasm or patriotism here\r\nled him into a somewhat reckless assertion. In point of fact, there was\r\nnot one of the great Continental Powers which, during the previous fifty\r\nyears, had not 'attempted to aggrandise itself by force,' and,\r\nnecessarily, 'at the expense of other States.' With the exception of\r\nAustria, they had done more than 'attempt'--they had effected the\r\naggrandisement.] respect for peace and the law of nations has become a\r\nruling maxim of international policy. When internal revolution in any\r\nState has rendered territorial changes necessary, these changes have been\r\nrecognised and accepted only after the examination and consent of Europe.\r\nBelgium and Greece have taken rank as European States only by the putting\r\non one side all the yearnings of French, Russian, or English ambition. And\r\nwhen, in 1844 and 1848, the Emperor Nicholas, in his familiar interviews\r\nwith your ambassador at St. Petersburg, proposed that Russia and England\r\nshould act in concert, and by joint conquest, as he said, put an end to\r\nthe decrepitude of the Ottoman Empire, two English ministers, Lord\r\nAberdeen and Lord John Russell, to their great honour, rejected any such\r\nidea, as an outrage on the law of nations, and the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in affirming, my dear Sir, that this is the greatest\r\nand most salutary feature of the first half of this century, and has\r\ncontributed more than anything else to the revival of principles of equity\r\nand justice in the relations between governments and their people, to\r\nthe increased prosperity of different nations, and to the progress of\r\ncivilisation in the world. And, new as its rule yet is, this fact has been\r\nsufficient to stop, or at least to check in their evil developements, the\r\nnoxious germs of an ambitious and violent policy, revivified in Europe\r\nby the revolutionary crises of 1848. Temptations have certainly not been\r\nwanting to governments and parties since that date. But in 1848 the French\r\nRepublic respected the peace of Europe and the law of nations; in 1852 the\r\nFrench Empire hastened to declare that it was peace; and when, leaving\r\nthat, she threw herself into the Italian war, is it credible that she would\r\nhave been contented with Nice and Savoy as the price of the support she\r\ngave to the Italians if she had not been restrained by the good modern\r\nprinciple of European policy, the condemnation of the spirit of ambition\r\nand conquest? [Footnote: Not to speak of the chance of having to deal with\r\nPrussia. Cf. _ante_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nIt is this legitimate and guiding principle which is at present ignored,\r\nattacked, and in great danger. I have no intention of entering here upon\r\nthe question of German unity, or of inquiring how far the consequences of\r\nSadowa are to be attributed to the real and spontaneous effort of national\r\nsentiment amongst the Germans. I waive all discussion on this point.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose anyone will say that in this great German event Prussian\r\nambition had no share, or that force and conquest did not act side by side\r\nwith the impulse of national sentiment. But I do not now meddle with what\r\nhas been done in Germany; that has nothing in common with the present\r\npretensions of Prussia to Alsace and Lorraine. Have these provinces given\r\nany manifestation, any appearance, of a desire to be included in the German\r\nunity? Is not the Prussian policy in this openly and exclusively a policy\r\nof ambition and of conquest, such as would have been followed, from more or\r\nless specious motives of royal or national selfishness, by Louis XIV. in\r\nthe seventeenth, by Frederick II. in the eighteenth, by Napoleon I. in the\r\nnineteenth century? such as the modern publicists and moralists have so\r\noften condemned and fought against? such, in fine, as all nations, in all\r\nages--and especially Europe in our own times--have so cruelly suffered\r\nfrom? I say no more. I should be ashamed to insist upon what is so clear.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to do with Utopian ideas. I do not believe in perpetual\r\npeace, nor in the absolute rule of the law of nations as affecting the\r\nrivalries of governments and the facts of history. I know that ambitious\r\nintrigue and violent enterprise will always have a part in the destinies of\r\nnations. I only ask that ambition and force shall not be permitted to take\r\nthat part, controlled only by their own will. At least they ought to be\r\nrecognised for what they are, and called by their right names; their\r\nclaims, and the results of them, ought to be placed face to face with the\r\npolicy of peace and the law of nations; and, lastly, it ought not to be\r\nforgotten that this, the only durable and good policy, has prevailed in\r\nEurope for half a century, and that it would be shameful and unfortunate to\r\nallow it to fall undefended before the first success of the old policy of\r\nambition and conquest.\r\n\r\nIn the severe and dangerous trial which she is now undergoing, France may\r\nstrengthen herself with the thought that her present and personal policy\r\nis in exact agreement with the European policy of peace and the law of\r\nnations. France has no ambition, no remote designs or secret aim; she asks\r\nfor nothing; she is defending her rights, her honour, and her territory.\r\nWill the Powers, who have hitherto proclaimed their neutrality, assist\r\nher by assisting to maintain the European policy of peace and the law of\r\nnations? I shall be surprised if they do not, the more so as they could\r\ndo it without seriously compromising themselves. If their intervention by\r\nforce of arms were necessary, it would undoubtedly be at once effective;\r\nbut any such necessity is quite out of the question; the neutral Powers are\r\nstronger than they themselves are perhaps aware, and their moral strength\r\nis amply sufficient. Let them plainly assert their disapproval of this\r\nattack on the territorial integrity of France; and in support of their\r\ndisapproval, let them declare that, in any case, they will not recognise\r\nany change in the territory of France which France herself will not accept.\r\nIt is my deep and firm conviction that this would be sufficient to put an\r\nend to any such attempt, and to check the policy of ambition and conquest,\r\nwithout which the peace of Europe cannot be re-established. Is France to be\r\nleft alone to sustain this great and good cause at all risks? or will the\r\nneutral Powers, without any great risk to themselves, give her such support\r\nas will ensure her triumph? It is for the Powers to answer this question. I\r\nam very old to be surprised at anything; and yet I should be surprised if\r\nEngland did not see the greatness of the part she is called upon to play\r\nunder existing circumstances. For many years she sustained in Europe, by\r\nwar, the policy of respect for the laws of nations; will she not uphold it\r\nto-day by peace?\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, je suis fatigué. Je vais me coucher, et tout à vous,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\nShould you think proper to make any use of this letter, either by privately\r\nshowing it to anyone, or by giving it a wider publicity, I have no\r\nobjection. I leave the question of fitness and opportunity in England to\r\nyou. For my part, my only wish is that my opinions and sentiments in this\r\nimportant crisis should be well known both in France and England.\r\n\r\nThe following note is endorsed by Reeve 'Due d'Aumale on the capitulation\r\nof Sedan,' which took place on September 2nd. It is, however, impossible to\r\nsuppose that the Due d'Aumale did not hear of an event so astounding till\r\nthree weeks after it had happened, and the note probably refers more\r\nimmediately to the occupation of Versailles by the Prussians under the\r\nCrown Prince, on September 20th, or the reported arrival on the 23rd of\r\nGeneral Bourbaki at Chislehurst, to consult with the Empress about the\r\nsurrender of Metz. The endorsement was most likely written some time\r\nafterwards, and in momentary forgetfulness of the date.\r\n\r\n_From the Due d'Aumale_\r\n\r\nOrleans House, 23 septembre.\r\n\r\nCher Monsieur,---Jamais je n'aurais cru que je vivrais assez pour voir un\r\npareil jour. Vous devinez tout ce que mon coeur éprouve.\r\n\r\nVous êtes du bien petit nombre de ceux avec qui il m'est possible de causer\r\nen ce moment, et vous me ferez du bien si vous venez déjeuner ici dimanche\r\nprochain, 25, à midi 1/2. Mille amitiés,\r\n\r\nH. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Granville_\r\n\r\nWalmer Castle, October 2nd.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I was very sorry to miss an opportunity of seeing you twice\r\nlast week. Our hours are late, while you adopt the judicious maxim of\r\nCharles Lamb. I thought the article [Footnote: Gladstone's article (see\r\n_ante_, p.178) which was published in the October number of the _Review_.\r\nLord Granville saw the proof slips.] excellent and very instructive; not\r\nalways quite judicial. It will be read with immense pleasure on its own\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nAs far as we have gone we have surely adhered to the declaration made to\r\nParliament--'Neutrality, with as friendly relations as is compatible with\r\nimpartiality; exercise of the duties and maintenance of our rights, as\r\nneutrals.' We have protected Belgium with minimum risk to ourselves. We\r\nhave given advice when it was acceptable and effective, such as that which\r\nled to the meeting of Favre and Bismarck. We have not obtruded advice when\r\nit would have been impotent excepting for harm. We hae reserved complete\r\nliberty of action for any contingency. All the neutral nations have been\r\nat our feet, anxious to know what we would do, professing to be ready to\r\nfollow our example. One of the belligerents has already come to us for\r\nassistance. Those who think we have done nothing of course consider it an\r\neasy and inglorious task; but it requires a little firmness to resist not\r\nonly the complaints of belligerents and the cajoleries of neutrals, but\r\nalso the changeable gusts of public opinion at home. Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, October 2nd._--I understand you, my dear Sir; 'you' meaning\r\nyour Cabinet. You want to see if France will defend herself energetically\r\nenough, obstinately enough, to warrant the neutral Powers saying to\r\nthe Prussians, 'What you attempt is impossible; you are stirring up an\r\ninterminable contest, which is becoming an evil and a peril for Europe.'\r\nUntil that moment comes, your Cabinet does not think that the intervention\r\nof the neutral Powers in favour of peace could be effective.\r\n\r\nMany reasons, some good, some plausible, may be adduced in support of\r\na waiting policy. But take care! it often aggravates the questions it\r\npostpones. Consider what is actually taking place at the present moment.\r\nPrussia puts forward her claims more and more distinctly; France is\r\nexasperated and rejects them more and more positively. You can have no\r\nidea of the effect produced throughout France by the conversation of M. de\r\nBismarck with M. Jules Favre. Bismarck, indeed, seems to have some\r\nnotion of it, for he attempts to extenuate what he said or allowed to be\r\nunderstood. Evidently the result of this interview has been to leave the\r\nbelligerents mutually more embittered than they were before; and the\r\nintervention of the neutral Powers at the present time is thus rendered\r\nmore difficult.\r\n\r\nI now put this incident on one side, and am going to the root of the\r\nmatter. You want to see if France will defend herself energetically\r\nand obstinately. Look at what she has done already. The Prussians have\r\ncertainly obtained great successes. They have beaten two of our regular\r\narmies. At this moment they are before Paris. Is Paris terror-struck?\r\nDo the Prussians enter it? I am not trusting to child's talk and vulgar\r\nboasting. My son William, and my son-in-law Cornelis de Witt, are now\r\nboth in Paris, both in the National Guard, both clever, sensible men, not\r\ncredulous, not given to boasting, and good judges of what is going on\r\naround them. They both write that Paris is able and determined to defend\r\nitself obstinately. And among the most cautious of my friends, those who\r\ndoubted it at first are now of the same opinion as my sons. By the last\r\nballoon from Paris I received a letter, dated September 21st, from a\r\nsimple, obscure citizen. He writes:--'Our Paris, bristling with bayonets,\r\nis a splendid sight; perfect order, glowing patriotism, and a resolve to\r\nfight to the death. The insolence of Bismarck's reply to Jules Favre has\r\nenraged and electrified all hearts. The Prussians will pay dearly for their\r\nblunder in condemning us to heroism or despair. Yesterday was a good day;\r\nin two places, Villejuif and St. Denis, we attacked the Prussians and\r\ndefeated them.'\r\n\r\nI do not know if this degree of ardour and confidence is to be accepted\r\nas general. I quote it as an illustration of the feeling in Paris on\r\nthe seventh day of the siege. The fighting is at present round the\r\nfortifications; later on it will be on the ramparts, and then in the\r\nstreets. First the detached forts; then the _enceinte_; then the\r\nbarricades. And when it comes to these--if it ever gets so far--independent\r\nof the organised forces of all kinds, there will be the populace, the Paris\r\nmob, intelligent and bold men, who fight well on the barricades for the\r\nvery fun of it.\r\n\r\nHow long will this defence of Paris last? I do not know, and am not going\r\nto prophesy. But what I do know, what I hear from all sides, is that it\r\nwill last long enough to excite a patriotic and warlike sentiment through\r\nthe whole land. France is not peopled with heroes; there are the bold and\r\nthe timid, as in every other country; but there are heroes enough--and\r\nothers will arise--to keep the nation in a state of fever, and consequently\r\nEurope in a state of alarm inconsistent with true peace, with the\r\nprosperity of the nations and the security of European order.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians, and, as I am told, Bismarck himself, have reckoned, and are\r\nperhaps still reckoning, on our internal dissensions and quarrels, kept\r\nalive by the traditions and the hopes of the old parties. It is a natural\r\nerror, but made in complete ignorance of the actual state of things.\r\nNational sentiment has overcome the old discord. One sole, universal and\r\nabsorbing passion dominates all parties--the passion of defending the\r\nsoil and honour of France. Two of the most illustrious Vendéens, MM. de\r\nCathelineau et Stofflet, have asked for and received from the Government\r\nan authorisation to assist them against the Prussians. MM. Rochefort and\r\nGustave Flourens, formerly the most ardent democrats, have joined the\r\ngovernment of General Trochu, and are preparing barricades, to maintain a\r\nfierce struggle against the besiegers at the gates and in the streets of\r\nParis, if it should ever be necessary.\r\n\r\n7 P.M.--My letter was interrupted by the arrival of the evening papers,\r\nand a letter from my daughter Pauline, dated September 25th, brought by a\r\nballoon. I copy the following, _verbatim_:--\r\n\r\n'After being on guard the day before yesterday, for twenty-six hours,\r\nwithout anything worse than repeated alarms, my husband and son returned\r\nand are somewhat rested. Yesterday we went to Montmartre--a very populous\r\nand stirring quarter. I cannot tell you often enough how well Paris is\r\nbehaving; enthusiasm and unanimity prevail everywhere; the good and the\r\nwise have silenced the fools. This will raise up France; it is a balm for\r\nmany sorrows. I can assure you the country is not demoralised. I do not\r\nknow how long the trial will last, but we shall be the better for it.'\r\n\r\nAdmit that if this conduct is maintained, if Paris--which in June 1848\r\nsuppressed the revolutionary anarchy in her own bosom--in 1870 stops a\r\nforeign invasion, and holds it at bay before her ramparts, it will be a\r\ngreat deed, worthy of esteem and sympathy. If in presence of such a fact,\r\nyour neutrality should continue cold and inert, the friends of European\r\npeace and of the good understanding between France and England would have\r\ngreat cause for astonishment. It is for this reason that I conjure England\r\nand her Government to give the matter their serious consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here gives a short sketch of a month's holiday:--\r\n\r\nOctober 12th.--Started for Ireland. Crossed in a gale. To Dunsany on the\r\n14th. 15th, drove with Lord Dunsany to Trim; saw the castle; Larachor,\r\nSwift's living; Dangan, now quite ruined; and back by Lord Longford's.\r\n17th, to Dartrey. Met the Verulams there, and Lady Meath. 21st, drove to\r\nCoote Hill fair. 24th, to Belfast and Clandeboye. Some days with Lord\r\nDufferin at Clandeboye. Professor Andrews came over from Belfast. 30th,\r\nback to Dublin to stay with Mansfield, who was now commander-in-chief\r\nin Ireland. Saw Lord Spencer--lord-lieutenant. November 1st, crossed to\r\nHolyhead and went to Teddesley, where Christine joined me. Back to town on\r\nthe 5th.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Stanhope_\r\n\r\n_Chevening, October 11th_.--I have been reading with much interest the\r\narticle on Queen Anne in the 'Edinburgh,' and I hope you will allow me to\r\nexpress to you how much I am gratified at the favourable view which it\r\ntakes of my performance. The reviewer and I, as I am glad to find,\r\noften agree in our views of men and things; and whenever we differ, our\r\ndifference is expressed in terms that cannot but give great pleasure to any\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer, in this case, has certainly one main advantage over some of\r\nmy other critics. They seem to have no knowledge of Queen Anne's reign\r\nexcept what my book imparted to them, and they therefore criticised my book\r\non its own merits or demerits alone. Here, on the contrary, the writer is,\r\nI see, most deeply versed in all the memoirs and published records of those\r\ntimes, which he can bring to bear with great effect upon any passage that\r\nhe desires either to controvert or to confirm.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me very forcibly, from my acquaintance with your style, that the\r\nwriter of this article is no other than yourself. [Footnote: The article\r\nwas by Herman Merivale (d. 1874).] If so, pray accept my sincere thanks; if\r\nnot, pray convey them from me to the critic unknown.\r\n\r\nLady Stanhope and I have been to North Wales and Devonshire, but settled at\r\nChevening ten or twelve days ago. From here we went without delay to call\r\nupon the Empress at Chislehurst; as indeed we were bound to do, having in\r\nformer years received great kindness from them, and been their guests for\r\na week at Compiègne. Nothing could be more touching and gracious than her\r\nmanner. She had tears in her eyes all the while we were with her, and her\r\nvoice was often choked by emotion; yet she did not let fall a single word\r\nof invective or personal reproach against her enemies in France. She told\r\nme that her first wish on reaching England had been to proceed with her\r\nson to the Emperor at Wilhelmshöhe; but on applying to the Prussian\r\nauthorities, she could obtain no assurance that she and her son should not\r\nbe treated as prisoners of war; and under these circumstances the Emperor\r\nforbade her to come.\r\n\r\nPoor, poor Paris! when shall you and I ever see it again?\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_Hinton, November 11th_. I kept myself free from engagements during the\r\nfirst three weeks of November, thinking I might be called on to do suit and\r\nservice at the Judicial Committee; but I have not made any provision for\r\nDecember, as I thought it was fully understood (certainly by me) at the end\r\nof last session, that, from the end of Michaelmas term until Christmas, the\r\nLords Justices would have charge of the Judicial Committee for the whole\r\nof each week, or certainly four days in every week. We calculated that the\r\nmost important business on the appeal side in Chancery would be so reduced\r\nby the two courts of appeal during Michaelmas term that the Lord Chancellor\r\nalone would suffice for all necessities during December. I have therefore\r\npostponed every engagement here until December. My house will be full; I\r\ncannot therefore give you any aid; but I am not sorry for it, for if the\r\narrears were at all reduced, _nothing would be done_ in the appointment\r\nof a permanent tribunal, with a proper staff of judges. You must still be\r\nAtlas staggering under the weight of your huge _Orbis Causarum_. Around\r\nyour feet must be millions of Hindoos, crying aloud for justice. It is only\r\nthis spectacle for gods and men that will move the Government to do its\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for me to attend if my establishment and family were\r\nin town. But if I promised you a fortnight in December, I must put off\r\nnumerous engagements and remove my servants, horses, &c., to London, only\r\nto bring them down again here for Christmas; or, at the risk of being ill\r\nas well as wretched, I must go to London alone, into a cold deserted house,\r\nwith the attendance at most of two female servants. No; you must get as\r\nmuch as you can out of the Lords Justices, who must begin the task of\r\nlearning Hindoo and Mahomedan law. Besides, if I disposed of twenty Indian\r\nappeals in December (a most unlikely thing), it would be the signal for\r\nadding forty more to the list, and so you would be more encumbered than\r\never. It is useless to make these poor spasmodic efforts. The thing must be\r\ndone effectually. You are hopelessly bankrupt, and the driblets of aid you\r\nsolicit will not enable you to stave off ruin.\r\n\r\nAn article by Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen on the 'Business of the House of\r\nCommons,' published in the 'Edinburgh Review' for January 1871, was\r\nsubmitted in proof to the Speaker, Mr. Denison, whose comments drew from\r\nthe writer the following reply:--\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. H. Knatchbull-Hugessen_ [Footnote: At this time\r\nunder-secretary of state for the Home Department: created Lord Brabourne in\r\n1880; died in 1893.]\r\n\r\n_Smeeth, November 23rd_.--The Speaker knows more than I do, if he knows\r\nthat it is an understood thing 'that a committee shall next session be\r\nappointed to consider the present mode of conducting the public business.'\r\nIt is not generally known; and I doubt the policy of alluding, in an\r\narticle which may be read by the public generally, to that which is only\r\nknown to a privileged few. You, however, must be the best judge, and of\r\ncourse I have no objection to insert a sentence or two of allusion to this\r\nfact (?) [Footnote: The (?) is Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's.] if you wish it;\r\nbut if pressing business--or war--postpones this committee, the 'Review'\r\nwill look rather foolish.\r\n\r\nWhen you say the article is 'rather too multifarious,' I quite agree that\r\nit might be condensed and curtailed. But even had I time to go through it\r\nagain with this intention, I frankly own that I should doubt the expediency\r\nof doing so. I wrote it _currente calamo_, and my object was to attack the\r\nexisting system upon many points at once, in order to carry some--just as\r\nan army besieging a town may make half a dozen attacks, of which three,\r\nbeing feints, give a better chance of success to the other three. You\r\nwill observe that I do sum up the four prominent points: 1, _clôture_; 2,\r\nlimitations of motions for adjournment; 3, public bill revision committee;\r\n4, restrictions upon counts-out.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with what the Speaker writes about our 'absurdly late hours.'\r\nI have no strong feeling upon the Wednesday question, and perhaps the\r\nSpeaker is right, although I think the point is alluded to in a manner not\r\ntoo strong nor too 'disparaging' to the fixed hour, as I only recommend\r\nthat a division, instead of an adjournment, either upon main question or\r\nadjournment, should take place compulsorily at the fixed hour.\r\n\r\nI return you the Speaker's letter. I don't know whether you could\r\nconveniently run down here on Saturday and spend a quiet Sunday. You would\r\nfind my wife and me alone, excepting Godfrey Lushington, who is coming to\r\ndiscuss highway bills. We could have a talk over the matter then. If you\r\ncannot manage it, write me word how you wish the article altered, and I\r\nwill do it. I confess, however, that I think, as a preliminary attack\r\nupon abuses which will require closer and more detailed grappling with\r\nhereafter, it had better not be much altered.\r\n\r\n_From the Queen of Holland_\r\n\r\nHague, December 26th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve, [Footnote: The Queen of Holland seems to have laid down\r\na somewhat curious rule in regard to her correspondence with Reeve: when\r\nshe was in Holland, she wrote to him in English; when she was in England,\r\nshe wrote in French.]--Your most interesting letter reached me a few days\r\nago. Ever since, I have been trying to get some of the papers relating to\r\nthe Luxembourg question; however, the one enclosed is the only one I have\r\nbeen able to obtain. Such is the fear of the kingdom of the Netherlands\r\nto be involved in any of the impending Luxembourg difficulties, that\r\neverything relating to that part of the world is scrupulously ignored; and\r\nif the papers are not claimed at Luxembourg, where the most jealous of men,\r\nPrince Henry, governs, you cannot obtain the real truth. The fact is, Mr.\r\nde Bismarck _a cherché une querelle d'Allemand_, first to obtain a free\r\npassage through the Luxembourg railroads; in the future, to annex the\r\nlittle grand duchy, to close the frontier on that side entirely.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is still kept for a few months hence, as Mr. de B. would not\r\nbe put quite on the same line with Prince Gortschakoff, though they are\r\nperfectly of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad time, a very bad symptom, when principles, engagements,\r\ntreaties, are all _à la merci_ of two or three unscrupulous men.\r\n\r\nForgive the haste in which I am compelled to write, this time of the year\r\nbeing particularly busy. Remember me kindly to Mrs. Reeve, and believe me,\r\ndear Mr. Reeve, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nSOPHIA.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here has:--\r\n\r\nThe French artists being driven over by the war, Millais gave a dinner, on\r\nDecember 20th, to Gérôme and Heilbuth--interesting. I took Gérôme to see\r\nHerbert's Moses in the House of Lords, but it was invisible from a fog.\r\n\r\nWe all dined with Lady Molesworth on Christmas Day, and ended the year with\r\nthe Van de Weyers at New Lodge.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3rd, 1871.--We had a small dinner to Sir William Mansfield and Lord\r\nElcho. On the 5th to Aldermaston (Higford Burr), with Bruce, [Footnote:\r\nAfterwards Lord Aberdare.] Colvile, [Frank Buckland], &c.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sybel was not one of Reeve's frequent correspondents, and the\r\nfollowing extract is from the only letter of his which has been preserved,\r\nprobably the only one ever written. The primary cause of it was some\r\ntrifling business connected with the exchange of publications--the\r\n'Edinburgh Review' and Sybel's 'Historische Zeitschrift;' but, having\r\nsettled that, the course of events tempted him, as a German and an\r\nhistorian, to continue.\r\n\r\n_From Professor von Sybel_\r\n\r\nBonn, January 9th.\r\n\r\nHochgeehrter Herr,--... What a change in our circumstances since I had last\r\nthe pleasure of seeing you! To us, Germans, it would often appear as a\r\ndream, did not our sacrifices and our efforts bring the reality vividly\r\nbefore us. The desire for a speedy conclusion of the war is general; but, I\r\nam proud to say, no less general is the determination to fight and to bleed\r\ntill we have brought it to a satisfactory issue. We are resolved not to be\r\nattacked again as we were in July, and on that account we will move our\r\nfrontier to the Vosges. We will fight until the French acknowledge us as\r\nhaving rights and position equal to their own, till the organs of their\r\nGovernment cease from their New Year animadversion, such as the 'Siècle'\r\nhas published, and we will crush everyone who calls in question our place\r\nas one of the Great Powers of Europe; and in thus rooting out this boast of\r\nsupremacy, we believe we are earning the gratitude of all Europe.\r\n\r\nHochachtungsvoll und ergebenst\r\n\r\nH. v. SYBEL.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, January 16th._--I received the 'Edinburgh Review' yesterday,\r\nand read your article at once. It is excellent--the language of a profound\r\nobserver, and of a true friend of France. There are pages I should like\r\nall my countrymen at all able to understand them to learn by heart, among\r\nothers from these words (p. 22): 'The life of man is so short,' to these:\r\n'the collective strength of a nation may be sensibly diminished by it.' You\r\nhave here laid your finger on the great evil of our democracy: 'It readily\r\nsacrifices the past and the future to what is supposed to be the interest\r\nof the present.' If I were in Paris, I should like to have a translation of\r\nnearly the whole article [Footnote: 'France,' in the _Review_ for January\r\n1871. The article was republished in _Royal and Revolutionary France_, with\r\nthe title 'France in 1871.'] published in our newspapers. But I am not\r\nthere; the Prussian shells go in my stead.\r\n\r\nI am told that the opening of your Parliament is fixed for February 8th. I\r\nwill wait until you can let me know this with certainty, and will then send\r\nyou the letter I mentioned. But I must beg you not to forward it to its\r\naddress till my translator--Miss Martin--reports to you that it is ready.\r\nIt seems to me very desirable that the translation should be published as\r\nsoon as the letter itself has been delivered. I understand that, on this\r\ncondition, the 'Times' will give the whole of it, which will ensure it\r\nthe widest possible publicity in England, where its publicity is the most\r\nimportant. The French edition will not appear till after the translation\r\nhas been published in the 'Times.'\r\n\r\n_From the Queen of Holland_\r\n\r\nHague, January 17th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I have received your letter. I have received the\r\n'Edinburgh Review.' I did not glance over the pages, I read and re-read\r\nthem; and I thank you for the real enjoyment they have afforded me. True in\r\nthought, admirable in expression, there can be but one judgement on both\r\nyour articles, and I will certainly endeavour to have them translated into\r\nDutch, to spread the truth. Allow me only to regret the great severity with\r\nwhich you treat the fallen Empire. I put aside every personal feeling, but\r\nI remain convinced that posterity will be more lenient in judgement than\r\nthe present in the raging storm. There were faults in the system, inherent\r\nand inherited. As to the head of the system, few men have been more\r\nnaturally kind and good. He had the weakness of these natures--wishing to\r\ncontent everyone. No question of principle seemed to him worthy of the\r\ninestimable enjoyment of peace. Avec les différents partis il se laissait\r\naller à des paroles, à des engagements contradictoires; de là une apparence\r\nde dissimulation, bien éloignée de sa nature. The prisoner of Wilhelmshöhe\r\nbelongs to the past. To those that have known and loved him falls the task\r\nof obtaining justice for him. I cannot talk of the present events, of the\r\ndestruction of Paris. I bow my head and I hope in God's justice.\r\n\r\nWill you remember me kindly to Mrs. Reeve? and believe me, with real\r\ngratitude, truly and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nSOPHIA.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, February 7th._--I have received from Mr. Gladstone a letter\r\ndated January 30th, as friendly as possible towards myself, but vague and\r\nevasive in respect to the policy of the Cabinet in the present situation.\r\nNot only does he postpone every measure, every indication of his intentions\r\ntill after the election and the opening of the National Assembly, which is\r\nvery natural, but he gives no hint as to how far his Government will insist\r\nrespecting the conditions of peace. It is, of course, impossible for me to\r\nargue the point with him--such a discussion would be unbecoming both on\r\nhis part and mine. I understand his reserve, but I can neither accept the\r\nreasons for it nor its results. It is therefore to you that I address my\r\nfurther observations in support of my letter of January 18th, begging you\r\nto communicate them to Mr. Gladstone, who will quite understand why I do\r\nnot address them to himself. I should also be glad to know if he would\r\nobject to the publication of his letter of January 30th, and of that which\r\nI am now sending you? For my part I wish this publicity, in both England\r\nand France; but I will not authorise it without his approval.\r\n\r\nIf this should be agreed on, pray let me know your opinion as to publishing\r\nit in the 'Times.' I am sure that, in this case, Miss Martin would\r\nundertake the translation.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_February 18th_--Pleasant dinner at Mansfields', though Mansfield himself\r\nwas carried off by the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--Dinner at Lord Granville's, to meet the Duc de Broglie, who came\r\nas ambassador.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\n_Val Richer, March 4th_.--Your sad predictions were well founded; the\r\npainful abscission has been made; we bore it at least with good sense and\r\ndignity. Without discussion or delay, the National Assembly has accepted\r\nthe peace imposed upon it; and the population of Paris left the Prussian\r\ncorps to parade through one single quarter of the town in solitude and\r\nsilence. The Prussians have not seen Paris, and Paris did not go to see the\r\nPrussians. Their triumph had no spectators. Their present policy is one\r\nmore example, after so many others, of the insolent and blind folly of\r\nvictors who sow the seeds of war at the moment they are making peace. You\r\ncan have no idea of the passionate sentiment of sorrow and anger which\r\nfills the soul of France, in all classes and in every part of the country.\r\nIt is impossible to say when and under what form the future will mark this\r\nfeeling, but it is written. One cannot tire of repeating the last words of\r\nthe Chancellor Oxenstiern to his son when starting for the tour through\r\nEurope: 'Ito mi fili et inspice quam parvâ sapientiâ mundus regitur' ...\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_March 16th_.--Dinner at home to the Duc de Broglie, the Dartreys, Mintos,\r\nHoughton, and Lady Molesworth.\r\n\r\n_April 1st_.--Went to Draycott on a visit to the Cowleys. The Lavalettes\r\nthere and the old Duchess of Cleveland. Went on to Bath to try the waters\r\nthere. Bath, however, did no good to the gout, of which I had, all this\r\nspring, repeated attacks. Saw Wells Cathedral, Glastonbury, and Longleat.\r\nOver to Bristol, and then back to town on April 15th.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the siege of Paris ended and peace signed, than the frightful\r\ninsurrection of the Commune broke out in Paris; the city was for many\r\nweeks in complete possession of the mob; Thiers and the army retired on\r\nVersailles, and recommenced the siege of Paris by French troops. The\r\nArchbishop and other hostages were murdered, and at last the city was set\r\non fire. Nothing even in the First Revolution equalled the madness of this\r\nperiod. What a curious contrast to the even tenour of London life! I find\r\nin my diaries no trace of these tremendous catastrophes.\r\n\r\n_May 1st_.--International Art Exhibition opened. I went in my doctor's\r\nrobes and orders; the only time I ever wore them.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\nVal Richer, 4 juin.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--La destruction a atteint son terme, l'oeuvre de\r\nreconstruction commence. Elle sera très difficile, mais je n'en désespère\r\npas, et j'y prendrai quelque part sans sortir de ma cellule. Quelle vie que\r\nla mienne! Mon plus ancien souvenir politique est d'avoir vu de loin, du\r\nhaut d'une terrasse de la petite maison de campagne où ma mère s'était\r\nréfugiée pendant la Terreur, en 1794, les Jacobins poursuivis et assommés\r\npar la réaction contre Robespierre au 9 thermidor. La scène se passait sur\r\nles boulevards de Nismes. J'assiste en 1871, de la campagne aussi, à la\r\nchûte des nouveaux Jacobins, vrais héritiers et élèves de la Terreur. Et\r\nque n'ai-je pas vu, en fait d'événement, dans cet intervalle de 77 ans!\r\n\r\nSur ce je vous dis adieu. Je me porte assez bien, malgré mes 83 ans et ces\r\nspectacles Shakspeariens. La France est, depuis 1789, une immense tragedie\r\nde Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nTout à vous,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\nReverting to the Journal:--\r\n\r\nMr. Grote died on June 18th. I attended the funeral in Westminster Abbey on\r\nthe 24th. John Mill and Overstone were among the pall-bearers.\r\n\r\nAt The Club dinner, on June 20th, the Duc d'Aumale took leave of us before\r\nreturning to France. There were present: the Lord Chancellor (Hatherley),\r\nMaster of the Rolls [Romilly], Duke of Cleveland, Lord Salisbury, Lord\r\nDerby, Sir H. Holland, Dean Stanley, W. Smith, and self.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Lord\r\nRipon, then Lord President, had asked them to make me a K.C.B., but\r\nGladstone wrote me word that it was a rule that men should pass through the\r\nthird grade to arrive at the second. [Footnote: That there was such a rule\r\nhas been very fully proved by numerous exceptions.] Arthur Helps and\r\nWilliam Stephenson were made C.B.'s at the same time, and afterwards\r\nK.C.B.'s. I was gazetted a C.B. on June 30th.\r\n\r\nThe following from Lord Granville refers to a conversation in the House of\r\nLords on the constitution of the Appellate Court of the Judicial Committee.\r\nThe Marquis of Salisbury had said that in his opinion it should be a court\r\nof fixed constitution.\r\n\r\nAt present it was often difficult to discover who were the judges in the\r\nparticular case. He believed the President of the Council in every case\r\nappointed the judges; but, as he understood, it was practically done by\r\na gentleman for whom all had the greatest respect, Mr. Henry Reeve, the\r\nRegistrar. This did not seem a satisfactory state of things for a tribunal\r\ndealing with matters which excited people's passions and feelings to\r\nthe highest degree, and on which parties were angrily divided. Nobody\r\nconversant with the matter could harbour the unworthy suspicion that\r\nthe Court was ever packed for the trial of a particular case--he had no\r\napprehensions on that score; but it was because the action and constitution\r\nof the Court should be above all suspicion that he would urge the noble and\r\nlearned lord on the woolsack to provide some fixed constitution, so that\r\nthe Court should not be constituted afresh for each particular case it had\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\nLord Granville replied in the sense of his letter to Reeve, except that he\r\nsaid 'Mr. Reeve invariably consulted _the Lord President_, who, on some\r\noccasions, called a Cabinet Council.' The Lord President at that time was\r\nthe Marquis of Ripon. Granville was followed by Lord Cairns, who said:--\r\n\r\nHe could testify from considerable experience to the way in which Mr. Reeve\r\nperformed his duties. The fact was that there was a great unwillingness\r\nto attend, and undergo the great labour and responsibility of hearing\r\nimportant cases. Mr. Reeve, knowing this, and having an earnest desire\r\nto perform the duties of his office effectively--no public officer could\r\ndischarge them better--was in the habit of making himself acquainted with\r\nthe arrangements of those who might be expected to attend, with a view--not\r\nto decide who ought to attend to hear particular cases--but as to whose\r\nservices were obtainable, in order that some kind of Court might be\r\nconstituted.... It ought to be understood that no person had any power of\r\nselecting some and excluding others, and that the Registrar's endeavour to\r\nprocure the attendance of individuals had merely arisen from anxiety lest\r\nthere should be no quorum. [Footnote: Hansard, 1871, June 22nd, cols.\r\n389-91.]\r\n\r\n_From Lord Granville_\r\n\r\n16 _Bruton Street, June 23rd_.--I see the report in the 'Times' is\r\ndefective. I stated that the Lord President was undoubtedly responsible for\r\nall that you did. I paid a high tribute to your services to the Judicial\r\nCommittee (which was cheered by the law lords); I said the difficulty was\r\noften great to collect sufficient members to attend; that you took great\r\npains, by ascertaining the wishes and possible dates, to ensure this; that\r\nfor ordinary meetings of the Court you acted on your own judgement; but\r\nthat in all cases where there was a possibility of party or personal\r\nfeeling being made a cause of want of confidence in the composition of the\r\nCourt, you had always consulted me; and I had, on some occasions, not only\r\nconsulted the Home Office, but the Cabinet, in order to do that which would\r\nensure public confidence. I should not be sorry if you could show that I\r\nwas not in the wrong. I was delighted to hear of your C.B. None could be\r\nmore deserved.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_July 7th_.--I dined with Mrs. Grote; one of the first persons she saw\r\nafter Grote's death.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--A banquet was given at the Crystal Palace to the members of the\r\nComédie Française, who had been driven over to London by the siege of Paris\r\nand the Commune.\r\n\r\nThis 'banquet' was of the nature of a lunch, beginning at two o'clock.\r\nLord Dufferin was in the chair, supported by Lords Granville, Stanhope,\r\nPowerscourt, Lytton, Houghton, Mr. Disraeli, Tennyson, Macready, and\r\nothers. When 'the desire of eating was taken away,' the chairman, speaking\r\nin French, proposed the health of the guests. M. Got responded. Horace\r\nWigan, too, spoke; and Lord Granville, 'whose fluent command of extempore\r\nFrench excited general admiration,' gave 'The Health of the Chairman,' and,\r\nwith a neat reference to the 'Letters from High Latitudes,' then 14, not\r\n41 years old, said: 'L'accueil que vous avez donné à son discours doit\r\nrassurer Lord Dufferin et lui faire même oublier les succès oratoires\r\nque--Latiniste incomparable, et voué au purisme Cicéronien--il a obtenus\r\ndans les régions plus septentrionales.' To this chaff Lord Dufferin replied\r\nin English: 'Lord Granville has been good enough to allude to what he is\r\npleased to describe as an oratorical triumph in a distant country; and I\r\nwould venture to remind you--and you may take the word of an experienced\r\nperson in confirmation of what I am about to say--that when anybody wishes\r\nto make a speech in a foreign language, he will find it much more easy to\r\ndo so after dinner than at an early hour in the morning.'\r\n\r\nFor Reeve this wound up the season. A few days later, July 23rd, he, with\r\nhis wife, started for Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GREVILLE MEMOIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. de Mussy had recommended Reeve to drink the water at Carlsbad, so to\r\nCarlsbad they went, and stayed there twenty-four days. The manner of life\r\nat Carlsbad may be very wholesome, but no one has ever ventured to speak\r\nof it as jovial. The Reeves thought it 'dull enough,' and left it with a\r\nfeeling of release, on August 23rd. On the 24th they were at Dresden,\r\nand reached home on September 3rd. And then came a curious reaction; a\r\ndisagreeable experience of the Carlsbad treatment. 'Henry,' wrote Mrs.\r\nReeve a few days later, 'who had been quite well and quite free from gout\r\nall the time, had a tendency thereto on leaving Hamburg, which, on landing\r\nat Gravesend, was a sharp attack in the right hand. He cannot hold a\r\npen.... His doctor and some fellow-patients all say that after Carlsbad\r\nwaters such attacks are frequent, and that they in no way imply that the\r\nwaters did not suit.' The Journal goes on:--\r\n\r\n_September 16th_.--To Gorhambury [Lord Verulam's] with Christine. On\r\nleaving the house on the 18th to go to the station, the horse in the fly\r\nran away. We were overturned near the park gates, and had a narrow escape.\r\nNobody was hurt, and we drove on [in another fly] to Lord Ebury's at Moor\r\nPark.\r\n\r\n_October 2nd_.--To Scotland on a visit to Moncreiff at Cultoquhey; thence\r\nto Minard (Mr. Pender's) on Loch Fyne; thence to Edinburgh; Ormiston on\r\nthe 21st; the John Stanleys there and Lord Neaves. [Footnote: A lord of\r\njusticiary, one of the foremost authorities on criminal law in Scotland,\r\nand for more than forty years a regular contributor of prose and verse to\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_.] Lady Ruthven to dinner.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--To Auchin, and home on the 28th.\r\n\r\nA bill had passed at the close of the last session for the appointment of\r\nfour paid members of the Privy Council. They were Sir James Colvile, Sir\r\nBarnes Peacock, Sir Montague Smith, and Sir Robert Collier. These judges\r\nbegan to sit on November 6th of this year. The Court, from that time, sat\r\ncontinuously. I obtained an additional clerk, and also an addition of 300 £\r\na year to my own salary, which was fixed at 1,500 £.\r\n\r\nPleasant visit to New Lodge (Van de Weyer's) in November. Shooting at Lithe\r\nHill in December.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales's serious illness. He very nearly died on December 6th.\r\n\r\n_December 20th_.--The Broglies dined with us, to meet Beust and the\r\nForesters.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Mrs. Forester asked us, at my desire, to meet Disraeli and Lady\r\nBeaconsfield, at a small party. There was nobody else there but Lord and\r\nLady Colville. It was very interesting and agreeable.\r\n\r\n1872.--The year opened in Paris, where I had gone after Christmas; the\r\nfirst time I had been there since the war. M. Thiers was President of the\r\nRepublic. I went to Versailles to see him on January 3rd, and found him in\r\nthe Préfecture--the room that had been occupied just before by the German\r\nEmperor. M. Lesseps was there that evening, and we returned to Paris\r\ntogether. He and his friends were apparently very anxious to sell the Suez\r\nCanal. I dined with Thiers on the 6th also.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers's conversation on the war, the Commune and the siege was very\r\ninteresting. He said to me: 'Certainement je suis pour la République! Sans\r\nla République qu'est-ce que je serais, moi?--bourgeois, Adolphe Thiers.' He\r\ndescribed the withdrawal of the troops from Paris, which was his own act.\r\nThen the siege, which he claims to have directed, the battery of Mouton\r\nTout, adding, 'Nous avons enterré, en entrant à Paris, vingt mille\r\ncadavres.'\r\n\r\nDined at Mme. Mohl's on the 5th with M. de Loménie and M. Chevreuil, who is\r\nabout eighty-five.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale had opened his house in the Faubourg St.-Honoré; reception\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_January 8th_.--Dined with the Economists to meet the Emperor of Brazil. I\r\nwas presented to him, and made a speech in French on the maintenance of the\r\ncommercial treaty, which was applauded. Back to London on the 9th.\r\n\r\nReeve had already proposed to Mr. Longman to publish a volume of his\r\narticles from the 'Edinburgh Review.' He now wrote to him:--\r\n\r\n_C.O., January 11th_.--I find that the French articles I wish to collect\r\nand publish amount to _twelve_. I enclose a list of them. They make about\r\n380 pages of the 'Edinburgh Review' form. How much will that make if\r\nprinted in a smaller form? The title of the volume is an important matter.\r\nI have thought of 'Royal and Republican France,' or 'A Cycle of French\r\nHistory;' but I may think of something better. If you will make the\r\narrangements, I shall be able to supply copy very soon. The introduction\r\ncan be printed afterwards, I suppose?\r\n\r\nI conclude you will publish on the half-profit plan, though my past\r\nexperience of that system does not lead me to regard it as the road to\r\nfortune. Of our military volume about 650 copies were sold, and Chesney and\r\nI made 2 £. 3_s_. 0_d_. apiece!\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Longman replied:--\r\n\r\n_From Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_January 14th_.--I will have the calculation made of the articles you\r\nmention. I conclude you would wish to print in the usual demy 8vo. form,\r\nlike Macaulay's Essays and all the other reprints from the 'E.R.'\r\n\r\nThe plan of a division of profits has been usual in such republications;\r\nand it seems peculiarly adapted to them, as neither the contributor nor\r\nthe publisher can republish separately without the consent of the other.\r\nWhether that plan of publication may be a road to fortune or not depends on\r\nthe demand for the book. I had once the satisfaction of paying 20,000 £ on\r\none year's account, on that principle, to Lord Macaulay. I certainly had\r\nno expectation of a fortune from the republication which produced you 2 £\r\n3_s_. 0_d_.; but had I purchased the right of separate publication for 100\r\n£, I hardly think you would have been satisfied that fortune should have so\r\nfavoured you at my expense. It seems to be the fashion to decry that mode\r\nof publication; but there will always be books that can be published on no\r\nother terms, unless at the cost and risk of the author.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_Hinton St. George, January 12th._--I am glad to find that you have\r\nreturned in safety from Paris with your oratorical honours [Footnote: Of\r\nthe French speech in Paris on the 8th.] rich upon you. I do not think that\r\neven Cicero ventured on making an oration in Greek, in Athens; but you have\r\ncharmed fastidious Paris with your pure accent and your classic French. I\r\nwas in despair when I found your eloquence imputed to another name; but I\r\nheard the error was so generally corrected that you may count on your fame\r\ndescending unchallenged to posterity.\r\n\r\nI should agree with you that Franco was to be despaired of, if France were\r\nto be considered as subject to ordinary rules. But she is, and has ever\r\nbeen, so anomalous, that ordinary moral reasoning from history is wholly\r\ninapplicable to her. At present, one would think she had reached the lowest\r\ndepth of moral degradation. She might be usefully touched to the quick,\r\nif she could only believe that she is becoming ridiculous in the eyes of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nNot that _we_ can expect a much better fate. When the Treaty of Washington\r\nwas published, I strove to awaken in the minds of several leading men a\r\nfull sense of its folly, and of the calamitous consequences that would be\r\nsure to follow from such an act of foolish, gratuitous submission; but I\r\nmade no impression; not even as to the absurdity of introducing new\r\nand ill-considered rules, and giving them a retrospective operation. I\r\nsucceeded with no one. I therefore concluded I must be in the wrong. Now,\r\nhowever, the American indictment bears testimony to the accuracy of my\r\nforebodings. I entreated Lord Granville not to permit the arbitration to go\r\non upon such a basis, which it was never intended that the reference should\r\ncover or include. It is a fraudulent attempt to extend the reference most\r\nunwarrantably; and if the arbitration is permitted to proceed on such a\r\nclaim, the consequences will be most disastrous. It is a sad spectacle to\r\nsee a once gallant and high-spirited nation submitting tamely to be thus\r\nbullied. If not firmly protested against, and resisted _in limine_, you\r\nwill have an award which England will repudiate with indignation; and war,\r\nthe fear of which has made us submit to these indignities, will be sure to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe relative attitudes of England and the United States in 1896 and 1897\r\nhave not materially differed from those of 1872. The policy which has been\r\npersistently followed by this country has not yet resulted in war, but it\r\nseems to many now, as it did to Lord Westbury then, extremely likely to do\r\nso. Peace between two such countries can only be assured when it rests on\r\nmutual respect and a community of interests. We may persuade ourselves\r\nthat, in the main, our true interests are identical; but the recent\r\ndiplomatic correspondence from the States does not tell of much respect.\r\n\r\nBut as to the point at issue in 1872, Reeve wrote in reply to Lord\r\nWestbury, about January 15th:--\r\n\r\nI agree very much with what you say of the Treaty of Washington, and have\r\nnever been able to prevail on myself to say a word in its favour. The\r\nresult is that the fate and honour of this country are placed in the hands\r\nof a Swiss and a Brazilian referee, neither of whom knows a word of the\r\nEnglish language! Lord Lyons told me so last week in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_January 22nd_.--Visit to the Archbishop of Canterbury at\r\nAddington--pleasant; but in going up from Croydon on the 23rd, I was nearly\r\nkilled by a runaway _hearse_, which struck my cab and knocked it over. I\r\nwas not hurt, but two accidents in a year made me nervous. [Footnote: See\r\nante, p. 201.]\r\n\r\n_From Mr. H. F. Chorley_\r\n\r\n18 Eaton Place West, February 8th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I send you what I have done _in re_ Hawthorne. I offer a\r\ncharacter rather than a review, proved by extracts; since had I gone on _in\r\nextenso_ I don't know where I should have stopped. Nothing but my strong\r\nwish to get my subject before the public could have made me carry out my\r\narticle, poor as it is, seeing that I have written it half a leaf at a\r\ntime, and with a weak, weary hand, the end of which will not impossibly be\r\npalsy. But I think as a character, when duly corrected, my work may not\r\ncome out amiss. Ever yours faithfully, HENRY F. CHORLEY.\r\n\r\n_Endorsed_--Chorley's last note. He died about a week afterwards [suddenly\r\non February 16th. The article had apparently not been finished, and was not\r\npublished].\r\n\r\nFrom the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_January 24th_.--Went to see the Sandhursts at Brighton, but gout came on\r\nworse, and I was ill for some weeks. I presided at The Club, however, on\r\nthe 27th, the Thanksgiving Day for the recovery of the Prince of Wales, and\r\nproposed his health.\r\n\r\n_March 14th_.--I published a collection of my articles on French history\r\nand affairs under the title of 'Royal and Republican France.'\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n23 _St. James's Square, March 15th_.--Many thanks for your book on France.\r\nMost of the articles were familiar to me, but all will bear reading again.\r\nYou here show up the weakness of French public life and the faults of\r\nFrench parties as no one else has done; and I do not recollect to have seen\r\nanywhere else pointed out the intimate connexion between the social state\r\nof modern France--with every old tradition destroyed, and the continuance\r\nof a family, as we understand the word here, rendered impossible--and the\r\npolitical condition, in which every public man is either fighting for\r\nhis own personal interest and nothing else, or for the triumph of his\r\nparticular theory of politics, which, if successful, is to be enforced\r\ndespotically by all the power of a centralised administration. I have never\r\nthought so badly of the French future as now--no energy except among the\r\nReds, no power of united action; general apathy even as to the present, and\r\nutter indifference to the future.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_March 31st_.--Came down to Bournemouth for the first time with Hopie and\r\nthe horses.\r\n\r\n_April 8th_.--Rode to Hengistbury Head and saw for the first time the\r\nSouthbourne estate. Dined with Lord Cairns. Back to town on the 9th.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Dined at Lord Derby's. Sat next Lady Clanricarde, who, _à propos_\r\nof Sir H. Holland's 'Past Life,' talked about her father [Footnote: George\r\nCanning, _d_. 1827.] and his last illness. She said that in truth Holland\r\nsaw Canning very little at Chiswick, and that it was Sir Matthew Tierney\r\nwho really attended him; and then she told me the following story of\r\nTierney:--News came from Clumber that the Duke of Newcastle was dangerously\r\nill with typhus fever. Tierney was sent down as fast as post-horses could\r\ncarry him. It was about 1823, in the pre-railway days; and when he arrived\r\nhe was informed that the Duke had been dead about two hours. Shocked at\r\nthis intelligence, he desired to see the corpse, which was already laid\r\nout. At his first glance he thought he was dead. At the second he doubted\r\nit. At the third he cried out, 'Bring me up a bucket of brandy!' They tore\r\nthe clothes off the body and swathed it in a sheet imbibed with brandy, and\r\nthen resorted to friction with brandy. In rather more than an hour symptoms\r\nof life began to manifest themselves, and in two hours the Duke was able to\r\nswallow. He recovered, and lived twenty-five years afterwards. Certainly\r\nthis triumph over death beats even Dr. Gull's nursing of the Prince of\r\nWales. It is the myth of Hercules and Alcestis.\r\n\r\n_May 4th_.--Visit to Drummond Wolff at Boscombe. A further look at\r\nSouthbourne. I chose the site I afterwards purchased.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--The King of the Belgians presided at the Literary Fund dinner.\r\nDisraeli made a capital speech.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--Visit to Mrs. Grote at Sheire. Called at Albury. Many London\r\ndinners.\r\n\r\nThe Bennett case was heard at this time by the Judicial Committee. Long\r\ndeliberation on the judgement at the Chancellor's on June 1st. It was\r\ndelivered on June 8th. [Footnote: See 'The Bennett Judgement' in _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, October 1872.]\r\n\r\n_From Lord Westbury_\r\n\r\n_June 1st_,--I am going to Oxford, and fear I may be late at the committee.\r\nThere are very important subjects in which we wish to examine you;\r\nespecially the danger, if not the illegality, of attempting by new\r\nlegislation to create a new Appellate Jurisdiction for the Colonies.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Twisleton_\r\n\r\n3 Rutland Gate, June 6th\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--I send you herewith Francis's translation of Pinto on Credit,\r\ntogether with the original French work of Pinto. The attack on Pombal is in\r\nFrancis's concluding observations. Some of the notes are very interesting,\r\nas illustrating the feeling of national superiority among the English, and\r\nof national depression among the French, between 1763 and the American War\r\nof Independence--see pp. 52, 66, 166. My impression is that the French felt\r\nmore humiliated during that period than during an equal number of years\r\nafter 1814. The loss of Canada and their expulsion from America wounded\r\ntheir national feelings of pride _then_ nearly as much as the loss of\r\nAlsace and part of Lorraine wounds those feelings now. A hundred years ago\r\nthere were very exaggerated ideas, both in England and in France, as to the\r\nstrength which a nation derived from colonies.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nEDWARD TWISLETON.\r\n\r\nP.S.--In Francis's Fragment of Autobiography he speaks of this translation\r\nas his own; and says that upon accepting his appointment to India he\r\nsurrendered all his papers to Stephen Baggs, 'in whose name the translation\r\nhad been published.' See 'Memoir of Sir P.F.' vol. i. p. 366.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_June 28th_.--Assembly at Grosvenor House. July 2nd, assembly at Lansdowne\r\nHouse. July 3rd, Queen's ball--a very brilliant season.\r\n\r\n_From Lady Smith_\r\n\r\nLowestoft, July 9th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--In one of your friendly letters to me, after the decease\r\nof our valued friend Emily Taylor, you kindly hinted that you would\r\noccasionally favour me with a note; but, knowing the demands upon your pen,\r\nI should not have reminded you of this kindness but for an incident which\r\noccurred last evening when my niece, Ina Reeve, came in to me, saying she\r\nhad read such a severe and bitter review of your late publication as quite\r\nsurprised her. As she brought the 'Saturday Review' with her, she read it\r\nto me, and perhaps, dear friend, you may have read it, and perhaps guess\r\nits author. To me it seems he is not so angry with your books as with\r\nyourself. Mr. Reeve floats uppermost in almost every line, and 'tis you he\r\nhates. I perceive he cannot endure you, and makes use of your books only\r\nto insult you. I hope you will take care how you come in his way, for I am\r\nsure he will do you a mischief. Beware of the evil eye! He talks of your\r\nignorance of the New Testament. I could not help thinking how little he is\r\nacquainted with its spirit.\r\n\r\nI also read with much concern of the treatment by Mr. Ayrton of that\r\nadmirable Curator at the Kew Gardens--Dr. Hooker. Cruel it will be to\r\nscience and the public if he is driven from the position he is so competent\r\nto fill with good results.\r\n\r\nI have read at present only a part of your first volume, which I much\r\nenjoyed. Sir James was in Paris about two or three years before the Great\r\nRevolution began, but the fermentation was beginning. 'Tis time to relieve\r\nyou from my imperfect writing, for my sight is not very perfect, and by\r\ncandlelight I can neither see to read or write. About two months go I\r\ncompleted my ninety-ninth year; but I have health and a new source of\r\nhappiness in my nephew James and his dear daughter, who are come to reside\r\nat Lowestoft. _She_ is a daily friend to me, a second self; as our taste in\r\nliterature, in poetry, and in morals agree. Only think, the Dean of Norwich\r\nsent me his defence of St. Athanasius' Creed!\r\n\r\nI am your dear friend,\r\n\r\nP. SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe next entry in the Journal introduces us to the place--a site on the\r\nSouthbourne estate already spoken of--where, two years afterwards, Reeve\r\nbuilt the house in which so much of the last twenty years of his life was\r\npassed. It will be seen that for some time he hesitated between this and\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ascot where, in the autumn, he inherited a small\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n_July 13th_.--To Christchurch, with Parker and Cockerell, [Footnote:\r\nFrederick Pepys Cockerell, one of a family of distinguished architects, and\r\nhimself of a high reputation. He died at the age of 45, in 1878.] about the\r\nhouse at Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Dined at Duke of Argyll's. 20th, three days at Strawberry Hill.\r\n27th, party at Aldermaston: Otway, Layards, H. Bruce.\r\n\r\nHaving taken Loch Gair House for the season, went there by Greenock on\r\nAugust 2nd. I paid about twelve guineas a week. [Loch Gair--wrote Mrs.\r\nReeve--is a tiny, land-locked bay on the west shore of Loch Fyne. Park-like\r\ngrounds, with a pretty burn rushing down, skirt this loch. There is a\r\nsmall kitchen garden, and a dairy of six cows. The best fishing is in Loch\r\nClasken, about a mile and a half west. There is a boat on the loch. The\r\nhouse is a square structure, three stories high, and with underground\r\nlarders, dairy, &c. and attics for servants, so that there is ample\r\naccommodation. I think Henry will enjoy the serene beauty of the place, the\r\nbalmy air and fragrant odours, and idleness, delicious because earned by\r\nhard work.]\r\n\r\nThe Penders being at Minard, we had the benefit of their society and his\r\nyacht. Roland Richardson, Frank Hawkins, Mr. Dempster, the Worsleys, Edmund\r\nWallace, Fairfax Taylor, Sir A. Grant, the Colebrookes, came to stay\r\nwith us; and Colvile. The Derbys and Sir W. Thomson, [Footnote: Now Lord\r\nKelvin.] Rawlinson, Massey, C. Villiers and the Lowes, staying at Minard.\r\n\r\n[Of this time Mrs. Reeve wrote:--The sun is again ruling the day and the\r\nmoon the night, to the very great glory of Loch Gair. On Sunday (August\r\n18th) the whole Minard party, seventeen in number, came over to tea, much\r\nto the amusement of Mr. Dempster, to whom we talked of seclusion, and who\r\ndid not expect a cabinet minister, a very 'swell' admiral, and sundry fine\r\nladies. Mr. Dempster's was but a short visit, to our regret; and on Monday\r\nI took him in the dog-cart to meet the 'Iona' at Ardrishaig.]\r\n\r\n_October 2nd_.--Left Loch Gair. Visit to Orde's at Kilmory; then to\r\nInvergarry (E. Ellice's) by the Caledonian Canal. Deer shooting. 11th,\r\nto Keir; 16th, to Ormiston; then to Abington--shooting there. To town on\r\nOctober 26th.\r\n\r\nMiss Handley died in October. She left me the Winkfield portion of the\r\nBracknell estate, which was afterwards confirmed by a decree of the Master\r\nof the Rolls.\r\n\r\n_November 13th_.--Dined at Sandbach's with the Queen of Holland, Prince\r\nEdward of Saxe-Weimar, Lady Eastlake, and Bishop Wilberforce. A few other\r\ndinners.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 25th_.--I have been down to the Van de Weyers at New Lodge,\r\nWindsor Forest, from Saturday till Monday, a thing I have frequently done\r\nof late. Van de Weyer is almost the last survivor of the brilliant London\r\nsociety of thirty or forty years ago, and to his great literary and social\r\nexperience he unites an unequalled knowledge of the politics of Europe.\r\nDuring the whole of his reign King Leopold was his own foreign minister;\r\nand he succeeded, by his connexion with the Queen of England, and with\r\nLouis-Philippe, and with Germany, in creating a most influential position\r\nin the world, which he did not impart to his Belgian ministers. But Van de\r\nWeyer was the exception. He was the constant channel of communication with\r\nthe Court of England. The King wrote to him two or three times a week, and\r\nhe to the King. Their correspondence must be a complete history of the\r\ntimes. Baron Stockmar was to an equal degree in his King's confidence; but\r\nStockmar never had the political position of Van de Weyer, nor do I think\r\nhe was so able a man. I had hinted, in my review of Stockmar's Life,\r\n[Footnote: _Edinburgh Review_, October 1872.] that his oracular powers had\r\nbeen somewhat exaggerated, and that he was rather more attached to the\r\ninterests of the House of Coburg than to those of England; for which I do\r\nnot blame him. However, Van de Weyer and some others of Stockmar's friends\r\n(including the Queen) dispute this, and probably think I have not done him\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Van de Weyer asserts that when the marriage of the Queen of\r\nSpain was on the _tapis_, Leopold and Queen Victoria had it in their power\r\nto bring about the Coburg marriage, but that they deliberately refused to\r\ndo so from respect to their engagements with France. And they acted in this\r\nwith the full concurrence of Stockmar. The Queen of Spain had established,\r\nby private means, a correspondence with Queen Victoria. The letters passed\r\nthrough the hands of Mr. Huth, the merchant, and from him to Van de Weyer,\r\nwho delivered them. Isabella complained in these letters of her desperate\r\nand forlorn condition; said she was bullied and threatened by the French,\r\nand expressed her abhorrence of the marriage Bresson was urging upon her.\r\nShe declared that if Leopold and Queen Victoria would sanction the Coburg\r\nmarriage, she would throw the French over, and marry Prince Leopold the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nThe King and our Queen held a solemn conference and deliberation on the\r\nsubject. Palmerston was informed of the transaction; but the ministers seem\r\nto have had no great voice in the matter, for the Queen considered the\r\nengagement she had entered into at Eu as a personal promise, and England\r\nhad consistently declared that 'she had no candidate.' To put forward\r\nLeopold at the last hour would have been to forfeit this pledge, which, on\r\nthe contrary, was most strictly and honourably maintained.\r\n\r\nIt was the knowledge of this, and the consciousness that a less\r\nconscientious policy might have rescued the Queen of Spain from a dreadful\r\nfate, that rendered the Queen of England and Stockmar so indignant when it\r\nturned out that the French Government had been far less scrupulous, and had\r\nnot only forced on the marriage of the Queen to a man she detested, but had\r\nalso married the other Infanta to Montpensier.\r\n\r\nThis communication of Queen Isabella to Queen Victoria is to this day\r\nwholly unrevealed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Leopold's annuity (which I explained in the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview'), it was not only secured by act of Parliament, but by treaty; for\r\nthere was a regular treaty of marriage concluded between Prince Leopold and\r\nthe Crown of England on his marriage with the Princess Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe intrigues going on with reference to Belgium, both in France and in\r\nHolland, during the Polignac Ministry have been alluded to in a former\r\npage. [Footnote: _Ante_, pp. 111-12.] But it is less generally known that\r\nat this same time, the Prince of Orange, afterwards William II., was\r\nintriguing to form a party to place him on the throne of France in the\r\nevent of the overthrow of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nHe spent thirty or forty millions of francs in bribing officers of the army\r\nand others, which was the cause of his subsequent embarrassment and debts.\r\nThe French found the plot out, and demanded of the King of Holland that\r\nthe Prince should be signally punished. He was accordingly deprived of his\r\ncommand and of his rank in the army, and even for a time arrested and put\r\nin confinement. He then found out that his French adherents had only been\r\ndeluding him to get his money.\r\n\r\n_December 4th_.--To Teddesley. Shooting there. Thence to Crewe, to meet\r\nLady Egerton of Tatton.\r\n\r\n_12th_.--Henry Greville died. To Farnborough. I determined to publish the\r\nGreville Journals.\r\n\r\nTo Bracknell to see the Winkfield land; and to Timsbury for Christmas.\r\n\r\n1873.--At Bournemouth early in January, about the house. To London on\r\nJanuary 11th.\r\n\r\n_January 25th_.--Lord Lytton's funeral in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n_February 14th_.--Dined at Harvie Farquhar's. He was one of C. Greville's\r\nexecutors, and was curious about the Journals.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. W. Longman_\r\n\r\n_C.O., March 4th_.--Mr. Morris [Footnote: Edward E. Morris, editor of\r\n_Epochs of Modern History_.] writes under a complete delusion. I could not\r\npossibly write anything for him in less than two years; and I had rather\r\nnot enter into any agreement. On reflection, I am satisfied that it would\r\nnot answer my purpose to write a popular 'History of the French Revolution'\r\nfor 100 £, and to surrender the copyright. An author never ought to\r\nsurrender a copyright unless he is compelled to do so. If I wrote a History\r\nof the French Revolution which became a school book or an educational book,\r\nit might become a property of some little value.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that the 'Review' suffers when I am too busy to write in\r\nit; and I have in my hands and before me literary work and materials of a\r\nfar more remunerative character, which will suffice to fill the remainder\r\nof my life. It would be unwise in me to undertake a fresh task, which could\r\nnot possibly pay me. Therefore, upon the whole, I think you had better put\r\nit in other hands. [Footnote: Eventually the work was written by Mrs. S. R.\r\nGardiner, though from a point of view very different, we may believe, from\r\nthat which Reeve would have taken.] O'Connor Morris would do it very well.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to alter my mind. My first impulse was to accept from a wish to\r\noblige you, and from interest in the subject; but further consideration\r\nsays 'NO!'\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_March 19th_.--Dined at Goschen's at the Admiralty. Mme. Novikoff there, an\r\nactive Russian agent.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government was beaten by a majority of three. Most of the\r\ncasual elections this year went against the Government. Gladstone resigned\r\non this occasion, but came in again, which he had better not have done.\r\n\r\n_March 31st_.--Dined with Charles Austin--very old and infirm; his last\r\neffort. Lord Belper was there.\r\n\r\nTo Bracknell at Easter, in Miss Handley's house. Took the horses; went to\r\nmeet of Queen's Hounds; stayed there till April 19th.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. W. Longman_\r\n\r\nOld Bracknell House, April 13th.\r\n\r\nMy dear William,--I am glad you have been to see my scrap of land. I have\r\ntaken a great fancy to the spot, and should be very well contented to end\r\nmy days there, gazing on that magnificent view of the coast and the sea. At\r\npresent I am spending this vacation in Berkshire, and only suffering from\r\nthe excessive cold.\r\n\r\nI am reading with the greatest interest Baron Hübner's 'Promenade autour du\r\nMonde,' which was reviewed in the 'Times' two or three days ago. It is a\r\nwork of extraordinary merit and importance. I shall review it in the next\r\n'Edinburgh,' and I strongly recommend you to publish a translation of it,\r\nif you can. I have seldom read so wonderful a book.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nHENRY REEVE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal goes on to speak of perhaps the most remarkable 'centenarian'\r\nof the nineteenth century:--\r\n\r\n_May 23rd_.--Dined at Lord Stanhope's with the Antiquaries. Dean Stanley\r\nproposed Lady Smith's health. She was just 100.\r\n\r\nPleasance Reeve, Lady Smith, widow of Sir James Smith, the botanist and\r\nfounder of the Linnaean Society, was born on May 11, 1773, and christened\r\non the following day at Lowestoft, where her baptismal register still\r\nexists. On May 13, 1873, having just completed her hundredth year, she\r\ncaused a dinner to be given to the hundred oldest persons in Lowestoft,\r\nwhose joint ages averaged seventy-seven years, and public rejoicings were\r\nheld in the town. On May 24th I went down with my daughter to see her, and\r\nspent the best part of three days with her. Married in 1795 to Dr. Smith,\r\nafterwards Sir James, she had been the intimate friend, in Norwich, of my\r\ngrandfather and grandmother. On my father's marriage in 1807, he took a\r\nhouse in Surrey Street, next door to the Smiths, and their intercourse was\r\nperpetual. I have myself no earlier recollection than that of her kindness\r\nto me and attachment to my mother. We used to sit in their pew at the\r\nOctagon Chapel, Norwich; and the first evening party I can remember was at\r\nher house, when Mrs. Opie and William Taylor were present--the latter I\r\nthink rather drunk!\r\n\r\nWe found Lady Smith at Lowestoft on this 24th of May, sitting in her chair,\r\nlooking extremely well, though shrunk; her voice was firm and unchanged; no\r\ndeafness; no dulness of sight; and when they served a little collation she\r\nhad ordered for us, she got up, moved to the table, and did the honours.\r\n\r\nShe complained, however, that the excitement of the last two or three weeks\r\nhad impaired her strength and taken away her appetite, I told her that the\r\nevening before, when I was dining at Lord Stanhope's with the Antiquaries,\r\nher health had been proposed in a graceful speech by the Dean of\r\nWestminster. The venerable Society drank the most venerable lady. This\r\naffected her, and she exclaimed, 'You must not tell me such things as\r\nthese. They drive me mad. I find it harder to support the many marks of\r\nkindness and distinction I have received than to bear the burden of a\r\nhundred years.'\r\n\r\nI asked her what was the first thing she remembered. She said she was\r\nconfident she remembered being taken to her aunt's at Saxmundham as an\r\ninfant of nine months old, and still saw her eyes, the crocuses in the\r\nborder, and the flutter of the fringe on her own robe. Of political events\r\nshe thought the first in her memory was the taking of the Bastille, and she\r\nenlarged on the extraordinary enthusiasm excited by the French Revolution.\r\nI said the American war came before the Revolution of 1789; and she replied\r\n'Yes, no doubt I remember hearing the American war talked about;' and then\r\nquoted the lines (Dr. Aikins' she said):--\r\n\r\n  See the justice of Heaven! America cries;\r\n  George loses his senses, North loses his eyes.\r\n  When first they provoked me, all Europe could find\r\n  That the Monarch was mad and the Minister blind.\r\n\r\nBut the date of this epigram must be somewhat later. Lord North became\r\nblind in 1787 [and the King's insanity was not publicly known till November\r\n1788].\r\n\r\nShe remembered Mr. Windham as one of the most graceful and fascinating\r\nof men. Lady Morley [Footnote: Frances, daughter of Thomas Talbot, of\r\nWymondham, Norfolk, married Lord Boringdon, afterwards Earl of Morley, in\r\n1809.] (the present Earl's grandmother) was staying with the Smiths when\r\nshe came out, and was equally remarkable for her wit, her beauty, and her\r\nfine hair. Her mother, Mrs. Talbot, was very ugly. We then talked over all\r\nthe old Norwich families, Gower, Taylors, Aldersons, Bathurst, &c. She said\r\nshe thought my mother a much finer character than Mrs. Austin, and, she\r\nadded, a fine understanding too.\r\n\r\nHer interest in all the events of the day--the last spider discovered\r\nby Dr. Carpenter at the bottom of the ocean and the last improvement at\r\nBurlington House--is as keen as the recollection of the past. 'Punch' and\r\nthe 'Illustrated News' and the other newspapers bring it all before her.\r\n\r\n_May 28th_.--Gladstone presided at the Literary Fund dinner. I took Meadows\r\nTaylor, who was staying with us.\r\n\r\n_From Lady Smith_\r\n\r\n_Lowestoft, May 31st_.--Many thanks, dear Mr. Reeve, for sending me the\r\nhandsome present of turtle soup, which came on Thursday evening and made\r\nthe best part of my dinner on Friday. My intellectual treat has been the\r\nspeeches by the Premier and others at the Literary Fund dinner, and I much\r\nadmire the eloquence of the several talented gentlemen. I write so badly\r\nI will spare you, and only send my affectionate regards to Mrs. Reeve and\r\ndear Hopie, and to yourself. I am very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nP. SMITH.\r\n\r\nContinuing the Journal:--\r\n\r\nTo Bracknell again on June 1st. Attended Ascot for the last time. The Shah\r\nof Persia was in London this year, and was received in state. The Queen\r\nlent him Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n_June 25th_.--Goschen's fête to the Shah of Persia at Greenwich Hospital.\r\nFine sight. We steamed through the docks after the Shah.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--Met M. de Laveleye at Van de Weyer's.\r\n\r\n_July 14th_.--Dined at Merchant Taylors' Hall; made a speech.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Dined at Lambeth, to talk over the Judicature Bill with the\r\nArchbishop. Met Bishop Wilberforce as I was driving down Constitution Hill.\r\nHe was killed two days afterwards (on the 19th) by a fall from his horse,\r\nriding with Lord Granville.\r\n\r\nCount Münster came as German ambassador. I dined with him at Beust's and at\r\nHoughton's.\r\n\r\nLord Westbury died in London on July 20th, 1873; a man whose bitter tongue\r\nmade him many enemies, and procured for him a reputation as of one without\r\nrespect or regard for aught human or divine. Those who knew him well told\r\na different tale. He has been described by them as having a most kind and\r\nfeeling nature. 'He did not make many professions, but had the good of his\r\nfellow-creatures at heart. He always found time to give advice and help.'\r\nReeve, who had been thrown into frequent and familiar intercourse with him,\r\nwas in the habit of speaking of him as one whose real character was very\r\ndifferent indeed from that assigned him by popular repute; and the letter\r\nof sympathy which he wrote to Lord Westbury's daughter, the Hon. Augusta\r\nBethell,[Footnote: Afterwards Mrs. Parker, and, by a second marriage, Mrs.\r\nNash.] merely expressed his honest opinion.\r\n\r\nRutland Gate, July 23rd.\r\n\r\nDear Miss Bethell,--I should have written sooner if I had had the use of\r\nmy hand, to express to you my profound sorrow and sympathy in the loss you\r\nhave sustained.\r\n\r\nI look back with unmixed satisfaction on the relations I maintained for\r\nso many years with your father. He honoured me with his confidence and\r\nfriendship. I have the profoundest admiration, not only for his qualities\r\nas a lawyer, but for his just and enlarged mind, his vast reading, his\r\nmemory, and the inexhaustible kindness of his heart. He was one of the\r\ngreatest men I have known, and one of those whose loss to us all is most\r\nirreparable. How much more so to you!\r\n\r\nMrs. Reeve begs to unite her condolences to mine; and we remain always\r\n\r\nYour much attached friends,\r\n\r\nHENRY REEVE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes a six weeks' tour with Mrs. Reeve in Switzerland and\r\nGermany:--\r\n\r\n_August 1st_.--To Paris and Geneva, _viâ_ Dieppe. Saw Thiers in Paris. He\r\nhad been turned out of office on May 4th. On August 4th reached Binet's\r\n_campagne_. Family dinners, &c., at Geneva. 12th, called at Blumenthal's\r\n_chalet_, near Vevey. 14th, to Berne, Grindelwald, and Ragaz, by Zurich.\r\nTook baths at Ragaz. Longmans came there on the 22nd. Pleasant excursion\r\nto Glarus. 26th, to Syrgenstein [near the Lake of Constance--wrote Mrs.\r\nReeve--where some cousins of ours, the Whittles, bought an old schloss\r\nwith some 300 acres, and settled about fifteen years ago]. 31st, by Ulm to\r\nBaden-Baden, Bonn, Aix, Antwerp; home on September 8th.\r\n\r\n_September 10th_.--Sir Henry Holland dined with us. He had just been to\r\nNijni Novgorod, and was starting for Naples. He died as soon as he got\r\nback, on October 27th. This was the last time I saw him. He was then\r\neighty-five. To Bracknell in September.\r\n\r\n_September 27th_.--To Christchurch. Ordered fences for Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_October 3rd_.--To Cultoquhey (Lord Moncreiff's). 6th, fishing at Battleby\r\n(Maxtone Graham's), in the Tay. We killed seven fish; I, one of 19 lbs.;\r\nHopie, two, one of 25 lbs. Thence to the Colviles', at Craigflower, and on\r\nthe 11th to Minto. 14th, drove to Ancrum and Kirklands. Beautiful day.\r\n\r\nWe went from Minto to Dartrey, co. Monaghan, by Carlisle and Stranraer;\r\ncrossed to Larne, but had to sleep at Dundalk, on the 17th. At Dartrey\r\nfound the Ilchesters, Mr. Herbert, and others. Lady Craven and the\r\nHeadforts came later. Returned to England on the 27th by Greenore and\r\nHolyhead.\r\n\r\nFor the October number of the 'Review,' Reeve had written an article on\r\nthe Ashantee War, in which he would seem to have been assisted by Lord\r\nKimberley, then Colonial Secretary. On its appearance, Mr. Pope Hennessy,\r\nat this time Governor of the Bahamas, but who, in the preceding year, had\r\nbeen Governor of the Gold Coast, wrote to 'The Editor of the \"Edinburgh\r\nReview,\"' objecting to some of the statements regarding his own conduct,\r\nwhich, he declared, were inaccurate. And, having given utterance to his\r\nobjections, he continued:--\r\n\r\n_November 28th_.--As I have ventured on fault-finding about one article, I\r\nmust not deprive myself of the pleasure of congratulating you heartily\r\non another. Since October 1802 no article on foreign affairs has been so\r\napropos as your Cuban one of last October. Here it has been read with\r\navidity and universal satisfaction, and I believe it will do much to guide\r\ninfluential opinion in England at this crisis. I hope to see you return to\r\nthe subject in January. Remember that your January number, as far as the\r\ninstruction of M.P.s is concerned, is always an important political one. In\r\nview of your dealing with the subject again, I give you a few facts that\r\nmay perhaps add special interest once more to the 'Edinburgh's' mode of\r\ndealing with it.\r\n\r\nEngland is directly concerned in Cuba by its close proximity to the\r\nBahamas. Cay Lobos (British territory) is but fourteen miles from Cay\r\nConfites (Cuban territory). That leaves but eight miles of high seas in\r\nwidth. The people of the Bahamas have made frequent complaint to the\r\ngovernor about the conduct of the Spanish authorities in Cuba. In\r\nAugust this year the Governor of the Bahamas sent a memorial to the\r\nCaptain-General of Cuba about the impediments to the Bahama sponging trade\r\ncaused by the arbitrary acts of the Spaniards. No notice has been taken of\r\nthis. It has not even been acknowledged. In 1870 complaints were made to\r\nSir James Walker (my predecessor) that James Fraser and three other British\r\nsubjects were captured in a Bahama schooner, taken ashore to Cuba, and\r\nthere shot. The Spaniards justified this by saying that the ship was\r\nconveying supplies to the insurgents, and they (the Spaniards) executed\r\nFraser and the others as pirates. In the same year a man named Williams\r\ncomplained that sixty or seventy Spanish soldiers landed at Berry Island (a\r\npart of the Bahama colony), chasing Cuban refugees, firing off their guns,\r\nand threatening to hang Williams if he did not aid them in their search.\r\nSubsequently the Spanish admiral, Melcampo, made a sort of apology for\r\nthis; but the Captain-General of Cuba, on the other hand, wrote to Sir\r\nJames Walker, complaining that the British lighthouse-keepers on Berry\r\nIsland had refused to aid the Spaniards in pursuit of 'pirates' on British\r\nsoil. Lord Granville took up the matter in a proper spirit. He sent\r\nenergetic remonstrances to Madrid. He got the Admiralty to telegraph to Sir\r\nRodney Mundy, at Halifax, to despatch ships of war to aid the Governor of\r\nthe Bahamas in protecting the colony from the raids of the Spaniards. As to\r\nthe seizing of ships on the high seas under neutral flags, he telegraphed\r\nto Sir John Crampton, at Madrid, to say that it would be 'a glaring\r\nviolation of the law of nations.' The Madrid Government promised to get the\r\nCaptain-General's proclamation revoked; but my predecessor reported that\r\nGeneral Dulce had not revoked it, and he returned to Spain without doing\r\nso. The half-and-half revocation that took place left 'exceptional\r\ncases' at the discretion of the Spanish cruisers. Hence the case of the\r\n'Virginius.'\r\n\r\nThe excitement here about the recent executions is intense. Twenty-nine of\r\nthose shot resided at Nassau. The public feeling is now so strong that it\r\ndeprives me of power (especially as all British troops are withdrawn) to\r\nstop expeditions against the Spaniard, though I am doing my best to allay\r\nit and to be strictly neutral. Indeed, in the interest of the peace and\r\nwell-being of the Bahamas, I have had to write to Lord Kimberley, asking\r\nhim to use his influence in getting some law-abiding government substituted\r\nin Cuba for the present lawless rule of the volunteers. Your article will\r\ndo much to support H.M. Government in a decided course now.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nJ. POPE HENNESSY.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records here:--\r\n\r\n_December 8th_.--We went to Knowsley, with Lord Cairns. There were there\r\nLord C. Hamilton, Henry Cowper, &c. Lord Sefton shot with us. We killed\r\n827 head on the 9th, 784 head on the 10th, 366 head on the 11th. Went to\r\nLiverpool with Lord Cairns on the 12th, and home next day.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_C. O., December 15th_.--The last edition of my translation of\r\nTocqueville's book on France has probably not yet found its way to\r\nKnowsley's library, and I shall be much gratified if you will allow me to\r\nplace a copy there. This edition has the advantage of containing fourteen\r\nposthumous chapters not to be found in any other, and these certainly are\r\nnot the least remarkable part of the work. I was moved to translate them\r\npartly by your saying to me one day, 'Can't you give us any more of\r\nTocqueville?'\r\n\r\nThe Journal goes on:--\r\n\r\nTo Paris for Christmas. Saw M. Guizot; dined at the Embassy. Dined with\r\nMme. Faucher on Christmas Day; with M. Guizot on the 27th; Camille Rousset\r\nand Taine there. On the 28th dined at the Duc de Broglie's, then home\r\nminister; Apponys, Prince Orloff, Lord Lyons, Lambert de Sainte-Croix\r\nthere. Dined on the 29th with the Lyttons at Mme. Gavard's; and on the 30th\r\nwith the Comte de Paris at De Mussy's.\r\n\r\n1874.--The year opened at Paris. Called on M. Guizot and dined with the\r\nRaymonds on New Year's Day. Breakfasted with the Duc d'Aumale at Chantilly\r\non the 2nd; first time I had seen him there. Dined at Mohl's with\r\nHaussonville, the Lyttons, and Tourguéneff.\r\n\r\nRenewed my acquaintance with Drouyn de Lhuys, who related to me the affairs\r\nof 1866. Very curious. Dined at the Political Economy Club on the 5th; and\r\nat Lytton's on the 6th. Back to London on the 7th.\r\n\r\n_January 24th_.--To Aldermaston, with Lord Aberdare, the Samuel Bakers,\r\nHerbert Spencer, Franks and others. Pleasant and interesting; but I had the\r\ngout and was laid up for a month. This was the day Gladstone published his\r\nfatal address to the electors at Greenwich. Parliament was dissolved on the\r\n26th. We all told Lord Aberdare that the party would be smashed, and so it\r\nwas. Disraeli's Government came in on February 21st.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--The Master of the Rolls gave judgement in the Handley suit, which\r\ngave me the Winkfield property.\r\n\r\nThe case was shortly described by Mrs. Reeve:--\r\n\r\n'There were two wills, one of Edwin Handley, the other that of his two\r\nsurviving sisters. His will was good as to devise of money, bad as to land;\r\ntherefore the land passed to the sisters, and their bequests of land come\r\ninto effect. The property in Winkfield which comes to Henry is a little\r\nmore than 30 acres. Of course the agricultural value is not very great; but\r\nwe hope, as building and accommodation land, to make a good thing of it.'\r\n\r\nIt appears, indeed, that the advisability of settling on it themselves was\r\nconsidered; but there was no house on the property; so that as in either\r\ncase a house had to be built, the Christchurch site was preferred. In June\r\nReeve sold this Winkfield property for nearly 6,000 £., which--he added to\r\na note of the sale--'enabled me to build Foxholes.'\r\n\r\nThe following is endorsed:--'M. Guizot on the death of [his daughter]\r\nPauline. The last letter he wrote me with his own hand.'\r\n\r\n8 _mars_.--Je vous remercie de votre sympathie, my dear Sir. J'y comptais.\r\nVous êtes un des anciens témoins de ma vie et de mon bonheur. Il a été\r\ngrand; mais le bonheur se paye. Je me soumets douloureusement mais sans\r\nmurmure. La vie est ainsi faite. C'est pour mon gendre Cornélis de Witt que\r\nje ressens une pitié profonde. Il a joui pendant vingt-cinq ans de ce que\r\nj'ai moi-même appelé le bonheur parfait, l'amour dans le mariage. Il reste\r\nseul avec ses sept enfants. Ils viendront tous vivre avec moi, sous les\r\nyeux de ma fille Henriette,[Footnote: Mme. Guizot de Witt.] une vraie mère.\r\nRevenez nous voir.\r\n\r\nJe n'ai pas le coeur à vous parler d'autre chose. Je n'ai pas encore reçu\r\n'l'Edinburgh Review' des mois d'octobre et janvier dernier. Je les fais\r\ndemander. Je vis aussi en Angleterre. C'est beaucoup d'avoir deux vies et\r\npresque deux patries. Mr. Burton a-t-il publié l'article qu'il projetait\r\nsur mon Histoire de France? Je vous envoie quelques pages que je viens\r\nd'écrire sur mon excellent ami, M. Vitet. [Footnote: Louis Vitet, 'de\r\nl'Académie française,' _d_.June 1873. This is presumably the 'notice'\r\nprefixed to Vitet's _Etudes philosophiques et littéraires_ (8vo. 1875).]\r\nEncore un profond regret.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir. Tenez-moi un peu au courant de ce qui se passe chez\r\nvous et de ce que vous en pensez. Nous végétons ici dans les ténèbres,\r\nen attendant un mieux qui viendra, je ne sais quand ni comment. Mais je\r\npersiste à y croire. Tout à vous, GUIZOT.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here has:--\r\n\r\n_March 10th_.--The Duc d'Aumale dined at The Club dinner.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--Met Disraeli at Lady Derby's first party. A day or two before\r\nthis, at Windsor, Lord Granville was chaffing Lady John Manners and\r\nsaid--referring to the Prime Minister's birth--'You must acknowledge that\r\nyour chief's nose is very queer.' 'At all events,' was Lady John's ready\r\nrejoinder, 'it is not out of joint.'\r\n\r\n_28th_.--Took the Duc de Rochefoucault (the French Ambassador) to the boat\r\nrace at Mortlake.\r\n\r\n_April 2nd_.--To Christchurch. On the 4th, in torrents of rain, we fixed,\r\nwith Cockerell, the exact site of Foxholes House.\r\n\r\n_May 8th_.--Ball to the Prince of Wales at the French Embassy. Duchess of\r\nEdinburgh there.\r\n\r\nLord Hertford, the Tory Lord Chamberlain, omitted me from the Court ball\r\nthis year, for the first time since 1847. This was before the publication\r\nof the 'Greville Memoirs,' and not on account of it.\r\n\r\nTo Aix in the end of May. Longman was with me. Home on June 4th.\r\n\r\n_From M. Guizot_\r\n\r\nVal Richer, ce 22 juillet.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--Je réponds à votre aimable lettre du 14 juillet, et je\r\ncommence par supprimer mon écriture. J'en avais autrefois un qu'on trouvait\r\ntrès jolie, mais, depuis quelques mois, ma main est devenue si tremblante\r\nque j'ai renoncé à écrire moi-même. Je ne veux cependant pas tarder\r\ndavantage à vous dire avec quel plaisir j'ai lu l'article de Mr. Burton\r\nsur mon Histoire de France que je viens de trouver dans le numéro 285 de\r\n'l'Edinburgh Review.' C'est excellent; il est impossible de serrer de plus\r\nprès les diverses parties de mon ouvrage en les analysant d'une manière\r\nplus claire et plus frappante. Les liens de l'histoire de France avec\r\nl'État, la Couronne, l'Église et les moeurs publiques y sont résumés\r\ndans toute leur vérité. Je ne pourrais dans ce moment-ci, avec ma main\r\ntremblante, en remercier moi-même Mr. Burton comme je le voudrais faire.\r\nJe me promets d'y revenir plus tard. En attendant, je vous prie de le\r\nremercier pour moi, en lui disant tout ce que je pense de son parfait\r\nrésumé. Vous me pardonnerez d'être si bref; je suis encore assez souffrant\r\net fatigué. Je reprends pourtant dans ce moment même la publication\r\npériodique des livraisons de mon histoire; elles seront envoyées chaque\r\nsemaine à Mr. Burton comme à vous, et je serai bienheureux si vous me dites\r\nqu'elles vous intéressent autant que les précédents volumes. Pardon, my\r\ndear Sir, de ne pas vous en dire davantage. Je suis au Val Richer jusqu'à\r\nla fin de l'année. Ecrivez-moi quelquefois, je vous prie, et croyez-moi\r\naffectueusement tout à vous,\r\n\r\nGUIZOT.\r\n\r\nP.S.--C'est ma fille Henriette qui me sert de secrétaire pour ma\r\ncorrespondance comme pour mon histoire. Je n'en retrouverais nulle part un\r\npareil.\r\n\r\nThis letter, written by Mme. Guizot de Witt, was the last Reeve received\r\nfrom his old friend, who died at Val Richer on September 12th, in his 87th\r\nyear. A month later he received the following:--\r\n\r\n_From Mme. Guizot de Witt_\r\n\r\nVal Richer, ce 20 octobre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur,--Je savais bien ce que vous senteriez pour nous et aussi\r\npour vous-même. Mon père avait pour vous beaucoup d'amitié. En rangeant ses\r\npapiers, au milieu de toutes vos lettres, je trouve une foule de minutes de\r\nses réponses; quelques-unes sont bien belles. Je ne vous parle pas du vide\r\naffreux de ma vie et de mon âme. Je sais que Dieu me donnera la force de le\r\nsupporter en travaillant encore pour ceux qui m'ont quittée. Et le jour du\r\nrevoir viendra. Mon père est parti tout entier, lui-même jusqu'au bout,\r\ndans la possession de son esprit et de son âme, plein de confiance en Dieu,\r\nnous recommandant de servir le pays qu'il avait suprêmement aimé et dont\r\nles malheurs ont d'abord ébranlé sa santé. Ma Pauline aussi ne s'était\r\njamais relevée de la guerre. Us sont ensemble et en paix. Adieu, mon cher\r\nMonsieur. Vous viendrez certainement à Paris cet hiver, et nous vous\r\nverrons. Je compte aller dans six semaines retrouver tout mon monde qui\r\ny est déjà. Remerciez pour moi Mrs. Reeve et Hope, et croyez à tous mes\r\nmeilleurs sentiments.\r\n\r\nGUIZOT DE WITT.\r\n\r\n_Journal_\r\n\r\n_July_.--The building Foxholes was now going on. To Scotland, July 31st,\r\nhaving again taken Loch Gair. Also hired a 16-ton yacht--the 'Foam.' Got\r\nthere on August 1st. John Binet came to Loch Gair, straight from Geneva.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reeve wrote of him:--'It is his first visit to North Britain, and his\r\nenthusiasm--at 62--is quite delightful to witness. He travelled here from\r\nParis without stopping, and though a good deal tired and half-starved, was\r\nready for a walk that afternoon and for climbing hills the next morning.'\r\n\r\nI was engaged all the autumn at Loch Gair in revising the press of 'The\r\nGreville Memoirs' and in preparing a new edition of the 'Democracy in\r\nAmerica.'\r\n\r\nWe left Loch Gair on October 8th: and after visits to Abington, Ormiston\r\nand Minto, returned to London on the 26th.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the first part of 'The Greville Memoirs' took place on\r\nOctober 17th. It excited far greater interest than I had expected, and the\r\nfirst edition sold very rapidly. Five editions were published in less than\r\nsix months; the two first of 2,500 each, and the three last of 1,000; so\r\nthat about 8,000 copies were sold.\r\n\r\nThe Press, in the main, was highly favourable. On the 28th the\r\nQueen--though I believe she had not yet read the book, but only newspaper\r\nextracts--sent me a message by Helps to express her disapproval of it, on\r\nthese grounds 1. It was disparaging to her family. 2. It tended to weaken\r\nthe monarchy. 3. It proceeded from official persons. I begged Helps to\r\nreply, with my humble duty, that the book showed that, if the monarchy\r\nhad really been endangered, it was by the depravity of George IV. and the\r\nabsurdities of William IV.; but that under Her Majesty's reign it had\r\nbecome stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be believed that the Queen, who was, not unnaturally, much\r\noffended, never quite forgave the publication; and it is at least probable\r\nthat the annoyance she had felt was the principal reason for Reeve's never\r\nreceiving the K.G.B., to which his long service at the Council Office would\r\nseem to have, in a measure, entitled him.\r\n\r\nI saw the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg the same day, October 28th, but I\r\ndon't think the Cambridges were very angry. The old Duchess was having the\r\nbook read to her, and frequently added amusing recollections to it.\r\n\r\nThis publication was one of the most important incidents in Reeve's\r\nliterary life; one which was warmly discussed at the time and has been much\r\ncommented on since. It is probably as the editor of this remarkable book\r\nthat Reeve will be best known to future generations, and it is therefore\r\nwell to relate the story in a clear and detailed manner. From the first,\r\nReeve was fully alive to the responsibility he was undertaking; and the\r\nfollowing memorandum was apparently drawn up at the time of Greville's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum on 'The Greville Memoirs,' and on the death of Charles\r\nGreville_, 1865\r\n\r\nOn January 7th, 1865, I received from Mr. Greville, I being at Torry Hill,\r\na note requesting me to call on him for a matter, as he expressed it,\r\nnot very important, but partly of a personal and partly of a literary\r\ncharacter. I answered directly that being out of town I could not call\r\nimmediately, but would not fail to do so as soon as I returned to London.\r\n\r\nI returned to London on the afternoon of Monday, the 9th, and called in\r\nBruton Street about 11 A.M. on Tuesday the 10th. I thought Mr. Greville\r\nlooked thin, but not ill, and he was free from gout. He said, however, that\r\nhe was seriously unwell in other ways. The truth was (although he did not\r\nthen tell me so) that he had an effusion of water on the heart. I know\r\nnot how long it had been coming on; but in the preceding week he had been\r\nstaying at the Grenfells' at Taplow, where Lady Colvile had the scarlatina.\r\nFrom Taplow he proceeded to Savernake; but Lady Ailesbury had so violent a\r\nfear of the infection that she sent a servant to stop Greville's fly on the\r\nway from the station to the house, on the ground that she could not receive\r\nhim. He was therefore compelled to go to sleep at the inn at Marlborough,\r\nwhere, besides being excessively annoyed, he caught a bad cold. The next\r\nday he returned to Taplow, saying to Grenfell, 'I come back here because no\r\none will receive me!' and he soon afterwards came back to Bruton Street.\r\nThis was the history of the malady of which he died; but whether it was\r\nbrought on by the cold he caught, or by any other cause, I do not know.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw him on the 10th he was in no pain, and apparently not seriously\r\nill. He began by talking about Privy Council affairs; he then gave me an\r\naccount of the Windham papers, which Mrs. Henry Baring is preparing for\r\npublication; but I saw that these were not the subjects on which he wished\r\nto see me, and there was evidently a nervousness in his manner as he\r\napproached it. At last, sitting down in his easy-chair, he said--'And now\r\nI want to speak to you about my own affairs. Reeve, I am getting devilish\r\nold, and I think in all probability I have not long to live. I have\r\ntherefore been considering what I ought to do with the journals I have kept\r\non all important occasions for so many years of my life. They amount, I\r\nthink, to ninety volumes [Footnote: These are now in the British Museum.],\r\nand extend over nearly fifty years. I left off writing them two years ago,\r\nfinding that since I withdrew from the office I knew less of the course of\r\nevents. Let us look at them.' He then opened the lower part of a bookcase\r\nin which I saw these volumes in a row. He then added, 'Now, will you take\r\ncharge of them? I have been thinking a great deal of what I can do with\r\nthem. They contain a good deal of curious matter, as you know, which may\r\nbe of interest hereafter. I can do nothing better than leave them in your\r\nhands. You will be the judge whether any part of them, and what, can be\r\npublished.'\r\n\r\nTo this I replied, that I was very much touched by so great a mark of his\r\nconfidence and friendship; that as for the journals, he was quite right in\r\nsupposing that I should set as much store by them as he did himself, and\r\nthat in whatever I did with them hereafter, I should conform to what\r\nI might suppose to be his wishes; that it appeared to me that a broad\r\ndistinction exists between the earlier half, including the reigns of\r\nGeorge IV. and William IV., and the latter half, subsequent to the Queen's\r\naccession, and that if the former part might to a certain extent be\r\npublished soon, the other part could not. That the person I should\r\nnaturally consult in such a trust would be Lord Clarendon; but that at\r\npresent it was not necessary to take any steps, as I hoped he would still\r\nbe with us some years; that I would read the journals through, with his\r\npermission, and tell him what I thought.\r\n\r\nTo all this he assented. He said, 'They are all full of Clarendon, who\r\nhas always been so intimate with me. I will bring you down a dozen of the\r\nvolumes the first day I go out in my carriage; and if my life should be\r\nspared a few years, we will talk them over.'\r\n\r\nHe then spoke of his letters, particularly of his own letters to the late\r\nDuke of Bedford, which had been recently sent back to him. He said he would\r\nread them over; that some of them might serve to fill up and complete\r\npassages in the journals. To this I remarked, 'Do you mean, then,\r\nthese letters are to go with the journals?' He replied, 'That requires\r\nconsideration.' He did not therefore give me any power over the letters.\r\n\r\nI was going that day (January 10th) to Ampthill, to see Lord Wensleydale;\r\nand on the 14th to the Grove. This led me to say, 'Am I at liberty to\r\nmention to Lord Clarendon what has passed on this subject?' He answered\r\n'No. I had rather it should be entirely confidential.' I therefore of\r\ncourse said nothing to anyone.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 16th, I returned to town from the Grove, and went in the\r\nevening, about five, to Bruton Street. Lady Sydney and Lady Enfield were\r\nwith him. He looked somewhat weaker, and complained of total loss of\r\nappetite. As soon as the ladies were gone, he resumed the subject of the\r\njournals, and immediately said, 'Now you are come back to town, you\r\ncan take some of them.' He rang for his servant to hold a light to the\r\nbookcase, and by his directions I took vols. v., vi., vii., and viii., and\r\ncarried them home with me. He said he had lent the first four vols. to his\r\nbrother Henry, but that I should have them soon. He then again said, 'When\r\nyou have read these, you will see what you think can be published; but as\r\nyou advance they become more interesting.' I read these volumes nearly\r\nthrough the same evening, beginning from the death of Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, January 17th, I returned to Bruton Street about six. He was\r\nalone. Another volume of the journals was on the table by him, which he\r\ngave me, saying, 'You will find this more interesting'--but this was as I\r\nwas going away. I told him that I had read the former volumes greedily, and\r\nthat he had treated George IV. with great severity. He replied, 'What I\r\nhave said of him is not flattering; but that is what he was.' I then asked\r\nhim about the passages in cipher. He said he had invented this cipher\r\nhimself for the purpose of his journal; that he could read it, but nobody\r\nelse. That he would read to me the passages in cipher if I would bring them\r\nto him; but he added, 'For that matter, the truth is the greater part of\r\nthem had better be omitted, as they relate to things which are better\r\nforgotten.' He then mentioned that he had told Henry Greville that 'I was\r\nto have the journals.' And I afterwards found that he had intimated his\r\nintention to Mr. Baring and I think to Lord Granville.\r\n\r\nHe said that Meryon (his doctor) thought him better to-day-that the day\r\nbefore had been a very bad one; but he had still no appetite, though he was\r\ngoing to try to eat a piece of woodcock for his dinner. It was then near\r\nseven o'clock, and I left him, taking the volume with me, but with no\r\npresentiment that we were parting for ever. He said, as I wished him good\r\nnight, 'Come again to-morrow if you are near me.' I promised to come, and\r\nto come often, and left the room.\r\n\r\nHe can scarcely have seen anyone afterwards; for the evening was advancing,\r\nand between nine and ten he went to bed. His servant proposed to sleep\r\nnear him. He said, 'No; I don't want that, unless I am very ill.' He fell\r\nasleep, and seems never to have waked, for when he was found in the morning\r\nhe lay with his finger resting on his pillow in his accustomed attitude,\r\nlike a child asleep.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th I received a letter from Henry Greville, stating that\r\nCharles had informed him of his intention, but that there was nothing about\r\nthe journals or letters in the will or codicil. I answered this letter\r\nthe same day, by giving him an abridged copy or version of the preceding\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nI ought to have stated that, in the conversation of January 10th, Mr.\r\nGreville said that he thought it better not to fix any stated time\r\nwithin which the journals might or might not be published. Part might be\r\npublished, but it was a mere question of discretion and propriety what and\r\nwhen.\r\n\r\nI observed to him that in selecting me as his literary executor, the only\r\nquestion was whether some member of his own family might not more properly\r\nbe selected. To this he replied that he had considered that, and preferred\r\nthat I should have them. I have since found that, prior to the death of\r\nSir George Lewis, he had been selected by Greville for this trust. He then\r\nhesitated for some time whom he should appoint, and then chose me.\r\n\r\nHaving made up his mind that the time was ripe for the publication of the\r\nearlier volumes of the journals, Reeve--as has been said--gave them to the\r\nworld on October 17th, fully prepared to take all the responsibility of his\r\nact. And indeed he was quickly called on to do so; for some of Greville's\r\nrelations, uneasy--it would appear--at the hostile attitude of the Court,\r\ncalled on him to make a public declaration that they had nothing to do with\r\nit, whilst others were disposed to question Reeve's legal right. Of this,\r\nhowever, he had plenty of evidence; amongst others, that of Mr. T. Longman,\r\nwho wrote:--\r\n\r\n_Farnborough Hill, November 7th._--... In the interview I had with Mr.\r\nHarvie Farquhar, I stated that Mr. Greville consulted me some time before\r\nhis death as to whom he should leave his journals to, and that Mr. Greville\r\nconcurred in my suggestion that he should leave them to you. As Mr.\r\nGreville acted on this some time after our conference, it became obvious to\r\nMr. H. Farquhar that, as between gentlemen, the main question that had been\r\nraised, as to your right of possession, fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter this the matter was settled in a perfectly amicable manner in a\r\nmeeting between Reeve and Mr. Harvie Farquhar, representing the timorous\r\nkinsfolk, and together they wrote the following letter, which was\r\npublished, under Reeve's signature, in the 'Times,' 'Pall Mall Gazette,'\r\nand some other papers, on November 7th.\r\n\r\nFinding that statements are current that Mr. Charles Greville's and Mr.\r\nHenry Greville's executors had been consulted as to the publication of Mr.\r\nCharles Greville's Journals of the Reigns of George IV. and William IV.,\r\nI think it right to say that they were in no way consulted by me, nor\r\nwas their assent asked for, because I believed it to be the wish of\r\nMr. Greville that his family and executors should be relieved from all\r\nresponsibility in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe journals were not left to Mr. Henry Greville, nor did they pass to\r\nhis executors, having been given to me by Mr. Greville himself before\r\nhis death, as stated by me in the preface, for the purpose of eventual\r\npublication, but the time and manner of publication were left to my sole\r\ndiscretion. I am, therefore, alone responsible for the production of this\r\nportion of the journals at the present time, and any beneficial interest\r\nin them is a matter entirely between my publisher and myself. Beneficial\r\ninterest in the publication had not, however, the slightest influence on\r\nthe course I thought it right to pursue, and I take this opportunity of\r\nstating that, in my opinion, many years must elapse before the more recent\r\nportions of these journals can with propriety be published.\r\n\r\nOn the actual publication he received many encouraging letters, a few of\r\nwhich are here given, together with a remarkable expression of opinion from\r\nLord Russell, one of the few public men then living who could speak of the\r\nregency and the reign of George IV. from personal knowledge.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Delane_\r\n\r\nOctober 22nd.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--I am glad you are pleased with the first notice of Greville's\r\nJournals. There are at least two more to come, which will, I hope, be\r\nequally gratifying to you. Certainly you did not publish too soon. The\r\nworld moves too quickly for long intervals of suppressed publication. I\r\nsuppose the book is not really published, as I have only seen it in sheets.\r\nYours ever faithfully,\r\n\r\nJ. T. DELANE.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\nKnowsley, October 31st.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--The Greville papers are quite the most interesting and amusing\r\nwork of the year; and, considering the extreme difficulty of editing such a\r\nwork without spoiling it--on the one hand, by too much suppression, or by\r\nleaving in it passages which would give reasonable cause of offence to\r\nprivate persons--I think you have been singularly judicious.... As to the\r\njournalist's criticisms on public men, they seem to me to be the harsh\r\njudgements of a man trying to be impartial, though inclined to be\r\nacrimonious. There is certainly nothing in them which you could have\r\nthe slightest scruple about publishing, or which the relatives of those\r\nconcerned can resent.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\nSt. Anne's Hill, Chertsey, October 31st.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--... I have been reading Charles Greville with much interest\r\nand entertainment. I think you are quite right in publishing now, and not\r\nwaiting for a generation 'who knew not Joseph.' There is always a clamour\r\nagainst those who tell the truth. Charles Greville may very likely [have\r\nbeen], and certainly was, very often wrong; but he believed he told the\r\ntruth, and he certainly uttered his genuine sentiments. These journals\r\nthrow a strong light on contemporary events, and will be very valuable to\r\nthe future historians of the period. Ch. G. was a man who felt much and\r\nexpressed himself strongly; and had you attempted to soften his language\r\nyou would have injured the effect and destroyed the _couleur locale_.\r\n\r\nHe was a man naturally of a quick and irritable temper, and he had been a\r\nspoilt child all his life. His original education was defective. He lived\r\nwith the selfish and the self-indulgent, and naturally became selfish and\r\nself-indulgent himself. At six years old an old friend of his mother's\r\nfound him crying at dinner because he had not got the liver wing of the\r\nchicken; and to the last he would have wanted 'the liver wing.' But he had\r\nnaturally a kind heart, and a just perception; and he admired what was\r\nnoble and generous, if he did not always practise it. He suffered greatly\r\nin health, and he was too self-indulgent, even with the certainty of pain\r\nbefore his eyes, to moderate his appetite. His last years were unhappy. The\r\nindulgence of his temper made his company often disagreeable, and he very\r\nkeenly felt the neglect of his old friends. With a better education\r\nhe would have been a most valuable man, for his natural powers were\r\nconsiderable. Like so many other London men, he thought the whole world was\r\nbounded by Oxford Street, Pall Mall, the Parks, and the City; and he took\r\nhis opinions from the clubs in St. James's Street and Pall-Mall, and, as\r\nthose opinions varied, so we find his judgements in these journals vary.\r\nBut he himself was convinced, and he uttered the genuine sentiments of the\r\nmoment.... I hope you will publish the rest of the four vols. before long,\r\nand that you will preserve exactly the same plan you have done in these....\r\nYours very sincerely, E. C.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Harvie Farquhar_\r\n\r\n16 St. James's Street, November 28th.\r\n\r\nThe yeast of society ferments easily, and--at present--C. G.'s manes are\r\nthe best abused in or out of Hades; but all will settle down soon, and when\r\npeople have done throwing stones, and the water is placid enough to enable\r\nthem to see below the surface, they will better appreciate what lies at the\r\nbottom. Whether abused or not, the book will be in every library--on its\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n_From the Queen of Holland_\r\n\r\nThe Hague, Monday, November 30th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--Saturday night, November 28th, the books arrived. I\r\nam afraid, after Sunday church, more of my time than ought to have been\r\nSunday's occupation was given to these three volumes. Of course, I have not\r\n_read_ them; I _rushed_ through, and am now going to read page by page.\r\nThe interest is an immense one. Not only that I have _known many_ of the\r\npersons named, but I have _heard_ from all, and they seem to me like\r\nshadows reviving, returning to light and life. Dear Lord Clarendon's name\r\nstruck me several times; and I remember, when Mr. Greville died, Lord\r\nClarendon wrote me 'his papers had been given to the person most able to\r\njudge them.' At that time I did not know Mr. Reeve; but I recollect the\r\nwords perfectly. Pray give my best compliments to Mrs. Reeve, and believe\r\nme very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nSOPHIE.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Russell to Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_December 9th_.--I was much interested in C. Greville's Memoirs. He is not\r\na bit too severe on George IV. A worse man has not lived in our time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of the papers criticised the work in a hostile and\r\nviolent manner. It was, they said, a breach of official confidence for a\r\nman in Greville's position to keep a journal at all. Greville--whose name\r\nit was fatally easy to rhyme to Devil--was described as a man delighting in\r\nlistening at keyholes, and habitually misrepresenting the only half-heard\r\nsecrets. Here is a specimen; one epigram out of many, all to the same\r\neffect, and all ending with the same rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  For fifty years he listened at the door,\r\n  And heard some secrets, and invented more;\r\n  These he wrote down, and statesmen, queens and kings,\r\n  Are all degraded into common things.\r\n  Though most have passed away, some still remain\r\n  To whom such scandal gives a needless pain;\r\n  And though they smile, and say 'Tis only Greville,'\r\n  They wish him, Reeve, and Longman at the devil.\r\n\r\nThe 'Quarterly Review,' too, in a peculiarly venomous article, compared\r\nthe relative positions of Greville and Reeve with those of Bolingbroke and\r\nMallet, as painted by Dr. Johnson. Bolingbroke, he had said, was a cowardly\r\nblackguard, who loaded a gun which he was afraid to fire off himself, and\r\nleft a shilling to a beggarly Scotchman to pull the trigger after his\r\ndeath. The inference was inevitable; and though Reeve was neither a\r\nScotchman nor a beggar, he unquestionably felt the sting, coming, as it\r\ndid, from a friend of more than forty years' standing, Abraham Hayward\r\n[Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. pp. 12, 34.]. The friendship was not\r\nunnaturally broken, nor does the old intimacy appear to have been ever\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nOf course the gravamen of this charge, made not only by the 'Quarterly\r\nReview,' but by other less distinguished journals, was that Reeve had been\r\nmainly, if not solely, influenced by the idea of making a good thing out of\r\nit. The sale of the work--they said--was very great. Commercially, it had\r\nbeen a brilliant success. Reeve's trained insight into literary affairs had\r\nshown him that it must be so, and, tempted by the _auri sacra fames_, he\r\nhad yielded, maugre the counsels of his better part. Never was charge more\r\nunjust, more untrue. Reeve, though not a wealthy man, was now in easy\r\ncircumstances, with a sufficient and assured income. Prudent in the\r\nmanagement of his property and in his expenditure he seems to have always\r\nbeen; but as far removed, both by temperament and education, from parsimony\r\nas from extravagance. Money he valued only for what it could give him; and\r\nboth in fact and in sentiment he was in a position to say with the poet--\r\n\r\n      mihi parva rura et\r\n  Spiritum Graias tenuem Camoenae\r\n  Parca non mendax dedit, et malignum\r\n    Spernere vulgus.\r\n\r\nStill, the charge was made at the time, was currently repeated, and\r\nhas been believed by many. It happens, however, that the most complete\r\ncontradiction of it remains in the shape of Reeve's letters to Mr. T.\r\nLongman, some of which we can now read.\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 7th_.--Nothing could end better for me than the amicable\r\ndiscussion with H. Farquhar, and I am exceedingly glad to have had an\r\nopportunity of writing the letter which appears in the 'Times' and 'Post'\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nI have never desired to make this book a source of profit to myself, beyond\r\na reasonable remuneration for the time and labour I have spent on it.\r\nThe returns have already exceeded my expectation and desire. It is not,\r\ntherefore, my wish or intention to press or urge the sale of the book. I\r\nhave no doubt the second edition will go off fast enough--indeed a good\r\npart of it is already bespoken. But I have not at all made up my mind to\r\nproceed to a third edition if the second is exhausted. I am inclined to\r\nthink I shall hold my hand. I have no wish to make more money out of the\r\nbook, or to make it a very common popular work; and my feeling is that I\r\nshould best consult my own dignity by leaving matters as they are, at any\r\nrate for the present.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is needless to decide this now, as the demand for a third\r\nedition may never arise. But I think it right to let you know my view of\r\nthe matter, because you are by no means called upon to advertise largely,\r\nor make efforts to extend the sale--at least, not more than you think\r\nnecessary to cover your own interests. But I believe you would be sure to\r\nsell this second edition without any advertising at all. I certainly do not\r\nwish to have any puffing advertisements. I had rather that the book were to\r\nbecome scarce and dear than that you should sell ten thousand copies.\r\n\r\n_November 9th_.--There is a good deal of truth in what you say about not\r\npublishing a third edition if the second is sold off. People would probably\r\nattribute it to the wrong motive, and say I had been stopped in some\r\nway, or was afraid; and nobody gets any credit for disinterestedness.\r\nFortunately the first edition was a very small one, for you could have sold\r\n5,000 as easily as 2,500, and this has given a check to the sale, which I\r\ndo not regret. If necessary, I suppose these editions must go on as long as\r\nthere is a demand for the book. But the desire to get hold of new books is\r\na short-lived passion, and is soon turned aside by some other novelty. I\r\nshall not wish to publish the book at all in a cheaper form, and I think it\r\nwill require very little outlay in advertising.\r\n\r\nReeve would, however, have been more than human if the continued success\r\nof the book had not greatly modified his views, and reconciled him to the\r\nsteady sale; and some months later he wrote again:--\r\n\r\n_January 25th_, 1875.--The general impression seems to be that Hayward's\r\narticle is a fiasco. It has done me no harm, and his clients have no reason\r\nto thank him. The fourth edition of Greville will contain a good many\r\nimprovements and corrections, and will be the best edition to keep. I\r\nbelieve they are printing 1,000. I wish they had made it 1,500, for this\r\nmultiplication of editions is troublesome, and I have no doubt that 1,500\r\nwill ultimately be sold. The book has struck root below the stratum of the\r\ncirculating libraries.\r\n\r\n_April 15th_, 1875.--Nothing seems to be wanting to the indirect\r\nadvertisement of Greville's Journals, though the usual advertisements were\r\nby my desire restricted. I do not recollect another instance of a book\r\nbeing made the subject of a hostile motion in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFOXHOLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone whose memory needs refreshing will find in the 'Edinburgh Reviews'\r\nof the next five years sufficient indication of the interest which Reeve\r\ncontinued to take in the great questions of the day, whether at home or\r\nabroad; but his private correspondence at this time is mainly devoted to\r\nsocial or literary topics. The death of Lord Clarendon in England, of M.\r\nGuizot in France, had deprived him of the living keys to the dark problems\r\nof policy, and there was no one with equal knowledge and opportunities\r\nto take their place. He was, too, in opposition. In form, at least, the\r\nprinciples of the 'Edinburgh Review' differed widely from those of\r\nthe Government; and though many things even then told of a probable\r\n_rapprochement_ of moderate Whigs and moderate Conservatives, it was still\r\nheld by most to be an extravagant dream. But even had it been otherwise,\r\nthe personal element was wanting. With Disraeli, Reeve's acquaintance was\r\nlimited; with Lord Salisbury, though on friendly terms, he had never been\r\nintimate; his intimacy with Lord Derby was of a later date. From our\r\nforeign embassies and from India, his communications were on a more\r\nfamiliar footing; but many of these took the form of articles for the\r\n'Review,' and of the rest, in view of the delicacy of the subjects\r\ndiscussed, the frankness with which they were discussed, and the\r\ncomparatively recent date, it has seemed unadvisable to publish much. The\r\nresult of all which is that during this peculiarly busy, exciting and\r\nimportant time, Reeve's available correspondence is more purely personal\r\nthan at any other period of his working life. The Journal is seldom\r\nanything else. It records here:--\r\n\r\n_October, 1874_.--M. de Jarnac was now French Ambassador, to my great\r\ndelight, as he was a very old and valued friend. The first planting at\r\nFoxholes was done in the course of this autumn, but the garden was not made\r\ntill the following spring.\r\n\r\n_November 17th_.--Dined at Lord Derby's with several of the ministers, and\r\nwas introduced to Count Schouvaloff.\r\n\r\n_20th_.--Dinner at home to the Jarnacs, Lady Derby, Lady Cowley, Lady\r\nMolesworth, Chief Justice Cockburn and A. Elliot. Several pleasant dinners\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\n_December 22nd_.--To Paris, with Christine and Hopie. Cold. On the 26th\r\nbreakfasted with the Due d'Aumale, and went with him to the Institute.\r\nEvening, Duchesse de Chartres. 27th, dined at Versailles with Thiers;\r\nMignet, Barthelémy St.-Hilaire and Vacherot. It was on this occasion that\r\nThiers related the story of the Duc d'Enghien.\r\n\r\n_January 1st_, 1875.--We dined at the Embassy for the _Jour de l'an_. While\r\nthere rain fell and the streets were covered with _verglas_. I walked with\r\ngreat difficulty to Thiers's at the Hôtel Bagration, three doors off, where\r\nthe scene was burlesque. Not a carriage could move; not a horse could\r\nstand; and the company walked home with napkins tied round their feet. [But\r\nMrs. Reeve, who was at the dinner, wrote: Our _fiacre_ managed to crawl\r\nhome with Hopie and me. Henry, who had gone to the Thiers's, returned\r\nsafely on his feet tied up in dusters. M. Thiers suggested dusters on the\r\nhands also, so as to go _à quatre pattes_; but Henry did not become a\r\nquadruped. I was horribly uneasy till he came in, but his was the ludicrous\r\nside of the question; of the tragic, I heard next day plenty of instances.]\r\n\r\n_January 3rd_.--Dined with the Duc de Nemours, and went to the Duchesse\r\nDecazes's reception. Home on the 7th.\r\n\r\n_From the Rev. G. W. Cox_ [Footnote: Now Sir George Cox, Bart.]\r\n\r\n_February 5th_.--Nothing but lack of leisure has prevented me from\r\nexpressing sooner the very hearty satisfaction and delight with which I\r\nhave read and re-read your article on Mill's Essays. I suppose it is this\r\narticle which has sent the 'Edinburgh' into a second edition. I am rejoiced\r\nto think that it is so. The ground which you take is, I feel sure,\r\nimpregnable; but the force of your whole argument, which is much what I\r\nhave tried to work out for years past, only makes me lament the more\r\nthe folly of the line taken by most of the writers who shrink from the\r\nmaterialistic and atheistic philosophy of Mill and Tyndall--for the latter\r\nseems to put himself into the same boat. I believe that the thought of\r\nEngland is, on this subject, taking, or is likely to take, a very healthy\r\nturn, which such an article as yours must greatly promote.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\nParis, February 5th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I have received your article on Mr. Stuart Mill, for which\r\nI thank you. I read it with the greatest interest, and congratulate you on\r\nyour vigorous refutation of that supercilious and hollow materialism. I am\r\nglad, too, to see that you have profited by M. Dumas's last discourse on M.\r\nde la Rive. You have done well to record these declarations of a permanent\r\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences. Unfortunately, M. Dumas's character\r\nhas not the moral authority which is desirable in such serious matters.\r\nHis taking part in public business, far from increasing his credit, has\r\nlessened it; even his scientific standing has suffered; people doubt his\r\nsincerity; and his interested flattery of the Empire does not show that\r\ngreatness and purity of soul which inspire confidence. He is, however,\r\neverywhere recognised as a man of great ability, and I am truly glad that\r\nhe should be counted among the partisans of spiritualism. I believe the\r\nother permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences is far from sharing\r\nthese opinions; and it is, therefore, all the more important that M. Dumas\r\nshould profess them publicly. With you, materialism is an exception and\r\nan eccentricity. With us, on the contrary, it is almost the rule of the\r\nlearned world; and the Catholic clergy, given up to superstition and\r\nultramontanism, do not in any way help us to combat it. It was an honour to\r\nthe 'Edinburgh Review' to adhere so stoutly to the principles you uphold;\r\nand for this, it is indebted to you.\r\n\r\nAgréez, mon cher Reeve, mes salutations bien cordiales, que je présente\r\naussi à toute votre famille. Votre bien dévoué,\r\n\r\nB. ST.-HILAIRE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n_March 6th_--Sir Arthur Helps died. [He caught a chill at the levee on the\r\nMonday, and died on the Saturday.]\r\n\r\nCharles Peel was appointed Clerk of the Council.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Jarnac died--a great loss. I drove down with Lord Derby to the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n_April 1st_.--Saw Salvini in 'Othello' at Drury Lane. Very fine.\r\n\r\n_2nd_.--To Christchurch. Roof on house at Foxholes. Garden beginning to be\r\nmade. On the 6th, lunched with the Lord Chancellor at Bournemouth. Bought\r\nadditional strip of land.\r\n\r\n_From Professor Owen_\r\n\r\nBritish Museum, May 13th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--Two portraits would be famous and instructive and replete\r\nwith interest to all ages; to wit: the one of Miss Reeve (?) [Footnote:\r\nLady Smith. The (?) presumably is whether the portrait was taken before or\r\nafter her marriage.] by Opie, showing the 'human face divine' in a\r\nfemale of the highest race of mankind, at her prime of beauty; and the\r\nsecond--could it but be got--by Millais, of Lady Smith, giving the\r\ncharacteristics of the same face, of the same individual, at a stage of\r\nhuman life never again likely to be a subject for art, under the same\r\ncircumstances. For the 'Natural History of the Human Species,' such a\r\npair of portraits would be notable in every work thereon, as well as in\r\ncountless collateral works; and that to all time. The present opportunity\r\nis worth every exertion to availment; if lost, it is most improbable that\r\nit may ever again occur. Can you enlist your sympathy and aid in bringing\r\nthis about? [Footnote: Sir Richard Owen succeeded in obtaining a pair of\r\nphotographs, taken from the Ople and the life. His grandson, the Rev.\r\nRichard Owen, has them now.]\r\n\r\nYours always truly,\r\n\r\nRICHARD OWEN.\r\n\r\n_From Lady Smith_\r\n\r\n_Lowestoft, May 14th_.--Dear Mr. Reeve,--As we know not what the morning\r\nmail may bring forth, I look with impatient curiosity when I see letters\r\non my breakfast table; so yesterday had the great pleasure of perceiving\r\nyours, knowing I should have something pleasant to hear, but little\r\nanticipating what followed--the news of Arthur Stanley. To be remembered\r\nkindly by the Dean of Westminster, anywhere, is honour; but to be [so] in\r\nso distinguished a manner and in a place dedicated to [such] a name as Fox\r\nis an honour never to be forgotten. Besides the domestic blessings I enjoy,\r\nI also reckon that of living to witness the progress of a new Reformation,\r\nin which the Dean of Westminster is the brightest light; and who, like\r\nShakespeare among the poets, stood on a higher pedestal than they--exalted\r\nand good men as they are. I always rejoice that the Dean of Christ Church,\r\nOxford, and Stanley are good friends and worthy of each other. If I could\r\nwrite better, I would tell you what my friend Mr. Leson Smith said of the\r\nGreville Memoirs,, quite approving all of it. In a second letter he turns\r\nthe shafts aimed at yourself upon the calumniator. The Dean of Oxford\r\nalso approves. I am in better health than I was two years since, and have\r\nnothing to complain of but a failing sight, which hinders my expressions of\r\ngratitude to you for your friendship to Pleasance Smith.\r\n\r\nOh that you were here to see the wild beauty of the heath and dunes--a\r\ncloth of gold far as the eye can reach!--what was the Field of Cloth of\r\nGold to this!\r\n\r\nContinuing the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_May 20th_.--Went to Holland, by Harwich, to see the Queen. Dined with Her\r\nMajesty at the House in the Wood. On the 24th, breakfasted with the Queen\r\nin the boudoir at the end of the Gallery in the Wood. Charming spring\r\nmorning. Went on to Aix. Home by Ostend on the 31st.\r\n\r\n_June 15th_.--Helen Richardson was married to Sir Edward Blackett at\r\nOttershaw. We went down the day before.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--The Queen of Holland came to London. Dined with Her Majesty at the\r\nSandbachs' on July 1st. She came to see the statue of Lord Clarendon at the\r\nForeign Office on July 2nd.\r\n\r\n_July 6th._--I took the Queen of Holland to see the Novar pictures. Meadows\r\nTaylor stayed with us. Christine went to take the waters of St.-Honoré in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nRobert Lemon [Footnote: Son of Robert Lemon, a clerk in the State Paper\r\nOffice, and editor of some of the Calendars of State Papers, who died in\r\n1867.], my clerk for thirty-three years, died in a fit.\r\n\r\nReeve deeply felt the loss of one who had been for so long associated with\r\nhim; but, independently of this, Mr. Lemon's death at this particular time\r\nhad an important influence on Reeve's immediate future. For some months he\r\nhad been contemplating retiring from the office, which he had now held for\r\nclose on forty years, in the view of devoting himself more exclusively to\r\nliterary work--apparently to a task of some magnitude. He had also been in\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Longman on a proposal from the firm that he should\r\nact as their literary adviser; and thus, after long consideration he had,\r\non July 5th, mentioned, in a semi-official manner, his wish to retire in\r\nOctober. On July 6th he wrote to Mr. Longman, provisionally accepting the\r\noffer of the firm; but the next day had to write again--\r\n\r\nWhat a world is this! On Monday I told the Duke [of Richmond] I would\r\nresign on October 25th. Yesterday evening, my chief clerk, Robert Lemon,\r\nhad an apoplectic fit, and he died in the course of last night. He was a\r\nmost excellent and valuable assistant to me, and I looked forward to him\r\nto drill in my successor. It may now become impossible for me to leave the\r\noffice as soon as I meant to do, for poor Lemon and myself are the only two\r\nmen who know the detail of the business, and I can't leave the department\r\nderelict.\r\n\r\nIt is a most melancholy and distressing occurrence.\r\n\r\n_July 14th_.--It is clear that the vacancy which has occurred in this\r\noffice will detain me here six months, and perhaps a year longer than\r\nI wished or intended. This being so, our arrangements must remain in\r\nabeyance, with entire liberty to you to renew or withdraw your offer. At\r\nthis distance of time it is superfluous to discuss details, but if I accept\r\nthe duties you propose to me, I should of course adapt my movements and\r\nresidence to the exigency of the case. At present, I find my work here\r\nvastly increased, because I have to look more to the detail of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe contemplated arrangement was thus postponed for the time, and was not\r\nagain taken up in that form. Reeve continued--as he had long done--to act\r\nas confidential adviser to the firm; but he remained at the Council Office\r\nfor another twelve years, and when he ultimately retired, it was not with\r\nthe view of undertaking any heavy additional work. The Journal goes on:--\r\n\r\n_August 2nd_.--To Paris. Met Christine at Dijon on the 3rd. Then by Dole to\r\nVevay. Binet came. Met the Wodehouses. Visit to the Blumenthals at their\r\n_chalet_. 13th, to the Gorges du Trient, and so to Chamonix, with Binet\r\nand Christine. Splendid weather at Chamonix. 16th, St. Martin's; full moon\r\nrising behind Mont Blanc. 17th, to Chambéry, St. Laurent du Pont, and the\r\nGrande Chartreuse--very interesting. Geneva on the 20th, and back to Vevay\r\non the 21st. Thence to Besançon, Belfort, and Nancy. 27th, Metz. Drove\r\nround the fields of battle of Gravelotte and St. Privat. To Brussels, by\r\nLuxembourg. Bought furniture at Brussels for Foxholes. Home by Antwerp on\r\nSeptember 1st.\r\n\r\n_October 7th_.--To Bournemouth, to look over Foxholes. 26th, Timsbury.\r\n\r\n_November 20th_.--House nearly finished. Christmas at Farnborough. The\r\nworkmen left Foxholes on December 28th.\r\n\r\nThe Government bought the Khedive's shares in the Suez Canal. I attacked\r\nthe bargain in the 'Edinburgh Review.'\r\n\r\nBut from the earliest inception of the Suez Canal, Reeve had strongly\r\nopposed it. He held, and in fact all history warranted him in holding,\r\nthat the opening of a water-way through the isthmus would be more than\r\nprejudicial, would be destructive, to English interests. He was very far\r\nfrom being alone in this opinion; it was one which he shared with several\r\nof the most able and experienced men of the day, quite irrespective of\r\nparty. France, on her side, indulged in golden dreams. The wealth and\r\ngrandeur of mediaeval Venice was to find its counterpart in the commercial\r\nprosperity of Marseilles; and it is permitted us to believe that much of\r\nthe enthusiasm which the scheme excited was due to the hope that it would\r\nirretrievably damage England. Hence, too, the ill will rising out of the\r\ndisappointment, out of the conviction forced on the people of France that,\r\nfar from injuring us, it has turned out altogether to our advantage. French\r\nskill constructed the canal, French capital paid for it. England stood\r\naloof till success was achieved, and then hastened to reap the profit;\r\nthen, by buying up the shares, doubled that profit; and since then, by the\r\noccupation of Egypt, has usurped the control of the whole. Never has there\r\nbeen such a case of the _Sic vos non vobis_; and the French are very\r\nangry. Reeve's constant and familiar intercourse with French society had\r\nnecessarily taught him the opinions so universally held in France, and had\r\npersuaded him that the only safe plan for England was to have nothing to do\r\nwith the pestilent thing. Disraeli, on the other hand, with a wider grasp\r\nof the situation, understood that, in this, at any rate, inactivity was\r\nnot masterly, and that by boldness the enemy would be hoist with their own\r\npetard.\r\n\r\n_From Lady Smith_\r\n\r\nLowestoft, December 5th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--It gave me pleasure to see your handwriting again, and\r\nsome surprise. In the first place, I must mention that I think you would\r\nprefer Opie's original portrait to that which I possess, which, though by\r\nOpie, is the copy of my portrait. When I last saw the original picture it\r\nwas in the Royal Academy; where it is now, I do not know; but [that] may\r\nperhaps be ascertained. I must add that from its long residence in\r\nLondon it looked very dingy, and required a refreshment from some good\r\npicture-mender, and fresh varnish. If this picture is not come-at-able, I\r\nshall be happy to send that I have here, of which you will acquaint me, and\r\nsend particular directions of the place and time it may be expected.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear you, and Mrs. Reeve, and my amiable young friend your\r\ndaughter are well. I hear you are building a superb mansion at Bournemouth;\r\na charming place, I have no doubt. My kind regards to you and them, from\r\nyour attached friend, PLEASANCE SMITH.\r\n\r\nVery sorry am I to hear of Lady Augusta Stanley's hopeless illness, and\r\nhappy am I to observe the Dean's perpetual vigour. Long may he continue to\r\nillume the realm of mist in that Temple of Reconciliation where his light\r\nshines in so brilliant a lustre. In what a remarkable period do we live!\r\n\r\nThe picture by Opie was exhibited from Mr. Botfield's [Footnote: Beriah\r\nBotfield, of Deckel's Hill, Shiffnal, Shropshire, and Grosvenor Square;\r\ndied 1863.] collection (at one of the Old Masters' Exhibitions) about nine\r\nor ten years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_January 1876_.--I meant to go to Paris, but gout came on, and I gave it\r\nup.\r\n\r\n_March 28th_.--Sent down furniture, &c. by vans to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_April 2nd_.--Took possession of Foxholes; cold and windy, and I gouty.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, April 19th_.--Lady Holland has written me a note quite as\r\namiable as her brother, and all the family seem to be satisfied with my\r\narticle. The little crack of the whip just nicked the fly on Abraham's ear.\r\nA touch is often more keenly felt than a blow, when dealt in the right\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe only fault to be found with living here is that life glides away too\r\nrapidly, and I feel as if I should hardly have time to read over again the\r\nworks of the Immortals, before I go to join them.\r\n\r\nWe have just got a splendid billiard table, and Hopie and I intersperse\r\ncannons and winning hazards with literature.\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_April 27th_.--Returned to town. Very bad fit of gout. This was the year\r\nof my grand climacteric (sixty-three), and I was uncommonly ill. I went to\r\nAix, May 30th; but was worse there, and came back, June 19th.\r\n\r\n_July 7th_.--Garden party at Holland House; the only thing I was able to go\r\nto this year from incessant gout.\r\n\r\n_12th_.--Came down to Foxholes. Great heat; no rain from April till August.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate, April 28th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Lord Derby,--I cannot forbear to express to you our very great\r\nand cordial sympathy in the great loss you have sustained.[Footnote: The\r\nDowager Countess of Derby died on April 26th, 1876.] It was Gray, I think,\r\nwho said that a man can have but one mother, and in losing her one loses\r\nthe only real witness of the tenderest part of the growth of life. Nobody\r\nelse has any memory for infancy, childhood and youth, and no one else has\r\nthe same claims to dutiful affection. The loss is irreparable. I find it so\r\nmyself every day. Lady Derby had the happiness to see you combine with the\r\nmost affectionate regard for her the public duties and honours which are\r\nalmost hereditary in your family. Few women have seen life played out on a\r\nnobler scale. She was the link between two generations of statesmen,\r\nand lived in the entire intimacy and affection of both. But these\r\nconsiderations cannot alleviate sorrow!\r\n\r\nWith every assurance of sincere regard to yourself and Lady Derby from Mrs.\r\nReeve and myself, believe me, always faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nH. Reeve.\r\n\r\nContinuing the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_August 12th_.--Disraeli made Earl Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\n_14th_.--From Southampton to Havre and Rouen with Christine and Hopie.\r\nDined with the Cardinal de Bonnechose; Circourt joined us there.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--To the Château d'Eu; found there the Duc de Montpensier and\r\nInfanta Christine, Duc and Duchesse de Chartres, Mme. de Rainneville and\r\nLambert de Sainte-Croix. Drive in forest; very hot.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--Celebrated our silver wedding at Eu. To Dieppe and back by Havre\r\non the 24th. William Longman came to Foxholes. Saw Lady Charlotte Bacon\r\n[Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. p. 88.] again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reeve gave 'Ianthe,' whom they met at a luncheon party at Bournemouth,\r\na fuller notice. She wrote, 'A bad husband and narrow means kept her out of\r\nEngland for thirty-five years or so, and she is now a corpulent matron of\r\nseventy, with no trace of those charms sung by the poet.'\r\n\r\nAll this autumn an immense agitation was kept up, chiefly by Gladstone,\r\non the 'Bulgarian Atrocities.' Meetings were held all over the kingdom. I\r\npublished an article in the 'Review' in October, which Lord Derby said was\r\nthe first thing that turned the tide. It soon turned altogether; and in a\r\nfew months the people were as anxious to attack the Russians as they had\r\nbeen to coerce the Turks.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Dempster\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 17th._--Can you, who know all the genealogies of\r\nScotland better than the Red Lion himself, tell me what relation Countess\r\nPurgstall was to Dugald Stewart? [Footnote: She was his wife's sister.] I\r\nknow she was a Cranstoun; but was she related to the great Professor? When\r\nmy father was in Vienna in 1805, she received him very kindly, because he\r\nhad known Dugald Stewart, and followed his lectures in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nI enjoy my life here above all things. Four months have slipped away in\r\nthis Olympian calm, between the sea and the sky, and I fancy that the New\r\nForest is the Highlands; but it is time to be up and doing, and next week I\r\nreturn to London, with a large stock of health and good spirits.\r\n\r\nMatters look very black in the East. I am afraid it is a deep-laid Russian\r\nplot, which Gladstone has done not a little to promote and encourage. You\r\nwill see that I have held to my own line in the Blue and Yellow.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. T. Longman\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, November 1st._--I have a great dislike to the proposal of\r\nreprinting an article of my own in a cheap form. It seems to me to be\r\ndescending to the level of Mr. Gladstone's sixpenny agitation. Moreover,\r\nthe political situation is now considerably altered. Many things which\r\nwere said hypothetically on October 12th have assumed a different shape on\r\nNovember 1st. But if any arrangement can be made to supply the Mayor of\r\nBristol with one hundred copies of the 'Review,' at a cheap rate, I shall\r\nbe very glad of it. The cheap republication of the attractive article would\r\nbe just as injurious to booksellers who have copies of the 'Review' on hand\r\nas the distribution of copies of the 'Review.' Both measures interfere with\r\nthe regular course of sale, and are therefore mischievous.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_January 23rd_, 1877.--The Folkestone (Ritualist) case [Footnote: Ridsdale\r\n_v._ Clifton and others. See _Times_, January 24th and following days.\r\nJudgement, _Times_, July 19th.] heard by the Judicial Committee, by eleven\r\nprivy councillors, and five bishops. It lasted nearly a fortnight.\r\n\r\n_January 24th_.--Christine and I went to pay a visit to the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Cleveland at Battle Abbey. It was singularly interesting and\r\nagreeable. Nothing could exceed the vivacity of the Duchess, or her\r\nattention to her guests. The party consisted of Maud Stanley, Charles\r\nNewton, Banks-Stanhope, Raglan Somerset, and the Mercer Hendersons.\r\n\r\nI have known the Duke these forty years, having first met him at the\r\nDuchesse de Mailly's, in Paris, about the year 1836. He is the only\r\nEnglishman I ever knew who is perfectly at home in the best French society,\r\nand as Lord Harry Vane he was extremely popular in Paris. There is now\r\nnobody living who has known so many of my oldest and best friends--most of\r\nwhom are now no more--both in Paris, Geneva, and London; and our talk of\r\nthese old times was most abundant.\r\n\r\nBattle Abbey is certainly one of the most curious and beautiful remains in\r\nEngland, and as it was built on the morrow of the Conquest (1067), it\r\nis astonishing how much remains. The present drawing-room is a long,\r\nlow-arched room, with Gothic arches springing from columns of Purbeck\r\nmarble. Much of the great refectory and part of the cloisters still\r\nremains. This is part of the original building of William the Conqueror.\r\nThe great gateway and outer wall is of the time of Edward III. The great\r\nhall is about two hundred years old. The Abbey was given by Henry VIII. to\r\nSir Anthony Browne, and afterwards purchased in 1722 by the Websters, from\r\nwhom the Duke of Cleveland bought it a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess drove us over to call at Ashburnham, about three miles on the\r\nother side of Battle. There we saw a most beautiful Sir Joshua of Lady St.\r\nAsaph (the present Earl's grandmother) and the shirt King Charles wore on\r\nthe day of his execution. Lady Ashburnham told us that old women had,\r\nin our time, asked for leave to spread the cloth which is with it over\r\nchildren to cure the King's evil.\r\n\r\nLord Ashburnham [Footnote: He died in June 1878, in his eighty-first\r\nyear.] is himself a sight--a man of eighty, in high boots, very deaf, very\r\ncaustic, and clever; possessing under lock and key most wonderful literary\r\ntreasures and curiosities. He gave 3,000 £ for a manuscript bible, but that\r\nwe did not see.\r\n\r\n_February 3rd_--Lady Smith died at Lowestoft, aged 103 and 9 months.\r\n\r\n_March 13th_--Tennyson dined at The Club; Archbishop and Chancellor there.\r\n\r\n_16th_--To Foxholes. April 14th, back to town.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Miss Agnes Clerke--who has since come into the\r\nforemost rank as a popular exponent of science and as the biographer of\r\nits votaries--was making her _début_ in literature, and contributed two\r\narticles to the 'Edinburgh Review,' the one in April on 'Brigandage in\r\nSicily,' and the other, which appeared in July, on 'Copernicus in Italy,'\r\nsubjects which her residence in Italy had brought more immediately under\r\nher notice. Just before the publication of the first of these Reeve wrote\r\nto her, introducing M. de Circourt, who was then at Florence where Miss\r\nClerke was. A fortnight later he wrote again in answer to her reply.\r\n\r\nRutland Gate, April 19th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Miss Clerke,--It gives me very sincere pleasure to have contributed\r\nto introduce you to your first literary success. I hope it may be the\r\nprelude to many more. I can hardly venture to recommend to you the course\r\nin which you should steer your bark. On scientific subjects I am very\r\nignorant, but there has been an article in the 'Review' on Spectrum\r\nAnalysis, by Professor Roscoe, and another on the Transit of Venus last\r\nyear. You have the advantage of seeing before your eyes the intellectual\r\n_renaissance_ of Italy, and it has already supplied you with two very good\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that before October something else may turn up. If not, I\r\nwill send you a book from England to review--for instance, Miss Wynne's\r\nLetters and Journals, which are being printed, and will come out in\r\nOctober. Miss Wynne was a delightful person, who lived in the society of\r\nParis, when it was most agreeable. M. de Circourt is the last survivor of\r\nit--unless I may be reckoned a survivor too. I am glad you appreciate him.\r\nHe was private secretary to M. de Polignac in 1830, and married in 1832 an\r\nincomparable Russian--Mlle. de Klustine. They used to say that she knew\r\nseventeen languages and he eighteen. She died some years ago from a\r\nburn, and Circourt now passes his life chiefly with Mme. d'Affry and her\r\ndaughter, the Duchess Colonna.\r\n\r\nI have another cousin (besides Mrs. Ross) who passes her winters in\r\nFlorence, or near it--Mrs. James Whittle. She is a great invalid, and never\r\ngoes out. But she is now returning to a Schloss (Syrgenstein) they have in\r\nBavaria. ... You are right. I have left my hill, which overlooks the great\r\nseaway between the Needles and Hengistbury Head, and come to London for the\r\nnext three months; but I had much rather stay in my hermitage. London is as\r\ndisagreeable as an east wind can make it. Believe me,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_April 25th_--Lord Derby gave a great dinner at the F.O. I sat between\r\nStirling-Maxwell and Pender.\r\n\r\n_May 9th_--Lord Derby presided at the Literary Fund dinner. I proposed the\r\nhealth of the Chinese Ambassador. I retired this year from the council of\r\nthe Literary Fund.\r\n\r\n_18th_--Went to Paris alone. 20th, long interview with the Duc Decazes.\r\nDined at the Embassy. Thiers in the evening.\r\n\r\n_May 22nd_--Dinner at Laugel's. [Footnote: The Duc d'Aumale's secretary.]\r\nDuc de Broglie, Duc Decazes, Chabaud-Latour and the Haussonvilles. The\r\n'_coup d'état_ of the Marshal,' as it was called, when Macmahon turned out\r\nJules Simon and the Radicals, took place on May 16th, just before I reached\r\nParis. Hence the agitation was extreme; and at this dinner at Laugel's I\r\nhad to encounter the dukes, who wanted to know why we disapproved their\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n_23rd_.--Dined with Thiers, who was depressed. I had, however, several\r\nimportant conversations with him during this visit, of which I took a note.\r\nHe expected to become president again. If that had happened, much would\r\nhave been altered, but he died on September 3rd.\r\n\r\n_28th_.--Back to London. Related to Lord Derby what Thiers said.\r\n\r\n_31st_.--Severe gale. To Foxholes for a day on June 2nd.\r\n\r\n_June 12th_.--The Duc d'Aumale came over to dine with The Club.\r\n\r\n_19th_.--Mrs. Oliphant's party to Maga at Runnymead [to celebrate her 25th\r\nyear of alliance with 'Blackwood's Magazine.' A lovely day, and an amusing\r\nparty of littérateurs, publishers, writers, &c.]\r\n\r\n_July 19th_.--Came down to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_October 18th_.--London to Durham, with Hopie. Durham Cathedral. 19th,\r\nto Matfen (Sir E. Blackett's); 24th, to Yester (Lord Tweeddale's) by\r\nEdinburgh; 29th, to Ormiston; and 31st to Minto. Back to town on November\r\n3rd. Some London dinners.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 8th_.--There ought to be, in the January number, an\r\narticle on the Organisation of the Liberal Party. I have asked several\r\nleading politicians of the party to undertake it, but in vain. The truth\r\nis, that it is a very thankless and hopeless subject; and the recent\r\ndiscussion of the county franchise by Lowe and Gladstone renders it still\r\nmore difficult. I put my own opinions wholly out of the question, and\r\nshould give _carte blanche_ to any competent and accredited writer to treat\r\nthe subject. I think I shall ask Lord Hartington what he wishes to be done.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is that this county franchise move is suicidal to the\r\nLiberal party, and I clearly perceive that the Tories are preparing--when\r\nsomewhat hard pressed--to take up and carry some such measure, accompanied\r\nby a redistribution of seats that will swamp a great many Liberal boroughs.\r\nThey say, If the thing is to be done, we had better do it....\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that Gladstone published his article, which points\r\nto universal suffrage, in order to cut the ground from under Hartington's\r\nfeet at the Scotch meetings. Hitherto Whig principles and the whole Whig\r\nparty have been decidedly opposed to an unrestricted franchise.\r\n\r\n_C.O., November 15th_--Lord Granville is so cautious and reserved a man\r\nthat it is impossible to extract any definite opinion or advice from him.\r\nI have tried repeatedly, and I never got so much as a hint from him worth\r\nanything How different from Lord Clarendon or Lord Aberdeen! The truth is\r\nthat Granville is always waiting upon fortune; ready to take any course\r\nthat may turn up, but utterly incapable of taking a strong resolution based\r\non principle and conviction....\r\n\r\nI dare say May's book will have success. It is very well written; but it\r\nis not what I expected. It is an historical survey of the political\r\ninstitutions of all nations, 'from China to Peru,' executed with care and\r\ngreat reading; but there are no traces of original thought, and it leaves\r\nyou exactly where you were before in relation to the democratic element in\r\nsociety. Bagehot's books have ten times as much _thought_ in them.\r\n\r\nA most excellent book, which I am reading with great delight, is Mr.\r\nGardiner's 'Reign of Charles I. before the Rebellion.' It is, to me, as\r\ninteresting as Macaulay, and singularly impartial.\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal winds up the year with:--\r\n\r\n_December 12th_--To Foxholes. Christmas at Farnborough. [Mrs. Reeve wrote\r\non December 24th: We start this morning for Farnborough Hill. It is now\r\neighteen years that we have spent Christmas with the Longmans.] Back to\r\nFoxholes.\r\n\r\n1878.--We spent the first week of the New Year at Foxholes, the weather\r\ncharming, and returned to London on January 11th.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, January 7th._--I know the authoress of the Russian letters very\r\nwell. She is one of the boldest and keenest Russian agents in Europe, who\r\nwas sent here three or four years ago to endeavour to prepare English\r\nsociety for the coming war, and she has returned here every winter. She has\r\nmade repeated attempts to capture me, though, as you may suppose, without\r\nsuccess. But on politicians of a sentimental cast her influence has been\r\nconsiderable, especially on Gladstone, who is singularly amenable to female\r\nflattery, and a perfect child in the hands of a clever _intrigante_ of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut I am certainly sorry that Froude should have attached his name to her\r\nletters. To suppose that this great and dreadful war has been undertaken\r\nfor the sole purpose of 'liberating' the Southern Slavs, and that the\r\nRussians hate the Turks because the Tartars conquered Russia some centuries\r\nback, are assumptions which can hardly impose on the most credulous of men.\r\nThis is a war of conquest, and the spirit of the Crusades has been evoked\r\nto stimulate an ignorant and enthusiastic people.\r\n\r\nOne of the points of the Russian party in England is to denounce and\r\nmisrepresent the Crimean war. That war was carried on in defence of great\r\nprinciples of European law--not for the sake of the Turks--by the statesmen\r\nto whom we are particularly attached--Palmerston, Clarendon, Russell,\r\nLewis, Panmure, &c. Mr. Carlyle, Froude, Freeman, Goldwin Smith, Bright,\r\nand at last Gladstone, were opposed to it. I adhere to the views of the\r\nstatesmen, which the 'Review' defended in 1854 and 1855. I am, therefore,\r\nextremely glad, and think it highly proper and necessary that the Queen\r\nshould defend the course taken by her ministers and by the nation at that\r\ntime; and it would be the excess of inconsistency in the 'Review' not to\r\nmaintain, as a matter of history, the same principles for which we have\r\ninvariably contended.\r\n\r\n_C. O., January 12th_.--One of the first persons I met on coming to London\r\nyesterday was Lord Granville, and I had a long talk with him. He was less\r\nreserved than usual. I don't know that there is any difference in our view\r\nof the foreign question, except that he thinks the Government should have\r\nsaid and done even less than they have done. But the disposition of many\r\nof the moderate Whigs, such as Lord Morley, Duke of Bedford, Duke of\r\nCleveland, &c., is to support the foreign policy of the Government. The\r\nDuke of Sutherland is to dine at Disraeli's dinner, out of hatred of\r\nGladstone. I believe Dizzy is to have the Garter!\r\n\r\nLord Granville said, 'I saw that the last article in the last number of the\r\n\"E. Review\" was _not_ Reeve. It might have been written by a contributor to\r\nthe \"Daily Telegraph.\"' To this I replied: 'It was written, in fact, by a\r\nvery intimate friend of your own, who was, I think, staying at Walmer last\r\nsummer; a man of great experience in political writing, not for the \"D. T.\"\r\nbut for the \"Times;\" and, although I don't think it a good article, and\r\ndiffer from many things in it, I thought myself pretty safe in the hands of\r\nSir George Dasent.' It was amusing to see G.'s look of astonishment.\r\n\r\nPolitically, the topic of 1878 was the settlement of the Russo-Turkish war.\r\nThe fall of Plevna in the previous December, and the subsequent collapse of\r\nTurkey, led to the advance of the Russians to San Stefano and the treaty\r\nof March 3rd, which seemed a direct step towards the seizure of\r\nConstantinople, and the swallowing up of the Turkish Empire. In England\r\npublic feeling ran very high, but, unfortunately, in opposing currents.\r\nThe Government was resolved, at all risks, to prevent the extreme result\r\nforeshadowed by the Treaty of San Stefano, and to do so by acting on the\r\n_si vis pacem, para bellum_ principle. In the East, the Mediterranean fleet\r\nwas ordered to pass the Dardanelles and to anchor in the Sea of Marmora;\r\nwhilst at home, a vote of credit to the amount of 6,000,000£. was rapidly\r\npassed through Parliament, the navy was strengthened, the army reserves\r\nwere called out, and the initial preparations were made for the despatch of\r\nan expeditionary force. And at this time what threatened to be a serious\r\nblow to the Ministry, in reality strengthened it. Lord Derby, the foreign\r\nsecretary, resigned, possibly influenced, it was said, by personal intimacy\r\nwith Count Schouvaloff, and in any case disapproving of the measures of the\r\nGovernment. He was succeeded by the Marquis of Salisbury, who, in June,\r\naccompanied Lord Beaconsfield to Berlin to attend the Congress, from which\r\nthey returned on July 16th, bringing back, in Beaconsfield's now classical\r\nwords, 'Peace with honour.'\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Richard Doyle_\r\n\r\n7 Finborough Road, January 15th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Reeve,--When at Foxholes, in August last, I began a sketch of the\r\nview from your house. It was my intention to ask you to accept the drawing\r\nwhen complete. In the presence, however, of the very attractive original,\r\nI, on leaving, was so little satisfied with my copy that I had not the\r\nheart to say anything about it. But, after an interval, and a little more\r\nwork upon it, I begin to think that, after all, when in town, it perhaps\r\nmay remind you imperfectly of the fresh skies and blue waters left out\r\nof town. So I return to my original intention, and herewith send you the\r\nlittle drawing for your acceptance. With best remembrance to Mrs. and Miss\r\nReeve, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nRichard Doyle.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Theodore Martin_\r\n\r\n31 Onslow Square, January 16th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I have been much gratified by reading the review of my\r\nthird volume in the 'Edinburgh Review,' which my publishers have just sent\r\nme. It brings out with admirable effect the passages which bear on the\r\npresent crisis--passages which I inserted in the volume from a strong\r\nfeeling that there would be occasion to strengthen the sound view of the\r\nEastern Question by the emphatic language of the Prince Consort. God grant\r\nthey may not have come too late!\r\n\r\nWith reference, especially, to what you say at the top of page 151, I must\r\ndisabuse you of what seems to be the prevailing impression that things in\r\nthis book have been written by the direct inspiration of the Queen. Not one\r\nword of it, from beginning to end, was prompted by Her Majesty, who has\r\nleft me, from the first, unfettered, to draw my own conclusions, to select\r\nthe documents to be made public, and to state my own convictions in my own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhat I have selected and what I have written has, when printed, been\r\nsubmitted, of course, for Her Majesty's approval, which, I am happy to say,\r\nI have always had. In regard to the third volume, it was written almost\r\nentirely last summer and autumn, at my country house, where I had no\r\nopportunity of even consulting Her Majesty. Your conjecture, therefore,\r\nas to the note you cite on page 151 is a mistaken one. That note only\r\nexpresses a conviction which I have strongly felt for many years. You will,\r\non reflection, I think, see that I could not with propriety refer to the\r\ncircumstances alluded to in the note on the same page of the 'Review.' It\r\nis one of hundreds of cases where reticence seemed to myself, as, in some\r\nsense, representing Her Majesty, to be prescribed to me. When my book is\r\ncomplete, an abridged 'Life' will be published. I am sure this article\r\nmust do good by being in the hands of the public before the meeting of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, very truly yours,\r\n\r\nTHEODORE MARTIN.\r\n\r\n_January 19th_.--I have no doubt the Queen will be much pleased with the\r\n'E. R.' article. Believe me, Her Majesty's mind is far too candid and\r\nsincere to take any umbrage at what you say about the Prince's _Germanism_.\r\nShe may not think it went so far as you do; but she has always frankly\r\nacknowledged its existence, seeing, with her usual good sense, both the\r\ngood and bad effects of any extreme views. If there be any one person more\r\nthan another to whom the artificial language commonly addressed to royal\r\npersonages is distasteful, it is the Queen herself. Such at least is my\r\nexperience. I am delighted to see that the opinions of the Queen and Prince\r\nbrought forward in this volume are causing some stir in the Parisian\r\njournals. They are being used to stimulate an active interest in the\r\nEastern Question; and this, I venture to think, may produce results not\r\nunimportant at the present crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_January 25th_.--Huxley lectured on Harvey.\r\n\r\n_February 7th_.--Dinner at Dicey's, to meet Mr. Welch, the U.S. minister.\r\nJohn Bright, Hayward, Chandos Leigh, Mme. Van de Weyer there.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--To Foxholes, for three days only.\r\n\r\n_13th_.--The fleet went up the Sea of Marmora, the Russians having\r\napproached Constantinople.\r\n\r\n_28th_.--Marriage of Ellinor Locker to Lionel Tennyson in Westminster\r\nAbbey. All the literary world there. Imposing aspect of Alfred Tennyson,\r\nwho looked round the Abbey as if he felt the Immortals were his compeers.\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions:--\r\n\r\n_March 28th_.--Lord Derby resigned the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_March 29th_.--What has happened is disagreeable, as all political\r\nseparations are; but it did not seem to me that there was any choice. As to\r\ndiscussion in Parliament, I suppose I cannot altogether help myself; but it\r\nwill be a business unwillingly gone into, and not at all unless there seems\r\nsome chance of being of use.\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_April 3rd_.--Dinner at Longman's. Froude, Trevelyan, Walpoles, Quain. This\r\nwas the last of the pleasant literary dinners which Longman used to give.\r\n\r\n_4th_.--Great sale of the Novar collection. Fetched over 70,000£. Kirkman\r\nHodgson gave 20,000£. for three Turners.\r\n\r\n_April 13th_.--To Foxholes.\r\n\r\nFrom Lord Lytton [Footnote: Governor-General of India.]\r\n\r\nGovernment House, Simla, April 29th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I think you in nowise overestimate the value of Meadows\r\nTaylor's life and work in India, and I cordially recognise the exceptional\r\nclaims of the two ladies, on whose behalf you have written to me, to the\r\ngrant which I regret to hear they require. Their case is rather a difficult\r\none to deal with, owing to the fact that nearly the whole work of Meadows\r\nTaylor's life was performed, not in the service of the Government of India,\r\nbut in that of the Nizam's Government; and we are precluded, by rules as\r\ninflexible as the laws of the Medes and Persians, from granting public\r\nmoney to the distressed survivors of our own public servants on purely\r\ncompassionate grounds. In my own opinion, however, the claim of these\r\nladies may be fairly admitted on other grounds furnished by their father's\r\neminence, not only as a literary man, but also as an administrator, and the\r\nfact that his work, though not performed in the service of the Government\r\nof India, has been, and is, in various ways, unquestionably beneficial to\r\nIndia. I am glad to say that I have obtained the concurrence of my council\r\nin this view of the case, and we propose to grant 100£. a year to each of\r\nthese ladies from the Indian revenues. Our proposal, however, cannot be\r\nacted on without the sanction of the Secretary of State, to whom it will\r\nprobably be submitted by this mail; and, as it is of a financial character,\r\nI think Lord Staplehurst [Footnote: Viscount Cranbrook is meant. The patent\r\nof his peerage was not dated till May 4th; but it had been previously\r\nunderstood, and telegraphed to India, that he would take his title from\r\nStaplehurst.] cannot deal with it except through his council. It is\r\ntherefore fortunate that you have secured their suffrages, for at present\r\nit seems to be the invariable practice of the 'wise men of the East' at\r\nthe India Office to reject every proposal, however trivial or however\r\nimportant, which emanates from the Government of India.\r\n\r\nYours, my dear Mr. Reeve, very faithfully,\r\n\r\nLYTTON.\r\n\r\n_Endorsed_--The pension was granted on June 30th.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_ Château d'Eu, May 11th.\r\n\r\n... I am glad to see that the hope of peace is stronger. A war between\r\nEngland and Russia would be the greatest catastrophe that could fall\r\nupon the world at present; it would be the cause of incalculable ruin\r\neverywhere. Since the wars of 1866 and 1870 the maintenance of the peace\r\nof Europe depends solely upon the relations between England and Russia. To\r\nFrance the preservation of peace is of the deepest interest, for the day it\r\nis broken she may expect to see her own frontiers threatened by Germany,\r\neither directly or by the moral subjection of Holland, Switzerland, and\r\nBelgium. We wish no evil either to England or to Russia; but, above all\r\nthings, we wish that these two Powers should live in harmony.\r\n\r\nHere the Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_May 13th_.--Returned to town.\r\n\r\n_May 28th_.--Gladstone dined at The Club. Six present; interesting.\r\n\r\n_June 3rd_.--Excursion to Greenwich to see the telegraph works. Great\r\ndinner at the Ship afterwards.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--All to Norwich, to stay with Dean Goulburn at the Deanery. I had\r\nscarcely been there for fifty years. Dr. Jessop, Canon Heaviside, and Canon\r\nRobinson to dinner--very pleasant.\r\n\r\n_9th_.--Communion in Norwich Cathedral. 10th, drove to Costessy (Lord\r\nStafford's); 11th, to Spixworth; 12th, to Ely, on a visit to Dean Merivale;\r\n13th, to Peterborough; 14th, back to town.\r\n\r\n_June_.--Very hot weather. 26th, dinner of the Antiquaries at Lord\r\nCarnarvon's.\r\n\r\n_July 5th_.--Lady Northcote's garden party. Helen Blackett there, looking\r\nill. I never saw her again. [Footnote: See _post_. p. 265.]\r\n\r\n_July 13th_.--To Foxholes. Gout prevented me from going to Paris, where the\r\nexhibition was going on, and to La Celle.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, July 15th_.--I send just a line to say that _no part_ of the\r\narticle on 'The Constitution and the Crown' is written by me. I thought\r\nit due to the writer to leave it untouched, and I don't think it is too\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nThe article in the 'Quarterly' was certainly not written by Dr. Smith, and\r\nI have reason to know that he is a good deal ashamed of it. Nobody seems to\r\nknow who wrote it. I do not expect they will reply upon us; but nothing is\r\nmore beneficial to the two Reviews than a little controversy, especially\r\nwhen serious principles are concerned. This question is precisely the\r\n_crux_ or test of Whig and Tory principles; it is the old fight of\r\nparliamentary power against prerogative. There has not been in England, for\r\na hundred years, a minister so indifferent to Parliament and so subservient\r\nto the Court as Lord Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, July 16th_.--Dizzy's fireworks will soon burn out; and when\r\npeople come to reflect on these transactions, and their consequences,\r\nthey will be found to be some of the most questionable in modern English\r\nhistory. He has the merit of presenting a bold front to Europe and of\r\navoiding war; but the cost will be great and the ulterior consequences\r\nformidable. I suppose they are going to give him a Roman triumph this\r\nafternoon from Charing Cross to Downing Street.\r\n\r\n  Sed quid\r\n  Turba Remi?...\r\n  ...... Idem populus...\r\n  ... hac ipsa Sejanum diceret hora\r\n  Augustum.\r\n\r\nTo my old eyes all this is a sham--a scene out of 'Tancred' and 'Lothair.'\r\nDepend upon it, the article on the 'Constitution and the Crown' will be\r\nread.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, August 10th_.--I never in my life read a better article than\r\nthis of Froude on Copyright. It is incomparably good in force of argument,\r\nvigour of style, point, and truth, and, I think, will go far to settle the\r\nassailants of copyright. I confess I enjoy the smashing of the sages of\r\nthe Board of Trade and old Trevelyan. They will see that if they attack\r\nliterature, literature is able to defend itself.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_Farnborough Hill, August 14th_.--... I entirely agree with you in the\r\nexcellence of Froude's article [on Copyright]. ... I see that he thinks\r\nthat copyright may be in danger, and that the tendency of writing will\r\nflow into periodical literature. That I know has long been XIXth Century\r\nKnowles's opinion. He says he cares nothing for any copyright, and never\r\nasks for it. Like the 'Times,' he does not, in fact, need it. His writers\r\nare highly paid, and he and they are satisfied.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, August 15th_.--... No doubt any restriction of copyright in\r\npermanent works would have the effect of inducing literary men to write\r\nmore and more in periodicals, which are not permanent but well paid. This\r\nargument is very important. I am not sure that Froude has laid sufficient\r\nstress upon it. Good and solid literature already suffers considerably from\r\nthe fact that fugitive literature is far better paid, and that a literary\r\nman can rarely afford to write a large and substantial book requiring years\r\nof labour. Herbert Spencer's evidence is very interesting; but few men have\r\nthe courage to risk their all in labouring for the future.\r\n\r\nI shall make Froude's article the first in the next number, as I think it\r\nwill attract great attention.\r\n\r\n_August 24th_.--Froude's article will make nearly fifty pages of the\r\nReview, which is more than I like; but I don't know what to leave out, it\r\nis all so good and amusing to literary people, so I think we must swallow\r\nit whole.\r\n\r\nA note from the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_August 23rd_.--Visit to Highclere (Lord Carnarvon's). A good deal of gout\r\nin October. To Farnborough on the 30th. Back to town on November 4th.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 10th_.--I see the 'Quarterly' announces an article on my\r\n'Petrarch.' Unless Smith is the falsest of men, it will be a civil article,\r\nfor he was enthusiastic in his praises of the book to me personally. But I\r\nshall not be surprised if it is another flourish of Hayward's stiletto.\r\n\r\n_October 19th_.--The article in the 'Quarterly' on my 'Petrarch' is very\r\ncourteous, and certainly _not_ by Abraham.\r\n\r\n_C. O., December 2nd_.--This day's post brings me the melancholy\r\nintelligence that our friend Kirkman is so ill he is not expected to\r\nsurvive, and that dear old Mrs. Grote is in much the same condition. To me,\r\nby far the most painful part of advancing years is the loss of those who\r\nmade life delightful. It is the only thing I regret. These friendships of\r\nforty or fifty years are quite irreparable.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_December 5th_.--Parliament met. 9th, first dinner of the Club. 24th, to\r\nOttershaw Park for Christmas. 28th, to Farnborough--last time. 29th, Mrs.\r\nGrote died. 31st, returned to town.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_December 13th_.--I brought up two volumes of the MS. Journals for you to\r\nread when you come to town. But I perceive the further you proceed the less\r\ncan you publish. I dismiss all thoughts of that from my mind, and bequeath\r\nthe task to posterity.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Commons has been very dull, [Footnote: On a motion to\r\ncondemn the policy of the Government in Afghanistan. It was defeated by a\r\nmajority of 101 in a House of 555.] but the Government will have a very\r\nlarge majority. They tell me Dizzy is negotiating another little purchase\r\nof Seleucia and Scanderoon. Jerusalem is in the next lot.\r\n\r\nI gave the 'Secret du Roi' to an Irishman to review, and the wretch has\r\ndisappointed me. I am afraid it is now too late, or I would do it myself.\r\n[Footnote: It was reviewed in the April number (1879), but neither by\r\nReeve nor the Irishman.] Read M. de Lomenie's book, 'Les Mirabeau'--a very\r\namiable family.\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, January 4th_, 1879.--This Christmas has been marked beyond\r\nall others by the most tragical events. To me, Mrs. Grote and Lord\r\nTweeddale are deplorable losses, and I could add a catalogue of names of\r\nless note, besides those of public interest. What irony to call it the\r\nseason of mirth and gaiety!\r\n\r\nMrs. Grote has very kindly left Hayward l,000£. I am glad of it, for it\r\nwill make him more comfortable, and, I hope, less cross.\r\n\r\nThe Journal then has:--\r\n\r\n_January 7th_.--Dined at Sir P. Shelley's; Spedding, Browning.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_January 18th_.--I fully intended to come to see you to-day, and to bring\r\nyou the MS. volumes of C. C. G.; but I am very lame with rheumatism in my\r\nknee, and the weather is so infernal that I cannot use the carriage, and I\r\nam afraid to make the expedition in a cab. I must therefore defer my call\r\ntill I can move better. On such a day as this one can only burrow like the\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nI think the Cenci article in the new 'Ed. Rev.' will interest you.\r\n\r\n_January 22nd_.--I send you Vols. III. and IV. of the mystic record. Pray\r\nkeep it locked up.\r\n\r\nIn the 'True Tale of the Cenci,' by T. Adolphus Trollope, there was much\r\nthat Mr. Cheney dissented from, and he wrote a long letter on the subject,\r\nwhich Reeve in due course forwarded to Trollope. This led to a reply, with\r\nwhich, as far as Reeve's correspondence shows, the discussion dropped. If\r\nit was continued further, it was without Reeve's assistance.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_January 23rd_.--I saw Lady Shelley to-day, and, as I told her you could\r\nnot call on her, she very obligingly said she would be happy to call on\r\nyou and bring you the enlarged photograph of the poet to look at. These\r\nphotographs are done on porcelain. There are only three copies of them,\r\nwhich Lady S. has got. The negative is destroyed. ... She says the drawing\r\nis the image of Shelley's sister, Helen Shelley.\r\n\r\n_January 31st_.--Many thanks for your prompt return of the volumes. I am\r\nglad they have amused you, and you can give evidence that they are not very\r\nwicked. I am afraid I cannot supply any more until I have been down to\r\nFoxholes, as I find I have locked up part of the MS. there; and I must now\r\nhave the whole of it bound.\r\n\r\n_February 3rd_.--I send you Trelawny's book on Shelley, and I also enclose\r\nan interesting letter from Mr. Trollope in answer to your remarks on the\r\nCenci article. You will see he has taken pains with the subject. I did\r\nnot mention your name to him in connexion with the remarks, but only with\r\nreference to the Philobiblon notes. He therefore does not know that you are\r\nas well acquainted with the Italians as he is.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Dempster_\r\n\r\n_C. O., February 26th_.--I hope this will not arrive too late to\r\ncongratulate you on having achieved in health and good spirits\r\nthree-quarters of the road to our centenary. Unluckily, the last quarter is\r\nthe most difficult. But _sursum corda_! When I look back and about me, I\r\nam astonished to have got so far. The great pleasure of advancing years\r\nis retrospection. One sees such groups and groups of pleasant people. The\r\nprospective eyes of youth see nothing so real or charming. I fancy I am\r\nsitting with you on a flowery bank of heather in the Highlands, about\r\nAugust 15th, talking of these things. There are a dozen brace of dead\r\ngrouse in the bag. Donald is at the well. Don't remind me that it is\r\nFebruary, 1 in London, the wind in the northeast.\r\n\r\nHere the Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_February 27th_.--My sister-in-law, Helen Blackett, died at Matfen.\r\n\r\n_March 4th_.--Charles Newton and Sir J. Hooker elected by The Club.\r\n\r\n_April 28th_.--I was named Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries for\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Kimberley_\r\n\r\n_35 Lowndes Square, May 3rd_.--There is a savage article in the 'Quarterly'\r\n(by Froude, I believe), many of the statements in which arise from mere\r\nignorance. Whatever chance of success Carnarvon's scheme of confederation\r\nhad--it was in any case small--was destroyed by Froude's blundering, which\r\nwas caused mainly by his knowing nothing whatever about the political\r\nhistory and literature of the colony. But, for all that, his article is\r\nworthy of attention. Like you, I am very apprehensive about the Zulu war;\r\nbut this is too long a story for a short note. I should very much like to\r\ntalk the matter over with you.\r\n\r\nThe Journal again:--\r\n\r\n_May 15th_.--Presided at Antiquaries as V.-P.\r\n\r\n_June 11th_.--Great party at Count Münster's for the golden wedding of\r\nEmperor Wilhelm.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_Audley Square, July 1st_.--I have an impression of Shelley's portrait,\r\nwhich Colnaghi has just engraved. Sir Percy wishes it not to be re-copied,\r\nand he entertains no doubt of its authenticity. He says it is extremely\r\nlike a maiden aunt of his--the only survivor of the past generation of the\r\nShelleys. I beg your acceptance of an impression.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_July 1st_.--I am uncommonly obliged to you for the exquisite engraving of\r\nthe drawing of Shelley. I shall cherish it alike in memory of him, and of a\r\nbetter man--yourself, and for the strange legend about it.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear that ------ has taken offence at the mention of her\r\nfather in the 'Greville Memoirs.' I was wholly unconscious of the offence,\r\nand indeed had forgotten that he was mentioned in them at all.... I should\r\nlike, with great simplicity, to say to these eminent persons that I value\r\nthe honour of being the Editor of Charles Greville's Journals infinitely\r\nmore than any distinction that Queens or Duchesses could bestow on me. But\r\nI esteem the talents and good qualities of ------ and certainly I never\r\ndreamed she was offended.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_July 5th_.--Lady Waldegrave died. The news came while we were attending\r\nLord Lawrence's funeral in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--To Foxholes. _August 16th_.--Visit to Weymouth; 18th, drove to\r\nAbbotsbury.\r\n\r\n_August 30th_.--Tom Longman died at Farnborough--seventy-five.\r\n\r\n_September 3rd_.--His funeral.\r\n\r\n_5th_.--To St. Malo with Christine and Hopie; 6th, to Dinard and on to\r\nDinan; 8th, to Guingamp; 9th, to Lannion, seeing Chateau de Tonguebec on\r\nthe way; 10th, to Louannec--fine rocky coast; 11th, Morlaix--drove to\r\nSt. Pol de Léon; 12th, Brest, but it rained; 13th, to Auray; 14th,\r\nexpedition to Carnac; 15th, expedition to Locmaria-quer; 16th, Auray to St.\r\nMalo; 18th, home again--a pleasant tour.\r\n\r\n_24th_.--To Stratton, to see Lord Northbrook about article on Affghan War.\r\nRead him the article.\r\n\r\n_October 21st_.--Lord Northbrook at Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_30th_.--Left Foxholes. Visit to Pember's [at Lymington], Beaulieu Abbey.\r\nTo town on November 1st.\r\n\r\nFrequent mention has been made of M. de Circourt's letters, the writing of\r\nwhich occupied a great part of his time. In a short memoir, or, rather, an\r\nappreciation, which Reeve contributed to the 'Edinburgh Review' of October\r\n1881, he wrote: 'It was his pleasure and his desire to live and die\r\ncomparatively unknown. With an insatiable curiosity and love of knowledge,\r\nwith an extraordinary facility in mastering languages, and a universal\r\nlove of literature; with a memory so precise and so inexhaustible that it\r\nretained without effort all he had acquired, he found in the mere exercise\r\nof these singular gifts a sufficient employment for a long and not inactive\r\nlife.... He possessed and enjoyed the friendship of an extraordinary number\r\nof men of the highest distinction, not only in France, but in all lands.\r\nThe correspondence he carried on with his friends in Germany, Italy,\r\nEngland, Switzerland, America, and Russia was inconceivably voluminous. To\r\neach of them he wrote in their own respective language, equally vehement\r\nand profuse in every tongue.'\r\n\r\nThe bulk of his letters to Reeve alone is truly formidable. But these, and\r\npresumably most others, were to a very great extent political or literary\r\npamphlets, which, though not given to the press, were--there can be little\r\ndoubt--intended to be circulated among a select public such as he delighted\r\nin addressing. Two of the latest of these, written very shortly before his\r\ndeath, are here given:--\r\n\r\n_From M. de Circourt_\r\n\r\nLa Celle, October 27th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I don't know whether the article 'Germany since the\r\nPeace of Frankfort' has done in Great Britain so much noise as the\r\n'Affghanistan,' which has been, over here, an event in the literary-politic\r\nworld. But the first one is quite equal to the second, and gives career to\r\nendless (alas! useless, too!) reflections. It is a sombre picture, quite in\r\nthe style of Rembrandt, with a _chiaroscuro_ much akin to darkness. It can\r\nbe objected that the lights are sacrificed to the shades. But, excepting\r\nthe strong constitution of the Imperial army, and the perfection to which,\r\naccording to competent judges, the preparations for an offensive and\r\ndefensive war have been pushed, I cannot see anything, in the condition of\r\nfinances, industry, husbandry, and, above all, public morals, which is not\r\nthreatening, if not absolutely disheartening. No traveller comes back from\r\nGermany without a tale of woe. _Savior armis Luxuria incubuit, victamque\r\nulciscitur Galliam_. And while the rancour and the thirst for vengeance are\r\nstill, in France, what they were in 1871, the whole of power, riches,\r\nand fashion in Germany crowding to Paris, give it a sort of transient\r\npopularity, and suffers itself to be led by what is among us most\r\nfrivolous, most immoral, and even less French, in the old and legitimate\r\nsense of that word. It is very curious to observe how the strangers flock\r\nto Paris in order to enjoy the spectacle of themselves, reckoning the\r\nFrench for nothing save the ministers of their pleasures, _et improbi turba\r\nimpia vici_. If, in the midst of these brilliant saturnalia, the _pares_\r\nwere to rise, and another Commune spring from the kennel to the day, how\r\nmany of the lords of the Philistines would be buried under the ruins of the\r\ntemple of Dagon? But to revert to Germany, or, rather, to her ruler.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck, I apprehend, has lived too long. He begins to feel the\r\nfickleness of fortune. He has never had any friends; he begins to be\r\nburdensome to his associates. I don't know whether he could have managed a\r\nParliament elected after the actual method on the Continent; I am certain\r\nthat he did not, and never was able to, uphold a consistent and honourable\r\nsystem whatever. He is no financier, no economist; and as he does always\r\nact upon the interests of the present hour, without regard to past\r\nengagements, he can have with him but those who superstitiously deem him\r\na prophet, or those who choose to _servir à tout prix_. He is rude,\r\nsuspicious, and vindictive. The only great minister with whom he can be\r\ncompared, Richelieu, was at least frank and open towards friend and foe.\r\nBismarck has never negotiated with any man, nor charged any man with an\r\nimportant measure, without becoming their ruin, or changed them into\r\nimplacable enemies--Savigny, Usedom, Arnim, Gortschakoff. The good genius\r\nof his country has protected Moltke against his insidious praises and\r\nbitter censures. It is easy to prove that, during the late war, all the\r\ngood advice given to the King came from Moltke; all hurried, or lame, or\r\nimprovident, or perfidiously cruel measures came from the Chancellor. Why\r\ndid he leave half of the forts round Paris in the power, not of our\r\narmy, but of the armed rabble, to which he left the possession of 1,500\r\nfield-pieces and 300,000 guns, while he disarmed the regulars to the last\r\nman? To his calculations we owe the Commune; posterity will hold him\r\nresponsible for that incalculable calamity, which it was at every hour in\r\nhis power to avert, or to crush instantly. Presently his tenure of office\r\nis very precarious. The Emperor is eighty-two, and has never liked\r\nBismarck; he has given recently some signs that he feels galled by the\r\nchain. The Crown Prince may make use of him, and sacrify his personal\r\nfeelings to the advantage not to upset suddenly the system of government;\r\nbut, under Friedrich Wilhelm V., it is more than probable that Bismarck\r\nshall have to choose between retire or obey. Even in the present\r\noccurrence, considering that France is wholly taken up with her internal\r\ndissensions, which are not likely to become soon better, and that Russia\r\nhas need of time for recruiting her exhausted resources, it was certainly\r\nnot sound policy to blow the trumpet of a coalition which was, presently,\r\ndreamed of by nobody, and shall, in the future, result from the necessity\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nThe article upon the Code of Criminal Law is an excellent treatise of\r\n_Criminalison_; we, too, want a _refonte_ of our criminal law. What is\r\ncalled civilisation has gorged our society with an infinity of malpractices\r\nunknown to our ruder but better fathers; and we suffer from the bane of\r\nmodern civilisation, that idiot charity towards the refuse of mankind,\r\ncoupled to a perfect indifference for the honest people they assail or\r\nbring to ruin. To that endemic disease of the mind no penal statute can\r\nafford a remedy. MacMahon was as weak as a school-girl on such occasions;\r\nGrévy is scarce better; at least he does not call weakness Christian\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n'The Impressions of Theophrastus Such' are little intelligible to me,\r\nmerely because I have read so few books of the authoress. Doudan [Footnote:\r\nXimenes Doudan (1800-72) was in early life a tutor in the family of the\r\nDue de Broglie, and remained attached to him. His critical judgement and\r\nsparkling conversation made him a special feature of the Duchess's _salon_.\r\nHe was well known in literary society, and was compared by Reeve (_Ed.\r\nRev._, July 1878) with John Allen of Holland House. Like Allen, his\r\nreputation was based almost entirely on his conversation and encyclopaedic\r\nknowledge. After his death, his few essays and numerous letters were\r\ncollected and edited by the Comte d'Haussonville, under the title of\r\n_Mélanges et Lettres_(4 tomn. 8vo. 1876).] wrote that he could never be\r\nquite unhappy while he had _des romans anglais à lire_; I confess that,\r\nwhen they are not first-rate, they seem to me to belong rather to the\r\ndepartment of industry than to that of literature. The article upon the\r\ncivil engineers of Britain is an admirable compilation of much that's\r\nuseful to know and easy to understand; the magnificence of the _tableau_\r\nstrikes the fancy and weighs upon the mind. But, after all, is humanity\r\nbecome grander, or better, or happier by so many performances of the\r\ninquisitive and constructive genius? _That's the question_. With trembling\r\nhope I'll answer Yes! Life is less dark, a little longer, and better\r\nprovided against the material plagues of nature: but farther?\r\n\r\nI am pent up with a severe cold, and losing the last day of a capricious\r\nautumn. Mme. d'Affry has promised me a visit.\r\n\r\nWhat of the parliamentary strife between Disraeli and his rivals? At least,\r\nit is _Diomedes cum Glauco_, statesman pitched against statesman. But in\r\nour camp: _non melius compositus cum Bitho Bacchius_. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA. C.\r\n\r\nThe letter that follows is endorsed by Reeve 'M. de Circourt's last letter\r\nto me. He was struck with apoplexy on the 15th, and died on the 17th of\r\nNovember. The last token of fifty years' friendship':--\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Circourt_\r\n\r\nLa Celle, November 12th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 6th. I am still an\r\ninvalid, _conjuguant_ in all its tenses the verb _grippe_, with its\r\nnear relation bronchitis. However, I am recovering by-and-by, and the\r\nweather--not fine, still very mild--helps me towards recovering my liberty\r\nof locomotion. I am the more sorry for my _réclusion_ that I had begun some\r\nplantations in my garden. Fancy what it is to plant trees by half-dozens\r\nand to buy land by wheelbarrows!\r\n\r\nWe are in a state of partial fermentation and general disgust. The\r\nPresident _videt meliora probatque, deteriora sequitur_; he is absolutely\r\nsunken in the opinions, but tolerated, because he lets every party at\r\nfreedom to plot and to hope. Waddington does not fare better, but Jules\r\nSimon has presently no chance of replacing him. The sympathy which Ferry\r\nhas proclaimed for the Reformed Church [Footnote: See _Times_, November\r\n8th.]--very natural in itself--may be mischievous for them; our nation has\r\nnever any sympathy for minorities. The leaders of the Clerical party have\r\nlowered their teaching and their practices to the level of the most obtuse\r\nintellects and the most childish enthusiasms; they make conquests by\r\nmyriads; and as, in our present state of society, numbers are accounted for\r\neverything, the Government and ruling party have already encountered, and\r\nshall encounter more and more, a formidable opposition, which, if it\r\ndoes not drag the country into civil war, cannot fail to accelerate and\r\nprecipitate the fate of the Republican Government. As the Duc d'Aumale\r\nseems resolved never to put himself forward, the conjectures hover between\r\nGalliffet [Footnote: General de Galliffet was more especially known for the\r\nstern justice he had meted out to the Communards of 1871.] and several\r\nothers, all men of action, although none of them has the prestige which\r\nmade, in 1799, the task of Bonaparte so wonderfully easy. The 'Great\r\nUnknown' will be revealed to us by some sudden stroke; our people is\r\nperfectly disposed to acknowledge a master, and prays only that 'nous ayons\r\nun bon tyran,' since we must have one.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield's speech [Footnote: At the Mansion House on the 10th. See\r\n_Times_, November 11th.] shall not put an end to the embarrassments of\r\nour Exchange, shaken to its foundations by the curiously tragical episode\r\n[Footnote: 'Gigantic swindle' would more correctly designate it. See\r\n_Times_, November 7th. Philippart, having made away with some 100,000,000\r\nfrancs, had judiciously vanished.] of Philippart. _Imperium et Libertas_,\r\ni.e. 'Domination abroad and Freedom at home,' is a proud legacy of 'the\r\nmost high and palmy days of Rome'; but it will be difficult to force the\r\nsubmission to that maxim upon all the powers of the world. If the Turks had\r\nstudied the history of classical times, they would believe that the days of\r\n_Civis Romanus sum_ and the _Reges clientes Populi Romani_ are come again\r\nfor the East; and what immense space does this name design, since the\r\nexclusive and dominating influence claimed by the Premier begins at the\r\nAdriatic and ends--nowhere; for the whole of Affghanistan being brought\r\nunder British control, and Turkish Asia on the other side being claimed as\r\na protected and indirectly governed country, it will become necessary\r\nthat the intermediate region, Persia, be assimilated to the rest of the\r\ndependencies of an Empire which, at the farthest end, shall soon be\r\ncontiguous to China.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Russian people is very different. The stern decrees of\r\nProvidence have made of it the antagonist and hereditary foe of the Asiatic\r\nbarbarics, which it has faced under the walls of Kief and Moscow, and\r\npressed, by dint of repeated battles and immense sacrifices, to the foot\r\nof the Himalaya range and the course of the Upper Oxus. Sooner or later, a\r\ntremendous shock must happen between the two gigantic Empires which meet\r\nupon that debateable ground. I hope I may never witness it; but I do\r\nregret much the disparition of the ample neutral ground, which till lately\r\nstretched from the Indus to the Yaxartes....\r\n\r\nMany wishes for your health and occupations.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. CIRCOURT.\r\n\r\nThe Journal gives the chronicle of the last weeks of the year:--\r\n\r\n_November 22nd_.--Visit to Chatsworth. Delane died. _23rd_.--Chatsworth.\r\nLong talk with Lord Hartington.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--Delane's funeral at Easthampstead. Went down with Barlow and\r\nStebbing; then across by Woking to Lithe Hill (Haslemere); very cold.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas severe illness came on--gout and violent bleeding of the nose.\r\nI was totally laid up for two months.\r\n\r\nThe year had been a sad one, and had marked its progress by the death of\r\nmany of Reeve's dearest and oldest friends--Lady Blackett (to whom he had\r\nalways been tenderly attached), Longman, Circourt, and Delane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nOUTRAGE AND DISLOYALTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very serious illness which ushered in the year 1880, and which confined\r\nReeve to his room till near the end of January, formed a very important era\r\nin his life. Though it passed away, so that, after a fortnight at Brighton,\r\nhe was able, by the middle of February, to attend to his official duties at\r\nthe Council Office, the bad effects remained. He was no longer a young man,\r\nbut he had carried his years well. He had travelled, he had occasionally\r\nshot, and always with a keen sense of enjoyment. Now, the full weight of\r\nhis age told at once. His illness left him ten years older; unable to\r\nundergo the fatigue of field sports, and feeling that of travel sometimes\r\nirksome.\r\n\r\nAnd Foxholes afforded him a tempting excuse. From this time, instead of\r\ngoing for his holiday to Scotland, to France, or to Geneva, it seemed so\r\nmuch easier to go to Foxholes, so much more comfortable to spend it there.\r\nAnd for the next fifteen years a large part of his time was passed at\r\nFoxholes, where, in the most delightful climate known in this country,\r\nsurrounded by beautiful scenery and with a commanding view of the sea,\r\namid the comforts of home and in the company of his books and his chosen\r\nfriends, he could say, from both the material and moral point of view:\r\n\r\n  Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis,\r\n  E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem.\r\n\r\nOf course, his duties at the Council Office required him to be in town\r\nduring the season and while the Court was sitting; and in the April of this\r\nyear he noted a breakfast at Lord Houghton's, to meet Renan, and presiding\r\nas a Vice-President at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries. Otherwise\r\nthe Journal is almost a blank, containing little beyond the dates of going\r\nto Foxholes or returning to town.\r\n\r\nBut though thus in a measure withdrawing from the swirl of society in which\r\nso much of his life had been passed, he in no sense lost touch with the\r\nmovements of the day, and in none of these did he take a more lively\r\ninterest than in those which affected the state of France. And that seemed\r\nparticularly unsettled. No one could attempt a forecast of the future,\r\nthough wild guessing was easy. Nothing was certain; everything was\r\npossible. Hope was guided rather by fancy than by reason, and tinted the\r\nyears to come in brighter colours than--now that those years have passed\r\n--history has warranted. For many years back the French Princes had been\r\nReeve's occasional correspondents, but their letters had seldom had any\r\npolitical significance. At this time they began to have a more serious\r\nimportance; and during the next six years those of the Comte de Paris, more\r\nespecially, are full of deep and pregnant meaning. In England, the topics\r\nof the day were the dissolution in March, Mr. Gladstone's Mid-Lothian\r\ncampaign, which will live in history as an instance of the noxious\r\nadmixture of sentiment and politics, and the overwhelming success of the\r\nLiberal party at the polls, which brought Mr. Gladstone back to office, at\r\nthe head of an absolute majority in the House of Commons of 56. Reeve, of\r\ncourse, followed the progress of the election with anxious eyes. To Mr. T.\r\nNorton Longman he wrote:--\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, April 2nd_.--The Liberal gain on the Elections is far more than\r\nI anticipated, and I begin to hope there may be a decided Liberal majority.\r\nWhat I most deprecate is an even balance of parties. If the Liberals are\r\nstrong, they will be moderate; if weak, they will be violent.\r\n\r\nIt is raining heavily to-day--rather damp for the electors, but a capital\r\nthing for the country and for my shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe further course of the election brought him the following letters from\r\nthe Comte de Paris:--\r\n\r\n_Château d'Eu, le 12 avril_.--Je vous remercie de tout mon coeur des voeux\r\nque vous m'adressez à l'occasion de la naissance de mon fils, et je suis\r\nheureux de pouvoir vous donner les meilleures nouvelles de la mère et de\r\nl'enfant.\r\n\r\nJe suis bien peiné d'apprendre que vous avez été si longtemps souffrant cet\r\nhiver. La rigueur de la saison peut bien en avoir été la cause, et j'espère\r\nque l'été achèvera de vous remettre. Nous serions heureux, la Comtesse de\r\nParis et moi, si durant cet été vous pouviez, avec Madame et Mademoiselle\r\nReeve, renouveler la visite que vous nous avez faite au château d'Eu il y a\r\ntrois ans. Depuis lors la maison a été toujours en deuil; l'événement qui\r\nvient de s'accomplir ici nous permet, j'aime à le croire, une année plus\r\nheureuse.\r\n\r\nThe result of the elections in England has caused great surprise in France.\r\nNothing led us to expect such a complete change in the opinion of the\r\nelectorate. When I saw Mr. Gladstone a few months since, he did not seem at\r\nall confident of his party's speedy return to power. A year or two ago I\r\nshould have greatly regretted the fall of Lord Beaconsfield; but my\r\nopinion is entirely changed since Lord Salisbury's speech in honour of the\r\nAustro-German alliance. Lord Beaconsfield's term of power has had the one\r\ngood result of obliging the Government which succeeds him to pay more and\r\ncloser attention to Continental politics than the English Cabinet did in\r\n1870 and 1871. But for some time back the Russophobia of the Foreign Office\r\nand its agents has been so great that it looked as if England was going to\r\ngive up the idea of preserving the equilibrium of the Continent, and become\r\nthe accomplice or the dupe of those who played on this passion.\r\n\r\n_20 avril_.--Je m'empresse de vous remercier de votre lettre et de vous\r\ndire tout le plaisir que la Comtesse de Paris et moi nous aurons à vous\r\nvoir ici avec Madame et Mademoiselle Reeve. Malheureusement les trois\r\ndernières semaines d'août sont le seul moment où je ne serai pas ici, et si\r\nvous venez un peu plus tôt en France je vous prierais de commencer par le\r\nchâteau d'Eu.... I have read the article on M'Clellan by Mr. Curtis, in the\r\nlast number of the 'North American Review.' It did not teach me much, for I\r\nhave often talked it all over with M'Clellan, in his visits to Europe. But\r\nthe article is good, and all the facts alleged are perfectly true. Lincoln\r\nwas very weak in this business, the tool--without knowing it--of Stanton\r\nand Halleck. The author sometimes closes his eyes to M'Clellan's faults,\r\nwhich, though they do not excuse Lincoln, impartiality will not permit us\r\nto ignore. M'Clellan was an excellent organiser and a skilful general, but\r\nhe made blunders; he could not take a decided resolution at the proper\r\ntime, and it is not correct to say that he was considered a faultless\r\ngeneral: he was loved, appreciated, and respected by all, and justly\r\nconsidered as the best chief of the Federal armies, when Grant, Sherman,\r\nand Thomas were as yet little known. Personally, he was, at times, very\r\nindiscreet: he permitted those about him to speak of the President in\r\ninsulting terms, and he wrote the letter quoted by Mr. Curtis. An extremely\r\nsilly thing, for it could not possibly do any good, and it was easy to\r\nsee that his enemies would use it against him. With these exceptions, I\r\nentirely share the views of the author of the article.\r\n\r\nWe await the formation of your new ministry with curiosity. I agree with\r\nyou that it is better that Gladstone should be its recognised head than its\r\nunofficial and irresponsible leader. I hope the experience of 1871, and the\r\nverdict of the electors in 1874, have opened his eyes to the dangers of a\r\n_far niente_ policy, as practised by the Foreign Office during his last\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n_27 avril_.--Je vous remercie infiniment de votre lettre du 21 et je me\r\nréjouis bien de penser que nous aurons probablement votre visite ici au\r\nmois de juillet. Je vous remercie de l'intention que vous m'exprimez\r\nd'arranger vos projets de manière à pouvoir venir en France à cette époque.\r\n\r\nI see Mr. Gladstone has not been afraid of the fatigue you thought would\r\nbe too much for him. I quite understand that after his disaster in 1874 he\r\nshould insist on a material proof of his wondrous political rehabilitation.\r\nBut it seems to me that he ought not to have combined the Exchequer with\r\nthe leadership--unless, indeed, his friends wanted to handicap him by\r\nallowing him to take upon his strong shoulders a burden which is usually\r\ndivided between two ministers. I am not surprised at this change, so\r\ncomplete, so striking to one who thinks of the time when Mr. Gladstone,\r\nalmost disavowed by the party he had so imprudently led to defeat, could\r\nhardly find a constituency to open the doors of the House to him. It is\r\na spectacle presented by all free countries, a salutary warning to the\r\nvictors of the day, and a consolation to the vanquished, to whom hope is\r\nalways left. But what does astound me is that the change should not have\r\nbeen foreseen. It is rather a severe democratic shock to the parliamentary\r\nmachine. Is it the effect of the lowering of the franchise, or of the\r\nsecret ballot? I do not know. But does not the astonishment of the leaders\r\nof the victorious party prove that their followers are escaping from their\r\ncontrol? And if so, where and to whom will they go? However, I am confident\r\nthat the practical spirit which has hitherto inspired all classes of the\r\nEnglish people, as they have been successively called upon to take\r\ntheir part in the government--from the old nobility to the petty\r\nshopkeepers--will not be found wanting in the new electoral body,\r\nconstituted by the last reform.\r\n\r\n_4 juin_.--Si, comme je l'espère bien, vous pouvez réaliser la bonne\r\npromesse que vous m'avez faite de venir ici avec Madame et Mademoiselle\r\nReeve dans la seconde moitié de juillet, je serais heureux de vous voir\r\nfixer votre visite aux environs du 22: en effet, nous attendons ce jour-là\r\nou le suivant quelques personnes qui vous intéresseront certainement et qui\r\nseront charmées de vous rencontrer: le Comte et la Comtesse d'Eu, le Duc et\r\nla Duchesse d'Audiffret-Pasquier, M. et Madame de Rainneville (Rainnevillea\r\nformosa, d'après votre botanique spéciale).\r\n\r\n_19 juillet_.--Je m'empresse de vous remercier de votre lettre, et de vous\r\ndire que je vous enverrai jeudi, à Dieppe, une voiture pour vous chercher à\r\nl'Hôtel de la Plage à deux heures après midi, à moins d'avis contraire.\r\n\r\nToutefois je dois vous prévenir que M. Alexandre Dumas, qui habite près de\r\nDieppe, et auquel j'avais demandé de venir déjeuner ici l'un de ces jours,\r\nen lui laissant le choix du jour, m'annonce qu'il viendra déjeuner au\r\nchâteau le jeudi 22. Le déjeuner est à onze heures et demie. Si vous\r\ndésiriez le rencontrer il faudrait que vous partiez le matin de Dieppe.\r\nDans ce cas, sur un avis de vous, je vous enverrais la voiture à neuf\r\nheures du matin, au lieu de deux heures après midi.\r\n\r\nSo on July 21st, Reeve, with Mrs. Reeve, left London for Dieppe, whence\r\nthey went on to the Château d'Eu. On the 26th they went on, through St.\r\nQuentin, Namur, and Liège, to Aix, where, for the next fortnight, Reeve\r\ndrank waters and took baths. They then returned through Brussels and\r\nLondon, reaching Foxholes on August 14th.\r\n\r\nAnd there they stayed for nearly three months, during which time, beyond\r\nnoting a few visits or visitors, the Journal is a blank. On November 6th\r\nthey returned to London.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_C. O., November 26th_.--I have not for a long time read a book so\r\nfascinating to me as these Reminiscences of Carlyle; for though he calls\r\nthem reminiscences of Irving &c., they are, in fact, essentially an\r\nautobiography. It is impossible to present the details of life with more\r\nattractive clearness and picturesque effect. The most curious thing is\r\nthat the style, instead of being a mass of cloudy affectation, is simple,\r\nflowing, and natural. To me, especially, all this is most captivating. The\r\naccount of Mrs. Montagu, Coleridge, the Bullers, the Stracheys, &c. revives\r\na thousand recollections. It was through the Bullers that we first knew\r\nCarlyle, and I suppose in due time he will relate his intimacy with the\r\nAustins and Sterlings in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIt is right to say that there are many persons still alive who will not be\r\npleased at having their portraits drawn by so strong a hand--Mrs. Procter,\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I think the book is eminently interesting and valuable, and\r\nwill have a very large circulation indeed. It is the sort of book everybody\r\nlikes to read, and in this case it is backed by names of great celebrity. I\r\nwill send the MS. back to you on Monday. What a wonderful thing it is\r\nthat Froude should have had the patience to copy all this out in his own\r\nhandwriting!\r\n\r\nI dined last night with the Chancellor, and found both him and the Home\r\nSecretary deep in 'Endymion.' Everybody abuses it more or less, but\r\neverybody reads it, so the abuse does not go for much. Only Lady Stanley\r\n(the dowager) declares she could not get through the first volume. Such is\r\nthe strength of party feeling.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\nChantilly, 2 décembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je me fais une fête de vous revoir. J'ai vendu\r\nmon hôtel de Paris et n'ai pas encore pu y reconstituer d'établissement.\r\nMais Chantilly [Footnote: During the next few years, before he was again\r\nexiled, the Duc d'Aumale restored Chantilly on a magnificent scale (see\r\n_post_, pp. 319, 320), making it a repository for his splendid collection\r\nof pictures, works of art, and library, which included many precious MSS.\r\nBy a will dated June 3,1884, he bequeathed the whole to the 'Institut de\r\nFrance,' in trust for the nation.] est si près! Dès que vous pourrez,\r\ndonnez-moi votre adresse de Paris, et indiquez-moi quels jours vous serez\r\nlibre, afin que je puisse en choisir un et vous demander de venir à\r\nChantilly. Dites-moi aussi quels jours il vous serait agréable d'avoir ma\r\nloge aux Français.\r\n\r\nJ'espère bien avoir lu 'Endymion' d'ici là. Je vous serre la main.\r\n\r\nH. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nReeve was thus meditating a visit to Paris for Christmas, as soon as the\r\nCourt rose. Its session ended in the death of one of its most esteemed\r\nmembers. Sir James Colvile, formerly Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof Bengal, had a house in Rutland Gate, and a great intimacy had grown up\r\nbetween the two. On Friday, December 3rd, he had dined with the Reeves, 'in\r\nfair health and excellent spirits,' as Mrs. Reeve wrote a few days later.\r\n'He, with Lady Colvile and his brother-in-law, Lord Blachford, sat on for\r\nquite half an hour after the other guests left' On Saturday morning he went\r\ndown to the office with Reeve. On the Monday he was dead. Sir Lawrence\r\nPeel,[Footnote: First cousin of Sir Robert Peel (the statesman), formerly\r\nChief Justice of Calcutta, and since 1856 a member of the Judicial\r\nCommittee. He died in 1884, in his 85th year.] one of his colleagues in the\r\nJudicial Committee, himself now old and feeble, wrote, apparently the same\r\nday:--\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--A blow terrible indeed to all of us, to me most terrible. A\r\nman so close to death as I think myself feels more deeply the awe a sudden\r\ndeath causes. I know not the man to whom a sudden death could come and find\r\nmore well prepared than he was. I thank you for your kind forethought. Say\r\nfor me to his late colleagues that I feel his loss to them and to all of\r\nus irreparable. That he should go first! Oh God, preserve me and bless you\r\nall. Ever yours truly,\r\n\r\nL. PEEL.\r\n\r\nCould you say or write a line in season to Lady Colvile? They say I am\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, December 7th_.--I have been and am horribly upset by the\r\nsudden death of Sir James Colvile, which took place yesterday morning. He\r\nwas really my most intimate friend; for twenty-two years we have worked and\r\nlived together, and to all of us the loss is irreparable,\r\n\r\n_From Sir Lawrence Peel_\r\n\r\n_December 11th_,--One word about your 'resignation.' 'Don't.' The weaker\r\nthe thing is, the more your value will be felt. Sir Montague [Footnote:\r\nSir Montague Smith, one of the paid members of the Judicial Committee. He\r\nresigned the office on December 12th, 1881, and died, in his 82nd year, in\r\n1891.] will go. He has as much as told me so, not very lately. It will be a\r\nnew Court, not the old P. C., nor can it have the character of the House of\r\nLords. It will have its entire way to make, and where is the stuff? It may\r\nin time win approval; but it will be a child at first. Of course if things\r\nare made unpleasant to you, Go; but my impression is the other way.\r\n\r\nI think I do get better, but I am very bad. It [the death of Sir James\r\nColvile] was a terrible shock; and I lie and think, yet cannot throw it\r\noff. To-day is the funeral. Alas! Alas! _Nulli flebilior quam mihi!_\r\nWhen earth covers him, not a better man will be left on its face. _Tibi\r\nconstabat_. Ever the servant of Duty and of his God, and letting no man\r\nnote in him a sign that he thought himself better than the ruck.... God\r\nbless you! Don't resign--wait.\r\n\r\nOn December 15th Reeve went to Paris alone. His Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Opera 'Aïda,' with the Comte de Paris and the Duc d'Aumale.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--To the Français, with the Duc d'Aumale.\r\n\r\n_19th_.--Breakfasted at Chantilly; went all over the Château, rebuilt.\r\n\r\n_24th_.--Dined alone with Lord Lyons.\r\n\r\nBut a few letters written at this time to his wife give the best\r\ndescription of his visit, and call more particular attention to what seems\r\nto have been in great measure the cause of it--the paper to be read before\r\nthe Institute.\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 21st_.--I dined yesterday with Laugel to meet the De\r\nWitts, the young De Barantes and M. de Mérode. The Duc de Broglie came in\r\nthe evening. The eldest son of Cornélis de Witt is about to marry Mlle.\r\nde Labruyère, a considerable heiress, dans l'Agénois. This is a capital\r\nmarriage for the family. To-morrow I am going to a lecture by M. Caro at\r\nthe Sorbonne. On Thursday there is the reception of M. Maxime du Camp (who\r\nwrote about the Commune) by M. Caro at the Académie Française, when I\r\nshall take my seat amongst the Forty Immortals. It will be interesting. On\r\nWednesday 29th I shall probably make an address to the Institute (simple\r\nénoncé de faits) on the State of Landed Property in Ireland--a formidable\r\nundertaking!\r\n\r\nI think now that the Radicals will break up the Government and break their\r\nown necks. I cannot conceive that the English people and Parliament will\r\ncondone such monstrous conduct. I therefore now hope that they will play\r\nout their abominable game. Mr. Plunket's speech is admirable.\r\n\r\n_December 23rd_.--I am just come back from the Institute, where there has\r\nbeen a grand function--the reception of Maxime du Camp by M. Caro on behalf\r\nof the Académie Française. All Paris was mad to go, and I believe they\r\nexpected the Communards would storm the sacred building. I sat aloft among\r\nthe Immortals, with the Duc de Broglie, Haussonville, Lesseps, Vieil\r\nCastel, and next Alexandre Dumas, who was very pleasant. The Duc d'Aumale\r\nwas on the other side.\r\n\r\nYesterday we had a very pleasant dinner at the De Broglies'--Gavard,\r\nLambert de Ste.-Croix and Cornélis de Witt. They shot 1,250 pheasants\r\nat Ferrières [Footnote: It was here that the celebrated meeting between\r\nBismarck and Jules Favre (cf. _ante_, pp. 186-7) took place, on September\r\n19th, 1870.] (Baron Rothschild's) on Sunday. The Comte de Paris brought\r\ndown 300 himself.\r\n\r\nI have written out my speech on Irish Land and read it to Gavard. It will\r\ntake about fifteen or twenty minutes in the delivery. I breakfast tomorrow\r\nmorning with St. Hilaire.\r\n\r\n_December 27th_.--I went to the English Church in the Rue d'Aguesseau on\r\nChristmas Day--full congregation and nice service--but saw nobody I knew.\r\nMme. Faucher's dinner was dull, but Passy and Leroy-Beaulieu were there,\r\nand there was some good music after dinner. I called yesterday on Feuillet\r\nde Conches and Mme. Mohl, each looking a thousand and older than the hills;\r\nand I spent some time in the galleries of the Louvre with my old favourites\r\nin their eternal youth. It is infinitely touching, when so much else is\r\ngone, to look at those pictures which I myself remember for sixty years in\r\nunchanging beauty. I perfectly remember the impression made on me when I\r\nwas seven years old by the picture of the Entry of Henry IV into Paris.\r\n\r\nI have copied out my whole oration to be read on Wednesday, and, in\r\ncopying, enlarged it. It is chiefly taken from the Irish Land Pamphlet.\r\n\r\n_December 30th_.--My discourse at the Institute went off very well. I was\r\ntold by the best French writer, Mignet, that it was well written, and by\r\nthe best French speaker, Jules Simon, that it was well delivered, which is\r\nenough to satisfy a modest man. The MS. will be printed and published in\r\nseveral forms. Léon Say sat by my side. There were about thirty people\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nI went to the Due de Broglie's reception last night. Nothing can exceed the\r\ndulness of French society--ten or twelve men sitting in a circle to discuss\r\nmiserable municipal politics; not another subject, or a book, or an idea\r\nso much as mentioned. I am now going to breakfast with the Duc d'Aumale at\r\nLaugel's.\r\n\r\nGladstone seems to think that everything must go right since he is in\r\npower. It is a case of mental delusion, but I am curious to see how the\r\nHouse of Commons will deal with him.\r\n\r\n_December 31st_.--We had a very pleasant breakfast with the Duc d'Aumale at\r\nLaugel's yesterday. He was most agreeable. He had a narrow escape on Monday\r\nfrom a stag at bay, which pursued him with fury, killed a hound and wounded\r\na horse. He said, 'J'ai fui comme je n'ai jamais fui de ma vie.' The stags\r\nthey hunt are wild red deer. He asked me to go in the evening with him\r\nto the Français to see 'Hernani,' which I did; glad to see the old piece\r\nagain, though I thought it not well acted.\r\n\r\nI am now going to breakfast with St.-Hilaire.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Paris, December 29th_.--I am very anxious to learn what the bulk of the\r\nLiberal party in England now think of the results of a Radical policy in\r\nIreland and elsewhere. Unhappily our friends, the Whigs, are to a certain\r\nextent responsible for having assented to it, though reluctantly; but the\r\nreal author of this Irish policy is Mr. Bright. The consequences of it\r\nappear so disastrous that I cannot conceive it will last. But we are on the\r\neve of stormy times.\r\n\r\nThe Journal continues:--\r\n\r\n1881, _January 2nd_.--Returned to London in 8 1/2 hours.\r\n\r\nThe Club met in January as Parliament was sitting.\r\n\r\n_14th_.--Dinner at home. Prince Lobanow,[Footnote: The Russian Ambassador.]\r\nActon, Burys, C. Villiers, Leckys.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--Small dinner at Lord Derby's.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--Tremendous snow-storm. 21st. Excessive cold.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_Audley Square, January 5th_.--I must apologise for having kept your\r\nprecious manuscript [Footnote: The _Greville Memoirs_, second part], so\r\nlong. The truth is, I left town for a month, and left the volumes carefully\r\nlocked up, and only finished them on my return. I have read them with the\r\ndeepest interest, and am truly obliged to you for having procured me so\r\nmuch amusement. I think these volumes even surpassing the last in interest.\r\n\r\nI see you have marked several passages for omission which I should retain.\r\nI allude particularly to those relating to the French Revolution and the\r\nconduct of the Orleans family. It is impossible that any relation of those\r\nfacts can be made so as to be agreeable to that family; and no omissions\r\ncould be made that would render the narration palatable to them. Besides,\r\nthese are Charles Greville's opinions, and not yours; and you are not\r\nanswerable for them.\r\n\r\nHis remarks on the state of Ireland and the conduct of the Government are\r\ncurious, as being exactly those which people are making at this moment.\r\nGladstone's policy is exactly that of Lord John Russell; but the urgency of\r\naction is now still greater, and the outrages committed still more heinous.\r\nGladstone may apply the words of the poet to himself--'In not forbidding,\r\nyou command the crime.' Also the Duke of Wellington's opinions on army\r\nreform are applicable to the present moment, when such determined attacks\r\nare made upon its efficiency. The Duke said, 'We had a damned good army,\r\nand they are trying to make it a damned bad one.' Our present patriotic\r\nGovernment, he might say, 'are trying to make it a damned deal worse.'\r\n\r\nWhat would be personally offensive to the Queen should be omitted; but as\r\nto his criticisms on public men and their measures, I cannot see why they\r\nshould be suppressed. The daily newspapers all over England are free to\r\nmake what comments they please, and I cannot see that a well-informed\r\nindividual is not entitled to the same privilege.\r\n\r\nHis account of his quarrel with Lord G. Bentinck should in justice to him\r\nbe printed; Lord G. told his own story, and Greville has every right to\r\ngive his version of it. He certainly intended it, for he read me that part\r\nof his journal. The name of the Duchess of ------ should of course be left\r\nin blank, but, with this exception, I think the whole might be printed.\r\nThere is no private scandal, and public men and their friends should not\r\nbe thin-skinned, and must learn to bear adverse criticism. The affectation\r\nof calling Lord Russell 'John' and 'Johnny' is offensive and tiresome;\r\nalso, by omitting persons' titles there is frequently some ambiguity--\r\n'Grey' may mean Sir George or the Earl, and the context does not always\r\nmake his meaning clear.\r\n\r\nI think a few lines of preface from you explaining your motives for leaving\r\nGreville to express his own views and opinions would quite clear you with\r\nall reasonable people.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St. Hilaire_ [Footnote: At this time Ministre des Affaires\r\nEtrangères.]\r\n\r\nParis: January 10.\r\n\r\nCher Monsieur Reeve,--I quite understand that the reticence of the Tories\r\nis very wise. Office is not tempting, and it is prudent to leave it to\r\nthose who actually have it. But the situation is very precarious, as Mr.\r\nGladstone will no doubt soon learn. Meanwhile he has given me powerful\r\nassistance by speaking of arbitration as he has done, supported by the\r\ncomplete and unanimous assent of the English Cabinet. This may very likely\r\ndecide the Greeks and Turks to adopt more sensible notions. But the thing\r\nis giving me a great deal of trouble...\r\n\r\nI hope you may be able to pacify Ireland, but it will be very difficult.\r\nAgainst such atrocious and persistent determination, force is almost as\r\nunavailing as gentleness. If, as we may believe, that is what Cromwell met\r\nwith, we can understand the excesses into which the barbarity of his age\r\nled him; but in two hundred and thirty years we have not gained much. Even\r\nemigration has had no good effect. 'Tis a frightful sore; though during the\r\nlast forty years England has done wonders to cure it.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said on this subject. I see by the newspapers that you have\r\nread before our Academy a most interesting paper on Property in Ireland. If\r\nyou should print it, I hope you will not forget me. Towards the end of this\r\nmonth I will send you one of my latest works--to wit, a Yellow Book on\r\nGreece. It will at least be curious.\r\n\r\nAgréez, cher Monsieur Reeve, tous mes voeux de nouvel an pour vous et pour\r\ntous ceux qui vous sont chers. Bonne santé.\r\n\r\nVotre bien dévoué,\r\n\r\nB. ST. HILAIRE.\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 11th_.--I am greatly obliged for the account of your\r\ninterview with Musurus Pasha. If the key to this business is in our views\r\non the Conference of Berlin, the house is open, and we have nothing to do\r\nbut enter. I have written with my own hand three long despatches, showing\r\nby a reference to Vattel that the Conference was nothing more than the\r\nmediation promised by the XXIVth article of the Treaty of Berlin.\r\nThese despatches I have communicated in the first place to Athens and\r\nConstantinople, and afterwards to all the foreign ambassadors here, as well\r\nas to Essad Pasha and to Braïlas Arméni.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing certain, it is that the Conference of Berlin neither\r\ndid nor could do anything but mediate; it merely gave advice; it did not\r\ndeliver judgement to be enforced. I am doing what I can to convince the\r\nGreeks of this all-important fact, but hitherto without much success. I\r\nhave even gone farther, and have pointed out to them in these despatches\r\nthe limits within which arbitration will probably have to confine itself.\r\nAs I am only one out of six, I can do no more, and even this was perhaps\r\ntoo much. The Porte and Greece cannot help knowing all this. The public\r\nalso will know it by the end of the present month, when I shall publish the\r\ndespatches in the yellow book which I am preparing, and which I will send\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nThe state of Ireland appears to us here to be truly dreadful. We do not see\r\nhow such crimes can be tolerated.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_January 13th_.--I see no reason why this sequel [of the 'Greville\r\nMemoirs'] should not be published whenever it is convenient, but of this\r\nyou only can be judge. There is very little private scandal, and that\r\nlittle should of course be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe Queen should always be spared; but as to Lord J. Russell and Lord\r\nPalmerston, they are public men, and their public conduct requires no\r\nreserve in the discussion of it;--the Queen herself, in her own Journals,\r\nspeaks of them and of Gladstone in terms that prove how little reserve she\r\nthought necessary. It is amazing to me that a man who lived so much in the\r\nworld [as Greville], and who had great curiosity and a taste for gossip,\r\nshould so carefully have avoided all scandal.\r\n\r\nThe criticism that was sometimes made on the former volumes reminds me\r\nrather of the note on the quiz on Crabbe in the 'Rejected Addresses':--'The\r\nauthor is well aware how ill it becomes his clerical profession to give any\r\npain, however slight, to any individual, however foolish or wicked.' Pain\r\nmust be given, and offence will be taken; but you will do what is right and\r\nmust be indifferent. I think these last volumes even more amusing than the\r\nfirst, and the discussions about Ireland are of peculiar interest at this\r\nmoment--I am very glad that these precious volumes are again in your hands.\r\nI felt quite uneasy whilst they were in mine.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChateau d'Eu, le 2 février.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Nous ne pouvions douter, ma femme et moi, de la\r\npart que vous et Madame Reeve prendriez au malheur si cruel et si inattendu\r\nqui vient de nous frapper. Vous aviez vu ici le bel enfant que Dieu\r\nnous avait envoyé il y a dix mois [Footnote: _Ante, p. 275_] et dont la\r\nnaissance nous avait causé une si grande joie. Il était si fort et si bien\r\nportant que jusqu'à la veille de sa mort nous n'avions pas eu un instant\r\nd'inquiétude. Vous comprenez done bien notre douleur. Je ne doute pas que\r\nMademoiselle votre fille ne s'y associe, car nous connaissons et nous\r\napprécions les sentiments dont vous nous avez donné, tons les trois, tant\r\nde preuves.\r\n\r\nMa femme, qui depuis dix ans a perdu trois soeurs, deux frères, et deux\r\nfils, est, comme vous le pensez, bien accablée; mais les enfants qui lui\r\nrestent l'obligeront heureusement à reprendre à la vie. Ne voulant plus\r\naprès notre malheur laisser derrière elle notre dernière fille, la petite\r\nIsabelle, et ne pouvant l'emmener en Espagne dans cette rude saison, elle a\r\nremis ce voyage à l'automne prochain, et s'est décidée à ne pas quitter le\r\nchâteau d'Eu, où l'hiver a été rude. Mais si nous avons eu le froid et la\r\nneige, l'Andalousie n'a pas été épargnée par la tempête, et les inondations\r\ny sont terribles.\r\n\r\nJe termine en vous priant de croire aux sentiments bien sincères de\r\nVotre affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding autumn the state of Ireland had been exceptionally\r\nbad. There were many who believed that the attempt was being made, by a\r\ncold-blooded calculation, to work on the sentimental instincts of Mr.\r\nGladstone's character. The verb 'to boycott' had been introduced into the\r\nEnglish language; murders and agrarian outrages had been frequent; but\r\nwitnesses and juries were so terrorised, that prosecution was found to be\r\ndifficult and conviction impossible. In charging the grand jury at Galway\r\non December 10th, the judge had commented on the fact that, out of\r\n698 criminal offences committed in Connaught during the four months,\r\nthirty-nine only were for trial, no sufficient evidence as to the other\r\n659 being obtainable. On November 2nd, fourteen members of the Land\r\nLeague--including five members of Parliament--were arrested and committed\r\nfor trial on the charge of inciting to crime. The facts were matter of\r\npublic notoriety, but the jury refused to convict, and the prisoners were\r\ndischarged. The Government was compelled to act; and on January 24th Mr.\r\nForster moved for leave to bring in a bill for the better protection of\r\nperson and property in Ireland. After an unprecedented obstruction on the\r\npart of the Irish members, and after a continuous sitting of forty-one\r\nhours, the Speaker summarily closed the debate, and the bill, commonly\r\nknown as the Coercion Bill, passed the first reading on February 2nd. On\r\nthe 3rd, twenty-seven of the Irish members were suspended; and the bill,\r\nhaving passed through the succeeding stages, finally became law on March\r\n2nd.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 6th_.--I am happy in your approval, and permit me to add\r\nthat I am proud of it. I know the value and sincerity of your judgements.\r\nYou have a long experience of politics, and every reason not to be deceived\r\neven by the most obscure complications. There was certainly an intrigue on\r\nfoot against the Cabinet, but I believe a stop has been put to it for some\r\ntime to come, and we shall now probably have all the trouble of the general\r\nelection, which will be very advantageous for the republic; but, from\r\na personal point of view, I am anything but charmed with the prospect,\r\nfinding myself chained up for several months. Nothing could be more\r\nvexatious, though I put as good a face on it as I can.\r\n\r\nWe do not understand here how a political assembly can endure what your\r\nParliament has put up with. Thanks to Mr. Gladstone, the Speaker is now\r\narmed with sufficient power, and I take for granted he will know how to\r\nuse it. But Ireland, terrible Ireland, is always there. If an insurrection\r\nbreak out, it will be necessary to have recourse to repressive measures,\r\nmore or less similar to those of Cromwell. I do not believe that there\r\nwould be many in Europe to blame you. How can you do otherwise? Of their\r\nown free will, the Irish sink to the level of brute beasts, which are to be\r\ntamed only by force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next letter, and many others following it, from M. Barthélemy\r\nSt.-Hilaire, refer to the action of France in regard to Tunis, as to which\r\nthere was a strong feeling in England both then and since. France, it may\r\nbe admitted, had grievances; whether she would have taken the steps she did\r\nfor their settlement if the English Government had been stronger in its\r\nforeign policy may very well be doubted.\r\n\r\nFor many years, almost since the first establishment of the French in\r\nAlgeria, there had been differences between France and Tunis, over which\r\nthe French pretended a protectorate which neither Tunis nor Constantinople\r\nwould allow. There had been also many commercial difficulties--some\r\nhonest, some dishonest; but what led to the acute stage which these\r\ndifficulties and differences assumed in 1881 was the purchase, in 1880, by\r\nthe Société Marseillaise, for 100,000 £, of a large tract of land known as\r\nthe Enfida--subject, it had been stipulated, 'to the provisions of the\r\nlocal law.' But the purchase was no sooner publicly declared than its\r\nlegality was disputed; a Maltese--therefore an English subject--named\r\nLevy claiming that by the local law he had a right of pre-emption and was\r\nprepared to buy. This right the French Government denied, and alleged that\r\nthe intending purchasers were really Italians--private or official--Levy\r\nbeing only a man of straw put forward to strengthen their case by the\r\nEnglish name. Lord Granville, the then Foreign Secretary, instructed the\r\nEnglish Consul at Tunis that it was an affair of Tunis law, and that he was\r\nnot to interfere beyond seeing that the English subject got what the law\r\nentitled him to. The French Government, however--of which M. St.-Hilaire\r\nwas the exponent--refused to be bound by Tunis law, and on May 1st landed\r\n10,000 soldiers, and took military possession of Tunis, disclaiming all\r\nidea of being at war with Tunis, but being obliged--they said--to defend\r\nand maintain their just rights. They were neither going to annex Tunis nor\r\nto rebuild Carthage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 25th_.--I should be quite as deeply vexed as you if any\r\ncoolness should arise between England and France. I am doing everything in\r\nmy power to maintain and even strengthen the good relations. I am happy to\r\nsay we have a better understanding than ever in Egypt; but at Tunis matters\r\nare not so favourable, and I fear that the English Cabinet has been too\r\nhasty in taking under its protection a person who is but little deserving\r\nof it. I hope to show this very plainly. The Marseilles Company which we\r\ndefend is quite _en règle_, in every respect, and what M. Levy is aiming at\r\nagainst it is simply a forcible spoliation by means of an intrigue hatched\r\nby the principal members of the Tunis Government, [Footnote: It is quite\r\npossible that this was true, but it was merely an assertion based on the\r\none-sided declaration of the Marseilles Company and its agents.] with the\r\nprime minister at their head. And whatever difference of opinion there may\r\nbe, Lord Granville, of his own accord, said to M. Challemel-Lacour that in\r\nthis there was no cause of quarrel between the two countries. That is my\r\nopinion also, and I hope to bring the English Cabinet to it; but it is not\r\nfor us to sacrifice the Marseilles Company, by subjecting it to tribunals\r\nwhose hostile decision is known beforehand. The whole trouble has been\r\ncaused by the Italians, who have started and are prosecuting this intrigue,\r\nat the very moment in which they are asking us for a loan of six hundred\r\nand fifty millions.\r\n\r\nThe speech of M. Gambetta was eloquent, and above all dramatic, but not\r\nconvincing; and it is really very difficult to believe that he knew nothing\r\nof the Thomassin mission till after it had failed. I have no knowledge of\r\nwhat passed between M. de Freycinet and M. Gambetta; but it is certain that\r\nfor the last five months Gambetta has made no attempt to control me and my\r\npolicy. He affects to show his sympathy and approval whenever he meets me,\r\nand notably so last Monday. At the same time, his newspapers attack me in\r\nevery way they can, whilst he, verbally, disavows them, as he did for M.\r\nProust and M. Reinach. This double game does not tell in Gambetta's favour;\r\nhe has lost much during the last two months, and if the _scrutin de liste_\r\nis not passed, his influence will be greatly diminished. In short, he is\r\nplaying a very equivocal part, which is injurious both to himself and to\r\nthis republic. What saves him are attacks of the kind which M. de Broglie\r\nineffectually made yesterday in the Senate....\r\n\r\nOf current and social events the Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_March 5th._--Visit to Battle Abbey. Duke and Duchess of Somerset there.\r\nEd. Stanhope, Arthur Balfour, H. Brougham, Lord Strathnairn.\r\n\r\n_11th._--Dinner at home for General Roberts: but he had been ordered off to\r\nthe Transvaal.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Emperor of Russia (Alexander II.) murdered.\r\n\r\n_16th._--Tennyson gave an evening party in Eaton Square.\r\n\r\n_April 7th._--To Foxholes. Cold: gouty. Lady Colvile came.\r\n\r\n_20th._--My cousin, John Taylor, died.\r\n\r\n_26th._--Lord Beaconsfield's funeral.\r\n\r\nOf this last, he received the following account from Mr. T. Norton\r\nLongman:--\r\n\r\n_April 28th._--The sad ceremony I had the honour of attending the day\r\nbefore yesterday will for ever live in the memory of all who were present.\r\nNothing could have been more simple in its character, nothing more striking\r\nin its solemnity, and nothing more in strict accordance with his wishes.\r\nI may well say I shall not forget so great an occasion, not only from the\r\nfact that the ceremony was the burial of a great man, but from the very\r\nselect band of followers I had the privilege of joining. There were only\r\n120 invitations sent out, and all these were not made use of. I travelled\r\ndown in a saloon carriage with Drs. Quain, Bruce, Lord Lytton, Lord\r\nAlington, Count Münster, with all of whom I had very pleasant conversation.\r\nSir William Harcourt, Lord Rosebery, the Danish Minister, and another\r\nambassador were also in the carriage; so I had plenty of good company.\r\nI had a little conversation with poor Lord Rowton, and thanked him for\r\nthinking of me. 'Not at all,' he said; 'I am quite sure it would be _his_\r\nwish that you should be here to-day.' This was, to say the least of it,\r\ngratifying. The persons who appeared to be most touched were poor Bruce and\r\nLord Henry Lennox. On our return to the Manor about fifty of us went into\r\nthe drawing-room to hear the will read, and a very interesting document it\r\nproved to be. It is perfectly clear Lord Beaconsfield contemplated a great\r\ndeal of publication. After the reading was finished and those present had\r\nmostly left the room, I waited behind a little for the three Princes to\r\nmove first; and, much to my surprise, the Duke of Connaught turned round\r\nand shook me by the hand. This little incident makes it all a peculiarly\r\ninteresting and eventful day. We all returned to town together (I mean the\r\nPrinces and the guests); and I think I may safely say that a train never\r\narrived at Paddington Station with a more distinguished company on board.\r\n\r\nAs I walked up from the church I could not help thinking that the last\r\ntime I walked up that hill I had poor Lord B. on my arm. The demand for\r\n'Endymion' is very great, and in fact the demand for all his novels is\r\ngreater than we can meet. We are printing night and day to try and keep the\r\ntrade supplied.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, 27 avril_. Il y a bien des jours que je voulais vous écrire, et ce\r\nlong silence me faisait craindre que vous ne fussiez malade, comme vous\r\nl'étiez en effet; mais je me disais aussi que les vacances de Pâques vous\r\nameneraient sans doute à Paris. J'espère que le printemps vous guérira\r\ncomplètement de cet accès; et que vous serez délivré de ce mal si\r\ndouloureux, dès que la chaleur nous sera revenue. Ici, nous avons un temps\r\ndes plus maussades.\r\n\r\nI have done everything in my power to keep clear of this Tunis business;\r\nbut the Khroumirs' affair has filled the cup to overflowing, and we are\r\nobliged to resort to force. I shall finish the business off as quickly as\r\nI can, and as we have no idea of annexation, all that we want is a treaty\r\nwith the Bey, giving a lasting guarantee for the security of our frontier\r\nand our interests. I believe that even in Italy people are beginning to\r\nunderstand or to admit the necessity which is pressing on us; but they will\r\nowe us a grudge, and later on will resent it, if they can. For the present,\r\nthe loan of six hundred and fifty millions paralyses their wrath. We are\r\nno more going to refound Carthage than Italy is going to re-establish the\r\nRoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe death of Lord Beaconsfield is a great blow for England. I have noticed,\r\nnot without some surprise, that I am of the same age as he was.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that Lord Dufferin is quite of your opinion about\r\nRussia, and thinks that the most truly sick man is not at Constantinople.\r\nHe may be right. Meanwhile the Conference will fail. I happen to know that\r\nthree of us will refuse--England, Italy, and France. Austria would like to\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nPeople are speaking no more of the _scrutin de liste_ than if the question\r\ndid not exist. It was in fact altogether artificial; but the talk will\r\nbegin again with the meeting of the Chamber. The _scrutin d'arrondissement_\r\nappears to gain ground. Its success is much to be desired; for if it is\r\nrejected, we shall pretty quickly find ourselves in a critical position.\r\n\r\n_May 16th_.--Your letter is gloomy indeed, and should your forebodings be\r\nrealised you may be sure that I should be as grieved as yourself. All my\r\nlife, and now as much as ever, I have looked upon the alliance of France\r\nand England as infinitely desirable for both; and if I were so unfortunate\r\nas to cause a breach between the two countries, it would be very much\r\nagainst my will, and without my knowledge. Tunis cannot be a source of\r\ndiscord between us, and I hope that public opinion, over-excited at\r\npresent, will return to a more calm and just appreciation of the case. We\r\nhave declared to Europe that we wish for no annexations or conquests, and\r\nwill attempt none; we have quite enough with the two million five hundred\r\nthousand Mussulmans in Algeria; it would be madness to add fifteen or\r\nsixteen hundred thousand more to them, and a hundred and fifty leagues\r\nto our frontier. For Algeria thus extended we should require an army of\r\n100,000 men, who would be much missed in case of any complication in\r\nEurope. All that we want in Tunis is a power which will not be hostile to\r\nus, and continually threaten our African possessions. We shall only occupy\r\nBiserta and the other places as long as appears necessary; but we will not\r\nmake a port of it; for that, as Sir Charles Dilke has said, would involve a\r\ncost of some 200 millions. I have just sent Lord Lyons a despatch upon that\r\nspecial subject, which will appear in the next Blue Book.\r\n\r\nTunis will never belong to France; she does not want it; but should it\r\nbelong to Italy, who already owns Sicily, the passage to Malta might be\r\nmade difficult. I know that England has not much to fear from Italy; but\r\ncircumstances may change; and the gratitude she shows towards us now proves\r\nhow much she will have for other benefactors. I cannot understand how my\r\ndespatch of May 9th can have been interpreted as the announcement of our\r\ntaking possession. In form and intention it was quite the contrary. Our\r\nactions will show that we only speak the truth. Neither can I admit that\r\neven the conquest of Tunis can ever equal in importance the taking of\r\nConstantinople by the Russians, which in my eyes will be the greatest event\r\nof modern times, as the taking of it by the Turks in 1453 was an important\r\nevent in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nAs to the Treaty of Commerce, I am doing all in my power to facilitate\r\nthe negotiations. I suppose that public opinion in England is at present\r\nprincipally occupied with this; and that, if it is satisfactorily arranged,\r\nTunis will very soon be forgotten. A thousand more interests are engaged\r\nin the agreement on a specific tariff than could ever be involved in this\r\nunfortunate Regency.\r\n\r\nBut I content myself with saying with the poet--_Di avertant omen_; and I\r\ndesire that England may be as well disposed towards us as we are towards\r\nher.\r\n\r\n_May 23rd_.--I knew of the correspondence between Lord Salisbury and Mr.\r\nWaddington long ago. I should never have thought myself authorised to\r\npublish it; but I will take it from the Blue Book and publish it in the\r\nYellow Book. It is quite allowable.\r\n\r\nMy declarations of our intentions in Tunis are the exact truth. Annexation\r\nwould be an act of folly. We have quite enough with three million\r\nMussulmans in Algeria without adding another two million in Tunis, and\r\nanother hundred and fifty leagues to the length of our frontier, which\r\nalready reaches from Nemours to La Calle. In doing good to the Regency we\r\nare serving ourselves, and we only ask one thing in return--that it should\r\nbe as well disposed to us as we are towards it. But it is not easy to\r\nestablish the good terms which would be so profitable to all. England ought\r\nto be very well pleased that both sides of the passage to Malta are not in\r\nthe hands of the same Power, which would be the case if Italy, who already\r\npossesses Sicily, had possession of Tunis on the other side. Geography\r\ndemonstrates the fact. As to us, we wish to do nothing at Biserta. Our port\r\nis necessarily at Algiers in the centre of our possessions.\r\n\r\nLike you, I deplore the _scrutin de liste_. It will give rise to formidable\r\ndifficulties in the near future. I am an optimist by nature, but that\r\nfuture seems to me very dark. I do all I can to prevent it by foretelling\r\nit to everyone; but I only play the part of Cassandra. In the Council,\r\nM. Ferry and myself were the only ones who supported the _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_.\r\n\r\n_July 9th_.--I did not think that the Tunis affair was concluded by the\r\ntreaty of May 12th; that is the first stage if you like; but it was rather\r\ndifficult. The difficulties which arise are very simple consequences; we\r\nwill put down rebellion, but this will not incite us to conquest, which\r\nwe do not want. The interests of the English, and those of other nations,\r\nwould not suffer by our preponderance; and unless all the advantages of\r\ncivilisation are ignored, it is certainly better to treat with the French\r\nthan with the Moors. Europe will soon see [Footnote: Europe has seen;\r\nthough not quite in the sense that St.-Hilaire wished to convey.] that our\r\npromises are not vain, and that we have only good intentions towards Tunis.\r\nWe wish for nothing but the security of our great African colony.\r\n\r\nThe commercial negotiations have been transferred to Paris, at the request\r\nof the English Cabinet, which had at first expressed a wish that they\r\nshould take place in London. This seems to me to imply the very opposite of\r\na rupture, which, for our part, I can answer for it, we ardently desire\r\nto avoid. We only wish for an equitable treaty, and this I hope we shall\r\nmanage....\r\n\r\nEst-ce qu'on ne vous verra pas durant les vacances? Mistress Ross est\r\npassée par Paris il y a huit ou dix jours; elle est venue me voir un\r\ninstant; elle m'a paru très bien portante. Bonne santé et bien des amitiés.\r\n\r\n_July 22nd_.--I assure you that should any rupture take place between\r\nEngland and France, it will be very much in spite of all my efforts to\r\npreserve harmony between two great nations. The English alliance is, in my\r\nopinion, the right one for France; for many reasons, with which you are\r\nas familiar as myself, it is the one which should take precedence of all\r\nothers. I do not by any means disdain other alliances, but the English is\r\nthe first, the most important, and, I may add, the most natural. It was\r\nsincerely desired under Louis Philippe, in spite of a few passing clouds.\r\nUnder Napoleon III. they were, in reality, strongly inclined to break it,\r\nnotwithstanding the Crimean war. To-day we are anxious for an agreement\r\nwith England, if both sides will consent to reciprocal concessions.\r\n\r\nI am deeply grieved--surprised too--at the death of Dean Stanley. Sixty-two\r\nis too early to die, and nothing seemed to foretell his premature end. He\r\npassed through Paris, scarcely two months ago, and came to see me at the\r\nMinistère.\r\n\r\nLike yourself, I should be happy to escape, but my chain is too short; and\r\nwhilst I am minister I shall not go the length of a day's journey away. We\r\nmust be at the command of circumstances, since they are not at ours, and\r\nthe shortest absence is enough to spoil many things. But I shall be happy\r\non the day when I can break my bonds, and return to philosophy.\r\n\r\n_July 27th_.--I hope that my answer to the Duc de Broglie the day\r\nbefore yesterday will convince England of the value I set upon our good\r\nintelligence, and of the open honesty of French policy. I hope, too, that\r\nmy declarations may appease Italy and Turkey. I have done my best, and if I\r\ndo not succeed it will not be my fault.\r\n\r\nOur treaty of commerce is my chief source of anxiety, and for my part I\r\nam trying to avoid a rupture. But there are the resolutions of the two\r\nChambers which cripple the negotiators and above all our minister of\r\ncommerce. These are impassable limits to the best will. The negotiations\r\nwill doubtless begin again in Paris, in about a fortnight, but it is not\r\nyet certain. The incident you point out is very curious, and England\r\nbecoming Protectionist, and England becoming Protectionist again under Mr.\r\nGladstone, would be an astonishing spectacle....\r\n\r\nJe ne savais pas que l'île de Man fût 'le royaume des chats sans queue.'\r\n\r\nThe Journal meantime notes:--\r\n\r\n_June 3rd_.--To Foxholes: beautiful weather; 13th, back to town.

My\r\nfriend Mr. Benham lately gave a lecture at Birmingham on the literature of\r\nthis or a kindred style, written for boys--'Police News' and the like. We\r\ndo little for the people if we only educate them to read and rejoice in\r\nthis trash. Ever yours,\r\n\r\nA. C. CANTUAR.\r\n\r\nThe hint was not lost on Reeve, but it did not bear fruit till nearly six\r\nyears later. In January 1887 the 'Edinburgh Review' contained a strong\r\narticle on 'The Literature of the Streets,' in which the proposal was\r\ndefinitely made for the issue of wholesome fiction and good works of good\r\nwriters, sensational and otherwise, in penny booklets. Eight or nine years\r\nlater the idea was taken up by at least two publishers; such penny books\r\nare now issued by thousands, and, together with the countless number\r\nof halfpenny and penny periodicals, do something to mitigate the evil\r\ncomplained of by the Archbishop. The Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_September 9th_.--Picnic in New Forest with the Lochs and Clerkes. 30th,\r\nsteamed round the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 6th_.--I must express to you the very great pleasure\r\nwith which I have read your article [Footnote: 'Ireland and the Land Act,'\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_ for October. It does not attempt to argue the\r\nquestion of Home Rule, but concludes with the pregnant words: 'My present\r\nobject will be sufficiently accomplished if I have indicated some of\r\nthe difficulties which lie before us, and explained why--at least in my\r\nbelief--it is premature to say, \"Now we have settled our Irish troubles and\r\nmay deal in peace with questions that concern England.\"'] on the Irish Land\r\nAct. It states in the most terse and telling language precisely the views\r\nI have entertained for the last two years; and the conclusions it suggests\r\nare even more striking than those it expresses. The ministers of England,\r\nbe they who they may, have a difficult task before them. The odd thing is\r\nthat our present ministers seem totally unconscious of the difficulty and\r\nthe dangers. I am told that they view the state of Ireland with great\r\ncomplacency. It is astonishing how office blinds people's eyes.\r\n\r\nWe have lost two members of The Club--Lord Hatherley and alas!

I do believe it comes near to an accurate statement of the facts\r\nof the case--no one can hope for more than approximate accuracy in such\r\nmatters--and on that account I expected it to be equally disagreeable to\r\nboth sides. Its reception has been better than seemed probable. Gladstone\r\nhas spoken out his mind about Parnell, and quite right too; but I wish he\r\nhad not accused the unlucky loyalists in Ireland of being slack in their\r\nown defence. He does not know, evidently, how much they are overmatched...\r\n\r\nAs to The Club. Two names have occurred to me--one, Browning the poet,\r\nwho is an excellent talker (I have heard him), and as unlike his books as\r\npossible; the other, Sir John Lubbock. What do you say?\r\n\r\nThe opening sentence of the next letter, from Lord Derby, appears to refer\r\nto an after-dinner speech made by Mr. Gladstone at Leeds, on the 7th, when\r\nhe had alternately complimented Mr. Dillon and denounced Mr. Parnell. The\r\nlatter part, the denunciation of Mr. Parnell and his faction, is unusually\r\nstraightforward, and might profitably be studied in connection with some of\r\nMr. Gladstone's later speeches.\r\n\r\n_October 11th_.--I don't understand Gladstone's phrase any better than\r\nyou. Probably the explanation of it is that in Ireland it will be read as\r\nmeaning fresh concession, in England as meaning coercion. For anybody who\r\nhad leisure and disposition to take it up, I think a very interesting and\r\nuseful article for the 'Edinburgh Review' might be made out of the present\r\nstate of Irish literature and journalism. I do not believe the Irish lower\r\nand middle classes ever read an English book or newspaper, and their native\r\nliterature is saturated throughout with the bitterest hatred to England and\r\nall that belongs to our side the water. We do not in the least know here\r\nthe kind of mental food which is supplied to the amiable Celt. A good\r\nanalysis of it would throw more light on the very old subject of why they\r\nhate us so.\r\n\r\nReeve adopted the suggestion, and the subject was discussed in an article\r\non 'Irish Discontent' in the next number of the 'Review.' Lord Derby goes\r\non:--\r\n\r\n_October 15th_.--Since you wrote the Government has screwed up its courage\r\nto act. I never knew any proceedings so universally approved as the arrest\r\nof Parnell. [Footnote: Mr. Parnell, Mr. Dillon, Mr. Sexton, and the chief\r\nofficials of the League were arrested in Dublin on the 13th and lodged in\r\nKilmainham.] But we have not seen the end yet.\r\n\r\n_October 21st_.--Many thanks for your letter, which is returned. I do\r\nbelieve that it would be of use, as making intelligible the present state\r\nof Irish feeling, to show to the English public (which is absolutely\r\nignorant on the subject) what the kind of instruction is that the Irish\r\npeasant and farmer receives.\r\n\r\nAnother matter. What do you think of Matthew Arnold as a possible member\r\nof The Club? He is a good fellow and his literary reputation is very\r\nconsiderable. I think we could do with him if he would attend.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_November 22nd_.--You know how little value I set on my office; I only\r\naccepted it from a sense of duty, and quit it to-day, not only without\r\nregret but with great pleasure. I am glad to receive your congratulations\r\nbecause you correctly estimate the person to whom they are addressed.\r\n\r\nLike yourself, I am not without anxiety for the future. In placing matters\r\nin the hands of M. Gambetta, I said all I possibly could on the affairs\r\nof Europe and our relations with Germany; but I will not swear that more\r\nattention will be paid to my advice than to that of many others.\r\n\r\nThe Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_December 10th_.--To Timsbury; 13th to Foxholes. The Mintos were living at\r\nBournemouth. Lunched with them on the 31st.\r\n\r\n1882, _January 1st_.--At Foxholes. Sir A. Lyall came.\r\n\r\n_9th_.--Returned to London. A few dinners.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_Badger Hall, January 19th_.--I have been reading the political articles in\r\nthe last number of the 'Edinburgh' with great interest and pleasure. The\r\none on 'The Bonapartes,' though not strictly political, amused me much,\r\nas at one time of my life I knew Hortense and Louis Bonaparte intimately.\r\nHortense was an agreeable woman, very French, but lively and full of\r\nanecdote. She had been and was _très galante_, but with decency. When I\r\nknew her at Rome she was near fifty, and though not handsome, had still the\r\nappearance of once having been a desirable woman.... Her son was then with\r\nher--a youth of my own age, with whom I was intimate without liking him. He\r\nwas cold, disagreeable, and full of pretension, silent and reserved in his\r\nown family, and anxious for distinction, which no one seemed willing to\r\naccord him. I believe--contrary to the usual opinion--that he was the\r\nson of Louis Bonaparte; he was like him. He was short, not ill-made, but\r\nungraceful; his face was plain, his skin bad, complexion muddy; small pig's\r\neyes, a coarse nose and mouth, lank hair, with little expression, and what\r\nhe had far from good. Neither I, nor any that then knew him, thought him\r\nat all clever. I remember he got into a ludicrous scrape by intruding,\r\nin female attire, into the apartments of the mistress of the Spanish\r\nambassador, from whence he was kicked out with every circumstance of\r\nignominy.\r\n\r\nWhen the disturbances broke out in the Papal States, he took a part in them\r\nwhich was eminently unfitting, as he and his mother had found hospitality\r\nin the States of the Church which they were refused in every other country.\r\nI saw Hortense at night, just before her hurried departure from Rome, when\r\nthe news of her son's participation in the revolt at Ancona became public.\r\nI had always been well treated by her, and had tasted her hospitality both\r\nat Rome and at Arenenberg, and wished to show her sympathy and interest,\r\nthough I had nothing else in my power.... She received a passport from\r\nSir Hamilton Seymour and travelled through France. In Paris she had an\r\ninterview with Louis Philippe, who was kind to her. In the days of her\r\nprosperity she had had an opportunity of showing kindness to the King's\r\nmother. She showed me a letter from that princess, in which there were very\r\nardent expressions of gratitude for the service rendered to her. This she\r\ntold me she intended to show to L. Philippe as the certificate for her\r\nclaims on his protection. I saw her in London several times during her\r\nstay; she returned to Switzerland, and I never saw her again.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte I only spoke to once afterwards. I happened to be at Cork\r\nwhen he landed there from America. I was at the same inn, and I understood\r\nhe was in great distress for money. I asked to see him, and we met. I asked\r\nhim if he required any trifling service that I could render him, thinking\r\na five-pound note might take him to London. He thanked me, but said he was\r\nsupplied for the moment. He lived with the D'Orsay and Blessington set,\r\nwhich I did not frequent. I did not call on him, and in Paris I never\r\nafterwards made the slightest effort to renew my former acquaintance with\r\nhim....\r\n\r\nI had intended saying something about the two other articles that relate\r\nto home politics, but I have been already too prolix. I must tell you,\r\nhowever, how much I like them. Whigs as well as Tories will soon cease to\r\nbe separate; the struggle will soon be between those who have _culottes_\r\nand those who have not. We have got already to the Girondist ministry--a\r\nparty I hate particularly, in spite of their pretensions to virtue and\r\nphilosophy, or perhaps in consequence of it. There are some men of\r\nbirth and distinction who belong to the party; but the Levesons and the\r\nCavendishes may soon find themselves stranded like the Narbonnes and\r\nMontmorencies amongst the Rolands and the Condorcets....\r\n\r\nWhen are your new volumes to make their appearance? I long to have them as\r\nthough I had not already read them.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, January 20th_.--I am uncommonly glad to hear from you again,\r\nand I have to thank you for a most interesting and amusing letter. My\r\nacquaintance with Louis Napoleon began when yours left off, and I saw a\r\ngood deal of him in 1838 and 1839. He wanted me to translate his 'Idées\r\nNapoléoniennes.' But when he became a great man I dropped his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nI am glad you like my tirade. I suspect my Whig friends do not; for the\r\nmore one asserts Whig principles, the bitterer is the reflection on those\r\nwho desert and betray them. I do not believe that the majority of the\r\ncountry or of the Liberal Party is Radical; but the danger is that a\r\nviolent minority always overpowers an inert majority. I care nothing at all\r\nfor any political persons, and but little for parties. It seems to me that\r\nthe right and the wrong of government lies in the principles that regulate\r\nit, some of which are as certain as the truths of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe 'Greville Memoirs' have rather slumbered of late, but I am gradually\r\nscrewing up my courage to begin printing, slowly.\r\n\r\nWe are very well, and spent our Christmas pleasantly in Hampshire, the\r\nweather being delightful. London is dark and _un_delightful.\r\n\r\nThen the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_February 24th_.--Visit to the Markbys at Oxford. Vespers at New College.\r\nDined at All Souls.\r\n\r\n_28th_.--The Club. I was in the Chair. Mr. Gladstone attended; Lord Derby,\r\nMaine, Hewett, Tyndall, Coleridge. Matthew Arnold elected.\r\n\r\n_March 23rd_.--Electrical Exhibition at Crystal Palace, with Dr. Mann.\r\n\r\n_April 1st_.--To Foxholes. Very fine weather. No rain for three months.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, April 4th_.--I like the concluding pages by Froude in the\r\nCarlyle book, but I am disappointed in Mrs. Carlyle's letters. They are\r\npleasant and cheery, but there are thousands of women who write as well.\r\nAs for Carlyle himself, he is _odious_--arrogance, vanity, self-conceit,\r\ningratitude to old friends--I never thought I should dislike him so much.\r\nHe seems to have looked at everything the wrong side outwards.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_April 11th_.--Lunched with the Mintos. They drove me to Christchurch. Lady\r\nMinto died on the 21st.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--A great salt hurricane that singed the trees all over the country,\r\nand also in France.\r\n\r\n_May 5th_.--Saw Lord Frederick Cavendish before he started for Dublin. On\r\nthe 6th he was murdered.\r\n\r\n_From the Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\n_May 8th_.--You ask a difficult question about politics. On the one hand, I\r\nsee no possibility of a Conservative Government being formed just now,\r\nnor do I believe that a Liberal Government could be formed on purely Whig\r\nlines. On the other hand, I have the deepest conviction of the mischievous\r\ntendencies of Gladstone's leadership, and of the utter instability he is\r\nimparting to all the fundamental principles of government as hitherto\r\nunderstood in all civilised countries. I can only advise that the truth\r\nin this matter should be spoken freely, in the hope that when Gladstone\r\ndisappears from the stage, there may be some return to sounder principles\r\nof legislation. I do not wish to see a change of Government just now. The\r\nTories could not govern Ireland in its present condition; at least it would\r\nbe a dangerous experiment. Half the Liberal party, which now supports\r\ncoercion when it is forced on Gladstone, would undoubtedly oppose every\r\npossible form of it if proposed by Tories. The deplorable disaster made\r\nknown to-day will have its effect. I hope it will force the Government\r\nto give form and substance to an amended Coercion Act--strengthening the\r\nordinary law and widely extending the sphere of summary jurisdiction. If\r\nthis be done well and sufficiently, it will be better than the power\r\nof arbitrary arrest. But before this event, I really feared that die\r\nGovernment might do nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe Journal mentions:--\r\n\r\n_May 20th_.--At Foxholes, till June 13th. Bought rowing boat.\r\n\r\n_June 20th_.--Great dinner at The Club to the Duc d'Aumale. Nineteen\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--Great dinner at Archbishop Tait's at Lambeth. Forty-three people.\r\nEvening service in Lambeth Chapel.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Wagner's 'Meistersinger' at Drury Lane.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Henry Taylor_ [Footnote: A very old friend of Reeve's. See\r\n_ante_, vol. i. p. 91.]\r\n\r\nBournemouth, June 22nd.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--Thanks for telling me what splendours I missed at The Club\r\ndinner. You ask what Dr. Johnson would have said if he had stepped in. As\r\nit was his own Club, he would have been gracious; but it was not every\r\ndinner that could please him. Do you remember his remark as he went\r\naway with Boswell from a dinner at one of the colleges at Oxford? 'This\r\nmerriment amongst parsons is mighty offensive.'\r\n\r\nI always remember the singularly representative character of the only\r\ndinner I have had an opportunity of attending since I was elected.\r\nLiterature and Learning represented by yourself, Dr. Dictionary Smith,\r\nLecky and Lord Acton; the Church by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Dean\r\nStanley; political life by Lord Derby and Spencer Walpole; the Law by Lord\r\nRomilly, and the Dukes by the Duke of Cleveland--and there was no one else.\r\nIt was very pleasant, and there were not too many for conversation in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nI always feel that, as I have not been in London for more than a day since\r\nthat dinner, and am not likely to be there again, it is hardly right to\r\noccupy a place which might afford so much pleasure to some one else; but I\r\nhave said this before, and your answer was that no one ever retired from\r\nThe Club. As I am in my eighty-second year, I suppose it will not be long\r\n[Footnote: He lived four years longer, dying in 1886.] before Providence\r\nwill place my seat at the disposal of some one who will turn it to more\r\naccount. Believe me, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nHenry Taylor.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, 22 juin.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--J'apprends par M. Gavard que vous avez\r\nl'intention de venir en France vers le 20 juillet. Je m'empresse de vous\r\ndire tout le plaisir que vous nous ferez, à la comtesse de Paris et à\r\nmoi, en commençant ce voyage par un séjour au Château d'Eu. Je regrette\r\nseulement que vous ayez l'intention de l'entreprendre seul. J'ai fait ici,\r\nil y a trois semaines, de fort belles pêches à la truite, qui m'ont fait\r\nregretter que Mademoiselle Reeve ne fût pas ici. Vous trouverez chez nous\r\nle Duc d'Audiffret Pasquier, que vous avez déjà vu ici, je crois, il y a\r\ndeux ans; et un général américain, qui a servi avec moi sous M'Clellan, M.\r\nde Trobriand.\r\n\r\nJe ne vous parle pas de la situation de nos deux pays en Orient: elle est\r\npénible, et il me semble que le dernier numéro du _Punch_ l'exprime avec\r\nune vérité parfaite.\r\n\r\nVeuillez offrir mes hommages à Madame Reeve et me croire votre affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_July_.--The Egyptian Expedition was now resolved on. [Alexandria was\r\nbombarded on the 11th: the Army Reserves were called out on the 25th.] Lord\r\nGranville thought it would be finished before the end of August.\r\n\r\n_16th_.--Crossed to Boulogne. Thence by Abbeville to Château d'Eu. Duc\r\nd'Audiffret, St. Marc Girardin, Duchesse de Montpensier. 21st, drive in the\r\nGreat Park. Tréport. 24th, returned to London. 28th, to Foxholes: quiet\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. E. Cheney_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 20th_.--I am glad the article on Shelley [Footnote:\r\n'Shelley and Mary,' _Edinburgh Review_, October 1882.] has interested you.\r\nThe perusal of these private letters and correspondence has considerably\r\naltered and raised my estimate of Shelley as a man. As to his poetry, it\r\nproduces on me exactly the effect of delicious music, which enchants the\r\near even when you can't understand it. But these papers, which Lady Shelley\r\nhas had printed in order to secure their preservation, are a sealed book. I\r\nbelieve she never can show them again to anyone--at least not at present.\r\nThe copy she lent me has been returned to her and I do not possess it.\r\nNobody else does. It is, therefore, impossible to ask her for a copy. I\r\nundertook to compile an article--as I did for Lady Dorchester, on her\r\nfather--_omissis omittendis_. But that is all. I think the history of\r\nAllegra is in great part new, and one of the difficulties in this matter is\r\nthe connexion existing between these papers and the papers of Lord Byron,\r\nwhich are unpublished.\r\n\r\nAre you going to stay in London? I hope so. I shall return to town on\r\nNovember 6, and should be very glad to find you there.\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal accordingly has:--\r\n\r\n_November 6th_.--Returned to London.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--The troops came back from Egypt.\r\n\r\n_December 3rd_.--Archbishop of Canterbury (Tait) died.\r\n\r\n_4th_.--The Law Courts opened.\r\n\r\n_16th_.--To Foxholes till the end of the year. Gambetta died just as the\r\nyear expired.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, December 23rd_.--The Club has lost one of its most respected\r\nmembers in the Archbishop, and all parties seem now to feel how great\r\nand wise a man he was. Huxley would be rather an odd successor to an\r\narchbishop; but I am inclined to think that he ought to be one of our next\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nI am a very old and fervent supporter of the Anglo-French alliance, but in\r\nthe present state of France I doubt whether anything is to be gained by\r\nmaking sacrifices to her pretensions. In justice to other States, such as\r\nItaly and Austria, I see no reason for conceding to France any exceptional\r\nposition in Egypt, and I think all countries should be treated with equal\r\njustice and liberality. It is probable that a firm though friendly attitude\r\ntowards the French will answer best for them and for us. Their expeditions\r\nto Congo, Tonkin, and Madagascar will do more harm to themselves than to\r\nanyone else; but they prove the weakness of the present French Government.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Knowsley, December 25th_.--I agree in what you say about France, if you\r\nmean that the dual control is dead and cannot be revived; nor ought it, if\r\nit could. Other nations may fairly claim a voice in Egyptian affairs. What\r\nI lay stress upon is that we should make it clear that we are not going to\r\ntake Egypt for ourselves; which nearly all foreigners suppose to be our\r\nintention, and give us credit for disguising it so well.\r\n\r\nIt is odd that the French are doing badly. The country is fairly\r\nprosperous, there is no war of classes, no apparent revolutionary feeling,\r\nyet distrust and doubt as to the future seem universal. It almost looks\r\nas if revolutions had driven the better sort of men out of public life. I\r\ncannot believe that their colonial craze will last long. There is, in all\r\nEurope, no country to which colonies are so entirely useless; for the\r\nFrench never emigrate and seldom even travel; and to send conscripts to\r\ntropical settlements cannot be popular with the peasantry.\r\n\r\nAs to The Club--I am quite in favour of Huxley's admission; but have we\r\nonly one vacancy? Would not any possible opposition to him be disarmed, if\r\nhe were brought in, not singly, but as one of two or three? We must talk\r\nover candidates when we meet.... Poor old Owen cannot, in the course of\r\nnature, last long. [Footnote: He lived, however, for another ten years,\r\ndying at the age of eighty-eight in 1892.] Huxley would be his natural\r\nheir; more than the Archbishop's.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, December 27th_.--To return to what you say of France. Do you not\r\nthink that a democratic republic, in which every citizen is striving to get\r\nall he can for his vote at the expense of the State, necessarily becomes\r\nthe most rapacious and corrupt form of government? It is this which has\r\nraised the budgets of France for 1883 to 122 millions sterling; and if you\r\nadd the communal expense, to 154 millions. It is this which compels them\r\nto persist in a reckless expenditure, and to invent new modes of spending\r\nmoney and creating places by absurd expeditions abroad. The system there,\r\nas you say, drives every man of honour and honesty out of political life,\r\nand substitutes for them adventurers and idiots. The evil will become more\r\nintolerable still, and there will come another revolution, probably\r\nat first violent in form and ultimately put down by force. This is a\r\nmelancholy forecast, but it is that of all the persons in France whose\r\njudgement is of value.\r\n\r\nAs to The Club--we had better not propose Huxley while Owen is amongst us.\r\nBut we have several octogenarians--Overstone, Henry Taylor; and as for the\r\nlower grade of septuagenarians, they are numerous; but I will say nothing\r\nof them, as I shall shortly join that body. Altogether The Club presents\r\na respectable array of years, and tends to longevity. I should like an\r\nengineer, if we could catch an agreeable one. What would you say to Sir\r\nHenry Loch? Few men have seen more of the world--in India, China, the\r\nCrimea, down to the Isle of Man; and I think him vastly agreeable. However,\r\nwe can talk this over when we meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH ROYALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany others besides Lord Derby were at this time speculating on the chances\r\nof one more revolution in France. The state of public opinion seemed to\r\npoint to a coming weariness of the corruption incidental to a republic, and\r\na desire for the restoration of the monarchy. Since the obstinate refusal\r\nof the Comte de Chambord, in 1873, to accept the change from the _drapeau\r\nblanc_ of the Bourbon dynasty to the flaunting _tricolor_ which savoured of\r\ndemocracy, monarchy had seemed impossible. But the Comte de Chambord was\r\nknown to be in feeble health, and he had no children. If he should die, the\r\nfusion of the antagonistic parties was possible, was indeed probable; and\r\nit was generally understood that the Comte de Paris was singularly free\r\nfrom the prejudices which had rendered impossible a restoration in the\r\nperson of his cousin. He was, indeed, not ambitious, and he was wealthy.\r\nThe two ordinary motives of conspirators were wanting; but he loved France\r\nby force of sympathy and education, and he honestly believed that a\r\nrestoration would be the best thing for his country. As a matter of love\r\nand duty he felt bound to work in order to bring about this most desirable\r\nof changes.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChateau d'Eu, le 2 janvier 1883.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je suis bien touché de la bonne pensée que vous\r\navez eue de m'écrire à l'occasion de la nouvelle année. Je vous remercie\r\nde tous vos bons voeux, et je vous prie de recevoir ici l'assurance de\r\nceux que je forme pour vous et pour les vôtres.\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged by your remarks on the future of France. This is\r\nindeed dark; and, as you so well express it, the sterility of democracy and\r\nthe impotence of the institutions based on it are most striking. They are\r\nespecially so here. This dearth, this void, of which you speak increases\r\nfrom day to day. The men of note who were formed under a different rule,\r\nand who came to the front under special circumstances, are dying off and\r\nare not replaced. It is only a few days since one, [Footnote: Gambetta,\r\ndied December 31st, 1882.] the most able we have had since the death of M.\r\nThiers, has been carried off by an obscure--a mysterious--illness. Of those\r\nleft, there is no one who can take his place. In some respects he was a\r\ntruly remarkable man. He, and he alone, was known from one end of France\r\nto the other; he, and none but he, could even for one day have united the\r\nblind and jealous forces of democracy; he alone could give the republicans\r\nthe organisation and appearance of a party, but owing to the violence of\r\nhis temperament he could never have held the reins of government. He would\r\nhave been exceedingly dangerous in the department of foreign affairs, which\r\nwould have been his choice. He would, indeed, have brought to it a most\r\nhonourable sentiment of the dignity of France, but he had neither prudence\r\nnor experience. There were in Europe some who counted on him; others who\r\nfeared him; every one, I think, exaggerated what he would have done or\r\ntried to do.\r\n\r\nI regret extremely the difficulties which are rising between France and\r\nEngland about Egypt, and I confess I do not understand the attitude of our\r\nGovernment. The temper of France towards England resembles that of a man\r\nwho has been offered an equal share in a profitable adventure, who has\r\nrefused to accept the risk, and who is now vexed at the success of his\r\nneighbour. But no Government worthy of the name will allow itself to be\r\ninfluenced by such feelings, or is unable to adapt itself to the changes\r\nwhich circumstances may give rise to. And besides, so little attention is\r\npaid in France to foreign politics that the Government may do whatever it\r\nlikes, provided that does not lead to war--under any form or against any\r\nenemy....\r\n\r\nJ'ai bien regretté de ne pas pouvoir rencontrer Mlle. Reeve à Paris.\r\nVeuillez lui dire que si elle veut prendre quelques truites, elle devrait\r\nvenir ici du 28 ou 29 mai au 5 ou 6 pin. C'est la date exacte de l'éclosion\r\ndu May-fly, et à ce moment-là nous faisons vraiment de très belles pêches.\r\nEn attendant nous partons pour Cannes la semaine prochaine. J'espère\r\ny rencontrer quelques amis d'Angleterre, dont plusieurs sont déjà fort\r\nanciens--comme Lord Cardwell, Sir C. Murray, Lord Clarence Paget, le Duc\r\nd'Argyll, &c.\r\n\r\nVeuillez offrir mes hommages à Madame Reeve, et me croire.\r\n\r\nVotre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILLIPE D'ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Granville_\r\n\r\n_Walmer Castle, January 7th_.--I return you, with many thanks, the Comte de\r\nParis' remarkable letter. If the Duc de Bordeaux would follow the example\r\nwhich has been sadly set by Gambetta and Chanzy, [Footnote: Chanzy had died\r\ntwo days before, January 5th. The Duc de Bordeaux better known at this\r\ntime as the Comte de Chambord, did follow the example a few months later,\r\nAugust 24th.] the prospects at Eu would be good.\r\n\r\nWith you, I do not feel inclined to gush over Gambetta. It is true that\r\nhe was well disposed towards England, but his love would have been of a\r\ntroublesome and exacting character.\r\n\r\nThe Journal has little of interest. It notes the return to London on\r\nJanuary 13th; a journey to York on the 29th, on a visit to the Archbishop\r\n[Thomson], who wrote an article for the 'Review' on the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommission; and, on February 17th, to Battle Abbey. Beyond these trivial\r\nentries, nothing except the mention of several dinner parties--some 'good,'\r\nsome 'dull.' Then, later:--\r\n\r\n_April 16th to May 22nd_.--At Foxholes. Very cold. Snow in May.\r\n\r\n_June 8th_.--Dinner at Lord Carnarvon's. Sir R. and Lady Wallace, Lord\r\nSalisbury, Lady Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--Dinner at Alfred Morrison's, [Footnote: Mr. Morrison, so well\r\nknown to historical students by his splendid collection of MSS., died on\r\nDecember 22nd, 1897.] first time. Splendid house.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--Dinner at home. Duc d'Aumale, Granvilles, Malmesburys,\r\nCarlingford, G. Trevelyans, and others.\r\n\r\n_23rd_.--Philobiblon breakfast at Gibbs's. Duc d'Aumale, Duke of Albany. To\r\nMilitary Tournament with Lady Malmesbury.\r\n\r\n_25th_.--Duke of Cleveland's dinner to Duc d'Aumale. Duke of Grafton, Lady\r\nCork.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, 16 juin.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--J'ai hâte de répondre à votre aimable lettre du\r\n8, et de vous remercier de votre bienveillante appréciation d'un travail\r\nqui prend des proportions vraiment formidables. Je suis en effet en train\r\nd'imprimer le 7me volume, et d'écrire le 8me, qui sera suivi encore de deux\r\nautres, si Dieu me prête vie. Je suis obligé d'entrer dans beaucoup de\r\ndétails pour donner à cette histoire un véritable intérêt aux yeux du\r\npublic américain, qui est celui auquel je m'adresse particuliérement, le\r\nseul qui puisse me fournir beaucoup de lecteurs. La traduction anglaise en\r\nun gros volume a dû paraître ou paraîtra incessamment à Philadelphie.\r\n\r\nVous trouverez le Duc d'Aumale en fort bellé sante et très brillant, malgré\r\ntoutes les préoccupations que nous avons eues, et la blessure très vive\r\nque lui a faite l'odieuse mesure militaire [Footnote: The removal of the\r\nOrleanist princes from the active list of the army in February.] dont il a\r\nété l'objet. Je regrette de ne pouvoir l'accompagner en Angleterre, où\r\nj'ai tant d'amis que je serais heureux de revoir. Mais ne puis-je au moins\r\nespérer que vous nous ferez cette année, avec Madame et Mademoiselle Reeve,\r\nune visite au Château d'Eu? Nous resterons ici tout le mois de Juillet.\r\nJ'ai été assez heureux à la pêche ici dans notre petite rivéire. Pendant\r\nune quinzaine, du 25 mai au 10 juin, j'ai pris à la mouche 82 truites\r\npesant 42 livres.\r\n\r\nThis was the sport to which he had particularly invited Miss Reeve in\r\nJanuary, and which, he goes on to say, has given him the idea of going to\r\nNorway in August. As to this, he begs Reeve to make some inquiries for him,\r\nand concludes--Veuillez me croire votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLEANS.\r\n\r\nAnother chatty letter, four days later, June 20th, has:--\r\n\r\nNous serons charmés de vous voir venir ici vers le 24 juillet avec Madame\r\nReeve, tout en regrettant que Mademoiselle votre fille ne puisse pas vous\r\naccompagner. Nous espérons qu'elle pourra venir ici l'année prochaine en\r\nmai. Mais qui peut faire sous un gouvernement démocratique des projets à si\r\nlongue échéance?\r\n\r\nThe visit was, however, prevented by an event of the most serious political\r\nimportance; an event which during the next three or four years was thought\r\nby many to be likely to change the destinies of France, to affect the\r\nfortunes of Europe. It may be best told in the words of the person most\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, le 18 juillet.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je suis revenu ici il y a deux jours après avoir\r\nfait en Autriche un voyage imprévu dont vous avez connu le motif et le\r\nrésultat. J'ai été reçu par l'auguste malade [Footnote: The Comte de\r\nChambord, known among the Legitimists as Henri V.] avec une affectueuse\r\ncordialité qui m'a profondément touché, et j'ai quitté Vienne en conservant\r\nquelque espoir de le voir sortir de la crise cruelle qu'il vient de\r\ntraverser. Les dernières nouvelles reçues ne démentent pas cet espoir,\r\nquoique son état soit toujours fort grave et plein de périls. Je ne puis\r\nnaturellement faire dans une pareille situation de projets à longue\r\néchéance. Non seulement tout plan de voyage est abandonné pour le moment,\r\nmais je vis au jour le jour, toujours prêt à partir au reçu d'une dépêche\r\nannonçant le dénouement fatal. Aussi ne puis-je dans ce moment insister\r\npour vous engager à faire au Château d'Eu cette visite dont je me\r\npromettais tant de plaisir et d'intérêt, mais qui, dans les circonstances\r\nactuelles, risquerait fort d'être brusquement interrompue. Je le regrette\r\nvivement, et j'espère pouvoir m'en dédommager plus tard.\r\n\r\nEn attendant, j'ai hâte de vous remercier de tout ce que vous me dites sur\r\nma situation actuelle et sur l'intérêt que vous y portez. Je vous remercie\r\négalement de ce que vous avez écrit sur ce sujet à la fin du dernier numéro\r\nde la _Revue d'Edimbourg_. On sent en lisant ce morceau combien celui qui\r\nl'a écrit aime et connaît bien la France. Il a été fort remarqué chez nous.\r\nSi vous me permettez d'ajouter un seul mot qui vous prouvera que je l'ai lu\r\navec attention, je vous signalerai un _lapsus calami_ qui vous a échappé.\r\nLe fondateur de notre branche d'Orléans, fils de Louis XIII, frère de Louis\r\nXIV, s'appelait Philippe et non Gaston. Gaston était le nom du fils de\r\nHenri IV, frère de Louis XIII, le Duc d'Orléans de la Fronde, qui ne laissa\r\nque des filles, entre autres Mlle. de Montpensier.\r\n\r\nLike you, I am uneasy at the existing relations of France and England,\r\nthough I fully believe that the two Governments are respectively animated\r\nby the most conciliatory intentions. In my opinion, the blame rests on\r\nwhat is now called 'the colonial policy,' which consists in scattering our\r\nforces to the four corners of the world, while Continental Europe is armed\r\nto the teeth and does not afford us a single ally. But even this policy\r\nmight be followed without causing any difficulty with England, if there was\r\na readiness to anticipate it by frank explanations. The world is big enough\r\nfor it. Unfortunately, since the Egyptian business--which might easily have\r\nbeen the opportunity for a friendly agreement, but which we have made such\r\na mess of--all these questions are confused and taken amiss....\r\n\r\nJe termine en vous renouvelant encore tous mes remerciments, et en vous\r\npriant de me croire votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nLOUIS-PHILIPPE D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\nThe Journal then has:--\r\n\r\n_July 24th_.--Great dinner at the Granvilles' to receive Waddington\r\n[Footnote: M. Waddington had a career that has perhaps no parallel. The son\r\nof an Englishman settled in France, he was educated at Rugby and at Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge; and was second classic, Chancellor's medallist, and\r\nNo. 6 in the University boat in 1849. Having elected to be a Frenchman, he\r\ntravelled in Asia Minor, and achieved a reputation as an archaeologist and\r\nnumismatist. After the fall of the Empire he entered into public life; was\r\nforeign minister and the representative of France at Berlin in 1878; was\r\nprime minister and the representative of France at the Coronation of the\r\nTsar in 1881, and was French ambassador in London from 1883 to 1893.\r\nHe died in 1894 at the age of 68.] [the new French Ambassador]. I was\r\nintroduced to Count Herbert Bismarck. Sat by Errington. Forty-two people\r\nthere at several tables.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--To Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_September 10th_.--Left Foxholes for Broglie _viâ_ Havre. Slept at Rouen.\r\n11th, Broglie, by rail to Bernay; at Broglie, Vieil Castel, Laugel, Target,\r\nGavard. Old name of Broglie, Chambrey.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--Left Broglie for Val Richer. Drive with De Witt.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Gout coming on in foot. Started for Honfleur and Havre; quite\r\nlame. Spent the day on board the Wolf; met Prothero again. Managed to get\r\nhome on the 18th. Laid up in bed for a week.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Granville_\r\n\r\n_September 29th_.--The Comte de Paris has a difficult game to play; and the\r\nlarge intelligent family, living in great luxury and consideration, is not\r\nthe best machine for carrying hopes more or less forlorn; but I expect it\r\nwould be difficult to find an abler or more judicious pretender. My fear is\r\nthat--as you say--their way to success lies through some disaster. I do\r\nnot feel convinced, if an opportunity or a necessity arose, that men like\r\nWaddington and Ferry would not be among the first to act as civil Moncks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we shall know in a very few days whether the wisest among\r\nthe present ministry will have their way and do the right thing by us in\r\nthe Madagascar matter. It will take a little longer to settle the Chinese\r\ndifficulty. This can only be done by great sacrifices on the part of the\r\nFrench. The Chinese will not hurry themselves, and believe they have the\r\nFrench in their pockets.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, 3 octobre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--J'ai reçu votre lettre du 4 septembre à mon\r\nretour de Frohsdorf, mais j'ai eu tant à faire depuis lors que je n'ai\r\npas, jusqu'à ce jour, trouvé un instant pour vous remercier de la preuve\r\nd'amitié et de sympathie que vous m'avez donnée dans ces circonstances si\r\ngraves pour moi. J'ai eu depuis des nouvelles de votre séjour à Broglie et\r\nau Val Richcr par Messieurs Gavard et de Witt, et j'ai bien regretté que\r\nles convenances du deuil ne m'aient pas permis de vous demander cette année\r\nde venir an Château d'Eu. J'aurais été, en effet, fort heureux de pouvoir\r\ncauser avec vous de toutes les graves questions qui se posent aujourd'hui\r\ndevant nous, tant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur.\r\n\r\nJe serai heureux d'en retrouver l'occasion; car, plus les événements\r\nrendent ma situation grave et difficile, plus ils grandissent ma\r\nresponsabilité, plus naturellement je tiens à recueillir les avis d'un\r\nobservateur éclairé, impartial et bienveillant pour la France. Dans cette\r\nsituation si nouvelle, et, je puis dire, sans précédents, je tiens à\r\nresserrer les liens de mes vieilles amitiés, et je tiens particulièrement\r\nà entretenir mes relations avec la société anglaise, ce grand centre\r\nintellectuel qui recueille et juge les affaires du monde entier....\r\n\r\nJe vous prie d'offrir mes hommages à Madame et à Mademoiselle Reeve et de\r\nme croire Votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE COMTE DE PAEIS.\r\n\r\nAll the Comte de Paris' earlier letters are signed Louis-Philippe\r\nD'Orleans, the capital D' being a noticeable peculiarity. By the death of\r\nthe Comte de Chambord at Frohsdorf on August 24th, the Comte de Paris had\r\nbecome the head of the Bourbons, [Footnote: Always excepting the impossible\r\nDon Carlos.] and linked the Legitimists and Orleanists in the person of one\r\ncapable man. At the same time he changed his signature, as now claiming\r\nthe throne by hereditary right. Among the Orleanists, however, there were\r\nmany--including the Duc d'Aumale--who considered the change ill-judged,\r\nas implying that his grandfather, Louis Philippe, was a usurper--as,\r\nof course, he was, if the will of the people is to count for nothing.\r\n[Footnote: Cf. _Le Duc d'Aumale_, par Ernest Daudet, pp. 334-5.] Among the\r\nLegitimists, on the other hand, there were many who protested that under\r\nno circumstances could they accept one of the line of Philippe Égalité as\r\ntheir lawful sovereign. Still, for the next two or three years, it seemed\r\nnot impossible that the Comte de Paris might be called to the throne by a\r\nconstitutional reaction and a popular vote. He does not seem to have had\r\nany wish to head or stir up a revolution of force and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe Journal records:--\r\n\r\n_October 29th_.--To Oxford. Dined at the Deanery. Jowett, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, Max Müller, Brodrick. 31st, dined at All Souls. Sir William\r\nAnson. November 1st, lunched with Max Müller.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_November 21st_.--I notice that to you, as to me, the situation of France\r\nappears very sad. I conceive that it is a source of alarm to all Europe. We\r\nare falling lower and lower towards the Radicals and the Extreme Left. If\r\nthat party should come into power, it would be a very serious threat to the\r\npeace of the world. From the weakness of our Government, everything is to\r\nbe feared; and as this weakness must become greater, there does not seem\r\nany remedy in the near future. Notwithstanding our wealth, our finances\r\nare in a bad state, and it is on that side that the inevitable storm will\r\nburst. To ward it off an entire change of conduct would be necessary; and\r\nat the present time we have no one strong enough to guide our policy in the\r\nright direction.\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Parker_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, December 18th_.--If anyone is to write Lord Westbury's Life,\r\nyours is the pen to do it. Nobody expects a daughter to be impartial, or\r\nwishes it. I will see what letters I can find, and will write again when I\r\nhave looked over my packets of letters.\r\n\r\nThis promise was afterwards fulfilled. Lord Westbury's letters were sent to\r\nMrs. Parker, and several of them, with some of Reeve's, were incorporated\r\nin the 'Life of Lord Westbury' (2 vols. 8vo. 1888), by Mr. T. A. Nash, whom\r\nMrs. Parker afterwards married.\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1884, Mrs. Reeve went to Paris, on a visit to Lady\r\nMetcalfe--one of Mr. Dempster's nieces. On the 16th Reeve joined her there.\r\nAmong other entries, the Journal notes a breakfast at Chantilly on the\r\n27th--'château finished, galleries splendid'--and on the 30th, dinner at\r\nthe Embassy. They returned to London on the 31st. A few dinners in town are\r\nnoted, and a visit to Covent Garden on March 5th, to see Salvini in 'King\r\nLear.' To Foxholes on April 9th.\r\n\r\nThis meagre chronicle of course gives no idea of Reeve's intellectual\r\nactivity at the time, which was really very great. With his official\r\nduties, the conduct of the 'Review,' an extensive correspondence, and, at\r\nthis time, the preparation of the second part of the 'Greville Memoirs,'\r\nwith dinner parties or receptions three or four times a week, it would seem\r\nas if Reeve's days must have consisted of an abnormal number of hours. And\r\neffectively they did; for, though on pleasure--at proper seasons--Reeve\r\nmight be bent, he had always a frugal mind as to the disposal of time.\r\nMost, if not all, of his correspondence, much even of his more serious\r\nwork, was got through in spare half-hours at the Council Office; and when\r\nat home, in his study in the house in Rutland Gate, it was a standing rule\r\nthat he was not to be disturbed. The study was a cosy room on the ground\r\nfloor, built out at the back, and so removed from all noise of passing to\r\nand fro. It had no outlook to distract the attention, and no man was ever\r\nless addicted to day-dreaming. To work whilst he worked and play whilst he\r\nplayed was the golden rule which enabled Reeve for over fifty years to\r\nget through as much hard work as a successful lawyer, to do as much hard\r\nwriting as a successful novelist, to hunt, shoot, or travel whenever\r\nopportunity offered, and to be one of the best known figures in the world\r\nof London society.\r\n\r\n_From the Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\n_March 8th_.--Many thanks for your letter. I am pleased to know that the\r\nscientists find my science accurate. Writers in the interest of religion\r\nhave generally, of late, been disposed to make as much as possible of the\r\ndistinction between man and nature. The speciality of my book [Footnote:\r\n_The Unity of Nature._ There is an article on it in the April number of the\r\nReview.] is, on the contrary, to maintain the unity, as really essential to\r\nall belief, thus going back to the paths of Butler.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, 15 avril._--Cher Monsieur Reeve,--J'étais bien sûr de vous faire\r\nplaisir en vous envoyant les discours prononcés sur la tombe de M. Mignet.\r\nCelui de M. Martha est le plus remarquable; M. Jules Simon a très bien\r\nparlé aussi; mais on peut trouver cependant que M. Martha l'emporte.\r\n\r\nJe suis très sensible à votre amicale invitation, et je serai heureux de\r\nvisiter cet été votre ermitage de Foxholes. Nos vacances commenceront\r\nprobablement en août, et je réglerai mes mouvements sur les vôtres.\r\n\r\nJe vous remercie de votre bienveillance pour l'Histoire des Animaux; je ne\r\ncrois pas que nulle part le génie d'Aristote se soit montré plus grand,\r\nplus scientifique et, l'on peut ajouter, plus moderne. Entre lui et Linné,\r\nBuffon et Cuvier, il n'y a rien. L'histoire de la science a beaucoup à\r\nprofiter de cet exemple frappant.\r\n\r\nJe suis absolument de votre avis sur le rôle de l'Angleterre en Égypte;\r\nvous n'avez qu'à faire ce que nous avons fait à Tunis, où les choses\r\nmarchent à souhait. C'est l'intérêt de votre grand pays, en même temps que\r\nl'intérêt de la civilisation et de l'humanité. Les affaires égyptiennes ne\r\npeuvent rester dans l'état où elles sont; et il faut les régler au plus\r\nvite, pour l'honneur de tout le monde.\r\n\r\nJe présente mes hommages bien respectueux a Madame Reeve, en attendant le\r\npetit voyage a Foxholes vers l'automne. Votre bien dévoué,\r\n\r\nB. St.-HILAIRE.\r\n\r\nAnd here the Journal notes:--\r\n\r\nApril 16th.--Edward Cheney died, aetat. 82.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Vaughan [Footnote: Then Master of the Temple; he died November 15,\r\n1897, aged 81.]\r\n\r\nThe Deanery, Llandaff: April 19th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I am grateful to you for your kind letter. I will try to\r\nremember to make the reference with which you furnish me when I am again at\r\nthe Athenaeum.\r\n\r\nThe year 1185 is always in my recollection as the date of the consecration\r\nof the Round Church by the Patriarch Heraclius. I am already in\r\ncommunication with Dr. Hopkins about the musical part of its celebration,\r\non or about the day (I think February 10) next year. And there must be a\r\nsermon about it on the nearest Sunday. So you see how exactly your thoughts\r\nand mine agree on the subject.\r\n\r\nEver truly yours,\r\n\r\nC. J. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the church was consecrated on Ascension Day 1240. Who\r\nwill be Master when _that_ seventh centenary comes round?\r\n\r\n_From the Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\nArgyll Lodge, Kensington: April 19th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr. Reeve,[Footnote: Written in pencil.]--I am laid up with a very\r\nsudden and sharp attack of the enemy; but I must write a line from bed to\r\nsay how _more_ than satisfied I am by the article in the Review, which goes\r\nstraight to the main points of my Essay, and which distinguishes exactly\r\nthose which best deserve notice. I am the more grateful as all the others\r\nI have seen--whether laudatory or not--have all been the production of\r\nignorant men who did not see, or of learned men who did not wish to see,\r\nany of the specialties of the book.\r\n\r\nI am better, but unfit for any work.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nARGYLL.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, April 20th_.--Much obliged to you for the Beaconsfield book,\r\n[Footnote: The _Beaconsfield Birthday-Book_.] which is very pretty. I hope\r\nyou will sell as many as there are bunches of primroses in Covent Garden\r\nMarket. The extent of Lord Beaconsfield's popularity is really curious. Yet\r\nthis is the man whom Gladstone hunted to death and called a fiend!!\r\n\r\nAnd the Journal for the summer runs:--\r\n\r\nAt Foxholes all May.\r\n\r\n_June 26th_.--Marriage of Hallam Tennyson and Miss Boyle in Henry VII.'s\r\nChapel.\r\n\r\n_July 12th_.--Dinner at Sir Henry Maine's. The Actons, Lindleys, Evelyn\r\nBarings, Brookfield, Venables--interesting party.\r\n\r\n_16th_.--Duchess of Argyll's garden party.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--The great Canadian case between the Provinces of Ontario and\r\nManitoba was argued for six days before the Judicial Committee.\r\n\r\n_24th_.--To Foxholes. On August 11th we went to Strode, to see Mr. Gollop,\r\naetat. 93. 15th, back to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this time, on behalf of Sir Henry Taylor, Reeve had been conducting a\r\nnegotiation with Longmans for the publication of Taylor's Autobiography,\r\nand an agreement had been come to which was to take effect after Taylor's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Henry Taylor_\r\n\r\nBournemouth, August 26th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--Thanks for your very kind letter. I am so glad you can\r\ntake a favourable view of my autobiography.\r\n\r\nI am rather surprised myself that there is nothing in it of Mrs. Austin\r\nand Lucy. I was intimately acquainted with them, and I may perhaps find\r\nsomething said of them in letters, as I proceed with the task of sorting\r\nmy correspondence. Of Mr. Austin I saw very little. He led such a secluded\r\nlife. But one could not see him at all without knowing something of the\r\nintellect which lay hidden in him for so many years.\r\n\r\nAs to the date of publication, I shall leave the necessary instructions. I\r\nwish the work to be published as soon as possible after my death.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nHENRY TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, 17 septembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Je ne veux pas tarder un instant à vous remercier\r\nde votre lettre du 14, et des félicitations que vous m'adressez à\r\nl'occasion de la naissance de mon fils Ferdinand.... Grâces à Dieu, tout\r\ns'est passé aussi bien que possible et, depuis l'événement, la mère et\r\nl'enfant vont à merveille. Je vous remercie bien cordialement des voeux que\r\nvous formez pour celui-ci. Je connais de longue date les sentiments qui\r\nvous inspirent, et vous savez tout le prix que j'y attache.\r\n\r\nVous avez raison de dire que l'avenir se montre assez sombre pour toutes\r\nles nations de l'Europe. Les opérations de l'Amiral Courbet au Tonkin et\r\nen Chine montrent que notre marine se maintient à la hauteur de sa\r\nvieille réputation; elle le doit aux traditions, à l'esprit de corps, aux\r\nsentiments de respect pour les chefs qui s'est conservé chez elle tandis\r\nqu'il disparaissait ou s'affaiblissait partout ailleurs. Mais cette\r\ndémonstration nous coûte bien cher. La guerre avec la Chine nous alarme,\r\nparce qu'il n'y a pas de guerre plus difficile à terminer que celle-là. La\r\npolitique coloniale est un luxe que nous aurions pu nous donner dans un\r\nautre temps, mais que ne nous convient pas dans notre situation européenne.\r\nElle a de plus été conduite d'une façon irrégulière, l'action au Tonkin\r\nsuccédant à l'inaction en Egypte. Cette affaire d'Egypte aurait pu servir\r\nde base à une entente avec l'Angleterre. Au lieu de cela on n'a pas voulu\r\nl'aider, puis on a boudé parce qu'elle agissait seule, et lorsque les\r\ndifficultés ont commencé pour elle, on n'a su ni s'entendre absolument\r\npour agir en commun, ni s'effacer derrière l'Europe pour ne pas assumer la\r\nresponsabilité de l'echec de la conférence. Bien des gens croient ici que\r\ntoute cette politique a eu pour but de sauver le ministère Gladstone. Cela\r\nn'en valait pas la peine. Il en est résulté de l'aigreur dans les journaux.\r\nMais cette aigreur sent bien un peu le fonds des reptiles, et personne n'a\r\nsérieusement envie de chercher querelle à la perfide Albion.\r\n\r\nCeux qui admirent ses institutions et qui croient que leur pondération est\r\nla garantie du plus précieux de tous les biens--la liberté, se préoccupent\r\nvivement des tendances jacobines de notre ami Gladstone. L'extension du\r\nsuffrage est logique, l'anéantissement de la chambre des Lords est logique.\r\nMais les meilleures institutions ne sont pas les plus logiques. À force de\r\nlogique on tend à remplacer le gouvernement pondéré de l'Angleterre par ce\r\nque nous appelons le gouvernement conventionnel, c'est à dire le despotisme\r\nd'une Assemblée unique appuyée sur la brutale loi du nombre. Que Dieu vous\r\ngarde d'un tel avenir. C'est le voeu d'un ami sincère de vos institutions.\r\n\r\nCe qui préoccupe ici bien plus, et à bon titre, que les aventures\r\ncoloniales, c'est la situation économique. La France s'appauvrit parce\r\nqu'elle perd en impôts improductifs une partie de son épargne, parce que\r\nses fils travaillent moins, dépensent plus et boivent davantage, parce\r\nqu'ils demandent des salaires trop élevés, et parce que la concurrence\r\nallemande, américaine, italienne, anglaise, nous ferme peu à peu tous les\r\nmarchés, et enfin parce que le phylloxera ruine la moitié du pays. Le\r\ncourant protectionniste se prononce avec une force irrésistible en ce\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie d'offrir mes hommages à Madame et à Mademoiselle Reeve, et de\r\nme croire Votre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE COMTE DE PARIS.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\nParis, 19 octobre.\r\n\r\nCher Monsieur Reeve,--J'ai reçu le numéro de la _Revue d'Edimbourg_, et je\r\nvous en remercie. Le rédacteur de l'article a été plein de bienveillance à\r\nmon égard, et je vous prie de lui faire savoir que je suis fort touché de\r\nl'appréciation qu'il veut bien faire de mes travaux. Je profiterai de ses\r\njustes critiques pour mes autres traductions; mais il est un point où je ne\r\nsuis pas tout à fait d'accord avec lui. Je ne trouve pas qu'il tienne assez\r\ncompte à Aristote d'avoir commencé la science, et de l'avoir fondée.\r\nLes débuts sont toujours excessivement difficiles, et il ne serait pas\r\néquitable de demander à ces temps reculés de savoir tout ce que nous savons\r\naujourd'hui. Nous devons toujours nous dire que dans deux mille ans d'ici\r\non en saura beaucoup plus que nous, tout savants que nous sommes. Ceci doit\r\nnous engager à être reconnaissants et modestes.\r\n\r\nJe vais mettre sous presse le Traité des Parties des Animaux en deux\r\nvolumes, et je prépare celui de la Génération, qui, sans doute, en aura\r\ntrois.\r\n\r\nJ'espère que vous vous portez bien, ainsi que Madame Henry Reeve; je lui\r\nprésente mes respects et mes amitiés, avec tons mes voeux pour sa santé et\r\npour la vôtre.\r\n\r\nVotre bien dévoué,\r\n\r\nB. ST.-HILAIRE.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here has:--\r\n\r\n_October 28th_.--Dinner of The Club to Lord Dufferin before his departure\r\nfor India.\r\n\r\n_November 14th_.--Dinner at Lady Molesworth's to the Waddingtons.\r\n\r\n_December 3rd_.--Small dinner at Lord Cork's, with Gladstone and Sir H.\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Henry Taylor_\r\n\r\nBournemouth, December 10th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--It has come into the head of my family, and through theirs\r\ninto mine, that there is no particular reason why my Autobiography should\r\nnot be published now, instead of posthumously, and that there are some\r\nmotives for giving a preference to present publication. The agreement\r\nwith Messrs. Longman which you brought about has been, perhaps, a sort of\r\nsuggestion of this change of purpose; so I write to mention it. The work\r\nwas written with more unreserve than would be natural to a man who hears\r\nwhat he says, and some erasures will be required; but a man in his\r\neighty-fifth year is, in some respects, as good as dead, or, at all\r\nevents, as deaf: so there need not be much alteration. I hope you will not\r\ndisapprove.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nHENRY TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nOn December 17th the Reeves went to Foxholes, where they spent Christmas,\r\nushered in the New Year, and returned to London on January 15th, 1885. The\r\nentries in the Journal are for the most part trivial, though politically\r\nthe year was one of extreme interest and excitement, much of which is\r\nreflected in the correspondence.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\n6 _janvier_.--J'ai été vivement touché de la lettre que vous m'avez écrite,\r\ndes voeux que vous m'adressez au moment où nous entrons dans une année qui\r\nsemble nous réserver bien des surprises. L'avenir est plein d'incertitudes\r\net de dangers. Je n'ai pas besoin de vous dire que j'observe avec une\r\nsérieuse inquiétude l'état des relations entre l'Angleterre et la France,\r\nnon que je croie même à la possibilité d'un conflit qui répugnerait\r\négalement à tous les membres des deux nations voisines, mais parce qu'une\r\nhostilité diplomatique seule serait déjà un grand malheur pour l'une et\r\npour l'autre.... Vous avez raison de croire que le désir universel de la\r\npaix prévaudra sur les périls de la situation internationale. Ce désir\r\nest bien puissant en France, et les aventures de l'extrême Orient, dans\r\nlesquelles on nous a lancés si mal à propos, ne font que lui donner\r\nl'occasion de se manifester.\r\n\r\nCes aventures ne font pas diversion à la crise si grave qui éprouve notre\r\nindustrie et notre agriculture. Les causes de cette crise sont multiples.\r\nQuelques-unes sont communes à toute l'Europe, d'autres le sont aux quelques\r\nnations qui avaient le monopole de certaines industries, et le\r\nperdent, grâce aux facilités actuelles des transports. Il en est une,\r\nmalheureusement très-active, qui nous est propre; c'est la tendance des\r\nouvriers depuis l'établissement de la Rèpublique à chercher l'amélioration\r\nde leur sort, moins dans l'accroissement de leur salaire que dans la\r\ndiminution de leur travail. Cette funeste tendance leur a été inspirée\r\npar les flatteries de tous ceux qui briguent leurs suffrages, et leur\r\nrappellent que toute législation émane d'eux. Le pays produit moins, et\r\npar conséquent s'appauvrit. L'imprévoyance de nos gouvernants a aggravé\r\nla crise. Aujourd'hui un cri puissant s'élève en faveur des droits\r\nprotecteurs, même sur le blé. Il est probable qu'on en fera assez pour\r\ninquiéter les consommateurs des villes, pas assez pour satisfaire\r\nl'agriculture.... Si Mademoiselle Reeve voulait faire de jolies pêches de\r\ntruites, c'est le 1er juin qu'elle devrait venir à Eu.\r\n\r\n_From the Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\n_Inveraray, February 13th_.--The Nile affair is too miserable. No possible\r\nissue can be otherwise than a misfortune. The despatch in which the\r\nGovernment asked Gordon to advise them how to relieve him--in April last,\r\nwhen he was closely beleaguered--reads like a horrible joke now.\r\n\r\nA horrible joke indeed:--for on February 5th news had come of the fall of\r\nKhartoum and the death of Gordon. On the 26th a vote of censure on the\r\nGovernment was carried in the House of Lords by 189 to 63; but a similar\r\nmotion in the Commons was rejected by 302 to 288. The Government majority\r\nhad fallen from 56 to 14.\r\n\r\nOn March 8th a special service was held in the Temple Church to commemorate\r\nthe completion of the seventh century since its consecration. [Footnote:\r\nSee _ante_, p. 322.] The Master preached the sermon on the text Psalm xc.\r\n1--'Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.' [Footnote:\r\nThe _Times_ of March 9th gave a pretty full abstract of the sermon.] Reeve,\r\nwho was present, considered it one of Dr. Vaughan's happiest efforts,\r\nand wrote to say how greatly he had been pleased by it. Vaughan's\r\nacknowledgement of the kindly feeling which dictated the letter has\r\notherwise no particular interest.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Alfred Lyall_ [Footnote: At that time lieutenant-governor of the\r\nNorth-West Provinces.]\r\n\r\n_March 31st_.--When we closed in 1881 the second act of the Affghan drama,\r\nI calculated on an interval of at least five years; and I thought that if\r\nwe could get a joint commission to settle some boundary that Russia could\r\nprovisionally agree to, the interval might be longer. But the Boundary\r\nCommission, which I first pressed for in 1881, has propelled, instead of\r\ndelaying, the crisis. I suppose our Egyptian entanglement seemed to Russia\r\nto offer an irresistible opportunity; at any rate, the Russians have some\r\nreason for precipitating the issue between us, and at this moment we may be\r\non the verge of a war. It is very curious to find ourselves so close to the\r\ncollision that we have been so long trying to fend off, and to realise that\r\na land invasion of India by a European Power, which has been the nightmare\r\nof Anglo-Indian statesmen since Bonaparte seized Egypt in 1798, is now no\r\nlonger a matter of remote speculation. The Russian menace is, however,\r\nalready producing one result that I had always anticipated; it is evoking\r\namong all substantial classes of Indians a strong desire to support the\r\nBritish Government in India. You may remember that in my paper of January\r\n1884 I wrote that the natives would, in times of rumoured invasion, hold by\r\nany Power that could keep the gates of India against Central Asia; and this\r\nis now strongly showing itself. The adventurous classes are ready to\r\nenlist and follow our colours; the propertied classes look to us as the\r\nrepresentatives of order and security; the educated classes depend wholly\r\nupon our system; if the Russians calculate on any serious rising against\r\nus in India, they will be mistaken. Of course a series of reverses would\r\nchange the whole face of affairs.... We are very fortunate in having Lord\r\nDufferin here at this time. Everyone likes him, and has confidence in him.\r\nHe is clearly a Viceroy who listens to everyone, but makes up his own mind\r\nindependently. And Lady Dufferin charms us all....\r\n\r\nThe Mahdi's fortunes do not interest India. The talk in some of the papers\r\nabout the necessity of smashing him, in order to avert the risk of some\r\ngeneral Mahomedan uprising, is futile and imaginative. The Indians think\r\nthe English rather mad to go crusading against him in the Soudan, and they\r\nmay soon get irritated at the waste of Indian lives at Suakin, when we want\r\nour best men on the N.W. frontier; but, for the rest, they do not concern\r\nthemselves about remote Arab tribes. Of course everyone sees that the\r\nEnglish Government has now an excellent pretext for getting partially out\r\nof a hopeless mess by transferring most of our English troops from the Red\r\nSea to the Punjab.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn April 9th news reached London that on March 30th the Russians, under\r\nGeneral Komaroff, had attacked and carried the Affghan positions at\r\nPenjdeh, concerning which negotiations were going on. As our Government was\r\npledged meanwhile to the support of the Amir, this action of Komaroff's was\r\nheld to be a very aggravated insult to England. Explanations were demanded,\r\nbut preparations for war were hurried on, and on April 27th, after an\r\nimpassioned speech by Mr. Gladstone, a vote of credit for eleven millions\r\nwas passed almost by acclamation. The negotiations, however, were\r\ncontinued; explanations were given: the Russians kept Penjdeh; the Affghans\r\nhad lost their territory, their guns, and 500 men; and Mr. Gladstone\r\nexpressed himself satisfied. Four days afterwards, May 8th, the Government\r\nwas defeated on the budget, and resigned a few days later, the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury forming the new ministry.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Alfred Lyall_\r\n\r\n_June 5th_.--Probably you know more in England than we do in India of the\r\ncourse of negotiations with Russia, It seems just now more smooth than\r\nsatisfactory. I fear we have lost credit in India over that unlucky Penjdeh\r\nbusiness. One would fancy that our representatives on the spot might have\r\nbeen wary enough to discern that where the Russians and the Affghans were\r\ndrawing close to each other, there lay the risk and the strain of the\r\nsituation. I have a very moderate trust in our ally the Amir, though he is\r\na very able, if unscrupulous, ruler. I hope fervently he has sense enough\r\nnot to use those breech-loaders we are sending in such quantities, and that\r\nhe won't repeat the Penjdeh blunder by provoking some collision with the\r\nRussians on his border....\r\n\r\nIndia is very quiet. The Russian scare of the spring has turned rather to\r\nour advantage, as I always prophesied it would, by bringing home to the\r\nnatives their dependence on England for protection from foreign invasion.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Henry Taylor_\r\n\r\n_Bournemouth, July 14th_.--I have just read the excellent article in the\r\n'Edinburgh Review' on my Autobiography; and as there is no amount of\r\nkindness on your part which I cannot believe in, I am disposed to think\r\nthat it is you who have written it. [Footnote: It was written by Reeve.]\r\nWhoever it is, I should like him to know that I am very thankful.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Alfred Lyall_\r\n\r\n_August 1st_--India is now perfectly quiet; but the new generation of\r\nhungry, ambitious, English-speaking natives are persuading themselves\r\nthat they can have all the benefits of English rule without the burden of\r\nEnglish officialism. If they are encouraged and supported by the English\r\n_Demos_, there will be confusion before long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn August 14th Parliament was prorogued, with the clear understanding that\r\nthe dissolution would follow. This, however, was put off for three months,\r\nduring which time the country was turned upside down by the excitement of\r\nthe electoral campaign and the unbridled license which many of the most\r\ndistinguished candidates permitted themselves; rank Socialism, the\r\nabolition of property, 'three acres and a cow,' being freely spoken of by\r\nthe irresponsible, and hinted at, in no obscure language, by some who had\r\nborne office in the Gladstone ministry. By a curious coincidence, the\r\nFrench elections were nearly synchronous with ours, and the results were\r\nkeenly watched by one, at least, of Reeve's correspondents. But of all this\r\nexcitement and agitation the Journal has no trace. The only entries of any\r\ninterest are:--\r\n\r\nFoxholes: very hot: no rain for two months.\r\n\r\n_August 22nd_.--Excursion to Studland with the Denisons, Lord Canterbury,\r\nand Prothero.\r\n\r\n_26th_.--To Malvern with Hopie; 27th, Worcester; 28th, Tewkesbury; 29th,\r\nHereford Cathedral; then Boss, Monmouth, and Chepstow.\r\n\r\n_September 1st_.--Chepstow Castle, Tintern Abbey, then to Clifton across\r\nthe Severn. 2nd, rain, so returned to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\n18 _septembre_.--Je m'empresse de vous remercier de votre lettre du 15, qui\r\nm'est parvenue hier. Vous savez avec quel plaisir je reçois toujours de\r\nvos nouvelles, avec quel intérêt je lis toujours vos appreciations sur la\r\nsituation de nos deux pays. Malgré de bien grandes différences dans l'état\r\npolitique, qui sont tout à l'avantage du vôtre, et dans l'état social, qui\r\nle sont peut-étre moins, ces deux situations ne sont pas sans analogies.\r\nLes modérés, de part et d'autre, comme vous le dites, semblent être\r\npeu écoutés, et cependant je suis persuadé que leurs vues finiront par\r\nl'emporter des deux côtés du détroit, parce que, sous une surface agitée en\r\napparence, aucune passion violente ne bouillonne dans l'une ou l'autre des\r\ndeux nations. Vous avez devant vous le grand inconnu de la nouvelle loi\r\nélectorale; dangereux, parce que l'omnipotence de la Chambre des Communes,\r\nfavorable au gouvernement parlementaire lorsque cette Chambre se recrutait\r\nexclusivement dans la haute classe et en avait l'esprit, pourra être un\r\ninstrument redoutable pour la liberté et pour toute l'organisation sociale\r\nle jour où MM. Chamberlain, Parnell et Bradlaugh auront chacun un parti\r\nderrière eux. Heureusement pour vous, l'institution monarchique vous\r\npermettra de traverser la crise qu'entraînera la modification de la\r\ncomposition et de l'esprit de la Chambre des Communes. Grâce à cette\r\ninstitution, l'esprit politique du pays pourra rétablir l'équilibre entre\r\nles pouvoirs publics. En France, l'expérience de la République démocratique\r\net pacifique s'est faite dans les conditions les plus favorables, et a\r\néchoué. Elle n'est ni conservatrice ni réformatrice. Tout en restant\r\nbourgeoise, elle est pardessus tout prodigue. Les classes qui payent\r\nl'impôt sont parfaitement édifiées sur son compte; celles qui nele\r\npayent pas, et qui votent cependant, sont frappées indirectement par\r\nl'appauvrissement national et commencent à s'étonner que la République,\r\ndont le nom les flatte encore, réponde si mal à leur attente. La République\r\nreste bourgeoise parce que le suffrage universel est trop défiant pour\r\nchercher des représentants dans le sein de la classe la plus nombreuse.\r\nMais il n'est pas difficile dans les choix qu'il fait dans les rangs d'une\r\nclasse plus élevée. Le niveau intellectuel et moral des Assemblées qu'il\r\nélit s'abaisse à chaque renouvellement. C'est un fait qu'il faudra accepter\r\ndésormais comme inévitable, et dont il faudra tenir compte dans l'avenir.\r\nLa République est essentiellement prodigue parce que, toute la machine\r\ngouvernementale reposant sur l'élection, les ministres sont obligés de\r\ndonner aux deputés des places innombrables pour satisfaire la foule encore\r\nplus nombreuse de leurs agents électoraux, et de permettre des travaux, des\r\ndépenses exagérés dans chaque arrondissement, ici pour favoriser le député\r\nrépublicain, là pour nuire au député conservateur. C'est par là qu'elle\r\npérira, parce que le mal est sans remède et s'aggrave chaque jour. Loi\r\ngénérale d'ailleurs. C'est par les finances que périssent les gouvernements\r\ndéfinitivement condamnés: témoin l'ancien regime. Cette mort-là est sans\r\nrésurrection.\r\n\r\nLe caractère nouveau de la période électorale qui s'est ouverte\r\npratiquement depuis quelques mois est le réveil des Conservateurs. Ils\r\ncomprennent enfin qu'ils peuvent et doivent lutter pour défendre la société\r\nmenacée, les richesses nationales compromises. Ils apportent à cette lutte\r\nune ardeur tout à fait nouvelle. Depuis deux ans [Footnote: Since the death\r\nof the Comte de Chambord.] je me suis efforcé de faire comprendre à nos\r\namis que la politique avait sub les mêèmes transformations que la guerre;\r\nque, pour gagner la victoire sur le terrain politique, il ne fallait rien\r\nlaisser au hasard, rien confier aux petites coteries; qu'il fallait agir\r\navec de gros bataillons, et que, pour les mouvoir il fallait un système de\r\nmobilisation aussi parfait que celui de l'armée allemande. Ces conseils ont\r\nété suivis, et les monarchistes se sont préparés à entreprendre la\r\nlutte électorale avec une organisation de comités de départeméent,\r\nd'arrondissement et de canton, appuyés le plus souvent sur des réunions\r\nplénières qui marquent un grand changement dans la vie politique du parti\r\nconservateur. Cette organisation se perfectionnera dans les élections\r\nmêmes. Elle doit donner un jour, et par l'élection et par l'action plus\r\npuissante encore de l'opinion publique, le pouvoir à ceux qui l'auront\r\nconstituée et qui sauront s'en servir.\r\n\r\nA la veille des elections... tandis que tous les autres partis faisaient\r\nfaire leur programme par un petit comité parisien, craignant qu'une grande\r\nréunion ne trahît leurs divisions, les monarchistes ont envoyé des quatre\r\ncoins de la France des délégués qui, tous animés du même esprit, ont adopté\r\npar acclamation le programme soumis à leur approbation. Je dois même dire\r\nque nous avons tous été frappés de leur extrême modération. Pas une voix ne\r\ns'est élevée pour réclamer en faveur d'un ton plus aggressif. Le programme,\r\nretouché sur place par une commission de neuf membres, avait, vous le\r\npensez bien, été soigneusement préparé d'avance; toutes les expressions en\r\navaient été pesées. Aussi suis-je heureux qu'il ait eu l'approbation d'un\r\naussi bon juge que vous.\r\n\r\n21 _septembre_.--Depuis gue je vous al écrit, j'ai lu le grand manifeste\r\nde M. Gladstone. De celui-là, on ne peut pas dire qu'il brille par la\r\nmodération. Il y a des phrases redoutables et effrayantes à l'adresse de la\r\nrichesse et de la propriété, base de la société. Jamais je n'aurais cru le\r\nGladstone que j'ai connu capable de parler de la Chambre des pairs comme il\r\nle fait. Et cependant, une profonde modification dans la composition de\r\nla Chambre Haute ne sera-t-elle pas un jour le salut de la cause et des\r\nintérêts conservateurs en Angleterre? Si cette Chambre se retrempe au\r\nmoins partiellement dans l'élection, elle y trouvera, peut-être, une force\r\ncapable de lui assurer dans le gouvernement une part au moins égale à celle\r\nde la Chambre des Communes, au moment où celle-ci baissera en valeur morale\r\nproportionnellement à l'extension du suffrage....\r\n\r\nEn ce moment, il serait bien désirable, également en France et en\r\nAngleterre, de voir les modérés de nuances diverses se rapprocher, pour\r\nformer un véritable parti conservateur: chez vous, anciens whigs et anciens\r\ntories; chez nous, les centres droits et les centres gauches. Mais c'est\r\nentre ceux qui sont le plus rapprochés en politique que le souvenir des\r\nluttes passées laisse les plus profondes rancunes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_October 12th_--Went to town for the Riel [Footnote: Louis Riel had\r\nstirred up a rebellion in Manitoba, had been captured, tried, and sentenced\r\nto death. He appealed, and the case thus came before the Judicial\r\nCommittee. On October 22nd the appeal was dismissed, and on November 16th\r\nRiel was duly hanged at Regina.] case. Dined with Captain Bridge [Footnote:\r\nNow Rear-Admiral Bridge, lately commander-in-chief on the Australian\r\nstation.] at the United Service Club.\r\n\r\n_14th_.--Second part of 'Greville' published; 2,700 copies subscribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the tremendous excitement caused by the publication of\r\nthe first part of the Greville Memoirs, the second part attracted little\r\nnotice, although large sales testified to the interest it raised. Reeve\r\nmentions 2,700 as the number of copies subscribed for: but the first\r\nedition of 4,000 was exhausted almost immediately, and a second large\r\nedition was sold out within a few months.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 28th_--I am much obliged to you for your note. We might\r\nelect three new members of The Club, because there remain two vacancies\r\ncaused by the honorary list, besides the death of Houghton. I should very\r\nmuch like to see Edward Stanhope and Harry Holland in The Club. They are\r\namong the most rising men of the day--accomplished and agreeable--and their\r\nfathers were respectively two of our most faithful members. We should,\r\nI think, choose men from the younger generation, for many of us are\r\nfrightfully old. It is more difficult to point out eligible men in the\r\nliterary or scientific world. To say the truth, there is a remarkable\r\ndearth of distinguished authors. Violent politicians are objectionable.\r\n\r\nI am very much gratified by what you say of the new volumes of Greville's\r\nJournals. Your estimate of their value exactly coincides with my own. I am\r\nhappy to say that I have not yet heard that anyone is annoyed or offended.\r\nI sent a copy to Henry Ponsonby, who laid it before the Queen, but I have\r\nnot heard what sentence Her Majesty has passed upon me.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of political noise, but very little light. In the\r\nsouth of England I think the Conservatives will carry a good many seats. If\r\nI were to venture on a prognostic, I should say that the opposition will\r\nhave a majority in Great Britain, though by no means so large a one as the\r\nRadicals expect. The effect of this would be that the Irish can turn the\r\nscale, and I think Mr. Parnell would refuse, for the present, to turn out\r\nthe present Government in order to bring in Mr. Gladstone. In that case,\r\nthe existence of the present ministry may be prolonged for some time, but\r\nit would be on sufferance and by Irish support. On the other hand, if a\r\nLiberal Government were formed, it could only exist with the support of the\r\nIrish vote. Eventually, I hope, this anomalous state of things may bring\r\nthe moderate men of both the British parties together, and throw both\r\nextremes into opposition. That, I am convinced, is the real wish of the\r\ncountry, and the obstacles to such a combination are chiefly personal.\r\nI fancy the next parliaments will be very impracticable and probably\r\nshortlived.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\n22 _novembre._--Je vous remercie de ce que vous me dites à propos des\r\nMémoires de M. Greville. [Footnote: Sc. that there were passages in it not\r\ncomplimentary to the Orleans family.]\r\n\r\nJe comprends parfaitement que vous ne pouviez supprimer certains passages\r\ndont vous ne voulez cependant pas assumer la solidarité. Ces passages\r\nne m'empêcheront pas de lire avec intérêt la suite des oeuvres de cet\r\nobservateur peu bien-veillant, mais fin et spirituel.\r\n\r\nNe croyez pas que je vous écrive avec d'autre pensée que de faire part de\r\nmes vues à un êtranger qui connaît, comprend et aime la France.\r\n\r\nOn November 18th Parliament was dissolved by proclamation and the elections\r\nwere held from the 23rd to December 18th. In the English towns, where the\r\nelections were first held, the Conservatives had a large majority, and it\r\nseemed as if they were going to sweep the board. In the counties, however,\r\nthe 'three acres and a cow' was taken by the ignorant rustics, just\r\nadmitted to the franchise, as a splendid reality, and their votes went\r\nstrongly in favour of the Liberals, or rather--as it would be more correct\r\nto say--the Radicals. Mr. Gladstone had appealed to the country to give him\r\na working majority. He had, in fact, a majority of eighty-four over the\r\nConservatives; but the Irish, or so-called Nationalist, party numbered\r\neighty-six; and as these were bound by their bond of union to oppose the\r\nGovernment, whatever it was, they had to be counted with the Conservatives\r\nas soon as the Conservative Government had fallen. And the comparison of\r\nthe numbers showed that it must fall as soon as Parliament met. As Reeve\r\nhad forecast, neither party could form an effective administration without\r\nthe support of the Nationalists, a position which seemed for the moment to\r\nrender them the arbiters of the nation's destiny.\r\n\r\n_From Count Vitzthum_\r\n\r\nParis, December 1st.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--Many thanks for your kind letter. You will find me here\r\nin my winter quarters until the end of May, then from June to the end of\r\nOctober at Baden-Baden, where we have built a villa. I would always be\r\nhappy to see you and talk over old times.\r\n\r\nI have just finished reading the third volume of Greville's Memoirs and\r\nhave been very much struck by your notes, without which some passages would\r\nnot have been intelligible. Old Greville was a portrait-painter rather in\r\nRembrandt's style. In putting together all he says of Palmerston, Peel, and\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, very remarkable full-length portraits would come\r\nout. He seems rather partial for John Russell.\r\n\r\nMy little book makes more noise in Germany than I expected. W. Oncken, the\r\ncelebrated historian of Austria and Prussia in 1813, will review it for\r\nthe 'Allgemeine Zeitung,' and the Vienna press has been unexpectedly\r\nfavourable. An English friend of mine wants to translate it. I think it\r\nwould be 'love's labour lost;' for everybody who cares for such trifles and\r\nphotographs taken on the spot understands German nowadays in England, and\r\nwill prefer the original. Still, if you thought it worth your while to send\r\na short notice to the 'Times,' it would be a favour. My old friend Delane\r\nis no more, else I should have asked him. Cotta writes me that he has\r\nsecured the English copyright, and sent some copies to the principal\r\nReviews and the 'Times.' Believe me, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nVITZTHUM.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nChâteau d'Eu, 9 décembre.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve,--Un de mes amis va partir pour la Belgique. Je\r\ntiens à en profiter pour lui confier une lettre à votre adresse, qu'il\r\nmettra à la poste chez nos voisins. En effet, je connais par expérience\r\nI'indiscrétion dont la poste française a pris la mauvaise habitude sous\r\nl'Empire, habitude qu'elle n'a pas perdue sous la République. J'ai hâte de\r\nvous remercier de votre lettre du lr qui m'a vivement intéressé. J'ai été\r\nun peu confus d'apprendre l'usage que vous aviez fait de la mienne, car\r\nje l'avais écrite au courant de la plume, et uniquement pour me donner le\r\nplaisir de causer avec vous. Mais, puisque vous l'avez trouvée bonne à\r\nmontrer, je m'en rapporte à votre amitié, et j'espère qu'elle n'a pas été\r\ntrop indulgente. Je suis d'ailleurs fort heureux d'avoir quelquefois, par\r\nvotre intermédiaire, des relations avec Lord Salisbury, pour le caractère\r\net le talent duquel j'ai toujours eu une si haute estime, et que j'aime\r\nd'ailleurs toujours à considérer comme mon proche voisin de campagne.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Conservatives in the towns, their defeat in the country,\r\nis the very opposite of what is taking place here; so that we foreigners\r\nmust exercise great reserve in giving an opinion on the political situation\r\ncreated in England by these last elections. It is, however, evident\r\nthat there, as everywhere else, the old parties are in process of\r\ndisintegration, and that, in a new social state, in presence of new\r\nproblems, a new distribution of parties is called for. In the history of\r\nall nations there are periods when the need of political progress renders\r\nit necessary for the reformers to remain long in power; and if from time to\r\ntime they yield it to their adversaries, it should only be for long enough\r\nto recover breath in climbing the long ascent. On the other hand, there\r\nare also periods when the wearied people long for repose; when progress no\r\nlonger aims at completeness, but at change; when reforms are mere Utopian\r\nfancies or appeals to evil passions; and when the partisans of the _status\r\nquo_ ought to have the direction of affairs for as long a time as possible.\r\nI believe that we are now entering on one of these periods. But it becomes\r\nthe duty of the Conservatives to defend existing institutions by taking the\r\ninitiative in such modifications as may be necessary. This is what, with a\r\ntrue political insight, they have always done in England. The vote of the\r\ncounties does not affect the justice of your appreciation of the general\r\ncharacter of the elections. It is not a return to the old Tory party, but\r\nrather the condemnation of the Radical programme; and from this point of\r\nview they have an international importance which nothing can weaken. All\r\nthe same, this vote of the counties seems to me to render absolutely\r\nnecessary the modification of parties which the complete success of the\r\nMinistry would have postponed. After the redistribution of seats, there\r\nis need of a redistribution of persons and of political groupings. Either\r\nParliament will be controlled by the Irish Nationalists, and Ireland by Mr.\r\nParnell, or, in opposition to the Nationalists and the Radicals, there will\r\nbe formed a Government which will be Conservative in its respect for\r\nthe great social institutions, in its antagonism to the levelling and\r\ncentralising spirit, and withal Liberal in the manner in which it will\r\nhandle the agrarian question.\r\n\r\nJudging by what I see here, where over three millions of rural proprietors\r\nare 'a tower of strength' for the Conservatives, I am persuaded that in\r\nEngland also the Conservatives have no greater interest--after the defeat\r\nof the socialist and revolutionary plans of Mr. Chamberlain--than to work\r\nvigorously at the formation of a numerous class of small landowners.\r\n_Mutatis mutandis_, we have here also the corresponding phenomenon of the\r\ntransformation of parties. We are unquestionably entering on a period of\r\nlassitude. The Conservatives have gained one hundred and twenty seats at\r\nthe last elections, for four principal reasons, all of which spring from\r\nthe faults of their adversaries.\r\n\r\n1. The Tonkin expedition.\r\n\r\n2. The waste of the national and municipal finances.\r\n\r\n3. The aggravation of the agricultural and industrial crises by the gross\r\nerrors in the conclusion of treaties of commerce and the establishment of\r\ntransit tariffs.\r\n\r\n4. The war on the clergy, foreshadowing the separation of Church and State.\r\n\r\nTo these particular reasons must be added the general dissatisfaction with\r\nan administration at once weak and corrupt, which is not in accord with\r\nthose instincts which a thousand years of monarchy have impressed on our\r\nmanners and tone of thought.\r\n\r\nThe moderate Republicans have been beaten because they allied themselves\r\nwith the Radicals, and because they themselves have not shown the governing\r\nqualities which could gain the confidence of the country. If the check\r\nhas not been still greater, it is because the country has a horror of all\r\nchange; because the interest of the Government is exceedingly strong;\r\nbecause the electors do not care to vote for the opposition candidate, who\r\ncannot do anything for them; and lastly, because, at the second _tour de\r\nscrutin_, the Government, in the most shameless manner, brought pressure to\r\nbear on all who are directly or indirectly dependent on it, the number of\r\nwhom is very great.\r\n\r\nWe have then two hundred Conservatives deputies, who represent three and a\r\nhalf millions of electors. Three-fourths of these are Monarchists more or\r\nless avowed; one-fourth represents the Bonapartist element, and among these\r\nlast are many with whom I have well-established personal relations. It is\r\nnot, however, the part of this large minority to set forth any opinions as\r\nto the form of the Government, nor even to cause obstruction; still less to\r\nally itself with the Radicals for the vain satisfaction of overturning the\r\nMinistry. Its aim must always be to promote the passing of Conservative\r\nlaws, and by every possible means to oppose such Radical measures as will\r\nbe proposed to the Chamber. It is for this that it has been elected. If it\r\nfulfils its task aright, when the dissolution comes--and this cannot be\r\nfar off--it will reap the fruits of its policy. It will have merited\r\nthe country's confidence, which the Radicals will have lost; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the pressure, perhaps even the violence of the Government,\r\nthe current of public opinion will be so strong that it will send a\r\nConservative majority to the Palais Bourbon. Under the influence of this\r\ncurrent we may hope to see the collective or individual conversion of\r\nthe moderate Republicans, which must lead to the reconstruction of the\r\nConservative party and to placing the direction of it in the hands of the\r\nMonarchists. For, though by temperament these moderate Republicans ought\r\nto be the last to come to us, the Radical danger must bring them; they are\r\nbound to come; their place is marked in our ranks. They will never go to\r\nBonapartism: on the contrary, they will one day enable us to rid ourselves\r\nof the _intransigeunt_ element which forms a disturbing minority in the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThis will be the work of to-morrow. To-day, the principal task which I\r\nrecommend to my friends is the reconstitution, or rather the creation, of\r\nthe 'active list' of the Conservative array. We have the model in Belgium.\r\nPeople are beginning to understand that the Conservatives cannot remain for\r\never on the sufferance of the Government. No Government shall he stable\r\nbut that which they can support. For this they must form a compact and\r\nwell-organised party. Encouraged by the results of the elections, every one\r\nhas set to work with new ardour. My only trouble at present is the utter\r\ninexperience of the Conservative minority. It is made up of men almost all\r\nof whom are new to Parliament, are unacquainted with each other, and as\r\nyet are without a leader. I reckon, however, that such blunders as it may\r\ncommit will be balanced and amended by those of its opponents.\r\n\r\nJe tennine sur cette pensée consolante, et je vous prie de me croire.\r\n\r\nVotre bien affectionné,\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE COMTE DE PARIS.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare with this another view of the French elections\r\nand of the probable course of events, taken from a very different\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\n_From the Due de Broglie_\r\n\r\n8 _novembre_.--Vous avez vu le rèsultat de nos élections, qui ont été plus\r\nheureuses pour la cause générale du parti conservateur que pour ce qui me\r\nregarde particulièrement. Si nous ne vivions pas dans un temps oú toutes\r\nles prévisions sont trompées par une certaine inertie générale qui amortit\r\ntoutes les passions et ralentit le cours naturel des événements, je\r\ncroirais qu'une crise violente est assez prochaine, les éléments extrêmes\r\nse trouvant réums et rapprochés dans l'Assemblée nouvelle, de manière à\r\nformer un mélange explosible comme la chimie redoute d'en amener. De part\r\nni d'autre, d'ailleurs, il n'y a d'homme en état de diriger les événements;\r\nils iront done probablement tout seuls, commes des chevaux qui n'ont pas de\r\ncocher, ce qui est le moyen à peu près sûr d'aller dans le fossé.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nRETIREMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas and the early days of the New Year were passed at Foxholes. On\r\nJanuary 15th the Reeves returned to Rutland Gate. Parliament met on\r\nthe 21st, and, as had been foreseen, the Government was defeated on an\r\namendment to the Address. Lord Salisbury's resignation was announced on\r\nFebruary 1st, and, on the 3rd, Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet was formed, Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt being Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Rosebery Foreign\r\nSecretary, and Mr. John Morley Secretary for Ireland. Sir Henry James,\r\nnow Lord James of Hereford, declined the office of Lord Chancellor; Lord\r\nHartington, the present Duke of Devonshire, declined office of any sort in\r\na Ministry whose policy, as yet but dimly shown, was generally understood\r\nto be on the lines of advanced Radicalism. For his part, Reeve abhorred\r\nRadicalism. He had never approved of Gladstone as a politician, and now\r\nless than ever. He looked on him as a danger to the Empire, to be fought\r\nagainst, to be resisted, to be crushed. Nor was he singular in this. It\r\nis customary to speak of the extraordinary influence which Gladstone\r\nexercised. It was this influence, directed by sentiment or by vanity, which\r\nconstituted the danger. There were many who believed the country to be\r\non the eve of a violent, perhaps a sanguinary, revolution, fomented and\r\nabetted by Mr. Gladstone; and this belief was strengthened when, on\r\nFebruary 8th, an East-end mob, meeting in Trafalgar Square, was allowed,\r\nwithout opposition, to march by Pall Mall, St. James' Street and\r\nPiccadilly, to Hyde Park, breaking the windows and plundering the shops on\r\nthe way. When to this supposed revolutionary tendency of the new Ministry\r\nwas added their avowed intention to bring in a measure for the pacification\r\nof Ireland, which--in the absence of details--was believed to mean the\r\ndisintegration of the kingdom, the feeling of alarm, which must be very\r\nwell remembered by many who read these pages, can be easily understood.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Ebury_ [Footnote: Lord Ebury died at the age of 92, in 1893.]\r\n\r\nMoor Park, January 4th, 1886.\r\n\r\nDear Reeve,--Allow me to wish you and Mrs. Reeve a happy New Year, and\r\nto say how much I have been interested in the second part of our common\r\nfriend's Memoirs, which--if you care to know it--pleased me more than the\r\nfirst; but the most characteristic passage of the writer, and which made me\r\nlaugh aloud, is the three pages in which he vents all his wrath against the\r\npublic for their approbation of Lady Blessington as an authoress, and the\r\npedestal upon which they placed her. I was glad to read the editor's note,\r\nwhich completed the page. When once he got into that sort of mood, and\r\nperhaps was influenced by a touch of gout, and let himself go, it was very\r\nfunny to listen to him; and really he was a good-natured man. I wonder\r\nwhat he would have said of Parnell and his ragged regiment, and the G. O.\r\nM.[Footnote: As even in twelve years the name has become quite obsolete, it\r\nmay be as well to note that Mr. Gladstone was generally designated by these\r\nletters, said by his friends and admirers to stand for Grand Old Man.] as\r\nhe now appears. What in the world are we to do? The 'Times' is working most\r\npatriotically; but why, in the world, did it or he not find out earlier\r\nwhat the G. O. M. really was and is?...\r\n\r\nWith my best regards to Mrs. Reeve,\r\n\r\nI remain, yours very truly,\r\n\r\nEBURY.\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\n_8 janvier_.--Je vous remercie bien sincèrement des bons voeux que vous\r\nm'adressez pour la nouvelle aimée. Comme vous le dites fort bien, il y a\r\ndes bonheurs que la politique ne peut pas empoisonner, et ce sont les plus\r\nsolides.\r\n\r\nL'année 1886, je le crois comme vous, nous réserve des surprises plus\r\ndramatiques que celle don't nous venons de voir la fin. En France, ce\r\nrenouvellement de l'année nous donne un Président renommé mais non rajeuni,\r\nun Ministère reconstitué mais non raffermi ... En Angleterre, Gladstone\r\net les Irlandais vous auront pour une fois rendu service s'ils forcent à\r\ns'unir les conservateurs, aujourd'hui séparés par d'anciennes divisions\r\nen whigs et en tories. Ce jour-la vous pourrez de nonveau avoir un\r\ngouvcrnement fort et national.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Ebury_\r\n\r\n_February 13th_--I cannot recollect anything about Charles Greville's\r\npamphlet on Ireland, though I imagine I must have read it at the time. Can\r\none get it now to look at it? or are things so much changed by the march\r\nof events since that its interest has passed away? I re-read Gustave de\r\nBeaumont's marvellous work, with which no doubt you are acquainted.\r\nI confess it rather staggered me when it first came out; and how the\r\nprophecies it contained are accomplished, almost to the letter! I remember\r\ncalling the old Duke's attention to it; especially to that strange\r\nphrase-speaking of the then Irish landowners--'C'est une mauvaise\r\naristocratic; il faut la détruire.' Was it ever reviewed in the\r\n'Edinburgh'?\r\n\r\nWhen will this horrible Government be overthrown?\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, March 29th_--From what I learned yesterday as to the\r\nprobable course of proceeding in the House of Commons, I am strongly of\r\nopinion that it will be necessary to accelerate the publication of the\r\n'Review' by two days, instead of postponing it, as we had proposed to do.\r\nThe 'Review' would be of use in the debate which will then be going on, and\r\nwill probably be noticed; whereas, after the division on leave to bring in\r\nthe Bill, it would be less opportune. The article on Ireland is complete,\r\nand it would be premature to speculate on the details of an unknown\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe 'Review' was published on April 13th, and, as Reeve had expected, the\r\narticle on 'England's Duty to Ireland' was in everyone's mouth. It was a\r\npowerful appeal to the Liberals, as distinct from the Gladstonians, which\r\nmay even now be read with advantage as a lucid exposition of the principles\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Ebury_\r\n\r\n_April 14th_.--Thank you for so speedily answering my question: also for\r\npointing my attention to the concluding article of the 'Edinburgh'--just\r\npublished--written by yourself. I have just finished its perusal, and am\r\nvery much pleased with it. No doubt you have had a certain advantage\r\nin seeing what has been already said upon this insane proposition of\r\nGladstone's; but I have hitherto seen nothing which so completely exposes\r\nthe dangers that threaten us, and gives so much historical information to\r\nguide opinion upon the subject; and you have put forward a subject which\r\nto my astonishment has not (or scarcely) been noticed at all. I mean\r\nthe danger to the throne of England. I see you dismiss with scarcely a\r\nremark--which, indeed, in your province, would have been injudicious--the\r\nresponsibility of those, our grandees--I won't mention names--who have\r\nassisted in giving the G. O. M. power to do the almost irreparable mischief\r\nhe has perpetrated.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here has:--\r\n\r\n_April 17th_.--To Foxholes. On the 29th, Unionist meeting at Christchurch;\r\nLord Malmesbury in the chair. I read an address [which was printed and\r\ncirculated as a leaflet]. This was one of the first Unionist meetings in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n_May 3rd_.--To Portsmouth, on a visit to Captain Bridge, on board the\r\n'Colossus.'\r\n\r\nOn May 10th Gladstone, in moving the second reading of his 'Home Rule'\r\nBill, seemed to accept the truth of the maxim that 'Speech is given to man\r\nto conceal his thoughts,' and led someone--commonly believed to be Mr.\r\nLabouchere, who made no attempt to hide his own opinions--to say, 'How is\r\nit possible to play with an old sinner who has got an ace up each sleeve,\r\nand says God Almighty put them there?' What Gladstone wanted to do was,\r\nin fact, never exactly known; all that could be made out was that he was\r\nprepared to grant whatever the Irish Nationalist party demanded. It was for\r\nMr. Parnell to speak; for him to obey. Such an attitude was revolting to\r\na very great many of the Liberal party. They maintained--they rightly\r\nmaintained--that the name 'Liberal' belonged to principles, not to men; and\r\nthat those who sacrificed their principles to follow the lead of one man,\r\neven of Gladstone's eminence, ceased to be Liberals, and could only be\r\ncalled Gladstonians. The Bill was discussed for many days, and on June\r\n7th it was negatived by the House of Commons in the fullest division ever\r\nknown; the numbers being:\r\n\r\n  _Against the Bill.          For the Bill._\r\n\r\n  Conservatives. . . .  250  Gladstonians. . . . 230\r\n  Liberals.    . . . . . 93  Nationalists. . . .  83\r\n                        ___                      ___\r\n                        343                      313\r\n\r\n       Majority against the Bill, 30.\r\n\r\nReeve was triumphant, and wrote to Mr. T. Norton Longman the next day,\r\n'What a triumphant division! What a defeat for the G. O. M.! Even he must\r\nbelieve this. I think his colleagues will hardly agree to dissolve. If they\r\ndo, they will be annihilated.'\r\n\r\nThey did, and they were. The General Election held in July fully ratified\r\nthe vote of the House on June 7th, and left the Gladstonians and\r\nParnellites combined in a minority of 115.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_C. O., June 23rd_.--Sir Francis Doyle's Epilogue [Footnote: The last\r\nchapter of Doyle's _Reminiscences and Opinions_ (8vo. 1886). It is\r\nmore than 'invective;' it contains much sound argument and admirable\r\nillustration.] is a powerful piece of invective; but it is essentially\r\naddressed to Gladstone's public career and conduct, and if he likes to\r\npublish it, I see no objection. Doyle was at Eton with Gladstone, and is\r\none of his oldest and most intimate friends--or rather, _was so_. What he\r\nhas written is not stronger than what George Anthony Denison has published\r\non Gladstone, he too being a friend of forty years. I do not remember\r\nanother instance in which a man's best and earliest friends have turned\r\nupon him, to unmask him, and that without any motive of personal\r\nresentment. It is the noble motive which led Brutus to strike Caesar.\r\n\r\nIf this is to appear, it should be published _immediately_, as it relates\r\nto the affairs of the day.\r\n\r\n_C. O., July 21st_.--I think Gladstone has fulfilled all my predictions and\r\ncompleted the ruin of the Liberal party and his own. The net result is that\r\nhe has brought in the Tories for several years.\r\n\r\nWhilst this tremendous storm was raging in the political world in England,\r\nFrance also had been much excited. The letters of the Comte de Paris\r\nhave shown that he was, in point of fact, conducting an intrigue for the\r\nsubversion of the republic, the re-establishment of the monarchy; and it\r\nis not surprising that the Government, more or less cognisant of what was\r\ngoing on, struck in defence of the constitution under which they ruled.\r\nTheir action was said to be illegal; but in time of war the laws depend on,\r\nare upheld by, and interpreted by the greater force; and on June 23rd\r\nthe Comte de Paris, with his family, was ordered to quit France, and the\r\nOrleanist princes, including the Duc d'Aumale, were deprived of their rank\r\nin the army, their names being erased from the army list. On June 29th\r\nReeve noted in his Journal, 'To Tunbridge Wells, to see the Comte de\r\nParis, exiled the week before;' but that is all; the home interest was too\r\nabsorbing, though even of that the only trace in the Journal is on July\r\n5th, 'Unionist meeting at Tuckton. I took the chair. Election.'\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_C. O., July 10th_.--I am much obliged to you for the copy of your\r\nexcellent speech. In this remarkable debate _coram populo_, it seems to me\r\nthat the defeat of the Home Rulers in argument has been even more complete\r\nthan their rout at the polling booths. The people have shown more serious\r\nintelligence than I had given them credit for. I saw this even in our\r\nHampshire bumpkins.\r\n\r\nOn July 20th the Gladstonian Ministry resigned, and before the end of the\r\nmonth the new ministry was formed under Lord Salisbury as premier and first\r\nlord of the treasury. The Journal is occupied with personal and family\r\naffairs of special interest.\r\n\r\n_July 25th_.--To Antwerp by the 'Baron Osy.' Forty-seven Americans on\r\nboard. Aix very dull. Back to London on August 11th.\r\n\r\n_August 18th_.--Letter from Hopie announcing her intended marriage.\r\n\r\n_September 6th_.--Hopie married at Kirklands to Thomas Ogilvie of Chesters.\r\n\r\nChesters is in the immediate neighbourhood of Kirklands, and the friendship\r\nbetween Miss Reeve and Mr. Ogilvie was of many years' standing, though the\r\ndetermination to marry was rather sudden, and the engagement very short.\r\nMr. Ogilvie was a man of good family and property, and though several years\r\nolder than his bride, Reeve appears to have been very well satisfied; his\r\nrelations with his son-in-law were always cordial, though the distance at\r\nwhich they lived restricted the intercourse, and the formed habits of both\r\nprevented anything like intimacy.\r\n\r\nAmidst the political excitement and the family interest of the summer, the\r\nfollowing comes in almost like the Fool in 'King Lear' or Caleb Balderstone\r\nin the 'Bride of Lammermoor.' It refers to a proposition--surely one of the\r\nstrangest ever submitted to a publisher--which, in ordinary course, had\r\nbeen sent to Reeve for an opinion. And this is what Reeve wrote:--\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, August 24th_.--Your correspondent is the coolest fellow I ever\r\nheard of. He not only proposes to complete Macaulay's 'Lays' by some new\r\nones, but to re-edit and correct the original Lays, which, he says, 'are\r\nvery irregular.' His own verses have not a spark of poetry or fire in them;\r\nthey are mere trash, and he is an impertinent fellow.\r\n\r\nHere the Journal has:--\r\n\r\n_September 7th_.--Went to Exeter with Christine; 8th, to Chagford and\r\nDartmoor; 10th, back to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--To Holyhead and Penrhos with Christine. Bad weather at Penrhos;\r\ngout in hand came on.\r\n\r\n_October 2nd_.--To Knowsley; Lord Lyons there.\r\n\r\n_6th_.--To London and Foxholes. Christine went on to Chesters. On the 20th,\r\nMrs. Ogilvie came from Scotland. November 2nd, James Watney died.\r\n\r\n_From Count Vitzthum_\r\n\r\nParis, November 7th.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I beg you to accept kindly a copy of my memoirs 'St.\r\nPetersburg and London,' 1852-1864, which Cotta will send you from the\r\nauthor. Please to remember, if you find time to read these two little\r\nvolumes, that it is a German book, written for Germans, by one who is\r\nneither Whig, nor Tory, nor Red; who is very fond of Old England,, but\r\nhas nothing to do with your party feelings and prejudices. I see men and\r\nthings, not from the English, but from the European standpoint, and leave\r\nit, as far as possible, to the leading men of the day to tell their own\r\ntale. If you find time, read the book and tell me what you think of it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nVITZTHUM.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\nC.O., _November 12th_.--My old friend, Count Vitzthum, formerly Saxon\r\nMinister in London, has sent me his 'Reminiscences of St. Petersburg\r\nand London from 1852 to 1864' in German, 2 vols. This is a book of\r\nextraordinary interest to the English public, full of conversations and\r\nconfidential details of Prince Albert, Lord Palmerston, Lord Clarendon,\r\nDisraeli, &c.--quite a contemporary political history, as amusing and\r\ninteresting as Greville himself. Vitzthum knew this country well, and all\r\nits society.\r\n\r\nI shall write on Monday [15th] to thank him for the book, and I propose to\r\nask him whether he has made any arrangements for the translation of it. I\r\nam not much in favour of translations; but this book is of such peculiar\r\nand exciting interest that I should strongly recommend you to secure it\r\nif possible. I think the Taylors, who did Luther, would undertake the\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\nI think this an important affair.\r\n\r\n_November 15th_.--I am afraid you are out of town, but it is of great\r\nimportance to come to an immediate decision about Count Vitzthum's book. It\r\nis a work of the greatest possible interest and importance, and contains\r\nmany entirely new facts and anecdotes as to contemporary history. You will\r\nperceive this from the enclosed notice of the book which appeared last\r\nweek in the 'Daily News.' [Footnote: November 6th, 'From our Berlin\r\nCorrespondent,' a notice mostly made up of extracts from the book, then\r\ndescribed as 'just about' to be published by Cotta of Stuttgart.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen has seen the sheets and approved them.\r\n\r\nThe result of this notice was that three English publishers at once applied\r\nto Cotta for the right of translation; but the Count has retained that in\r\nhis own hands, and he says that, if _you_ will publish the translation on\r\nsuitable terms, and if _I_ will edit the translation with my name, and\r\nwrite a preface to it, he will make an arrangement with us. This I am ready\r\nto do, and I shall tell him so to-day. There is not a moment to lose; and\r\nas you appear not to be in town, I must act myself in the matter. I want\r\nto know as soon as possible what terms you would offer. I think the Count\r\nwould accept either a sum down or a share of the profits; you might propose\r\neither alternative. The Taylors would execute the translation promptly and\r\nthe book would appear in May. I do not suppose that you will hesitate to\r\nagree to so important a proposal; but if it does not please you, I am\r\ncertain that Murray or Macmillan would jump at it.\r\n\r\n_C.O., November 17th._--Max Müller has written to Count Vitzthum, to make\r\nexactly the same suggestion I have done. He highly applauds the book and\r\nrecommends the Count to make arrangements with _you_ for the translation. I\r\nhave seen Fairfax Taylor. He will undertake to complete the translation by\r\nthe 15th or 20th of February. The printing can go on when he has got some\r\ncopy in hand, and the book can be brought out early in April, which is a\r\nvery good time. I have given him my copy of the first volume to begin upon.\r\nPray get another copy of the book.\r\n\r\n_November 18th._--Count Vitzthum accepts your proposal. He asks me whether\r\nhe should write to you; but that is unnecessary. _Four_ other English\r\npublishers have applied to him for the right of translation.\r\n\r\n_November 23rd._--It will be necessary that the translation of Vitzthum's\r\nbook should be set up in slips, in order that he and I may have an\r\nopportunity of adding notes or making omissions.\r\n\r\nAt this time the question of having him elected as a foreign member of the\r\nInstitute was mooted by Reeve's friends in Paris. It is to this that\r\nthe following letters refer. Though not successful on this occasion,\r\nbecause--as Reeve was afterwards told--two out of the six foreign members\r\nwere already English, they carried their point some eighteen months later,\r\non an English vacancy.\r\n\r\n_From M. Jules Simon_\r\n\r\nParis, 18 décembre.\r\n\r\nCher Monsieur,--J'ai en effet exprimé à notre ami commun, M. Gavard, le\r\ndésir que j'éprouve de vous attacher plus complètement à notre Académie.\r\nC'est line opération assez difficile, car les associés étrangers pouvant\r\nêtre choisis indistinctement dans tous les peuples du monde, il y a\r\nrarement disette de candidats. A chaque vacance, une commission est nominée\r\nau scrutin. Elle présente trois noms à l'Académie, qui consacre une séance\r\nà les discuter, et vote dans la séance suivante. Nous devons élire tout à\r\nl'heure le successeur de Ranke. Parmi les deux noms qui ne sortiront pas de\r\nl'urne, il y en a un qui pourra bien réussir quand on élira le successeur\r\nde Minghetti. En général on est porté deux ou trois fois avant de passer.\r\nVos amis s'occuperont d'abord de vous faire figurer sur la liste. Il faut\r\npour cela qu'un d'entre eux ait la liste exacte de vos écrits, et de tous\r\nles titres que l'on peut invoquer en votre faveur. Les débats ne sont pas\r\npublics; les candidats n'écrivent pas de demande; celui qui les propose\r\nparle en son propre noni, ct est même censé les proposer à leur insu.\r\nEnfin, le public ne connaît que le nom de l'élu. Je crois que vous avez\r\nenvoyé a M. Barthélemy St.-Hilaire les renseignements nécessaires. Si cela\r\nn'est pas fait, faites-le, je vous prie, sans délai. Vous pouvez, si vous\r\nle préférez, les envoyer à M. Gavard, qui me les remettra, ou m'écrire\r\ndirectement. Je vous prie, cher monsieur, de croire à mes sentiments\r\ncordialement dévoués.\r\n\r\nJULES SIMON.\r\n\r\n_From M. Leon Say_\r\n\r\nParis, 25 décembre.\r\n\r\nMon bien Cher M. Reeve,--Je ferai naturellement tous mes efforts pour vous\r\nrapprocher encore plus de l'Institut, et vous y donner un rang digne de\r\nvous; mais je ne dois pas vous laisser ignorer qu'il y aura lutte. Je ne\r\nsais s'il vous conviendra que votre nom soit discuté. Pour vous éclairer\r\nsur ce point, je vous envoie à titre confidentiel un billet que me fait\r\nparvenir M. Aucoc pour faire suite à un entretien que j'ai eu avec lui.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie de croire à mes sentiments les plus distingués et les plus\r\naffectueux.\r\n\r\nLÉON SAY.\r\n\r\nJules Simon m'a promis une note qui me servirait à soutenir vos titres, et\r\nme permettrait de dire aux Français de ma section, passablement ignorants\r\nde l'étranger, avec exactitude ce que vous avez fait.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_December 7th._--Meeting of the Liberal-Unionist party. On the 11th, dinner\r\nat home. Duc d'Aumale, Froude, Carnarvon, Lady Stanley, Colonel Knollys, F.\r\nVilliers, Lady Metcalfe, Newton.\r\n\r\n_19th_--Dined at the Duc d'Aumale's, who had bought Moncorvo House in\r\nEnnismore Gardens. Comte and Comtesse de Paris, Haussonville, Ségur,\r\nTarget, Audiffret, Leighton.\r\n\r\n_December 21st_.--To Timsbury. 24th, to Foxholes. The Ogilvies there.\r\n\r\n1887. _January 3rd_.--Came to London. 10th, dinner at Pender's to meet\r\nStanley, the African traveller, before he went to find Emin Bey.\r\n\r\n_19th_.--The third part of Greville published, 3,007 copies subscribed.\r\n\r\nAmong the many letters which the publication of these last volumes of\r\nthe 'Greville Memoirs' brought him, the following from Sir Arthur Gordon\r\n[Footnote: Fourth son of the Earl of Aberdeen.]--now Lord Stanmore,\r\nand then Governor of Ceylon--have a peculiar interest from their exact\r\ncriticism of a point of detail with which the writer was personally\r\nacquainted at first hand:--\r\n\r\nQueen's House, Colombo, June 18th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I have very long delayed answering your last letter, in\r\nthe hope that, when I did so, I might at the same time be able to send you\r\nmy notes on the two last volumes of 'Greville.' But these notes will\r\nbe numerous, and my time is scant for such work. On one point, the\r\n'graspingness' alleged to have been shown by the Peclites after the\r\nformation of the Government in December 1852, and its modification to\r\nsatisfy their exigencies, I have felt constrained to address the 'Times.'\r\n[Footnote: June 13th. The letter is reprinted in the Appenduxm _post_, p.\r\n411.] The truth happens to have been exactly the other way, and Greville's\r\nnotes are only the echo of the grumblings of the disappointed Whig placemen\r\nwho talked to him. It is decidedly unjust not only to my father, Graham,\r\nand Gladstone, who are indirectly charged with this trafficking, but to the\r\nDuke of Newcastle and Herbert also, who more directly are so.\r\n\r\nI have, of course, read the volumes with great interest, but have had\r\nmy suspicions greatly heightened that whatever may have been the case\r\nbefore--say 1841, the confidences Mr. Greville received in the later years\r\nof his life were not unfrequently only half-confidences, for the sake\r\nof obtaining his opinion on some collateral point, or of flattering or\r\npleasing him by the show of confidence. There are, of course, many matters\r\ntreated of in these volumes as to which I have no personal or private\r\ninformation, and I have no reason to question what he says about them; but\r\nI have some inclination to doubt, even as to these; for I find that as\r\nregards almost every transaction of which I do happen to know the whole\r\nhistory, he knows a good deal about it, but not _all_ about it. He was\r\nkept specially in the dark about the real history of Lord Palmerston's\r\nresignation in 1853 which is all the odder because he very nearly found it\r\nout. Hardly anybody does know what lay behind, though the difference about\r\nReform was a very real one, so far as it went, and quite sufficient to\r\njustify--at all events, ostensibly--Lord P.'s virtual dismissal. Again, on\r\nanother occasion, I see Mr. G.'s special friend, Lord Clarendon--I will\r\nnot say, deliberately deceived him, but, certainly with full knowledge\r\n--allowed him to deceive himself on the strength of a half-confidence.\r\n[Footnote: A politic reticence, that has been called 'an economy of\r\ntruth.']\r\n\r\nI am more disappointed than I can say to find that M. de Sainte-Aulaire's\r\nelaborate Memoirs have been 'used up' for that stupid book of Victor de\r\nNouvion's, [Footnote: Histoire du Règne de Louis Philippe (4 tom 8vo.\r\n1857-61)], if--as I suppose-that is the book you refer to. I thought it had\r\nnever got beyond the first two volumes, and have never seen any more of it.\r\nI am vexed that M. de Sainte-Aulaire's elaborate Memoirs should have been\r\nutilised for such a book; generally, because I know M. de Sainte-Aulaire\r\ncontemplated their publication, and because they deserved to appear in\r\na separate form; and, personally and specially, because, of course, his\r\naccounts of his intercourse with my father, and the elaborate study of his\r\ncharacter which he had written, are thus lost....\r\n\r\nYours ever faithfully,\r\n\r\nA. GORDON.\r\n\r\n_To Sir Arthur Gordon_\r\n\r\n_C.O., June 13th_.--I have just read in the 'Times' of this morning your\r\ninteresting letter on the formation of Lord Aberdeen's ministry. I have no\r\ndoubt you are quite right. It _was_ John Russell and the Whigs who were\r\nrapacious for office--much more than the Peelites. John Russell, I know,\r\nkept Cardwell out of the Cabinet. You observe that Greville only notes what\r\nLord Clarendon told him; and I have no doubt that Clarendon was rather out\r\nof humour with arrangements which were personally disagreeable to himself.\r\nBut that again was John Russell's fault, because he insisted on taking the\r\nForeign Office _pro tem_. I shall probably publish another complete edition\r\nof Greville next year, and I think it would be well to insert in a note the\r\nwhole of your letter, or at least the greater part of it. [Footnote: See\r\nAppendix, post, p. 411.] If you have any other criticisms to make, they\r\nwould be valuable to me. I have availed myself of those you were so good as\r\nto send me on the second series.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that Mme. de Jarnac is dead. I do not know who has her\r\nhusband's papers; but the Comte de Paris is here, and as I frequently see\r\nhim, I will take an early opportunity of asking him whether he can give me\r\nany information about Lord Aberdeen's letters. M. Thureau's 'Histoire de\r\nla Monarchic de Juillet' is a remarkable book, because he has access to\r\noriginal sources and quotes largely from them, especially from the Memoirs\r\nof M. de Sainte-Aulaire which are still in MS. [Footnote: And _still_ so in\r\n1898.] They appear to be extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nWe are getting on here pretty well. If the Whigs had joined the Government,\r\nthere might have been a scramble for office, as there was in 1853; for\r\nthe Whigs are now in the same position as the Peelites were at that\r\ntime--officers without an army. It is much more to the credit of my friends\r\nto give a disinterested support to Lord Salisbury; and this alliance gives\r\na sufficiently Liberal colour to the measures of the administration. There\r\nis every appearance that the Unionists will hold together. Mr. Gladstone\r\ncontinues to be in a state of hallucination and excitement which exceeds\r\nbelief. It is a case of moral and political suicide. The crisis will\r\nprobably end by the death of Mr. Parnell, the falling [off] of the American\r\nsubscriptions, and the extinction of Mr. Gladstone; but in the meantime\r\nthey have totally ruined Ireland.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Arthur Gordon_\r\n\r\n_August 30th_.--Your letter of June 13th must have crossed one from me,\r\nin which I explained to you why I had written to the 'Times' about\r\nthe formation of the Government of 1853 instead of merely sending my\r\nobservations to you as a note for future use. I need not say that I am much\r\nflattered by your proposal to insert the letter--or part of it--in a note\r\nto a future edition of Mr. Greville's Memoirs... I am struck very much\r\nby what I think I mentioned once before--the frequency with which Mr.\r\nGreville's friends gave him what may be called 'a three-quarters knowledge'\r\nof pending affairs. They told him a great deal, but frequently not _all_.\r\nIn the affairs with which I am really acquainted, there is almost always\r\nsomething--and that an important something--which does not appear in his\r\nnotes... I have specially noticed this with regard to Lord Palmerston's\r\n'resignation' in 1853, It is the more remarkable, because it is apparent\r\nfrom various passages that he 'burnt'--as they say in a game of hide and\r\nseek--but never actually quite caught the true facts. I have never known\r\na secret better guarded than the fact--which, after a lapse of four and\r\nthirty years, one may, I think, mention--that Lord P.'s resignation on\r\nthat occasion was _not_ voluntary, and that he was, in fact, extruded.\r\n[Footnote: In a later letter, June 5th, 1888, Sir Arthur Gordon wrote:--'He\r\nhad given great offence to the Queen; and his colleagues--at least, his\r\nmost important colleagues--distrusted his action in reference to pending\r\nnegotiations, Lord Clarendon especially resenting the intrigues he believed\r\nhe was carrying on. Things being in this state, he announced his hostility\r\nto Reform, and it was determined to take advantage of this announcement to\r\nremove him; and removed he would have been, but for the two causes I have\r\nnoted.'] But, to be sure, half the Cabinet did not know this; and it was\r\ntheir ignorance, coupled with Newcastle's and Gladstone's dislike of Lord\r\nJohn, that brought him back again.\r\n\r\nI must get M. Thureau's 'Histoire de la Monarchic de Juillet,' of which I\r\nnever even heard. It is dreadful to reflect how utterly behindhand one gets\r\nin all things, literary, artistic, and political, through long sojourns out\r\nof Europe. But I do hope there is some prospect of M. de Sainte-Aulaire's\r\nMemoirs themselves being published at full length. I know it was M. de\r\nSainte-Aulaire's wish and deliberate intention that they should be given to\r\nthe world, and he took much trouble with them.\r\n\r\n_From the Duke of Argyll_\r\n\r\nInveraray, January 22nd.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I have been longer in getting the book off my hands\r\nthan I had hoped. It is now in the press, and Douglas talks of getting it\r\nout about February 10th or a little later.... There is a good deal in\r\nthe book which, in one sense, may be called 'padding,' because I have\r\nendeavoured to relieve the very dry subject of Tenures and Agricultural\r\nImprovement with historical episodes, with pictures of manners, and even\r\nwith personal anecdote. But I think there is a considerable bulk of new\r\nmatter, or at least of old matter put in new points of view, and every part\r\nis written with an aim to establish the principles which _we_ think 'sound'\r\non Law, on Property, and on Union. Your new Greville seems to be very\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nARGYLL.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris_, 29 _janvier_.--Je vous remercie de la peine que vous voulez\r\nbien prendre, et j'ai profité des corrections que vous avez bien\r\nvoulu m'indiquer. J'avais déjá profité des deux articles de la 'Revue\r\nd'Edimbourg' sur les chemins de fer russes en Asie et sur l'armée indienne.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to appear more royalist than the king himself; but I cannot\r\nfeel so sure as you do about the security of India. The Russians are\r\nalready threatening it, and I do not think they are near stopping. The base\r\nof their operations will be in the Caucasus, where they already have very\r\nconsiderable forces. It is true that their finances are in bad order; but\r\nthis may perhaps be an additional motive to them to undertake a war of\r\nconquest. I agree with you, however, that before the attack on India will\r\ncome the attack on Constantinople, the consequences of which will be very\r\ngreat. On the other hand, the railway connecting Candahar with the Indus\r\nwill certainly be a great obstacle to the advance of the Russians on Cabul.\r\nIn all this I see many of the elements of catastrophes which the next\r\ngeneration will witness. I hope I may be out of this world before they\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes_, _April 17th_.--I see the 'Athenaeum' complains that I did not\r\ncorrect all Vitzthum's mistakes and rearrange his book; but that is more\r\nthan I undertook to do. We did correct a good many mistakes, natural enough\r\nin a foreigner; but I do not hold myself responsible for his facts or his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n_April 22nd_.--I know more about M. Barthélemy St.-Hilaire's book on India\r\nthan any other Englishman, for I revised and corrected the proof-sheets for\r\nhim. A French writer on the subject was sure to make blunders. The book is\r\nmost valuable to _foreigners_, for it is a perfectly fair account of the\r\nBritish administration of India; but it would be entirely useless in this\r\ncountry, inasmuch as it is a mere compilation from well-known English\r\ndocuments. I think, therefore, that a translation into English would be a\r\nwork of supererogation and a failure.\r\n\r\n_Journal_\r\n\r\n_April 30th_.--Dined at the Royal Academy dinner.\r\n\r\n_May 9th_.--Great Unionist meeting at Winchester.\r\n\r\n_28th_.--Barthélemy St.-Hilaire came to Foxholes on a visit.\r\n\r\n_June 10th_.--Dined with the Duc d'Aumale, Moncorvo House.

'Colossus,' Gibraltar, August 3rd.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--The Naval Review and the ensuing operations have not, I\r\nhope, given you such a surfeit of naval affairs as to indispose you to hear\r\na little of the recent cruise of the Mediterranean squadron. We left Malta,\r\nunder the command of the Duke of Edinburgh, in May, and visited several\r\nports on the coast of Italy. During H.R.H.'s absence in England, when\r\nattending the Jubilee, we stayed at the convenient harbour of Aranci Bay\r\nin the island of Sardinia. There we carried out a series of instructive\r\ntorpedo and under-water mining exercises. After leaving Sardinia, we\r\ncalled at several Spanish ports--Barcelona, Valencia, Cartagena and\r\nMalaga--eventually reaching this place last Friday evening.\r\n\r\nThe effect of our visits to both Italy and Spain has been--especially in\r\nthe case of the latter country--remarkably gratifying. The presence of\r\na son of the Queen was evidently taken as a compliment by Italians and\r\nSpaniards of all classes. Barcelona, Cartagena, and Malaga are notoriously\r\nanti-monarchical in sentiment. Yet in every one H.R.H. had a most\r\nflattering reception. The enthusiasm of the populace at Cartagena was fully\r\nequal to any shown by an English crowd for any popular royal personage.\r\nPeople may say what they like, but the advantages to the country of\r\nhaving a prince in the position held by the Duke are considerable. The\r\nfriendliness of the Italians is striking; and I am confident the feelings\r\nof Spaniards of all classes are more favourable to England than they have\r\nbeen for half a century. We hear now that we are to go on to Cadiz, where a\r\nmaritime exhibition is to be opened this month; and it is understood that\r\nthis extension of our cruise is at the request of the Spaniards themselves.\r\nI have visited Spanish ports often before now, and never noticed any\r\nfriendliness towards us. Should the necessity of looking for allies arise,\r\nit is nearly certain that both Italy and Spain would be disposed to range\r\nthemselves on our side. It will be a pity if diplomatic bungling occurs to\r\nalter this satisfactory condition of things....\r\n\r\nPray give my kind remembrances to Mrs. Reeve.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCYPRIAN A. G. BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that for some years back Reeve had been occasionally\r\nthinking of retiring from his post of Registrar. The near completion of\r\nfifty years' service revived the notion, and his illness at Wiesbaden,\r\nfollowing an earlier attack in April, confirmed it. When his mind was once\r\nmade up, the rest was a matter of detail. The Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_August 10th_.--Taxed costs and wound up business at the Council Office for\r\nthe last time again; but went there again on October 11th.\r\n\r\n_12th_.--To Foxholes, where fever and bad fit of gout came on; I was very\r\nunwell till September 3rd.\r\n\r\n_21st_.--My dog Sylvia [Footnote: A collie, so called after her donor, M.\r\nSylvain van de Weyer. A brother of hers belonged to the Queen.] died. A\r\nfond and faithful companion of sixteen years.\r\n\r\n_September 5th_.--Mr. G. H. Dorrell came as my secretary, and I dictated an\r\narticle on foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. C. L. Peel_ [Footnote: Clerk of the Council in succession to Sir\r\nArthur Helps. Now Sir Charles Peel.]\r\n\r\n56 Eccleston Square, October 5th.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Reeve,--I was so taken aback by your announcement to-day, that I\r\nreally could not find words in which to express the sincere regret with\r\nwhich I heard it. You are so thoroughly identified in my mind with the\r\nCouncil Office, and I am so much indebted to you for advice and assistance\r\nduring the last twelve years, that I shall feel quite lost when I can\r\nno longer rely upon the experience, judgement, and kindness which have\r\nhitherto been available to me in any difficulty.\r\n\r\nI only trust that by relieving yourself in good time from the ties of\r\noffice, you may enjoy a long spell of happy and active retirement, which\r\nyou have so well earned, and into which you will be followed by the best\r\nwishes of all you leave behind. Believe me always,\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. L. PEEL.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the Journal that the resignation was not officially made\r\ntill some days later.\r\n\r\n_October 24th_.--I resigned the Registrarship of the Privy Council, which I\r\nhad held, as Clerk of Appeals and Registrar, since November 17th, 1837. The\r\nrest of the year at Foxholes.\r\n\r\nAt the sitting of the Judicial Committee on November 2nd, Sir Barnes\r\nPeacock formally announced to the Bar the resignation of the Registrar, and\r\nafter briefly mentioning the dates of his service as Clerk of Appeals since\r\n1837 and Registrar since the creation of the office in 1853, he went on:--\r\n\r\n'It is unnecessary to state to the Bar the manner in which the duties of\r\nthat office have been performed by Mr. Reeve. He is not present to-day. He\r\nhas been prevented, I believe, by the state of his health, from travelling\r\nto London. Their Lordships are sorry that he is not present, that they\r\nmight personally bid him farewell. They have given me, as the oldest member\r\nof the Judicial Committee now present, the privilege of expressing and\r\nrecording their deep sense of the loss which must be sustained, both by\r\nthe Judicial Committee and the public, by being deprived of the valuable\r\nservices of Mr. Henry Reeve. His long and varied experience, extending over\r\na period of nearly half a century, his extensive knowledge, his great tact\r\nand the sound judgement which he brought to bear in the discharge of the\r\nduties of his office, render his retirement a serious loss both to the\r\nJudicial Committee and to the public. Their Lordships could not allow Mr.\r\nReeve to depart from his office in silence. They trust that he may long\r\nenjoy in health and happiness that rest, relaxation, and repose which\r\nhe has so fully and meritoriously earned, and to which he is so justly\r\nentitled. Many men retire from an arduous profession or office, and when\r\nthey are relieved from the duties which they have for many years been\r\ncalled upon to discharge, sink into a state of _ennui_ and listlessness\r\nwhich are not conducive either to a long life or to health or happiness.\r\nBut their Lordships feel sure that that will not be the case with Mr.\r\nHenry Reeve. His literary and other congenial tastes and pursuits, and his\r\nindustrious habits, will no doubt supply him with full employment for his\r\nstill active and vigorous mind. In taking their leave of Mr. Henry Reeve\r\non his departure from office their Lordships will only add, 'Let honour be\r\nwhere honour is justly deserved.'\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Aston, Q.C., replied, as the oldest member of the Bar\r\npresent:--\r\n\r\n'I refrain from attempting to add anything to what your Lordship has said,\r\nfor fear that the feebleness of my addition might detract from the force\r\nof that which your Lordship has expressed. But I cannot help saying that,\r\nafter having appeared at your Lordships' Bar in this place for upwards of\r\na quarter of a century, I have myself personally received, and I have seen\r\nthe members of the Bar who have practised with me always receive, from Mr.\r\nReeve the utmost courtesy, attention, and assistance. We often have, my\r\nLords, in practising before you, a difficult task to discharge. Our clients\r\nare not familiar with the practice of your Lordships' Court, if I may use\r\nthe term. But on all occasions Mr. Registrar Reeve has given the utmost\r\nassistance, and therefore I beg to say, on behalf of the Bar whom I venture\r\nto represent, that we cordially endorse all that your Lordship has said,\r\nand express our unfeigned regret that we shall no longer have the services\r\nof Mr. Reeve in your Lordships' chamber.'\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, November 4th._--I hope you saw the funeral oration Sir Barnes\r\nPeacock pronounced on me in the Privy Council. It is in the outer sheet of\r\nthe 'Times' of Tuesday [Nov. 1st], and perhaps in some other papers; a very\r\nkind and handsome tribute; and it is pleasanter to have these things said\r\nwhen one is alive than when one is dead.\r\n\r\nThe notice in the 'Times' brought Reeve many letters from his friends;\r\namongst others, the following:--\r\n\r\n_From Lord Ebury_\r\n\r\n_November 9th._--I see you are going to desert the Council altogether. I\r\nhope you will long enjoy the _otium_ which you have so worthily merited,\r\nand will have time to assist in extinguishing Gladstone.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Woodnorton, 15 novembre._--Je regrette d'apprendre que votre santé a été\r\nsi eprouvée.... Je suis toujours affligée de voir mes amis se retirer de\r\nla vie active; mais je comprends les motifs qui vous ont dicté votre\r\ndemission....\r\n\r\nJe suis si honteux de ce qui se passe en France que je n'ose pas vous en\r\nparler, et je me borne a vous serrer bien cordialement la main.\r\n\r\nThe Journal then notes:--\r\n\r\n1888.--The year began at Foxholes. The Ogilvies there for three weeks. Came\r\nto London on January 3rd.\r\n\r\n_February 4th._--Sir Henry Maine died at Cannes. A great loss.\r\n\r\n_March 5th._--The railroad from Brockenhurst to Christchurch opened. Went\r\ndown to the ceremony. Came back at 7 and dined with Millais to meet the\r\nLord Chancellor. Mrs. Procter died.\r\n\r\n_9th_--Emperor William of Germany died. Various dinners.\r\n\r\n_April 10th._--Gladstone dined at The Club. Froude, Smith, Hewett, and\r\nHooker there.\r\n\r\n_27th_--Left London for Basle with Christine at 11 A.M. and arrived there,\r\nand thence, at Lucerne, on the 28th at 9 A.M. Capital journey.\r\n\r\nFrom Lucerne they went on to Milan and Bologna and to Florence, which they\r\nreached on May 3rd, which they made their headquarters for the next three\r\nweeks, seeing all that was interesting in the city and the neighbourhood,\r\nand visiting Siena, Chiusi, Perugia, and Assisi. Then to Spezia, Turin,\r\nGeneva, and to Paris on the 24th.\r\n\r\nMeantime Reeve, having been proposed by St.-Hilaire, supported by the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, Jules Simon, and Duruy, as a foreign member of the Institut de\r\nFrance, in succession to Sir Henry Maine, had been elected by a large\r\nmajority on May 8th. He seems to have received the first news of this from\r\nthe Duc d'Aumale, who wrote from Palermo on May 10th:--\r\n\r\nMon ancien maître, confrère et ami, Duruy, m'ecrit que vous venez d'etre\r\nnommé associé étranger de son Académie par vingt-sept voix. C'est un beau\r\nsuccès dont je veux tout de suite me réjouir avec vous, en attendant que je\r\npuisse le faire de vive voix. Je compte être le 20 de ce mois à Bruxelles,\r\net dîner avec le Club quelque jour du mois de juin.\r\n\r\nThe election had to be approved by the President of the Republic, and the\r\nresult was not officially communicated till the 19th. It would seem that\r\nReeve did not receive it till his arrival in Paris, and on the next day,\r\nMay 25th, St.-Hilaire wrote:--\r\n\r\nDemain je vous accompagnerai pour votre entrée à l'Académie. Vous verrez\r\nque le cérémonial est des plus simples. Je vous présenterai spécialement à\r\nM. Franck, qui, sur ma demande, a été votre rapporteur, et qui a parlé de\r\nvous en termes excellents.\r\n\r\nFrom the Duc d'Aumale he received, a few days later:--\r\n\r\n_Bruxelles, 31 mai._--Je ne doutais pas du bon accueil qui vous serait fait\r\nà l'Institut, et je suis ravi d'en recevoir le témoignage par votre lettre.\r\nJe voudrais bien pouvoir assister au dîner du Club du 12 juin; mais j'en\r\nai quelque doute, tandis que je crois être certain, _Deo adjuvante_, de\r\npouvoir m'asseoir à notre table fraternelle le mardi 26. Je vous serre\r\naffectueusement la main.\r\n\r\nOn May 28th Reeve returned to London. The entries in the Journal are of\r\nlittle interest, but he noted:--\r\n\r\n_June 12th._--At Lady Knutsford's, evening, met Lord and Lady Lansdowne,\r\njust back from Canada.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--To Foxholes. The Emperor Fritz of Germany died. During the whole\r\nof his short reign, which lasted ninety-nine days, the most bitter quarrels\r\nwent on about his medical treatment. It was a great tragedy.\r\n\r\n_25th_.--To London again. 26th, breakfasted with the Duc d'Aumale, who\r\ndined at The Club.\r\n\r\n_July 2nd._--To Winchester Quarter Sessions to qualify as J.P. for\r\nHampshire, having been recently appointed by Lord Carnarvon.\r\n\r\n_9th_.--Attended Petty Sessions at Christchurch.\r\n\r\n_30th_.--Winchester Assizes. On the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nThe next letter, from Sir Arthur Gordon, refers to an incident alluded to\r\nin the 'Greville Memoirs,' [Footnote: Third Part, i. 54-5.] which Reeve\r\nhad commented on at some length, with a reference to the Memoirs of Lord\r\nMalmesbury, published some four years before.\r\n\r\nWhat Lord Malmesbury had said amounted to this--that in 1844, when the\r\nRussian Emperor Nicholas was in London, 'he, Sir Robert Peel (then prime\r\nminister) and Lord Aberdeen (then foreign secretary) drew up and _signed_\r\na memorandum' to the effect that England 'would support Russia in her\r\nlegitimate protectorship of the Greek religion and the Holy Shrines,\r\nwithout consulting France. Lord Malmesbury added that the fact of Lord\r\nAberdeen, one of the signers of this paper, being prime minister in 1853,\r\nwas taken by Nicholas as a ground for believing that England would not\r\njoin France to restrain the pretensions of Russia, and therefore, by\r\nimplication, that Lord Aberdeen's being prime minister was a--if not\r\nthe--principal cause of the war. [Footnote: _Lord Malmesbury's Memoirs of\r\nan Ex-Minister_ (1st edit.), i. 402-3.]\r\n\r\nThe memorandum itself, as printed in the Blue Book, differs essentially,\r\nboth in matter and form, from Lord Malmesbury's description of it. It\r\nis entitled 'Memorandum by Count Nesselrode delivered to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment and founded on communications received from the Emperor of\r\nRussia subsequently to His Imperial Majesty's visit to England in June\r\n1844.' [Footnote: _Parliamentary Papers_, 1854, lxxi. 863.] It is unsigned,\r\nand from the nature of it must be so; it is in no sense an agreement, but\r\na proposal that England should agree to act in concert with Russia and\r\nAustria; and nothing whatever is said about the Greek religion, the\r\nHoly Places, or the Russian protectorate. It is of course possible that\r\nconversations between Nicholas and Lord Aberdeen, which preceded the\r\ndrawing up of this memorandum, may have encouraged the one and hampered\r\nthe other; but of this there is no evidence, and Lord Malmesbury could\r\nnot possibly know anything about it, though he did know something--very\r\ninaccurately it appears--about the memorandum. The discrepancies had,\r\nin fact, led Reeve to suppose that Malmesbury's statement must refer\r\nto another memorandum; and thus Lord Stanmore's letter has a singular\r\nhistorical interest, bearing, as it does, on a point that has been much\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Arthur Gordon_\r\n\r\n_Queen's House, Colombo, July 30th_--I am very sorry that I did not\r\ncontrive to meet you while in England.... I am almost equally sorry--in\r\nfact, am equally sorry--that my laziness and procrastination in sending you\r\nmy notes prevented their being of any use in the revision of the seventh\r\nvolume [of the Greville Memoirs]. I am the more sorry because I confess\r\nI greatly regret that the mare's-nest of the Russian Memorandum of 1844\r\nshould remain unpulled to pieces. You seem half-incredulous as to my\r\nexplanation, and ask very naturally, If that is all, why should there have\r\nbeen any secrecy about it? The secrecy was due to the form, not the matter.\r\nThe memorandum was the Emperor's own account of his conversations with\r\nthe Duke, Sir R. Peel, and Lord Aberdeen, and a copy of it was sent in a\r\nprivate letter from Count Nesselrode to Lord Aberdeen. It was never in the\r\nhands of the ordinary diplomatic agents for official communication to the\r\nEnglish Government, nor was it ever treated as an official document. But\r\nits importance was too great to allow its being treated as an ordinary\r\nprivate letter, and my father personally handed it to Lord Palmerston when\r\nreplaced at the F. O. by him. Lord Palmerston delivered it in the same way\r\nto Lord Granville, Lord Granville to Lord Malmesbury, Lord Malmesbury to\r\nLord John Russell, and Lord John to Lord Clarendon. In 1853 the Emperor\r\nmade some reference to this paper which was supposed to make it a public\r\ndocument, and it was then printed and laid before Parliament soon after the\r\nbeginning of the war. This I assure you is the whole history and mystery\r\nof the Russian Memorandum, Lord M. notwithstanding. This is not the only\r\ninstance in which Lord M. has mixed up, in singular fashion, what he\r\nhimself knew and what was the club gossip at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Journal here notes:--\r\n\r\n_August 20th._--Drove over to Lytchet Heath, to stay with the Eustace\r\nCecils.\r\n\r\n_September 10th._--Joined Mrs. Watney in the 'Palatine' yacht at\r\nBournemouth. Crossed to Trouville in the night. Lay in 'the ditch' for\r\ntwenty hours. 12th, Cherbourg. Met the French fleet and saw the arsenal.\r\n13th, back to Southampton and to Foxholes. Pleasant trip; good weather.\r\n\r\n_20th_--The Eustace Cecils came: took them to Heron Court. This was the\r\nlast time Lord Malmesbury saw people there.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\nWoodnorton, 26 septembre.\r\n\r\nTrès cher ami,--Vous êtes bien heureux de pouvoir aller vous promener à\r\nCherbourg et à Paris. Enfin!\r\n\r\nOui, j'ai reçu un peu de plomb, et même assez près de l'oeil gauche; mais\r\nle proverbe dit que ce métal est ami de l'homme. J'en serai quitte pour\r\nquelques petites bosses sous la peau, et je vous souhaite de vous porter\r\naussi bien que je le fais en ce moment.\r\n\r\nJ'irai à Knowsley dans la seconde quinzaine d'octobre; à Sandringham,\r\ndans les premiers jours de novembre; puis mes neveux viendront tirer mes\r\nfaisans. J'espère bien prendre part aux agapes du Club le 27 novembre et 11\r\ndécembre, et serai bien heureux de vous revoir un peu. En attendant je vous\r\nserre la main, mon cher confrère.\r\n\r\nH. D'ORLÉANS.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 2nd._--I am amused by the Court quarrel in Germany,\r\nthough I am afraid the broken heads will not be royal heads. Bismarck will\r\nwreak his vengeance on numberless victims. Geffcken is a very old friend\r\nof mine, and an occasional contributor to the 'Edinburgh Review;' but I am\r\nafraid it will go hard with him, for Bismarck regards him as a personal\r\nenemy. If the Prince had lived Bismarck could not have remained in office,\r\nand the course of affairs might have been materially changed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn October 25th Reeve, with his wife, crossed over to Paris. He attended\r\nthe Institut on the 26th, and heard mass at Notre Dame on the 27th; but his\r\nprincipal object seems to have been to consult Dr. Perrin about his eyes,\r\nwhich for some time back had caused him some uneasiness. A literary man of\r\nseventy-five is naturally quick to take alarm, and an English oculist had\r\nrecommended an operation. This Reeve was unwilling to undergo, at any\r\nrate without another and entirely independent opinion; and as Dr. Perrin\r\npronounced strongly against it, no operation was performed; and with care\r\nand good glasses his eyes continued serviceable to the last. On November\r\n8th the Reeves returned to London, where, as Parliament was sitting, they\r\nremained till Christmas; and, according to the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_November 27th._--The Club was brilliant with the Duc d'Aumale, Wolseley,\r\nLord Derby, and Coleridge. Boehm and Maunde Thompson were elected.\r\n\r\n_December 1st_.--To All Souls, Oxford. Prothero, Dicey, Oman, George\r\nCurzon, &c. Stayed over Sunday.\r\n\r\n_27th_.--To Timsbury: thence to Foxholes on the 29th.\r\n\r\n_January 15th_, 1889.--Returned to London.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 20th_.--It was very good of you to think of my book on\r\n'L'Inde Anglaise,' and I thank you for the 'Edinburgh Review' which you\r\nhave sent me. I read the article with great interest. It is very well done,\r\nand I beg you to thank the author in my name for having taken the trouble\r\nto read me with so much attention and good will. I do not think I have\r\nexaggerated the danger which threatens your great enterprise in India. The\r\nTranscaspian Railway, which will very soon run from Samarkand to Tashkend,\r\nseems to me one source of it. Yours will, indeed, soon reach to Candahar;\r\nbut Russia is at home in the country, whilst England is very far off.\r\nThe magnanimous confidence you have in your own strength is most\r\npraiseworthy--provided that your watchfulness is not allowed to slumber....\r\nMeanwhile I remain constant in my admiration of what the English are doing\r\nin India; and the administration of Lord Dufferin may well confirm me in my\r\nopinion. There is nothing like it, or so great as it, in the history of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Dufferin_\r\n\r\nBritish Embassy, Rome, January 27th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--Many thanks for your letter of the 16th. As you may well\r\nsuppose, I am delighted with Lyall's article; for he is acknowledged, both\r\nby Indian and by so much of English public opinion as knows anything of\r\nthe matter, to have been the best Indian public servant that the present\r\ngeneration has produced. In addition, or, as perhaps some would say, in\r\nspite of possessing real literary genius, he proved himself a most wise,\r\nshrewd, and capable administrator. I do not believe he made a single\r\nmistake during his whole career. At all events, I never heard of his having\r\ndone so; and a slip is scarcely made in India without the fact being duly\r\nrecorded. What pleases me most is that the kind words he uses about myself\r\nshould be embedded in the exposition of his own opinions upon Indian\r\nquestions--opinions full of acuteness, justice, and knowledge. It is\r\nthese that will really make the article interesting to your readers, and\r\nconsequently give a greater importance to what he has said about me than\r\notherwise would have been the case. I have obeyed your orders in regard to\r\nsending a copy of my speech to M. Barthelemy St.-Hilaire.\r\n\r\nThe social history of the season is adequately chronicled in the Journal:--\r\n\r\n_February 5th_.--The Ogilvies in London.\r\n\r\n_22nd_.--Mr. Gollop [Mrs. Reeve's father] died; born October 11th, 1791.\r\nChristine had been down just before.\r\n\r\n_March 12th_.--The Club. Good party: Lord Salisbury, Walpole, Tyndall,\r\nHooker, Hewett, Lecky, Lyall, A. Russell, Layard, and self.\r\n\r\n_March 20th_.--Meeting at Lord Carnarvon's about the bust of Sir C. Newton.\r\n\r\n_25th_.--Breakfast at Sheen House with Comte and Comtesse de Paris, to meet\r\nLefèvre-Pontalis and Bocher.\r\n\r\n_28th_.--Lunched with Major Dawson at Woolwich and went over the Arsenal.\r\nVery interesting.\r\n\r\n_April 12th_.--Meeting for Matthew Arnold's Memorial. 7,000 _l_. raised.\r\n\r\n_May 4th_.--Dined at the Royal Academy dinner. Sat by Horsley, Tyndall, and\r\nChitty.\r\n\r\n_From Sir Arthur Gordon_\r\n\r\n_May 5th_.--You may rely upon it that I am absolutely right as to the\r\nRussian Memorandum--Lord Malmesbury does not himself assert that he ever\r\nsaw it, which, had it existed, he must have done when Foreign Secretary. I\r\ncannot, of course, expect you to attach the same weight that I do to what\r\nI may call the personal reasons which make me utterly incredulous of Lord\r\nMalmesbury's story; but there are other reasons for doubting it, some of\r\nwhich may have already occurred to you. One is the alleged form of the\r\ndocument, which is said to be signed by the Emperor, the Duke, my father,\r\nand Sir R. Peel. Lord Malmesbury prides himself on the knowledge of\r\ndiplomatic forms and etiquettes derived from his grandfather's papers. He\r\nmight have known that the signature of an engagement by a Sovereign (and\r\nsuch a Sovereign!) on the one side and _three ministers_ of another\r\nSovereign on the other (thereby putting them on species of equality) was\r\nan impossibility. Such a paper, if it existed, would be signed either by\r\n_both_ Sovereigns or by the ministers of both. I think I may say with\r\nconfidence that the Emperor Nicholas was a most unlikely man to perform\r\nsuch an act of condescension. And why should he? He had his confidential\r\nminister with him. Another, and I think fatal, objection is that neither\r\nmy father nor Lord Clarendon were altogether absolute fools, and when, in\r\nanswer to the Emperor's challenge, they published the secret memorandum\r\nwhich had till then been handed on privately from minister to minister,\r\nthey knew what they were about, and would never have put it into the power\r\nof the Emperor to retort that _that_ was not what he referred to, but to a\r\npaper which would not improve the cordiality of the Anglo-French alliance.\r\nAgain, is it likely that, if the Emperor had entered into such an\r\nagreement, he would take the trouble to write another long memorandum,\r\ncontaining the 'substance' of his discussions with the English ministers?\r\nThis is the memorandum which was sent in a private letter, which I possess,\r\nfrom Count Nesselrode to my father; which was handed from minister to\r\nminister, and which was published in 1854. The original draft, Count\r\nNesselrode said, was in the Emperor's own hand. I have another little bit\r\nof evidence which I think also goes to prove that no such agreement was\r\nentered into in 1844, as Lord Malmesbury supposes. In 1845 Count Nesselrode\r\nvisited England. My father, writing to the Queen, gives an account of his\r\nconversations with Nesselrode, and says: 'His language very much resembled\r\nthat held by the Emperor; and _although he made no specific proposals_, his\r\ndeclarations of support, in case of necessity, were _more_ unequivocal.'\r\n(The italics are mine.) Could he have written this if he had already,\r\nsome months before, signed an agreement with the Emperor, which was both\r\nunequivocal and specific?\r\n\r\n_From the Comte de Paris_\r\n\r\nSheen House, 7 mai.\r\n\r\nMon cher Monsieur Reeve ,--Nous aussi, nous n'avons pas oublié votre\r\nprésence à notre mariage le 30 mai 1864. La Comtesse de Paris et moi nous\r\nsommes bien touchés de la manière dont vous nous le rappelez, et je vous\r\nremercie de tout coeur de ce que vous me dites et des voeux que vous\r\nm'adressez en cette occasion. Au milieu de toutes les vicissitudes de notre\r\nvie pendant ces vingt-cinq ans nous avons été constamment soutenus par\r\nle bonheur domestique que cette union nous a donné et par toutes les\r\nsatisfactions que nous ont causées nos enfants.\r\n\r\nLorsque j'ai reçu votre lettre j'allais vous écrire, ainsi qu'à Madame\r\nReeve, de vouloir bien venir ici le 30 mai dans l'après-midi: nous recevons\r\nentre 2 et 5 tous les amis qui viendront fêter cet anniversaire avec nous.\r\nJe me souviens bien que Madame Reeve était avec vous à la chapelle de\r\nKingston, mais ma mémoire n'est pas sûre en ce qui concerne Madame votre\r\nfille. Je vous serais bien reconnaissant de me faire savoir si elle était\r\navec vous ce jour-là. En attendant je vous prie de me croire Votre bien\r\naffectionné,\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE COMTE DE PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe Journal notes:--\r\n\r\n_May 7th._--The Club: Due d'Aumale, Lord Salisbury, Wolseley, Carlisle, A.\r\nRussell, Hewett, Stephen--very brilliant.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--Returned to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_16th_.--Drove to Heron Court. Lord Malmesbury dying.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--Lord Malmesbury died. 22nd, attended his funeral in Priory Church.\r\n29th, to London.\r\n\r\n_30th_.--The silver wedding of the Comte and Comtesse de Paris at Sheen.\r\nAll the French Royalties, Prince of Wales, &c. About five hundred people;\r\n169 persons still alive who were at the wedding in 1864. A silver medal was\r\nsent to all the survivors.\r\n\r\n_From M. B. St.-Hilaire_\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 6th_.--If I am free in the autumn, it will give me great\r\npleasure to pay you another visit at Foxholes; the first has left a\r\npleasant memory, and I ask no better than to repeat it. But, without having\r\nto complain of old age, I find more difficulty in going about. I am not\r\nexactly ill, but my strength gradually fails--a sign that the end is not\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\nI foresaw that General Boulanger would have no success in England; you are\r\nmuch too serious for such a nature as his. His popularity diminishes daily;\r\nand if the Cabinet act with judgement from now to the October elections,\r\nI have no doubt they may regain public favour. The triumph of Boulangism\r\nwould be the signal for horrible anarchy at home and war abroad, provoked\r\nby the madmen who had climbed into power.\r\n\r\nMonarchy, in the person of the Comte de Paris, is losing rather than\r\ngaining ground here. If France should ever return to a dynasty, it would be\r\nmore likely to be the Bonapartes. The terrible name of Napoleon has still\r\nan immense _prestige_, however unworthy his successors.\r\n\r\nM. St.-Hilaire's visit did not come off. The Journal mentions many dinners,\r\nreceptions, and garden parties in town during June and July, and eleven\r\ndays in August on board Mrs. Watney's yacht 'Palatine,' to see the naval\r\nreview on the 5th. 'Very rough weather all the time.' In September a\r\njourney to Edinburgh and on the 14th to Chesters, chronicled as 'my first\r\nvisit to my daughter.' A week later Reeve returned south; and, paying a few\r\nshort visits on the way, including a day at Knowsley, was back at Foxholes\r\nby the 26th.\r\n\r\n_From Count Vitzthum_\r\n\r\nVilla Vitzthum, Baden Baden, August 30th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Reeve,--I beg to send you the proofs of the preface and\r\ncontents, in order to show you the plan of my book.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that you do not approve of the account I have given of our\r\ninterview in September 1866. It was unfortunately too late to cancel the\r\nletter, but nothing would prevent leaving it out if those memoirs should\r\never be translated. On further consideration, and after reading the\r\nforegoing pages, you will find, I am sure, that your comment on the\r\nsituation in September 1866 was not only correct, but very valuable. The\r\npeace of Europe then was threatened by two eventualities, of which one\r\nhappened: by an ostensible alliance between Prussia and France, or by an\r\nimmediate war between both. Rouher and Lavalette worked very hard for the\r\nalliance, and your sound judgement indicated the consequences which such an\r\nalliance would have had. I quite agree with you about these relations. But\r\nthe opinion of a man like you is a fact, and an important fact; because you\r\nhave been in those days what they call a representative man; because you\r\nrepresented a great portion of the Liberal party. It does not take one iota\r\noff the value of your opinion--which, you may depend upon it, was correctly\r\nrecorded--if the course of events took another turn, and if this monster\r\nalliance remained a dream of adventurous French politicians. The thing was\r\non the cards.\r\n\r\nAs for Napoleon's malady, all I can say [is] that Nelaton, who then was\r\nconsulted for the first time, wrote a letter to King Leopold of Belgium,\r\nstating that it was very probable the Emperor of the French would be found\r\nany morning dead in his bed, and that he would most likely die before the\r\nend of November. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nVITZTHUM.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this letter Mr. Reeve wrote to Mr. T. Norton Longman:--\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 3rd._--Count Vitzthum is about to publish two more\r\nvolumes of his political reminiscences during his mission in London. I send\r\nyou the index of the work, from which you will see that it contains a good\r\ndeal of matter, anecdotes, &c., of interest to English readers. You will\r\njudge from the result of the former work whether you think it worth while\r\nto engage in the publication of a translation of these later volumes. But,\r\nas I am going away till the end of the month, I cannot negotiate with Count\r\nVitzthum or with the translator, and I must beg you to take that upon\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nA month later, however, on October 2nd, he wrote that, after seeing the\r\nbook, he was of opinion that it would not stand translation. It was\r\nreviewed in the 'Edinburgh' of January 1890, but was not translated.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_November 11th_.--I have only begun the Life of Lord John. It would be a\r\nvery difficult one to write in a spirit at once of fairness and friendship.\r\nMy impression of the man was and is that he was more thoroughly and\r\nessentially a partisan than anyone I have known; and sometimes open to the\r\ncomment, that he seemed to consider the Universe as existing for the sake\r\nof the Whig party. Perhaps this would not strike anyone who was trained up\r\nin the same school, as strongly as it did me. On the other hand, I think he\r\nwas more generally consistent, and had fewer of his own words to eat, than\r\nany politician of his time or of ours. His religious politics were his weak\r\npart; they were rather narrow and sectarian. I suppose he was forced by the\r\nCourt into his quarrel with Palmerston; which was the trouble of his later\r\nofficial life, and caused these uneasy struggles to recover a lost position\r\nwhich did him harm. But with all drawbacks he has left an honoured and\r\ndistinguished name. Do you think there is any ground for the idea which\r\nLady Russell puts about that, if he had lived till now, he would have gone\r\nfor Home Rule?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE ONE MORE CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very wide range of Reeve's studies has appeared from many indications\r\nscattered through these pages, and it has been seen how, at different\r\ntimes, he was occupying himself with various subjects far outside the\r\nordinary course of reading. These were, however, connected by some general\r\nidea which pervaded the whole. Of natural science he knew little. As a boy,\r\nthe study of mathematics was irksome to him and repulsive, nor was he at\r\nany later time more favourably inclined towards it. His acquaintance\r\nwith astronomy, chemistry, physics, and the cognate sciences was very\r\nlimited--not more, perhaps, than he picked up in his careful and\r\nintelligent study of the articles published in the 'Edinburgh Review'\r\nduring the forty years of his editorship. His real knowledge was confined\r\nby a band of history, but of history in its very widest sense, including\r\nnot only war and politics and law, but political economy, literature,\r\nreligion, and superstition. Of military science he had read sufficient to\r\ntake a technical interest in the details of battles and campaigns, and\r\nhe was perhaps one of the first landsmen of this age to understand the\r\n'influence of sea-power.' His attention had been called to this at a very\r\nearly period in his career by the utter collapse of Mehemet Ali in Syria;\r\nand reasoning on that, he had learned that 'sea-power,' or, as he preferred\r\nto call it, 'maritime-power,' controlled and directed affairs with which,\r\nat first sight, it seemed to have absolutely nothing to do.\r\n\r\nLong before Captain Mahan began to teach, or to write those admirable works\r\nwhich came as a revelation to the English and the European public, he had\r\nopened the pages of the 'Edinburgh Review' to writers who, in different\r\nways and in different degrees, were inculcating the same doctrine, which\r\nduring the long peace, and by reason of the overwhelming superiority of the\r\nallies in the Russian war, had been almost forgotten, even by professional\r\nmen. It would not be difficult to show how, during the thirty years which\r\npreceded the publication of Captain Mahan's 'Influence of Sea-Power,' its\r\nmost important theories were illustrated and discussed in the pages of the\r\n'Review.' The following, by one of the most accomplished officers in our\r\nnavy, refers to such an article in the January number:--\r\n\r\n_From Captain Bridge, R.N._\r\n\r\n_January 19th_.--As an Englishman and a sailor, I feel it to be a duty\r\nagain to congratulate you on the article 'Naval Supremacy,' &c., in the new\r\nnumber of the 'Edinburgh Review.' That article and the one concerning which\r\nI previously addressed you can hardly fail to do good. The Maurician school\r\nand its 'two Army-corps and a cavalry division,' which were to be launched\r\nat the Caucasus, must have received a severe check from the earlier\r\narticle. The disaster-breeding facts of the fort-builders can hardly\r\nsurvive many more such assaults as that so sharply driven home in 'Naval\r\nSupremacy.' The opinions of the writer of the latter, I venture to think,\r\nforeshadow those of the Navy on the subject of huge ships and huge guns.\r\nI hold it to be highly beneficial to the country that the editor of the\r\n'Edinburgh Review' should have so keen an appreciation and, for a civilian,\r\nso rare a knowledge of naval affairs.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_April 3rd_--What a new Europe is beginning! Bismarck dismissed; Emperors\r\nholding Socialist conferences; more attempts to murder the Tsar; strikes\r\nall over the world; Germans going to Prussianise Central Africa! No want of\r\nnovelty in our time and amusing enough, if one is far enough off.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Chantilly_, 14 _juin_.--Où diable avais-je la tête, mon cher ami? (ne\r\nmontrez pas ce préambule à nos amis puritains.) Je croyais bien vous avoir\r\nécrit que je comptais passer la mer vers le 22, dîner avec le Club le 24,\r\nembrasser mes neveux et nièces de toutes générations, voir quelques amis,\r\net rentrer ici vers la fin de la semaine. Je persiste dans ce projet,\r\n_weather permitting_; c'est-à-dire sauf le cas de tempête que l'on est bien\r\nforcé de prévoir avec une pareille saison. A bientôt donc, s'il plaît à\r\nDieu. Je finis mieux que je ne commence, et je vous serre la main.\r\n\r\nH. D'O.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Chantilly_, 26 _juillet_.--J'essaye de chasser par le travail les\r\npréoccupations qui m'obsèdent. Je n'y réussis pas toujours. Est-ce l'effet\r\nde l'âge? mais je suis de plus en plus anxieux sur l'avenir de mon pays et\r\nmême de l'Europe. Nous sommes dans le faux depuis 1848, et il est sorti de\r\nla guerre de '70 un état de choses bien périlleux.\r\n\r\nAu revoir et mille amitiés.\r\n\r\nThe diary and the correspondence for the rest of the year are singularly\r\nbarren of interest. A troublesome attack of sciatica in the end of July led\r\nto Reeve's being advised to try Harrogate, whither he accordingly went\r\nin the beginning of August. He found the place--possibly also the\r\nwater--disagreeable, and after a week's stay he went on to Bolton Abbey, to\r\nMinto, and to Chesters. By the end of the month he was back at Foxholes,\r\nwhere he remained throughout September. Early in October he went for a ten\r\ndays' visit to Knowsley, where he met Froude and the Duc d'Aumale, with\r\nwhom he returned to London. Then to Foxholes for a month, coming up to\r\ntown in the middle of November, and--with the exception of a week at\r\nEaster--staying there till May 1891.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_Knowsley, January 20th_.--What do you think of Home Rule in its present\r\nphase? Chamberlain says it is dead; I say it is badly crippled, but capable\r\nof a good deal of mischief still. I see no new question coming forward,\r\nexcept that of strikes, eight-hours legislation, and Socialism generally.\r\n\r\nDo you ever see the 'New Review'? I picked it up yesterday, and read a very\r\npretty Socialist programme by Morris and a Mr. Bernard Shaw, whom I never\r\nheard of before, but who is apparently rather clever and rather cracked. I\r\nsuspect ideas of that class are making progress.\r\n\r\nThis letter, though not calling for any hurry, Reeve answered immediately,\r\nas was his general custom. It was indeed only by this prompt attention\r\nthat, with the enormous correspondence which he carried on, he could\r\nprevent an accumulation which would have been overwhelming.\r\n\r\n_To Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n62 _Rutland Gate, January 21st_.--I think Home Rule, as an English party\r\ncry, has received a death blow, and cannot be used to bring a party into\r\npower. But Ireland remains open, an eternal field of agitation, and the\r\nIrishmen are still in the House of Commons. Perhaps the want of funds may\r\nembarrass them. I have not seen the 'New Review,' but there is a vast deal\r\nof lawlessness and wild speculation in the air, injurious to the first\r\nconditions of social life, and I confess I have no unbounded confidence in\r\nthe boasted good sense of the English people; they are very ignorant and\r\nvery selfish. No one tells them so many sensible home truths as yourself.\r\nAs for the strikes, the strikers are the greatest sufferers.\r\n\r\nI have published a remarkable article on the fiscal system of the United\r\nStates--by an American--which I hope you will read. My contributor thinks\r\nthere are great difficulties ahead in America, and Mr. Blaine's bluster is\r\nan attempt to direct public attention into another channel.\r\n\r\nI have been laid up for some days with a cold and gout, but have been out\r\nto-day and am better. I never remember so terrible a winter; but we hope it\r\nis passing away, though it is still freezing here.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, May 12th_.--I was sorry to leave London without seeing you and\r\nLady Derby again; but the Fates were against me: you were laid up with\r\ncold, and I have been troubled for some weeks with sciatica, which impedes\r\nmy movements. I hope you have shaken off your attack and will get out of\r\ntown. The atmosphere of London seems to be in a very noxious state, and I\r\ndon't know that the atmosphere of the House of Commons is much better. A\r\ncommittee of the whole House strikes an outsider as the clumsiest machine\r\nfor legislation that was ever invented.\r\n\r\nAn unlimited power of moving amendments brings us to the same results as\r\nthe Polish Veto.\r\n\r\nI hope to come up to the dinners of The Club on June 2nd and 16th. On the\r\nlatter day the Duc d'Aumale will dine with us, so I trust you will keep it\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n_From Lord Derby_\r\n\r\n_May 13th_.--You are quite right about the House of Commons. They will\r\npass the Land Bill, I suppose, but scarcely anything else. Most of the\r\nobstruction is unintended; loquacity, vanity, and fear of constituents do\r\nmore mischief than faction. I am not sure that it is an unmixed evil that\r\nthe legislative coach should be compelled to drive slowly.\r\n\r\nFor Reeve the principal social event of the year, or rather the one most\r\nout of ordinary course, was the conferring an honorary degree on the Duc\r\nd'Aumale by the University of Oxford. Of the preliminary step no record\r\nremains, but it would seem that at a very early stage Reeve was requested\r\nto sound the Duke, who wrote on November 30th, 1890, that he should feel\r\ngreatly honoured if the University of Oxford should confer on him the\r\ndegree of D.C.L.--'si pauvre légiste que je sois.' On this Reeve wrote to\r\nDr. Liddell, then Dean of Christ Church, [Footnote: After having held this\r\noffice for thirty-six years, Dr. Liddell retired in 1891, and died at the\r\nage of 87, on January 18th, 1898.] who replied on December 2nd:--\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Reeve,--I shall be proud to propose H.R.H.'s (the Duc d'Aumale's)\r\nname for an Honorary Degree at the next Encaenia. This will not be till\r\nJune 17th, 1891. I hope his R.H. will be my guest on the occasion.\r\nMeantime, it is our rule that no mention should be made of the name to be\r\nproposed. Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nH. G. LIDDELL.\r\n\r\nOther correspondence about this there was, and on February 25th, 1891, Dr.\r\nLiddell again wrote:--\r\n\r\nThe arrangements you suggest for the Duc d'Aumale will suit very well. Of\r\ncourse it is running it rather fine to arrive at 11.13; but we will see\r\nabout this as the time approaches. Meantime I must ask you and the Duke's\r\nfriends not to say anything about the matter at present. I shall have to\r\ngive notice to our Council in May. A fortnight after, his name will be\r\nsubmitted to ballot; and though there can be no reasonable doubt that\r\nH.R.H.'s name will be received with acclamation, they make a great point of\r\nsecrecy till the ballot takes place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps about the beginning of May you will be so good as to send me a\r\ncomplete statement of H.R.H.'s claims to an Honorary Degree. I know much\r\nabout them, but should be glad to be fully equipped.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Chantilly_, 9 _juin_.--Bon! très cher ami, nous irons, s'il plaît à Dieu,\r\nensemble à Oxford, le 17, par 9.55 en cravate blanche. Je compte arriver le\r\n14 au soir à Claridge's, où je serai présent le lundi, 15, de 10 à midi,\r\net de 6 à 7; le mardi, 16, de 10 à midi. Si vous pouvez venir m'y voir,\r\nje serai très heureux, car j'ai encore besoin de quelques renseignements\r\ncomplimentaires.\r\n\r\nVous m'avez offert l'hospitalité du Dean, et je lui ai écrit que je\r\nl'acceptais. Mais en quoi consiste cette hospitalité? Simple luncheon suivi\r\nd'un départ, ou dîner et coucher au doyenné? Je ne voudrais pas manquer de\r\ncourtoisie; but above all I would not intrude--et je suis _très disposé_\r\nà me retirer de très bonne heure. Seulement j'aimerais à être fixé pour\r\nprendre tous mes arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Journal simply notes that on June 16th the Duc d'Aumale dined at The\r\nClub; and on the 17th 'with Duc d'Aumale to Oxford, where he was made\r\nD.C.L. Lunch at All Souls; very pleasant day.' Reeve left early and\r\nreturned at once to Foxholes.\r\n\r\n_From the Duc d'Aumale_\r\n\r\n_Chantilly_, 1er _juillet_.--Après votre départ de Christ Church [Oxford]\r\nle 17 nous avons eu le ou la 'Gaudy.' Ainsi que vous l'aviez prévu, j'ai dû\r\ndire quelques mots à peine préparés. Comme il n'y avait pas de _reporter_,\r\net que je n'avais aucune note, et comme l'auditoire, y compris nos\r\nSeigneurs les évêques, avait accueilli mon _speech_ avec bienveillance, je\r\nl'ai noté sur le papier--comme disent les musiciens--avant de me coucher.\r\nVous avez été presque mon parrain à Oxford, je vous en dois bien la copie.\r\nC'est, en tous cas, un témoignage de ma fidèle amitié.\r\n\r\nThe speech which follows, although delivered under circumstances which\r\nnecessitated a complimentary tone, is a more than usually graceful tribute\r\nto our old Universities, and the introduction of the little analogue is\r\nsingularly happy. The Duke, whose letters to Reeve are all in French, wrote\r\nthis _verbatim_ as here given, in correct English, perfectly well spelt.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean, my Lords and Gentlemen,--Let me first express how highly I prize\r\nthe honour which has been conferred upon me to-day, and how glad I am to be\r\nso connected with your illustrious University. I have always admired the\r\nUniversity of Oxford. I have more than once visited this town, when I\r\nreceived a princely hospitality in the noble baronial halls of this\r\nneighbourhood--Nuneham, Blenheim--or when I was quietly living on the banks\r\nof the Avon. Often I brought here my French friends, and I tried to\r\nexplain the peculiarities, the complicated machinery of this illustrious\r\ncorporation; to show how, remaining faithful to the traditions, preserving\r\nyour old customs, you did not remain deaf to what might be said without,\r\nnor blind to the movement of the world; how, slowly perhaps, but prudently,\r\nstep by step, you managed to bring the necessary changes, the wanted\r\nmodifications, so as to keep pace with the times without breaking with the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n'Mais c'est le couteau de Jeannot que cette Université,' said one of my\r\ninterlocutors. Well, I will give you the tale of Jeannot's knife.\r\n\r\nThere was once a young peasant called Jeannot, and he had a knife of which\r\nhe took great care. He found that the blade was rusting and he changed the\r\nblade. Then he found that the handle was decaying from dry-rot, and he\r\nchanged the handle; and so on. His friends laughed at him, and would not\r\ntake the same care of their knives, which they lost--one breaking the\r\nblade, another the handle. But Jeannot, having always kept his knife in\r\ngood order, could always make use of it, cleverly and powerfully.\r\n\r\nWell, I think there is some analogy between the tale of this humble man and\r\nthe history of your great University. It seems to me I see the huge frame\r\nof a large fabric which has stood for centuries glorious and proud. The\r\nstones are changed, the bricks, the mortar, or the roof are renewed; and\r\nthe fabric still stands through the ages, through the storms, glorious and\r\nproud. And I hope it will so remain and stand everlasting, with its old\r\nframe and the new materials; and I wish glory and prosperity to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.\r\n\r\nTo all who have thought of my name and conferred upon me the honour I have\r\njust received, and to those who have given me such a kindly reception, I\r\nsend my best thanks, and I wish prosperity and success.\r\n\r\nAt this time, and indeed ever since his retirement from the Council Office,\r\nReeve's chief work was in connexion with the 'Review;' but he also did a\r\nvery great deal as literary adviser of the Longmans. He had indeed, to some\r\nextent, acted in this capacity ever since he undertook the conduct of the\r\n'Review;' the two offices fitted into and were supplementary to each other;\r\nand it will be remembered that in 1875 [Footnote: See _ante_, p. 243.]\r\nhe had contemplated retiring from the public service, with the view\r\nof undertaking the main responsibility of this work for the firm.\r\nCircumstances had delayed his retirement; but by an arrangement with the\r\nfirm in 1878, which continued in force during the rest of his life, the\r\nnumber of works he examined and reported on was considerably increased, and\r\nmust have been very large. Books in French, German, or Italian offered for\r\ntranslation, MSS. in English offered for publication--whatever there was of\r\ngrave, serious, or important, as well as a good deal that was not, was sent\r\nto him for a first or a revised opinion. And this opinion was given very\r\nfrankly, and most commonly in the fewest possible words: 'My advice is that\r\nyou have nothing to do with it' was a not unfrequent formula. Another,\r\nless frequent, was, 'He--the aspirant to literary fame and emolument--can\r\nneither write nor spell English;' 'I wish they wouldn't send their trash to\r\nme' was an occasional prayer; 'Seems to me sheer nonsense;'--'What a waste\r\nof time and labour!'--'It is very provoking that people should attempt to\r\nwrite books who cannot write English,' were occasional reports. Of course\r\nmany of his judgements were very different: 'A work of great interest which\r\nmust have a large sale;' 'Secure this if you possibly can;' 'A most\r\nable work, but will scarcely command a remunerative sale;' 'Not worth\r\ntranslating, but send me a copy for the \"Review,\"' are some of his more\r\nfavourable verdicts. But in all cases the judgements were sharp and\r\ndecisive; there was about them nothing of the celebrated 'This work might\r\nbe very good if it was not extremely bad,' or its converse. These reports\r\nwere, of course, in the highest degree confidential; and, especially of the\r\nunfavourable ones, Reeve made a point of forgetting all about the origin of\r\nthem. On one occasion, when a reference was made to a work he had reported\r\non a few weeks before, he wrote in reply, 'The numerous MSS. &c. sent for\r\nan opinion leave no trace on my memory.'\r\n\r\nAs it was with printed books and larger MSS., so it was with articles\r\nsubmitted for the 'Review;' but he did not encourage casual contributions,\r\nand seldom--perhaps never--accepted any without some previous\r\nunderstanding. The political articles and the reviews of important books\r\nwere almost invariably written in response to a direct invitation; but\r\nwhether the articles sent in were invited or offered, he equally reserved\r\nthe right to express his approval or disapproval or disagreement, and to\r\ninsist, if necessary, on the article being remodelled or withdrawn. Such\r\nan insistence is more than once noticed in his correspondence, quite\r\nirrespective of the high reputation of the author. Probably every one whose\r\ncontributions have been at all numerous has had an opportunity of noticing\r\nhow perfectly candid and yet how courteous his remarks always were. If an\r\narticle pleased him, he said so in terms that from anyone else might have\r\nseemed extravagant. Many letters of this type might be given; one must\r\nsuffice, written to a valued contributor, dead, unfortunately, many years\r\nago--Colonel Charles Cornwallis Chesney:--\r\n\r\n_C. O., February 26th, 1873_.--I received the proofs of your article on Lee\r\nlast night, and therefore I conclude that you have received them also. I\r\ndon't exaggerate the least when I say that the article strikes me as\r\na _chef d'oeuvre_ of military biography. You have drawn a most heroic\r\ncharacter with peculiar grace and fervour, and the account of the military\r\noperations is singularly clear and interesting. It only strikes me that you\r\nhave repeated the comparison with Hannibal rather too often.\r\n\r\nPray be so good as to return the proofs to _me_ as soon as you can, that I\r\nmay have the article made up and printed off. I feel infinitely obliged to\r\nyou for it.\r\n\r\nThe value of such praise was heightened, its apparent extravagance done\r\naway with, by the knowledge that dissatisfaction would be expressed in\r\nlanguage equally unmistakable, and that either by the contributor or the\r\neditor the modifications which seemed to him desirable would be made. It\r\nwas partly because he reserved to himself this power and accepted all the\r\nresponsibility, that he insisted so strenuously on the anonymous character\r\nof the articles. But more even than that was his abhorrence of anything\r\nlike 'log-rolling,' which, in his opinion, was inseparable from signed\r\nreviews. To the very last he discouraged, and indeed openly expressed his\r\ndisapproval and dislike of the presumably inspired announcements of\r\nauthors' names in the 'Athenaeum' or other journals. Here is an extract\r\nfrom a letter dated October 6th, 1891, which illustrates this objection:--\r\n'The only objection I have to the republication of articles with the name\r\nof the writer is that it destroys their anonymous character, which ought\r\nespecially to be retained when they contain criticism of contemporaries.'\r\nSo careful was he lest anything might warp the perfect fairness of\r\ncriticism, which should 'nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.'\r\nI, who write these lines, can say positively, after having written for the\r\n'Review' under Reeve for upwards of twenty years, that in all that time I\r\nnever received a hint or suggestion that any book should be dealt with\r\notherwise than on its merits; and whilst engaged on this present work I\r\nhave learned, for the first time, that men whose books I have reviewed,\r\nnot always favourably, were personal friends of the editor. The following\r\nletter, addressed to Mr. T. N. Longman, is merely a concrete illustration\r\nof this:--\r\n\r\n_December 26th_, 1891.--I thought it best to tell Froude frankly that the\r\nreview of his book [Footnote: The Divorce of Catherine of Aragon,' in the\r\n_Review_ of January 1892.] in the 'Edinburgh' would be an unfavourable one.\r\nAt the same time I disclaimed in the strongest language any disposition\r\nto make a personal attack on himself. Unfortunately he seems to ascribe\r\nadverse criticism of his works to personal animosity, which, in his case,\r\nis entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nIt is a painful necessity. Froude and his book are too important to be\r\npassed over in silence. But the judicial character and consistency, and I\r\nmay say honour, of the 'Review' absolutely require that the truth should be\r\ntold about the book. I should consider it a derogation to my duty to the\r\n'Review' if, from personal motives or affection, I suppressed an adverse\r\ncriticism of a work which imperatively demands an answer. The independence\r\nof the 'Review' requires an independent judgement; but I expressly\r\nstipulated with the writer of the article that he should abstain from\r\n_bitterness_, which was carried too far in Goldwin Smith's article on\r\nthe same subject in 1858. The 'Review' is pledged to the views already\r\nexpressed on that occasion.\r\n\r\nI have therefore modified as far as possible any expressions which appeared\r\nto be of too censorious a character; but it is impossible to avoid\r\ncondemning a mistaken book because the author is a personal friend. _Judex\r\ndamnatur si nocens absolvitur_ is our motto.\r\n\r\nFroude does not like Mr. Gardiner's book. He says, 'It's a menagerie of\r\ntame beasts.' I think very highly of the book; and as we differ, I have\r\nyielded to his wish to be released from the engagement.\r\n\r\nNobody can regret more than I do any differences between old friends; but\r\nmy duty is to look solely to the consistency and integrity of the 'Review,'\r\nwithout which criticism is worthless; and this consideration leaves me no\r\nother course.\r\n\r\nAnother point, of a similar nature, I can illustrate by my own experience.\r\nI had undertaken, at Reeve's request, to review a rather important\r\nhistorical work published by Longmans, but on reading it was so\r\nunfavourably impressed by it that I wrote to say that the best thing I\r\ncould do would be to return the volumes; that the book was bad, and if\r\nI reviewed it I must say so; but that doing this in the publisher's own\r\nReview would have a certain resemblance to seething a kid in its mother's\r\nmilk, and might probably be objected to. 'Not a bit of it,' was the sense\r\nof the reply I received by return of post: 'a bad book may be the text for\r\nan interesting article, and we have nothing to do with who published it.'\r\nSo I expressed my opinion of the book in very plain terms; the review was\r\nprinted exactly as I wrote it, and the editor thanked me warmly for what\r\nhe was pleased to speak of as an 'excellent article.' It may, perhaps, be\r\nassumed that this was not an isolated case; but written evidence of any\r\nothers is not before me.\r\n\r\nAfter returning from Oxford, Reeve spent the rest of the year at Foxholes,\r\nHe had intended going to London and possibly to Scotland in October, but an\r\naccidental stumble in his library over a heavy despatch box made a nasty\r\nwound on the left shin, which took many weeks in healing and prevented his\r\ntravelling till the middle of December. On the 19th he went to town, where,\r\nwith the exception of some short visits to Bath or to Foxholes, he remained\r\ntill June, dining several times at The Club, entertaining at home in his\r\ncustomary manner, and keeping up a constant--almost daily--correspondence,\r\nsuch as has been indicated, with the Longmans, for the most part with the\r\nhead of the firm, whom he had known from childhood and habitually addressed\r\nby his Christian name.\r\n\r\nAs he returned to Foxholes the country was in the throes of a general\r\nelection. Tired, it would seem, of steady and consistent government, it\r\nlonged for a change--anything for a change; and so opened the door for an\r\nadministration whose almost avowed object was to play skittles with the\r\nConstitution--to bowl down the Union, the Established Church, the House\r\nof Lords, the rights of property, and any other little trifles that were\r\nsacred to law and religion. It was with deep regret that Reeve watched the\r\noverthrow of what he considered the true Liberal party, and he wrote to Mr.\r\nT. Norton Longman:--\r\n\r\n_Foxholes_, _July 14th_--The results of the elections are far worse than\r\ncould be expected. Some of them are very odd. I have to deplore the defeat\r\nof many of my friends. I suppose the Queen will have to make up her mind\r\nto a ministry composed of men she abhors; but the majority will have in it\r\ninherent weakness and the seeds of dissolution.\r\n\r\nI have found it difficult to say anything about the elections and have been\r\nas short as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom a somewhat different point of view, he wrote a few days later to Lord\r\nDerby:--\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, July 22nd._--I have, of course, been watching with great\r\ninterest the progress of the elections, and I am happy to say that\r\nHampshire, like all the southern counties, comes out with a clean Unionist\r\nbill. If the ultimate majority was to be small, is it not better to be in\r\nopposition than in power? Mr. Gladstone's position, as the man responsible\r\nfor the conduct of affairs, is much less desirable than that of Lord\r\nSalisbury, for he has the better half of the country dead against him. How\r\ncurious it is to trace on the map in the 'Times' the old traditions of\r\nSaxon, Celtic, Mercian, and Danish origin in the counties of England,\r\nIreland, and Wales! Are the Celts to govern the Saxons?\r\n\r\nEarly in August Reeve was visited at Foxholes by Count Adam Krasinski\r\n[Footnote: Son of Ladislas and grandson of Reeve's early friend Sigismond\r\nKrasinski. He was born in 1870, and married at Vienna in 1897.]--a\r\nconnecting link with the past, the merry days when he was young; and on\r\nKrasinski's departure, he went north to visit some friends in Wales and\r\nthence on to Chesters.\r\n\r\nParliament met on August 4th, and on a simple motion of want of confidence,\r\nas an amendment to the Address, the Ministry was defeated. Lord Salisbury\r\nresigned, and Mr. Gladstone came into office with a Cabinet in which every\r\nshade of unconstitutional opinion and every socially destructive fad were\r\nfully represented. Reeve consoled himself with the belief that such a\r\nministry could not last. To Mr. T. Norton Longman he wrote:--\r\n\r\n_Chesters, August 22nd_.--I have been paying some visits in Wales and have\r\ncome on here, where Mrs. Reeve preceded me. We find the Ogilvies very\r\nflourishing, and the place beautiful. Here, at least, it is not hot, which\r\nseems to be the grievance elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe are going to Rutland Gate on Friday and to Foxholes on Monday, and shall\r\nremain there, except for a visit to a neighbour.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Gladstone's Ministry a wretched affair. The old ones are worn\r\nout, and the young ones are not broken in, and bring no weight at all.\r\nThe sole gratification of every one of them is absolute submission and\r\nobedience to the Chief. But he will have some troublesome outsiders.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 7th_.--We shall stay here till October 6th, when I\r\nmean to come to London for two or three days, on our way to Knowsley. The\r\nworld seems fast asleep after the excitement of the summer, and people have\r\nnothing to talk or write about but the cholera--which is not amusing.\r\n\r\nIt was whilst at Chesters that Reeve received a curious note from the\r\nMarquis of Lorne, written to 'The Editor of the \"Edinburgh Review,\"' as to\r\na total stranger:--\r\n\r\nOsborne, August 21st.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have found a number of original unpublished letters written by the\r\nDuke of Argyll in 1705 and the Earl of Leven in 1706, from Edinburgh, to\r\nQueen Anne and Godolphin, on the measures taken in the Scots Parliament\r\nfor the Union between England and Scotland, and am writing a notice of and\r\ngiving extracts from these papers, and wish to ask if you would care to\r\nhave this notice as an article in your 'Review.'\r\n\r\nI remain, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nLORNE.\r\n\r\nReeve's answer corrected the mistake, and in forwarding the MS. referred\r\nto, to Foxholes, Lord Lorne wrote:--\r\n\r\nKensington Palace, September 5th.\r\n\r\nMy dear and ancient friend and editor,--I did not know, to my disgrace,\r\nthat you are still in command. I never thought when the grey mare subsided\r\nunder you at Inveraray, in--year, [Footnote: Blank in the original; meaning\r\npresumably--'so long ago that I've forgotten.' Reeve's one recorded visit\r\nto Inveraray was in August 1858 (_ante_, vol. i. p. 395), when the Marquis\r\nof Lorne was a boy of thirteen.] that in 1892 I should be writing to you\r\nabout proofs! It makes me feel young again to think of you in your old\r\ncapacity. If old times' gossip suits the 'Review,' please send the proofs\r\nto me here--to Kensington Palace--whence, if I be away, they will be\r\nforwarded to me.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nLORNE.\r\n\r\nA few days later came the following letter from Count Adam Krasinski, to\r\nwhom, when at Foxholes, Reeve had given the letters of his grandfather,\r\nSigismond Krasinski.\r\n\r\nRoyalin, September 10th.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On arriving in Warsaw a few days ago, I took the liberty of sending\r\nyou some bottles of wine from our cellar, among which is some\r\nHungarian Tokay, one of the oldest wines we have, bought by my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, the father of General Vincent, in the year of the\r\nlatter's birth. I hope you will be so good as to accept this little\r\npresent and make it welcome; for, being young myself, I have chosen an old\r\nambassador to thank you for your kindness to me. I can never sufficiently\r\nthank you for the charming way in which you have made me the handsome\r\npresent of my grandfather's correspondence, which is of inestimable value\r\nto me. The more I read it the more I realise its value. It contains the\r\nwhole developement of a noble character, and a fine nature, set forth in\r\nlong, full, and frequent letters to a trusted friend. And what a pleasure\r\nit is to have the answers of this friend, so clearly showing your relations\r\nto each other, and the reciprocal influence of two minds! Thanks, and again\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nI am very well, and am at present with my stepfather in the Grand Duchy of\r\nPosnanie. Our plans for the winter are not yet fixed. Paris attracts me\r\ngreatly; but, on the other hand, I am advised to go to Heidelberg, where\r\nthere is better air and a milder climate. In any case, I will endeavour to\r\nrevisit England next year, and so recall myself to your memory.\r\n\r\nAgréez, Monsieur, l'expression de ma très grande considération, à laquelle\r\nje joins des sentiments respectueux pour Madame votre femme.\r\n\r\nADAM KRASINSKI.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Norton Longman at this time Reeve wrote--primarily on the business\r\nof the 'Review,' but incidentally on a literary conundrum which was just\r\nthen causing a little excitement:--\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 16th_.--I do not think the translation of a French\r\nbook on Political Economy is _primâ facie_ advisable. But the book seems\r\n(from the accounts in the 'Nation') to be so excellent that I should be\r\nglad to see it, and may have it reviewed in the 'Edinburgh.' The title is,\r\n'Le Capital, la Spéculation et la Finance au XIXe Siècle;' par Claudio\r\nJannet. Published by Plon.\r\n\r\nNo one who knew Sir Richard Wallace could believe that he wrote 'The\r\nEnglishman in Paris.' I said from the first that it was a mere collection\r\nof old gossip to be passed off on the English public as something racy. If\r\nGrenville Murray were alive, this is exactly the sort of thing he would\r\nhave done. But Grenville Murray left a son, who must now be grown up, and\r\nwho may have inherited some of his father's sinister talents. They have\r\nlived for many years in Paris. Sir Richard Wallace was the very type of a\r\ngentleman of the highest breeding--rather stern, melancholy, not at all\r\nhumorous, and incapable of vulgarity or pretence.\r\n\r\nOctober slipped away in visits to Stratton (Lord Northbrook's) and to\r\nKnowsley, and the remainder of the year for the most part at Foxholes. In\r\nDecember Reeve was proposing to have a review of Sir Mountstuart Grant\r\nDuff's 'Life of Sir Henry Maine,' and consulted the author as to who would\r\nbe the best fitted to write it. This is what Sir Mountstuart wrote in\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n_Twickenham, December 11th_.--I am very proud to find that so excellent a\r\njudge thinks well of my little memoir of Maine. As to the article about\r\nwhich you write, I think Sir Frederick Pollock would be very much the best\r\nman to undertake it--the only man who could tell us, without any bias, what\r\nI exceedingly want to know: how much of Maine's juridical speculations,\r\nespecially in 'Ancient Law,' is finally accepted. He may say that he has\r\nsaid his say about Maine; but he has not; he has said a little, but I am\r\nsure he has a great deal more to say. I wish to know the real value of each\r\nof Maine's books.... I am writing a quite small book about Renan--the only\r\ngreat Frenchman of our day whom you did not know very well.\r\n\r\nThe next was a Christmas greeting from Lord Derby, with an interesting\r\ncomment on the situation in France:--\r\n\r\n_Knowsley, December 5th_.--Thanks for your letter of inquiry and good\r\nwishes; the latter are cordially returned. Lady Derby joins me in the hope\r\nthat the coming year may be one of health and happiness to you and yours. I\r\ncannot give a very rosy account of myself, being still ill and weak; even\r\nif all goes well, I expect to have to lead in future a life of quiet\r\nand privacy. My days of speeches are almost certainly ended; and after\r\nforty-four years of public life, I do not much regret it.\r\n\r\nThe developement of events in 1893 will be interesting to watch. All\r\nreports agree that Gladstone is taking the work of his office very easily,\r\nand that he leaves nearly everything to his colleagues. That will not be so\r\neasy in the Session. The Cabinet will be prevented by fear of ridicule\r\nfrom breaking up on the Irish Bill, but all their friends and backers seem\r\nprepared for its failure.\r\n\r\nYou are a hopeless pessimist as to French affairs. They certainly are not\r\ngoing on smoothly, but where is the new Boulanger? Bourbons and Bonapartes\r\nare played out; and France might advertise for a dictator without finding\r\none. If that be so, what threatens the republic? A socialist outbreak would\r\nonly strengthen it. Surely a nation may go on muddling its affairs a long\r\nwhile without mortal harm.\r\n\r\nWaddington, I am told, was informed by his friends that he had no right\r\nto remain a Senator without taking his seat, and that he must give up one\r\nposition or the other. This is the excuse made for his recall. The truth, I\r\nsuppose, is that his place was wanted. He will be a real loss.\r\n\r\nWith the new year the party from Foxholes came to town, and there Reeve was\r\nlaid up with a serious illness which lasted nearly a month. The Journal\r\nnotes on February 7th--'I attended a dinner of The Club, and resigned the\r\ntreasurership, which I had held for twenty-five years.' A corresponding\r\nentry a month later, on March 7th, is 'At the third dinner of The Club.\r\nLord Salisbury came \"to my obsequies\" and Gladstone wrote to me. Grant Duff\r\nelected to the treasurership.'\r\n\r\nSir Mountstuart Grant Duff has been so good as to amplify this by a note\r\nfrom his own diary. 'At the dinner on February 7th, 1893'--he writes--'I\r\nwas in the chair.... Reeve made a statement for which he had prepared me\r\nby letter, to the effect that his great age, breaking health, and frequent\r\nabsences from London, would oblige him to resign ere long the treasurership\r\nof The Club--the only office which exists in connection with it. He has\r\nheld it for some five-and-twenty years, and it is not surprising that his\r\nvoice faltered as he addressed us....\r\n\r\n_March 21st_--Dined with The Club, taking my seat for the first time as\r\ntreasurer. After the last meeting mentioned, Reeve wrote to me to say that\r\nthere was a feeling in favour of my becoming his successor, and asked\r\nwhether I should object. I replied in the negative, and on the 7th I was\r\nunanimously elected, upon the proposal of Sir Henry Elliot, who was in the\r\nchair, and was seconded by Lord Salisbury.'\r\n\r\nOf the correspondence of this period there is little. Lord Derby, who was\r\nalmost, or quite, the last of his political correspondents, was too ill\r\nto write, and died on April 21st. On the 27th Reeve attended the funeral\r\nservice at St. Margaret's. Letters relating to the 'Review,' of course,\r\ncontinued. Here are three referring to a political problem which, so lately\r\nas five years ago, few could have the patience to be bothered with. That\r\nReeve, at his advanced age, could take it up with such interest is a strong\r\nproof of the vitality and even freshness of his intellect.\r\n\r\n_To Rear-Admiral Bridge_\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate: April 27th.\r\n\r\nMy dear admiral,--I wish you would read an article in 'Blackwood's\r\nMagazine' for May (just out) on the Russian occupation of Manchuria. I\r\nnever read a more impudent piece of _blague._ ------ must have written it.\r\nNobody else would boast of swindling the Chinese with a false map.\r\n\r\nThis induces me to ask whether you could not give me a short article for\r\nthe 'Review' on The Russians on the Pacific' and the naval effects of their\r\nposition at Vladivostock. They have made it a fortress, but it will take a\r\nlong time to make it a settlement. But it may become important.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\n_April 30th._--I am very glad you will revert to the North Pacific. You\r\nshould refer to your excellent article of 1880, which I have read over\r\nagain. It seems to exhaust the subject as far as relates to the settlements\r\non the Amoor, and even as to Vladivostock; but I suppose that thirteen\r\nyears have materially augmented the strength of Russia on the Pacific, and\r\nany additional information would be valuable.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, May 23rd_.--I am much obliged to you for your interesting\r\narticle. I think the best heading would be 'Russia on the Pacific.' As I am\r\nmuch pressed for room, I have ventured to excise some of your introductory\r\nremarks, which are not essential to the main objects of the paper; but when\r\nyou come to positive business at Vladivostock, all that you say is most\r\nexcellent and important. I believe the Siberian railroad--like the line to\r\nSamarkand--is only a single line. Such a line 5,000 miles long is a very\r\nineffective instrument for military and commercial purposes. How much can\r\nit carry, allowing for return trains, chiefly empty? Where is Russia, with\r\na debt equal in charge to our own, to find forty millions sterling for such\r\na work, which would be wholly unproductive? It is true that, by employing\r\ntroops and Turkomans, the work may be done cheaply; but all this will take\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you touch on the question between France and Siam: it is a\r\nserious one.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of July the Reeves settled down for the summer at\r\nFoxholes, avoiding the great heat, with the thermometer at 80° F. when in\r\nLondon it was reaching as high as 93° F. In the beginning of September\r\nReeve, together with his wife, returned to London, crossed over to\r\nBoulogne, and so to Chantilly, where, as the guests of the Due d'Aumale,\r\nthey spent his 80th birthday. They stayed there till the 12th, and\r\nreturned, again by Boulogne and London, to Foxholes. It was his last visit\r\nto the France he had loved so well. The year was in many respects a sad\r\none. His own health was becoming very uncertain, and gout, feverish colds,\r\nand violent bleeding of the nose laid him up for weeks at a time. The\r\ndeaths of his friends, too, recurring in rapid succession, were frequent\r\nreminders of what he had written nearly sixty-two years before: 'Between\r\nseventy and eighty there rarely remains more than one change to be made.'\r\n[Footnote: See _ante_, vol. i. p. 17.] He had now exceeded the higher\r\nlimit, and it happened that the obituary of 1893 contained an unusual\r\nnumber of men of high literary and scientific distinction. Through all,\r\nhowever, Reeve's head remained clear, and his work was seldom disturbed.\r\nThere is no sickness or feebleness in the following:--\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 3rd._--I have read a great part of the 'Life of\r\nPusey'--an appalling book from the length of the letters in it. In my\r\nopinion it lays bare, as nothing else has done, the total weakness and\r\ninconsistency of the Tractarians, and their absolute disloyalty to the\r\nChurch of England. It is very difficult and very important to find a\r\nsuitable person to review such a work, for it must be done in the spirit\r\nof the articles of Arnold, Tait, and Arthur Stanley, which express the\r\nprinciples of the 'Edinburgh Review.' I incline to think it had better be\r\ndone by a layman. The parsons are all hostile to their own Church.\r\n\r\n_To Rear-Admiral Bridge_\r\n\r\n62 _Rutland Gate, November 12th._--We are come to town, and I hope it will\r\nnot be long before I have the pleasure of seeing you. Meanwhile, I have\r\nbeen reading again the article on Mediterranean Politics which you gave us\r\nlast autumn. The combination of the French and Russian fleets seems to me\r\nto be a matter of grave importance. Both those countries are unhappily\r\nanimated by very hostile intentions to us. They have discovered that it\r\nis only by a superiority of sea power in the Mediterranean that they can\r\naccomplish their twofold object, which I take to be for Russia to force the\r\nDardanelles and for France to compel us to evacuate Egypt. This seems to me\r\nto be the _but_ of the alliance, in as far as it is an alliance. It is all\r\nvery well to talk of our maritime supremacy, but have we got it? You\r\nknow, and I do not. But to my mind, the worst is that we have got a\r\nGovernment--or rather a minister--profoundly incapable of foreseeing a\r\ngreat emergency or providing against it. It is quite possible that the\r\nGladstone administration may be blown up by a tremendous catastrophe. These\r\nthoughts perplex me; but I hope you will tell me that I am quite wrong and\r\nthat Britannia rules the waves.\r\n\r\nAn exceptional chance gives us a picture of Foxholes, at this time, when\r\ntwenty years' occupation had enabled its owner to perfect all the details\r\nwhich go to make up comfort.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence in London in the beginning of 1894, he let it, for the\r\nonly time, to his friend, Lord Hobhouse, for many years a member of the\r\nJudicial Committee, and just then convalescent after a serious illness. A\r\ncouple of notes which Lord Hobhouse wrote during his four weeks' tenancy\r\nmay be classed as 'Interiors' or 'Exteriors' from the practical point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nFoxholes, February 16th.\r\n\r\nMy dear Reeve,--I imagine that this morning Mrs. Reeve will have got a note\r\nfrom my wife telling her of our settlement here. I was contemplating 'a\r\nfew words' to you, when Lady H. told me of her writing; and now comes your\r\nletter, partly of welcome, partly of information.\r\n\r\nI don't think it possible that we could be more happily housed. Size,\r\narrangement, warmth, beauty, inside and out, evidences everywhere of\r\ncultivated taste and refined pursuits--all is calculated for enjoyment and\r\nrepose, probably for anybody, certainly for an invalid. I have established\r\nmyself in a corner of the library--which, partly from its intrinsic\r\nadvantages and partly from the presence of a thick cushion in the seat of\r\nthe armchair, I conjecture to be yours--between the writing desk and the\r\nN.W. bookcase, with the N.E. window at my back and my legs protruding\r\nbeyond the jamb of the mantelpiece into the sacred [Greek: temeuos], which\r\nis guarded by a low marble fence, and over which the fire which I\r\nworship has sway. Both by day and by night the situation is perfect for\r\ndistribution of light and warmth. And I can read almost all my waking\r\nhours; for all through my illness my head has been clear. My principal\r\nembarrassment is to choose among the many temptations with which your\r\ngoodly bookcases beset me. However, after reading Traill's 'William III.'\r\n(a rather thin composition, I think) I have settled into Gardiner's 'Civil\r\nWar,' which is much more solid and satisfying.\r\n\r\nThis morning I have been reading your little notice of Lord Derby; and I\r\nthink you do not speak at all too highly of his capacity for examining\r\npolitical and social movements. In 1880 I delivered a lecture, which\r\nwas printed and circulated, on the eternal division of political\r\ntendencies--movement and rest; and I took Lord Derby (then temporarily in\r\nthe Liberal Camp) as the best type of conservatism; cool, patient,\r\nkeen, sceptical, critical, just, impartial, with a mind always open\r\nto conviction, but refusing to move until convinced. Such men are an\r\ninvaluable element in the deliberative stages of every question; but their\r\nvery critical powers paralyse action, and when movement becomes necessary\r\ntheir hesitations are a drawback. I fancy that Cornewall Lewis was just\r\nsuch another, but I did not know so much about him....\r\n\r\nFor me, I improve, slowly but enough, I think, to show at least that our\r\nmove was not premature. In the pick of the day (would that it were always\r\nafternoon) I am able to walk for an hour or more, and I get good sleep in\r\nthe most luxurious of beds. Pray give my kind remembrances to Mrs. Reeve,\r\nand believe me,\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nHOBHOUSE.\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, March 6th._--Alas, alas! time flies away, and pleasant things\r\ncome to an end, and I shall not have many days' more enjoyment of your\r\ncharming house and library and outlook. But my time has not been wasted. I\r\nhave recovered strength, a good deal more than I expected, and am probably\r\nnow--at all events hope, by our return next Monday or Tuesday, to be--able\r\nto re-enter the ordinary routine of life. Of course, we have had, like\r\nother people, a great deal of blustering wind--for the most part from\r\nnorth-west--very cold and very noisy in your chimneys. But there has also\r\nbeen a great deal of sunshine with the gales, and the exposure of your\r\nhouse to south-east has, on most days, given us a sheltered walk. Moreover,\r\nyour soil is so porous and absorbent, that one gets dry walking immediately\r\nafter rain. I have only been kept indoors two days since our arrival.\r\n\r\nA few letters from Reeve himself show the continued activity of his mind,\r\nand at the same time his consciousness of, his readiness for, the end which\r\nwas drawing nigh.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, May 29th._--Lord Derby's Speeches contain more political wisdom\r\nthan any other book of our time. I think people will find out its permanent\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n_June 13th._--I have nothing to correct or alter in the Greville Memoirs,\r\nand am glad to find that some sale of them goes on.\r\n\r\nI am much touched by the [approaching] death of Coleridge, whom I have\r\nknown so well and so long. I expect he will not survive to-day. He dined\r\nwith us at The Club on April 24th, and was then very well. _Sic transit._\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, October 23rd_.--The notices of our old friend Froude\r\n[Footnote: He died on October 20th, in his 77th year.] have been very\r\ngratifying--especially the leader in the 'Times.' He leaves the world quite\r\nglorified, and they now find out what a great man he was. I wonder\r\nwhether you are going to attend the funeral. I never send wreaths on such\r\noccasions, but if I ever did send one it would be now, for I am truly\r\naffected by the loss of such a friend. The newspapers seem to have\r\ndiscovered that there were some big men in the last generation, and that\r\nthere are very few of them in the present.\r\n\r\n_Rutland Gate, February 16th, 1895._--I am pretty well--not worse than\r\nusual; but I don't go out.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, Lady Stanley of Alderley, died this morning. She was\r\nonly ill four days, and expired without pain or suffering at eighty-seven.\r\nTo me an irreparable loss, and to a vast circle of descendants and friends.\r\n[Footnote: Among Reeve's papers there are a great many letters from Lady\r\nStanley of Alderley, telling plainly of the long and close friendship\r\nbetween the two. Unfortunately, there are no available letters from Reeve\r\nto her.]\r\n\r\n_To Rear-Admiral Bridge_ [Footnote: At this time Commander-in-Chief in\r\nAustralian waters.]\r\n\r\n62 Rutland Gate, May 2nd.\r\n\r\nMy dear admiral,--I wish you were in reach of us, to discuss the\r\nextraordinary events which are taking place in the North Pacific, to which\r\nyour articles on that subject have for some time pointed; but no one\r\nforesaw the sudden uprising of Japan.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that, in spite of her victories, Japan is in a very critical\r\nposition, politically speaking. She lies between two huge empires, and she\r\nhas undertaken to occupy more than she can hold. Her position is absolutely\r\nfatal to the grand design of Russia, of crossing the north of Asia to the\r\nPacific, and I expect Russia will not submit to it. But Russia would find\r\nit extremely difficult to carry on military and naval operations at such\r\nan enormous distance from her base. I doubt whether she could destroy the\r\nJapanese fleet, and it certainly is not for our interest that it should be\r\ndestroyed. The disposition here is to observe strict neutrality and watch\r\nthe course of events.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that nobody points out that the United States are the country\r\nwith the largest future interest in the Pacific, and that they must have\r\na voice in this controversy. It also largely affects our own Australian\r\ncolonies. A Russian establishment in Corea would effect a momentous change\r\nin the Pacific, and Japan will doubtless resist it to the uttermost.\r\n\r\nWe are very dull here. Lord Rosebery has sunk into complete insignificance,\r\nand his state of health is doubtful. The Government is rotten, but\r\ncontinues to hold together. I think something must occur before long to\r\nstir the waters.\r\n\r\nWe are going to Foxholes on May 20th to stay there. I have spent a dreary\r\nwinter, being unable to go out, but I am not seriously ill--suffering\r\nchiefly from old age. Mrs. Reeve sends you her kind regards, and I am\r\nalways\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To Miss A. M. Clerke_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 8th_.--Many thanks, dear Miss Clerke, for your elegant\r\nand instructive Life of the Herschels; they could not have had a more\r\naccomplished biographer, if they had waited for it another century. Your\r\narticle on Argon fills me with amazement and admiration. How can the\r\nhuman mind fathom such things! I beg you to send me the corrected proofs\r\nto-morrow by return of post, as I want to make it up immediately. If\r\nanything new is said on the subject at the British Association, you can add\r\na note to be printed at the end of the number.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow is my 82nd birthday--probably the last. But I am not ill, only\r\nfeeble and tired of living so long.\r\n\r\nYours most faithfully,\r\n\r\nH. REEVE.\r\n\r\n_To Captain S. P. Oliver, R.A._\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 12th._--I have sent your corrected proofs [Footnote:\r\n'The French in Madagascar,' October 1895.] to Spottiswoode, with a few\r\nslight suggestions of my own. They will send you a revise.... I see you\r\nhave now so far modified your opinion that you think with me that the\r\nposition of the French is most critical. Unless they can announce some\r\nsignal success in the next two weeks, there will be a disaster and an awful\r\nrow. I see by the map that on the 5th of this month they were still\r\nat Andriba, which I take to be about three-fifths of the distance to\r\nAntananarivo. They have been five months getting there, and as they advance\r\nthe difficulty of bringing up stores, supplies, and reliefs increases, and\r\nwill increase. In my opinion, the Hovas are quite right _not_ to treat for\r\npeace till they see what the rains will do for them. I hope they will hold\r\nout, but avoid fighting.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliver writes that 'One of Reeve's last pieces of work connected\r\nwith the \"Edinburgh Review\" must have been the paragraphs which he\r\nsubstituted for my ending to the article. He was doubtful of the eventual\r\nFrench success, whereas I felt pretty certain that affairs would terminate\r\nas they have done in that island.' The forecast of the result of a\r\ncomplicated business was erroneous, but to make one at all, and to commit\r\nit to paper, was a remarkable display of energy in a dying man who was now\r\nin his eighty-third year.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. T. Norton Longman_\r\n\r\n_Foxholes, September 12th_.--Thanks for your birthday congratulations, but\r\nI doubt whether great age is a subject of congratulation at all.\r\n\r\n_29th_.--I am extremely feeble, faculties low, eyesight weak. I should\r\nlike, if I live so long, to edit the January number of the 'Review;' but\r\nafter that I must stop.\r\n\r\n_October 2nd._--Much obliged to you for your very kind note.... You will\r\ndoubtless pay me on November 15th the sum due then; but I wish to say that\r\nI cannot go on to receive remuneration for services I am scarcely capable\r\nof rendering. Therefore this payment in November will be the last on that\r\naccount [as literary adviser].\r\n\r\nThis was probably the last letter Reeve wrote with his own hand. For\r\nseveral months he had been very much of an invalid, though he had persisted\r\nin continuing his work, in which he found distraction and relief. And no\r\ncomplaint passed his lips. 'The kindest thing you can do for me,' he said\r\nto his anxious wife, 'is to leave me alone.' He made a point of coming down\r\nto breakfast; but his strength was gradually failing, and he moved with\r\ndifficulty. His medical attendant recommended an operation, but this he was\r\nunwilling to undergo, feeling doubtful whether at his advanced age it could\r\nbe successful. Sunday, October 13th, he passed in the library among the\r\nbooks he prized. He dictated a letter, listened to the Psalms of the day,\r\nand asked his wife to read also the First Epistle General of St. Peter.\r\nIn the afternoon Dr. Roberts Thomson and Dr. Davison saw him, and after a\r\nconsultation wrote to the distinguished specialist, Mr. Buckston Browne, to\r\nbe prepared to come on receipt of a telegram. On Monday Reeve was unable\r\nto get up; he consented to undergo the operation, and Mr. Browne was\r\ntelegraphed for. On his arrival, about 7 o'clock in the evening, it was\r\ndecided to lose no more time. The operation was successfully performed,\r\nunder chloroform, and everything, the surgeons hoped, would go well. And\r\nthis they repeated for the next few days; the wound, they thought, was\r\nclosing nicely. At 82, however, wounds do not close readily, and Reeve's\r\nsystem was weakened by some years of bad health. He never regained entire\r\nconsciousness; and though from time to time he gave some directions about\r\nthe 'Review,' they were not intelligible to those who heard; they probably\r\nhad no meaning even to himself. On Monday, October 21st, at half-past\r\none in the morning, 'the one last change was made,' and he passed away\r\npeacefully and without suffering.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Reeve Dr. Roberts Thomson wrote:--\r\n\r\n'I was very much struck with your husband's wonderful patience when I saw\r\nhim, and the calm way in which he was able to face the future--whatever it\r\nhad in store for him. It is some consolation to know that he did not suffer\r\nmuch, and that perhaps, had he recovered from the illness, his health\r\nwould have been so affected that great valetudinarianism would have been\r\ninevitable. To him, this would have been suffering; and for his sake we are\r\nthankful that he was spared it.'\r\n\r\nHis remains were interred in the Brookwood cemetery at Woking on October\r\n24th.\r\n\r\nHe died, literally in harness. On Saturday, October 12th, he dictated a\r\nlast letter on the business of the 'Review;' and his indistinct words\r\nduring the few days of partial unconsciousness showed that his mind was\r\nstill endeavouring to fix itself on what had occupied it for so many years.\r\n\r\nIt was in his editorial capacity that I, who write these lines, first knew\r\nhim in 1866, though I did not make his personal acquaintance till 1877,\r\nwhen he was a few months over 63. I found him a tall, stout, and--though\r\nnot strictly handsome--a good-looking man, who might very well have passed\r\nfor ten years younger than he actually was, and whose burly figure might\r\nhave seemed more at home in the covers or the turnip-fields than in the\r\nPrivy Council Office; his weight, which cannot, even then, have been much\r\nunder eighteen stone, must have stopped his hunting some time before. But\r\nin his manner there was no trace of this fancied rusticity--how could there\r\nbe, indeed, in one trained in society almost from the cradle?--and his\r\nvoice was soft and musical. I have seen it stated that he was pompous,\r\nself-assertive, and dictatorial. That his manners, formed by his mother and\r\nhis aunt on eighteenth-century models, and perfected in Paris among the\r\ntraditions of the _ancien regime_, had about them nothing of the 'hail\r\nfellow, well met' fashion of the present day is very certain, and, joined\r\nto his height (about 6 ft. 1 in.) and his great bulk, may sometimes\r\nhave given him the appearance of speaking _de haut en bas_, and must,\r\nunquestionably, have enabled him to repress any unwelcome or undue\r\nfamiliarity. As an editor, of course, he was dictatorial. We may talk of\r\nthe Republic of Letters; but in point of fact a successful journal is\r\nand must be an autocracy. In his private capacity, I never found in his\r\nconversation that habit of 'laying down the law' which some, with probably\r\ninferior opportunities of judging, have complained of. Of his untiring\r\napplication and power of work enough has already been said; but the uniform\r\ngood luck which attended him through life is worthy of notice. In the\r\ncourse of eighty-two years he experienced no reverse of fortune, no great\r\ndisappointment, and--with the one, though terrible, exception of the death\r\nof his first wife--no great sorrow beyond what is the lot of all men. We\r\nknow that fortune favours the brave. It favours also those who to ability\r\nand temper join prudence, courtesy, and careful, systematic, painstaking\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 82 Reeve had outlived all of his contemporaries--the men who\r\nhad associated with him and worked with him in his youth. Their opinion of\r\nhim is only to be gauged by the fact that, with but few and easily explained\r\nexceptions, the friendships of his early manhood were broken only by the\r\ngrave. The number of friends of forty or fifty years' standing who died\r\nduring the last decade of his life is very remarkable. As these are\r\nwanting, I am happy in being able to conclude this tribute to his memory\r\nby two appreciations, one English, the other French; the first, from and\r\nrepresenting the 'Edinburgh Review' to which it was contributed in January\r\n1896, by Mr. W. E. H. Lecky.\r\n\r\n'Although it has never been the custom of this \"Review\" to withdraw the\r\nveil of anonymity from its writers and its administration, it would be mere\r\naffectation to suffer this number to appear before the public without some\r\nallusion to the great Editor whom we have just lost, and who for forty\r\nyears has watched with indefatigable care over our pages.\r\n\r\n'The career of Mr. Henry Reeve is perhaps the most striking illustration in\r\nour time of how little in English life influence is measured by notoriety.\r\nTo the outer world his name was but little known. He is remembered as the\r\ntranslator of Tocqueville, as the editor of the \"Greville Memoirs,\" as\r\nthe author of a not quite forgotten book on Royal and Republican France,\r\nshowing much knowledge of French literature and politics; as the holder\r\nduring fifty years of the respectable, but not very prominent, post of\r\nRegistrar of the Privy Council. To those who have a more intimate knowledge\r\nof the political and literary life of England, it is well known that during\r\nnearly the whole of his long life he was a powerful and living force in\r\nEnglish literature; that few men of his time have filled a larger place\r\nin some of the most select circles of English social life; and that he\r\nexercised during many years a political influence such as rarely falls\r\nto the lot of any Englishman outside Parliament, or indeed outside the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n'He was born at Norwich in 1813, and brought up in a highly cultivated,\r\nand even brilliant, literary circle. His father, Dr. Reeve, was one of the\r\nearliest contributors to this Review. The Austins, the Opies, the Taylors,\r\nand the Aldersons were closely related to him, and he is said to have been\r\nindebted to his gifted aunt, Sarah Austin, for his appointment in the Privy\r\nCouncil. The family income was not large, and a great part of Mr. Reeve's\r\neducation took place on the Continent, chiefly at Geneva and Munich. He\r\nwent with excellent introductions, and the years he spent abroad were\r\nabundantly fruitful. He learned German so well that he was at one time a\r\ncontributor to a German periodical. He was one of the rare Englishmen who\r\nspoke French almost like a Frenchman, and at a very early age he formed\r\nfriendships with several eminent French writers. His translation of\r\nthe \"Democracy in America,\" by Tocqueville, which appeared in 1835,\r\nstrengthened his hold on French society. Two years later he obtained the\r\nappointment in the Privy Council, which he held until 1887. It was in this\r\noffice that he became the colleague and fast friend of Charles Greville,\r\nwho on his death-bed entrusted him with the publication of his \"Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\n'Mr. Reeve had now obtained an assured income and a steady occupation, but\r\nit was far from satisfying his desire for work. He became a contributor,\r\nand very soon a leading contributor, to the \"Times,\" while his close and\r\nconfidential intercourse with Mr. Delane gave him a considerable voice in\r\nits management. The penny newspaper was still unborn, and the \"Times\" at\r\nthis period was the undisputed monarch of the press, and exercised an\r\ninfluence over public opinion, both in England and on the Continent,\r\nsuch as no existing paper can be said to possess. It is, we believe, no\r\nexaggeration to say that for the space of fifteen years nearly every\r\narticle that appeared in its columns on foreign politics was written by\r\nMr. Reeve, and the period during which he wrote for it included the year\r\n1848,--when foreign politics were of transcendent importance.\r\n\r\n'The great political influence which he at this time exercised naturally\r\ndrew him into close connexion with many of the chief statesmen of his time.\r\nWith Lord Clarendon especially his friendship was close and confidential,\r\nand he received from that statesman almost weekly letters during his\r\nViceroyalty in Ireland and during other of the more critical periods of his\r\ncareer. In France Mr. Reeve's connexions were scarcely less numerous than\r\nin England. Guizot, Thiers, Cousin, Tocqueville, Villemain, Circourt--in\r\nfact, nearly all the leading figures in French literature and\r\npolitics during the reign of Louis Philippe were among his friends or\r\ncorrespondents. He was at all times singularly international in his\r\nsympathies and friendships, and he appears to have been more than once\r\nmade the channel of confidential communications between English and French\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n'It was a task for which he was eminently suited. The qualities which most\r\nimpressed all who came into close communication with him were the strength,\r\nswiftness, and soundness of his judgement, and his unfailing tact and\r\ndiscretion in dealing with delicate questions. He was eminently a man of\r\nthe world, and had quite as much knowledge of men as of books. Probably\r\nfew men of his time have been so frequently and so variously consulted.\r\nHe always spoke with confidence and authority, and his clear, keen-cut,\r\ndecisive sentences, a certain stateliness of manner which did not so much\r\nclaim as assume ascendency, and a somewhat elaborate formality of courtesy\r\nwhich was very efficacious in repelling intruders, sometimes concealed from\r\nstrangers the softer side of his character. But those who knew him well\r\nsoon learnt to recognise the genuine kindliness of his nature, his\r\nremarkable skill in avoiding friction, and the rare steadiness of his\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\n'One great source of his influence was the just belief in his complete\r\nindependence and disinterestedness. For a very able man his ambition was\r\nsingularly moderate. As he once said, he had made it his object throughout\r\nlife only to aim at things which were well within his power. He had very\r\nlittle respect for the judgement of the multitude, and he cared nothing\r\nfor notoriety and not much for dignities. A moderate competence, congenial\r\nwork, a sphere of wide and genuine influence, a close and intimate\r\nfriendship with a large proportion of the guiding spirits of his time, were\r\nthe things he really valued, and all these he fully attained. He had great\r\nconversational powers, which never degenerated into monologue, a singularly\r\nequable, happy, and sanguine temperament, and a keen delight in cultivated\r\nsociety. He might be seen to special advantage in two small and very select\r\ndining clubs which have included most of the more distinguished English\r\nstatesmen and men of letters of the century. He became a member of the\r\nLiterary Society in 1857 and of Dr. Johnson's Club in 1861, and it is a\r\nremarkable evidence of the appreciation of his social tact that both bodies\r\nspeedily selected him as their treasurer. He held that position in \"The\r\nClub\" from 1868 till 1893, when failing health and absence from\r\nLondon obliged him to relinquish it. The French Institute elected him\r\n\"Correspondant\" in 1865 and Associated Member in 1888, in which latter\r\ndignity he succeeded Sir Henry Maine. In 1870 the University of Oxford\r\nconferred on him the honorary degree of D.C.L.\r\n\r\n'It was in 1855, on the resignation of Sir George Cornewall Lewis, that he\r\nassumed the editorship of this \"Review,\" which he retained till the day\r\nof his death. Both on the political and the literary side he was in full\r\nharmony with its traditions. His rare and minute knowledge of recent\r\nEnglish and foreign political history; his vast fund of political anecdote;\r\nhis personal acquaintance with so many of the chief actors on the political\r\nscene, both in England and France, gave a great weight and authority to his\r\njudgements, and his mind was essentially of the Whig cast. He was a genuine\r\nLiberal of the school of Russell, Palmerston, Clarendon, and Cornewall\r\nLewis. It was a sober and tolerant Liberalism, rooted in the traditions\r\nof the past, and deeply attached to the historical elements in the\r\nConstitution. The dislike and distrust with which he had always viewed the\r\nprogress of democracy deepened with age, and it was his firm conviction\r\nthat it could never become the permanent basis of good government. Like\r\nmost men of his type of thought and character, he was strongly repelled by\r\nthe later career of Mr. Gladstone, and the Home Rule policy at last severed\r\nhim definitely from the bulk of the Liberal party. From this time the\r\npresent Duke of Devonshire was the leader of his party.\r\n\r\n'His literary judgements had much analogy to his political ones. His\r\nleanings were all towards the old standards of thought and style. He had\r\nbeen formed in the school of Macaulay and Milman, and of the great French\r\nwriters under Louis Philippe. Sober thought, clear reasoning, solid\r\nscholarship, a transparent, vivid, and restrained style were the literary\r\nqualities he most appreciated. He was a great purist, inexorably hostile\r\nto a new word. In philosophy he was a devoted disciple of Kant, and his\r\ndecided orthodoxy in religious belief affected many of his judgements. He\r\ncould not appreciate Carlyle; he looked with much distrust on Darwinism and\r\nthe philosophy of Herbert Spencer, and he had very little patience with\r\nsome of the moral and intellectual extravagances of modern literature. But,\r\naccording to his own standards and in the wide range of his own subjects,\r\nhis literary judgement was eminently sound, and he was quick and generous\r\nin recognising rising eminence. In at least one case the first considerable\r\nrecognition of a prominent historian was an article in this \"Review\" from\r\nhis pen.\r\n\r\n'He had a strong sense of the responsibility of an editor, and especially\r\nof the editor of a Review of unsigned articles. No article appeared which\r\nhe did not carefully consider. His powerful individuality was deeply\r\nstamped upon the \"Review,\" and he carefully maintained its unity and\r\nconsistency of sentiments. It was one of the chief occupations and\r\npleasures of his closing days, and the very last letter he dictated\r\nreferred to it.\r\n\r\n'Time, as might be expected, had greatly thinned the circle of his friends.\r\nOf the France which he knew so well scarcely anything remained, but his old\r\nfriend and senior, Barthélemy St.-Hilaire, visited him at Christ-Church,\r\nand he kept up to the end a warm friendship with the Duc d'Aumale. He spent\r\nhis 80th birthday at Chantilly, and until the very last year of his life he\r\nwas never absent when the Duke dined at \"The Club.\" In Lord Derby he lost\r\nthe statesman with whom in his later years he was most closely connected by\r\nprivate friendship and political sympathy, while the death of Lady Stanley\r\nof Alderley deprived him of an attached and lifelong friend.\r\n\r\n'Growing infirmities prevented him in his latter days from mixing much in\r\ngeneral society in London, but his life was brightened by all that loving\r\ncompanionship could give; his mental powers were unfaded, and he could\r\nstill enjoy the society of younger friends. He looked forward to the end\r\nwith a perfect and a most characteristic calm, without fear and without\r\nregret. It was the placid close of a long, dignified, and useful life.'\r\n\r\nThe second, the French appreciation, was spoken at the meeting of the\r\n'Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques,' on November 16th, 1895,\r\nby the Duc d'Aumale, who, after regretting his absence on the previous\r\noccasion when the President had announced the death of their foreign\r\nmember, Mr. Henry Reeve, continued:\r\n\r\n'Je n'aurais sans doute rien pu ajouter à ce qui a été si bien dit par M.\r\nle Président, mais je tenais à rendre personnellement hommage à la mémoire\r\nd'un confrère éminent, pour lequel je professais une haute estime et une\r\nsincère amitié, et je demande à l'Académie la permission de lui adresser\r\nquelques mots.\r\n\r\n'Qu'on l'envisage au point de vue littéraire ou au point de vue social,\r\nla figure d'Henry Reeve était essentiellement originale, et il devait ce\r\ncaractère non seulement à la nature de son esprit, mais à l'éducation qu'il\r\navait reçue. Sur la base anglaise de la forte instruction classique son\r\npère [Footnote: A momentary lapse of memory. It is scarcely possible that\r\nthe Duc d'Aumale did not know that Reeve's father died whilst Reeve was\r\nstill an infant, and that his education was directed by his mother.] voulut\r\najouter le couronnement des hautes études continentales, et, pour que cette\r\nculture intellectuelle n'eût rien d'exclusif ou d'absolu il fit choix de\r\nGenève et de Munich. C'cst dans ces deux villes, dans ces deux grands\r\ncentres intellectuels, que Reeve passa une partie de sa jeunesse. Ce séjour\r\ndans des milieux si différents laissa dans son esprit une double impression\r\nqui se refléta sur toute sa vie.\r\n\r\n'Peu de personnes, de nos jours, ont aussi bien connu que lui cette\r\ncharmante et originale société de Genève, qui semblait dater du\r\ndix-huitième siècle, et qui en a si longtemps conservé les traditions.\r\nC'est là qu'il acquit la connaissance approfondie de notre langue; il en\r\navait saisi les nuances délicates; il connaissait toute notre littérature.\r\nJe ne connais guère d'étrangers qui puissent parler, comprendre, écrire le\r\nfrançais mieux que lui.\r\n\r\n'L'allemand ne lui était pas moins familier. Le séjour à Munich lui inspira\r\naussi le goût des arts envisagés à un point de vue qui n'est pas tout à\r\nfait le nôtre. Dans un petit volume, oeuvre de jeunesse, \"Graphidae,\" il\r\ntraduisit sous une forme poétique l'impression que lui avaient laissée les\r\noeuvres des premiers maîtres italiens. On y retrouve, avec la mesure qui\r\netait un des caractères de cet esprit bien pondéré, la trace des théories\r\nqui prévalaient alors dans l'Allemagne méridionale.\r\n\r\n'À d'autres points de vue ce long séjour à l'étranger lui avait laissé\r\ndes traces plus profondes encore. Il en avait rapporté une sorte de\r\ncosmopolitisme éclairé, tempéré, entretenu par ses nombreuses relations.\r\nJe ne veux pas dire qu'il ne fut pas Anglais avant tout. Passionnément\r\npatriote--et ce n'est pas moi qui lui en ferai un reproche--il épousait les\r\npassions, les colères de son pays, mais sans rudesse, sans hauteur, sans\r\nhaine ou mépris des autres peuples, sans préjugés contre aucune nation\r\nétrangère.\r\n\r\n'Il ne cessa d'entretenir des relations intimes et constantes avec tout le\r\nparti libéral français (je prends le mot libéral dans le vrai sens, le sens\r\nle plus large), depuis M. le Duc de Broglie et M. Gruizot jusqu'à notre\r\nvénéré confrère M. Barthelémy Saint-Hilaire.\r\n\r\n'Malgré son impartialité j'oserai dire qu'il avait une certaine faiblesse\r\npour la France. Certes il n'aurait jamais épousé la cause de la France\r\nengagée contre l'Angleterre; mais quand il voyait la France et l'Angleterre\r\nd'accord sa joie était vive. Et lors de nos malheurs, sans prendre parti\r\ndans la querelle, il n'a jamais cachée la sympathie que lui inspirait la\r\nFrance vaincue.\r\n\r\n'Je ne sache pas que Reeve ait écrit aucun ouvrage de longue haleine, sauf\r\ncertaines traductions difficiles, importantes: quelques-unes rappellent à\r\ncette compagnie des noms qui lui sont chers--la \"Vie de Washington,\" par\r\nGuizot; la \"Démocratic,\" de Tocqueville, un de ses plus intimes amis.\r\n\r\n'Il n'a pas pris une part directe au mouvement des affaires de son pays,\r\nn'ayant siégé ni dans le parlement ni dans aucun cabinet; mais son\r\ninfluence était considérable: sans cesse consulté, souvent chargé de\r\nmessages importants; enfin sa plume, sa plume surtout, ne restait jamais\r\ninactive, et ses écrits portaient coup. Le \"Times\" l'a compte longtemps\r\nparmi ses principaux collaborateurs; plus tard il se recueillit et se\r\nconsacra exclusivement à la direction de la \"Revue d'Edimbourg,\" dont il\r\navait été longtemps un des principaux redacteurs. [Footnote: The Duke would\r\nseem to have misunderstood Reeve's position, or, more probably, his\r\nmemory was confused by the lapse of forty years. Reeve was never _'un des\r\nprincipaux rédacteurs'_ of the Edinburgh Review. Till he became sole editor\r\nand, in a literary sense, autocrat, he had no part in the conduct of it,\r\nnor was he a constant contributor (cf. _ante_, vol. i. p. 173).]\r\n\r\n'Je n'ai pas besoin de rappeler à l'Académie quel rôle appartient à\r\n\"l'editeur\" dans les grandes revues anglaises, quelle part il prend au\r\nchoix des sujets, à la rédaction des articles, quelle autorité il exerce,\r\nni de m'etendre sur l'histoire du plus ancien, je crois, des recueils\r\npériodiques, assurément un des plus importants. La \"Revue d'Edimbourg\" est\r\nplus qu'un simple organe; souvent elle donne la note, la formule des idées\r\nacceptées par le parti dont elle continue d'arborer les couleurs sur sa\r\ncouverture bleue et chamois, les couleurs de M. Fox.\r\n\r\n'J'ai dit que Reeve n'avait pas pris part au gouvernement. Il exerçait\r\ncependant une charge, un veritable office de judicature, dont les\r\nattributions ne sont pas d'accord avec nos moeurs et dont le titre même se\r\ntraduit difficilement dans notre langue. Attaché au Conseil privé comme\r\n_Appeal Clerk_, puis comme Registrar, il jugeait des appels des îles de la\r\nManche. [Footnote: This, as has been seen (ante, vol. i. pp. 85-6), is a\r\nvery inexact and imperfect description of Reeve's duties, either as Clerk\r\nof Appeals or as Registrar.] On comprend qu'une connaissance si parfaite\r\nde la langue et des usages français le qualifiait particulièrement pour\r\nremplir ces fonctions, quand on songe que la langue officielle de ces\r\nîles est encore aujourd'hui le français et que dans les questions de\r\njurisprudence la coutume de Normandie y est constamment invoquée.\r\n\r\n'Officiellement Reeve était sous les ordres du secrétaire du Conseil privé,\r\net ces rapports de subordination avaient créé des relations intimes entre\r\nson supérieur et lui. M. Charles Gréville avait tenu la plume du Conseil\r\ndans des circonstances deélicates et s'était trouvé mêlé à une foule\r\nd'incidents; en mourant il chargea Reeve de publier ses mémoires. Cette\r\npublication eut un grand retentissement.\r\n\r\n'Reeve était fier d'appartenir à votre compagnie. Lorsque l'Université\r\nd'Oxford me conféra le degré de docteur il était près de moi.\r\n\"Rappelez-vous,\" me dit-il en souriant, \"que l'Académie des Sciences\r\nMorales a sa part dans l'honneur que vous venez de recevoir.\" Fort répandu,\r\nfort apprécie dans le monde, il menait de front ses travaux littéraires,\r\nses devoirs de juge, ses relations sociales, ses excursions; son activité\r\nétait extraordinaire. La goutte le gênait quelquefois, et d'année en année\r\nses visites devenaient plus fréquentes.\r\n\r\n'Il avait bâti au bord la mer, en face de l'île de Wight, sous un climat\r\ndoux, une charmante villa, où il aimait a s'enfermer avec ses livres,\r\npoursuivant ses travaux auprès de la digne et gracieuse compagne de sa vie.\r\nSes dernières années s'écoulèrent ainsi entre cette résidence et la maison\r\nbien connue de Rutland Gate, où sa table hospitalière était toujours\r\nouverte à ses amis de France ou d'ailleurs. C'est à Foxholes que la mort\r\nest venue le chercher.\r\n\r\n'Je n'ai pas la préention de prononcer devant vous l'éloge d'Henry Reeve;\r\nla competence me manque comme la preparation. En vous rappelant quelques\r\ntraits de cette noble figure je voulais, comme je vous l'ai dit tout à\r\nl'heure, acquitter une dette de coeur envers un ami qui, jusqu'aux derniers\r\nmoments de sa vie, m'a prodigué les marques d'affection. Il voulut célébrer\r\nà Chantilly le 80e anniversaire de sa naissance, et un de ses derniers\r\nsoucis était de réclamer les bonnes feuilles du septième volume de\r\n\"L'Histoire des Condé,\" dont il voulait rendre compte dans sa Revue.\r\n[Footnote: The present writer feels a personal satisfaction in adding\r\nthat one of the last letters which Reeve dictated about the work of the\r\n_Review_, was to him, asking him to undertake this article.]\r\n\r\n'La mémoire du philosophe, du lettré, de l'érudit, dn confrère éminent, de\r\nl'homme bon et aimable, mérite de rester honorée dans notre compagnie.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been seen (_ante_, vol. ii.) that Reeve intended quoting Lord\r\nStanmore's letter on the formation of the Aberdeen Cabinet, in a future\r\nedition of the 'Greville Memoirs.' There seems, however, to have been no\r\nopportunity for doing so, and the letter has remained buried in the\r\ncolumns of the 'Times' of June 13, 1887, becoming each year more and more\r\ninaccessible. As relating to an interesting point raised by the 'Greville\r\nMemoirs,' and also as, to some extent, carrying out Reeve's intention, it\r\nis here reprinted, with Lord Stanmore's express permission.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the 'Times'_\r\n\r\nSir,--It is only recently that the two new volumes of the 'Greville\r\nMemoirs' lately published have reached Ceylon. I fear that before this\r\nletter can arrive in England the interest excited by their appearance will\r\nhave passed away, and that, consequently, comments upon their contents\r\naddressed to you may seem as much out of place as would a letter written\r\nfor the purpose of correcting some error in any well-known collection of\r\nmemoirs which have been long before the world. It is therefore not without\r\nsome hesitation that I venture to request permission from you to point out\r\nthe inaccuracy of a statement which appears near the commencement of the\r\nfirst of these two volumes, and casts an undeserved imputation upon the\r\nconduct, in 1852, of the chief members of the Peelite party.\r\n\r\nMr. Greville, under the date of December 28, 1852, writes thus:--\r\n\r\n'Clarendon told me last night that the Peelites have behaved very ill, and\r\nhave grasped at everything; and he mentioned some very flagrant cases, in\r\nwhich, after the distribution had been settled between Aberdeen and John\r\nRussell, Newcastle and Sidney Herbert--for they appear to have been the\r\nmost active in the matter--persuaded Aberdeen to alter it, and bestow or\r\noffer offices intended for Whigs to Peelites, and in some instances to\r\nDerbyites who had been Peelites' (vol. i.).\r\n\r\nIn the next two pages lie comments with severity on the selfishness and\r\nshortsightedness of the Peelites in reference to this matter. Now, the\r\nreflection thus cast on the foresight and disinterestedness of the Peelite\r\nleaders is in no wise warranted by the facts. What really occurred at the\r\nformation of the Cabinet of December 1852 was, in truth, the exact reverse\r\nof what is stated in Mr. Greville's pages. It was not the Peelites, but\r\nLord John Russell and the Whigs, who, after the list of the Cabinet and of\r\nthe chief officers of the State had been agreed on between Lord Aberdeen\r\nand Lord John Russell, and had been submitted to and approved by the Queen,\r\nobjected to the composition of the Cabinet as 'too Peelite,' and strove to\r\nchange the arrangements made originally with Lord John Russell's entire\r\nacquiescence. I will not, however, occupy your space with remarks of my\r\nown; I will at once produce incontestable proof of what I have asserted. I\r\nhave now before me a manuscript journal kept by Sir James Graham, and from\r\nit I quote the following extracts. In reading them it should be borne in\r\nmind that the proposed distribution of offices agreed on between Lord\r\nAberdeen and Lord John Russell had been formally approved by the Queen on\r\nDecember 23rd.\r\n\r\n_December 24th_.--'Lord John Russell most unexpectedly raised fresh\r\ndifficulties this morning, on the ground that the Whigs are not represented\r\nin the new Cabinet sufficiently. He wished that Sir F. Baring should be\r\nplaced at the Board of Trade to the exclusion of Cardwell; that Lord\r\nClarendon should have the Duchy, with a seat in the Cabinet; and that Lord\r\nGranville should be President of the Council. He thus proposed at one\r\n_coup_ an infusion of three additional Whigs, and talked of Lord Carlisle\r\nas the fittest person for the Lieutenancy of Ireland. It became necessary\r\nto make a stand and to bring the Whigs to their ultimatum. Lord Aberdeen\r\nconsented to Lord Granville as President, and proposed that Lord Lansdowne\r\nshould sit in the Cabinet, without an office. This proposition, which\r\nreduced the Whig addition, from three to two, saved the Board of Trade for\r\nCardwell, but excluded both him and Canning from the Cabinet. Lord John\r\ndid not regard it as satisfactory, and fought the point so long and so\r\npertinaciously, that the new writs could not be moved to-day, and the\r\nHouse was adjourned till Monday. Towards evening, at the instance of Lord\r\nLansdowne, Lord John Russell yielded an unwilling assent to Lord Aberdeen's\r\nlast proposals...'\r\n\r\n_December 25th_.--'Lord John Russell is very much annoyed by the\r\ndisparaging tone of the articles in the \"Times,\" which, while it supports\r\nLord Aberdeen, attacks him [Russell] and the Whigs. He is still also\r\ndissatisfied in the exclusion of Lord Clarendon and of Sir George Grey from\r\nthe Cabinet, and thinks that the Whig share of the spoil is insufficient.\r\nIt is melancholy to see how little fitness for office is regarded on all\r\nsides, and how much the public employments are treated as booty to be\r\ndivided among successful combatants. The Irish Government, also, is still\r\na matter of contest. The Whigs are anxious to displace Blackburne and to\r\nreplace him with Brady, their former Chancellor; they are jealous also of\r\nSt. Germans and Young, as Lord-Lieutenant and Chief Secretary, and want to\r\nhave Lord Carlisle substituted for the former. I discussed these matters at\r\nArgyll House with Lord John and Lord Aberdeen. If we three were left\r\nalone, we could easily adjust every difficulty; it is the intervention of\r\ninterested parties on opposite sides which mars every settlement...'\r\n\r\n_December 27th_.--'The Whigs returned to the charge, and claimed in a most\r\nmenacing manner a larger share of the minor offices. Sir C. Wood and Mr.\r\nHayter came to me in the first instance and tried to shake me individually\r\nin my opinion. I was stout and combated all their arguments, which assumed\r\nan angry tone. We came to no satisfactory conclusion in my house, and the\r\ndiscussion was adjourned to Lord John's. I found Lord John more amenable to\r\nreason; but the whole arrangement was on the point of being broken off.\r\nIt was 1 o'clock. The House of Commons was to meet at 2 by special\r\nadjournment, and the writs were to be issued punctually at that hour.\r\nSir C. Wood intimated that unless some further concessions were made\r\nthe arrangement was at an end, and that the moving of the writs must be\r\npostponed. I said I should go down to the House, and make then and there\r\na full statement of the case, and recall by telegraph my address to\r\nthe electors of Carlisle, which declared my acceptance of office. This\r\nfirmness, coupled with my rising to leave the room, brought the gentlemen\r\nto reason. I had a note in my pocket from Lord Aberdeen, which placed the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster at their disposal, and Strutt was in the House ready to\r\nreceive it at the hands of Lord John. This offer was snatched immediately;\r\nStrutt was consulted and accepted on the spot, and Hayter was sent to the\r\nHouse of Commons, and he moved the writs of the Cabinet Ministers, of\r\nStrutt also, and of Baines...'\r\n\r\n_December 28th_.--'The contest as to minor offices was renewed with equal\r\npertinacity, but with less effect, after the moving of the principal writs.\r\nA battle was fought for the Great Seal of Ireland, which was ultimately\r\nyielded to Brady, the ex-Whig Chancellor. This concession was no sooner\r\nmade than an attempt to force Reddington as the Under-Secretary for Ireland\r\nwas commenced. He, being a Catholic, had consented to the Ecclesiastical\r\nTitles Bill, against his private judgement and in defiance of his\r\ncoreligionists. His appointment would have been war with the Brigade, and\r\nit was necessary to refuse it peremptorily. The dissatisfaction of\r\nLord Clarendon and of Lord John Russell was eagerly expressed, but was\r\nultimately mitigated by the offer to Reddington of the Secretaryship of\r\nthe Board of Control. The suggestion that Lord John might provide for him\r\nabroad was not so favourably entertained. I have never passed a week so\r\nunpleasantly. It was a battle for places from hostile camps, and the Whigs\r\ndisregarded fitness for the public service altogether. They fought\r\nfor their men as partisans, and all other considerations, as well as\r\nconsequences, were disregarded. Lord Aberdeen's patience and justice are\r\nexemplary; he is firm and yet conciliatory, and has ended by making an\r\narrangement which is, on the whole, impartial and quite as satisfactory as\r\ncircumstances would permit.'\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Sir James Graham on points of fact will hardly be disputed,\r\nnor will it be denied that he, who took an active part in the construction\r\nof the Government and was in the most intimate confidence of Lord Aberdeen,\r\nwas in a better position for knowing what passed than Mr. Greville, who\r\nwas dependent on the information which he received from others. But if any\r\nconfirmation be desired it will be found in the extracts which I add from\r\nthe correspondence of Lord Aberdeen. The Queen, as I have before said,\r\napproved the lists submitted to her on December 23rd. The same evening,\r\nLord John Russell wrote to Lord Aberdeen as follows:--\r\n\r\n'I am told that the whole complexion of the Government will look too\r\nPeelite. G. Grey suggests, and I concur, that Clarendon should be President\r\nof the Council immediately, and when he leaves it someone else may be\r\nnamed--Harrowby or Granville. I am seriously afraid that the whole thing\r\nwill break down from the weakness of the old Liberal party (I must not say\r\nWhig) in the Cabinet. To this must be added:--President of the Board of\r\nTrade, Postmaster, Chief Secretary for Ireland, all in Peelite hands. I\r\nsend a note which Bessborough has given me, and which is said to convey the\r\nopinion of the Irish Liberal members. _It is not very reasonable_, but I\r\nthink Blackburne should be changed for Moore, and St. Germans for Lord\r\nCarlisle. Palmerston consents to Bernal Osborne. You should write or see\r\nCranworth. Forgive all this trouble.'\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen replied:--\r\n\r\n'I do not admit the justice of the criticism made on the composition of the\r\nCabinet, if you fairly estimate the persons and the offices they fill. I do\r\nnot object to Clarendon; but my fear is that he will not be able to do the\r\nbusiness of the office in the House of Lords, and we are so weak there that\r\nI entertain very great apprehensions.'\r\n\r\nLord John rejoined:--\r\n\r\n'What I suggest is (1) that, as I have frequently proposed, with your\r\nconsent, Lord Granville should be Lord President; (2) that Sir F. Baring\r\nshould be President of the Board of Trade, with a seat in the Cabinet; (3)\r\nthat Clarendon should at once enter the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy\r\nof Lancaster; (4) that Lord Stanley of Alderley should be Vice-President,\r\nnot in the Cabinet. Let me add to what I have said that ten Whigs, members\r\nof former Cabinets, are omitted in this, while only two Peelites are\r\nomitted, and one entirely new is admitted--Argyll. Let me propose further\r\nthat the minor posts be recast with less disproportion. Cardwell ought not\r\nto have office while Labouchere, Vernon Smith, and others are excluded.\r\n\r\n'Pray let me have an answer before the writs are moved. I have sent for F.\r\nBaring. If he will not join, G. Grey will.\r\n\r\n'P.S.--About Ireland afterwards.'\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this letter Lord Aberdeen wrote to the Queen that it\r\nput it entirely out of his power to go to Windsor on that day as had been\r\nintended, and that 'he regretted to say that the new propositions, which\r\nhad been made by Lord John that morning, although the scheme submitted to\r\nthe Queen had been approved of, were so extensive as very seriously to\r\nendanger the success of his [Lord Aberdeen's] undertaking.'\r\n\r\nIt appears to me to be thus shown, beyond dispute or question, that it was\r\nthe Whigs and not the Peelites who, after the distribution of offices had\r\nbeen fully agreed on, and approved by the Queen, sought to modify the\r\narrangements effected. Whether the Whigs had or had not cause for their\r\ndiscontent is another question, on which it is unnecessary now to enter.\r\nThat such discontent was (considering their numerical strength) extremely\r\nnatural, none can deny. That, on the other hand, it would have been\r\nimpossible to exclude Sir James Graham, Mr. Gladstone, or the Duke of\r\nNewcastle from a Cabinet formed and presided over by Lord Aberdeen, and\r\nthat the important share taken by Mr. Sidney Herbert in the overthrow of\r\nLord Derby's Government rendered him also entitled to claim Cabinet office,\r\nmost men will admit.\r\n\r\nWhile anxious to correct a statement which appears to me injurious to the\r\nreputation of public men, some of whom are still living, I trust I may\r\nbe permitted at the same time to record my strong sense of the general\r\naccuracy of Mr. Greville's information. Where his notes are inaccurate,\r\ntheir inaccuracy may, I believe, be more generally accounted for by his\r\nomission in those cases to insert in his diary (as in many other instances\r\nhe has done) a subsequent correction of the erroneous reports which had in\r\nthe first instance reached him.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nARTHUR GORDON.",
